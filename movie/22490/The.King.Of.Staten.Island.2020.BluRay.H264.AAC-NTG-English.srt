I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,544
Get back!

15
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,839
I love this movie.
They shot this on staten island.

16
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,171
Oh, god!

17
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,535
- Awesome.
- Hell, yeah.

18
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,140
- Ew!
- That's my shit.

19
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,683
This movie makes no sense.

20
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,934
Why? Why would the government
make a purge legal?

21
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,481
Clearly to let them blow off some steam.
Hello.

22
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,436
- That's why you go to the spa.
- Yeah. Or the therapist.

23
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,895
Or get your nails done. Or...

24
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,356
Or murder some folks. Hmm?

25
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,451
I mean, come on, guys.

26
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,322
I brought Tara over so that
we could get out of this basement.

27
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,869
Let's go out. Let's go dancing.

28
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,696
- I love dancing.
- Let's do something.

29
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,952
We don't go out.

30
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,453
We don't dance.

31
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,314
- The purge is not enough for you?
- No.

32
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,440
Does anybody else like dancing?

33
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,670
- I like it.
- Yes, me!

34
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,872
- You do?
- I love dancing.

35
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,173
Yes. He loves...
He's a really good dancer.

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,625
What's your favorite move?

37
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,253
It's kind of like a shake.

38
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,159
- A shake? That's...
- I don't know.

39
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,969
I just do whatever
the music tells me to do.

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,426
There's nothing but douchebags
at these clubs.

41
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,207
- I love it here, man. It's safe.
- Oh, but, come on.

42
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,812
God, you just sit here all day,

43
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,855
and then smoke weed
and jerk each other off.

44
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,087
- Yeah.
- That sounds amazing.

45
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,022
I've never been jerked off
by any of my friends.

46
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,228
Me, either.

47
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,562
I like your tattoos.

48
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,147
I knew you would, right?

49
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,803
- Oh, my god. That...
- No, don't talk to him.

50
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,613
- He has chlamydia.
- I had.

51
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,410
- Oh, my god.
- Had chlamydia.

52
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,599
- It's curable.
- You introduced me

53
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,102
to the girl that gave me chlamydia,
so you basically gave me chlamydia.

54
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,411
You assisted the chlamydia.

55
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,663
He doesn't have insurance.
He can't get the meds.

56
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,415
I actually did some of those.

57
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,192
- You did?
- You know I got to rep the island.

58
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,080
Hey!

59
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,528
- Staten island.
- Wow, staten.

60
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,258
- Sl, you know.
- Yeah.

61
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,677
- Looks so good.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,534
- You have a bunch of tattoos also.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,764
What is that date?

64
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,513
Oh, that's the date my dad died.

65
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,889
Oh, my god, your dad died? I'm so sorry.

66
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,937
Don't be. It's fine. It's totally cool.

67
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,434
So, what happened?

68
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,141
- Okay, you don't need to ask.
- Ooh! No.

69
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,463
- No, no, no, no.
- Don't ask that.

70
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,647
It's kind of inappropriate.

71
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,731
He was a fireman. So, he died in a fire.

72
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,656
Oh, my god.

73
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,639
- Yeah, we knew.
- Yeah, we knew.

74
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,496
We don't like to talk about it.
That's why we don't bring it up.

75
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,644
- Apologize to Scott.
- It's the right thing to do.

76
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,479
- You should say sorry.
- Apologize or get out.

77
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,788
It's not okay.

78
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,713
Scott, I just wanted to say

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,337
that I'm really sorry
that I asked about your tattoo.

80
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,754
What?

81
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,244
- He doesn't care. It's fine.
- He doesn't care.

82
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,179
Look at him. He's laughing so much.

83
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,180
I don't care.

84
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,512
We talk about his dead dad all the time.

85
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,981
Knock, knock. “Who's there?

86
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,068
Not your dad.

87
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,466
- That's my favorite one!
- Oh, my god, that's so funny.

88
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,855
We've made so many jokes about it.

89
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,359
Oh, my god, I don't even...

90
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,193
- I don't even miss him at all.
- So funny.

91
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,322
Yeah.

92
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,732
Oh, yeah, that's pretty good.
Keep doing that! Keep doing that!

93
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,087
Are you... are you happy?

94
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,337
- Yes, yes, it's fucking great!
- Keep going!

95
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,792
No, wait, don't stop!

96
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,049
Did you... did you come?

97
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,850
Well, yes.

98
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,680
Were you there? Yeah, I did.

99
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,014
- Like, six times.
- Cool.

100
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,518
- Awesome.
- It was great.

101
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,020
- Did you?
- No, no, no.

102
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,692
But it's okay. I had fun.

103
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,272
I had fun back there.

104
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,732
I feel bad that you never do.

105
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,159
No, I do all the time.

106
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,079
I just... I don't put on
a Broadway show like you do.

107
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,371
I'm more quiet.

108
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,289
I'm more like Charlie chaplin
when I come.

109
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,335
- Like a silent movie.
- Silent movie.

110
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,961
Do you think it's the antidepressants?

111
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,960
Oh, yeah, for sure.

112
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,571
If I didn't have the antidepressants,
I'd come in eight seconds.

113
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,800
And then you wouldn't come.
And then you'd be depressed.

114
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,770
And then you would
have to take antidepressants.

115
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,684
I don't know, can I say something? I...
Yeah.

116
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,348
I just still don't understand
why this is such a big secret.

117
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,309
You know why it's a big secret.
'Cause it's special.

118
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,895
It's our thing, you know?

119
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,652
It wouldn't be special
if everybody knew about it.

120
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,984
Yeah, but I don't just want to do this.

121
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,953
Yeah, I totally get that.
So, should we stop?

122
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,246
No, I...

123
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,745
I don't know. This. What is this?

124
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,501
- This? This is...
- I want to do what normal people do.

125
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,958
Yeah, I know.
I just... it might be weird.

126
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,384
We've known each other for, like, ever.

127
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,553
Since fourth grade.
It would be like incest.

128
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,130
No, it wouldn't.

129
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,181
No, it's like, yeah, we're best pals,

130
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,225
and I wouldn't want to
jeopardize our friendship

131
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,180
or something like that over something...

132
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,266
Not silly, but it's a big risk.

133
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,818
But we've already done the deed.
I mean, what else is there?

134
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,237
- "Done the deed"?
- I don't know.

135
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,530
But it's just...

136
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,528
You deserve somebody way better than me.

137
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,780
What? You're a good guy.

138
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,487
You're a good guy. I like you.

139
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,619
Well, I... based on what? I mean,
I like you, too. It's just like...

140
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,126
All right, can I tell you something?
But can you not tell anybody?

141
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,127
Well, people probably know, but, like...

142
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,044
There's something wrong with me.

143
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,925
Like, mentally. “What?

144
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm not okay up there. You know? Like...

145
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,599
I get all manic and crazy,

146
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,229
and I make really insane,
impulsive decisions, and I get...

147
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:30,527
I'm scared of myself, and I don't...

148
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,404
I don't want to scare you or me
or hurt anyone, you know?

149
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,737
So, I think it would just be best
and really responsible of me

150
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,447
if I just backed off, you know?

151
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,918
I don't want you to feel like that
about yourself.

152
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,120
Oh, no, it's...

153
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,547
I just don't want to offend you,
you know?

154
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,217
You're the best.
I think you're the greatest.

155
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,920
I know you think I'm great.
I'm awesome.

156
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,758
I feel bad that you don't
think you're great.

157
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,623
Hey, honey.

158
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,167
I made you an omelet.

159
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,176
What are you gonna wear
to your sister's graduation party?

160
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,056
I was thinking,
what about one of your dad's suits?

161
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,480
I don't know. I don't think
I'm really a suit guy, you know?

162
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,899
Plus, all those suits
are out of style, so...

163
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,484
I thought they were back in style.

164
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,857
And can you not smoke pot
before the party?

165
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,236
Why?

166
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,693
Because it smells. You smell bad.

167
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,683
And no vaping because
they're gonna think it's pot.

168
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,039
The uncle is a cop.
We don't need that kind of trouble.

169
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,741
Fuck that guy.

170
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:09,000
I hate this family.
They're so rich and snooty.

171
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,751
They've been really nice to Claire.

172
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,049
Hey, mom.
You got me the plastic containers.

173
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,172
I just need the cardboard boxes
I can throw away.

174
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,003
But they're so good for storing things.

175
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,431
Yeah, but I don't have any storage.
My closet's two feet wide.

176
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,885
Hey, Claire, do you even want me
at your graduation party?

177
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,145
Do I want you to go? I don't care.
Just... it's weird if you don't go.

178
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,396
That wasn't exactly a warm invitation.

179
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,674
Yeah, well, it's not the part
I'm looking forward to most.

180
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,155
- But I want you to be there.
- She wants you to go.

181
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,607
No, she doesn't. She just said it.

182
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,613
- I don't want him to go.
- He has to go.

183
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,384
Just don't sit on the couch in
the corner the whole time. It's weird.

184
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,604
I don't see the problem
with sitting in the corner, okay?

185
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,745
Some people go to the party and dance,
and some sit in the corner.

186
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,171
I'm the corner guy. Accept your brother.

187
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,298
Also, don't try to fuck Layla, okay?
She told you she's not interested.

188
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,425
What are you talking about?
I never tried to hook up with her.

189
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,476
She's always trying to fuck me,
and I have to avoid it at all costs,

190
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,678
out of respect for you.

191
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,681
I just thought she looked
really good in those pants.

192
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,732
- Jesus.
- Thought that was a nice thing to say.

193
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,776
I didn't know I'd get metoo'd for it.

194
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,899
Dad's suits are vacuum-sealed
in the garage.

195
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,901
- Yeah?
- Just pick yourself a nice one.

196
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,072
You have to look nice.

197
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,526
We're celebrating
your sister's achievements.

198
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,612
You're gonna miss her when she's gone.

199
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,788
Yeah. Celebrate me.

200
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,784
Wow, this all happened so fast.

201
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,991
I can't believe
you're graduating already.

202
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,336
I'm gonna really miss you.

203
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,219
Round two. Fight!

204
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,846
Yo, where'd you get this?
This shit does not taste very good.

205
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,936
What are you talking about?
This shit's fire, dawg.

206
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,263
Do you guys even really get
high anymore?

207
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,100
I don't really think I get high anymore.
I think I just kind of am myself.

208
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,312
I haven't been high in a while, man.
But I still do it.

209
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,896
I like the lifestyle.

210
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,944
I'm mad high.

211
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,235
Yo, tell Scotty about
how you're being catfished.

212
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,365
- Who?
- You!

213
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,496
How you're being catfished, bro.
Tell him the truth.

214
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,821
You got a girlfriend? What's up?

215
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,876
No. Yeah.

216
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
That's awesome. Yes.

217
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,169
Her name is Carla. We talk on the phone.

218
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,168
Nah, dude, this girl slid into his dms,

219
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,591
and I don't know,
she asked him out or whatever.

220
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,168
But hundred percent a trick, dude.

221
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,033
- She's bad, but that's not yours.
- Why?

222
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,049
- And she's so hot, dude.
- She hangs out on yachts.

223
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,724
- Like, yo.
- Oh, come on.

224
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,893
- No, no, like, no. It's not real.
- Dude...

225
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,380
Bro, they're just being jealous
'cause you're getting that...

226
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,108
Oh, yeah, that's a catfish. You getting
catfished like a motherfucker!

227
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,480
Oh, my god!

228
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,107
- Bro.
- What does she...

229
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,405
Straight up,
I'm-a send myself this one, honestly.

230
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,108
Honestly, dude, she's fucking fake.

231
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,283
She thinks I'm hot.

232
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,112
How? You guys never even
seen each other.

233
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,202
How come you guys don't facetime?
Tell Scotty why you don't facetime.

234
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,035
Her phone camera's broken,
but she sent me all these photos.

235
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,732
- Yeah.
- Bro, these are Google images.

236
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,275
- Exactly, dude.
- You don't know that.

237
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,338
Maybe this girl is into Igor.
You know, he's cute.

238
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,885
You don't even know
how to talk to girls.

239
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,463
What do you even talk to her about?

240
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,549
- Igor.
- Hmm?

241
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,760
Go get that shit, bro.
What are you doing?

242
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,563
- Yo, he is the worst assistant.
- He's clearly going through a lot.

243
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,858
How much for six Xanax? Six.

244
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,981
What do we have? What do we have?

245
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,108
Who needs six Xanax”?

246
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,281
I got three right here, I think.

247
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,859
One, two... is this a... yeah.

248
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,651
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

249
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,075
You're Jimmy bags' brother, right?

250
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,699
Yes, bro.

251
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,957
Tell your brother he's a bitch.

252
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,254
You understand that? Yeah. I do.

253
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,457
- Say it back to me.
- He's a bitch. He's a bitch.

254
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,964
And now, you know what?

255
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,635
I got four, but you're paying for six.

256
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,367
Nah, come on.
That's my fucking brother, bro.

257
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,847
- What are you...
- Nah. Nah, dude.

258
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,014
I hate your brother.

259
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,933
And you look like
a little version of him,

260
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,511
and I want to punch you in the face.

261
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,812
So, instead of doing that,
just give me 60.

262
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,266
- I only got 40.
- Then go home, do chores, and come back.

263
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,641
- I don't give a fuck.
- I can't.

264
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,153
I stole it from my mom's purse,
but she only had 40.

265
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,822
Well, then, give me your shoes.

266
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,115
No, bro, I can't.

267
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,513
Just give me your shoes
and we'll call it a day.

268
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,074
- Hey, what size are you?
- A nine.

269
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,165
Those'll fit you.

270
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,768
- Igor, you can have those.
- I'll take 'em.

271
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,992
Look at that. Igor got a gift.

272
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,705
- He's not a fucking nine.
- Fuck you!

273
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,856
You don't make fun of my friend!

274
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,066
He can't get on fucking roller coasters,
he's that small.

275
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,751
Shut the fuck up!
We make fun of him!

276
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,002
You don't make fun of him!

277
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,334
He's our friend.
He rides roller coasters all the time.

278
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,090
We make fun of him, not you.

279
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,591
He's a size five, bro, like...

280
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,890
Yo! Stop!
Get the fuck away from my window.

281
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,763
You guys are a bunch of fucking pussies.

282
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,436
Mom, he's saying he's gonna wear
these cargo shorts to the party.

283
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,523
Oh, no.

284
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,395
What? I told you to wear dad's suit.

285
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,963
I don't want to wear dad's old suit,
okay?

286
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,898
- I have my own personal style.
- Get off me!

287
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,901
- Don't do that!
- 1/ don't want fo wear a suit, okay?

288
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,903
I think I'm gonna throw up.

289
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,404
I think I have the flu.

290
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,705
Okay. Just breathe through your nose.
One second.

291
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,330
Shut up. Mom, he looks like
he fucking sells crack under a bridge.

292
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,503
I know the guy who sells crack
under the bridge, and he looks awesome.

293
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,831
Just put on the suit, Scott, please.

294
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,963
No! It's not fair! She thinks
she's Princess of the world...

295
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,948
Then just please be respectful
for two fucking seconds!

296
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,325
Because she graduated high school.

297
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,759
Everybody graduates high school!

298
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,056
- Shut up!
- Scott!

299
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,758
J» oh, she's a jolly good fellow »

300
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,344
- mom, please...
- Just put on the suit.

301
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,680
Be respectful. I'll be home in an hour.

302
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,890
Fine'

303
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:03,944
thank you.

304
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,062
How are you feeling?

305
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,025
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,329
I tried to warn you,
but you were on the phone.

307
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,119
Thanks for letting me use your phone.

308
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,701
My family has problems, too.

309
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,461
I love this house.

310
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,418
If you have money, why would you
ever live in staten island?

311
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,511
- Oh, god. Yeah.
- So good.

312
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,595
We are so proud of our daughter joanne.

313
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,898
And Claire, who's been at our house
so much over the years

314
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,345
you feel like our second daughter.

315
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:49,316
Thank you, Margie,
for lending her to us all these years.

316
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:54,618
You guys have worked so hard,
and we are so, so proud of you.

317
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,037
Jesus Christ, dial it back,
you fucking fruits.

318
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,241
Joanne, you are a very special girl.

319
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,959
You made our dreams come true, too.

320
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,128
- You're my sweet angel.
- No, she's not.

321
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,581
Such an honor to be your parents.

322
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,133
You've taught us
as much as we've taught you. Claire...

323
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,462
You've been through
so much, and you've done so well,

324
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,597
so much better than any of us
could have handled it.

325
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,180
Your dad Stan would be so proud of you.
He's looking down at you right now.

326
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,351
Yes, he is.

327
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,770
No, he's not.

328
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,939
A toast to joanne and Claire.

329
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,106
So proud.

330
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,359
Congratulations!

331
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,653

have to take your bitch »

334

- what's up, Todd?
- What's up, Scott?

335
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,433
You going to college, too, someday?

336
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,197
I'd like to, yeah. Study law.

337
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,702
Oh, yeah? That's awesome, man.

338
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,704
That sounds really cool.
Do you have any weed?

339
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,331
- I do.
- Could I have some?

340
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,462
- Definitely. I'll go grab it.
- Cool. Thanks, Todd.

341
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,423
Fucking home run, Todd.

342
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,756
It makes me sad

343
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,014
to think of my little sister
sitting in that sad little house,

344
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,840
waiting for her son to be perfect.

345
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,096
I'm not.

346
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,017
Then you're wasting all of this.
All of it's getting wasted.

347
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,185
You're a mess. You're wasted.

348
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,713
- Mom would be disappointed in you.
- You're the one who's always wasted.

349
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,274
You're wasting.
It's like leaving food on the table.

350
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,987
- Come on. Let me take you out.
- It's so hard to meet people.

351
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,488
I'm totally open.

352
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,115
You're not open at all.

353
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,642
It's really hard to meet people.
You're a liar.

354
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,185
You're not open. "Hard to meet people"?

355
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,478
I'm in the er. All I see is, like...

356
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,288
You meet a hundred people a night.

357
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,837
Yeah, they're shot.
They're... they're criminals.

358
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,443
- Stop limiting yourself.
- Who am I gonna meet?

359
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,362
- Stop limiting yourself.
- But I'm at the hospital.

360
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,503
Yeah. They're not all criminals.
Some of them are victims.

361
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,306
Doll...

362
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,592
We could put you on two shifts a week,
just to try it.

363
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,269
I don't need a job.
I got a contact at a tattoo shop.

364
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,916
I'm hoping for an apprenticeship, so...

365
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,598
Then you're gonna need some money.

366
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,309
Some of these guys
walk away with 80 bucks in tips.

367
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,736
Your cousin's offering you a job.
Consider it, okay?

368
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,814
If you're good at it,
you can become a waiter.

369
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,773
Why are you offering me a job anyway?

370
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,243
Because I told your father
I'd always look out for you.

371
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,743
How? He died suddenly in a fire.
Did you ask his ghost?

372
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,325
That's not witty, Scott.

373
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,331
Your dark sense of humor
doesn't work for me.

374
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,582
I find it funny.

375
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,039
It's your sister's big day.
Be a gentleman.

376
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,676
Okay, we lost a few guys in an ice raid.

377
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,344
Oh, shit. Sorry.

378
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,340
Maybe you should work and go to college.

379
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,892
- College is bullshit!
- Oh!

380
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,516
You know who went to Harvard?
The unabomber.

381
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,939
You know who went to temple? Bill cosby.

382
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,392
You know who else who went to temple?
Ted Bundy.

383
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,569
You know who went to hofstra?
Bernie madoff.

384
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,240
You know who went to wharton?
Donald Trump. It's all a scam.

385
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,073
Okay, well, maybe I shouldn't go, then.

386
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,576
Oh, no,
you'll have the time of your life.

387
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,831
Hey, Scott.

388
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,663
Sit down.

389
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,040
Okay.

390
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,131
I got you this.

391
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,972
So, what is... what is this?

392
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,099
It's paintbrushes and some paint.

393
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,560
I know you're into art,

394
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,972
so I thought you could
expand your horizons while I'm gone.

395
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,020
You got a gift receipt for this?

396
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,480
You okay?

397
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,440
Fine... yeah. What do you mean?

398
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,150
You gonna be okay without me here?

399
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,406
What, you don't think I can
survive here without you?

400
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,489
Okay, just don't be a dick, okay?

401
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,370
Be nice to mom, okay?
Don't give her a hard time.

402
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,577
- She deserves a break.
- I always give her a break.

403
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,835
When... when am I
gonna get my break? Like...

404
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,834
What are you talking about?
All anyone ever does is worry about you.

405
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,885
I was ignored my entire childhood
'cause of you.

406
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,258
Oh, yeah, I forgot that
my childhood was so dandy.

407
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,262
You don't get to act crazy your
whole life just 'cause dad died, okay?

408
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,497
At least you got to know him.

409
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,457
Well, you're lucky you didn't get to
know him, okay?

410
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,958
'Cause that's why you're almost normal.

411
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,669
If you got to know him,
you would've known that he was

412
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,604
the fucking coolest guy ever,

413
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,651
and that would've
ruined the rest of your life.

414
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,694
Okay, but what are you gonna do?

415
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,524
Are you gonna get a job
or are you gonna leave the house?

416
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,906
I don't know.
I'm gonna open that tattoo restaurant.

417
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,405
- No, for real.
- I am being real.

418
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,412
It's never been done before.
I looked it up. I googled it.

419
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,164
It's never been done,
not even as a joke.

420
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,587
Because no one wants
to go to a restaurant

421
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,666
and watch people get tattooed
while they eat. It's gross.

422
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,966
It's the best idea ever.

423
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,339
Ruby tattoosdays,
where everyone's welcome.

424
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,513
- Chicken and tattoos.
- That's not a business!

425
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,993
You know, you gotta
get your shit together.

426
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,632
Time is passing by very quickly.

427
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,265
That's why I smoke weed all the time.
It slows it all down.

428
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,600
Fucking...

429
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,894
I'm worried about you.

430
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,566
Why now? You never gave a shit.

431
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,735
You literally never cared
until this second.

432
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,359
What gives?
You never looked out for me once.

433
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,066
You're my older brother.
You're supposed to look out for me.

434
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,901
You're just guilty
'cause you're leaving?

435
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,406
Now you're afraid I'm gonna die?

436
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,488
I was gonna die anyway,
whether you stay or not.

437
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,952
- Are you gonna hurt yourself?
- Probably.

438
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,582
Yeah, I'm probably gonna hurt myself.
I don't know how, but yeah.

439
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,213
If anybody could do it, it's me.

440
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,712
This is why I don't talk to you,

441
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,886
'cause the one thing I know is you're
not gonna listen to my advice, so...

442
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,806
Yeah, well, why would I?
You don't even give a shit.

443
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,967
You're leaving.
You're not even part of the family.

444
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,770
I'm the only fucking normal person
in this family. Jesus. You know...

445
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,728
Every second I'm away from you,
I'm worrying about you.

446
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,103
That's what you do to people.

447
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,605
You should be worried.

448
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,737
Don't fucking ruin college for me, okay?

449
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,114
- Go!
- Fine.

450
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,638
Hey! You should bring
that chipper personality to college.

451
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,822
Guys'll love it.

452
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,871
Hello.

453
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,912
Okay, let's see my to-do list.

454
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,167
Yo, we're finished packing the car.

455
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,464
You want to come out
and say goodbye or...

456
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,466
Oh, well, yeah, this is almost over.

457
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,423
No, we're leaving.

458
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,735
- She's leaving?
- To go to college, you know?

459
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,331
- Oh, my bad.
- Yeah, four years, so...

460
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,640
- Oh, all right.
- Let's go.

461
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,272
Nope. Go. Come on.

462
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,441
Don't worry about me, okay?

463
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,519
This is really hard right now.

464
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,774
You don't seem fine.

465
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,948
I'm so proud of you.

466
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,695
I love you.

467
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,371
Oh. Okay.

468
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,666
You're the light of my life.

469
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,289
Okay.

470
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,423
Thanks for helping us pack the car.

471
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,594
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you guys were done already.

472
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,141
Be nice to mom.
And please respond to my texts.

473
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,010
I will. Don't worry about it.

474
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,393
And... I'll come visit you
at some point.

475
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,934
Okay. All right.

476
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,359
Yeah.

477
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,811
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

478
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,865
Fly.

479
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,597
Hey, uh...

480
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,810
I was thinking of finally
seeing that game of thrones.

481
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,232
Should I binge it?

482
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,107
It's a pretty violent show.
You sure you could watch that?

483
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,731
I work in an emergency room.

484
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,825
Right, yeah.

485
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,326
So, you could probably handle
a good pillage. Yeah.

486
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,701
Okay, well,
maybe I'll start watching it.

487
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,991
- Yeah.
- You watch it with me?

488
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,377
Um, well, I actually just kind of
finished it, so I don't...

489
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,001
It's really fresh in my mind,
so I would probably...

490
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,831
- Okay.
- I can watch some of them.

491
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,927
I don't think I can watch
all of them again, but...

492
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,427
- I'll see you later, then.
- All right.

493
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,015
Are you okay?

494
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,511
Um... yeah?

495
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:05,145
It's okay. I'm here.

496
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,814
I'm here. Don't worry about it.

497
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,860
You know, she's only 45 minutes away,

498
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,613
and she'll probably call
in five minutes.

499
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,743
But, hey. You still got me, right?

500
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,700
Yeah.

501
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,999
Oh, shit. Hey!

502
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,134
See, you got to hold it like this.

503
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,758
Let's see. Oh!

504
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,386
Oh, yeah!

505
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,973
Hey, hey, wait. Hey, hey, guys.
Look, look.

506
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,731
- You can't be here, man. You got to go.
- Why?

507
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,230
It's private property, that's why.

508
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,356
It's an abandoned orphanage.
Why can't we be here?

509
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,403
Who gives a shit, man?
What are you doing here?

510
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,527
You fucking protecting
the ghosts of dead orphans?

511
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,531
Look, fat kanye, shut your damn mouth.

512
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,612
I'll be back in five minutes
for you assholes.

513
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,323
If you're still here,
I'm calling the cops, period.

514
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,578
You better get the cops, man,
'cause you're a fake cop.

515
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,995
- You need the real ones.
- Motherfuckers. Fuck all of y'all.

516
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,126
I feel bad. We were a little too mean.

517
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,548
- Yeah.
- He's nice.

518
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,875
Yeah, he's a really good guy.

519
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,839
See, that guy... that is what
is wrong with staten island.

520
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,800
We don't get any cool people
from any of the other boroughs.

521
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,307
No one comes here. We're stuck
with the fucking pricks that live here.

522
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,231
You're talking about us.
Right in front of us.

523
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,433
Yeah, kinda. I mean, no one comes here.

524
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,769
There's no flow of people.
That guy's, like, 200.

525
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,174
We've known him since we were six.

526
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,984
Why can't we be cool like Brooklyn?

527
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,095
There's no reason
we shouldn't be cool like Brooklyn.

528
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,485
We got amazing views.
It's close to the city.

529
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,741
It's cheap. Nice people.
It makes no sense.

530
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,198
We're the only place
that New Jersey looks down on.

531
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,534
You could see the garbage dump
from space.

532
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,038
This place is never gonna change.

533
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,792
No, it happened to
the meatpacking district, the village.

534
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,966
Brooklyn used to be a fucking shithole.
We are next.

535
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,634
I'm gonna take my civil service test.

536
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,837
I'm gonna work in the city,
in city planning.

537
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,618
You watch. This place is gonna be like
fucking williamsburg in ten years.

538
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,507
No, all right? No. Nobody wants that.

539
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,664
Why do you want to work in the city
and do city planning?

540
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,803
That sounds so boring.

541
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,308
I feel like Brooklyn is better.

542
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,641
I dated a guy that lived in Brooklyn.
He was a mixologist.

543
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,601
He made ice cubes out of milk.

544
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,812
- He was so classy.
- Shut up!

545
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,990
I love staten island. It's amazing.

546
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,033
And people are gonna see it soon.
Trust me.

547
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,953
Well, if you love it so much,
why don't you let me tattoo it on you?

548
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,956
- I'm not gonna let you tattoo me again.
- Fine.

549
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,624
Well, I need somebody to tattoo.
I'm running out of...

550
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,276
- Come on, rich, what about you, man?
- Don't even look at me, dude.

551
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,916
Why?
Your work is mad inconsistent.

552
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,418
Obama ain't right.

553
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,050
- I got the eyes wrong, okay?
- He's not right.

554
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,176
All right, man, this hurt me.

555
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,725
I don't have any black friends anymore.
I can't go to a barbershop no more.

556
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:49,021
You got Obama wrong.
Ain't nothing worse than that.

557
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,919
What about you, Igor?
You want a dragon or something?

558
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,433
Oh, I love your tattoos.

559
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,734
My brother?

560
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,381
- It's the spitting image.
- Yeah.

561
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,896
It's my favorite.
No, this is my favorite.

562
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,511
- Oh, you killed that.
- Yeah, I really worked hard on the eyes.

563
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,901
He's so cute. I love his butthole.

564
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,611
It reminds me
that I have a belly button.

565
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,621
- So, I'm good.
- Yeah, I got to go.

566
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,165
Watching you beg
to give tattoos is too sad.

567
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,044
And that's freaking me out.

568
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,879
We're almost done. Almost.

569
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,003
All right. You're all done.

570
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,258
That looks really good.

571
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,136
Yeah, I mean, I wish you'd let me do
something cooler, but yeah.

572
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,888
Oh, fuck no. That hurts so bad.

573
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,957
- Another dumb tattoo.
- Yeah, but I like the pain.

574
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,643
The pain is the whole point
of getting tattoos.

575
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,211
Don't you just love
when you're getting tattooed,

576
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,102
and it hits the bone and pinches
a nerve, and you're like...

577
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,936
I'm not a fan of the pain.

578
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,613
You shouldn't let him do it to you.
He's inconsistent.

579
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,612
I think that tattoo's dumb.

580
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,583
Y'all should've told me
when you saw the design.

581
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,283
It says, "unfollow me."
You don't even have that many followers.

582
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,623
- Carla follows me.
- Bro, she's imaginary.

583
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,451
- Carla not real.
- Carla's not real, dude.

584
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,457
How many times
do we have to say this?

585
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,788
She's not real.

586
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,965
I hate bugs, dawg. I'm a gangster!

587
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,589
- No, that's a bee, bro!
- There's a kid down there.

588
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,088
Yo, kid!

589
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,048
- What's up?
- Oh, shit, there is a kid.

590
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,679
What are you doing?

591
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,727
You hanging out on the beach?
Come here. Don't be shy.

592
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,770
No stranger danger here.
I'm not gonna touch you.

593
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,419
- What's up, pal?
- What are you doing?

594
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,603
I'm looking for my friend.

595
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,559
"Looking for my friend."

596
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,519
You want to be friends with us?

597
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,822
We're the good guys, right?

598
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,803
- You can hang out with us, pal.
- Let me get some of that.

599
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,033
Put it right there.

600
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,194
Ho!

601
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,247
You gang. Part of the gang.

602
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,414
Gang.

603
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,703
What's that?

604
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,331
It's a tattoo gun.
I was giving the homeys tattoos.

605
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,538
I want a tattoo.

606
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,585
You're a tough guy?

607
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,917
Sure, young guy. You want a tattoo?
Yeah.

608
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,219
Dude, kid wants a tattoo.
That's my guy right there.

609
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,672
Bro, you can't give him a tattoo.
He's a little kid.

610
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,134
Bro, I got to practice on something.
He seems old enough.

611
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,890
You a tough guy? Yeah.

612
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,471
You a badass.
Come on, show those muscles, kid.

613
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,519
Come on. Both arms, both arms.

614
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,271
You got tickets to the gun show?

615
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,102
- There it is.
- There we go.

616
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,653
- What's your name?
- Harold.

617
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,775
I'm-a call you Harry.

618
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,356
Don't. It's Harold.

619
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,067
- Oh!
- Okay. Hell yeah.

620
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,075
I like this kid. I need him in my life.
He has structure.

621
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,492
Guys, I don't think that's a good idea.

622
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,043
I mean... we don't listen
to anything you say.

623
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,416
Yeah, I mean,
why do you even try to give us advice?

624
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,544
So, what do you want a tattoo of?

625
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,545
The punisher.

626
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,251
- The punisher?
- Okay.

627
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,052
- That's tough, man.
- All right.

628
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,346
He could've said anything.
He said the punisher.

629
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,683
- Oh, yeah, I could do that. Is that it?
- Yeah, that's him.

630
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,852
Are you sure? Yes.

631
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,688
Do I have your legal permission
to do this?

632
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,849
- Yes.
- That's good enough for me.

633
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,463
- How about you guys?
- Holds up in court.

634
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,944
- You guys heard it.
- Yo, he can't get consent. He's ten.

635
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,444
Now, hold still, okay?
'Cause it is permanent.

636
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,117
Yo, guys. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

637
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,890
- Put your game face on.
- Don't worry, dude.

638
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,155
This will just be on you
for the rest of your life.

639
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,076
There you go.
Look at you, tough guy.

640
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,231
There you go.

641
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,916
I don't want to do it!
I don't wanna!

642
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,123
Well, I gotta finish it.
Now there's just a line.

643
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,755
You're gonna look stupid.
Sit back down. Relax. Relax.

644
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,073
- Whoa! Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

645
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,803
- Hey, run! Run, kid!
- Hey!

646
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,675
Run, little man! Run! Run!

647
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,009
Goddamn it.

648
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,435
I fucking believed in that kid, man.

649
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,606
He seemed so tough at first,
but then immediately he wasn't.

650
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,533
That's why I don't fuck
with millennials, dude.

651
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,778
Again, we are the millennials.

652
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,025
He keeps saying that,
but I don't know what that means.

653
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,240
I regret my friendship with you guys.

654
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,359
Yeah, hello. My name's Raymond bishop.

655
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,669
This is my son, Harold.
Say hello, Harold.

656
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,796
I'm sorry.

657
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,013
What's going on?

658
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,576
Well, it seems your son was in the woods
giving out free tattoos,

659
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,511
and my son was one of his victims.

660
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,092
Well, I don't understand.

661
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,678
How do you know it was my son?
How'd you get this address?

662
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,934
I have my ways.
Believe me, I have my ways.

663
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:00,935
Are you a cop?

664
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,108
No, I'm a fireman, okay?
I work for a living.

665
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,915
Look at this. Do you believe this?
You see that there? See that line?

666
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,939
I don't know if you burn these off
or what, but we're taking care of this

667
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,511
and you're paying for it,
you understand me?

668
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,742
- I don't know what this is.
- Scott!

669
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,411
I am... I'm so sorry.

670
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,353
There's an aesthetic laser
at the hospital where I work,

671
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,038
and it can completely remove it.

672
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,995
I get a discount.
I'm gonna pay for the whole thing.

673
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,001
I don't know what I'm saying.
I feel terrible.

674
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,003
You should feel terrible! Look at that!

675
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,630
What's up? Oh, fuck.

676
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,427
- There he is. You get your ass out here!
- Hey! He said he was 18.

677
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,972
He looks like he's four,
you fucking moron! Sorry.

678
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,970
- He consented!
- He's lying.

679
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,767
- Harold, come on!
- Course he's lying!

680
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,810
You can't have consent!
He's nine years old!

681
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,684
Dad, let's go. You're embarrassing me.

682
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,106
We're not going anywhere, okay?

683
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,088
He's just a little kid!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

684
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,821
He was roaming around in the woods.
He wanted a tattoo. Where were you?

685
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,818
- I was at fucking work!
- Fuck you!

686
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,720
Come out here! If I was you,
I'd shut your fucking mouth.

687
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,014
Because I can call the cops right now
and have your ass thrown in jail.

688
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,868
For what?

689
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,076
For sticking needles in a kid's arm,
you fucking dope!

690
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,036
Did you even raise him?
Did you even raise him?

691
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,118
There's no reason to call the cops.

692
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,204
I can handle this
and I can also handle disciplining him.

693
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,527
Well, clearly you can't
or you wouldn't have a middle-aged son

694
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,543
still living at home,
tattooing minors against their will!

695
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,252
I asked him to do it.

696
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,866
- It's not his fault.
- That's right. That's my man.

697
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,630
Go wait in the car. Harold, go on.

698
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,912
And don't raise your voice
at me, either.

699
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,936
Later, Harold.

700
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,844
Don't say goodbye to my kid.
Look both ways.

701
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,645
- Look both ways!
- Go to your room.

702
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,188
- I am!
- Watch your mouth.

703
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,608
For your information,
I am not a middle-aged man.

704
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,232
I'm a 24-year-old man,
and I'm going to my room

705
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,937
'cause I fucking want to.

706
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,821
What kind of fucking animal
are you raising in this house, huh?

707
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,223
I'm bringing you the bill.
I don't care what it costs, all right?

708
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,933
I mean, what the fuck
is going on around here?

709
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,243
All right.
Just give me a day to arrange the laser.

710
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,744
All right. You know something?

711
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,748
Is his father home? Where's his dad?
I don't want to fucking yell at you.

712
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,045
He's deceased.

713
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:49,717
Oh.

714
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,379
Well...

715
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,961
I'm sorry for your loss.

716
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,075
I'm sure if he was still around,

717
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,681
he would agree
that you should still pay for it.

718
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,729
Comically huge mustache.

719
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,215
- Is this what he looked like?
- That's exactly what he looked like.

720
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,446
You're scared of me. Yeah.

721
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,648
Yo, and that's not funny.

722
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,483
He burst into the door,
started screaming,

723
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,498
and his mustache
was flapping all over the place.

724
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,491
- Flapping.
- He looked the monopoly man.

725
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,698
It was terrifying.

726
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,284
"Look both ways! Look both ways!"

727
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,332
- Fucking maniac.
- But I will say,

728
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,003
probably not a good idea
to tattoo children in the woods.

729
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,779
- Yeah, probably.
- You could get in trouble.

730
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,281
- Yeah, you could.
- Why did you do that?

731
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,296
I don't know.
I thought I would get away with it.

732
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,722
Plus, I thought he was at least 15,
you know?

733
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,370
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I got my first tattoo...

734
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,259
- How old was he?
- Nine.

735
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,688
You thought he was 157
maybe you've been smoking too much.

736
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,015
I think I'm just stupid.

737
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,729
You should've seen my mom, though.
It's so weird since my sister left.

738
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,404
She's just crying all the time

739
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,512
and she's trying to talk to me
and hang out with me.

740
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,222
The other day, she asked me
to go to nordstrom rack.

741
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,326
I almost slit my throat.

742
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,074
Did you go?

743
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,746
No. I pretended to be asleep.

744
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,451
Oh, come on. Maybe she needs company.
She's lonely without your sister.

745
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,169
Yeah, she's... she's gonna be lonely.

746
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,527
I mean, you should've seen her
at my sister's send-off party.

747
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,212
It was really weird.

748
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,136
There was a party?

749
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,805
- Yeah.
- Why wasn't I invited?

750
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,558
- To a high school graduation party?
- Well, who was there?

751
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:30,016
It was just family and... shit.

752
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,271
You don't want me
to be around your family?

753
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,774
- I've known them since I was ten.
- Well, yeah, I just...

754
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,448
I didn't think it was something
you would want to go to. I'm sorry.

755
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,402
- Come on, that's fucked up.
- Why? Why is that fucked up?

756
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:46,240
Because we're, you know,
doing something here.

757
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,541
- Are we doing something here?
- We're starting a thing.

758
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,335
I mean, we're having sex
and we're hanging out a lot.

759
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,540
I thought it was just
more casual than that.

760
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,632
You know?

761
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,424
You don't want me to go
to any life events?

762
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,346
Life... what's a life event?

763
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,516
What does that even mean?

764
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,681
You know what? It's fine.

765
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,891
- What?
- No, it's fine.

766
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,819
Come back. I'm sor... wait.

767
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,403
You know what? You're right.

768
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,212
What are you talking about?
I'm never right.

769
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,126
No, you're right.
We shouldn't do this anymore.

770
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,154
I don't want to do this anymore.

771
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,601
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

772
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,411
It was all a mistake. It was a mistake.

773
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,461
But it's fine. We're on the same page.
We'll go back to what it was before.

774
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,460
I'll treat you like I do
Oscar and Richie.

775
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,130
It's not even that.
I don't know what I want yet.

776
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,403
I'm trying to figure my shit out.

777
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,383
And you should. Please do.
Figure your shit out.

778
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,304
But we're not gonna have sex anymore,
okay? I got to go.

779
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,845
I should've invited you to the party!

780
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,767
I didn't know it was a life event!

781
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:54,065
Uh, oh, I already arranged
to pay directly at the hospital.

782
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,187
But if you want a check,

783
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,881
- just give me two minutes, okay”?
- Oh, no. No. No.

784
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,191
I want to pay. I'm gonna pay for it.
I'm gonna pay for it.

785
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,490
No, I'm gonna pay for it.
And I'm also gonna talk to Scott.

786
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,989
Because that was totally out of line.
Totally nuts.

787
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,661
Yeah, I understand that.

788
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,206
But, look,
I just wanted to apologize, okay?

789
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,500
I got a little out of control before.

790
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,124
You know,
I let my anger get the best of me.

791
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,131
Broke my stupid resolution.

792
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,504
God knows it's what
messed up my marriage,

793
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,506
and I just really wanted
to apologize, okay?

794
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,464
I mean, I was upset, but I
shouldn't have conveyed it that way.

795
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,718
There's no need to apologize.

796
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,804
My kid's being a fucking lunatic.
It's not cool.

797
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,432
Uh, I overreacted. He's fine.

798
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,391
No, it's the tip of the iceberg.

799
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,391
Uh, you know,
lot of kids do stuff like this.

800
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,522
Kids don't do stuff like this.

801
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,173
He did the second-worst thing
you could do to a kid in the woods.

802
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,947
Well, either way, I shouldn't
have behaved the way I behaved.

803
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,574
So, I'm truly sorry.

804
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,491
Apology accepted. It's nice.
Don't get many of those around here.

805
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,419
- Thanks.
- Hey, this might seem a little crazy...

806
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,581
But can I take you out
for a cup of coffee?

807
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,301
So, Scott did this.

808
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,299
Oh. Is that a cocker spaniel?

809
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,723
No. No, that's my daughter.
That's Claire.

810
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,017
Oh, yeah, yeah. I can...

811
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,832
- Yeah, I just thought those were ears.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

812
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,346
That's her hair. Okay, yep.

813
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,558
Scott got his first tattoo
when he was 16.

814
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,608
- Oh, okay.
- It was of Kermit the frog.

815
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,482
Oh.

816
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,155
- That's kind of cute.
- Yeah, yeah.

817
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,654
Kermit smoking a joint, so...

818
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,360
Kermit smoking a joint?

819
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,992
Jeez, I don't remember that episode
on sesame street, huh?

820
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,082
- That's kind of funny. He's a funny kid?
- Oh, he's so funny.

821
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,376
- Yeah?
- Oh, he's so funny.

822
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,375
- You think he's gonna stick it out?
- Well, that I don't know.

823
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:43,880
I sent him to art school, but he quit.
He couldn't really focus 'cause...

824
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,886
He also has add, so he...

825
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,723
Anyway, he's a tattoo artist with add.

826
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,456
Well, all the guys
down at the firehouse,

827
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,311
they all have tattoos and stuff.

828
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,639
Personally, I never got one, though.

829
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,067
Not that I have anything against them.
I just always felt I was too pasty.

830
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,279
So, the firehouse, huh? Yeah.

831
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,323
- The old firehouse.
- Mmm-hmm.

832
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,025
The old firehouse. Yeah.

833
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,032
So, you're a ladder or engine?

834
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,204
- Ladder.
- Knew it.

835
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,116
You got firefighters in your family?

836
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,497
Yeah, my husband.

837
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,583
Oh, jeez. Sorry. Yeah.

838
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,833
Forgot.

839
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,793
Hey, uh, I hope this isn't too forward,

840
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,379
but do you mind
if I ask what happened to your husband?

841
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,013
It was a hotel fire. The roof collapsed.

842
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,434
He went in to save somebody.

843
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:39,640
They told him it wasn't safe,
but, you know, he was like that.

844
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,607
Wait, Stan carlin was your husband?
Paramount hotel fire?

845
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,607
Did you know him?

846
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,563
- Or you heard...
- No, no, no, I...

847
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,944
Hung out with him or...

848
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,777
No, I just heard about him.
He was a real brave guy.

849
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,701
Yeah.

850
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,950
He was kind of a legend,
to be honest with you.

851
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,874
Yeah. Yeah.

852
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,623
And Scott was only seven
when it happened, so...

853
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,954
- That's tough.
- A lot of consequences.

854
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,085
Yeah, that's a tough situation.
Yeah.

855
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,918
But I got to tell you,
you did a great job, you know.

856
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,423
I know we had a little bit of
a difference there, but he's a good kid.

857
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:17,136
And if the worst he's doing is
a couple unlawful tattoos,

858
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,095
- you did a hell of a job.
- Yeah.

859
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,390
Yeah, I don't think
that's the worst he's doing, though.

860
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,435
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't know. You know...

861
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,730
That's how kids are, you know?

862
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,239
Everybody gets it at a different time.

863
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,861
Anyways, I'm just sitting here,
doing all the talking here.

864
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,195
What do you do?

865
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,073
I'm a nurse. I'm a school nurse.

866
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,078
I'm also an er nurse.

867
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,002
- You work in the er?
- Mmm-hmm.

868
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,705
Jesus Christ, Margie,
we probably met each other.

869
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,423
Could be.

870
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,750
So, how you doing?

871
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:52,337
I'm... very tired.

872
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,014
Really? Well, you don't look tired.

873
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,466
No, seriously, you look great.

874
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,926
Really? Yeah.

875
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:02,264
I just don't, like...
I mean, are you flirting with me or...

876
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,019
Yeah. Yeah?

877
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,964
- Yeah, a lot. This is what it looks like.
- It is really subtle.

878
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,445
I couldn't...
I can't tell what's going on.

879
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,195
- This is how it looks. I'm very subtle.
- All right. I'm rusty. You're subtle.

880
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,902
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

881
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,143
I see you out there, man.
You're doing great.

882
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,579
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Have a good time.

883
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,160
The more fun you have,
the more fun the customers have.

884
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,707
All right, thanks.

885
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,462
Hey, busboy,
why is table 12 still dirty?

886
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,886
Oh, 'cause they were talking.
I didn't think I should interrupt them.

887
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,409
Interrupt them. Get them out of here.

888
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,593
- All right.
- Do your job.

889
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,925
- Sorry.
- Take it easy there, brother.

890
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,351
- My bad.
- Jesus.

891
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,972
Uh, hi.
Are you done enjoying your meal?

892
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,482
There is food in my mouth,
and I am chewing.

893
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,184
Do you think that I'm finished?

894
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,715
I'm just holding this for my health?

895
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,070
- Get me some water.
- Sorry.

896
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,113
Hey, come here. Can we order?

897
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,720
- Uh, yeah. I'll go get your waiter.
- Whoa! No, no, no.

898
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,347
We don't have time for that.
We're in a hurry.

899
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,211
- I'm starving.
- Okay. Can I go?

900
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,017
Usually, the woman goes first,
but go ahead.

901
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,977
- Oh, yeah? How about I'm paying?
- All right.

902
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:06,745
Can I have a chicken parm
with meat sauce? No marinara.

903
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,330
Thin. Thin chicken parm.

904
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,756
Why aren't you writing it down?

905
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,835
Yeah, I can't actually
because I'm not a waiter.

906
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,216
I'm just a busboy,
so they don't even give me a pen.

907
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,218
Memorize it. Yeah.

908
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,095
Seafood pasta. That's what I want.

909
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,142
No clams, okay? Double up on the shrimp.

910
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,333
That's how I always get it.
We come here all the time.

911
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,598
I'm not gonna remember
a word you guys just said.

912
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,649
It's not rocket science.
Just go. Get our shit.

913
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,727
- All right.
- I'm starving.

914
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,321
- Is there a dance party or something?
- It's fight night.

915
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,950
All right, fight night!
Tournament of champions!

916
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,534
Fighting for tips.

917
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,811
Who's going? Who's going first?

918
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,416
- I, zoots.
- Z0oots.

919
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,336
- Everyone fights for their tips.
- The tips that we earn?

920
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,335
Yeah, but you have to
fight for them now.

921
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,503
Who wants some, huh?

922
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,293
- Who got it?
- It's you, bro.

923
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,299
- No way. No, no way.
- Put the gloves on.

924
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,971
Get in there. Get in there. Hit him.

925
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,798
- Hey, yo.
- Hey.

926
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,912
I don't... please, I don't want
to do this. Let's just not do it.

927
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,890
You don't wanna do this?

928
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,583
- What do you mean?
- 'Cause we're friends, right?

929
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,349
Yeah, no, for the next 15 seconds,
this friendship is over, son.

930
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,685
Understand that? Huh?
“What? What?

931
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,298
Got to understand, fighting is serious.

932
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,602
- I don't like it.
- It's sacred.

933
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,739
It's how I tribute my lord and savior.
“What?

934
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,782
It's the way I tribute
my lord and savior, Jesus.

935
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,056
I don't think Jesus would want you
to kick my ass right now.

936
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,850
He would want me to have these tips,
that's what he means.

937
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,435
You can have the tips. I don't want 'em.

938
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,495
- What is this? What's this shit?
- I don't know.

939
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,076
I've seen creed a couple times.

940
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,332
- What'd you do?
- I seen creed a couple times.

941
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,734
Are we about to do the coffon-eyed Joe?

942
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:32,838
Yeah. Yeah.

943
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,132
- Come on, son.
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.

944
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,131
You gonna come this way?
Come this way, boy. Take your shot.

945
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,382
- Go ahead.
- For real?

946
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,884
Yeah. Come on!

947
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:45,969
Now we are friends, goddamn it!

948
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,147
Take that shit. Yeah!

949
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,021
We friends now, nigga,
'cause that's what friends are for.

950
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,693

00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,788
Come here.

955
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,252
Let me just...

956
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,077
- Just want to get this sweater off.
- Okay.

957
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,932
And I want to turn off this light.

958
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,338
Let me turn it off.

959
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,549
- Okay.
- Come on.

960
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,097
Just one second.
Let me turn off this light.

961
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,349
Got a lot of lamps, huh?

962
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,098
It's like a store or something.

963
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,183
Come here.

964

980
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,410
Come sit down.
I need to talk to you about something.

981
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,704
What's up? Someone die?

982
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,330
No, no, nobody's dead.
Thank god.

983
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,999
I'm seeing somebody.

984
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,710
What does that mean?

985
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,382
I'm seeing a man.

986
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,711
Well, I've been dating someone
for a little while now.

987
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,216
You're dating someone?

988
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,677
That's awesome.

989
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,929
Why are you dating him secretly,
you little slut?

990
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,684
Why didn't you tell me?
Is he really, really old?

991
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,414
Or is he really, really young?
Is it one of my friends? Is it Igor?

992
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,352
No, no, no. I just...

993
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:03,156
I just didn't want to bother you
unless it was really serious.

994
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,527
Bother? You're my mom.

995
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,139
I hope you're getting banged out
real good. Who's the lucky guy?

996
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,237
Uh, it's...

997
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,784
It's ray.

998
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,783
Who's ray?

999
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,711
Remember the kid you tattooed?
His father.

1000
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,205
That fucking prick?

1001
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,134
Yeah, I know. He's a really nice man,
and he's really good to me.

1002
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,131
And he's a fireman.

1003
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,089
He's a fireman? That's fucked up.

1004
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,719
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

1005
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,393
You haven't dated anyone
in 17 years since dad,

1006
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,186
and the first guy you date is a fireman?

1007
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,127
- You don't think that's a little weird?
- I got nothing against firemen.

1008
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:41,019
Neither do I, but the guy doesn't
like me, and he has the same job as dad.

1009
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,484
I'm fucked up as it is, mom.
I have crohn's, okay?

1010
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,863
There's something wrong up here.
I can't find my watch!

1011
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,946
What are you trying to do to me here?
Haven't I been through enough?

1012
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,874
What did I do wrong? What did I do?
I'm sorry. What did I do?

1013
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,452
I'm not doing it to you.

1014
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,358
I just don't want to be alone
the rest of my life.

1015
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,124
I don't want you to be alone, either.
That would suck. But come on.

1016
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,381
This is pretty obvious
this is not a good choice, right?

1017
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,630
I would like us to have dinner. I...

1018
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,465
This is very, very important to me.

1019
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,723
I am in a serious relationship
with a very nice man.

1020
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,975
You're in a serious...
With that guy? Come on!

1021
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,899
You don't love him, do you?
You're not saying that, right?

1022
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,272
We don't use that word yet.

1023
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,570
But if he said it to me,
I would say it back.

1024
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,898
Oh, my god! Jesus!

1025
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,653
Do you not learn?

1026
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,568
Look what happened last time!

1027
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,809
- You want to do that again?
- Okay. All right? How about this?

1028
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,325
How about we come by the restaurant
and we have dinner when you're working

1029
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,412
and you just come by
and you just say hi a couple times?

1030
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,667
- How about that?
- How about that?

1031
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,670
How about...
Why don't you ask him, huh?

1032
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,574
Why don't you just build another shrine
to ray while you're at it?

1033
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,635
Right across from dad's
so they can be fucking pals!

1034
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,851
Yeah, I like that better.

1035
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,378
But I'm actually finding you funny
'cause you're really funny.

1036
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,771
Look at this guy.
Having the time of his life.

1037
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,148
- Mmm-hmm.
- Acting like he owns the place.

1038
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,026
I know that guy. Eggplant parmesan.

1039
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,492
Oh, I'll be.
Your moms is a bit of a baddie.

1040
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,577
She look post-coital.

1041
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,029
What's "post-coital"?

1042
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,519
It's like post-fucking,
but it's your mom, so I want to be nice.

1043
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,283
But, oh, it's definitely happening.

1044
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,461
Post-coital.

1045
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,886
If you ever come to see me,
it'll happen that night, I guarantee it.

1046
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,338
Oh, here he is.

1047
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,764
===

1048
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,037
- how you doing?
- Good. How are you?

1049
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,121
Good to see you again. Yeah.

1050
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,602
I'm really sorry for branding your kid.

1051
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,850
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

1052
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,149
Cost 350, but I didn't make
your mom pay for it.

1053
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,484
But, hey, no harm, no foul.

1054
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,532
You know, 'cause if that didn't happen,
I wouldn't have met this lovely lady.

1055
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,359
Well, happy to help.

1056
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,569
Things work out.

1057
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,205
Yeah. Thank god I did what I did, then.

1058
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,418
Uh, would you guys like to start
with still or sparkling water?

1059
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,399
- Oh, let's go sparkling.
- Spar... yeah.

1060
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,209
You like sparkling? Okay.

1061
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,278
- Can we get some more bread, too?
- Usually go still.

1062
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,862
Last time I came here, it came out hot.

1063
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,593
- Yeah.
- It was perfect.

1064
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,466
It's like my mom made it.

1065
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,593
Sure. Sparkling and hot bread.

1066
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,969
All right. Thanks, buddy.

1067
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,431
Oh, you just can't spit on that
like that, man.

1068
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,893
You got to be crafty.
You can't just... you gotta maneuver.

1069
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,228
Lick on it or put a boogie in it
or something.

1070
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,462
Think I can fit this whole thing
in my ass?

1071
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,323
If you really put your mind to it, bro.

1072
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,492
Hey, I saw him spit in the bread.

1073
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,581
All right, scorching hot bread.

1074
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,003
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

1075
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,830
Your mom's in the John. Have a seat.

1076
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,754
Don't worry.
You're not gonna get in trouble.

1077
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,051
Just for a minute.

1078
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,344
All right.

1079
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,758
So, how you liking the job here?

1080
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,260
It eats ass.

1081
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,728
I remember, back in the day,

1082
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,275
I used to work at that pizza parlor
on main street.

1083
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,523
You remember the one? Yeah.
I used to work down there.

1084
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,401
I loved it. Making the pizzas.

1085
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,030
Girls would come in.
It's like they just had to talk to me.

1086
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,281
Yeah.

1087
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:22,115
Well, that's awesome. I'm glad
you got laid a lot at your pizza place.

1088
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,836
All right. Listen, Scott.

1089
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,414
I know this is weird, okay?

1090
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,750
You and your mom
were alone together for a long time.

1091
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:37,259
You got set in your ways, you know?
You got used to things.

1092
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,557
But I just feel like
your mother deserves more right now.

1093
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,886
And I'm serious. I really think
that I can make her happy.

1094
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,221
And she makes me happy.

1095
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,604
So, I mean, that's a good thing, right?

1096
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,561
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a great thing.

1097
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,896
I want my mom to be happy
more than anything, so...

1098
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,575
Good. I do, too. So, what's your sport?

1099
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,367
I like basketball.

1100
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,867
- Oh, yeah? What position?
- I played small forward.

1101
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,117
Small forward. Yeah.

1102
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,853
All right.
I'm kind of a baseball guy myself.

1103
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,117
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

1104
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,815
I'm an old man. I like that stuff.
I got season tickets to the Yankees.

1105
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,045
No way. Really? That's cool.

1106
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,713
Yeah. I think
it's staten island's year.

1107
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,005
Oh, staten island Yankees.
Minor league.

1108
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,553
Absolutely. I'm not gonna go pay
to see those overpaid crybabies.

1109
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,597
They try harder
at the minor league level.

1110
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,871
Plus, I'm a Red Sox fan.
I'm never setting foot in that stadium.

1111
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,853
Well, I should get back to work
before I get yelled at.

1112
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,932
- Okay. Go ahead. Absolutely. All right.
- All right, man.

1113
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,391
Enjoy the hot bread.

1114
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,588
- Hey.
- Okay, cool.

1115
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,442
Hey.

1116
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,942
- What are you fellas talking about?
- Hey, mom.

1117
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,149
Uh, I was just asking Scott if he wanted
to go to a yankee game sometime.

1118
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,075
Uh, what did Scott say?

1119
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,280
Scott... Scott said yeah.

1120
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,496
All right, who's fighting tonight?
I want to fight somebody!

1121
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,879
I'm sorry, pepe.
Don't take this personally.

1122
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,461
What happened? That was just a jab.

1123
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,221
It's okay, pepe. It's all right.

1124
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,798
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1125
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,179
I mean, I never done that before, so...

1126
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,352
I feel bad for you.

how are you? How are you?
You guys still sober?

1134
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,225
- Shitty throw, though.
- That's how you do it!

1135
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,312
All right, there we go. There we go.

1136
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,727
Let's go, baby, let's go.

1137
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,357
Look alive!

1138
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,119
Think we're gonna take
these pansy spinners tonight?

1139
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,118
Oh, man, we can't take the spinners,
you might as well just shut it down.

1140
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,666
We should just pack it in,
send these guys back to single-a.

1141
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:14,566
My kid's little league team could give
these guys a run for their money.

1142
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,581
These guys are all on the job, too.

1143
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,256
The old ballbuster here...
He's the senior man of the house.

1144
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:24,760
Did you call me a senior?
You're the one who's bald.

1145
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,761
Come on, papa. I'm just fucking around.

1146
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,140
- Hey, you want a hot dog?
- Oh, no, I can't. I have crohn's.

1147
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,058
What's that?

1148
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,640
It's when the lining of your stomach
is all messed up,

1149
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,021
so it makes you shit all the time.

1150
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,777
Thanks for sharing.

1151
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,260
Next time, just say,
"I don't want a hot dog."

1152
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,945
I'm just trying to spread awareness.

1153
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,702
There we go. There we go.

1154
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,872
- Nice hit. Nice hit.
- Looking good, guys.

1155
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,991
Way to hustle.

1156
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,918
Hey, uh...

1157
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,811
You ever think about
putting on the jacket?

1158
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,760
- What are you laughing about?
- 'Cause it's a stupid question, ray.

1159
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,714
- What do you mean, stupid?
- It's fucking stupid.

1160
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,350
Would you ask the kids
of that teacher who blew up in space

1161
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,539
if they want to be an astronaut?

1162
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,394
I don't think that lady
had any kids, though.

1163
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:16,349
Yeah, I'm sure she didn't
'cause she died in space.

1164
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,401
It's hard to have kids
when you're dead in space.

1165
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,026
Look, I could tell you
how I feel about firemen,

1166
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,053
but I don't think you guys
want to hear my opinion.

1167
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,489
No, no, no, please tell us.
I want to hear it.

1168
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,911
- You don't got to do this, man. Come on.
- All right, no.

1169
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,363
Yeah. Okay, how about this?

1170
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,746
If you're a fireman, just don't
have kids or a family at all, okay?

1171
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,452
So that way,
you don't fucking crush them

1172
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,254
when you don't come home
that one time, you know?

1173
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,706
And you're just so selfish.

1174
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,793
You just hang out with your boys all day
like it's a fucking frat house.

1175
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,386
Half the time,
you're not even putting out fires.

1176
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,385
You're just jerking off,
watching scarface, okay?

1177
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,137
- Take it easy, man.
- I'm just saying.

1178
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,557
Yeah, but you miss graduation,
your birthdays, okay?

1179
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,607
My prom dances.

1180
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,731
That's a very mean thing
to do to children.

1181
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,188
And if you have a family,
you're an asshole.

1182
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,523
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1183
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,528
That's one way to look at it.
Yeah.

1184
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,825
Tell that to my dad.

1185
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,033
Oh, but you can't, 'cause he's dead.

1186
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,451
Anybody got a good response to that?

1187
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,586
Yeah!

1188
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,381
Again! Whoo!

1189
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:26,506
What a game. What a game.

1190
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,466
So, what, I shouldn't have kids?

1191
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,883
- No, you should have kids.
- I'm gonna have kids.

1192
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,685
Maybe you should take a cue
from your shirt, you know? Smile.

1193
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,099
Lighten up.

1194
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,019
That's actually kind of funny.

1195
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,897
Guy's all right.
Why can't you be more like him?

1196
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,733
Why can't you not
embarrass me like this?

1197
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,984
I'm sorry.

1198
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,410
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
in front of your friends.

1199
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,370
Just stick to your guns.
It'll be fine.

1200
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,999
Hey. Hey! Come on in.
Come have breakfast with us.

1201
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:05,002
I made pancakes, and I made
the sausage that you like, an omelet.

1202
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,260
- Come, come. Come sit.
- Man, these eggs are spectacular.

1203
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,928
With the onions and the peppers.

1204
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,430
I love it. I love it.

1205
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,436
Did he spend the night?

1206
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,481
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He slept here.

1207
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,477
In this house.

1208
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,311
I'm an adult. I can do that.

1209
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,862
I need to talk to you about something.

1210
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:28,950
Okay.

1211
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,902
I was thinking that it's time to think
about getting your own apartment.

1212
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,372
What? Why would you say that?

1213
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,494
Well...

1214
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,618
You are so awesome.

1215
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,630
And I think I've been there
for you too much.

1216
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,675
'Cause sometimes in life,
the thing that's motivating

1217
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,094
is when people don't have
that safety net.

1218
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,344
Right, but I need that safety net
'cause I don't have my shit together.

1219
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,517
So, why are you doing this?
Is this 'cause of him?

1220
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,065
No. It's just you're 24 years old now.

1221
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,231
Twenty-four.

1222
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,853
Phelps had a fistful
of gold medals by 24.

1223
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,153
Why are you talking?

1224
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,660
I'm just giving you
some perspective, that's all.

1225
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,197
Wayne gretzky had 96 goals
when he was 24.

1226
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,494
What?

1227
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,038
Roger staubach graduated west point,

1228
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,458
won a heisman trophy,
fought in the Vietnam war,

1229
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,706
and then joined the cowboys
by the time he was 24.

1230
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,960
I don't know who that is,
so who gives a fuck?

1231
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,793
I think that maybe you're ready
and you just don't even know it.

1232
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:32,803
So, you're kicking me out?

1233
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,131
No, no.

1234
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,466
I just want you to get
your own apartment by summer.

1235
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,847
Right, so you're kicking me
out of the house.

1236
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,428
That's nine months from now.

1237
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,811
I mean, you could have a baby
in nine months. It's a long time.

1238
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,858
Are you moving in?
Are you trying to push me out?

1239
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,981
What did I do? I thought we were cool.

1240
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,952
Scott, Scott, let's all be adults here.
Come on.

1241
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:54,275
Your mother has worked very hard
for a very long time.

1242
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,889
And I'm gonna retire in a couple years,

1243
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,201
so things are gonna change around here,
but in a good way.

1244
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,532
I mean, we think
that you can do great things.

1245
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:05,085
Yeah, I know I'm gonna do great things,
but I don't need you to tell me that.

1246
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,879
This... what's going on?

1247
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,507
I don't like this.

1248
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,461
So, be that as it may, until you leave...

1249
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,592
Which is gonna be good for you
and it's gonna be motivating...

1250
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,220
You're gonna have to pull your weight
a little more around here.

1251
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:22,053
And one thing that we thought
would help you contribute...

1252
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,559
Would be easy, wouldn't be hard to do...

1253
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,234
Is to help ray bring his kids
back and forth to school

1254
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,527
when he can't do it because of work.

1255
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,734
Like now. Like today.

1256
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,242
You're joking, right?

1257
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,529
You want me to take your kid
to school?

1258
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,164
The kid that I tattooed?

1259
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,704
I got two kids. The other one's seven.

1260
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,245
You're gonna make me babysit your kids?

1261
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,168
I'm on... I do drugs.

1262
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,424
Well, looks like you're walking.

1263
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,965
And thank you.

1264
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,971
I'm not cool with any of this, okay?

1265
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,096
And where do you expect me to live?
And with what money?

1266
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,178
You know I'm a fucking bum, right?

1267
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,430
Yo, this is fucked up! Seriously.

1268
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:10,268
Especially after last night,
all that bonding boy bullshit.

1269
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,529
You're full of shit, man.
You're a fucking liar.

1270
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,440
I'm gonna go walk your kids.

1271
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,784
No, I'm not fucking letting you
take 'em.

1272
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,611
Fuck you. Who the fuck are you?

1273
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,874
Yeah, I agree with you completely.
It was Ray's idea.

1274
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,481
I don't think I should be
taking them, either. I agree with you.

1275
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,081
Are you a weirdo?

1276
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,088
Oh, the weirdest.
Nobody's weirder than me.

1277
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:39,505
See, a weirdo wouldn't say that.
A weirdo would deny it.

1278
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,219
So, do I have to take 'em or...

1279
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,313
Yes.

1280
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,937
God, no.

1281
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,809
I mean, ray was supposed to do it.
I can't fucking do it.

1282
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,815
Their schools start half an hour apart
on the other side of town.

1283
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:02,449
So, your mom is banging my ex?

1284
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,640
Yeah, I'm not thrilled about it, either.

1285
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,907
Yeah, well, you shouldn't be.

1286
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,503
Harold. Kelly. Come here. Come here.

1287
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,332
There's something kind of fun.

1288
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,041
Come here. Come here.

1289
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,501
Oh, hey, man.

1290
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,759
So, this is Harold, and this is Kelly.

1291
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,465
And this is...

1292
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,843
Scott.

1293
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,178
Scott. He's gonna be taking care of you.

1294
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,809
- Okay?
- Nice to meet you, Scott.

1295
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,939
Hi, Harold. It's nice to meet you.
For the very first time.

1296
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,979
If he does anything weird, you tell me.

1297
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:40,407
Even if he tells you not to tell me,
you tell me.

1298
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,907
I'm pretty sure he's not weird,
but I could be wrong.

1299
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:45,533
Okay?

1300
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,739
Love you.

1301
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,743
- Love you, mom.
- Seriously.

1302
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,371
- Love you, mom. Bye.
- Pay attention.

1303
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,498
Got it.

1304
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,792
Hold both their hands!

1305
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,376
Thank you.

1306
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,430
Look both ways. Look both ways!

1307
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,053
- All right, stop.
- God!

1308
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,227
So, what do you like to do, Harold?

1309
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,854
I like superheroes.

1310
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,307
Well, so does everybody.

1311
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,313
No, I make up my own.

1312
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,143
Oh, yeah? What kind?

1313
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,820
Ice flash.

1314
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,022
What does he do?

1315
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:25,573
He freezes stuff
and shoots ice at people.

1316
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,280
Oh, well, that's not gonna work.

1317
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,375
Why not?

1318
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,415
I could just use a hair dryer
and ruin him.

1319
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,993
Keep thinking, though.

1320
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,397
What do you got? What do you like to do?

1321
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,254
I like to sing. You do?

1322
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:40,133
- Could you sing for me?
- Sure.

1323
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,880
J» oh, what a beautiful morning »

1324
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:45,885
yes.

1325
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,934
J» oh, what a beautiful day »

1326
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,180
all right.

1327
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:54,140
J I've got a wonderful feeling »

1328
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,896
j» everything's going my way j»

1329
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,273
that shit was dope. High five.

1330
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,524
She's a good singer.

1331
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,860
I don't agree with
the sentiment of the song,

1332
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,157
but it was really great.

1333
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,694
Anyway, have a great day at school.

1334
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,330
Uh, I hope it's not shitty,

1335
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,204
and, yeah, give your sister
a kiss goodbye.

1336
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,793
- We don't do that.
- Just do it.

1337
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,708
See? Wasn't that nice?

1338
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,031
Now, if she dies tomorrow,
you'll remember that,

1339
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,175
that you kissed her goodbye.

1340
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,801
Have a good day at school.

1341
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,757
- Later, man.
- Pay attention.

1342
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,430
Why would I die?

1343
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,728
I don't know.
You never know what's gonna happen.

1344
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,021
Think you're immortal?

1345
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,855
This. It's this one.

1346
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,686
Okay. All right.

1347
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,948
Well, have a good day, okay?

1348
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,526
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon, I guess.

1349
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,111
Can I help you?

1350
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:53,290
Oh, hi. I'm Ray's friend.
I was just here to bring her here.

1351
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,251
You know ray?

1352
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,546
I know ray a little bit.
He's kind of banging my mom.

1353
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,253
So, yeah, I'm just dropping her off.

1354
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,334
Did you sign in at the office?

1355
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,294
No. I didn't even know
you had an office.

1356
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,799
Okay. Um...

1357
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,923
Kelly? You okay?

1358
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,349
Yeah.

1359
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,846
You sure? Yeah.

1360
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,303
You know you can tell me.

1361
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,557
I'm okay.

1362
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,605
Do you know him?

1363
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,853
Yeah, kind of. He's a new friend.

1364
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,856
Okay.

1365
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,939
I trained her in the car.
She's not gonna break.

1366
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,942
I'm just kidding.
I'm not gonna hurt her.

1367
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:32,450
- But have a great day. I just...
- Actually, could you set up the paints?

1368
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,746
- No.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1369
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,228
- And just wash these brushes.
- No.

1370
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:36,162
- Thank you so much.
- No. No.

1371
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,460
- Thank you!
- No.

1372
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:00,019
Did you happen to get a chance
to take a look at the...

1373
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,230
Yeah, I looked at your book.

1374
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,644
I drew like that, too, when I was 14.

1375
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,439
From what I saw,
you don't really have the basics,

1376
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,070
so you got to figure that out.

1377
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,197
Well, yeah, that's why I'm here.
I was hoping I can learn from you.

1378
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:16,373
Right, well, you'd be my apprentice.
You'll be a slave to the shop.

1379
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,666
Hey, man. As long as I get
to tattoo people, right?

1380
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,916
No. Never. Until I say.

1381
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,632
You'll be sterilizing needles,
washing my car, taking the trash out.

1382
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,113
I mean, you're basically our bitch.

1383
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,093
So, how much will I be making here?

1384
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,346
Dick.

1385
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:32,764
Okay, well...

1386
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,308
It's a long line of people
who want this job, man.

1387
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,431
How do I pay my rent?

1388
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,480
That one right there is not my problem.

1389
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,797
It's your first day, you're
already complaining. It's kind of weird.

1390
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,028
Yeah, let's not do this.
You should take a walk.

1391
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,989
- Pussy.
- All right.

1392
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:54,119
Well, could I ask you a question?
If I did work here?

1393
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,411
Why is he still here?

1394
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,491
Let's say some idiot walks in
and he wants to get a tattoo

1395
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,667
of a confederate flag
wrapped around the grim reaper.

1396
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,523
You could tell that guy
to go fuck himself, right?

1397
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,788
'Cause that's a ridiculous tattoo
to ask for.

1398
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:08,296
It's not my place
to judge people, man. I don't do that.

1399
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,092
Well, what if another guy walked in

1400
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,140
and he wanted to get a tattoo of his
dead friend James on his chest, right?

1401
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,369
But you know James, and you don't
want to give him the tattoo,

1402
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,871
'cause you know James
and he's an asshole

1403
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,205
and that the world's better off
without him.

1404
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,915
- What do you do then?
- You have a death wish?

1405
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,976
No, I don't have a death wish.
But that lady on the motorcycle does.

1406
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:25,504
She's not even wearing any underwear.
She's gonna burn her pussy.

1407
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,381
Do you want to do this?
You really want to fucking do this?

1408
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,467
I don't want to do anything with you.
I just wanna know who killed James.

1409
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:32,324
Was it the confederate flag man?
Was it the motorcycle lady?

1410
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,402
I got to be honest, Kelsey.
You look exactly like your picture.

1411
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,079
You're kind of thicker, more robust.

1412
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,372
Oh, thank you.

1413
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,744
- Yeah.
- It's a compliment.

1414
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,123
You look a little bit
like Antonio banderas,

1415
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,579
if I squint really hard.

1416
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,834
Oh, please squint all night long.
That's great.

1417
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,320
Chelsea, you are...
I mean, Kelsey, I'm sorry.

1418
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,424
That's all right.

1419
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:52,252
What's your name again?
I forgot already.

1420
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,507
It's Jake. Sorry about that.

1421
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,883
So, what do you do?

1422
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,090
Oh, I'm studying to work in the city.

1423
01:04:57,185 --> 01:05:00,723
I want to make staten island
a great place again.

1424
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,929
Staten island's already cool.
What are you talking about?

1425
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,019
Yeah, it is. Yeah. It is.

1426
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,772
You're the first person here
to say that.

1427
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,602
No, no. It's the best place on earth.

1428
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,337
Well, at least on the east coast,
I think.

1429
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:12,866
Excuse me.

1430
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,067
Oh, hey. Hey.

1431
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,903
Hello.

1432
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,365
Aares tee

1433
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:25,577
would you guys like
still or sparkling water?

1434
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,287
Um, you pick.

1435
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:30,169
- I'm more of a sparkling guy, so...
- Sparkling it is.

1436
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,844
But I do like Tequila, so if I could get
just a patron with a rock.

1437
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,241
- That cool with you?
- Yeah, that's fine.

1438
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,801
- Cool. I prefer Tequila.
- Cool.

1439
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,804
Tequila and rock.
You guys want warm bread or olive oil?

1440
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:42,848
Warm bread.

1441
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:44,183
Oh.

1442
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,355
Bro, did you scare off another customer?
What's wrong with you?

1443
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:53,438
I'm so sorry about that.
He has nepotism, you know?

1444
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,318
Is that a disease?

1445
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,741
Yeah, it's a bad one.

1446
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,135
I brought that guy here to make
you jealous. You could give a fuck.

1447
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,871
To make me jea...

1448
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,200
- You don't seem jealous or upset at all.
- I do care. Of course I care.

1449
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:08,332
I chose the hottest guy on tinder.
Look at me. Look at me.

1450
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:09,287
Look at my tits.

1451
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,124
There's literally the Eiffel Tower
holding them up in here.

1452
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,459
- You look great. I'm...
- Thank you.

1453
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,010
Please don't cry here. Please.

1454
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,964
- You look awful.
- What do you mean?

1455
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,844
Your skin looks see-through.

1456
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:25,349
The circles around your eyes are so dark
you look like an anorexic panda.

1457
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,935
I know. I know I do.

1458
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,226
You always look sick and pale,

1459
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,518
like you have a disease
but you don't know it yet.

1460
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:34,104
You look like if I touched you,
you'd turn to dust.

1461
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:37,362
I'm sorry. I'm not doing very well.
I'm, you know...

1462
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,450
What do I tell your date?

1463
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:44,247
I don't know. Tell him to fuck off.
I met him ten minutes ago. He's a dj.

1464
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,628
Why do you not think
ice is a good superpower?

1465
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:59,008
It's amazing. I mean, ice flash
can do anything with his ice.

1466
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:02,181
And it's indestructible
'cause it's superhero ice.

1467
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:06,477
He can make giant shields
that reflect anything.

1468
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:12,104
He can make giant ice tanks,
giant ice planes and giant jets,

1469
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:15,403
helicopters that shoot giant missiles.

1470
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,106
I mean, think of all the possibilities.

1471
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,987
That's actually kind of cool.

1472
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,614
- Thanks.
- You came up with that?

1473
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,819
Yeah.

1474
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,578
You're getting really good at this.

1475
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,208
Thanks.

1476
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,123
What color is his shield?

1477
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,372
It's, well, the color of ice.

1478
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,499
Well, what's the color of ice?
Is it see-through?

1479
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,252
Like, light blue ice or is it like...

1480
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:39,427
It's blue ice 'cause it's superhero ice,
and it's cool.

1481
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:40,594
Right.

1482
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:44,516
You remember that kid Ronnie?
His uncle owns the pharmacy.

1483
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,718
He gave me the key.
We're gonna load up on oxys.

1484
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,332
So, we're robbers now.
That's our future.

1485
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,768
Nah. We're gonna do this one time.

1486
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:54,396
Get the money to seed our dreams.
Get that venture capital.

1487
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,944
Open that tattoo restaurant you wanted.

1488
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,899
It's not that big a deal. Jay-Z did it.
He sold crack to fund his rap career.

1489
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,406
Aren't most of Jay-Z's friends
dead or in jail?

1490
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:07,580
Yeah, but we're Jay-Z in this situation.
We're not Jay-Z's friends.

1491
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,074
We can't all be Jay-Z.

1492
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,581
There can't be four Jay-zs.
That doesn't make any sense.

1493
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,432
You guys know
I'd do anything for you, right?

1494
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,667
- Thank you.
- Appreciate you.

1495
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,124
- Just not this. I'm out.
- What are you talking about?

1496
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,629
This is crazy.

1497
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,632
Hey, we need you. You're the lookout.

1498
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,980
Literally anybody can be the lookout.
I don't need to be a part of this.

1499
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,142
We need you. You're our best friend.
We trust you.

1500
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,687
Well, best friends don't make other
best friends do stupid illegal shit.

1501
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,685
You make me do stupid shit
for you all the time.

1502
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,482
- Like what?
- I don't know.

1503
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,756
What about the time when you thought
you had testicular cancer?

1504
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,174
Here we go.
Knew this was gonna come up.

1505
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,065
And then I drive over
and you make me touch your nuts.

1506
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,859
I would've done it for you, bro.

1507
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,725
You're like, "there's something wrong
with my ass." I'd be like, "bend over."

1508
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,035
Come on.
After everything we've done for you?

1509
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,913
What do you do for me?
I let you tattoo my whole body.

1510
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,369
So what? You love my tattoos.

1511
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:58,047
You use me as a human sketchbook.
I don't, really.

1512
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,090
I don't. Not as much as I say I do.

1513
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,294
I'm out of here. My bad.

1514
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,968
You know what? You're a real bitch!
You're a bitch!

1515
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,551
Yo, don't shush me.

1516
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,136
Oh, my god, look how excited she is.

1517
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,346
I started running too early!

1518
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,567
Hey!

1519
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,858
Oh, you're so skinny.

1520
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:21,858
Have you been eating? Yeah.

1521
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,281
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?

1522
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,578
This is ray.

1523
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:27,827
Hey. How you doing?

1524
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,433
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1525
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:32,457
Yeah. I feel like I already know you.
Your mom talks about you all the time.

1526
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,912
Oh, god.

1527
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,994
No, only good stuff, only good stuff.

1528
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,626
Should we go eat?
I am so sick of eating off a tray.

1529
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,674
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I could eat. I could always eat.

1530
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,470
Beautiful school.

1531
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,419
"Yeah, I could eat. I could always eat.”

1532
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,217
Fucking asshole.

1533
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,965
Look at those two angels.

1534
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,095
Yeah, I know them.

1535
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,552
Yeah. You walk them to school,
don't you?

1536
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,541
- Yeah, I know who they are.
- Oh, my god.

1537
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,681
- She's so cute.
- Look. Look at those curls.

1538
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,609
We took them to see stomp off-Broadway.
They went crazy!

1539
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:00,981
Oh, my god. I love stomp.

1540
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,592
- What's stomp? What is that?
- It's the greatest musical of all time.

1541
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,983
Yeah, it's that show where
people play the drums on garbage cans

1542
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:08,909
and tap with broomsticks.

1543
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,486
Stuff around the house. Yeah.

1544
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,913
You just see a toaster,
we make an english muffin.

1545
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,787
They see a whole song. It's incredible.

1546
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,834
I know a homeless guy
that plays trash can lids

1547
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,753
on the subway for a dollar.

1548
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,255
And then he took a shit on the platform.

1549
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,667
Oh! Well, you know.

1550
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,231
I don't know if he's
gonna get a Tony, but...

1551
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,385
Maybe if they keep practicing
and get an adult diaper,

1552
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,012
they can get to Broadway someday.

1553
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:34,938
Yeah.

1554
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,305
So, are you guys really serious?

1555
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,810
Uh-oh.

1556
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,310
Well, actually,

1557
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:46,523
I'm going up to Boston
to meet his parents at Thanksgiving.

1558
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:50,735
What? You're going to Boston to...
For Thanksgiving?

1559
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,742
- Where am I gonna go?
- You'll come. We can all go.

1560
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,619
Yeah, we'd love to have you up there.

1561
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,917
You think you're gonna get
married again?

1562
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,585
Oh, boy, look what I got us into.

1563
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:00,787
Claire.

1564
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,749
Well, you know what?
I'll answer that, you know.

1565
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:07,381
A couple of months ago,
I would've said no, but...

1566
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:08,928
Can we go?

1567
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,131
Scott. Don't be rude.

1568
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,682
Me”? I'm not being rude.
He's talking the entire time.

1569
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,135
He's the one being rude.

1570
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,166
- Was just making conversation.
- So what did you want to say?

1571
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,600
- Cut this shit.
- Tell us now.

1572
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,023
All I wanted to say was
I think it's time to go, okay?

1573
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,647
I had a great time. This is wonderful.
I think we all bonded.

1574
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,319
It's time to leave now, all right?

1575
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:29,115
Well, we're going to a party later,
if you want to come with us.

1576
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,567
You just can't embarrass me.

1577
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,947
Sure, whatever.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1578
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,455
He's in a good mood.

1579
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,158
Try doing it your entire life.

1580
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,662
- We're gonna have a good night.
- Oh, yeah.

1581
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,622
No, we're not. I hate college parties.

1582
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,925
You've never been to a college party.
Come on, just enjoy it.

1583
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,628
- Relax. Go with it, okay?
- Yes, relax.

1584

1589
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:07,108
It's evolutionary sociology
with a splash of bio.

1590
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,856
I didn't know you could do that.

1591
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,179
Yeah, you can do whatever
the fuck you want. It's college.

01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,881
I like your tattoos.

1599
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,459
I'm an actress, so I don't think
I can get that many tattoos.

1600
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:32,341
Because what if I get cast
as an angelic role?

1601
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,638
I'm kind of, like,
a young winona Ryder.

1602
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,592
So, I could play those parts, and also,

1603
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,099
back when Shakespeare
was writing plays, like...

1604
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,018
What do you think? What is that?

1605
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:49,938
It's a butthole.

1606
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,231
- Get it?
- Oh, my god.

1607
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,349
So, we're talking about
how the one percent

1608
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,489
keeps getting bigger
and bigger and bigger,

1609
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:02,997
and the wealth inequality
is just out of control,

1610
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:06,454
and we can't continue
with capitalism this way.

1611
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,382
Yeah, I'm sick of the rat race.

1612
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:12,335
Yeah, no, exactly.
What happened to the American dream?

1613
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,513
I know.
It's like an American nightmare now.

1614
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,965
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Right?

1615
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,646
Bring it... oh, shit!

1616
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:28,226
Oh, shit! Fuck you! There are flames!

1617
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,436
That was fucking fun.

1618
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,441
I know. It was so fun.

1619
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:35,070
Yeah, I feel like
I kind of fit in for once, you know?

1620
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,447
And not everybody hated me
for the first time.

1621
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,869
You should come here.

1622
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:41,072
Yeah? You think I can
get into a place like this?

1623
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:42,782
I mean, you'd need a good gpa.

1624
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,480
I don't have a good one of those.
I didn't even graduate high school.

1625
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,232
Don't you have to graduate high school
to go to college?

1626
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,087
Yeah, but it's not too late to do that.

1627
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,882
All right, even so, I'm too old.

1628
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,756
I'd look like a narc, you know?
I would look creepy in the corner.

1629
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,008
Everybody'd be like,
"what's that guy doing here?"

1630
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,930
Everybody here is so old.

1631
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:02,351
Well, I'm fucking stupid, Claire, okay?
Is that what you want me to say?

1632
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,679
I can't pay attention.
I can't sit still, okay?

1633
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,310
I'm stupid. I'm a dumb idiot.

1634
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,420
I would have to work ten times harder
than those people.

1635
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,796
And everybody would
fucking make fun of me,

1636
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,311
and I'm not ready to
deal with that again, so, no.

1637
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,566
So, that's it?

1638
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:15,825
Huh?

1639
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:18,652
That's how long you're gonna think
about going to college for?

1640
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,916
That was a 40-second walk. That's a lot
of consideration, don't you think?

1641
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,073
Okay.

1642
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,117
- It's your journey.
- Indeed.

1643
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:29,670
Now, let's get down to brass tacks.
What are we gonna do about ray?

1644
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,588
- What do you mean?
- Don't act stupid.

1645
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:36,545
I mean, how are we gonna
get mom to break up with him?

1646
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:38,129
I think he seems fine.

1647
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:40,260
- You think he's fine?
- What do you want?

1648
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,537
It's mom's choice to make.
We don't need to get involved.

1649
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,552
Yeah, I know,
but we should still protect her.

1650
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,764
She can't just be with
the first guy she's been with since dad.

1651
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,439
She gotta peruse some dick.

1652
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:54,024
Mom doesn't need to "peruse dick."

1653
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,490
- You know she needs to.
- I think she seems happy.

1654
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:59,116
You want her to have sex
with a ton of people?

1655
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:01,410
No, but, yeah, kind of.

1656
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,907
That's gross.

1657
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,268
Well, if you knew something was bad
before it even started,

1658
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,203
wouldn't you stop it
if you had the chance?

1659
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,831
It's like that whole baby Hitler thing,
you know?

1660
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,628
If you had the chance
to kill baby Hitler

1661
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:13,252
before it grew up, wouldn't you do it?

1662
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,195
Wouldn't you strangle it
until its eyes popped out?

1663
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,925
So, Ray's baby Hitler?

1664
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:20,050
Yeah. In this situation, he is, yeah.
He's baby Hitler.

1665
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,348
So, do you want to help me
kill baby Hitler?

1666
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,595
Okay, you're right, Scott.
You're right. I'll see you tomorrow.

1667
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:27,689
Claire!

1668
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,607
Claire!

1669
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,073
Claire really seems like
she's enjoying school, you know?

1670
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:44,158
Yeah. She's just blossoming.

1671
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:48,078
Yeah. Girl just seems like
she could take on the world.

1672
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,710
I tell you, whatever you did with her,
you did it right.

1673
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,880
Dump some of that on Scott, you know?

1674
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:01,136
What do you think about
his tattoo restaurant idea?

1675
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,638
I think it's terrible.

1676
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,468
Getting a tattoo
is like a medical procedure.

1677
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,804
You don't want to go to the hospital
and order supper, you know?

1678
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,354
I just love that he has big dreams,
but he's just so lost.

1679
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:19,151
And no matter how much I try
to fill him with good energy, he just...

1680
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,607
He's got no self-esteem.

1681
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,535
He's really going nowhere.

1682
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,237
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1683
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:30,366
Scientists have been doing studies.
They say a lot of this stuff is genetic.

1684
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,952
You inherit it from your grandparents.

1685
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,305
Let's go.

1686
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:56,984
Right. If anybody sees us
or you hear sirens or anything bad,

1687
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,607
you text me, "you up?"

1688
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,050
Could I just text you something else?

1689
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,190
That sounds like I'm trying
to bang you, kind of.

1690
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,275
- Just do it.
- Fine.

1691
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,201
- Fine.
- Let's go.

1692
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,321
- Let's roll.
- Hold on.

1693
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,495
All right, let's go.

1694
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,698
Good luck, homey.

1695
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:11,999
Love you, Scott.

1696
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,539
Oh, shit.

1697
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,674
This is real.

1698
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,907
Yes!

1699
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,332
You're dead.

1700
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,083
What's going on? “What the fuck?

1701
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,865
- Who are you?
- You're not supposed to be here.

1702
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:06,491
What are you talking about?
It's my store!

1703
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,346
Who are you talking to?
Who is that?

1704
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:09,514
Go back inside.

1705
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,514
- Go back inside! I'm handling this!
- Don't tell me to go back inside!

1706
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,186
Yes. No. Yes.

1707
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,640
No. Yes. Yes. No.

1708
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:20,295
- Get the fuck out of my store!
- I don't want to hurt you, okay?

1709
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:23,149
- You're not doing this again, okay?
- This is the third time!

1710
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,232
Third time this year! Get out!

1711
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,568
- What the hell? Get off me!
- Not today!

1712
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,574
Not today!
Today is Alan moskowitz's day!

1713
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,496
Well, who's the pretty lady?

1714
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,709
Hello, Angelina Jolie.

1715
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,112
- Yo, it's locked!
- Where are the keys?

1716
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,718
We left the keys on the counter.

1717
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:47,805
Why'd you lock the door?

1718
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,347
Because I didn't want anybody
to come in, man.

1719
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:53,676
You're not gonna do this to me again!
Not in my store!

1720
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,352
- We've never been here before!
- Shit!

1721
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,142
I'm standing my ground!

1722
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,572
Fuck. Shit!

1723
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:11,035
"You up? You up? You up?"

1724
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,952
- What's happening?
- Be quiet. Be quiet.

1725
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,001
"Wanna fuck? Wanna fuck?"

1726
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,919
Do you want to fuck?

1727
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,837
Do you want to fuck?
Do you want to fuck?

1728
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,463
Okay, Igor. Answer the phone, Igor.
Come on, come on, come on.

1729
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,260
No. No. No. No. No. Scott.

1730
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,609
Shut off your ringers!

1731
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,649
Goddamn it.

1732
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,285
Hey, Oscar, it's Scott.

1733
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:57,866
I was just wondering
if you're almost done with that thing.

1734
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,450
We need those keys.

1735
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,391
Fuck that!

1736
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,469
Holy shit!

1737
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,103
Come on, Igor! Come on!

1738
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,680
- The robbers are inside!
- Hands in the air!

1739
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,153
The lady inside's got a gun.

1740
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,907
- Get down on the ground!
- Do not move!

1741
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,248
Why would you Rob a pharmacy?

1742
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,828
I wasn't robbing a pharmacy, okay?
I was the lookout, for your information.

1743
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,130
The lookout is also committing a crime.
Are you fucking crazy?

1744
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,833
Look, its all Ray's fault, okay?
He's trying fo kick me out.

1745
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:53,091
So I panicked and made a bad decision.
I'm only human!

1746
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,093
A bad decision? That's a felony.

1747
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:58,517
Yeah, so?
I didn't even go inside, all right?

1748
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,846
I'm untouchable.
I didn't do anything, all right?

1749
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,522
Its ray, okay?
I know he's up to something.

1750
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,067
- He's trying fo erase dad.
- Can you just let mom be happy?

1751
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:10,362
She is happy. Well, she will be
once I get rid of that guy.

1752
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,565
He's hiding shit, okay?
He's hiding shit.

1753
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,024
He's a weasel. I'm onto him.

1754
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,519
This is why I didn't want to leave,

1755
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,490
'cause now all your crazy's
focused on mom.

1756
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,991
I'm not doing anything crazy, okay?

1757
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:22,291
Doing nothing would be crazy.
I'm doing something. I'm taking action!

1758
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,790
Leave mom alone. Stop acting like you.

1759
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,040
What's that mean?

1760
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,917
You ruined my Halloween party.

1761
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:31,375
You know what?
Go enjoy your party. I got this.

1762
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:34,257
You don't got this. Don't do anything.

1763
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,839
- 1/ got this.
- Don't do anything!

1764
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,654
Hey, Scott. What's up?

1765
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,610
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1766
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:02,414
I just came by to say hi to the kids.
Are they around?

1767
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:06,418
Oh, well, they're not here.
They went to their grandma's.

1768
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,583
Oh.

1769
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,756
Well, what do you got
going on over there?

1770
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:14,756
I'm trying to open this bottle of wine,
but I think I mangled the cork.

1771
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,795
Oh...

1772
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,973
I could help. You want me to help?
Yes. Yes.

1773
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,140
Please.

1774
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,644
Yeah! Yes.

1775
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:27,143
So, do you have a friend coming over
or something?

1776
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,395
Oh, no.

1777
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,023
No, I just need some mommy time.

1778
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,948
Sometimes, mommies need to drink
when the kids are away.

1779
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:39,367
Oh, well, could I hang?
I could use some mommy time.

1780
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,037
Sure, but are you old enough to drink?

1781
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,018
Yeah, I'm old enough.
I just... I'd rather smoke.

1782
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,282
Do you mind if I smoke in here?

1783
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:48,790
Oh, no. No. Let's crack some windows.

1784
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,997
- It's Tuesday.
- Really?

1785
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,047
'Cause ray hates when I smoke weed.

1786
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,384
Well, I hate ray.

1787
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,128
Awesome.

1788
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,853
You know...

1789
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,015
You have the sweetest,

1790
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,271
most adorable
kids I've ever met in my life.

1791
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:13,977
I can't believe they came out of ray.

1792
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:15,688
I know.

1793
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:18,945
And you know what?
You know what the thing is about ray?

1794
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:22,153
I never say a bad word about him
in front of the kids...

1795
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:26,991
Which is very difficult
because he's a cunt.

1796
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,621
Yeah, I can imagine.

1797
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:32,625
Well, I'm not one of your kids,
so have at it.

1798
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:35,048
Let it all out. Tell me everything.

1799
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:40,550
Do you know he is fighting to actively
not have custody of his kids?

1800
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:41,926
You can do that? Yeah.

1801
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,803
- That's insane.
- I know.

1802
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,455
Who wouldn't want
to hang with your kids?

1803
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:47,515
Who wouldn't want to hang out
with those kids?

1804
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:50,268
What monster wouldn't want
to hang out with those kids?

1805
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,359
Every second!

1806
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,183
Your daughter sang the other day.

1807
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:56,270
- What did she sing?
- Something from Oklahoma! Or something.

1808
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:58,777
And I hate that shit,
and I fucking loved it.

1809
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,949
She's such a little angel.

1810
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,901
- Mmm.
- I thought she was a robot

1811
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,933
for the first couple days
I was hanging out with her.

1812
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,743
I know. She's so perfect.

1813
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,289
What a fucking putz.

1814
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:12,871
Yeah, so he only wants to see them on
Wednesday night for dinner and Sunday.

1815
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:16,002
- Well, you can't just pick and choose.
- No, you can't.

1816
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,533
What are your kids, the NFL package?

1817
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,334
Wait, you're only... yeah. Yeah.

1818
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,044
But why would you want
your kids, really,

1819
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:25,929
if you don't have an apartment
and you sleep at the firehouse?

1820
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:28,101
I mean, you...

1821
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:29,268
Unbelievable.

1822
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:33,315
What kind of a grown man can't afford
his own apartment in staten island?

1823
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:34,892
Fucking loser.

1824
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,731
He lost all our money gambling.

1825
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:43,235
He is homeless, he's penniless,
and he's a deadbeat dad.

1826
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,364
What is your mom doing with him?

1827
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:49,243
My mom hasn't gotten laid in 17 years,
so I think her bar is pretty low.

1828
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,582
Really? Yeah.

1829
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,244
He's good in bed, I hate to say it.

1830
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:57,627
All right.
Well, I didn't really need to know that.

1831
01:24:57,718 --> 01:25:00,505
Yeah. He's got a beautiful cock.

1832
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,050
I mean, it's his only attribute.

1833
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:06,928
That big thick cock kept me in it

1834
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,226
for eight years longer
than I should have stayed.

1835
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,098
It's a fact.

1836
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,976
I knew I smelled you.

1837
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,931
The fuck, Scott, huh? “What?

1838
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,435
What, are you spying on me now?
You Magnum, p.1.?

1839
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,315
- What?
- Telling your mom that I'm homeless?

1840
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,259
You think it's funny
to tell her that I'm a loser?

1841
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,274
What are you talking... no. What?

1842
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,155
What am I talking about?
You talking to my ex-wife?

1843
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,684
- Yeah. She's a really nice person.
- Oh, is she? Why don't you marry her?

1844
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,289
Marry her and see
what the fuck happens.

1845
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,459
Hey, I'm just trying to protect my mom
from you. You're a fucking psychopath.

1846
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,787
Oh, I'm a psychopath?
I've been nothing but nice to you!

1847
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:39,919
I tried giving you direction. You're too
busy smoking your fucking weed.

1848
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:42,864
All you've been doing is trying to
destroy everything I have with Margie.

1849
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,424
Because you're a fucking loser, dude!

1850
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:48,177
You're a degenerate gambler
in your mid-50's who bets on the jets.

1851
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:50,304
Have you not learned
anything about betting?

1852
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,726
The jets are gonna come back!

1853
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:54,805
No, they're not!
They're never gonna come back!

1854
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,686
I'm trying to give
your mother a good life!

1855
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,777
No, you're not, okay?
You're a piece of shit, dude.

1856
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,898
You're a fucking drug addict!
I'm a piece of shit?

1857
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,759
Yeah, you're a piece of shit!
I'm a fucking loser?

1858
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:04,218
You're the biggest loser
I ever met in my fucking life!

1859
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,262
Oh, really? You should know.
You surround yourself with them.

1860
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,197
- Yeah? Why don't you try me?
- Oh, really?

1861
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:10,244
This ain't gonna go
how you think it's gonna go.

1862
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:11,868
Get the fuck out of my... really?

1863
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:18,044
- Fucking asshole.
- Throw a fucking punch at me?

1864
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,792
You gonna cool off?

1865
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:22,295
I'll fucking cool you off.
Yeah, I'll fucking cool you off!

1866
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,591
Hey, you cool off now? You're in there
'cause of your own actions!

1867
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:31,766
Are you kidding me?

1868
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,764
I'm gonna tell my mom
you tried to drown me.

1869
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,917
In an aboveground pool?
You're, like, fucking eight feet tall.

1870
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,086
You're lucky my dad isn't here.
He would kick your ass.

1871
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,601
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what.
I knew your dad.

1872
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,233
Okay? Yeah, I crossed paths
with him a number of times.

1873
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:46,156
And you know what? He was
even a bigger asshole than you are!

1874
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,906
All right, that's it.
It's over. It's over.

1875
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,740
All right. Huh? Huh?

1876
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,368
You like that? You like that?

1877
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:03,509
Fucking asshole.

1878
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,588
Come on, tap out! Tap out!

1879
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,340
Get me out! Let me out!

1880
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:08,431
- No! No!
- Let me out!

1881
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,973
Oh, my god! What's the matter with you?

1882
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,515
- He's a psycho.
- No. We're just talking.

1883
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:18,142
- About what?
- About him telling you lies about me.

1884
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,211
He's an animal. He picked me up
and he threw me in the pool.

1885
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,567
- All right? He has to go.
- No, I need you to go. Now.

1886
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,895
Why me? He's the one who started it.

1887
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,677
Yeah, get the hell out of here.
Get a job and a life while you're at it.

1888
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:30,534
- Your freeloading days are over.
- You, too. Get going.

1889
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,078
- What did I do?
- You put your hands on my son!

1890
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,793
You're not respecting my family!
You're an animal!

1891
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,867
Okay, just listen. Just calm down.

1892
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,920
I don't have to calm down!
You're attacking my son!

1893
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,417
And you're making up lies!

1894
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,715
You tricked me into thinking
you're a good guy.

1895
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,384
You're not a good guy.
You're a fucking small guy.

1896
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:50,992
Margie, just let me explain this to you.
Just let me talk to you.

1897
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,678
- You are not in control of me.
- Okay, okay, listen. All right?

1898
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,413
You don't have
all the information you need.

1899
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,915
Scott is acting out 'cause he's afraid
to move on with his life.

1900
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:58,769
It's no different

1901
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,710
than when the Boston Red Sox
finally won a world series.

1902
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:04,727
Oh, my god. Just shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

1903
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,102
All I did was just ask him a question,
and he flipped out.

1904
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:09,797
So I put him in the water,
which is soft. I diffused the situation.

1905
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:12,680
It was what my training's all about.
I was totally diffusing the situation.

1906
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,807
Do you ever shut up?
Do you ever just shut the fuck up?

1907
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,685
You just talk and you talk and you talk,
and you don't know what you're saying.

1908
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,040
It makes no sense.

1909
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:23,120
It's like you picked up all these little
pieces of information from all over.

1910
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,080
They don't make any sense.
They're fragments.

1911
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,836
No sense. Nonsense.

1912
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:32,515
I'm not talking.

1913
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,684
I've had it up to here. I'm done.
Both of you, get your shit out of here.

1914
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:43,602
Margie.

1915
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,569
Fuck. Well...

1916
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,112
Where do we go now?

1917
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,565
What are you asking me for?

1918
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,776
You created this whole mess,
you fucking schmuck.

1919
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,566
Hey, man.

1920
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:35,532
Are you mad at me?

1921
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,741
Me? No, of course not.
Are you mad at me?

1922
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,330
I mean, no, but...

1923
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:45,127
- Are they asking questions about me?
- I'm not gonna snitch on you, man.

1924
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,499
But at the same time,
what am I gonna say to them?

1925
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,832
You were the lookout
that didn't look out.

1926
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,010
Um, well, I've been meaning to ask you.

1927
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:59,136
Since you're in here, I was wondering

1928
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:02,264
if you wouldn't mind me staying
at your house for a little bit.

1929
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,096
You came up here to ask me that?

1930
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:07,253
- I also came to see you.
- No, you didn't come to see me.

1931
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:09,171
You came to ask me that.
No, you can't stay at my house.

1932
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:11,340
- I'm sorry... I have nowhere to go, bro.
- My house is frightening, dude.

1933
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,467
- My mom kicked me out.
- The fuck are you doing with your life?

1934
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:16,291
Drive all the way down here just
to ask me if you can stay at my house.

1935
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,859
- No, I...
- No, you don't love me.

1936
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:21,162
I do love you. I'm sorry. You're right.
I shouldn't have asked. I'm sorry.

1937
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,285
And you know what?
I need you to do me a favor.

1938
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:25,992
- Anything, bro. Just ask.
- You gotta feed my cat.

1939
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:27,873
All right?

1940
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,670
For the next three to five months.

1941
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,808
Is there anything else I could do?
'Cause I'm kind of allergic to cats.

1942
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:35,843
You better look out for sprinkles,

1943
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:37,963
because I'm looking out for you.

1944
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,177
- All right?
- You got it.

1945
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,793
I don't want you just going in there,
feeding him and running out.

1946
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,523
You got to go in there,
scratch his belly.

1947
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,653
You tell him I miss him
and I'll see him soon.

1948
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,401
Right. Um...

1949
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,779
How are the boys?
How's Igor and Richie doing in there?

1950
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,361
I'll tell you right now.
I haven't seen Richie.

1951
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:04,160
Igor? Bro, look to your right.

1952
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,241
That's Carla. Carla.

1953
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:09,995
Holy shit! Get the...
Bro, she's fucking real.

1954
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,627
- She's fucking real.
- She's fucking real. Holy shit.

1955
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:15,208
Yo. She's hot, man.

1956
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,351
He was telling the truth
the entire time.

1957
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:25,060
Good for him, man. That's awesome.
Yeah.

1958
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:35,525
Hey, you.
What the hell are you doing there?

1959
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,776
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was my house.

1960
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:39,528
Get out of my backyard!

1961
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,489
Get the hell out of here!

1962
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:54,084
I'm really glad we did that.
It was really nice.

1963
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,548
Me, too. That was awesome.

1964
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,218
Yeah. I missed you.

1965
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,806
Oh, yeah? I missed you, too.
Just like old times.

1966
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,757
I miss all my friends, you know?

1967
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,595
Mr. shark, Mr. weird skeleton.

1968
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:09,854
Well, they missed you, too.

1969
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,397
They missed you, too.

1970
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:16,027
Hey, I'm in a bit of a situation.

1971
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,230
You think I could stay here
for a few days?

1972
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:20,235
What are you talking about?

1973
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:23,569
Well, it's silly.
Me and ray got into this big fight.

1974
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:26,655
And then my mom caught us,
and she just started yelling at us.

1975
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,742
And she threw us out, so...
She kind of lost her mind.

1976
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:34,003
- Is that why you're here right now?
- No.

1977
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,749
Did you just fuck me for shelter?

1978
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:41,052
No, I didn't fuck you for shelter.
I didn't do anything.

1979
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,721
What? I just need a place to stay.

1980
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:45,514
Oh, god.

1981
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:48,810
Dude, dude, how many times
we gotta do this?

1982
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:51,183
What do you mean? I just want to...

1983
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,194
Just a couple weeks.
It's not that big of a deal.

1984
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:55,938
A few weeks? You just said a few days.

1985
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:57,314
- Or a couple months.
- Months?

1986
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:00,363
Well, I'm figuring my stuff out.
I don't know the future.

1987
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,028
Oh, my god, you...

1988
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,697
- There you go.
- What the... hey.

1989
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:08,747
I'm not going to let myself
be upset by you,

1990
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,289
but I'm gonna tell you something.

1991
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:12,367
You make me feel so crazy.

1992
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:15,670
I'm not gonna let myself be crazy now,
but you make me feel crazy!

1993
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:19,591
You are so crazy that you make
everyone around you feel fucking crazy.

1994
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,009
The people meet you,
and they're normal people,

1995
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,240
and then they hang out with you,

1996
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,676
and then they're Jack Nicholson
in the shining or something.

1997
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,723
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1998
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:30,268
I got to stay zen. I got to meditate.

1999
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:32,141
I'm meditating right now.

2000
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,018
And you got to go. “What?

2001
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:35,645
Yeah, here's your shit.

2002
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:37,441
- Okay.
- Staying calm.

2003
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,937
You got to leave. It's time to go.

2004
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:41,907
Get out.

2005
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:45,279
- Well, I don't have anywhere to go.
- Not my problem anymore.

2006
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,702
Thank you for the sex.

2007
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:51,289
It was wonderful
until you started talking.

2008
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:52,703
You got to go.

2009
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:54,705
Could I sleep in your brother's room?

2010
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:56,046
No.

2011
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,422
- But he has bunk beds.
- He's 14 years old.

2012
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,712
Yo, Dougie, can I crash in your room?

2013
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,092
That's not happening, bro.

2014
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,136
Jesus Christ.

2015
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:21,235
Fuck.

2016
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:57,264
Hey, do you know where ray bishop is?

2017
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,814
He's in the back. Come with me.

2018
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:03,566
How about next time you put your mask on
before we get off the rig?

2019
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,718
I'm standing at that front door
for a minute waiting for you.

2020
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:06,777
What the hell?

2021
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:08,220
Always with the backhanded compliment.

2022
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:10,781
Why can't you just
at least say the nice thing and then...

2023
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,683
Listen, you should be happy
with any compliment.

2024
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:14,698
- It's constructive criticism.
- Go ahead.

2025
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:18,034
I would respond better to encouragement.

2026
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,711
I encourage you to shut the fuck up.

2027
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,538
He's soft. He can't take it.

2028
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:23,986
- You're right.
- He's an emotional eater.

2029
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,797
That's the problem with this generation.
They can't take criticism.

2030
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,173
They get all upset.

2031
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:32,132
I'm not a whole generation, all right?
I'm just a man. A man with feelings.

2032
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,933
Oh, my god.

2033
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,601
Now you're making me look bad.

2034
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:38,430
- You're a man?
- Now you're making me look bad. Stop.

2035
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:42,142
Ray. Hey, ray.

2036
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,025
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2037
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,360
What are you doing here?

2038
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:52,660
Look, I don't have anywhere else to go.
I'm out of options, so...

2039
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:53,827
Why would I care?

2040
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:55,530
I'm sorry. Like...

2041
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,365
Go sleep under a tree. I don't care.

2042
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,042
Do you have any idea
what you took from me? Do you?

2043
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:04,251
Huh? You do a 60-minute interview
with my ex-wife

2044
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:05,798
to find out what kind of guy I am?

2045
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:08,547
- What do you think she was gonna say?
- I don't know.

2046
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,924
By the way, I'm not a gambler, okay?
I day-trade.

2047
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:12,471
I don't know the difference.

2048
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:14,718
You should've found out
before you shot your mouth off.

2049
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,845
You smoke weed, but you're not dumb.
You knew what you were doing.

2050
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,667
You went to the person
that hates me the most

2051
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,531
to get the worst review
you could possibly get.

2052
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,296
Why didn't you come down here and ask
these guys what they thought of me?

2053
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,561
Did you ever think of doing that?

2054
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:28,521
I'm sorry. You're right. You're right.

2055
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,344
You're not sorry
or you wouldn't have done it.

2056
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:32,221
So now what?
Now you don't have a place to stay?

2057
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:34,531
So you come here with your puppy dog
look on your face,

2058
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:35,907
and I'm supposed to feel bad?

2059
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:38,536
Look, all I know is,
if you're not nice to me,

2060
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,538
then my mom will hate you forever
and she'll never forgive you.

2061
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:45,247
- Really? You're gonna play that card?
- It's a pretty good card.

2062
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:47,586
It's all I got.

2063
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,106
Ray.

2064
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:06,271
Hey, ray.

2065
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:09,062
Raymond.

2066
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:10,730
Ray!

2067
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:13,237
What?

2068
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:16,161
Hey, I can't sleep.
I never go to sleep this early.

2069
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:20,456
Oh, well, you know what you should do?
You should shut the fuck up.

2070
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:22,375
Go to sleep.

2071
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:23,702
Thanks.

2072
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:25,829
Can't go to sleep.

2073
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:28,790
Why don't you dip your weed in nyquil,
you fucking drug addict?

2074
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:41,845
Hey, what do I do?

2075
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,351
Do what you always do.
Sit there and do nothing.

2076
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,676
Hey, where do you go
to the bathroom around here?

2077
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:19,177
Number one, down there.

2078
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,028
Number two,
dunkin' donuts across the street.

2079
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,561
Have a wonderful day, man.

2080
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,139
Oh, thanks.

2081
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,776
How'd you sleep, big man?

2082
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,276
I hear you're Stan's kid.

2083
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,099
He was a brave man.
It's an honor to meet you.

2084
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:42,705
Thanks, man.
It's an honor to meet you, too.

2085
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,282
I didn't do anything, though.

2086
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,625
- You don't think you did?
- No.

2087
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,166
I appreciate your sacrifice.

2088
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:54,338
- No, I got this one to impress a girl.
- Oh.

2089
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:55,794
And how did that work out?

2090
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:57,970
Not good. We've been married 18 years.

2091
01:38:58,057 --> 01:38:59,092
Oh! Poor woman.

2092
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:00,639
- Eighteen years?
- Congratulations.

2093
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:01,886
Thank you. Wow.

2094
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:05,311
The rest I got, maori, tribal.

2095
01:39:05,398 --> 01:39:07,042
- It's beautiful work, man.
- Thank you, man. I appreciate that.

2096
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:07,976
- What was that one?
- Maori.

2097
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,603
This stands for strength and courage.

2098
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:10,694
Really? Yeah.

2099
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,359
What the hell are you still doing here?

2100
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:17,031
Well, you know, believe it or not,

2101
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,325
I couldn't find a place to live
in just a night, so...

2102
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:20,412
I believe it.

2103
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:23,238
- I'm kind of fucked, ray.
- Yes, you are.

2104
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:26,620
I'd say finish up your free breakfast
and hit the bricks.

2105
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:28,952
All right. It's all right.
The kid can stay.

2106
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,829
But you got to work, all right?
You ready to do some work?

2107
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:36,217
Yeah. Did you just make me a fireman?

2108
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:40,967
No. Go clean the toilets
or get the fuck out.

2109
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,094
Did I make you a...

2110
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:47,269
Hey, do me a favor.
The bathroom downstairs... I used it.

2111
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:48,641
You can start there.

2112
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:50,518
Great.

2113
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,271
Get gloves. Pretty muddy.

2114
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:54,147
When I see a big stain like that,

2115
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:56,775
I go up and down,
and then I go left and right.

2116
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:58,731
- Good times.
- There you go.

2117
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,441
You got to get the splatter.

2118
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,703
You see that?
That's a nice straight line.

2119
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:07,827
Yeah, you guys got to do
a lot of shit work, huh?

2120
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:10,285
We don't refer to it as shit work.

2121
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:12,244
This is our house.
We want it to look nice.

2122
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,046
You know, company pride.

2123
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:15,498
You got to wash it hot.

2124
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:18,084
Hot. Not warm, not cold. Extra hot.

2125
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:19,715
- Okay.
- Because of the bedbugs.

2126
01:40:19,805 --> 01:40:20,920
What's bedbugs?

2127
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,006
They're a tiny insect

2128
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,432
that get into your home
and they run you out.

2129
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,159
- You know how they procreate?
- No.

2130
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:48,616
The male bedbug takes his penis
and jams it into the female's stomach.

2131
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:51,792
Does the female have a vagina?
Yeah, she does. It doesn't matter.

2132
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,619
He jams it into her stomach.

2133
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:57,607
- How do you know all this, man?
- How do I know, I researched it.

2134
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:01,882
- Just flip it over.
- Oh!

2135
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:04,430
There you go, yeah.
You got it. Just flip it right down.

2136
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:06,726
Very nice.

2137
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:09,927
Well done.

2138
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:13,765
When you have bedbugs, everybody leaves.
My parents stopped calling.

2139
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:15,546
My brothers and sisters
stopped coming over.

2140
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,777
My qirl left. Everybody's gone.

2141
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:19,819
And you know who's there for you
at the end?

2142
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,068
Ironically? The bedbugs.

2143
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:24,805
I never thought I'd say it,

2144
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:26,549
but if I make chief,
I'm making you my aide.

2145
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:28,058
- Yeah?
- What's up, kid?

2146
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:29,643
Well, how do you think
you did on the test?

2147
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:32,249
Tough test.
I mean, I hope I did good.

2148
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:33,336
Fuck!

2149
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:41,842
He's doing a good job.

2150
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:43,711
He knows how to wash a truck.

2151
01:41:43,806 --> 01:41:46,343
Getting ready for his career
working at a car wash.

2152
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:48,845
You ever gonna give this kid
a break or what?

2153
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,181
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2154
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:53,645
Then do nothing.

2155
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,774
Were you on the job
when Stan was killed?

2156
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:00,189
Yeah. You know I was.

2157
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:03,610
What's the first thing
you thought of when you heard?

2158
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,866
I wondered if he had kids.

2159
01:42:21,177 --> 01:42:22,838
Why do we have to clean
this thing anyway?

2160
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:24,793
It's just gonna get fire on it.

2161
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:26,925
You think the people
that are burning alive

2162
01:42:27,016 --> 01:42:28,927
give a fuck if the truck is shiny?

2163
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:30,053
Just saying.

2164
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,055
I don't even know why
you gotta clean the truck.

2165
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:34,808
What, you're trying to show up
all sexy to a fire?

2166
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,268
I like him.

2167
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,195
No! No! Stop!

2168
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,496
All right!

2169
01:42:55,044 --> 01:42:57,535
Let me fix that backpack. It's slipping.

2170
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,373
It's weird having you walk me to school.

2171
01:43:02,468 --> 01:43:03,583
Why is that?

2172
01:43:03,678 --> 01:43:05,168
'Cause Scott always walks me.

2173
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,675
I walk you sometimes.

2174
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:10,806
Uh, I guess so.

2175
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,427
Is he weird around you guys?

2176
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:17,725
No. He's nice.

2177
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:20,020
He asks me how I'm doing.

2178
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:22,438
What do you tell him?

2179
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:24,945
I say I'm doing fine.

2180
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:28,524
Look, you don't have to lie
to make me feel better.

2181
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:30,881
I know me and your mom
could do a better job

2182
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,911
getting along
through all of this, and...

2183
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:36,115
Hey, I'm sorry
if I haven't handled it so well.

2184
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:39,664
What's that?

2185
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,872
Oh, that's ice flash.

2186
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:46,084
Scott drew it for me,
but it didn't come out so good.

2187
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:48,419
Yeah, I think his drawings
are a little shaky.

2188
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,255
That's the one that I drew.

2189
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:55,097
This is how he drew it.

2190
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:01,317
It's good, right?

2191
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,192
Yeah, it's better than good.

2192
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:05,270
Did a great job.

2193
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:08,823
Yeah. He said he was gonna teach me.

2194
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:12,534
He said he'd teach you how to do that?
Yeah.

2195
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:15,745
And he stays to his word.

2196
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:28,877
It's so nice in here now. I love it.
I love the colors. I love everything.

2197
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,303
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Scott.

2198
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:33,847
What's going on in here?
Why is everything so different?

2199
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:35,515
Isn't it nice? Do you like it?

2200
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:37,551
Is that a pink chair?

2201
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:40,500
- Yeah, we've been redecorating.
- What's up with the drapes?

2202
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:43,015
Yeah. Plants, too.

2203
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:46,401
- Yeah.
- Your mother has great taste.

2204
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:48,942
- Yeah.
- Where have you been staying?

2205
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:51,149
Oh, I've been at the firehouse with ray.

2206
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:54,360
Oh, okay. Well, I'm just glad
that you're not on the street.

2207
01:44:54,455 --> 01:44:55,820
I told you he wasn't homeless.

2208
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:58,625
When you're right, you're ri...
I love this green.

2209
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:03,498
I actually have been learning a lot
and bonding with the guys.

2210
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:06,251
So, yeah. Yeah, they got me cleaning.

2211
01:45:06,342 --> 01:45:10,381
They got me washing stuff
and working around the firehouse.

2212
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:13,008
I really understand
where you were coming from before,

2213
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:14,759
you know, when you threw me out.

2214
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:16,590
I think I really got
my shit together now,

2215
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:18,767
and I'm ready to come back and...

2216
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:24,015
Okay. So, you think
you know what hard work is?

2217
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:27,397
Well, I wouldn't say that,
but I definitely have an idea.

2218
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:33,484
You mopped a floor and you cooked.
You cleaned a bathroom once.

2219
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:38,784
Oh, Scott, how's your shoulder feel
after all that very hard work?

2220
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:41,206
You're making fun of me.
Why are you making fun?

2221
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,534
I worked really hard. I did. Ask ray.

2222
01:45:43,629 --> 01:45:46,211
He's trying to get back.

2223
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:47,378
Eat a dick, joy.

2224
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:50,003
Had one for breakfast. I'm full.

2225
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:51,425
Hey!

2226
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:54,879
- And where's dad's shrine?
- You're ruining the vibe.

2227
01:45:54,974 --> 01:45:56,574
Where's his shrine?
Where's dad's shrine?

2228
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,807
All of his stuff is gone.
All my shit's gone.

2229
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:00,134
- What's going on?
- Honey.

2230
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:03,938
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry
I raised my voice. I'm sorry I laughed.

2231
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,919
- Could we talk in private?
- Let's go outside, yeah.

2232
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:07,504
- We're gonna speak for a minute.
- I'm sorry.

2233
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:08,880
- So sorry.
- It's okay, joy.

2234
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:10,485
Let's just have a real...

2235
01:46:10,573 --> 01:46:13,280
- Let's just talk outside.
- Let's get into it. Right. Okay.

2236
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:16,658
Oh, no, you did not!

01:46:17,246 --> 01:46:19,578

Heavy smoke coming from the roof.

2239
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,833
Hey, yo, Scott,
you want to ride this one in?

2240
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,126
Is that okay?

2241
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:28,830
Yeah, jump in.

2242
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,130

2267
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:16,236
5-7 o.V. Fo 5-7.
I got a 10-45 on the second floor.

2268
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,188
Gonna bring him down the inside stairs.

2269
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:19,864
70-4, ray.

2270
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,196
5-7 roof fo 5-7...

2271
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:24,118
1-4-9 chauffeur fo 7-4-9.

2272
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,618
- How's the water pressure?
- Pressure's fine.

2273
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:36,632
5-7-9 fo 5-7, all the
apartments on the first floor are clear.

2274
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,084
70-4, cap.

2275
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:45,473
You know, everyone gets nervous
during their first fire.

2276
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,722
When I was a probie, I was so scared,

2277
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:51,021
I would follow my captain everywhere,
just hold on to his jacket.

2278
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:53,690
Follow him around,
hold on for dear life.

2279
01:48:54,486 --> 01:48:56,693
But everybody gets a little scared.

2280
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,771
I mean, it keeps you honest.

2281
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,608
You know? If you don't get scared,
there's something wrong with you.

2282
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:02,817
Mmm-hmm.

2283
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:08,034
And, by the way,
your dad never got scared.

2284
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:09,907
Yeah? How do you know?

2285
01:49:12,004 --> 01:49:14,996
I mean, back in the day,
I was at the same house with him

2286
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,796
for about six months.

2287
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:19,717
You worked with my dad for six months
and you're just telling me?

2288
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:23,216
Yeah. I mean,
I didn't want to make you feel weird.

2289
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:25,577
Didn't want to insult you
'cause you seem a little delicate.

2290
01:49:25,601 --> 01:49:28,217
No. Please. What was he like?

2291
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:31,019
He was kind of like you.

2292
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:33,973
You, known, if you didn't know him,
you'd think he was a crack baby.

2293
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:38,360
No, but he was a good guy.
He was a great guy.

2294
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:40,654
I heard he was fucking hilarious.

2295
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:43,983
And he got away with so much shit
because he was so freaking likable.

2296
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,160
What kind of stuff?
What'd he get away with?

2297
01:49:46,705 --> 01:49:48,745
One time, we were driving down
the West Side highway

2298
01:49:48,832 --> 01:49:50,632
- after being out all night.
- Mmm.

2299
01:49:50,918 --> 01:49:53,000
- You know this.
- This is a good one.

2300
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:56,625
And he's up through the sunroof.

2301
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:59,457
He's sitting on top of the car.
We couldn't get him in.

2302
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:02,918
So we start speeding up,
stopping short, you know?

2303
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:08,056
By the time we hit the bridge,
he fell onto the windshield.

2304
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:11,556
So he's... he's, like... “What?

2305
01:50:11,647 --> 01:50:13,638
Hanging on, cursing at us,

2306
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:15,643
putting his face
up against the windshield.

2307
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,941
He's like, "you motherfuckers!"

2308
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:20,360
It was like some real Tom Cruise shit.

2309
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:22,028
So...

2310
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:27,776
We get into Brooklyn,
and sure enough, there's cops.

2311
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,611
They were waiting for us.

2312
01:50:29,706 --> 01:50:30,616
Oh, shit.

2313
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:32,914
So now I'm like,
"oh, fuck. We're screwed."

2314
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:35,287
Stan gets off the car.
He goes over to the cop.

2315
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:38,667
I'm thinking, "oh, shit,
he's gonna fucking clock this cop."

2316
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:42,124
You know, and he goes right up to him,
grabs his face,

2317
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:43,800
and he kisses him on the lips.

2318
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:46,170
They went to high school together.

2319
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:48,221
They went
to fucking high school together.

2320
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:51,175
I'm like, "only Stan could get away
with that." I swear to god.

2321
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:53,977
Well, the rumor is
that he got the coke from the cops.

2322
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,167
Not that cop. There was another cop
he knew in Manhattan.

2323
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:58,773
No, no, no, no! Coke? What?

2324
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:00,897
Guys, guys, guys. Guys, it's his dad.

2325
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:02,819
So? I didn't know it was a secret.

2326
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:06,069
You can't just tease me with that.
Please, guys. You don't understand.

2327
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:09,305
My mom tells me all these stories about
how he's like a Saint and all that shit.

2328
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:10,865
I would love to hear a coke story.

2329
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:13,368
- The pg-13 version.
- No, the real version.

2330
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:16,104
You don't understand the pressure
I'm under, thinking this guy's perfect.

2331
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:18,335
All right, fuck it.
We were coked out of our minds.

2332
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:21,414
- Nice.
- We all were. Well, I mean, we were.

2333
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:23,444
But that was a different time.
I mean, we all did it.

2334
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:26,050
This guy was the cokehead.
You were the cokehead.

2335
01:51:26,138 --> 01:51:28,003
I stopped four years ago. You know that.

2336
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:31,716
- How do you think he stayed this skinny?
- I have a high metabolism.

2337
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:34,222
They should have his face
on a nickel in Bolivia.

2338
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:41,608
But playtime was playtime, all right?
Like, you know...

2339
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:46,780
When he was at work, he was all,
you know, business, all right?

2340
01:51:46,867 --> 01:51:49,984
And he was the guy you wanted by
your side if you were going into a fire.

2341
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:53,366
I mean, if they were gonna
build a fireman from scratch...

2342
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:56,414
He would've been, you know...

2343
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:58,207
- Prototype.
- Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

2344
01:51:58,295 --> 01:51:59,705
Top to bottom.

2345
01:52:01,048 --> 01:52:03,004
He's a fireman. You know?

2346
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:05,503
As brave as they come. Yeah.

2347
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:10,220
You know, I was thinking about
what you said at the game

2348
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:13,891
about, you know,
firemen shouldn't have kids.

2349
01:52:16,188 --> 01:52:17,303
Let me tell you something.

2350
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:21,731
Your dad, he didn't just die
saving those two people that night.

2351
01:52:21,818 --> 01:52:23,399
I mean, he did that a lot.

2352
01:52:24,529 --> 01:52:26,520
Sometimes,
he wouldn't even wait for the line.

2353
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:30,858
He'd just go in a fully involved room,
and you're like, "what are you doing?"

2354
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:34,912
Because if he heard there was
somebody in there, he'd just go in.

2355
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:37,614
That's the way...

2356
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:40,166
That's who he was.
That's how he was built, you know?

2357
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:42,290
He couldn't not be that way.

2358
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:45,581
You understand?

2359
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:48,842
Thank you. No, thank you for sharing.

2360
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:50,972
That's awesome.

2361
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,132
He would slap the shit out of me
if he heard me say this about him,

2362
01:52:55,227 --> 01:52:56,842
but he was a hero.

2363
01:52:58,272 --> 01:52:59,762
And heroes are necessary.

2364
01:53:00,816 --> 01:53:03,478
And they should be allowed
to have families, all right?

2365
01:53:03,568 --> 01:53:08,312
But I know it means, you know,
that people suffer.

2366
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:11,148
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2367
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:15,031
Well, I'm sorry for being a dick.

2368
01:53:15,122 --> 01:53:17,989
There's two sides to every story.

2369
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:20,995
Thank you for sharing with me.
Thanks for taking me here.

2370
01:53:21,086 --> 01:53:24,203
We don't have to get all Oprah
and everything. It's all right.

2371
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:26,129
- Hey, to Stan.
- Yeah, to Stan.

2372
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,626
- Stan.
- Stan.

2373
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:28,718

2384
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:16,380
So what are you gonna do?

2385
01:54:18,393 --> 01:54:19,508
With what?

2386
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:22,720
With your life.

2387
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:26,394
You must be passionate about something.

2388
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,319
Um, yeah, the tattoo thing.

2389
01:54:32,157 --> 01:54:33,192
I love that.

2390
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:36,491
Were you, like, into that?

2391
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:41,201
No, it takes a lot of practice,
you know, and...

2392
01:54:43,043 --> 01:54:45,750
None of my friends will let me
tattoo them anymore and...

2393
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:48,529
Hey, why don't you give me a tattoo?

2394
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,336
What? What?

2395
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:56,921
Come on, I don't have any tattoos.
I'm a blank slate, man.

2396
01:54:57,015 --> 01:54:59,552
Put it on my back.
Yeah, use it for practice.

2397
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,847
You're just saying this
'cause you're drunk, right?

2398
01:55:02,938 --> 01:55:05,554
Isn't everybody drunk
when they get their first tattoo?

2399
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:08,606
Touche, ray. Yeah.

2400
01:55:09,069 --> 01:55:11,651
It's my back. I don't give a fuck.
I'm never gonna see it.

2401
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:14,528
Plus, I got to tell you something,
you know?

2402
01:55:15,742 --> 01:55:18,484
I saw that drawing you did for Harold.

2403
01:55:20,372 --> 01:55:22,533
I was kind of blown away by it, man.

2404
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:25,286
You're getting really good at it.

2405
01:55:25,669 --> 01:55:26,909
I'm practicing a lot.

2406
01:55:27,546 --> 01:55:28,706
Yeah.

2407
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:32,672
Like anything, you keep doing it,
you get better at it. And I, you know...

2408
01:55:33,468 --> 01:55:38,007
I do want to see you do well, all right?
I believe in you.

2409
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:40,759
Thanks, man.

2410
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:43,428
You must really love me.

2411
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:45,514
I love you, too.

2412
01:55:49,526 --> 01:55:52,643
- I appreciate that, but I'm not ready...
- You gonna say it back?

2413
01:55:52,737 --> 01:55:54,337
I'm not ready
to say something like that.

2414
01:55:54,406 --> 01:55:56,943
You gotta say it back.
What if I die tomorrow?

2415
01:55:58,452 --> 01:56:02,741
Then I'll be that guy saying,
"even though I never said it..."

2416
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:09,118
I would love to tattoo your back.

2417
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:10,702
Okay, cool.

2418
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:15,632
All right, but here's the deal.
No unicorns, no rainbows, all right?

2419
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:18,176
None of that shit
little girls like to color in.

2420
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:20,675
- Okay.
- No body parts. No nudity.

2421
01:56:20,765 --> 01:56:22,130
- Okay.
- No Chinese letters.

2422
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:23,340
All right, fine.

2423
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:25,580
I want to be able to fucking read
whatever you put back there.

2424
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:28,437
I don't need some order
for orange chicken or some shit.

2425
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:30,232
All right.

2426
01:56:30,567 --> 01:56:31,682
Here we go. You ready?

2427
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:33,482
Yep, let's do it.
Let's get it over with.

2428
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:37,404
Yeah, I really appreciate this.
This is... it's actually very nice.

2429
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:39,606
- Good.
- All right.

2430
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,368
Ah! Fuck.

2431
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:49,412
Dude, why do you get these?

2432
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:55,040
Um, I don't know. Whenever I'm going
through something, I just get one.

2433
01:56:55,133 --> 01:56:58,341
It relaxes me and calms me down.
Helps me think things through.

2434
01:56:58,428 --> 01:57:00,384
This relaxes you? Yeah.

2435
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:05,599
You ever think of taking a yoga class?
Meditating?

2436
01:57:06,436 --> 01:57:09,678
Why don't you just give blood?
There's still needles involved.

2437
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:12,560
Yeah, that's a nice tattoo. It's aces.

2438
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,796
You looking at my cards,
you piece of shit?

2439
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:17,798
What? No, no, no, no.
I'm talking about the tattoo.

2440
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:18,937
What are you doing? “What?

2441
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:21,239
First good hand you dealt me all night,
you're cheating?

2442
01:57:21,326 --> 01:57:25,069
- He was talking about the tattoo.
- You are the worst liar ever.

2443
01:57:25,163 --> 01:57:26,869
What's six times four?

2444
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,072
Twenty-four.

2445
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:30,122
Twenty-four. Yeah, 24.

2446
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:31,996
What's seven times five?

2447
01:57:34,798 --> 01:57:38,632
- Thirty-five.
- Good job. Look how smart you are.

2448
01:57:38,718 --> 01:57:41,676
I'm trying to guess what you're drawing
by the way your hand's going.

2449
01:57:42,097 --> 01:57:43,758
Remember, nothing weird
or I'll kill you.

2450
01:57:43,848 --> 01:57:45,429
- Nothing weird.
- Okay.

2451
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:48,101
- It doesn't look weird, does it?
- No, not at all.

2452
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:50,518
Oh, good,
'cause you know I'll murder him.

2453
01:57:50,981 --> 01:57:52,096
It looks wonderful.

2454
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:56,232
Is it supposed to hurt...
Is it supposed to hurt that much?

2455
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:58,310
It's a needle going into your back.
Yeah.

2456
01:57:58,405 --> 01:58:01,363
I know, but I thought
I had more back fat than that.

2457
01:58:01,908 --> 01:58:03,023
Can I get a tattoo?

2458
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:04,198
- No. No.
- Sure.

2459
01:58:04,286 --> 01:58:05,947
- All right.
- No. Never.

2460
01:58:06,037 --> 01:58:07,368
Don't mess with perfection.

2461
01:58:11,418 --> 01:58:13,563
Everybody goes.
Both companies, first due.

2462
01:58:13,587 --> 01:58:15,703
Phone alarm. Box 3-4-3.

2463
01:58:15,797 --> 01:58:18,789
18 carpenter Avenue
between Rockland and Franklin.

2464
01:58:18,883 --> 01:58:20,669
Smoke coming from
the second floor window

2465
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,125
of a private home. Turnout.

2466
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:39,935
Yoo-hoo.

2467
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:41,361
Excuse me. Yeah?

2468
01:58:41,448 --> 01:58:42,563
Hey, man. How you doing?

2469
01:58:42,657 --> 01:58:43,487
What's up, man?

2470
01:58:43,575 --> 01:58:45,611
I need some assistance
over here, please.

2471
01:58:45,702 --> 01:58:47,488
Sure, I... oh, my god!

2472
01:58:47,579 --> 01:58:50,946
Don't worry about it.
Listen, everything's all good.

2473
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:53,373
It's really nothing.
I just need a little assistance.

2474
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:54,895
This is something that needs
to be taken care of now.

2475
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:57,376
What happened?
Did you get shot? Were you stabbed?

2476
01:58:57,464 --> 01:59:00,797
It's not really a big deal.
My vape exploded in my pocket.

2477
01:59:01,343 --> 01:59:06,258
I didn't stretch right before yoga.
I was playing tennis. I slipped.

2478
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:08,242
- Well, which one is it?
- What do you want me to say?

2479
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:09,266
It was nothing.

2480
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:12,767
I just need some medical attention,
but just by you.

2481
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:15,061
Dude, I gotta call 911.
I don't know what to do.

2482
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:18,515
No, listen, listen.
No police, please. Not today.

2483
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,225
- What does that even mean?
- No.

2484
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,027
We don't need to get the government
involved into this situation.

2485
01:59:23,114 --> 01:59:24,354
We can handle this together.

2486
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:26,440
Dude, I'm so high.
I can't help you right now.

2487
01:59:26,534 --> 01:59:28,115
I'm high, too.

2488
01:59:28,787 --> 01:59:30,698
Well, then you know how I feel.

2489
01:59:31,206 --> 01:59:32,867
What do you want me to do?

2490
01:59:32,957 --> 01:59:34,072
Take a look at this.

2491
01:59:34,584 --> 01:59:35,994
I need some sort of foam.

2492
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:37,688
- Holy shit! Dude!
- You got some stitching?

2493
01:59:37,712 --> 01:59:40,829
Do you have a little needle
that you could do needlepoint?

2494
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:42,084
What happened?

2495
01:59:42,175 --> 01:59:44,006
It was a misunderstanding.
It was an argument.

2496
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:46,085
But we're all friends again.
We worked it out.

2497
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,259
You know how buddies get.

2498
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:50,510
Dude, we gotta take you to the hospital
or you're gonna die.

2499
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,680
I'm not gonna die.

2500
01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:52,995
- Yes, you are.
- I'm gonna die?

2501
01:59:53,019 --> 01:59:56,557
Yeah, I'm positive that you're gonna die
if we don't go to the hospital.

2502
02:00:03,488 --> 02:00:05,979
- Are there metal detectors in here?
- I'm not sure. Why?

2503
02:00:06,074 --> 02:00:08,861
Don't even worry about it.
I'll tell you later.

2504
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:10,529
Oh, shit.

2505
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:15,038
- Oh, fuck. Oh, my god.
- You'll be all right.

2506
02:00:15,125 --> 02:00:16,615
Guys, I need help!

2507
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,621
This guy's bleeding!
He's losing a lot of blood!

2508
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:20,873
- I need a gurney, please!
- Oh, thank you.

2509
02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:23,250
- All right, just put pressure on it.
- Thank you.

2510
02:00:24,467 --> 02:00:26,799
Hi. This guy's been
either shot or stabbed.

2511
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:28,296
He's been kind of vague about it.

2512
02:00:28,388 --> 02:00:30,549
Sir, have you been shot? Stabbed?

2513
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:33,222
No. I fell in a Thorn bush.

2514
02:00:33,309 --> 02:00:35,800
Okay. Have him fill out this paperwork.

2515
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:37,977
The doctor will call you
when he's ready.

2516
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:41,602
Do me a favor, man.
Can we just switch identities?

2517
02:00:41,693 --> 02:00:44,150
- What? No.
- Just let me use your driver's license.

2518
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:47,479
- We look nothing alike, dude.
- No one's gonna know. Just trust me.

2519
02:00:47,574 --> 02:00:49,906
I'm bleeding.
It feels like I have to shit.

2520
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:52,029
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2521
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,361
I'm Margie's son. Do you know...
I'm Margie's son.

2522
02:00:54,456 --> 02:00:58,540
I don't know who that is.
I'm just filling in.

2523
02:00:58,626 --> 02:01:02,118
- Okay. I know.
- My pain keeps coming.

2524
02:01:02,213 --> 02:01:04,920
Tell that fucking cocksucker,
my father, that I hate him

2525
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:07,590
and I love him at the same time
and I forgive him.

2526
02:01:07,677 --> 02:01:10,293
I do not need to do that,
because you're gonna live.

2527
02:01:11,765 --> 02:01:14,131
Tell my sister I know she's my mother.

2528
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:17,926
Got here as soon as I could.

2529
02:01:18,772 --> 02:01:20,854
Hey, man, we got to help this guy.
He's bleeding out.

2530
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:23,773
This a cop? He looks like a cop.

2531
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:27,068
Excuse me, ma'am. Ray bishop, ladder 57.

2532
02:01:27,155 --> 02:01:29,550
We got to get this guy some help.
We got to move it along here.

2533
02:01:29,574 --> 02:01:30,984
- Follow me.
- Okay, come on, buddy.

2534
02:01:31,075 --> 02:01:33,942
Come on, come on, come on.
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

2535
02:01:34,037 --> 02:01:35,243
All right.

2536
02:01:36,539 --> 02:01:37,619
Abdominal wound!

2537
02:01:37,707 --> 02:01:39,059
There we go.

2538
02:01:39,083 --> 02:01:40,414
Where? Where?

2539
02:01:40,502 --> 02:01:41,582
Put him in two.

2540
02:01:41,669 --> 02:01:42,829
In two.

2541
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:45,128
- Let's get vitals.
- All right, buddy.

2542
02:01:45,215 --> 02:01:46,859
Right here.
We gotta get your shirt off.

2543
02:01:46,883 --> 02:01:48,464
Let me know if you need trauma.

2544
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,633
- Oh, shit.
- Okay. Here we go.

2545
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:53,080
- Nice and easy, nice and easy.
- I'll meet you at six. Six.

2546
02:01:55,183 --> 02:01:57,139
You okay? It's gonna be okay.

2547
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:07,559
- This one of your friends?
- No, no. I was just helping him.

2548
02:02:08,112 --> 02:02:09,112
Scott brought him in.

2549
02:02:09,197 --> 02:02:12,155
Guy just kind of wandered into the
firehouse while we were out on a call.

2550
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:15,658
You guys are covered in blood.
Take these off. Throw 'em here.

2551
02:02:18,665 --> 02:02:19,950
Put 'em over here.

2552
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,953
Just leave 'em there. Down there.
What's that?

2553
02:02:23,878 --> 02:02:25,743
- What's that?
- Oh.

2554
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:29,126
I let your son practice on me.

2555
02:02:29,801 --> 02:02:31,737
How's it look?
He won't let me see it till it's done.

2556
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:32,921
Let me see it.

2557
02:02:39,936 --> 02:02:43,679
He, uh...
He let me do whatever I wanted, so...

2558
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:47,481
Jesus Christ.

2559
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:50,443
He didn't put anything
stupid on there, did he?

2560
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:52,399
Took forever.

2561
02:03:11,009 --> 02:03:12,089
Nah.

2562
02:03:13,011 --> 02:03:14,217
Yeah,

2563
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:17,674
I can never get the eyes right 'cause
I just make them too dark, but I...

2564
02:03:18,349 --> 02:03:19,589
It's beautiful.

2565
02:03:21,019 --> 02:03:22,304
I'm proud of you.

2566
02:03:23,313 --> 02:03:25,395
- You could really do this.
- Thanks.

2567
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:28,188
There's not any Chinese characters
or anything back there, is there?

2568
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:33,148
No, no. No, no, no. You told me not to.

2569
02:03:33,656 --> 02:03:35,112
I would never disobey you.

2570
02:03:35,742 --> 02:03:37,573
Thank you for letting him do this, ray.

2571
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:40,777
Oh, I didn't do anything.
I just sat there. He did all the work.

2572
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:43,388
You liked going over the spine,
didn't ya?

2573
02:03:43,708 --> 02:03:45,073
Took it like a champ.

2574
02:03:45,168 --> 02:03:47,124
I sat there wincing.

2575
02:03:52,842 --> 02:03:55,379
Oh, my god.
Can we at least close the curtain?

2576
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:57,960
- My guys.
- Guys, people die in here.

2577
02:03:58,056 --> 02:04:00,138
- My guys. My guys.
- Come on.

2578
02:04:00,224 --> 02:04:02,681
Mom, I don't want to hug him.
He's not wearing a shirt.

2579
02:04:02,769 --> 02:04:05,101
- You can handle it.
- Dude, you're so smooth.

2580
02:04:05,188 --> 02:04:07,895
You're like a sea otter.

2581
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:09,919
Please, we have to stop.
We have to stop. Please. Please.

2582
02:04:09,943 --> 02:04:10,943
Please stop? Please stop.

2583
02:04:11,027 --> 02:04:13,564
But first, you will get fo
lord and lady stark and you will...

2584
02:04:13,655 --> 02:04:15,941
I hung out with ray
and the guys from the firehouse

2585
02:04:16,032 --> 02:04:17,693
the other night at the bar,

2586
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:20,651
and they were just telling
all these stories about dad.

2587
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:22,451
They were stories
I never heard of before,

2588
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:27,407
about him doing coke
and being hilarious.

2589
02:04:28,002 --> 02:04:29,002
Yeah. You know?

2590
02:04:29,045 --> 02:04:30,160
Yeah. Yeah.

2591
02:04:32,757 --> 02:04:34,338
Well, he was hilarious.

2592
02:04:35,009 --> 02:04:36,294
Yeah.

2593
02:04:36,803 --> 02:04:42,048
Uh, he was also out of control
and crazy.

2594
02:04:42,517 --> 02:04:44,974
- Do you understand?
- You can't

2595
02:04:45,561 --> 02:04:47,973
- why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

2596
02:04:48,731 --> 02:04:52,519
I wanted you to have some good memories
to offset what happened.

2597
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:53,895
I didn't know what to say.

2598
02:04:53,987 --> 02:04:57,730
Was I gonna say, "your dad
really loved watching cartoons with you

2599
02:04:57,824 --> 02:04:59,985
'cause he was tripping all the time"?

2600
02:05:00,076 --> 02:05:01,191
Yeah.

2601
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:03,742
Sounds like a good dad to me.

2602
02:05:04,706 --> 02:05:07,448
No, you know what? I get it.

2603
02:05:08,376 --> 02:05:13,040
Knowing that he had
his issues and... problems

2604
02:05:13,131 --> 02:05:16,589
just like everybody else,
it makes me feel better.

2605
02:05:16,676 --> 02:05:19,588
It really... it really humanizes him.

2606
02:05:21,014 --> 02:05:22,595
Well, he was a great guy.

2607
02:05:23,766 --> 02:05:25,597
He was a very complicated guy.

2608
02:05:27,895 --> 02:05:29,760
He had a really big heart.

2609
02:05:30,898 --> 02:05:33,105
- Mmm.
- Like ray?

2610
02:05:35,028 --> 02:05:39,943
Uh, yeah, I guess, like ray, yeah. Yeah.

2611
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:42,361
Yeah.

2612
02:05:43,494 --> 02:05:46,952
Um, I guess you could say
that you have a type.

2613
02:05:48,166 --> 02:05:50,282
Uh-huh. Yeah.

2614
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:54,119
I have a type.

2615
02:05:58,968 --> 02:06:04,088
I know we don't really talk
about it much, but...

2616
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:06,889
I, uh...

2617
02:06:08,019 --> 02:06:09,725
I miss dad.

2618
02:06:11,147 --> 02:06:12,728
A lot.

2619
02:06:18,321 --> 02:06:19,401
Yeah.

2620
02:06:21,699 --> 02:06:22,939
Me, too.

2621
02:06:30,374 --> 02:06:31,659
And, uh...

2622
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:41,087
I'm sorry that I've been
so difficult to deal with.

2623
02:06:43,096 --> 02:06:46,088
I'll try and get it together.

2624
02:06:46,849 --> 02:06:48,180
It's just hard.

2625
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:52,389
I think it'll always be hard.

2626
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,366
L, uh...

2627
02:07:08,162 --> 02:07:12,371
I really like ray, but he's gotta
lose that mustache. I mean, come on.

2628
02:07:13,668 --> 02:07:15,896
When we go out in public,
people think that I'm kidnapped.

2629
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,036
The looks that we get
at the supermarket.

2630
02:07:18,131 --> 02:07:20,838
They're like...
People look at me like, "are you okay?"

2631
02:07:20,925 --> 02:07:23,792
And I'm like, "yeah, no, yeah.
It's my mom's boyfriend."

2632
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:34,581
- All right, buddy, good luck.
- Thanks for the lift.

2633
02:07:34,605 --> 02:07:37,267
All right, man. Confidence, right?

2634
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:39,440
- Yeah.
- All right, go get 'em.

2635
02:07:42,155 --> 02:07:43,315
Hey.

2636
02:07:44,282 --> 02:07:46,022
Kelsey. Hi.

2637
02:07:46,826 --> 02:07:48,566
Hey. How are you?

2638
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:52,370
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I just wanted to talk to you.

2639
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:54,697
Well, I have
my civil service test today.

2640
02:07:54,792 --> 02:07:57,499
Oh, yeah, I remembered.
That's why I wanted to...

2641
02:07:57,587 --> 02:07:59,123
- I have to go.
- Can I come?

2642
02:07:59,213 --> 02:08:00,373
What? Why?

2643
02:08:00,464 --> 02:08:03,797
You know, for moral support.
I just want to be there for you.

2644
02:08:05,469 --> 02:08:06,754
Well, I can't stop you.

2645
02:08:06,846 --> 02:08:09,337
Oh, all right, great.
Your hair looks nice.

2646
02:08:09,974 --> 02:08:10,974
Thanks.

2647
02:08:23,863 --> 02:08:26,445
Listen, I know you probably
want to talk about relationship stuff

2648
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,397
and serious bullshit, but I can't.

2649
02:08:28,492 --> 02:08:31,825
I have to study and focus right now
so I don't screw this up.

2650
02:08:31,913 --> 02:08:34,154
Okay. I, um...

2651
02:08:34,248 --> 02:08:35,738
I could help you, if you like.

2652
02:08:36,542 --> 02:08:38,123
You don't want to help me.

2653
02:08:38,669 --> 02:08:40,409
Yeah, I do. I would love to.

2654
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:45,422
Okay, will you just test me
on this part?

2655
02:08:45,509 --> 02:08:47,215
Yeah. That one?

2656
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:49,627
- All right.
- Okay.

2657
02:08:49,722 --> 02:08:50,757
Here we go.

2658
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:54,052
"Amy must complete three tasks at work.

2659
02:08:54,143 --> 02:08:58,762
She estimates that the first two tasks
will take her 45 minutes to complete

2660
02:08:58,856 --> 02:09:02,519
and that the third task will take her
two hours and ten minutes to complete.

2661
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:04,475
If Amy's estimate is correct,

2662
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,811
how long will it take her
to complete all three tasks?"

2663
02:09:08,115 --> 02:09:10,777
Three hours and 40 minutes.

2664
02:09:10,868 --> 02:09:13,234
Did you just guess that
or did know the answer?

2665
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,695
No, that's correct.

2666
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:18,122
That's incredible. Wow.

2667
02:09:18,209 --> 02:09:19,209
It's not that amazing.

2668
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,708
- Itis.
- Relax.

2669
02:09:20,795 --> 02:09:23,036
Is it all math questions?
I thought it was city shit.

2670
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:26,171
No, no. You have to prove
that you're not stupid.

2671
02:09:26,259 --> 02:09:28,796
- And then you can work for the city.
- Oh!

2672
02:09:28,886 --> 02:09:30,797
So I can never work for the city.

2673
02:09:34,809 --> 02:09:36,640
Hey, I...

2674
02:09:36,727 --> 02:09:38,934
May I have your attention, please?

2675
02:09:39,021 --> 02:09:40,761
The ferry will be docking shortly.

2676
02:09:40,856 --> 02:09:41,856
I love you.

2677
02:09:42,608 --> 02:09:45,975
A lot. I always have, and I...

2678
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:48,774
That's why I always act so weird.

2679
02:09:49,657 --> 02:09:52,319
'Cause I don't know
how to express myself.

2680
02:09:57,373 --> 02:09:58,954
Should I ask the next? Yeah.

2681
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:02,207
All right, so, "of the 250 people

2682
02:10:02,295 --> 02:10:05,412
working at a medical facility,
16% are clerks.

2683
02:10:05,506 --> 02:10:06,712
How many are..."

2684
02:10:07,258 --> 02:10:10,091
Thank you for
riding the staten island ferry.

2685
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:21,935
I've lost my place.

2686
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:29,644
"Of the 250 people
working at a medical facility,

2687
02:10:29,739 --> 02:10:31,604
- 16% are clerks."
- Mmm-hmm.

2688
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:33,109
N re not clerks? "How many a

2689
02:10:33,784 --> 02:10:36,696
you're showing me the page.

2690
02:10:50,343 --> 02:10:51,958
Hey, will you wait for me while I do it

2691
02:10:52,053 --> 02:10:54,294
and then we can go back
to staten island together?

2692
02:10:54,388 --> 02:10:57,471
Yeah. Of course.
How long are you gonna be?

2693
02:10:57,558 --> 02:10:59,264
Three and a half hours.

2694
02:11:00,227 --> 02:11:01,227
All right.

2695
02:11:01,812 --> 02:11:03,848
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll go figure something out.

2696
02:11:03,939 --> 02:11:04,803
Okay.

2697
02:11:04,899 --> 02:11:07,390
All right. Cool. Good luck.

2698
02:11:10,738 --> 02:11:14,230
Maybe do something cultural.
Broaden your horizons.

2699
02:11:14,325 --> 02:11:16,941
All right. Good luck. Have fun.

2700
02:11:17,703 --> 02:11:18,943
Oh, my god, I'm freaking out!

2701
02:11:19,663 --> 02:11:20,903
And I'm scared.
