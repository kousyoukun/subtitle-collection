I love this movie.

38
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,321
They-they shot this
on Staten Island.

39
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:19,092
- - Whew!
- Oh!

40
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,293
- Oh!
- Ooh, God!

41
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:21,294
- Awesome.
- Hell yeah.

42
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:22,695
Ew!

43
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:23,896
That's my shit.

44
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,298
This movie makes no sense.

45
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,301
Why-why would the government
make a purge legal?

46
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:31,971
- Clearly to let them blow off some steam. Hello.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:35,108
- That's why you go to the spa.
- Yeah. Or the therapist.

48
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:37,343
- Or get your nails done.
- Or...

49
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:39,245
Or murder some folks. Hmm?

50
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:41,180
I mean, come on, guys.
I-I brought Tara over

51
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:43,116
so that we could
get out of this basement.

52
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,784
Let's go out.
Let's go dancing.

53
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:47,019
- I love dancing.
- Let's do something.

54
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,187
We don't go out.

55
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:49,356
We don't dance.

56
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,358
- <i>The Purge</i> is not enough for you?
- No.

57
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:52,359
Does anybody else like dancing?

58
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:53,393
- I like it.
- Yes, me!

59
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:54,394
- You do?
- I love dancing.

60
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:55,728
Yes.

61
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:57,163
He loves...
He's a really good dancer.

62
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:58,831
What's your favorite move?

63
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:01,435
It's kind of like a shake.

64
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,935
- A shake? That's...
- I don't know.

65
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,271
I just do whatever
the m-music tells me to do.

66
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,340
There's nothing but douchebags
at these clubs.

67
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:09,275
- I love it here, man. It's safe.
- Oh, but, come on.

68
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,910
God, you just sit here all day,

69
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:13,079
- and then smoke weed and jerk each other off.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:14,147
That sounds amazing.

71
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,215
I've never been jerked off
by any of my friends.

72
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:17,351
Me, either.

73
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:18,385
I like your tattoos.

74
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,986
- I knew you would, right?
- Those are...

75
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,421
- Oh, my God. That...
- No, don't talk to him.

76
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,423
- He has, he has chlamydia.
- I had.

77
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:25,459
- Oh, my God.
- Had chlamydia.

78
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:26,759
- It's curable.
- And you introduced me to

79
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:27,894
the girl that gave me chlamydia,

80
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,228
so you basically
gave me chlamydia.

81
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:30,696
You assisted the chlamydia.

82
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,632
He doesn't have insurance.

83
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:32,499
- He can't get the meds.
- It's fine.

84
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,300
I act... I actually did
some of those.

85
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,134
You did?

86
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:36,235
You know I got to rep
the island.

87
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,304
- Hey. - Staten Island.
- Wow, Staten.

88
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:40,407
- S.I., you know.
- Yeah.

89
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,842
- Looks so good.
- Thank you.

90
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,710
- You have a bunch of tattoos also.
- Yeah.

91
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:46,112
- What is that date?
- Oh. - OSCAR: Ooh.

92
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:48,114
Uh, that's, uh, the date
my Dad died.

93
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,950
Oh, my God, your dad died?
I'm so sorry.

94
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:53,152
Don't be. It's fine.
It's totally cool.

95
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:54,488
- So, what happened?
- Ooh!

96
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,788
- Okay, you don't need to ask.
- No.

97
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,457
- No, no, no, no.
- Don't ask that.

98
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,458
It's kind of inappropriate.

99
00:03:58,492 --> 00:03:59,859
Uh, he was a, he was a fireman.

100
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:02,028
So, he died in a fire.

101
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,063
Oh, my God.

102
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:06,232
- Yeah, we knew.
- Yeah, we knew.

103
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,000
- We don't like to talk about it.
- We knew.

104
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,369
That's why we don't bring it up.

105
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:11,270
- Apologize to Scott.
- It's the right thing to do.

106
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:13,440
- You should say sorry.
- Apologize or get out.

107
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,107
It's not okay.

108
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:18,878
Scott, um, I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry

109
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:21,481
- that I asked about your tattoo.
- Yeah.

110
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,453
What?

111
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:27,387
He doesn't care. It's fine.

112
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:28,388
- He doesn't care.
- Look at him.

113
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:30,790
- He's laughing so much.
- I don't care.

114
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:32,526
We talk about his dead dad
all the time.

115
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:37,230
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

116
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:38,197
Not your dad.

117
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:39,899
That's my favorite one.

118
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:41,435
Oh, my God, that's so funny.

119
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:42,969
We've made so many jokes
about it.

120
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:43,970
Oh, my God, I don't even...

121
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:46,339
- I don't even miss him at all.
- So funny.

122
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,374
Yeah.

123
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,081
Oh!

124
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:55,948
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's pretty good.

125
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:57,517
Keep-keep doing that!
Keep doing that!

126
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,951
Are-are you, are you happy?

127
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,120
Yes, yes, it's fucking great!
Keep going!

128
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:03,523
No, wait, d-d... don't stop!

129
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,329
Did you, um, did you,
did you come?

130
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:12,432
Well, yes.

131
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,500
Were you there?

132
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,369
Yeah, I did.

133
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,836
- Like, six times.
- Cool.

134
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,405
- Awesome.
- It was great.

135
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:20,039
- Did you?
- No, no, no.

136
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:22,542
But it's okay. I-I had fun.

137
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,976
I had fun back there.

138
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,311
Yeah.

139
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:27,947
You know, I feel bad
that you never do.

140
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,215
No, I-I do all the time.

141
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:31,884
I just... you know, I don't put
on a Broadway show like you do.

142
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,152
You know, I'm-I'm more quiet.

143
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:35,054
I'm more like Charlie Chaplin
when I come.

144
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,523
- Like a silent movie.
- Silent movie.

145
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,227
Um, do you think
it's the antidepressants?

146
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,429
Oh, yeah, for sure.

147
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,163
Yeah. If I didn't have
the antidepressants,

148
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:45,599
I'd come in, like,
eight seconds.

149
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:46,932
And then you wouldn't come.

150
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,334
And then you'd be depressed.

151
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:51,103
And then you would
have to take antidepressants.

152
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,107
- I don't know, can I say something? I, um...
- Yeah.

153
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:59,111
I just still don't understand
why this is such a big secret.

154
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,181
You know why it's a big secret.
'Cause it's special.

155
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:04,451
It's-it's, like, our thing,
you know?

156
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:08,187
It-it wouldn't be special
if everybody knew about it.

157
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,458
Yeah, but I don't
just want to do this.

158
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:14,126
Yeah, I totally get that.
So, should we stop?

159
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,294
No, I...

160
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:19,466
I don't know, like, this...
like, what is this?

161
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,033
- And I don't know why...
- This?

162
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,035
- This is...
- I want to do what normal people do.

163
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,571
Yeah, I know.
I just, you know, I...

164
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,105
It-it might be weird, you know.

165
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,074
We've known each other
for, like, ever.

166
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,376
Since fourth grade.

167
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,043
It would be like incest.

168
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:31,944
No, it wouldn't.

169
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,145
No, it's like, yeah,
w-we're best pals,

170
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:35,948
and I wouldn't want to, like,
jeopardize our friendship

171
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,552
or something like that
over something...

172
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:42,288
not silly, but, you know,
it's just... it's a big risk.

173
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,256
But we've already
done the deed.

174
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,393
- I mean, what else is there?
- "Done the deed"?

175
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:48,462
- I don't know.
- But, you know, it's just,

176
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,263
- you deserve somebody way better than me.
- What?

177
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,299
You're a good guy.

178
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:55,369
- You're a good guy. I like you.
- Uh...

179
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:56,302
Well, I... Based on what?

180
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:59,373
I mean, I like you, too.
It's just like...

181
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,242
All right, can I just tell you...
can I tell you something?

182
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,144
But can you, like,
not tell anybody?

183
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:08,347
Well, people probably know,
but, like...

184
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,550
There's, like,
something wrong with me.

185
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,985
- Like, mentally, like...
- What?

186
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,088
Like, I'm not okay up there.

187
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:18,124
You know? Like...

188
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:20,360
I-I get all mad,
acting, like, crazy,

189
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:23,697
and I, and I make really insane,
impulsive decisions.

190
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,365
And I get...

191
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,636
I'm d... I'm scared o-of myself,
and I don't...

192
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:31,638
I don't want to,
like, scare you or me

193
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,239
or, like, hurt anyone, you know?

194
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,341
So, I think
it would just be best

195
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:39,311
and really responsible of me
if I just backed off, you know?

196
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,717
I don't want you to f-feel
like that about yourself.

197
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,452
Oh, no, it's...

198
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:48,220
I just, I just don't want
to offend you, you know?

199
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:51,290
You're... you're the best.
I think you're the greatest.

200
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:54,193
I know you think I'm great.
I'm awesome.

201
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,264
I feel bad that you don't
think you're great.

202
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,076
♪ ♪

203
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,597
Hey, honey.

204
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,232
I made you an omelet.

205
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:37,437
What are you gonna wear to
your sister's graduation party?

206
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:41,475
I was thinking, what about
one of your dad's suits?

207
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:42,542
I don't know.

208
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,412
I-I don't think I'm really
a suit guy, you know?

209
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:48,080
Plus-plus, all those suits
are out of style, so...

210
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:51,083
You know, I thought
they were back in style.

211
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:55,020
And... can you not smoke pot
before the party?

212
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,222
Why?

213
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,257
Because it smells.
You smell bad.

214
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,427
And no vaping because
they're gonna think it's pot.

215
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,293
The uncle is a cop.

216
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,062
We don't need
that kind of trouble.

217
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,564
Fuck that guy.

218
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,366
I hate this family.

219
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,034
They're so rich and snooty.

220
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,604
They've been really nice
to Claire.

221
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,405
Hey, Mom. You got me
the plastic containers.

222
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:14,474
I just need the cardboard boxes
I can throw away.

223
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:16,776
But they're so good
for storing things.

224
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,512
Yeah, but I don't have
any storage.

225
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:20,447
My closet's, like, two feet wide.

226
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,517
Hey, Claire, do you even want me
at your graduation party?

227
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,386
Do I want you to go?
I don't care.

228
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,255
Just... It's weird
if you don't go.

229
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,490
That wasn't exactly
a warm invitation.

230
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,659
Yeah, well, it's not the part
I'm looking forward to most.

231
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,260
But I want you to be there.

232
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:36,262
- She wants you to go.
- No, she doesn't.

233
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:38,163
- She just said it.
- No, I don't want him to go.

234
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:40,534
He has to go.

235
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,202
Just don't sit on the couch
in the corner the whole time.

236
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:44,538
- It's weird.
- No, I don't see the problem

237
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:45,639
with sitting
in the corner, okay?

238
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,841
There's some people
that go to the party and dance,

239
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,776
and there's some people
that sit in the corner.

240
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:50,777
I'm the corner guy.

241
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,245
Accept your brother.

242
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,382
Also, don't try
to fuck Layla, okay?

243
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,149
She told you
she's not interested.

244
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,485
What are you talking about?

245
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:00,286
I never tried
to hook up with her.

246
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,122
She's always trying to fuck me,
and I-I have to avoid it

247
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:06,626
at all costs,
out of respect for you.

248
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,295
I just thought she looked
really good in those pants.

249
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,297
- Jesus.
- Thought that was a nice thing to say.

250
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,633
- Just don't.
- I didn't know I would get MeToo'd for it.

251
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,535
Dad's suits are vacuum-sealed
in the garage.

252
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,637
- Yeah?
- Just pick yourself a nice one.

253
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,171
You have to look nice.

254
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,340
We're celebrating
your sister's achievements.

255
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:23,710
You're gonna miss her
when she's gone.

256
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,580
Yeah. Celebrate me.

257
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,353
Wow, this, uh...
this all happened so fast.

258
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,521
I-I can't believe
you're graduating already.

259
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,126
I'm gonna really miss you.

260
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,368
Round two.

261
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,502
Fight!

262
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,571
Yo, where'd you get this?

263
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,640
This shit does not taste
very good.

264
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,442
What are you talking about?
This shit's fire, dawg.

265
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:31,378
Do you guys even really
get high anymore?

266
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:32,646
I-I don't really think
I get high anymore.

267
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,247
I think I just
kind of am myself.

268
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,182
I haven't been high
in a while, man.

269
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:38,685
But I still do it.

270
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,720
I like the lifestyle.

271
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:41,955
I'm mad high.

272
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,823
Yo, tell Scotty about

273
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:45,358
how you're being catfished.

274
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:46,225
- Who?
- You!

275
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,661
How you're being catfished, bro.

276
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:48,461
Tell him the truth.

277
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:49,763
You got a girlfriend?
What's up?

278
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:50,597
- No.
- Yeah.

279
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,331
- That's awesome.
- Yes.

280
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:53,633
Her name is Carla.

281
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,802
- We talk on the phone.
- Nah, dude.

282
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:58,605
Like, this girl, like,
slid into his DMs, and, like,

283
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:00,540
I don't know, she, like,
asked him out or whatever.

284
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:02,274
- But hundred percent a trick, dude.
- She...

285
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:03,643
- She's bad, but that's not yours.
- Why?

286
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:05,310
And she's, like, so hot, dude.

287
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:07,312
Yo, she, like,
hangs out on yachts.

288
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:08,448
- Like, yo.
- Oh, come on.

289
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:09,916
- No, no, like, no.
- Dude...

290
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:10,817
Like, it's not real, like...

291
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,519
Bro, they're just
being jealous, bro.

292
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:13,920
They're just jealous
'cause you're getting that...

293
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:15,388
Oh, yeah, that's a catfish.

294
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,289
Oh, you getting catfished
like a motherfucker!

295
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,458
- Oh, my God!
- Right, dude?

296
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,859
- Bro...
- What does she...

297
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:22,462
Straight up, I'm-a send myself
this one, honestly.

298
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:25,297
Honestly, dude,
she's fucking fake.

299
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,933
She thinks I'm hot.

300
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:29,301
How? You guys never even
seen each other.

301
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,570
How come you guys
don't FaceTime?

302
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:32,505
Tell Scotty
why you don't FaceTime.

303
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,808
Her phone camera's broken, but
she sent me all these photos.

304
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,609
- Yeah.
- Bro, these are Google Images.

305
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,343
- Exactly, dude.
- Shit, you don't know that.

306
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:39,779
Maybe-maybe this girl is,
uh, is into Igor.

307
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,415
Well, you know,
he's-he's, you know, cute.

308
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,918
Yo, like, you don't even
know how to talk to girls.

309
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,686
What do you even
talk to her about?

310
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:49,589
- Igor.
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:52,425
Go get that shit, bro.
What are you doing?

312
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,427
Yo, he is the worst assistant.

313
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:55,595
He's clearly
going through a lot.

314
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,764
How much for, like, six Xanax?

315
00:12:57,797 --> 00:12:58,898
Six.

316
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,600
What do we have?
What do we have?

317
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:03,302
- Who needs six Xanax?
- I got one, two...

318
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:04,738
I got three right here, I think.

319
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:05,772
One, two...

320
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:07,907
Is this a... Yeah.

321
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,609
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

322
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:12,277
Yo, you're Jimmy Bags' brother,
right?

323
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:14,848
Yes, bro.

324
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:18,017
Tell your brother he's a bitch.

325
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:19,953
- You understand that?
- Yeah. I do.

326
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:22,689
- Say it back to me.
- He's a bitch. He's a bitch.

327
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:24,691
And now, you know what?

328
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,593
I got four,
but you're paying for six.

329
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,428
Nah, come on.
That's my fucking brother, bro.

330
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:29,929
- Like, what are you...
- Nah. Nah, dude.

331
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:30,930
I hate your brother.

332
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:32,966
And now you look like
a little version of him,

333
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,567
and I want to punch you
in the face.

334
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,437
So, instead of doing that,
just give me 60.

335
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,638
I only got 40.

336
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:40,406
Then go home, do chores,
and come back.

337
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,508
- I don't give a fuck.
- I-I can't.

338
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,343
I stole it from my mom's purse,
but she only had 40.

339
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,746
Well, then, give me your shoes.

340
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,881
No, bro, I can't.

341
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,582
Just give me your shoes
and we'll call it a day.

342
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:52,051
- Hey, what size are you?
- Like, a nine.

343
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,119
Those'll fit you.

344
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:54,687
- Igor, you can have those.
- I'll take 'em.

345
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:55,822
Look at that, Igor got a gift.

346
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:57,857
- He's not a fucking nine.
- Fuck you!

347

You don't make fun of my friend!

348

He-he can't get on
fucking roller coasters,

349
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,494
- he's that small.
- Shut the fuck up! - Whoa!

350
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:02,529
- We make fun of him!
- How is he gonna wear them?

351
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:04,731
- You don't make fun of him!
- He's our friend.

352
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,466
He rides roller coasters
all the time.

353
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,101
We make fun of him, not you.

354

Oh, no.

What? I told you
to wear Dad's suit.

I don't want to wear
Dad's old suit, okay?

362
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,818

363
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,953
- Don't do that!
- I-I don't want to wear a suit, okay?

I think, I think I'm gonna throw up.

00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:55,862
If you're good at it,
you can become a waiter.

467
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:57,830
Why are you offering me
a job anyway?

468
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:01,300
Because I told your father
I'd always look out for you.

469
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,269
How?
He died suddenly in a fire.

470
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:05,004
Uh, did you ask his ghost?

471
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:07,340
That's not witty, Scott.

472
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:09,342
Your dark sense of humor
doesn't work for me.

473
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:10,309
I find it funny.

474
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:13,746
It's your sister's big day.
Be a gentleman.

475
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:17,917
Okay, we lost a few guys
in an ICE raid.

476
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,919
Ah, shit. Sorry.

477
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:21,821
Maybe you should work
and go to college.

478
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:24,924
- College is bullshit!
- Oh.

479
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:26,926
You know who went to Harvard?
The Unabomber.

480
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,929
You know who went to Temple?
Bill Cosby.

481
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:32,231
You know who else who went
to Temple? Ted Bundy.

482
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:35,701
You know who went to Hofstra?
Bernie Madoff.

483
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,171
You know who went to Wharton?
Donald Trump.

484
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,672
It's all a scam.

485
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,009
Okay, well, maybe
I shouldn't go, then.

486
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,711
Oh, no, you'll have
the time of your life.

487
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:48,047
<i>Hey, Scott.</i>

488
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,883
Sit down.

489
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,051
Okay.

490
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,586
I got you this.

491
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:06,899
So, what-what is, uh,
what is, what is this?

492
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:09,602
It's paintbrushes
and some paint.

493
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,106
Well, I know you're into art,
so I thought you could

494
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,974
expand your horizons
while I'm gone.

495
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:17,910
You got a gift receipt for this?

496
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:20,113
- You okay?
- Fine... Yeah.

497
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,381
Wh-What do you mean?
Yeah, I'm...

498
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:22,549
You gonna be okay
without me here?

499
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,751
What, you don't think I can
survive here without you?

500
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:27,253
Okay, just don't be
a dick, okay?

501
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:30,156
Like, be nice to Mom, okay?
Don't give her a hard time.

502
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:32,392
- She deserves a break.
- I always give her a-a break.

503
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:35,061
What are you... When's...
When am I gonna get my break?

504
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:36,229
Like...

505
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,697
What are you talking about?

506
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,866
All anyone ever does
is worry about you.

507
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:41,934
I was ignored my entire
childhood 'cause of you.

508
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,371
Oh, yeah, I forgot that
my childhood was so dandy.

509
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:46,205
Okay, you don't get
to act crazy your whole life

510
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,273
just 'cause Dad died, okay?

511
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:48,841
At least you got to know him.

512
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,209
Well, you're lucky you didn't
get to know him, okay?

513
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:51,811
'Cause that's why
you're almost normal.

514
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,779
If you got to know him,
you would've known that he was,

515
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,748
like, the fucking
coolest guy ever,

516
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:57,750
and that would've
ruined the rest of your life.

517
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:59,419
Okay, like,
but what are you gonna do?

518
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,688
Are you gonna get a job or
are you gonna leave the house?

519
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:03,856
I don't know.

520
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,393
I-I'm gonna open
that tattoo restaurant.

521
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,127
No, like, for real.

522
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:09,095
I am being real.

523
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:10,930
It's a great...
It's never been done before.

524
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:12,298
I looked it up.
I googled it.

525
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:14,133
It's never been done,
not even as a joke.

526
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,302
Because no one wants
to go to a restaurant

527
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,804
and watch people get tattooed
while they eat.

528
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,840
- It's gross.
- It's the best idea ever.

529
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:23,142
Ruby Tattoosdays,
where everyone's welcome.

530
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:25,044
- Chicken and tattoos.
- That's not a business!

531
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,913
You know, you got to get
your shit together.

532
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:28,181
Time is passing by very quickly.

533
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:30,283
That's why I smoke weed
all the time, okay?

534
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,351
It slows it all down.

535
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:34,020
Fucking God.

536
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,922
See, I'm worried about you.

537
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:37,790
Well, why now?
You never gave a shit.

538
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:39,792
You, like, literally never
cared until this second.

539
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:40,993
Like, wh-what, what gives?

540
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:42,828
You never looked out
for me once.

541
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:43,664
You're my older brother.

542
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:45,164
You're supposed
to look out for me.

543
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:46,933
You're-you're just guilty
'cause you're leaving?

544
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,301
Now, all of a sudden,
you're afraid I'm gonna die?

545
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,903
I was gonna die anyway,
whether you stay or not.

546
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:53,005
- Are you gonna hurt yourself?
- Probably.

547
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,508
Yeah, I'm probably
gonna hurt myself.

548
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,309
I don't know how, but yeah.

549
00:20:57,777 --> 00:21:01,047
If anybody could do it, it's me.

550
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,916
This is why I don't talk to you,
'cause the one thing I know is

551
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,420
you're not gonna listen
to my advice, so...

552
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:07,787
Yeah, well, why would I?

553
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,955
Like, you don't even
give a shit.

554
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:09,789
You're-you're leaving.

555
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:10,890
You're not even
part of the family.

556
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:13,326
I'm the only fucking
normal person in this family.

557
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,094
Jesus. You know...

558
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,763
Every second I'm away from you,
I'm worrying about you.

559
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:19,232
That's what you do to people.

560
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,266
You should be worried.

561
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,103
Okay, don't fucking
ruin college for me, okay?

562
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,104
Go!

563
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,305
Fine.

564
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,508
Hey, you should bring that
chipper personality to college.

565
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,276
Guys will love it.

566
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,312
Hello.

567
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:41,187
Okay, let's see my to-do list.

568
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,156
Yo, we're finished
packing the car.

569
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,259
You want to come out
and say goodbye or...?

570
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,528
Oh, well, yeah,
this is almost over.

571
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:50,530
No, like, we're leaving.

572
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:52,532
- Oh. She's leaving?
- Like, to go to college, you know?

573
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,133
- Oh, oh, my bad.
- Yeah, four years, so...

574
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,002
- Oh, all right.
- Let's go.

575
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,372
Nope, like... Go. Come on.

576
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,306
Uh, don't worry about me, okay?

577
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,576
This is really hard right now.

578
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,877
You don't seem fine.

579
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,913
I'm so proud of you.

580
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:12,419
I love you.

581
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:13,420
Uh, okay.

582
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,857
You're the light of my life.

583
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,426
Oh.

584
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:20,427
Okay.

585
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:25,298
Thanks for helping us
pack the car.

586
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,265
I'm sorry.

587
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,968
I didn't realize
you guys were done already.

588
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:31,605
Be nice to Mom.

589
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:34,173
And please respond to my texts.

590
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:36,008
I will. Don't worry about it.

591
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:39,812
And, um... I-I'll come
visit you at some point.

592
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:43,015
Okay. All right.

593
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:44,250
Yeah.

594
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:46,285
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

595
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,122
Fly.

596
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,399
♪ Keep on hoping we'll eat ♪

597
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,401
♪ Cake by the ocean ♪

598
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:03,969
♪ Talk to me, baby... ♪

599
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:14,614
Hey.

600
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:16,916
Hey.

601
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:18,618
Uh...

602
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,655
I was thinking of finally
seeing that <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

603
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:23,657
Should I binge it?

604
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,224
Oh, it's a,
it's a pretty violent show.

605
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:27,126
You sure you could watch that?

606
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,596
I work in an emergency room.

607
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:30,597
Right, yeah.

608
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,433
So, you could probably handle
a good pillage.

609
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,368
Yeah.

610
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:37,269
Okay, well, maybe
I'll start watching it.

611
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:38,538
- Yeah.
- You watch it with me?

612
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:43,109
Um, well, I actually just kind
of finished it, so I-I don't...

613
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:45,612
It's really fresh in my mind,
so I-I would probably...

614
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:46,813
- Okay.
- I can watch some of them.

615
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:49,683
Uh, I don't think I can watch
all of them again, but...

616
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:51,518
- Well...
- I'll see you later, then.

617
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,520
All right.

618
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,522
Uh, are you okay?

619
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:58,525
Or...

620
00:23:58,558 --> 00:23:59,659
Oh. Yeah?

621
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:00,660
Come on.

622
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,462
Uh, it's, it-it's...

623
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:04,029
It's okay. It's...

624
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,198
I-I'm here. Uh, I'm here.

625
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:08,502
Don't-don't worry about it.

626
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:09,369
She's, you know...

627
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:11,538
Well, she's only, like,
45 minutes away,

628
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,007
and she'll-she'll probably
call in, like, five minutes.

629
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:17,544
But, hey.

630
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:20,079
You still got me, right?

631
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,082
Yeah.

632
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,154
Oh, shit.

633
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:30,189
Hey, hey!

634
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:34,126
See, you got to
hold it like this.

635
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,729
Let's see. Oh.

636
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:38,330
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh!

637
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:40,734
Hey, hey, wait. Hey, hey, guys.

638
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,736
Look, look.

639
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:44,103
You can't be here, man.

640
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,572
- Y-You got to go.
- Why?

641
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:48,107
It's private property,
that's why.

642
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,309
It's an abandoned orphanage.
Why can't we be here?

643
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:51,678
Who gives a shit, man?

644
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,813
What are you doing here?

645
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:54,448
You fucking protecting
the ghosts of dead orphans?

646
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:57,451
Look, fat Kanye,
shut your damn mouth.

647
00:24:57,484 --> 00:25:00,152
I'll be back in five minutes
for you assholes.

648
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:02,321
If you're still here,
I'm calling the cops, period.

649
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,491
You better get the cops, man,
'cause you're a fake cop.

650
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,359
- You need the real ones.
- Motherfuckers.

651
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:08,595
- Fuck all of y'all.
- I feel bad.

652
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,062
We-we were a little too mean.

653
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:11,631
- Yeah.
- He's nice.

654
00:25:11,665 --> 00:25:12,833
Yeah, he's a really good guy.

655
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:17,471
See, that guy... that is what is
wrong with Staten Island.

656
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:20,640
We don't get any cool people
from any of the other boroughs.

657
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:21,741
No one comes here.

658
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:24,210
We're stuck with the
fucking pricks that live here.

659
00:25:24,243 --> 00:25:26,011
You're talking about us.

660
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:27,246
Right in front of us.

661
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,247
Yeah, kinda.

662
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,683
I mean, no one comes here.

663
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:31,718
There's no flow of people.
That guy's, like, 200.

664
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:33,185
We've known him
since we were six.

665
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:34,754
Why can't we be cool
like Brooklyn?

666
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:37,089
There's no reason we shouldn't
be cool like Brooklyn.

667
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:39,392
We got amazing views.
It's close to the city.

668
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:41,595
It's cheap. Nice people.
It makes no sense.

669
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:44,230
We're, like, the only place
that New Jersey looks down on.

670
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:47,166
You could see the garbage dump from space.

671
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,635
This place is
never gonna change.

672
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,336
No, it happened to
the Meatpacking District,

673
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,270
the Village.

674
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:53,406
Brooklyn used to be
a fucking shithole.

675
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,273
We are next.

676
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,307
I'm gonna take
my civil service test.

677
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:57,644
I'm gonna work in the city,
in city planning.

678
00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,779
You watch, this place is gonna
be like fucking Williamsburg

679
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:02,449
- in ten years.
- No, all right? No. Nobody wants that.

680
00:26:02,482 --> 00:26:04,784
Why do you want to work in
the city and do city planning?

681
00:26:04,818 --> 00:26:05,785
That sounds so boring.

682
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,319
I feel like Brooklyn is better.

683
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:09,054
I dated a guy
that lived in Brooklyn.

684
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:10,122
He was a mixologist.

685
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,692
He made ice cubes out of milk.

686
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:14,794
- He was so classy.
- Shut up!

687
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:16,763
I love Staten Island.

688
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:17,731
It's amazing.

689
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:19,799
And people are gonna
see it soon, trust me.

690
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,401
Well, if you love it so much,

691
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:23,102
why don't you let me
tattoo it on you?

692
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:25,104
No, I'm not gonna let you
tattoo me again.

693
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:26,105
Fine.

694
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:29,174
Well, I need somebody to tattoo.

695
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,544
I'm, I-I'm running out of...

696
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:32,144
Come on, Rich.
What about you, man?

697
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,213
- Don't even look at me, dude.
- Why?

698
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,148
Your work is mad inconsistent.

699
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:37,417
Obama ain't right.

700
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,818
I got the eyes wrong, okay?

701
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:39,786
He's not right.

702
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,254
All right, man,
this has hurt me, all right?

703
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:43,623
I don't have
any black friends anymore.

704
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:45,592
I can't go to
a barber shop no more.

705
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:48,495
You got Obama wrong.
Ain't nothing worse than that.

706
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:50,830
What about you, Igor?
You want a dragon or something?

707
00:26:50,864 --> 00:26:52,532
Oh, I love your tattoos.

708
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:53,667
My brother?

709
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,834
It's a spitting image.

710
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:56,403
- Yeah. It's one of the best.
- It's my favorite.

711
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:57,837
No, no, no, no.
This is my favorite.

712
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:58,939
Oh, you killed that.

713
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:00,473
- Yeah, I really worked hard on the eyes.
- Just...

714
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:02,609
He's so cute.
I love his butthole.

715
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:04,544
It reminds me that I have
a belly button.

716
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:06,513
- So, I'm good.
- Yeah, I got to go.

717
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:09,549
Watching you beg
to give tattoos is too sad.

718
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,818
And that's freaking me out.

719
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:13,720
We're almost done.

720
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:14,888
Almost.

721
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:20,125
All right.

722
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,728
- You're all done.
- That looks really good.

723
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:23,329
Yeah, I mean, I wish

724
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:25,197
you'd let me do
something cooler, but yeah.

725
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,733
Oh, fuck no.
That hurts so bad.

726
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:29,335
- Another dumb tattoo.
- Yeah, but I-I like the pain.

727
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,538
The-the pain is the whole point
of getting tattoos.

728
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,238
Don't you just love
when you're getting tattooed,

729
00:27:33,272 --> 00:27:34,908
and it hits the bone
and pinches a nerve,

730
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:36,208
and you're like...

731
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:37,744
I'm not a fan of the pain.

732
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,613
You shouldn't let him
do it to you, all right?

733
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:40,447
He's inconsistent.

734
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,582
I think that tattoo's dumb.

735
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:44,684
Y'all should've told me
when you saw the design.

736
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:45,619
It says, "Unfollow me."

737
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:47,354
You don't even have
that many followers.

738
00:27:47,387 --> 00:27:49,489
Carla follows me.

739
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:51,223
- Bro, she's imaginary.
- Carla not real.

740
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:52,459
Carla's not real, dude.

741
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:54,494
How many times
do we have to say this?

742
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:56,529
She's not real.

743
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:57,831
I hate bugs, dawg.

744
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:58,932
I'm a gangster!

745
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:00,367
No, that's a bee, bro!

746
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,502
There's a kid down there.

747
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,236
- Yo, kid!
- Oh, yo.

748
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:06,205
- Yo, kid, what's up?
- Oh, shit, there is a kid.

749
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,641
What are you doing?

750
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:09,476
You hanging out on the beach?
Come here, come here.

751
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,778
Don't-don't be shy.
No stranger danger here.

752
00:28:11,811 --> 00:28:12,946
I'm not gonna touch you.

753
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:14,381
- What's up, pal?
- What are you doing?

754
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:15,548
I'm looking for my friend.

755
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:16,950
"Looking for my friend."

756
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:19,686
You want to be friends with us?

757
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,688
We're the good guys, right?

758
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,956
- You can hang out with us, pal.
- Come on.

759
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:25,190
Let me get some of that.
Put it right there.

760
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:28,795
- Ho!
- You gang.

761
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:30,229
Part of the gang.

762
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:31,665
Gang.

763
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:32,799
What's that?

764
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:33,933
Uh, it's a tattoo gun.

765
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,402
I was giving the homeys tattoos.

766
00:28:35,435 --> 00:28:37,537
I want a tattoo.

767
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,572
- You're a tough guy?
- Really?

768
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:41,775
- Sure, young guy. You want a tattoo?
- Yeah.

769
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:44,309
Dude, kid wants a tattoo.
That's my guy right there.

770
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,277
Bro, you-you can't
give him a tattoo.

771
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,479
- He's a little kid.
- Yeah, there we go.

772
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:48,815
- You want a tattoo?
- Bro, I got to practice on something.

773
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:50,282
- Yeah.
- He seems old enough.

774
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:51,918
- You a tough guy?
- Yeah.

775
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:53,252
You a badass.

776
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:54,487
Come on,
show those muscles, kid.

777
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:56,356
- Come on. Both arms, both arms.
- Yeah, there you go.

778
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:58,358
- Put 'em up.
- You got tickets to the gun show?

779
00:28:58,391 --> 00:28:59,993
- There it is. There it is.
- All right. - There we go.

780
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:01,695
- What's your name?
- Harold.

781
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:02,862
I'm-a call you Harry.

782
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:04,431
Don't. It's Harold.

783
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:06,298
- Oh.
- Okay.

784
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:08,233
- Hell yeah.
- I like this kid.

785
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,869
I need him in my life.

786
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:11,303
He has structure.

787
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:14,306
Guys, I don't think
that's a good idea.

788
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:16,843
I mean... we don't listen
to anything you say.

789
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:19,446
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean, why do you even try to give us advice?

790
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,715
So, what do you want
a tattoo of?

791
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:22,449
The Punisher.

792
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:24,349
- The Punisher?
- Okay.

793
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:25,752
- That's tough, man.
- All right.

794
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:28,455
He could've said anything.
He said The Punisher.

795
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:30,623
Oh, yeah, I could do that.
Is that it?

796
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:31,791
Yeah, that's him.

797
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

798
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:36,730
Do I have your legal permission
to do this?

799
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:38,565
- Yes.
- That's good enough for me.

800
00:29:38,598 --> 00:29:40,332
- How about you guys?
- Holds up in court.

801
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,434
You guys heard it. All right.

802
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:42,802
Yo, he can't get consent.
He's ten.

803
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:46,372
Now, hold still, okay?
'Cause it is permanent.

804
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:48,908
Yo, guys. Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

805
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:50,744
- Put your game face on.
- Don't worry, dude.

806
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:53,480
This will just be on you
for the rest of your life.

807
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:55,448
There you go.

808
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:57,016
- Look at you, tough guy.
- There you go.

809
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,352
- I don't want to do it!
- Uh...

810
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:00,420
- I don't wanna!
- Well, I got to finish it.

811
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:01,688
- Now there's just a line.
- Calm down, man.

812
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:04,023
- You're gonna look stupid. Sit back down. Relax.
- Calm down.

813
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,558
- Sit down. Do it.
- Relax.

814
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:07,026
- Whoa! Hey!
- Hey! - Hey!

815
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,895
- Hey, run! Run, kid!
- Hey!

816
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:10,930
Run, little man! Run!

817
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:12,832
Run!

818
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,434
Goddamn it.

819
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:15,902
I fucking believed
in that kid, man.

820
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:19,639
He seemed so tough at first,
uh, but then immediately wasn't.

821
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,541
That's why I don't fuck
with millennials, dude.

822
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:24,744
Again, we are the millennials.

823
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:26,746
He keeps saying that, but
I don't know what that means.

824
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,916
I regret my friendship
with you guys.

825
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,396
Yeah, hello.
My name's Raymond Bishop.

826
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:45,698
This is my son, Harold.
Say hello, Harold.

827
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:46,933
I'm sorry.

828
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,868
What's going on?

829
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:50,670
Well, it seems your son
was down in the woods

830
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:52,839
giving out free tattoos, and
my son was one of his victims.

831
00:30:52,872 --> 00:30:54,841
What?
Well, I-I don't understand.

832
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:57,610
How do you know it was my son?
How'd you get this address?

833
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,979
I have my ways.
Believe me, I have my ways.

834
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:00,947
Are you a cop?

835
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,749
No, I'm a fireman, okay?
I work for a living.

836
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,083
Look at this.
Do you believe this?

837
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:05,819
You see that there?
See that line?

838
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:07,887
I don't know if you
burn these off or what,

839
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:08,888
but we're taking care of this

840
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:10,490
and you're paying for it,
you understand me?

841
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,859
- I don't know what this is.
- Scott! Oh.

842
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:14,661
I am... I'm so sorry.

843
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:15,862
I-I-I...

844
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:18,097
There's an aesthetic laser
at the hospital where I work,

845
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:20,066
and it can completely remove it.

846
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,501
Uh, I get a discount.

847
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:22,635
I'm-I'm gonna pay
for the whole thing.

848
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,838
I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm... I feel terrible.

849
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:25,839
You should feel terrible!

850
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:26,773
Look at that!

851
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:28,908
- What's up? Oh, fuck.
- Ah, there he is.

852
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:31,511
- You get your ass out here!
- Hey, he said he was 18.

853
00:31:31,544 --> 00:31:34,047
He looks like he's four,
you fucking moron! Sorry.

854
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,882
- He consented!
- He's lying.

855
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,750
- Harold, come on!
- Course he's lying!

856
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:40,119
You can't have consent!
He's nine years old!

857
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:41,721
Dad, let's go.
You're embarrassing me.

858
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:42,922
We're not going anywhere, okay?

859
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:43,756
He's just a little kid!

860
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,691
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

861
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,693
Uh, he was roaming around
in the woods.

862
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:48,428
He wanted a tattoo.
W-Where were you?

863
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:50,063
I was at fucking work!

864
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:51,030
- Fuck you! - Hey!
- Come out here!

865
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:52,632
If I was you,
I'd shut your fucking mouth,

866
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:53,766
because I can
call the cops right now

867
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,767
and have your ass
thrown in jail.

868
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:56,936
- For what?
- For sticking needles in a kid's arm,

869
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,937
you fucking dope!

870
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:59,906
Did you even raise him?
Did you even raise him?

871
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:01,975
You know, there's no reason
to call the cops.

872
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:05,011
I can handle this and I can
also handle disciplining him.

873
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:07,080
Well, clearly you can't or you
wouldn't have a middle-aged son

874
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:10,583
still living at home, tattooing
minors against their will!

875
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:12,051
I asked him to do it.

876
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:13,920
- It's not his fault.
- That's right. That's my man.

877
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:16,122
Go wait in the car.
Harold, go on.

878
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:17,757
And don't raise your voice at me, either.

879
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,725
Later, Harold.

880
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:20,827
Don't say goodbye to my kid.
Look both ways.

881
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,695
- Look both ways!
- Go to your room.

882
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:23,796
- I am!
- Watch your mouth.

883
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,599
For your information,
I am not a middle-aged man.

884
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:29,168
I'm a 24-year-old man,
and I'm going to my room

885
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:30,870
'cause I fucking want to.

886
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:34,474
What kind of fucking animal are
you raising in this house, huh?

887
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:35,708
I'm bringing you the bill.

888
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:36,943
I don't care what it costs,
all right?

889
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:39,579
- I mean, what the fuck is going on around here?
- All right.

890
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:40,980
Just give me a day
to arrange the laser.

891
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:42,749
All right.
You know, you know something?

892
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:43,983
I-Is his father home?
Where's his dad?

893
00:32:44,017 --> 00:32:45,919
I-I don't, I don't want
to fucking yell at you.

894
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:47,921
He's deceased.

895
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:50,757
Oh.

896
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,458
Well, uh...

897
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,060
I'm, uh, sorry for your loss.

898
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,528
I'm sure if he was still around,

899
00:32:55,561 --> 00:32:56,763
he would agree with
the fact that,

900
00:32:56,796 --> 00:32:59,565
you know, you should
still pay for it.

901
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,141
Comically huge mustache.

902
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:09,976
Is this what he looked like?

903
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:11,477
That's exactly
what he looked like.

904
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,546
- You're scared of me.
- Yeah.

905
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:14,781
Yo, he-he...
And that's not funny.

906
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,616
He burst into the door,
started screaming,

907
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:18,618
and his mustache was
flapping all over the place.

908
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:20,620
- Flapping.
- He looked the Monopoly Man.

909
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,722
It was terrifying.

910
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:24,824
"Look both ways!

911
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:26,626
Look both ways!"

912
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,127
- Fucking maniac.
- But I will say,

913
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:31,764
probably not a good idea to
tattoo children in the woods.

914
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,666
- Yeah, probably.
- You know, you could get in trouble.

915
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,234
- Yeah, you could.
- Why did you do that?

916
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:36,102
I don't know.

917
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:37,236
I thought I would
get away with it.

918
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,372
Plus, I thought he was, like,
at least 15, you know?

919
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:40,974
- Oh, really?
- I got... Yeah, I got my first tattoo...

920
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:43,276
- How old was he?
- Nine.

921
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:44,510
You thought he was 15?

922
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:46,713
- Yeah, I'm fucking...
- Maybe you've been smoking too much.

923
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:48,114
I think I'm just stupid.

924
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:50,550
Uh...

925
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,751
No, you should see
my mom, though.

926
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,753
- It's so weird since my sister left.
- Yeah.

927
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:55,221
She's just crying
all the time and, like,

928
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:57,190
- she's trying to talk to me and hang out with me.
- Mm.

929
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:59,025
The other day, she asked me
to go to Nordstrom Rack.

930
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:01,127
I almost slit my throat.

931
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,128
Did you go?

932
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,796
No. I pretended to be asleep.

933
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,631
Oh, come on, she...
Maybe she needs company.

934
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:07,567
She's lonely
without your sister.

935
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,036
Yeah, she's-she's,
she's gonna be lonely.

936
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:12,605
I mean, you should've seen her
at my sister's send-off party.

937
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:14,774
It was, it was really weird.

938
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:18,244
There was a party?

939
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:19,278
Yeah.

940
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:20,847
Why wasn't I invited?

941
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,149
To a high school
graduation party?

942
00:34:23,182 --> 00:34:25,018
Well, who was there?

943
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:27,186
It was, you know, it was just

944
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,956
family and... shit.

945
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,091
What, you don't want me
to be around your family?

946
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,659
I've known them since I was ten.

947
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:34,794
Well, yeah, I just...

948
00:34:34,827 --> 00:34:36,963
I didn't think it was something
you would want to go to.

949
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:38,064
I'm-I'm sorry.

950
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,066
Come on, that's fucked up.

951
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:41,868
Why? Why is that fucked up?

952
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:45,838
Because we're, you know,
doing something here.

953
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:47,273
We're... Are-are we
doing something here?

954
00:34:47,306 --> 00:34:48,375
I don't know,
we're starting a thing.

955
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,176
I mean, we're having sex
and we're hanging out a lot.

956
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:52,311
- I mean, it's...
- I thought it was just, like,

957
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:55,348
more, you know,
casual than that.

958
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:56,883
You know?

959
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:03,656
Well, you don't want me to go
to any, like, life events?

960
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:06,325
Life... What's a life event?

961
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,728
What does that,
what does that even mean?

962
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:11,798
You know what? It's fine.

963
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:13,066
- What?
- No, it's fine.

964
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:14,167
Come back.

965
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,835
I'm sor... Wait.

966
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,837
Wai...

967
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,373
- You know what? You're right.
- What?

968
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:21,040
What are you talking about?
I'm never right.

969
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,942
No, you're right.
We shouldn't do this anymore.

970
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:24,877
I don't want
to fucking do this anymore.

971
00:35:24,911 --> 00:35:26,612
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

972
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,314
It was all a mistake.
It was a mistake.

973
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:29,816
But it's fine.
We're on the same page.

974
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:31,184
We'll go back
to what it was before.

975
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:33,353
I'll treat you like I do
Oscar and Richie.

976
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:34,354
I-It's not even that.

977
00:35:34,388 --> 00:35:36,022
It's just, like,
I-I don't know what I want yet.

978
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,090
Like, I'm trying
to figure my shit out.

979
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:39,192
And you should. Please do.
Figure your shit out.

980
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:41,227
But we're not gonna
have sex anymore, okay?

981
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,895
I got to go.

982
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:46,866
I should've invited you
to the party!

983
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:48,935
I didn't know
it was a life event!

984
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:51,137
Oh. Oh.

985
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,739
I-I already arranged to, uh,
pay directly at the hospital.

986
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:55,842
But if you want a check,
just give me two minutes, okay?

987
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,844
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm-I'm... I-I want to pay.

988
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:59,846
I'm gonna pay for it.
I'm gonna pay for it.

989
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:00,813
No, no, no.
I'm gonna pay for it.

990
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:02,715
And I'm, and I'm also
gonna talk to Scott

991
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:04,951
because that was totally
out of line, totally nuts.

992
00:36:04,984 --> 00:36:06,752
Yeah, I-I understand that.

993
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:09,922
But, uh, look, I just wanted
to apologize, okay?

994
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:12,325
I-I got a little
out of control before, uh...

995
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,862
You know, I just, I let
my anger get the best of me.

996
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:18,097
Broke my stupid resolution.

997
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:19,999
God knows it's what
messed up my marriage,

998
00:36:20,032 --> 00:36:22,168
and I-I just really wanted
to apologize, okay?

999
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,703
I mean, I was upset,

1000
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,872
but I-I shouldn't have
conveyed it that way.

1001
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:26,873
There's no need to apologize.

1002
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:28,841
My kid's being a fucking
lunatic. It's not cool.

1003
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,411
Oh, I... I overreacted.
He's fine.

1004
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:33,246
No, it's the tip of the iceberg.

1005
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:36,416
Ah, you know, lot of kids
do stuff like this.

1006
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,017
Mm, kids don't do
stuff like this.

1007
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,185
He did the second-worst thing

1008
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:41,154
you could do
to a kid in the woods.

1009
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:47,126
Well, either way, I shouldn't
have behaved the way I behaved.

1010
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,928
So, I'm truly sorry.

1011
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,398
Apology accepted.
It's nice.

1012
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:53,166
Don't get many of those
around here.

1013
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,201
- Thanks.
- Oh, hey, this might seem

1014
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:57,036
a little crazy, but, uh...

1015
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:59,772
can I take you out
for a cup of coffee?

1016
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:03,075
So, Scott did this.

1017
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:05,379
Oh. Is that a cocker spaniel?

1018
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:08,181
No. No, that's my daughter.

1019
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:09,248
- That's Claire.
- Oh.

1020
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:10,417
Oh, yeah, yeah. I can...

1021
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,385
- Yeah, I just thought...
- No, it's okay.

1022
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:12,486
- I thought those were ears.
- Um, it's okay.

1023
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,420
- That's her hair. Okay, yep.
- I know. I hear that.

1024
00:37:13,453 --> 00:37:17,757
Scott got his first tattoo
when he was 16.

1025
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,459
- Oh, okay.
- It was of Kermit the Frog.

1026
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:21,428
Oh.

1027
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:23,963
- That's kind of cute.
- Yeah, yeah.

1028
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:26,500
Kermit smoking a joint, so...

1029
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,234
Kermit smoking a joint?

1030
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,802
Geez, I don't remember
that episode

1031
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,070
on <i>Sesame Street,</i> huh?

1032
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:33,973
That's kind of funny.
He's a funny kid, then, huh?

1033
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,341
- Oh, he's so funny.
- Yeah?

1034
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,343
- He's so funny.
- You think he's gonna stick it out?

1035
00:37:37,377 --> 00:37:39,178
Uh, well, that I don't know.

1036
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:41,080
I mean, I sent him
to art school, but he quit.

1037
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:44,317
- He-he couldn't really focus 'cause...
- Oh.

1038
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:47,920
He also has ADD, so he...

1039
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:50,823
Anyway, he's a tattoo artist
with ADD.

1040
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:52,024
Well, you know what?

1041
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:53,326
All the guys
down at the firehouse,

1042
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,127
they all have tattoos
and stuff, you know.

1043
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:57,196
Personally, I never got one,
though, you know.

1044
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,031
You know, not that I have
anything against them.

1045
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,734
I just, I just always felt
I was too pasty.

1046
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:05,439
- So, the firehouse, huh?
- Yeah.

1047
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:06,906
The old firehouse.

1048
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:09,409
- Mm-hmm, the old firehouse.
- Yeah.

1049
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:11,244
So, you're a ladder or engine?

1050
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:13,279
Ladder.

1051
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:14,981
Knew it.

1052
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:17,283
You got firefighters
in your family?

1053
00:38:17,316 --> 00:38:19,018
Yeah, my husband.

1054
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:20,554
- Oh, geez. Sorry.
- Yeah.

1055
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:22,088
Forgot.

1056
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:26,959
Hey, uh, I hope this isn't
too forward, but do you mind

1057
00:38:26,993 --> 00:38:30,397
if-if I ask what happened
to your husband?

1058
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,331
Oh, it was a hotel fire.

1059
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:33,966
The roof collapsed.

1060
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,469
He went in to save somebody.

1061
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:40,006
They told him it wasn't safe,
but, you know, he was like that.

1062
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,276
- Wait, Stan Carlin was your husband?
- Mm-hmm.

1063
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:44,810
- Paramount Hotel fire?
- Yeah, yeah.

1064
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:45,845
Did you know him?

1065
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:47,547
- You, you... Or you heard...
- No, no, no, I...

1066
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:49,015
Hung out with him or...?

1067
00:38:49,048 --> 00:38:50,484
No, I j...
I just heard about him.

1068
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:51,884
- Oh.
- He was a real brave guy.

1069
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:53,152
- Yeah.
- He was kind of a,

1070
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:55,021
kind of a legend,
to be honest with you.

1071
00:38:55,054 --> 00:38:57,890
Yeah. Yeah.

1072
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:00,326
And Scott was only seven
when it happened, so...

1073
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,895
- Oh, that's tough.
- A lot of consequences.

1074
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:05,131
- Yeah, that's a tough situation, but...
- Yeah.

1075
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:08,100
But I-I got to tell you,
you did a great job, you know?

1076
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:09,168
See, I mean, I...

1077
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:11,170
I know we had a little bit
of a difference there,

1078
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:12,372
- but, I mean, he's a good kid.
- Uh-huh.

1079
00:39:12,406 --> 00:39:14,907
And I got to tell you, if-if
the worst he's doing is-is,

1080
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,443
you know, a couple
unlawful tattoos,

1081
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:18,445
- you-you did a hell of a job.
- Yeah.

1082
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:21,381
Yeah, I don't think that's
the worst he's doing, though.

1083
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:23,049
Oh.

1084
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:24,384
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't know.

1085
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:26,986
You know, uh, that's
how kids are, you know?

1086
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:30,390
Everybody gets it
at a different time.

1087
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:31,991
Anyways, what are you, uh...

1088
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:33,560
I-I'm just sitting here,
doing all the talking here.

1089
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:35,562
What do you, what do you do?

1090
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:37,063
I'm a nurse.

1091
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:38,532
I'm a school nurse.

1092
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:40,933
I'm also an ER nurse.

1093
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:43,069
- You work in the ER?
- Mm-hmm.

1094
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:46,339
Jesus Christ, Margie,
we probably met each other.

1095
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:47,340
Could be.

1096
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:48,608
So, how you doing?

1097
00:39:48,642 --> 00:39:50,444
I'm...

1098
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:52,311
very tired.

1099
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:53,979
Really?
Well, you don't look tired.

1100
00:39:55,147 --> 00:39:56,550
No, seriously, you look great.

1101
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,552
- Really?
- Yeah.

1102
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:02,088
I just don't, like... I mean,
are you flirting with me or...?

1103
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:04,358
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1104
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:05,991
Yeah, a lot. This is,
this is what it looks like.

1105
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,993
It is really subtle.
I couldn't...

1106
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:09,228
I can't tell what's going on.

1107
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:10,630
This is how it looks.
I'm very subtle.

1108
00:40:10,664 --> 00:40:11,431
All right.

1109
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:13,232
- I'm rusty. You're subtle.
- Okay.

1110
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:14,468
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

1111
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:18,672
I see you out there, man.
You're doing great.

1112
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:20,206
Keep... Just keep doing
what you're doing.

1113
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,340
Have a good time, you know?

1114
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,310
The more fun you have,
the more fun the customers have.

1115
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:25,344
All right, thanks.

1116
00:40:28,013 --> 00:40:30,116
Hey, busboy,
why is table 12 still dirty?

1117
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:31,451
Oh, 'cause they were talking.

1118
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:33,653
I didn't think I should
interrupt them, but...

1119
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:35,254
Interrupt them.
Get them out of here.

1120
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:36,255
- All right.
- Do your job.

1121
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:38,991
- Sorry. Whoa.
- Take it easy there, brother.

1122
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:41,193
- My bad. - Jesus.
- Thank you.

1123
00:40:41,227 --> 00:40:44,263
Uh, hi. Uh, are you done
enjoying your meal?

1124
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:46,433
There is food in my mouth,
and I am chewing.

1125
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:48,067
Do you think that I'm finished?

1126
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,636
I'm just holding this
for my health?

1127
00:40:49,669 --> 00:40:50,737
- Get me some water.
- Sorry.

1128
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:53,172
- Hey, come here. Come here. Can we order?
- Uh, yeah.

1129
00:40:53,205 --> 00:40:54,541
- I'll go get your waiter.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

1130
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:56,142
We don't have time for that.
We're in a hurry.

1131
00:40:56,175 --> 00:40:57,143
I'm starving.

1132
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:58,277
Okay. Can I go?

1133
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,045
Usually, the woman
goes first, but go ahead.

1134
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,881
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, yeah?

1135
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:01,848
- How about I'm paying?
- All right.

1136
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:05,419
Can I have a chicken parm
with meat sauce?

1137
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:06,952
No marinara.

1138
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,489
Thin. Thin chicken parm.

1139
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:10,624
Why aren't you writing it down?

1140
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:13,560
Yeah, I-I can't actually
because, uh, I'm not a waiter.

1141
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:16,430
I'm just a busboy, so
they don't even give me a pen.

1142
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:18,264
Memorize it. Yeah.

1143
00:41:18,297 --> 00:41:20,032
Seafood pasta.
That's what I want.

1144
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:21,668
No clams, okay?
Double up on the shrimp.

1145
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:24,303
That's how I always get it.
We come here all the time.

1146
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:26,673
I'm not gonna remember
a word you guys just said.

1147
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:28,174
It's not rocket science.
Just go.

1148
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:29,609
- Get our shit.
- Oh, I'm... All right.

1149
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:30,610

Fighting for tips.

Who's going?
Who's going first?

1158

- I, Zoots.
- Zoots.

1159
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:48,260
- Everyone fights for their tips.
- The tips that we earn?

1160
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:51,731
Y-Yeah, but you have
to fight for them now.

1161
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:53,467
Who wants some?! Huh?!

1162
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,334
- Huh? - Who got it?!
- It's you, bro.

1163
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:57,203
- No way. No, no way.
- Put the gloves on.

1164
00:41:57,236 --> 00:41:59,071
Get in there. Get in there.
Hit him.

1165
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:00,607
- Hey, yo.
- Hey.

1166
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,609
I don't want... Please, I don...
I-I don't want to do this.

1167
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:04,478
- Let's just not do this.
- You don't want to do this?

1168
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:06,111
- What do you mean?
- No, well, 'cause we're friends, right?

1169
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:07,781
Yeah, no, for the next
15 seconds,

1170
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:09,281
this friendship is over, son.

1171
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:10,584
- Understand that?
- What?

1172
00:42:10,617 --> 00:42:11,485
- Hmm?
- What?

1173
00:42:11,518 --> 00:42:13,219
Got to understand,
fighting is serious.

1174
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:14,488
- I don't like it.
- It's sacred.

1175
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:16,288
It's how I tribute
my Lord and Savior.

1176
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:17,724
- What?
- It's the way I tribute

1177
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:18,558
my Lord and Savior, Jesus.

1178
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:20,092
I don't think
Jesus would want you

1179
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:20,927
to kick my ass right now.

1180
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:21,928
He would want me
to have these tips.

1181
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:23,530
- That's what he means.
- You can have the tips.

1182
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:24,263
I don't even want 'em.

1183
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:25,632
- What is this?
- I don't know.

1184
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:26,666
What's this shit?

1185

a couple times.

1186

- I seen <i>Creed</i> a couple times.

1187
00:42:29,836 --> 00:42:31,705
- Oh.

1237
00:44:20,747 --> 00:44:22,682
- Scott?
- Yo.

1238
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:23,550
Come sit down.

1239
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,486
I need to talk to you
about something.

1240
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:27,787
What's up?

1241
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:29,221
Someone die?

1242
00:44:29,254 --> 00:44:31,223
No, no, nobody's dead.

1243
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:33,360
Thank God.

1244
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:36,696
I'm seeing somebody.

1245
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,197
What does that mean?

1246
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,433
Uh, uh, I'm seeing a man.

1247
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:43,737
Well, I-I've been dating
someone for a little while now.

1248
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,304
You're dating someone?

1249
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:46,773
That-That's awesome.

1250
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:49,909
Like, w-why are you dating him
secretly, you little slut?

1251
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:51,378
W-Why didn't you tell me?

1252
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:53,780
Is he, like,
really, really old or...

1253
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:55,247
or is he really, really young?

1254
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,516
Is it one of my friends?
Is it Igor?

1255
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:59,218
No, no, no. I just, I...

1256
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:03,188
I just didn't want to bother you
unless it was really serious.

1257
00:45:03,222 --> 00:45:04,591
Bother? You're my mom.

1258
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:05,925
I hope you're getting
banged out real good.

1259
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:06,926
Who's the lucky guy?

1260
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,429
Uh, it's, um...

1261
00:45:10,597 --> 00:45:12,264
It's Ray.

1262
00:45:12,297 --> 00:45:14,266
Who's Ray?

1263
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:16,268
Remember the kid you tattooed?

1264
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:17,671
His father.

1265
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:20,305
- That fucking prick?
- Yeah, I know.

1266
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,275
He's a really nice man,
and he's really good to me.

1267
00:45:23,308 --> 00:45:26,211
- And he's a fireman.
- He's a fireman?!

1268
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:27,279
That's fucked up.

1269
00:45:27,312 --> 00:45:28,548
- Why?
- W-What do you mean, why?

1270
00:45:28,581 --> 00:45:31,751
I mean, uh, you haven't dated
anyone in 17 years since Dad,

1271
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:33,486
and the first guy you date
is a fireman?

1272
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,921
You don't think
that's a little fucking weird?

1273
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:36,890
I got nothing against firemen.

1274
00:45:36,923 --> 00:45:38,725
Neither do I, but
the-the guy doesn't like me,

1275
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:41,561
and he has the same job as Dad,
like...

1276
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:44,431
I'm fucked up as it is, Mom.
Like, I have Crohn's, okay?

1277
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:46,298
There's something wrong
up here. Huh.

1278
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:47,767
I can't find my watch!

1279
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:49,402
What are you trying
to do to me here?!

1280
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:50,302
Haven't I been through enough?!

1281
00:45:50,335 --> 00:45:51,705
Wait, what did I,
what did I do wrong?

1282
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:53,305
W-What did I do wrong?
What did I do?

1283
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:55,307
What... I'm sorry.
Like, what did I do?

1284
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,810
I'm not,
I'm not doing it to you.

1285
00:45:56,843 --> 00:45:59,244
I just... I-I don't want to be
alone the rest of my life.

1286
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:00,613
I don't want you
to be alone, either.

1287
00:46:00,647 --> 00:46:02,582
That would suck, but, like,
come on. This is, like...

1288
00:46:02,615 --> 00:46:04,951
This is pretty obvious this is
not a good choice, right?

1289
00:46:06,886 --> 00:46:09,254
I would like us to have dinner.

1290
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:11,357
I... This is
very, very important to me.

1291
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:12,525
I am in a serious
relationship...

1292
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,861
- You're in a serious rela...
- ...with a very nice man.

1293
00:46:14,894 --> 00:46:16,563
With that guy?! Come on!

1294
00:46:16,596 --> 00:46:17,964
Y-You don't love him, do you?

1295
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:19,966
You're not say... You're not,
like, saying that, right?

1296
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,835
I-I... Well, we don't use
that word yet.

1297
00:46:21,868 --> 00:46:24,738
But if he said it to me,
I-I would say it back.

1298
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:27,407
Oh, my God! Jesus!

1299
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,341
Do you not learn?!

1300
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,578
Look what happened last time!

1301
00:46:31,611 --> 00:46:33,012
- You want to do that again?
- Okay. All right?

1302
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:33,847
How about this?

1303
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,815
How about we come by
the restaurant

1304
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:37,550
and we have dinner
when you're working

1305
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:39,352
and you just come by
and you just say hi?

1306
00:46:39,385 --> 00:46:41,621
Just say hi a couple times.
How about that?

1307
00:46:41,654 --> 00:46:42,455
How about that?

1308
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:45,492
How about...
Why don't you ask him?

1309
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:46,359
Huh?

1310
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:47,727
Why don't you just build

1311
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,529
another shrine to Ray
while you're at it?

1312
00:46:49,562 --> 00:46:52,866
Right across from Dad's
so they can be fucking pals!

1313
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:55,635
Yeah, I like that better.

1314
00:46:55,668 --> 00:46:56,970
But I'm actually
finding you funny

1315
00:46:57,003 --> 00:46:58,371
'cause you're really funny.

1316
00:46:59,472 --> 00:47:00,740
Look at this guy.

1317
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:03,510
- Having the time of his life.
- Mm-hmm.

1318
00:47:03,543 --> 00:47:05,011
Acting like he owns the place.

1319
00:47:05,044 --> 00:47:08,047
I know that guy.
Eggplant parmesan.

1320
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:09,916
Oh. I'll be.

1321
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:12,085
Your moms is a bit of a baddie.

1322
00:47:12,118 --> 00:47:13,620
She look postcoital.

1323
00:47:13,653 --> 00:47:15,555
- What's "postcoital"?
- It's like post-fucking,

1324
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:17,457
but it's your mom,
so I want to be nice.

1325
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:19,859
But, uh,
oh, it's definitely happening.

1326
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:26,533
Postcoital.

1327
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:27,967
If you ever come to see me,

1328
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:29,169
if you ever come
see me, that's...

1329
00:47:29,202 --> 00:47:30,904
- It'll happen that night, I guarantee it.
- Yeah, I know.

1330
00:47:30,937 --> 00:47:32,405
Oh, here he is.

1331
00:47:32,438 --> 00:47:33,540
- Hey.
- Hey.

1332
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:34,674
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

1333
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:35,942
Good to see you again. Yeah.

1334
00:47:35,975 --> 00:47:38,444
Uh, I'm-I'm really sorry
for branding your kid.

1335
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,713
Oh, no, no, no.
It's-it's fine. It's fine.

1336
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:42,949
Cost 350, but I didn't make
your mom pay for it.

1337
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:46,553
But, uh, hey, no harm, no foul.

1338
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:49,789
You know? 'Cause, uh,
if that didn't happen, I, uh...

1339
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:51,558
wouldn't have met
this lovely lady.

1340
00:47:51,591 --> 00:47:53,459
Oh, well, happy to help.

1341
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:54,894
Things work out.

1342
00:47:54,928 --> 00:47:56,029
Yeah.

1343
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:58,498
Thank God I did
what I did, then.

1344
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:00,900
Uh, would you guys like
to start with still

1345
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:01,835
or, uh, sparkling water?

1346
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:03,603
- Oh, let's go sparkling.
- Uh, spar... Yeah.

1347
00:48:03,636 --> 00:48:04,938
Yeah? You like sparkling?

1348
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:05,905
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1349
00:48:05,939 --> 00:48:07,440
Yeah. Oh, can we get
some more bread, too?

1350
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:08,308
- Usually go still.
- You know?

1351
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,776
Last time I came here,
it came out hot.

1352
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:11,644
- Yeah.
- It was... oh, it was perfect.

1353
00:48:11,678 --> 00:48:13,012
It's like my mom made it.

1354
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:14,013
Sure.

1355
00:48:14,047 --> 00:48:15,481
Sparkling and hot bread.

1356
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:17,417
All right. Thanks, buddy.

1357
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,922
Oh, you just can't spit
on that like that, man.

1358
00:48:22,956 --> 00:48:25,592
You got to be crafty.
You can't just go out at, like...

1359
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:26,860
You got to,
you got to maneuver.

1360
00:48:26,893 --> 00:48:29,028
Lick on it or put a boogie
in it or something.

1361
00:48:29,062 --> 00:48:31,497
You think I can fit
this whole thing in my ass?

1362
00:48:31,531 --> 00:48:33,633
If, uh, you really
put your mind to it, bro.

1363
00:48:37,503 --> 00:48:39,739
Hey, I saw him spit
in the bread.

1364
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:44,510
All right, scorching hot bread.

1365
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:46,079
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

1366
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:47,814
Your mom's in the john.
Have a seat.

1367
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:50,516
Oh, don't worry, you're not
gonna get in trouble.

1368
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,018
Just for a minute.

1369
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:53,686
All right.

1370
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:59,492
So... how, uh, how you liking
the job here?

1371
00:48:59,525 --> 00:49:01,995
Uh, it eats ass.

1372
00:49:03,863 --> 00:49:04,998
You know, I remember I...
Back in the day,

1373
00:49:05,031 --> 00:49:07,200
I used to work at that, uh,
you know that pizza parlor

1374
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,401
- down there on Main Street?
- Mm.

1375
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:10,637
You remember the one? Yeah.
I-I used to work down there.

1376
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,473
I loved it.
You know, making the pizzas.

1377
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:14,908
Girls would come in, you know.

1378
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:17,477
It's like they just
had to talk to me.

1379
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,478
Yeah.

1380
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:19,812
Well, that's awesome.

1381
00:49:19,846 --> 00:49:23,416
I'm glad you got laid a lot
at your pizza place.

1382
00:49:25,218 --> 00:49:27,520
All right.
Listen, Scott.

1383
00:49:27,553 --> 00:49:30,023
I-I know this is weird, okay?

1384
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:32,792
You and your mom were alone
together for a long time.

1385
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:35,228
You got set in your ways,
you know?

1386
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:37,463
You got used to things.

1387
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:38,765
But I don't know,
I just feel like

1388
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:40,667
your mother deserves
more right now.

1389
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,670
And I'm serious, I really think
that I can make her happy,

1390
00:49:43,703 --> 00:49:45,805
and she makes me happy.

1391
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,541
So, I mean, that-that's
a good thing, right?

1392
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:50,777
Yeah. Yeah, I think
it's a great thing.

1393
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:53,913
I... I want my mom to be happy
more than anything, so...

1394
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:55,248
Good. I do, too.

1395
00:49:55,281 --> 00:49:57,650
So, uh, what's your sport?

1396
00:49:57,684 --> 00:49:59,686
- Uh, I like basketball.
- Oh, yeah?

1397
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:00,687
- Mm-hmm.
- What position?

1398
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,021
Uh, I played small forward.

1399
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:03,022
- Small forward.
- Yeah.

1400
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:04,791
All right. I'm kind of
a baseball guy myself.

1401
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:06,159
- Oh, yeah?
- You like, uh...

1402
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:07,560
I'm an old man.
I like that stuff.

1403
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:08,795
I got season tickets
to the Yankees.

1404
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,596
- No way. Really? That's cool.
- Yeah.

1405
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,764
I think it's
Staten Island's year.

1406
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:13,700
Oh, Staten Island Yankees.

1407
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:15,969
- Minor League.
- Oh, absolutely.

1408
00:50:16,002 --> 00:50:18,638
I'm not gonna go pay to see
those overpaid crybabies.

1409
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:20,707
They try harder
at the Minor League level.

1410
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,542
Plus, I'm a Red Sox fan.
I'm never setting foot

1411
00:50:22,575 --> 00:50:23,910
- in that stadium.
- Well, I-I should get back

1412
00:50:23,943 --> 00:50:25,812
to work, uh,
before I get yelled at.

1413
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:26,980
- Okay. Go ahead.
- So, yeah.

1414
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:28,614
- Absolutely. All right.
- All right, man.

1415
00:50:28,648 --> 00:50:30,616
Uh, enjoy the hot bread.

1416
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,784
- Hey.
- Okay, cool.

1417
00:50:31,818 --> 00:50:32,618
Hey.

1418
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:34,020
What are you fellas
talking about?

1419
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:35,922
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, I was just asking Scott

1420
00:50:35,955 --> 00:50:38,224
if he wanted to go
to a Yankee game sometime.

1421
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:40,526
Oh, what did Scott say?

1422
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:44,897
S-Scott... Scott said yeah.

1423
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:46,766
All right,
who's fighting tonight?!

1424
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:48,601
I want to fight somebody!

1425
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:50,069
Oh, I'm sorry, Pepe.

1426
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:52,038
Don't take this personally.

1427
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:55,008
Oh!

1428
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,943
What happened?

1429
00:50:56,976 --> 00:50:58,978
That was just a jab.

1430
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:00,279
Oh, it's okay, Pepe.

1431
00:51:00,313 --> 00:51:01,948
- It's all right.
- You s... You sure?

1432
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:02,915
Yeah.

1433
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:05,284
I-I mean, I never done that
before, so...

1434
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:07,186

that there is
no flash photography.

1446
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:46,692
How are you? How are you?
You guys still sober?

1447
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,269
- Shitty throw. Shitty throw, though.
- That's how you do it!

1448
00:51:56,302 --> 00:51:58,337
All right, there we go.
There we go.

1449
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:00,239
Let's go, baby, let's go.

1450
00:52:00,273 --> 00:52:01,375
Look alive!

1451
00:52:03,377 --> 00:52:05,678
Think we're gonna take
these pansy Spinners tonight?

1452
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:06,979
Oh, man, we can't
take the Spinners,

1453
00:52:07,013 --> 00:52:09,215
- you might as well just shut it down.
- Mm.

1454
00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:10,283
We should just pack it in,

1455
00:52:10,316 --> 00:52:11,385
send these guys
back to Single-A.

1456
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:13,686
My kid's Little League team
could give these guys

1457
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:14,488
a run for their money.

1458
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:17,824
These guys are all
on the job, too.

1459
00:52:17,857 --> 00:52:19,692
The old ballbuster here...

1460
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,227
he's the senior man
of the house.

1461
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,229
Did you call me a senior?

1462
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:24,831
You're the one who's bald.

1463
00:52:24,864 --> 00:52:26,699
Come on, Papa.
I'm just fucking around.

1464
00:52:26,732 --> 00:52:27,934
Hey, you want a hot dog?

1465
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:30,636
Oh, no, I can't.
I, uh, I have Crohn's.

1466
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:31,904
What's that?

1467
00:52:31,938 --> 00:52:34,707
It's, like, when the lining of
your stomach is all messed up,

1468
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,176
so it makes you shit
all the time.

1469
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,112
Oh, thanks for sharing.

1470
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,248
Next time, just say,
"I don't want a hot dog."

1471
00:52:42,281 --> 00:52:44,150
All right, I'm just trying
to spread awareness.

1472
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:47,787
There we go. There we go.

1473
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,424
- Nice hit. Nice hit.
- Looking good, guys.

1474
00:52:50,457 --> 00:52:51,991
Way to hustle.

1475
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:53,292
Number 26...

1476
00:52:53,326 --> 00:52:55,761
Hey, uh...

1477
00:52:55,795 --> 00:52:58,064
you ever think about
putting on the jacket?

1478
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:00,967
- No.
- What are you laughing about?

1479
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,203
'Cause it's
a stupid question, Ray.

1480
00:53:04,237 --> 00:53:07,407
- What do you mean, stupid?
- It's fucking stupid.

1481
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:09,909
Would you ask the kids of that
teacher who blew up in space

1482
00:53:09,942 --> 00:53:11,043
if they want to be an astronaut?

1483
00:53:11,077 --> 00:53:13,846
Whoa, I don't think that lady
had any kids, though.

1484
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,082
Yeah, I'm sure she didn't
'cause she died in space.

1485
00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:19,285
It's hard to have kids
when you're dead in space.

1486
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:22,855
Look, I-I could tell you
how I feel about firemen,

1487
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:24,391
but I-I don't think you guys
want to hear my opinion.

1488
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:26,325
- No, no, no, please tell us.
- No, no. No, no, no.

1489
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,694
- No. I want to hear it.
- You don't got to do this, man.

1490
00:53:28,728 --> 00:53:29,795
- Come on.
- All right, no.

1491
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:31,264
- Yeah. Okay, how about this?
- Come on, you don't...

1492
00:53:31,297 --> 00:53:33,299
Uh, if you're a fireman,
just don't have kids

1493
00:53:33,332 --> 00:53:34,767
or a family at all, okay?

1494
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,470
So that way, you don't
fucking crush them

1495
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:39,305
when you don't come home
that one time, you know?

1496
00:53:39,338 --> 00:53:40,806
And-and you're just so selfish.

1497
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,376
You just hang out
with your boys all day

1498
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:43,876
like it's a fucking frat house.

1499
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:46,045
Half the time, you're not even
putting out fires.

1500
00:53:46,078 --> 00:53:49,115
You're just jerking off,
watching <i>Scarface,</i> okay?

1501
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:51,117
- All right, take it easy, man.
- No, I'm just saying.

1502
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,052
And it's wrong to tell a kid
that you're gonna be there

1503
00:53:53,085 --> 00:53:54,187
for him for his whole
entire life.

1504
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,424
Yeah, but you miss graduation,
your birthdays, okay?

1505
00:53:57,457 --> 00:53:58,991
Uh, my d... my prom dances.

1506
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:01,861
That's a very mean thing
to do to children.

1507
00:54:01,894 --> 00:54:02,995
And, uh, if you have a family,

1508
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:04,330
- y-you're an asshole.
- No, listen, no.

1509
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:05,331
Take it easy, take it easy.

1510
00:54:05,365 --> 00:54:07,733
- Well, that's one way to look at it.
- Yeah.

1511
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:09,068
Tell that to my dad.

1512
00:54:11,237 --> 00:54:15,241
Oh, but you can't,
'cause he's dead.

1513
00:54:15,274 --> 00:54:17,743
Anybody got a good response to that?

1514
00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:20,313
Yeah!

1515
00:54:20,346 --> 00:54:22,382
Again!

1516
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:23,450
Whoo!

1517
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:26,520
What a game.
What a game.

1518
00:54:26,553 --> 00:54:28,854
So, what, I shouldn't have kids?

1519
00:54:28,888 --> 00:54:30,790
No, you... you should have kids.

1520
00:54:30,823 --> 00:54:31,958
I'm gonna have kids.

1521
00:54:31,991 --> 00:54:33,493
You know, maybe
you should take a cue

1522
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:35,828
from your shirt, you know?
Smile.

1523
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:38,365
Lighten up.

1524
00:54:38,398 --> 00:54:40,266
That's actually kind of funny.

1525
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:42,201
Guy's all right.
Why can't you be more like him?

1526
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:43,135
He's all right.

1527
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:46,038
Why can't you not
embarrass me like this?

1528
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:47,206
I'm sorry.

1529
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,276
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
in front of your friends.

1530
00:54:53,879 --> 00:54:55,848
And just-just
stick to your guns.

1531
00:54:55,881 --> 00:54:57,283
All right? It'll be fine.

1532
00:54:57,316 --> 00:54:58,385
Hey. Hey!

1533
00:54:58,418 --> 00:54:59,419
Come on in.

1534
00:54:59,453 --> 00:55:01,087
Come have breakfast with us.

1535
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,090
I made pancakes, and I made
the sausage that you like,

1536
00:55:04,123 --> 00:55:04,991
an omelet.

1537
00:55:05,024 --> 00:55:06,125
Come, come, come, come sit.

1538
00:55:06,158 --> 00:55:08,395
Man, these eggs are spectacular.

1539
00:55:08,428 --> 00:55:10,464
With the onions and the peppers.

1540
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:13,367
I love it. I love it.

1541
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,437
Did, uh, did he
sp-spend the night?

1542
00:55:17,471 --> 00:55:19,205
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1543
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:20,540
He slept here.

1544
00:55:20,574 --> 00:55:21,541
In this house.

1545
00:55:21,575 --> 00:55:23,443
I'm an adult. I can do that.

1546
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:28,047
I-I need to talk to you
about something.

1547
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,148
Okay.

1548
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:31,017
I was thinking that it's time

1549
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,152
to think about
getting your own apartment.

1550
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:34,554
What?

1551
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:36,456
W-Why would you say that?

1552
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,257
Well...

1553
00:55:39,992 --> 00:55:41,461
You are so awesome.

1554
00:55:41,495 --> 00:55:45,465
And I think I've been there
for you too much.

1555
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:48,602
'Cause sometimes in life,
the thing that's motivating

1556
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:51,137
is when people don't have
that safety net.

1557
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,039
Right, right,
but I need that safety net

1558
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:54,307
'cause I don't have
my shit together.

1559
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,376
So, like, uh,
w-why are you doing this?

1560
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,943
Is this 'cause of him?

1561
00:55:58,612 --> 00:56:00,212
No.

1562
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:03,082
It's just you're
24 years old now.

1563
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:06,952
24. I mean, Phelps had
a fistful of gold medals by 24.

1564
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:08,954
Why are you talking?

1565
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,257
I'm just giving you
some perspective, that's all.

1566
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,060
You know, Wayne Gretzky had,
like, 96 goals when he was 24.

1567
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:15,961
W-What?

1568
00:56:15,995 --> 00:56:18,097
Roger Staubach
graduated West Point,

1569
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,267
won a Heisman Trophy,
fought in the Vietnam War,

1570
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,537
and then joined the Cowboys
by the time he was 24.

1571
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:27,039
I don't know who that is,
so, s-so who-who gives a fuck?

1572
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:29,376
I think that maybe
you're-you're ready

1573
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:31,378
and you just don't even know it.

1574
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:33,647
So, you're kicking me out?

1575
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,781
No, no.

1576
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,384
I just want you to get
your own apartment by summer.

1577
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,586
Right, so you're kicking me
out of the house.

1578
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,421
That's nine months from now.

1579
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:43,623
I mean, you-you could have
a baby in nine months.

1580
00:56:43,657 --> 00:56:44,691
It's a long time.

1581
00:56:44,725 --> 00:56:46,626
Are you moving in?
Are you trying to push me out?

1582
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,095
What, like, what did I do?
I-I thought we were cool.

1583
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:51,097
Scott, Scott, let's all
be adults here. Come on.

1584
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,467
Your mother has worked
very hard for a very long time.

1585
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,234
And I'm gonna retire
in a couple years,

1586
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:59,171
so things are gonna change
around here, but in a good way.

1587
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:01,441
I mean, w-we think you...
that you can do great things.

1588
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:03,109
Yeah, I know I'm gonna do
great things.

1589
00:57:03,142 --> 00:57:05,645
But, like, I don't need you
to tell me that, like...

1590
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:07,213
This is... What's going on?

1591
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:09,115
This is... I-I...

1592
00:57:09,148 --> 00:57:10,617
I don't like this.

1593
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,452
So, be that as it may,

1594
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:14,621
until you leave...
which is gonna be good for you

1595
00:57:14,654 --> 00:57:15,988
and it's gonna be motivating...

1596
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:17,457
you're gonna have to
pull your weight

1597
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:18,692
a little more around here.

1598
00:57:18,725 --> 00:57:22,094
And one thing that we thought
would help you contribute...

1599
00:57:22,128 --> 00:57:24,398
would be easy,
wouldn't be hard to do...

1600
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:28,000
is to help Ray bring his kids
back and forth to school

1601
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:31,003
when he can't do it
because of work.

1602
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:33,005
Like now.

1603
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:34,474
Like today.

1604
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:38,277
You're joking, right?

1605
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,347
You want me to take
your kid to school?

1606
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,215
The kid that I tattooed?

1607
00:57:43,249 --> 00:57:46,420
I got two kids.
The other one's seven.

1608
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:48,455
You're gonna make me
babysit your kids?

1609
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:51,223
Do... I'm on... I do drugs.

1610
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:54,059
Well, looks like you're walking.

1611
00:57:54,093 --> 00:57:56,061
And thank you.

1612
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:59,064
I'm not cool with
any of this, okay?

1613
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:01,033
And-and where do you
expect me to live?

1614
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:02,334
And w-with what money?

1615
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:04,236
You know I'm a fucking bum,
right?

1616
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,373
Yo, this is fucked up!
Seriously.

1617
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:10,943
Especially after last night,
all that bonding boy bullshit.

1618
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:12,646
You're full of shit, man.

1619
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,614
You're a fucking liar.

1620
00:58:14,648 --> 00:58:17,349
I'm gonna go walk your kids.

1621
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:19,753
No, I'm not fucking
letting you take 'em.

1622
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:22,121
Fuck you.
Who the fuck are you?

1623
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:23,723
Yeah, I-I agree
with you completely.

1624
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:25,358
Why... 'cause that...
It was Ray's idea.

1625
00:58:25,392 --> 00:58:27,059
I don't think I should be
taking them, either.

1626
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:28,294
I agree with you.

1627
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,198
Are you a weirdo?

1628
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:33,600
Oh, the weirdest.

1629
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:35,201
Nobody's weirder than me.

1630
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:37,604
See, a weirdo wouldn't say that.

1631
00:58:37,637 --> 00:58:39,606
A weirdo would deny it.

1632
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:43,008
So, do I have to take 'em or...?

1633
00:58:45,479 --> 00:58:46,480
Yes.

1634
00:58:46,513 --> 00:58:48,415
God, no.

1635
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:50,484
I mean,
Ray was supposed to do it.

1636
00:58:50,517 --> 00:58:51,384
I can't fucking do it.

1637
00:58:51,418 --> 00:58:53,487
Their schools start
half an hour apart

1638
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,054
on the other side of town.

1639
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:02,629
So, your mom is banging my ex?

1640
00:59:02,662 --> 00:59:05,097
Yeah, I'm not thrilled
about it, either.

1641
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,634
Yeah, well, you shouldn't be.

1642
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:09,769
Harold. Kelly.

1643
00:59:09,803 --> 00:59:11,303
Come here. Come here.

1644
00:59:11,337 --> 00:59:14,474
There's something,
something kind of fun.

1645
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:15,742
Come here. Come here.

1646
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:17,444
Oh, hey, man.

1647
00:59:17,477 --> 00:59:20,714
So, this is Harold,
and this is Kelly.

1648
00:59:20,747 --> 00:59:23,416
And, uh, this is...

1649
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,819
Scott.

1650
00:59:25,852 --> 00:59:28,120
Scott. He's gonna be
taking care of you.

1651
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:30,256
- Okay? It...
- Nice to meet you, Scott.

1652
00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:32,559
Hi, Harold.
It's nice to meet you.

1653
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:34,260
For the very first time.

1654
00:59:34,293 --> 00:59:36,128
If he does anything weird,

1655
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:37,196
you tell me.

1656
00:59:37,229 --> 00:59:40,400
Even if he tells you
not to tell me, you tell me.

1657
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:44,571
I'm pretty sure he's not weird,
but I could be wrong.

1658
00:59:44,604 --> 00:59:45,639
'Kay?

1659
00:59:45,672 --> 00:59:46,740
- Love you.
- Okay.

1660
00:59:46,773 --> 00:59:47,807
- Love you, Mom.
- Seriously.

1661
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:49,409
Love you, Mom. Bye.

1662
00:59:49,442 --> 00:59:50,544
Pay attention.

1663
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:52,812
Got it.

1664
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:55,180
Hold both their hands!

1665
00:59:58,385 --> 01:00:00,319
Thank you.

1666
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:02,489
Look both ways. Look both ways!

1667
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:04,691
Tell her to stop.

1668
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:07,226
God!

1669
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:09,295
So, w-what do you like
to do, Harold?

1670
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:11,698
I like superheroes.

1671
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:13,633
Well, so does everybody.

1672
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,535
No, I make up my own.

1673
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,437
Oh, yeah? What kind?

1674
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,738
Ice Flash.

1675
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:21,106
What does he do?

1676
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:25,478
He freezes stuff
and shoots ice at people.

1677
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,481
Oh, well, that's not gonna work.

1678
01:00:28,515 --> 01:00:29,516
Why not?

1679
01:00:29,549 --> 01:00:31,451
I could just use a hair dryer
and ruin him.

1680
01:00:31,484 --> 01:00:33,218
Keep thinking, though.

1681
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:35,220
What do you got?
What do you like to do?

1682
01:00:35,254 --> 01:00:37,256
- I like to sing.
- You do?

1683
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:39,426
Could-could you sing for me?

1684
01:00:39,459 --> 01:00:40,727
Sure.

1685
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,598
♪ Oh, what a beautiful morning ♪

1686
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:45,297
Yes.

1687

♪ Oh, what a beautiful day ♪

1688
01:00:48,635 --> 01:00:49,335

1691
01:00:57,577 --> 01:00:59,345
That shit was dope.
High five.

1692
01:00:59,379 --> 01:01:00,346
She's a good singer.

1693
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,849
I don't agree with
the sentiment of the song,

1694
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:04,484
but it was really great.

1695
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:07,754
Anyway, have a great day
at school.

1696
01:01:07,787 --> 01:01:10,357
Uh... I hope it's not shitty,

1697
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:13,325
and, um, yeah, give your,
uh, sister a kiss goodbye.

1698
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,195
- We don't do that.
- Just do it.

1699
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:21,635
See? Wasn't that nice?

1700
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:23,770
Now, if she dies tomorrow,
you'll remember that,

1701
01:01:23,803 --> 01:01:25,237
that you kissed her goodbye.

1702
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:26,806
Have a good day at school.

1703
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,409
- Later, man.
- Pay attention.

1704
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:31,678
- Why would I die?
- I don't know.

1705
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:33,413
You never know
what's gonna happen.

1706
01:01:33,446 --> 01:01:35,382
Think you're immortal?

1707
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,886
This. It's this one.

1708
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:41,888
Okay. All right.

1709
01:01:43,823 --> 01:01:45,792
Well, have a good day, okay?

1710
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:47,527
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon, I guess.

1711
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,796
- Can-can I help you?
- Oh, hi.

1712
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:51,263
I'm-I'm Ray's friend.

1713
01:01:51,296 --> 01:01:53,566
I was just here
to bring her here.

1714
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:57,370
- You-you know Ray?
- I know Ray a little bit.

1715
01:01:57,404 --> 01:01:59,606
He's kind of, like,
banging my mom.

1716
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:01,340
So, yeah, I'm just, you know,

1717
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:02,375
just dropping her off.

1718
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:04,377
Did you sign in at the office?

1719
01:02:04,411 --> 01:02:06,579
No. I didn't even know
you had an office.

1720
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:08,615
Okay, um...

1721
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:09,949
Kelly? You okay?

1722
01:02:09,983 --> 01:02:11,418
Yeah.

1723
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,819
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1724
01:02:12,852 --> 01:02:14,554
You know you can tell me.

1725
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:16,321
I'm okay.

1726
01:02:16,356 --> 01:02:17,757
Do you know him?

1727
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:18,825
Yeah, kind of.

1728
01:02:18,858 --> 01:02:20,860
He's a new friend.

1729
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:22,729
Okay.

1730
01:02:22,762 --> 01:02:24,798
Oh, I trained her in the car.
She's not gonna break.

1731
01:02:24,831 --> 01:02:26,366
I'm just kidding.

1732
01:02:26,399 --> 01:02:27,967
It's, uh...
I'm not gonna hurt her.

1733
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:29,636
Um, but have a great day.
I just...

1734
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:32,405
No, uh, actually, could you,
uh, set up the paints?

1735
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:33,673
- No.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1736
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:35,274
- Uh, and just wash these brushes.
- No.

1737
01:02:35,307 --> 01:02:36,443
- Thank you so much.
- No. No.

1738
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:38,511
- Thank you!
- No.

1739
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:58,631
Did-did you happen
to get a chance

1740
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:01,333
- to take a look at the, uh...
- Yeah, I looked at your book.

1741
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:04,471
I mean, I drew like that, too,
when I was 14.

1742
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:07,006
From what I saw, you don't
really have the basics,

1743
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,942
so you got to figure that out.

1744
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:10,443
Well, yeah, that's why I'm here.

1745
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:12,645
I mean, I was hoping
I can learn from you.

1746
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:15,280
Right, well, um,
you'd be my apprentice.

1747
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:16,549
Uh, you'll be a slave
to the shop.

1748
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,419
- Hey, man. As long as I get to tattoo people, right?
- No.

1749
01:03:19,452 --> 01:03:21,821
Never. Until I say.

1750
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,491
Uh, you'll be sterilizing
needles, washing my car,

1751
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:25,625
taking the trash out.

1752
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:27,427
I mean, you're basically
our bitch.

1753
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,294
So, how much will I be,
like, making here?

1754
01:03:29,328 --> 01:03:31,064
- Dick.
- Dick.

1755
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:32,599
Okay, well...

1756
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:35,034
It's a long line of people
who want this job, man.

1757
01:03:35,068 --> 01:03:37,504
How do I, like, pay my rent?

1758
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:41,574
That one
right there is not my problem.

1759
01:03:41,608 --> 01:03:43,042
It's your first day,
you're already complaining.

1760
01:03:43,076 --> 01:03:44,343
It's kind of weird, huh?

1761
01:03:44,377 --> 01:03:46,012
Yeah, let's not do this.

1762
01:03:46,045 --> 01:03:48,081
You should take a walk.

1763
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:50,683
- Pussy.
- All right.

1764
01:03:50,717 --> 01:03:52,852
Well, could I ask you
a question?

1765
01:03:52,886 --> 01:03:54,319
If I did work here?

1766
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:55,522
Why is he still here?

1767
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:57,056
Let's say some idiot
walks in, right?

1768
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,392
And he wants to get a tattoo
of a Confederate flag

1769
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:00,460
wrapped around the Grim Reaper.

1770
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:02,529
You could tell that guy
to go fuck himself, right?

1771
01:04:02,562 --> 01:04:04,030
'Cause that's a ridiculous
tattoo to ask for.

1772
01:04:04,063 --> 01:04:06,933
It's not my place
to judge people, man.

1773
01:04:06,966 --> 01:04:08,134
I don't do that.

1774
01:04:08,168 --> 01:04:10,603
Well, what if another guy
walked in and he wanted to get

1775
01:04:10,637 --> 01:04:12,372
a tattoo of his dead friend
James on his chest, right?

1776
01:04:12,405 --> 01:04:13,840
But you know James,
and you don't want

1777
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:15,842
to give him the tattoo,
'cause you know James

1778
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:17,410
and he's an asshole
and that the world's

1779
01:04:17,443 --> 01:04:18,411
better off without him.

1780
01:04:18,444 --> 01:04:19,946
- What do you do then?
- You have a death wish?

1781
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:20,814
No, I don't have a death wish.

1782
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:22,816
But that lady
on the motorcycle does.

1783
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:24,450
She's not even wearing
any underwear.

1784
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:26,052
- She's gonna burn her pussy.
- Do you want to do this?

1785
01:04:26,085 --> 01:04:27,420
You really want
to fucking do this?

1786
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:28,320
I don't want to do
anything with you.

1787
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:29,556
I just want to know
who killed James.

1788
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:30,690
Was it the Confederate flag man?

1789
01:04:30,723 --> 01:04:31,958
Was it the motorcycle lady?

1790
01:04:31,991 --> 01:04:35,528
I got to be honest, Kelsey, you
look exactly like your picture.

1791
01:04:35,562 --> 01:04:38,097
You're kind of thicker,
more robust.

1792
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:39,599
Oh, thank you.

1793
01:04:39,632 --> 01:04:40,600
- Yeah.
- It's a compliment.

1794
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:43,970
You look a little bit like
Antonio Banderas,

1795
01:04:44,003 --> 01:04:45,138
if I squint really hard.

1796
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:46,539
Oh, please squint
all night long.

1797
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:47,740
That's great.

1798
01:04:47,774 --> 01:04:49,576
Chelsea, you are... I mean, Kelsey, I'm sorry.

1799
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:50,944
- Th-That's all right. It's only...
- Yeah, you know.

1800
01:04:50,977 --> 01:04:51,744
What's your name again?

1801
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:52,979
- I forgot already.
- Um, it's Jake.

1802
01:04:53,012 --> 01:04:53,980
Sorry about that.

1803
01:04:54,013 --> 01:04:54,948
So, uh, w-what do you do?

1804
01:04:54,981 --> 01:04:56,716
Oh, I'm studying
to work in the city.

1805
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:57,884
- Oh.
- Um, I want to make

1806
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,720
Staten Island, like,
a great place again.

1807
01:05:00,753 --> 01:05:03,590
Staten Island's already cool.
What are you talking about?

1808
01:05:03,623 --> 01:05:04,858
Yeah, it is.

1809
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:07,060
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.
- You're the first person here to say that.

1810
01:05:07,093 --> 01:05:08,695
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1811
01:05:08,728 --> 01:05:09,662
It's the best place on Earth.

1812
01:05:09,696 --> 01:05:11,865
Well, at least
on the East Coast, I think.

1813
01:05:11,898 --> 01:05:12,899
Excuse me.

1814
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,134
Oh, hey.

1815
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:16,135
- Hey.
- Hi.

1816
01:05:16,169 --> 01:05:18,504
- Hello.
- Hey.

1817
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:21,541
- Hey.
- Hey.

1818
01:05:21,574 --> 01:05:24,777
Uh, would you guys like,
uh, still or sparkling water?

1819
01:05:24,811 --> 01:05:27,447
Um, you pick.

1820
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,781
Uh, I'm more of a sparkling guy,

1821
01:05:28,815 --> 01:05:29,649
- so sparkling.
- Sparkling it is.

1822
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:31,517
But I do like tequila,
so if I could

1823
01:05:31,551 --> 01:05:33,086
get just a Patrón, you know,
with a rock.

1824
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,455
- That cool with you?
- That's fine. Yeah, that's fine.

1825
01:05:35,488 --> 01:05:36,623
- Yeah? Cool. Yeah, I prefer a tequila.
- Cool.

1826
01:05:36,656 --> 01:05:38,892
Tequila and rock. You guys
want, like, warm bread or...

1827
01:05:38,925 --> 01:05:41,494
uh, olive oil?

1828
01:05:41,527 --> 01:05:43,129
Warm bread.

1829
01:05:43,162 --> 01:05:44,797
Oh.

1830
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:48,101
Bro, did you scare off another customer?

1831
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:49,903
What's wrong with you?

1832
01:05:49,936 --> 01:05:51,537
I'm so sorry about that.

1833
01:05:51,571 --> 01:05:54,040
He has, like, nepotism,
you know?

1834
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:55,441
Is that a disease?

1835
01:05:55,475 --> 01:05:57,543
Yeah, it's a bad one.

1836
01:05:57,577 --> 01:05:59,078
I brought that guy here
to make you jealous.

1837
01:05:59,112 --> 01:06:00,146
You could give a fuck.

1838
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:01,814
T-To make me jea...

1839
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:04,083
- You don't seem jealous or upset at all.
- I do care.

1840
01:06:04,117 --> 01:06:05,618
Of course I care.

1841
01:06:05,652 --> 01:06:06,986
I chose the hottest guy
on Tinder.

1842
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,221
Look at me. Look at me.

1843
01:06:08,254 --> 01:06:09,522
Look at my tits.

1844
01:06:09,555 --> 01:06:10,790
There is literally
the Eiffel Tower...

1845
01:06:10,823 --> 01:06:12,158
it's holding them up in here.

1846
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:13,526
You look great. I'm...

1847
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:14,594
Thank you.

1848
01:06:14,627 --> 01:06:15,929
Please don't cry here.
Please.

1849
01:06:15,962 --> 01:06:17,530
You look awful.

1850
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:18,765
What? What do you mean?
What are you...

1851
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,001
Your skin looks see-through and
the circles around your eyes

1852
01:06:22,035 --> 01:06:24,537
are so dark you look like
an anorexic panda.

1853
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,506
I... Well, I-I know.

1854
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:27,874
- I know I do.
- I don't know.

1855
01:06:27,907 --> 01:06:30,109
You always look sick and pale
like you have a disease

1856
01:06:30,143 --> 01:06:32,545
but you don't know it yet,
but you literally look like

1857
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:34,013
if I touched you,
you'd just turn to dust.

1858
01:06:34,047 --> 01:06:35,715
I'm sorry.
I-I'm not doing very well.

1859
01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:37,984
I-I'm not, you know... I...

1860
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:39,752
Well, what do I tell your date?

1861
01:06:39,786 --> 01:06:41,621
I don't know.
Tell him to fuck off.

1862
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:44,624
I met him ten minutes ago.
He's a DJ.

1863
01:06:50,763 --> 01:06:53,700
Why do you not think
ice is a good superpower?

1864
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:55,868
It's amazing. I mean...

1865
01:06:55,902 --> 01:06:59,105
Ice Flash can do anything
with his ice.

1866
01:06:59,138 --> 01:07:00,707
And it's indestructible

1867
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,075
<i>'cause it's superhero ice.</i>

1868
01:07:02,108 --> 01:07:05,745
<i>He can make giant shields
that reflect anything.</i>

1869
01:07:05,778 --> 01:07:09,282
<i>He can make giant ice tanks,</i>

1870
01:07:09,315 --> 01:07:12,018
giant ice planes and giant jets,

1871
01:07:12,051 --> 01:07:14,587
<i>helicopters that shoot
giant missiles.</i>

1872
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,557
<i>I mean, think of
all the possibilities.</i>

1873
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,559
<i>That's actually kind of cool.</i>

1874
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:21,127
<i>- Thanks.</i>
<i>- You came up with that?</i>

1875
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,829
Yeah.

1876
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:25,064
You're getting, like,
really good at this.

1877
01:07:25,098 --> 01:07:26,199
Thanks.

1878
01:07:26,232 --> 01:07:28,167
What color is his shield?

1879
01:07:28,201 --> 01:07:30,136
It's, well, the color of ice.

1880
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:32,572
Well, what's the color of ice?
Is it, like, see-through?

1881
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:35,241
Like, light blue ice
or is it like...?

1882
01:07:35,274 --> 01:07:37,143
It's blue ice 'cause it's...

1883
01:07:37,176 --> 01:07:40,046
- it's, like, superhero ice, and it's cool.
- Right.

1884
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:42,215
You remember that kid Ronnie?

1885
01:07:42,248 --> 01:07:44,150
His uncle owns the pharmacy.

1886
01:07:44,183 --> 01:07:46,786
He gave me the key.
We're gonna load up on oxys.

1887
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:47,920
So, we're robbers now.
That's our future.

1888
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:50,823
Nah. Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We're gonna do this one time.

1889
01:07:50,857 --> 01:07:53,026
Get the money
to seed our dreams.

1890
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:54,594
Get that venture capital.

1891
01:07:54,627 --> 01:07:56,929
Open that tattoo restaurant
you wanted.

1892
01:07:56,963 --> 01:07:58,865
It's not that big a deal.
Jay-Z did it.

1893
01:07:58,898 --> 01:08:00,900
He sold crack
to fund his rap career.

1894
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:02,935
Aren't most of Jay-Z's friends,
like, dead or in jail?

1895
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:05,772
Yeah, but we're Jay-Z
in this situation.

1896
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:07,707
We're not Jay-Z's friends.

1897
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,009
We can't all be Jay-Z.

1898
01:08:10,043 --> 01:08:12,712
There can't be four Jay-Zs.
That doesn't make any sense.

1899
01:08:12,745 --> 01:08:14,113
You guys know I'd do anything
for you, right?

1900
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:14,981
Thank you.

1901
01:08:15,014 --> 01:08:16,682
- Appreciate you.
- Just not this. I'm out.

1902
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:17,950
What are you talking about?

1903
01:08:17,984 --> 01:08:19,752
- What?
- This is crazy.

1904
01:08:19,786 --> 01:08:21,754
Hey, we need you, all right?
You're the lookout.

1905
01:08:21,788 --> 01:08:23,022
Literally anybody
can be the lookout.

1906
01:08:23,056 --> 01:08:24,957
- I don't need to be a part of this.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1907
01:08:24,991 --> 01:08:26,826
We need you.
You're our best friend.

1908
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:27,894
- We trust you.
- Wha...

1909
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:30,129
Well, best friends
don't make other best friends

1910
01:08:30,163 --> 01:08:31,798
do stupid illegal shit.

1911
01:08:31,831 --> 01:08:33,800
You make me do stupid shit
for you all the time.

1912
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:35,635
- Like what?
- Uh, I don't know.

1913
01:08:35,668 --> 01:08:36,803
What about the time
when you thought

1914
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:37,770
- you had testicular cancer?
- Here we go.

1915
01:08:37,804 --> 01:08:38,905
- Knew this was gonna come up.
- All right?

1916
01:08:38,938 --> 01:08:42,175
And then I drive over
and you make me touch your nuts.

1917
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:44,210
I would've done it for you, bro.

1918
01:08:44,243 --> 01:08:46,380
You're like, "Hey, yo, there's
something wrong with my ass."

1919
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,047
- I'd be like, "Yo, bend over."
- Come on.

1920
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:49,982
After everything
we've done for you?

1921
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,351
What do you do for me?

1922
01:08:51,385 --> 01:08:52,952
I let you tattoo my whole body.

1923
01:08:52,985 --> 01:08:54,388
So what?
You love my tattoos.

1924
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,222
You use me
as a human sketchbook.

1925
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:57,857
I-I-I-I don't, really.

1926
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,193
I don't.
Not as much as I say I do.

1927
01:09:00,226 --> 01:09:02,728
I'm out of here. My bad.

1928
01:09:03,397 --> 01:09:04,831
You know what?

1929
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:06,065
You're a real bitch!

1930
01:09:06,099 --> 01:09:07,700
- You're a bitch!
- Shh.

1931
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:09,702
Yo, don't shush me.

1932
01:09:09,735 --> 01:09:10,970
- Oh.
- My God, look how excited she is.

1933
01:09:11,003 --> 01:09:13,373
- I'm assuming that's her.
- I started running too early!

1934
01:09:17,143 --> 01:09:19,245
Hey! Oh.

1935
01:09:19,278 --> 01:09:20,746
Oh, oh, oh, you're so skinny.

1936
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,081
- Have you been eating?
- Yeah.

1937
01:09:22,115 --> 01:09:23,249
- Hi.
- Hey.

1938
01:09:23,282 --> 01:09:25,318
How are you?

1939
01:09:25,352 --> 01:09:26,719
This is Ray.

1940
01:09:26,752 --> 01:09:27,720
- Hey. How you doing?
- Oh.

1941
01:09:27,753 --> 01:09:29,122
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1942
01:09:29,155 --> 01:09:30,723
Yeah, I feel like
I already know you.

1943
01:09:30,756 --> 01:09:32,191
Your mom talks about you
all the time.

1944
01:09:32,225 --> 01:09:33,960
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

1945
01:09:33,993 --> 01:09:35,995
No, only good stuff,
only good stuff.

1946
01:09:36,028 --> 01:09:38,764
Should we go eat? I am so sick
of eating off a tray.

1947
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:40,333
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I could eat.

1948
01:09:40,367 --> 01:09:42,402
- Could always eat.
- Uh-huh.

1949
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:43,336
Beautiful school.

1950
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:46,105
"Yeah, I could eat.
I could always eat."

1951
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:46,939
Fucking asshole.

1952
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:49,008
Look at those two angels, huh?

1953
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,209
- Yeah, I know them.
- Yeah. -

1954
01:09:50,243 --> 01:09:52,379
- Mm-hmm.
- You walk them to school, don't you? -

1955
01:09:52,412 --> 01:09:53,980
- Yeah, I know who they are.
- Oh, my God.

1956
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:56,816
- She's so cute.
- Look. Look at those curls.

1957
01:09:56,849 --> 01:09:58,251
We took them to see
<i>Stomp</i> Off-Broadway.

1958
01:09:58,284 --> 01:10:00,086
- They went crazy!
- Oh, my God.

1959
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:00,887
I love <i>Stomp.</i>

1960
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,855
What's <i>Stomp?</i> What is that?

1961
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:03,789
It's the greatest musical
of all time.

1962
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:04,790
Yeah, it's, like,
that show where

1963
01:10:04,824 --> 01:10:07,026
people play the drums
on, like, garbage cans

1964
01:10:07,059 --> 01:10:08,928
and, like, tap with broomsticks.

1965
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:09,996
- Stuff around the house.
- Yeah.

1966
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:11,797
Like, you just see a toaster,

1967
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:12,999
we make an English muffin.

1968
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:15,902
They-they see a whole song. It's incredible.

1969
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:17,870
I know a homeless guy
that plays trash can lids

1970
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:19,872
on the subway, for a dollar.

1971
01:10:19,906 --> 01:10:22,775
And then he took a shit
on the platform.

1972
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:24,810
Oh. Well, you know.

1973
01:10:24,844 --> 01:10:27,113
I don't know if he's gonna get
a Tony for that, but...

1974
01:10:27,146 --> 01:10:29,182
Maybe if they keep practicing
and get an adult diaper,

1975
01:10:29,215 --> 01:10:32,185
they can, uh, get
to Broadway someday.

1976
01:10:33,953 --> 01:10:35,321
Yeah.

1977
01:10:35,355 --> 01:10:37,357
So, are you guys really serious?

1978
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:39,091
Uh-oh.

1979
01:10:39,892 --> 01:10:41,093
Well, actually,

1980
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:46,366
I'm going up to Boston to meet
his parents at Thanksgiving.

1981
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,935
- Oh.
- What? You're going to Boston to...

1982
01:10:48,968 --> 01:10:50,870
for Thanksgiving? To wha...

1983
01:10:50,903 --> 01:10:52,004
Well, where-where am I gonna go?

1984
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:53,239
- Ah, you'll come. You can come.
- Yeah, me, too.

1985
01:10:53,272 --> 01:10:55,442
- We can all go.
- Yeah, we'd love to have you up there. - Oh.

1986
01:10:55,475 --> 01:10:57,743
You think you're gonna get
married again?

1987
01:10:57,777 --> 01:10:59,779
Oh, boy,
look what I got us into.

1988
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:01,113
Claire.

1989
01:11:01,147 --> 01:11:02,482
Well, you know what? I'll...

1990
01:11:02,516 --> 01:11:04,817
I'll, uh, I'll answer that,
you know?

1991
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,086
A couple of months ago,
I would've said no, but...

1992
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:08,921
Uh, can we go?

1993
01:11:08,955 --> 01:11:10,089
Scott.

1994
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:10,923
Don't be rude.

1995
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:12,058
Me? I'm not being rude.

1996
01:11:12,091 --> 01:11:13,493
He's talking the entire time.

1997
01:11:13,527 --> 01:11:14,794
Wha... He's the one being rude.

1998
01:11:14,827 --> 01:11:15,761
Was just making conversation.

1999
01:11:15,795 --> 01:11:16,996
Okay, so what
did you want to say?

2000
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:19,165
- Cut this shit. - Tell us now.
- All I wanted to say

2001
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:20,933
was I think
it's time to go, okay?

2002
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,502
I had a great time.
This is wonderful.

2003
01:11:22,536 --> 01:11:23,836
I think we all bonded.

2004
01:11:23,869 --> 01:11:25,972
It's time to leave now,
all right?

2005
01:11:26,005 --> 01:11:27,541
Well, we're going
to a party later,

2006
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,275
if you want to come with us.

2007
01:11:29,308 --> 01:11:30,410
You just can't embarrass me.

2008
01:11:30,444 --> 01:11:32,311
Sure, whatever. Let's just
get the fuck out of here.

2009
01:11:34,947 --> 01:11:36,949
He's in a good mood.

2010
01:11:36,983 --> 01:11:39,952
Try doing it your entire life.

2011
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,822
- We're gonna have a good night.
- Oh, yeah.

2012
01:11:42,855 --> 01:11:44,524
No, we're not.
I hate college parties.

2013
01:11:44,558 --> 01:11:46,426
You've never been
to a college party.

2014
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,994
Come on, just enjoy it.

2015
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:50,464

- Yes, relax.

01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:29,969
I can get that many tattoos,
because, like,

what if I get cast as, like,
an angelic role?

2047
01:12:57,364 --> 01:12:59,366
keeps, like, getting bigger
and bigger and bigger,

2048
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:02,569
and the wealth inequality
is just out of control,

2049
01:13:02,602 --> 01:13:06,406
and we can't continue
with capitalism this way.

2050
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,941

I'm sick of the rat race.

to the American dream?

2053
01:13:12,379 --> 01:13:15,247
I know. It's like
an American nightmare now.

01:13:29,596 --> 01:13:31,431
I know. It was so fun.

2061
01:13:31,465 --> 01:13:32,998
Yeah, like, I feel like,

2062
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:35,101
I feel like I kind of fit in
for once, you know?

2063
01:13:35,134 --> 01:13:37,336
And not everybody hated me
for the first time.

2064
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,438
You should come here.

2065
01:13:38,472 --> 01:13:41,073
Yeah? You think I can
get into a place like this?

2066
01:13:41,107 --> 01:13:42,975
I mean, you'd need a good GPA.

2067
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,276
Yeah, well, I don't have
a good one of those.

2068
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,479
I-I didn't even
graduate high school.

2069
01:13:45,512 --> 01:13:47,213
Don't you have to graduate
high school to go to college?

2070
01:13:47,246 --> 01:13:49,115
Yeah, but it's not, like,
too late to do that.

2071
01:13:49,148 --> 01:13:51,917
All right, even so, you know,
I-I'm a little too old.

2072
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:53,319
I'd look like a narc, you know?

2073
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:54,588
I would look creepy
in the corner.

2074
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:57,123
Everybody'd be like, "What's that guy doing here?"

2075
01:13:57,156 --> 01:13:59,258
Everybody here is so old.

2076
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:01,026
All right, well, I'm fucking
stupid, Claire, okay?

2077
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,328
Is that what you want me to say?

2078
01:14:02,362 --> 01:14:04,698
I can't pay attention.
I can't sit still, okay?

2079
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,366
I'm stupid.
I'm a dumb idiot.

2080
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,402
I would have to work ten times
harder than those people.

2081
01:14:08,435 --> 01:14:09,669
And everybody would
fucking make fun of me,

2082
01:14:09,703 --> 01:14:12,639
and I'm not ready to deal with
that again, all right? So, no.

2083
01:14:12,672 --> 01:14:13,640
So, that's it?

2084
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:16,008
Huh?

2085
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:17,411
That's how long
you're gonna think about

2086
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:18,678
going to college for?

2087
01:14:18,712 --> 01:14:20,279
I mean, that was, like,
a 40-second walk.

2088
01:14:20,312 --> 01:14:22,181
Uh, that's a lot of
consideration, don't you think?

2089
01:14:22,214 --> 01:14:23,583
Okay.

2090
01:14:23,617 --> 01:14:25,485
- It's your journey.
- Indeed.

2091
01:14:25,519 --> 01:14:28,254
Now, let's get down
to brass tacks, all right?

2092
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:29,689
W-What are we gonna do
about Ray?

2093
01:14:29,723 --> 01:14:31,458
- What do you mean?
- Don't act stupid.

2094
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:35,027
I mean, h-how are we gonna,
you know,

2095
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,596
get Mom to break up with him?

2096
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,197
I think he seems fine.

2097
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,299
- You think he's fine?
- What do you want?

2098
01:14:40,332 --> 01:14:42,402
It's Mom's choice to make.
We don't need to get involved.

2099
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,604
Yeah, I know, but we should
still protect her.

2100
01:14:44,638 --> 01:14:45,539
She can't just be with

2101
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:47,707
the first guy
she's been with since Dad.

2102
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:49,543
She got to, like,
peruse some dick.

2103
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:54,346
Mom doesn't need to peruse dick.

2104
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:56,383
- You know she needs to.
- I think she seems happy.

2105
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:59,185
You want her to have sex
with a ton of people?

2106
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:01,354
No, but, yeah, kind of.

2107
01:15:01,388 --> 01:15:02,589
- I mean...
- That's gross.

2108
01:15:02,622 --> 01:15:05,224
Well, if you knew something
was bad before it even started,

2109
01:15:05,257 --> 01:15:07,293
wouldn't you stop it
if you had the chance?

2110
01:15:07,326 --> 01:15:09,429
It's like that whole
baby Hitler thing, you know?

2111
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,198
If you had the chance to kill
baby Hitler before it grew up,

2112
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:13,265
wouldn't you do it?

2113
01:15:13,299 --> 01:15:15,201
Wouldn't you strangle it
until its eyes popped out?

2114
01:15:15,234 --> 01:15:17,069
So, Ray's baby Hitler?

2115
01:15:17,102 --> 01:15:19,038
Yeah. In this situation,
he is, yeah.

2116
01:15:19,071 --> 01:15:20,039
He's baby Hitler.

2117
01:15:20,072 --> 01:15:22,341
So, do you want to help me
kill baby Hitler?

2118
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:25,211
Okay, you're right, Scott.
You're right.

2119
01:15:25,244 --> 01:15:27,747
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Claire!

2120
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:29,982
Claire!

2121
01:15:36,322 --> 01:15:37,624
Tell you,
Claire really seems like

2122
01:15:37,657 --> 01:15:40,025
she's enjoying school, you know?

2123
01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:41,495
Yeah.

2124
01:15:41,528 --> 01:15:44,631
She's just blossoming.

2125
01:15:44,664 --> 01:15:46,198
Yeah.

2126
01:15:46,232 --> 01:15:48,368
Girl just seems like
she could take on the world.

2127
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:49,369
I'll tell you,

2128
01:15:49,402 --> 01:15:52,472
whatever you did with her,
you did it right.

2129
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,140
Dump some of that on Scott,
you know?

2130
01:15:57,644 --> 01:16:01,648
What do you think about
his tattoo restaurant idea?

2131
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:03,550
I think it's terrible.

2132
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:06,185
Getting a tattoo is like, uh...
it's a medical procedure.

2133
01:16:06,218 --> 01:16:07,754
You don't want to go
to the hospital

2134
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:09,656
and order supper, you know?

2135
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:14,728
I just love that he has big
dreams, but he's just so lost.

2136
01:16:14,761 --> 01:16:16,463
I mean, no matter how much I try

2137
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:19,098
to fill him with good energy,
he just...

2138
01:16:19,131 --> 01:16:21,568
he's got no self-esteem.

2139
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:24,471
He's really going nowhere.

2140
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:26,773
Don't be so hard on yourself.

2141
01:16:26,806 --> 01:16:28,274
Scientists have been
doing studies.

2142
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:30,309
They say a lot
of this stuff is genetic.

2143
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:32,546
You know, you inherit it
from your grandparents.

2144
01:16:32,579 --> 01:16:33,813
So blame them.

01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:52,719
Your daughter sang
the other day.

2308
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:53,853
What did she sing?

2309
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:56,055
Something from, like,
<i>Oklahoma!</i> or something,

2310
01:23:56,089 --> 01:23:57,991
and-and I hate that shit,
and I fucking loved it.

2311
01:23:58,024 --> 01:24:00,626
She's such a little angel.

2312
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,862
- Mm.
- I-I thought she was a robot for, like,

2313
01:24:02,895 --> 01:24:05,031
the first couple days
I was hanging out with her.

2314
01:24:05,064 --> 01:24:06,799
I know. She's so perfect.

2315
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,301
What a fucking putz.

2316
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:09,802
Yeah, so he only
wants to see them

2317
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:12,205
on Wednesday night for dinner
and Sunday.

2318
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:14,974
- You can't just pick and choose.
- And, uh...

2319
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:15,808
No, you can't.

2320
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,543
What are your kids,
the NFL package?

2321
01:24:17,577 --> 01:24:19,045
- Wait, you're only... Yeah.
- Yeah.

2322
01:24:19,078 --> 01:24:21,014
But why would you want
your kids, really,

2323
01:24:21,047 --> 01:24:25,918
if you don't have an apartment
and you sleep at the firehouse?

2324
01:24:25,952 --> 01:24:28,087
I mean, you...

2325
01:24:28,121 --> 01:24:29,288
Unbelievable.

2326
01:24:29,322 --> 01:24:30,890
What kind of a grown man

2327
01:24:30,923 --> 01:24:33,292
can't afford his own apartment
in Staten Island?

2328
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:35,061
Fucking loser.

2329
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:37,864
He lost all our money gambling.

2330
01:24:37,897 --> 01:24:43,169
He is homeless, he's penniless,
and he's a deadbeat dad.

2331
01:24:43,202 --> 01:24:45,038
What is your mom doing with him?

2332
01:24:45,071 --> 01:24:47,707
You know, my mom hasn't
gotten laid in 17 years,

2333
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,275
so I think her bar
is pretty low.

2334
01:24:49,308 --> 01:24:52,045
Really? Yeah.

2335
01:24:52,078 --> 01:24:54,180
He's good in bed,
I hate to say it.

2336
01:24:54,213 --> 01:24:55,114
All right.

2337
01:24:55,148 --> 01:24:57,850
Well, I didn't really
need to know that.

2338
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:58,718
Yeah.

2339
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:01,054
He's got a beautiful cock.

2340
01:25:01,087 --> 01:25:04,757
I mean, it's the...
it's his only attribute.

2341
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:06,926
That big thick cock
kept me in it

2342
01:25:06,959 --> 01:25:09,662
for eight years longer
than I should have stayed.

2343
01:25:09,695 --> 01:25:11,197
It's a fact.

2344
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,832
I knew I smelled you.

2345
01:25:12,865 --> 01:25:14,368
- The fuck, Scott?
- What?

2346
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,335
Huh? What, are you
spying on me now?

2347
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:17,804
- You Magnum, P.I.?
- What?

2348
01:25:17,837 --> 01:25:18,905
Telling your mom
that I'm homeless?

2349
01:25:18,938 --> 01:25:21,040
You think it's funny
to tell her that I'm a loser?

2350
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,775
What are you talking...
No. What?

2351
01:25:22,809 --> 01:25:24,210
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

2352
01:25:24,243 --> 01:25:26,145
You've been speak...
You talking to my ex-wife?

2353
01:25:26,179 --> 01:25:27,980
Uh, yeah. She's actually
a really nice person.

2354
01:25:28,014 --> 01:25:29,782
- Oh, is she? Why don't you marry her?
- Yeah.

2355
01:25:29,816 --> 01:25:31,217
Why don't you marry her
and see what the fuck happens?

2356
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,219
Hey, I'm just trying to protect
my mom from you, okay?

2357
01:25:33,252 --> 01:25:34,388
You're a fucking psychopath.

2358
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:35,755
- Oh, I'm a psychopath?
- Yeah.

2359
01:25:35,788 --> 01:25:36,856
I've been nothing
but nice to you!

2360
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:38,124
I tried giving you direction.

2361
01:25:38,157 --> 01:25:39,826
You're too busy
smoking your fucking weed.

2362
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:41,661
And all you've been doing
is trying to destroy

2363
01:25:41,694 --> 01:25:42,895
everything that I have
with Margie.

2364
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,630
Because you're
a fucking loser, dude!

2365
01:25:44,664 --> 01:25:45,965
You're a, you're a
degenerate gambler

2366
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:48,101
in your-your mid-50s,
who bets on the Jets.

2367
01:25:48,134 --> 01:25:49,969
Uh, who... Have you not learned
anything about betting?

2368
01:25:50,002 --> 01:25:51,804
- The Jets are gonna come back!
- No, they're not!

2369
01:25:51,838 --> 01:25:53,072
They got three
number one fucking picks!

2370
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,007
They're never gonna come back!
They're never gonna come back!

2371
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:56,209
I'm trying to give
your mother a good life!

2372
01:25:56,242 --> 01:25:58,845
I... No, you're not, okay?
You're a piece of shit, dude.

2373
01:25:58,878 --> 01:26:00,880
You're a fucking drug addict!
I'm a piece of shit?

2374
01:26:00,913 --> 01:26:02,815
Yeah, you're a piece of shit!
I'm a fucking loser?

2375
01:26:02,849 --> 01:26:04,117
You're the biggest loser
I ever met in my fucking life!

2376
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,318
- Oh, really? You should know.
- Yeah! Yeah!

2377
01:26:05,352 --> 01:26:06,319
You surround yourself with them.

2378
01:26:06,353 --> 01:26:07,286
- Oh, yeah? Why don't you try me?
- Oh, really?

2379
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,355
Why don't you try me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

2380
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:09,456
This ain't gonna go
how you think it's gonna go.

2381
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:12,091
So why don't you get the fuck
out of my... Really?

2382
01:26:15,995 --> 01:26:17,163
- Fucking asshole.
- Throw a fucking punch at me?

2383
01:26:17,196 --> 01:26:18,664
- Oh, yeah.
- Huh? You gonna cool off?

2384
01:26:18,698 --> 01:26:19,899
- Come here, cocksucker.
- You gonna cool off?

2385
01:26:19,932 --> 01:26:20,933
I'll fucking cool you off.

2386
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:23,636
Yeah, I'll fucking cool you off!

2387
01:26:27,707 --> 01:26:28,975
Hey, you cool off now?

2388
01:26:29,008 --> 01:26:30,743
You're in there
'cause of your own actions!

2389
01:26:30,776 --> 01:26:31,744
Are you kidding me?!

2390
01:26:31,777 --> 01:26:33,846
I'm gonna tell my mom
you tried to drown me.

2391
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,714
In an aboveground pool?

2392
01:26:34,747 --> 01:26:35,848
You're, like,
fucking eight feet tall.

2393
01:26:35,882 --> 01:26:38,017
You're lucky my dad isn't here.
He would kick your ass.

2394
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:40,420
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what,
I knew your dad. Okay?

2395
01:26:40,454 --> 01:26:42,955
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I crossed paths with him a number of times.

2396
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:46,692
And you know what? He was even
a bigger asshole than you are!

2397
01:26:47,793 --> 01:26:48,895
All right, that's it, that's it.

2398
01:26:48,928 --> 01:26:50,263
It's over. It's over.

2399
01:26:50,296 --> 01:26:51,731
Huh? Huh?

2400
01:26:51,764 --> 01:26:53,299
- You like that? You like that?
- Ow.

2401
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:03,309
- Jesus.
- Fucking asshole.

2402
01:27:03,342 --> 01:27:05,778
Come on, tap out! Tap out!

2403
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:07,313
- Fuck you! No!
- Get me out! Let me out!

2404
01:27:07,346 --> 01:27:08,448
- No! No!
- Let me out!

2405
01:27:08,482 --> 01:27:09,815
- Oh, my God!
- Get me out!

2406
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:12,185
What's the matter with you?!

2407
01:27:12,218 --> 01:27:13,387
He's a psycho.

2408
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,787
No.

2409
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,390
- We're just talking.
- About what?

2410
01:27:16,423 --> 01:27:18,858
- About him telling you lies about me.
- He's an animal.

2411
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:20,026
He picked me up
and he threw me in the pool.

2412
01:27:20,059 --> 01:27:22,396
- All right? He has to go.
- No, I need you to go. Now.

2413
01:27:22,429 --> 01:27:24,230
What? Why-why me?
He-he's the one who started it.

2414
01:27:24,263 --> 01:27:25,898
Yeah, that's right.
Get the hell out of here.

2415
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:27,800
And get a job and a life
while you're at it.

2416
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:28,935
Your freeloading days are over.

2417
01:27:28,968 --> 01:27:30,136
You, too. Get going.

2418
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:32,071
Wait, what did I do?

2419
01:27:32,104 --> 01:27:34,740
You put your hands on my son!

2420
01:27:34,774 --> 01:27:35,875
You're not respecting my family!

2421
01:27:35,908 --> 01:27:36,876
You're an animal!

2422
01:27:36,909 --> 01:27:38,211
Look, okay, just listen.

2423
01:27:38,244 --> 01:27:40,213
- Just calm down.
- I don't have to calm down!

2424
01:27:40,246 --> 01:27:41,814
What are...
You're attacking my son!

2425
01:27:41,847 --> 01:27:43,349
And you're, and you're
making up lies!

2426
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,385
You made... You tricked me into
thinking you're a good guy.

2427
01:27:45,419 --> 01:27:46,386
You're not a good guy.

2428
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:47,454
- Right. Mm-hmm.
- You're a fucking small guy.

2429
01:27:47,487 --> 01:27:50,022
Margie, Margie, just let me
explain this to you.

2430
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,091
- Just let me talk to you, okay?
- You are not in control of me.

2431
01:27:52,124 --> 01:27:53,192
Okay, okay, listen, all right?

2432
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,027
Okay, you don't have
all the information you need.

2433
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,028
All right? Scott is acting out

2434
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:57,997
'cause he's afraid
to move on with his life.

2435
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:59,499
It's no different than
when the Boston Red Sox

2436
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:00,567
finally won
a World Series, okay?

2437
01:28:00,601 --> 01:28:01,635
- Oh, my God.
- They had, they had to get to a point

2438
01:28:01,668 --> 01:28:03,470
- where-where they believed, okay?
- Just shut up.

2439
01:28:03,503 --> 01:28:04,671
- All-all...
- Shut the fuck up.

2440
01:28:04,705 --> 01:28:07,139
All I did was just ask him
a question, and he flipped out.

2441
01:28:07,173 --> 01:28:08,808
So I put him in the water,
which is soft.

2442
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:09,742
I diffused the situation.

2443
01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:11,177
It was what-what
m-my training's all about.

2444
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,546
I-I wa... I was totally
diffusing the situation.

2445
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:13,346
Do you ever shut up?

2446
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,280
Do you ever just
shut the fuck up?

2447
01:28:14,313 --> 01:28:16,282
You just talk and you talk
and you talk,

2448
01:28:16,315 --> 01:28:17,817
and you don't know
what you're saying.

2449
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,085
It makes no sense.

2450
01:28:19,118 --> 01:28:21,053
It's like you picked up
all these little pieces

2451
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,055
of information from all over.

2452
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,991
They don't make any sense.
They're fragments.

2453
01:28:25,024 --> 01:28:27,126
No sense. Nonsense.

2454
01:28:31,197 --> 01:28:32,832
I-I'm not talking.

2455
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,535
I've had it up to here.

01:28:47,581 --> 01:28:49,982
Well, where do we go now?

2461
01:28:50,016 --> 01:28:52,218
What are you asking me for?

2462

Are you mad at me?

Um, well, I've been
meaning to ask you.

Um... you know, since you're in

if you wouldn't mind me staying
at your house for a little bit.

01:30:02,456 --> 01:30:05,157
You came up here to ask me that?

- I also came to see you.
- You came...

2479

No, you didn't come to see me.
You came to ask me that.

And, no, you can't stay
at my house.

I'm sor... I have
nowhere to go, bro.

01:30:10,096 --> 01:30:11,263
- My house is frightening, dude.
- My mom kicked, my mom

2483
01:30:11,297 --> 01:30:13,367
- kicked me out.
- The fuck are you doing with your life?

2484
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,101
Drive all the way down here
just to ask me

2485
01:30:15,134 --> 01:30:16,268
if you can stay at my house.

2486
01:30:16,302 --> 01:30:17,671
- No, I-I...
- No, you don't love me.

I do love you.

And you know what?
I need you to do me a favor.

Anything, bro. Just ask.

You got to feed my cat,
all right?

2493

For the next
three to five months.

Is there anything else
I could do?

'Cause I'm-I'm kind of
allergic to cats.

You better look out
for Sprinkles,

2497

because I'm looking out
for you, all right?

And, listen, man.

2500
01:30:42,161 --> 01:30:44,130
I need you to spend time
with Sprinkles.

2501
01:30:44,163 --> 01:30:46,098
I don't want you just

2502

going in there,
feeding him and running out.

2503
01:30:48,134 --> 01:30:49,403
You got to go in there,
scratch his belly.

2504

You tell him I miss him
and I'll see him soon.

2505
01:30:53,573 --> 01:30:55,007
Right.

Um, how, uh, how are the boys?

2507

How's Igor and Richie
doing in there?

Yo. She's hot, man.

2518
01:31:18,365 --> 01:31:20,500
He was telling the truth
the entire time.

2519
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,035
- Good for him, man.

2520
01:31:23,068 --> 01:31:25,171
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

2521
01:31:32,746 --> 01:31:34,146
Hey, you.

2522
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,449
What the hell
are you doing there?

2523
01:31:35,482 --> 01:31:37,617
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was my house.

2524
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:40,654
Get out of my backyard!

2525
01:31:40,687 --> 01:31:42,955
Get the hell out of here!

2526
01:31:50,764 --> 01:31:52,666
I'm really glad we did that.

2527
01:31:52,699 --> 01:31:54,333
It was really nice.

2528
01:31:54,367 --> 01:31:55,702
Me, too.

2529
01:31:55,735 --> 01:31:57,571
That was awesome.

2530
01:31:57,604 --> 01:31:59,473
Yeah. I missed you.

2531
01:31:59,506 --> 01:32:01,575
Oh, yeah? I missed you, too.

2532
01:32:01,608 --> 01:32:02,776
Just like, uh, old times.

2533

They missed you, too.

2537
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,155
Hey, I, uh...
I'm in a bit of a situation.

2538
01:32:16,188 --> 01:32:18,758
You think I could stay here
for a few days?

2539
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:20,760
What are you talking about?

2540
01:32:20,794 --> 01:32:22,127
Well, it's silly.

2541
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:23,396
Me and Ray got into
this big fight,

2542
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:26,600
and then my mom caught us, and
she just started yelling at us.

2543
01:32:26,633 --> 01:32:30,035
And she threw us out, so...
She kind of lost her mind.

2544
01:32:31,404 --> 01:32:33,507
Is that why you're here
right now?

2545
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:35,341
No.

2546
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:37,777
Did you just fuck me
for shelter?

2547
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:39,278
No, I didn't fuck you
for shelter.

2548
01:32:39,311 --> 01:32:40,747
Uh, I-I-I didn't do anything.

2549
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:43,783
What? I didn't... I just...
I just need a place to stay.

2550
01:32:43,817 --> 01:32:45,619
Oh, God.

2551
01:32:45,652 --> 01:32:49,221
Dude, dude, how many times
we got to do this?

2552
01:32:49,255 --> 01:32:50,357
What do you mean?
I-I just want to...

2553
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:52,191
I just need...
It's just for a couple weeks.

2554
01:32:52,224 --> 01:32:53,092
It's not that big of a deal.

2555
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:56,128
A few weeks?
You just said a few days.

2556
01:32:56,161 --> 01:32:57,430
- Uh, or a couple months. It's...
- Months?

2557
01:32:57,464 --> 01:32:59,265
I'm figuring my stuff out.

2558
01:32:59,298 --> 01:33:00,534
I don't know the future.

2559
01:33:00,567 --> 01:33:03,168
Oh, my God, you...

2560
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:04,671
There you go.

2561
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,774
- What the... Hey.
- I'm not going to let myself

2562
01:33:07,807 --> 01:33:09,843
be upset by you, but
I'm gonna tell you something.

2563
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:12,144
You make me feel so crazy.

2564
01:33:12,177 --> 01:33:13,847
I'm not gonna let myself
be crazy now,

but you make me feel crazy!

2566
01:33:15,749 --> 01:33:17,216
You are so crazy that you make

2567
01:33:17,249 --> 01:33:19,553
everyone around you
feel fucking crazy.

2568
01:33:19,586 --> 01:33:21,555
The people meet you,
and they're normal people,

2569
01:33:21,588 --> 01:33:23,557
and then they hang out with you,
and then they're fucking

Jack Nicholson in <i>The Shining</i>

2571
01:33:25,124 --> 01:33:27,293
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2572
01:33:27,326 --> 01:33:30,229
I got to stay Zen.
I got to meditate.

2573
01:33:30,262 --> 01:33:33,165
I'm meditating right now,
and you got to go.

01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:35,368

- Yeah, here's your shit.

2575
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:36,436
Okay.

2576
01:33:36,469 --> 01:33:37,537
Staying calm.

2577
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:39,573
You got to leave.
It's time to go.

2578
01:33:39,606 --> 01:33:40,840
Well...

2579
01:33:40,874 --> 01:33:42,107
Get out.

2580
01:33:42,141 --> 01:33:43,710
Well, I don't have
anywhere to go.

2581
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:46,145
It's not my problem anymore.

2582
01:33:46,178 --> 01:33:48,147
Thank you for the sex.

Always with

01:35:21,775 --> 01:35:22,942
- You're right.
- He's an emotional eater.

2613
01:35:22,976 --> 01:35:25,378
Well, that's the problem
with this generation, man.

2614
01:35:25,412 --> 01:35:26,345
They can't take criticism.

2615
01:35:26,379 --> 01:35:27,881
- They get, they get all-all upset.
- I know.

2616
01:35:27,914 --> 01:35:30,282
Hey, I'm not
a whole generation, all right?

2617
01:35:30,315 --> 01:35:32,284
I'm just, I'm just a man.
A man with feelings.

2618
01:35:32,317 --> 01:35:33,653
- Oh, my God.
- Aw! - Aw!

2619
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:35,522
Now you're making me look bad.

2620
01:35:35,555 --> 01:35:37,424

- Now you're making me look bad. Stop.

Hey, Ray.

2623
01:35:44,329 --> 01:35:46,231
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2624
01:35:46,265 --> 01:35:48,401
What are you doing here?

2625
01:35:48,435 --> 01:35:50,837
Look, uh, I-I don't have
anywhere else to go, all right?

2626
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,639
I'm out of options, so...

2627
01:35:52,672 --> 01:35:53,873
Why would I care?

2628
01:35:53,907 --> 01:35:55,442
I'm sorry. Like, uh-uh...

2629
01:35:55,475 --> 01:35:57,444
Go sleep under a tree.
I don't care.

2630
01:35:57,477 --> 01:36:00,714
Do you have any idea
what you took from me? Do you?

2631
01:36:00,747 --> 01:36:03,650
Huh? You do a 60-minute
interview with my ex-wife

2632
01:36:03,683 --> 01:36:05,552
to find out
what kind of guy I am?

2633
01:36:05,585 --> 01:36:07,319
What do you think
she was gonna say?

2634
01:36:07,353 --> 01:36:09,022
- I don't know. I...
- By the way,

2635
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:10,957
I'm not a gambler, okay?
I day-trade.

2636
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,525
I don't know the difference.

2637
01:36:12,559 --> 01:36:14,561
You should've found out
before you shot your mouth off.

2638
01:36:14,594 --> 01:36:16,396
I know you smoke a lot of weed,
but you're not dumb.

2639
01:36:16,429 --> 01:36:17,397
You knew what the fuck
you were doing.

2640
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:19,599
You went to the person
that hates me the most

2641
01:36:19,632 --> 01:36:21,333
to get the worst review
you could possibly get.

2642
01:36:21,367 --> 01:36:22,869
Why didn't you come down here
and ask these guys

2643
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:23,670
what they thought of me?

2644
01:36:23,703 --> 01:36:25,739
Did you ever think
of doing that?

2645
01:36:25,772 --> 01:36:27,874
I'm sorry.
You're right. You're right.

2646
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:29,542
- Uh, I shouldn't have done...
- You're not sorry

2647
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:30,677
or you wouldn't have done it.
So now what?

2648
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:31,878
Now you don't have
a place to stay?

2649
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,847
So now you come down here
with your little puppy dog look

2650
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,882
on your face,
and I'm supposed to feel bad?

2651
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,117
Look, all I know is,

2652
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:39,886
if you're not nice to me, then
my mom will hate you forever

2653
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:41,588
and she'll never forgive you.

2654
01:36:41,621 --> 01:36:43,056
Really?
You're gonna play that card?

2655
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:46,059
It's a, it's a pretty good card.

2656
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,361
It's all I got.

2657
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,978
Ray.

2658
01:37:05,011 --> 01:37:07,413
Hey, Ray.

2659
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:09,082
Raymond.

2660
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:10,750

What?

2662
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:14,654
Hey, I can't sleep.

2663
01:37:14,687 --> 01:37:16,356
I-I never go to sleep
this early.

2664

Oh. Well, you know
what you should do?

2665
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,693
You should shut the fuck up.

2666
01:37:20,727 --> 01:37:22,595
Go to sleep.

2667
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:23,863
Thanks.

2668
01:37:23,897 --> 01:37:25,330
Can't go to sleep.

2669
01:37:25,365 --> 01:37:27,332
Why don't you
dip your weed in NyQuil,

2670
01:37:27,367 --> 01:37:29,402
you fucking drug addict?

2671
01:37:40,113 --> 01:37:41,815
Hey, w-what do I do?

2672
01:37:41,848 --> 01:37:44,651
Do what you always do.
Sit there and do nothing.

2673
01:38:15,582 --> 01:38:17,650
Hey. Where do you go
to the bathroom around here?

2674
01:38:17,684 --> 01:38:19,419
Well, number one, down there.

2675

Number two, Dunkin' Donuts
across the street.

Oh, thanks.

How'd you sleep, big man?

2679
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:37,871
I hear you're Stan's kid.

2680

It's an honor to meet you.

No.

2687
01:38:51,684 --> 01:38:53,486
No, I got this one
to impress a girl.

2688
01:38:53,519 --> 01:38:55,488
Oh? And how did that work out?

2689
01:38:55,521 --> 01:38:56,623
Not good.

2690
01:38:56,656 --> 01:38:58,691
- We've been married 18 years.
- Ooh, poor woman.

2691
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,727
- 18 years, huh?
- Congratulations.

2692
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,661
- Thank you.
- Wow.

2693

The rest I got, you know,
Maori, tribal.

2694

still doing here?

Well, you know,

2701
01:39:16,709 --> 01:39:19,646
I-I couldn't find a place
to live in just a night, so...

2702
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,048
- I believe it.

Yes, you are.

You ready to do some work?

what I'm supposed to do.

2767
01:41:52,198 --> 01:41:54,067
Then do nothing.

2768
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:58,304
Were you on the job
when Stan was killed?

2769
01:41:58,337 --> 01:42:00,773
Yeah. You know I was.

2770

you thought of when you heard?

2771
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:10,083
I-I wondered if he had kids.

2772
01:42:20,827 --> 01:42:22,795
Why do we have to clean
this thing anyway?

2773
01:42:22,829 --> 01:42:24,864
It's just gonna get fire on it.

2774
01:42:24,897 --> 01:42:26,866
You think the people
that are burning alive

2775
01:42:26,899 --> 01:42:29,068
give a fuck
if the truck is shiny?

2776
01:42:29,102 --> 01:42:30,169
Just saying.

2777
01:42:30,203 --> 01:42:32,038
I don't even know why
you got to clean the truck.

2778
01:42:32,071 --> 01:42:35,208
What, you're trying to show up
all sexy to a fire?

2779
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:37,710
I like him.

2780
01:42:49,423 --> 01:42:51,023
No! No! Stop!

2781
01:42:51,057 --> 01:42:52,859
All right!

2782
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:57,630
Let me fix that backpack.
It's slipping.

2783
01:42:59,932 --> 01:43:02,268
It's weird having you
walk me to school.

2784
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,736
Why is that?

2785
01:43:03,769 --> 01:43:06,672
'Cause Scott always walks me.

2786
01:43:06,706 --> 01:43:09,142
I walk you sometimes.

2787
01:43:09,175 --> 01:43:10,910
I guess so.

2788
01:43:12,379 --> 01:43:15,314
Is he, uh, is he weird
around you guys?

2789
01:43:15,348 --> 01:43:16,716
No.

2790
01:43:16,749 --> 01:43:18,385
He's nice.

2791
01:43:18,418 --> 01:43:20,920
He asks me how I'm doing.

2792
01:43:20,953 --> 01:43:23,289
What do you tell him?

2793
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,725
I say I'm doing fine.

2794
01:43:25,758 --> 01:43:28,728
Look, you don't have to lie to
make me feel better, all right?

2795
01:43:28,761 --> 01:43:30,897
I know me and your mom
could do a better job

2796
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:33,299
getting along through
all of this, and, uh...

2797
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,269
Hey, I'm sorry if I haven't
handled it so well.

2798
01:43:38,472 --> 01:43:40,773
What's that?

2799
01:43:40,806 --> 01:43:42,442
Oh, that's Ice Flash.

2800
01:43:42,476 --> 01:43:45,912
Scott drew it for me,
but it didn't come out so good.

2801
01:43:45,945 --> 01:43:48,748
Yeah, I think his drawings
are a little shaky.

2802
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:50,683
That's the one that I drew.

2803
01:43:53,453 --> 01:43:55,121
This is how he drew it.

2804
01:44:00,126 --> 01:44:01,361
It's good, right?

2805
01:44:01,395 --> 01:44:03,829
Yeah, it's better than good.

2806
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:06,065
Did a great job.

2807
01:44:06,098 --> 01:44:07,066
Yeah.

2808
01:44:07,099 --> 01:44:08,935
He said he was gonna teach me.

2809
01:44:08,968 --> 01:44:11,337
He said he'd teach you
how to do that?

2810
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:12,905
Yeah.

2811
01:44:13,773 --> 01:44:15,942
And he stays to his word.

2812
01:44:24,116 --> 01:44:25,918
It's so nice in here now.

2813
01:44:25,952 --> 01:44:27,820
I love it. I love the colors.

2814
01:44:27,853 --> 01:44:28,854
I love everything.

2815
01:44:28,888 --> 01:44:29,889

- Oh, hey, Scott.
- What's...

2817
01:44:31,391 --> 01:44:32,291
What's going on in here?

2818
01:44:32,325 --> 01:44:33,859
Where... Why is everything
so different?

2819
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:35,529
Isn't it nice? Do you like it?

2820
01:44:35,562 --> 01:44:38,030
Is that a pink chair?

2821
01:44:38,064 --> 01:44:40,467
- Yeah, we've been redecorating.
- W-What's up with the drapes?

2822
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:41,535
Yeah.

Yeah. Why's...

Yeah.

2827
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:49,041
Where have you been staying?

2828
01:44:49,075 --> 01:44:51,143
Oh, I've been, uh,
at the firehouse with Ray.

2829
01:44:51,177 --> 01:44:53,980
Oh, okay. Well, I'm just glad
that you're not on the street.

2830
01:44:54,013 --> 01:44:56,416
I told you he wasn't homeless.

2831
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:58,385
When you're right, you're ri...
I love this green.

2832
01:44:58,418 --> 01:45:00,186
- Yeah, well...
- We... I actually have been

2833
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:03,523
learning, uh, a lot and, like,
bonding with the guys.

2834
01:45:03,557 --> 01:45:04,890
- Oh.
- So, uh, yeah.

2835
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:06,192
Yeah, they got me cleaning.

2836
01:45:06,225 --> 01:45:08,428
Uh, they got me, like,
washing stuff and, like,

2837
01:45:08,462 --> 01:45:10,564
- working around the firehouse and...
- Mm-hmm. Oh.

2838
01:45:10,597 --> 01:45:12,798
I really understand where
you were coming from before.

2839
01:45:12,832 --> 01:45:14,166
You know, when you threw me out.

2840
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,802
Like, I think I really
got my shit together now,

2841
01:45:16,836 --> 01:45:18,871
and I'm ready to, like,
come back and...

2842
01:45:18,904 --> 01:45:20,239
Okay.

2843
01:45:20,273 --> 01:45:23,876
So, like, you think
you know what hard work is?

2844
01:45:23,909 --> 01:45:25,878
Well, I wouldn't say that,
but, you-you know,

2845
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:27,280
I-I-I definitely have an idea.

2846
01:45:27,313 --> 01:45:29,982
You mopped a floor

2847
01:45:30,016 --> 01:45:31,551
and-and you cooked.

2848
01:45:31,585 --> 01:45:33,853
You cleaned a bathroom once.

2849
01:45:33,886 --> 01:45:35,121
Oh. Oh, Scott.

2850
01:45:35,154 --> 01:45:37,923
And how's your shoulder feel
after all that very hard work?

2851
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,293
Oh, you're making fun of me.

Where's his shrine?
Where's Dad's shrine?

2863
01:45:56,342 --> 01:45:58,578
All of his stuff is gone.
All my shit's gone.

I'm sorry.

Yeah? How-how do you know?

2942
01:49:12,137 --> 01:49:14,508
I mean, back in the day,
I-I was at the same house

2943
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:16,643
with him for about
six months, so...

2944
01:49:16,676 --> 01:49:18,578
Wait, you worked with my dad
for six months

2945
01:49:18,612 --> 01:49:20,514
- and you're just telling me?
- Yeah. I mean, I...

2946
01:49:20,547 --> 01:49:22,281
Yeah, I didn't want
to make you feel weird.

2947
01:49:22,314 --> 01:49:23,483
We didn't want to insult you

2948
01:49:23,517 --> 01:49:25,485
'cause you seem
a little delicate.

2949
01:49:25,519 --> 01:49:26,720
- No. Please.
- Well, yeah.

2950
01:49:26,753 --> 01:49:28,455
What, w-what was he like?

2951
01:49:28,488 --> 01:49:30,390
He was kind of like you.

2952
01:49:30,423 --> 01:49:32,291
You know, like,
if you didn't know him,

2953
01:49:32,324 --> 01:49:34,361
you'd think he was
a crack baby, but he was...

2954
01:49:35,595 --> 01:49:37,397
No, but he was a good guy.
He was a, he was a great guy.

2955
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:39,399
- He was a great guy.
- Well, I-I, I mean, I heard

2956
01:49:39,432 --> 01:49:40,534
- he was fucking hilarious.
- Oh, yeah.

2957
01:49:40,567 --> 01:49:42,301
And-and he got away
with so much shit,

2958
01:49:42,334 --> 01:49:44,136
like, because he was
so freaking likable.

2959
01:49:44,169 --> 01:49:46,272
What kind of stuff?
Like, w-what'd he get away with?

2960
01:49:46,305 --> 01:49:48,441
One time, we were driving
down the West Side Highway

2961
01:49:48,475 --> 01:49:50,544
- after being out all night...
- Mm.

2962
01:49:50,577 --> 01:49:51,545
You know this.

2963
01:49:51,578 --> 01:49:53,145
This is a good one.

2964
01:49:53,178 --> 01:49:54,381
And, uh, he's, like,

2965
01:49:54,414 --> 01:49:56,215
he's up on the...
through the sunroof.

2966
01:49:56,248 --> 01:49:57,784
He's, like, sitting
on top of the car.

2967
01:49:57,817 --> 01:49:59,452
We're like...
We couldn't get him in.

2968
01:49:59,486 --> 01:50:02,355
So we start speeding up,
stopping short, you know.

2969
01:50:03,623 --> 01:50:08,193
By the time we hit the bridge,
he fell onto the windshield.

2970
01:50:08,227 --> 01:50:09,596
- So he's...
- What?

2971
01:50:09,629 --> 01:50:10,697
he's, like...

2972
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:11,631
What?

2973
01:50:11,665 --> 01:50:14,568
Hanging on, cursing at us,
putting his face

2974
01:50:14,601 --> 01:50:15,635
up against the windshield.

2975
01:50:15,669 --> 01:50:17,771
He's like, "You motherfuckers!"

2976
01:50:17,804 --> 01:50:20,574
It was like some real Tom Cruise shit.

2977
01:50:20,607 --> 01:50:22,174
So...

2978
01:50:24,209 --> 01:50:25,612
We get into Brooklyn.

2979
01:50:25,645 --> 01:50:27,581
And sure-sure enough,
there's cops.

2980
01:50:27,614 --> 01:50:29,716
Like, uh, like they were
waiting for us.

2981
01:50:29,749 --> 01:50:30,784
Oh, shit.

2982
01:50:30,817 --> 01:50:32,586
So now I'm like,
"Oh, fuck. We're screwed."

2983
01:50:32,619 --> 01:50:34,854
Stan gets off the car.
He goes over to the cop.

2984
01:50:34,888 --> 01:50:38,123
I'm thinking, "Oh, shit, he's
gonna fucking clock this cop.

2985
01:50:38,157 --> 01:50:39,459
He's gonna, you know..."

2986
01:50:39,492 --> 01:50:41,461
And he goes right up to him,
grabs his face,

2987
01:50:41,494 --> 01:50:43,830
and he kisses him on the lips.

2988
01:50:44,664 --> 01:50:46,298
They went to high school
together.

2989
01:50:46,332 --> 01:50:47,767
They went to fucking
high school together.

2990
01:50:47,801 --> 01:50:49,836
I'm like, "Only Stan
could get away with that."

2991
01:50:49,869 --> 01:50:51,303
I swear to God.

2992
01:50:51,337 --> 01:50:52,472
Well, you know, the rumor is

2993
01:50:52,505 --> 01:50:53,673
that he got the coke
from the cops.

2994
01:50:53,707 --> 01:50:56,342
Not that cop. There was another
cop he knew in Manhattan.

2995
01:50:56,376 --> 01:50:57,811
What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No.

2996
01:50:57,844 --> 01:50:59,512
- Coke? What? No.
- Guys, guys, guys.

2997
01:50:59,546 --> 01:51:01,581
- Guys, it's his dad.
- So?

2998
01:51:01,615 --> 01:51:02,849
- I didn't know it was a secret.
- It's his dad.

2999
01:51:02,882 --> 01:51:04,249
You can't just tease me
with that.

3000
01:51:04,283 --> 01:51:05,250
- Please, guys, but...
- It was...

3001
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:07,219
You don't understand.
My mom, my mom tells me

3002
01:51:07,252 --> 01:51:08,355
all these stories about how much

3003
01:51:08,388 --> 01:51:09,356
he's like a saint
and all that shit.

3004
01:51:09,389 --> 01:51:10,890
Like, I-I would love
to hear a coke story.

3005
01:51:10,924 --> 01:51:12,191
- Please.
- The PG-13 version.

3006
01:51:12,224 --> 01:51:13,325
No, you don't...
No, the real version.

3007
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,594
You don't understand the amount
of pressure I'm under,

3008
01:51:14,628 --> 01:51:16,596
- thinking this guy's perfect.
- All right, fuck it, fuck it.

3009
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:18,365
All right, we were
coked out of our minds.

3010
01:51:18,398 --> 01:51:19,432
- Nice.
- All right? We all were.

3011
01:51:19,466 --> 01:51:21,568
We all... Well, I mean, uh, we were.

3012
01:51:21,601 --> 01:51:23,637
- But that was a different time. I mean, we all did it.
- Right.

3013
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:24,471
This guy was the cokehead.

3014
01:51:24,504 --> 01:51:26,238
- You were the cokehead.
- All right.

3015
01:51:26,271 --> 01:51:28,207
I stopped four years ago.
You know that.

3016
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,075
What are you talk...
How do you think

3017
01:51:29,109 --> 01:51:30,377
he stayed this skinny
all these years?

3018
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:31,444
No, I have a high metabolism.

3019
01:51:31,478 --> 01:51:34,246
They should have his face
on a nickel in Bolivia.

3020
01:51:38,718 --> 01:51:40,453
But playtime
was playtime, all right?

3021
01:51:40,487 --> 01:51:42,789
Like, you know,
when he was at work,

3022
01:51:42,822 --> 01:51:45,725
he was, he was all,
you know, business.

3023
01:51:45,759 --> 01:51:48,193
All right? And he was the guy
you wanted by your side

3024
01:51:48,227 --> 01:51:50,195
if-if you were
going into a fire.

3025
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:51,398
Yeah, I mean,
if they were gonna,

3026
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:53,433
like, build a fireman
from scratch,

3027
01:51:53,466 --> 01:51:56,469
he would've been, you know...

3028
01:51:56,503 --> 01:51:57,637
- Prototype.
- Yeah. Yeah.

3029
01:51:57,671 --> 01:51:59,806
Exactly.
You know, top to bottom...

3030
01:51:59,839 --> 01:52:02,509
He's a fireman.

3031
01:52:02,542 --> 01:52:03,443
You know?

3032
01:52:03,476 --> 01:52:05,945
- You know, as brave as they come.
- Yeah.

3033
01:52:05,979 --> 01:52:09,883
You know, I was thinking about
what you said at the game

3034
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:14,186
about, you know, like,
firemen shouldn't have kids.

3035
01:52:15,855 --> 01:52:17,289
Let me tell you something.

3036
01:52:17,322 --> 01:52:19,659
You know, your dad,
he didn't just die

3037
01:52:19,693 --> 01:52:21,695
saving those two people
that night.

3038
01:52:21,728 --> 01:52:23,463
I mean, he did that a lot.

3039
01:52:23,496 --> 01:52:24,998
You know, like, sometimes,

3040
01:52:25,031 --> 01:52:26,198
he wouldn't even
wait for the line.

3041
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:28,601
He'd just, he'd just go in,
like, a fully involved room,

3042
01:52:28,635 --> 01:52:30,437
and you're, like...
I'm like, "What are you doing?"

3043
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:33,840
And because if-if he heard
there was somebody in there,

3044
01:52:33,873 --> 01:52:35,709
he'd just go in.

3045
01:52:35,742 --> 01:52:37,644
That's the way, you know...

3046
01:52:37,677 --> 01:52:38,712
He... That's who he was.

3047
01:52:38,745 --> 01:52:40,279
That's how he was built,
you know?

3048
01:52:40,312 --> 01:52:42,582
He couldn't, he couldn't
not be that way.

3049
01:52:44,617 --> 01:52:46,419
You understand?

3050
01:52:46,453 --> 01:52:49,789
Thank you. No, thank you,
thank you for sharing.

3051
01:52:49,823 --> 01:52:51,858
That's awesome.

3052
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:53,460
He would slap the shit out of me

3053
01:52:53,493 --> 01:52:56,663
if he heard me say this
about him, but he was a hero.

3054
01:52:58,364 --> 01:53:00,600
And heroes are necessary.

3055
01:53:00,633 --> 01:53:03,436
And they should be allowed
to have families, all right?

3056
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:06,372
But I know it means, you know,

3057
01:53:06,406 --> 01:53:09,008
that people suffer.

3058
01:53:09,042 --> 01:53:12,344
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

3059
01:53:12,378 --> 01:53:14,848
Well, but I'm sorry
for being a dick.

3060

3076
01:54:08,535 --> 01:54:09,702
My head hurts. I...

3077
01:54:09,736 --> 01:54:12,806
This-this is why I don't drink.
I just, I just smoke weed.

3078
01:54:14,641 --> 01:54:16,876
Hey, so what are you gonna do?

3079
01:54:18,411 --> 01:54:21,080
With-with what?

3080
01:54:21,114 --> 01:54:22,882
With your life.

3081
01:54:24,617 --> 01:54:26,786
You must be passionate
about something.

3082
01:54:28,388 --> 01:54:30,957
Um, yeah, the...
the tattoo thing.

3083
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:33,526
I... I love that.

3084
01:54:34,828 --> 01:54:36,830
Were you, like, into that?

3085
01:54:36,863 --> 01:54:41,534
No, you know, it-it takes a lot
of practice, you know, and...

3086
01:54:42,669 --> 01:54:46,472
None of my friends will let me
tattoo them anymore and...

3087
01:54:46,506 --> 01:54:48,675
Hey, why don't you
give me a tattoo?

3088
01:54:49,709 --> 01:54:51,110
What?

3089
01:54:51,144 --> 01:54:52,478
What-what?

3090
01:54:52,512 --> 01:54:53,780
Come on, I don't have
any tattoos.

3091
01:54:53,813 --> 01:54:56,850
I'm a, I'm a blank slate, man.

3092
01:54:56,883 --> 01:54:58,852
Put it on my back.
Yeah, use it for practice.

3093
01:54:58,885 --> 01:55:00,854
Well... well,
you're just saying this

3094
01:55:00,887 --> 01:55:02,488
'cause you're drunk, right?
You're not...

3095
01:55:02,522 --> 01:55:03,723
- You're not actually...
- Isn't everybody drunk

3096
01:55:03,756 --> 01:55:06,059
when they get
their first tattoo?

3097
01:55:06,092 --> 01:55:07,627
Touché, Ray.

3098
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:08,728
Yeah.

3099
01:55:08,761 --> 01:55:10,463
It's my back.
I don't give a fuck.

3100
01:55:10,496 --> 01:55:12,498
I'm never gonna see it.

3101
01:55:12,532 --> 01:55:15,735
Plus, I got to tell you
something, you know.

3102
01:55:15,768 --> 01:55:18,638
I saw that drawing
you did for Harold.

3103
01:55:20,506 --> 01:55:23,476
I was kind of blown away
by it, man. You...

3104
01:55:23,509 --> 01:55:25,478
You're getting
really good at it.

3105
01:55:25,511 --> 01:55:27,647
I'm practicing a lot.

3106
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,781
Yeah.

3107
01:55:28,815 --> 01:55:31,117
Like anything, you keep
doing it, you get better at it.

3108
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:32,719
And I, you know...

3109
01:55:32,752 --> 01:55:36,589
You know, I do want to see you
do well, all right?

3110
01:55:36,623 --> 01:55:39,492
I-I believe in you.

3111
01:55:39,525 --> 01:55:41,027
Thanks, man.

3112
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:43,997
You... you must really love me.

3113
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:45,932
I love you, too.

3114
01:55:48,935 --> 01:55:51,037
Uh, I-I appreciate that,
but I'm not ready...

3115
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:52,538
Y-You-you gonna say it back?

3116
01:55:52,572 --> 01:55:54,207
I'm not ready to say
something like that.

3117
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,642
You got to say it back.

3118
01:55:55,675 --> 01:55:57,410
What-what if I die tomorrow?

3119
01:55:58,544 --> 01:56:00,747
Then I'll be that guy saying,

3120
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,916
"You know, even though
I never said it..."

3121
01:56:06,252 --> 01:56:07,587
Uh, look...

3122
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:09,155
I would love
to tattoo your back.

3123
01:56:09,188 --> 01:56:10,690
Okay, cool.

3124
01:56:10,723 --> 01:56:14,060
All right, but here's the deal.
No unicorns.

3125
01:56:14,093 --> 01:56:15,929
- No rainbows, all right?
- Uh.

3126
01:56:15,962 --> 01:56:17,997
None of that shit
little girls like to color in.

3127
01:56:18,031 --> 01:56:18,998
Okay.

3128
01:56:19,032 --> 01:56:20,733
No body parts. No nudity.

3129
01:56:20,767 --> 01:56:22,001
- Okay.
- No Chinese letters.

3130
01:56:22,035 --> 01:56:23,536
- All right. All right, fine.
- I want, I...

3131
01:56:23,569 --> 01:56:24,537
I want to be able
to fucking read

3132
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:25,772
whatever you put back there.

3133
01:56:25,805 --> 01:56:28,741
I don't need some o-order for
orange chicken or some shit.

3134
01:56:28,775 --> 01:56:30,176
All right.

3135
01:56:30,209 --> 01:56:31,644
Here we go. You ready?

3136
01:56:31,678 --> 01:56:33,613
Yep, let's do it.
Let's get it over with.

3137
01:56:33,646 --> 01:56:35,148
Yeah, I-I really
appreciate this.

3138
01:56:35,181 --> 01:56:38,084
This is...
It's actually very nice.

3139
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:39,085
Good.

3140
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:41,487
All right.

3141
01:56:43,957 --> 01:56:46,826
Fuck.

3142
01:56:47,827 --> 01:56:49,762
Dude, why do you get these?

3143
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:51,764
Um, I don't know. I, uh...

3144
01:56:51,798 --> 01:56:53,633
Whenever I'm going
through something, I just,

3145
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:54,867
you know, I get one.

3146
01:56:54,901 --> 01:56:56,636
It relaxes me
and calms me down.

3147
01:56:56,669 --> 01:56:58,538
Helps me, like,
think things through, you know.

3148
01:56:58,571 --> 01:57:01,040
- This relaxes you?
- Yeah.

3149
01:57:01,074 --> 01:57:04,110
You ever think of taking,
like, a yoga class?

3150
01:57:04,143 --> 01:57:05,712
Meditating?

3151
01:57:05,745 --> 01:57:07,847
Why don't you just give blood?

3152
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:09,749
There's still needles involved.

3153
01:57:09,782 --> 01:57:11,517
Yeah, that's a nice tattoo.

3154
01:57:11,551 --> 01:57:12,852
It's aces.

3155
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,522
- You looking at my cards, you piece of shit?
- What?

3156
01:57:16,556 --> 01:57:17,690
No, no, no, no.
I'm talking about the tattoo.

3157
01:57:17,724 --> 01:57:18,558
What are you doing?

3158
01:57:18,591 --> 01:57:20,159
- What?
- First good hand you dealt me

3159
01:57:20,193 --> 01:57:21,160
all night, you're cheating?

3160
01:57:21,194 --> 01:57:22,128
- He was talking about the tattoo.
- Exactly.

3161
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:25,131
You are the worst liar ever.

3162
01:57:25,164 --> 01:57:26,866
What's six times four?

3163
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:28,167
24.

3164
01:57:28,201 --> 01:57:30,169
24. Yeah, 24.

3165
01:57:30,203 --> 01:57:32,572
What's seven times five?

3166
01:57:34,273 --> 01:57:37,110
- 35.
- Good job.

3167
01:57:37,143 --> 01:57:38,745
Look how smart you are.

3168
01:57:38,778 --> 01:57:39,979
I'm trying to guess
what you're drawing

3169
01:57:40,013 --> 01:57:41,748
by the, by the way
your hand's going.

3170
01:57:41,781 --> 01:57:43,816
Remember, nothing weird
or I'll kill you.

3171
01:57:43,850 --> 01:57:45,618
- Nothing weird.
- Okay.

3172
01:57:45,651 --> 01:57:46,986
It doesn't look weird, does it?

3173
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:48,054
No, not at all.

3174
01:57:48,087 --> 01:57:50,656
Oh, good, 'cause
you know I'll murder him.

3175
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:52,158
It looks wonderful.

3176
01:57:52,191 --> 01:57:54,227
Oh! Is it supposed to hurt?

3177
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:56,095
Is it supposed to hurt
that much?

3178
01:57:56,129 --> 01:57:58,097
It's-it's a needle
going into your back. Yeah.

3179
01:57:58,131 --> 01:58:01,567
I know, but I thought
I had more back fat than that.

3180
01:58:01,601 --> 01:58:03,169
Can I get a tattoo?

3181
01:58:03,202 --> 01:58:04,170
- No. No.
- Sure.

3182
01:58:04,203 --> 01:58:05,171
- All right.
- No.

3183
01:58:05,204 --> 01:58:06,172
Never.

3184
01:58:06,205 --> 01:58:07,740
Don't mess with perfection.

3185
01:58:10,676 --> 01:58:11,878
Everybody goes.

3186
01:58:11,911 --> 01:58:13,646
Both companies, first due.

3187
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:15,848
Phone alarm. Box 3-4-3.

3188
01:58:15,882 --> 01:58:18,851
18 Carpenter Avenue
between Rockland and Franklin.

3189
01:58:18,885 --> 01:58:21,054
Smoke coming from the second-
floor window of a private home.

3190
01:58:21,087 --> 01:58:22,188
Turnout.

3191
01:58:37,937 --> 01:58:39,806
Yoo-hoo.

3192
01:58:39,839 --> 01:58:41,307
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

3193
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:42,708
Hey, man. How you doing?

3194
01:58:42,742 --> 01:58:43,643
What's up, man?

3195
01:58:43,676 --> 01:58:45,078
I need some assistance
over here, please.

3196
01:58:45,111 --> 01:58:46,679
- Sure, I...
- Hey, give me a sh...

3197
01:58:46,712 --> 01:58:48,681
- Oh, my God!
- Ah, don't worry about it.

3198
01:58:48,714 --> 01:58:51,117
Listen, everything's all good.

3199
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:52,118
It's, uh, really nothing.

3200
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:53,219
I just need a little assistance.

3201
01:58:53,252 --> 01:58:54,954
This is something that needs
to be taken care of now.

3202
01:58:54,987 --> 01:58:56,856
What happened? Are you okay?
Did you get shot?

3203
01:58:56,889 --> 01:58:58,991
- Were you stabbed?
- It's not really a big deal.

3204
01:58:59,025 --> 01:59:00,860
My vape exploded in my pocket.
Just...

3205
01:59:00,893 --> 01:59:03,363
I didn't stretch
right before yoga.

3206
01:59:03,397 --> 01:59:05,965
I was playing tennis.
I slipped.

3207
01:59:05,998 --> 01:59:08,234
- Well, which one is it?
- What do you want me to say?

3208
01:59:08,267 --> 01:59:09,335
It was nothing.

3209
01:59:09,369 --> 01:59:12,839
I just need some medical
attention, but just by you.

3210
01:59:12,872 --> 01:59:15,041
Dude, I got to call 911.
I don't know what to do.

3211
01:59:15,074 --> 01:59:17,243
No, no, no, listen, listen.
No police, please.

3212
01:59:17,276 --> 01:59:18,378
Not today.

3213
01:59:18,412 --> 01:59:20,113
- What does that even mean?
- No.

3214
01:59:20,146 --> 01:59:22,148
We don't need to get
the government involved

3215
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:23,182
into this situation.

3216
01:59:23,216 --> 01:59:24,217
We can handle this together.

3217
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:26,686
Dude, I'm so high.
I can't help you right now.

3218
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:28,688
I'm high, too.

3219
01:59:28,721 --> 01:59:30,823
Well, then you know how I feel.

3220
01:59:30,857 --> 01:59:33,092
What do you want me to do?

3221
01:59:33,126 --> 01:59:34,361
Take a look at this.

3222
01:59:34,394 --> 01:59:35,995
I need some sort of foam.

3223
01:59:36,028 --> 01:59:37,730
- Holy shit!
- You got some stitching?

3224
01:59:37,763 --> 01:59:39,132
- Dude!
- Do-do you have, like, a little needle?

3225
01:59:39,165 --> 01:59:41,067
- Do you have something with a needlepoint?
- No.

3226
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:42,101
What happened?

3227
01:59:42,135 --> 01:59:44,003
It was a misunderstanding.
It was an argument.

3228
01:59:44,036 --> 01:59:46,139
But we're all friends again.
We worked it out.

3229
01:59:46,172 --> 01:59:47,206
You know how buddies get.

3230
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,242
Dude, I... We-we, we got to
take you to the hospital

3231
01:59:49,275 --> 01:59:51,744
- or you're gonna die.
- I'm not gonna die.

3232
01:59:51,777 --> 01:59:53,079
- Yes, you are.
- I'm gonna die?

3233
01:59:53,112 --> 01:59:53,913
Yeah, I'm positive.

3234
01:59:53,946 --> 01:59:55,248
I'm positive
that you're gonna die

3235
01:59:55,281 --> 01:59:56,749
if we don't go to the hospital.

3236
02:00:03,089 --> 02:00:04,757
Are there metal detectors
in here?

3237
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:05,992
I-I'm not sure. Why?

3238
02:00:06,025 --> 02:00:07,461
Don't even worry about it.

3239
02:00:07,494 --> 02:00:09,363
I'll tell you later.

3240
02:00:09,396 --> 02:00:10,897
Oh, shit.

3241
02:00:11,731 --> 02:00:13,433
- Oh, fuck.
- You'll be all right.

3242
02:00:13,467 --> 02:00:14,967
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

3243
02:00:15,001 --> 02:00:16,335
Guys, I need help!

3244
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:18,838
This guy's bleeding!
He's losing a lot of blood!

3245
02:00:18,871 --> 02:00:20,273
- I need a gurney, please!
- Oh, thank you.

3246
02:00:20,306 --> 02:00:21,974
- All right, just hold... Put...
- Thank you.

3247
02:00:22,008 --> 02:00:24,177
Put pressure on it, all right?

3248
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:26,145
Hi. This guy's been, uh,
either shot or stabbed.

3249
02:00:26,179 --> 02:00:28,347
I don't know. He's been
kind of vague about it.

3250
02:00:28,382 --> 02:00:30,917
Sir, have you been shot?
Stabbed?

3251
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:31,652
No.

3252
02:00:31,684 --> 02:00:33,920
- I fell in a thorn bush.
- Okay.

3253
02:00:33,953 --> 02:00:35,788
Have him fill out
this paperwork,

3254
02:00:35,821 --> 02:00:39,091
and the doctor will call you
when he's ready.

3255
02:00:39,125 --> 02:00:41,327
Do me a favor, man.
Can we just switch identities?

3256
02:00:41,361 --> 02:00:42,195
What? No.

3257
02:00:42,228 --> 02:00:43,329
Just let me use
your driver's license.

3258
02:00:43,363 --> 02:00:46,199
- We look nothing alike, dude.
- No one's gonna know.

3259
02:00:46,232 --> 02:00:47,200
Just trust me.

3260
02:00:47,233 --> 02:00:50,102
I'm bleeding.
It feels like I have to shit.

3261
02:00:50,136 --> 02:00:52,071
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3262
02:00:52,104 --> 02:00:53,072
I'm Margie's son. Do you know...

3263
02:00:53,105 --> 02:00:54,408
I'm Margie's son.

3264
02:00:54,441 --> 02:00:56,309
I don't know who that is.

3265
02:00:56,342 --> 02:00:58,744
I'm just filling in.

3266
02:00:58,778 --> 02:01:00,112
Okay.

3267
02:01:00,146 --> 02:01:02,114
- I know.
- My pain keeps coming.

3268
02:01:02,148 --> 02:01:04,817
Tell that fucking cocksucker,
my father, that I hate him

3269
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:07,421
and I love him at the same time
and I forgive him.

3270
02:01:07,454 --> 02:01:10,723
I-I-I do not need to do that,
because you're gonna live.

3271
02:01:11,857 --> 02:01:14,160
Tell my sister
I know she's my mother.

3272
02:01:15,194 --> 02:01:15,828
Huh.

3273
02:01:15,861 --> 02:01:17,997
Got here as soon as I could.

3274
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:19,832
Hey, man, we got to
help this guy.

3275
02:01:19,865 --> 02:01:20,833
He's bleeding out.

3276
02:01:20,866 --> 02:01:22,335
This a cop?

3277
02:01:22,369 --> 02:01:23,903
He looks like a cop.

3278
02:01:23,936 --> 02:01:25,238
Excuse me, ma'am.

3279
02:01:25,271 --> 02:01:26,473
Ray Bishop, Ladder 57.

3280
02:01:26,506 --> 02:01:28,040
We got to get this guy
some help.

3281
02:01:28,074 --> 02:01:29,275
We got to move it along here.

3282
02:01:29,308 --> 02:01:30,977
- Follow me.
- Okay, come on, buddy.

3283
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:32,111
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

3284
02:01:32,144 --> 02:01:33,779
Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

3285
02:01:33,813 --> 02:01:36,249
All right.

3286
02:01:36,282 --> 02:01:37,817
Abdominal wound!

3287
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:39,151
There we go.

3288
02:01:39,185 --> 02:01:40,387
Where? Where?

3289
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:41,787
Put him in Two.

3290
02:01:41,821 --> 02:01:42,822
In Two.

3291
02:01:42,855 --> 02:01:44,156
Let's get vitals.

3292
02:01:44,190 --> 02:01:45,825
- All right, buddy.
- All right, get him right here.

3293
02:01:45,858 --> 02:01:46,926
We got to get your shirt off.

3294
02:01:46,959 --> 02:01:48,227
Let me know if you need trauma.

3295
02:01:48,261 --> 02:01:50,229
- Oh, shit.
- Okay. Here we go.

3296
02:01:50,263 --> 02:01:53,132
- Nice and easy, nice and easy.
- I'll meet you at Six. Six.

3297
02:01:55,034 --> 02:01:57,303
You okay? It's gonna be okay.

3298
02:02:04,444 --> 02:02:05,845
He's one of your friends?

3299
02:02:05,878 --> 02:02:07,880
No, no, no.
I-I was just helping him.

3300
02:02:07,913 --> 02:02:09,048
Yeah, Scott brought him in.

3301
02:02:09,081 --> 02:02:11,017
You know, guy just kind of
wandered into the firehouse

3302
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:12,018
while we were out on a call.

3303
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:14,488
You guys are covered in blood.
Take these off.

3304
02:02:14,521 --> 02:02:16,155
Throw 'em here.

3305
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:20,527
Put 'em over here.

3306
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,161
Just leave 'em there.
Down there.

3307
02:02:22,194 --> 02:02:23,029
What's that?

3308
02:02:23,062 --> 02:02:26,065
- What's that?
- Oh.

3309
02:02:26,733 --> 02:02:29,235
I let your son practice on me.

3310
02:02:29,268 --> 02:02:31,538
How's it look? He won't let me
see it till it's done.

3311
02:02:31,571 --> 02:02:33,339
Let me see it.

3312
02:02:33,373 --> 02:02:36,208
♪ ♪

3313
02:02:39,879 --> 02:02:44,050
He, um, he-he let me do
whatever I wanted, so...

3314
02:02:46,152 --> 02:02:47,219
Jesus Christ.

3315
02:02:47,253 --> 02:02:50,923
He didn't put anything
stupid on there, did he?

3316
02:02:50,956 --> 02:02:52,359
Took forever.

3317
02:03:10,477 --> 02:03:11,977
Nah.

3318
02:03:13,112 --> 02:03:15,482
Yeah, I, um...
I can never get the eyes right

3319
02:03:15,515 --> 02:03:17,883
'cause I-I just make them
too dark, but I-I...

3320
02:03:17,917 --> 02:03:19,985
It's beautiful.

3321
02:03:20,986 --> 02:03:22,888
I'm proud of you.

3322
02:03:22,922 --> 02:03:25,324
- You could really do this.
- Thanks.

3323
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:26,992
There's not any, like,
Chinese characters

3324
02:03:27,026 --> 02:03:28,894
or anything back there,
is there?

3325
02:03:29,563 --> 02:03:31,197
No, no.

3326
02:03:31,230 --> 02:03:32,098
No, no, no.

3327
02:03:32,131 --> 02:03:33,500
You told me not to.

3328
02:03:33,533 --> 02:03:35,167
I would never disobey you.

3329
02:03:35,201 --> 02:03:37,437
Thank you for letting him
do this, Ray.

3330
02:03:37,471 --> 02:03:39,639
Oh, I didn't do anything.
I just sat there.

3331
02:03:39,673 --> 02:03:40,574
He did all the work.

3332
02:03:40,607 --> 02:03:43,377
You liked going over the spine,
didn't ya?

3333
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:45,311
Took it like a champ.

3334
02:03:45,344 --> 02:03:46,513
I sat there wincing.

3335
02:03:52,352 --> 02:03:53,587
Oh, my God.

3336
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:55,187
Can we at least
close the curtain?

3337
02:03:55,221 --> 02:03:57,323
- Oh. My guys.
- Guys, people die in here, all right?

3338
02:03:57,357 --> 02:04:00,192
- My guys. My guys.
- Uh... - Aw, come on.

3339
02:04:00,226 --> 02:04:02,529
Mom, I don't want to hug him.
He's not wearing a shirt.

3340
02:04:02,562 --> 02:04:05,064
- Come on, you can handle it.
- Ah, dude, you're so smooth.

3341
02:04:05,097 --> 02:04:07,133
You're-you're like a sea otter.

3342
02:04:07,166 --> 02:04:08,535
Please, we have to stop.

3343
02:04:08,568 --> 02:04:09,536
We have to stop.
Please. Please.

3344
02:04:09,569 --> 02:04:10,804
Please stop? Please stop.

3345
02:04:10,837 --> 02:04:13,339
But first, you will get to Lord
and Lady Stark and you will...

3346
02:04:13,373 --> 02:04:15,241
I hung out with,
like, Ray and the guys

3347
02:04:15,274 --> 02:04:17,544
from the firehouse
the other night at the bar,

3348
02:04:17,577 --> 02:04:20,279
and, um, they were just telling
all these stories about Dad.

3349
02:04:20,312 --> 02:04:22,382
And there were stories
I never heard of before,

3350
02:04:22,416 --> 02:04:25,352
like, you know, about him,
like, doing coke

3351
02:04:25,385 --> 02:04:27,721
and being hilarious.

3352
02:04:27,754 --> 02:04:29,054
- Yeah.
- You know?

3353
02:04:29,088 --> 02:04:30,956
Yeah. Yeah.

3354
02:04:32,592 --> 02:04:35,161
Well, he was hilarious.

3355
02:04:35,194 --> 02:04:36,730
Yeah.

3356
02:04:36,763 --> 02:04:38,297
Uh...

3357
02:04:38,330 --> 02:04:42,168
He was also
out of control and crazy.

3358
02:04:42,201 --> 02:04:45,104
- Do you understand?
- You can't.

3359
02:04:45,137 --> 02:04:47,106
Why-why didn't you just tell me?

3360
02:04:47,139 --> 02:04:48,475
I don't know.

3361
02:04:48,508 --> 02:04:51,177
I just... I wanted you to have
some good memories

3362
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:52,579
to offset what happened.

3363
02:04:52,612 --> 02:04:53,780
I didn't know what to-to say.

3364
02:04:53,814 --> 02:04:57,316
Was I gonna say, "Your dad
really loved watching cartoons

3365
02:04:57,349 --> 02:05:00,019
with you 'cause he was
tripping all the time"?

3366
02:05:00,052 --> 02:05:01,721
Yeah.

3367
02:05:01,755 --> 02:05:04,458
Sounds like a good dad to me.

3368
02:05:04,491 --> 02:05:05,692
No, you know what?

3369
02:05:05,725 --> 02:05:07,427
Uh, I get it.

3370
02:05:07,461 --> 02:05:13,065
Knowing that he had
his issues and... problems

3371
02:05:13,098 --> 02:05:16,202
just like everybody else,
it makes me feel better.

3372
02:05:16,235 --> 02:05:19,972
It really...
it really humanizes him.

3373
02:05:20,707 --> 02:05:23,677
Well, he was a great guy.

3374
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:26,078
He was a very complicated guy.

3375
02:05:27,714 --> 02:05:30,617
He had a really big heart.

3376
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:31,751
Mm.

3377
02:05:31,785 --> 02:05:33,520
Like, like Ray?

3378
02:05:35,221 --> 02:05:36,756
Uh...

3379
02:05:36,790 --> 02:05:39,325
Yeah, I guess, like Ray, yeah.

3380
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:40,594
Yeah.

3381
02:05:40,627 --> 02:05:43,363
Yeah.

3382
02:05:43,396 --> 02:05:47,767
Um, I guess you could say
that you have a type.

3383
02:05:47,801 --> 02:05:49,503
Uh-huh.

3384
02:05:49,536 --> 02:05:51,471
Yeah.

3385
02:05:51,505 --> 02:05:53,373
I have a type.

3386
02:05:58,612 --> 02:06:04,283
I know we don't really talk
about it much, but...

3387
02:06:05,652 --> 02:06:08,120
...I, uh...

3388
02:06:08,153 --> 02:06:10,055
I-I miss Dad.

3389
02:06:11,323 --> 02:06:13,192
A lot.

3390
02:06:17,831 --> 02:06:19,432
Yeah.

3391
02:06:21,635 --> 02:06:23,269
Me, too.

3392
02:06:30,175 --> 02:06:31,645
And, uh...

3393
02:06:34,246 --> 02:06:38,217
I'm sorry that I've been

3394
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:41,388
so difficult to deal with.

3395
02:06:41,421 --> 02:06:43,155
I'll...

3396
02:06:43,188 --> 02:06:44,824
I'll try and...

3397
02:06:44,858 --> 02:06:46,793
get it together.

3398
02:06:46,826 --> 02:06:48,595
It's just hard.

3399
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:53,198
I think it'll always be hard.

3400
02:07:05,879 --> 02:07:07,847
I, uh...

3401
02:07:07,881 --> 02:07:09,616
I really like Ray, but I...

3402
02:07:09,649 --> 02:07:11,484
He's-he's got to lose
that mustache.

3403
02:07:11,518 --> 02:07:12,352
I mean, come on.

3404
02:07:12,385 --> 02:07:14,320
When we go out in public,

3405
02:07:14,354 --> 02:07:15,722
people think that
I'm kidnapped, you know?

3406
02:07:15,755 --> 02:07:18,190
The looks that we get
at the supermarket.

3407
02:07:18,223 --> 02:07:19,726
They're like...
People-people look at me like,

3408
02:07:19,759 --> 02:07:22,127
"Are you okay?"
And I'm like, "Yeah, no, yeah.

3409
02:07:22,161 --> 02:07:23,730
It's my mom's boyfriend."

3410
02:07:32,505 --> 02:07:34,608
- All right, buddy, good luck.
- Thanks for the lift.

3411
02:07:34,641 --> 02:07:35,709
All right, man.

3412
02:07:35,742 --> 02:07:37,343
Confidence, right?

3413
02:07:37,377 --> 02:07:39,646
- Yeah.
- All right, go get 'em.

3414
02:07:41,915 --> 02:07:43,383
Hey.

3415
02:07:44,417 --> 02:07:46,753
Kelsey. Hi.

3416
02:07:46,786 --> 02:07:48,488
Hey. How are you?

3417
02:07:48,521 --> 02:07:50,790
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I just, uh...

3418
02:07:50,824 --> 02:07:52,425
I-I just wanted to talk to you.

3419
02:07:52,459 --> 02:07:54,661
Well, I have
my civil service test today.

3420
02:07:54,694 --> 02:07:55,862
Oh, yeah, I-I remembered.

3421
02:07:55,895 --> 02:07:57,430
That's why I wanted to,
you know...

3422
02:07:57,464 --> 02:07:59,231
- I have to go.
- Can I come?

3423
02:07:59,264 --> 02:08:00,400
What? Why?

3424
02:08:00,433 --> 02:08:02,369
You know, for, like,
moral support.

3425
02:08:02,402 --> 02:08:05,372
I just want to be there for you.

3426
02:08:05,405 --> 02:08:07,907
- Well, I can't stop you.
- Oh, all right, great.

3427
02:08:07,941 --> 02:08:09,909
Y-Your hair looks nice.

3428
02:08:09,943 --> 02:08:11,544
Thanks.

3429
02:08:23,657 --> 02:08:25,558
Listen, I know you probably
want to talk about

3430
02:08:25,592 --> 02:08:28,227
relationship stuff and
serious bullshit, but I can't.

3431
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:31,765
I have to study and focus right
now so I don't screw this up.

3432
02:08:31,798 --> 02:08:32,899
Okay.

3433
02:08:32,932 --> 02:08:34,299
I, um...

3434
02:08:34,333 --> 02:08:36,436
I can help you, if you like.

3435
02:08:36,469 --> 02:08:38,270
You don't want to help me.

3436
02:08:38,303 --> 02:08:40,607
Mm, yeah, I do.
I would love to.

3437
02:08:42,676 --> 02:08:45,545
Okay, w-will you just
test me on this part?

3438
02:08:45,578 --> 02:08:47,981
Yeah. That one?

3439
02:08:48,014 --> 02:08:49,716
- All right.
- Okay.

3440
02:08:49,749 --> 02:08:51,316
Here we go.

3441
02:08:51,351 --> 02:08:53,920
"Amy must complete
three tasks at work.

3442
02:08:53,953 --> 02:08:55,989
"She estimates
that the first two tasks

3443
02:08:56,022 --> 02:08:58,558
"will take her
45 minutes to complete

3444
02:08:58,591 --> 02:09:00,393
"and that the third task
will take her

3445
02:09:00,427 --> 02:09:01,928
"two hours and ten minutes
to complete.

3446
02:09:01,961 --> 02:09:03,930
"If Amy's estimate is correct,

3447
02:09:03,963 --> 02:09:07,232
how long will it take her
to complete all three tasks?"

3448
02:09:08,034 --> 02:09:10,670
Three hours and 40 minutes.

3449
02:09:10,704 --> 02:09:13,707
Did-did you just guess that
or did know the answer?

3450
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:15,542
No, that's correct.

3451
02:09:15,575 --> 02:09:17,309
That's incredible.

3452
02:09:17,342 --> 02:09:19,012
- Wow.
- It's not that amazing.

3453
02:09:19,045 --> 02:09:20,312
- It is, no.
- Relax.

3454
02:09:20,345 --> 02:09:21,548
I-I... Is it all math questions?

3455
02:09:21,581 --> 02:09:23,248
I thought it was, like,
city shit.

3456
02:09:23,282 --> 02:09:24,184
No, no.

3457
02:09:24,216 --> 02:09:25,985
You have to prove
that you're not stupid,

3458
02:09:26,019 --> 02:09:27,821
and then you can
work for the city.

3459
02:09:27,854 --> 02:09:28,988
Oh. Oh.

3460
02:09:29,022 --> 02:09:31,357
So I can never
work for the city.

3461
02:09:34,894 --> 02:09:36,696
Hey, uh, I...

3462
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:38,965
I, uh...

3463
02:09:38,998 --> 02:09:40,734
I, um...

3464
02:09:40,767 --> 02:09:41,868
I love you.

3465
02:09:41,901 --> 02:09:43,570
A lot.

3466
02:09:43,603 --> 02:09:46,673
I-I always have, and I, um...

3467
02:09:46,706 --> 02:09:49,409
That's why I always
act so weird.

3468
02:09:49,442 --> 02:09:53,312
'Cause I don't know
how to express myself.

3469
02:09:53,345 --> 02:09:55,014
Failure to do so

3470
02:09:55,048 --> 02:09:57,016
could result in serious injury.

3471
02:09:57,050 --> 02:09:59,619
- Should I ask the next?
- Yeah.

3472
02:09:59,652 --> 02:10:02,422
All right, so,
"Of the 250 people

3473

"working at a medical facility,
16% are clerks.

02:10:05,625 --> 02:10:06,793
How many are..."

3475
02:10:06,826 --> 02:10:10,430
Thank you for
riding the Staten Island Ferry.

3476
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,609
I've lost my place.

3477
02:10:25,478 --> 02:10:29,649
"Of the 250 people
working at a medical facility,

3478
02:10:29,682 --> 02:10:31,518
- 16% are clerks."
- Mm-hmm.

3479
02:10:31,551 --> 02:10:33,520
"How many are not clerks?"

3480
02:10:33,553 --> 02:10:35,088

3482

Hey, will you wait for me
while I do it

3483
02:10:51,971 --> 02:10:54,440
and then we can go back
to Staten Island together?

3484
02:10:54,474 --> 02:10:57,342
Yeah. Of course.
How long are you gonna be?

3485
02:10:57,377 --> 02:10:59,412
Three and a half hours.

All right.

- Really?
- Yeah, I'll go figure something out.

3488

Okay.

3489

Good luck.

3491

Maybe do something cultural.

3492

Like, broaden your horizons.
