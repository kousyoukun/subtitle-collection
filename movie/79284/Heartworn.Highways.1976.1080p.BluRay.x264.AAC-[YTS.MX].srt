Yeah.

Being in a group thing,

103
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,064

not a maker of licks.

105

The song's not a--

106
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:39,987
it's not a lick song anyway.

107
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,488
It's a groove.

108
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,866
It's a groove, and it
got a little better.

109
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:46,827
It's like hitting first,
second, third, fourth gears.

110
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,831
Bass kicks in with a full
[inaudible] instead of--

111
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:52,833
of one every four.

112
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,711
Then when you jump in, and
then when the drum goes--

113
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:59,131
that's second and third, then
you can become high gear.

114

As a matter of fact--

lonesome campfire thing.

Ohoopee River Bottomland.

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:06,211
Mm-hmm.

190
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:07,129
Mm-hmm.

191
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,761
A hot dry highway,
a Utah byway, a semi

Thank you.

00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,226
Oh, thank you.

195
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:24,605

a greener pasture?

197
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:28,984
I said, no sir.

198
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,445
I said, no sir.

199

Met a few people that's
friends of mine, most of Utah's

Salt Lake City

202
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:41,580
There's some folks in Georgia
that care a little 'bout me.

203
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:46,376
I'm leaving for home as soon
as I can, Lord, to the Ohoopee

00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:47,878
River Bottomland.

205
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,758
To the Ohoopee River Bottomland.

We're trying to get up there.

[inaudible] 10-4.

233
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,004
I had some people here
from New York the other day--

234
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:13,422
two boys--

235
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:17,175
and he had his
guitar and a harp.

236
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,219
And I went up there
and got it out.

237
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,430
[inaudible] come
here to play music.

238
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,265
And so far we got him a job.

239
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:24,308
Estelle got him going.

240
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,727
And he's doing pretty good now.

241
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,979
He's in the roofing business
and he wanted to be in the music

242

business [inaudible].

243
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:34,359
Of course, people is looking
for progress everyday,

244
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:37,738
but I believe that the old
time flavor has really come out

245
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,324
of your country music
and so on by moving

246
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,409
that show into a modern house.

247
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,369
Because in the grand--
in the old Grand

248
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:49,333
Ole Opry building up here, he
was so country-fied in there.

249
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:52,419
You know, kind of
like us old folk is.

250
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:55,756
We like to remember
what we growed up with.

251
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:59,217
And the Grand Ole
Opry growed up--

252
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:03,638
within itself, it growed up
to be a country music place.

253
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,183
Now they've gone out
there and got modern,

254
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:09,478
and it just don't seem
right to me to see a--

255
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,437
on a Saturday night--

256
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:12,272
Saturday evening TV show.

257
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:15,484
It don't seem like the
music's any good to me

258
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:16,401
at the new place.

259
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:22,366
I'd go up there, and Star
would just come out in the back

260
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:23,825
and run in there
and get them a beer,

261
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,327
get them whatever they
wanted then before they

262
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,621
had to go back on air.

263
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:31,416
And [inaudible]
kind of home folk.

264
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,544
Now it kind of seemed like
they a little bit snobbish.

265
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:37,839
[inaudible] but they're
little bit snobbish.

266
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:39,841
They get to fighting
over the swimming pool.

267
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,177
They get to fighting each other
and all that kind of stuff.

268
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:45,138
They didn't used to have that
[inaudible] had Ole Opry House.

269
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,681
It's like Roy Acuff.

270
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,434
All he has now to
live on is a name.

271
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:51,478
That's all he has to live on.

272
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,023
These fellows here that's
coming up and they are given--

273
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:56,775
well, something like
my grandchildren

274
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,819

275
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:01,488
They are giving my
grandchildren something like we

276
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,157
look back to Roy Acuff for.

277
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,076
We look back to him,
and we look to Johnny

278
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:07,744
Cash and so on and so forth.

279
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:12,249
To my-- my opinion Johnny
Cash is he's run out of his--

280
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,418
he's done shot his wad.

281
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:19,381
I believe that Johnny Cash
has done already shot his wad.

282
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,716
I'd like to introduce myself.

283

00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,001
No, thank you.

301
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:57,169
I'll have one.

302
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,253
Would you hold the gun?

303
00:15:58,545 --> 00:15:59,171
No.

304
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:11,057
Don't ever aim a
gun at a caged animal.

305
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,602
Don't ever aim a gun
at a caged animal.

00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:14,644

00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:47,052
It's 42 feet up to their.

316
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:48,470
I got an intercom up there.

317
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:50,722
I can order Cindy around

318
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:52,766

319
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:55,143

321
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,522

00:16:58,813 --> 00:16:59,856
White dog.

323
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,400
No, he ran off by now,
but he was sitting

324
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:03,318
right there looking at them.

325
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,277
The big black dog?

326
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:05,153
Yeah.

327
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,446

328
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,324
Oh, little Smith
and little Weston.

329
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:10,784
Say hello to the folks, Smith.

330
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:14,913
He's actually a champion
white buf chicken.

331
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,998
White buf, B-U-F, like Buffalo.

332

[chickens cackling]

333
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:27,300
Now this was a-- a possum
was trying to get them,

334
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:29,177
but that's all we got left.

335
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,388
The old dog [inaudible]
just came up and just kind

336
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,806
of nipped him right off there.

337
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:35,308
It was either that or a
midget, hungry midget.

338
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,020
I've raised these rabbits
for about three years now.

339
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:41,231
I have, like, gotten--

340
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:45,485
made my motto the
bigger, the bunnier.

341
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:48,697
It's pretty funny, but I tell
you what's funnier, the better.

342
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:52,075
You see, the bigger,
the better, right?

343
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,452
And I want you all to
follow me over here,

344
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:56,997
and I'm going to show
you one of these holes.

345
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,626
I call them holes.

346
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,169
Some people call them burrows.

347
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:04,713
They're just the
entrance to the burrows.

348
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,590
Follow me over here.
It's not very far.

349
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:14,514
Here's one.

350
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:18,727
CAMERAMAN: Phew.

351
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,895
I'm talking about
some big rabbits.

352
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:25,525
[inaudible] they're like as big

This is there latest one.

They drink some.

00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:29,362
Come over here and
look at this one.

356
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,031
We had to close this one
up because the state--

357
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:33,158
the state said close it up.

358
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,701
I don't blame them really.

Now see, I'm serious.

361
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,291
They started barreling
under here and--

362
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:53,428
get this off me.

363
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,347
Get this off me.

00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,101
It's got my leg.

It's [inaudible]

367
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:09,277
Then I also played with
the Gully Jumpers, Paul

368
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:10,737
Warmack and his Gully Jumpers.

369
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:16,326
That's been back, oh,
around '37 and '38.

370
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:19,788
You know, it's been,
oh, many moons ago,

371
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,333
but I played with them.

372
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,960
It's been years ago.

373
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:33,426
Then I also played with
old Uncle Dave from 1937

374
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:37,597
until 1941.

375
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:45,522
And we recorded, Uncle Dave
and I, for Columbia Records.

376
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:51,528
We had to go to Charlotte,
North Carolina from Nashville.

377
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,280
We had quite a time you
know getting up there.

378
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:56,783
Uncle Dave, you know, he
didn't want his toddy time.

379
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:59,536
He carried a little
valise, you know,

380
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:01,538
where he carried
his [inaudible]..

381
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,790
And I recall that's the
first time that I ever

382
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:06,000
rode a Pullman train,
you know, where

383
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,752
I had a berth to sleep in.

384
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:11,172
Why, I felt like I was in
some kind of a big kingdom

385
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:13,049
or something, you know.

386
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:15,677
Because I lived in a
lower end housing project.

387
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:17,303
And what did you do
whenever [inaudible] he had

388
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,431
to have his little toddy time?

389
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:20,849
He said toddy time.

390
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:22,600
We all had toddy time.

391
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:25,353
And I recall, too,
very distinctly--

392
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:28,398
you know, if he give you
a drink out of his bottle

393
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,484
before toddy time,
why, he'd expect

394
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:34,112
you the next day to repay that.

395
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:38,158
And you had you had to give
him your toddy time drink,

396
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,828
you know, because he didn't
want to be beat out of anything.

397
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,787
You better.

398
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,956

I feel mighty bad.

Four monkey wrenches,
a two-horse shay,

a pair of old britches,
and a bale of hay.

That's what I was called,
nicknamed Walking Blacksmith.

466

Because--

467
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:28,591
I didn't have
any transportation.

468
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,343
I had to catch the
bus and then wait

469
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:34,097
for people to pick me up on the
ranch, carry me to the ranch.

Lived here, but I 'd

474
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:46,692
go out up on the
bus to those towns,

475
00:26:46,984 --> 00:26:48,528
and they'd carry
me to the ranch.

476
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:57,328
I got a knack for handling
stock, any kind of stock.

477
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,040
In other words, some men go
up to a horse to shoe him,

478
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:04,043
and they go up there cursing
him and kicking him in the side

479
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:06,420
and jacking him to
make him stand still.

480
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:07,839
But you want to go
up to a horse's head

481
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:11,050
first and pet him on the
neck and scratch him.

482
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:12,802
And I don't care
how bad and rough

483
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:17,014
he is, he'll soon understand
that you want to be his friend.

484
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:20,309
And you go on and ease with
him and handle him careful.

485
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:24,230
And once you get him shod, he'll
always know what you want to do

486
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,190
when you start to work on him.

487
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:28,484
But if you put the
shoe on correctly,

488
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:32,029
the outside of the hoof is
where you put your nail.

489
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:34,991
It's just like cutting
your fingernails.

490
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:37,493
If you cut your fingernail
down too deep there,

491
00:27:37,785 --> 00:27:39,453
you got to clip
your sore finger.

492
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:43,332
If you stick a nail on the
inside of his coronary band

493
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:46,335
and go into the quick
and drive it in there,

494
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:47,920
you get [inaudible]
and beside you

495
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,548
[inaudible] and then the
horse is lame for a long time.

496
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,551
Probably may go into lockjaw.

497
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:56,929
So it's very technical.

498
00:27:57,221 --> 00:27:58,723
I always keep doing something.

499
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,766
If it ain't much, do a little.

500
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,977
And don't ever forget to
get down on your knees

501
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:05,521
and pray to God and
thank Him for the time

502
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:07,356
that He'd given you on earth.

503
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:09,942
And from there, go on
and talk to the Lord

504
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:12,987
just like you talk to
us humans on earth.

505
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,032
Live careful and eat
three times a day,

506
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:19,952
and eat common, plain
food, soul food like beans,

507
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:22,371
turnip greens, and cornbread.

508
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:24,624
Drink the best of
bourbon whiskey.

509
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,877
People condemn whiskey,
but they have no right to.

510
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:29,378
Really?

511
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,340
Because when God created
the heaven and earth,

512
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:35,009
he created all things.

513
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:39,138
He also created
barley, rye, and if he

514
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,182
didn't think that
was good for man,

515
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:43,434
he wouldn't let
those things grow.

516
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:44,393
Really?

517
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:45,728
CAMERAMAN: Amen.

518
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,525
But he also created
cattle of the fields

519
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:56,030
and birds of the air, and
food for us to subsist on.

520
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:58,032
But he didn't mean
for us to eat so much

521
00:28:58,324 --> 00:29:02,411
of it until it was detrimental
to us, would make us sick.

522
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:05,414
The same thing applies
to drinking whiskey,

523
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:08,417

You don't have to drink
a bottle of whiskey

because you see a
bottle sitting there.

526
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:17,009
Drink a little bit of it and
stop, and ask God to give

527
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:19,470
you the knowledge to do that.

528
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:23,641
I've seen Unc drink until
he had to be carried--

529
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,435
he had to be carried from
the other side of his yard

530
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:28,396
and put into bed.

531
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:31,440
And it didn't take no
barrel of whisky, either.

532
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,526
But now then on
the other hand,

533
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:38,072
according to Mr. van
Zandt's statement,

534
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:41,284
he have also seen me sit down
where there's a lot of whiskey,

535
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:44,870
like we've got whiskey
here now, but he

536
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:48,874
didn't see me drink all of it.

537
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:52,169
I would drink some
and walk away from it.

538
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:55,756
And he's also felt kind of
embarrassed because he's

539
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:58,384
offered me whiskey,
and I didn't want it.

540
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:00,136
And he'd asked me,
was I angry with him?

541
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:01,304
I wasn't angry.

542
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:03,764

no more whiskey.

00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:02,675
You just wet it, melts, and
then you can repair stuff.

696
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:06,221
So one of the marks of really
fine instruments is it's not

697
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:12,435
put together with some
sort of insoluble glue,

698
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,979
because then you can't-- you
can't take the fingerboard off

699
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:17,107
and straighten the
neck, or do-- you know,

700
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:22,404
you wind up with something
that doesn't do anything.

701
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:23,571
That's the only
thing about guitars.

702
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:24,906
That's why I like them.

703
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:26,658
When you come to the
subtleties of them,

704
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,327
you can't really count on
any kind of mathematics--

705
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:33,957
or you count on mathematics
as far as a scale's concerned.

706
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:36,459
But once it gets down
to making it play right,

707
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:37,627
everyone's different.

708
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:40,422
You know, they're
like [whistles]

709
00:48:40,713 --> 00:48:41,965
really unique things.

710
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:43,758
So you wind up treating
everyone different,

711
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,886
and then working on
them, you don't get bored

712
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:49,973
which is one of my main aims.
OK.

713
00:48:50,265 --> 00:48:51,433
Now linchpins.

714
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:58,314
What'd I do with them?

715
00:48:58,606 --> 00:48:59,315
There they are.

716
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:10,201
All right.

717
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:12,871
That looks just about
right to me already.

718
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:18,293
Here you go.

719
00:49:18,585 --> 00:49:20,253
All right.

720
00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:24,257
Give me that string right there.

721
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:26,259
OK.

722
00:49:26,551 --> 00:49:28,720
[guitar strings twanging]

723
00:49:31,431 --> 00:49:32,724
Give me the next one.

724
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:35,226

[MUSIC - GUY CLARK, "TEXAS
COOKING"]

726
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,954
(SINGING) I'm going
down to Austin, Texas.

727
00:49:55,246 --> 00:49:57,540
I'm going down to save my soul.

728
00:49:57,832 --> 00:50:02,128
Get that barbecue and chili,
eat my fill then come back home.

729
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,839
I'm gonna take my baby with me.

00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:07,342

735
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,282
Whoa, my momma, eat it
every day if I could.

736
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:33,785
[music playing]

737
00:50:51,803 --> 00:50:56,391
I know a place that got fried
okra, beat anything I ever saw.

738
00:50:56,683 --> 00:50:58,393
I know a woman cook cabrito.

739
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:01,229
It must be against the law.

740
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,898
We gone get a big
ole sausage, big ole'

741
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,109
plate of ranch style beans.

742
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:08,319
I could eat the heart of Texas.

743
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:11,030
We gonna need some
brand new jeans.

744
00:51:11,322 --> 00:51:16,244
Whoa, my momma, ain't that
Texas cooking something?

745
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:20,873
Whoa, my momma, it'll stop
your belly and backbone bumpin.

746
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:25,670
Whoa, my momma, ain't

00:51:25,962 --> 00:51:30,508
Whoa, my momma, eat it

748
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,346
Whoa, my momma, ain't that

00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:49,444
Whoa, my momma, eat it
every day if I could.

752
00:52:19,265 --> 00:52:22,018
[applause and cheering]

753
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:25,772
Now nothing too exciting
ever happened at Charlie's

754
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:28,441
except when Harvey came in.

755
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:32,528
Harvey was a prominent, devout,
deeply committed, totally

756
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,574
involved, commode-huggin drunk.

757
00:52:36,866 --> 00:52:38,910
He dealt mainly
in small numbers.

758
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:41,454
He'd steal hubcaps
off Peterbilt diesels

759
00:52:41,746 --> 00:52:43,748
at the A&W root
beer parking lot,

760
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,793
and fence them at the
Western auto store.

761
00:52:47,085 --> 00:52:50,505
He would dynamite catfish and
copious commercial quantities

762
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:52,507
in the little
Econlockhatchee River

763
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:57,512
and sell them in bulk to
Howard Johnson's for scallops.

764
00:52:57,804 --> 00:52:59,305
Cut them out with a copper tube.

765
00:53:03,476 --> 00:53:05,978
But he was chiefly
celebrated among the populace

766
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,064
of our community
for having imported

767
00:53:08,356 --> 00:53:14,153
into our thankful midst a young
woman of sporting morality.

768
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:18,032
An unconscionable aesthete
by the name of Marita,

769
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:21,202
who had been drummed out of
high rolling society in Phoenix

770
00:53:21,494 --> 00:53:24,205
City, Alabama, after
her health card

771
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:27,333
had been punched so many times
it disappeared into thin air.

772
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,085
[laughing]

773
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:32,088
And this Marita considered
herself an interpreteress

774
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,840
of the modern dance.

775
00:53:34,132 --> 00:53:37,552
And lo, whenever the dulcets and
mellifluous tones of Miss Peggy

776
00:53:37,844 --> 00:53:40,263
Lee were heard to resonate
upon the Wurlitzer,

777
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:42,807
singing that grand
old American standard,

778
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:48,521
"Fever", Marita would lose
herself in an engaging series

779
00:53:48,813 --> 00:53:52,275
of peregrinations, pirouettes,
and bumps and grinds,

780
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:55,445
calculated to leave even the
most diffident of observers

781
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:59,282
fraught with horn.

782
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:03,578
On this particular night, Harvey
and Marita and a randy retinue

783
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:07,081
of red necks came stopping into
Charlie's All the local good

784
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:09,959
old boys were bellied up the
bar, snapping the suspenders

785
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:12,295
on their big dads,
their left hands

786
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:15,965
upraised in that fervent type of
monodigital articulation which

787
00:54:16,257 --> 00:54:18,509
bespeaks an argument in progress
about the relative merits

788
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:20,386
of post-hole digging
attachment for John Deere

789
00:54:20,678 --> 00:54:23,431
vis a vis International
Harvester tractors.

790
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:26,225
They turn about and beheld the
entry of Harvey and Marita,

791
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:29,771
and in a great man swarm gaggle
of Arcadian under-achievers,

792
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:33,065
they slewed, crabwise, over the
polished floor of that gaming

793
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:36,068
establishment, stoking
the juke with legal tender

794
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:41,282
in such a manner that Peggy
Lee's " Fever" played 92 times.

795
00:54:41,574 --> 00:54:45,578
And Marita so lost herself
in a transcendental evocation

796
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,372
of her timeless art,
struggling gamely

797
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:51,626
as it were up the Olympiad
of her sensibility,

798
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:54,670
that she shucked her duds right
on Charlie's Terrazzo floor.

799
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:00,051
That's the second
most exciting thing

800
00:55:00,343 --> 00:55:01,928
that ever happened
around a turkey farm

801
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,224
after the great massacre of '53.

802
00:55:06,516 --> 00:55:09,685
I responded to this
visual phenomenon

803
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,855
of unslaked carnality
by instantly

804
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:17,401
proposing marriage to a one-eyed
waitress who happened by.

805
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:19,320
I didn't want to get
in anything heavy.

806
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:21,072
I just wanted to
set up light house

807
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:25,159
keeping in a pup tent in the
parking lot until closing time.

808
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:27,620
I was out there with my
borrowed ball peen hammer

809
00:55:27,912 --> 00:55:29,163
and my steel tent
stakes, putting

810
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:32,166
that mother up in the asphalt.

811
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:35,211
Some fool run over my
foot with a pickup truck,

812
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:37,797
emptied out his ash
tray in my sleeping bag,

813
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:40,550
peed in my cook fire.

814
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:44,720
And the woman rejected
me, so I had to go

815
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:48,683
home and write this damn song.

816
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:52,979
I just wanted you to know the
true story so you'd understand

817
00:55:53,271 --> 00:55:56,482
where art comes from.

818
00:55:56,774 --> 00:55:58,484
On that night of nights,
there were a mess

819
00:55:58,776 --> 00:56:02,738
of us knocking around Charlie's,
scarfing up huge quantities

820
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,324
of an Appalachian
ambrosia concocted

821
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:10,288
by craven miscreant
name Matlo, who

822
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,958
along with a hand-picked group
with charcoal-filtered fellows

823
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,795
from Moore County,
Tennessee, turns

824
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:23,217
this fire water out in what
is rumored to be short supply.

825
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,428
Although armed with
approximately $8

826
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,055
and the address of
any whiskey store,

827
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:30,182
I've never yet failed
to find at least

828
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,351
five shelves groaning
under the weight

829
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:35,688
of these rare square bottles.

830
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,441
I'm not talking about Jim Beam.

831
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:40,610
I ain't talking
about Ezra Brooks,

832
00:56:40,902 --> 00:56:44,155
or JW Dent, or George Dickel.

833
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:47,658
I'm talking about Tennessee
sour mash sipping whiskey.

834
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,827
I'm talking about
Jack Daniels Tennessee

835
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:51,579
sour mash sippin' whiskey.

836
00:56:51,871 --> 00:56:53,706
And this is the old
black label blue.

837
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:56,125
[music playing]

838
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,511
(SINGING) A Cabaret
on the highway.

839
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:11,641
You know the time
is ten 'til two.

840
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:19,523
A pretty waitress at my table,
a pretty waitress at my table.

841
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:22,276
She say, what can I do for you?

842
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:25,279
That's just what she said, now.

843
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:32,954
Oh, baby, I'm so lonely
and my mind is ill at ease.

844
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:36,540
I need a woman to love me.

845
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:38,250
Mm.

846
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:42,880
But if you cannot love me, then
Jack Daniels, if you please.

847
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:51,389
Whiskey and water,
oh whiskey and water.

848
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,644
Here's to fear of
pain and sorrow.

849
00:57:56,936 --> 00:57:59,271
Jack Daniels, if you please.

850
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,147
Look out now.

851
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:02,650
[music playing]

852
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,633
Then I called on
Miss Maggie Gentry.

853
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:31,721
You know, I fell way
down upon my knees.

854
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:36,934
Now Maggie darlin', I need
some lovin', oh, deep,

855
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,520
deep down in my dark ol' soul.

856
00:58:39,812 --> 00:58:42,481
Won't you set my mind at ease?

857
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:49,530
Oh, baby, I believe
I'm going to love you,

858
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:52,408
so lay your head
down across my knees.

859
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,784
Thank you, darlin'.

860
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:56,328
I'm going to kiss you
and I'll caress you.

861
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,663
Mm.

862
00:58:57,955 --> 00:58:58,998
But honey, there's
just one little thing

863
00:58:59,290 --> 00:58:59,999
I'll ask you for first.

1038
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,145
Because the only
time you see him

1039
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:18,231
is when you cause a problem,
so he can't help you.

1040
01:13:18,523 --> 01:13:20,150
And when [inaudible] was--

1041
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:22,527
had this prison here,
and I came out here

1042
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:24,613
and he asked me about
this place here,

1043
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:26,990
and I said, well I said I
think your biggest problem is

1044
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:29,159
that when you shut
Brushy Mountain down,

1045
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:30,535
you overcrowded
your prison here.

1046
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:32,329
And I think that you
have to get something

1047
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:33,830
to take the place
of Brushy Mountain

1048
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:35,332
if you can't open that back up.

1049
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:37,709
But you have to have a
separate place, you know,

1050
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:39,461
for old timers.

1051
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:42,839
Because old timers don't like to
be around no young [inaudible]..

1052
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:44,466
I mean, they--
motherfuckers in here

1053
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:46,676
trying to pull time, that's
what they're [inaudible]..

1054
01:13:46,968 --> 01:13:48,386
I just got my daddy
out of prison.

1055
01:13:48,678 --> 01:13:50,096
I don't know whether you
all-- last time I was here,

1056
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:51,640
we was talking about that.
He was--

1057
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:53,183
- He was in prison?
- Oh, life.

1058
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:54,809
Yeah.

1059
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:56,728
He did a life sentence, and
me and my youngest brother

1060
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,229
just got-- he's
been out one year.

1061
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:00,899
He came home for Christmas
in his first airplane.

1062
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:02,609
We met him at the
airport, and he was--

1063
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:03,526
he was scared to death.

1064
01:14:03,818 --> 01:14:05,737
You know, he-- he just--

1065
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:08,949
he was just biting
his nails and shit.

1066
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,367
But I wasn't a criminal.

1067
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:11,868
When I first went to the
Boy's lndustrial school

1068
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,453
in Lancaster was because
my parents didn't want me,

1069
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:14,996
you know?

1070
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,623
So they went down and said,
well, we don't want him.

1071
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:18,041
You got to do
something with him.

1072
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,793
Well, they couldn't put
me in a children's home

1073
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:21,753
because I had parents, so they
put me in star commonwealth

1074
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:23,672
for boys in Albion, Michigan.

1075
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:25,757
I was there for two weeks and
ran away with two older boys.

1076
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,425
They stole a car and we
sat on each other's laps,

1077
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:30,011
and one worked the
pedal and one steered.

1078
01:14:30,303 --> 01:14:32,305
Got home and my parents
called up and turned us in.

1079
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,273
[music playing]

1080
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,237
[vocalizing]

1081
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:01,126
Woo.

1082
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:44,586
Women loving outlaw,
heard folks say.

1083
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:47,380
And I'll be an outlaw
till my dying day.

1084
01:15:50,842 --> 01:15:53,094
[applause and cheering]

1085
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:55,930
You know.

1086
01:15:56,222 --> 01:15:57,432
I got a big Greyhound
bus out here,

1087
01:15:57,724 --> 01:15:59,059
and there ain't nothing
out there but Cadillacs.

1088
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:01,603
These guards all
drive Cadillacs.

1089
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:02,479
That's the truth.

1090
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:03,438
No, it really is.

1091
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,857
It's the truth.

1092
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:09,402
Now they told me that you all
had a lot of drugs in here.

1093
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:10,653
So now if they're
driving Cadillacs

1094
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:11,780
and you've got
drugs in here, then

1095
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:13,448
there must be a connection.

1096
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:16,701
So I decided that I would
call the FBI up and tell them

1097
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:18,119
that there was
drugs in the joint

1098
01:16:18,411 --> 01:16:19,704
and Cadillacs in
the parking lot.

1099
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:21,748
And I figured that the
drugs and you ought

1100
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,333
to be in the parking
lot, and the Cadillacs

1101
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:24,709
and them ought to be in here.

1102
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:27,170
[applause]

1103
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:31,758
Well, you know, I started
sniffing this typewriter fluid.

1104
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,177
You know-- you know how you
sniff typewriter fluid [sniffs]

1105
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:35,553
on the rag and everything?

1106
01:16:35,845 --> 01:16:37,847
And we got really, you
know, pretty wasted.

1107
01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:39,474
Well, they got a
truck that comes in

1108
01:16:39,766 --> 01:16:41,726
and brings guard's uniforms
to the laundry, you know,

1109
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:43,103
and they wash the
guards clothes.

1110
01:16:43,394 --> 01:16:44,270
So this guy came in
there with the truck,

1111
01:16:44,562 --> 01:16:45,313
and he parked it and got out.

1112
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:46,815
And I says, hey, man--

1113
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:49,109
I'd only been here about
three weeks, you know--

1114
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,151
I said, man, the guy--

1115
01:16:50,443 --> 01:16:51,986
the truck's still running.

1116
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:52,946
The guy said, yeah man.

1117
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:53,988
So I said, man, shit.

1118
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,031
Let's get out of here, you know.

1119
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:56,324
Let's take that truck and go on.

1120
01:16:56,616 --> 01:16:58,159
You ain't got nothing
but an old fence.

1121
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,078
So we jumped in
his truck [vroom]

1122
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,832
across the yard, 55 miles an
hour, right into the gate,

1123
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:06,501
nothing happened.

1124
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,544
Nothing happened, man.

1125
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:08,670
It didn't even move, you know?

1126
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,296
So we jumped out
the truck and we

1127
01:17:10,588 --> 01:17:12,048
got these little knives that
we made, and we're saying,

1128
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:12,924
mother fucker!

1129
01:17:13,216 --> 01:17:15,135
Open the gate!

1130
01:17:15,426 --> 01:17:17,929
He's standing with a machine
gun, saying-- laughing.

1131
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:20,181
Saying, are you guys crazy?

1132
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:22,016
Man, you better open this gate!

1133
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:23,309
With a little old knife, man.

1134
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:24,727
This guy's got a gun.

1135
01:17:25,019 --> 01:17:26,146
So they took me to the
hole and kicked my ass

1136
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:28,398
and transferred me to
Lewisburg Penitentiary.

1137
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,900
Well, I got up there and
I decided, well, man,

1138
01:17:31,192 --> 01:17:32,110
I'm gonna be cool, you know?

1139
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:33,903
I'm not going to
nothing wrong, so I

1140
01:17:34,195 --> 01:17:35,405
was walking in the dining hall.

1141
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:37,115
And I was only 18 years
old at the time, you know?

1142
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,325
I still had one of those spit
curls in my hair, you know?

1143
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:41,119
Man, you know how when you
walk in the dining hall,

1144
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:43,329
it's just [blabbing].

1145
01:17:43,621 --> 01:17:44,747
You know, everything
is going on.

1146
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:45,957
Man, I walked in
the dining hall.

1147
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:47,709
I heard all this shit.

1148
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:48,751
I got to the door, and I walked
in and all of a sudden it was--

1149
01:17:49,043 --> 01:17:53,047
[shush] just total silence.

1150
01:17:53,339 --> 01:17:58,386
I looked around, everybody
was looking at me, you know?

1151
01:17:58,678 --> 01:18:04,475
They was looking at me like I
was Marilyn Monroe, you know?

1152
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:06,477
So by the time I
get to the table--

1153
01:18:06,769 --> 01:18:07,604
they got the seat--
you know, they

1154
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:08,897
seat six people at a table.

1155
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:10,773
Well, all the table
is full over here,

1156
01:18:11,065 --> 01:18:12,317
and the guards stand here.

1157
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:13,443
Some guy gets up and starts
talking to the guard.

1158
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:14,736
Hey, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1159
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:16,237
By the time I get
to the table there's

1160
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:17,405
three dudes sitting there
and another dude holding

1161
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:19,407
my chair for me, you know?

1162
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:22,327
So I sit down and put my
tray down here, you know,

1163
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:23,494
and they started
firing them quick.

1164
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:24,746
Where you from?
What you doing?

1165
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:26,247
What you in here for?
Where you going?

1166
01:18:26,539 --> 01:18:27,248
How did blah, blah, blah--
firing them questions.

1167
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,499
Do you want any cigarettes?

1168
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,126
You need any-- I
said, whoa, wait, man.

1169
01:18:30,418 --> 01:18:33,213
Shit, wait a minute,
man, you know?

1170
01:18:33,504 --> 01:18:35,381
I stayed in my cell,
you know, I was in--

1171
01:18:35,673 --> 01:18:36,507
you didn't have to go nowhere.

1172
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,176
I didn't go nowhere.

1173
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:40,511
I stayed in my cell
for three weeks.

1174
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,013
Didn't eat, didn't go
to supper or nothing.

1175
01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:43,014
I was scared, you know?

1176
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:44,933
I was 18 years old, scared.

1177
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:46,226
So they come by and
they had a pass.

1178
01:18:46,517 --> 01:18:47,560
They took me up to
the warden's office.

1179
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:50,313
And he says, what's
wrong with you, boy?

1180
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:52,106
I said, there ain't
nothing wrong me, captain.

1181
01:18:52,398 --> 01:18:53,983
I just don't want to go out
there with all them animals,

1182
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:55,485
you know?

1183
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:56,319
And he said, ah, them boys
ain't going to hurt you.

1184
01:18:56,611 --> 01:18:57,946
I said, OK, man.

1185
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:00,156
So they put me out there in
the population, you know?

1186
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:02,450
Well, the first day
I was there, there

1187
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:04,619
was two dudes standing over here
washing their clothes in them--

1188
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:06,204
in the mop buckets, you know?

1189
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,455
And this other dude
come up and says,

1190
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:09,999
say, man, you got my bucket.

1191
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,627
Dude said, man,
it's a state bucket.

1192
01:19:12,919 --> 01:19:14,337
He said, man, that's
my bucket, man.

1193
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,089
Give me my bucket.

1194
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:17,674
Man, get out of
here, mother fucker.

1195
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:20,843
I'm washing my-- man,
give me that bucket.

1196
01:19:21,135 --> 01:19:22,679
The dude stabbed
the dude to death

1197
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:25,348
right there in front of me, man,
over a state mop bucket, right?

1198
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,516
They care that you do that?

1199
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:27,767
I said, oh man.

1200
01:19:28,059 --> 01:19:31,562
Shit, I'm not staying
here, you know?

1201
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:33,356
Two days later I'm running
across the yard, man.

1202
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:35,275
You know, I'm out there and
everybody's playing football.

1203
01:19:35,566 --> 01:19:37,443
And all of a sudden, some
