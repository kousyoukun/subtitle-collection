1
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:21,036
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:33,599
You know, I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now.

3
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:35,962
If I wanted to.

4
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:39,483
You know, kiddo.

5
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:47,323
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:53,721
to know that there's nothing sadistic
in my actions.

7
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:59,322
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

8
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,682
But not you.

9
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:07,205
No, kiddo.

10
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:17,242
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

11
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:18,999
Bill.

12
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,240
It's your baby.

13
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,122
Coming!

14
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,800
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

15
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
What you gonna do now?
What you got?

16
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:39,564
I got your ass!
Remember that? Remember?

17
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:49,838
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

18
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:54,603
Come on.
Bring it on.

19
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:32,916
Mommy, I'm home.

20
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:34,486
Hey, baby.

21
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,364
How was school?

22
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:41,956
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

23
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,601
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his little ass

24
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:48,042
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

25
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:50,516
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

26
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:52,802
Baby, now,
you can't come in here.

27
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:57,199
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

28
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:05,602
This is an old friend of Mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

29
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:07,439
Hi, honey.

30
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:10,519
I'm...
What's your name?

31
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:16,117
Her name is Nikki.

32
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,845
Nikki.

33
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,439
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

34
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,565
How old are you, Nikki?

35
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:30,203
Nikki... asked you
a question.

36
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,159
I'm 4.

37
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,124
4 years old?

38
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:40,844
You know,
I had a little girl once.

39
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,841
She'd be about 4 now.

40
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:49,406
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend

41
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,523
got some grown-up talk
to talk about.

42
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:52,801
You go in your room.

43
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,720
I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

44
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,638
Okay?

45
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,281
Nikkia!

46
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,404
In your room.
Now.

47
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,078
You want some coffee?

48
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,796
Yeah. Sure.

49
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,040
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name</i>
<i>is Jeanne Bell.</i>

50
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,687
<i>Her husband is</i>
<i>Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

51
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,235
<i>But back when we were acquainted,</i>
<i>four years ago,</i>

52
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,318
<i>her name was Vernita Green.</i>

53
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:39,160
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.</i>

54
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:40,839
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

55
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,679
Do you have a towel?

56
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,325
Yeah.

57
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,395
Thanks.

58
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,318
You still take cream
and sugar, right?

59
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,442
Yeah.

60
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:58,041
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology?

61
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,924
You suppose correctly.

62
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,567
Look, bitch, I need to know

63
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:05,320
if you're gonna start any more shit
around my baby girl.

64
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:07,637
You can relax for now.

65
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,116
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

66
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:14,556
That's being more rational

67
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,797
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

68
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:20,960
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

69
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,003
Not rationality.

70
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:28,836
Look.

71
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,122
I know I fucked you over.

72
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:32,322
I fucked you over bad.

73
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:35,001
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

74
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,598
You have every right
to want to get even.

75
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,996
No, no, no, no, no.

76
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,315
No.

77
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,922
To get even, even Stephen,

78
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:50,923
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

79
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
then wait for your husband,
the good Dr. Bell, to come home,

80
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,080
and kill him.

81
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,042
That would be even, Vernita.

82
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,118
That'd be about square.

83
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,244
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

84
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,158
But I can't.

85
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,920
All I can tell you is that
I'm a different person now.

86
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:11,646
Oh, great.

87
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:12,797
I don't care.

88
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,718
Be that as it may,

89
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,685
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

90
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:21,680
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

91
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:25,999
Bitch, you can stop right there.

92
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:28,438
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

93
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:29,801
before the eyes of your daughter

94
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,242
does not mean that parading her
in front of me

95
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:35,000
is gonna inspire sympathy.

96
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:38,363
You and I have
unfinished business.

97
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,278
And not a goddamn thing
you've done

98
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,800
in the subsequent four years,

99
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:45,880
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

100
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,162
So when do we do this?

101
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,283
It all depends.

102
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,927
When do you want to die?

103
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:56,726
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

104
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,126
How about tonight, bitch?

105
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,198
Splendid.
Where?

106
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,596
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach Little League

107
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,518
about a mile from here.

108
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,518
We meet there around 2.30
in the morning,

109
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:10,520
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

110
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:13,121
And we have us a knife fight.

111
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,243
We won't be bothered.

112
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:20,003
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

113
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:30,396
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

114
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:31,920
with an edged weapon.

115
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,202
Fuck you, bitch.

116
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,403
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

117
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:40,366
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass,
Black Mamba.

118
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,684
Black Mamba.

119
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,486
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

120
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,682
Weapon of choice?

121
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,327
If you want to stick with
your butcher knife, that's fine.

122
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,003
Very funny, bitch.

123
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:55,119
Very funny!

124
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:53,637
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

125
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,642
For that, I'm sorry.

126
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,725
But you can take my word for it.

127
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:06,360
Your mother had it coming.

128
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:26,795
When you grow up, if you
still feel raw about it...

129
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:32,038
I'll be waiting.

130
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:38,236
For those regarded as warriors...

131
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,684
When engaged in combat...

132
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:46,086
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

133
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:53,761
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...

134
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:04,237
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

135
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:15,879
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

136
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,802
Come on out to Dallas.

137
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:45,562
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

138
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,603
And next, we got some record.

139
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:51,202
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.

140
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:29,283
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

141
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,835
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

142
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:37,166
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

143
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:40,040
Give me a figure.

144
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,163
Nine dead bodies.

145
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:44,602
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

146
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,485
Bride. Groom.

147
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,205
Reverend.

148
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,198
Reverend's wife.

149
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:55,242
They even shot that old coloured fella
that plays the organ.

150
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,242
It would appear to me
somebody objected to this union

151
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,636
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

152
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:08,476
Good gravy, Marie.

153
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,161
What'd I tell you, Pop?

154
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:18,239
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

155
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:21,160
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

156
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:24,239
- You're in a house of worship.
- Sorry, Pop.

157
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:28,447
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

158
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:33,237
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

159
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,795
Four, maybe five strong.

160
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,445
How can you tell?

161
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:41,156
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

162
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:44,567
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.

163
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,605
This is the work of a salty dog.

164
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,645
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

165
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:54,003
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

166
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:57,204
all the colours are kept
inside the lines.

167
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:01,599
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

168
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,398
Who's the bride?

169
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:15,476
Don't know.

170
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,523
The name
on the marriage certificate

171
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:20,519
is Arlene Machiavelli.

172
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,325
That's a fake.

173
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,319
We've been calling her "The Bride"
on account of the dress.

174
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,205
You can tell she was pregnant.

175
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:29,925
Man would have to be a mad dog

176
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:33,795
to shoot a goddamn good-Iooking gal
like that in the head.

177
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,318
Look at her.

178
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,481
Hay-coloured hair.

179
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,523
Big eyes.

180
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,761
She's a little
blood-spattered angel.

181
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,760
Son Number One?

182
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:52,962
Yeah?

183
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:57,598
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

184
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:29,204
I might never have liked you.

185
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:33,123
Point in fact, I despise you.

186
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:38,598
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

187
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:44,404
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

188
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:47,240
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

189
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:51,286
My gift to you.

190
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,955
For fuck's sake.

191
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,402
Hello, Bill.

192
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:06,958
What's her condition?

193
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,117
Comatose.

194
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:11,320
Where is she?

195
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:14,524
I'm standing over her right now.

196
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:16,598
That's my girl.

197
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,800
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

198
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,002
What?

199
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:24,566
We owe her better than that.

200
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,319
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

201
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,965
Will you keep your voice down?

202
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,844
You don't owe her shit!

203
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,918
May I say one thing?

204
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,725
Speak.

205
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,764
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

206
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:38,838
But you didn't kill her.

207
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,485
And I put a bullet in her head.

208
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,843
But her heart
just kept on beating.

209
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,155
Now, you saw that yourself

210
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:49,923
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

211
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:54,243
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

212
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:58,479
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

213
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:01,285
But one thing we won't do

214
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:05,724
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

215
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:09,402
and kill her in her sleep.

216
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:12,160
And the reason
we won't do that thing

217
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:17,037
is because that thing
would lower us.

218
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:20,160
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

219
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,395
I guess.

220
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,876
Do you really have to guess?

221
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:26,837
No.

222
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:29,760
I don't really have to guess.

223
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,803
I know.

224
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:34,082
Come on home, honey.

225
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,317
Affirmative.

226
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,603
I love you very much.

227
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:43,155
I love you, too.

228
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:47,198
Bye-bye.

229
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:01,043
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

230
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:06,007
Word of advice, shithead.

231
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:09,124
Don't you ever wake up.

232
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:48,881
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

233
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:52,039
Bill, it's your baby.

234
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:54,803
Oh, my baby.

235
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:21,681
Four years.

236
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:23,598
Four years.

237
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:53,881
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

238
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,559
You getting your freak on
or what?

239
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,922
Oh, yeah, boy.

240
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:03,723
20, 40, 60, 75.

241
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,367
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

242
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:07,357
Rule number one.

243
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:08,482
No punching her.

244
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,205
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

245
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:11,959
or less some teeth, jig's up.

246
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,436
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

247
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,119
By the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

248
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:17,686
It's a motor-reflex thing.

249
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:19,439
But spit or no, no punching.

250
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:22,485
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

251
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:25,684
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites. No hickeys.

252
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,156
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

253
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,557
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

254
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:33,440
Her plumbing down there
don't work.

255
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,040
Feel free to come in her
all you want.

256
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,640
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

257
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:38,524
I'll be back in 20.

258
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:40,880
Yeah.

259
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:42,719
Oh, shit.

260
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,958
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

261
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,880
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

262
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:51,277
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

263
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,516
Bon appétit, good buddy.

264
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,283
Oh, yeah.

265
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:08,636
Oh, God damn.

266
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:12,322
You are the best-Iooking girl
I've had today.

267
00:28:57,767 --> 00:29:00,520
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

268
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:02,165
Coming in, ready or not.

269
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:05,603
Hey, buddy, did you have yourself
a good time, man?

270
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:37,606
Where's Bill?

271
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,200
Where's Bill?

272
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:42,555
Please stop hitting me.

273
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,603
Where's Bill?

274
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,760
I don't know who Bill is!

275
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:48,246
Bullshit!

276
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:59,521
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

277
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:02,644
Jane Doe? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

278
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,365
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

279
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:08,759
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

280
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:14,040
Your name is Buck.

281
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:15,526
Right?

282
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:18,846
And you came here to fuck.

283
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:20,155
Right?

284
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,124
Wait a minute.
Wait.

285
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:48,524
"Pussy Wagon."

286
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:50,359
You fucker.

287
00:31:16,487 --> 00:31:19,320
Texas. Okay.

288
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:03,285
Wiggle your big toe.

289
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:09,761
Wiggle your big toe.

290
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:19,715
Wiggle your big toe.

291
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:27,566
Wiggle your big toe.

292
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:33,525
Wiggle your big toe.

293
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,802
<i>As I lay in the back</i>
<i>of Buck's truck,</i>

294
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:38,242
<i>trying to will my limbs</i>
<i>out of entropy...</i>

295
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:40,045
Wiggle your big toe.

296
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:43,756
<i>I could see the faces of</i>
<i>the cunts who did this to me.</i>

297
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:46,919
<i>And the dicks responsible.</i>

298
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:53,843
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper</i>
<i>Assassination Squad.</i>

299
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:57,045
<i>When fortune smiles</i>
<i>on something</i>

300
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:59,561
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge,</i>

301
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:03,242
<i>it seems proof like no other</i>
<i>that not only does God exist,</i>

302
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:05,397
<i>you're doing his will.</i>

303
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:08,001
<i>At a time when I knew the least</i>
<i>about my enemies,</i>

304
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,839
<i>the first name</i>
<i>on my death list,</i>

305
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:13,806
<i>O- Ren Ishii,</i>
<i>was the easiest to find.</i>

306
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,117
<i>But when one</i>
<i>manages the difficult task</i>

307
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:18,721
<i>of becoming queen</i>
<i>of the Tokyo underworld,</i>

308

<i>one doesn't keep it a secret,</i>
<i>does one?</i>

309
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:38,037
<i>O- Ren Ishii was born</i>
<i>on an American military base</i>

310
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:40,357
<i>in Tokyo, Japan.</i>

311
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,723
<i>The half-Japanese, half-Chinese</i>
<i>American army brat</i>

312
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:47,163
<i>made her first acquaintance</i>
<i>with death at the age of 9.</i>

313
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,078
<i>It was at that age</i>
<i>she witnessed</i>

314
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,885
<i>the death of her parents</i>
<i>at the hands</i>

315
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:56,485
<i>of Japan's most ruthless</i>
<i>yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.</i>

316
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,846
Mommy.

317
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,723
<i>She swore revenge.</i>

318
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:19,518
<i>Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto</i>
<i>was a paedophile.</i>

319
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:24,965
<i>At 11, she got her revenge.</i>

320
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:30,840
Look at me, Matsumoto...

321
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:35,837
...take a good look at my face.

322
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:39,922
Look at my eyes.

323
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,883
Look at my mouth.

324
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,317
Do I look familiar?

325
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:51,844
Do I look like somebody...

326
00:39:51,927 --> 00:39:54,202
you murdered?!

327
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:09,284
<i>By 20, she was one of the top</i>
<i>female assassins in the world.</i>

328
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:56,481
<i>At 25, she did her part</i>
<i>in the killing</i>

329
00:41:56,567 --> 00:42:01,687
<i>of nine innocent people,</i>
<i>including my unborn daughter,</i>

330
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:05,806
<i>in a small wedding chapel</i>
<i>in El Paso, Texas.</i>

331
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:13,157
<i>But on that day four years ago</i>
<i>she made one big mistake.</i>

332
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:15,715
<i>She should have killed 10.</i>

333
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:20,483
<i>However, before satisfaction</i>
<i>would be mine,</i>

334
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,603
<i>first things first.</i>

335
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:25,485
Wiggle your big toe.

336
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,442
Hard part's over.

337
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:38,122
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

338
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,237
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

339
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:15,522
Okinawa.
One-way.

340
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:42,716
Hi.

341
00:43:42,807 --> 00:43:45,162
Welcome...

342
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,204
Welcome.

343
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,759
You English?

344
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:56,042
Almost.
American.

345
00:43:56,127 --> 00:43:58,766
American.
Welcome, American.

346
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,035
Domo.

347
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:03,846
My English very good.

348
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,964
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

349
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:08,002
No, no.

350
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:11,045
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.

351
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:13,482
May I sit at the bar?

352
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,843
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

353
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:22,445
What other words did you learn?

354
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:24,245
Oh, just a minute.

355
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:28,798
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

356
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:32,040
I'm watching my soap operas.

357
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,884
Lazy bastard...

358
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,324
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

359
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:40,558
The tea's hot.
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

360
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:41,966
Shut up!

361
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:44,686
Get your ass out here!

362
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,883
Excuse me.

363
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:51,845
What other Japanese do you know?

364
00:44:51,927 --> 00:44:54,043
Oh, let's see.

365
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:55,037
"Arigato."

366
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:57,482
"Arigato."
Good!

367
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:01,605
I already said "domo," right?

368
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:03,757
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:05,883
"Konn-itch-iwa."

370
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:08,524
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

371
00:45:08,607 --> 00:45:10,199
Konnichi wa.
Please repeat.

372
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:11,436
Konnichi wa.

373
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:14,280
Perfect.
Good, good, good.

374
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,961
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

375
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,446
Now you're making fun of me!

376
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:21,246
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

377
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:24,364
Pronunciation very good.

378
00:45:24,447 --> 00:45:29,646
You say arigato
like we say arigato.

379
00:45:31,407 --> 00:45:35,525
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.

380
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:38,602
You should learn Japanese.

381
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,200
Very easy.

382
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:42,562
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

383
00:45:42,647 --> 00:45:44,683
Most difficult.

384
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:47,839
But you have Japanese tongue.

385
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:51,400
Okay, okay.

386
00:45:53,927 --> 00:45:57,237
Oh, my God.

387
00:45:58,167 --> 00:46:03,924
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?!
Hurry up... goddammit!

388
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:11,397
Lazy oaf...

389
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,798
What d'ya want?

390
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:20,162
I beg your pardon?

391
00:46:21,007 --> 00:46:22,838
Drink.

392
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:26,556
Oh, yes.
A bottle of warm sake, please.

393
00:46:26,647 --> 00:46:28,285
Warm sake?

394
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,164
Very good!

395
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:31,885
One warm sake!

396
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:34,606
Sake? In the middle of the day?

397
00:46:35,567 --> 00:46:39,321
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

398
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:42,205
How come I always have to get the sake?

399
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,720
You listen well...

400
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:47,120
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

401
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:48,879
If this were the military,

402
00:46:48,967 --> 00:46:52,403
I'd be General by now!

403
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:55,160
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

404
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:58,842
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

405
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:01,680
and you'd still get the sake -

406
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:03,803
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake!

407
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,115
Do you understand?

408
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:06,606
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.

409
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:08,518
Do you understand me?

410
00:47:11,487 --> 00:47:13,603
Sorry.

411
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:18,877
First time in Japan?

412
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,367
What brings you to Okinawa?

413
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:24,642
I came to see a man.

414
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:27,161
Oh, yeah.

415
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,920
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

416
00:47:30,007 --> 00:47:31,520
Not quite.

417
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:33,438
Not friend?

418
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:34,642
I never met him.

419
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,319
Never?

420
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:38,443
Who is he?

421
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:40,597
May I ask?

422
00:47:41,247 --> 00:47:43,636
Hattori Hanzo.

423
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:58,604
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

424
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:02,165
I need Japanese steel.

425
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:07,404
Why do you need Japanese steel?

426
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,640
I have vermin to kill.

427
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:20,039
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

428
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,438
Huge.

429
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:49,965
May I?

430
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:52,165
You may.

431
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:56,360
Wait.

432
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:58,836
Try the second one down.

433
00:50:49,607 --> 00:50:51,484
Funny.

434
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:54,798
You like samurai swords.

435
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:59,200
I like baseball.

436
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:09,441
I wanted to show you these.

437
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:10,882
However...

438
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:15,358
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

439
00:51:15,927 --> 00:51:21,240
I no longer make instruments of death.

440
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,925
What I have here...

441
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:30,285
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

442
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:34,796
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

443
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:43,203
...I have retired.

444
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,558
Then give me one of these.

445
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:55,844
These are not for sale.

446
00:51:56,407 --> 00:51:58,682
I didn't say "sell me."

447
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:01,156
I said "give me."

448
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:05,439
Why should I help you?

449
00:52:05,527 --> 00:52:10,760
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

450
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:15,998
And considering the student,

451
00:52:16,087 --> 00:52:20,956
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

452
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:16,645
You can sleep here.

453
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,366
It will take me a month...

454
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:24,006
...to make the sword.

455
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:27,157
I suggest you spend it practicing.

456
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:54,797
I've completed doing...

457
00:54:56,487 --> 00:55:00,196
...what I swore an oath to God, <i>28</i> years ago,

458
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:05,880
to never do again.

459
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:11,045
I have created "something that kills people."

460
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:18,956
And in that purpose, I was a success.

461
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:23,918
I've done this because philosophically,

462
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:30,323
I am sympathetic to your aim.

463
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:38,679
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

464
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:43,084
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

465
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:46,364
God will be cut.

466
00:55:57,847 --> 00:56:00,202
Yellow-haired warrior...

467
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:02,918
Go.

468
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:04,804
Domo.

469
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:28,922
<i>It was one year after</i>
<i>the massacre in El Paso, Texas,</i>

470
00:56:29,007 --> 00:56:30,884
<i>that Bill backed</i>

476

<i>the Crazy 88,</i>

00:57:23,847 --> 00:57:26,077
Do you like Ferraris?

488
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:31,802
Ferrari... Italian trash.

489
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:42,205
Do you want to screw me?

490
00:57:43,887 --> 00:57:47,084
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

491
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,166
Yes.

492
00:57:53,087 --> 00:57:54,645
How 'bout now, big boy?

493
00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:58,326
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

494
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:02,007
...or is it I...

495
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:03,759
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

496
00:58:04,887 --> 00:58:06,843
<i>See what I mean?</i>

497
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:12,525
<i>The bald guy in the black suit</i>
<i>and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,</i>

498
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:16,919
<i>the head general of O-Ren's personal army,</i>
<i>the Crazy 88.</i>

499
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:20,797
<i>And just in case</i>
<i>you were wondering</i>

500
00:58:20,887 --> 00:58:24,766
<i>how could a half-breed</i>
<i>Japanese-Chinese American</i>

501
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:31,082
<i>become the boss of all bosses</i>
<i>in Tokyo, Japan, I'll tell you.</i>

502
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:33,840
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood</i>
<i>and nationality</i>

503
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,441
<i>came up before the council</i>
<i>only once.</i>

504
00:58:36,527 --> 00:58:41,078
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power</i>
<i>over the crime council.</i>

505
00:58:41,527 --> 00:58:43,438
<i>The man who seems bound</i>
<i>and determined</i>

506
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:46,246
<i>to break the mood</i>
<i>is Boss Tanaka.</i>

507
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:49,956
<i>And what Boss Tanaka</i>
<i>thinks</i> is...

508
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:54,440
Boss Tanaka!

509
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:56,486
What's the meaning of this outburst?

510
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:57,920
This is a time for celebration!

511
00:58:58,527 --> 00:59:01,485
And what exactly are we celebrating?

512
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:04,557
The perversion of our illustrious council?

513
00:59:06,407 --> 00:59:09,558
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

514
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:11,000
I will not tolerate this!

515
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:13,203
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

516
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:19,565
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

517
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:26,165
My father...

518
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:29,805
...along with yours, and along with yours,
started this council.

519
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:31,675
And while...

520
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,405
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

521
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,159
...they weep in the afterlife...

522
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,956
- Shut up!

523
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:39,483
...over the perversion committed today!

524
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:42,677
Outrageous!

525
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:45,078
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

526
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:46,361
Bastard!

527
00:59:47,007 --> 00:59:48,486
Fuck face!

528
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:50,446
Gentlemen.

529
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:58,043
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

530
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:03,240
By all means, allow him to express it.

531
01:00:04,207 --> 01:00:08,519
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

532
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:11,205
...which I love...

533
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:13,964
...more than my own children,

534
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:19,038
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

535
01:00:38,767 --> 01:00:45,161
So that you understand how serious I am...

536
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:47,363
...I'm going to say this in English.

537
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:04,396
As your leader, I encourage you
from time to time,

538
01:01:04,487 --> 01:01:08,799
and always in a respectful manner,
to question my logic.

539
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:09,922
If you're unconvinced

540
01:01:10,007 --> 01:01:12,396
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

541
01:01:12,487 --> 01:01:13,476
tell me so.

542
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:15,125
But allow me to convince you.

543
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:17,277
And I promise you,
right here and now,

544
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:20,677
no subject will ever be taboo.

545
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:24,760
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

546
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:27,958
The price you pay

547
01:01:28,047 --> 01:01:30,800
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

548
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:34,641
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

549
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:37,878
Just like this fucker here.

550
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:41,762
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

551
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:46,363
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

552
01:01:48,407 --> 01:01:49,886
I didn't think so.

553
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:55,442
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

554
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:57,599
One ticket to Tokyo, please.

555
01:04:26,727 --> 01:04:27,921
Moshi moshi.

556
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:43,725
Gogo.

557
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,958
Yeah!

558
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:56,203
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

559
01:08:56,287 --> 01:08:57,606
They demand ridiculous things.

560
01:08:57,687 --> 01:08:59,359
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

561
01:08:59,447 --> 01:09:00,880
What's gonna happen?

562
01:09:01,047 --> 01:09:02,480
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

563
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:04,279
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

564
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:05,595
No, I don't want that.

565
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,600
Yes, it's me.

566
01:09:55,927 --> 01:09:59,203
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

567
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:16,606
Who do you remind me of?

568
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:19,445
Charlie Brown!

569
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:22,757
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

570
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:24,316
Charlie Brown.

571
01:10:24,527 --> 01:10:25,880
Four pepperoni pizzas.

572
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:27,361
That's not on our menu...

573
01:10:27,607 --> 01:10:30,075
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

574
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:33,567
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

575
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:36,957
O-Ren Ishii!

576
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:40,918
You and I have unfinished business!

577
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:09,205
Charlie Brown, beat it.

578
01:12:16,567 --> 01:12:17,522
Miki.

579
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:36,400
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

580
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:08,760
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?

581
01:14:10,087 --> 01:14:11,759
Hi!

582
01:14:13,327 --> 01:14:14,726
Gogo, right?

583
01:14:15,847 --> 01:14:17,166
Bingo.

584
01:14:17,247 --> 01:14:19,203
And you're Black Mamba.

585
01:14:20,967 --> 01:14:24,323
Our reputations precede us.

586
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,165
Don't they?

587
01:14:28,527 --> 01:14:34,238
Gogo, I know you feel
you must protect your mistress.

588
01:14:34,327 --> 01:14:36,397
But I beg you.

589
01:14:37,127 --> 01:14:38,924
Walk away.

590
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:46,965
You call that begging?

591
01:14:53,047 --> 01:14:55,561
You can beg better than that.

592
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:03,245
Is that what I think it is?

593
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:05,921
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

594
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:13,038
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

595
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:15,645
Silly rabbit.

596
01:18:15,727 --> 01:18:17,080
Trix are for...

597
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:18,202
Kids.

598
01:24:31,087 --> 01:24:35,478
This is what you get for
fucking around with yakuzas!

599
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:38,240
Go home to your mother!

600
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:36,607
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

601
01:25:36,687 --> 01:25:39,201
...take them with you!

602
01:25:41,007 --> 01:25:42,326
However...

603
01:25:43,567 --> 01:25:47,355
...leave the limbs you've lost.

604
01:25:48,527 --> 01:25:51,405
They belong to me now.

605
01:25:55,887 --> 01:25:59,038
Except you, Sofie!

606
01:25:59,127 --> 01:26:02,836
You stay right where you are.

607
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:56,520
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

608
01:27:00,567 --> 01:27:03,604
Where was it made?

609
01:27:03,687 --> 01:27:05,564
Okinawa.

610
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:10,842
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

611
01:27:10,927 --> 01:27:12,599
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

612
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:14,359
YOU LIE!

613
01:27:25,687 --> 01:27:28,645
Swords, however, never get tired.

614
01:27:30,207 --> 01:27:33,563
I hope you've saved your energy.

615
01:27:36,927 --> 01:27:38,246
If you haven't...

616
01:27:40,287 --> 01:27:42,437
...you might not last five minutes.

617
01:27:44,167 --> 01:27:46,123
But as last looks go,

618
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:49,881
you could do worse.

619
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:25,723
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

620
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:31,124
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

621
01:30:33,807 --> 01:30:36,719
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

622
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,799
Attack me...

623
01:31:08,527 --> 01:31:09,960
...with everything you have.

624
01:32:02,327 --> 01:32:05,444
For ridiculing you earlier...

625
01:32:08,007 --> 01:32:09,918
...I apologize.

626
01:32:17,887 --> 01:32:19,639
Accepted.

627
01:32:35,287 --> 01:32:36,481
Ready?

628
01:32:41,007 --> 01:32:42,156
Come on.

629
01:33:13,887 --> 01:33:22,477
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

630
01:35:27,367 --> 01:35:29,244
My Sofie.

631
01:35:29,327 --> 01:35:31,557
I'm so sorry.

632
01:35:34,527 --> 01:35:37,883
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

633
01:35:37,967 --> 01:35:39,764
No more of that.

634
01:35:39,847 --> 01:35:41,565
But still...

635
01:35:41,647 --> 01:35:44,480
But still nothing.

636
01:35:45,687 --> 01:35:48,884
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

637
01:35:48,967 --> 01:35:52,323
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

638
01:35:52,807 --> 01:35:55,560
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

639
01:35:55,647 --> 01:35:58,605
The first reason is information.

640
01:35:58,687 --> 01:36:01,367
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

641
01:36:01,367 --> 01:36:03,039
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

642
01:36:04,327 --> 01:36:08,445
But I am gonna ask you questions.

643
01:36:08,527 --> 01:36:12,281
And every time
you don't give me answers,

644
01:36:12,367 --> 01:36:15,325
I'm gonna cut something off.

645
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:21,319
And I promise you,
they will be things you will miss!

646
01:36:21,407 --> 01:36:23,875
Give me your other arm!

647
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:30,957
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

648
01:36:31,047 --> 01:36:32,196
If you had to guess...

649
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,197
What they've been doing.

650
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:34,402
Why she left you alive...

651
01:36:34,487 --> 01:36:36,284
And where I can find them.

652
01:36:36,367 --> 01:36:38,642
What would be your guess?

653
01:36:40,207 --> 01:36:42,880
Guessing won't be necessary.

654
01:36:42,967 --> 01:36:45,117
She informed me.

655
01:36:46,607 --> 01:36:51,078
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

656
01:36:51,767 --> 01:36:52,961
As I said before,

657
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:57,598
I've allowed you to keep your wicked life
for two reasons.

658
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:02,761
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

659
01:37:02,847 --> 01:37:05,759
everything that happened
here tonight.

660
01:37:06,447 --> 01:37:09,803
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

661
01:37:09,887 --> 01:37:13,038
by witnessing
your deformed body.

662
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:17,279
I want you to tell him all
the information you just told me.

663
01:37:17,367 --> 01:37:20,165
I want him to know what I know.

664
01:37:20,247 --> 01:37:24,365
I want him to know
I want him to know.

665
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:26,597
And I want them all to know

666
01:37:26,687 --> 01:37:32,683
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

667
01:37:55,807 --> 01:38:00,358
Revenge is never a straight line.

668
01:38:03,207 --> 01:38:05,084
It's a forest.

669
01:38:05,967 --> 01:38:08,845
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

670
01:38:10,047 --> 01:38:13,039
to get lost... to forget where you came in.

671
01:38:16,167 --> 01:38:20,479
That woman deserves her revenge.

672
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:29,205
And we deserve to die.

673
01:38:32,287 --> 01:38:36,200
She must suffer
to her last breath.

674
01:38:48,527 --> 01:38:50,677
How did you find me?

675
01:38:51,487 --> 01:38:53,318
I'm the man.

676
01:38:56,807 --> 01:38:59,401
One more thing, Sofie.

677
01:39:00,207 --> 01:39:04,917
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?



0
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
