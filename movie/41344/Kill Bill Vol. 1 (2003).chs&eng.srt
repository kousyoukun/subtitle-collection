Okinawa.

01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,130

Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

715
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,470

This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

YOU LIE!

717
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:08,929
Mm-hmm.

I hope you've saved your energy.

If you haven't...

But as last looks go,

Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords.

You may not be able to fight like a samurai.

But you can at least die like a samurai.

Attack me...

Come on.

I've kept you alive for two reasons.

The first reason is information.

But I am gonna ask you questions.

And every time you don't give me answers,

751
01:40:19,762 --> 01:40:22,232

I'm gonna cut something off.

What they've been doing.

And where I can find them.

01:40:44,838 --> 01:40:47,632
what would be your guess?

761
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,680
�Ҳ���Ҫ��
Guessing won't be necessary.

762
01:40:51,391 --> 01:40:53,081

She informed me.

763

She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons.

I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons.

766
01:41:06,571 --> 01:41:08,841

And the second reason is so you can tell him, in person,

Revenge is never a straight line.

It's a forest.
