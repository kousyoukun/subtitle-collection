2
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:24,982
Do you find me sadistic?

3
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:38,396
You know, I bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

4
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,704
If I wanted to.

5
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,202
You know, kiddo...

6
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:52,613
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

7
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:58,991
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

8
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:04,828
We, maybe towards
those other jokers.

9
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,368
But not you.

10
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,100
No, kiddo.

11
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,109
At this moment...

12
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:23,842
This is me at my most
masochistic.

13
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,912
Bill, it's your baby.

14
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,752
Coming!

15
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,448
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

16
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:53,343
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

17
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:56,220
Got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

18
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,960
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

19
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,102
Come on.
Bring it on.

20
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,908
Mommy, I'm home.

21
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:54,505
Hey, baby.

22
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,483
How was school?

23
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,514
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

24
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,524
Oh.

25
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:06,083
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

26
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,527
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

27
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:11,293
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

28
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,527
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

29
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:17,971
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

30
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:27,044
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

31
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,083
Hi, honey.

32
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm ****

33
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,112
What's your name?

34
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,885
Her name is Nikki.

35
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,551
Nikki.

36
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,262
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

37
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,727
How old are you, Nikki?

38
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:54,074
Nikki, **** asked you
a question.

39
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,201
I'm 4.

40
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:58,473
4 years old, eh?

41
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:03,550
You know,
I had a little girl once.

42
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,846
She'd be about 4 now.

43
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,659
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

44
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,025
to talk about.

45
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,188
You can go in your room.

46
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,199
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

47
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,700
Okay?

48
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:24,205
Nikkia!

49
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,070
In your room.
Now.

50
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,885
You want some coffee?

51
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,118
Yeah. Sure.

52
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,895
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name</i>

53
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,060
<i>Is Jeanne Bell.</i>

54
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,729
<i>Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

55
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,569
<i>But back when we were
acquainted, Four years ago,</i>

56
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,734
<i>her nanne was Vernita Green.</i>

57
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,404
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.</i>

58
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,276
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

59
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:07,906
Do you have a towel?

60
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,741
Yeah.

61
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,217
Thanks.

62
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,349
You still take cream and sugar?

63
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:18,392
Yeah.

64
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,226
So suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

65
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:26,665
You suppose correctly.

66
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:28,930
Look, bitch, I need to know

67
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,768
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

68
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,865
You can relax for now.

69
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,703
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

70
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,375
That's being more rational

71
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,781
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

72
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:48,221
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

73
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,258
Not rationality.

74
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,329
Look.

75
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:59,890
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

76
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:02,459
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

77
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:05,496
You have every right
to want to get even.

78
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:08,065
No, no, no, no, no.

79
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:09,201
No.

80
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:13,077
To get even, even Stephen,

81
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:19,576
would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

82
00:11:19,654 --> 00:11:24,421
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

83
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:26,858
That would be even, Vernita.

84
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:29,055
That'd be about square.

85
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,190
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

86
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,928
But I can't.

87
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,139
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

88
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:42,165
Oh, great.
I don't care.

89
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,108
Be that as it may,

90
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,205
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

91
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:51,912
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

92
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:55,753
Bitch, you can stop right there.

93
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:58,391
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

94
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,791
before the eyes of your daughter

95
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,421
does not mean that parading her
around in front of me

96
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:05,557
is gonna inspire sympathy.

97
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,603
You and I have
unfinished business.

98
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,831
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

99
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:12,395
in the subsequent four years,

100
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:16,672
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

101
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:20,171
So when do we do this?

102
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:22,409
It all depends.

103
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:25,078
When do you want to die?

104
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:28,020
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

105
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:29,351
How about tonight, bitch?

106
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:31,756
Splendid.
Where?

107
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:34,090
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach our little league

108
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:36,096
about a mile from here.

109
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:38,155
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

110
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:42,260
dressed all in black,
your hair in a back stocking.

111
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:45,170
And we have us a knife fight.

112
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,265
We won't be bothered.

113
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:52,245
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

114
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,153
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

115
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,657
with an edged weapon.

116
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:06,887
Fuck you, bitch.

117
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:09,327
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

118
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:13,197
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

119
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,163
Black Mamba.

120
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,933
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

121
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:19,996
Weapon of choice?

122
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,805
If you want to stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

123
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:27,013
Very funny, bitch.

124
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:28,845
Very funny!

125
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,501
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

126
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:33,804
For that, I'm sorry.

127
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,380
But you can take my word for it.

128
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,946
Your mother had it coming.

129
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:04,135
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

130
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,712
I'll be waiting.

131
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:16,450
For those regarded as warriors...

132
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:19,189
When engaged in combat...

133
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,354
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

134
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:31,931
Suppress a human emotion and compassion...

135
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:43,541
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

136
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:55,558
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

137
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,619
Come on out to Dallas.

138
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,387
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

139
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,725
And next, we got some record.

140
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:31,560
Very own wildman,
Charlie Feathers.

141
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:12,205
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

142
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:14,639
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

143
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:19,872
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

144
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,483
Give me a figure.

145
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,542
Nine dead bodies.

146
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,214
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

147
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,224
Bride. Groom.

148
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,987
Reverend.

149
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:35,723
Reverend's wife.

150
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:39,824
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

151
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:42,165
It would appear
somebody objected to this

152
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:44,568
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

153
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:53,045
Good gravy, Marie.

154
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:00,015
What'd I tell you, Pop?

155
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:03,353
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

156
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:06,188
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

157
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,784
You're in a house of worship.

158
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:09,295
Sorry, Pop.

159
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:14,096
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

160
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:19,037
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

161
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:21,701
Four, maybe five strong.

162
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,801
How can you tell?

163
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:26,870
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

164
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:30,715
This ain't no
squirrey amateur.

165
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:34,312
This is the work of a salty dog.

166
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:37,119
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

167
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:40,490
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

168
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,826
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

169
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:47,834
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

170
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,840
Who's the bride?

171
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,406
I don't know.

172
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:05,008
The name
on the marriage certificate

173
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:08,112
is Arlene Machiavelli.

174
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,020
That's a fake.

175
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:11,786
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

176
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,349
on account of the dress.

177
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,192
You can tell she was pregnant.

178
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:17,856
Man would have to be a mad dog

179
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:21,834
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

180
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:25,428
Look at her.

181
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:32,712
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

182
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,510
She's a little
blood-splattered angel.

183
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,881
Son Number One?

184
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:42,217
Yeah?

185
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,818
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

186
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,549
I might never have liked you.

187
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:28,746
Point in fact, I despise you.

188
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:34,355
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

189
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:40,592
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

190
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:43,933
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

191
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:47,736
My gift to you.

192
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:55,782
For fuck's sake.

193
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:00,547
Hello, Bill.

194
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:04,253
What's her condition?

195
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,520
Comatose.

196
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,819
Where is she?

197
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:12,161
I'm standing over her right now.

198
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,326
That's my girl.

199
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,804
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

200
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,000
What?

201
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:22,599
We owe her better than that.

202
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:24,440
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

203
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:26,173
Will you keep your voice down?

204
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,112
You don't owe her shit!

205
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:30,275
May I say one thing?

206
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:32,182
Speak.

207
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,284
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

208
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:37,290
But you didn't kill her.

209
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:39,189
And I put a bullet in her head.

210
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,593
But her heart
just kept on beating.

211
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:44,096
Now, you saw that yourself

212
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:49,068
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

213
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:53,565
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

214
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:59,102
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

215
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,114
But one thing we won't do

216
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:05,551
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

217
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:09,555
and kill her in her sleep.

218
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:12,251
And the reason
we won't do that thing

219
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:17,559
is because that thing
would lower us.

220
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,656
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

221
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,932
I guess.

222
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,494
Do you really have to guess?

223
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:27,564
No.

224
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:31,577
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

225
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:35,111
Come on home, honey.

226
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:38,475
Affirmative.

227
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:41,915
I love you very much.

228
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:44,150
I love you, too.

229
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,485
Bye-bye.

230
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:02,299
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

231
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,866
Hmm?

232
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:08,540
Word of advice, shithead.

233
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:11,642
Don't you ever wake up.

234
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:53,223
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

235
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:56,388
Bill, it's your baby.

236
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:01,724
Oh, my baby.

237
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:31,348
Four years.

238
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:03,515
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

239
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:05,115
You getting your freak on
or what?

240
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:07,319
Oh, yeah, boy.

241
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,659
20, 40, 60, 75.

242
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,702
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

243
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,396
Rule number one.

244
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:18,529
No punching her.

245
00:28:18,606 --> 00:28:20,369
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

246
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:22,204
or less some teeth, jig's up.

247
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:24,767
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

248
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:26,608
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

249
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,207
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

250
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:33,253
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

251
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,551
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

252
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:39,320
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

253
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:42,590
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

254
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,757
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

255
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:46,322
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

256
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,992
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

257
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:49,660
I'll Be back in 20.

258
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,565
Yeah.

259
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,574
Oh, shit.

260
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:57,202
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

261
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,768
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

262
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:03,248
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

263
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,378
<i>Bon appetit, good buddy.</i>

264
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:18,865
Oh, yeah.

265
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,299
Oh, God damn.

266
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:24,929
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

267
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:46,957
Oh.

268
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,487
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

269
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:17,319
Coming in, ready or not.

270
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:20,053
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

271
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,885
Whoa.

272
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:42,875
Aaaah!

273
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:54,151
Where's Bill?

274
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:56,855
Where's Bill?

275
00:30:58,132 --> 00:30:59,326
Please stop hitting me.

276
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,525
Where's Bill?

277
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:03,692
I don't know who Bill is!

278
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:05,238
Bullshit!

279
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:16,844
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

280
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:20,250
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

281
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,049
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

282
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:26,422
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

283
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:32,192
Your name is Buck.

284
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,097
Right?

285
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:37,262
And you came here to fuck.

286
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:38,497
Right?

287
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:40,164
Wait a minute.
Wait.

288
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,057
"Pussy Wagon. "

289
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,069
You fucker.

290
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:40,223
Texas. Okay.

291
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:28,601
Wiggle your big toe.

292
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:35,211
Wiggle your big toe.

293
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:45,747
Wiggle your big toe.

294
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,526
Wiggle your big toe.

295
00:34:58,338 --> 00:35:00,033
Wiggle your big toe.

296
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:02,507
<i>As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,</i>

297
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:05,101
<i>trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...</i>

298
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:06,805
Wiggle your big toe.

299
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,941
<i>...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.</i>

300
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:13,919
<i>And the dicks responsible.</i>

301
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:21,024
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.</i>

302
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,624
<i>When fortune smiles
on something</i>

303
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:27,166
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge,</i>

304
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:31,227
<i>It seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,</i>

305
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,329
<i>you're doing his will.</i>

306
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,001
<i>At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,</i>

307
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:38,067
<i>the first name
on my death list,</i>

308
00:35:38,145 --> 00:35:42,081
<i>O- Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.</i>

309
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:44,583
<i>But when one
manages the difficult task</i>

310
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:47,347
<i>of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,</i>

311
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:50,652
<i>one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?</i>

312
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,365
<i>O- Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base</i>

313
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:09,807
<i>In Tokyo, Japan.</i>

314
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,334
<i>The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat</i>

315
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:16,974
<i>made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.</i>

316
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,881
<i>It was at that age
she witnessed</i>

317
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:20,749
<i>the death of her parents
at the hands</i>

318
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:26,657
<i>of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.</i>

319
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:55,020
Hyah!

320
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,919
Hmm.

321
00:38:43,964 --> 00:38:45,329
Hmm.

322
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,125
Oh.

323
00:39:41,888 --> 00:39:43,048
Mommy.

324
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:55,160
<i>She swore revenge.</i>

325
00:40:55,228 --> 00:41:00,393
<i>Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.</i>

326
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:06,432
<i>At 11, she got her revenge.</i>

327
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:13,108
Look at me, Matsumoto...

328
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:17,875
...take a good look at my face.

329
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:21,844
Look at my eyes.

330
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,053
Look at my mouth.

331
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:30,062
Do I look familiar?

332
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,458
Do I look like somebody...

333
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,695
you murdered?!

334
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:54,446
<i>By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.</i>

335
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,623
<i>At 25, she did her part
in the killing</i>

336
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:49,862
<i>of nine innocent people,
Including my unborn daughter,</i>

337
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:54,270
<i>In a small wedding chapel
In El Paso, Texas.</i>

338
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:02,042
<i>But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.</i>

339
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:04,640
<i>She should have killed 10.</i>

340
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:09,721
<i>However, before satisfaction
would be mine,</i>

341
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:11,814
<i>first things first.</i>

342
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:14,826
Wiggle your big toe.

343
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:24,168
Hard part's over.

344
00:44:24,237 --> 00:44:28,003
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

345
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,635
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

346
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:07,009
Okinawa.
One-way.

347
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,505
Hi.

348
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:37,475
Welcome...

349
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:44,081
Welcome.

350
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:46,885
You English?

351
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,251
Almost.
American.

352
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:53,088
American.
Welcome, American.

353
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:54,456
<i>Domo.</i>

354
00:45:54,527 --> 00:45:57,360
My English very good.

355
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:00,695
<i>You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?</i>

356
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:01,699
No, no.

357
00:46:01,768 --> 00:46:04,703
Just a few words learned
since yesterday.

358
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,331
Um, may I sit at the bar?

359
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:10,774
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

360
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:13,806
Oh.

361
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,713
What other words did you learn?

362
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:18,876
Oh, just a minute.

363
00:46:18,951 --> 00:46:23,251
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

364
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:26,492
I'm watching my soap operas.

365
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:29,618
Lazy bastard...

366
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,055
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

367
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:33,826
The tea's hot.

368
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,629
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

369
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:37,067
Shut up!

370
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:40,071
Get your ass out here!

371
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:42,107
Uh, excuse me.

372
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:47,578
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

373
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:48,579
Oh, let's see.

374
00:46:48,648 --> 00:46:50,775
<i>Um, "arigato."</i>

375
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,318
<i>"Arigato."
Good!</i>

376
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:57,516
<i>Um, already said "donno,"
right?</i>

377
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:00,024
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:47:00,093 --> 00:47:01,151
"Konn-itch-iwa."

379
00:47:01,227 --> 00:47:02,956
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

380
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,792
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

381
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,525
<i>Konnichi wa.
Pease repeat.</i>

382
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:07,759
<i>Konnichi wa.</i>

383
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:08,858
Perfect.

384
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:10,960
Good, good, good.

385
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,562
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

386
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:15,129
Oh, you're making fun of me!

387
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,200
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

388
00:47:18,277 --> 00:47:21,405
Pronounciation very good.

389
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:26,077
<i>You say arigato
like we say arigato.</i>

390
00:47:28,788 --> 00:47:32,315
<i>Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.</i>

391
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,790
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,385
You should learn Japanese.

393
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:38,396
Very easy.

394
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:40,432
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

395
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,661
Most difficult.

396
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,636
But you have Japanese tongue.

397
00:47:47,974 --> 00:47:49,532
Okay, okay.

398
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:56,479
Oh.
Oh, my God.

399
00:47:56,549 --> 00:48:02,385
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?
Hurry up... goddammit!

400
00:48:05,691 --> 00:48:10,424
Lazy oaf...

401
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:17,026
What d'ya want?

402
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,028
Beg your pardon?

403
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,370
Uh, drink.

404
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,703
Oh, yes.

405
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:26,210
A bottle of warm sake, please.

406
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:27,871
Warm sake?

407
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,040
Very good!

408
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,583
One warm sake!

409
00:48:31,651 --> 00:48:34,814
Sake? In the middle of the day?

410
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:39,588
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

411
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:42,560
How come I always have to get the sake?

412
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,720
You listen we...

413
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,529
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

414
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,397
If this were the military,

415
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:53,199
I'd be General by now.

416
00:48:53,272 --> 00:48:56,036
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

417
00:48:56,108 --> 00:49:00,010
If you were General, I'd be emperor,

418
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,513
and you'd still get the sake -

419
00:49:02,582 --> 00:49:04,777
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

420
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:05,909
Do you understand?

421
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,919
I'm not bad, okay? I shaved my head.

422
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,955
Do you understand me?

423
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:14,886
Sorry.

424
00:49:17,263 --> 00:49:20,130
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

425
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:21,632
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

426
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:24,898
What brings you to Okinawa?

427
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:26,768
Came to see a man.

428
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,535
Oh, yeah.

429
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:32,373
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

430
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:34,037
Not quite.

431
00:49:34,113 --> 00:49:35,978
Not friend?

432
00:49:36,048 --> 00:49:37,447
Never met him.

433
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,484
Never?

434
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:41,315
Who is he?

435
00:49:41,387 --> 00:49:43,082
May I ask?

436
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:46,987
Hattori Hanzo.

437
00:49:58,905 --> 00:50:01,669
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

438
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:05,705
I need Japanese steel.

439
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:10,882
Why do you need Japanese steel?

440
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:15,378
I have vermin to kill.

441
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:24,526
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

442
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:28,990
Huge.

443
00:51:56,689 --> 00:51:58,782
May I?

444
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:00,587
You may.

445
00:52:03,462 --> 00:52:04,952
Wait.

446
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:07,556
Try the second one down.

447
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:02,544
Funny.

448
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:04,987
You like samurai swords.

449
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:10,489
I like baseball.

450
00:53:18,437 --> 00:53:20,962
I wanted to show you these.

451
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:23,036
However...

452
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,475
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

453
00:53:28,214 --> 00:53:33,015
...I no longer make instruments of death.

454
00:53:34,386 --> 00:53:35,944
What I have here...

455
00:53:37,022 --> 00:53:42,517
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

456
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:47,694
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

457
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:56,070
...I have retired.

458
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,209
Then give me one of these.

459
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,617
These are not for sale.

460
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:12,489
I didn't say "sell me."

461
00:54:12,558 --> 00:54:14,185
I said "give me."

462
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:19,556
Why should I help you?

463
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:24,831
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

464
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,575
And considering the student,

465
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:35,740
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

466
00:55:32,238 --> 00:55:33,933
You can sleep here.

467
00:55:34,907 --> 00:55:37,102
It will take me a month...

468
00:55:39,778 --> 00:55:41,177
...to make the sword.

469
00:55:42,581 --> 00:55:45,311
I suggest you spend it practicing.

470
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:15,673
I've completed doing...

471
00:57:17,676 --> 00:57:21,339
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

472
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:27,345
...to never do again.

473
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:33,957
I have created "something that kills people."

474
00:57:35,694 --> 00:57:41,428
And in that purpose, was a success.

475
00:57:44,536 --> 00:57:46,595
I've done this because philosophically,

476
00:57:47,406 --> 00:57:53,367
I am sympathetic to your aim.

477
00:57:56,115 --> 00:58:02,054
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

478
00:58:03,222 --> 00:58:06,680
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

479
00:58:06,759 --> 00:58:09,922
...God will be cut.

480
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:24,738
Yellow-haired warrior...

481
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,205
Go.

482
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:28,837
<i>Domo.</i>

483
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:54,168
<i>It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,</i>

484
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,207
<i>that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny</i>

485

490
00:59:08,787 --> 00:59:11,950
<i>It was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...</i>

491
00:59:13,158 --> 00:59:16,958
<i>...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.</i>

492
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,031
<i>The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,</i>

493
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,795
<i>who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"</i>

494
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:27,805
<i>is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.</i>

495
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:32,037
<i>The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.</i>

496
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,341
<i>Another former protégée
of Bill's.</i>

497
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,978
<i>The young girl
in the school-girl uniform</i>

498
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:45,547
<i>is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.</i>

499
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,855
<i>Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,</i>

500
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:51,657
<i>she makes up for in madness.</i>

501
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,425
Do you like Ferraris?

502
00:59:57,503 --> 00:59:59,494
Ferrari... italian trash.

503
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:10,543
Do you want to screw me?

504
01:00:12,284 --> 01:00:15,776
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

505
01:00:17,222 --> 01:00:18,189
Yes.

506
01:00:22,361 --> 01:00:23,623
How 'bout now, big boy?

507
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:27,422
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

508
01:00:29,902 --> 01:00:30,934
...or is it I...

509
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:33,267
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

510
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,398
<i>See what I mean?</i>

511
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:42,371
<i>The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,</i>

512
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:46,907
<i>the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.</i>

513
01:00:48,787 --> 01:00:51,017
<i>And just in case
you were wondering</i>

514
01:00:51,089 --> 01:00:55,048
<i>how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American</i>

515
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:59,962
<i>become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan,</i>

516
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,556
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

517
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:04,397
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality</i>

518
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:07,165
<i>came up before the council
only once.</i>

519
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:12,336
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.</i>

520
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:14,504
<i>The man who seems bound
and determined</i>

521
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,413
<i>to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.</i>

522
01:01:17,482 --> 01:01:20,918
<i>And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...</i>

523
01:01:24,823 --> 01:01:25,812
Boss Tanaka!

524
01:01:26,425 --> 01:01:27,619
What's the meaning of this outburst?

525
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:29,524
This is a time for celebration!

526
01:01:30,095 --> 01:01:32,893
And what exactly are we celebrating?

527
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:36,799
The perversion of our illustrious council?

528
01:01:38,804 --> 01:01:41,796
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

529
01:01:41,873 --> 01:01:43,135
I will not tolerate this!

530
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,369
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

531
01:01:46,545 --> 01:01:51,812
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

532
01:01:57,723 --> 01:01:59,122
My father...

533
01:01:59,825 --> 01:02:00,883
...along with yours,

534
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,449
and along with yours,
started this council.

535
01:02:03,662 --> 01:02:05,095
And while...

536
01:02:05,163 --> 01:02:06,653
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

537
01:02:06,732 --> 01:02:08,393
...they weep in the afterlife...

538
01:02:09,034 --> 01:02:09,966
- Shut up!

539
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:12,733
...over the perversion committed today!

540
01:02:13,505 --> 01:02:16,030
Outrageous!

541
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:18,903
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

542
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:19,966
Bastard!

543
01:02:21,013 --> 01:02:22,207
Fuck face!

544
01:02:22,648 --> 01:02:24,377
Gentlemen.

545
01:02:26,418 --> 01:02:32,015
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

546
01:02:33,558 --> 01:02:37,585
By all means, allow him to express it.

547
01:02:38,664 --> 01:02:43,226
Speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

548
01:02:44,836 --> 01:02:46,201
...which I love...

549
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,506
...more than my own children,

550
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:54,375
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

551
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:03,787
Aah! Aah!

552
01:03:14,733 --> 01:03:21,468
So that you understand how serious I am...

553
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,735
...I'm going to say this in English.

554
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:24,774
Huh!

555
01:03:37,622 --> 01:03:39,954
As your leader...

556
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:41,515
I encourage you
from time to time,

557
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:46,257
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

558
01:03:46,331 --> 01:03:47,263
If you're unconvinced

559
01:03:47,332 --> 01:03:49,766
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

560
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:51,029
tell me so.

561
01:03:51,103 --> 01:03:52,661
But allow me to convince you.

562
01:03:52,738 --> 01:03:54,865
And promise you,
right here and now,

563
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,501
no subject will ever be taboo.

564
01:03:58,577 --> 01:04:01,842
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

565
01:04:04,015 --> 01:04:06,040
The price you pay

566
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:09,019
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

567
01:04:09,087 --> 01:04:13,046
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

568
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:15,525
Just like this fucker here.

569
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,490
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

570
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:25,298
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

571
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,963
Didn't think so.

572
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:35,177
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

573
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:37,738
One ticket to Tokyo please.

574
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:13,732
<i>Moshi moshi.</i>

575
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:50,832
Hey!

576
01:08:53,138 --> 01:08:54,503
- Hey, yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

577
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,838
Gogo.

578
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,566
Yeah! Whoo!

579
01:11:49,948 --> 01:11:52,974
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

580
01:11:53,051 --> 01:11:54,746
They demand ridiculous things.

581
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:57,083
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

582
01:11:57,155 --> 01:11:57,985
What's gonna happen?

583
01:11:58,122 --> 01:11:59,521
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

584
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,454
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

585
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:02,389
No, I don't want that.

586
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:51,667
Yes, it's me.

587
01:12:55,947 --> 01:12:59,246
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

588
01:13:14,866 --> 01:13:17,391
Who do you remind me of?

589
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:20,127
Charlie Brown!

590
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:24,108
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

591
01:13:24,143 --> 01:13:25,097
Charlie Brown.

592
01:13:25,376 --> 01:13:26,866
Four pepperoni pizzas.

593
01:13:27,211 --> 01:13:28,439
That's not on our menu...

594
01:13:28,646 --> 01:13:30,841
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

595
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,710
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

596
01:13:36,387 --> 01:13:38,218
O- Ren Ishii!

597
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:42,949
You and I have unfinished business!

598
01:15:12,016 --> 01:15:14,541
Charlie Brown, beat it.

599
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:23,087
Miki.

600
01:15:41,946 --> 01:15:43,379
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

601
01:17:13,871 --> 01:17:19,400
So, O-Ren, anymore subordinates
for me to kill?

602
01:17:20,945 --> 01:17:22,344
Hi!

603
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:24,947
Gogo, right?

604
01:17:26,751 --> 01:17:28,446
Bingo.

605
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,350
And you're Black Mamba.

606
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,450
Our reputations precede us.

607
01:17:36,794 --> 01:17:38,125
Don't they?

608
01:17:39,897 --> 01:17:45,164
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

609
01:17:46,304 --> 01:17:48,898
But I beg you.

610
01:17:48,973 --> 01:17:50,600
Walk away.

611
01:17:57,682 --> 01:17:59,343
You call that begging?

612
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,214
You can beg better than that.

613
01:20:07,978 --> 01:20:09,138
Aah!

614
01:20:15,152 --> 01:20:15,743
Aah!

615
01:20:18,089 --> 01:20:18,817
Aah!

616
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:23,880
Is that what I think it is?

617
01:21:23,954 --> 01:21:26,684
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

618
01:21:27,324 --> 01:21:34,093
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

619
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:36,828
Silly rabbit.

620
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,331
Trix are for...

621
01:21:38,402 --> 01:21:39,494
Kids.

622
01:21:43,507 --> 01:21:44,997
Hyaaaaaaah!

623
01:22:54,745 --> 01:22:55,803
Hyah!

624
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,256
Aaaaaaaaahh!

625
01:23:29,446 --> 01:23:30,538
Aaahh!

626
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,081
Aaaaahhh!

627
01:25:53,657 --> 01:25:54,589
Aaah!

628
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:12,991
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

629
01:28:13,063 --> 01:28:14,826
Go home to your mother!

630
01:29:13,924 --> 01:29:16,688
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

631
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,024
...take them with you!

632
01:29:21,131 --> 01:29:22,359
However...

633
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:27,693
...leave the limbs you've lost.

634
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:32,272
They belong to me now.

635
01:29:36,713 --> 01:29:39,580
Except you, Sofie!

636
01:29:40,284 --> 01:29:43,583
You stay right where you are.

637
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,431
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

638
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:45,774
Where was it made?

639
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:49,178
Okinawa.

640
01:30:51,054 --> 01:30:53,955
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

641
01:30:55,192 --> 01:30:57,126
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

642
01:30:57,194 --> 01:30:58,491
YOU LIE!

643
01:31:06,803 --> 01:31:08,327
Mmm-hmm.

644
01:31:11,408 --> 01:31:13,706
Swords however, never get tired.

645
01:31:15,045 --> 01:31:18,503
Hope you've saved your energy.

646
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:23,379
If you haven't...

647
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:27,513
...you might not last five minutes.

648
01:31:29,559 --> 01:31:31,754
But as last looks go,

649
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,589
you could do worse.

650
01:34:13,557 --> 01:34:18,085
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

651
01:34:20,463 --> 01:34:23,364
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

652
01:34:26,403 --> 01:34:29,531
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

653
01:34:59,936 --> 01:35:01,403
Attack me...

654
01:35:02,706 --> 01:35:04,264
...with everything you have.

655
01:35:59,529 --> 01:36:02,327
For ridiculing you earlier...

656
01:36:04,868 --> 01:36:06,802
...I apologize.

657
01:36:15,378 --> 01:36:16,538
Accepted.

658
01:36:33,163 --> 01:36:34,061
Ready?

659
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:40,329
Come on.

660
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:22,444
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

661
01:39:28,605 --> 01:39:30,072
Sofie.

662
01:39:30,773 --> 01:39:32,638
Sofie.

663
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:34,540
My Sofie.

664
01:39:34,611 --> 01:39:36,772
I'm so sorry.

665
01:39:40,116 --> 01:39:43,643
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

666
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,654
No more of that.

667
01:39:45,722 --> 01:39:47,485
But still...

668
01:39:47,557 --> 01:39:50,185
But still nothing.

669
01:39:51,728 --> 01:39:54,993
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

670
01:39:55,064 --> 01:39:58,465
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

671
01:39:59,235 --> 01:40:02,068
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

672
01:40:02,138 --> 01:40:05,206
The first reason is information.

673
01:40:05,241 --> 01:40:08,076
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

674
01:40:08,111 --> 01:40:09,874
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

675
01:40:11,147 --> 01:40:15,413
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

676
01:40:15,485 --> 01:40:19,581
And every time
you don't give me answers,

677
01:40:19,656 --> 01:40:22,250
I'm gonna cut something off.

678
01:40:22,992 --> 01:40:28,862
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

679
01:40:29,499 --> 01:40:31,296
Give me your other arm!

680
01:40:34,337 --> 01:40:39,036
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

681
01:40:39,108 --> 01:40:40,268
If you had to guess...

682
01:40:40,343 --> 01:40:41,275
What they've been doing.

683
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,538
Why she left you alive...

684
01:40:42,612 --> 01:40:44,546
And where I can find them.

685
01:40:44,614 --> 01:40:46,514
What would be your guess?

686
01:40:48,518 --> 01:40:51,453
Guessing won't be necessary.

687
01:40:51,521 --> 01:40:53,386
She informed me.

688
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:59,652
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

689
01:41:00,463 --> 01:41:01,862
As I said before,

690
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:06,561
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

691
01:41:06,636 --> 01:41:12,074
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

692
01:41:12,141 --> 01:41:15,907
everything that happened
here tonight.

693
01:41:15,979 --> 01:41:19,244
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

694
01:41:19,315 --> 01:41:22,910
by witnessing
your deformed body.

695
01:41:22,986 --> 01:41:27,252
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

696
01:41:27,323 --> 01:41:30,349
I want him to know what I know.

697
01:41:30,426 --> 01:41:34,157
I want him to know
I want him to know.

698
01:41:34,664 --> 01:41:37,098
And I want them all to know

699
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:43,127
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

700
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:11,824
Revenge is never a straight line.

701
01:42:15,104 --> 01:42:16,799
It's a forest.

702
01:42:18,107 --> 01:42:21,008
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

703
01:42:22,145 --> 01:42:25,171
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

704
01:42:28,651 --> 01:42:32,951
That woman deserves her revenge.

705
01:42:37,827 --> 01:42:42,196
And we deserve to die.

706
01:42:45,601 --> 01:42:49,503
She must suffer
to her last breath.

707
01:43:02,285 --> 01:43:05,220
How did you find me?

708
01:43:05,288 --> 01:43:06,949
I'm the man.

709
01:43:11,127 --> 01:43:14,563
One more thing, Sofie.

710
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:18,726
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
