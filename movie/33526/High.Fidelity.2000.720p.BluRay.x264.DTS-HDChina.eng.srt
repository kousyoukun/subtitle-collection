1
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:17,578
Oh, yeah

2
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:19,464
Oh

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,715
You're gonna wake up one mornin'

4
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:27,211
As the sun greets the dawn

5
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,471
You're gonna wake up one mornin'

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,477
As the sun greets the dawn

7
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:37,682
You didn't realize

8
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:40,940
You didn't realize

9
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:44,110
You didn't realize

10
00:00:44,196 --> 00:00:47,232
You didn't realize

11
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:50,526
You didn't realize

12
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,784
Oh, you're gonna miss me, baby

13
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:57,453
Oh, you're gonna miss me, baby

14
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,458
- Oh, you're gonna miss me, baby
- What came first?

15
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:03,248
The music or the misery?

16
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:07,085
People worry about kids playing with
guns, or watching violent videos...

17
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:10,128
that some sort of culture of violence
will take them over.

18
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:12,341
Nobody worries about kids
listening to thousands...

19
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:17,220
literally, thousands of songs
about heartbreak, rejection...

20
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:20,807
pain, misery and loss.

21
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:24,097
Did I listen to pop music
because I was miserable...

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,226
or was I miserable
because I listened to pop music?

23
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:31,269
You're gonna wake up wonderin'

24
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:34,316
Find yourself on the floor

25
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:45,246
You don't have to go this second.
You can stay until whenever.

26
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,334
No. We've done the hard part now.
I might as well...

27
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,826
Why don't you stay for tonight then?

28
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:55,465
Laura.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,127
You're just gonna...

30
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:22,531
My desert island, all-time top five
most memorable breakups...

31
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:25,071
in chronological order...

32
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,068
are as follows:

33
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:31,075
Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick...

34
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,866
Jackie Alden, Charlie Nicholson
and Sarah Kendrew.

35
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:38,080
Those were the ones
that really hurt.

36
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:42,584
Can you see your name
on that list, Laura?

37
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:45,712
Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten.

38
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:49,089
But there's just no room for you
in the top five. Sorry!

39
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:51,637
Those places are reserved for the kind
of humiliation and heartbreak...

40
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,216
you're just not capable of delivering.

41
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:57,893
I'm not coming home

42
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:03,021
If you really wanted to mess me up,
you should've gotten to me earlier!

43
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,146
Oh, yeah

44
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,408
Oh

45
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:21,992
Which brings us to number one
on the top five, all-time breakup list:

46
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,576
Alison Ashmore.

47
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,339
Candy on the beach
There's nothing better

48
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:31,290
One moment they weren't there. Not in
any form that interested us, anyway.

49
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:35,049
And then the next,
you couldn't miss them.

50
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,350
They were everywhere,
and they'd grown breasts.

51
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:43,644
- And we wanted...
- I want candy

52
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,267
Actually, we didn't even know
what we wanted.

53
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:48,433
- I want candy
- But it was something interesting.

54
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:52,737
- Disturbing, even.
- I want candy

55
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:56,818
- My relationship with Alison Ashmore
lasted for six hours:
- I want candy

56
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:00,952
the two hours after school,
before The Rockford Files...

57
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:03,705
for three days in a row.

58
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:08,331
But on the fourth afternoon...

59
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:10,743
Kevin Bannister.

60
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,920
Slut.

61
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:19,502
It would be nice to think that
since I was 14, times have changed...

62
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,429
relationships have become
more sophisticated...

63
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,969
females less cruel...

64
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:28,224
skins thicker,
instincts more developed.

65
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,599
But there seems to be an element
of that afternoon in everything
that's happened to me since.

66
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:40,609
All my romantic stories are
a scrambled version of that first one.

67
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:45,820
Number two on the top five, all-time
breakup list was Penny Hardwick.

68
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,570
Penny was great-looking...

69
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:51,244
and her top-five recording artists
were Carly Simon, Carole King...

70
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:55,328
James Taylor, Cat Stevens
and Elton John.

71
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:58,751
I remember when rock was young

72
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:02,502
- Me and Susie had so much fun
- Erin! No, come here!

73
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,082
Holdin'hands and skimmin'stones

74
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:08,794
- Had an old gold Chevy
and a place of my own
- She was nice.

75
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:11,639
Nice manners, nice grades, nice looking.

76
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:14,475
She was so nice, in fact,
that she wouldn't let me put my hand...

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,102
underneath or even
on top of her bra.

78
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:21,346
- Now, when she comes walkin'over
- Attack and defense.
Invasion and repulsion.

79
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:26,185
It was as if breasts were little pieces
of property that had unlawfully annexed
by the opposite sex.

80
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:28,899
They were rightfully ours,
and we wanted them back.

81
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:31,028
Crimson and clover

82
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:34,567
Sometimes I got so bored of trying
to touch her breasts that I would try
to touch her between her legs.

83
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:39,156
I was like trying to borrow a dollar,
getting turned down
and asking for 50 grand instead.

84
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,374
I wasn't interested in Penny's
nice qualities, just breasts...

85
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:47,461
and therefore she was no good to me.

86
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,631
What's the point?
It never goes anywhere.

87
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:58,263
Rob?

88
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,966
I started dating a girl who everyone
said would give it up and who didn't...

89
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,760
and Penny went with this asshole
named Chris Thompson who told me
that he had sex with her...

90
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:08,263
after something like three dates.

91
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:15,570
I own this store
called Championship Vinyl.

92
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:21,325
It's located in a neighborhood
that attracts the bare minimum
of window shoppers.

93
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,909
I get by because the people
make a special effort to shop here.

94
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:27,073
Mostly young men...

95
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:29,834
who spend all their time looking
for deleted Smiths singles...

96
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,129
and original... not re-released,
underlined... Frank Zappa albums.

97
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:49,014
Fetish properties
are not unlike porn.

98
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:53,145
I'd feel guilty taking their money
if I wasn't...

99
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,637
well, kinda one of'em.

100
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:03,739
- Morning, Dick.
- Oh. Hi. Hi, Rob.

101
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,694
- Have a good weekend?
- Yeah, okay.

102
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:10,995
Um, I found the first Liquorice Comfits
album over at Vintage Vinyl...

103
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,871
the one on Testament of Youth.

104
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,873
Never released here.
A Japanese import only.

105
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,284
Great. Great.

106
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:22,871
- I'll tape it for you.
- No, that's okay. Really.

107
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:25,882
'Cause you liked their second one,
you said. Um, Pop Girls, Etc.

108
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:29,004
That's the one
with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.

109
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:36,351
Oh, you never saw the cover, though.
You just had that tape that I made you.

110
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,471
Yeah, I haven't really
absorbed that one yet.

111
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,055
Well...

112
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:45,557
- I'll just make it for you.
- Okay.

113
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:51,155
Seymour Stein

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,774
I've been lonely

115
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:58,485
- Dick. What's this?
- It's the new Belle and Sebastian.

116
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,737
Do you like it?

117
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,209
Holy Shiite.

118
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,585
- What the fuck is that?
- It's the new Belle and Sebastian that...

119
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,919
It's a record we've been listening to
and enjoying, Barry.

120
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:22,089
Well, that's unfortunate,
because it sucks ass.

121
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:24,591
Yours, I assume.

122
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:36,106
Mmm, yeah

123
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,234
I used to think
maybe you loved me

124
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:43,528
Now, baby, I'm sure

125
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:45,870
Turn it off, Barry!

126
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:49,489
- And I just can't wait
till the day when you knock
- It won't go any louder! L...

127
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,741
- On my door
- Turn it off!

128
00:08:54,504 --> 00:09:00,292
Now every time I go for the mailbox
I gotta hold myself down

129
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:07,756
'Cause I just can't wait
till you write me your...

130
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay, buddy, uh,
I was just trying to cheer us up.

131
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:16,975
So, go ahead. Put on some old
sad bastard music. See if I care.

132
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:21,110
I don't wanna hear old sad
bastard music, Barry. I just want
something that I can ignore.

133
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:24,646
Here's the thing:
I made that tape special for today.

134
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,409
My special Monday morning tape
for you, special!

135
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:29,650
Well, it's fucking Monday afternoon!
You should get out of bed earlier!

136
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:32,448
Come on, dude. Play it.

137
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,242
Don't you wanna hear what's next?

138
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:37,490
- What's next?
- Play it.

139
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:39,707
Say it.

140
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:42,664
"Little Latin Loopy-Loo."

141
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:45,921
- Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
- No!

142
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,216
- The Righteous Brothers.
- Well, never mind.

143
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:52,469
No, not never mind.
You tell me right now... what's wrong
with the Righteous Brothers?

144
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:55,472
- Nothing.
L... I just prefer the other one.
- Bullshit!

145
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:58,642
How can it be bullshit
to state a preference?

146
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:01,763
- Since when did this store
become a fascist regime?
- Since you brought
that bullshit tape in.

147
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,437
Oh, man, that's great. That's the fun
thing about working in a record store.

148
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,098
You get to play crappy pap
you don't even wanna listen to.

149
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:11,479
I just... I thought this tape
was gonna be a fuckin'...

150
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,860
conversation stimulator, man.

151
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:17,234
I was gonna ask you for your top five
records to play on a Monday morning
and all that...

152
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,036
and you just had to
fuckin' ruin it.

153
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:22,287
- We'll do it next Monday.
- No! I wanna do it now!

154
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:27,201
I can't fire them. I hired these guys
for three days a week, and they just
started showing up every day.

155
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,702
That was four years ago.

156
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,173
Number three on the top five
all-time breakup list?

157
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,796
Charlie Nicholson.
Sophomore year of college.

158
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,463
Whoo!
Am I glad that's over.

159
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,809
As soon as I saw her I realized she was
the kind of girl I'd wanted to meet...

160
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,184
ever since I was old enough
to want to meet girls.

161
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,063
I mean, she was different.

162
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,268
She was dramatic
and she was exotic.

163
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,234
- The guy with the make-up
and the tongue.
- Gene Simmons.
- Gene Simmons. There.

164
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,020
And she talked a lot,
and when she talked she said
remarkably interesting things...

165
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:03,069
about music, books, film and politics.

166
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,073
- Yeah, Chairman Mao.
- And she talked a lot.
- Have you ever seen him
less than 300 feet tall?

167
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,954
- No.
- Huh? No.

168
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,538
And you won't will you,
sweetheart? No.

169
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:16,575
Kiss my neck. Yeah.

170
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,829
And she liked me.

171
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:22,126
She liked me.
She liked me.

172
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:24,888
At least I think she did.

173
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:28,007
- Do you like that one?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,305
It's okay.

175
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:33,512
We went out for two years, and...

176
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:36,273
I never got comfortable.

177
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:40,567
Why would a girl... No, a woman
like Charlie go out with me?

178
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:51,743
I felt like a fraud. I felt like one
of those people who suddenly shave their
heads and said they'd always been punks.

179
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:55,410
I was sure I'd be discovered
at any second.

180
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,748
And I worried about
my abilities as a lover.

181
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:14,259
And I was intimidated by other men
in her design department...

182
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:17,514
and became convinced she was
gonna leave me for one of them.

183
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:27,433
Then she left me for one of them.
The dreaded Marco.

184
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:32,519
Charlie, you fucking bitch!
Let's work it out!

185
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:36,481
Just open the fucking door!
Charlie!

186
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:39,909
Look, let's talk it... Char...

187
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,503
And then I lost it.

188
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,385
Kinda lost it all, you know?

189
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,882
Faith, dignity, about 15 pounds.

190
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,641
When I came to a few months later...

191
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:20,069
I found, to my surprise,
I had flunked out of school.

192
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:24,693
I started working in a record shop.

193
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:29,280
Some people never got over 'Nam or
the night their band opened for Nirvana.

194
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:32,041
I guess I never really
got over Charlie.

195
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:36,833
But the thing I learned
from the whole Charlie debacle
is that you gotta punch your weight.

196
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:40,124
See, Charlie, she's out of my class.

197
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:44,462
She's too pretty, too smart,
too witty, too much.

198
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,925
I mean, what am I?
I'm a middleweight.

199
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:51,010
Hey, I'm not
the smartest guy in the world,
but I'm certainly not the dumbest.

200
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,769
I mean, I've read books like
The Unbearable Lightness of Being...

201
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:58,810
and Love in the Time of Cholera and,
uh... and I think I've understood them.

202
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,563
I mean, they're about girls, right?
Just kidding.

203
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:05,225
But I have to say...

204
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:08,985
my all-time favorite book is
Johnny Cash's autobiography,
Cash by Johnny Cash.

205
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,234
- Championship.
- Hi.

206
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,707
Hi.

207
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:27,547
Um, I was thinking...

208
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:32,044
I could come by the house
and pick up some stuff while
you're at work tomorrow.

209
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:34,887
While I'm at work.
While I'm at work.

210
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,545
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- That's what you got to say is,
"Oh, boy"?

211
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:39,847
I mean, bravo.
That's...

212
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,685
- Laura, this is just so dumb.
I mean, you should...
- Look, Rob.

213
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,606
I gotta go.

214
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:50,144
Um, I'm looking for a record
for my daughter for her birthday.

215
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:54,447
"I Just Called to Say I Love You."
Do you have it?

216
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,401
- Yeah.
- Great.
- We have it.
- Great.

217
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,743
- Can I have it then?
- No. No, you can't.

218
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:04,949
- Why not?
- Well, it's sentimental, tacky crap,
that's why not.

219
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,282
Do we look like the kind of store that
sells "I Just Called to Say I Love You"?

220
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:09,582
Go to the mall.

221
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,958
- What's your problem?
- Do you even know your daughter?

222
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:15,332
There's no way she likes that song.
Oh... Uh, oh, is she in a coma?

223
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:19,374
Oh, okay, buddy. I didn't know it was
Pick On The Middle-Aged Square Guy Day.

224
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,841
My apologies.
I'll be on my way.

225
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,215
Bye-bye.

226
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,718
Fuck you.

227
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,515
Nice, Barry. Really, really nice.
That was just top class.

228
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:39,269
Rob. Top Five Musical Crimes
Perpetrated by Stevie Wonder
in the '80s and '90s. Go.

229
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:45,234
Sub-question: Is it, in fact, unfair
to criticize a formerly great artist
for his latter-day sins?

230
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,318
Is it better to burn out
than to fade away?

231
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:52,535
- Barry, I'm fucking broke, man!
- Jesus! He was gonna buy one record,
which we didn't even have, and then
leave and never come back again anyway.

232
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:55,827
- That's not the point.
What did he ever do to you?
- He offended me with his terrible taste.

233
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,160
It wasn't even his terrible taste.
It was his daughter's.

234
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:01,374
Are you defending that ass-muncher?
Come on, Rob.

235
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:03,624
You're going soft in your old age.
Jesus!

236
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:06,255
Now all of a sudden
I'm offending your golf buddy.

237
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:08,384
I'm gonna tell you something
for your own good, pal.

238
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,840
That's the worst fuckin' sweater
I've ever seen. It's a Cosby sweater.

239
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:14,221
A Cosby sweater!

240
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,682
Did Laura let you leave the house
like that, because...

241
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:19,766
- Hey...
- Hey! Hey!
- Fuckin' asshole.

242
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,434
- What are you do...
- Shut up. Will you shut up?

243
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,731
- Uh...
- Will you?
- Break it up.
- You're a fuckin' maniac.

244
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:28,112
I swear to God, if you tore this thing,
it's vintage, and I would
fuckin' sock your nose.

245
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,604
You'll pay big.

246
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,949
Are you all right?

247
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:48,708
Yeah. Look, Dick, Laura and I
broke up. She's gone.

248
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:52,665
So if you ever see Barry again,
maybe you could tell him that.

249
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,888
Of course I will, Rob.
No problem.

250
00:16:56,973 --> 00:17:00,057
No problem at all.

251
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:06,061
I'll tell him next time I see him.
Definitely.

252
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:11,058
I've, uh, got some other stuff
to tell him, anyway, so it's no problem.

253
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:15,695
I'll just tell him,
you know, about Laura...

254
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:18,069
um, when I tell him...

255
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:22,035
the other stuff.

256
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:29,827
Do you want to talk about it,
that kind of thing?

257
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,326
No. Thank you, though, Dick.

258
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:35,789
Thank you.

259
00:17:56,567 --> 00:18:01,940
Look at these. I used to dream I'd be
surrounded by exotic women's underwear
forever and ever.

260
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:06,941
Now I know they just save their best
pairs for the nights they know
they're gonna sleep with somebody.

261
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:21,584
Hello, Laura, this is your mother. Your
father's angina is a little rough today.

262
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:24,163
I thought he might like to talk to you.
It's no big deal.

263
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:26,334
I love you two. Bye-bye.

264
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,546
Anyway, me and Charlie,
we didn't match.

265
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:31,963
Marco and Charlie matched.

266
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:36,006
Me and Sarah, number four
on the all-time list? We matched.

267
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:38,771
She'd just been dumped
by some asshole named Michael.

268
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:41,724
I mean, Michael
was such an asshole.

269
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:44,104
I'd just been run over by Charlie.

270
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,398
I know exactly what you mean.

271
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:51,354
I mean, it's just
so painful and draining.

272
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:54,651
I'm just gonna be by myself
for a while.

273
00:18:54,743 --> 00:18:57,198
Me too. Me too.

274
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,037
It made sense to pool our collective
loathing for the opposite sex.

275
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:10,291
And while we were at it we could share
a bed with somebody at the same time.

276
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,632
We were frightened of being left alone
for the rest of our lives.

277
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:18,511
Only people of a certain disposition
are frightened of being left alone
for the rest of their lives at 26.

278
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,303
We were of that disposition.

279
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:24,428
- So when she told me...
- I've met someone else.

280
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:29,891
Who?

281
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,892
Just someone else.

282
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:35,519
It was contrary to the whole spirit
of our arrangement.

283
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:40,986
I don't have to take this shit.
You think I fuckin' look like shit, huh?

284
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,649
So how come I got dumped?

285
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:46,449
What?

286
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:54,159
- Hey, Dick. Come on in. What is it?
- Oh, um, well, we're going
to Lounge Axe...

287
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:59,081
and, um, I was just wondering
if you wanted to come along with us.

288
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,918
Whoa.

289
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,382
Um, Marie De Salle's playing.

290
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,175
You remember I told you
about her today? I like her.

291
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:13,180
She's kind of Sheryl Crow-ish, crossed
with a, um, post-Partridge Family,
pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing.

292
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:16,853
- But, you know, um, black.
- Yeah.

293
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:21,270
So, um, I just wanted to know
if you wanted to come along.

294
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:25,940
Barry thought so too, really,
but I guess it looks as if you're...

295
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:28,523
- reorganizing your records.
- Reorganizing my records. Yeah.

296
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:31,654
Um, what is this, uh, chronological?

297
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:34,071
No.

298
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:37,000
- Not alphabetical.
- Nope.

299
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:40,168
What?

300
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:42,329
Autobiographical.

301
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,829
- No fucking way.
- Yep.

302
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:49,502
I can tell you how I got from Deep
Purple to Howling Wolf in just 25 moves.

303
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:54,340
- Oh, my God.
- And, if I want to find the song
"Landslide," by Fleetwood Mac...

304
00:20:54,432 --> 00:21:00,019
I have to remember that I bought it
for someone in the fall of 1983 pile...

305
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:03,473
but didn't give it to them
for personal reasons.

306
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:06,056
- That sounds...
- Comforting?

307
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:08,309
- Yes.
- It is.

308
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:11,612
- Hello?
- Well, shoo.

309
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:16,193
I can stick around, you know, man,
if you... l... if you want me to help out.

310
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:19,903
But you really shouldn't,
uh, keep 'em piled like this,
because it gets really pressured.

311
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:22,321
- Hold on.
- You know?
- See you tomorrow.
- Oh. Okay.

312
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,243
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

313
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:29,793
- Hi, Mom.
- How's the store?

314
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:33,296
You know something?
You're very lucky that Laura
is doing as well as she's doing.

315
00:21:33,384 --> 00:21:36,799
Because if it wasn't for her, I don't
think either of us would ever sleep.

316
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,552
She left. She's gone.

317
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,843
What? What do you mean?

318
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,927
- Where did she go?
- How would I know where?

319
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,180
She's gone. Girlfriend leave.
Not say where gone. Laura move out.

320
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:54,560
- Well, call her mother.
- She just called.

321
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:58,697
She doesn't even know. Probably
the last time I'll ever hear her voice.

322
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:09,196
- I'm all right,
if that's what's upsetting you.
- That is not what's upsetting me.

323
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,825
- Well, it fuckin' should be,
shouldn't it?
- I knew this would happen.

324
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:15,835
- What are you gonna do, Rob?
- I'm gonna drink a bottle of wine,
I'm gonna watch TV and go to bed.

325
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,960
- Then I'm gonna go to work.
- And then what?

326
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:19,839
I'm gonna meet a nice girl
and have children.

327
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:22,676
I promise the next time we talk,
I'll have it all figured out. Okay?

328
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,168
- I knew... I knew it was
gonna happen again.
- What are you getting so upset about?

329
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,049
- Do you know why she left?
- It's got nothing to do with marriage.

330
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:31,640
- So you say!
- Mom, I'm telling you for the last time.

331
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:35,096
Laura didn't even want to get married.
She's not that kind of girl.

332
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:39,056
- That's not what happens now. Okay?
- Oh, I don't know what happens now.

333
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,934
Apart from you meet someone,
you move in, she goes!

334
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,733
You meet someone,
you move in, she goes!

335
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,195
Shut up, Mom! Goddam!

336
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,154
That's some cold shit.

337
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:58,371
John Dillinger was shot dead behind
that theater in a hail of FBI gunfire.

338
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:02,159
You know who tipped 'em off?
His fuckin' girlfriend.

339
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:05,457
He just wanted to go to the movies.

340
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:17,469
Is that Peter fucking Frampton?

341
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,638
I wish I could buy words

342
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,136
Out of season

343
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:28,354
So don't

344
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:32,275
Don't hesitate

345
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:35,732
'Cause our love

346
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:39,029
Just won't wait

347
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:45,620
Ooh, baby, I love your way

348
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,458
- Rob.
- Wanna tell you I love
- What?

349
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,753
- Yeah. Hey.
- Your way

350
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:55,711
- I always hated that song.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

351
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,968
- Now I kinda like it.
- Wanna be with you night and day
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:01,462
Yeah.

353
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,555
'Cause I

354
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:09,510
She should've done it on
The Number Four with a Smile.

355
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:13,139
Wasn't her record called
Number Four with a Smile?

356
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,724
- That's what I said.
- No, no. You said
"The Number Four with a Smile."

357
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:17,692
There's no "The" at the front
of the title of the album.

358
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,696
It's a reference to
a Chinese meal in Toronto...

359
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:24,280
uh, so I think that there is "The,"
but I could be wrong.

360
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:29,528
- You can be, and are, wrong.
- Wanna tell you I love your way

361
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:35,161
I wanna be with you
night and day

362
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:39,036
I wanna date a musician.

363
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:41,538
- 'Cause I
- I wanna live with a musician.

364
00:24:41,634 --> 00:24:44,919
- Feel that you
- She'd write songs at home
and ask me what I thought of'em...

365
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:48,630
and maybe even include one of our
private little jokes in the liner notes.

366
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:52,934
Maybe a little picture of me
in the liner notes.

367
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:55,307
Just in the background somewhere.

368
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:58,432
- Don't hesitate
- Yeah.

369
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:11,116
- So, um, do you live in Chicago now?
- I do.

370
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:13,906
Do you love it?
You should come to our record store.

371
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,703
- Championship Vinyl.
- Oh, my God, yes. Oh, you'd love it.

372
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,911
- We sell a little bit
of anything that matters.
- He owns it. It's on Milwaukee.

373
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:22,043
- Rock, soul, trip-hop, salsa.
- Ska, techno and pop.

374
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:23,408
- Will you come?
- Yeah, Marie.
- Okay, okay.
- Sounds good.

375
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:25,496
- Championship Vinyl.
- Championship Vinyl.
- Enjoyed your set.

376
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:28,080
Thank you.

377
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:31,009
- Barry, why'd you tell her
about the store, man?
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.

378
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:33,216
I didn't know
it was classified information.

379
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:36,340
I mean, I know we don't have
any customers, but I thought
that was a bad thing...

380
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:39,468
not, like, a business strategy.

381
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:56,232
Rob? It's Liz.

382
00:25:56,325 --> 00:26:01,745
Just calling to see if,
you know, well, you're okay.

383
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:07,203
Look, I'm your friend too,
so I'm not taking sides. Yet.

384
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:12,084
- Shadows grow so long before my eyes
- Give me a call. Okay? Bye.

385
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:44,527
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

386
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:47,190
- Took the morning off.
- Come on, Rob.

387
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:50,073
Do you still love me?

388
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,699
Well, it's not really the issue,
is it?

389
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:58,541
Why? I mean, what else is there?
What do you mean? What else is there?

390
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,920
I don't know. It doesn't change
the way we don't get along at all.

391
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,845
In fact, I hope we're not
in love any more, to be honest.

392
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,930
- It would give me a better
opinion of love right now.
- Come on!

393
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:14,475
What, did I beat you?
Did I tell you you were a bad person?
I mean, what the fuck?

394
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:17,561
- What should I have done
to make you happy?
- Nothing. Make yourself happy.

395
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:20,102
Oh, I see.
Um, wh-why am I not happy?

396
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:25,813
Because you're the same person
you used to be...

397
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:29,319
and I'm not.

398
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:33,321
- And all I've done is change jobs.
- Clothes and hairstyles.

399
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,861
- Attitudes and friends.
- I couldn't go to work
with my hair dyed pink.

400
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,822
- You're harder.
- You haven't changed so much as
a pair of socks since I've known you.

401
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:44,120
- Oh, come on, Laura.
Now you're just being stupid.
- At least you used to
talk about the future.

402
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:46,417
Now you don't even do that.

403
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:50,289
- Look, I'm all right.
You're the one that hates her job.
- See? You haven't got a clue.

404
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:52,791
I like my job.

405
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:56,301
All I'm saying is, you have to allow
for things to happen to people...

406
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,714
most of all to yourself.

407
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,476
And you don't, Rob.

408
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:03,968
So what's the use?

409
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:17,116
Rob, it's your turn.

410
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:19,690
Okay, I'm feeling kinda basic today.

411
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:23,200
Top Five Side Ones, Track Ones.

412
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:25,957
"Janie Jones," The Clash,
from The Clash.

413
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,290
"Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye,
from Let's Get It On."

414
00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:31,618
Nirvana, "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
off of Nevermind.

415
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,918
Oh, no, Rob, that's not obvious enough.
Not at all.

416
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,247
How about, uh, "Point of No Return"
on Point of No Return?

417
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,832
- Louis, you couldn't get up...
- Shut up. Shut up.

418
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:42,046
- "White Light/White Heat,"
Velvet Underground.
- Okay, that would be on my list.

419
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,257
- Though not on mine.
- And Massive Attack, No Protection.

420
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,100
- The song is
"Radiation Ruling the Nation."
- Ohh!

421
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:53,427
- Kind of a new record. Very...
- Excuse me. I was in here last night...
- In a minute. Very nice, Rob.

422
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,686
A sly declaration of new classic status
slipped into a list of old safe ones.

423
00:28:57,776 --> 00:29:00,397
Very pussy.

424
00:29:00,487 --> 00:29:02,195
- Excuse me, I was in here last...
- In a minute.

425
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,779
Couldn't you be any more obvious
than that, Rob? How about, uh,
I don't know, the Beatles?

426
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:11,109
How about fucking... fucking Beethoven?
Track one, side one
of the Fifth Symphony.

427
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:14,621
How can someone who has no interest
in music own a record store?

428
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:18,042
Do you still have that, uh, Beefheart
French import, Safe as Milk?

429
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:26,004
Um, let's see.

430
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,631
Ah, yes, here it is.

431
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:34,182
Yes.

432
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:38,930
- How much you want for it?
- Uh...

433
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:42,979
Yes... Oh, no.
You know what?

434
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:47,064
- I don't think I'm selling it
this week. Maybe next week.
- Oh, no. You said that last week.

435
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:51,732
Did I? Yeah, well,
I just... l... Uh...

436
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:54,149
Nicely played.

437
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:56,698
You know, I don't have that record.
I'll buy it for 40.

438
00:29:56,787 --> 00:29:59,657
- Rob?
- Sold.

439
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:03,199
- Now, why would you sell it to me
and not to him?
- Because you're not a geek, Louis.

440
00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:06,993
- You guys are snobs.
- No, we're not.
- No, seriously, you're totally elitist.

441
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:11,630
You feel like the unappreciated
scholars, so you shit on the people
who know less than you.

442
00:30:11,717 --> 00:30:15,002
- No.
- Which is everybody.
- Yes.

443
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,218
It's just sad, that's all.

444
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:24,227
I'm sick of the sight of this place.

445
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:26,803
Some days I'm afraid
I'll go berserk...

446
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:28,771
throw the country "A" through "K" rack
out on the street...

447
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:32,522
and go work at a Virgin Megastore
and never come back.

448
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:39,522
- Hello.
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Rob.

449
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:42,950
You know, I just wanted to call
and thank you for that message
you sent me last night.

450
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:46,156
It really made me feel
like less of an asshole.

451
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:51,324
Oh. Well, how are you holding up?

452
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:55,286
Good. Good. I mean, look, maybe we're
just not right for each other, right?

453
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:57,622
- I mean, or maybe we are.
- Mmm. Yeah.

454
00:30:57,716 --> 00:31:01,927
Time will tell at this point,
and if it's time to move on,
it's time to move on.

455
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:06,340
I don't know. L...
I don't want to take sides and...

456
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:10,215
And I like you with Laura.
I think you guys are good together.

457
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,726
And I don't think much
of this Ian guy.

458
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:18,149
Rob, Marie De Salle
is in the store.

459
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,438
I gotta go, Liz.

460
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:30,285
- We should maybe turn off her music.
- I know.

461
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,861
Hey. I like the music.

462
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:35,529
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean,
I can go turn it off if you want.

463
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,950
You might be sick of it.

464
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:40,202
- You should turn it up.
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Yeah.

465
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:44,340
Okay, let me go do that after I go
do something else that I have to go do.

466
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:48,007
- All righty. Hmm.
- Yeah, I got the, uh... Excuse me. Okay?

467
00:32:00,897 --> 00:32:03,981
What fucking Ian guy?

468
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:08,314
Laura doesn't know anybody called Ian.

469
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:12,946
There's no Ian in her office.
She has no friends called Ian!

470
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:16,567
I'm almost certain she has never met
anyone named Ian in her entire life.

471
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:18,452
She lives in an...

472
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:22,113
"Ian-less" universe.

473
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,383
"I. Raymond."

474
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:37,259
Ray. "I."

475
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,588
Ian.

476
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:44,806
Mr I. Raymond. Ray to his friends,
and more importantly to his neighbor.

477
00:32:44,894 --> 00:32:47,930
The guy who, until about six weeks ago,
lived upstairs.

478
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:50,228
I start to remember things
about him now.

479
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,392
His horrible clothes and hair.

480
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:56,647
His music: Latin, Bulgarian, whatever
world music was trendy that week.

481
00:32:56,738 --> 00:33:00,949
He had rings on his fingers.
Awful cooking smells.

482
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:04,367
I never liked him much then,
and I fuckin' hate him now.

483
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:19,462
We used to listen to him
having sex upstairs.

484
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,894
Jeez, he goes on long enough.

485
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:37,229
Mm-hmm.
I should be so lucky.

486
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:54,579
It feels so good

487
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:57,950
You are as abandoned and noisy
as any character in a porn film, Laura.

488
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:02,787
You are Ian's plaything,
responding to his touch
with shrieks of orgasmic delight.

489
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,921
No woman in the history of the world
is having better sex than
the sex you are having with Ian...

490
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:09,172
in my head.

491
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,721
Oh, baby, give it up

492
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:16,048
Ain't no use

493
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:30,399
Number five: Jackie Alden.

494
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:34,650
Jackie Alden's breakup had no effect
on my life whatsoever.

495
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,232
It was a casual thing,
and I was glad when it ended.

496
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:41,406
I just slotted her in
to bump Laura out of position.

497
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:45,162
But now, congratulations, Laura.

498
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,493
You made it to the top five.

499
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:52,047
Number five with a bullet.
Welcome.

500
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:56,592
Won't somebody please

501
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,342
Help me with my misery

502
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,019
- Can't somebody see
- Hey.

503
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,976
Do you have soul?

504
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:11,431
What this one love's done to me

505
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:13,896
That all depends.

506
00:35:13,984 --> 00:35:18,231
- Now I know, I know
- Back row, right next to the blues.

507
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:20,729
Championship Vinyl.

508
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:25,656
Yeah. Yeah, I'm interested.
Sure.

509
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:28,662
What's your address?

510
00:35:29,998 --> 00:35:32,667
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Rob.

511
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:35,420
You fucking asshole!

512
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:41,672
Hi, Barry.

513
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,959
Soarin'and borin'

514
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:51,182
I feel I'm ignorin'

515
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:54,055
My time in the world
Have you heard

516
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:59,233
For a couple of years
I was a deejay at a club.

517
00:35:59,317 --> 00:36:01,273
I was good at it, I think...

518
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,277
and while I was doing it
is the happiest I've ever been.

519
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:06,070
And that's where I met Laura.

520
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:12,278
She was already a lawyer,
but she worked for Legal Aid...

521
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,741
hence the leather jacket
and the clubbing.

522
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,573
Oh, I liked her right away.

523
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:19,286
- Hey!
- Hey!

524
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:22,791
- That's a kick-ass record.
- What?

525
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:26,958
- That's a kick-ass record.
- Yeah. I know.

526
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:33,718
- Um, what's your name?
- Laura.

527
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:41,060
Hey. I was gonna say, come back
next week and I'll make you a tape.

528
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:43,896
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay?
- Great.

529
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,649
- Rob.
- I'm still Laura.

530
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:52,731
To be honest, I hadn't met
anyone as promising as Laura
since I started deejaying...

531
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:56,984
and meeting promising women
is kind of what the deejaying thing
is supposed to be about.

532
00:36:58,494 --> 00:37:02,906
And anyway, we...
we moved on from there.

533
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:08,502
She lost her lease on her apartment
in Lakeview, and she moved in with me.

534
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:12,453
And it stayed that way for years.

535
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:16,248
She didn't make me miserable,
or anxious...

536
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:18,335
or ill-at-ease.

537
00:37:18,428 --> 00:37:22,508
And you know, it sounds boring,
but it wasn't.

538
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:26,305
It wasn't spectacular, either.
It was just...

539
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:30,186
good.

540
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:36,101
But really good.

541
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:39,229
So, how come
I'm suddenly an asshole?

542
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:50,705
I get the feeling
that Liz talked to Laura...

543
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:53,873
and Liz stuck up for me...

544
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,995
and Laura told her a few things.

545
00:37:57,087 --> 00:38:00,704
I don't know what precisely
Laura said, but she would have
revealed at least two,

546
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:04,631
maybe even all four
of the following pieces of information.

547
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:11,425
One: That I slept with someone else...

548
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:14,683
- He slept with somebody else.
- What?

549
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,474
While she, Laura, was pregnant.

550
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:21,561
- While I was pregnant.
- No!

551
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:24,058
Two:

552
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:26,774
That my affair
directly contributed...

553
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:30,113
Pretty much directly to me
terminating the pregnancy.

554
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,986
- No.
- Three:

555
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:37,288
That after the abortion, I borrowed
a large sum of money from her...

556
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:41,239
- Four grand or so.
- And have not, as of yet,
repaid any of it.

557
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:43,243
The bastard!

558
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:45,127
Four:

559
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:48,747
That shortly before she left me...

560
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:52,838
I told her that I was kind of
unhappy in the relationship...

561
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:57,304
and maybe sort of looking around
for someone else.

562
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,640
He was "sort of, maybe"
looking around for somebody else.

563
00:39:00,726 --> 00:39:03,762
- Did I do and say those things?
- Yes.

564
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:06,558
- No!
- Yes, I did.

565
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:10,102
I am a fuckin' asshole.

566
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,561
- That's it.
- Liz... No. Sit down.

567
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:16,447
Sit down.

568
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:20,198
That's shocking.

569
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:22,243
That is shocking.

570
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,283
First of all, the money.

571
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:33,082
Laura had it and I didn't.

572
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:36,042
And she wanted to give it to me.

573
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:40,841
I've never been able to pay her back
because I've never been able to.

574
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,336
Just because she moved in
with some Supertramp fan...

575
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:45,756
it doesn't make me
five grand richer.

576
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,349
And number two, this stuff about me
half-looking around for someone else?

577
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:51,429
She tricked me into saying it.

578
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:53,763
We were having this State-of-the-Union
type conversation...

579
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:57,023
and she said, quite matter of factly,
that we were pretty unhappy
at the moment.

580
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,435
And did I agree?
And I said yes.

581
00:39:59,528 --> 00:40:03,822
And she asked me whether I ever
thought about meeting other people.

582
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:06,861
So then I asked her if she ever
thought about meeting someone else.

583
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:11,827
She says, "Of course." So I admit
that, yes, I daydream about it
from time to time.

584
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:15,579
Now I can see what we were really
talking about is her and Ian...

585
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:17,791
and she suckered me
into absolving her.

586
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:21,923
It was a sneaky lawyer's trick
and I fell for it...

587
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:25,043
because she's much smarter
than me.

588
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:32,800
All right, then the pregnancy.

589
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:37,220
I didn't know she was pregnant.
Of course I didn't.

590
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:40,147
I didn't know
because she hadn't told me.

591
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:45,569
She hadn't told me because
I had told her that I had sor...
Yes, I'd slept with someone else.

592
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:48,938
So I didn't find out she was pregnant
till way later.

593
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:54,607
We were going through this good period
and I made some crack about
having kids and...

594
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,695
- What?
- And she just burst into tears.

595
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,661
And I said, "Well, what is it,"
you know. "What..."

596
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,416
And I made her tell me,
and she did...

597
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,951
and I went into
this brief and ill-advised bout
of self-righteousness, you know...

598
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,793
What right do you have? My child too...
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

599
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:16,004
That pretty much
brings us up to date.

600
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:19,844
Who needs a drink?

601
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:27,269
Who loves the sun

602
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:30,559
Who cares that it makes
plants grow

603
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:36,022
What's wrong with me?
Seriously.

604
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:39,317
What happened?

605
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:43,109
Why am I doomed to be left?

606
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:45,611
Doomed to be rejected?

607
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:48,113
I need answers.

608
00:41:50,669 --> 00:41:54,666
Number one.
To Alison Ashmore.

609
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,208
- Hello?
- This is, uh, Rob Gordon calling.

610
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:01,673
- Hi.
- I'm an old friend of Alison's and, um...

611
00:42:01,762 --> 00:42:04,881
- What did you say your name was?
- Rob. Rob Gordon.

612
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:10,179
Um, I was actually her... her first
boyfriend in-in-in the seventh grade...

613
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:12,938
and I was just wondering
if you had any way of reaching her
or her number or...

614
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:17,184
I hate to quibble with you, Rob,
but Alison married her first boyfriend.

615
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:21,604
Kevin Bannister.
He is her first and last boyfriend.

616
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:24,482
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Uh, no, I'm quite serious.

617
00:42:24,573 --> 00:42:28,487
She is Mrs Kevin Bannister.
She lives in Australia.

618
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:31,780
- We went out together
in the seventh grade.
- I beg your pardon.

619
00:42:31,872 --> 00:42:34,956
Well, technically,
I'm her first boyfriend, okay?

620
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:38,161
I met her a few days before Kevin did.
Technically, number one. Me.

621
00:42:38,253 --> 00:42:41,668
- I don't know what you mean
by "technically."
- You know.

622
00:42:41,756 --> 00:42:43,962
I'm number one. Me. Technically.

623
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:46,587
I see.
Well, maybe it's my mistake.

624
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:49,843
I've got to go now, Bob.
Okay, bye-bye.

625
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:56,768
Who loves the sun

626
00:42:56,852 --> 00:43:01,727
Alison married Kevin!

627
00:43:01,815 --> 00:43:05,266
I am fine now!

628
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,435
Married her junior high school
sweetheart.

629
00:43:07,528 --> 00:43:11,477
Kissed me on the bench. Kissed Kevin
on the bench. Married Kevin.

630
00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:15,273
This is great!
This has got nothing to do with me.

631
00:43:15,368 --> 00:43:17,693
This is fate.
This is destiny.

632
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:21,487
It is beyond my control,
beyond my fault. I love this!

633
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:29,165
I want more. I want to see the others
on the big top five.

634
00:43:29,255 --> 00:43:32,422
I wanna see Penny and Charlie and Sarah,
all of them, you know.

635
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:37,549
Just see 'em and talk to 'em,
you know, like a Bruce Springsteen song.

636
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:41,173
You call, you ask 'em how they are,
and you see if they've forgiven you.

637
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:45,098
Yeah, and then...
and then I'd feel good.

638
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:47,310
And they'd feel good.

639
00:43:47,397 --> 00:43:50,433
No, they'd feel good maybe,
but you'd feel better.

640
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:55,396
I'd feel clean and calm.

641
00:43:55,487 --> 00:44:00,445
That's what you're looking for.
You wanna get ready to start again,
that'd be good for you.

642
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:03,819
Great, even.

643
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:09,249
You'd give that big final "good luck
and goodbye" to your all-time top five
and just move on down the road.

644
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:14,242
Good luck. Goodbye.

645
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:18,380
Thanks, Boss.

646
00:44:19,467 --> 00:44:23,546
Penny is as beautiful as she was in high
school and really grown into herself.

647
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:26,507
She reviews movies for a living,
which is unassailably cool...

648
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:30,891
even if she does make these little notes
with this little flashlight pen.

649
00:44:30,977 --> 00:44:36,101
We have a good time,
and we hate the same actors,
and everything's going great.

650
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,859
She tells me about her life.
I tell her about mine.

651
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,230
We both get it.
We both relate.

652
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,816
And then, with no real explanation,
I just launch into it.

653
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:48,398
I tell her about how Laura
wanted to sleep with Ian and not me...

654
00:44:48,493 --> 00:44:50,865
Charlie wanted to sleep with Marco
and not me...

655
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:53,954
Alison Ashmore wanted Kevin Bannister
and not me.

656
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,708
And you, you wanted to... you wanted
to have sex with Chris Thompson...

657
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,784
and not me.

658
00:44:58,877 --> 00:45:02,080
And I was helping...
hoping you could help me understand
why this keeps happening...

659
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:06,334
why, you know, I'm doomed to be left,
doomed to be rejected.

660
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:09,046
Do you understand?

661
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:13,382
Well, Rob, uh, I was crazy about you.

662
00:45:13,473 --> 00:45:17,969
I wanted to sleep with you one day,
but not when I was 16.

663
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,144
You know, when you broke up with me...

664
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,230
you broke up with me
because I was, I was...

665
00:45:24,316 --> 00:45:26,522
to use your charming expression,
tight...

666
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:28,566
I cried and I cried and I hated you...

667
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:32,271
and when that little shit bag
asked me out and I was too tired
to fight him off...

668
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:35,650
it wasn't rape, because I said okay,
but it wasn't far off.

669
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:39,870
You know I couldn't have sex until after
college because I hated it so much?

670
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:43,998
That's when you're supposed
to have sex, Rob... in college!

671
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:46,787
And now you want to have
a little chat about rejection.

672
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,747
Well, fuck you, Rob.

673
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:56,835
God, she's right.

674
00:45:56,928 --> 00:46:00,546
I broke up with her.
I rejected her.

675
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,258
That's another one I don't have to worry
about. I should've done this years ago.

676
00:46:04,352 --> 00:46:06,842
Ma'am, could I get the cheque, please?

677
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:10,929
Next up, Charlie.

678
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:15,271
But I'm not quite ready for that...

679
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:18,777
so I go directly to number four
on the all-time breakup list.

680
00:46:18,864 --> 00:46:22,233
Sarah, my partner in rejection
who rejected me.

681
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,946
- Hi, Rob.
- Hi.

682
00:46:27,038 --> 00:46:29,659
Nice to see you.

683
00:46:29,749 --> 00:46:32,702
- Hi. Okay, yeah.
- Nice to see you.

684
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,417
- Yeah.
- You want me to come...
- You wanna...
- Sure.

685
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:37,207
- You wanna...
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go out a bit.

686
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,870
I can't believe I left you for him.

687
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:43,584
- Probably seemed like a good idea
at the time, Sarah.
- Yeah, I don't know why, though.

688
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:51,590
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Um, no, yeah.

689
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,724
- No?
- Yeah. I mean, I'm not...
- No.

690
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,136
L-l-I am. I'm in between things.
How are you doin'?

691
00:46:56,231 --> 00:47:00,062
- Me? I'm not good.
- Really?
- No.

692
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:03,851
Oh, it's so hard.
The medication I was on is not working.

693
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:08,074
So we're trying something else,
but it's like, they don't know about it,
so I'm like a guinea pig, and...

694
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,827
But I'm making money. That's good,
'cause I lost my job a month ago.

695
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,610
- So it's been, like, hand-to-mouth...
- No, I haven't got the heart
for the rejection conversation.

696
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:18,038
There are no hard feelings here,
and I'm glad she ditched me
and not the other way around.

697
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,998
I'm late for work, and l...
I'll call you.

698
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,706
- Okay.
- Nice to see you. Bye.
- Bye. See you later.

699
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:29,336
I could've wound up
having sex back there.

700
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:34,420
And what better way to exorcise
rejection demons than to screw
the person who rejected you, right?

701
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:36,507
But you wouldn't be sleeping
with a person.

702
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,888
You'd be sleeping with a whole,
sad single-person culture.

703
00:47:38,976 --> 00:47:43,223
It'd be like sleeping with Talia Shire
in Rocky if you weren't Rocky.

704
00:47:43,314 --> 00:47:46,100
I feel guilty enough as it is.

705
00:47:46,191 --> 00:47:48,942
There's only Charlie left now.

706
00:47:51,112 --> 00:47:54,812
She's in the fuckin' phone book.

707
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:58,157
She should be living on Neptune.
She's an extraterrestrial.

708
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:01,493
A ghost, a myth,
not a person in a phone book.

709
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:09,703
- Hi, this is Charlie.
- Answering machine.

710
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:13,461
- Leave me a message...
- I'll leave a nice, polite message
and she'll never call back.

711
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,584
Oh, the Killing Moon EP, it's almost
impossible to find, especially on CD.

712
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:22,546
Yet another cruel trick
played on all the dumb-asses
who got rid of their turntables.

713
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,676
- But every other
Echo and the Bunnymen album...
- Yeah, I have all the other ones.

714
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:28,140
Oh, you do? Well, how about
the Jesus and Mary Chain?

715
00:48:28,229 --> 00:48:29,936
- Ah, they always seemed...
- They always seemed what?

716
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:31,979
They always seemed really great
is what they always seemed.

717
00:48:32,065 --> 00:48:35,648
They picked up where your precious Echo
left off, and you're sittin' around
complainin' about no more Echo albums.

718
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:39,020
I can't believe you don't own
this fucking record. That's insane.

719
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:41,070
Jesus!

720
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,822
- Can I get two receipts with that?
- Well, the interesting thing
about Green Day...

721
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,661
is that so much of their music is,
in truth...

722
00:48:47,746 --> 00:48:52,371
directly influenced by,
in my opinion, uh, two bands...

723
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,118
- The Clash...
- The Clash.

724
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,083
Uh, correct, uh, the Clash.

725
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:01,329
Uh, but also by this band called,
uh, Stiff Little Fingers.

726
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:08,219
Um, I think you would really
love this band.

727
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:21,314
Uh, it sounds great.

728
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:26,693
- My name's Anaugh.
- The name...

729
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:28,820
Um, my name's Dick.

730
00:49:28,907 --> 00:49:32,157
Is this the new Green Day?

731
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:38,367
You don't have it?
That is perverse.

732
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:42,157
Don't tell anybody
you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.

733
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:45,911
It's gonna be okay.

734
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:54,250
I will now sell five copies
of the three EPs by the Beta Band.

735
00:49:54,346 --> 00:49:56,801
Do it.

736
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:07,431
If there's something inside
that you wanna say

737
00:50:07,524 --> 00:50:10,276
Say it loud
It'll be okay

738
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,396
I will be all right
I will be all right

739
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:16,607
I will be all right
I will be all right

740
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,950
If there's something inside
that you wanna say

741
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:22,787
- You can say it loud, it'll be okay
- Who is that?

742
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:25,872
- It's the Beta Band.
- It's good.

743
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:27,618
I know.

744
00:50:36,592 --> 00:50:38,501
- Barry! The door!
- Fuck!

745
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:41,001
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go, go, go, go!

746
00:50:43,765 --> 00:50:46,256
- Gotta go back!
- Hey!

747
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:51,557
Okay, fuckos, how much is this deck
worth to you, and how much
did you steal? Can you do the math?

748
00:50:51,647 --> 00:50:55,146
- Barry, call the cops.
- No!
- Hold up, hold up.

749
00:50:58,778 --> 00:51:05,314
Ryuichi Sakamoto, Sigue Sigue Sputnik,
Breakbeats, Serge Gainsbourg.

750
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:08,113
- What, are you guys
stealing for other people?
- No, those are for us.

751
00:51:08,203 --> 00:51:10,872
- You guys slamming to Joni Mitchell now?
- Man, you're, like, so bigoted.

752
00:51:10,955 --> 00:51:14,573
- You look at us and think you know
what we listen to.
- I think you have more.

753
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,375
Okay.

754
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:38,265
Hi.

755
00:51:38,355 --> 00:51:42,269
- What do you want?
- I thought I could
give you a ride back.

756
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:48,486
- Are you coming home?
- Yeah.

757
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:52,652
Well, I'd like to come over
to your house to pick up some things.

758
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,163
My house.

759
00:52:05,712 --> 00:52:08,832
How'd it go today?

760
00:52:08,923 --> 00:52:11,082
All right.

761
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:14,211
- Do you want to go?
- Sure.

762
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:30,547
So, have you tackled
the great reorganization yet?

763
00:52:30,637 --> 00:52:35,382
You bet. You can take this
with you if you want.

764
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:39,638
Look at this place.
Laura, it's a dump.

765
00:52:39,728 --> 00:52:42,645
What are you making now?
Sixty, seventy a year?

766
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:44,723
And you were living
in this shithole.

767
00:52:44,816 --> 00:52:47,733
Bet you can't even remember
what you were doing here.

768
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:50,689
I was here because
I wanted to be with you.

769
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,151
It had nothing
to do with this place.

770
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,320
So, uh, where are you staying now?

771
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,948
I think you know that.

772
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:03,204
- I had to work that out
for myself, though, didn't I?
- I'm sorry.

773
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,959
I know I haven't been very fair.

774
00:53:06,043 --> 00:53:09,043
That's why I came
to the store tonight.

775
00:53:09,129 --> 00:53:12,046
It took me a while
to work up the courage.

776
00:53:12,132 --> 00:53:15,500
- You scared now?
- Yes, of course I am.

777
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:18,166
I feel terrible, Rob.
You know, this is really hard.

778
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:20,966
Good.

779
00:53:21,056 --> 00:53:25,966
So how is everything
going with Ian?

780
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,895
Is it working out okay?

781
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:30,972
- You're living with the guy.
- Don't.

782
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:33,187
I'm just asking you how it's going.

783
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:35,813
Look, I'm not living
with the guy, okay?

784
00:53:35,903 --> 00:53:39,817
I'm just staying with him for a few days
until I figure out what I'm doing.

785
00:53:39,907 --> 00:53:44,367
I left because we weren't
exactly getting along,
and we weren't talking about it.

786
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:46,445
I'm getting to a point where
I want to get my shit together...

787
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:50,451
and I can't really see that
ever happening with you.

788
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:53,826
And, yes, I sort of got
interested in someone else.

789
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:58,130
And that went further
than it should have, so it seemed
like a good time to go.

790
00:53:59,882 --> 00:54:03,630
But I have no idea what will happen
with Ian in the long run.

791
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:07,879
Probably nothing.

792
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:16,477
So, what?

793
00:54:16,564 --> 00:54:20,430
You definitely haven't
decided to dump me? Is that it?

794
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:22,814
There's still a chance
we might get back together?

795
00:54:22,902 --> 00:54:27,113
- I don't know.
- Well, if you don't know...

796
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,109
there's a chance, right?

797
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:39,205
I mean, it would be like
if someone was in the hospital
and he was seriously ill...

798
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:42,541
and the doctor said,
"I don't know if this patient
has a chance of survival or not."

799
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:45,962
That doesn't mean that the patient's
definitely gonna die now, does it?
I mean, he might live.

800
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:48,337
- Even if it's a remote possibility.
- I suppose so.

801
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:49,968
- So we have a chance of not...
- Shut up, Rob.

802
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:52,377
- I just want to know where I stand here.
What chance do we have?
- What...

803
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:56,515
- I don't know what chance we have.
- If you could tell me roughly-

804
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:00,347
All right, we have a nine percent chance
of getting back together.

805
00:55:00,436 --> 00:55:02,594
- Nine?
- Nine.

806
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:05,309
- Great.
- Look, I know I'm asking a lot...

807
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:08,020
but could you take off for a while
so I can get my stuff packed up?

808
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:09,568
No problem.

809
00:55:09,652 --> 00:55:13,151
- You want me to leave my own house?
- Yes, please.

810
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:21,612
Laura, can I ask you one question?

811
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:24,373
Yes. One.

812
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:28,707
- You're not gonna like it.
- Just ask it.

813
00:55:32,255 --> 00:55:36,418
- Is it better?
- Is what better? Better than what?

814
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:42,179
Well, sex, I guess. Is it better?

815
00:55:42,264 --> 00:55:46,925
- Is that really what's bothering you?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

816
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:50,268
Do you really think
it would make a difference either way?

817
00:55:50,355 --> 00:55:53,771
- I don't know.
- Well, the answer is,
I don't know either.

818
00:55:53,858 --> 00:55:55,436
We haven't done it yet.

819
00:55:57,862 --> 00:56:01,942
- Never?
- I haven't felt like it.

820
00:56:02,032 --> 00:56:03,859
Not even before,
when he was living upstairs?

821
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:08,411
No. I was living
with you, remember?

822
00:56:08,496 --> 00:56:11,366
We've slept together,
but we haven't made love.

823
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:15,451
Not yet.

824
00:56:17,462 --> 00:56:19,704
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What?

825
00:56:21,674 --> 00:56:24,343
Sleeping together is better.

826
00:56:25,428 --> 00:56:27,634
Sleeping together is better?

827
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:31,718
But not the sex, because
you haven't done it yet?

828
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:34,429
- Will you please just go?
- Yeah.

829
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:37,935
We are the champions

830
00:56:38,022 --> 00:56:41,686
- My friends
- Yes!

831
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:45,724
- And we'll keep on fighting
- Put 'em up!

832
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,652
- Till the end
- I feel good. I feel great.

833
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,156
- We are the champions
- I feel like a new man.

834
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,366
- I feel so much better, in fact...
- We are the champions

835
00:56:55,455 --> 00:57:00,282
- that I go straight out
and sleep with Marie De Salle.
- No time for losers

836
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:05,286
'Cause we are the champions

837
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,921
"How could this have happened?"
You ask.

838
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:16,055
"How does he...
How does he do it?"

839
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:21,599
How does a regular guy like me
become the number one lover man
in his particular postal district?

840
00:57:21,686 --> 00:57:26,264
He's grumpy. He's broke. He hangs out
with the musical moron twins...

841
00:57:26,357 --> 00:57:30,567
and yet he gets to go to bed
with somebody like Marie De Salle.

842
00:57:30,652 --> 00:57:33,818
Hey. Marie.

843
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:36,775
- Everything go all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

844
00:57:36,866 --> 00:57:40,649
She just wanted to pick up some stuff,
you know. It was no big deal.
It was just...

845
00:57:40,744 --> 00:57:44,326
I hate that time,
picking-up-stuff time.

846
00:57:44,414 --> 00:57:48,493
- You know that song I play,
"Eartha Kitt Times Two"?
- Of course!

847
00:57:48,584 --> 00:57:51,704
I wrote that about me and my ex
dividing our record collection.

848
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:54,796
It's a great, great song.

849
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:57,123
- Awhile back,
Dick, Barry and I agreed...
- I wrote that just before I moved here.

850
00:57:57,217 --> 00:58:00,217
That what really matters
is what you like...

851
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:02,877
not what you are like.

852
00:58:02,973 --> 00:58:05,012
Books, records, films...
These things matter.

853
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,017
Call me shallow.
It's the fuckin' truth.

854
00:58:08,102 --> 00:58:11,352
And by this measure, I was having
one of the best dates of my life.

855
00:58:11,438 --> 00:58:13,846
- You love that show?
- Yes!

856
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:16,229
Starring, um... Starring, um...
Who starred in The Prisoner?

857
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:18,689
- McGoohan.
- Patrick McGoohan.
- That's right!

858
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:22,858
And then we talk about our exes.

859
00:58:22,948 --> 00:58:26,566
She's dry and self-deprecating.

860
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,863
Great sense of humor about it,
and I can really see why
her songs are so good.

861
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:34,165
- I guess she's happy with him.
- I don't speak about Laura
with as much depth.

862
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,416
But it feels, even to me,
like I'm being intimate.

863
00:58:37,503 --> 00:58:40,539
I express regret.
I say nice things about her...

864
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:46,502
and I hint at a deep ocean of melancholy
just below the surface...

865
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:48,835
which is all bullshit really.

866
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:52,713
I've just invented a sketch
of a decent, sensitive guy...

867
00:58:52,808 --> 00:58:55,512
because I'm in the position
to invent him.

868
00:58:55,602 --> 00:58:59,350
And I guess all that charming,
nervous stuff seems to work somehow...

869
00:58:59,438 --> 00:59:03,305
because we get
back to her house and...

870
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,725
Throw my suitcase out there too

871
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:07,895
it just happens.

872
00:59:10,616 --> 00:59:14,530
- Throw my covers out the door
- And then we make love. It's great.

873
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:17,952
- I don't need them any more
- And that's it. I'm not gonna go
into all that other stuff.

874
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,078
You know, the
who-did-what-to-whom stuff.

875
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:23,083
You know that song
"Behind Closed Doors" by Charlie Rich?

876
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:25,920
It's one of my favorite songs.

877
00:59:26,004 --> 00:59:30,084
- I can say we had a good time.
I can say that.
- Should I have left this town

878
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,582
Marie's a terrific woman.

879
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:35,843
But it was more than I could do

880
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:39,380
And then in the morning...

881
00:59:39,474 --> 00:59:42,226
You didn't have me fooled...

882
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:47,980
acting all cool
about, um, what's-her-name.

883
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:52,857
- Laura.
- Laura, right, right. Laura.

884
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,196
- What was yours called again?
- It was called James.

885
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:01,276
- James.
- James.

886
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:03,906
Do you miss him?

887
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:09,707
Yeah. That's how it works, right?

888
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,372
I think it's okay if you feel horny
and fucked up at the same time.

889
01:00:15,465 --> 01:00:17,623
I mean, why should we be denied
our basic human rights...

890
01:00:17,717 --> 01:00:20,883
just 'cause we messed up
our relationships?

891
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:22,962
You think sex
is a basic human right?

892
01:00:23,055 --> 01:00:25,842
Hell, yeah! Yeah.

893
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:31,894
I'm not gonna let that asshole
come between me and a fuck.

894
01:00:34,857 --> 01:00:38,439
- Which way are you going?
- That way. You?

895
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,017
- That way.
- Ah, so it is.

896
01:00:46,492 --> 01:00:49,695
- Talk to ya.
- I'll call you.

897
01:00:51,037 --> 01:00:53,528
Right.

898
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,034
What did Laura mean last night when she
said, "I haven't slept with him yet"?

899
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:03,295
Yet! What does "yet" mean anyway?

900
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:06,832
It means you're gonna do it,
doesn't it? Or does it?

901
01:01:06,926 --> 01:01:09,843
Just come on. What would it mean
to you, that sentence:

902
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:12,716
"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet"?

903
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:15,641
Well, to me it would mean that
you're a liar. You've seen it twice.

904
01:01:15,726 --> 01:01:18,810
Once with Laura... oops...
and once with me and Dick, remember?

905
01:01:18,895 --> 01:01:22,844
We had that conversation about
the guy making Beretta shotgun ammo
off-screen in the 14th century.

906
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:25,017
Right. All right, but let's
just say that I hadn't seen it...

907
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,525
and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil
Dead II yet," what would you think?

908
01:01:28,613 --> 01:01:32,231
I'd think that you're a cinematic idiot,
and I'd feel sorry for you.

909
01:01:32,324 --> 01:01:37,531
All right. But from that one sentence,
would you think that
I was going to see it?

910
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:39,613
I'm sorry, Rob.
I'm struggling here.

911
01:01:39,706 --> 01:01:42,493
You're asking me
what would I think if you told me...

912
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:44,872
you hadn't seen a film
that you have already seen.

913
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,036
- What am I supposed to say?
- Just listen to me. If I said to you...

914
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:50,663
"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yes.

915
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:53,046
Would you get the impression
that I really wanted to see it?

916
01:01:53,134 --> 01:01:55,541
Oh, uh, well...

917
01:01:55,636 --> 01:01:58,921
you couldn't have been desperate to see
it, otherwise you'd have already gone.

918
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:01,256
Right. I'm not gonna see that movie.

919
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:09,146
But the word "yet."
Yeah, you know what?

920
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:11,687
I get the impression
that you wanted to see it...

921
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:15,274
otherwise you'd have said
you didn't want to go.

922
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:17,354
But in your opinion,
would I definitely go?

923
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:20,068
How the fuck am I supposed
to know? Probably.

924
01:02:20,158 --> 01:02:22,613
- Why?
- Because it's a brilliant film.

925
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:27,493
It's so funny and violent,
and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

926
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:32,493
I never thought I'd say this,
but can I go work now?

927
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:35,836
Look, Laura, if you don't
want me to call you at work,
then give me your home number.

928
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:37,915
Oh, I forgot. You can't.

929
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:41,376
I'm not gonna get off this phone
until you agree to meet me for a drink.

930
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:43,876
I mean, I'm sorry, but I don't just see
why this has to be on your terms...

931
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:45,430
- all the time.
- Okay.

932
01:02:45,514 --> 01:02:49,048
- I mean, really.
- Okay! Okay. We'll meet then tonight.

933
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,890
That'd... That'd be great if you're
not too busy. It'll be really good to...

934
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:54,639
see you.

935
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,984
So how are you?

936
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,116
Have you slept with him yet?

937
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:18,996
- Is that why you wanted to see me?
- I guess.

938
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,412
What do you want me to say?

939
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:29,091
I want you to say you haven't,
and I want that to be the truth.

940
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,678
I can't do that.

941
01:03:57,327 --> 01:04:01,621
Say a word for Jimmy Brown

942
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:06,825
He ain't got nothin'at all

943
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:15,542
You must have known it would happen.
You couldn't have been
entirely unprepared.

944
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:20,592
Like you said, I've been living
with the guy. We were bound
to get around to it sometime.

945
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:25,889
Rob, are you there?
What are you thinking?

946
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:31,476
We can meet for another drink
if you want.

947
01:04:31,566 --> 01:04:34,103
So I can explain it better.
I owe you that much.

948
01:04:34,193 --> 01:04:36,481
I don't have your number.

949
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:39,855
You know, I don't want this to be
the last conversation we have.
I know what you're like.

950
01:04:39,948 --> 01:04:41,525
You do, huh?

951
01:04:47,414 --> 01:04:49,702
I need a second opinion.

952
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,335
Hi, this is Tim.
City and state, please.

953
01:04:57,422 --> 01:05:01,087
Uh, Chicago. A residence.
Mr Ian Raymond.

954
01:05:01,176 --> 01:05:03,168
- Please hold for that number.
- May I also have that address?

955
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:05,170
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

956
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:43,251
- Rob?
- Laura, I just want to say something.

957
01:05:43,337 --> 01:05:46,836
I think you're running.
You're running from a, a sharp point...

958
01:05:46,925 --> 01:05:50,293
that anybody hits in any relationship,
and it's just gonna happen again.

959
01:05:50,386 --> 01:05:54,004
But it's gonna be with this guy
Ian, later, when you're older.

960
01:05:54,098 --> 01:05:56,671
All right? With a guy
with a Steven Seagal ponytail.

961
01:05:56,767 --> 01:06:00,811
You know what I'm saying?
And-And he doesn't love you.

962
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:03,433
And he doesn't understand you,
not the way I will.

963
01:06:03,522 --> 01:06:06,973
And I will even more so
in the future. And...

964
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:14,613
I mean, if you want
to experiment or whatever...

965
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:17,368
I'm not experimenting.
Why don't you go experiment?

966
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:20,820
- Laura, are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

967
01:06:20,913 --> 01:06:26,618
- Is that him?
- Look, can you... Can you call me
at work? I gotta go now.

968
01:06:28,628 --> 01:06:31,628
- You look upset.
- Yeah, I'm... I'm upset...

969
01:06:31,714 --> 01:06:33,706
but I'm fine.

970
01:06:33,799 --> 01:06:36,965
- Maybe I should talk to him.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.

971
01:06:37,052 --> 01:06:39,969
- Conflict resolution is my job.
- Yeah, I know.

972
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:43,589
But... But, Ian, there's really
nothing to resolve, but thank you.

973
01:06:48,687 --> 01:06:52,766
You have got to stop calling her.
You're really upsetting her and him!

974
01:06:52,857 --> 01:06:55,526
- Like I care about him.
- Well, you should.

975
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:59,904
- Why?
- Because all you're doing is forming
a little unit. Them against you!

976
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:03,488
Before you started all this
psychotic madness, there was no unit.

977
01:07:03,576 --> 01:07:05,698
There was just
three people in a mess.

978
01:07:05,786 --> 01:07:08,905
But now they've got
something in common.

979
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:10,989
And you don't want
to make anything worse.

980
01:07:11,082 --> 01:07:13,205
How could it get any worse
than Laura with Ian?

981
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:16,459
- Come on, Liz.
- Rob, Rob, Rob.

982
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:19,996
Can I ask you a question? And you can
think about it if you want to.

983
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,759
Just what is it?

984
01:07:22,842 --> 01:07:25,713
Why do you want Laura back
so badly?

985
01:07:30,808 --> 01:07:32,385
Rob, phone.

986
01:07:32,476 --> 01:07:36,058
I was walking on the water
when I saw a crocodile

987
01:07:36,146 --> 01:07:39,645
Barry, that fucking pricer's busted,
and I'm not the one who broke it.

988
01:07:39,732 --> 01:07:41,310
- Hello.
- Rob?

989
01:07:44,695 --> 01:07:46,687
Who is this?

990
01:07:48,823 --> 01:07:50,816
Is this Ch... Is this Charlie?

991
01:07:54,328 --> 01:07:56,404
Hi. I just got back into town.

992
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,622
Wow! Rob Gordon. The Rob Gordon.

993
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:05,494
So how are you doing? Huh?
Does it seem like millions of years ago?

994
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:09,456
Yeah, yeah.
Like a billion, right?

995
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:13,050
So, uh... God, Charlie Nicholson.
How are you?

996
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:16,387
I mean, do you have kids
and stuff like everybody else?

997
01:08:16,473 --> 01:08:20,257
No. No, I'm too young,
too single. I don't know.

998
01:08:20,352 --> 01:08:24,183
Kids are too time-consuming, I guess,
is the expression I'm looking for.

999
01:08:24,272 --> 01:08:26,513
I'm not making this up. This is how
she talks... as if nobody ever had...

1000
01:08:26,607 --> 01:08:29,524
a conversation about having kids
in the entire history of the world.

1001
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,187
She's incredible.

1002
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:35,275
So, anyway,
are you in or out, Rob?

1003
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:37,523
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you know... I don't know.

1004
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:40,487
I just find these long-lost
boyfriend calls a little unnerving.

1005
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:43,364
- There's been a rash of them recently.
- Is that right?

1006
01:08:43,455 --> 01:08:48,911
Yeah. Oh, remember Marco?
I went out with him after you.

1007
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:51,374
- Kind of.
- Kind of, yeah.

1008
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:53,787
Well, he called
a few months ago.

1009
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:57,047
I think he was
going through one of those
what-does-it-all-mean kind of things.

1010
01:08:57,134 --> 01:09:00,419
He wanted to see me
and "rehash the past,"as they say.

1011
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:05,718
God. Was I up for that? No. No.
So... I don't know...

1012
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,141
- Do all men go through that?
- I've never heard of it before.

1013
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:12,514
I'm sorry, Charlie, but what
does "Are you in or out" mean?

1014
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,393
Well, it means,
are we friends or aren't we?

1015
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,188
Because if we are,
that's great. That's great.

1016
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:22,358
But if we're not,
I don't really want to spend time
playing catch-up on the phone.

1017
01:09:22,448 --> 01:09:25,117
You know what I mean?
I'm just really busy, you know?

1018
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:27,774
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure. Of course.

1019
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:31,285
- So, are you in or out, Rob?
- I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

1020
01:09:31,373 --> 01:09:36,165
Oh, yeah? Great. Do you want to come
for a dinner party tomorrow night?

1021
01:09:38,796 --> 01:09:43,541
Have you ever watched a moonbeam

1022
01:09:43,634 --> 01:09:45,460
Can I help you?

1023
01:09:45,552 --> 01:09:49,845
- As it slid across your windowpane
- Hello, Rob.

1024
01:09:49,931 --> 01:09:54,888
Remember me? Ray. Ian.

1025
01:09:56,311 --> 01:09:59,596
I thought maybe we should talk.
You know, sort things out.

1026
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:02,690
- What needs sorting out?
- Ten phone calls a night.

1027
01:10:02,775 --> 01:10:05,941
Hanging around outside my house.

1028
01:10:06,028 --> 01:10:10,072
- I've stopped all of that now.
- You were there this morning.

1029
01:10:13,369 --> 01:10:18,908
Obviously, I know how special
Laura is, and I know how...

1030
01:10:18,999 --> 01:10:23,327
much pain you must be
going through right now.

1031
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,708
I would hate it if I lost her.

1032
01:10:25,796 --> 01:10:29,461
Oh. Guess who?

1033
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:33,048
But I'd like to believe
that if she decided...

1034
01:10:33,136 --> 01:10:35,294
that she didn't want
to see me any more that...

1035
01:10:35,388 --> 01:10:37,961
I would respect those wishes.

1036
01:10:38,057 --> 01:10:40,844
You know what I'm saying, G?

1037
01:10:40,934 --> 01:10:42,927
- Yeah.
- Good.

1038
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:45,059
So shall we leave it
at that then?

1039
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:49,274
I've already left it,
you pathetic rebound fuck!

1040
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:53,854
Now, get your patchouli stink
out of my store!

1041
01:10:53,946 --> 01:10:56,021
Move it, lard-ass!

1042
01:10:57,449 --> 01:10:59,524
Dumb motherfucker.

1043
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:02,534
So, um, shall we
leave it at that then?

1044
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:05,823
- Tsk. No.
- Don't! Don't!

1045
01:11:05,914 --> 01:11:07,907
- He's not worth it!
- Leave town!

1046
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,537
Leave the country!
You little bitch!

1047
01:11:10,627 --> 01:11:15,418
'Cause you'll look back at ten
phone calls a night as the golden age!

1048
01:11:15,506 --> 01:11:17,545
Get ready, motherfucker!

1049
01:11:17,633 --> 01:11:20,088
So shall we leave it
at that then?

1050
01:11:24,682 --> 01:11:26,721
Get him!

1051
01:11:36,817 --> 01:11:40,731
- Come on! Get him!
- Get him, man!

1052
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:45,032
- Have you ever watched a moonbeam
- Well, think about it, Rob.

1053
01:11:45,116 --> 01:11:47,523
Okay?

1054
01:11:47,618 --> 01:11:53,241
As it slid across
your windowpane

1055
01:12:10,054 --> 01:12:12,628
Hey, jelly bean.

1056
01:12:12,723 --> 01:12:14,716
Charles.

1057
01:12:16,018 --> 01:12:18,722
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

1058
01:12:20,105 --> 01:12:22,726
Actually, it's hilarious.
It's hilarious.

1059
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:26,266
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, this is Rob.

1060
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,685
Rob, this is everybody.

1061
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,772
- Hi.
- Hi.

1062
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:33,107
- Come on in. Make yourself at home.
Is that for me?
- Yeah.

1063
01:12:33,201 --> 01:12:35,572
- Oh, it's a little warm.
I'll put it in the fridge.
- I think if you get a dog...

1064
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:38,282
- you've got to raise it yourself.
- Your place doesn't have a yard,
does it?

1065
01:12:38,372 --> 01:12:41,787
- You got to deal with a dog
from day one.
- Of course you do.

1066
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:45,160
- You gotta take care of it,
raise it...
- Yeah, but...

1067
01:12:45,253 --> 01:12:47,625
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, I would.

1068
01:12:47,713 --> 01:12:50,204
I can see now
that I'm doomed to die...

1069
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:55,637
a long, slow suffocating death,
and I try to figure out why.

1070
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,840
Of course there's envy.
Why isn't my life like this?

1071
01:12:58,931 --> 01:13:03,427
Sure, I want their money and
clothes and jobs and opinions.

1072
01:13:03,519 --> 01:13:06,056
And I'd like to have advice
on jet lag, but that's not it.

1073
01:13:06,146 --> 01:13:09,100
I mean, they're not bad people,
and I'm not a class warrior.
It's something else.

1074
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:13,139
- I never did. I never did.
And I was very supportive...
- And then it dawned on me.

1075
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:16,319
- It came down to me
to tell him the truth.
- Charlie's awful.

1076
01:13:16,405 --> 01:13:18,231
What was the truth?

1077
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:21,774
- She doesn't listen to anyone.
She says terrible, stupid things...
- No. Well, I have...

1078
01:13:21,868 --> 01:13:24,323
- and she apparently has
no sense of humor at all...
- You're right. I have to talk...

1079
01:13:24,412 --> 01:13:27,412
and talks shit all night long.

1080
01:13:27,498 --> 01:13:30,617
- Come here, you. Oh, I love you.
- Bye-bye.
- Maybe she's been like this all along.

1081
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:32,333
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye-bye.

1082
01:13:32,419 --> 01:13:34,079
- Call me tomorrow, okay?
- Thanks for having us.

1083
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:37,255
Call me.
Promise to call me. Bye.

1084
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,842
How did I manage
to edit all this out?

1085
01:13:44,931 --> 01:13:49,841
How had I made this girl
the answer to all the world's problems?

1086
01:13:49,935 --> 01:13:52,260
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Rob.

1087
01:13:57,942 --> 01:14:01,192
So, Charlie, why'd you
dump me for Marco?

1088
01:14:01,278 --> 01:14:04,444
Fuck! I knew it! I knew it!

1089
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:08,231
I knew it! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1090
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:10,567
- What?
- You are. You are going through...

1091
01:14:10,661 --> 01:14:13,697
one of those
what-does-it-all-mean things.

1092
01:14:13,789 --> 01:14:18,783
- I can't believe you, Rob.
- Yes, I am. Very much. Indeed so.

1093
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:22,921
- Oh, God.
- Come on. Answer the question.

1094
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:26,504
Oh, come on, Charlie.
Don't hold back.

1095
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:28,715
You can say whatever you like.

1096
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:31,257
Why'd you dump me for Marco?

1097
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:37,218
Marco just seemed to be
a bit more glamorous.

1098
01:14:37,309 --> 01:14:40,892
You know?
More sure of himself.

1099
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:43,766
Less hard work.

1100
01:14:45,192 --> 01:14:48,940
A little sunnier.

1101
01:14:49,029 --> 01:14:50,772
Sparkier.

1102
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,782
Through the park
Make love along the way

1103
01:14:56,869 --> 01:15:00,072
- In Mendocino
- You put that ad up?

1104
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:02,868
- Yeah.
- What can you play?

1105
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:06,741
Nothin'.
What kind of stuff are you into?

1106
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,994
The kind of stuff you mentioned.

1107
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,377
But we want to be
more experimental than that.

1108
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:16,257
We want to retain
our pop sensibilities, but, kind of,
you know, go a little further out.

1109
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,384
- That sounds great.
- No gigs yet.

1110
01:15:18,471 --> 01:15:22,800
We just got together.
Is Tuesday night cool for you?

1111
01:15:22,892 --> 01:15:26,426
- We'll just, you know...
- What I have told you

1112
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,355
- jam.
- Yeah.
- Can you dig it

1113
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,930
All right.

1114
01:15:33,318 --> 01:15:34,977
Later.

1115
01:15:42,617 --> 01:15:44,906
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

1116
01:15:44,994 --> 01:15:47,200
You've had that poster
up on the wall for, like, 17,000 years.

1117
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:50,574
And then some guy comes in off the
street. You act like it's no big deal.

1118
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:52,825
It's just a garage band.
It's nothing special.

1119
01:15:52,919 --> 01:15:55,457
- Barry, you don't
even play an instrument.
- I can sing.

1120
01:15:55,546 --> 01:15:58,500
What, you think I'm gonna stick
around here the rest of my life?

1121
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:01,876
Hey, it's half past
a monkey's ass. Let's go.

1122
01:16:01,968 --> 01:16:04,755
Oh, I can't, um, meet you guys
at the club tonight.

1123
01:16:04,846 --> 01:16:08,594
- That's the way it is in Mendocino
- Why?

1124
01:16:08,683 --> 01:16:11,054
- Who are you going to see?
- Mendocino
- Nobody.

1125
01:16:11,143 --> 01:16:15,223
- Rob! Lookie, lookie!
Dick, are you getting some?
- Mendocino

1126
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:19,014
Un-fucking-believable!

1127
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:21,433
Dick's got a hot date!
How did this happen, Dick?

1128
01:16:21,527 --> 01:16:25,145
What rational explanation can there
possibly be? What's her name?

1129
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:28,572
- Anaugh.
- Anaugh? Anaugh Conda?

1130
01:16:28,658 --> 01:16:31,196
- Anaugh Moss.
- Anaugh Moss?

1131
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:34,203
Is she all green
and fuzzy and mossy?

1132
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:36,826
And you met this bruiser
where exactly?

1133
01:16:36,915 --> 01:16:39,406
The home for the mentally challenged
or the blind or the bus station?

1134
01:16:39,501 --> 01:16:42,751
Um, here. She asked me about
the, uh, new Green Day album...

1135
01:16:42,837 --> 01:16:46,704
- and then I told her...
- Oh, man! Finally! Anaugh.

1136
01:16:46,799 --> 01:16:50,631
That's great, Dick!
Really, smoke that ass.

1137
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,711
Listen, Rob, I can't
go to the club either.

1138
01:16:52,804 --> 01:16:55,295
I gotta get some lyrics
down on paper.

1139
01:16:55,391 --> 01:17:00,017
Oh, yeah, me too.
Well, not, uh, lyrics to get down.

1140
01:17:00,103 --> 01:17:04,646
But, um, uh...
So I'll see you, um, tomorrow.

1141
01:17:48,854 --> 01:17:51,558
- Hi, Laura.
- "Top five dream jobs."

1142
01:17:51,648 --> 01:17:53,356
- Hey, that's private.
- "Number one:

1143
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:58,233
"Journalist for Rolling Stone
magazine, 1976 to 1979.

1144
01:17:58,321 --> 01:18:01,819
"Get to meet the Clash, Chrissie Hynde,
Sex Pistols, David Byrne.

1145
01:18:01,908 --> 01:18:05,359
"Get tons of free records.
Number two:

1146
01:18:05,453 --> 01:18:09,782
"Producer, Atlantic Records,
1964 to 1971.

1147
01:18:09,873 --> 01:18:12,329
Get to meet Aretha,
Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke."

1148
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:15,122
- More free records.
- "More free records
and a shitload of money."

1149
01:18:15,211 --> 01:18:17,369
- Yeah.
- "Number three: Any kind of musician."

1150
01:18:17,463 --> 01:18:19,372
Besides classical or rap.

1151
01:18:19,465 --> 01:18:21,753
- "Settle for being one
of the Memphis Horns or something."
- Sure.

1152
01:18:21,842 --> 01:18:25,970
- "I'm not asking to be Jagger
or Hendrix or Otis Redding."
- Uh-huh.

1153
01:18:26,054 --> 01:18:30,265
- "Number four: Film director."
- Any kind except German or silent.

1154
01:18:30,349 --> 01:18:33,385
And number five,
we have "architect."

1155
01:18:33,477 --> 01:18:36,680
- Yeah.
- Seven years' training.

1156
01:18:36,772 --> 01:18:39,642
- I'm not sure I even
want to be an architect.
- So you've got a list here...

1157
01:18:39,733 --> 01:18:42,140
of five things you'd do
if qualifications...

1158
01:18:42,235 --> 01:18:44,904
and time and history
and salary were no object?

1159
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:47,193
- Yeah.
- One of them you don't
really want to do anyway.

1160
01:18:47,281 --> 01:18:49,403
Well, I did put it
at number five.

1161
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,029
Wouldn't you rather own your
own record store than be an architect?

1162
01:18:52,118 --> 01:18:54,609
- Yeah, I suppose.
- And you wouldn't want to be a...

1163
01:18:54,704 --> 01:18:57,907
16th-century explorer
or the king of France or...

1164
01:18:57,998 --> 01:19:00,038
- God, no.
- All right. There you go then.

1165
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:04,169
Dream job number five:
Record store owner.

1166
01:19:12,304 --> 01:19:16,217
I find it interesting that you
keep showing up here, Laura.

1167
01:19:16,307 --> 01:19:19,094
Well, this is the last of it.

1168
01:19:19,185 --> 01:19:22,102
Those bags look heavy.
Where's Ian?

1169
01:19:22,187 --> 01:19:26,647
Or Ray or...
What is his fucking name anyway?

1170
01:19:26,733 --> 01:19:29,484
- What do you call him? Ian or Ray?
- Ray.

1171
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:33,317
- I hate Ian.
- I hate him too.

1172
01:19:33,405 --> 01:19:36,738
Yeah, I'm sure.

1173
01:19:36,825 --> 01:19:38,817
See ya.

1174
01:19:40,078 --> 01:19:42,070
Goodbye.

1175
01:19:53,172 --> 01:19:55,212
Top five things
I miss about Laura.

1176
01:19:55,299 --> 01:19:58,999
One: Sense of humor. Very dry,
but it can also be warm and forgiving.

1177
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:02,510
And she's got one
of the best all-time laughs
in the history of all-time laughs.

1178
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,432
She laughs with her entire body.

1179
01:20:05,516 --> 01:20:08,185
Two: She's got character.

1180
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:11,056
Or at least she had character
before the Ian nightmare.

1181
01:20:11,146 --> 01:20:13,186
She's loyal and honest and...

1182
01:20:13,274 --> 01:20:16,275
she doesn't even take it out on people
when she's having a bad day.

1183
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,933
That's character.

1184
01:20:19,029 --> 01:20:21,235
Three:

1185
01:20:24,284 --> 01:20:27,403
I miss her smell...

1186
01:20:27,495 --> 01:20:30,579
and the way she tastes.

1187
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:32,657
It's a mystery of human chemistry,
and I don't understand it.

1188
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:38,668
Some people, as far as your senses
are concerned, just feel like home.

1189
01:20:43,884 --> 01:20:46,339
I really dig
how she walks around.

1190
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:48,634
It's like she doesn't care how
she looks or what she projects.

1191
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:54,095
And it's not that she doesn't care,
it's just... She's not affected, I guess.

1192
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:56,758
And that gives her grace.

1193
01:20:56,854 --> 01:20:59,771
And five: She does this thing in bed
when she can't get to sleep.

1194
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:03,059
She kind of half-moans and then rubs her
feet together an equal number of times.

1195
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:07,018
It just kills me.

1196
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:09,568
Believe me, I mean,
I could do a top-five-things
about her that drive me crazy...

1197
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:12,859
but it's just your garden variety
women, you know, schizo stuff...

1198
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:16,699
and that's the kind of thinking
that got me here.

1199
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:24,952
- Look out!
- Damn! You maggots!

1200
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,085
Whoa, whoa! Toss it, man!

1201
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:30,090
- You're pretty when you're angry.
- Shit!

1202
01:21:34,012 --> 01:21:36,847
- Hey, Rob, Laura called.
- Really?

1203
01:21:36,931 --> 01:21:40,975
What you gonna do

1204
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:45,721
The man's gone out to get you

1205
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:48,731
How you gonna know

1206
01:21:48,817 --> 01:21:51,901
- What is this?
- It's Vince and Justin.

1207
01:21:51,986 --> 01:21:54,773
- Who's Vince and Justin?
- It's those little skate fuckers.

1208
01:21:54,864 --> 01:21:57,437
- No way.
- Way.

1209
01:21:57,533 --> 01:22:00,367
It's really...

1210
01:22:01,703 --> 01:22:04,158
It's really fuckin' good.

1211
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:11,704
Hey, do you guys know Vince and Justin,
the guys that come in my store?

1212
01:22:11,795 --> 01:22:14,333
- Yeah, they're right over there, man.
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1213
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:18,502
- Quit smoking. I'm telling you should...
- Hey! Your tape.

1214
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:22,127
- It's good.
- I know. We made it.
- It's all right. Thank you.

1215
01:22:22,221 --> 01:22:26,134
I mean, it's rough, but,
unbelievably, it shows promise.

1216
01:22:26,224 --> 01:22:28,715
I'll put out your record.

1217
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:31,728
Any profits we split down the middle
after I recoup expenses, okay?

1218
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:36,226
Recoup expenses?
Man, you're gonna recoup a big,
fat Mercedes is what you're gonna do.

1219
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:38,310
- We're not there yet, Justin.
- I'm Vince.

1220
01:22:38,402 --> 01:22:41,320
Whatever.
What's the name of your band?

1221
01:22:41,405 --> 01:22:43,647
- Uh, the Kinky Wizards.
- Nice.

1222
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,863
What's the name of your label?

1223
01:22:45,951 --> 01:22:48,073
Top Five Records.

1224
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:51,197
What was that? You just told them
you're gonna put out a record with them?

1225
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:54,159
Yeah. So what?
You said yourself those guys were good.
What are you getting hot about?

1226
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,950
Well, it just seems
that you think it would be wiser
to start a record label...

1227
01:22:58,044 --> 01:23:01,460
by putting out a record
with business-crippling
Nazi youth shoplifters...

1228
01:23:01,548 --> 01:23:04,833
than with someone you know
in your bitter, jealous heart
is a musical visionary, that's all.

1229
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:08,009
Yeah, what do your songs sound like?
Sex Pistols? Nirvana?
Pop Abrams and the Smurfs?

1230
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:10,586
You know what? You wouldn't be familiar
with our immediate influences.

1231
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,974
- Try me.
- They're mostly German.
- Kraftwerk? Falco? Hasselhoff?

1232
01:23:15,059 --> 01:23:17,052
Hey. You called?

1233
01:23:20,105 --> 01:23:22,145
Fuckin' asshole.

1234
01:23:23,984 --> 01:23:28,063
- Laura, are you all right?
- My dad...

1235
01:23:28,154 --> 01:23:31,653
My dad died.

1236
01:23:40,124 --> 01:23:43,623
- What's up?
- Laura's dad died.

1237
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:45,703
Oh, drag.

1238
01:23:47,672 --> 01:23:49,463
I'm sorry, Rob.

1239
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:55,844
Hey, top five songs about death.

1240
01:23:55,929 --> 01:23:58,550
A Laura's dad tribute list.

1241
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,174
Okay? Okay.

1242
01:24:02,268 --> 01:24:04,593
"Leader Of The Pack."

1243
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:08,269
The guy fuckin' beefs it
on his motorcycle and dies, right?

1244
01:24:08,357 --> 01:24:10,598
"Dead Man's Curve."
Jan and Dean.

1245
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:14,440
Do you know that right after
they recorded that song,
Jan himself, um, crashed his...

1246
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:16,521
- It was Dean, you fuckin' idiot.
- It was Jan.

1247
01:24:16,614 --> 01:24:19,105
- It was a long time after the song...
- Okay, whatever.

1248
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,986
"Tell Laura I Love Her."
That would bring the house down.

1249
01:24:22,077 --> 01:24:24,650
Laura's mom could sing it.

1250
01:24:24,746 --> 01:24:26,738
- You know what I'd want?
- Huh?

1251
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:29,452
"One Step Beyond" by Madness.

1252
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:32,376
No, no, no, no, no.
Wh-When are you going home?

1253
01:24:32,461 --> 01:24:35,711
In a minute,
when I get it together.

1254
01:24:35,797 --> 01:24:37,955
And, uh, "You Can't
Always Get What You Want."

1255
01:24:38,049 --> 01:24:41,749
No, immediate disqualification because
of its involvement with The Big Chill.

1256
01:24:41,845 --> 01:24:43,505
Oh, God, you're right.

1257
01:24:43,597 --> 01:24:47,012
Um, Mom wants you
to come to the funeral.

1258
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:51,595
- Oh. Me?
- Yeah, 'cause my dad
really liked you, and...

1259
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:55,020
Mom never told him we'd split,
because he wasn't up to it.

1260
01:24:55,107 --> 01:24:57,229
"Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald."
Uh, Gordon Lightfoot.

1261
01:24:57,317 --> 01:24:59,724
Bastard. That's so good.
That should have been mine.

1262
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:02,440
Do you, uh...
Do you want me there?

1263
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,483
I don't care, as long as you don't
expect me to hold your hand.

1264
01:25:05,574 --> 01:25:08,528
- Is Ray going?
- No!

1265
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:13,949
The night Laura's daddy died

1266
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,455
Sha-na-na, na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na

1267
01:25:17,543 --> 01:25:19,120
Brother, what a night
it really was

1268
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:21,915
Mother, what a night it really...
Angina's tough

1269
01:25:22,005 --> 01:25:23,997
Glory be

1270
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:26,082
Brother, what a night
it really was

1271
01:25:26,175 --> 01:25:29,674
Brother, what a night
Angina's tough...

1272
01:25:29,762 --> 01:25:34,304
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

1273
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:38,174
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

1274
01:25:38,269 --> 01:25:40,760
- on Earth as it is in heaven.
- Songs at my funeral:

1275
01:25:40,855 --> 01:25:43,428
- Bless this day...
- "Many Rivers To Cross" by Jimmy Cliff.

1276
01:25:43,524 --> 01:25:45,516
"Angel" by Aretha Franklin...

1277
01:25:45,609 --> 01:25:49,688
and I've always had
this fantasy that some beautiful,
tearful woman will insist on...

1278
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:53,445
"You're The Best Thing That Ever
Happened To Me" by Gladys Knight.

1279
01:25:53,533 --> 01:25:57,233
- But who would that woman be?
- Amen.

1280
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:31,848
- Hey, Jo.
- Hi, Liz.
- Hey.

1281
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:35,357
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right, I suppose.

1282
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:39,524
Mom's not too bad.
But Laura... I don't know.

1283
01:26:39,615 --> 01:26:43,944
Yeah, well, she's had a rough time
of it already without this.

1284
01:26:44,036 --> 01:26:47,653
It's just so hard
when you put all of your efforts
into one area of your life...

1285
01:26:47,747 --> 01:26:51,447
and it doesn't work out.

1286
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:55,290
Don't mind me. Really. It's no problem.
Just pretend like you're talking
about someone else. It's okay.

1287
01:26:55,380 --> 01:27:01,500
Well, in fact, we are talking about
someone else. We're talking about Laura.

1288
01:27:01,594 --> 01:27:03,835
- Oh.
- Oh?

1289
01:27:03,929 --> 01:27:06,217
Don't fuckin' say "oh"
like that to me, Liz.

1290
01:27:06,306 --> 01:27:09,390
I'm really sorry, Jo. Look,
I can either stick up for myself...

1291
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:12,144
or I can believe everything you say
about me and end up hating myself.

1292
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,220
But that's not
much of a life, is it? Huh?

1293
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:17,978
- I mean...
- Do you think this is really
the time to be talking about...

1294
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:21,316
Just because it's never the time, Liz?
I can't go on apologizing my whole life.

1295
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,107
I think just the once would do!

1296
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:32,492
- I'm very sorry, Laura.
- Thanks for coming.

1297
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:34,951
I'm so sorry, Laura.

1298
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:38,620
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1299
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:42,042
Laura, I'm sorry.

1300
01:28:01,146 --> 01:28:03,139
Most of the time

1301
01:28:05,066 --> 01:28:07,771
I'm clear-focused all around

1302
01:28:07,861 --> 01:28:10,980
Most of the time

1303
01:28:11,072 --> 01:28:14,440
I can keep both feet on the ground

1304
01:28:15,576 --> 01:28:18,778
I can follow the path

1305
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:22,286
I can read the sign

1306
01:28:22,373 --> 01:28:27,497
Stay right with it
when the road unwinds

1307
01:28:27,586 --> 01:28:30,587
I can handle whatever

1308
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:34,087
I stumble upon

1309
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:38,967
I don't even notice she's gone

1310
01:28:39,054 --> 01:28:42,672
- I can see now I never
really committed to Laura.
- Most of the time

1311
01:28:42,766 --> 01:28:45,932
I always had one foot
out the door...

1312
01:28:46,019 --> 01:28:48,688
and that prevented me
from doing a lot of things...

1313
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:52,021
like thinking
about my future and...

1314
01:28:52,107 --> 01:28:55,807
- I guess it made more sense
to commit to nothing.
- Most of the time

1315
01:28:55,902 --> 01:28:59,650
- Keep my options open.
- It's well understood

1316
01:28:59,739 --> 01:29:02,027
- And that's suicide.
- Most of the time

1317
01:29:04,285 --> 01:29:07,618
- By tiny, tiny increments.
- I wouldn't change it if I could

1318
01:29:07,705 --> 01:29:11,405
I can make it all match up

1319
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,501
I can hold my own

1320
01:29:14,586 --> 01:29:17,955
I can deal with the situation

1321
01:29:18,048 --> 01:29:20,206
Right down to the bone

1322
01:29:20,299 --> 01:29:24,510
I can survive
and I can endure

1323
01:29:26,472 --> 01:29:30,255
Hell, I don't even think

1324
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:33,019
About her

1325
01:29:33,102 --> 01:29:34,845
Most of the time

1326
01:29:37,648 --> 01:29:41,313
Are you gonna lie
in that flower bed all night?

1327
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,489
No.

1328
01:29:47,573 --> 01:29:50,574
- You're soaking.
- Yeah.

1329
01:29:50,659 --> 01:29:52,450
You're also an idiot.

1330
01:29:55,747 --> 01:30:00,408
- Look, Laura, I'm really sorry.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

1331
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:03,371
Why don't you just get back, and
I'm just gonna wait here for the bus.

1332
01:30:03,462 --> 01:30:07,590
No, I don't want to be there.
When I saw you leave,
I used it as an excuse to get out.

1333
01:30:10,927 --> 01:30:13,927
- Is there anything I can do?
- Come on.

1334
01:30:14,014 --> 01:30:18,474
- Where?
- I'll show you. Let's go.

1335
01:30:18,559 --> 01:30:20,053
Right.

1336
01:30:33,364 --> 01:30:36,530
Dad used to bring us here
when we were kids.

1337
01:30:39,328 --> 01:30:42,910
Listen, Rob, would you
have sex with me?

1338
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,618
'Cause I want to feel
something else than this.

1339
01:30:49,712 --> 01:30:53,578
It's either that, or I go home
and put my hand in the fire.

1340
01:30:55,175 --> 01:30:59,421
Unless you want to stub
cigarettes out on my arm.

1341
01:30:59,512 --> 01:31:03,758
No. I only have a few left.
I've been saving them for later.

1342
01:31:03,849 --> 01:31:07,928
Right. It'll have to be sex then.

1343
01:31:08,019 --> 01:31:11,637
Right. Right.

1344
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:15,645
I knew there was a reason
I wore a skirt today.

1345
01:31:15,734 --> 01:31:19,731
- Just stay there.
- Okay.

1346
01:31:34,877 --> 01:31:37,368
- Hi.
- Hi.

1347
01:31:37,462 --> 01:31:41,958
It doesn't seem so long ago
that I looked at you from here.

1348
01:32:18,581 --> 01:32:21,499
Hey, go be with your mom.

1349
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:24,828
I'm too tired.

1350
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:28,205
I'm too tired
not to be with you.

1351
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:36,723
Well, so if you had a bit more energy,
we'd stay split up?

1352
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:41,551
But things being as they are,
with you being wiped out and all,
you wanna get back together?

1353
01:32:41,644 --> 01:32:45,179
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

1354
01:32:50,068 --> 01:32:52,689
What about Ian?

1355
01:32:52,779 --> 01:32:55,352
Well, Ray's a disaster.

1356
01:32:56,532 --> 01:32:58,571
Look...

1357
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:01,529
I, I know it's not
very romantic, Rob.

1358
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:05,949
But there will be romance again
at some stage, I'm sure. L...

1359
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:09,076
- I just...
- So that's it?

1360
01:33:09,168 --> 01:33:13,117
Well, you've made it clear
you want me back, so...

1361
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:16,878
Look, um, we can talk about it
later if-if you want to.

1362
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:20,051
Right now, l... I just...

1363
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:25,716
Right now, I just
want to go home with you.

1364
01:33:27,684 --> 01:33:29,593
Okay.

1365
01:33:29,686 --> 01:33:32,722
So, yeah.

1366
01:33:46,994 --> 01:33:51,038
And so we got back together,
and it was great.

1367
01:33:51,122 --> 01:33:53,411
She moved all her stuff back in,
all at once.

1368
01:33:53,499 --> 01:33:57,331
- So when exactly did you decide
to get back with me exactly?
- I'm not telling you.

1369
01:33:57,419 --> 01:34:02,164
- See, that's not... not a nice way
to play at all. That's not...
- The better you look

1370
01:34:02,257 --> 01:34:05,922
- We went out to dinner every night.
- The more I want you

1371
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:06,959
What else?

1372
01:34:07,053 --> 01:34:10,421
- When you turn on your smile
- We stayed in
and made love all the time.

1373
01:34:10,514 --> 01:34:14,132
- I feel my heart go wild
- We talked about the future.

1374
01:34:14,226 --> 01:34:17,392
- Important stuff. Issues.
- I'm like a child with

1375
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:20,265
- A brand new toy
- How can you like
Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?

1376
01:34:20,356 --> 01:34:22,763
That's like saying you support
the Israelis and the Palestinians.

1377
01:34:22,858 --> 01:34:25,349
No, it's not like saying
that at all actually, Rob.

1378
01:34:25,444 --> 01:34:27,650
Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel
make pop records.

1379
01:34:27,737 --> 01:34:30,228
Made. Made. Marvin Gaye's dead.
His father shot him.

1380
01:34:30,323 --> 01:34:35,743
You could say it was everything
I ever wanted really.

1381
01:34:35,828 --> 01:34:37,073
- Marvin Gaye!
- I know.

1382
01:34:37,162 --> 01:34:39,155
"Let's Get It On."
That's our song!

1383
01:34:39,248 --> 01:34:41,075
Marvin Gaye is responsible
for our entire relationship.

1384
01:34:41,167 --> 01:34:43,492
Oh, is that so?
I'd like a word with him then.

1385
01:34:43,586 --> 01:34:46,954
It was everything
I ever wanted...

1386
01:34:47,047 --> 01:34:50,000
except for some
fuckin' reason...

1387
01:34:52,301 --> 01:34:54,294
this...

1388
01:35:02,018 --> 01:35:04,224
Excuse me.
Is this Stereolab?

1389
01:35:05,563 --> 01:35:07,721
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1390
01:35:07,815 --> 01:35:10,140
I haven't heard this one.
It's really good.

1391
01:35:10,234 --> 01:35:12,606
Yeah, I know.

1392
01:35:13,612 --> 01:35:16,945
- Are you Bob?
- Rob.

1393
01:35:17,031 --> 01:35:19,948
Oh, right. Yeah, Rob.
You used to deejay.

1394
01:35:20,034 --> 01:35:23,118
I used to go to the Doubledoor
to hear you spin.

1395
01:35:23,203 --> 01:35:26,287
You were unbelievable.

1396
01:35:26,373 --> 01:35:28,910
- Really?
- I'm Caroline.

1397
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,992
Hi.

1398
01:35:31,085 --> 01:35:34,501
- What do you do?
- I work for the Reader.
I write a music column.

1399
01:35:34,588 --> 01:35:38,171
You're Caroline Fortis?
I read your column.

1400
01:35:38,258 --> 01:35:40,630
- It's great. You really know
what you're talking about.
- Thanks.

1401
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,960
- Rob, phone.
- Can you take a message?

1402
01:35:43,054 --> 01:35:45,130
It's your girlfriend.

1403
01:35:48,268 --> 01:35:50,260
Excuse me.

1404
01:35:56,316 --> 01:35:57,265
Hey.

1405
01:36:10,287 --> 01:36:12,991
Hey, what the fuck is this?

1406
01:36:14,374 --> 01:36:16,947
- Talk to your woman.
- It was her idea.

1407
01:36:17,043 --> 01:36:20,209
Crumbs busted
Pass the popcorn as I kick...

1408
01:36:20,296 --> 01:36:22,833
Laura!

1409
01:36:22,923 --> 01:36:24,714
"Dance music for old people"?

1410
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,500
It's an idea I had
when I was with, um, Ian...

1411
01:36:28,595 --> 01:36:32,805
and I thought it was such
a good one that I was really annoyed
we weren't together any more.

1412
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:34,966
- It may be why I came back.
- A record release party?

1413
01:36:35,058 --> 01:36:36,850
What if I was doing something
that can't be canceled?

1414
01:36:36,935 --> 01:36:39,508
- Rob, what are you ever doing
that can't be canceled?
- That's not the point!

1415
01:36:39,604 --> 01:36:43,436
- The single cannot be done in time.
I mean, there's a million things!
- It'll be done.

1416
01:36:43,524 --> 01:36:46,145
Oh, guess what.
Barry said his band will play a set.

1417
01:36:46,235 --> 01:36:49,438
Barry is playing at this thing?

1418
01:36:50,822 --> 01:36:55,033
Fucking, what are you...
Are you insane?

1419
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,692
- Barry, I'll give... I'll give you ten
percent of the door if you don't play.
- No!

1420
01:36:57,788 --> 01:36:59,946
Rob, we're getting that anyway.

1421
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:03,373
- Twenty. Twenty percent.
- No! Come on, Rob. We need the gig.

1422
01:37:03,459 --> 01:37:08,583
A hundred and ten percent.
That's how much it means to me
not to hear you play.

1423
01:37:08,672 --> 01:37:11,957
- Rob, we're called Sonic Death Monkey.
- Sonic Death Monkey?

1424
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:15,253
Yeah. And if Laura and
her bourgeois lawyer friends
can't handle it, fuck them.

1425
01:37:15,344 --> 01:37:19,472
Let 'em riot.
We're Sonic fucking Death Monkey.

1426
01:37:19,556 --> 01:37:23,139
Let me get this straight.
We made the CD with you.

1427
01:37:23,226 --> 01:37:28,303
Now your friends and
your girlfriend are throwing some kind
of celebration party or something...

1428
01:37:28,397 --> 01:37:31,102
and you're asking us
not to come to the party?

1429
01:37:31,192 --> 01:37:33,398
Exactly.

1430
01:37:33,485 --> 01:37:36,770
I don't know, dude.
That just seems kind of stupid.

1431
01:37:36,863 --> 01:37:41,441
It's just the whole thing
is just blown way out of proportion.

1432
01:37:41,534 --> 01:37:44,404
It's just a three-song CD.
It's a single.

1433
01:37:44,495 --> 01:37:46,820
It's just...
It's not a big deal.

1434
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:51,872
It's just that
you're making something.

1435
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,877
You, the critic,
the professional appreciator...

1436
01:37:54,962 --> 01:37:56,955
put something new into the world...

1437
01:37:57,047 --> 01:38:01,460
and the second
one of those things gets sold to
someone, you're officially a part of it.

1438
01:38:01,552 --> 01:38:03,877
Congratulations, Rob.

1439
01:38:07,057 --> 01:38:10,757
You know, I guess I think I've
always been a professional critic...

1440
01:38:10,852 --> 01:38:14,268
you know, or some sort of
professional appreciator or something.

1441
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:17,060
And I just wanted to,
you know, do something new...

1442
01:38:17,149 --> 01:38:19,142
put something new
out into the world...

1443
01:38:19,234 --> 01:38:21,108
you know, kind of really
put my money where my mouth is.

1444
01:38:21,194 --> 01:38:24,645
Yeah. Wow. I would... You know,
I would love to hear them.

1445
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:28,321
- Why don't I send it over to you
when it's, uh, done?
- Really?

1446
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:31,778
- I will look forward to that.
- I will look forward to sending it.

1447
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:35,073
- You know, we should
get back to the interview.
- Sure, yeah.

1448
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:40,621
Okay. What are your all-time
top five favorite records?

1449
01:38:42,171 --> 01:38:44,210
In a club or at home?

1450
01:38:44,298 --> 01:38:49,802
Listen. I'll tell you what.
Why don't I just make you a tape?

1451
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:56,543
Now, the making of a good compilation
tape is a very subtle art.

1452
01:38:56,638 --> 01:38:58,677
Many do's and don'ts.

1453
01:38:58,765 --> 01:39:01,884
First of all, you're using someone
else's poetry to express how you feel.

1454
01:39:01,976 --> 01:39:04,727
This is a delicate thing.

1455
01:39:04,811 --> 01:39:07,598
So, for this one, I'm thinking...

1456
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,392
I'm thinking...

1457
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:15,104
When is this gonna stop?

1458
01:39:15,197 --> 01:39:17,105
When's what gonna stop?

1459
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:19,191
Uh, nothin'.

1460
01:39:22,953 --> 01:39:25,029
Who's the tape for?

1461
01:39:27,457 --> 01:39:30,209
Just some girl who interviewed me
for the Reader.

1462
01:39:40,135 --> 01:39:43,385
So what am I gonna do now?
Just keep jumping from rock to rock...

1463
01:39:43,471 --> 01:39:46,840
for the rest of my life
until there aren't any rocks left?

1464
01:39:46,932 --> 01:39:50,052
Should I bolt every time
I get that feeling in my gut
when I meet someone new?

1465
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:53,477
I've been thinking with my gut
since I was 14 years old...

1466
01:39:53,563 --> 01:39:58,521
and, frankly speaking,
I've come to the conclusion that
my guts have shit for brains.

1467
01:40:05,407 --> 01:40:09,321
Hi. A drinking lunch
on a school day.

1468
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:11,866
That's a nice surprise.

1469
01:40:17,752 --> 01:40:21,666
- Are you nervous about tomorrow night?
- Not really, no.

1470
01:40:24,258 --> 01:40:27,507
Well, um, are you gonna talk to me,
or shall I get my paper out?

1471
01:40:27,594 --> 01:40:31,093
- No, no, I'm gonna talk to you.
- Great. What are you
gonna talk to me about?

1472
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:35,260
Um, I'm gonna talk to you
about whether or not...

1473
01:40:37,728 --> 01:40:40,349
you want to get married to me.

1474
01:40:43,024 --> 01:40:45,265
- I'm serious.
- Yes, I know.

1475
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:47,767
Well, thanks a fucking bunch.

1476
01:40:47,861 --> 01:40:50,399
I'm sorry, but two days ago
you were making tapes...

1477
01:40:50,489 --> 01:40:52,777
- for that girl from The Reader.
- Yeah.

1478
01:40:52,866 --> 01:40:55,950
Well, forgive me if I don't think
of you as the world's safest bet.

1479
01:40:56,035 --> 01:40:58,704
Would you marry me if I was?

1480
01:40:58,788 --> 01:41:01,658
- What brought all this on?
- I don't know.

1481
01:41:01,748 --> 01:41:04,286
- I'm just sick of thinking
about it all the time.
- About what?

1482
01:41:04,376 --> 01:41:10,129
This stuff. Love and settling down
and marriage, you know?

1483
01:41:10,214 --> 01:41:13,417
I want to think
about something else.

1484
01:41:13,509 --> 01:41:15,501
I changed my mind.

1485
01:41:15,594 --> 01:41:18,001
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

1486
01:41:18,096 --> 01:41:20,254
- I do. I will.
- Just shut up, please.

1487
01:41:20,349 --> 01:41:23,184
I'm trying to explain, okay?

1488
01:41:23,268 --> 01:41:26,103
That other girl,
or other women, whatever...

1489
01:41:26,187 --> 01:41:30,398
I mean, I was thinking
that they're just fantasies.

1490
01:41:32,276 --> 01:41:34,849
You know? And they always
seem really great...

1491
01:41:34,945 --> 01:41:38,148
because there's
never any problems.

1492
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,861
And if there are,
they're cute problems like...

1493
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:42,943
you know, we bought each other
the same Christmas present...

1494
01:41:43,035 --> 01:41:46,036
or she wants to go see a movie
that I've already seen, you know?

1495
01:41:46,121 --> 01:41:48,992
And then I come home, and
you and I have real problems...

1496
01:41:49,082 --> 01:41:52,415
and you don't even want to see
the movie I want to see, period.

1497
01:41:52,502 --> 01:41:54,660
- There's no lingerie and...
- I have lingerie.

1498
01:41:54,754 --> 01:41:58,122
Yes, you do.
You have great lingerie, but you
also have the cotton underwear...

1499
01:41:58,215 --> 01:42:03,256
that's been washed a thousand times,
and it's hanging on the thing and...

1500
01:42:03,345 --> 01:42:06,511
A-And they have it too.
It's just I don't have to see it
because it's not in the fantasy.

1501
01:42:06,598 --> 01:42:09,053
Do you understand?

1502
01:42:09,141 --> 01:42:11,762
I'm tired of the fantasy...

1503
01:42:11,852 --> 01:42:14,557
because it doesn't
really exist.

1504
01:42:14,646 --> 01:42:18,478
And there are never really
any surprises, and it never really...

1505
01:42:18,566 --> 01:42:20,938
- Delivers?
- Delivers.

1506
01:42:21,027 --> 01:42:24,442
Right. And I'm tired of it.

1507
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:29,658
And I'm tired of everything else,
for that matter.

1508
01:42:31,412 --> 01:42:34,033
But I don't ever seem
to get tired of you.

1509
01:42:34,122 --> 01:42:36,198
So...

1510
01:42:36,291 --> 01:42:38,449
I think I know what you mean.

1511
01:42:39,919 --> 01:42:43,122
But were you really
expecting me to say yes?

1512
01:42:44,673 --> 01:42:48,373
I don't know.
I didn't think about it really.

1513
01:42:49,928 --> 01:42:52,881
I thought asking
was the important part.

1514
01:42:54,849 --> 01:42:58,976
Well, you've asked. Thank you.

1515
01:43:19,579 --> 01:43:22,745
- All right!
- Uh, thanks for coming out here tonight.

1516
01:43:22,831 --> 01:43:26,034
That was just a little bit
of "I Sold My Mom's Wheelchair..."

1517
01:43:26,126 --> 01:43:28,284
the title track
from the album of same name...

1518
01:43:28,378 --> 01:43:31,295
the record we're having
this record release party for.

1519
01:43:31,381 --> 01:43:35,081
The two burgeoning criminals behind
this opus are standing by the bar.

1520
01:43:35,177 --> 01:43:38,627
They're underage, and
we'll lose our liquor license...

1521
01:43:44,018 --> 01:43:46,473
But we'll get to them in a moment.

1522
01:43:46,561 --> 01:43:49,977
First, I have to introduce a band,
so please don't leave...

1523
01:43:50,064 --> 01:43:53,978
until after they finish
and we play the record.

1524
01:43:54,068 --> 01:43:57,353
Right now, it's my
great, great pleasure...

1525
01:43:57,446 --> 01:44:01,941
to introduce Sonic Death Monkey.

1526
01:44:09,206 --> 01:44:11,329
I'm an idiot. I should've
played the whole album first.

1527
01:44:11,416 --> 01:44:13,409
- These people are gonna
burn the place down.
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.

1528
01:44:13,502 --> 01:44:17,368
It's gonna be fine.
These people are ready for anything.

1529
01:44:17,463 --> 01:44:20,583
- It's gonna be fine. Watch.
- Thank you.

1530
01:44:20,674 --> 01:44:23,924
You're too kind. Rob, thank you
for the enthusiastic intro...

1531
01:44:24,011 --> 01:44:26,299
but we're no longer
called Sonic Death Monkey.

1532
01:44:26,388 --> 01:44:30,764
Uh, we're on the verge of being
called, uh, Kathleen Turner Overdrive.

1533
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:33,519
However, this evening
we will be Barry Jive...

1534
01:44:33,602 --> 01:44:36,638
and the Uptown Five.

1535
01:44:40,735 --> 01:44:45,147
I been really tryin', baby

1536
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:48,405
To hold on to this feeling

1537
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:51,492
For so long

1538
01:44:51,577 --> 01:44:54,033
And if you feel

1539
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:57,572
Like I feel, sugar, come on

1540
01:44:57,666 --> 01:45:01,248
Ohhh, come on, oooh

1541
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:04,040
Let's get it on

1542
01:45:07,174 --> 01:45:09,712
Let's get it on

1543
01:45:09,801 --> 01:45:11,794
Let's love, sugar

1544
01:45:13,179 --> 01:45:16,465
Let's get it on

1545
01:45:16,557 --> 01:45:18,882
Sugar

1546
01:45:18,976 --> 01:45:21,893
Let's get it on

1547
01:45:21,979 --> 01:45:25,098
Whoo-ooh-ooh

1548
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:30,648
We are all sensitive people

1549
01:45:30,736 --> 01:45:32,942
With so much to give

1550
01:45:34,281 --> 01:45:37,400
Understanding, sugar

1551
01:45:38,827 --> 01:45:41,531
Since we got to be

1552
01:45:42,872 --> 01:45:45,908
Let's live

1553
01:45:46,001 --> 01:45:48,123
I love you

1554
01:45:49,462 --> 01:45:53,506
There's nothin' wrong

1555
01:45:53,591 --> 01:45:55,998
With me loving you

1556
01:46:00,096 --> 01:46:03,180
And giving yourself to me

1557
01:46:03,266 --> 01:46:05,507
Could never be wrong

1558
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:09,894
If the love is true, oh, baby

1559
01:46:14,192 --> 01:46:18,236
Don't you know
how sweet and wonderful

1560
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:21,938
- Life can be
- The making of a great
compilation tape...

1561
01:46:22,032 --> 01:46:25,614
like breaking up, is hard to do and
takes ages longer than it might seem.

1562
01:46:25,702 --> 01:46:28,157
You gotta kick it off with
a killer to grab attention.

1563
01:46:28,246 --> 01:46:31,661
Then you gotta take it up a notch,
but you don't want to blow your wad.

1564
01:46:31,749 --> 01:46:36,209
So then you gotta cool it off a notch.
There are a lot of rules.

1565
01:46:37,087 --> 01:46:39,293
Anyway, I've started
to make a tape...

1566
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:42,749
- Here's the songs that meet our ears
- in my head for Laura.

1567
01:46:42,842 --> 01:46:44,834
- And sights our eyes behold
- Full of stuff she'd like.

1568
01:46:44,927 --> 01:46:47,003
Full of stuff that'd make her happy.

1569
01:46:47,095 --> 01:46:50,013
We'll open up our merging hearts

1570
01:46:50,098 --> 01:46:55,305
- For the first time,
I can sort of see how that's done.
- And see our empty souls

1571
01:46:57,564 --> 01:47:01,098
I believe when I fall in love with you

1572
01:47:01,192 --> 01:47:05,059
It will be forever

1573
01:47:05,154 --> 01:47:08,273
I believe when I fall in love

1574
01:47:08,365 --> 01:47:12,528
This time it will be forever

1575
01:47:12,619 --> 01:47:16,616
Without despair

1576
01:47:16,705 --> 01:47:19,457
We will share

1577
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:22,293
And the joys of caring

1578
01:47:22,377 --> 01:47:27,288
Will not be replaced

1579
01:47:28,424 --> 01:47:31,923
What has been

1580
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:35,130
Must never end

1581
01:47:35,222 --> 01:47:38,720
And with the strength we have

1582
01:47:38,808 --> 01:47:43,351
Won't be erased

1583
01:47:43,437 --> 01:47:47,648
When the truth of love
are planned and firm

1584
01:47:47,732 --> 01:47:51,315
They won't be hard to find

1585
01:47:51,402 --> 01:47:55,565
And the words of love I speak to you

1586
01:47:55,656 --> 01:47:59,238
Will echo in my mind

1587
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:05,779
I believe when I fall in love with you

1588
01:48:05,874 --> 01:48:08,282
It will be forever

1589
01:48:10,086 --> 01:48:13,704
I believe when I fall in love this time

1590
01:48:13,798 --> 01:48:17,083
It will be forever, ever

1591
01:48:17,176 --> 01:48:22,466
Ever, ever, ever, ever

1592
01:48:23,806 --> 01:48:27,341
I believe when I fall in love with you

1593
01:48:27,435 --> 01:48:30,221
It will be forever

1594
01:48:31,605 --> 01:48:35,305
I believe when I fall in love with you

1595
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:39,065
It will be forever, ever, ever

1596
01:48:39,153 --> 01:48:43,102
I believe when I fall in love with you

1597
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:47,030
It will be forever, ever

1598
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:50,902
I believe when I fall in love with you

1599
01:48:50,997 --> 01:48:54,864
It will be forever

1600
01:48:54,959 --> 01:48:58,576
I believe when I fall in love with you

1601
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:02,121
It will be forever

1602
01:49:02,215 --> 01:49:05,500
- God answered
- I believe when I fall in love

1603
01:49:05,594 --> 01:49:09,212
- My prayer
- With you it will be forever

1604
01:49:09,305 --> 01:49:14,928
- God answered my prayer
- I believe when I fall in love with you

1605
01:49:15,019 --> 01:49:17,640
- It will be forever
- Oh, baby

1606
01:49:32,117 --> 01:49:34,572
Well, I just got out my little red book

1607
01:49:34,661 --> 01:49:37,234
The minute that you said goodbye

1608
01:49:39,498 --> 01:49:41,823
I thumbed right through
my little red book

1609
01:49:41,917 --> 01:49:44,205
I wasn't gonna sit and cry

1610
01:49:44,294 --> 01:49:47,579
And I went from A to Z

1611
01:49:47,672 --> 01:49:51,752
I took out every pretty girl in town

1612
01:49:51,842 --> 01:49:56,005
They danced with me and as I held them

1613
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:58,421
All I did was talk about you

1614
01:49:58,515 --> 01:50:00,922
Hear your name and I'd start to cry

1615
01:50:01,017 --> 01:50:04,765
There's just no getting over you

1616
01:50:04,854 --> 01:50:07,605
Oh, no

1617
01:50:07,689 --> 01:50:10,394
There ain't no girl
in my little red book

1618
01:50:10,484 --> 01:50:13,603
Who could ever replace your charms

1619
01:50:15,239 --> 01:50:17,694
And each girl in my little red book

1620
01:50:17,783 --> 01:50:20,273
Knows you're the one I'm thinking of

1621
01:50:20,368 --> 01:50:23,653
Oh, won't you please come back

1622
01:50:23,746 --> 01:50:27,578
Without your precious love I can't go on

1623
01:50:27,666 --> 01:50:31,829
Where can love be, I need you so much

1624
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,161
All I did was talk, talk about you

1625
01:50:34,255 --> 01:50:36,627
Hear your name and I'd start to cry

1626
01:50:36,716 --> 01:50:40,630
There's just no getting over you

1627
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,471
Oh, no

1628
01:50:48,893 --> 01:50:52,308
Oh, won't you please come back

1629
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:56,524
Without your precious love I can't go on

1630
01:50:56,608 --> 01:51:00,475
It's haunting me, I need you so much

1631
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:03,143
All I did was talk, talk about you

1632
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:05,397
Hear your name and I'd start to cry

1633
01:51:05,491 --> 01:51:09,903
There's just no getting over you

1634
01:51:09,995 --> 01:51:12,532
All I did was talk, talk about you

1635
01:51:12,622 --> 01:51:14,745
Hear your name and, oh, I'd start to cry

1636
01:51:14,832 --> 01:51:18,699
There's just no getting over you

1637
01:51:18,795 --> 01:51:21,582
Oh, no
