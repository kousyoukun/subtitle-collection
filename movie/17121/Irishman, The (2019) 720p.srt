00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:40,812
<i>When I was young, I thought</i>
<i>house painters painted houses.

3
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:43,646
<i>What did I know?

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,396
<i>I was a working guy.

5
00:01:46,937 --> 00:01:51,812
<i>A business agent for Teamster 
Local 107 out of South Philly.

6
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,396
One of a thousand working stiffs,

7
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,771
until I wasn't no more.

8
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:01,771
And then,

9
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,854
I started painting houses

10
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:07,937
myself.

11
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:27,896
<i>In this particular matter, the whole</i>
<i>thing was built around the wedding.

12
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:34,146
Bill Bufalino's daughter
was getting married in Detroit.

13
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,771
Bill was a Teamster lawyer,
but more important,

14
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:38,729
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

15
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:42,521
<i>Russell didn't want to fly,

16
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:45,854
<i>so I was going to drive him</i>
<i>to the wedding.

17
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,646
<i>He wanted to take care of</i>
<i>some business along the way,

18
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,771
<i>which in Russell's case</i>
<i>meant only one thing:

19
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:54,354
<i>Money, collecting it.

20
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:55,771
<i>So, we'd drive.

21
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:59,729
<i>Him and his wife Carrie</i>
<i>and me and my wife Irene.

22
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,271
<i>I call her Reenie.

23
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,979
<i>I figured we would take 476</i>
<i>out of Philly,

24
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,437
<i>then up to Pittston

25
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,687
<i>and pick up Russ 
which is what we did,

26
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:13,437
<i>and then Interstate 80 West

27
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:18,896
<i>through Pennsylvania,</i>
<i>and then across Ohio to Toledo,

28
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,646
<i>and then we would go 
75 North to Detroit.

29
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:31,646
<i>It would take about three days with all</i>
<i>the business breaks and cigarette stops.

30
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,937
<i>Russell didn't allow nobody</i>
<i>to smoke in the car.

31
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,771
<i>He says Jimmy Blue Eyes 
and Meyer Lansky

32
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:40,354
<i>convinced him to stop smoking 
when they were kicked out

33
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:43,562
<i>of their casinos in Cuba</i>
<i>and getting shot at by Castro.

34
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:46,271
<i>I don't know. Maybe it was:

35
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:49,771
<i>"Please-God-if-I-ever-</i>
<i>get-out-of-this-fucking-thing-alive-

36
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,604
<i>I'll-never-smoke-again."

37
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,437
<i>But I do know that,

38
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:58,771
<i>from Castro on, Russ wouldn't allow
nobody to smoke in his car, 
not even Carrie.

39
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:19,187
Can we stop soon?

40
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,687
We're only in the car 
two minutes, honey.

41
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:26,021
We're not even near the highway.

42
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:29,062
I know. But you don't 
like to stop on the highway.

43
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,937
It's not that so much. They don't
 <i>let </i>you stop on the highway.

44
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:37,271
OK, so then we'll smoke in the car.

45
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,354
What about my cataracts?

46
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,687
I'll crack the window.

47
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:46,937
Carrie,

48
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,562
I made a vow. Remember?

49
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,479
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

50
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:52,729
Yeah, now I can't smoke.

51
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,979
All right, and now I can't smoke.

52
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,062
See where we are?

53
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:22,979
Is that?

54
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:26,312
What are those odds?

55
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,437
What's the problem, kid?

56
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:38,812
I don't know. It sounds funny.
It stops, it starts, it loses power.

57
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:42,229
Let me see if 
I can give you a hand.

58
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,604
Check all these plugs.

59
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:50,104
Spark plugs are OK.

60
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:52,896
The distributor cap's OK.

61
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,812
It's got to be 
something with this.

62
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:58,854
Timing chain.

63
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,271
This is what this is. 
There's a cap on it.

64
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,854
This cap is loose.
It ain't supposed to be loose.

65
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,979
So that means they're getting worn out.

66
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,187
Try that now. Tighten It up.

67
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,312
All right?

68
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,896
I can drive them. I can't fix them.

69
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,396
You're back in business, kid.

70
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,354
I owe you anything?

71
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:28,729
No, you don't owe me anything.
It's all right.

72
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,187
- Frank.
- Hey, Frank. How you doing?

73
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,062
What's your name?

74
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:40,646
Where you from?

75
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,437
- Philly.
- Oh, you're from Philly.

76
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,979
Where you hang out there?

77
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:49,979
Callahan's.

78
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,396
Bocce Club. It's a bar not a bocce club.

79
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:55,854
Oh, yeah. You play bocce?

80
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,062
Nah.

81
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,229
All right, Frankie, get that fixed.

82
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,646
- Because it'll go again on you.
- Thank you.

83
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,771
- I will. Thanks again.
- Good luck, buddy.

84
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:09,729
<i>I thought maybe he owned

85
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:11,187
the gas station.

86
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,146
He owned something, you could tell.

87
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,687
Yeah, it turns out
he owned the whole road.

88
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:38,229
This one?

89
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:43,521
Drink up, fellas.

90
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:45,146
God bless.

91
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,187
Let's go. Let's make some money.

92
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:50,146
It's a bar.

93
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,437
Say hello to your wife.

94
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:55,771
I got a way
we can push those hindquarters.

95
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,521
There's a guy in here, he'll pay
a lot of money for them.

96
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,312
Let's shoot this first.

97
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:05,104
At the other end of the bar
at twelve o'clock.

98
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:07,062
He's got a rescinding hairline.

99
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:09,229
You'll make a lot of money with him.

100
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:11,312
Skinny Razor. He owns the place.

101
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:12,479
Razor?

102
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,729
He shylocks and runs a book
out of the joint.

103
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,854
He's got good connections.

104
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:18,729
Razor's his name?

105
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,479
He used to work at a butcher shop.

106
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:27,062
My friend Frank Irish is here.
The one I told you about.

107
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,729
- The truck.
- Yeah, hindquarters.

108
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,521
Frank Sheeran.

109
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,354
You like steak?

110
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:38,812
I do.

111
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,104
I deliver steak.

112
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:41,979
Do you?

113
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:43,104
Good steak.

114
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,479
I could deliver you steak.

115
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,687
- Could you?
- I could.

116
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:54,271
Good price, too. The best.

117
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:57,229
- We'll talk later.
- OK.

118
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:58,854
Thanks, Skinny.

119
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,854
It's freezing out there.

120
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,312
I don't mind it.

121
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,521
I hate it.

122
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,187
When you go outside,

123
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,854
put the seal on.

124
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:18,521
- All right. I got to go out anyway.
- I owe you one.

125
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:24,562
There you go, Frank.

126
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:27,479
- See you next time.
- Thanks, Tony.

127
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:31,146
Much better, Frank.

128
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:35,146
I don't go near Choice.
I only do Prime.

129
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:36,687
Can I get more next Tuesday?

130
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:38,437
How many you want?

131
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:41,396
At least five.

132
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:44,854
Five you got.

133
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:07,021
What the fuck is this?

134
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,937
Tony, I don't...

135
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,187
- What the fuck is this, Frank?
- I don't know.

136
00:12:14,937 --> 00:12:16,562
I don't load the truck.

137
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:19,937
The loaders are supposed to load it.
Maybe they didn't do their work.

138
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,479
You didn't realise you were driving
a light horse?

139
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,354
It felt fine.

140
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:26,646
Come on, Frank. Come on.

141
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,271
I'm telling you. I...

142
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:33,146
God's truth. I just don't know
what happened. Maybe some...

143
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,729
- It's empty.
- I know it is.

144
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:41,187
I know it is.

145
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,271
What are you looking at? 
Go back to work.

146
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:45,937
All of youse!

147
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:49,604
What can I tell the boss?

148
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,187
Just don't look at me 'cause I...

149
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:54,479
Who else can I look at?

150
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,687
It's not going to be on me, Frank.

151
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:58,812
I just drive the truck.

152
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,479
{\an8}Frank Sheeran. 
Did I say that right?

153
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:06,396
Under the contract, 
thanks to Jimmy Hoffa,

154
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:09,729
a driver can only be fired
on very specific charges.

155
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,146
- Were you ever late?
- No.

156
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,979
- Do you have any moving violations?
- No.

157
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,812
- Do you drink on the job?
- No.

158
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,271
Ever hit anybody?

159
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:19,187
On the job?

160
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:23,687
Stealing, is that grounds?

161
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,271
Can they prove it?

162
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,646
I don't think so.

163
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:31,396
Then there's nothing to worry about.

164
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,687
If they can prove it,

165
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:38,854
they're just going to
want names. Accomplices.

166
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:41,021
You give them some names, you go home.

167
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,604
Keep your job.

168
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:44,687
How about that?

169
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:46,104
Would you give them names?

170
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,229
No names.

171
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:57,437
I don't care if you did it or not.
That makes no difference to me.

172
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,062
I'm here to defend you. Right?

173
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,187
So you want to know 
if I did it or not?

174
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:13,104
I'm going to defend you either way.

175
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:19,979
I work hard for them when I'm...
I ain't stealing from them.

176
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:23,771
<i>Your Honour, if this was about

177
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:27,354
right or wrong, the company would
have sought Mr Sheeran's dismissal.

178
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:28,562
They didn't.

179
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:32,562
They accused Mr Sheeran because
they hoped he could name conspirators

180
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,521
which he couldn't do
because they don't exist.

181
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:38,771
They don't exist
because he didn't steal anything.

182
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:42,396
He didn't steal anything
because he's an exemplary employee,

183
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:45,687
who, in eight years, has never taken
a day of sick leave.

184
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,396
The only rule he ever broke
is his own union's,

185
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:51,854
by helping others carry sides of beef
from his truck

186
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:54,812
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter.

187
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,479
All rise.

188
00:14:58,562 --> 00:14:59,687
Court is in session.

189
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:02,896
I'm dismissing this 
case with a warning.

190
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,354
Yes, Your Honour.

191
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,771
No, not you, Mr Sheeran.

192
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,396
You bring another working man
before this court

193
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:11,771
with threats instead of evidence,
believe me, you'll be sorry.

194
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:14,312
If I owned stock in this company,
I would sell it.

195
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:16,646
<i>I don't know how he did it

196
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,229
<i>and I ain't going to ask. 
All I know is

197
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:21,729
<i>that Bill Bufalino 
got me out of a case

198
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:24,271
<i>I should never have 
gotten away with.

199
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:25,687
<i>I should've been 
down for the count.

200
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:27,937
They're going to appreciate
what you did today.

201
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,187
They got families, they got kids.

202
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,437
They need those jobs.

203
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,271
<i>Instead, we went out celebrating

204
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,729
<i>and I met what was going to 
turn out to be the rest of my life.

205
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:43,812
I thought that was 
you walking in outside.

206
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:47,937
Can I introduce you 
to this new guy Frank?

207
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:52,229
Frank, I want you to meet
my cousin Russell Bufalino.

208
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,771
You helped me with my truck
a few months ago.

209
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,604
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
The timing chain.

210
00:15:58,687 --> 00:15:59,771
Did you get it fixed?

211
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:01,104
I fixed it the next day.

212
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:03,854
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

213
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,187
I'm glad you fixed it.

214
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:14,937
There's a lot of tough guys
around here. Did he tell you?

215
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:18,312
- You're not afraid of 
tough guys, are you?  - No.

216
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:20,687
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

217
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:23,937
Your cousin saved my ass.

218
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,604
I could've lost the whole load.

219
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,937
Yeah. Well, he knows
everything about trucks.

220
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,062
He worked at Canada Dry for a long time.

221
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,312
Vito, how are you?

222
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:33,896
Let's take the booth. Come on.

223
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:38,396
<i>I didn't know who 
Russell Bufalino was back then,

224
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:41,771
<i>but I'd seen enough pictures 
and stories in the newspapers

225
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:44,021
<i>to know he was eating 
with Angelo Bruno.

226
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,354
<i>Bruno, he was just made 
the new boss of Philadelphia.

227
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:51,437
<i>He took care of everything</i>
<i>from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.

228
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:52,479
<i>That I knew.

229
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,104
<i>And that was all I had to know,

230
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,562
<i>to know that Russell Bufalino was 
no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.

231
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,979
This bread is very good.

232
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:15,062
Good, eh?

233
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:20,979
Where did an Irisher like you
learn to speak Italian?

234
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:23,187
In Italy, the war.

235
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:25,771
Where?

236
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:27,604
Salerno.

237
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:29,771
Anzio.

238
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:31,937
Sicily,

239
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:33,729
around Catania.

240
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:36,312
Catania? I'm from Catania.

241
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:40,937
Yeah? I thought you had
an accent like Catania.

242
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,812
How long were you in the war?

243
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:47,687
Four years.

244
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:51,312
411 days in combat,

245
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,021
122 at Anzio.

246
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,062
Forty-fifth Infantry.

247
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:05,312
Were you afraid of dying?

248
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,021
Always afraid.

249
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,604
And don't let anybody tell you

250
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:14,854
that they weren't afraid.
That's a lot of bullshit.

251
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:16,479
Everybody's afraid.

252
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,562
And you pray a lot.

253
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:19,396
I prayed a lot.

254
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:23,896
I prayed I'd never sin again
if I could just get out of here.

255
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,729
But then the fighting starts,

256
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:29,271
and then you forget about everything.

257
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:32,354
You're just trying 
to survive, stay alive.

258
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:34,937
Once I saw

259
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:36,646
that I was getting through the war,

260
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,562
I looked around me, and I said:

261
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,729
"From now on,
whatever happens, happens."

262
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:45,937
Fuck it.

263
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:49,646
You know, you follow orders.

264
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,812
They tell you to bring some
prisoners into the woods.

265
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:55,146
They don't say what to do,

266
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,937
they just say, "Hurry up."

267
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,771
<i>It's crazy, but I never understood</i>
<i>how they would just keep digging

268
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,437
<i>their own graves.

269
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:10,021
Stop!

270
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:18,021
<i>Maybe they thought</i>
<i>if they did a good job,

271
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,479
<i>the guy with the gun

272
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:22,729
<i>would change his mind.

273
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:42,271
<i>Russell, he took a shine 
to me right away.

274
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:44,896
<i>After a while,

275
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,104
<i>he started giving me

276
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,437
<i>little things to do.

277
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:53,562
<i>But then Angelo, himself, started</i>
<i>giving me little things to do, too.

278
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:00,187
<i>Russ's wife Carrie, her family

279
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,187
<i>goes all the way back, 
way, way back

280
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:05,021
<i>to the same town in Sicily</i>
<i>as the Bufalinos.

281
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,229
<i>They talked about it 
all the time.

282
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:11,312
<i>She came from Mob royalty,</i>
<i>if you want to call it that.

283
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:12,646
{\an8}<i>The Sciandras.

284
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:17,062
{\an8}<i>To them, it was like they came 
over on the Italian Mayflower.

285
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:47,021
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

286
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:50,521
Give me those clothes.
I'll get rid of them.

287
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:56,312
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

288
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:06,604
Hey, Frank,

289
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:08,646
can we stop soon?

290
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,187
Yeah, yeah, well,
ask your husband. Russell?

291
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,479
He's out cold.

292
00:21:24,437 --> 00:21:26,646
- I got it, Frank.
- Sure?

293
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:34,646
Where are we?

294
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:35,854
Near Lewisburg.

295
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:40,479
Let me know when we get there.
I got some stops to make.

296
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,479
<i>Russell had a piece of everything.

297
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:01,979
<i>He had this store in Pittston 
called Penn Drape and Curtains.

298
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:03,854
<i>And he ran 
everything out of there.

299
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,562
<i>Who knew what it all was?

300
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,896
<i>I'm sure the man had partners.</i>
<i>They always have partners.

301
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,146
<i>Nobody keeps all the money.

302
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:16,104
<i>But everybody listened to Russ.</i>
<i>That I can tell you.

303
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:19,812
<i>You wanted to bribe a judge,</i>
<i>you asked Russell.

304
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:24,062
<i>You didn't know how much to bribe him,</i>
<i>Russell was going to tell you.

305
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:27,437
All right, I'll tell him.
I'll be right there.

306
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:30,062
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

307
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:32,187
<i>You want to promote one of your guys,

308
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:35,521
<i>Russ would tell you</i>
<i>you could or you could not.

309
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,771
Do me a favour.

310
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:39,604
Go with Steve down to his place.
Take Vito with you.

311
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:42,896
These guys keep coming around,
so straighten them out.

312
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,521
I'll take care of it, Russ.

313
00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:47,562
Where's... Oh, here you are.

314
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:51,521
<i>You want to make somebody disappear,</i>
<i>you got to get Russell's permission.

315
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,396
<i>No two ways about it.

316
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:56,146
- I wasn't worried.
- I didn't think so.

317
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:58,562
- Tell your father I said "Hi".
- I'll tell him. Thanks.

318
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:01,812
What are you doing here?
You got to go with Bruno.

319
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:03,437
I'm on my way.

320
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:07,146
<i>And when you did something for Russ,</i>
<i>you did it yourself.

321
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:08,979
<i>Like Russ used to say...

322
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,687
<i>When I ask somebody to take 
care of something for me,

323
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,896
I expect them to
take care of it themselves.

324
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:16,271
I don't need two roads 
coming back to me.

325
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:23,479
<i>When Anastasia got killed</i>
<i>in the barbershop,

326
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,646
<i>they brought Russell in</i>
<i>to calm things down,

327
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:28,854
<i>so that everybody wasn't going</i>
<i>around killing everybody

328
00:24:28,937 --> 00:24:31,062
<i>and it could all get straightened out.

329
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:34,187
We know what happened.

330
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,354
We can't change it. It is what it is.

331
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:38,812
Please, tell my friend 
I'm happy to help.

332
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,604
<i>You'd never know it</i>
<i>by looking at this guy,

333
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:44,896
<i>but all roads led back to Russ.

334
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:53,979
Where's the money?

335
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:55,604
- He don't have it.
- He don't have it?

336
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:59,604
- He said something about his mother--
- Don't tell me.

337
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:00,521
Let me guess.

338
00:25:01,104 --> 00:25:03,562
His mother died,
and the funeral set him back.

339
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:06,354
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

340
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,396
Fucking mother's...

341
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,979
fucking dying over and over
for ten years.

342
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:13,354
What do I do?

343
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:14,771
Don't leave.

344
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:28,396
Here.

345
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,437
Just show it to him. Don't use it.

346
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:49,937
Hey. Look.

347
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:51,062
Hey, Frank.

348
00:25:53,104 --> 00:25:54,812
Skinny wants to see you. Get in the car.

349
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:57,646
- I was just going to go see him.
- Get in the fucking car.

350
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,021
- I was just going to go see him!
- Get in the car!

351
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:04,562
Don't get cute with me. That bullshit
about your mother. Get in the car!

352
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,354
- I swear I was just going to--
- Get in the fucking car!

353
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,687
You want to get cute with me?

354
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:17,437
All that bullshit about your mother
and sick and all that and dying.

355
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:19,646
- I was just going to go see him.
- You're going to see him now.

356
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:21,521
I swear,
I was going to come see you tomorrow.

357
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,479
Tomorrow. I swear to God.

358
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:24,937
Tomorrow. Here.

359
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:27,521
- What time?
- One o'clock. I'll be here at one.

360
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:29,354
What, are you sleeping in?

361
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:30,979
You tell me.

362
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,229
Ten o'clock. Here.

363
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:34,312
Tomorrow.

364
00:26:34,396 --> 00:26:35,771
Swear on your mother.

365
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:37,104
Swear on your mother!

366
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:38,021
Swear on your mother!

367
00:26:38,104 --> 00:26:39,937
I swear on my mother!

368
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:43,021
- What time tomorrow?
- I'll be here at ten o'clock.

369
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,687
Tomorrow. Here.

370
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,271
I'll bring the money tomorrow. All of it.

371
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,437
I swear to God. How do I get home?

372
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:55,187
Take the fucking bus!

373
00:26:58,062 --> 00:26:59,479
Let his mother pick him up.

374
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,729
What's the matter with her?

375
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:16,396
Nothing. She knocked something over
at the grocery store and made a mess,

376
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,437
- and the grocer yelled at her.
- He yelled at her?

377
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:19,896
He shoved her.

378
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:21,021
He shoved her?

379
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:24,687
Did he shove you?

380
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:28,979
Who was this? The guy
at the grocery store on the corner? Joe?

381
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:33,771
Did he?

382
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:36,187
Honey, did he shove you?

383
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:41,937
Just answer me. Did he push you?
Did he shove you? Did he do that?

384
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,646
Let's go.

385
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:50,479
Frank, he didn't mean it.
It just happened.

386
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:52,896
He didn't mean it? He touched her.

387
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:54,729
He has no right to push her. Touch her.

388
00:27:54,812 --> 00:27:56,521
Not even put one pinky on her.

389
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:05,187
That's him, right?

390
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:06,479
Stay here. Stay here.

391
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,104
Frank, I'm sorry, but your kid
was out of line.

392
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:14,646
I only did what you should.

393
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:21,604
God, I'm sorry.

394
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:23,937
No. Please. No, no, Frank.

395
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,271
No, no, Frank! No!

396
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:41,229
- Take that, you motherfucker!
- No! Come on!

397
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:47,771
My fucking hand. My fucking hand!

398
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:27,562
<i>Russell and Carrie baptised</i>
<i>our new daughter Dolores.

399
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:31,479
<i>It was a wonderful occasion,</i>
<i>and we were honoured.

400
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,521
<i>Everybody showed up.

401
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:59,896
<i>The only thing is, you got more kids,</i>

402
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:04,854
You want to make a quick ten grand?

403

<i>Whispers DiTullio. 
Not the Whispers

<i>they blew up in that car</i>
<i>around the same time.

405

406
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:19,354
I got this place I front money to.
It's a really good business.

407
00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:20,562
It's a laundry.

408
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:22,979
They collect the linen, towels,

409
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:25,854
<i>sheets from the hotels and restaurants

410
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:28,479
<i>in Atlantic City. They wash and iron it.

411
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:31,687
Normally, it's like a license to print
fucking money.

412
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:33,646
Until recently.

413
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:38,521
A company that opened in Delaware
is trying to put us out of business.

414
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:42,604
<i>They're cutting their prices.</i>
<i>They're scaring our drivers.

416
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:48,396
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little concerned.

417
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:53,229
<i>Whenever anybody says they're a little</i>
<i>concerned, they're very concerned.

418
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:57,354
As a matter of fact,
I'm really more than a little concerned.

419
00:30:57,437 --> 00:31:02,104
<i>And when they say they're more than</i>
<i>a little concerned, they're desperate.

420
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:06,437
I want this fucking place bombed, burnt,
torched, whatever you have to do.

421
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:08,312
You were in the war. 
You know what to do.

422
00:31:09,104 --> 00:31:11,354
Leave that fucking place
like you left Berlin.

423
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:15,021
Burnt to the fucking ground. 
I want them out of fucking business.

424
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,021
Who are they?

425
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:20,271
It's the Cadillac Linen
Service in Delaware.

426
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:22,562
It's run by a bunch of Jews.

427
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:25,021
Let them collect their insurance,

428
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:26,229
I'm sure they have plenty,

429
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:28,479
and leave this 
fucking other place alone,

430
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,104
the one I'm involved in.

431
00:31:31,604 --> 00:31:33,604
- This ain't ten grand.
- It's two grand.

432
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:38,521
When you put these Jew washerwomen
out of business, you get the rest.

433
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,479
I'm a little short of the money
right now,

434
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:45,562
and I don't want to go to Skinny 
and have to pay a big.

435
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:48,646
I’m going to be paying them forever.
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

436
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:51,604
Nobody has to know,

437
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:54,729
especially not Skinny because
I'm not getting the money from him.

438
00:31:56,604 --> 00:32:00,479
I see you look a little hesitant.
I know what you can do.

439
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:04,646
If I stiff you on the money,
you'll do something terrible to me.

440
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:06,937
I do not want that.

441
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,687
I hit the number.

442
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:21,562
It's about 1,500.

443
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:23,604
I'll see you in a few hours.

444
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:07,437
Hey, Frank.

445
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:11,146
Angelo wants to see you.

446
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:14,271
- Now?
- Yeah, now is good.

447
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:16,146
What's it about?

448
00:34:16,229 --> 00:34:18,937
I don't know. Come on. I'll drive you.

449
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:53,271
Sit down, Frank.

450
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,771
What're you doing in Delaware?

451
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,229
Bombing out a laundry place.

452
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:26,229
I was just doing a job 
to make some extra money.

453
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:30,187
Putting this place out of action.

454
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,812
Putting this place
out of commission.

455
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:37,604
For who?

456
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,771
Now is not the time to not say.

457
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:56,687
Whispers.

458
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:58,437
The other Whispers.

459
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:05,229
You know who owns
the Cadillac Linen Service?

460
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:10,437
- Some Jews in the laundry business.
- They own a part of it.

461
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:13,687
You know who else has an interest in it?

462
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,021
- No.
- I do.

463
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:16,896
Who?

464
00:36:17,896 --> 00:36:20,187
I do. I own the other part.

465
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:22,896
Not I know somebody who owns
the other part.

466
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,771
Angelo, I didn't know
you had any part of it.

467
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,312
I would never have done what I did
if I knew you were involved.

468
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,396
I would never do that against you.

469
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:37,896
Whispers didn't say it was the Jew Mob?

470
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,479
He said Jew washerwomen.

471
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:44,021
Jew washerwomen.

472
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:47,021
What else he say?

473
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:49,604
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

474
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,896
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

475
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,021
He did.

476
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:02,979
I didn't check.

477
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:05,229
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

478
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:07,271
- Can I give him his money back?
- He won't need it.

479
00:37:07,937 --> 00:37:09,229
You can keep it.

480
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:13,104
I don't want no trouble. I'll just
give it back to him and I'm OK.

481
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:15,104
He won't need it.

482
00:37:19,562 --> 00:37:21,104
OK. Thanks.

483
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:22,312
Thank Russell.

484
00:37:22,937 --> 00:37:25,312
I would have let the 
Jew Mob have you.

485
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,604
You got a good friend here.

486
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:32,771
You don't know how good
a friend you got.

487
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:35,229
I know.

488
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:36,437
No, you don't know.

489
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:41,312
Wait by the bar.

490
00:37:58,104 --> 00:38:02,854
<i>In a case like this, the best thing 
to do is you use something brand new.

491
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:04,437
<i>Right out of the box.

492
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:08,229
<i>Otherwise, you don't know where 
it's been or who's used it.

493
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:10,604
<i>What crime it was connected to.

494
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,229
<i>That's suicide.

495
00:38:12,312 --> 00:38:15,896
<i>So, I recommend something new,</i>
<i>straight out of the box.

496
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:18,104
<i>Stone cold. Clean.

497
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:26,021
There you are. I didn't know which way
you were coming from. I didn't--

498
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,729
<i>The next thing you do

499
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,937
is throw the thing away. Get rid of it.

500
00:38:39,437 --> 00:38:42,062
<i>Everybody uses a spot in</i>
<i>the Schuylkill River.

501
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:47,521
<i>If they send divers down there,</i>
<i>they'd be able to arm a small country.

502
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:14,479
<i>For me, everything changed 
after Whispers.

503
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:20,354
<i>It was like the army.

504
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:23,062
<i>You followed orders.

505
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:27,062
<i>You did the right thing.

506
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,146
You got rewarded.

507
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:35,146
<i>And when I handled things for Russell,</i>
<i>it was never for money,

508
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:37,062
<i>but as a show of respect.

509
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:38,437
<i>You ran an errand,

510
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:42,229
<i>you did a favour, you got a favour back</i>
<i>if you ever needed it.

511
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:45,146
<i>And you always hurried back.

512
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:04,687
Thank you, Vito.

513
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:08,521
Hi, Frank.

514
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,437
What can I get for you?

515
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:13,646
I'm just going to get the wine now.

516
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:18,104
Just call me if you need anything.

517
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:19,187
I will.

518
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:26,437
- Help yourself, Frank.
- Thanks.

519
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,687
Things change.

520
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:35,396
- She's the new one, right?
- Yeah.

521
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:37,854
She's a nice kid. Nice kid.

522
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:52,312
<i>No time is a good time</i>
<i>to leave your wife,

523
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:54,729
<i>but that's when I left mine.

524
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:05,604
Hey, Ira, what's going on?

525
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:11,604
- Any problems?
- No. Everything's good.

526
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,271
Pull over after this Caddy.

527
00:41:22,896 --> 00:41:24,354
He's expecting you.

528
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:52,187
Phil, you have a nice shop here.

529
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,854
People like to come to this store.

530
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:57,687
But your kid is a real <i>sfigato.

531
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,687
Understand? He's a pain in the ass.

532
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:03,562
He's a wild kid. 
You got to control him. If you don't,

533
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,312
nobody's going to want 
to shop here anymore.

534
00:42:06,396 --> 00:42:09,271
If it's not good for you,
it's not good for me.

535
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:11,979
You understand what I'm saying.

536
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:14,812
I apologise, Russell.

537
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:19,396
That's from you and Frank, and this one
from you and me.

538
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:21,021
What about a baby spoon?

539
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:24,479
- What'll she do with a baby spoon?
- Have a baby.

540
00:42:24,562 --> 00:42:25,979
They're not married yet.

541
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:27,479
I give you my word.

542
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:29,396
All right. Your word's good, Phil.

543
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,396
Let's go, girls.

544
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,187
We're done.

545
00:42:34,271 --> 00:42:35,562
What are you doing?

546
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,812
When the hell are you going to wise up?

547
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:55,146
There we go. That's my girl.

548
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:08,479
Hey, Peggy.

549
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,396
Come here.

550
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:16,104
I don't know.

551
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:20,646
I get the feeling she don't like me.
Like she's afraid of me.

552
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:22,187
That's the way she is.

553
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:25,771
She's afraid of me at times, too.
She's a sensitive kid.

554
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,479
I understand if she's afraid of me,
but she shouldn't be scared of you.

555
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:34,312
And then she hears about me
in the papers sometimes.

556
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,021
You got to be close to your kids.

557
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:37,937
I am.

558
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:39,937
You're blessed to have them.

559
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:42,187
Carrie and I can't have kids.

560
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:44,479
But you're blessed. You're blessed.

561
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:46,562
Call her. Tell her to come over.

562
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:48,437
Sweetheart. Peggy. Come here.

563
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:56,937
- Come here.
- Come over by Uncle Russ.

564
00:43:58,021 --> 00:43:59,937
- How are you?
- OK.

565
00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:03,812
Do you know why God made the sky
so high?

566
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:10,729
So little birdies don't bunk their head
on it when they're flying around.

567
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:13,604
Isn't that cute?

568
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:14,854
A little joke.

569
00:44:15,354 --> 00:44:16,354
Isn't that funny?

570
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:18,104
You want some candy?

571
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:21,604
No, you guys don't want any candy.

572
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:25,437
There's nothing I can do for you?

573
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:28,937
If there is, let Uncle Russell know.

574
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:30,021
OK.

575
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:31,562
Go back. Have some fun.

576
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:35,521
You see what I mean?

577
00:44:36,104 --> 00:44:37,437
See that feeling I get?

578
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:41,021
She's just shy.
She don't mean nothing.

579
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:45,854
Sometimes, when the parents 
get divorced, the kids get all confused

580
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:48,896
and they get resentful, and they
don't know who to take it out on

581
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,354
or which side, or...

582
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,479
No, you're right.

583
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:56,771
I'm lucky because Reenie and
Mary get along like gangbusters,

584
00:44:56,854 --> 00:44:59,521
so the kids go back and forth
with no problem.

585
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:03,271
Keep your family close.
Keep an eye on that.

586
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:05,521
I mean, I'm just lucky.

587
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:11,979
How's it going with the union?

588
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:15,229
- The union's the best in the world.
- You like it, huh?

589
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:18,521
I wish I had something 
more steady, but...

590
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:21,854
How about organising?

591
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,396
I would like to do that. But

592
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:25,729
there's a long line.

593
00:45:26,229 --> 00:45:28,312
A long waiting list, if you will.

594
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,812
Well, a friend of ours
is having a little trouble.

595
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,437
Friend at the top.

596
00:45:34,521 --> 00:45:36,146
Who's that?

597
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:37,062
The top.

598
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:38,479
Hoffa?

599
00:45:39,062 --> 00:45:39,896
Yeah.

600
00:45:40,396 --> 00:45:44,854
I heard the other day that some guys
tried to pipe him because of

601
00:45:44,937 --> 00:45:46,062
a workman's comp case.

602
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:49,271
Yeah, I heard he
beat the shit out of them.

603
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:51,146
How long can he keep doing that?

604
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:54,521
He needs somebody 
he can trust around him.

605
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:57,354
Somebody to be with him all the time.

606
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:02,771
<i>I'll put McGee on the phone.

607
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:05,979
Hello.

608
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:08,687
Hiya, my friend. How are you?

609
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:13,062
I got that kid
I was talking to you about here.

610
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,729
I'm going to put him on the phone,
let you talk to him.

611
00:46:19,271 --> 00:46:20,521
Hello.

612
00:46:20,604 --> 00:46:21,521
Is that Frank?

613
00:46:22,187 --> 00:46:24,271
Hiya, Frank. This is Jimmy Hoffa.

614
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:27,229
- Glad to meet you.<i>
- Glad to meet you, too,

615

even if it's over the phone.

616
00:46:30,812 --> 00:46:32,271
I heard you paint houses.

617
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:35,812
Yes. Yes, sir, I do. I do.

618
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,104
And I...

619
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:39,021
I also do my own carpentry.

620
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:40,937
<i>Glad to hear that.

621
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:43,396
I hear you're a brother of mine.

622
00:46:43,479 --> 00:46:46,646
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.

623
00:46:48,562 --> 00:46:50,396
Our friend speaks very highly of you.

624
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:52,646
Thank you.

625
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,729
He's not an easy man to please.

626
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,354
I do my best.

627
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:57,979
<i>Well, there's a situation...

628

00:47:19,062 --> 00:47:22,479
<i>In the '50s, he was as big as Elvis.

636
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:24,812
<i>In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.

637
00:47:25,437 --> 00:47:29,354
<i>Next to the President, he was the most</i>
<i>powerful man in the country. Bar none.

638
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:30,729
If you got it,

639
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:33,479
a truck brought it to you.

640
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:36,021
If you got

641
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,146
your food, your clothing,

642
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:41,479
your medicine, fuel for your homes,

643
00:47:41,562 --> 00:47:43,479
fuel for your industries,

644
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:46,062
a truck brought it to them.

645
00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:51,271
The day our trucks stop,

646
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:53,146
America stops!

647
00:47:55,771 --> 00:48:00,104
<i>There's a situation going on now, Frank,</i>
<i>that needs to be attended to.

648
00:48:00,187 --> 00:48:04,604
Big business and the government
are trying to tear the union apart.

649
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:06,271
<i>They're trying to pull us down.

650
00:48:06,354 --> 00:48:08,354
<i>Big business is on the attack!

651
00:48:08,937 --> 00:48:12,062
They're coming. They're coming hard
and they're coming fast.

652
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:14,146
Big business and the government

653
00:48:14,229 --> 00:48:16,479
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent

654
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:18,271
among our ranks,

655
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:21,604
at a time when we need unity!

656
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:24,021
We need solidarity!

657
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:26,479
I want to write it in the sky.

658
00:48:27,062 --> 00:48:28,687
Solidarity!

659
00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:31,187
Solidarity!

660
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:34,146
Solidarity!

661
00:48:34,229 --> 00:48:36,396
<i>You want to be a part of this fight?

662
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:37,687
Yes, I do, sir.

663
00:48:37,771 --> 00:48:40,312
<i>Would you like to be</i>
<i>a part of this history?

664
00:48:40,396 --> 00:48:41,604
Yes, I would.

665
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:45,021
Whatever you need me 
to do, I'm available.

666
00:48:45,104 --> 00:48:47,187
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

667
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:49,187
- I can, sir.<i>
- See you then.

668
00:48:54,187 --> 00:48:55,854
He likes to talk, don't he?

669
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,479
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

670
00:49:08,104 --> 00:49:10,771
<i>You know, Frank, the only reason why</i>
<i>you're here,

671
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:16,187
<i>the Seafarers Union is signing up</i>
<i>the same non-union cab drivers

672
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:17,812
<i>as we want to do.

673
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:20,062
Nobody knows who you are,

674
00:49:20,146 --> 00:49:23,354
and nobody knows what the fuck
you're doing here. OK?

675
00:49:23,437 --> 00:49:25,146
You and I know why you're here.

676
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:29,771
We need to sign these drivers up
so Paul Hall doesn't get them

677
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:31,229
for his fucking union.

678
00:49:31,312 --> 00:49:35,562
For some reason, most of these drivers
are fucking lesbians.

679
00:49:35,646 --> 00:49:37,229
I have no reason why.

680
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:39,979
Paul Hall's running around saying that

681
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:43,312
he's getting a better contract
than our boy Jimmy.

682
00:49:43,396 --> 00:49:44,896
He's a cocksucker.

683
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:49,646
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley
in his pocket.

684
00:49:49,729 --> 00:49:52,187
The cops are OK with whatever we do.

685
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:54,521
They won't help us push these cars in,

686
00:49:54,604 --> 00:49:57,604
but they won't let anybody
fucking stop us.

687
00:50:18,937 --> 00:50:20,562
Come on, all you guys.

688
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:23,354
Let's get this fucking thing
in there. Watch yourself!

689
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:27,854
This is a lot of work.

690
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:30,021
- You ever think of using candy?
- What?

691
00:50:30,104 --> 00:50:31,104
Candy.

692
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:32,729
What the fuck is candy?

693
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:40,979
- Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.
- I got it. I got it.

694
00:50:41,687 --> 00:50:43,854
Here, you take the gas.

695
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:02,354
One thing about Jimmy.

696
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:04,271
Don't ever make him wait.

697
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:08,229
If you have a meeting, get there
on time. Better, get there early.

698
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:09,854
I can't stress this enough.

699
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:13,229
His problem is that time is of essence.

700
00:51:13,312 --> 00:51:14,729
That's the important thing.

701
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:17,562
One more thing. Jimmy doesn't drink.

702
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:21,521
The head of the largest fucking union
in the world don't drink.

703
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:25,187
The worst part about it is, he doesn't
allow anybody to drink around him.

704
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:31,854
Another thing about him.

705
00:51:31,937 --> 00:51:34,479
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

706
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:39,104
But we're going to like watermelon.

707
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:41,812
Jimmy, you should'a seen it,

708
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:43,187
sinking in the water.

709
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:46,729
One by one. I bet you
when they woke up

710
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,479
the next morning,
those fucking cab drivers

711
00:51:49,562 --> 00:51:52,812
went to get their cabs,
they didn't know what the fuck hit them.

712
00:51:53,562 --> 00:51:54,979
Great idea, Joey.

713
00:51:55,062 --> 00:51:56,312
Great idea.

714
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:57,896
Well, it wasn't my idea.

715
00:51:59,021 --> 00:52:01,437
My man Frank. It was his idea.

716
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:03,062
Let me tell you something.

717
00:52:03,146 --> 00:52:05,937
Frank took over the pier.

718
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:09,312
Whatever he told them to do,
whatever he said, they did it.

719
00:52:10,646 --> 00:52:14,104
I never seen a guy walk 
through a crowd like he does.

720
00:52:14,187 --> 00:52:16,812
He doesn't touch a fucking person!
Everybody gets out of the way.

721
00:52:16,896 --> 00:52:18,687
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

722
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:21,104
Guys he never met in his life.
It was like

723
00:52:21,187 --> 00:52:23,062
Moses. Remember Moses,

724
00:52:23,146 --> 00:52:27,271
when he walked into the ocean? The sea,
whatever it was, and it opened up!

725
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:30,479
That's him. I'm telling you.
Jimmy, he's got it.

726
00:52:30,562 --> 00:52:31,687
What do you think?

727
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:34,104
You need him 
a few days more?

728
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:36,646
We got to clear up 
a few dribs and drabs.

729
00:52:38,896 --> 00:52:40,604
You guys sure like watermelon.

730
00:52:41,187 --> 00:52:42,187
Want a bite?

731
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:43,312
Not on your life.

732
00:52:45,479 --> 00:52:47,771
You were there. 
You saw it firsthand.

733
00:52:47,854 --> 00:52:49,729
Those guys ain't union.

734
00:52:49,812 --> 00:52:53,812
They're like Nazi collaborators,
operating behind the lines.

735
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:55,854
- You know. You were in the war.
- I sure do.

736
00:52:56,937 --> 00:52:57,812
In a war,

737
00:52:57,896 --> 00:53:01,812
you go from point A to point B.

738
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:03,979
Sometimes,

739
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:07,271
you spill a little 
beer along the way.

740
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:11,021
That philosophy make sense to you?

741
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,229
Sure does.

742
00:53:13,229 --> 00:53:14,271
Good.

743
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:34,729
<i>Jimmy didn't make me stay in his suite</i>
<i>because he liked me.

744
00:53:35,396 --> 00:53:39,771
<i>He didn't want me</i>
<i>registering in my name at the hotel.

745
00:53:41,104 --> 00:53:44,104
<i>This way, there was no proof</i>
<i>I was even in Chicago.

746
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:56,062
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

747
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:57,146
Nothing stops her.

748
00:53:57,729 --> 00:54:01,521
<i>After Chicago, Jimmy and I got close.</i>
<i>The wives hit it off.

749
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:05,771
<i>And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids</i>
<i>grown up and out of the house,

750
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:07,729
<i>they got a kick out of our kids, too.

751
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:12,271
{\an8}<i>Especially Peggy.

752
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:15,271
<i>She and Jimmy</i>
<i>fell for each other right away.

753
00:54:15,854 --> 00:54:19,646
You know what I like even better than
getting my picture took?

754
00:54:19,729 --> 00:54:20,646
What?

755
00:54:23,062 --> 00:54:24,646
Surprise!

756
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:29,812
<i>To Peggy, Jimmy wasn't like Russ,</i>
<i>or Skinny or even me.

757
00:54:29,896 --> 00:54:33,104
Sorry, everybody.
This is just for Peggy and I.

758
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,229
<i>For one thing,</i>
<i>Jimmy didn't have a nickname

759
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:37,646
<i>like the "Razor" or "The Hunchback"

760
00:54:37,729 --> 00:54:39,854
<i>or "The Weasel", or "Whispers".

761
00:54:39,937 --> 00:54:41,771
So, what happened to "Thank you"?

762
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:46,187
<i>And to her, he was helping people.

763
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,062
<i>He was helping them make more money,</i>
<i>live better lives.

764
00:54:49,646 --> 00:54:52,062
<i>He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.

765
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:56,021
"'If you have it,
a truck brought it to you."

766
00:54:56,104 --> 00:54:57,604
This is what Mr Hoffa says.

767
00:54:58,187 --> 00:55:02,271
He's the president of the Teamsters 
Union with over a million members.

768
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:05,229
They all support him
because they have steady jobs

769
00:55:05,312 --> 00:55:07,979
big pay and a retirement pension.

770
00:55:09,354 --> 00:55:13,062
<i>The Teamster Pension Fund</i>
<i>had eight billion dollars in it.

771
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:16,771
<i>Jimmy had complete control</i>
<i>over every bit of it.

772
00:55:17,354 --> 00:55:19,437
Isn't this a beautiful presentation?

773
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:22,104
A bridge loan is really
all I'm asking, Jimmy.

774
00:55:22,646 --> 00:55:26,646
I'm not going to piss away my members'
pension dough on something too risky.

775
00:55:26,729 --> 00:55:28,562
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

776
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:30,896
I got Minsky's Follies.

777
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:33,479
I got the first 
topless act on the Strip.

778
00:55:33,562 --> 00:55:36,021
We're booming in there.
I can't get the drinks out.

779
00:55:36,104 --> 00:55:39,146
Just asking for a golf course.
You know you never lost a dime with me.

780
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:42,854
We'd really appreciate whatever
you can do to help Jake along here.

781
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:45,479
One-five is all I need
for a completion bond.

782
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:50,479
OK. OK. Go to the bank.

783
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:54,187
It's going to be a big success.
Thank you, Jimmy.

784
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:56,062
You're a prince. You're a <i>mensch.

785
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:09,562
And, because of Mr Hoffa,
workers have medical insurance

786
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:10,812
for when they get sick,

787
00:56:10,896 --> 00:56:14,354
and know, when they retire,
they're not going to go hungry.

788
00:56:16,229 --> 00:56:20,604
<i>There was so much paperwork that </i>
<i>Jimmy used an insurance company

789
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:23,812
<i>run by this kid, Allen Dorfman,</i>
<i>to work out the loans.

790
00:56:23,896 --> 00:56:27,646
No, no, nothing for nothing.
Next time ask a little bit fucking nicer.

791
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:34,812
And? And? How'd it go?

792
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:39,062
It was a little touch and go for a bit.
But at the end, fine.

793
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:42,229
<i>Russ would get Jimmy to give</i>
<i>guys like Gottlieb the loans

794
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:44,979
<i>and you would get like 10% of that.

795
00:56:45,562 --> 00:56:47,562
<i>Or whatever. Maybe even more.

796
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:50,979
You tell Marteduzzo from me
that I appreciate it.

797
00:56:51,062 --> 00:56:53,479
Everybody'll appreciate it.
It's a good thing.

798
00:56:54,646 --> 00:56:58,479
<i>You couldn't go to regular banks </i>
<i>because the money was for gambling.

799
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,021
<i>God's truth, that's what it was.

800
00:57:00,104 --> 00:57:04,771
<i>You couldn't. So the Mob went to</i>
<i>the Teamsters for the money.

801
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,604
<i>It was the Teamsters that stepped in

802
00:57:06,687 --> 00:57:08,812
<i>and lent the money that built Las Vegas.

803
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:13,271
Billy, don't touch this stuff.
Just go where you got to go.

804
00:57:13,354 --> 00:57:16,479
<i>There was more business than anybody</i>
<i>could handle.

805
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:20,104
{\an8}<i>So Jimmy had to shove some of the
deals off on to his wife Jo,

806
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:24,979
{\an8}<i>who had no idea she had 22% of</i>
<i>a Florida land deal called "Sun Valley,"

807
00:57:25,062 --> 00:57:29,021
<i>some charter fishing boats,</i>
<i>and a ski lodge with its own mountain.

808
00:57:34,562 --> 00:57:37,729
<i>One of Jimmy's clients</i>
<i>was Sam "Momo" Giancana,

809
00:57:37,812 --> 00:57:40,312
<i>who was friends with the Kennedys</i>
<i>from back when Jack's father

810
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:42,187
<i>made his fortune with the Italians

811
00:57:42,271 --> 00:57:44,354
<i>as a bootlegger during Prohibition.

812
00:57:44,437 --> 00:57:46,771
<i>Momo, Sinatra hung out together

813
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:48,271
<i>with the Kennedys.

814
00:57:49,604 --> 00:57:53,771
Momo and Kennedy, believe it or not,
even had the same girlfriend.

815
00:57:53,854 --> 00:57:55,812
Together. At the same time.

816
00:57:56,354 --> 00:57:57,437
Talk about crazy.

817
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:02,396
<i>It was easy for the Mob to help</i>
<i>Joe Kennedy get his son elected president.

818
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:06,729
<i>They just punched up the vote to make</i>
<i>sure that he won

819
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:08,062
<i>in Illinois.

820
00:58:11,646 --> 00:58:13,271
<i>In exchange for that,

821
00:58:13,354 --> 00:58:16,687
the new president was going to get
Castro out of Cuba,

822
00:58:16,771 --> 00:58:21,479
so our guys could get their casinos
and race tracks and shrimp boats

823
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:25,479
and everything else that they had
and owned down there in Havana back.

824
00:58:25,562 --> 00:58:27,271
But that that didn't happen.

825
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:35,396
<i>The Italians

826
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:38,812
<i>wanted Kennedy the Irishman</i>
<i>for President,

827
00:58:38,896 --> 00:58:40,437
<i>and that's what they got.

828
00:58:42,521 --> 00:58:45,437
Get used to it because we're going to be
seeing it 24/7.

829
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:46,896
Son of a bitch!

830
00:58:46,979 --> 00:58:49,812
Goddamn Kennedys.
I'm looking at the damn Kennedys.

831
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:51,562
The kids. Language.

832
00:58:51,646 --> 00:58:53,521
What difference does it make?

833
00:58:53,604 --> 00:58:56,979
They got to learn sooner or later.
We're going to war with these people.

834
00:58:57,562 --> 00:58:58,437
War!

835
00:58:59,146 --> 00:59:00,979
I've said it a thousand times.

836
00:59:01,062 --> 00:59:02,896
I don't care they're Irish.

837
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:05,104
I don't care they're Catholic.

838
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:08,521
If there's one person you can't trust
in this life,

839
00:59:08,604 --> 00:59:10,062
it's millionaires' kids.

840
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,312
You're right, Jimmy.

841
00:59:12,021 --> 00:59:14,646
Especially that little son of a bitch.

842
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:20,521
You don't remember doing any favours
for Johnny Dio

843
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:22,354
{\an8}or you don't remember
the conversation?

844
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:27,437
{\an8}I'm saying,
to the best of my recollection,

845
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:30,062
I must recall on my memory,

846
00:59:30,146 --> 00:59:31,812
I cannot remember.

847
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,562
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

848
00:59:38,854 --> 00:59:40,104
Individuals.

849
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:43,104
Which individuals, Mr Hoffa?

850
00:59:45,354 --> 00:59:49,896
Off hand, that particular 
amount of money I borrowed.

851
00:59:50,396 --> 00:59:52,812
I don't know at 
this particular moment.

852
00:59:53,729 --> 00:59:58,187
But the record of my loans,
which I requested, I have,

853
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:01,062
and out of all the moneys I loaned

854
01:00:01,146 --> 01:00:04,854
during this period of time
I went into these ventures.

855
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:12,396
<i>Those goddamn Kennedys,

856
01:00:12,979 --> 01:00:13,896
they get what they want!

857
01:00:13,979 --> 01:00:15,062
Jimmy, the kids.

858
01:00:15,146 --> 01:00:18,729
Him and all the bullshit problems
he put me through already.

859
01:00:18,812 --> 01:00:20,937
I got to go. You don't expect me
to look at this.

860
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:22,396
No, I don't.

861
01:00:23,479 --> 01:00:24,812
<i>For guys like Russ,

862
01:00:24,896 --> 01:00:26,312
<i>it couldn't have been better.

863
01:00:26,396 --> 01:00:30,979
<i>Russ did his part for getting</i>
<i>Kennedy elected,

864
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:32,021
{\an8}<i>that's for sure.

865
01:00:32,104 --> 01:00:33,521
{\an8}What are you doing?

866
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:35,979
I told you to put 
them on every pole.

867
01:00:36,062 --> 01:00:37,271
<i>So, what's the first thing

868
01:00:37,354 --> 01:00:40,271
<i>that Jack Kennedy does to thank</i>
<i>Chicago for all their help?

869
01:00:41,229 --> 01:00:43,521
He puts his shitass brother in there,

870
01:00:43,604 --> 01:00:47,354
<i>that little prep school punk,</i>
<i>and he makes him Attorney General.

871
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:54,104
And what's the first thing Bobby does?
He goes after not just Jimmy,

872
01:00:54,187 --> 01:00:56,854
which in a way you could understand.

873
01:00:56,937 --> 01:00:58,521
Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much,

874
01:00:58,604 --> 01:01:01,521
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

875
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:06,479
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,
Marcello, Trafficante,

876
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:07,771
and all the other guys

877
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:10,729
who put his brother in the White House
in the first place.

878
01:01:12,854 --> 01:01:14,146
What's that about?

879
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:16,479
Thank you.

880
01:01:17,062 --> 01:01:18,521
Am I missing something?

881
01:01:24,396 --> 01:01:25,479
That's gorgeous.

882
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,021
Wear it in the best of health.
We love you.

883
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,104
This one is for Peggy,

884
01:01:33,187 --> 01:01:36,187
from Uncle Russell.
Merry Christmas, my love.

885
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:38,479
Oh, look at those.

886
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:42,062
So nice!

887
01:01:42,146 --> 01:01:43,854
I heard you like to skate.

888
01:01:45,437 --> 01:01:46,687
What do you say?

889
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:49,604
Thank you.

890
01:01:50,146 --> 01:01:52,062
Now me and Uncle Russell can take
you ice skating.

891
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:55,604
I think Santa Claus left you a little
something extra in there, too.

892
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:02,896
What do you say to Uncle Russell?

893
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:05,687
What do you say?

894
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:09,937
It's all right.

895
01:02:10,562 --> 01:02:13,104
She said thank you once. That's enough.

896
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:19,562
<i>With Bobby as Attorney General,</i>
<i>they were all over us.

897
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:23,146
<i>We couldn't talk on the phone because</i>
<i>we knew it was being bugged.

898
01:02:23,229 --> 01:02:24,937
<i>You couldn't do nothing.</i>
<i>You couldn't go nowhere.

899
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:27,104
<i>You couldn't do anything. It was a bad,

900
01:02:27,187 --> 01:02:29,187
<i>bad, bad situation. And then...

901
01:02:29,771 --> 01:02:30,812
<i>Jimmy. Forget it.

902
01:02:30,896 --> 01:02:35,604
<i>Bobby, as Attorney General, has</i>
<i>the power to send anybody to jail.

903
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:38,187
<i>And Jimmy was at the top</i>
<i>of Bobby's hit list.

904
01:02:38,271 --> 01:02:39,396
<i>He even set up

905
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:41,021
<i>a "Get Hoffa Squad".

906
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:44,687
<i>And he had his guys from the FBI,</i>
<i>the IRS working 'round the clock.

907
01:02:44,771 --> 01:02:47,937
<i>Their only job</i>
<i>was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.

908
01:02:48,021 --> 01:02:49,104
<i>That's all they did.

909
01:02:52,062 --> 01:02:56,062
I am sitting in a room
full of fucking idiots.

910
01:02:57,729 --> 01:03:00,146
You dumb motherfuckers!

911
01:03:00,229 --> 01:03:01,896
You know what you did?

912
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:04,396
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid

913
01:03:05,062 --> 01:03:06,646
and you put him on

914
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:08,854
as general organiser,

915
01:03:09,687 --> 01:03:12,396
pay him thirty-six fucking grand,

916
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:14,687
at the same time,

917
01:03:15,646 --> 01:03:19,562
you let him sell insurance
to his fucking father's...

918
01:03:28,312 --> 01:03:30,354
to his fucking father's...

919
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:34,687
to his fucking father's locals!

920
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,354
Damn it!

921
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:38,979
How do you do that?

922
01:03:40,896 --> 01:03:43,062
How stupid can you be?

923
01:03:45,396 --> 01:03:47,896
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

924
01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:51,104
has got his nose up my ass
everywhere I go!

925
01:03:51,646 --> 01:03:55,021
They're hounding me.
They're looking at everything I do.

926
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:57,812
And you let this happen in public!

927
01:03:58,396 --> 01:03:59,771
You're giving it to him!

928
01:03:59,854 --> 01:04:02,021
I'm going to jail. You understand?

929
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:04,979
I'm going to prison because of you,

930
01:04:05,062 --> 01:04:07,229
you dumb motherfuckers.

931
01:04:07,312 --> 01:04:08,854
What you wanted

932
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:11,229
was to put me in jail.
Tell me, so I can kill you.

933
01:04:11,312 --> 01:04:12,771
Right here!

934
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,937
- Where're you going?
- I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

935
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:23,104
Quitting? Why?

936
01:04:23,187 --> 01:04:25,354
You going to call me a motherfucker?

937
01:04:25,437 --> 01:04:27,354
You can talk to them like that,
but not to me.

938
01:04:27,437 --> 01:04:29,521
No! That didn't apply to you.

939
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:33,312
Then let me know it didn't apply to me.
I'm standing right there.

940
01:04:33,396 --> 01:04:35,062
I didn't even see you standing there!

941
01:04:35,146 --> 01:04:37,604
I was standing right there.
What are you talking about?

942
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:40,437
But it didn't apply to you!
What else can I say?

943
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:44,396
You got a problem, pull me aside.

944
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:46,729
Don't insult me and then say
it didn't apply to me.

945
01:04:46,812 --> 01:04:48,979
But I didn't even see you there.

946
01:04:49,562 --> 01:04:53,854
Come on, Frank, you know me better
than that. You know me better than that.

947
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:54,771
Please.

948
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:58,854
Come on. It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.

949
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,146
Why would I say that to you?

950
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:05,521
- You got to control these people.
- I'm controlling everything. Don't worry.

951
01:05:08,229 --> 01:05:09,937
OK, guys, get out of here now.

952
01:05:10,437 --> 01:05:13,646
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>Jimmy is running the fucking union.

953
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:18,062
Between Bobby and the FBI up his ass
all the time, he's going fucking crazy.

954
01:05:18,562 --> 01:05:21,187
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

955
01:05:21,271 --> 01:05:25,979
The old-timers know the old man.
They'll talk to him and straighten it out.

956
01:05:26,062 --> 01:05:29,562
But he can't understand,
and to be honest, I don't either,

957
01:05:29,646 --> 01:05:33,021
how youse could help get the Kennedy
pricks elected in the first place.

958
01:05:33,104 --> 01:05:34,896
It don't make no sense to him.

959
01:05:34,979 --> 01:05:36,479
He doesn't have to 
understand everything.

960
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:39,521
You know what I'm saying.
Sometimes it's better.

961
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,187
When I see him like that, 
you know,

962
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:46,896
I'm trying to... I feel bad.
I want to help him in some way.

963
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,104
He's too emotional.

964
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:53,687
Like some guy who's rushing all over
the place and misses the big picture.

965
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:56,271
Like Cuba.

966
01:05:58,104 --> 01:06:01,104
Getting us back into casinos.

967
01:06:01,187 --> 01:06:03,437
Getting us back into Havana.

968
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,604
Like getting rid
of that fucking Castro prick.

969
01:06:09,937 --> 01:06:12,479
The old-timers spoke to the old man.

970
01:06:12,562 --> 01:06:15,437
The old man talked to 
his son Jack and he told him,

971
01:06:15,937 --> 01:06:18,521
don't forget who the fuck he owes.

972
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:23,271
He knows who the fuck he owes.

973
01:06:24,562 --> 01:06:26,187
<i>So, I want you

974
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:30,104
<i>to go down to a place</i>
<i>called Milestone Hauling.

975
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:33,396
<i>There's a guy named Phil.

976
01:06:33,896 --> 01:06:35,729
<i>He's going to give you a rig.

977
01:06:42,854 --> 01:06:47,187
<i>You drive the rig to Baltimore</i>
<i>to a concrete plant.

978
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:48,812
<i>It's on Eastern Avenue.

979
01:06:48,896 --> 01:06:51,396
<i>It's the only one on the street.</i>
<i>You can't miss it.

980
01:06:55,771 --> 01:06:57,479
<i>A guy's going to meet you there.

981
01:06:58,062 --> 01:06:59,771
<i>A fairy named Ferrie.

982
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:03,187
Pull it forward, then back it in.

983
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:26,396
<i>You'll pick up some things.

984
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:29,937
<i>He'll give you some paperwork</i>
<i>in case you get stopped.

985
01:07:40,479 --> 01:07:43,396
<i>You drive down to Florida.

986
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:45,521
<i>A dog track outside Jacksonville.

987
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,646
<i>You leave it there.

988
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:53,229
<i>A guy with big ears named Hunt</i>
<i>will meet you there.

989
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:58,021
<i>He's going to give you a car</i>
<i>to drive back to Philly.

990
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:13,187
What are you looking at?

991
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:14,437
You looking at my ears?

992
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:17,562
Sorry?

993
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:20,396
My ears. Are you looking at my ears?

994
01:08:22,062 --> 01:08:23,062
No.

995
01:08:24,312 --> 01:08:29,146
I had an operation, so there's no need
for anyone looking at my ears anymore.

996
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:30,562
I ain't looking at your ears.

997
01:08:34,437 --> 01:08:36,229
Get out of here. Go on.

998
01:08:58,104 --> 01:09:00,854
<i>...in the Bay of Pigs.</i>
<i>Nothing went as planned.

999
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,396
<i>Paratroopers were unable

1000
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:05,396
<i>to blow up roadways along</i>
<i>the beach area. Castro raced

1001
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:06,896
<i>toward the scene.

1002
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:09,187
<i>The underground might have blown up</i>
<i>the roads, but it knew nothing.

1003
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:10,812
<i>Soon Castro had artillery firing

1004
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,729
<i>on the beachhead.</i>
<i>His planes destroyed invading ships

1005
01:09:13,812 --> 01:09:16,271
<i>carrying a brigade of men</i>
<i>and vital ammunition.

1006
01:09:16,354 --> 01:09:18,687
<i>The beachhead could not be enlarged,</i>
<i>and paratroopers

1007
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:22,854
<i>were fighting their way back</i>
<i>to the shore where the invaders

1008
01:09:22,937 --> 01:09:26,729
<i>were pinned down. 1,500 men had been</i>
<i>dumped on the shore without air cover

1009
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:28,521
<i>or protective fire from ships.

1010
01:09:28,604 --> 01:09:32,646
<i>Castro had to wait only until they ran out</i>
<i>of ammunition before mopping them up.

1011
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:35,979
<i>Later, Castro was to strut around</i>
<i>the invasion area with newsmen

1012
01:09:36,062 --> 01:09:39,771
<i>and expound on the errors that had</i>
<i>been made. He had ample material.

1013
01:09:40,271 --> 01:09:42,854
The United States, already humiliated,

1014
01:09:42,937 --> 01:09:45,812
stood condemned by most of 
the countries of the world.

1015
01:09:45,896 --> 01:09:46,854
<i>Ah, shit!

1016
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:50,187
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

1017
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,937
Boobie comes after me and the union.

1018
01:09:53,771 --> 01:09:57,896
He's looking for cheap publicity.
That's all it is. That's what he's doing.

1019
01:09:57,979 --> 01:09:59,396
It's going to blow over.

1020
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:01,521
How's it going to blow over?

1021
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:03,146
They'll never forget

1022
01:10:03,854 --> 01:10:07,271
- that I gave money to Nixon!
- Calm down. Jimmy, please.

1023
01:10:07,354 --> 01:10:08,396
We're going to handle this.

1024
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:11,521
Some of the old-timers are going 
to get to old man Kennedy.

1025
01:10:11,604 --> 01:10:13,146
He's a little sick, but--

1026
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:14,354
Sick?

1027
01:10:14,437 --> 01:10:17,104
He had a fucking stroke. 
That's not sick.

1028
01:10:17,187 --> 01:10:19,687
That's... you're close
to the grave.

1029
01:10:19,771 --> 01:10:21,604
He's become a fucking eggplant.

1030
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:24,021
You can't blame anybody for that.

1031
01:10:24,104 --> 01:10:27,646
I'm not blaming anybody. 
But if I were, it's the Kennedys.

1032
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:29,812
His kids killed him. 
I'll tell you that.

1033
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:32,354
He's not dead, 
but he's going. He's going.

1034
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:35,104
They killed him.
They'd give anybody a heart attack.

1035
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:11,437
Where are you going?

1036
01:11:12,312 --> 01:11:13,604
I'm going to work.

1037
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,854
Go back to sleep.

1038
01:12:05,104 --> 01:12:07,354
<i>All I can say, we will not stop.

1039
01:12:08,021 --> 01:12:10,521
<i>We been doing that for fifty years!

1040
01:12:11,896 --> 01:12:13,437
<i>What good does it do?

1041
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:16,771
<i>Let the lawyers drive a truck.

1042
01:12:16,854 --> 01:12:19,854
<i>They need their pencils and papers</i>
<i>and their ink pads.

1043
01:12:21,521 --> 01:12:23,271
That's a whole other story.

1044
01:12:24,021 --> 01:12:25,937
But we're going to get through this.

1045
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:31,396
We're going to get through this legal
bullshit garbage they're throwing at us.

1046
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:35,187
{\an8}We're going to get through it
because "Boobie" Kennedy wants something

1047
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:40,021
doesn't mean the rich boy is
going to get it. You understand?

1048
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:43,187
I don't care what he wants.
He's not going to get it!

1049
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:48,229
He's not going to get it because

1050
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:50,979
we are the biggest,

1051
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:52,604
and best,

1052
01:12:52,687 --> 01:12:55,021
and most honest union

1053
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,437
in this country!

1054
01:12:57,562 --> 01:12:59,521
Yes, I waited for that!

1055
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:07,437
And you know the operative word
I'm talking about.

1056
01:13:08,062 --> 01:13:09,354
Solidarity.

1057
01:13:09,812 --> 01:13:12,146
And it works. 
It works for all of us.

1058
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:16,562
And it works for our friend here
Frank Fitzsimmons!

1059
01:13:17,146 --> 01:13:18,771
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

1060
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:22,771
my Executive Vice President.
If there's anyone

1061
01:13:22,854 --> 01:13:25,396
that can do this job, 
it's this man here.

1062
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:27,646
And with him at my back,

1063
01:13:28,187 --> 01:13:30,187
where are we going to go but up!

1064
01:13:31,854 --> 01:13:33,312
Is that right, Fitz?

1065
01:13:33,812 --> 01:13:36,146
All the way, Jimmy!

1066
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:39,479
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1067
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:51,896
A union man!

1068
01:13:54,187 --> 01:13:57,396
I felt they liked Fitz.
No two ways about it.

1069
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:00,979
You gave Fitz some build up.
I hope he deserves it.

1070
01:14:03,062 --> 01:14:04,854
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

1071
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:09,687
I don't know. I don't want to
knock the guy, but...

1072
01:14:09,771 --> 01:14:12,062
Well, you're not knocking him.
Just tell me,

1073
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:13,687
tell me what you feel.

1074
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:16,646
He's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

1075
01:14:17,146 --> 01:14:18,687
He's a nice guy, but

1076
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:21,021
he ain't that sharp. 
He ain't that smart.

1077
01:14:21,104 --> 01:14:24,229
He's also like a... 
He plays a lot of fucking golf.

1078
01:14:24,312 --> 01:14:25,437
He plays golf?

1079
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:28,312
That's what you want 
from a number two.

1080
01:14:28,896 --> 01:14:30,396
You don't want somebody too smart.

1081
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:33,479
You want a nice guy. 
People like him.

1082
01:14:33,562 --> 01:14:35,521
Not dumb, but somebody

1083
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:39,104
you can have walking behind you
without getting knifed.

1084
01:14:39,187 --> 01:14:41,812
- Well, I hope you're right.
- I'm always right.

1085
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,729
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

1086
01:14:46,271 --> 01:14:48,187
It's the Little Guy 
I have to worry about.

1087
01:14:49,187 --> 01:14:50,479
You know what I'm saying.

1088
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:52,437
The Little Guy.

1089
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:53,687
That's my worry.

1090
01:14:55,437 --> 01:14:56,937
That son of a bitch.

1091
01:14:58,479 --> 01:14:59,479
What's the matter?

1092
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:01,479
Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

1093
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,479
I'm right. Yeah.

1094
01:15:04,062 --> 01:15:06,312
- You're not perplexed, are you?
- Not at all.

1095
01:15:06,396 --> 01:15:10,021
I told you how I felt about Fitz.
Pro. You know.

1096
01:15:10,104 --> 01:15:11,521
Good, because sometimes I feel

1097
01:15:11,604 --> 01:15:14,562
I'm the only one who sees
right through that cocksucker.

1110
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,812
You toil, you work,

1111

while the corporation kings

with their vast expense accounts
and salary and luxurous yachts,

1114
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:39,896
have dedicated themselves
to our destruction.

1115
01:16:39,979 --> 01:16:41,062
Down on them!

1116
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:45,896
<i>I didn't need nobody</i>

01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:42,646
He's got a hand 
in everybody's pocket.

1129
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:45,604
Shaking down the 
trucking companies.

1130
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:46,854
Threatening people.

1131
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:51,062
You threaten people 
once in awhile, I understand.

1132
01:17:51,146 --> 01:17:52,396
But all the time?

1133
01:17:52,896 --> 01:17:55,104
It's drawing attention to us.

1134
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:59,354
Guys like that 
give the unions a bad name.

1135
01:18:00,437 --> 01:18:02,021
Something's got to be done.

1136
01:18:02,646 --> 01:18:05,104
I mean it. 
Something's got to be done.

1137
01:18:05,812 --> 01:18:07,604
Tony being Tony,

1138
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:10,479
that ain't easy.

1139
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,687
I don't mean that.

1140
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,062
Not that.

1141
01:18:15,646 --> 01:18:17,396
I'm just saying get working guys

1142
01:18:17,479 --> 01:18:19,979
who know the unions,
card-carrying Teamsters,

1143
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,229
like you and me,

1144
01:18:21,979 --> 01:18:23,229
to start running,

1145
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:25,062
take over some of the locals.

1146
01:18:25,646 --> 01:18:26,771
What do you think?

1147
01:18:27,521 --> 01:18:28,521
He ain't going to like that.

1148
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:32,104
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he?
He's a gangster.

1149
01:18:32,646 --> 01:18:34,687
I'm the president of the union.

1150
01:18:36,104 --> 01:18:37,312
All I need is some guys

1151
01:18:37,396 --> 01:18:39,604
who know their ways around.

1152
01:18:40,187 --> 01:18:42,896
Know how to handle themselves.
That's all.

1153
01:18:44,021 --> 01:18:46,146
That's why I want you to run
for president

1154
01:18:46,646 --> 01:18:48,312
of Local 326.

1155
01:18:50,979 --> 01:18:53,187
You're like family to me, 
Frank. You know.

1156
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:54,979
You, Irene,

1157
01:18:55,562 --> 01:18:56,729
the girls.

1158
01:18:56,812 --> 01:18:58,062
The lovely Peggy.

1159
01:18:58,854 --> 01:19:00,979
But that's not why I'm doing this.

1160
01:19:01,062 --> 01:19:03,979
I'm not giving you anything
you didn't earn,

1161
01:19:04,562 --> 01:19:05,646
you didn't deserve.

1162
01:19:06,979 --> 01:19:07,979
What do you think?

1163
01:19:09,896 --> 01:19:13,104
I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

1164
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:15,146
Well, just say you'll do it.

1165
01:19:16,146 --> 01:19:17,771
That's all you got to say.

1166
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:20,312
Plus, I can guarantee 
you're going to win.

1167
01:19:21,521 --> 01:19:23,062
When you run for president

1168
01:19:24,187 --> 01:19:26,604
of 326, you're going to win.

1169
01:19:28,104 --> 01:19:29,229
I guarantee it.

1170
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:32,187
Yeah, OK, I'll do it. Yeah.

1171
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:34,896
You mean it, huh?

1172
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:37,229
Yeah. I'm honoured.

1173
01:19:37,312 --> 01:19:39,562
I love you. 
I just love you, you know.

1174
01:19:40,271 --> 01:19:41,771
I love you, man.

1175
01:19:41,854 --> 01:19:43,021
I can't tell you.

1176
01:19:44,062 --> 01:19:46,021
Gee. This is so good, you know.

1177
01:19:46,104 --> 01:19:48,312
I feel like I can breathe again.

1178
01:19:48,396 --> 01:19:49,437
It's so funny.

1179
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:51,104
Somehow,

1180
01:19:52,312 --> 01:19:55,312
I don't know.
I thought you would've said no.

1181
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:58,146
I'm glad you said yes.

1182
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:06,646
You never reveal how you feel.
It's hard to tell.

1183
01:20:07,229 --> 01:20:08,062
I'm honoured, Jimmy.

1184
01:20:08,146 --> 01:20:11,312
I don't know what to say.

1185
01:20:11,396 --> 01:20:12,271
I'm honoured.

1186
01:20:13,437 --> 01:20:14,687
Well, that's good.

1187
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,271
That makes me feel good.

1188
01:20:19,354 --> 01:20:20,854
Oh, I can breathe.

1189
01:20:21,896 --> 01:20:23,312
That's so great.

1190
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:57,562
<i>What can I say?</i>
<i>I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.

1191
01:20:57,646 --> 01:21:00,937
<i>He took me out of a meat truck 
and gave me my start.

1192
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:04,646
<i>He gave me my first charter.</i>
<i>He gave me my first union.

1193
01:21:05,604 --> 01:21:06,604
How are you?

1194
01:21:07,354 --> 01:21:10,354
Frank Sheeran, the new 
president of Union 326.

1195
01:21:10,437 --> 01:21:12,312
- I wanted to introduce myself.
- Nice to meet you.

1196
01:21:12,896 --> 01:21:14,854
- What's your name?
- My name's Al.

1197
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:16,312
Nice to meet you, Al.

1198
01:21:16,396 --> 01:21:18,354
- A little something.
- No, no. Don't need it.

1199
01:21:18,937 --> 01:21:19,771
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1200
01:21:19,854 --> 01:21:23,854
Just came to introduce myself.
You need anything, get in touch with me.

1201
01:21:23,937 --> 01:21:24,771
You sure?

1202
01:21:25,896 --> 01:21:28,062
{\an8}If they can prove

1203
01:21:28,146 --> 01:21:30,896
you stole from them, what 
they're going to want are names.

1204
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:36,854
Would you give up names
to keep from going to jail?

1205
01:21:37,437 --> 01:21:38,312
No.

1206
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:42,604
You got nothing to worry about.
The lawyers will take care of it.

1207
01:21:53,562 --> 01:21:57,604
<i>The Interstate 80 West through</i>
<i>the rest of Pennsylvania,

1208
01:21:58,104 --> 01:22:02,521
<i>and then we'd go across Ohio</i>
<i>all the way to Toledo,

1209
01:22:02,604 --> 01:22:06,312
<i>and then we'd go 
75 North to Detroit.

1210
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:09,354
<i>And we'd still 
get there on time.

1211
01:22:12,146 --> 01:22:14,479
<i>Your Honour, 
counsel advised my client

1212
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:19,062
that it was legal for his wife to be
part owner of a trucking business.

1213
01:22:19,146 --> 01:22:22,271
Still, when the McClellan
Committee challenged its legality,

1214
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,562
she withdrew
from the company immediately.

1215
01:22:24,646 --> 01:22:26,729
That should be 
the end of the matter.

1216
01:22:27,396 --> 01:22:30,646
There has not been one 
indictment served against my client

1217
01:22:30,729 --> 01:22:32,937
in thirteen grand 
jury investigations.

1218
01:22:33,771 --> 01:22:38,896
Your Honour, this is an example of
a personal vendetta against my client,

1219
01:22:38,979 --> 01:22:42,604
against his family by a
frustrated Justice Department

1220
01:22:42,687 --> 01:22:45,062
and the Attorney General, 
Robert Kennedy.

1221
01:22:51,687 --> 01:22:52,979
He's got a gun!

1222
01:22:58,187 --> 01:22:59,354
Get that gun out of his hand!

1223
01:23:10,229 --> 01:23:11,646
That was not a real gun, was it?

1224
01:23:11,729 --> 01:23:14,396
How'd that gun get in?
How'd it get in here?

1225
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:16,062
It wasn't my fault!

1226
01:23:17,312 --> 01:23:18,521
Oh, my Chuckie!

1227
01:23:19,104 --> 01:23:20,437
Hey, it's my son!

1228
01:23:20,937 --> 01:23:22,979
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

1229
01:23:23,062 --> 01:23:24,937
You see him? You see what he did?

1230
01:23:27,437 --> 01:23:28,646
I'll tell you this.

1231
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:31,729
He shot at me and it was 
like a pellet or something.

1232
01:23:31,812 --> 01:23:36,187
I just felt an impact, like I 
was shot, not even with a BB gun.

1233
01:23:36,271 --> 01:23:37,729
Something even lighter.

1234
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:39,271
But I charged him.

1235
01:23:39,354 --> 01:23:42,104
I charged him and so did Chuckie.
I taught him well.

1236
01:23:42,687 --> 01:23:46,271
You charge a guy,
always charge a guy with a gun.

1237
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,646
With a knife, you run away.

1238
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:50,896
Run away from a knife.
You charge with a gun,

1239
01:23:51,396 --> 01:23:52,354
with a knife you run.

1240
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:54,937
Hey! I rhymed!

1241
01:23:56,562 --> 01:24:00,271
{\an8}It sounds crazy, but a higher
power told me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

1242
01:24:00,354 --> 01:24:01,187
{\an8}Come with me.

1243
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:03,437
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

1244
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:05,354
Come on down, Frank.

1245
01:24:05,437 --> 01:24:07,229
I got one of them with me now.

1246
01:24:07,312 --> 01:24:11,604
<i>Get down here. Eddie Partin,</i>
<i>from Baton Rouge, is here with me.

1247
01:24:11,687 --> 01:24:12,812
I'll get right down.

1248
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:14,646
Out of my way, boys.

1249
01:24:22,354 --> 01:24:25,729
Did Mr Brennan first say, or 
do you remember him first saying

1250
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:28,646
something about,
"I had to change the deal.

1251
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:30,896
I have to cut Hoffa in"?

1252
01:24:30,979 --> 01:24:33,854
Wasn't that the chronology
of the whole thing?

1253
01:24:33,937 --> 01:24:36,479
I don't know he changed the deal,

1254
01:24:37,062 --> 01:24:39,562
but it was my understanding
that Brennan

1255
01:24:39,646 --> 01:24:41,146
was speaking for himself.

1256
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:42,979
<i>That's an angry woman.

1257
01:24:44,062 --> 01:24:45,896
She was a teacher I think.

1258
01:24:46,396 --> 01:24:49,687
What we're looking at is this one.
This one is not approachable.

1259
01:24:49,771 --> 01:24:51,271
She'd be a tough nut to crack.

1260
01:24:52,604 --> 01:24:56,229
<i>...will hail, stop and search</i>
<i>all ships bound for Cuba.

1261
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:59,854
<i>If the ships' captains do not stop,</i>
<i>force will be used to stop them.

1262
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:06,687
Did you make this statement to
the Grand Jury? I'll read it for you.

1263
01:25:06,771 --> 01:25:09,854
"Brennan came to me and said words
to the effect he's going to go ahead..."

1264
01:25:09,937 --> 01:25:11,562
<i>He's got a restaurant.

1265
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:12,687
Any violations?

1266
01:25:12,771 --> 01:25:14,062
I'd rather stick with the women.

1267
01:25:14,646 --> 01:25:15,729
They're more approachable.

1268
01:25:15,812 --> 01:25:19,687
<i>...in Cuba of operational</i>
<i>medium-range missiles.

1269
01:25:19,771 --> 01:25:23,896
<i>If one of the missiles is launched,</i>
<i>it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.

1270
01:25:24,604 --> 01:25:28,854
<i>It could hit any spot in the southeast</i>
<i>United States, south of Washington.

1271
01:25:29,354 --> 01:25:33,104
<i>We would have no way of intercepting
it or issuing a warning about it.

1272
01:25:33,604 --> 01:25:36,562
This one's married to a 
State Trooper named Plechette.

1273
01:25:36,646 --> 01:25:37,937
That's good.

1274
01:25:38,771 --> 01:25:39,854
We know anyone?

1275
01:25:40,604 --> 01:25:43,396
We got an ex-cop, in the Local.

1276
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:44,604
That's good.

1277
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:46,937
<i>All our forces are 
on increased alert.

1278
01:26:09,521 --> 01:26:13,354
<i>...said he's going to go ahead</i>
<i>and set up a company to lease trucks.

1279
01:26:13,437 --> 01:26:16,396
But later, 
he phoned me and said, quote:

1280
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:20,687
"I got to change the deal 'cause I 
got to cut Hoffa in on the deal."

1281
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:21,896
Is that accurate, sir?

1282
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:24,312
This one's another possibility.

1283
01:26:24,896 --> 01:26:28,312
She's seeing her boyfriend
while she's still married.

1284
01:26:28,396 --> 01:26:30,646
So, maybe we could grab her,

1285
01:26:30,729 --> 01:26:31,812
hold on to her.

1286
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:33,104
But this guy,

1287
01:26:33,187 --> 01:26:36,104
the construction business.
He has some violations,

1288
01:26:36,187 --> 01:26:39,146
and there's a lien on his house.
His car

1289
01:26:39,229 --> 01:26:40,437
is unpaid.

1290
01:26:40,937 --> 01:26:44,229
That's good. Keep going.
Don't quit while you're ahead.

1291
01:26:51,146 --> 01:26:53,229
Thank you. See you, Big Eddie.

1292
01:26:53,312 --> 01:26:54,146
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,

1293
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:57,146
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1294
01:26:57,229 --> 01:26:58,187
I do.

1295
01:27:05,812 --> 01:27:07,187
Mr King,

1296
01:27:07,271 --> 01:27:11,646
you're a member of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, is that correct?

1297
01:27:11,729 --> 01:27:13,229
I respectfully decline

1298
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:15,521
to answer that under the

1299
01:27:15,604 --> 01:27:17,896
protection afforded me by the

1300
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:19,521
Fifth Amendment.

1301
01:27:19,604 --> 01:27:21,187
I just asked if you're a Teamster.

1302
01:27:21,271 --> 01:27:24,812
- I respectfully decline to answer.
- All right. Fine.

1303
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:26,896
I'm going to show you a photograph.

1304
01:27:26,979 --> 01:27:29,396
- I respectfully decline to answer...
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1305
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:30,437
.. under the protection--

1306
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:35,812
Look at the photograph, 
wait a smidge and then you can--

1307
01:27:35,896 --> 01:27:37,312
I want to avail myself

1308
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:41,854
of my right under the Constitution.

1309
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:43,437
Jim, let him avail himself.

1310
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:46,104
OK.

1311
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:55,646
That King's the best.

1312
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:58,146
He's the best. He's a good guy.

1313
01:27:58,687 --> 01:28:00,562
He really stood up to that jerk.

1314
01:28:01,021 --> 01:28:02,146
He was great.

1315
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:03,271
I love what he did.

1316
01:28:03,354 --> 01:28:06,271
They tried their best to get him.

1317

Well, I'll have to check my schedule.

1349

If you did go, and asked to speak,

Mr Hoffa,

01:31:00,937 --> 01:31:05,479
you stand here convicted of having
tampered with the soul of this nation.

<i>But there was still that 
jury thing in Nashville.

1362

The soul of this nation

1363
01:31:11,562 --> 01:31:14,229
lies in its sacred 
processes of justice.

1364
01:31:14,729 --> 01:31:16,354
Justice must be done.

1365

And for your wicked attempts to
corrupt these processes,

1366
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:23,229
justice will be done on you.

Where's Fitz? He's late.

1379
01:32:12,437 --> 01:32:14,729
We were going to 
meet him in the front.

1380
01:32:15,312 --> 01:32:17,979
- Here he is, here he is.
- Where the hell have you been?

1381
01:32:18,604 --> 01:32:21,146
What are you doing here?
Why did you come at all?

1382
01:32:21,812 --> 01:32:24,854
Are you aware you're late?
I want to know. You know you're late?

1383
01:32:24,937 --> 01:32:27,896
I'm sorry I'm late,
but we got a lot going on.

1384
01:32:27,979 --> 01:32:32,604
I don't want to hear that. I want to hear
something concrete, something straight on.

1385
01:32:33,229 --> 01:32:35,271
Just be a little more patient.

1386
01:32:36,312 --> 01:32:38,312
I'm inside here. 
I can't be too patient.

1387

I hate Dorfman. He's such a 
pain in the ass, fucking Jew.

1398

What do you want me to do?

No, not that. Not that.

1400

What you got to do,

1401
01:33:23,979 --> 01:33:26,437
put a firecracker up Dorfman's ass.

1402
01:33:27,146 --> 01:33:29,021
Fitz'll get the message.

1403

He'll get the message.

1404
01:33:31,312 --> 01:33:33,312
You can't do it to Fitz.

will run to the Feds
and screw up everything.

1407
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:39,437
But Dorfman...

1408
01:33:39,937 --> 01:33:41,312
You got to do it to Dorfman.

1409
01:34:19,896 --> 01:34:20,896
<i>Fitz.

1410
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:22,187
<i>Fitz got the message.

1411
01:34:25,479 --> 01:34:30,062
<i>After that, anybody who wanted anything</i>
<i>from the pension fund, they got it.

1412
01:34:34,437 --> 01:34:36,854
The thing keeps coming around.

1413
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:38,271
What's going on?

1414
01:34:40,521 --> 01:34:41,646
Who let you in?

1415
01:34:44,062 --> 01:34:45,104
Mr Provenzano,

1416
01:34:45,187 --> 01:34:48,396
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.
I have a warrant for your arrest.

1417
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:50,312
- Can I finish my hand?
- No, sir. Please stand.

1418
01:34:50,396 --> 01:34:51,896
I had a bad fucking hand anyway.

1419
01:34:59,104 --> 01:35:01,604
I got nothing in my pocket.
I got fucking shorts on here.

1420
01:35:01,687 --> 01:35:03,562
Look at this penguin over there.

1421
01:35:03,646 --> 01:35:05,604
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

1422
01:35:05,687 --> 01:35:06,896
Yeah, I'll get them, Tony.

1423
01:35:06,979 --> 01:35:08,812
This is like watching TV.

1424
01:35:10,021 --> 01:35:13,187
<i>They got Pro for extortion</i>
<i>and gave him seven years.

1425
01:35:14,312 --> 01:35:16,479
<i>They sent him to 
Lewisburg prison.

1426
01:35:16,562 --> 01:35:17,729
<i>So who does he end up with?

1427
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:19,562
<i>Jimmy.

1428
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:30,062
Look at that.

1429
01:35:30,146 --> 01:35:32,354
A work of art.

1430
01:35:32,437 --> 01:35:33,854
Thank you, Pete.

1431
01:35:41,771 --> 01:35:44,812
I got to talk to you about
a problem with my pension.

1432
01:35:48,062 --> 01:35:49,062
I know.

1433
01:35:50,187 --> 01:35:51,312
You know?

1434
01:35:52,104 --> 01:35:52,979
What do you know?

1435
01:35:54,562 --> 01:35:55,521
I know

1436
01:35:56,021 --> 01:35:57,729
you got a million-two,

1437
01:35:57,812 --> 01:36:00,229
and there's a problem with it.

1438
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:04,312
So you'll look into it for me?

1439
01:36:04,812 --> 01:36:06,979
How am I going to look into it?

1440
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:09,271
It is what it is.

1441
01:36:09,937 --> 01:36:11,062
Well, what is it?

1442
01:36:11,854 --> 01:36:12,896
You lost it.

1443
01:36:13,396 --> 01:36:16,771
You forfeited it when you 
came in here. That's it.

1444
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:20,354
So is yours forfeited too?

1445
01:36:20,437 --> 01:36:21,437
No.

1446
01:36:23,812 --> 01:36:26,937
Let me get this straight.
Yours is still there,

1447
01:36:27,437 --> 01:36:30,771
your million-five, whatever it is,
but mine's gone?

1448
01:36:31,937 --> 01:36:34,021
Yeah. Mine's still there.

1449
01:36:36,979 --> 01:36:38,479
But we're both in here.

1450
01:36:39,062 --> 01:36:41,021
We're both sitting here. 
That's right.

1451
01:36:41,104 --> 01:36:43,437
Only we're sitting here
for different things.

1452
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:46,562
You're sitting here for extortion.

1453
01:36:46,646 --> 01:36:48,854
I'm sitting here for fraud.

1454
01:36:49,437 --> 01:36:50,479
So?

1455
01:36:50,562 --> 01:36:52,562
So, there's a difference.

1456
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:53,687
What's the difference?

1457
01:36:56,937 --> 01:37:00,146
I didn't threaten anybody; you did.

1458
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:02,646
- That makes no sense.
- It does.

1459
01:37:02,729 --> 01:37:04,604
It doesn't. I don't want a debate.

1460
01:37:04,687 --> 01:37:07,187
- Think about it.
- I'm thinking about it.

1461
01:37:07,271 --> 01:37:08,437
Don't fuck with me.

1462
01:37:08,521 --> 01:37:10,354
Just do something about it.

1463
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:16,812
"Do something about it"?

1464
01:37:16,896 --> 01:37:19,562
- What am I going to do?
- There's always something.

1465
01:37:19,646 --> 01:37:20,937
It's federal law.

1466
01:37:21,021 --> 01:37:22,771
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

1467
01:37:22,854 --> 01:37:24,562
You can still do 
something about it.

1468
01:37:25,146 --> 01:37:26,937
What can I do?

1469
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:28,187
You can get my fucking money.

1470
01:37:28,271 --> 01:37:29,229
How?

1471
01:37:29,312 --> 01:37:30,562
- Some other way.
- What way?

1472
01:37:30,646 --> 01:37:32,104
The same way you got your money. .

1473
01:37:32,729 --> 01:37:34,146
Lower your fucking voice.

1474
01:37:35,062 --> 01:37:37,187
You telling me to lower my voice?

1475
01:37:37,854 --> 01:37:39,021
Cocksucker.

1476
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:40,521
Don't call me a cocksucker.

1477
01:37:40,604 --> 01:37:42,062
Don't you fucking dare.

1478
01:37:43,396 --> 01:37:45,104
Look, you're here for fraud.

1479
01:37:45,187 --> 01:37:46,354
You stole money.

1480
01:37:46,854 --> 01:37:49,604
I stole money. 
OK, in a different way.

1481
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:52,187
I want what I'm fucking owed.

1482
01:37:53,687 --> 01:37:55,479
You people. You people.

1483
01:37:55,562 --> 01:37:57,562
- What did you say?
- Oh, my God!

1484
01:37:57,646 --> 01:37:59,021
Come on, what I said.

1485
01:37:59,104 --> 01:38:00,771
What the fuck did I say?

1486
01:38:00,854 --> 01:38:03,729
"You people".
What does that mean, "You people"?

1487
01:38:03,812 --> 01:38:04,812
I'm done

1488
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:06,979
talking about this.

1489
01:38:07,604 --> 01:38:09,187
- You people?
- I'm done!

1490
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:10,104
You're done?

1491
01:38:17,062 --> 01:38:18,521
I'll fucking kill you!

1492
01:38:18,604 --> 01:38:21,312
I'll fucking kill you. 
Motherfucker!

1493
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:22,437
What the fuck, you...

1494
01:38:27,812 --> 01:38:30,687
Right then, you knew
it was all going to fall apart.

1495

I can't believe it. 
That is not right.

1518

And, growing up,
he kidnapped his own bosses.

That simple.

1521
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:34,021
When he went to the can, he recruited
black guys instead of his own kind.

1522

Don't shoot.

1544

You think he bought it?

1545

I was told, "Be very careful 
about what you say."

But all kidding aside,

You can't say

Why? Only Rickles can make jokes?

1558

The man's a boss.

1559
01:42:49,562 --> 01:42:52,312

We're all supposed to be brothers.

- Right, brothers.

1562
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,687
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

- We're brothers.
- I'm not arguing.

Everybody's a brother. 
You're a brother. You're his brother.

1565
01:43:03,396 --> 01:43:06,854
I'm not, but you guys are.
That's why I would like you to...

1566
01:43:06,937 --> 01:43:07,771
All right.

1567
01:43:07,854 --> 01:43:09,396
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

1568
01:43:09,937 --> 01:43:11,146
It's my birthday.

1569
01:43:11,229 --> 01:43:13,604
Happy birthday.

1570
01:43:16,062 --> 01:43:17,979
Get the fuck out of here.

1571
01:43:39,604 --> 01:43:43,354
<i>For something like this,</i>
<i>you're going to need two guns.

1572
01:43:43,437 --> 01:43:46,021
<i>The one you're going to 
use and a backup.

1573
01:43:46,771 --> 01:43:50,146
<i>You want something with more</i>
<i>stopping power than a .22.

1574
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:57,812
<i>You definitely don't 
want a silencer.

1575
01:43:57,896 --> 01:44:00,854
<i>You want to make a lot of noise,</i>
<i>so the witnesses run away

1576
01:44:00,937 --> 01:44:02,771
<i>and don't look at you.

1577
01:44:05,604 --> 01:44:09,812
<i>But a .45 makes too much noise,</i>
<i>and a patrol car

1578
01:44:09,896 --> 01:44:11,854
<i>can hear it a few blocks away.

1579
01:44:15,729 --> 01:44:18,271
<i>The cops call a .32 a woman's gun.

1580
01:44:18,354 --> 01:44:21,729
<i>It's easier to handle and 
don't do the damage a .38 does

1581
01:44:21,812 --> 01:44:24,062
<i>but, you know, it does enough.

1582
01:44:31,729 --> 01:44:35,687
<i>It would be late, 
so the tourists from Idaho

1583
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:38,146
<i>would be in bed.

1584
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:40,354
<i>And being in Little Italy,

1585
01:44:40,437 --> 01:44:43,396
<i>maybe he'd be more comfortable,</i>
<i>more relaxed.

1586
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:47,771
<i>It was his birthday,</i>
<i>so he'd be with his wife

1587
01:44:47,854 --> 01:44:50,104
<i>and his kid which, in this case,

1588
01:44:50,187 --> 01:44:52,479
<i>that's good because 
that's the point.

1589
01:44:52,562 --> 01:44:54,521
<i>They should see what it's like.

1590
01:44:56,312 --> 01:44:57,771
<i>He'd already been drinking,

1591
01:44:58,271 --> 01:45:00,271
<i>which would have</i>
<i>slowed him down a lot.

1592
01:45:01,437 --> 01:45:05,229
<i>His bodyguard would be with him and</i>
<i>Joey himself could be carrying, too,

1593
01:45:05,312 --> 01:45:07,979
<i>but the piece would be</i>
<i>in his wife's purse, probably.

1594
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:17,062
<i>You never got 
a lot of advance notice.

1595
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:19,604
<i>All you knew was your part of it.

1596
01:45:21,646 --> 01:45:24,229
<i>John the Redhead 
knew only one thing:

1597
01:45:24,729 --> 01:45:26,562
<i>he was going to drop me off,

1598
01:45:26,646 --> 01:45:27,562
<i>circle the block,

1599
01:45:28,396 --> 01:45:29,687
<i>and pick me up.

1600
01:45:37,854 --> 01:45:40,354
<i>You want to take out 
the bodyguard first.

1601
01:45:40,437 --> 01:45:43,396
<i>Not kill him.</i>
<i>Don't kill him, just disable him.

1602
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:47,937
<i>You got no argument with him, so,</i>
<i>not in the face or the chest.

1603
01:45:49,396 --> 01:45:52,104
<i>Sometimes with 
something like this,

1604
01:45:52,187 --> 01:45:54,687
<i>you might want to</i>
<i>go to the bathroom first,

1605
01:45:55,687 --> 01:45:58,271
<i>to be sure nobody 
followed you in,

1606
01:45:58,354 --> 01:46:02,437
<i>and to make sure nobody is in the</i>
<i>bathroom you have to worry about.

1607
01:46:03,021 --> 01:46:07,062
<i>And you should go to the bathroom.</i>
<i>You don't want to be uncomfortable.

1608
01:46:07,687 --> 01:46:12,729
<i>But I went before, and in a place this</i>
<i>small, you might as well just get to work.

1609
01:46:13,229 --> 01:46:14,521
We need more wine.

1610
01:46:15,104 --> 01:46:16,521
Hey, Tommy, some more wine.

1611
01:46:26,979 --> 01:46:28,062
Shit!

1612
01:47:04,396 --> 01:47:06,437
<i>It happened in 
New York's Little Italy,

1613
01:47:06,521 --> 01:47:09,812
<i>an area rumoured to be 
neutral territory among mobsters.

1614
01:47:09,896 --> 01:47:11,062
<i>After the killing,

1615
01:47:11,146 --> 01:47:15,062
<i>police found several guns and some</i>
<i>fingerprints which they were tracing.

1616
01:47:15,146 --> 01:47:18,979
<i>Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo had</i>
<i>come to the seafood restaurant

1617
01:47:19,062 --> 01:47:22,687
<i>to cap an evening of celebration</i>
<i>with his new bride

1618
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:25,479
<i>and his eleven-year-old daughter</i>
<i>by a previous marriage.

1619
01:47:25,562 --> 01:47:29,437
<i>They were celebrating</i>
<i>Joe's 47th birthday.

1620
01:47:29,521 --> 01:47:32,979
<i>They had been to a nightclub early</i>
<i>in the evening and were sitting

1621
01:47:33,062 --> 01:47:36,646
<i>at a rear table, 
this group of six,

1622
01:47:37,146 --> 01:47:38,271
<i>when a

1623
01:47:39,229 --> 01:47:40,312
<i>man walked in

1624
01:47:40,396 --> 01:47:43,729
<i>from the back door,</i>
<i>and he walked up

1625
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:47,771
<i>to the side of the table.</i>
<i>He fired three shots.

1626
01:47:47,854 --> 01:47:49,937
<i>He hit Joe twice,

1627
01:47:50,021 --> 01:47:51,271
<i>and he hit his bodyguard,

1628
01:47:51,354 --> 01:47:53,479
<i>Pete the Greek, one time.

1629
01:47:53,562 --> 01:47:56,021
<i>A total of fourteen 
shots were fired.

1630
01:47:56,104 --> 01:47:57,312
Peggy, come on.

1631
01:47:57,812 --> 01:48:01,271
<i>It's quiet here on 
President Street, Joey Gallo's turf.

1632
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:03,604
<i>In fact, it's too quiet.

1633
01:48:04,104 --> 01:48:06,729
<i>Out here in Brooklyn,</i>
<i>Joey Gallo was a hero.

1634
01:48:06,812 --> 01:48:10,396
<i>Speculation has it that his</i>
<i>death may start a gang war,

1635
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:12,354
<i>if it hasn't already begun.

1636
01:48:46,312 --> 01:48:48,521
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- You too, Mikey.

1637
01:48:48,604 --> 01:48:49,729
Take good care, Jimmy.

1638
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:51,812
If I don't see you again, hello.

1639
01:48:51,896 --> 01:48:52,979
<i>Four years later,

1640
01:48:53,062 --> 01:48:57,146
<i>and $500,000 under the table</i>
<i>to Nixon's re-election committee,

1641
01:48:57,229 --> 01:48:59,146
<i>Jimmy finally got 
what he wanted.

1642
01:48:59,229 --> 01:49:00,812
Sorry, but I won't be back.

1643
01:49:00,896 --> 01:49:04,062
<i>A Presidential pardon 
and his parole.

1644
01:49:05,771 --> 01:49:06,979
What are you going to do now?

1645
01:49:07,562 --> 01:49:09,896
The first thing I'm 
going to do is register

1646
01:49:10,396 --> 01:49:12,729
with the Federal 
Probation Office,

1647
01:49:12,812 --> 01:49:16,354
then I'm going down to Florida
with my wife to get some sun.

1648
01:49:16,437 --> 01:49:17,521
Any plans after that?

1649
01:49:17,604 --> 01:49:20,437
Yeah, take back 
control of my union.

1650
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:22,104
How will you do that, Jimmy?

1651
01:49:23,312 --> 01:49:25,979
- How do you like Fitz 
running against you?  - I don't.

1652
01:49:26,062 --> 01:49:28,146
What was it like being locked up?

1653
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:29,562
Wonderful. Had a great time.

1654
01:49:31,479 --> 01:49:32,646
<i>The first thing I did

1655
01:49:32,729 --> 01:49:35,021
<i>was pick us up some 
chilli dogs from Lum's.

1656
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,312
<i>Jimmy loved them</i>
<i>almost as much as ice cream.

1657
01:49:37,396 --> 01:49:41,021
<i>A consultant to President Richard 
Nixon's re-election campaign committee.

1658
01:49:41,104 --> 01:49:43,354
<i>The secret is they 
steam them in beer.

1659
01:49:43,437 --> 01:49:45,521
<i>It's the best 
hot dog in America.

1660
01:49:45,604 --> 01:49:49,687
<i>McCord and his accomplices 
brought listening devices

1661
01:49:49,771 --> 01:49:52,562
<i>with them and had removed</i>
<i>two ceiling panels,

1662
01:49:52,646 --> 01:49:55,312
<i>while installing</i>
<i>eavesdropping equipment

1663
01:49:55,396 --> 01:49:57,062
<i>at the Democratic 
National Committee.

1664
01:49:58,021 --> 01:50:01,146
Look at this. He's got the balls to
run for President of the Teamsters.

1665
01:50:01,229 --> 01:50:03,187
And Tony Pro giving him an award.

1666
01:50:03,771 --> 01:50:05,396
{\an8}This fuck. Do you believe it?

1667
01:50:05,479 --> 01:50:08,104
{\an8}Fitz is very popular 
with certain people.

1668
01:50:08,187 --> 01:50:10,021
Of course he's popular.

1669
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:12,562
He loans money to 
every goombah who asks.

1670
01:50:13,146 --> 01:50:15,937
That's why Tony's behind him.
He's given Fitz all his votes.

1671
01:50:16,021 --> 01:50:18,104
You got great support
from most of the union.

1672
01:50:18,187 --> 01:50:21,354
All you need is Tony Pro's
voters in the Northeast to win.

1673
01:50:21,437 --> 01:50:22,937
You want one of these?

1674
01:50:23,562 --> 01:50:27,562
I just can't believe I got to
go to Tony Pro to get votes.

1675
01:50:27,646 --> 01:50:28,646
What is that?

1676
01:50:31,062 --> 01:50:33,021
Tony has Fitz in his pocket.

1677
01:50:33,104 --> 01:50:34,687
Wiseguys don't run the union.

1678
01:50:34,771 --> 01:50:36,187
With Fitz they do.

1679
01:50:37,062 --> 01:50:39,604
Jimmy, once you're 
back as president,

1680
01:50:39,687 --> 01:50:40,812
you can do anything you want.

1681
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,479
You can fire anybody.

1682
01:50:42,562 --> 01:50:44,604
You can even fire Tony Pro.

1683
01:50:46,354 --> 01:50:48,687
You could stand over him 
as he clears out his desk.

1684
01:50:48,771 --> 01:50:50,646
You could strip-search the guy.

1685
01:50:51,354 --> 01:50:53,687
Make sure he doesn't walk off
with a paper clip.

1686
01:50:54,437 --> 01:50:55,729
See. Did you hear that?

1687
01:50:57,271 --> 01:51:00,229
Everybody thinks Jo's the nice one
and I'm the bad guy.

1688
01:51:00,812 --> 01:51:02,062
But it's opposite.

1689
01:51:02,812 --> 01:51:05,521
She's the killer, 
and I'm the sweetheart.

1690
01:51:06,937 --> 01:51:09,312
Now I have to make peace
with the cocksucker.

1691
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:12,187
"Oh, I want to make up with you.

1692
01:51:12,812 --> 01:51:15,562
I need you to endorse me. 
Please, Tony."

1693
01:51:19,521 --> 01:51:20,729
I'm not going to get through this.

1694
01:51:20,812 --> 01:51:22,687
You just got to talk to him. Just...

1695
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:24,687
- You got to deal with it.<i>
- Let the chips fall

1696
01:51:24,771 --> 01:51:27,104
<i>- where they may</i>.
- Oh, he is a cocksucker, though.

1697
01:51:28,062 --> 01:51:30,437
If I sat down with him
would you come along?

1698
01:51:30,521 --> 01:51:31,604
Of course.

1699
01:51:31,687 --> 01:51:33,229
How could I not go with you?

1700
01:51:42,812 --> 01:51:43,979
Fuck it. Let's go.

1701
01:51:44,062 --> 01:51:47,604
Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.
Give it a few more minutes.

1702
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:51,771
This isn't right.

1703
01:51:51,854 --> 01:51:55,104
You don't do this.
You don't keep a man waiting.

1704
01:51:55,187 --> 01:51:56,437
I know. I know.

1705
01:51:57,687 --> 01:51:59,604
The only time you do

1706
01:51:59,687 --> 01:52:02,021
is when you want to say something.

1707
01:52:03,312 --> 01:52:05,021
When you want to say "Fuck you."

1708
01:52:05,521 --> 01:52:06,812
That's the only time.

1709
01:52:08,104 --> 01:52:08,937
Here they are.

1710
01:52:10,979 --> 01:52:12,604
Can you believe this weather, Frank?

1711
01:52:13,354 --> 01:52:15,062
It's 85 degrees outside.

1712
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:17,771
Hey, Tony Jack.

1713
01:52:19,104 --> 01:52:22,437
People freezing to death 
in New York, and look at us.

1714
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:25,521
I don't know why we don't 
live here year-round.

1715
01:52:27,354 --> 01:52:28,604
It's summer.

1716
01:52:28,687 --> 01:52:29,521
What?

1717
01:52:30,229 --> 01:52:31,104
It's summer.

1718
01:52:32,271 --> 01:52:34,521
People aren't freezing 
to death in New York.

1719
01:52:35,937 --> 01:52:37,187
It's summer.

1720
01:52:39,437 --> 01:52:42,771
To me, it's always 8 degrees 
in New York. I'm making a point.

1721
01:52:43,271 --> 01:52:44,562
You're making a point.

1722
01:52:45,146 --> 01:52:46,937
Making a point 
dressing like that?

1723
01:52:47,521 --> 01:52:48,687
You dress like 
that for a meeting?

1724
01:52:50,562 --> 01:52:54,062
This is how you dress in Florida?
In a suit?

1725
01:52:54,146 --> 01:52:55,437
For a meeting?

1726
01:52:56,021 --> 01:53:00,771
Anywhere. Florida, Timbuktu,
I dress in a suit. For a meeting.

1727
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:02,521
And you're late.

1728
01:53:02,604 --> 01:53:03,896
What?

1729
01:53:04,396 --> 01:53:05,437
You're late.

1730
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:08,729
There was traffic.

1731
01:53:10,812 --> 01:53:11,979
Wasn't there traffic?

1732
01:53:12,062 --> 01:53:13,354
There was traffic.

1733
01:53:13,437 --> 01:53:14,604
What do you want from us?

1734
01:53:14,687 --> 01:53:16,521
It was bumper to fucking bumper.

1735
01:53:16,604 --> 01:53:17,896
It's bad, you know?

1736
01:53:17,979 --> 01:53:18,896
Traffic.

1737
01:53:19,729 --> 01:53:22,771
I never waited for 
anyone who was late

1738
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:26,021
more than ten minutes in my life.

1739
01:53:26,521 --> 01:53:28,354
Fifteen. Fifteen's right.

1740
01:53:28,437 --> 01:53:29,562
No, ten.

1741
01:53:30,771 --> 01:53:34,396
Ten's not enough. You have to 
take traffic into account.

1742
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:37,354
That's what I'm doing.
I'm taking traffic into account.

1743
01:53:38,021 --> 01:53:40,271
- That's why it's ten.
- I still say fifteen.

1744
01:53:40,354 --> 01:53:41,187
Ten.

1745
01:53:42,146 --> 01:53:44,271
Fine. We disagree on that.

1746
01:53:44,354 --> 01:53:46,312
How about twelve 
and a half minutes?

1747
01:53:47,354 --> 01:53:49,479
The middle. Right in the middle.
Beautiful.

1748
01:53:50,062 --> 01:53:51,229
More than ten,

1749
01:53:52,312 --> 01:53:53,729
you're saying something.

1750
01:53:54,687 --> 01:53:55,687
You saying something?

1751
01:53:55,771 --> 01:53:56,896
I'm here.

1752
01:53:58,104 --> 01:53:59,562
It says what it says.

1753
01:54:01,437 --> 01:54:02,604
There it is.

1754
01:54:04,104 --> 01:54:05,354
Where do we go from here?

1755
01:54:08,062 --> 01:54:09,771
Well, what can I do for you?

1756
01:54:12,937 --> 01:54:14,271
I want you.

1757
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:20,479
I want you to endorse me

1758
01:54:22,271 --> 01:54:24,104
for you know what.

1759
01:54:25,062 --> 01:54:27,812
Let's straighten
that other thing up first.

1760
01:54:27,896 --> 01:54:30,104
No. The other thing
is none of my business.

1761
01:54:30,187 --> 01:54:32,479
I can't do anything 
about your pension.

1762
01:54:32,562 --> 01:54:36,187
I can't. Not with Fitz in there.
Fitz is in there.

1763
01:54:36,271 --> 01:54:38,104
- You go to Fitz.
- I did.

1764
01:54:38,187 --> 01:54:41,021
I did. He said he'll take 
care of it, no questions asked.

1765
01:54:41,104 --> 01:54:43,021
You wouldn't do that, but he will.

1766
01:54:43,729 --> 01:54:45,312
I meant the other thing.

1767
01:54:47,104 --> 01:54:48,187
What other thing?

1768
01:54:48,271 --> 01:54:49,562
You know.

1769
01:54:49,646 --> 01:54:50,979
I don't know.

1770
01:54:51,062 --> 01:54:52,271
Your apology.

1771
01:54:54,437 --> 01:54:55,729
My apology?

1772
01:54:57,312 --> 01:54:58,646
My apology for what?

1773
01:54:58,729 --> 01:55:02,604
For what you said when you were eating
your ice cream like some fucking king.

1774
01:55:03,937 --> 01:55:06,437
That was an ethnic slur. 
"You people".

1775
01:55:07,271 --> 01:55:08,896
Did you know what he said?

1776
01:55:08,979 --> 01:55:11,354
I heard you had an 
altercation in the can.

1777
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:13,062
Yeah, "you people".

1778
01:55:14,437 --> 01:55:16,437
That's what you said. 
Right, Jim?

1779
01:55:17,771 --> 01:55:20,104
"You people". Am I beneath you?

1780
01:55:22,062 --> 01:55:23,312
Definitely.

1781
01:55:23,396 --> 01:55:24,729
Jimmy, come on.

1782
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:27,479
"You people" 
got you where you are.

1783
01:55:27,562 --> 01:55:29,354
Don't tell me that.

1784
01:55:29,437 --> 01:55:30,604
That's your problem.

1785
01:55:30,687 --> 01:55:32,896
Your problem is 
you're a piece of shit.

1786
01:55:32,979 --> 01:55:33,896
Jimmy, come on.

1787
01:55:33,979 --> 01:55:35,854
Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

1788
01:55:35,937 --> 01:55:37,937
I asked for your endorsement.

1789
01:55:38,021 --> 01:55:39,062
I asked for your apology.

1790
01:55:39,146 --> 01:55:41,521
Who the fuck 
are you to apologise to?

1791
01:55:42,896 --> 01:55:44,437
Who the fuck are you?

1792
01:55:45,437 --> 01:55:46,687
I don't need this.

1793
01:55:47,354 --> 01:55:49,312
I need this? I need you?

1794
01:55:49,396 --> 01:55:50,812
You need me.

1795
01:55:50,896 --> 01:55:52,354
Come on. 
You're asking for something.

1796
01:55:52,437 --> 01:55:55,479
The guy gets me nervous.
He gets me upset.

1797
01:55:55,979 --> 01:55:58,479
Everybody's here.
Let's have the fucking meeting.

1798
01:55:59,312 --> 01:56:00,896
Let's talk. That's all.

1799
01:56:00,979 --> 01:56:01,979
He's here.

1800
01:56:06,437 --> 01:56:08,021
Same altercation 
youse had in the can?

1801
01:56:08,604 --> 01:56:11,562
Yeah, something like this.
We got to arm wrestling.

1802
01:56:12,604 --> 01:56:13,437
He lost.

1803
01:56:13,521 --> 01:56:15,646
I lost. You should see his ribs.

1804
01:56:16,604 --> 01:56:19,937
Why don't you just talk about
what you need to talk about.

1805
01:56:20,021 --> 01:56:21,437
What do you want me to do?

1806
01:56:22,146 --> 01:56:25,021
I said "you people".
You want me to apologise for it?

1807
01:56:25,104 --> 01:56:27,729
That's exactly what I want. 
An apology.

1808
01:56:27,812 --> 01:56:29,562
I'll apologise for it...

1809
01:56:29,646 --> 01:56:30,812
That's all I want.

1810
01:56:32,521 --> 01:56:34,562
.. after you apologise

1811
01:56:34,646 --> 01:56:35,937
for being late,

1812
01:56:36,687 --> 01:56:39,062
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

1813
01:56:40,312 --> 01:56:42,479
Jimmy, you're out of 
your fucking mind.

1814
01:56:42,562 --> 01:56:46,771
I'll apologise after I kidnap your
granddaughter, rip her guts out

1815
01:56:46,854 --> 01:56:48,521
and send them to you 
in an envelope!

1816
01:56:52,854 --> 01:56:54,979
Get him the fuck off! Come on!

1817
01:56:55,062 --> 01:56:57,187
- I'll fucking kill him!
- Come on, Tony!

1818
01:57:02,937 --> 01:57:04,646
You think Russ would

1819
01:57:04,729 --> 01:57:06,604
do something about this guy?

1820
01:57:07,396 --> 01:57:09,062
That's complicated.

1821
01:57:10,146 --> 01:57:11,396
Yeah. It's complicated.

1822
01:57:11,479 --> 01:57:15,687
I'd like to clip the motherfucker 
myself, get the OK from them. But...

1823
01:57:16,354 --> 01:57:17,771
This guy's got to go.

1824
01:57:18,396 --> 01:57:19,562
He's got to go, Frank.

1825
01:57:20,271 --> 01:57:22,229
I won't get the OK to do that.

1826
01:57:23,604 --> 01:57:25,562
Frank, just talk to the guy.

1827
01:57:26,146 --> 01:57:27,729
OK? Just talk to him.

1828
01:57:36,521 --> 01:57:40,021
<i>The guys from Jersey called me about</i>
<i>this bullshit between these two guys.

1829
01:57:40,104 --> 01:57:42,562
I'm going to tell you the same thing
I told them.

1830
01:57:43,312 --> 01:57:45,854
I don't approve of what Pro said
about Jimmy.

1831
01:57:46,437 --> 01:57:49,312
Who talks like that about
a person's grandchildren?

1832
01:57:49,396 --> 01:57:50,729
It's not fucking right.

1833
01:57:56,521 --> 01:57:58,104
But Pro isn't nobody.

1834
01:57:58,771 --> 01:58:00,229
Jimmy should know that.

1835
01:58:00,812 --> 01:58:04,396
Hey, I can't tell this guy
what he can and can't fucking say,

1836
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:05,646
like he's a child.

1837
01:58:07,187 --> 01:58:09,104
Jimmy don't mean nothing.
He's just upset.

1838
01:58:09,187 --> 01:58:11,021
Russ, we all know 
he's a fucking hothead.

1839
01:58:11,104 --> 01:58:12,354
We all are sometimes.

1840
01:58:12,437 --> 01:58:14,771
But Jimmy says 
things he shouldn't say.

1841
01:58:14,854 --> 01:58:16,396
We all do that too.

1842
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:18,562
Well, somebody should 
calm him down.

1843
01:58:23,021 --> 01:58:26,812
Yeah, well, that... I'm going to... 
I'm going to calm him down. 
He's difficult, but...

1844
01:58:26,896 --> 01:58:28,812
Maybe this could 
help calm him down.

1845
01:58:28,896 --> 01:58:30,646
Tell him that I always liked him

1846
01:58:32,687 --> 01:58:35,771
and won't stand in his way 
trying to get his job back.

1847
01:58:35,854 --> 01:58:38,021
I will. I will tell him that, 
Tony. Yes.

1848
01:58:38,604 --> 01:58:40,604
That's not making me calm down.

1849
01:58:40,687 --> 01:58:42,021
Standing by me.

1850
01:58:42,521 --> 01:58:44,562
What the fuck does that mean?

1851
01:58:44,646 --> 01:58:48,146
Standing by me ain't the 
same thing as doing something

1852
01:58:48,229 --> 01:58:51,646
about some out-of-control
fucking psycho!

1853
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:55,229
The Little Guy ain't a nobody.
You got to understand.

1854
01:58:55,812 --> 01:58:58,687
He's a cocksucker. 
Fitz is a cocksucker.

1855
01:58:59,562 --> 01:59:01,646
I'm going to deal with
both these cocksuckers

1856
01:59:02,146 --> 01:59:03,187
myself!

1857
01:59:04,146 --> 01:59:06,229
This used to be my office.

1858
01:59:06,312 --> 01:59:07,771
Look for Frank Fitzsimmons there.

1859
01:59:08,354 --> 01:59:09,396
You're not going to find him.

1860
01:59:09,979 --> 01:59:12,479
That's because he travels
all over the country,

1861
01:59:12,562 --> 01:59:15,771
to every goddamn golf course,
because that's what he does.

1862
01:59:15,854 --> 01:59:16,937
<i>He plays golf.

1863
01:59:17,021 --> 01:59:20,812
<i>Who is he to run around with</i>
<i>Nixon and the Attorney General?

1864
01:59:20,896 --> 01:59:24,937
<i>He does this and collects a</i>
<i>full-time salary while he's doing it.

1865
01:59:25,021 --> 01:59:26,271
<i>Now how do you do that?

1866
01:59:26,354 --> 01:59:29,312
<i>There's not enough hours in a day.

1867
01:59:29,396 --> 01:59:31,562
<i>I was sent to prison for fraud.

1868
01:59:32,271 --> 01:59:33,479
<i>This is fraud.

1869
01:59:35,937 --> 01:59:38,229
<i>So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?

1870
01:59:38,312 --> 01:59:42,437
<i>He sends a message to Jimmy's</i>
<i>old friend, Dave Johnson.

1871
01:59:42,521 --> 01:59:45,854
<i>Now Dave Johnson, 
he ran Local 299.

1872
01:59:47,437 --> 01:59:48,979
<i>This was the message.

1873
01:59:53,187 --> 01:59:54,437
<i>So this is how

1874
01:59:54,521 --> 01:59:57,354
Fitz says he wants 
my old pal Dave Johnson

1875
01:59:57,437 --> 02:00:00,062
to step down, 
so he can have his son

1876
02:00:00,146 --> 02:00:02,396
take over Local 299.

1877
02:00:03,146 --> 02:00:05,521
This is how I'm going to 
say no to his son,

1878
02:00:05,604 --> 02:00:07,271
Little fucking Fitz.

1879
02:00:08,812 --> 02:00:11,771
She looked a lot like your mother.
About the same size.

1880
02:00:11,854 --> 02:00:14,229
Good-looking girl.
She was a good-looking girl.

1881
02:00:14,312 --> 02:00:17,687
But I had no idea that it 
wasn't your mother. It was dark.

1882
02:00:26,854 --> 02:00:30,562
<i>This is how Fitz says</i>
<i>he doesn't like who I say

1883
02:00:30,646 --> 02:00:31,937
<i>runs the 299.

1884
02:00:32,437 --> 02:00:34,062
<i>By firing my wife

1885
02:00:34,146 --> 02:00:38,104
from her forty-eight fucking
thousand dollar a year union job!

1886
02:01:21,187 --> 02:01:23,562
Son of a bitch. Fuck him!

1887
02:01:24,146 --> 02:01:28,312
<i>He had taped the lock on the entry door</i>
<i>of the basement of the Watergate.

1888
02:01:28,396 --> 02:01:29,521
What are you looking at?

1889
02:01:31,021 --> 02:01:32,104
It's Big Ears.

1890
02:01:32,729 --> 02:01:35,396
<i>He noticed that</i>
<i>the tape had been removed

1891
02:01:36,437 --> 02:01:38,771
<i>and he re-taped the door.

1892
02:01:39,479 --> 02:01:40,312
Big Ears?

1893
02:01:42,312 --> 02:01:43,979
Somebody I met a long time ago.

1894
02:01:46,521 --> 02:01:48,021
His ears ain't so big.

1895
02:01:49,146 --> 02:01:52,562
<i>I said, "Let us junk it",</i>
<i>meaning let us scrap the operation.

1896
02:01:53,146 --> 02:01:56,729
<i>Mr Liddy and Mr McCord</i>
<i>talked between themselves,

1897
02:01:56,812 --> 02:01:59,604
<i>and the decision was made to go.

1898
02:02:00,979 --> 02:02:02,937
<i>Do you feel Frank Fitzsimmons

1899
02:02:03,021 --> 02:02:05,437
should remain
president of the Teamsters?

1900
02:02:05,521 --> 02:02:06,354
Absolutely not.

1901
02:02:06,937 --> 02:02:11,146
{\an8}Frank Fitzsimmons has sold 
his union out to his underworld pals.

1902
02:02:11,229 --> 02:02:12,854
{\an8}<i>The Mob controls him,

1903
02:02:13,479 --> 02:02:16,562
{\an8}<i>which means it controls</i>
<i>our Pension Fund.

1904
02:02:16,646 --> 02:02:19,562
{\an8}<i>That's a billion dollars in 
low or no-interest loans

1905
02:02:19,646 --> 02:02:23,937
{\an8}<i>this man has given to known racketeers</i>
<i>for their illegal enterprises.

1906
02:02:24,021 --> 02:02:25,021
{\an8}<i>Not anymore.

1907
02:02:25,604 --> 02:02:28,521
<i>It's time for the 
rats to abandon ship.

1908
02:02:28,604 --> 02:02:29,687
Is he serious?

1909
02:02:30,354 --> 02:02:32,479
Not Jimmy. This is all publicity.

1910
02:02:32,562 --> 02:02:34,979
He's running for office. 
It's all a show.

1911
02:02:35,062 --> 02:02:37,312
It's all puff. It's got no substance.

1912
02:02:37,396 --> 02:02:39,312
Maybe he means what he says.

1913
02:02:39,396 --> 02:02:41,812
Tony, he's campaigning.

1914
02:02:41,896 --> 02:02:43,896
He's liable to say any fucking thing.

1915
02:02:43,979 --> 02:02:45,687
I don't care if he's campaigning.

1916
02:02:45,771 --> 02:02:49,396
- He can't fucking talk like that.
- I understand.

1917
02:02:49,479 --> 02:02:51,312
You know what he should do, Russ?

1918
02:02:51,396 --> 02:02:53,604
He should cash in 
that big pension of his.

1919
02:02:53,687 --> 02:02:55,896
Spend more time 
with his grandchildren.

1920
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,729
Got a beautiful family.

1921
02:03:00,396 --> 02:03:01,729
He should relax.

1922
02:03:03,896 --> 02:03:05,396
Word should get back to him.

1923
02:03:11,729 --> 02:03:13,021
<i>Don't take this

1924
02:03:13,104 --> 02:03:14,062
the wrong way.

1925
02:03:14,562 --> 02:03:17,312
I was with some people,
you know who they are,

1926
02:03:17,896 --> 02:03:19,021
they were saying,

1927
02:03:20,437 --> 02:03:23,271
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy.

1928
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:25,937
We don't want any problem.

1929
02:03:26,021 --> 02:03:27,771
We just think that he should

1930
02:03:28,729 --> 02:03:33,187
enjoy his grandchildren,
enjoy his pension, enjoy his life as is."

1931
02:03:33,271 --> 02:03:34,812
Go no further, Frank.

1932
02:03:36,729 --> 02:03:37,687
Who said it?

1933
02:03:39,062 --> 02:03:41,896
- It don't matter who said it.
- Oh, it matters.

1934
02:03:41,979 --> 02:03:43,146
Was it Russell?

1935
02:03:43,896 --> 02:03:46,604
Of course, it's not Russell.
It's that little cocksucker

1936
02:03:46,687 --> 02:03:48,562
from the Miami fiasco?

1937
02:03:49,854 --> 02:03:50,937
Not him. No?

1938
02:03:51,562 --> 02:03:52,687
Then who?

1939
02:03:55,271 --> 02:03:56,687
I'm going to tell you.

1940
02:03:56,771 --> 02:03:57,771
Tony.

1941
02:03:59,646 --> 02:04:00,896
Which Tony?

1942
02:04:00,979 --> 02:04:02,312
They're all named Tony.

1943
02:04:03,062 --> 02:04:06,604
What's the matter with Italians?
They can only think of one name.

1944
02:04:08,437 --> 02:04:09,646
It's the other Tony.

1945
02:04:11,396 --> 02:04:12,562
What Tony?

1946
02:04:15,479 --> 02:04:16,604
Salerno.

1947
02:04:25,187 --> 02:04:26,854
Well, what can I say?

1948
02:04:28,812 --> 02:04:31,104
I'm trying to help you.
I'm trying to tell you something.

1949
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:35,146
Frank, don't even think about it.

1950
02:04:35,771 --> 02:04:38,771
I don't keep 
my mouth shut for anyone.

1951
02:04:38,854 --> 02:04:42,354
I know that, you know that,
they don't know that.

1952
02:04:44,021 --> 02:04:47,479
That's who I am, that's what I am,
and that's what I'm going to do.

1953
02:04:49,104 --> 02:04:50,812
Somebody can tell him that.

1954
02:04:50,896 --> 02:04:52,187
He said that?

1955
02:04:52,771 --> 02:04:54,187
In so many words.

1956
02:04:54,771 --> 02:04:56,312
Before he says 
something like that,

1957
02:04:56,396 --> 02:04:59,729
he should remember that Joe Gallo
liked to make a lot of fucking noise, too.

1958
02:04:59,812 --> 02:05:01,437
You tell him that.

1959
02:05:01,521 --> 02:05:02,771
Who said?

1960
02:05:04,271 --> 02:05:05,729
- Tony.
- He said that?

1961
02:05:06,312 --> 02:05:08,104
Oh, that's it. That does it.

1962
02:05:09,562 --> 02:05:11,271
I'm never going to retire now.

1963
02:05:12,521 --> 02:05:13,396
Tell him that.

1964
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:15,687
Jimmy, I told him over and over.

1965
02:05:15,771 --> 02:05:18,396
You told him. 
Let's stop this. Forget it.

1966
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:19,437
Enough.

1967
02:05:20,354 --> 02:05:22,146
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

1968
02:05:27,771 --> 02:05:28,812
What's the matter?

1969
02:05:29,396 --> 02:05:30,271
Nothing.

1970
02:05:31,021 --> 02:05:32,521
- What?
- Nothing.

1971
02:05:33,104 --> 02:05:34,771
You're thinking something. What?

1972
02:05:38,771 --> 02:05:39,979
What are you doing?

1973
02:05:40,062 --> 02:05:42,021
- It ain't the right time.
- Not the right time?

1974
02:05:42,104 --> 02:05:43,854
What isn't the right time?

1975
02:05:43,937 --> 02:05:44,812
Say it.

1976
02:05:47,021 --> 02:05:48,979
The Local's putting together

1977
02:05:49,062 --> 02:05:51,687
a testimonial dinner for me and--

1978
02:05:51,771 --> 02:05:53,271
A testimonial dinner. Good.

1979
02:05:53,771 --> 02:05:55,812
But later. Later. 
Later, when you're...

1980
02:05:56,396 --> 02:05:57,312
What's the matter?

1981
02:06:01,646 --> 02:06:05,937
I was going to ask you if you
would present the award to me.

1982
02:06:09,187 --> 02:06:10,812
That's nice of you, Frank.

1983
02:06:10,896 --> 02:06:12,562
Really. That's nice of you.

1984
02:06:13,812 --> 02:06:14,854
Who's going to be there?

1985
02:06:16,021 --> 02:06:17,562
- Everybody.
- Tony.

1986
02:06:18,312 --> 02:06:21,312
Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony.

1987
02:06:23,229 --> 02:06:24,729
Everybody from Downtown.

1988
02:06:26,396 --> 02:06:31,062
It ain't a good idea. Everybody's going to
be there. You're going to be uncomfortable.

1989
02:06:31,146 --> 02:06:34,229
I don't give a fuck who's there.

1990
02:06:34,312 --> 02:06:35,729
Those cocksuckers

1991
02:06:35,812 --> 02:06:38,729
can't keep me from your big night.
There's no way.

1992
02:06:40,104 --> 02:06:41,562
I'm going to be there.

1993
02:06:42,062 --> 02:06:43,771
I'll be honoured to be there.

1994
02:06:43,854 --> 02:06:45,146
You deserve this.

1995
02:06:45,229 --> 02:06:46,854
Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you.

1996
02:06:50,312 --> 02:06:52,146
Oh, that Mo Dean.

1997
02:06:53,479 --> 02:06:55,021
- She's a good-looking broad.
- She's nice.

1998
02:06:55,104 --> 02:06:55,937
<i>I did not realise

1999
02:06:56,812 --> 02:06:58,812
that Mr Howard Hunt worked

2000
02:06:58,896 --> 02:07:01,937
{\an8}while he was at the White House
in the plumbers unit.

2001
02:07:02,021 --> 02:07:04,187
He's a rat, but that's, you know.

2002
02:07:04,271 --> 02:07:05,729
He's a smart rat.

2003
02:07:09,104 --> 02:07:10,646
We've got a great crowd

2004
02:07:10,729 --> 02:07:12,646
{\an8}for Frank tonight. 
Come on. Give it up.

2005
02:07:15,854 --> 02:07:20,146
That's because Frank is a man
with a lot of friends.

2006
02:07:22,812 --> 02:07:25,229
From his war buddies
who fought with him in Italy

2007
02:07:25,312 --> 02:07:27,604
under General George Patton,

2008
02:07:29,104 --> 02:07:30,437
to the drivers,

2009
02:07:30,521 --> 02:07:32,146
national organisers...

2010
02:07:38,896 --> 02:07:41,104
We are all friends

2011
02:07:41,187 --> 02:07:42,521
of Frank's tonight.

2012
02:07:43,062 --> 02:07:44,521
Friends of Frank.

2013
02:07:46,437 --> 02:07:49,271
Like NAACP president Cecil Moore.

2014
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:52,979
District Attorney 
Emmett Fitzpatrick.

2015
02:07:54,437 --> 02:07:56,604
Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo.

2016
02:07:58,729 --> 02:08:00,187
Hey, they like you, Frank.

2017
02:08:00,812 --> 02:08:04,771
And, of course, our featured speaker,
James Riddell Hoffa.

2018
02:08:12,437 --> 02:08:14,604
And outside in the trees,

2019
02:08:14,687 --> 02:08:16,312
we got the FBI.

2020
02:08:17,896 --> 02:08:19,062
Who wants to check on them?

2021
02:08:21,229 --> 02:08:24,937
The first time I met Frank, 
he took me out to a steak dinner,

2022
02:08:25,521 --> 02:08:27,479
and he asked me,
"How do you like your steak?"

2023
02:08:27,562 --> 02:08:29,437
I like it rare. He said, "Me too."

2024
02:08:29,521 --> 02:08:31,521
They bring out the steaks.
Mine's rare.

2025
02:08:31,604 --> 02:08:33,521
Frank's was walking 
from the kitchen.

2026
02:08:35,479 --> 02:08:39,521
He says, "Well, I'm an animal lover.
I don't want to hurt it."

2027
02:08:41,562 --> 02:08:42,896
He's an animal lover.

2028
02:09:07,437 --> 02:09:11,187
He's not even the damn president
and he's holding up people's loans.

2029
02:09:11,979 --> 02:09:12,937
You sure?

2030
02:09:13,021 --> 02:09:13,896
I'm sure.

2031
02:09:14,396 --> 02:09:16,812
- How's he doing this?
- His guys are holding back loans

2032
02:09:16,896 --> 02:09:19,104
on Carlos's hotel in New Orleans,

2033
02:09:19,187 --> 02:09:21,187
the add-on we're doing at Caesars.

2034
02:09:25,687 --> 02:09:27,312
What's Fitz doing all this time?

2035
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:29,937
He's supposed to 
help with this shit.

2036
02:09:30,021 --> 02:09:32,062
The money comes from the trustees.

2037
02:09:32,646 --> 02:09:36,354
They sign off on it. They're supposed
to rubber stamp what Fitz says.

2038
02:09:36,437 --> 02:09:37,604
Except Jimmy

2039
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:40,979
has a couple of them
to stop rubber stamping.

2040
02:09:42,604 --> 02:09:44,146
The son of a bitch.

2041
02:09:44,646 --> 02:09:46,271
I thought we took care of that.

2042
02:09:47,354 --> 02:09:48,854
He told somebody,

2043
02:09:48,937 --> 02:09:50,896
once Fitz is out and he's in,

2044
02:09:50,979 --> 02:09:52,937
he's going to call 
in the old loans.

2045
02:09:53,021 --> 02:09:54,271
Hotels,

2046
02:09:54,354 --> 02:09:56,646
casinos, real estate, 
whatever it is.

2047
02:09:56,729 --> 02:09:59,146
You don't have his money
and interest in two seconds,

2048
02:09:59,229 --> 02:10:00,354
he's taking them over.

2049
02:10:00,854 --> 02:10:02,104
We can't have that.

2050
02:10:04,396 --> 02:10:05,229
He said that?

2051
02:10:05,312 --> 02:10:06,312
He said that.

2052
02:10:06,812 --> 02:10:08,229
You sure he said that, Tony?

2053
02:10:08,312 --> 02:10:10,312
He said that. Everything

2054
02:10:10,396 --> 02:10:11,812
I'm telling you, he said.

2055
02:10:11,896 --> 02:10:13,937
Who does he think he is? Castro?

2056
02:10:39,437 --> 02:10:40,979
You don't need money, do you?

2057
02:10:41,062 --> 02:10:42,562
It's not about money.

2058
02:10:42,646 --> 02:10:47,854
If it's not about money, then I don't
understand what all the talk is about.

2059
02:10:48,521 --> 02:10:49,771
It's my union.

2060
02:10:50,896 --> 02:10:52,646
Is that hard to understand?

2061
02:10:52,729 --> 02:10:55,521
It's your union.
It'll always be your union.

2062
02:10:55,604 --> 02:10:57,312
You could step down 
and still run it.

2063
02:10:57,396 --> 02:10:59,312
You don't step down.

2064
02:10:59,396 --> 02:11:01,479
You don't step down to run a union.

2065
02:11:01,562 --> 02:11:03,229
You step down to go to your grave.

2066
02:11:03,312 --> 02:11:04,437
Well, listen.

2067
02:11:05,312 --> 02:11:08,479
I still think I can't help 
but think I'm sorry,

2068
02:11:08,562 --> 02:11:10,312
but is there another reason?

2069
02:11:10,396 --> 02:11:13,521
This is my union! What do you
mean "another reason"?

2070
02:11:14,562 --> 02:11:16,187
This is my union.

2071
02:11:16,271 --> 02:11:17,937
Let's start with that,

2072
02:11:18,021 --> 02:11:19,771
and then try to understand things.

2073
02:11:19,854 --> 02:11:21,812
Listen, some people,

2074
02:11:22,396 --> 02:11:23,604
not me, but

2075
02:11:24,104 --> 02:11:25,271
some people,

2076
02:11:25,854 --> 02:11:27,479
they're a little concerned.

2077
02:11:28,146 --> 02:11:31,062
Some people, not me,
they think that you might...

2078
02:11:31,687 --> 02:11:32,771
I might?

2079
02:11:32,854 --> 02:11:36,979
You might be demonstrating a
failure to show appreciation.

2080
02:11:39,521 --> 02:11:41,312
I'm not showing appreciation?

2081
02:11:41,896 --> 02:11:43,937
According to, 
you know, some people.

2082
02:11:44,021 --> 02:11:46,937
I went to school 
for five fucking years.

2083
02:11:47,021 --> 02:11:48,312
Yes, you did.

2084
02:11:48,396 --> 02:11:49,521
Five fucking years.

2085
02:11:51,021 --> 02:11:53,062
I didn't name one fucking name.

2086
02:11:53,146 --> 02:11:55,646
- You did the right thing.
- I did the right thing.

2087
02:11:55,729 --> 02:11:57,521
I sat there with that

2088
02:11:57,604 --> 02:12:01,771
whining cocksucker from 
New Jersey, talking to me

2089
02:12:01,854 --> 02:12:04,437
about his woes, his problems,

2090
02:12:05,229 --> 02:12:08,021
and all I wanted to do was
finish my ice cream in peace.

2091
02:12:09,521 --> 02:12:10,646
This cocksucker

2092
02:12:10,729 --> 02:12:13,854
shows up at a meeting
15 minutes late,

2093
02:12:14,896 --> 02:12:16,479
wearing fucking shorts!

2094
02:12:17,646 --> 02:12:20,104
- Who wears shorts to a meeting?
- Nobody.

2095
02:12:20,854 --> 02:12:21,812
Nobody.

2096
02:12:22,479 --> 02:12:24,271
I'm not showing appreciation?

2097
02:12:24,354 --> 02:12:25,354
It's not me.

2098
02:12:25,854 --> 02:12:27,187
According to some people--

2099
02:12:27,271 --> 02:12:29,521
I know it's not you. Some people.

2100
02:12:29,604 --> 02:12:32,062
Some people say
I'm not showing appreciation?

2101
02:12:32,146 --> 02:12:33,479
Well then, fuck them.

2102
02:12:34,396 --> 02:12:35,812
I'm trying to help you.

2103
02:12:35,896 --> 02:12:37,062
I know you are.

2104
02:12:37,604 --> 02:12:39,604
But nobody threatens Hoffa.

2105
02:13:01,104 --> 02:13:03,646
<i>He has done it as a driver.

2106
02:13:03,729 --> 02:13:04,896
<i>He has done it

2107
02:13:04,979 --> 02:13:06,854
as an organiser, and...

2108
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:09,937
I don't think many of you
know this, but Frank

2109
02:13:10,521 --> 02:13:11,604
holds a record.

2110
02:13:12,979 --> 02:13:16,187
It's most arrests 
on the picket line.

2111
02:13:18,021 --> 02:13:19,812
Twenty-six times

2112
02:13:20,479 --> 02:13:21,687
in 24 hours,

2113
02:13:22,271 --> 02:13:23,687
beating my record.

2114
02:13:26,562 --> 02:13:29,521
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no exaggeration.

2115
02:13:31,021 --> 02:13:32,812
He is a union man

2116
02:13:33,396 --> 02:13:34,937
to his bones.

2117
02:13:35,646 --> 02:13:37,312
Which side are you on?

2118
02:13:37,396 --> 02:13:38,854
Your side!

2119
02:13:38,937 --> 02:13:39,937
Whose side?

2120
02:13:40,021 --> 02:13:41,021
Your side!

2121
02:13:41,104 --> 02:13:42,146
My side.

2122
02:13:42,229 --> 02:13:43,146
Your side.

2123
02:13:43,229 --> 02:13:44,146
His side.

2124
02:13:45,479 --> 02:13:46,562
There it is.

2125
02:13:47,771 --> 02:13:50,562
It is an honour for me
to be here tonight

2126
02:13:51,146 --> 02:13:52,437
to present this award

2127
02:13:52,521 --> 02:13:54,687
to my dear friend,

2128
02:13:55,271 --> 02:13:56,937
Mr Frank Sheeran!

2129
02:14:06,312 --> 02:14:08,146
Thank you, Jimmy, 
thank you so much.

2130
02:14:09,604 --> 02:14:12,146
Thank you to my lovely wife Reenie,

2131
02:14:12,229 --> 02:14:14,187
for being here with me.

2132
02:14:14,687 --> 02:14:17,312
My lovely, sweet, 
adorable daughters,

2133
02:14:17,396 --> 02:14:18,437
Maryanne,

2134
02:14:18,937 --> 02:14:20,562
Dolores, Connie,

2135
02:14:20,646 --> 02:14:22,937
Peggy, for putting up with me

2136
02:14:23,021 --> 02:14:24,562
for all these years.

2137
02:14:25,771 --> 02:14:30,187
And, Jimmy, I can't tell you what this
means to me to get this honour from you.

2138
02:14:31,479 --> 02:14:34,229
It's the highlight of my life.
Thank you very, very much.

2139
02:14:34,812 --> 02:14:37,687
And this man, James Riddell Hoffa,

2140
02:14:38,187 --> 02:14:40,562
is the guy that gets the job done.

2141
02:14:43,021 --> 02:14:44,771
I'm behind you, Jimmy.

2142
02:14:44,854 --> 02:14:45,979
All the way.

2143
02:14:47,854 --> 02:14:51,479
In any case, from the deepest part
of my heart, I thank you all.

2144
02:14:51,562 --> 02:14:53,354
I don't really deserve all this.

2145
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:57,146
But I have bursitis
and I don't deserve that either.

2146
02:14:58,854 --> 02:15:01,229
Thank you all and 
thank you for coming.

2147
02:15:13,646 --> 02:15:15,646
What happened to "Say cheese"?

2148
02:16:32,687 --> 02:16:35,437
Only three people in the world
have one of these.

2149
02:16:35,521 --> 02:16:37,812
And only one of them is Irish.

2150
02:16:37,896 --> 02:16:39,271
I have one.

2151
02:16:39,354 --> 02:16:40,812
Angelo has one.

2152
02:16:43,229 --> 02:16:44,604
Now you have one.

2153
02:16:49,187 --> 02:16:50,479
This is beautiful.

2154
02:16:54,437 --> 02:16:57,354
I don't know
what to say, Russ. It's...

2155
02:16:58,521 --> 02:17:00,146
Slip it on. See how it looks.

2156
02:17:04,437 --> 02:17:05,937
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

2157
02:17:07,979 --> 02:17:11,021
You know how strong I made you?
You know how strong?

2158
02:17:12,729 --> 02:17:14,021
You're my kid.

2159
02:17:15,021 --> 02:17:17,062
Nobody can fuck with you.

2160
02:17:17,562 --> 02:17:18,604
Nobody.

2161
02:17:44,854 --> 02:17:45,854
Listen, Frank.

2162
02:17:46,687 --> 02:17:49,979
Things have gotten out of hand
with our friend again.

2163
02:17:50,812 --> 02:17:54,229
Some people are having
serious problems with him.

2164
02:17:55,021 --> 02:17:57,854
And it's at a point where

2165
02:17:57,937 --> 02:18:00,604
you're going to have to 
talk to him and tell him

2166
02:18:01,354 --> 02:18:02,896
it's what it is.

2167
02:18:05,562 --> 02:18:06,771
What it is?

2168
02:18:06,854 --> 02:18:08,729
Yes. It's what they want.

2169
02:18:09,312 --> 02:18:10,604
It's where it's gotten.

2170
02:18:12,146 --> 02:18:14,937
You're close to him.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

2171
02:18:15,021 --> 02:18:18,479
I talked to him.
He's a tough guy to talk to.

2172
02:18:18,562 --> 02:18:20,146
He has no choice.

2173
02:18:20,229 --> 02:18:21,812
He has no choice.

2174
02:18:22,396 --> 02:18:23,896
These are the higher-ups.

2175
02:18:25,854 --> 02:18:28,062
Well, he's a higher-up, too. No?

2176
02:18:29,104 --> 02:18:30,896
Not like this. You know that.

2177
02:18:31,479 --> 02:18:32,646
Come on, Frank.

2178
02:18:35,812 --> 02:18:39,854
If they can whack a president,
they can whack a president of the union.

2179
02:18:41,771 --> 02:18:44,354
You know it and I know it.

2180
02:18:54,812 --> 02:18:57,979
I talk, talk, talk to this guy.
He don't listen.

2181
02:18:58,062 --> 02:19:00,562
But he's got to listen now.
I got to make him listen.

2182
02:19:02,854 --> 02:19:06,229
That ain't right.
He's a fucking knucklehead.

2183
02:19:18,104 --> 02:19:19,729
I talked to Russ.

2184
02:19:19,812 --> 02:19:21,062
He talked to Tony.

2185
02:19:21,146 --> 02:19:22,396
He means what he's saying.

2186
02:19:23,312 --> 02:19:24,687
Who? Russ?

2187
02:19:24,771 --> 02:19:25,854
Tony.

2188
02:19:27,354 --> 02:19:28,896
I mean what I'm saying.

2189
02:19:29,771 --> 02:19:33,521
He can't seem to get that through
his fat fucking Sicilian head.

2190
02:19:34,437 --> 02:19:35,354
Don't worry.

2191
02:19:35,437 --> 02:19:36,771
What's the matter with you?

2192
02:19:38,271 --> 02:19:39,729
- I'm concerned.
- Yeah, I know.

2193
02:19:39,812 --> 02:19:41,354
What are you concerned about?

2194
02:19:42,396 --> 02:19:44,771
- They should be concerned.
- They are.

2195
02:19:45,354 --> 02:19:48,521
They're more than a little concerned.
There's widespread concern.

2196
02:19:48,604 --> 02:19:49,854
It's a big problem.

2197
02:19:51,271 --> 02:19:54,854
Tony told the old man
to tell me to tell you...

2198
02:19:55,646 --> 02:19:56,812
"It's what it is".

2199
02:20:01,062 --> 02:20:02,021
What it is?

2200
02:20:02,104 --> 02:20:03,312
It's what it is.

2201
02:20:07,104 --> 02:20:08,562
Please, listen to me.

2202
02:20:10,604 --> 02:20:12,229
They wouldn't dare.

2203
02:20:13,229 --> 02:20:14,354
They wouldn't dare.

2204
02:20:14,979 --> 02:20:16,437
Hey, Frank, come on.

2205
02:20:16,521 --> 02:20:18,021
Don't say they wouldn't dare.

2206
02:20:18,104 --> 02:20:20,146
Don't tell me that kind of...

2207
02:20:20,229 --> 02:20:21,312
That's fairy tales.

2208
02:20:21,396 --> 02:20:23,229
Don't say they wouldn't dare.

2209
02:20:24,062 --> 02:20:26,312
If something funny happens to me,

2210
02:20:28,187 --> 02:20:29,229
they're done.

2211
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:31,187
You understand that 
and they know it.

2212
02:20:31,271 --> 02:20:33,854
Because I got files. I got proof.

2213
02:20:33,937 --> 02:20:34,979
I got records.

2214
02:20:35,062 --> 02:20:38,187
Tapes. Any time I want, 
they'll be gone.

2215
02:20:38,271 --> 02:20:41,937
These Guinea motherfuckers will spend
the rest of their lives in jail,

2216
02:20:42,021 --> 02:20:43,562
and they know it.

2217
02:20:44,437 --> 02:20:45,771
They know it.

2218
02:20:45,854 --> 02:20:47,562
That's what they're 
concerned about.

2219
02:20:47,646 --> 02:20:49,104
I know things.

2220
02:20:49,187 --> 02:20:52,146
I know things 
they don't know I know.

2221
02:20:53,479 --> 02:20:55,062
You want to take that chance?

2222
02:20:55,146 --> 02:20:57,354
Why should I be taking a chance?

2223
02:20:57,437 --> 02:20:58,896
They're saying this is it.

2224
02:20:59,521 --> 02:21:01,104
They're saying this is it? It's it?

2225
02:21:01,687 --> 02:21:03,521
Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank.

2226
02:21:03,604 --> 02:21:05,104
I'm trying to tell you something.

2227
02:21:05,187 --> 02:21:08,896
You're telling me they're threatening
me and I got to do what they say.

2228
02:21:08,979 --> 02:21:11,896
It's more than a threat.
It's the bottom line.

2229
02:21:11,979 --> 02:21:12,937
The bottom line.

2230
02:21:13,729 --> 02:21:14,979
It's what it is.

2231
02:21:15,062 --> 02:21:17,896
They do something to me,
I do something to them.

2232
02:21:18,646 --> 02:21:20,562
That's all I know. Nothing else.

2233
02:21:23,479 --> 02:21:26,021
So what do I do? 
What do I tell McGee?

2234
02:21:26,604 --> 02:21:28,104
That you're not going to listen?

2235
02:21:28,187 --> 02:21:29,896
He ain't used to people
not listening to him.

2236
02:21:29,979 --> 02:21:31,062
Neither am I.

2237
02:21:32,854 --> 02:21:34,021
Neither am I.

2238
02:21:34,937 --> 02:21:36,146
Then I don't know what to do.

2239
02:21:36,229 --> 02:21:38,896
You should get some bodies
around for protection.

2240
02:21:39,396 --> 02:21:41,229
I'm not going to go that route.

2241
02:21:41,312 --> 02:21:42,812
Don't do this to me.

2242
02:21:42,896 --> 02:21:45,104
What do you mean, 
bodies around me?

2243
02:21:45,187 --> 02:21:47,854
You use bodies
then they go after your family.

2244
02:21:47,937 --> 02:21:50,062
It doesn't matter. You worried?

2245
02:21:50,146 --> 02:21:52,437
Get some bodies around you.
I tell you why.

2246
02:21:53,646 --> 02:21:55,104
This could happen to you.

2247
02:21:55,187 --> 02:21:57,229
They could come after you

2248
02:21:57,937 --> 02:21:59,229
since you're with me.

2249
02:21:59,312 --> 02:22:00,187
No?

2250
02:22:02,771 --> 02:22:03,854
I'm worried.

2251
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:06,604
Tell Russ I got nothing 
but respect for him.

2252
02:22:07,771 --> 02:22:09,312
We had a little trouble.

2253
02:22:09,396 --> 02:22:12,562
We were talking and I got 
a little crazy. You know me.

2254
02:22:12,646 --> 02:22:13,604
I just blow.

2255
02:22:13,687 --> 02:22:14,937
Sometimes.

2256
02:22:15,021 --> 02:22:18,312
I just walked away. 
But I get that way. I get abrupt.

2257
02:22:18,396 --> 02:22:21,062
Maybe you could tell him
how much I respect him.

2258
02:22:21,562 --> 02:22:23,521
I have nothing but 
respect for this guy.

2259
02:22:24,062 --> 02:22:25,687
I would never hurt him,

2260
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:28,729
no matter what I do with files,
or with anything.

2261
02:22:28,812 --> 02:22:30,187
But you should tell him.

2262
02:22:30,771 --> 02:22:33,354
- Yourself.
- I'm not going to tell him myself.

2263
02:22:33,437 --> 02:22:35,771
- It would go a long way.
- He's your rabbi.

2264
02:22:36,396 --> 02:22:38,229
Because of him you're here.

2265
02:22:38,312 --> 02:22:39,271
You tell him.

2266
02:22:40,104 --> 02:22:41,187
Listen to me.

2267
02:22:41,271 --> 02:22:43,729
At the end, there's only 
one thing that's real.

2268
02:22:44,812 --> 02:22:46,562
This is my union.

2269
02:22:48,396 --> 02:22:51,396
This is my union, Frank.

2270
02:22:53,771 --> 02:22:55,562
Very simple when 
you say it that way.

2271
02:23:01,146 --> 02:23:02,354
Peggy!

2272
02:23:02,437 --> 02:23:03,896
Shall we dance?

2273
02:23:04,479 --> 02:23:05,479
Excuse us.

2274
02:23:37,312 --> 02:23:41,354
<i>A few hours outside Detroit, 
we figured we'd spend the night,

2275
02:23:41,979 --> 02:23:43,729
<i>drive up in the morning.

2276
02:23:43,812 --> 02:23:45,312
<i>The wedding, that was the thing.

2277
02:23:46,354 --> 02:23:50,229
<i>Bill Bufalino was giving his 
daughter away to a hell of a guy.

2278
02:23:50,312 --> 02:23:52,771
<i>Better than the bum 
she was with before.

2279
02:23:52,854 --> 02:23:54,521
<i>And that was all well and good.

2280
02:23:55,521 --> 02:23:58,687
<i>But the wedding was really</i>
<i>a peace mission.

2281
02:23:59,687 --> 02:24:01,062
{\an8}<i>And that's what we were there for.

2282
02:24:01,146 --> 02:24:04,771
{\an8}<i>And everybody kind of knew that</i>
<i>we were there to straighten it all out.

2283
02:24:06,812 --> 02:24:08,396
I'm driving up with the old man.

2284
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:11,146
<i>He hopes we can 
work everything out.

2285
02:24:11,229 --> 02:24:12,771
- What did he say?<i>
- He said he hopes

2286
02:24:12,854 --> 02:24:16,646
we can straighten it out. After the
wedding, we talk, we straighten it out.

2287
02:24:17,562 --> 02:24:18,979
I'm not going to the wedding.

2288
02:24:19,062 --> 02:24:21,146
Too many people I don't like
will be there, so,

2289
02:24:21,229 --> 02:24:22,562
<i>I'm not going.

2290
02:24:22,646 --> 02:24:24,187
You're not going to the wedding?

2291
02:24:24,271 --> 02:24:25,271
I'm not going to be there.

2292
02:24:27,521 --> 02:24:30,521
Well, we could
we can do it anywhere you want.

2293
02:24:30,604 --> 02:24:32,479
We can do it at your house.

2294
02:24:32,562 --> 02:24:34,062
We can do it anywhere you want.

2295
02:24:34,146 --> 02:24:35,479
<i>Wherever you're comfortable.

2296
02:24:36,271 --> 02:24:37,312
The lake?

2297
02:24:37,896 --> 02:24:39,479
You want to do it at the lake?

2298
02:24:40,771 --> 02:24:43,646
From day one, 
I wanted to work this out.

2299
02:24:43,729 --> 02:24:45,062
I know.

2300
02:24:45,146 --> 02:24:46,687
From day fucking one.

2301
02:24:47,354 --> 02:24:49,271
Nobody knows better than me.

2302
02:24:51,271 --> 02:24:52,604
Just you two, right?

2303
02:24:52,687 --> 02:24:54,104
Not the Little Guy.

2304
02:24:54,604 --> 02:24:56,312
- Of course, the Little Guy.<i>
- No.

2305
02:24:56,896 --> 02:24:58,437
I'm not doing it with him.

2306
02:24:58,521 --> 02:24:59,854
There's no point 
just the three of us.

2307
02:25:01,104 --> 02:25:03,354
Just the three of us. That's it.

2308
02:25:03,437 --> 02:25:06,312
There's no point.
The Little Guy's got to be with us.

2309
02:25:06,396 --> 02:25:10,812
I'm not sitting down with that little
cocksucker again! I can't do it!

2310
02:25:11,479 --> 02:25:14,479
- You have to sit down with him.<i>
- We don't got to do anything.

2311
02:25:14,562 --> 02:25:18,604
This is a courtesy with these people.
A complete courtesy.

2312
02:25:18,687 --> 02:25:19,521
<i>I understand.

2313
02:25:19,604 --> 02:25:21,187
You got to move past that.

2314
02:25:21,271 --> 02:25:24,979
I am past it. I'm never seeing
that motherfucker again.

2315
02:25:25,062 --> 02:25:27,437
You got to sit down. 
Everybody says so.

2316
02:25:27,521 --> 02:25:31,979
There's no point. I don't want to 
do it and I'm not going to do it.

2317
02:25:32,062 --> 02:25:33,604
I'm going to hang up now.

2318
02:25:33,687 --> 02:25:35,604
Please. Understand this. OK?

2319
02:25:49,479 --> 02:25:52,062
- What did he say?
- He's thinking about it.

2320
02:25:52,604 --> 02:25:53,687
Thinking about it?

2321
02:26:01,729 --> 02:26:02,854
That's for you.

2322
02:26:10,562 --> 02:26:11,437
Well, that's good.

2323
02:26:11,521 --> 02:26:12,354
OK.

2324
02:26:25,562 --> 02:26:26,604
What time you got?

2325
02:26:28,229 --> 02:26:29,187
About five.

2326
02:26:32,937 --> 02:26:36,771
Give Jimmy a call. He said 
he was going to think about it.

2327
02:26:43,021 --> 02:26:44,021
OK.

2328
02:26:55,187 --> 02:26:56,646
So, when are you getting in?

2329
02:26:56,729 --> 02:26:58,021
Tomorrow morning.

2330
02:26:58,104 --> 02:26:59,979
<i>Oh, that's good. 
That's good 'cause

2331
02:27:00,562 --> 02:27:02,896
I changed my mind
about the other thing.

2332
02:27:04,354 --> 02:27:05,354
You did?

2333
02:27:06,271 --> 02:27:09,104
I'm going to meet with the 
Little Guy tomorrow afternoon.

2334
02:27:10,437 --> 02:27:12,937
- With the Little Guy?<i>
- Yeah.

2335
02:27:13,521 --> 02:27:15,854
Tony Jack set it up. I like Jack.

2336
02:27:15,937 --> 02:27:17,771
<i>Jack's good. 
I met with him a few times

2337
02:27:17,854 --> 02:27:19,646
after that Miami fiasco.

2338
02:27:20,229 --> 02:27:21,937
With the Little Guy. Where?

2339
02:27:22,521 --> 02:27:23,979
<i>Same place as before.

2340
02:27:24,562 --> 02:27:25,979
You know where it is.

2341
02:27:26,062 --> 02:27:27,021
In public.

2342
02:27:28,771 --> 02:27:30,812
You know Tony Jack 
is Pro's cousin?

2343
02:27:31,312 --> 02:27:34,479
Yeah. So? They're all fucking 
cousins. What're you going to do?

2344
02:27:35,396 --> 02:27:37,187
Jimmy, I think I should be there.

2345
02:27:37,271 --> 02:27:40,521
Yeah, I want you there. That's why 
I asked when you're coming in.

2346
02:27:41,187 --> 02:27:43,312
- What time's the meeting?<i>
- Two-thirty.

2347
02:27:43,396 --> 02:27:45,854
And he better not be late,
that cocksucker.

2348
02:27:45,937 --> 02:27:47,937
Or wearing those fucking shorts.

2349
02:27:48,021 --> 02:27:50,104
<i>I'm going to get there at two, so,

2350
02:27:50,187 --> 02:27:52,562
- you should get there at two.<i>
- I'll be there.

2351
02:27:52,646 --> 02:27:54,062
Oh, good. Good.

2352
02:27:55,104 --> 02:27:56,312
I'll see you at two.

2353
02:27:59,312 --> 02:28:00,354
See you at two.

2354
02:28:06,896 --> 02:28:07,979
What did he say?

2355
02:28:08,854 --> 02:28:10,146
He's going to meet with Pro.

2356
02:28:12,312 --> 02:28:13,646
Tony Jack set it up.

2357
02:28:14,146 --> 02:28:15,354
Very good.

2358
02:28:33,187 --> 02:28:34,354
We're starving.

2359
02:28:42,104 --> 02:28:45,854
This is the best move we've made,
getting this vinegar from Angelo's guy.

2360
02:28:48,104 --> 02:28:49,521
The Italian olive oil,

2361
02:28:49,604 --> 02:28:52,021
we got from that other mooch
wasn't bad, either.

2362
02:28:54,062 --> 02:28:56,437
Catania olives, what better.

2363
02:28:56,521 --> 02:28:57,354
The best.

2364
02:29:02,146 --> 02:29:03,854
There's been a change.

2365
02:29:04,437 --> 02:29:05,562
Instead of

2366
02:29:07,312 --> 02:29:11,229
going up early, we're going to hang
around tomorrow morning and then drive up.

2367
02:29:11,979 --> 02:29:14,312
But I told Jimmy 
that we were going to

2368
02:29:14,396 --> 02:29:15,729
be up in the morning.

2369
02:29:17,312 --> 02:29:20,146
I told Jimmy
we'd be up in the morning.

2370
02:29:20,646 --> 02:29:22,187
I know. I know.

2371
02:29:24,271 --> 02:29:27,896
That I would be there
for that meeting with Pro.

2372
02:29:27,979 --> 02:29:29,229
What?

2373
02:29:29,312 --> 02:29:31,646
That meeting with Pro.

2374
02:29:31,729 --> 02:29:33,021
I know. I know.

2375
02:29:37,187 --> 02:29:39,521
But what I...
What am I going to do?

2376
02:29:41,812 --> 02:29:45,021
We got to go there. I mean,
I got to go. I told him I'd be there.

2377
02:29:50,437 --> 02:29:52,521
We did all we could for the man.

2378
02:30:04,187 --> 02:30:05,271
Don't call him.

2379
02:30:42,271 --> 02:30:43,312
Good morning.

2380
02:30:46,937 --> 02:30:48,479
Want some coffee?

2381
02:30:48,562 --> 02:30:49,771
No, I got it here.

2382
02:30:51,562 --> 02:30:53,562
- How'd you sleep?
- Good. You?

2383
02:30:55,396 --> 02:30:56,396
All right.

2384
02:31:00,521 --> 02:31:02,312
Want Total or corn flakes?

2385
02:31:03,604 --> 02:31:04,479
Total.

2386
02:31:20,896 --> 02:31:23,229
We're going up to 
Port Clinton today.

2387
02:31:28,896 --> 02:31:30,646
I thought we were staying here.

2388
02:31:31,687 --> 02:31:33,437
No, the girls are staying here.

2389
02:31:34,271 --> 02:31:36,146
You and me, we're going up.

2390
02:31:37,687 --> 02:31:39,896
We'll be back three hours tops.

2391
02:31:43,854 --> 02:31:45,854
What's in Port Clinton?

2392
02:31:46,437 --> 02:31:47,479
A plane.

2393
02:31:51,229 --> 02:31:52,771
A plane? To where?

2394
02:31:53,437 --> 02:31:54,479
Detroit.

2395
02:32:01,979 --> 02:32:03,562
We're going to Detroit now?

2396
02:32:04,354 --> 02:32:06,729
No, you're going to Detroit.

2397
02:32:09,229 --> 02:32:10,604
And when you come back,

2398
02:32:11,104 --> 02:32:12,312
me and you,

2399
02:32:13,021 --> 02:32:16,187
together with the girls,
we take a nice slow drive up.

2400
02:32:17,021 --> 02:32:18,854
With cigarette breaks.

2401
02:32:32,062 --> 02:32:34,146
I had to put you into this thing

2402
02:32:34,937 --> 02:32:37,021
or you would never let it happen.

2403
02:32:37,896 --> 02:32:39,812
I know you wouldn't.

2404
02:32:45,062 --> 02:32:46,604
But it's going to happen.

2405
02:32:49,187 --> 02:32:50,312
Either way,

2406
02:32:51,021 --> 02:32:52,187
he's going.

2407
02:32:58,271 --> 02:33:00,687
I know how you feel, Frank. 
Trust me.

2408
02:33:00,771 --> 02:33:02,354
I know how you feel.

2409
02:33:03,979 --> 02:33:07,937
We tried everything to help him.
You know that.

2410
02:33:08,021 --> 02:33:09,437
You tried.

2411
02:33:12,021 --> 02:33:13,646
He brought this on himself.

2412
02:33:15,896 --> 02:33:17,979
And it's landing on us.

2413
02:33:21,562 --> 02:33:23,187
They only agreed to this,

2414
02:33:24,521 --> 02:33:26,354
out of respect to me.

2415
02:33:29,021 --> 02:33:31,062
But you and Reenie will be OK

2416
02:33:31,812 --> 02:33:33,187
'cause you're with me.

2417
02:33:38,146 --> 02:33:39,396
You're with me.

2418
02:34:18,604 --> 02:34:19,937
Give me your glasses.

2419
02:38:52,646 --> 02:38:54,104
Chuckie's late.

2420
02:39:47,854 --> 02:39:48,896
That him?

2421
02:40:02,687 --> 02:40:03,854
I'm Sally.

2422
02:40:09,021 --> 02:40:11,229
Let's go. Your father'll 
yell at me for being late.

2423
02:40:11,312 --> 02:40:12,729
Frank, you take the front.

2424
02:40:13,729 --> 02:40:14,854
What the fuck is this?

2425
02:40:16,312 --> 02:40:17,229
It's wet.

2426
02:40:17,854 --> 02:40:19,979
I had a frozen fish I had to

2427
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:22,146
deliver for a friend of mine.

2428
02:40:22,729 --> 02:40:24,021
A fish?

2429
02:40:24,104 --> 02:40:25,562
The seat is wet from a fish?

2430
02:40:25,646 --> 02:40:27,354
What do you want me 
to do about it now?

2431
02:40:27,437 --> 02:40:28,271
I'll sit in back.

2432
02:40:28,354 --> 02:40:29,729
No, you sit in the front.

2433
02:40:31,146 --> 02:40:33,021
I'll sit here. You take the front.

2434
02:40:33,687 --> 02:40:35,146
I'll sit there.

2435
02:40:38,312 --> 02:40:40,354
I'm not sitting there. 
I'm sitting there.

2436
02:40:42,812 --> 02:40:43,979
Sit where you want.

2437
02:40:46,771 --> 02:40:48,479
You want a newspaper, Frank?

2438
02:40:48,562 --> 02:40:49,854
Let's go. We got to hurry.

2439
02:41:03,937 --> 02:41:05,104
What kind of fish?

2440
02:41:07,312 --> 02:41:08,146
What?

2441
02:41:10,646 --> 02:41:12,104
What kind of fish?

2442
02:41:13,979 --> 02:41:16,854
I don't know. 
The kind you eat. A fish.

2443
02:41:17,937 --> 02:41:19,396
You don't know what kind?

2444
02:41:21,312 --> 02:41:22,771
No. I don't.

2445
02:41:23,896 --> 02:41:25,021
Where did you get it?

2446
02:41:26,146 --> 02:41:28,229
What the fuck. At a fish place.

2447
02:41:30,354 --> 02:41:33,729
Did you just go in there and say,
"Give me a fish?"

2448
02:41:34,812 --> 02:41:36,146
Pretty much. Yeah.

2449
02:41:37,729 --> 02:41:40,729
You didn't say you want a salmon,
you want a

2450
02:41:40,812 --> 02:41:42,062
haddock, you want

2451
02:41:42,771 --> 02:41:43,812
a fucking cod?

2452
02:41:43,896 --> 02:41:46,437
What the fuck does it matter
what kind of fish it was?

2453
02:41:47,062 --> 02:41:50,646
- Why are you so concerned? Zip!
- I'm just trying to understand

2454
02:41:53,312 --> 02:41:56,104
how a person can buy a fish
and not know what kind it was.

2455
02:41:58,437 --> 02:42:00,979
There was a fish 
waiting for me there.

2456
02:42:04,062 --> 02:42:07,229
I didn't ask what kind it was. 
I'm sorry.

2457
02:42:10,937 --> 02:42:13,146
So your friend
had already ordered this fish.

2458
02:42:20,187 --> 02:42:23,146
I want to be able to explain
this if somebody asks me.

2459
02:42:44,396 --> 02:42:45,271
Dad.

2460
02:42:47,229 --> 02:42:48,146
Chuckie.

2461
02:42:48,229 --> 02:42:50,437
- Sorry I'm late. I had to--
- Late?

2462
02:42:51,021 --> 02:42:52,687
What are you even doing here?

2463
02:42:52,771 --> 02:42:53,812
Who invited you?

2464
02:42:57,146 --> 02:42:58,812
Who the fuck are you?

2465
02:42:58,896 --> 02:43:00,312
I'm with Pro.

2466
02:43:00,396 --> 02:43:01,812
You're with Pro?

2467
02:43:01,896 --> 02:43:04,437
The cocksucker who just stood me up?

2468
02:43:04,521 --> 02:43:06,771
I wait only ten minutes for someone.

2469
02:43:06,854 --> 02:43:07,937
He's at the house.

2470
02:43:08,521 --> 02:43:09,646
What house?

2471
02:43:09,729 --> 02:43:10,979
With Russ.

2472
02:43:11,646 --> 02:43:13,146
Russ? What the fuck is...

2473
02:43:13,229 --> 02:43:14,396
Look who's here.

2474
02:43:16,479 --> 02:43:18,646
What the fuck is going on?

2475
02:43:18,729 --> 02:43:20,312
I was waiting for you.

2476
02:43:20,396 --> 02:43:22,187
You were supposed to show at two.

2477
02:43:22,271 --> 02:43:25,187
I'm sorry. McGee decided to come.

2478
02:43:25,271 --> 02:43:27,354
But he didn't want to come here.

2479
02:43:27,437 --> 02:43:28,479
He's at the house.

2480
02:43:28,562 --> 02:43:29,854
McGee's in Detroit?

2481
02:43:30,896 --> 02:43:32,229
He decided to come.

2482
02:43:34,812 --> 02:43:36,937
To help straighten this all out.

2483
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:39,479
The house?

2484
02:43:45,146 --> 02:43:46,771
We'll bring you back after.

2485
02:44:13,271 --> 02:44:14,937
There was a fish in here, but

2486
02:44:15,437 --> 02:44:16,729
we cleaned it up.

2487
02:44:16,812 --> 02:44:17,646
A fish?

2488
02:44:19,104 --> 02:44:22,687
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.
Didn't know what kind.

2489
02:44:22,771 --> 02:44:24,229
It's OK. I wiped it up.

2490
02:44:24,312 --> 02:44:26,896
- I got the handkerchief here.
- I can smell it.

2491
02:44:28,021 --> 02:44:29,854
You had a fish in your car?

2492
02:44:29,937 --> 02:44:31,437
For Bobby Holmes.

2493
02:44:31,521 --> 02:44:33,021
Bobby likes fish.

2494
02:44:33,604 --> 02:44:35,062
We cleaned it up, Jimmy.

2495
02:44:35,146 --> 02:44:36,437
You cleaned it up?

2496
02:44:36,521 --> 02:44:37,729
You cleaned it up?

2497
02:44:38,229 --> 02:44:40,021
What the fuck you know about fish?

2498
02:44:40,521 --> 02:44:42,521
You ever catch a fucking fish?

2499
02:44:43,396 --> 02:44:44,229
No.

2500
02:44:44,312 --> 02:44:45,979
Then you don't know.

2501
02:44:47,479 --> 02:44:51,604
Listen. Never put a fish in your car.
You never get the smell out.

2502
02:44:52,187 --> 02:44:54,146
Unless you pack it tight.

2503
02:44:54,229 --> 02:44:55,146
I know.

2504
02:44:55,229 --> 02:44:56,937
You know? Remember that.

2505
02:44:58,062 --> 02:44:59,479
It'll help you in life.

2506
02:45:04,937 --> 02:45:07,604
You couldn't come at two
and tell me this?

2507
02:45:07,687 --> 02:45:10,729
I was waiting there 40 minutes
like a fucking moron.

2508
02:45:10,812 --> 02:45:13,062
I'm sorry. 
I came as soon as I got here.

2509
02:45:13,146 --> 02:45:15,104
You got in this morning.

2510
02:45:15,187 --> 02:45:19,146
Russell had business in Port Clinton.
I had to wait for him.

2511
02:45:19,229 --> 02:45:20,854
He reminded me. I forgot.

2512
02:45:20,937 --> 02:45:24,646
As soon as we got here,
I came right here to see you.

2513
02:45:24,729 --> 02:45:26,854
All due respect to Russ, you know,

2514
02:45:27,687 --> 02:45:30,271
but somebody should 
have come tell me.

2515
02:45:30,771 --> 02:45:34,562
Just come tell me it's 2:30, 2:40,
at the very least.

2516
02:45:34,646 --> 02:45:35,646
Not incorrect.

2517
02:45:35,729 --> 02:45:39,896
And who the fuck is Pro?
Sending a fucking errand boy.

2518
02:45:39,979 --> 02:45:41,021
He ain't staying.

2519
02:45:41,104 --> 02:45:44,312
That's not the point he's 
staying or not staying.

2520
02:45:44,396 --> 02:45:45,896
The point is Pro sent him.

2521
02:45:47,354 --> 02:45:50,229
He should've picked me up himself.
That's the point.

2522
02:45:53,562 --> 02:45:55,479
Can you see out of those glasses?

2523
02:45:56,854 --> 02:45:58,437
I can't see a fucking thing.

2524
02:45:58,937 --> 02:46:01,229
That's good. 
I'm glad you're not driving.

2525
02:46:09,812 --> 02:46:11,312
Yeah, it's right... 
It's right up...

2526
02:46:11,979 --> 02:46:15,062
It's right up here. Right right up...
The building with the staircase.

2527
02:46:17,354 --> 02:46:18,562
You got your friend with you?

2528
02:46:21,396 --> 02:46:23,396
You never know with this cocksucker,

2529
02:46:23,479 --> 02:46:24,937
with or without Russ there.

2530
02:47:04,687 --> 02:47:06,437
Let's get outta here. Come on.

2531
02:49:42,021 --> 02:49:44,687
<i>James Hoffa, former president</i>
<i>of the Teamsters Union,

2532
02:49:44,771 --> 02:49:49,187
<i>disappeared on Wednesday.</i>
<i>No trace of him has been found.

2533
02:49:49,271 --> 02:49:53,021
<i>Hoffa spent four years in prison,</i>
<i>and made no bones about his intention

2534
02:49:53,104 --> 02:49:56,729
<i>to get the presidency back from </i>
<i> his successor Frank Fitzsimmons.

2535
02:49:59,229 --> 02:50:00,187
Still nothing?

2536
02:50:01,271 --> 02:50:02,604
<i>Young Fitzsimmons' car

2537
02:50:02,687 --> 02:50:04,479
<i>was bombed. He was not in it.

2538
02:50:04,562 --> 02:50:07,812
<i>But there is bad blood</i>
<i>in the Detroit Local.

2539
02:50:07,896 --> 02:50:10,771
<i>Hoffa disappeared 
Wednesday afternoon.

2540
02:50:10,854 --> 02:50:14,354
<i>Now, more than 48 hours later,</i>
<i>there's no word

2541
02:50:14,437 --> 02:50:15,812
<i>on what happened to Hoffa.

2542
02:50:15,896 --> 02:50:18,146
<i>Police are extremely concerned.

2543
02:50:18,229 --> 02:50:20,854
<i>Authorities are trying to find</i>
<i>whom Hoffa

2544
02:50:20,937 --> 02:50:25,271
<i>was supposed to meet outside the Red</i>
<i>Fox restaurant where he was last seen.

2545
02:50:25,854 --> 02:50:29,562
<i>Police think it could have been</i>
<i>Anthony Giacalone,

2546
02:50:29,646 --> 02:50:32,146
<i>a big man in the Detroit Mafia.

2547
02:50:32,229 --> 02:50:36,604
<i>Hoffa's son James tried to contact</i>
<i>Giacalone today, but didn't succeed.

2548
02:50:41,062 --> 02:50:42,437
I should call Jo.

2549
02:50:44,604 --> 02:50:46,354
You haven't called Jo yet?

2550
02:50:53,104 --> 02:50:53,979
Why?

2551
02:50:54,854 --> 02:50:55,729
What?

2552
02:50:56,854 --> 02:50:57,979
Why?

2553
02:50:59,437 --> 02:51:00,521
Why what?

2554
02:51:02,521 --> 02:51:04,062
Why haven't you called Jo?

2555
02:51:12,437 --> 02:51:13,854
I'm going to call her now.

2556
02:51:15,354 --> 02:51:19,604
<i>Do you think the abduction had anything</i>
<i>to do with the recent conflicts

2557
02:51:19,687 --> 02:51:21,646
<i>within Local 299, his own Local?

2558
02:51:21,729 --> 02:51:25,937
<i>I think the union politics </i>
<i> certainly has to be investigated.

2559
02:51:26,021 --> 02:51:30,187
<i>One high official of the Teamsters</i>
<i>says he fears the worst,

2560
02:51:30,271 --> 02:51:32,479
<i>that Hoffa may have been killed.

2561
02:51:33,187 --> 02:51:36,104
<i>Robert Hager, NBC News,</i>
<i>Bloomfield, Michigan.

2562
02:51:45,229 --> 02:51:46,646
<i>She stopped talking to me

2563
02:51:46,729 --> 02:51:47,896
that day.

2564
02:51:47,979 --> 02:51:50,479
August 3, 1975.

2565
02:51:52,229 --> 02:51:54,062
She's got a good job now

2566
02:51:54,146 --> 02:51:56,771
and lives just outside Philly.

2567
02:51:57,854 --> 02:51:59,312
But my daughter,

2568
02:52:00,229 --> 02:52:01,271
Peggy,

2569
02:52:02,271 --> 02:52:03,354
disappeared

2570
02:52:04,937 --> 02:52:06,521
from my life that day.

2571
02:52:13,562 --> 02:52:14,396
Hello.

2572
02:52:15,354 --> 02:52:17,021
Jo?

2573
02:52:20,771 --> 02:52:21,812
Yeah, Frank.

2574
02:52:28,896 --> 02:52:31,229
<i>Do you think he's alive?

2575
02:52:34,062 --> 02:52:35,187
He's got to be.

2576
02:52:36,729 --> 02:52:40,729
You know, you got to think positively.
It's just, it ain't that long.

2577
02:52:40,812 --> 02:52:42,021
<i>But do you

2578
02:52:42,521 --> 02:52:43,896
<i>know he's OK?

2579
02:52:43,979 --> 02:52:46,771
No, no, no, I mean, 
you know me, I...

2580
02:52:46,854 --> 02:52:49,896
Maybe he did something
like the Joe Bananas thing

2581
02:52:50,646 --> 02:52:53,271
and had himself kidnapped, 
and then

2582
02:52:53,896 --> 02:52:56,604
came back. But he wasn't hurt,
nothing happened.

2583
02:52:57,812 --> 02:53:01,229
Maybe he just wanted to
clear his head a bit.

2584
02:53:01,312 --> 02:53:03,104
You got to think 
that it's going to be

2585
02:53:03,937 --> 02:53:05,354
OK.

2586
02:53:06,146 --> 02:53:07,729
It's going to be OK.

2587
02:53:12,104 --> 02:53:14,812
If you need anything, 
I'm here for you.

2588
02:53:14,896 --> 02:53:16,771
Anything. Anything.

2589
02:53:18,021 --> 02:53:19,896
<i>Can you call me again?

2590
02:53:19,979 --> 02:53:22,062
Yeah, I'll call you.

2591
02:53:23,729 --> 02:53:25,187
Yeah, I'll call you.

2592
02:53:26,437 --> 02:53:28,146
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

2593
02:53:28,729 --> 02:53:30,437
<i>Yes, call me tomorrow.

2594
02:53:30,521 --> 02:53:32,729
I'll call in the morning, OK?

2595
02:53:32,812 --> 02:53:33,646
<i>Promise?

2596
02:53:33,729 --> 02:53:35,021
Don't worry. Be strong.

2597
02:53:35,604 --> 02:53:36,687
Be positive.

2598
02:53:37,979 --> 02:53:40,062
OK, OK.

2599
02:53:42,687 --> 02:53:44,604
Talk to you a little later. Bye.

2600
02:54:45,229 --> 02:54:47,896
It was no more complicated than that.

2601
02:54:50,396 --> 02:54:51,312
Mr Sheeran,

2602
02:54:51,979 --> 02:54:54,146
do you know who, if anyone,

2603
02:54:54,229 --> 02:54:57,062
was behind the disappearance
of James Hoffa?

2604
02:54:57,146 --> 02:55:00,562
<i>Everybody who ever had 
anything to do with Jimmy

2605
02:55:00,646 --> 02:55:02,396
<i>was hauled in and questioned.

2606
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:05,687
I respectfully decline
to answer that question

2607
02:55:05,771 --> 02:55:08,229
on the grounds that it
might incriminate me.

2608
02:55:08,312 --> 02:55:09,604
Let me ask you this:

2609
02:55:10,229 --> 02:55:11,604
What colour is my pen?

2610
02:55:14,187 --> 02:55:16,104
<i>And everybody took the Fifth.

2611
02:55:16,187 --> 02:55:17,229
<i>In that situation,

2612
02:55:17,812 --> 02:55:19,437
<i>that's what you do.

2613
02:55:20,021 --> 02:55:24,479
<i>Still, everybody got convicted</i>
<i>of one thing or another,

2614
02:55:24,562 --> 02:55:25,771
<i>but not that.

2615
02:55:25,854 --> 02:55:27,104
<i>Not about Jimmy.

2616
02:55:27,187 --> 02:55:30,229
<i>Nobody, as you know, even went to jail</i>
<i>for that.

2617
02:55:30,312 --> 02:55:32,854
<i>And nobody talked, which is unusual.

2618
02:55:32,937 --> 02:55:34,937
<i>Usually, three people 
can keep a secret

2619
02:55:35,021 --> 02:55:36,771
<i>only when two of them are dead.

2620
02:55:38,812 --> 02:55:41,312
<i>Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi

2621
02:55:41,396 --> 02:55:44,937
<i>got twenty years each for 
shaking down a trucking company.

2622
02:55:46,021 --> 02:55:47,604
<i>Pro was convicted with them,

2623
02:55:47,687 --> 02:55:51,687
<i>but he was already back in 
school for that other matter.

2624
02:55:51,771 --> 02:55:54,521
<i>That union Treasurer</i>
<i>Tony Three Fingers

2625
02:55:54,604 --> 02:55:55,896
<i>who got more votes than Pro.

2626
02:55:56,729 --> 02:55:58,104
<i>They got him on that.

2627
02:55:58,187 --> 02:56:01,104
<i>Sally Bugs, you know, 
he did that one.

2628
02:56:07,312 --> 02:56:10,771
<i>One day, Bugs was seen</i>
<i>walking into the Federal building.

2629
02:56:12,187 --> 02:56:13,854
<i>What he did ain't no crime.

2630
02:56:14,437 --> 02:56:16,812
A lot of people get 
called in for things.

2631
02:56:17,312 --> 02:56:19,146
But Sally knows better.

2632
02:56:19,646 --> 02:56:21,896
Why didn't he say 
anything to anybody?

2633
02:56:23,187 --> 02:56:24,979
He didn't tell anybody one word.

2634
02:56:25,979 --> 02:56:27,104
Not one word.

2635
02:56:28,312 --> 02:56:29,771
One thing for sure,

2636
02:56:30,771 --> 02:56:32,896
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

2637
02:56:46,062 --> 02:56:46,896
Sally.

2638
02:56:48,521 --> 02:56:49,604
Hey, Irish.

2639
02:57:01,937 --> 02:57:04,312
<i>Turns out Sally 
did tell somebody

2640
02:57:04,396 --> 02:57:07,354
<i>he was going there.</i>
<i>They just forgot to tell somebody else.

2641
02:57:07,437 --> 02:57:09,521
<i>So, it was a bad hit.

2642
02:57:12,354 --> 02:57:16,187
<i>Jimmy's son Chuckie, his foster son,</i>
<i>was in the thing, too,

2643
02:57:16,271 --> 02:57:17,562
<i>but he didn't know it.

2644
02:57:18,604 --> 02:57:22,437
<i>All Chuckie knew was he was 
picking up one of Pro's guys and me,

2645
02:57:22,521 --> 02:57:26,396
<i>and we was going to pick up his dad</i>
<i>at the Red Fox for a meeting.

2646
02:57:27,146 --> 02:57:30,729
<i>Well, he was in it, yeah,</i>
<i>you could say that, but stupidly.

2647
02:57:31,646 --> 02:57:36,229
<i>I always felt sorry for Chuckie</i>
<i>in this whole thing. And I still do.

2648
02:57:36,312 --> 02:57:39,687
<i>And the Feds gave him ten months for</i>
<i>some bullshit thing about a car

2649
02:57:39,771 --> 02:57:41,771
<i>and a... who knows what the fuck.

2650
02:57:44,021 --> 02:57:47,187
<i>Fat Tony Salerno,</i>
<i>they got on an income tax thing.

2651
02:57:47,979 --> 02:57:48,979
<i>A little after,

2652
02:57:49,062 --> 02:57:51,854
<i>he was diagnosed 
with prostate cancer.

2653
02:57:55,521 --> 02:57:58,521
There's a pork store up in

2654
02:58:00,646 --> 02:58:02,479
northern California.

2655
02:58:03,854 --> 02:58:04,979
Right around

2656
02:58:06,271 --> 02:58:08,646
Walnut Creek.
You're from up there, ain't you?

2657
02:58:09,271 --> 02:58:10,146
Yeah.

2658
02:58:10,771 --> 02:58:12,979
Maybe you know the guy that runs it.

2659
02:58:13,646 --> 02:58:15,979
Actually, I'm looking
for a little favour

2660
02:58:16,479 --> 02:58:18,104
for him, not for me.

2661
02:58:19,146 --> 02:58:22,812
But if you can get him a ticket,
like, to Australia.

2662
02:58:24,312 --> 02:58:25,646
You know what I mean.

2663
02:58:28,187 --> 02:58:29,062
Yeah.

2664
02:58:30,771 --> 02:58:32,812
Want to help him get down there?

2665
02:58:38,312 --> 02:58:39,479
Yeah.

2666
02:58:39,562 --> 02:58:41,229
<i>Now Russell got pinched

2667
02:58:41,312 --> 02:58:44,229
<i>for telling Jimmy The Weasel</i>
<i>to strangle Jack Napoli

2668
02:58:44,312 --> 02:58:48,479
<i>over a beef about 25 grand of 
jewellery that Jack took on credit

2669
02:58:48,562 --> 02:58:51,271
<i>from Russell</i>
<i>and then he never paid for.

2670
02:58:51,354 --> 02:58:53,979
<i>Now, with Russ, you don't do that.

2671
02:58:55,104 --> 02:58:58,229
<i>So, only thing is, The Weasel,</i>
<i>he flipped.

2672
02:58:58,312 --> 02:58:59,562
<i>He had a wire on him.

2673
02:59:00,062 --> 02:59:02,812
<i>They called it</i>
<i>"conspiracy to kill a witness".

2674
02:59:02,896 --> 02:59:06,437
<i>It was obvious to everybody else that</i>
<i>Napoli was clearly in the wrong.

2675
02:59:06,521 --> 02:59:08,229
<i>How could you not see that?

2676
02:59:08,312 --> 02:59:10,062
<i>He set him up. It was entrapment.

2677
02:59:10,146 --> 02:59:11,229
<i>What else could you call it?

2678
02:59:11,729 --> 02:59:14,854
<i>But that's another thing</i>
<i>I don't want to get into now.

2679
02:59:16,812 --> 02:59:19,521
<i>They charged me up with bribery</i>
<i>and labor racketeering

2680
02:59:19,604 --> 02:59:21,729
<i>and some other bullshit things.

2681
02:59:25,729 --> 02:59:30,021
Did Mr Boffa give you and 
your wife luxury vehicles?

2682
02:59:31,437 --> 02:59:33,312
I've worked for 44 years.

2683
02:59:33,396 --> 02:59:37,729
I never took one dime illegal 
off Boffa or nobody else.

2684
02:59:37,812 --> 02:59:39,229
You can think what you want.

2685
02:59:40,312 --> 02:59:43,312
<i>All they got me for</i>
<i>was blowing up a crane company

2686
02:59:43,396 --> 02:59:46,562
<i>that fired two of my shop 
stewards for no good reason.

2687
02:59:49,146 --> 02:59:50,812
<i>And my Lincoln.

2688
02:59:51,521 --> 02:59:54,104
<i>I bought that car 
from Eugene Boffa.

2689
02:59:55,104 --> 02:59:57,604
<i>He leased truck drivers</i>
<i>to freight companies,

2690
02:59:57,687 --> 03:00:00,354
<i>and then paid them</i>
<i>substandard wages.

2691
03:00:02,479 --> 03:00:06,021
<i>They said I paid a lot less for 
the car than what it was worth.

2692
03:00:06,729 --> 03:00:08,646
<i>They said the car was a bribe.

2693
03:00:14,937 --> 03:00:16,854
<i>I loved that car.

2694
03:00:17,521 --> 03:00:22,271
<i>But it wasn't worth the 18 years</i>
<i>they gave me for it. That's for sure.

2695
03:00:27,437 --> 03:00:29,812
{\an8}<i>Russell, he had a stroke.

2696
03:00:29,896 --> 03:00:33,562
<i>Fat Tony, he couldn't 
control his urine no more.

2697
03:00:33,646 --> 03:00:35,354
<i>And my arthritis,

2698
03:00:35,437 --> 03:00:40,646
<i>that started in the foxholes of Anzio,</i>
<i>was eating at my lower back,

2699
03:00:40,729 --> 03:00:43,229
<i>and I couldn't feel 
much in my feet.

2700
03:00:43,854 --> 03:00:45,271
<i>I needed a cane.

2701
03:00:45,354 --> 03:00:47,979
<i>But they won't give you 
a cane in the can,

2702
03:00:48,062 --> 03:00:50,687
<i>since you could 
use it as a weapon.

2703
03:00:50,771 --> 03:00:53,562
<i>The medicine Neurontin</i>
<i>helped me a little bit,

2704
03:00:53,646 --> 03:00:56,021
<i>but it made you loopy.

2705
03:00:57,396 --> 03:00:58,396
He's got it!

2706
03:01:00,021 --> 03:01:03,104
<i>We were all falling apart</i>
<i>in the freezing fucking cold.

2707
03:01:03,687 --> 03:01:04,854
You getting scared?

2708
03:01:04,937 --> 03:01:07,854
Yeah, you stay here another 
ten years, you'll beat me.

2709
03:01:17,187 --> 03:01:18,687
Is this the good grape juice?

2710
03:01:31,271 --> 03:01:32,771
I can't eat it.

2711
03:01:33,396 --> 03:01:34,687
I got no teeth.

2712
03:01:35,396 --> 03:01:36,437
Put a little piece.

2713
03:01:37,021 --> 03:01:38,354
Just a little piece.

2714
03:02:00,979 --> 03:02:02,562
Jimmy was a good man.

2715
03:02:03,312 --> 03:02:05,146
He had a nice family, too.

2716
03:02:09,437 --> 03:02:10,604
I know.

2717
03:02:12,229 --> 03:02:14,604
I never wanted it to go that far.

2718
03:02:23,896 --> 03:02:26,604
I picked us over him.

2719
03:02:27,479 --> 03:02:28,396
Fuck them.

2720
03:02:29,646 --> 03:02:30,521
Fuck them.

2721
03:02:32,687 --> 03:02:33,604
Fuck them.

2722
03:03:01,062 --> 03:03:02,229
Where you going?

2723
03:03:02,937 --> 03:03:05,354
- Where you going?
- To church.

2724
03:03:07,437 --> 03:03:09,146
Don't laugh, you'll see.

2725
03:03:09,229 --> 03:03:10,354
Don't laugh.

2726
03:03:10,854 --> 03:03:11,854
You'll see.

2727
03:03:19,854 --> 03:03:21,729
<i>Russell went to church.

2728
03:03:23,771 --> 03:03:26,854
<i>Then he went to 
the prison hospital.

2729
03:03:30,146 --> 03:03:32,562
<i>And then he went 
to the graveyard.

2730
03:03:35,229 --> 03:03:37,062
Lord Jesus Christ.

2731
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:40,396
<i>I got out that October.

2732
03:03:40,479 --> 03:03:42,437
<i>Reenie died in December.

2733
03:03:42,937 --> 03:03:45,437
<i>On December 23, to be exact.

2734
03:03:46,062 --> 03:03:47,146
<i>Lung cancer.

2735
03:03:47,646 --> 03:03:48,896
<i>No surprise.

2736
03:03:53,021 --> 03:03:55,979
Grant that our sister
may sleep here in peace

2737
03:03:56,062 --> 03:03:58,229
until you awaken her to glory.

2738
03:03:59,104 --> 03:04:01,729
For you are the 
resurrection and the life.

2739
03:04:01,812 --> 03:04:04,312
And then she will 
see you face-to-face,

2740
03:04:04,396 --> 03:04:06,437
and in your light will see light,

2741
03:04:06,937 --> 03:04:08,937
and know the splendour of God,

2742
03:04:09,437 --> 03:04:11,979
for ever and ever. Amen.

2743
03:05:50,771 --> 03:05:53,521
<i>Much to the frustration</i>
<i>of some policy makers,

2744
03:05:53,604 --> 03:05:56,437
<i>NATO military leaders 
will not risk

2745
03:05:56,521 --> 03:06:00,021
<i>low flying attacks on 
Serb troops in Kosovo.

2746
03:06:01,187 --> 03:06:05,229
<i>It could days more of systematic</i>
<i>bombing, especially since

2747
03:06:05,312 --> 03:06:08,979
<i>the Serbs have hidden so many</i>
<i>of their anti-aircraft missiles,

2748
03:06:09,062 --> 03:06:11,354
<i>in essence, 
daring NATO to fly low.

2749
03:06:34,729 --> 03:06:37,021
You go. You go there. Yeah, yeah.

2750
03:06:49,146 --> 03:06:51,854
Peggy. I just want to talk.

2751
03:07:15,521 --> 03:07:17,271
She walked away.

2752
03:07:17,979 --> 03:07:20,562
I know she's mad at me, 
but I want...

2753
03:07:20,646 --> 03:07:23,479
Call her. Call her.
I just want to talk to her.

2754
03:07:24,937 --> 03:07:26,729
Talk to her and tell her what?

2755
03:07:28,396 --> 03:07:30,896
I just want to say I'm sorry. 
That's all.

2756
03:07:32,354 --> 03:07:33,229
For?

2757
03:07:37,812 --> 03:07:40,896
I know I wasn't a good dad.
I know that.

2758
03:07:40,979 --> 03:07:43,479
I was just trying to protect her.

2759
03:07:43,562 --> 03:07:46,896
Protect all of youse.
That's what I was doing.

2760
03:07:48,479 --> 03:07:49,521
From what?

2761
03:07:50,521 --> 03:07:51,687
Well, everything.

2762
03:07:53,646 --> 03:07:56,312
Youse had a sheltered life,

2763
03:07:56,396 --> 03:07:58,771
in a way, because 
you didn't see what I see,

2764
03:07:58,854 --> 03:08:00,479
and what I've been through.

2765
03:08:03,021 --> 03:08:04,979
There's a lot of bad 
people out there.

2766
03:08:05,062 --> 03:08:06,562
What else am I going to do?

2767
03:08:07,521 --> 03:08:10,312
Daddy, you have no idea
what it was like for us.

2768
03:08:11,771 --> 03:08:15,229
We couldn't go to you with a problem
because of what you would do.

2769
03:08:15,312 --> 03:08:17,479
We couldn't come 
to you for protection

2770
03:08:17,562 --> 03:08:19,854
because of the terrible things
you would do.

2771
03:08:22,604 --> 03:08:26,604
I was just... I didn't want to
see youse get hurt, that's all.

2772
03:08:31,187 --> 03:08:34,229
I know you read a lot of things 
about me, heard about me.

2773
03:08:34,312 --> 03:08:35,479
I'm sorry.

2774
03:08:38,854 --> 03:08:42,146
Can I do anything to help 
and make it up to you?

2775
03:08:54,062 --> 03:08:56,271
If you want something
a little more luxurious,

2776
03:08:56,354 --> 03:08:58,479
we have these two models over here.

2777
03:08:58,562 --> 03:09:00,812
They're like the 
Cadillacs of caskets.

2778
03:09:01,312 --> 03:09:04,604
If we put you in the oven,
it doesn't matter what you go in.

2779
03:09:05,187 --> 03:09:06,604
The cheapest shit possible.

2780
03:09:06,687 --> 03:09:07,854
Particle board.

2781
03:09:08,604 --> 03:09:10,979
What are we doing today? 
A cremation?

2782
03:09:11,812 --> 03:09:12,812
A burial.

2783
03:09:14,271 --> 03:09:15,812
For a man or for a woman?

2784
03:09:15,896 --> 03:09:16,771
Me.

2785
03:09:17,896 --> 03:09:18,771
Shit.

2786
03:09:23,521 --> 03:09:24,854
You see anything you like?

2787
03:09:36,271 --> 03:09:37,437
That green one.

2788
03:09:37,521 --> 03:09:38,354
That's a beauty.

2789
03:09:38,437 --> 03:09:42,146
That one'll set you back 7,500
if you take it home today.

2790
03:09:42,937 --> 03:09:43,937
What do you think?

2791
03:09:45,521 --> 03:09:46,896
Can you do any better?

2792
03:09:48,396 --> 03:09:51,812
Buddy, this is what you want to
go home in, no?

2793
03:09:53,812 --> 03:09:56,396
We'll go six on that for you.
How about that?

2794
03:09:57,062 --> 03:09:59,646
- Six flat cash work for you?
- That's good.

2795
03:10:00,604 --> 03:10:01,604
Good for me.

2796
03:10:21,646 --> 03:10:23,229
<i>Sooner or later,

2797
03:10:23,312 --> 03:10:26,396
<i>everybody put here has a date</i>
<i>when he's going to go.

2798
03:10:26,479 --> 03:10:28,062
<i>That's just the way it is.

2799
03:10:29,271 --> 03:10:33,104
<i>And I think there's got 
to be something when you go

2800
03:10:33,771 --> 03:10:36,729
<i>'cause, I mean, 
how the hell did this

2801
03:10:36,812 --> 03:10:38,312
<i>whole thing start?

2802
03:10:42,271 --> 03:10:44,729
<i>People smarter than me</i>
<i>can't figure it out.

2803
03:10:44,812 --> 03:10:48,562
<i>That's why I would never go for</i>
<i>cremation. It's so final.

2804
03:10:50,771 --> 03:10:51,854
This one.

2805
03:10:53,521 --> 03:10:54,937
That's 1948.

2806
03:10:56,187 --> 03:10:59,437
<i>The hardest part for anybody</i>
<i>when they bury youse

2807
03:10:59,521 --> 03:11:02,229
<i>is when they go 
into the ground because

2808
03:11:02,312 --> 03:11:03,354
<i>it's so final.

2809
03:11:04,687 --> 03:11:08,812
<i>If you go into a building,</i>
<i>the building's there. The crypt is there.

2810
03:11:08,896 --> 03:11:10,604
<i>It has to be a metal casket

2811
03:11:10,687 --> 03:11:12,521
and they have you in the room.

2812
03:11:12,604 --> 03:11:13,937
And all that there.

2813
03:11:14,021 --> 03:11:15,896
It's just not as final. 
You're dead,

2814
03:11:15,979 --> 03:11:18,312
but it ain't that final.

2815
03:11:21,396 --> 03:11:22,396
I'm sorry,

2816
03:11:22,479 --> 03:11:26,937
but I got to direct youse
to my attorney Mr Ragano

2817
03:11:28,854 --> 03:11:31,271
if youse want to talk
about Mr Hoffa or

2818
03:11:31,979 --> 03:11:33,979
or any matter for that matter.

2819
03:11:34,062 --> 03:11:35,854
I got nothing new to say.

2820
03:11:37,062 --> 03:11:38,021
He's dead.

2821
03:11:39,021 --> 03:11:39,896
Who's dead?

2822
03:11:40,646 --> 03:11:42,187
Your attorney, Mr Ragano.

2823
03:11:42,271 --> 03:11:43,812
He's dead? Who did it?

2824
03:11:46,146 --> 03:11:47,354
Cancer.

2825
03:11:49,812 --> 03:11:51,729
Everybody's dead, Mr Sheeran.

2826
03:11:53,521 --> 03:11:54,479
It's over.

2827
03:11:55,187 --> 03:11:56,271
They're all gone.

2828
03:11:56,854 --> 03:11:58,479
Russell, Angelo, Salerno,

2829
03:11:58,979 --> 03:12:02,146
Pro, Dorfman, Sally Bugs. 
They're gone.

2830
03:12:04,062 --> 03:12:05,479
Who are you protecting?

2831
03:12:07,437 --> 03:12:08,812
You know who's not gone?

2832
03:12:10,396 --> 03:12:11,354
Mr Hoffa's family.

2833
03:12:11,437 --> 03:12:12,646
His children.

2834
03:12:13,354 --> 03:12:16,312
They're here.
And they got to live not knowing.

2835
03:12:17,937 --> 03:12:18,896
That's hard to do.

2836
03:12:21,979 --> 03:12:23,396
You got kids, Frank.

2837
03:12:24,187 --> 03:12:25,354
Can you imagine?

2838
03:12:30,979 --> 03:12:34,146
Frank, it's time.
It's time you say what happened.

2839
03:12:40,937 --> 03:12:42,937
You seem like nice fellas.

2840
03:12:43,771 --> 03:12:45,979
I appreciate youse coming to see me.

2841
03:12:46,479 --> 03:12:48,312
But I can't help you.

2842
03:12:52,062 --> 03:12:52,896
That's it?

2843
03:12:53,479 --> 03:12:54,312
That's it.

2844
03:13:01,062 --> 03:13:03,729
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God.

2845
03:13:04,937 --> 03:13:06,521
Pray for us sinners.

2846
03:13:07,521 --> 03:13:10,771
Now and at the hour of our death.

2847
03:13:11,271 --> 03:13:12,271
Amen.

2848
03:13:17,396 --> 03:13:20,312
That wasn't too bad. 
It's been a while.

2849
03:13:21,062 --> 03:13:22,021
Not bad at all.

2850
03:13:22,604 --> 03:13:24,729
And the intention was there.
The intention.

2851
03:13:26,479 --> 03:13:28,271
I know the intention was there.

2852
03:13:28,354 --> 03:13:29,771
It was there, Father.

2853
03:13:31,437 --> 03:13:33,062
Do you feel anything

2854
03:13:33,562 --> 03:13:35,562
for what you've done?

2855
03:13:39,187 --> 03:13:42,396
I don't.
I mean, maybe that’s

2856
03:13:43,646 --> 03:13:47,687
because I'm here now talking to you,
that that, in itself, is a,

2857
03:13:47,771 --> 03:13:50,771
you know, an attempt to...

2858
03:13:54,437 --> 03:13:57,771
But you don't 
feel anything at all?

2859
03:13:59,437 --> 03:14:00,604
No.

2860
03:14:02,979 --> 03:14:04,687
Water under the dam.

2861
03:14:09,229 --> 03:14:11,146
Any remorse

2862
03:14:11,896 --> 03:14:13,396
for the families?

2863
03:14:13,479 --> 03:14:15,979
I didn't know the families.

2864
03:14:18,937 --> 03:14:21,146
I didn't know them. 
Except one I knew.

2865
03:14:25,187 --> 03:14:26,062
You know,

2866
03:14:26,729 --> 03:14:29,687
I think we can be sorry.

2867
03:14:29,771 --> 03:14:32,979
We can be sorry
even when we don't feel sorry.

2868
03:14:33,479 --> 03:14:37,104
Well, for us to say, to make
a decision of the will, "God,

2869
03:14:38,104 --> 03:14:39,771
I am sorry, God.

2870
03:14:41,562 --> 03:14:42,729
Forgive me."

2871
03:14:44,521 --> 03:14:46,521
That's a decision of the will.

2872
03:14:54,229 --> 03:14:55,812
What kind of man

2873
03:14:57,312 --> 03:15:00,104
makes a phone call like that?

2874
03:15:05,687 --> 03:15:08,104
What do you mean? What phone call?

2875
03:15:09,021 --> 03:15:10,312
I can't tell you.

2876
03:15:12,562 --> 03:15:13,896
I can't. I got...

2877
03:15:19,771 --> 03:15:21,771
Frank, shall we pray again?

2878
03:15:23,521 --> 03:15:25,896
This time we'll do it
in our own words. OK?

2879
03:15:28,729 --> 03:15:30,646
God, we come before you,

2880
03:15:31,312 --> 03:15:33,646
sinful and sorrowful.

2881
03:15:33,729 --> 03:15:36,104
Sinful and sorrowful.

2882
03:15:37,229 --> 03:15:41,187
<i>We know you are all 
good and all merciful.

2883
03:15:45,896 --> 03:15:47,771
<i>We ask you

2884
03:15:49,062 --> 03:15:51,479
<i>to help us see ourselves

2885
03:15:54,229 --> 03:15:56,312
<i>as you see us.

2886
03:16:00,062 --> 03:16:01,812
That's my daughter Peggy.

2887
03:16:01,896 --> 03:16:02,729
Is it?

2888
03:16:03,396 --> 03:16:04,854
I haven't met her yet.

2889
03:16:04,937 --> 03:16:07,979
Well, she ain't been 
around too much.

2890
03:16:08,062 --> 03:16:09,521
Is she your only child?

2891
03:16:09,604 --> 03:16:11,479
No, I got four daughters.

2892
03:16:11,979 --> 03:16:12,937
Over there.

2893
03:16:14,021 --> 03:16:15,062
Beautiful.

2894
03:16:15,646 --> 03:16:16,729
Busy man.

2895
03:16:21,187 --> 03:16:22,354
Who's that with her?

2896
03:16:24,021 --> 03:16:25,437
You don't know who that is?

2897
03:16:27,479 --> 03:16:28,354
No.

2898
03:16:29,521 --> 03:16:30,646
Jimmy Hoffa.

2899
03:16:32,771 --> 03:16:33,812
Oh, yeah.

2900
03:16:33,896 --> 03:16:34,937
Right, "Oh, yeah."

2901
03:16:37,104 --> 03:16:38,562
You don't know who he is.

2902
03:16:38,646 --> 03:16:39,979
OK, I don't.

2903
03:16:41,062 --> 03:16:43,271
Yeah. Oh, boy, 
you don't know how fast

2904
03:16:43,354 --> 03:16:45,854
time goes by until you get there.

2905
03:16:46,437 --> 03:16:50,979
But you don't have to worry.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

2906
03:16:51,062 --> 03:16:52,771
Forever. It goes fast.

2907
03:16:54,937 --> 03:16:58,354
I'm trying to take your pulse,
Mr Sheeran. Please, don't talk.

2908
03:17:00,479 --> 03:17:01,854
It's great today.

2909
03:17:01,937 --> 03:17:03,437
I'm still alive?

2910
03:17:03,521 --> 03:17:04,854
Yes, you are.

2911
03:17:04,937 --> 03:17:06,229
That's good to know.

2912
03:17:06,312 --> 03:17:07,562
Alive and well.

2913
03:17:07,646 --> 03:17:08,854
And you're free

2914
03:17:09,437 --> 03:17:11,604
till later today,
when we do it all again.

2915
03:17:11,687 --> 03:17:12,646
I'm here.

2916
03:17:43,437 --> 03:17:45,812
Give thanks to the Lord, 
for He is good.

2917
03:17:47,354 --> 03:17:49,479
His mercy endures forever.

2918
03:17:50,062 --> 03:17:52,896
All right, Frank. 
I'll be back to visit very soon,

2919
03:17:52,979 --> 03:17:55,521
probably after 
the Christmas holidays.

2920
03:17:56,021 --> 03:17:56,979
OK.

2921
03:17:57,062 --> 03:17:59,646
- Frank, God bless you.
- You, too. Thank you.

2922
03:18:02,187 --> 03:18:03,271
It's Christmas?

2923
03:18:04,479 --> 03:18:05,646
Almost.

2924
03:18:06,521 --> 03:18:08,104
Well, I ain't going nowhere.

2925
03:18:10,687 --> 03:18:11,646
Hey, Father?

2926
03:18:12,812 --> 03:18:14,687
Could you do me a favour?

2927
03:18:15,271 --> 03:18:18,021
Don't shut the door all the way.
I don't like that.

2928
03:18:18,104 --> 03:18:19,812
Leave it open a little bit.
