1
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,958
This bread is very good.

2
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,041
Good, eh?

3
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,958
Where did an Irisher like you
learn to speak Italian?

4
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,166
In Italy—the war.

5
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,750
Where?

6
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,583
Salerno.

7
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,750
Anzio.

8
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,916
Sicily …

9
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,708
… around Catania.

10
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,291
Catania? I’m from Catania.

11
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,916
Yeah? I thought you had
an accent like Catania.

12
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,791
How long were you in the war?

13
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,666
Four years.

14
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,291
411 days in combat …

15
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,000
… 122 at Anzio.

16
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,291
Were you afraid of dying?

17
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,000
Always afraid.
