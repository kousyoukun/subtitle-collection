When I was young, I thought house painters painted houses.

53
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,620
我当时懂什么呢
What did I know?

54
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,370
我以前是个工人
I was a working guy.

55
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,790
南费城外卡车司机国际兄弟会 本地107工会的工会代表
A business agent for Teamster Local 107 out of South Philly.

56
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,370
上千名工人中的一名...
One of a thousand working stiffs...

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,750
后来我不再是工人了
until I wasn't no more.

58
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,750
再后来...
And then...

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,830
我开始亲自给房子...
I started painting houses...

60
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,910
刷油漆
myself.

61
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,870
在这件事当中 一切都以那场婚礼为由头
In this particular matter, the whole thing was built around the wedding.

62
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,120
那时候比尔布法利诺的女儿 快要在底特律结婚
Bill Bufalino's daughter was getting married in Detroit.

63
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,750
比尔是工会律师 但更重要的是
Bill was a Teamster lawyer, but more important,

64
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,700
他是罗素布法利诺的表弟
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,500
罗素不想坐飞机
Russell didn't want to fly,

66
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,830
所以我要开车送他去参加婚礼
so I was gonna drive him to the wedding.

67
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,620
他想在路上 顺便处理一些生意上的事
He wanted to take care of some business along the way,

68
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,750
罗素所说的生意上的事是指一件事
which in Russell's case meant only one thing:

69
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,330
钱...收钱
Money... collecting it.

70
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,750
所以我们开车出发了
So, we'd drive.

71
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,700
他和他妻子凯莉 加上我跟我老婆艾琳
Him and his wife Carrie and me and my wife Irene.

72
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,250
我叫她琳妮
I call her Reenie.

73
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,950
我计划走476号州际公路出费城
I figured we would take 476 out of Philly,

74
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,410
然后北上开到皮茨顿
then up to Pittston

75
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,660
接罗素 我们事实上也是这么做的
and pick up Russ which is what we did,

76
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,410
然后走80号州际公路往西
and then Interstate 80 West...

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,870
借道宾夕法尼亚州 再直穿俄亥俄州去到托莱多
through Pennsylvania, and then across Ohio to Toledo,

78
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,620
然后走75号公路往北去底特律
and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,620
加上公事停留和下车抽烟的时间 整段路程大概需要花三天
It would take about three days with all the business breaks and cigarette stops.

80
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,910
罗素不准任何人在车里吸烟
Russell didn't allow nobody to smoke in the car.

81
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,750
他说黑帮老大 蓝眼吉米跟迈尔兰斯基
He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky

82
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,330
和他一起 从他们在古巴的赌场被踢出来
convinced him to stop smoking when they were kicked out

83
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,540
并被卡斯特罗枪袭时 说服他戒了烟
of their casinos in Cuba and getting shot at by Castro.

84
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,250
我不知道 可能当时的情况是
I don't know. Maybe it was:

85
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,750
"祈求上帝 如果我能活着从这里逃出去
"Please-God-if-I-ever-get-out-of-this-fucking-thing-alive-

86
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,580
就再也不抽烟"
-I'll-never-smoke-again."

87
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,410
但我确定
But I do know that,

88
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,750
卡斯特罗那件事后 罗素就不允许 任何人在他车里抽烟 连凯莉也不准
from Castro on, Russ wouldn't allow nobody to smoke in his car, not even Carrie.

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
等会儿能不能停一下
Can we stop soon?

90
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,660
我们才刚上车没多久 宝贝
We're only in the car two minutes, honey.

91
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,000
离高速公路还远着呢
We're not even near the highway.

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,040
我知道 但你不喜欢在高速公路上停车
I know. But you don't like to stop on the highway.

93
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,910
不完全是那样 他们根本就不让你在高速上停车
It's not that so much. They don't let you stop on the highway.

94
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,250
行 那我们就在车里抽烟
Okay, so then we'll smoke in the car.

95
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,330
我的白内障怎么办
What about my cataracts?

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,660
我会把窗户砸了
I'll crack the window.

97
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,910
凯莉
Carrie,

98
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,540
我发过誓 记得吗
I made a vow. Remember?

99
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,450
记得我发过誓吗 凯莉
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

100
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,700
记得 现在我不能抽烟
Yeah, now I can't smoke.

101
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,950
好吧 现在连我也不能抽烟了
All right, and now I can't smoke.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
看看咱们在哪里
See where we are?

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,950
是那里吗
Is that?

104
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,290
竟然这么凑巧
What are those odds?

105
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,410
车子出了什么故障 年轻人
What's the problem, kid?

106
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,790
我...不知道 发动机的声音很怪 突然抛锚 突然开动 动力不足
I don't... I don't know. It sounds funny. It stops, it starts, it loses power.

107
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,200
我看看能不能帮你一下
Let me see if I can give you a hand.

108
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,580
检查所有这些塞子
Check all these plugs.

109
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,080
火花塞没问题
Spark plugs are okay.

110
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,870
分电器盖正常
The distributor cap's okay.

111
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,790
肯定是这个出了问题
It's gotta be something with with this.

112
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,830
是同步带
Timing chain.

113
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,250
就是这个造成的 上面有个盖子
This is what this is. There's a cap on it.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,830
这盖子松了 不应该是这样的
This cap is loose. It ain't supposed to be loose.

115
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,950
也就是说带子磨损了
So that means they're getting worn out.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,160
现在试一试 把它拧紧了
Try that now. Tighten It up.

117
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,290
行吗
All right?

118
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,870
我会开车 但不会修车
I can drive 'em. I can't fix 'em.

119
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,370
你可以开工了 年轻人
You're back in business, kid.

120
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,330
该怎么谢你
I owe you anything?

121
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,700
不 不需要谢我 没关系
No, you don't owe me anything. It's all right.

122
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,160
-我叫法兰克   -嘿 法兰克 你好吗
-Frank.   -Hey, Frank. How ya doing?

123
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
怎么称呼你
What's your name?

124
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,620
你是哪里人
Where you from?

125
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,410
-费城   -你是费城人
-Philly.   -Oh, you're from Philly.

126
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,950
你都在费城哪些地方玩
Where you hang out there?

127
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,950
卡拉汉家
Callahan's.

128
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,370
滚球俱乐部 其实是个酒吧 不是真正的滚球俱乐部
Bocce Club. It's a bar not a bocce club.

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,830
这样啊 你玩滚球
Oh, yeah. You play bocce?

130
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,040
不玩
Nah.

131
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,200
好了 法兰克 得让人把那个修好
All right, Frankie, get that fixed.

132
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,620
-因为它还会发生故障的   -谢谢
-Because it'll go again on you.   -Thank you.

133
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,750
-我会的 再次感谢   -祝好运 老弟
-I will. Thanks again.   -Good luck, buddy.

134
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,700
我以为也许
I thought maybe he owned

135
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,160
他是那间加油站的老板
the gas station.

136
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,120
你能看得出来 他肯定是老板一类的
He owned something, you could tell.

137
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,660
是啊 原来那整条马路都是他的
Yeah, it turns out he owned the whole road.

138
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,200
这只
This one?

139
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,500
干了 伙计们
Drink up, fellas.

140
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
上帝保佑
God bless.

141
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,160
喝吧 让我们赚点钱
Let's go. Let's make some money.

142
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,120
这是家酒吧
It's a bar.

向你老婆问好
Say hello to your wife.

144
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,750
我有办法推销那些后躯肉块
I got a way we can push those hindquarters.

145
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,500
这里有个人愿意为那个付大价钱
There's a guy in here, he'll pay a lot of money for them.

146
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,290
先干了这杯再说
Let's shoot this first.

147
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,080
吧台另一边 12点钟方向
At the other end of the bar at twelve o'clock.

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,040
发际线很高那个
He's got a rescinding hairline.

149
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,200
你跟他做生意能发大财
You'll make a lot of money with him.

150
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,290
瘦子剃刀 这个酒吧的老板
Skinny Razor. He owns the place.

151
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,450
剃刀
Razor?

152
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,700
他放高利贷 而且在酒吧里赌马
He shylocks and runs a book out of the joint.

153
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,830
他的人脉很广
He's got good connections.

154
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
他就叫剃刀
Razor's his name?

155
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,450
他以前在肉店工作
He used to work at a butcher shop.

156
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
我的朋友爱尔兰人法兰克来了 我跟你提过他的

Frank Sheeran.

159
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,330
你喜欢牛排
You like steak?

160
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,790
喜欢

161
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,080
我运送牛排
I deliver steak.

162
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,950
是吗
Do ya?

163
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,080
优质牛排
Good steak.

164
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,450
我可以给你提供牛排
I could deliver you steak.

165
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,660
-你能吗   -能

166

价钱也好 最实惠的

167

-我们稍后再谈   -好
-We'll talk later.   -Okay.

168
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,830
谢了 瘦子
Thanks, Skinny.

169
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,830
外面冷死人了
It's freezing out there.

170
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,290
我不怕冷
I don't mind it.

171
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,500
我最讨厌冷
I hate it.

172
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,160
你出去的时候...
When you go outside...

173
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,830
锁上密封条
put the seal on.

174
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,500
-好的 反正我得出去   -我欠你个人情
-All right. I gotta go out anyway.   -I owe you one.

175
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,540
好了 法兰克
There you go, Frank.

176
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,450
-下次见   -谢了 托尼
-See you next time.   -Thanks, Tony.

177
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,120
好多了 法兰克
Much better, Frank.

178
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,120
特选级牛排我碰都不碰 只吃极佳级的
I don't go near Choice. I only do Prime.

179
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,660
我下周二能多弄一点吗
Can I get more next Tuesday?

180
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,410
你要多少
How many you want?

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,370
至少五块
At least five.

182
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,830
没问题
Five you got.

183
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,000
这是搞什么鬼
What the fuck is this?

184
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,910
托尼 我不...
Tony, I don't...

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
-这是怎么回事 法兰克   -我不知道
-What the fuck is this, Frank?   -I don't know.

186
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,540
我不负责把货装上卡车
I don't load the truck.

187
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,910
应该由装货工人装货 可能他们没有做好他们的工作
The loaders are supposed to load it. Maybe they didn't do their work.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,450
你没有意识到 自己开着一辆轻飘飘的卡车
You didn't realize you were driving a light horse?

189
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,330
感觉没问题
It felt fine.

190
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,620
少来了 法兰克 不可能
Come on, Frank. Come on.

191
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,250
我跟你说 我...
I'm telling you. I... I...

192
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,120
千真万确 我真不知道发生了什么事 可能是哪个...
God's truth. I just don't know what happened. Maybe some...

193
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,700
-车子是空的   -我知道是空的
-It's empty.   -I know it is.

194
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,160
我知道是空的
I know it is.

195
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,250
你们看什么 回去工作
What are you looking at? Go back to work.

196
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,910
全都回去
All of youse!

197
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,580
我怎么向老板交代
What can I tell the boss?

198
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,160
别看着我 因为我...
Just don't look at me 'cause I...

199
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,450
我还能看着谁
Who else can I look at?

200
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,660
这事不能由我来负责 法兰克
It's not gonna be on me, Frank.

201
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,790
我只负责开卡车
I just drive the truck.

202
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,450
法兰克希兰 我念对了吗
Frank Sheeran. Did I say that right?

203
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,370
根据合同 多亏了吉米霍法
Under the contract, thanks to Jimmy Hoffa,

204
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,700
只有在掌握非常具体的证据的情况下 才能解雇司机
a driver can only be fired on very specific charges.

205
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
-你迟到过吗   -没有
-Were you ever late?   -No.

206
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,950
-你有没有开车违章   -没有
-Do you have any moving violations?   -No.

207
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,790
-你是否在工作时间内喝酒   -不喝
-Do you drink on the job?   -No.

208
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,250
是否打过任何人
Ever hit anybody?

209
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,160
在工作期间
On the job?

210
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,660
偷窃算正当理由吗
Stealing, is that grounds?

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,250
他们能证明吗
Can they prove it?

212
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,620
应该不能
I don't think so.

213
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,370
那就没什么好担心的
Then there's nothing to worry about.

214
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,660
如果他们可以证明
If they can prove it,

215
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,830
他们只需要知道人名 同伙的名字
they're just gonna want names. Accomplices.

216
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,000
告诉他们几个名字 你就可以回家
You give them some names, you go home.

217
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,580
保住你的工作
Keep your job.

218
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,660
这个提议如何
How about that?

219
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,080
你愿意告诉他们名字吗
Would you give them names?

220
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,200
没有名字
No names.

221
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,410
我并不在乎你有没有偷那些货 那对我来说没有任何区别
I don't care if you did it or not. That makes no difference to me.

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,040
我替你辩护 对吗
I'm here to defend you. Right?

223
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,160
所以你想知道我到底有没有偷
So you want to know if I did it or not?

224
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,080
不管如何我都为你辩护
I'm gonna defend you either way.

225
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,950
我为他们卖命工作的时候... 我没有偷他们的东西
I work hard for them when I'm... I ain't stealing from 'em.

226
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,750
法官大人 如果这是关于
Your Honor, if this was about

227
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,330
是非对错 公司会选择解雇希兰先生
right or wrong, the company would have sought Mr. Sheeran's dismissal.

228
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,540
他们并没有
They didn't.

229
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,540
他们指控希兰先生 因为他们希望他能说出同伙
They accused Mr. Sheeran because they hoped he could name conspirators

230
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,500
但他无法配合 因为根本不存在同伙
which he couldn't do because they don't exist.

231
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,750
不存在同伙是因为他没有偷任何东西
They don't exist because he didn't steal anything.

232
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,370
他没有偷任何东西 因为他是个模范雇员
He didn't steal anything because he's an exemplary employee,

233
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,660
八年来从来没有休过一天病假
who, in eight years, has never taken a day of sick leave.

234
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,370
他违反的唯一一条规定 是他自己工会的规定
The only rule he ever broke is his own union's,

235
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,830
因为他在大冬天里 帮忙把牛肋肉从他的卡车
by helping others carry sides of beef from his truck

236
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,790
搬到他们的冷藏库里
to their refrigerators in the dead of winter.

237
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,450
全体起立
All rise.

238
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,660
开庭
Court is in session.

239
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,870
我驳回这个诉讼请求 不过有个警告
I'm dismissing this case with a warning.

240
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,330
是 法官大人
Yes, Your Honor.

241
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,750
不 不是你 希兰先生
No, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

242
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,370
你们敢再以威胁而非证据
You bring another working man before this court

243
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,750
让一名工人上这个法庭 你们肯定会后悔的 相信我说的话
with threats instead of evidence, believe me, you'll be sorry.

244
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,290
如果我持有这个公司的股份 我会把它卖掉
If I owned stock in this company, I would sell it.

245
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,620
我不知道他是怎么办到的
I don't know how he did it

246
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,200
我也不会问 我只知道
and I ain't gonna ask. All I know is

247
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,700
比尔布法利诺帮我摆脱了一场
that Bill Bufalino got me out of a case

248
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,250
我绝不可能脱身的官司
I should never have gotten away with.

249
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,660
我原本应该会败诉的
I should've been down for the count.

250
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,910
他们肯定会感激你今天所做的事
They're gonna appreciate what you did today.

251
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,160
他们有家庭 有孩子
They got families, they got kids.

252
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,410
他们需要那些工作
They need those jobs.

253
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,250
相反 我们出去庆祝了...
Instead, we went out celebrating...

254
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,700
而我遇到了 将改变我下半辈子的一个人
and I met what was gonna turn out to be the rest of my life.

255
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,790
我就说从外面走进来的人是你
I thought that was you walking in outside.

256
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,910
介绍你认识一下这位新朋友法兰克
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

257
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,200
法兰克 我想你认识一下我表哥罗素布法利诺
Frank, I want you to meet my cousin Russell Bufalino.

258
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,750
几个月前 你帮我修好了我的卡车
You helped me with my truck a few months ago.

259
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,580
哦 是的 记起来了 那条同步带
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. The timing chain.

260
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,750
你后来让人把它修好了吗
Did you get it fixed?

261
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,080
我第二天就把它修好了
I fixed it the next day.

262
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,830
-再次感谢   -不客气
-Thanks again.   -You're welcome.

263
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,160
很高兴你把它修好了
I'm glad you fixed it.

264
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,910
这里有很多难搞的家伙 他告诉过你吗
There's a lot of tough guys around here. Did he tell ya?

265
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,290
-你不怕难搞的家伙吧   -不怕
-You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?   -No.

266
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,660
我看也是 回头见
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

267
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,910
你表哥帮了我的大忙
Your cousin saved my ass.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,580
要不是他 我那整批货可能都会坏掉
I could've lost the whole load.

269
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,910
是啊 他对卡车了如指掌
Yeah. Well, he knows everything about trucks.

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,040
他在加拿大干姜汁汽水公司 工作了很长时间
He worked at Canada Dry for a long time.

271
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,290
维托 你好吗
Vito, how are you?

272
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,870
我们坐包厢吧 来吧
Let's take the booth. Come on.

273
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,370
我当时并不知道 罗素布法利诺的真实身份
I didn't know who Russell Bufalino was back then,

274
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,750
但我在报纸上看了很多的照片和报道
but I'd seen enough pictures and stories in the newspapers

275
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,000
知道那天跟他吃饭的是安吉洛布鲁诺
to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.

276
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,330
布鲁诺当时刚刚当上费城的新老大
Bruno, he... he was just made the new boss of Philadelphia.

277
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,410
从费城到大西洋城的一切都归他管
He took care of everything from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.

278
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,450
这一点我是知道的
That I knew.

279
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,080
只需要知道这一点
And that was all I had to know,

280
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,540
我就明白罗素布法利诺 并不是什么汽水公司的卡车修理工
to know that Russell Bufalino was no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.

281
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,950
这面包很好吃
This bread is very good.

282
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,040
好吃 对吧
Good, eh?

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,950
像你这样的爱尔兰人 是从哪里学的意大利语
Where did an Irisher like you learn to speak Italian?

284
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,160
在意大利 打仗的时候
In Italy   -the war.

285
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,750
意大利哪里
Where?

286
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,580
萨勒诺
Salerno.

287
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,750
安齐奥
Anzio.

288
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,910
西西里...
Sicily...

289
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,700
在卡塔尼亚附近
around Catania.

290
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,290
卡塔尼亚 我就是卡塔尼亚人
Catania? I'm from Catania.

291
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,910
真的 我就觉得你有一点卡塔尼亚口音
Yeah? I thought you had an accent like Catania.

292
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,790
你打仗打了多久
How long were you in the war?

293
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,660
四年
Four years.

294
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,290
411天作战...
411 days in combat...

295
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,000
122天在安齐奥
122 at Anzio.

296
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,040
45步兵队
Forty-fifth Infantry.

297
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,290
你当时怕不怕死
Were you afraid of dying?

298
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,000
由始至终都很怕
Always afraid.

299
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,580
千万别信跟你说
And don't let anybody tell you

300
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,830
他们当时不怕死的那些人 那是胡扯
that they weren't afraid. That's a lot of bullshit.

301
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,450
每个人都怕死
Everybody's afraid.

302
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
而且会经常祈祷
And you pray a lot.

303
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,370
我当时经常祈祷
I prayed a lot.

304
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,870
我祈祷要是我可以活着出去 就再也不犯罪作恶
I prayed I'd never sin again if I could just get out of here.

305
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,700
但是然后战争一开始
But then the fighting starts,

306
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,250
你就会忘掉一切
and then you forget about everything.

307
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,330
只是努力生存下来 努力活着
You're just trying to survive, stay alive.

308
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,910
有一次我明白到
Once I saw

309
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,620
我正在熬过战争
that I was getting through the war,

310
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,540
我环顾四周 说到
I looked around me, and I said:

311
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,700
"从现在开始 不管发生什么 随遇而安"
"From now on, whatever happens, happens."

312
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,910
去它的
Fuck it.

313
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,620
你必须遵守命令
You know, you follow orders.

314
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,790
他们让你把囚犯带到...树林里
They tell you to bring some prisoners into... into the woods.

315
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,120
他们不说要做什么
They don't say what to do,

316
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,910
只是说"快一点"
they just say, "Hurry up."

317
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,750
真的难以置信 我一直没明白 他们怎么会不停地挖...
It's crazy, but I never understood how they would just keep digging...

318
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,410
他们自己的坟墓
their own graves.

319
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
停
Stop!

320
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,000
也许他们以为 如果他们乖乖做事
Maybe they thought if they did a good job,

321
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,450
拿着枪那家伙...
the guy with the gun...

322
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,700
可能会改变主意
would change his mind.

323
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,250
罗素立即就对我产生了好感
Russell, he... he took a shine to me right away.

324
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,870
过了一段时间后
After a while,

325
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,080
他开始给我
he started giving me

326
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,410
一些小任务
little things to do.

327
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,540
但后来安吉洛也开始给我一些小任务
But then Angelo, himself, started giving me little things to do, too.

328
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,160
罗素太太凯莉的家族
Russ's wife Carrie, her family

329
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,160
源远流长 跟布法利诺家族一样
goes all the way back, way, way back

330
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,000
可以追溯到在西西里的同一个小镇
to the same town in Sicily as the Bufalinos.

331
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,200
他们一直提这件事
They talked about it all the time.

332
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,290
可以这么说 她出身于一个黑帮世家
She came from Mob royalty, if you want to call it that.

333
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,620
希安卓斯家族
The Sciandras.

334
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,040
对他们而言 这就好像他们是美国最早的黑帮
To them, it was like they came over on the... the Italian Mayflower.

335
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,000
你上楼去洗洗吧
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,500
衣服给我 我来处理
Give me those clothes. I'll get rid of them.

337
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,290
别忘了脱鞋子 罗素
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

338
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,580
嘿 法兰克
Hey, Frank,

339
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,620
能不能快一点停车
can we stop soon?

340
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,160
明白了 问你先生吧 罗素
Yeah, yeah, well, ask your husband. Russell?

341
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,450
他睡着了
He's out cold.

342
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,620
-我能搞定 法兰克   -确定
-I got it, Frank.   -Sure?

343
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,620
我们到哪儿了
Where are we?

344
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,830
快到刘易斯堡了
Near Lewisburg.

345
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,450
到那里的时候告诉我一下 我得在几个地方停一下
Let me know when we get there. I got some stops to make.

346
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,450
罗素做生意的范围很广
Russell had a piece of everything.

347
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,950
他在皮茨顿有一家店 叫"宾州帷帘窗帘"
He had this store in Pittston called Penn Drape and Curtains.

348
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,830
他所有的生意都是在那里进行的
And he ran everything out of there.

349
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,540
谁知道那都是些什么生意
Who knew what it all was?

350
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,870
我肯定他有合伙人 他们总有合伙人
I'm sure the man had partners. They always have partners.

351
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,120
没有人掌握全部资金
Nobody keeps all the money.

352
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,080
但我能告诉你 所有人都听罗素的
But everybody listened to Russ. That I can tell you.

353
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,790
你想贿赂一个法官 就去问罗素
You wanted to bribe a judge, you asked Russell.

354
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,040
不知道给多少钱贿赂法官 罗素肯定能告诉你
You didn't know how much to bribe him, Russell was gonna tell you.

355
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,410
好了 我会告诉他的 我马上到
All right, I'll tell him. I'll be right there.

356
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,040
别担心 我会处理的
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

357
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,160
你想提拔一个你的人
You want to promote one of your guys,

358
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,500
罗素会告诉你可行与否
Russ would tell you you could or you could not.

359
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,750
帮我个忙
Do me a favor.

360
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,580
跟史蒂夫去他那里 带上维托
Go with Steve down to his place. Take Vito with you.

361
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,870
那些家伙一直在附近转悠 去摆平他们
These guys keep coming around, so straighten them out.

362
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,500
我会处理的 罗素
I'll take care of it, Russ.

363
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,540
他是在...噢 你在这儿啊
Where's... Oh, here you are.

364
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,500
你想让某个人消失 得先征求罗素的同意
You want to make somebody disappear, you got to get Russell's permission.

365
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,370
就只能这么办
No two ways about it.

366
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,120
-我一点都不担心   -不需要担心
-I wasn't worried.   -I didn't think so.

367
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,540
-代我向你父亲问好   -我会的 有心了
-Tell your father I said "Hi".   -I'll tell him. Thanks.

368
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,790
你在这里干什么 你得跟布鲁诺一起去
What are you doing here? You gotta go with Bruno.

369
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,410
我这就去
I'm on my way.

370
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,120
而当你替罗素办事的时候 必须亲力亲为
And when you did something for Russ, you did it yourself.

371
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,950
正如罗素常说的...
Like Russ used to say...

372
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,660
我让别人替我去处理事情的时候
When I ask somebody to take care of something for me,

373
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,870
我指望他们亲自处理那些事
I expect them to take care of it themselves.

374
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,250
我不需要几个人负责同一件事
I don't need two roads coming back to me.

375
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,450
黑手党创始人之一阿纳斯塔西亚 在理发店被杀时
When Anastasia got killed in the barbershop,

376
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,620
他们请了罗素来平息事态
they brought Russell in to calm things down,

377
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,830
避免所有人开始大开杀戒
so that everybody wasn't going around killing everybody

378
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,040
并把事情摆平
and it could all get straightened out.

379
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,160
我们知道所发生的事
We know what happened.

380
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,330
我们改变不了 这是既成事实
We can't change it. It is what it is.

381
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,790
请转告我的朋友我很乐意帮忙
Please, tell my friend I'm happy to help.

382
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,580
罗素表面上完全看不出来
You'd never know it by looking at this guy,

383
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,870
但这家伙在各行业都有影响力
but all roads led back to Russ.

384
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,950
钱在哪里
Where's the money?

385
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,580
-他没有钱   -他没有钱
-He don't have it.   -He don't have it?

386
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,580
-他说他妈妈...   -别跟我说
-He said something about his mother---Don't tell me.

387
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,500
我来猜一下
Let me guess.

388
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,540
他妈妈死了 葬礼花了他一大笔钱
His mother died, and the funeral set him back.

389
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,330
是的 没错 就是这样
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

390
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,370
那混球的妈妈...
Fucking mother's...

391
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,950
十年来死了多少回了
fucking dying over and over for ten years.

392
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,330
我该怎么办
What do I do?

393
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,750
在这里等着
Don't leave.

394
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,370
给你
Here.

395
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,410
只是给他看看这个 别真的用它
Just show it to him. Don't use it.

396
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,910
嘿 你瞧
Hey. Look.

397
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,040
嘿 法兰克
Hey, Frank.

398
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,790
瘦子想见你 上车
Skinny wants to see you. Get in the car.

399
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,620
-我正要去见他   -快上车
-I was just gonna go see him.   -Get in the fucking car.

400
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,000
-我正要去见他   -上车
-I was just gonna go see him!   -Get in the car!

401
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,540
别给我耍小聪明 敢说你妈妈死了糊弄我 上车
Don't get cute with me. That bullshit about your mother. Get in the car!

402
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,330
-我发誓我正要...   -他妈的上车
-I swear I was just gonna---Get in the fucking car!

403
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,660
你想给我耍小聪明
You want to get cute with me?

404
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,410
说什么你妈妈生病了 死了
All that bullshit about your mother and sick and all that and dying.

405
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,620
-我正打算去见他   -你现在就去见他
-I was just gonna go see him.   -You're gonna see him now.

406
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,500
我发誓本打算明来见你的
I swear, I was gonna come see you tomorrow.

407
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,450
明天 我对天发誓
Tomorrow. I swear to God.

408
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,910
明天在这里
Tomorrow. Here.

409
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,500
-什么时间   -1点 我会1点到这里
-What time?   -One o'clock. I'll be here at one.

410
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,330
怎么 你要在这里过夜
What, are you sleeping in?

411
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,950
你决定吧

Frank, he didn't mean it. It just happened.

436
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,870
他不是故意的？ 他碰了我女儿

迪图里奥 绰号"悄悄话"
Whispers DiTullio. Not the Whispers

454
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,540
不是差不多同一时期 在那辆车子里被炸死的那个悄悄话
they blew up in that car around the same time.

455
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,500
这个是好人悄悄话 他知道怎样赚钱
This was the good Whispers who knew how to make money.

456
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,330
我借钱给一家店 那家店生意非常好
I got this place I front money to. It's a really good business.

457
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,540
是一家洗衣店
It's a laundry.

458
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,950

in Atlantic City. They wash and iron it.

461
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,660
正常来说 那就像是个印钞机特许证
Normally, it's like a license to print fucking money.

462
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,620
不过最近不一样了

They're trying to take our customers from us.

466

跟你说实话 我有一点担心
To tell you the truth, I'm a little concerned.

467
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,200
别人说他们有一点担心的时候 他们其实非常担心
Whenever anybody says they're a little concerned, they're very concerned.

468
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,330
事实上 我真的不只是有一点担心
As a matter of fact, I'm really more than a little concerned.

469
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:02,080
而当他们说他们不只是有一点担心时 他们已经走投无路了
And when they say they're more than a little concerned, they're desperate.

470
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,410
我要把这地方炸了 烧了 焚了 随便你该怎么做
I want this fucking place bombed, burnt, torched, whatever you have to do.

471
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,290
你打过仗 你知道该怎么做
You were in the war. You know what to do.

472
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,330
对那鬼地方做你对柏林做过的事
Leave that fucking place like you left Berlin.

473
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,000

Burnt to the fucking ground. I want them out of fucking business.

474
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,000

475
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,250
是特拉华州的 凯迪拉克家用织品清洗服务公司
It's the Cadillac Linen Service in Delaware.

476
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,540
一群犹太人开的

让他们向保险公司要赔偿
Let them collect their insurance,

478
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,200
我肯定他们的赔偿金很多
I'm sure they have plenty,

479
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,450
别搞别一家公司
and leave this fucking other place alone,

480
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,080
就是我参与的那一家
the one I'm involved in.

481
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
-这不是一万   -这里有两千
-This ain't ten grand.   -It's two grand.

482
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,500
你让那些犹太洗衣女工失业的时候 就能拿到剩下的钱
When you put these Jew washerwomen out of business, you get the rest.

483
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,450
我现在手头有点紧
I'm a little short of the money right now,

484
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,540
我不想去找瘦子 借高利贷 付高额利息
and I don't want to go to Skinny and have to pay a big vig.

485
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,620
我从别的地方弄钱
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

486
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,580
不能让任何人知道
Nobody has to know.

487
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,700
尤其不能让瘦子知道 因为钱不是从他那里弄来的
Especially not Skinny because I'm not getting the money from him.

488
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,450
看得出你有点犹豫 我知道你的本事
I see you look a little hesitant. I know what you can do.

489
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,620
如果我少付你钱 你肯定会让我没有好下场
If I stiff you on the money, you'll do something terrible to me.

490
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,910
我不希望发生那种事
I do not want that.

491
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,660
我赢了彩票
I hit the number.

492
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,540
这里大概有1500
It's about 1,500.

493
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,580
我几个小时后回来

Sit down, Frank.

500
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,750
你在特拉华州干什么

501
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,200
要炸一家洗衣店
Bombing out a laundry place.

502
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,200
我只是在做一个任务 多挣点钱
I was just doing a job to make some extra money.

503
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,160
让那家店停止营业

504
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,790
让那个...地方倒闭
Putting this... Putting this place out of commission.

505
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
这是替谁干活
For who?

506
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,750
现在必须说出来
Now is not the time to not say.

507
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,660
悄悄话
Whispers.

508
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,410
另一个悄悄话
The other Whispers.

509
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,200
你知道凯迪拉克 家用织品清洗的老板是谁吗
You know who owns the Cadillac Linen Service?

510
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,410
-洗衣行业的犹太人   -他们只占了部分股份
-Some Jews in the laundry business.   -They own a part of it.

511
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,660
你知道还有谁是这家公司的老板吗
You know who else has an interest in it?

512
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,000
-不知道   -是不才
-No.   -I do.

513
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,870
是谁
Who?

514
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,160
是我 其他的股份是我的
I do. I own the other part.

515
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,870
而不是我认识拥有余下股份的人
Not I know somebody who owns the other part.

516
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,750
安吉洛 我不知道你投资了这家公司
Angelo, I didn't know you had any part of it.

517
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,290
要是我知道你有股份 我绝不会做出那种事的
I would never have done what I did if I knew you were involved.

518
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,370
我绝不会那样害你的
I would never do that against you.

519
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,870
悄悄语没有说是犹太黑帮的
Whispers didn't say it was the Jew Mob?

520
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,450
他说的是犹太洗衣女工
He said Jew washerwomen.

521
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,000
犹太洗衣女工
Jew washerwomen.

522
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,000
他还说了什么
What else he say?

523
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,580
我敢打赌他说了要你保密
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

524
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,870
不能告诉市里的任何人
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

525
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,000
是的
He did.

526
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,950
我没有调查过
I didn't check.

527
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,200
很抱歉 我应该调查一下的
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

528
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,250
-我能把他的钱还给他吗   -他用不上
-Can I give him his money back?   -He won't need it.

529
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,200
你可以留着
You can keep it.

530
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,080
我不想惹麻烦 我还是还给他吧 我没关系
I don't want no trouble. I'll just give it back to him and I'm okay.

531
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,080
他用不上的
He won't need it.

532
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,080
好吧 谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

533
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,290
谢谢罗素吧
Thank Russell.

534
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,290
我本打算让犹太黑帮把你抓走的
I would have let the Jew Mob have you.

535
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,580
这位是你的好朋友
You got a good friend here.

536
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,750
你不知道你有个多好的朋友
You don't know how good a friend you got.

537
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,200
我...知道
I... I know.

538
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,410
不 你不知道
No, you don't know.

539
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,290
去吧台那里等着
Wait by the bar.

540
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,830
在这种情况下 最好就是用全新的枪
In a case like this, the best thing to do is you use something brand new.

541
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,410
刚从盒子里拆出来的
Right out of the box.

542
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,200
否则 你根本不知道它在哪里被用过 或被谁用过
Otherwise, you don't know where it's been or who's used it.

543
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,580
跟什么罪案有联系
What crime it was connected to.

544
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,200
那就是找死
That's suicide.

545
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,870
所以我推荐用全新的 刚从盒子里拆出来的枪
So, I recommend something new, straight out of the... the box.

546
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,080
冰冷 干净利落
Stone cold. Clean.

547
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,000
你来了 我不知道你会从哪边过来 我没有...
There you are. I didn't know which way you were coming from. I didn't--

548
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,700
你接下来要做的
The next thing you do

549
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,910
就是把那东西扔掉 把它处理掉
is throw the thing away. Get rid of it.

550
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,040
所有人都把东西 扔到斯库尔基尔河的一个地方
Everybody uses a spot in the Schuylkill River.

551
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,500
如果派个潜水员下去 捞起来的枪能武装一个小国
If they send divers down there, they'd be able to arm a small country.

552
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,450
对我来说 杀死悄悄话后一切都变了
For me, everything changed after Whispers.

553
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,330
就像是在军队一样
It was like the army.

554
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,040
服从命令
You followed orders.

555
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,040
把事做好
You did the right thing.

556
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,120
就能得到奖赏
You got rewarded.

557
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,120
我替罗素办事的时候 从来不是为了钱
And when I handled things for Russell, it was never for money,

558
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,040
而是为了表示尊重
but as a show of respect.

559
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,410
你跑跑腿
You ran an errand,

560
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,200
帮他个忙 当你需要帮忙的时候 他也会还你的人情
you did a favor, you got a favor back if you ever needed it.

561
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,120
而且你总会赶紧回去
And you always hurried back.

562
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,660
谢谢你 维托
Thank you, Vito.

563
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,500
法兰克 你好
Hi, Frank.

564
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,410
你想要点什么
What can I get for you?

565
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,620
我现在就只要酒
I'm just gonna get the wine now.

566
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,080
有任何需要就叫我
Just call me if you need anything.

567
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
会的
I will.

568
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,410
-你自便 法兰克   -谢谢
-Help yourself, Frank.   -Thanks.

569
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,660
情况变了
Things change.

570
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,370
-她...是新来那个 对吗   -对
-She's... she's the new one, right?   -Yeah.

571
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,830
她是个不错的姑娘 好姑娘
She's a nice kid. Nice kid.

572
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,290
任何时候都不适合离开自己的老婆
No time is a... is a good time to leave your wife,

573
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,700
但我就是在那时候离开了我老婆
but that's when I left mine.

574
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,580
嘿 伊拉 怎么了
Hey, Ira, what's going on?

575
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,580
-有问题吗   -没有 一切正常
-Any problems?   -No. Everything's good.

576
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,250
在这辆凯迪后面停下来
Pull over after this Caddy.

577
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,330
他在等你
He's expecting you.

578
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,160
菲尔 你这家店真不错
Phil, you have a nice shop here.

579
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,830
大家喜欢来这家店
People like to come to this store.

580
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,660
但你的孩子真是个瘪三
But your kid is a real sfigato.

581
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,660
明白吗 他非常讨人厌
Understand? He's a pain in the ass.

582
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,540
他是个野孩子 你得管管他 要是你不管
He's a wild kid. You gotta control him. If you don't,

583
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,290
就再也没人想来这里买东西了
nobody's gonna want to shop here anymore.

584
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,250
如果你的生意不好 对我也不好
If it's not good for you, it's not good for me.

585
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,950
你明白我说的话吧
You understand what I'm saying.

586
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,790
我向你道歉 罗素
I apologize, Russell.

587
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,370
那是我跟法兰克送的 这是你和我送的
That's from you and Frank, and this one from you and me.

588
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,000
要不买根宝宝汤匙吧
What about a baby spoon?

589
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,450
-她用宝宝汤匙来干什么   -生个宝宝就能用了
-What'll she do with a baby spoon?   -Have a baby.

590
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,950
他们还没结婚呢
They're not married yet.

591
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,450
我向你保证
I give you my word.

592
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,370
好的 有你的保证就够了 菲尔
All right. Your word's good, Phil.

593
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,370
我们走吧 太太们
Let's go, girls.

594
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,160
我们完事了
We're done.

595
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,540
你在干什么
What are you doing?

596
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,790
你什么时候才能聪明一点
When the hell are you gonna wise up?

597
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,120
好样的 不愧是我的女儿
There we go. That's my girl.

598
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,450
嘿 佩琪
Hey, Peggy.

599
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,370
过来
Come here.

600
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,080
我说不上来
I don't know.

601
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,620
我感觉她不喜欢我 就好像她怕了我似的
I get the feeling she don't like me. Like she's afraid of me.

602
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,160
她就是这性格
That's the way she is.

603
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,750
她有时候也怕我 她是个敏感的孩子
She's afraid of me at times, too. She's a sensitive kid.

604
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,450
我能理解她怕我 但她不应该怕你
I understand if she's afraid of me, but she shouldn't be scared of you.

605
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,290
有时候她会在报纸上 看到关于我的报道
And then she hears about me in the papers sometimes.

606
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,000
你得跟你的孩子亲近
You gotta be close to your kids.

607
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,910
我们很亲近
I am.

608
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,910
能有这些孩子是你的福气
You're blessed to have them.

609
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,160
凯莉跟我不能生孩子
Carrie and I can't have kids.

610
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,450
但你很有福气 真有福气
But you're blessed. You're blessed.

611
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,540
叫她 让她过来
Call her. Tell her to come over.

612
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,410
佩琪宝贝 过来这里
Sweetheart. Peggy. Come here.

613
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,910
-过来   -来罗素伯伯身边
-Come here.   -Come over by Uncle Russ.

614
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,910
-你好吗   -还好
-How are you?   -Okay.

615
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,790
你知道为什么 上帝把天造得这么高吗
Do you know why God made the sky so high?

616
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,700
好让小鸟飞翔的时候 脑袋不会撞上去
So little birdies don't bunk their head on it when they're flying around.

617
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,580
很可爱 不是吗
Isn't that cute?

618
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,830
一个小笑话
A little joke.

619
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,330
不好笑吗
Isn't that funny?

620
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,080
你要吃糖吗
You want some candy?

621
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,580
不要 你们不要吃糖
No, you guys don't want any candy.

622
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,410
没什么我能为你做的事
There's nothing I can do for you?

623
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,910
要是有的话就告诉罗素伯伯
If there is, let Uncle Russell know.

624
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
好的
Okay.

625
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,540
回去吧 好好玩
Go back. Have some fun.

626
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,500
你明白我的意思了吧
You see what I mean?

627
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,410
明白我的感觉了吗
See that feeling I get?

628
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,000
她只是害羞 她...没有恶意
She's just shy. She... she don't mean nothing.

629
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,830
有时候 父母离婚的时候 孩子们会觉得很迷惘
Sometimes, when the parents get divorced, the kids get all confused,

630
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,870
会有怨恨 而且不知道该发泄到谁身上
and they get resentful, and they don't know who to take it out on

631
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,330
或站哪一边 或者...
or which side, or...

632
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:51,450
不 你说得对
No, you're right.

633
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,750
我很幸运 琳妮和玛丽相处得非常好
I'm lucky because Reenie and Mary get along like gangbusters,

634
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,500
所以孩子们在两家轮流住 没有一点问题
so the kids go back and forth with no problem.

635
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,250
留你的家人在身边 要留心这一点
Keep your family close. Keep an eye on that.

636
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,500
我是说 我...就是幸运
I mean, I'm... I'm just lucky.

637
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,950
工会的工作怎么样
How's it going with the union?

638
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,200
-工会是世界上最棒的   -你喜欢吧
-The union's the best in the world.   -You like it, huh?

639
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,500
我希望自己能有更稳定的工作 但是...
I wish I had something more steady, but...

640
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,830
组织工作怎么样
How about organizing?

641
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,370
我很乐意做组织工作 但是...
I would like to do that. But...

642
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,700
有很多人在排队
there's a long line.

643
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,290
换句话说 就是候选名单很长
A long waiting list, if you will.

644
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,790
我们一个朋友遇到了点小麻烦
Well, a friend of ours is having a little trouble.

645
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,410
最高层的朋友
Friend at the top.

646
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,120
是谁
Who's that?

647
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,040
最高层
The top.

648
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,450
霍法
Hoffa?

649
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,870
是的
Yeah.

650
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,830
那天听说有些人想用水管揍他
I heard the other day that some guys tried to pipe him because of

651
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,040
因为一个女工人的赔偿金的案子
a workman's comp case.

652
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,250
是的 我听说他痛打了他们一顿
Yeah, I heard he beat the shit out of them.

653
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,120
他还能继续这样做多久
How long can he keep doing that?

654
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,500
他需要有个可以信赖的人在身边
He needs somebody he can trust around him.

655
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,330
一个随时在他身边的人
Somebody to be with him all the time.

656
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,750
我让麦基接电话吧
I'll put McGee on the phone.

657
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,950

Hiya, my friend. How are you?

659
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,040
我那天跟你说的那个年轻人在我这里
I got that kid I was talking to you about here.

660
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,700

671
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,370

00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,700
要让他这个人满意不容易
He's not an easy man to please.

676
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,330
我尽力而为
I do my best.

677
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,950
有个状况...
Well, there's a situation...

678
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,870
当今的年轻人不知道
Nowadays, young people, they don't know

679
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,160
吉米霍法是谁
who Jimmy Hoffa was.

680
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,660
他们完全不知道
They don't have a clue.

681
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,790
也许他们知道他失踪了之类的 但差不多只知道这一点
Maybe they know that he disappeared or something, but that's about it.

682
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,790
但在当年 这个国家
But back then, there wasn't nobody

683
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,450
没有一个人不知道吉米霍法是谁
in this country who didn't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.

684
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,660
上帝保佑 吉米 你真是个绅士
God bless, Jimmy. You're a real gentleman.

685
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,450
在50年代 他就像猫王一样受欢迎
In the '50s, he was as big as Elvis.

686
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,790
在60年代 他的风头可以媲美披头士
In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.

687
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,330
除了总统以外 他是这个国家 最有权力的男人 无人能及
Next to the President, he was the most powerful man in the country. Bar none.

688
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,700
如果你买东西
If you got it,

689
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,450
卡车会把东西送去给你
a truck brought it to you.

690
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
如果你买
If you got

691
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,120
食物 衣服
your food, your clothing,

692
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,450
药物 家用汽油
your medicine, fuel for your homes,

693
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,450
工业用汽油
fuel for your industries,

694
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,040
卡车会把东西送去给他们
a truck brought it to them.

695
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,250
我们的卡车停止那一天
The day our trucks stop,

696
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,120
美国就会停滞
America stops!

697
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,080
法兰克 现在有一个状况需要处理
There's a situation going on now, Frank, that needs to be attended to.

698
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,580
大公司跟政府正试图分裂工会
Big business and the government are trying to tear the union apart.

699
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,250
他们试图把我们拖垮
They're trying to pull us down.

700
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,330
大公司正发动袭击
Big business is on the attack!

701
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,040
他们来了 他们强势来袭 火速杀来
They're coming. They're coming hard and they're coming fast.

702
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,120
大公司和政府
Big business and the government

703
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,450
正试图在我们这个阶层的人当中
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent

704
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,250
播下怨恨的种子
among our ranks,

705
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,580
而这时候我们需要的是团结一致
at a time when we need unity!

706
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,000
我们需要团结
We need solidarity!

707
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,450
我想把这几个字写在天上
I want to write it in the sky.

708
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,660
团结
Solidarity!

709
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,160
团结
Solidarity!

710
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,120
团结
Solidarity!

711
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,370
你想参与这场战斗吗
You wanna be a part of this fight?

712
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,660
我想 先生
Yes, I do, sir.

713
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,290
你愿意成为这段历史的一分子吗
Would you like to be a part of this history?

714
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,580
我愿意
Yes, I would.

715
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,000
不管你需要我做什么 我都有空
Whatever you need me to do, I'm available.

716
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,160
你明天能来芝加哥吗
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

717
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,160
-我可以 先生   -那就到时见
-I can, sir.   -See you then.

718
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,830
他很健谈 对吗
He likes to talk, don't he?

719
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,450
还以为我刚才是在跟巴顿将军说话
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

720
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,750
法兰克 你之所以会在这里
You know, Frank, the only reason why you're here,

721
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,160
唯一的原因是海员工会 正在跟我们希望签下来的
the Seafarers Union is signing up the same non-union cab drivers

722
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,790
同一批非工会出租车司机签约
as we want to do.

723
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,040
没人知道你的身份
Nobody knows who you are,

724
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,330
没人知道你在这里干什么 好吗
and nobody knows what the fuck you're doing here. Okay?

725
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,120
你和我知道你来这里的目的
You and I know why you're here.

726
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,750
我们得把这些司机签下来 不能让保罗霍尔替他的工会
We need to sign these drivers up so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em

727
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,200
争取到他们
for his fucking union.

728
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:35,540
不知道为什么 这些司机大部分是女同性恋
For some reason, most of these drivers are fucking lesbians.

729
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,200
我完全不明白为什么
I have no reason why.

730
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,950
保罗霍尔在到处说
Paul Hall's running around saying that

731
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,290
他提供的合同比我们的吉米的要好
he's getting a better contract than our boy Jimmy.

732
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,870
他是个龟孙子
He's a cocksucker.

733
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,620
吉米收买了戴利市长
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley in his pocket.

734
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,160
我们做任何事 警察都不会过问
The cops are okay with whatever we do.

735
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,500
他们不会帮我们把车子推下去
They won't help us push these cars in,

736
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,580
但他们也不会让任何人阻止我们
but they won't let anybody fucking stop us.

737
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,540
大伙们加油
Come on, all you guys.

738
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,330
把这该死的东西推下去 小心一点
Let's get this fucking thing in there. Watch yourself!

739
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,830
真费劲
This is a lot of work.

740
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,000
-你想过用残酷口香糖吗   -什么
-You ever think of using candy?   -What?

741
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,080
残酷口香糖
Candy.

742
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,700
残酷口香糖是什么鬼东西
What the fuck is candy?

743
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,950
-喂 卢 把大门打开   -没问题
-Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.   -I got it. I got it.

744
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,830
给 你拿汽油
Here, you take the gas.

745
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,330
吉米有个特点
One thing about Jimmy.

746
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,250
一定不能让他等
Don't ever make him wait.

747
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:08,200
如果你们要开会 要准时到 最好是提前到
If you have a meeting, get there on time. Better, get there early.

748
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,830
这一点再怎么强调都不为过
I can't stress this enough.

749
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,200
他非常看重守时
His problem is that time is of essence.

750
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,700
这很重要
That's the important thing.

751
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,540
还有一件事 吉米不喝酒
One more thing. Jimmy doesn't drink.

752
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,500
世界上最大的卡车工会的头儿不喝酒
The head of the largest fucking union in the world don't drink.

753
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,160
这最糟糕的一点在于 他不允许别人在他旁边喝酒
The worst part about it is, he doesn't allow anybody to drink around him.

754
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:31,830
吉米还有一个特点
Another thing about him.

755
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,450
他很讨厌西瓜
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

756
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,080
但我们会很喜欢西瓜的
But we're gonna like watermelon.

757
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,790
吉米 你真应该看着车子
Jimmy, you should'a seen it,

758
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,160
沉到水里
sinking in the water.

759
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,700
一辆接一辆 我跟你打赌 第二天早上
One by one. I bet you when they woke up

760
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,450
那些该死的出租车司机醒来
the next morning, those fucking cab drivers

761
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,790
去开他们的车的时候 肯定会被吓坏
went to get their cabs, they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

762
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,950
好主意 乔伊
Great idea, Joey.

763
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,290
好主意
Great idea.

764
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:57,870
那不是我的主意
Well, it wasn't my idea.

765
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,410
是我的伙计法兰克的主意
My man Frank. It was his idea.

766
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,040
我告诉你
Let me tell you something.

767
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,910
法兰克掌控了整个码头
Frank took over the pier.

768
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,290
不管他让他们做什么 他们都照办
Whatever he told them to do, whatever he said, they did it.

769
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,080
我从来没见过谁像他一样穿过人群
I never seen a guy walk through a crowd like he does.

770
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,790
没有一个人敢碰他 大家会自动让道
He doesn't touch a fucking person! Everybody gets out of the way.

771
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:18,660
我不是骗你的 我发誓
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

772
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,080
他这辈子从来没见过的人 就好像是...
Guys he never met in his life. It was like...

773
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,040
摩西一样 记得摩西
like Moses. Remember Moses,

774
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,250
走进海洋 大海之类的 水面会自动分开
when he walked into the ocean, the sea, whatever it was, and it opened up!

775
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,450
他就像那样 我告诉你 吉米 他很有一手
That's him. I'm telling you. Jimmy, he's got it.

776
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,660
你怎么看
What do you think?

777
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,080
你还需要他帮你几天
You need him a few days more?

778
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,620
我们得清理一些零碎的事
We gotta clear up a few dribs and drabs.

779
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,580
你们真喜欢吃西瓜
You guys sure like watermelon.

780
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,160
要来一块吗
Want a bite?

781
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,290
死也不要
Not on your life.

782
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,750
你当时就在那里 亲眼所见
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

783
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,700
那些人不是工会的
Those guys ain't union.

784
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,790
他们就像纳粹勾结者一样 在战线后面操作
They're like Nazi collaborators, operating behind the lines.

785
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,830
-你知道的 你打过仗   -确实
-You know. You were in the war.   -I sure do.

786
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:57,790
作战的时候
In a war,

787
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,790
从一个地方转移到另一个地方
you go from point A to point B.

788
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,950
有时候...
Sometimes...

789
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,250
路上会遇到些困难
you spill a little beer along the way.

790
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,000
你觉得这个信条说得通吗
That philosophy make sense to you?

791
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,200
当然了
Sure does.

792
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,250
很好
Good.

793
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,700
吉米并不是因为喜欢我 才让我住他的套房
Jimmy didn't make me stay in his suite because he liked me.

794
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:39,750
他是不想我把我的名字 登记在酒店住客名册上
He didn't want me registering in my name at the hotel.

795
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,080
这样就完全没有证据 证明我当时在芝加哥
This way, there was no proof I was even in Chicago.

796
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,040
加油啊 吉米 你落后了
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

797
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
她无人能挡
Nothing stops her.

798
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,500
芝加哥那件事之后 吉米和我亲近了 我们的太太们一见如故
After Chicago, Jimmy and I got close. The wives hit it off.

799
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,750
吉米和约瑟芬的孩子们已经长大了 离开了家
And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids grown up and out of the house,

800
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,700
他们也很喜欢我们的孩子
they got a kick out of our kids, too.

801
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,250
尤其是佩琪
Especially Peggy.

802
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,250
她和吉米第一次见面就很合得来
She and Jimmy fell for each other right away.

803
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:19,620
你知道比起拍照 我更喜欢什么吗
You know what I like even better than getting my picture took?

804
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,620
什么
What?

805
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,620
惊喜
Surprise!

806
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:29,790
对佩琪来说 吉米跟罗素或瘦子 不一样 甚至跟我都不一样
To Peggy, Jimmy wasn't like Russ, or Skinny or even me.

807
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:33,080
各位 抱歉了 这只是给佩琪和我的
Sorry, everybody. This is just for Peggy and I.

808
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,200
其中一个原因是吉米没有绰号
For one thing, Jimmy didn't have a nickname

809
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,620
比如"剃刀"或"驼背"
like the "Razor" or "The Hunchback"

810
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,830
或者是"黄鼠狼" "悄悄话"
or "The Weasel", or "Whispers".

811
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,750
怎么不说谢谢
So, what happened to "Thank you"?

812
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,160
对她来说 他在帮别人
And to her, he was helping people.

813
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,040
他在帮助别人赚更多的钱 过上更好的生活
He was helping them make more money, live better lives.

814
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,040
他没有踩别人的手
He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.

815
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,000
"如果你买东西 卡车会把东西送去给你"
"'If you have it, a truck brought it to you."

816
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,580
那是霍法先生的原话
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

817
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,250
他是卡车司机国际兄弟会的主席 该工会会员过百万
He's the president of the Teamsters Union with over a million members.

818
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,200
他们全都支持他 因为他们有稳定的工作...
They all support him because they have steady jobs

819
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,950
丰厚的薪水和退休金
big pay and a retirement pension.

820
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:13,040
卡车司机兄弟会养老基金的金额 高达80亿美元
The Teamster Pension Fund had eight billion dollars in it.

821
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,750
吉米控制着其中的每一分钱
Jimmy had complete control over every bit of it.

822
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,410
这个展示很美吧
Isn't this a beautiful presentation?

823
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,080
我只是想申请一个桥梁贷款 吉米
A bridge loan is really all I'm asking, Jimmy.

824
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,620
我不会把我工会会员的养老金 投在风险过大的项目上
I'm not gonna piss away my members' pension dough on something too risky.

825
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,540
这没有风险 吉米
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

826
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,870
"明斯基疯狂"这个节目归我所有
I got Minsky's Follies.

827
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,450
赌城大道第一个无上装表演节目
I got the first topless act on the Strip.

828
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,000
我们在那里的生意很旺 我不能把酒水弄出去...
We're booming in there. I can't get the drinks out...

829
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,120
只是申请投资一个高尔夫球道 你知道你在我身上绝不会亏一分钱
Just asking for a golf course. You know you never lost a dime with me.

830
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,830
我们会非常感谢你帮助杰克所做的事
We'd really appreciate whatever you can do to help Jake along here.

831
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:45,450
我只需要150万完工担保金
One-five is all I need for a completion bond.

832
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,450
行 去银行吧
Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.

833
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,160
这肯定会很成功的 谢谢你 吉米
It's gonna be a big success. Thank you, Jimmy.

834
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,040
你就像一位王子 德高望重
You're a prince. You're a mensch.

835
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,540
而且多亏了霍法先生 工人们还有医疗保险
And, because of Mr. Hoffa, workers have medical insurance

836
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,790
他们生病的时候可用
for when they get sick,

837
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,330
而且他们知道 他们退休后不会挨饿
and know, when they retire, they're not going to go hungry.

838
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,580
文书工作太繁重 所以吉米请了一家保险公司
There was so much paperwork that Jimmy used an insurance company

839
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,790
一个叫艾伦多夫曼的年轻人开的公司 处理借贷的事
run by this kid, Allen Dorfman, to work out the loans.

840
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:27,620
不 一点都不借 下次要礼貌一点请求
No, no, nothing for nothing. Next time ask a little bit fucking nicer.

841
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,790
怎么样 进展如何
And? And? How'd it go?

842
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:39,040
开始的时候只是试探 但结果还行
It was a little touch and go for a bit. But at the end, fine.

843
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,200
罗素会让吉米 借钱给戈特利布这样的人
Russ would get Jimmy to give guys like Gottlieb the loans

844
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,950
而他能抽取贷款金额10%的油水
and you would get like 10% of that.

845
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,540
差不多是这样 也许甚至更多
Or whatever. Maybe even more.

846
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,950
替我转告马特杜佐 说我谢谢他
You tell Marteduzzo from me that I appreciate it.

847
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,450
所有人都会感谢这个 这是件好事
Everybody'll appreciate it. It's a good thing.

848
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,450
当时不能去普通银行借钱 因为那些钱是用来博赌的
You couldn't go to regular banks because the money was for gambling.

849
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,000
这是大实话 事实就是那样
God's truth, that's what it was.

850
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,750
不能去银行借 所以黑帮去找兄弟会借钱
You couldn't. So the Mob went to the Teamsters for the money.

851
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,580
是兄弟会挺身而出
It was the Teamsters that stepped in

852
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,790
借钱把拉斯维加斯建了起来
and lent the money that built Las Vegas.

853
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:13,250
比利 别碰这个东西 你该去哪儿就去哪儿吧
Billy, don't touch this stuff. Just go where you gotta go.

854
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,450
当时的生意多得大家都做不过来
There was more business than anybody could handle.

855
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,080
所以吉米不得不把一些生意 塞给了他妻子约瑟芬
So Jimmy had to shove some of the deals off on to his wife Jo,

856
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,950
她根本不知道她拥有佛罗里达州 "太阳谷"的土地交易的22%股份
who had no idea she had 22% of a Florida land deal called "Sun Valley,"

857
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,000
几艘包租渔船 一间拥有私家雪山的滑雪度假屋
some charter fishing boats, and a ski lodge with its own mountain.

858
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,700
吉米的一个客户是 山姆吉阿卡纳 绰号"摩摩"
One of Jimmy's clients was Sam "Momo" Giancana,

859
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,290
他跟肯尼迪家族是世交 这两家自约翰肯尼迪的父亲
who was friends with the Kennedys from back when Jack's father

860
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,160
在禁酒时期走私酒的时候
made his fortune with the Italians

861
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,330
跟意大利人一起发大财就认识了
as a bootlegger during Prohibition.

862
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,750
摩摩和西纳特拉
Momo, Sinatra hung out together

863
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,250
跟肯尼迪家族混
with the Kennedys.

864
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,750
信不信由你 摩摩和肯尼迪甚至有过同一个女朋友
Momo and Kennedy, believe it or not, even had the same girlfriend.

865
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,790
一起 在同一时期
Together. At the same time.

866
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,410
真是疯狂至极
Talk about crazy.

867
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:02,370
黑帮轻而易举地帮了乔肯尼迪 让他儿子当上了总统
It was easy for the Mob to help Joe Kennedy get his son elected president.

868
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,700
他们只是对选票做了手脚
They just punched up the vote to make sure that he won

869
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,040
确保他在伊利诺伊州胜出
in Illinois.

870
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,250
作为交换条件
In exchange for that,

871
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:16,660
新总统必须把卡斯特罗赶出古巴
the new president was gonna get Castro out of Cuba,

872
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:21,450
好让我们的人 可以夺回他们在哈瓦那的
so our guys could get their casinos and race tracks and shrimp boats

873
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,450
赌场 赛马场 捕虾船 和其他所有的生意
and everything else that they had and owned down there in Havana back.

874
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,250
但那并没有实现
But that that didn't happen.

875
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,370
意大利人
The Italians

876
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,790
希望爱尔兰人肯尼迪当总统
wanted Kennedy the Irishman for President,

877
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:40,410
他们如愿以偿
and that's what they got.

878
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,410
得习惯这个现实 因为接下来 我们每时每刻都会看到这画面
Get used to it because we're gonna be seeing it 24/7.

879
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,870
狗杂种
Son of a bitch!

880
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,790
该死的肯尼迪家族 我正在看肯尼迪家族的人
Goddamn Kennedys. I'm looking at the damn Kennedys.

881
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,540
有孩子们在 注意一下用词
The kids. Language.

882
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,500
有什么区别
What difference does it make?

883
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,950
他们迟早都会学会的 我们要跟这些人开战
They gotta learn sooner or later. We're going to war with these people.

884
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,410
开战
War!

885
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,950
我已经说过一千遍
I've said it a thousand times.

886
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,870
他们是爱尔兰人也好
I don't care they're Irish.

887
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,080
是天主教徒也好
I don't care they're Catholic.

888
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,500
这辈子绝对不能相信的人
If there's one person you can't trust in this life,

889
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,040
就是百万富翁的孩子们
it's millionaires' kids.

890
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,290
你说得对 吉米
You're right, Jimmy.

891
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,620
尤其是那个小混蛋
Especially that little son of a bitch.

892
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:20,500
你不记得帮助过约翰尼迪欧
You don't remember doing any favors for Johnny Dio

893
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,330
还是不记得有过那次谈话
or you don't remember the conversation?

894
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,410
我说的是 我已经尽力回忆了
I'm saying, to the best of my recollection,

895
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,040
我必须回忆这事
I must recall on my memory,

896
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,790
我记不起来了
I cannot remember.

897
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,540
那这两万美元是从哪里来的
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

898
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,080
来自个人
Individuals.

899
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,080
哪些个人 霍法先生
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

900
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:49,870
在未经核查的情况下 我现在一时想不起来
Off hand, that particular amount of money I borrowed...

901
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,790
我借的这笔具体金额的钱
I don't know at this particular moment.

902
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:58,160
但我拿到了我的借贷记录 我有...
But the record of my loans, which I requested, I have...

903
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,040
而且在这一段时间里我借出去的
and out of all the moneys I loaned

904
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,830
所有这些钱 我投到了这些企业当中
during this period of time I went into these ventures.

905
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,370
该死的肯尼迪家族
Those goddamn Kennedys,

906
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,870
他们的愿望实现了
they get what they want!

907
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:15,040
吉米 有孩子
Jimmy, the kids.

908
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,700
他和他已经盘问过我的 所有那些的狗屁问题
Him and all the bullshit problems he put me through already.

909
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,910
我得走了 你可不指望我会看这个
I gotta go. You don't expect me to look at this.

910
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,370
不 我不指望
No, I don't.

911
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,790
对罗素这种人来说
For guys like Russ,

912
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,290
这情况是最好不过的
it couldn't have been better.

913
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:30,950
罗素尽力帮助了肯尼迪当选
Russ did his part for getting Kennedy elected,

914
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,000
这毫无疑问
that's for sure.

915
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,500
你在干什么
What are you doing?

916
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,950
我让你把它们贴在每一根柱子上
I told you to put them on every pole.

917
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,250
那约翰肯尼迪做的
So, what's the first thing

918
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,250
感谢芝加哥的帮助的 第一件事是什么
that Jack Kennedy does to thank Chicago for all their help?

919
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,500
他把自己的混蛋弟弟安排在政府工作
He puts his shitass brother in there,

920
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:47,330
那个预备学校的流氓 让他当上了司法部长
that little prep school punk, and he makes him Attorney General.

921
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,080
罗伯特做的第一件事是什么 他不仅打击吉米
And what's the first thing Bobby does? He goes after not just Jimmy,

922
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,830
在某些程度上你可以理解这个做法
which in a way you could understand.

923
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,500
吉米恨死了肯尼迪家族的人
Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much,

924
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,500
他给了尼克森50万美元 那是兄弟会的钱
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

925
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:06,450
但罗伯特也打击了 吉阿卡纳 马塞洛 特拉菲坎特拉
But Bobby also goes after Giancana, Marcello, Trafficante,

926
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,750
和所有其他
and all the other guys

927
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,700
最初帮助了他哥哥入主白宫的人
who put his brother in the White House in the first place.

928
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,120
那是为了什么
What's that about?

929
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:16,450
谢谢你
Thank you.

930
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,500
是不是有什么我没搞懂的地方
Am I missing something?

931
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,450
真好看
That's gorgeous.

932
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,000
戴着它身体健康 我们爱你
Wear it in the best of health. We love you.

933
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,080
这是给佩琪的
This one is for Peggy,

934
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,160
罗素伯伯送的 圣诞快乐 亲爱的
from Uncle Russell. Merry Christmas, my love.

935
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,450
看看这双鞋子
Oh, look at those.

936
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,040
真棒
So nice!

937
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,830
我听说你喜欢溜冰
I heard you like to skate.

938
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,660
该说什么呢
What do you say?

939
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,580
谢谢
Thank you.

940
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,040
现在我跟罗素伯伯可以带你去溜冰了
Now me and Uncle Russell can take you ice skating.

941
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,580
我想圣诞老人 还在里面给你留了别的东西
I think Santa Claus left you a little something extra in there, too.

942
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,870
该跟罗素伯伯说什么
What do you say to Uncle Russell?

943
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,660
该说什么
What do you say?

944
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:09,910
没关系
It's all right.

945
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,080
她已经说过一次谢谢了 那就够了
She said thank you once. That's enough.

946
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,540
罗伯特当上了司法部长 我们的一举一动都被他们掌握了
With Bobby as Attorney General, they were all over us.

947
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,120
我们不能在电话里说话 因为我们知道电话被窃听了
We couldn't talk on the phone because we knew it was being bugged.

948
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,910
什么都不能做 哪儿都不能去
You couldn't do nothing. You couldn't go nowhere.

949
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,080
什么事都做不了 那个处境真的
You couldn't do anything. It was a bad,

950
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,160
非常糟糕 糟糕透顶 后来...
bad, bad situation. And then...

951
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,790
吉米...不说了
Jimmy... Forget it.

952
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:35,580
司法部长罗伯特有权力 让任何人去坐牢
Bobby, as Attorney General, has the power to send anybody to jail.

953
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,160
而吉米是罗伯特的头号打击对象
And Jimmy was at the top of Bobby's hit list.

954
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,370
他甚至成立了一个
He even set up

955
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,000
"打垮霍法中队"
a "Get Hoffa Squad".

956
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,660
而且他还让他联调局 国税局的人 一刻不停地工作
And he had his guys from the FBI, the IRS working 'round the clock.

957
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,910
他们唯一的任务 就是把吉米霍法送进监狱去
Their only job was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.

958
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,080
他们就只干那么一件事
That's all they did.

959
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,040
我坐在一个挤满了白痴的房间里
I am sitting in a room full of fuckin' idiots.

960
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,120
你们这些愚蠢的混蛋
You dumb motherfuckers!

961
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,870
知道你们干了什么好事吗
You know what you did?

962
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,370
你们把约翰尼欧鲁克的孩子...
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid...

963
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,620
让他当上了
and you put him on

964
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,830
总管组织人
as general organizer,

965
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,370
给他付三万六千美元
pay him thirty-six fucking grand,

966
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,660
与此同时...
at the same time...

967
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,540
你们还让他把保险卖给他老爸的...
you let him sell insurance to his fucking father's...

968
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,330
他老爸的...
to his fucking father's...

969
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,660
他老爸的工会同胞
to his fucking father's locals!

970
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,330
该死的
Damn it!

971
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,950
你们怎么能这么做
How do you do that?

972
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:43,040
你们怎么会这么蠢
How stupid can you be?

973
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:47,870
那个该死的龟孙子肯尼迪
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

974
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:51,080
让我处处受牵制
has got his nose up my ass everywhere I go!

975
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,000
他们在纠缠我 我做的一切都受他们监控
They're hounding me. They're looking at everything I do.

976
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,790
而你们居然让这事公然发生
And you let this happen in public!

977
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,750
你们拱手送给他一个把柄
You're giving it to him!

978
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:02,000
我快要蹲监狱了 你们明白吗
I'm going to jail. You understand?

979
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,950
我快要去坐牢了 全拜你们
I'm going to prison because of you,

980
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,200
这些白痴混蛋所赐
you dumb motherfuckers.

981
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,830
你们就是想
What you wanted

982
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:11,200
把我送进监狱去 直说吧 好让我干掉你们
was to put me in jail. Tell me, so I can kill you.

983
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,750
就在这里
Right here!

984
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,910
-你去哪里   -我他妈的不干了
-Where're you going?   -I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

985
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,080
不干了？ 为什么
Quitting? Why?

986
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,330
你要骂我混蛋
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

987
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,330
你可以那样跟他们说话 但对我不行
You can talk to them like that, but not to me.

988
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,500
不 那些话对你不适用
No! That didn't apply to you.

989
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,290
那对我不适用的时候就告诉我 我刚才就站在那里
Then let me know it didn't apply to me. I'm standing right there.

990
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,040
我甚至没看到你站在那里
I didn't even see you standing there!

991
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,580
我就站在那里 你胡扯什么呢
I was standing right there. What are you talking about?

992
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,410
但那些话说的不是你 我还能怎么说
But it didn't apply to you! What else can I say?

993
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,370
你有麻烦就先把我拉到边上
You got a problem, pull me aside.

994
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:46,700
别污辱我 然后又说对我不适用
Don't insult me and then say it didn't apply to me.

995
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,950
但我刚才根本没看到你在那里
But I didn't even see you there.

996
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:53,830
别这样 法兰克 你知道我不是那样的人
Come on, Frank, you know me better than that. You know me better than that.

997
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,750
拜托了
Please.

998
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,830
消消气 没事的
Come on. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right.

999
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,120
我怎么会那样跟你说话呢
Why would I say that to you?

1000
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,500
-你必须掌控好那些人   -我正掌控一切 别担心
-You gotta control these people.   -I'm controlling everything. Don't worry.

1001
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,910
好了 各位 现在可以出去了
Okay, guys, get out of here now.

1002
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:13,620
我不知道吉米是怎样管理工会的
I don't know how Jimmy is running the fucking union.

1003
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:18,040
罗伯特和联调局一直找他麻烦 他已经快疯了
Between Bobby and the FBI up his ass all the time, he's going fucking crazy.

1004
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,160
转告吉米 我为他遇到的困难感到难过
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

1005
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,950
老一辈的人认识肯尼迪的老子 他们会跟他谈 把事情摆平
The old-timers know the old man. They'll talk to him and straighten it out.

1006
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,540
但他并不明白 而且说实话 我也不明白
But he can't understand, and to be honest, I don't either,

1007
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,000
你们最开始怎么会 帮肯尼迪那个王八蛋当选的
how youse could help get the Kennedy pricks elected in the first place.

1008
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,870
他觉得这一点说不过去
It don't make no sense to him.

1009
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,450
他不需要明白所有的事
He doesn't have to understand everything.

1010
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,500
你知道我的意思吗 有时候这样更好
You know what I'm saying. Sometimes it's better.

1011
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:43,160
我看到他那个样子 你知道...
When I see him like that, you know...

1012
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,870
我努力地...我很难受 我想找个办法帮他一把
I'm tryin' to... I feel bad. I wanna help him in some way.

1013
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,080
他太情绪化了
He's too emotional.

1014
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,660
就像是个大肆折腾看不到大局的人
Like some guy who's rushing all over the place and misses the big picture.

1015
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,250
比如古巴
Like Cuba.

1016
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,080
让我们回去赌场
Getting us back into casinos.

1017
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,410
让我们回去哈瓦那
Getting us back into Havana.

1018
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,580
比如除掉卡斯特罗那个王八蛋
Like getting rid of that fucking Castro prick.

1019
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:12,450
前辈们跟约翰肯尼迪的老爸说过了
The old-timers spoke to the old man.

1020
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,410
他老爸跟约翰肯尼迪谈了 他说
The old man talked to his son Jack, and he told him...

1021
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:18,500
别忘了他是多亏了谁才有今日的地位
don't forget who the fuck he owes.

1022
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:23,250
他知道他是欠了谁的人情
He knows who the fuck he owes.

1023
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,160
所以我要你...
So, I want you...

1024
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,080
去一个叫"里程碑拖运"的地方
to go down to a place called Milestone Hauling.

1025
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,370
那里有个叫菲尔的
There's a guy named Phil.

1026
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,700
他会给你一辆铰链式卡车
He's gonna give you a rig.

1027
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:47,160
你把卡车开到巴尔的摩 开去东方大道上的
You drive the rig to Baltimore to a concrete plant.

1028
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,790
一家混凝土厂
It's on Eastern Avenue.

1029
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,370
那条大道上只此一家 不可能会错过的
It's the only one on the street. You can't miss it.

1030
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,450
有个人会在那里跟你碰头
A guy's gonna meet you there.

1031
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,750
一个叫费利的娘炮
A fairy named Ferrie.

1032
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,160
往前开 再倒车进去
Pull it forward, then back it in.

1033
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,370
他们会往车里装一些货
You'll pick up some things.

1034
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,910
他们会给你一些文件 以防你在路上被拦下来
He'll give you some paperwork in case you get stopped.

1035
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,370
你把车开去佛罗里达州
You drive down to Florida.

1036
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,500
在杰克逊维尔外有一个赛狗场
A dog track outside Jacksonville.

1037
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,620
就把车留在那里
You leave it there.

1038
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:53,200
一个耳朵宽大的家伙亨特 会在那里等你
A guy with big ears named Hunt will meet you there.

1039
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:58,000
他会给你一辆车子开回费城
He's gonna give you a car to drive back to Philly.

1040
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,160
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

1041
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,410
你在看我的耳朵
You looking at my ears?

1042
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,540
什么
Sorry?

1043
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,370
我的耳朵 你是在看我的耳朵吗
My ears. Are you looking at my ears?

1044
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,040
不是
No.

1045
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:29,120
我做了个手术 让我不需要再被人盯着耳朵
I had an operation, so there's no need for anyone looking at my ears anymore.

1046
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,540
我不是在看你的耳朵
I ain't looking at your ears.

1047
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,200
离开这里 快走吧
Get out of here. Go on.

1048
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,830
在猪湾 一切都没有按计划进行
in the Bay of Pigs. Nothing went as planned.

1049
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,370
伞兵们无法
Paratroopers were unable

1050
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:05,370
炸掉海滩地区的公路 卡斯特罗迅速
to blow up roadways along the beach area. Castro raced

1051
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,870
前往现场
toward the scene.

1052
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,160
地下组织也许炸毁了道路 但它并不知情
The underground might have blown up the roads, but it knew nothing.

1053
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,790
很快 卡斯特罗就让炮兵部队
Soon Castro had artillery firing

1054
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:13,700
在滩头阵地开火 他的飞机摧毁了入侵船只
on the beachhead. His planes destroyed invading ships

1055
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,250
船上有一支旅 还有重要弹药军备
carrying a brigade of men and vital ammunition.

1056
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,660
无法开拓滩头阵地 而伞兵们
The beachhead could not be enlarged, and paratroopers

1057
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:22,830
努力杀回海滩 入侵者在海滩上
were fighting their way back to the shore where the invaders

1058
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,700
被压制了 没有空中掩护 船也没有开火保护
were pinned down. 1,500 men had been dumped on the shore without air cover

1059
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:28,500
就把1500名士兵抛弃在海滩上
or protective fire from ships.

1060
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:32,620
卡斯特罗只能等到他们耗尽了弹药 才把他们一举歼灭
Castro had to wait only until they ran out of ammunition before mopping them up.

1061
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,950
后来卡斯特罗准备带着记者 趾高气扬地在入侵区活动
Later, Castro was to strut around the invasion area with newsmen

1062
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,750
并详细说明犯下的错误 他掌握了充分的材料
and expound on the errors that had been made. He had ample material.

1063
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,830
美国早已经颜面扫地
The United States, already humiliated,

1064
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:45,790
现在还被世界上大部分国家谴责
stood condemned by most of the countries of the world.

1065
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:46,830
见鬼
Ah, shit!

1066
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:50,160
就像我预测的一样 他们偷袭古巴
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

1067
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,910
而罗伯特就来对付我跟工会
Boobie comes after me and the union.

1068
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:57,870
他是想花很少的钱做宣传 不过就是这样 这就是他现在干的事
He's looking for cheap publicity. That's all it is. That's what he's doing.

1069
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:59,370
这事会被淡忘的
It's gonna blow over.

1070
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:01,500
这事怎么会被淡忘
How's it gonna blow over?

1071
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,120
他们永远不会忘记...
They'll never forget...

1072
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:07,250
-我资助了尼克松   -冷静一下 吉米 拜托
-that I gave money to Nixon!   -Calm down. Jimmy, please.

1073
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:08,370
我们会处理这事
We're gonna handle this.

1074
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:11,500
一些元老会跟肯尼迪家的老头子谈
Some of the old-timers are gonna get to old man Kennedy.

1075
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,120
他有个小病 但是...
He's a little sick, but--

1076
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,330
小病？
Sick?

1077
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,080
他中风了 那不叫小病
He had a fucking stroke. That's not sick.

1078
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,660
就是说他...他快进棺材了
That's you're... you're close to the grave.

1079
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,580
他都被气得发紫了
He's become a fucking eggplant.

1080
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,000
这事你不能怪任何人
You can't blame anybody for that.

1081
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,620
我没有怪任何人 就算是怪 也是怪肯尼迪
I'm not blaming anybody. But if I were, it's the Kennedys.

1082
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,790
他的孩子杀死了他 我可以告诉你
His kids killed him. I'll tell you that.

1083
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:32,330
他还没死 但他快死了 活不久了
He's not dead, but he's going. He's going.

1084
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,080
是他们杀死了他 他们能让任何人犯心脏病
They killed him. They'd give anybody a heart attack.

1085
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,410
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

1086
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,580
去工作
I'm going to work.

1087
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,830
回去睡觉
Go back to sleep.

1088
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,330
我所能说的就是 我们绝不会罢休
All I can say, we will not stop.

1089
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,500
我们已经坚持了50年了
We been doing that for fifty years!

1090
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,410
有什么好处
What good does it do?

1091
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,750
让律师们来开卡车吧
Let the lawyers drive a truck.

1092
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,830
他们需要铅笔 纸还有墨水垫
They need their pencils and papers and their ink pads.

1093
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,250
那就完全不一样了
That's a whole other story.

1094
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,910
但我们一定能挺过去的
But we're gonna get through this.

1095
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,370
他们用法律狗屁来打压我们 我们一定能熬过去的
We're gonna get through this legal bullshit garbage they're throwing at us.

1096
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:35,160
我们一定能熬过去 因为蠢材肯尼迪想达到一个目的
We're gonna get through it because "Boobie" Kennedy wants something

1097
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:40,000
并不意味着那个纨绔子弟就能实现它 你们明白吗
doesn't mean the rich boy is gonna get it. You understand?

1098
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:43,160
我不在乎他的目的 他肯定不能达到这个目的
I don't care what he wants. He's not gonna get it!

1099
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:48,200
他肯定不能实现目的 因为...
He's not gonna get it because...

1100
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,950
我们是这个国家
we... are the biggest,

1101
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,580
最大的
and best,

1102
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,000
最好的
and most honest union

1103
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,410
最诚实的工会
in this country!

1104
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,500
对 我就等着这个
Yes, I waited for that!

1105
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:07,410
你们都知道我现在脑子里想的 那个最重要的词
And you know the operative word I'm talking about.

1106
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,330
团结
Solidarity.

1107
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:12,120
而且团结有成效 对我们所有人都有用
And it works. It works for all of us.

1108
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,540
而且对我们这位朋友 法兰克菲茨西蒙斯有用
And it works for our friend here Frank Fitzsimmons!

1109
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,750
法兰克菲茨西蒙斯
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

1110
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:22,750
是我的常务副总裁
my Executive Vice President. If there's anyone

1111
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,370
能胜任这份工作的人就是这一位
that can do this job, it's this man here.

1112
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,620
有了他的协助
And with him at my back,

1113
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,160
我们就只会越来越好
where are we gonna go but up!

1114
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,290
对吗 菲茨
Is that right, Fitz?

1115
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:36,120
完全同意 吉米
All the way, Jimmy!

1116
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,450
霍法
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1117
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,870
一个工会人
A union man!

1118
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,370
我感觉他们喜欢菲茨 毫无疑问
I felt they liked Fitz. No two ways about it.

1119
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:00,950
你提携了菲茨 希望他不负所望
You... you gave Fitz some build up. I hope he deserves it.

1120
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,830
为什么 菲茨有什么不妥
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

1121
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:09,660
我说不上来 我不想贬低那家伙 但是...
I don't know. I don't want to knock the guy, but...

1122
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,040
你不是在贬低他 直接告诉我
Well, you're not knocking him. Just tell me...

1123
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,660
告诉我你的感觉
tell me what you feel.

1124
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:16,620
我肯定他是个忠心的人
He's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

1125
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,660
他人不错 但是
He's a nice guy, but

1126
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,000
他不够精明 不够聪明
he ain't that sharp. He ain't that smart.

1127
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,200
他还像是个...他经常打高尔夫球
He's also like a... He plays a lot of fucking golf.

1128
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:25,410
他打高尔夫球？
He plays golf?

1129
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,290
当二把手就得选这样的
That's what you want from a number two.

1130
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,370
你不想找太聪明的人
You don't want somebody too smart.

1131
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:33,450
你想要个不错的人 大家都喜欢的
You want a nice guy. People like him.

1132
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,500
不傻 但是是一个
Not dumb, but somebody

1133
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:39,080
你可以让他走在你后头 不怕他背后捅你一刀的那种
you can have walking behind you without getting knifed.

1134
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,790
-希望你是对的   -我向来都是对的
-Well, I hope you're right.   -I'm always right.

1135
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:44,700
我对菲茨非常放心
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

1136
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,160
我需要担心的是矮子
It's the Little Guy I have to worry about.

1137
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,450
你明白我的意思
You know what I'm saying.

1138
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,410
矮子
The Little Guy.

1139
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,660
他才是我担心的人
That's my worry.

1140
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:56,910
那个兔崽子
That son of a bitch.

1141
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,450
怎么了
What's the matter?

1142
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,450
没事 你说得对
Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

1143
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,450
我说得对 是的
I'm right. Yeah.

1144
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,290
-你不是觉得困惑吧   -完全不会
-You're not perplexed, are you?   -Not at all.

1145
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:10,000
我跟你说了我对菲茨的看法 普罗 你知道的
I... I told you how I felt about Fitz. Pro. You know.

1146
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,500
好 因为有时候我感觉
Good, because sometimes I feel

1147
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,540
只有我一个人能看透那个龟孙子
I'm the only one who sees right through that cocksucker.

1148
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:17,370
让我们来举杯
So let's raise a glass

1149
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,410
敬最伟大的人
To the greatest guy

1150
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:27,540
560工会何其幸运能拥有这样的人
560 is lucky enough to ever have

1151
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:31,200
你是我们的英雄
You're our boy

1152
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:34,370
托尼普罗
Tony Pro

1153
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:38,790
我们全支持你
We're all yours

1154
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,410
矮子就是托尼普罗文扎诺
The Little Guy was Tony Provenzano.

1155
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,790
人称托尼普罗
They called him Tony Pro.

1156
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:46,950
他是新泽西州尤宁城
He was a capo in a big Jersey crew and

1157
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,120
本地560工会的主席 还是泽西市一个大帮派的首脑
the president of Local 560 in Union City, New Jersey.

1158
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,370
普罗和吉米...
Pro and Jimmy...

1159
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,540
是一起发展起来的 他俩曾经有一阵子走得很近
came up together and they were close for a while.

1160
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,790
你们辛苦工作
You turl, you work,

1161
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:29,370
而企业国王们
while the corporation kings

1162
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,500
和工业王子们
and princes of industry,

1163
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:36,290
他们有着巨额的支出帐户跟薪水 还有豪华游艇
with their vast expense accounts and salary and luxurous yachts,

1164
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:39,870
却致力于毁灭我们
have dedicated themselves to our destruction.

1165
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:41,040
打倒他们
Down on them!

1166
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:45,870
我不需要任何人告诉我托尼普罗的事
I didn't need nobody to tell me about Tony Pro.

1167
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,450
不 我需要知道什么呢 我知道的够多了
No, no. What did I need to know? I knew enough.

1168
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,290
就是这个人让萨利虫掐死
This... this is a man who had Sally Bugs strangle

1169
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,200
绰号"三根指头"的托尼卡斯特利托
Tony "Three Fingers" Castellito

1170
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:03,910
仅仅因为"三根指头"在工会里 越来越得势
just because Three Fingers was coming up big in the union.

1171
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,450
可那是他的自己人
And it was his own guy, his own guy.

1172
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:27,370
托尼普罗很担心卡斯特利托会打败他
Tony Pro was so fucking worried that this guy was gonna beat him out,

1173
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,950
他让萨利虫把卡斯特利托掐死后
that after he had Sally Bugs strangle the guy,

1174
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,870
把尸体扔进了树木碎片机
he had Sally stick him in a fucking tree shredder.

1175
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:35,870
这样就没有竞争了 甚至杜绝了死人跟他竞争
That way there'd be no competition, not even from the grave.

1176
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,330
他完全不受控制了
He's out of control.

1177
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:39,160
你要怎样对付他
What can you do with him?

1178
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,620
他偷每个人的钱
He's got a hand in everybody's pocket.

1179
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,580
敲诈卡车公司的钱
Shaking down the trucking companies.

1180
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,830
威胁别人
Threatening people.

1181
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,040
偶尔威胁别人我可以理解
You threaten people once in awhile, I understand.

1182
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,370
但总是这么干
But all the time?

1183
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:55,080
这让我们招人耳目
It's drawing attention to us.

1184
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,330
那种人破坏了工会的名声
Guys like that give the unions a bad name.

1185
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,000
必须采取措施
Something's got to be done.

1186
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:05,080
我是认真的 必须采取措施
I mean it. Something's gotta be done.

1187
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,580
那是托尼的本性...
Tony being Tony...

1188
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,450
那可不容易
that ain't... that ain't easy.

1189
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,660
我不是那个意思
I don't mean that.

1190
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,040
不是那个意思
Not... not that.

1191
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,370
我只是说找些了解工会的工人
I'm just saying get working guys

1192
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,950
像你跟我这样的
who know the unions, card-carrying Teamsters,

1193
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,200
正式注册的兄弟会成员
like you and me,

1194
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,200
开始参加工会竞选
to start running,

1195
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,040
接手一些本地工会
take over some of the locals.

1196
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,750
你怎么看
What do you think?

1197
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,500
他肯定不会喜欢的
He ain't gonna like that.

1198
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,080
去他的 他算什么东西 他就是个歹徒
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he? He's a gangster.

1199
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,660
我是工会主席
I'm the president of the union.

1200
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,290
我只需要一些
All I need is some guys

1201
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:39,580
熟悉情况的人
who know their ways around.

1202
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,870
知道如何自持的人 仅此而已
Know how to handle themselves. That's all.

1203
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,120
所以我才希望你能竞选...
That's why I want you to run for president...

1204
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,290
本地326工会的主席
of Local 326.

1205
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:53,160
法兰克 你对我来说就像家人 你知道的
You're like family to me, Frank. You know.

1206
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:54,950
你 艾琳
You, Irene,

1207
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,700
还有你们的姑娘们
the girls.

1208
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:58,040
可爱的佩琪
The lovely Peggy.

1209
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,950
但这不是我请求你的原因
But that's not why I'm doing this.

1210
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,950
我给你的一切都是你自己努力得来的
I'm not giving you anything you didn't earn,

1211
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,620
是你应得的
you didn't deserve.

1212
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:07,950
你怎么看
What do you think?

1213
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:13,080
我...不知道该说什么 吉米
I... I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

1214
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:15,120
就说你愿意
Well, just say you'll do it.

1215
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,750
你就只需要说这句话
That's all you got to say.

1216
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,290
而且我能保证你一定能赢
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

1217
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,040
你竞选326工会主席时...
When you run for president...

1218
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,580
一定能赢
of 326, you're gonna win.

1219
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,200
我保证
I guarantee it.

1220
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:32,160
好吧 行 我愿意竞选 好的
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

1221
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,870
你说真
You mean it, huh?

1222
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:37,200
说真的 我...很荣幸
Yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

1223
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:39,540
我爱你 我真的爱你
I love you. I just love you, you know.

1224
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,750
我爱你 老弟
I love you, man.

1225
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:43,000
是真的
I can't tell ya.

1226
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,000
天啊 这真是太好了
Gee. This is so good, you know.

1227
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,290
我感觉自己又能呼吸了
I feel like I can breathe again.

1228
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,410
这很奇怪
It's so funny.

1229
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,080
莫名其妙地 我...
Somehow, I...

1230
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:55,290
我也说不上来 我以为你会拒绝
I don't know. I thought you would've said no.

1231
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,120
真高兴你答应了
I'm glad you said yes.

1232
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:06,620
你从不表露自己的感受 很难看透你的想法
You never reveal how you feel. It's hard to tell.

1233
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,040
我很荣幸 吉米
I'm honored, Jimmy.

1234
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,290
我不...知道该说什么
I don't... I don't know what to say.

1235
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:12,250
我很荣幸
I'm honored.

1236
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:14,660
那很好
Well, that's good.

1237
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,250
这让我心里舒服多了
That makes me feel good.

1238
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,830
我喘过气来了
Oh, I can breathe.

1239
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:23,290
太棒了
That's so great.

1240
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,540
我能说什么 我拥有的一切全是多亏了吉米
What can I... I say? I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.

1241
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,910
他把我从一个运肉卡车里带了出来 给了我一个开始
He took me out of a meat truck and gave me my start.

1242
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,620
他给了我我的第一个授权 我的第一个工会
He gave me my first charter. He gave me my first union.

1243
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,580
你好吗
How are ya?

1244
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:10,330
我是法兰克希兰 326工会的新主席
Frank Sheeran, the new president of Union 326.

1245
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:12,290
-我想自我介绍一下   -幸会
-I wanted to introduce myself.   -Nice to meet ya.

1246
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,830
-你怎么称呼   -我叫艾尔
-What's your name?   -My name's Al.

1247
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,290
幸会 艾尔
Nice to meet ya, Al.

1248
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:18,330
-一点小意思   -不 不需要
-A little something.   -No, no. Don't need it.

1249
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:19,750
-确定？  -确定
-Sure?   -Yeah.

1250
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:23,830
我只是过来自我介绍 有任何需要就跟我联系
Just came to introduce myself. You need anything, get in touch with me.

1251
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:24,750
你确定
You sure?

1252
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:28,040
如果他们可以证明
If they can prove

1253
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,870
你从他们那里偷了东西 他们会要求你说出同伙的名字
you stole from them what they're gonna want are names.

1254
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:36,830
你会说出同伙的名字 好让你不坐牢吗
Would you give up names to keep from going to jail?

1255
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,290
不会
No.

1256
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:42,580
那你就没什么好担心的 律师会处理的
You got nothing to worry about. The lawyers will take care of it.

1257
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,580
走80号州际公路往西 借道宾夕法尼亚州
The Interstate 80 West through the rest of Pennsylvania,

1258
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:02,500
然后再直穿俄亥俄州 一直去到托莱多
and then... then we'd go across Ohio all the way to Toledo,

1259
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:06,290
然后走75号公路往北去底特律
and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.

1260
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:09,330
我们还是能及时赶到那里
And we'd still get there on time.

1261
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,450
法官大人 顾问向我的委托人建议
Your Honor, counsel advised my client

1262
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:19,040
他的妻子当卡车公司的股东是合法的
that it was legal for his wife to be part owner of a trucking business.

1263
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,250
即便如此 当麦克莱伦委员会质疑其合法性时
Still, when the McClellan Committee challenged its legality,

1264
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,540
她立刻从公司退了股
she withdrew from the company immediately.

1265
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:26,700
这件事就应该了结了
That should be the end of the matter.

1266
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:30,620
我的委托人在13次大陪审团调查中
There has not been one indictment served against my client

1267
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,910
没有一次被起诉
in thirteen grand jury investigations.

1268
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:38,870
法官大人 这个例子证明了 屡次受挫的司法部
Your Honor, this is an example of a personal vendetta against my client,

1269
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:42,580
及司法部长罗伯特肯尼迪
against his family by a frustrated Justice Department

1270
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:45,040
对我的委托人及他的家庭有个人宿怨
and the Attorney General, Robert Kennedy.

1271
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:52,950
他有枪
He's got a gun!

1272
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,330
把枪从他手里抢下来
Get that gun out of his hand!

1273
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,620
那不是一把真枪吧
That was not a real gun, was it?

1274
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,370
那把枪是怎么进来的 它是怎么被弄进来这里的
How'd that gun get in? How'd it get in here?

1275
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:16,040
这不是我的错
It wasn't my fault!

1276
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,500
我的查基
Oh, my Chuckie!

1277
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,410
大家看 他是我儿子
Hey, it's my son!

1278
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,950
这是我的孩子 他是我养大的
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

1279
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,910
你们看到他了吗 看到他做的事吗
You see him? You see what he did?

1280
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,620
我跟大家说
I'll tell you this.

1281
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,700
他开枪射我 里面好像是石弹之类的
He shot at me, and it was like a pellet or something.

1282
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:36,160
我只是感觉到了一股力 甚至不是软气枪的那种力道
I just felt an impact, like I was shot not even with a BB gun.

1283
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,700
甚至更轻一点
Something even lighter.

1284
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,250
但我向他冲了过去
But I charged him.

1285
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:42,080
我当时向他冲了过去 查基刚才 也冲了上来 我给他做了个好榜样
I charged him and so did Chuckie. I taught him well.

1286
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:46,250
要冲过去按住那些持枪的人
You charge a guy, always charge a guy with a gun.

1287
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:47,620
看到拿着刀子的 要掉头就跑
With a knife, you run away.

1288
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,870
远离刀子 制服持枪的
Run away from a knife. You charge with a gun,

1289
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:52,330
远离持刀的
with a knife you run.

1290
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:54,910
你们听听 我还押韵了
Hey! I rhymed!

1291
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:00,250
这听起来很疯狂 但某个位高权重者 让我开枪射吉米霍法
It sounds crazy, but a higher power told me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

1292
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:01,160
跟我来
Come with me.

1293
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,410
在纳什维尔有很多疯子 法兰克
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

1294
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,330
过来这里吧 法兰克
Come on down, Frank.

1295
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:07,200
现在我这里就有一个
I got one of them with me now.

1296
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:11,580
过来这里 巴吞鲁日的埃迪帕汀现在跟我在一起
Get down here. Eddie Partin, from Baton Rouge, is here with me.

1297
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:12,790
我马上去
I'll get right down.

1298
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:14,620
别挡我的道 伙计们
Out of my way, boys.

1299
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,700
是不是布伦南先生先说 或者你是否记得他先说了一些
Did Mr. Brennan first say, or do you remember him first saying

1300
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,620
类似"我不得不修改协议
something about, "I had to change the deal.

1301
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,870
我得让霍法加入"的话
I have to cut Hoffa in"?

1302
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:33,830
时间顺序不正是这个案子的关键吗
Wasn't that the chronology of the whole thing?

1303
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:36,450
我不知道他修改了协议
I don't know he changed the deal,

1304
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,540
但我理解的是布伦南
but it was my understanding that Brennan

1305
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:41,120
是在为自己说话
was speaking for himself.

1306
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,950
这个女人很愤怒
That's an angry woman.

1307
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,870
她是个老师
She was a teacher I think.

1308
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:49,660
我们现在研究的是这个 这个很难接近
What we're looking at is this one. This one is not approachable.

1309
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,250
她不容易攻破
She'd be a tough nut to crack.

1310
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:56,200
将招呼 截停并搜查 所有开往古巴的船只
will hail, stop, and search all ships bound for Cuba.

1311
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:59,830
如果船长不停船 将使用武力让他们停下来
If the ships' captains do not stop, force will be used to stop them.

1312
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:06,660
你有没有向大陪审团做这个声明 我代你读出来
Did you make this statement to the Grand Jury? I'll read it for you.

1313
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,830
"布伦南来找我 说了一些类 大意是他会继续..."
"Brennan came to me and said words to the effect he's gonna go ahead..."

1314
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,540
他有一个餐厅
He's got a restaurant.

1315
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,660
有任何违规的情况吗
Any violations?

1316
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,040
我宁愿挑女人下手
I'd rather stick with the women.

1317
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:15,700
她们更容易接近
They're more approachable.

1318
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:19,660
在古巴 军事行动的中程导弹
in Cuba of operational medium-range missiles.

1319
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:23,870
如果发射其中一个导弹 它可能会携载一个核弹头
If one of the missiles is launched, it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.

1320
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:28,830
可以击中美国东南部 华盛顿南部的 任何地方
It could hit any spot in the southeast United States, south of Washington.

1321
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:33,080
我们将没有办法拦截导弹 或者发出关于导弹的警告
We would have no way of intercepting it or issuing a warning about it.

1322
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,540
这个嫁给了一个姓普莱薛特的州警官
This one's married to a State Trooper named Plechette.

1323
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,910
很好
That's good.

1324
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,830
我们认识人吗
We know anyone?

1325
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,370
我们本地工会有个人 以前当警察的
We got an ex-cop, in the Local.

1326
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,580
很好
That's good.

1327
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,910
我们所有的军事力量 已经进入高度警戒状态
All our forces are on increased alert.

1328
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:13,330
说他会继续 并成立一家卡车租赁公司
said he's gonna go ahead and set up a company to lease trucks.

1329
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:16,370
但后来他打电话给我说 以下为引言
But later, he phoned me and said, quote:

1330
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:20,660
"我得修改协议 因为我得让霍法加入生意"
"I gotta change the deal 'cause I gotta cut Hoffa in on the deal."

1331
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:21,870
这是否正确 先生
Is that accurate, sir?

1332
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:24,290
这个是另一个可以下手的对象
This one's another possibility.

1333
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:28,290
她已婚但是有情人

1372
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,950
肯尼迪夫人

1373
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,160

It takes more than an instant to make a real cup of coffee.

1382

1402
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,200

罗伯特的刁难结束了
That was the end of it with Bobby.

1407
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,750
他不再担任司法部长了 已经结束了

1408
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,000
罗伯特对我们的宿怨过去了
Bobby's vendetta was over. With us.

1409

霍法先生
Mr. Hoffa,

1410
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:05,450
你因损害了这个国家的灵魂 而被判有罪
you stand here convicted of having tampered with the soul of this nation.

1411
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,700
但在纳什维尔的 那个陪审团的事还没完
But there was still that jury thing in Nashville.

1412
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:10,910
这个国家的灵魂...
The soul of this nation...

1413
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:14,200
在于其神圣的司法程序
lies in its sacred processes of justice.

1414
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,330
不能扰乱司法
Justice must be done.

1415
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:19,950
鉴于你扰乱这些程序的恶劣企图...
And for your wicked attempts to corrupt these processes...

1416
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,200
你必须接受法律惩罚
justice will be done on you.

1417
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,200
我们终于扳倒他了
We got him now.

1418
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,410
女士们 先生们 我们成功了
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it!

1419
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:50,200
但吉米把一切都安排好了
But... but Jimmy, he had it all set up.

1420
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,700
尽管你知道 看起来工会的负责人
Although you knew it was supposed to look like Fitz

1421
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:55,330
是菲茨
was the one in charge,

1422
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:59,120
事实上 他通过比尔布法利诺 和管理吉米的借贷业务的艾伦多夫曼
he gave Fitz his orders through Bill Bufalino and Allen Dorfman,

1423
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,580
向菲茨传达命令
who ran Jimmy's loans.

1424
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:03,120
里面情况好吗 一切都...
Things are good in here? Everything is--

1425
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,290
一切都糟透了
Everything's terrible.

1426
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:08,200
晚上不敢睡觉 因为怕会被人捅刀子
You don't sleep at night 'cause you're afraid someone's gonna knife you.

1427
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,370
你的气色不错
You look okay.

1428
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:11,410
菲茨在哪 他迟到了
Wh... where's Fitz? He's late.

1429
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:14,700
我们本来是要在前门跟他碰头的
We were gonna meet him in the front.

1430
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,950
-他来了   -你到底去了哪里
-Here he is here he is.   -Where the hell have you been?

1431
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,120
你在这里干什么 你为什么还要来
What are you doing here? Why did you come at all?

1432
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,830
你不知道
