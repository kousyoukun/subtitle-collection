In the Still of the Night - The Five Satins

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,940
* In the still of the night *

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,340
* I held you *

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,590
* Held you tight *

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,440
* 'Cause I love *

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,940
* Love you so *

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,630
* Promise I'll never *

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,190
* Let you go *

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,090
* In the still of the night *

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,980
* In the still of the night *

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,190
* I remember *

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,520
* That night in May *

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,100
* The stars were bright above *

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,880
* I'll hope and I'll pray *

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:33,420
* To keep Your precious love... *

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,090
When I was young, I thought house painters painted houses.

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,710
What did I know?

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,340
I was a working guy.

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,710
A business agent for Teamster Local 107 out of South Philly.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,500
One of a thousand working stiffs...

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,800
until I wasn't no more.

27
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,840
And then...

28
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,000
I started painting houses...

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,880
myself.

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,480
In this particular matter,

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,710
the whole thing was built around the wedding.

32
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,090
Bill Bufalino's daughter was getting married in Detroit.

33
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,810
Bill was a Teamster lawyer, but more important,

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,880
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

35
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,520
Now, Russell didn't want to fly,

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,500
so I was gonna drive him to the wedding.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,730
He wanted to take care of some business along the way,

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,750
which in Russell's case meant only one thing:

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,310
Money... collecting it.

40
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,750
So we'd drive.

41
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,060
Him and his wife Carrie and me and my wife Irene.

42
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,130
Or I call her Reenie.

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,750
I figured we would take 476 out of Philly,

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,600
and then we go up to Pittston and pick up Russ,

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,230
which is usually how we did it,

46
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,350
and then Interstate 80 West through the rest of Pennsylvania,

47
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,340
and then we'd go across Ohio, all the way to Toledo,

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,800
and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.

49
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,350
It was gonna take about three days

50
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,690
with all the business breaks and cigarette stops,

51
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,630
since Russell didn't allow nobody to smoke in the car.

52
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,890
He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky

53
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,500
convinced him to stop smoking

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,020
when they were getting kicked out of their casinos in Cuba

55
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,920
and getting shot at by Castro.

56
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,190
I don't know. It might have been one of those,

57
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,980
"Please-God-if-I-ever-get-out- of-this-fucking-thing-alive-

58
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,440
I'll-never-smoke-again things too."

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,810
But I do know that from Castro on,

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,350
Russ wouldn't allow nobody to smoke in his car,

61
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,670
not even Carrie.

62
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,880
Can we stop soon?

63
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,630
We're only in the car two minutes, honey.

64
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,770
We're not even near the highway.

65
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,750
I know, Russell. But you don't like to stop on the highway.

66
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,440
Well, it's not that so much.

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,130
They don't let you stop on the highway.

68
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,420
Okay, so then we'll smoke in the car.

69
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,460
And what about my cataracts?

70
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,550
I'll crack the window.

71
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,550
Carrie, I made a vow. Remember?

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,250
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,170
Yeah, now I can't smoke on...

74
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,750
All right, and now I can't smoke.

75
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,000
See where we are?

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,090
Is... Is that...

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,000
What are those odds?

78
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,250
What's the problem, kid?

79
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,390
I don't... I don't know. It sounds funny.

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,500
It stops, it starts, it loses power.

81
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,090
Let me see if I can give you a hand.

82
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,710
Let me see. Check all these plugs.

83
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,090
Spark plugs are okay.

84
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
The distributor cap's okay.

85
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,590
Good.

86
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,710
It's gotta be something with... with this.

87
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,960
Timing chain.

88
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,840
This is what this is. There's a cap on it.

89
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
This cap is loose. It ain't supposed to be loose.

90
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,640
So that means they're getting worn out.

91
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,670
You just gotta...

92
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,250
Try that now. Tighten it up.

93
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,960
I can drive 'em. I can't fix 'em.

94
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,050
You're back in business, kid.

95
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,420
Thanks.

96
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,390
- I owe you anything? - No.

97
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,170
No, you don't owe me anything.

98
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,600
Thanks.

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,880
- Frank. - Hey, Frank. How ya doing?

100
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,880
What's your name?

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,460
Where you from?

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,520
- Philly. - Oh, you're from Philly.

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,300
Yeah.

104
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,750
Where you hang out there?

105
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,960
Callahan's.

106
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,640
Bocce Club.

107
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,670
But it's a bar, it's not a bocce club.

108
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,020
Oh, yeah. You play bocce?

109
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,800
Nah.

110
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,190
All right, Frankie... get that fixed.

111
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,020
Because it'll go again on you, I'm telling you.

112
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,690
- Thank you. - All right.

113
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,720
I will. Thanks again.

114
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,750
Good luck, buddy.

115
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,130
I mean, I thought maybe he owned the gas station.

116
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,300
'Cause he owned something, you could tell.

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,800
Yeah, it turns out he owned the whole road.

118
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,050
I Hear You Knockin' - Smiley Lewis

119
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,050
* You went away and left me long time ago *

120
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,010
* And now you're knocking on my door *

121
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,500
This one?

122
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,160
* I hear you knocking *

123
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,750
Salute! Drink up, fellas.

124
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,130
God bless.

125
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,750
Let's go. Let's go. Let's make some money today.

126
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,710
It's a bar.

127
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,090
Say hello to your wife, huh?

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,100
I got a way you can earn, to push those hindquarters.

129
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,770
There's a guy in here, he'll pay a lot of money for them.

130
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,500
Come on, let's shoot this first and then we'll talk business.

131
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,130
At the other end of the bar, at twelve o'clock...

132
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,060
You see him? He's got a rescinding hairline.

133
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,560
Yeah, you'll make a lot of money with him.

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,460
See him there? Skinny Razor. He owns the place.

135
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,460
Razor?

136
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,850
He shylocks and runs a little book out of the joint.

137
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,880
He's got a lot of good action, good connections.

138
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,670
- Razor's his name? - Yeah, he used to work at a butcher shop.

139
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,610
My friend Frank Irish is here.

140
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,710
The one I told you about?

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,800
- Oh, the truck. - Yeah, hindquarters.

142
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,630
Frank Sheeran.

143
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,500
You like steak?

144
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,630
I do.

145
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,170
I deliver steak.

146
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,800
Do ya?

147
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,800
Good steak.

148
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,420
I could deliver you steak.

149
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,590
- Could ya? - I could.

150
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,300
Good price too. The best.

151
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,750
- We'll talk later. - Okay.

152
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,750
Thanks, Skinny.

153
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,700
It's freezing out there.

154
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,050
I don't mind it.

155
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,460
Not me. I hate it.

156
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,630
Hey, do me a favor. When you go outside...

157
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,920
put the seal on for me.

158
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,850
- All right. I gotta go out anyway. - I owe you one.

159
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,000
* You'd better go back to your used-to-be *

160
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,560
* Because your love's no good to me *

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,090
* I hear you knocking *

162
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,170
* But you can't come in *

163
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,500
* I hear you knocking *

164
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,460
* Go back where you've been *

165
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,880
* They call, they call me the fat man *

166
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,250
* 'Cause I weigh two hundred pounds... *

167
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,250
There you go, Frank.

168
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,630
- See you next time. - All right, Tony. Thanks.

169
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,000
Much better, Frank.

170
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,940
I don't go near Choice. I only do Prime. That's it.

171
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,590
Can I get some more for next Tuesday?

172
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,250
How many you want?

173
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,300
At least five.

174
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,710
Okay. Five, you got.

175
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,730
- Amen. - Amen.

176
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,840
Amen.

177
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,050
What the fuck is this?

178
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,590
Tony, I don't...

179
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,240
What the fuck is this, Frank?

180
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,500
I don't... I don't know.

181
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,420
I mean...

182
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,420
I don't load the truck.

183
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,350
The loaders are supposed to load the truck.

184
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,640
Maybe they didn't do their work. I don't know.

185
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,140
You didn't realize you were driving a light horse?

186
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,090
No. I just...

187
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,230
Nothing. It felt fine.

188
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,270
Oh, come on, Frank. Come on.

189
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm telling you. I...

190
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,480
God's truth. I just don't know what happened.

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,880
I don't know. Maybe some...

192
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,880
- It's empty. - I know it is.

193
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,210
I know it is.

194
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,420
What are you guys looking at? Go back to work.

195
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,090
All of youse!

196
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,340
What am I gonna tell the boss?

197
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,350
Well, I'm telling you that I don't know what's going on.

198
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,190
Just don't look at me 'cause I, you know...

199
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,480
Well, who else can I look at?

200
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,100
This is not gonna be on me, Frank.

201
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,230
- I'm telling you right now. - Not gonna be on me,

202
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,640
I just drive the truck. That's all I do.

203
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,440
Okay, Frank Sheeran. Am I saying that right?

204
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,670
Yeah, you said right.

205
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,500
Under the contract, thanks to Jimmy Hoffa...

206
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,500
management can only fire a driver on very specific charges.

207
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,880
- So, you ever show up late? - No.

208
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,730
- Do you have any moving violations? - No.

209
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,520
- Do you drink on the job? - No.

210
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,750
You ever hit anybody?

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,640
- On the job? - Yeah.

212
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,590
- No. - Okay.

213
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,800
What about stealing, that ain't grounds?

214
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,300
Well...

215
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,210
can they prove it?

216
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,350
I don't think so.

217
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,340
All right then, we don't have nothing to worry about.

218
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,670
If they can prove it,

219
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,670
they're just gonna want names from you. Accomplices.

220
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,920
That's all. You give them a couple of names, you go home.

221
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,500
Keep your job.

222
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,600
What do you think about that?

223
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,590
- Would you give them names? - No.

224
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,090
No names.

225
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,750
You know, I don't, uh...

226
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,800
I don't care whether you did it or not.

227
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,600
That makes no difference to me.

228
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,270
- Yeah, I know. - I'm here to defend you. Right?

229
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,250
Right.

230
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,770
What, you want to know if I did it or not?

231
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,550
Well...

232
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,350
I'm gonna defend you either way.

233
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,710
Yeah, all right, but...

234
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,670
I, I work hard for them when I ain't stealing from 'em.

235
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,730
Your Honor, if this was about right or wrong,

236
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,310
the company would have sought Mr. Sheeran's dismissal.

237
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,500
They didn't.

238
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,310
They only accused Mr. Sheeran

239
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,810
because the company hoped he could name conspirators,

240
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,880
which he couldn't do because they don't exist.

241
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,810
They don't exist because he didn't steal anything.

242
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,480
He didn't steal anything because he's an exemplary employee,

243
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,050
who in eight years has never taken a day of sick leave.

244
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,560
The only rule he ever broke is his own union's,

245
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,850
by helping others carry sides of beef from his truck

246
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,920
to their refrigerators in the dead of winter.

247
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,500
All rise.

248
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
Court is in session.

249
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,190
I'm dismissing this case with a warning.

250
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,190
Yes, Your Honor.

251
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,960
No, no, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

252
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,640
You bring another working man before this court

253
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,350
with threats instead of evidence,

254
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,020
believe me, you'll be sorry.

255
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,210
If I owned stock in this company, I would sell it.

256
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,140
I don't know how he did it, and I ain't gonna ask.

257
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,190
All I know is that Bill Bufalino got me out of

258
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,140
a case where I should never have gotten away with it.

259
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,640
I should've been down for the count.

260
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,920
People are gonna appreciate what you did today, Frank.

261
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,210
You know, they got families, they got kids.

262
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,500
They need those jobs.

263
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,270
Instead, we went out celebrating...

264
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,980
Russell!

265
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,500
...and I met what was gonna turn out to be

266
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,600
the rest of my life.

267
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,810
You know, I thought that was you walking in outside.

268
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,640
Yeah, yeah, you know, this is our place.

269
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,020
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

270
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,980
Frank, I want you to meet my cousin Russell Bufalino.

272
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,600
- How are ya? - Hi, nice to meet you.

273
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,850
You helped me with my truck a couple of months ago.

274
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,190
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. The timing chain.

275
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,690
- Yeah. - Did you get it fixed?

276
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,850
- I fixed it the next day, yeah. - Attaboy.

277
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,750
- Thanks again. - Oh, you're welcome.

278
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,920
My pleasure. I'm glad you fixed it.

279
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,100
You better watch.

280
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,550
There's a lot of tough guys around here. Did he tell ya?

281
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,390
You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?

282
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,130
No.

283
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,440
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

284
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,050
- Okay. - Thanks, Russell.

285
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,710
Your cousin saved my ass.

286
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,560
I could've lost the whole load.

287
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,310
Yeah, yeah. Well, he knows everything about trucks, really.

288
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,140
Yeah, he worked at Canada Dry for a long time.

289
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,190
- Vito, how are you? - Pleasure.

290
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,230
I think, uh... Let's take the booth.

291
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,640
Come on. You're gonna love this.

292
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,550
Maybe I didn't know who Russell Bufalino was back then,

293
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,690
but I'd seen enough pictures and stories in the newspapers

294
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,980
to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.

295
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,480
I mean, Bruno, he... he was just made

296
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,440
the new boss of Philadelphia.

297
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,560
He took care of everything from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.

298
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,590
That, I knew.

299
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,920
And that was all I had to know

300
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,890
to know that Russell Bufalino

301
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,710
was no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.

302
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,420
This bread is very good.

303
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,210
- Good, eh? - Yeah.

304
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,170
Where did an Irisher like you learn to speak Italian?

305
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,300
In Italy - the war.

306
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,800
Where?

307
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,630
Salerno.

308
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,000
Anzio.

309
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,340
Sicily...

310
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,560
around Catania.

311
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,500
Catania? I'm from Catania.

312
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,630
Yeah? I thought you had an accent like Catania.

313
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
How long were you in the war?

314
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,710
Four years.

315
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,420
411 days in combat...

316
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,000
122 at Anzio.

317
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,090
Forty-fifth Infantry.

318
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
Minchia.

319
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,620
- Yeah. - Minchia.

320
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,330
Yeah.

321
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,170
Were you afraid of dying?

322
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,170
Always afraid.

323
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,020
And don't let anybody tell you that they weren't afraid.

324
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,310
- That's a lot of bullshit. You know? - Yeah.

325
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,670
Everybody's afraid. And you pray a lot.

326
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,460
I prayed a lot.

327
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,440
I prayed that I'd never sin again as long as I live

328
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,090
if I could just get out of here.

329
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,850
But then the fighting starts

330
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,310
and then you forget about everything.

331
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,420
You're just trying to survive, stay alive.

332
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,250
Once I saw that I was getting through the war,

333
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,420
I looked around me, I said...

334
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,800
I said, "From now on, whatever happens, happens."

335
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,880
Che successe successe. Fuck it.

336
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,480
You know, you got orders, you follow them.

337
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,690
They tell you to bring some prisoners into... into the woods,

338
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,880
you know, and they don't tell you what to do...

339
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,170
But they just say, you know, "Hurry up."

340
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,520
It's crazy, but I never understood

341
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,920
how they would just keep digging

342
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,810
their own graves, you know. I mean...

343
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,800
Stop!

344
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,550
Raus!

345
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,210
Well, I mean, maybe they thought if they did a good job,

346
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,710
the guy with the gun

347
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,550
would change his mind.

348
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,670
Russell, he... he took a shine to me right away.

349
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,000
After a while,

350
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,300
he started giving me little things to do.

351
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,520
But then Angelo himself,

352
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,130
he started giving me little things to do too.

353
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,690
Russ's wife, Carrie,

354
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,350
her family goes all the way back, way, way back

355
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,210
to the same town in Sicily as the Bufalinos.

356
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,340
They talked about it all the time.

357
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,250
She came from mob royalty, if you want to call it that.

358
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,230
The Sciandras. To them, it was like they came over on the...

359
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,840
the Italian Mayflower.

360
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,050
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

361
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,460
Give me those clothes. I'll get rid of them.

362
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,130
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

363
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,590
Hey, Frank,

364
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,750
can we stop soon?

365
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,920
Yeah, yeah, well, ask your husband. Russell?

366
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,550
He's out cold.

367
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,770
No, no, I got it.

368
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,000
- Sure? - Yeah.

369
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,300
Where are we?

370
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,960
We're close to Lewisburg.

371
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,890
Let me know when we get there. Remind me.

372
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,210
- I got some stops to make. - Okay.

373
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,710
Russell had a piece of everything.

374
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,140
He had this store in Pittston called Penn Drape & Curtains.

375
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,800
And he ran everything out of there.

376
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,550
Who knew what it all was?

377
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,520
I mean, I'm sure the man had partners.

378
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,050
They always have partners.

379
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,000
Nobody keeps all the money.

380
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,130
But everybody listened to Russ. That I can tell you.

381
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,960
You wanted to bribe a judge, you asked Russell.

382
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,310
You didn't know how much to bribe him,

383
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,050
Russell was gonna tell you.

384
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,800
All right, all right. I'll be right there.

385
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,310
Come on. I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it.

386
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,300
You want to promote one of your guys,

387
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,600
Russ would tell you you could or you could not.

388
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,750
Do me a favor.

389
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,600
Go with Steve down to his place. Take Vito with you.

390
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,850
And just hang around for a while.

391
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,100
These guys keep coming around, so straighten them out.

392
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600
- I'll take care of it, Russ. - Okay.

393
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,810
- Thank you. - No problem.

394
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,980
Where's... Oh, here you are.

395
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,940
I'm right here.

396
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,640
You want to make somebody disappear,

397
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,560
you got to get Russell's permission.

398
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,170
You know, no two ways about it.

399
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,270
- No, I wasn't worried. - I didn't think so.

400
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,670
- Tell your father I said "Hi." - I'll tell him. Thanks.

401
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,770
What are you doing here? I just told Bruno.

402
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,850
You gotta go with Bruno.

403
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,520
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way. - Yeah. Take care.

404
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
And when you did something for Russ,

405
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000
you did it yourself.

406
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,920
Like Russ used to say...

407
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,480
When I ask somebody to take care of something for me,

408
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,890
I expect them to take care of it themselves.

409
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,500
I don't need two roads coming back to me.

410
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,380
When Anastasia got killed in the barbershop,

411
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,440
it was Russell they brought in to calm things down,

412
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,190
so that everybody wasn't just going around killing everybody

413
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,920
and it could all get straightened out.

414
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,130
We know what happened.

415
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,340
We can't change it. It is what it is.

416
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,050
Please tell my friend I'm happy to help.

417
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,500
You'd never know it by looking at this guy,

418
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,000
but all roads led back to Russ.

419
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,880
Where's the money?

420
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,880
- He don't have it. - He don't have it?

421
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,640
He said something about his mother...

422
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,730
Stop. Don't tell me.

423
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,590
Let me guess.

424
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,750
His mother died and the funeral set him back.

425
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,220
- Yeah? - Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

426
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,610
His fucking mother's...

427
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,240
fucking dying over and over for the last ten years.

428
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,460
What do I do?

429
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,460
Don't leave.

430
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,120
Here.

431
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,470
Just show it to him. Don't use it.

432
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,010
Look.

433
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,740
Hey, Frank.

434
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,670
Skinny wants to see you. You get in the car.

435
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,450
- I was just gonna go see him. - Get in the fucking car.

436
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,090
- I was just gonna... - Get in the fucking car!

437
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,140
- I was just gonna go see him! - Yeah, don't get cute with me.

438
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,410
You give me that bullshit about your mother.

439
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,610
Get in the fucking car!

440
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,970
Frank, I swear to God, I was just gonna...

441
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,250
Get in the fucking car!

442
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,580
You want to get cute with me?

443
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,540
All that fucking bullshit about your mother

444
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,270
and sick and all that and dying.

445
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,310
I swear, I was just gonna go see him.

446
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,430
I swear to God, I was gonna come see you tomorrow.

447
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,090
- Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. I swear to God.

448
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,880
Tomorrow. Here.

449
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,150
- What time? - What time do you want me?

450
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,190
One o'clock? I'll be here at 1:00.

451
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,860
One o'clock? What, are you sleeping in?

452
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,860
You tell me.

453
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,020
Ten o'clock. Here.

454
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,870
- Ten o'clock. - Tomorrow.

455
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,450
Tomorrow.

456
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,880
Swear on your mother. Swear on your mother!

457
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,080
- Swear on your mother! - I swear on my mother!

458
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,190
I swear on my mother!

459
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,440
What time you gonna be here tomorrow?

460
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,180
- I'll be here at ten o'clock. - Ten o'clock?

461
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,120
- Tomorrow. - Yeah.

462
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,330
- Here. - Yeah. Yeah.

463
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,280
I'll bring you the money tomorrow. The whole thing.

464
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,650
Get him out of here.

465
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,200
Get out of here. Get out of here.

466
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,410
- I swear to God, I'll be here. - Get out of here.

467
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,340
How am I supposed to get home?

468
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,250
- Get out of here. - Take the fucking bus!

469
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,260
Let his mother pick him up.

470
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,320
What's the matter with her?

471
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,670
Nothing. She knocked something over

472
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,270
at the grocery store and made a mess,

473
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,500
- and the grocer yelled at her. - He yelled at her?

474
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,870
Yeah, and he shoved her.

475
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,890
He shoved her?

476
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,010
Yeah.

477
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,290
Did he shove you?

478
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,130
Who was this? The guy at the store?

479
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,800
The grocery store on the corner? Joe?

480
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,520
Did he?

481
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,990
Honey, did he shove you?

482
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,740
Just answer me. Did he push you?

483
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,270
Did he shove you? Whatever it is, did he do that?

484
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,510
Let's go.

485
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,480
Frank.

486
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,560
Frank, he didn't mean it, the man. It just happened.

487
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,350
What do you mean, he didn't mean it?

488
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,880
He touched her. What, are you kidding me?

489
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,680
He has no right to push her. Touch her.

490
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,690
Not even put one pinky on her.

491
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,900
That's him, right?

492
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,390
Stay here. Stay here.

493
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,660
Frank, I'm sorry, but your kid was out of line.

494
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,480
- I only did what... - You touched my daughter?

495
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,530
God, I'm sorry.

496
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,790
No. Please. No, no, Frank.

497
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,270
Frank, please, please, please. No.

498
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,360
No, no, Frank! No!

499
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,190
- Take that, you motherfucker! - No! Come on!

500
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,050
Oh, my fucking hand. My fucking hand!

501
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,280
Dolores.

502
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,440
- Amen. - Amen.

503
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,710
Russell and Carrie baptized our new daughter, Dolores.

504
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,430
It was a wonderful occasion, and we were honored.

505
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,670
Everybody showed up.

506
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,350
- Amen. - Amen.

507
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,990
Amen.

508
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,970
- Amen. - Amen.

509
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,070
The only thing is,

510
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,020
you got more kids, you gotta earn more money.

511
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,700
You wanna make a quick ten grand?

512
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,390
Whispers DiTullio. Not the Whispers

513
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,960
they blew up in that car around the same time.

514
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,860
This was the other Whispers.

515
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,920
The good one who knew how to make money.

516
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,420
I got this place I front money to.

517
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,840
It's a good business. Really good business.

518
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,800
It's a laundry.

519
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,310
What they do is, they collect the linen, towels,

520
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,410
sheets and everything from

521
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,990
all the hotels and restaurants in Atlantic City.

522
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,450
They wash it, they iron it.

523
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,770
Normally, it's like a license to print fucking money.

524
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,340
Until recently.

525
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,920
There's this other company that opened up down in Delaware.

526
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,930
They're trying to put us out of business.

527
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,630
They're cutting their prices. They're scaring our drivers.

528
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,010
They're trying to take our customers from us.

529
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,530
To tell you the truth, I'm a little concerned.

530
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,800
Whenever anybody says they're a little concerned,

531
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,300
they're very concerned.

532
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,690
As a matter of fact,

533
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,480
I'm really more than a little concerned.

534
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,330
And when they say they're more than a little concerned,

535
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,980
they're desperate.

536
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,180
I want this fucking place bombed,

537
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,740
burnt, torched, whatever the fuck you have to do.

538
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,850
You were in the war. You know what to do.

539
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,630
Leave that fucking place like you left Berlin.

540
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,230
Burnt to the fucking ground.

541
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,360
I want them out of fucking business.

542
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,760
Who... who are they?

543
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,140
It's the Cadillac Linen Service in Delaware.

544
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,650
It's run by a bunch of Jews.

545
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,540
Let them collect their insurance,

546
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,240
which I'm sure they have plenty,

547
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,520
and leave this fucking other place alone,

548
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,040
the one I'm involved in.

549
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,560
- This ain't ten grand. - It's two grand.

550
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,840
When you put these Jew fucking washerwomen out of business,

551
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,480
then you get the rest of your money.

552
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,900
The reason I'm a little short on the money right now,

553
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,060
I don't wanna go to Skinny,

554
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,640
I don't wanna ask anybody when they're gonna charge me a vig,

555
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,490
and I'm gonna be paying them forever.

556
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

557
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,500
And nobody has to know.

558
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,670
Especially not Skinny

559
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,730
because I'm not getting the money from him.

560
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,290
And I see you look a little hesitant.

561
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,430
Believe me, I know what you can do.

562
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,170
If I stiff you on the money,

563
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,570
you're gonna do something terrible to me.

564
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,090
I do not want that.

565
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,670
I hit the number.

566
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,590
It's about 1,500.

567
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,340
I'll see you in a few hours.

568
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,180
Frank.

569
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,090
Angelo wants to see you.

570
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,190
- Now? - Yeah, now is good.

571
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,030
What's it about?

572
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,730
I don't know. Come on. I'll drive you.

573
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,400
Sit down, Frank.

574
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,360
What're you doing in Delaware?

575
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,840
Bombing out a laundry place.

576
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,150
I was just doing a job to make some extra money.

577
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,790
Putting this place out of action.

578
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,310
Putting this... putting this place out of commission.

579
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,250
For who?

580
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,430
Now is not the time to not say.

581
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,620
Whispers.

582
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,260
The other Whispers.

583
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,090
You know who owns the Cadillac Linen Service?

584
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,220
Some Jews in the laundry business.

585
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,030
- That's what they told me. - They own a part of it.

586
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,070
Somebody else got an interest in that.

587
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,440
- You know who? - No.

588
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,280
I do.

589
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,730
- Who? - No. I do.

590
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,320
I own the other part.

591
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,770
Not I know somebody who owns the other part.

592
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,830
Angelo, I didn't know you had any part of it.

593
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,620
I would never have done what I did

594
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,490
if I knew you were involved. I didn't know.

595
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,500
I would never, never do that against you.

596
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,690
Whispers didn't tell you it was Jew mob?

597
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,260
No, he said Jew washerwomen.

598
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,880
Jew washerwomen.

599
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,690
What else he say?

600
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,770
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

601
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,660
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

602
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,840
He did.

603
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,970
I didn't check.

604
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,090
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

605
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,580
- Can I give him his money back? - He won't need it.

606
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,900
You can keep it.

607
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,600
I... I don't want no trouble.

608
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,800
I'll just give it back to him and I'm okay.

609
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,770
He won't need it.

610
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,650
Okay. Thanks.

611
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,080
Thank Russell.

612
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,020
I wouldn't have wasted my time.

613
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,710
I'd have let the Jew mob have you.

614
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,340
You got a good friend here.

615
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,920
You don't know how good a friend you got.

616
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,060
- I... I know. - No, you don't know.

617
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,320
Wait by the bar, would you?

618
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,550
In a case like this,

619
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,950
the best thing to do is you use something brand new.

620
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,310
Right out of the box.

621
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,470
Otherwise, you don't know where it's been.

622
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,250
You don't know who's used it,

623
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,360
what crime it was connected to.

624
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,830
That's suicide.

625
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,980
So I recommend something new, straight out of the... the box.

626
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,320
Stone cold. Clean.

627
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,860
There you are.

628
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,920
I didn't know which way you were coming from.

629
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,220
I didn't know which way you were...

630
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,990
Naturally, the next thing you wanna do

631
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,600
is throw the thing away. You wanna get rid of it.

632
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,350
There's a spot in the Schuylkill River everybody uses.

633
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,180
If they ever send divers down there,

634
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,210
they'd be able to arm a small country.

635
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,330
For me, everything changed after Whispers.

636
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,330
It was like the army.

637
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,300
You followed orders.

638
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,620
You did the right thing.

639
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,890
You got rewarded.

640
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,790
And when I handled things for Russell,

641
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,250
it was never for money,

642
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,880
but as a show of respect.

643
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,950
When you ran a little errand, you did a little favor,

644
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,270
you got a little favor back if you ever needed it.

645
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,890
And you always hurried back.

646
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,660
- Phil, how you doing? - How are you?

647
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:51,500
See the Pyramids Along the Nile - Patti Page

648
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:51,480
* See the pyramids along the Nile *

649
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,820
How you doing, Frank?

650
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,540
* Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle *

651
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,460
* Just remember, darling, all the while *

652
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,400
Thank you, Vito.

653
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,750
* You belong to me... *

654
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,870
- Hi. Frank. - Hi.

655
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,220
What can I get for you?

656
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,340
I'm just gonna get the wine now.

657
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:15,960
Okay.

658
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,690
Just call me if you need anything.

659
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,040
I will.

660
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,950
- Help yourself, Frank. - Thanks.

661
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,680
Things change.

662
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,470
- She's the new one, right? - Yeah.

663
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,270
A nice kid. Nice kid.

664
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,850
Yeah.

665
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:47,990
* I'll be so alone without you *

666
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,210
No time is a good time to leave your wife,

667
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,890
but that's when I left mine.

668
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,630
Ira, what's going on?

669
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,400
- Good. All well? - Yes.

670
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,980
- Any problems? - No. Everything's good.

671
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,140
Thank you.

672
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,620
Right after this Caddy, pull over.

673
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,370
There it is. Fair Furriers.

674
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,110
He's expecting you.

675
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,160
Phil, you got a nice shop here.

676
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,830
Thanks.

677
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,090
People like to come to this store.

678
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,570
But your kid is a real sfigato.

679
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,390
You understand? He's a pain in the ass.

680
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,850
He's a wild kid. You gotta learn to control him.

681
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:03,970
And if you don't,

682
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,340
nobody's gonna want to shop here anymore.

683
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,510
If it's not good for you, it's not good for me.

684
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,790
You understand what I'm saying.

685
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,190
I want to apologize, Russell, for the aggravation.

686
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,600
This is from Russell and I. That's from you and Frank.

687
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,530
This one'll be from you and me.

688
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,220
Well, what about a baby spoon?

689
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,280
What's she gonna do with a baby spoon?

690
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,590
- They're not even married. - Have a baby.

691
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,960
They're not even married yet.

692
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,610
I give you my word, Russ.

693
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,050
- All right. Your word's good, Phil. - Thank you.

694
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,800
Okay, let's go, girls.

695
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,750
- Okay, we're done? - Yes, we're done.

696
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,350
What are you doing?

697
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,250
- When the hell are you gonna wise up, huh? - What?

698
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,980
There we go. That's my girl.

699
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,940
Oh, my God!

700
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,250
Yes!

701
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,310
Peggy.

702
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,540
Come over here.

703
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,420
I don't know. I don't...

704
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,010
I get the feeling she don't like me.

705
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,540
- Like she's afraid of me. - No, no.

706
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,860
That's the way she is.

707
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,570
She's afraid of me at times too.

708
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,040
So, uh, it's just she's a sensitive kid,

709
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
but that's all it is.

710
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,660
I can understand her being afraid of me,

711
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,280
but she shouldn't be scared of you, Frank.

712
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,250
No, well...

713
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,650
And then she hears about me in the papers sometimes...

714
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,040
- Really? - Yeah.

715
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,110
You gotta be close to your kids, Frank.

716
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,510
I am. I am.

717
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,670
You're blessed to have them.

718
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,850
I mean, Carrie and I can't have kids. I told you.

719
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,500
But you're blessed. You're blessed.

720
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,590
Call her. Call her. Tell her to come over.

721
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,460
Sweetheart. Peggy. Come here.

722
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,410
Come here.

723
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,410
- Come here. - Come over by Uncle Russ.

724
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,240
- How are you? - Good.

725
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,760
Do you know why God made the sky so high?

726
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,970
No.

727
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,510
So that the little birdies don't bunk their head on it

728
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,970
when they're flying around.

729
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,490
Isn't that cute?

730
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,970
A little joke.

731
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,290
Isn't that funny?

732
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,550
You want some candy or something?

733
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:19,550
No.

734
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,520
No, you guys don't want any candy.

735
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,200
There's nothing I could do for you?

736
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,320
No.

737
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,500
Well, if there is, you let Uncle Russell know.

738
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,790
Okay.

739
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,700
Go back. Have some fun.

740
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,610
You see what I mean?

741
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,490
You see that feeling I get?

742
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,590
She's just... She's shy, that's all.

743
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,350
She... She don't mean nothing.

744
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,920
Sometimes, when the parents get divorced,

745
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,030
the kids get all confused, and then they get resentful

746
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,820
and they don't know who to take it out on,

747
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,580
or, you know, which side, or...

748
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,620
No, you're right.

749
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,660
I'm lucky in that way because

750
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,850
Reenie and Mary, they get along like gangbusters,

751
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,350
so the kids go back and forth with no problem.

752
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,610
Keep your family close. Keep an eye on that.

753
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,400
Anyway, I'm just telling you, you know.

754
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,650
I mean, I'm... I'm just lucky.

755
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,480
Yeah.

756
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,840
How's it going with the union?

757
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,130
The union's the best in the world.

758
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,980
- You like it, huh? - Yeah, well, it's just...

759
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,100
I mean, I wish I had something more steady, but...

760
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,080
Yeah, it's...

761
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,750
- How about organizing? - Yeah.

762
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,570
- I would like to do that. But... - Yeah?

763
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,770
there's a long line.

764
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,740
- A long waiting list, if you will. - Yeah.

765
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,630
Well, a friend of ours is having a little trouble.

766
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,440
- Friend at the top. - Who's that?

767
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,140
The top.

768
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,650
Hoffa?

769
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,960
Yeah.

770
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,780
I heard the other day

771
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,440
that some guys tried to pipe him

772
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,640
- because of a workman's comp case. - Yeah.

773
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,080
Yeah, I heard he beat the shit out of them.

774
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,010
Yeah, but how long is he gonna keep doing that?

775
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,420
Things are gonna keep happening.

776
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,520
He needs somebody he can trust around him.

777
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,800
Somebody to be with him all the time.

778
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,560
Yeah.

779
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,200
Let me put McGee on the phone.

780
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:05,760
Hello.

781
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,760
Hiya, my friend. How are you?

782
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,740
Listen, I got that kid I was talking to you about here.

783
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,470
I'm gonna put him on the phone, let you talk to him, okay?

784
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,840
All right.

785
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,900
Hello.

786
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,230
- Is that Frank? - Yes.

787
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,280
Hiya, Frank. This is Jimmy Hoffa.

788
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,090
Yeah, yeah. Glad to meet you.

789
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,910
Well, glad to meet you, too, even if it's over the phone.

790
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,350
I heard you paint houses.

791
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,710
Yes. Yes, sir, I... I do. I do.

792
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,930
And I, uh...

793
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,770
I also do my own carpentry.

794
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,820
I'm glad to hear that.

795
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,520
I understand you're a brother of mine.

796
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,870
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.

797
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,660
Yeah! You know, uh,

798
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,540
our friend speaks very highly of you.

799
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,500
Well, thank you.

800
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,350
- He's not an easy man to please. - Well, I do my best.

801
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,060
Well, you know, there's a situation...

802
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:02,180
Nowadays, young people, they don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.

803
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,690
They don't have a clue.

804
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,160
I mean, maybe they know that he disappeared or something,

805
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,510
but that's about it.

806
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,300
But back then, there wasn't nobody in this country

807
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,270
who didn't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.

808
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,780
God bless, Jimmy.

809
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,800
Everything you've done, you're a real gentleman.

810
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,740
That's good.

811
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,040
In the '50s, he was as big as Elvis.

812
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,280
In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.

813
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,250
Next to the president,

814
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,230
he was like the most powerful man in the country. Bar none.

815
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,760
If you got it,

816
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,810
a truck brought it to you.

817
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,220
If you got your food, your clothing,

818
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,500
your medicine, if you got fuel for your homes,

819
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,350
fuel for your industries,

820
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,430
a truck brought it to them!

821
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,290
The day our trucks stop,

822
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,180
America stops!

823
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,320
Well, there's a situation going on now, Frank,

824
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,980
that needs to be attended to.

825
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,440
You know, they're trying to tear the union apart.

826
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,410
Big business and the government working together,

827
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:05,950
trying to pull us down.

828
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,650
Big business is on the attack!

829
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,790
They're coming! They're coming hard

830
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,250
and they're coming fast!

831
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,230
Big business and the government

832
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,190
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent among our ranks,

833
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,620
at a time when we need unity!

834
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,390
We need solidarity!

835
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,310
I want to write it in the sky.

836
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,480
Solidarity!

837
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,380
Solidarity!

838
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,130
Solidarity!

839
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,360
You wanna be a part of this fight?

840
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,750
Yes, I do, sir.

841
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,400
Would you like to be a part of this history?

842
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,670
Yes, I would.

843
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,790
Whatever you need me to do, I'm available.

844
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,760
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

845
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,020
Yes, I can, sir.

846
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,830
All right, then. See you then.

847
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,880
- He likes to talk, don't he? - Yeah.

848
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,300
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

849
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,760
You know, Frank, the only reason why you're here,

850
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,430
the Seafarers Union, they're signing up

851
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,310
the same non-union cab drivers

852
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,820
as we want to do.

853
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,770
Nobody knows who you are

854
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,300
and nobody knows what the fuck you're doing here. Okay?

855
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,230
- Yeah. - You and I know why you're here.

856
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,750
We gotta be able to sign these drivers up

857
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,220
so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em for his fucking union.

858
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,720
For some reason, lesbians.

859
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,720
Most of these drivers are fucking lesbians.

860
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,200
I have no reason why.

861
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,300
Paul Hall's running around

862
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,520
saying that he's gonna get a better contract

863
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,270
than our boy fucking Jimmy.

864
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,740
He's a cocksucker. Yeah.

865
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,700
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley in his pocket.

866
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,250
The cops are okay with whatever the fuck we do.

867
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,580
They're not gonna help us push these cars in,

868
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,800
but they certainly are not gonna let anybody fucking stop us.

869
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,500
Okay?

870
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,050
Come on! All of you guys. Come on!

871
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,930
Let's get this fucking thing in there. Watch yourself!

872
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,760
This is a lot of work.

873
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,540
Yeah, you ever think of using candy?

874
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,170
- What? - Candy.

875
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,040
What the fuck is candy?

876
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,110
Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.

877
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,180
I got it. I got it.

878
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,910
Here, you take the gas.

879
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,560
Frank, there's one thing about Jimmy.

880
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,410
Don't ever make him wait.

881
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,000
If you make a meeting with him, you get there on time.

882
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,410
Better yet, get there early.

883
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,920
I can't stress this enough.

884
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,280
His problem is that time is of essence.

885
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,870
And that's the important thing.

886
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,350
I gotta tell you one more thing. Jimmy doesn't drink.

887
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,770
Yeah. The head of the largest trucking union in the world,

888
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,670
he don't drink.

889
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,140
The worst part about it is,

890
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,560
he doesn't allow anybody to drink around him.

891
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,150
Another thing about him,

892
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,980
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

893
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,530
But we're gonna like watermelon.

894
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,930
Jimmy, you shoulda seen it,

895
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,200
sinking in the water.

896
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,790
One by one. I bet you, when they woke up the next morning,

897
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,550
those fucking cab drivers,

898
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,130
they went to look for their cabs,

899
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,980
they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

900
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,170
That's a great idea, Joey.

901
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,490
Great idea.

902
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,280
Well, it wasn't my idea.

903
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,530
My man Frank. It was his idea.

904
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,210
Let me tell you something.

905
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:06,180
Frank hit that pier, he took over the pier.

906
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,280
Whatever he told them to do, whatever he said,

907
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,690
they did it, you know.

908
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,110
I never seen a guy walk through a crowd like he does.

909
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,500
He doesn't touch a fucking person!

910
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,250
Everybody gets out of the way.

911
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,720
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

912
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,040
Guys he never met in his life. You know, it was like...

913
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,170
like Moses. Remember Moses?

914
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,220
When he walked into the ocean, the sea,

915
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,590
whatever the fuck it was, and it opened up!

916
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,690
That's him. I'm telling you. Jimmy, he's got it.

917
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,710
So, what do you think?

918
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,970
You need him a couple of days more?

919
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,590
Yeah, we gotta clear up a few dribs and drabs.

920
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,150
You guys sure like watermelon.

921
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:41,870
Want a bite?

922
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,290
Not on your life.

923
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,860
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

924
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,990
Those guys ain't union.

925
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,010
They're like Nazi collaborators, operating behind the lines.

926
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,720
- You know. You were in the war. - I sure do.

927
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:02,360
In a war, you go from point A to point B.

928
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,090
Sometimes,

929
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,260
you spill a little beer along the way.

930
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,120
That philosophy make sense to you?

931
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,030
Sure does.

932
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,980
Good.

933
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,310
Jimmy, he didn't make me stay in his suite

934
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,630
because he liked me.

935
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,560
He made me stay with him because he didn't want me

936
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,880
registering in my name at the hotel.

937
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,100
This way, there was no proof I was even in Chicago.

938
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,390
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

939
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,760
Nothing stops her.

940
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:00,510
After Chicago, Jimmy and I got close.

941
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,030
The wives hit it off.

942
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,040
And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids

943
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,050
mostly grown up and out of the house,

944
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,830
they got a kick out of our kids too.

945
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,980
Jimmy, Peggy, let's get a picture.

946
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,960
Oh. Yes. Come on.

947
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,470
Especially Peggy.

948
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,330
She and Jimmy, they fell for each other right away.

949
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,960
You know what I like even better than getting my picture took?

950
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,710
What?

951
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,610
Surprise!

952
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:25,910
Peggy!

953
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,150
To Peggy, Jimmy wasn't like Russ,

954
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,090
or Skinny or even me.

955
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,300
Sorry, everybody. This is just for Peggy and I.

956
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,570
For one thing, Jimmy didn't have a nickname

957
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,500
like "The Razor," Or "The Hunchback,"

958
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,100
or "The Weasel," Or "Whispers."

959
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,050
So what happened to "Thank you"?

960
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,160
Thank you!

961
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,370
And also, to her, he was helping people.

962
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,040
He was helping them make more money, live better lives.

963
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:52,180
He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.

964
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,190
"'If you have it, a truck brought it to you."

965
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,110
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

966
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,280
He's the president of the Teamsters Union

967
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,370
with over a million members.

968
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,420
They all support him because they have steady jobs,

969
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,000
great pay and a pension for when they retire.

970
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,210
The Teamster Pension Fund

971
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,380
had eight billion dollars in it.

972
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,260
And Jimmy had complete control over every bit of it.

973
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,110
Isn't this a beautiful presentation?

974
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,210
I mean, a bridge loan is really all I'm asking, Jimmy.

975
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:25,630
I'm not gonna piss away my members' pension dough

976
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,860
on something too risky.

977
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,760
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

978
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,160
I got Minsky's Follies.

979
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,520
I got the first topless act on the Strip.

980
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,000
I'm telling you, we're booming in there.

981
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,240
I can't get the drinks out...

982
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,810
Just asking for a golf course.

983
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,350
You know you never lost a dime with me.

984
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,260
Jimmy, we'd really just appreciate

985
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,060
whatever you could do to help Jake along here.

986
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,540
One-five is all I need for a completion bond.

987
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,930
Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.

988
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,070
Thank you. It's gonna be a big success.

989
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,120
Thank you, Jimmy. You're a prince.

990
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,320
- You're a mensch. - Yeah, I'm a mensch.

991
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,630
And, because of Mr. Hoffa,

992
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,950
workers have medical insurance for when they get sick,

993
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,540
and know when they retire, they're not going to go hungry.

994
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,230
There was so much paperwork back then

995
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,570
that Jimmy had to use an insurance company

996
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,880
that was run by this kid, Allen Dorfman, to work out the loans.

997
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,330
No, no, nothing for nothing.

998
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,850
Next time, try asking a little bit fucking nicer.

999
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,930
And? And? How'd it go?

1000
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,500
It was a little touch and go for a little bit.

1001
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,300
- But at the end, fine. - Good.

1002
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,440
It was Russ who got Jimmy

1003
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,500
to give guys like Gottlieb the loans,

1004
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,950
and, you know, he would get like 10% of that.

1005
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,690
Or whatever, you know. Maybe more.

1006
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:51,060
Listen, you tell Marteduzzo from me that I appreciate it.

1007
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,780
And everybody's gonna appreciate it.

1008
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,690
It's a good thing.

1009
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,690
Okay. I'll do that.

1010
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,710
Back then, you couldn't go to regular banks

1011
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,510
because the money was for gambling.

1012
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,200
God's truth, that's what it was. I'm serious. You couldn't.

1013
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,010
So the Mob, what did they do?

1014
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,940
They went to the Teamsters for the money.

1015
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,770
It was the Teamsters that stepped in

1016
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,060
and lent the money that built Las Vegas.

1017
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,570
- This is the mahogany... - Don't, Billy.

1018
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,920
- Don't touch the stuff. - I won't.

1019
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,200
- Just go where you gotta go. - Okay.

1020
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,280
There was more business than anybody could handle.

1021
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,360
So Jimmy had to shove some of the deals

1022
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,110
off on to his wife Jo,

1023
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,330
who had no idea she had 22%

1024
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,330
of a Florida land deal

1025
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,100
called "Sun Valley,"

1026
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,820
some charter fishing boats,

1027
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,950
and a ski lodge with its own mountain.

1028
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,810
One of Jimmy's clients was Sam "Momo" Giancana,

1029
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,460
who was friends with the Kennedys from back

1030
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:42,190
when Jack's father made his fortune with the Italians

1031
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:44,250
as a bootlegger during Prohibition.

1032
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,350
Momo, Sinatra hung out together with the Kennedys.

1033
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,050
Momo and Kennedy,

1034
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,910
believe it or not, even had the same girlfriend.

1035
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,950
Together. At the same time.

1036
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,500
Talk about crazy.

1037
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,630
So it was easy for the Mob to help Joe Kennedy

1038
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,310
get his son elected president. That was easy.

1039
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,730
They just punched up the vote a little

1040
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,090
to make sure that he won in Illinois.

1041
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,280
In exchange for that,

1042
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,780
the new president was supposedly gonna get Castro out of Cuba

1043
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,550
so our guys could get their casinos back,

1044
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,630
and race tracks, and shrimp boats,

1045
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,880
and everything else that they had,

1046
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,530
and owned down there from Havana back.

1047
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,540
But that... that didn't happen.

1048
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,810
The Italians wanted Kennedy the Irishman for president,

1049
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,600
and that's what they got.

1050
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,570
Get used to it, because we're gonna be seeing it 24/7.

1051
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,840
Son of a bitch!

1052
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,140
Goddamn Kennedys.

1053
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,580
I'm looking at the goddamn Kennedys.

1054
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,390
Jimmy, the kids. Language.

1055
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,430
What difference does it make?

1056
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,240
I mean, they gotta learn sooner or later.

1057
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,140
We're going to war with these people.

1058
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,320
War!

1059
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,460
If I said it once, I said it a thousand times,

1060
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:02,980
I don't care they're Irish.

1061
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,250
I don't care they're Catholic.

1062
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,590
If there's one person you can't trust in this life,

1063
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,150
it's millionaires' kids.

1064
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,300
You're right, Jimmy.

1065
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,660
Especially that little son of a bitch.

1066
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,520
Are you saying you don't remember

1067
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,650
doing any favors for Johnny Dio,

1068
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,580
or you don't remember the conversation?

1069
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:27,340
I'm saying, to the best of my recollection,

1070
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,870
I must recall on my memory,

1071
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,020
I cannot remember.

1072
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,850
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

1073
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,310
Individuals.

1074
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,380
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

1075
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,200
Off hand, that particular amount of money I borrowed,

1076
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,810
I don't know at this particular moment.

1077
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,860
But the record of my loans, which I requested, I have,

1078
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,120
and out of all the moneys I loaned

1079
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,510
during this period of time I went into these ventures.

1080
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,830
Those goddamn Kennedys,

1081
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,270
they get what they want!

1082
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,170
Jimmy. Jimmy, the kids.

1083
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,030
Him and all the bullshit problems

1084
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,890
- he put me through already. - Jimmy.

1085
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,010
I gotta go. You don't expect me to look at this.

1086
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,250
No, I don't.

1087
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,960
For guys like Russ,

1088
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,670
it couldn't have been better.

1089
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:27,990
I mean, Russ,

1090
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,050
oh, yeah, he did his part for getting Kennedy elected,

1091
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,100
that's for sure.

1092
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,530
What are you doing? I told you to put it...

1093
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,330
I told you to put them on every pole.

1094
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,430
You're still walking around.

1095
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,380
So what's the first thing

1096
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:40,290
that Jack Kennedy does to thank Chicago for all their help?

1097
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,590
He puts his shitass brother in there,

1098
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,920
that little prep school punk,

1099
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,290
and he winds up making him attorney general.

1100
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,300
And what's the first thing Bobby does?

1101
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,270
He goes after not just Jimmy,

1102
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,040
which in a way you could understand.

1103
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,630
I mean, Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much

1104
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,760
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

1105
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,440
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,

1106
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,800
Marcello, Trafficante, and all the other guys

1107
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:10,770
who put his brother in the White House in the first place.

1108
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,290
What's that about?

1109
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,470
Frank.

1110
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,270
- Thank you. - Merry Christmas.

1111
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,480
Am I missing something?

1112
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,550
Thank you, Carrie.

1113
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,690
- That's gorgeous. - Beautiful.

1114
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,820
Wear it in the best of health. We love you.

1115
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,330
Okay, now this one is for Peggy

1116
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:36,280
from Uncle Russell. Merry Christmas, my love.

1117
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,990
Oh, look at those.

1118
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,250
So nice!

1119
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,220
I heard you like to skate.

1120
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,670
What do you say?

1121
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:49,560
Thank you.

1122
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,310
Now me and Uncle Russell could take you ice skating.

1123
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,810
I think Santa Claus left you

1124
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,060
a little something extra in there too.

1125
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,860
What do you say to Uncle Russell?

1126
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,960
What do you say?

1127
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:09,820
Frank, it's all right.

1128
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,300
She said thank you once. That's enough.

1129
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,610
With Bobby as attorney general, I mean, they were all over us.

1130
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,260
I mean, we couldn't talk on the phone

1131
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,260
because we knew it was being bugged.

1132
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,250
You couldn't do nothing. You couldn't go nowhere.

1133
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,580
You couldn't do anything.

1134
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,570
It was a bad, bad, bad situation.

1135
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,040
And then Jimmy... Forget it.

1136
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,690
Bobby, now as attorney general, he has the power

1137
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,020
to send anybody to jail, and no question about it.

1138
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,490
And Jimmy was at the top of Bobby's hit list.

1139
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,110
He even set up a special "Get Hoffa Squad,"

1140
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,910
where he had his own guys from the FBI,

1141
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,830
the IRS working 'round the clock.

1142
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:48,030
Their only job was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.

1143
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,550
I'm serious. That's all they did.

1144
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,850
I am sitting in a room full of fuckin' idiots.

1145
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,510
You dumb motherfuckers!

1146
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,660
You know what you did?

1147
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,390
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid

1148
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,660
and you put him on

1149
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,280
as general organizer,

1150
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,930
pay him 36 fucking grand,

1151
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,850
at the same time,

1152
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,650
you let him sell insurance to his fucking father's...

1153
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,850
to his fucking father's...

1154
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,100
to his fucking father's locals!

1155
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,110
Damn it!

1156
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,220
How do you do that?

1157
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,170
How stupid can you be?

1158
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,120
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

1159
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,530
has got his nose up my ass everywhere I go!

1160
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,540
You don't know that they're hounding me?

1161
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,150
They're looking at everything I do.

1162
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:57,840
And you let this happen in public!

1163
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,880
You're giving it to him!

1164
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,300
I'm going to jail. You understand?

1165
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,130
I'm going to prison because of you,

1166
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,410
you dumb motherfuckers.

1167
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,680
This is what you wanted. You wanted to put me in jail.

1168
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,420
Tell me now so I can kill you right here.

1169
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,430
Right here!

1170
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,470
Where're you going?

1171
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,220
What do you mean, where am I going?

1172
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,100
I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

1173
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,000
What are you quitting for?

1174
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,350
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

1175
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,870
You can talk to them like that, you can't talk to me like that.

1176
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:29,810
Frank. No! That didn't apply to you. What are you...

1177
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,320
- Didn't apply? - No!

1178
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,080
Then you gotta let me know it didn't apply to me.

1179
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,660
I'm standing right there.

1180
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,290
I didn't even see you standing there!

1181
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,750
I was standing right there, Jimmy.

1182
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,740
What are you talking about?

1183
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,360
But it didn't apply to you! What else can I say?

1184
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,470
You got a problem, you pull me aside.

1185
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,790
You don't insult me and then you say it didn't apply to me.

1186
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:49,340
How am I gonna put you aside? I didn't even see you there.

1187
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,960
Oh, come on, Frank, you know me better than that.

1188
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,880
You just know me better than that.

1189
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,870
Please.

1190
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,490
Come on. It's gonna be all right.

1191
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,180
It's gonna be all right. Come on.

1192
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,420
Come on, why would I ever say anything like that to you?

1193
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,210
You gotta control these people.

1194
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:04,410
I'm controlling everything. Don't worry about it.

1195
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,310
But certainly, certainly, I... you know.

1196
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,120
Come on. Okay, guys, get out of here now.

1197
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,960
I mean, I don't know how Jimmy is running the fucking union.

1198
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,570
Between Bobby and the FBI up his ass all the time,

1199
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,070
he's going fucking crazy.

1200
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,320
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

1201
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,850
The old-timers know the Old Man. They'll talk to him.

1202
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,120
At some point, they'll straighten it out for him.

1203
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,300
Yeah, but he can't understand,

1204
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,780
and I gotta be honest with you, I don't understand either,

1205
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,920
how youse could help get those two fucking Kennedy pricks

1206
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,030
elected in the first place.

1207
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,980
It don't make no sense to him, that's for sure.

1208
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,220
He doesn't have to understand everything.

1209
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,620
You know what I'm talking about. Sometimes it's better.

1210
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,600
Well...

1211
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,910
It's when I see him like that, I don't, you know,

1212
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,810
I... I'm tryin' to... I feel bad.

1213
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,910
I wanna help him in some way.

1214
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,430
Listen, he's too emotional.

1215
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,150
Like some guy who's always rushing,

1216
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,160
rushing all over the place and they miss the big picture.

1217
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:56,390
Like Cuba.

1218
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,970
Getting us back into casinos.

1219
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,610
Getting us back into Havana.

1220
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:07,040
Like getting rid of that fucking Castro prick.

1221
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,630
The old-timers spoke to the Old Man.

1222
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:15,970
The Old Man talked to his son Jack, and he told him,

1223
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:18,870
"Don't forget who the fuck he owes."

1224
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,130
He knows who the fuck he owes.

1225
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,120
So I want you

1226
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,390
to go down to a place called Milestone Hauling.

1227
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,370
There's a guy named Phil.

1228
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,820
He's gonna give you a rig.

1229
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:45,620
You drive the rig down to Baltimore

1230
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,360
to a concrete plant.

1231
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,750
It's on Eastern Avenue.

1232
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,440
It's the only one on the street. You can't miss it.

1233
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:57,690
A guy's gonna meet you there.

1234
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,050
A fairy named Ferrie.

1235
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,420
Just pull it forward and then back it in.

1236
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,560
Let's go, let's go.

1237
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,710
You'll pick up some things.

1238
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,680
He'll give you some paperwork in case you get stopped.

1239
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,240
You drive the truck down to Florida.

1240
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,310
A dog track outside Jacksonville.

1241
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,160
You leave it there.

1242
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,180
A guy with big ears named Hunt will meet you there.

1243
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,410
He's gonna give you a car to drive back to Philly.

1244
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,010
What are you looking at?

1245
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,920
You looking at my ears?

1246
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,380
Sorry?

1247
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,900
My ears.

1248
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:21,510
- Are you looking at my ears? - Your ears?

1249
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,060
No.

1250
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,120
I had an operation, so there's no need for anyone

1251
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,910
looking at my ears anymore.

1252
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,630
Yeah, well, I ain't looking at your ears.

1253
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:31,900
Right.

1254
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,010
Get out of here. Go on.

1255
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,410
...unfolded in the Bay of Pigs.

1256
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:00,970
Nothing went as planned.

1257
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,210
Paratroopers were unable

1258
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,800
to blow up roadways leading to the beach area.

1259
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,600
Castro raced toward the scene.

1260
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,530
The underground might

1261
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:09,390
have blown up the roads but it knew nothing.

1262
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,090
Soon, Castro had artillery firing on the beachhead.

1263
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,880
His planes destroyed invading ships

1264
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,390
carrying a brigade of men and vital ammunition.

1265
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:18,230
The beachhead could not be enlarged

1266
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,640
and paratroopers were soon trying to fight their way back

1267
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,140
to the small section of the shore

1268
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,810
where the invaders were pinned down.

1269
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,850
1,500 men had been dumped on a shore without air cover

1270
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,640
or protective fire from ships.

1271
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:31,240
Castro had to wait only until they ran out of ammunition

1272
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,810
before mopping them up.

1273
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,120
Later, Castro was to strut around the invasion area with newsmen,

1274
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,500
and expound on the errors that had been made.

1275
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,190
He had ample material.

1276
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:43,050
The United States, already humiliated,

1277
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,060
stood condemned by most of the countries of the world.

1278
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,130
Shit!

1279
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,060
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

1280
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,150
Boobie starts coming after me and the union.

1281
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,940
He's looking for some cheap publicity.

1282
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,710
That's all it is. That's what he's doing.

1283
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,320
Okay. Well, it's all gonna blow over, Jimmy.

1284
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,910
No, it's not gonna blow over. How's it gonna blow over?

1285
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,930
They're never gonna forget

1286
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,280
- that I gave money to Nixon! - Calm down. Jimmy, please.

1287
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,480
We're gonna handle this.

1288
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,380
Couple of the old-timers,

1289
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,660
they're gonna get to Old Man Kennedy now.

1290
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,450
Okay? They're gonna get to him. He's a little sick, but...

1291
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,590
- Sick? - Yeah. But...

1292
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,270
He had a fucking stroke. That's not sick.

1293
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,900
That's you're... you're close to the grave, is what.

1294
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,690
He's turning into a fucking eggplant.

1295
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,900
Okay. Well, you can't blame anybody for that. That's...

1296
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,380
I'm not looking to blame anybody.

1297
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,940
But if there's any blame going around, it's the Kennedys.

1298
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,830
His kids killed him. Let me tell you that.

1299
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:32,470
He's not dead, but he's going. He's going.

1300
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,350
They killed him. They'd give anybody a heart attack.

1301
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,730
Where are you going?

1302
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,500
I'm going to work.

1303
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,880
Go back to sleep.

1304
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:08,210
All I can say is that, we will not stop.

1305
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:11,460
Because we've been doing that for 50 years!

1306
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,660
What good does it do?

1307
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:16,890
Let the lawyers... Let the lawyers drive a truck.

1308
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:20,530
They need their pencils and papers and their ink pads.

1309
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,920
That's... That's a whole other story.

1310
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,110
But we're gonna get through this.

1311
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,360
We're gonna get through this legal bullshit

1312
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,560
and garbage they're throwing at us.

1313
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,520
We're gonna get through it because

1314
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,810
"Boobie" Kennedy wants something, that doesn't mean

1315
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,720
the rich boy is gonna get it.

1316
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,150
You understand what I'm saying?

1317
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:43,270
I don't care what he wants. He's not gonna get it!

1318
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,800
He's not gonna get it because

1319
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,760
we are the biggest and best,

1320
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:55,240
and most honest union

1321
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,500
in this country!

1322
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,380
Yeah, that's right.

1323
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:59,550
I waited for that!

1324
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,710
And you know the operative word I'm talking about here.

1325
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,990
- Solidarity. - Yeah!

1326
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:12,260
And it works. It works for all of us.

1327
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:16,830
And it works for our friend here, Frank Fitzsimmons!

1328
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,130
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

1329
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,080
my executive vice president.

1330
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,430
If there's anyone that can do this job, it's this man here.

1331
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,910
And with him at my back,

1332
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,470
where are we gonna go but up!

1333
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,690
Is that right, Fitz?

1334
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,970
All the way, Jimmy!

1335
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:49,970
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1336
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:52,200
A union man!

1337
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:56,100
You know, I felt they liked Fitz.

1338
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,160
No two ways about it.

1339
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,670
Yeah, you gave Fitz some buildup.

1340
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,300
I mean, I hope he deserves it.

1341
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,790
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

1342
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:08,660
I don't know. I don't want to knock the guy,

1343
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:09,820
but I... I don't know.

1344
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,300
Well, you're not knocking him. Just tell me...

1345
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,750
Tell me what you feel.

1346
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,690
I mean, he's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

1347
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,400
He's a nice guy,

1348
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,010
but he ain't that sharp. He ain't that smart.

1349
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,270
And he's also like a...

1350
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,520
He plays a lot of fucking golf, you know.

1351
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:25,590
He plays golf?

1352
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,760
So what? That's what you want from a number two.

1353
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,870
You don't want somebody too smart.

1354
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,670
You want a nice guy. People like him, you know.

1355
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,480
Not dumb, but somebody,

1356
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,030
you know you can have walking behind you

1357
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:39,060
without getting knifed.

1358
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,330
- Well, I hope you're right. - I'm always right.

1359
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:44,760
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

1360
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,420
It's the Little Guy I have to worry about.

1361
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,990
You know what I'm saying.

1362
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,430
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1363
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:52,310
The Little Guy.

1364
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,130
- That's my worry. - Yeah.

1365
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,720
That son of a bitch.

1366
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,540
What's the matter?

1367
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,640
Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

1368
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,640
I'm right. Yeah.

1369
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,110
- You're not perplexed, are you? - Not at all. Not at all.

1370
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:09,650
I mean, I told you how I felt about Fitz. Pro. You know.

1371
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,570
Yeah. Good, because sometimes I feel

1372
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:14,770
I'm the only one who sees right through that cocksucker.

1373
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:17,930
* So let's raise a glass... *

1374
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,640
- He's a bad guy. - He's a bad guy.

1375
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:21,600
* To the greatest guy *

1376
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:28,020
* 560 is lucky enough to ever have *

1377
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,100
* You're our boy *

1378
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,140
* Tony Pro *

1379
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:39,020
* We're all yours *

1380
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,350
The Little Guy was Tony Provenzano.

1381
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,810
They called him Tony Pro.

1382
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,820
He was a capo in a big Jersey crew

1383
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:49,350
and the president of the Local 560

1384
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:51,220
in Union City, New Jersey.

1385
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,970
* He's the greatest guy *

1386
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:12,180
* 560 is lucky enough to ever have *

1387
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,820
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1388
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,600
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1389
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:21,150
Pro and Jimmy, they came up together

1390
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,850
and they were close... for a while.

1391
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:26,640
You turl, you work,

1392
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:29,530
while the corporation kings

1393
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,350
and princes of industry,

1394
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,690
with their vast expense accounts

1395
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,360
and salary and luxurous yachts,

1396
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,860
have dedicated themselves to our destruction.

1397
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:40,770
Down on them!

1398
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:45,850
I didn't need nobody to tell me about Tony Pro.

1399
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:49,020
Oh, no. What did I need to know? I knew enough.

1400
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,400
This is a man who had Sally Bugs strangle

1401
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,240
Tony "Three Fingers" Castellito

1402
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,850
just because Three Fingers was coming up big in the union.

1403
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:06,350
And it was his own guy. It was his own guy.

1404
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,780
Tony Pro was so fucking worried

1405
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,320
that this guy was gonna beat him out

1406
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,020
that after he had Sally Bugs strangle the guy,

1407
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:32,720
he had Sally stick him in a fucking tree shredder.

1408
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:34,780
That way there'd be no competition,

1409
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,990
not even from the grave.

1410
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,180
He's out of control.

1411
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,810
What are you gonna do with a person like this?

1412
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,470
He's got a hand in everybody's pocket.

1413
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,320
Shaking down the trucking companies.

1414
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,470
Can you imagine that?

1415
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:46,600
Threatening people.

1416
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,570
I mean, you know, threatening people once in a while,

1417
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,070
okay, I understand.

1418
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,060
But all the time?

1419
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:55,720
It's drawing attention to us, you understand?

1420
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,100
Guys like that give the unions a bad name.

1421
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,720
Something's got to be done.

1422
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,720
I mean it. Something's gotta be done.

1423
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,970
Tony being Tony, uh...

1424
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,930
that ain't... that ain't easy. We can't...

1425
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,350
I don't mean that. I don't...

1426
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:13,930
Not... Not that.

1427
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,930
Yeah, I'm just...

1428
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,530
I'm just saying get working guys

1429
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:20,150
who know the unions, card-carrying Teamsters,

1430
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,060
like you and me.

1431
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,100
Start running,

1432
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,020
take over some of the locals.

1433
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,470
What do you think?

1434
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:29,070
- He ain't gonna like that. - Who?

1435
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:31,020
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he?

1436
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:32,140
He's a gangster.

1437
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,350
I run the union, I'm the president.

1438
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,680
So, I mean...

1439
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,720
All I need is some guys who know their ways around.

1440
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,180
Know how to handle themselves, you know.

1441
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:42,970
That's all.

1442
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,890
That's why I want you to run for president

1443
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,310
of Local 326.

1444
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:53,020
You're like family to me, Frank. You know.

1445
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:54,970
You, Irene,

1446
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:56,470
the girls.

1447
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,890
The lovely Peggy.

1448
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,560
But that's not why I'm doing this.

1449
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:03,680
I'm not giving you anything you didn't earn,

1450
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,350
you didn't deserve.

1451
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,770
What do you think?

1452
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,810
I...I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

1453
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,100
- I mean, um... - Well, just say you'll do it.

1454
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,310
That's all you got to say.

1455
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,060
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

1456
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:22,890
Ha! When you run for president

1457
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,560
of 326, you're gonna win.

1458
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,100
I guarantee it.

1459
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,100
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

1460
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,810
You mean it, huh?

1461
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,970
Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

1462
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,240
I love you. I just love you, you know. Come here.

1463
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,680
I love you, man.

1464
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,060
I can't tell ya.

1465
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,280
Oh, gee.

1466
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,140
This is so good, you know.

1467
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,060
I feel like I can breathe again.

1468
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,470
It's so funny. I...

1469
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:50,890
Somehow I...

1470
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,890
I don't know. I thought you would've said no.

1471
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,930
I'm glad you said yes.

1472
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,470
I mean...

1473
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,310
Frank...

1474
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:06,270
You never reveal how you feel, you know. It's hard to tell.

1475
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,600
I'm honored, Jimmy. I don't know...

1476
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,740
It's just I don't know what to... say,

1477
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,350
you know, but I'm honored.

1478
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:14,560
Well, that's good.

1479
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:17,890
That makes me feel good.

1480
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,560
I can breathe.

1481
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,100
That's so great.

1482
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:25,850
I...

1483
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:57,350
What can I say? I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.

1484
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,940
He took me out of a meat truck, he gave me my start.

1485
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:04,520
He gave me my first charter. He gave me my first union.

1486
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,180
- How are ya? - Hey, how are you?

1487
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,190
Frank Sheeran, the new president of Union 326.

1488
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,600
- I wanted to introduce myself. - Nice to meet ya.

1489
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,490
- What's your name? - My name's Al.

1490
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:15,770
Al. Nice to meet ya, Al.

1491
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:18,770
- A little something... - No, no. Don't need it.

1492
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,850
- Sure? - Yeah.

1493
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,740
Just came here to say hello, introduce myself.

1494
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:23,940
You need anything, just get in touch with me. Okay?

1495
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,990
- You sure? - Yeah.

1496
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:25,640
Thank you.

1497
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,860
So, hypothetically, if they can prove

1498
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,860
that you stole from them,

1499
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,850
what they're gonna want are names, so...

1500
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:36,810
Would you be willing to give up names to keep from going to jail?

1501
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:38,310
No.

1502
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,940
Okay. So you got nothing to worry about.

1503
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:44,180
- The lawyers will take care of it. - Thank you, Mr. Sheeran.

1504
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:57,850
The Interstate 80 West through the rest of Pennsylvania,

1505
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:01,970
and then we'd go across Ohio all the way to Toledo,

1506
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,270
and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.

1507
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:09,310
And we'd still get there on time.

1508
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,570
Your Honor, my client had been advised by counsel

1509
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,780
that it was perfectly legal for his wife

1510
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,970
to be part owner of a trucking business.

1511
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:22,240
Still, when the McClellan Committee challenged its legality,

1512
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,060
she withdrew from the company immediately.

1513
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,430
That should be the end of the matter.

1514
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,650
There had been not one indictment served

1515
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,930
against my client in 13 grand jury investigations.

1516
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,430
Your Honor, this is an example of

1517
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,930
a personal vendetta against my client,

1518
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:42,650
against his family, by a frustrated Justice Department

1519
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:45,060
and the attorney general, Robert Kennedy.

1520
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:52,640
He's got a gun!

1521
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,470
Get that gun out of his hand!

1522
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,020
Easy, boy.

1523
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,780
That was not a real gun, was it?

1524
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:12,810
How'd that gun get in?

1525
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,360
How'd it get in here?

1526
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,720
It wasn't my fault!

1527
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,970
I don't know!

1528
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,680
My Chuckie!

1529
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:20,390
Hey, it's my son!

1530
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,020
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

1531
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:24,890
You see him? You see what he did?

1532
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:28,690
I'll tell you this.

1533
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,470
He shot at me, and it was like a pellet or something.

1534
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,900
I didn't feel it, I just felt a little impact,

1535
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,970
like I was shot not even with a BB gun.

1536
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,850
Something even lighter.

1537
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,180
But I charged him.

1538
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,360
I charged him and so did Chuckie, if you noticed.

1539
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,220
I taught him well.

1540
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:46,020
You charge a guy, always charge a guy with a gun.

1541
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:47,810
With a knife, you run away.

1542
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,680
Run away from a knife. So you charge with a gun,

1543
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,020
- with a knife, you run. - That's right.

1544
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,770
Hey! I rhymed!

1545
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,070
I know it sounds crazy, but I got a message from a higher power

1546
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:00,610
telling me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

1547
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:01,310
Come with me.

1548
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,310
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

1549
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,320
Come on down, Frank.

1550
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,360
Yeah, I got one of them with me now, you see.

1551
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,530
Get down here, Frank.

1552
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,650
Eddie Partin, you know the guy from Baton Rouge,

1553
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:11,690
he's here with me.

1554
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,030
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get right down.

1555
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:15,020
Out of my way, boys. Come on.

1556
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:17,020
Come on, come on.

1557
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:24,110
Did Mr. Brennan first say,

1558
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,780
or do you remember him first saying

1559
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:28,470
something about, say, "I had to change the deal.

1560
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:30,900
I have to cut Hoffa in on the new deal"?

1561
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,310
Wasn't that like the chronology of the whole thing?

1562
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,280
I don't know he changed the deal,

1563
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,820
but it was my understanding over the telephone that Brennan

1564
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,070
was speaking for himself.

1565
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:43,350
She's an angry woman. That's an angry woman.

1566
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:44,180
Oh. Yeah.

1567
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,440
- She was a teacher I think. - Oh, that's right.

1568
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:47,810
What we're looking at is this one.

1569
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:49,400
This one is not approachable.

1570
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,930
No, she'd be a tough nut to crack.

1571
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:52,690
There's a lot of family money there.

1572
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,400
...will hail, stop, and search

1573
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,020
all ships bound for Cuba.

1574
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,240
If the ships' captains do not stop,

1575
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,930
force will be used to stop them.

1576
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:01,440
If the ships do stop...

1577
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:03,690
See, I think there's an in here...

1578
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:04,440
Did you make this statement

1579
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:06,600
to the grand jury? I'll read it for you.

1580
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,190
"Brennan came to me and said words

1581
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,900
to the effect he's gonna go ahead..."

1582
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,190
He's got a restaurant.

1583
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,440
Did you look into violations?

1584
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:14,320
Yeah. I'd rather stick with the women.

1585
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,530
- They're more approachable. - Jimmy, thank you.

1586
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:19,440
...in Cuba of operational medium-range missiles.

1587
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,940
He added that if one of the missiles is launched,

1588
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,470
it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.

1589
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:27,610
It could hit any spot in the southeast United States,

1590
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:28,810
south of Washington.

1591
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:31,530
And that we would have no way of intercepting it

1592
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,430
or issuing a warning about it.

1593
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,100
This one's married to a state trooper named Plechette.

1594
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:37,680
That's good.

1595
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:39,720
We know anyone?

1596
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,970
Well, yeah, we got an ex-cop in the Local.

1597
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,180
That's good.

1598
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,390
All our forces have been put on increased alert.

1599
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,610
...came to me and said words to the effect

1600
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:13,570
he's gonna go ahead and set up a company to lease trucks.

1601
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,440
But later, he called me on the phone and said quote,

1602
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:18,070
"I gotta change the deal

1603
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:20,560
'cause I gotta cut Hoffa in on the deal."

1604
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,100
Is that accurate, sir?

1605
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,100
This one's another possibility.

1606
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,030
- Wait. - Well, she had a boyfriend,

1607
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,180
she's seeing somebody else while she's married.

1608
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,820
So it could be... It could grab her,

1609
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:31,780
- hold on to her. - Yeah, but...

1610
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:32,720
But this guy,

1611
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:36,060
the construction business. He has a couple of violations,

1612
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:38,640
there's a lien on his house.

1613
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,100
His car is unpaid.

1614
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:43,970
That's good. Keep going. Don't quit while you're ahead.

1615
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:53,310
Thank you. See you, Big Eddie.

1616
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,440
Do you swear to tell the truth,

1617
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,030
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

1618
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:57,930
- so help you God? - I do.

1619
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:08,570
Mr. King, you're a member of

1620
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,940
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is that correct, sir?

1621
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:15,350
I respectfully decline to answer that under the

1622
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:19,440
protection afforded me by the Fifth Amendment.

1623
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:21,190
I just asked if you're a Teamster, sir.

1624
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,570
I respectfully decline to answer...

1625
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,810
Okay. All right. Fine.

1626
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,770
I'm gonna show you a photograph, all right?

1627
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:29,240
- I respectfully decline to answer... - Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait...

1628
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,560
...under the protection...

1629
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:32,740
You haven't even seen the photograph yet.

1630
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,770
Look at the photograph, wait a smidge,

1631
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,310
- and then you can... - I want to avail myself

1632
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:41,890
of my right under the constitution, as I understand it.

1633
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:46,140
- Jim, let him avail himself. - Oh, okay.

1634
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:53,350
Oh, yeah.

1635
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,520
That King's the best.

1636
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,810
He's the best. He's a good guy.

1637
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,280
You see him stand up to that jerk?

1638
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,810
Yeah, yeah, I know. He was great.

1639
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,220
I love what he did.

1640
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,060
They tried to get him, they tried their best.

1641
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:07,680
- We need more like him. - Oh, my God!

1642
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,140
More details just arrived.

1643
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:15,560
These details are not the same as previously.

1644
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:17,190
President Kennedy, shot today,

1645
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,850
just as his motorcade left downtown Dallas.

1646
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,190
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up

1647
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,240
and grabbed Mr. Kennedy. She called, "Oh, no!"

1648
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,060
The motorcade sped on.

1649
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:30,030
United Press says that the wounds of President Kennedy

1650
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:32,430
perhaps could be fatal.

1651
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:35,970
Repeating a bulletin from CBS News.

1652
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:37,970
President Kennedy has been shot

1653
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,270
by a would-be assassin in Dallas, Texas.

1654
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,670
Stay tuned to CBS News for

1655
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:44,310
further details.

1656
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:45,810
What?

1657
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:51,030
It takes more than an instant

1658
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:53,020
to make a real cup of coffee.

1659
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,890
That's why Nescafé has come up with a new kind of coffee.

1660
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:01,520
It's more than an instant. It's new Minute Brew Nescafé.

1661
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:02,940
Anybody can make a...

1662
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:05,060
The flash, apparently official,

1663
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:10,860
President Kennedy died at 1:00 p.m. Central standard time,

1664
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,560
two o'clock, eastern standard time,

1665
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,810
some 38 minutes ago.

1666
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,650
Vice President Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas,

1667
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:28,970
but we do not know, uh, to where he has proceeded.

1668
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:33,180
Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly

1669
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,640
and become the 36th President of the United States.

1670
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,650
Mr. Hoffa, will you be attending

1671
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:46,770
the President's funeral?

1672
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,400
I wasn't invited.

1673
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,020
You don't have to be invited. A million Americans will be there.

1674
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,020
Well...

1675
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,400
I guess I'll have to check my schedule.

1676
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,930
If you were to go and asked to speak, what would you say?

1677
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,470
I'd say, uh,

1678
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:01,220
Bobby Kennedy is just another lawyer now.

1679
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,180
Son of a bitch.

1680
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,100
Good, Eric. Thank you very much.

1681
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:36,470
Jimmy was right.

1682
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:39,140
Almost.

1683
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,600
That was the end of it with Bobby.

1684
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:46,600
So much for him being the attorney general. That was done.

1685
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,060
Bobby's vendetta was over, with us.

1686
01:30:59,030 --> 01:30:59,890
Mr. Hoffa,

1687
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:03,110
you stand here convicted of having tampered

1688
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,060
with the very soul of this nation.

1689
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,600
But there was still that jury thing in Nashville.

1690
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,930
The soul of this nation, sir,

1691
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:14,060
lies in its sacred processes of justice.

1692
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,100
Justice must be done.

1693
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:19,720
And for your wicked attempts to corrupt these processes,

1694
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,970
justice will be done on you.

1695
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:25,970
We got him now.

1696
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:27,240
We got him.

1697
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,430
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it!

1698
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:50,390
But Jimmy, you know, he had it all set up.

1699
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,940
Although you knew it was supposed to look like Fitz

1700
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,430
was the one in charge.

1701
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,470
He gave Fitz his orders through

1702
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:59,190
Bill Bufalino and Allen Dorfman,

1703
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,770
and they ran Jimmy's loans.

1704
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:02,810
But things are good in here? Everything is...

1705
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,990
Everything's terrible.

1706
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,900
You don't sleep at night 'cause you're afraid

1707
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,990
someone's gonna knife you.

1708
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,400
'Cause you look okay. You look okay.

1709
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,520
Where's Fitz? He's late.

1710
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,900
Yeah. Well, we were gonna meet him in the front. He...

1711
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:15,890
Meet him in the front?

1712
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,990
Here he is, here he is.

1713
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,570
Where the hell have you been? What are you doing here?

1714
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:21,350
Why did you even come at all, Fitz?

1715
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,110
You know, are you aware you're late?

1716
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,690
That's all I want to know. Do you know you're late?

1717
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,450
I'm sorry I'm late, Jimmy,

1718
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,070
but we got a lot going on.

1719
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,030
We got a lot going on.

1720
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:30,740
I don't wanna hear that. I wanna hear something concrete,

1721
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,850
I wanna hear something straight on.

1722
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,560
I'm just gonna ask you to be a little more patient.

1723
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:36,360
I think we're gonna have...

1724
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,770
I'm inside here. I'm not gonna be too patient.

1725
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:42,180
As much as Jimmy was getting pissed off at Fitz,

1726
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,900
everybody else liked him because

1727
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,280
they could get anything out of him that they wanted.

1728
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,140
They couldn't do that with Jimmy.

1729
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:52,390
That's what happens when you go away to college.

1730
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,430
How's that?

1731
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,600
Jimmy's pissed off with Fitz.

1732
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,350
Fitz is okay. We like Fitz.

1733
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,970
I'll tell you what the problem is.

1734
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,120
Jimmy's got that ballbusting Dorfman

1735
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,430
holding up loans that Fitz already okayed.

1736
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:11,030
I hate that Dorfman.

1737
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:13,390
He's such a pain-in-the-ass fucking Jew.

1738
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,060
What do you want me to do?

1739
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,220
No, not that. Not that.

1740
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,020
What you gotta do is, you know,

1741
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:26,470
put a firecracker up Dorfman's ass.

1742
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,930
Fitz'll get the message.

1743
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:30,890
He'll get the message.

1744
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,520
I mean, you can't do it to Fitz because if...

1745
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,110
if you do it to that lush,

1746
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,270
he'll run right to the feds and screw up everything.

1747
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,270
But Dorfman...

1748
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:41,470
You gotta do it to Dorfman.

1749
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:56,100
Cry - Johnnie Ray & The Four Lads

1750
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:51,520
* If your heartaches *

1751
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:56,100
* Seem to hang around *

1752
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:20,220
* If your heartaches Seem to hang around *

1753
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,350
Fitz... Fitz got the message.

1754
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:27,570
After that, anybody who wanted anything

1755
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:30,020
from the pension fund, they got it.

1756
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:36,870
The thing keeps comin' around. Keeps comin' around.

1757
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:38,020
What's goin' on?

1758
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,020
- Fuck is this? - Who's this guy?

1759
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:41,390
Who let you in?

1760
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,330
Mr. Provenzano.

1761
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:46,610
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.

1762
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:48,390
I have a warrant for your arrest. Please stand.

1763
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:49,420
Can I finish my hand?

1764
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,640
No, sir. Please stand.

1765
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,520
I had a bad fucking hand anyway.

1766
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,770
Middle of the game.

1767
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:55,810
Join the club. Deal him in.

1768
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,190
Other arm, please.

1769
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,890
- Can I get my bags? - No, sir.

1770
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:01,780
I got nothing in my pocket. I got fucking shorts on here.

1771
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,140
Look at this penguin over there, huh?

1772
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,430
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

1773
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:06,970
Yeah, I'll get your bags.

1774
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,520
This is like watchin' TV.

1775
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:13,140
They got Pro for extortion and gave him seven years.

1776
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,060
And they sent him to Lewisburg prison.

1777
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:18,060
So who does he end up with?

1778
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:19,390
Jimmy.

1779
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:29,850
Look at that.

1780
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,890
A work of art.

1781
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:33,680
Thank you, Pete.

1782
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,470
I gotta talk to you about a problem I got with my pension.

1783
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,810
I know.

1784
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:50,970
You know?

1785
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,140
What do you know?

1786
01:35:54,610 --> 01:35:55,270
I know

1787
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:57,390
you got a million two

1788
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:00,390
and, uh, there's a problem with it.

1789
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:04,020
So you'll look into it for me?

1790
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,020
How am I going to look into it? What am I gonna look into?

1791
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:09,310
It is what it is.

1792
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:10,810
Well, what is it?

1793
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:12,520
You lost it.

1794
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,640
You forfeited it when you came in here. That's it.

1795
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:19,850
So is yours forfeited too?

1796
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:20,930
No.

1797
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,850
Ok, let me get this straight. So yours is still there,

1798
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,560
your million five, whatever it is,

1799
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:30,640
but mine's gone?

1800
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,810
Yeah. Mine's still there.

1801
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,470
But we're both sitting here.

1802
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,680
We're both sitting here. That's right.

1803
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:42,970
Only we're sitting here for different things.

1804
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,100
You're sitting here for extortion.

1805
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:48,930
I'm sitting here for fraud.

1806
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,350
- So? - So? So there's a difference.

1807
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:53,810
What's the difference?

1808
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:59,820
I didn't threaten anybody, you did.

1809
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,570
So what? That makes no sense.

1810
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:02,780
What do you mean? It does.

1811
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:04,650
No, it doesn't. I don't want a debate.

1812
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,970
- Think about it. - I'm thinking about it, Jimmy.

1813
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:08,640
No, don't fuck with me, Jimmy.

1814
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:09,970
Just do something about it.

1815
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:16,680
What do you mean, "do something about it"?

1816
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:17,820
What am I gonna do?

1817
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,360
Come on, there's always something you can do.

1818
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,810
No. It's federal law.

1819
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:22,570
- I don't care. - You don't care?

1820
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:24,430
No, you can still do something about it.

1821
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:26,990
There's nothing I can do. What can I do?

1822
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:28,360
You can get my fucking money.

1823
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,020
How?

1824
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,440
- Some other way. - What way?

1825
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:31,990
The same way you got your money.

1826
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:34,100
Lower your fucking voice.

1827
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:36,740
You telling me to lower my voice?

1828
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:37,940
I'm tellin' you to lower your fucking voice.

1829
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:38,900
Cocksucker.

1830
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,490
- Don't call me a cocksucker. - Fuck you.

1831
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:42,140
Don't you fucking dare.

1832
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:45,020
Look, you're here for fraud.

1833
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,030
- You stole money. - I stole money?

1834
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,690
Yeah, I stole money.

1835
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,600
Okay, fine, in a different way, but still,

1836
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,770
I want what I'm fucking owed.

1837
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,570
You people. You people.

1838
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:56,940
- What did you say? - Oh, my God!

1839
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:57,610
What did you say?

1840
01:37:57,610 --> 01:37:59,060
Oh, come on, what I said.

1841
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,190
What the fuck did I say?

1842
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,820
"You people." You said "You people."

1843
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:03,650
What does that fucking mean, "You people"?

1844
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:04,470
I'm done

1845
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,970
talking about this.

1846
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,140
- "You people"? - I'm done!

1847
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,640
You're done? I'll rip your fucking head off!

1848
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,180
Fucking piece of shit!

1849
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,520
I'll fucking kill you!

1850
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:21,270
I'll fucking kill you. Motherfucker!

1851
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:22,390
What the fuck...

1852
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,640
Right then, you knew it was all gonna fall apart.

1853
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,490
I can't believe that crazy bastard

1854
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:03,360
thought he could do that

1855
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,110
right there at Columbus Circle, in front of 5,000 people

1856
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:08,350
and get away with it.

1857
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:11,360
I can't believe it. That is not right, Frankie.

1858
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,520
That is not right.

1859
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:15,310
That is a total piece of shit.

1860
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:17,020
That's a piece of shit.

1861
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,820
There's only one guy who would have the balls,

1862
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:22,930
the nerve, the audacity to do that.

1863
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:34,850
He was known Downtown as "Joey the Blond,"

1864
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:38,100
but everybody, especially the newspapers,

1865
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,220
called him "Crazy Joe."

1866
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:42,070
...shall be the truth,

1867
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:45,030
the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1868
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,600
- I do. - Be seated.

1869
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:51,680
Mr. Gallo, do you have an opening statement?

1870
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:54,220
Yeah.

1871
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:59,680
This carpet would be great for a crap game.

1872
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:04,950
Russ was right.

1873
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:08,600
I mean, who the hell else runs around with show business people like that,

1874
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,060
getting his picture taken in the papers all the time,

1875
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:14,170
drawing attention to himself and everybody. What is that?

1876
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,430
Who does he think he is, Errol Flynn?

1877
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,470
He went against everything and everybody.

1878
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:20,550
Just didn't give a shit.

1879
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,730
And, growing up, he kidnapped his own bosses.

1880
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:25,450
I don't know how he got away with that.

1881
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:28,170
You don't get away with that. You do that, you die.

1882
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:29,650
That simple.

1883
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,290
When he went away to the can,

1884
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:34,110
he recruited black guys instead of his own kind.

1885
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:36,230
And when he got out, nobody knew what he was doing,

1886
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:37,480
or who he was doing with it.

1887
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,850
We didn't know what the hell was going on. Nobody did.

1888
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,190
And if you don't like what he's doing,

1889
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,450
and you say something,

1890
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,280
then you see what happens.

1891
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:16,460
Who does something like that? Who does things like that?

1892
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:18,180
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

1893
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:20,700
This disgraziato.

1894
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,310
Him and Oswald. Two of a kind.

1895
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:25,770
At least in Dallas, the kids weren't there.

1896
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:26,780
It was just Jackie.

1897
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,300
Joey, your doctor called. You died an hour ago.

1898
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:32,670
You a Jewish fellow?

1899
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,120
Would you like to be?

1900
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:37,470
Don't worry about the operation. We don't do that no more.

1901
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:38,760
We freeze it.

1902
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,090
And you stand there and don't do anything

1903
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:43,180
and a Mexican broad comes over with a wet rock.

1904
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,050
Thwack!

1905
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:47,170
See, it's okay to laugh. I make fun of everybody.

1906
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:50,130
That's why God put us on this earth, to laugh.

1907
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:51,360
I work everyone.

1908
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,600
I make fun of blacks, I make fun of Jews.

1909
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:55,970
I work Gypsies, I work Italians.

1910
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:58,170
Well, not those Italians.

1911
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:59,900
No, no, no, no!

1912
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:02,150
It's okay, Joey. I got the money. Don't shoot.

1913
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:05,410
I was told today,

1914
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:07,670
"Be very careful about what you say."

1915
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:11,330
But, uh, all kidding aside, happy birthday, Joey.

1916
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:23,270
Russ.

1917
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,230
What are you doing with that?

1918
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,270
You really believe in that bullshit league?

1919
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:35,060
Well, it's not that.

1920
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:36,720
It's Italian.

1921
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:37,570
Joey. Joey.

1922
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,080
- What did I say? - Oh, no, no.

1923
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,950
- What did I say? - Joey, Joey. Joey. Joey.

1924
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,760
Now, listen.

1925
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,420
You can't say that stuff like that here. Okay? You can't do that.

1926
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:48,370
Why not? Rickles is the only one who can make jokes?

1927
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,570
The man's a boss.

1928
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:51,130
So I'm a boss. He's a boss.

1929
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:52,230
We're all supposed to be brothers, right?

1930
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:53,100
I know you're a boss.

1931
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,020
I know, but we don't wanna have a beef now. Okay?

1932
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:57,060
- We're brothers, right? - That's right, brothers.

1933
01:42:57,060 --> 01:42:58,830
- We're brothers? - You're brothers.

1934
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,520
- We're brothers. - I'm not arguing with you.

1935
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:01,530
Everybody's a brother.

1936
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:03,470
That's right, you're a brother. You're his brother.

1937
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:04,850
I'm not, but you guys are.

1938
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:06,710
So that's why I would like it if you just...

1939
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,100
- All right. - Okay?

1940
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,260
- We're brothers? - You're brothers.

1941
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:11,140
Yeah. It's my birthday.

1942
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:12,380
Happy birthday.

1943
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:14,060
Happy birthday.

1944
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,100
Get the fuck out of here.

1945
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:41,380
Now, for something like this,

1946
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:43,100
you're gonna need two guns.

1947
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:46,100
The one you're gonna use and a backup.

1948
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:50,030
You want something with more stopping power than a .22.

1949
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,870
You definitely don't want a silencer.

1950
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:00,890
You want to make a lot of noise to make the witnesses run away

1951
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:02,620
so they ain't gonna be looking at you.

1952
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:07,710
But not the noise a .45 makes

1953
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:09,260
'cause that makes too much noise,

1954
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:12,180
and a patrol car can hear it a few blocks away at least.

1955
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:19,870
The cops call a .32 a woman's gun because it's easier to handle

1956
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:21,940
and don't do the damage a .38 does,

1957
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:24,080
but, you know, it does enough.

1958
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,980
It would be late, so the tourists from Idaho

1959
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:37,920
wouldn't be there. They'd be in bed.

1960
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,550
And him being down there in Little Italy,

1961
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:43,380
maybe he'd be more comfortable, more relaxed.

1962
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:47,750
It was his birthday so he'd be there with his wife

1963
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:49,980
and his kid which, in this case,

1964
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,610
that's good because that's the point.

1965
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:54,340
They should have to see what it's like.

1966
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,800
He'd already been drinking,

1967
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:00,290
which would have slowed him down a lot.

1968
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,910
His bodyguard would be with him

1969
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:04,880
and Joey himself could be carrying, too,

1970
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,940
but then the piece would be in his wife's purse probably.

1971
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:17,010
You never got a lot of advance notice.

1972
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,680
All you knew was your part of it.

1973
01:45:21,810 --> 01:45:24,290
John the Redhead knew only one thing:

1974
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,180
he was gonna drop me off,

1975
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,680
circle the block and pick me up.

1976
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:40,110
You wanna take out the bodyguard first.

1977
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,560
Not kill him. Don't kill him, just disable him.

1978
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:45,450
You got no argument with him,

1979
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:47,830
so, not in the face or the chest.

1980
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:51,880
Sometimes, with something like this,

1981
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:54,670
you might want to go to the bathroom first.

1982
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,140
It gives you a chance to make sure nobody followed you in.

1983
01:45:58,490 --> 01:45:59,900
It also gives you a chance to make sure

1984
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:02,520
nobody is in the bathroom you have to worry about.

1985
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:05,420
It also gives you a chance to go to the bathroom.

1986
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,920
You don't want to be uncomfortable.

1987
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:11,180
But I went before, and in a place this small, this late,

1988
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,590
you might as well just get to work.

1989
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:14,510
We need more wine, all right?

1990
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:16,370
Tommy, some more wine.

1991
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:17,840
So how about after?

1992
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,090
- Cake, cake, cake! - Not yet.

1993
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:21,470
You're not even done eating the meal yet.

1994
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:23,780
You want the cake? Come on, you can't do that.

1995
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:27,910
Shit!

1996
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,850
Fuck! Fuck!

1997
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,580
It happened in New York's Little Italy,

1998
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:09,910
an area rumored to be neutral territory among mobsters.

1999
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:10,660
After the killing,

2000
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:13,390
police found several guns and some fingerprints

2001
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:14,930
which they were tracing today.

2002
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:16,670
Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo

2003
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:21,010
had come to the intimate seafood restaurant to cap an evening of celebration

2004
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,800
with his new bride of less than a month,

2005
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,560
and his 11-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.

2006
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,510
They were, uh, celebrating Joe's 47th birthday.

2007
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:32,090
They had been to a nightclub early in the evening.

2008
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:36,750
They were sitting at a rear table, this group of six people,

2009
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,090
when a, uh...

2010
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:41,930
a man walked in from the back door,

2011
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:43,430
and he walked up, uh,

2012
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:47,680
to the side of the table. He fired three shots.

2013
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:49,490
He hit Joe twice

2014
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:51,490
- and he hit his bodyguard... - Peggy, let's go.

2015
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:53,160
...Pete the Greek, one time.

2016
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:56,310
There was a total of 14 shots fired.

2017
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:57,330
Peggy, come on.

2018
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:59,980
It's quiet here on President Street,

2019
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,560
Joey Gallo's turf.

2020
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:03,550
In fact, it's too quiet.

2021
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:05,300
Out here in Brooklyn,

2022
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:06,640
Joey Gallo was a hero.

2023
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:10,490
Speculation has it that his death may start a gang war,

2024
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,230
if it hasn't already begun.

2025
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:48,520
- Take it easy, Jimmy. - You too, Mikey.

2026
01:48:48,770 --> 01:48:49,940
Take good care, Jimmy.

2027
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:51,800
If I don't see you again, hello.

2028
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,250
Four years later and $500,000 under the table

2029
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,970
to Nixon's re-election committee,

2030
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:59,270
Jimmy finally got what he wanted.

2031
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,670
Sorry, but I won't be back.

2032
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:03,780
A presidential pardon and his parole.

2033
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:04,830
Jimmy!

2034
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,260
What are you gonna do now, Jimmy?

2035
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:10,020
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do is register

2036
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:12,220
with the Federal Probation Office,

2037
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:16,540
and then I'm going down to Florida with my wife to get some sun.

2038
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:17,640
Any plans after that?

2039
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:20,500
Yeah, I'm gonna take back control of my union.

2040
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,910
How're you gonna do that, Jimmy?

2041
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:25,400
How do you like Fitz running against you?

2042
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,030
I don't.

2043
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:28,160
Jimmy, what was it like being locked up all that time?

2044
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:29,770
It was wonderful. Had a great time.

2045
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:32,750
The first thing I did was,

2046
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,730
I picked up some chili dogs from Lum's,

2047
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:36,950
which Jimmy loved almost as much as ice cream.

2048
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:38,430
A consultant to President

2049
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:40,780
Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee...

2050
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,480
The secret is they steam them in beer.

2051
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,620
There ain't a better hot dog in America.

2052
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,950
Police say McCord and his accomplices

2053
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:50,370
brought electronic listening devices with them

2054
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:52,810
and had removed two ceiling panels...

2055
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:55,370
...while installing eavesdropping equipment

2056
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:57,280
at the Democratic National Committee.

2057
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:01,130
Look at this. He's got the balls to run for President of the Teamsters.

2058
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:03,830
Look at this. And Tony Pro giving him an award.

2059
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:05,380
This fuck... Do you believe it?

2060
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:08,360
Look, Fitz is very popular with certain people.

2061
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,200
Of course he's popular. Who wouldn't be popular?

2062
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,580
He loans money to every goombah who asks.

2063
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:16,050
That's why Tony's behind him. He's given Fitz all his votes.

2064
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:18,260
You got great support from most of the union.

2065
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,710
All you need is Tony Pro's

2066
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:21,560
voters in the Northeast, and you can win.

2067
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:23,670
- You sure you don't want one of these? - No, thank you.

2068
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:27,750
I just can't believe I gotta go to Tony Pro to get votes.

2069
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:29,020
What is that?

2070
01:50:30,830 --> 01:50:33,110
Tony has Fitz in his pocket, Jimmy.

2071
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:34,450
Wise guys don't run the union.

2072
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:35,840
With Fitz, they do.

2073
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,560
Jimmy, listen, as soon as you're back as president,

2074
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:40,690
you can do anything you want to.

2075
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:42,450
You can fire anybody you want to.

2076
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,750
You can even fire Tony Pro.

2077
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:48,880
You could stand over him, watch him clear out his desk.

2078
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:50,620
You could strip-search the guy.

2079
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:53,870
Make sure he doesn't walk off with a paper clip.

2080
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:55,820
Yes. See that? Did you hear that?

2081
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,130
See, everybody thinks Jo's the nice one

2082
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:00,260
and I'm the bad guy.

2083
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:02,090
But it's opposite.

2084
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,640
She's the killer and I'm the sweetheart.

2085
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,100
Now I gotta make peace with the cocksucker.

2086
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,210
I want to make up with you.

2087
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:16,010
I need you to endorse me. Please, Tony.

2088
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,060
Please.

2089
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:18,260
Fucking...

2090
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:20,870
I'm not gonna get through this.

2091
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:22,760
You gotta talk to him, that's all. Just...

2092
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,860
You gotta deal with it, that's all.

2093
01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:25,580
Let the chips fall where they may.

2094
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:27,040
He is a cocksucker, though.

2095
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,200
If I sat down with him, would you come along?

2096
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,620
What are you talking about? Of course.

2097
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:33,260
How am I not gonna go with you?

2098
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:43,890
Fuck it. Let's go.

2099
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:45,780
Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.

2100
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,620
Give it a chance. Give it a few more minutes.

2101
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,210
- Just... - This isn't right.

2102
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:53,310
This isn't right. You don't do this.

2103
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:55,270
You don't keep a man waiting.

2104
01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:56,300
I know. I know.

2105
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,180
The only time you do

2106
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:02,090
is when you want to say something.

2107
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:04,910
- I know. - When you want to say "Fuck you."

2108
01:52:05,670 --> 01:52:06,620
That's the only time.

2109
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:09,020
Here they are.

2110
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,490
Can you believe this weather, Frank? Huh?

2111
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:16,620
It's 85 degrees outside. Perfect.

2112
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,720
Tony Jack.

2113
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:19,330
Jimmy.

2114
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:21,940
People freezing to death in New York and look at us, huh?

2115
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,460
Why we don't live here all year round is what I wanna know.

2116
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:26,810
Beautiful.

2117
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:29,300
- It's summer. - What?

2118
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,090
It's summer.

2119
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:34,430
People aren't freezing to death in New York.

2120
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:36,790
It's summer.

2121
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:41,640
In my mind, it's always eight degrees in New York.

2122
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,520
I'm making a point.

2123
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,380
You're making a point.

2124
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:46,790
Making a point dressing like that?

2125
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:48,990
Is that how you dress for a meeting?

2126
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:53,890
This is how you dress in Florida? In a suit?

2127
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,140
For a meeting?

2128
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,590
Anywhere. Florida, Timbuktu, I dress in a suit.

2129
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:00,660
For a meetin'.

2130
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:03,350
- And you're late. - What?

2131
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:05,390
You're late.

2132
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,690
Yeah, there was traffic.

2133
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:10,110
Yes, traffic.

2134
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:11,790
Wasn't there traffic?

2135
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:13,430
- You give me traffic? - There was traffic.

2136
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,930
What do you want from us?

2137
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:15,790
It was bumper to fuckin' bumper.

2138
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:17,870
Yeah, yeah. No, it's bad, you know?

2139
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:18,780
Traffic.

2140
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:22,880
I never waited for anyone who was late

2141
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,130
more than ten minutes in my life.

2142
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:28,450
I'd say fifteen. Fifteen's right.

2143
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,350
No, ten.

2144
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:32,700
I don't think so, ten's not enough.

2145
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,220
You have to take traffic into account.

2146
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:37,550
That's what I'm doing. I'm taking traffic into account.

2147
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,210
That's why it's ten.

2148
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:41,390
- I still say 15. - No, ten.

2149
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:44,300
Fine. We disagree on that.

2150
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:46,030
How about twelve and a half minutes?

2151
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:47,390
There we go, 12.5.

2152
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,910
The middle. Right in the middle. Beautiful.

2153
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:50,910
More than ten...

2154
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:53,520
you're saying something.

2155
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:56,450
- You saying something to me? - I'm here.

2156
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,180
It says what it says.

2157
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:02,240
So there it is.

2158
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,220
Where do we go from here?

2159
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,530
Well, what can I do for you?

2160
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:13,990
I want you...

2161
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:17,370
I...

2162
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,360
I want you to endorse me...

2163
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:23,910
for you know what.

2164
01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:27,740
Before we get to that, let's straighten that other thing up.

2165
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:30,160
No. The other thing is none of my business.

2166
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,480
I can't do anything about your pension.

2167
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,140
I can't. Not with Fitz in there. Fitz is in there, you know.

2168
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:37,520
- You go to Fitz. - I did.

2169
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:38,660
- He'll help you out. - I did.

2170
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,670
He said he'll take care of it, no questions asked.

2171
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:42,720
You wouldn't do that but he will.

2172
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:44,990
I meant the other thing.

2173
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:48,210
What other thing?

2174
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:49,500
You know.

2175
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:50,820
I don't know.

2176
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:52,340
Your apology.

2177
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:55,660
My apology?

2178
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:58,550
My apology for what?

2179
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:00,440
For what you said when you were sitting there

2180
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,510
eating your ice cream like some fucking king.

2181
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:06,310
That was an ethnic slur. "You people."

2182
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:09,100
- Did you know what he said? - Nah, I mean, I heard...

2183
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:11,590
I heard you had an altercation in the can, but I don't know.

2184
01:55:11,590 --> 01:55:13,010
Yeah, "You people."

2185
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:16,270
That's what you said. Right, Jim?

2186
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:20,010
"You people." Am I beneath you?

2187
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:23,030
Definitely.

2188
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:25,120
- Jimmy, come on. - Jimmy, what're you doing?

2189
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:27,420
Don't forget, "You people" got you where you are.

2190
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,890
Don't...don't tell me that, you fucking...

2191
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:30,690
That's your problem, Jimmy.

2192
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:32,780
Your problem is you're a piece of shit.

2193
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:33,840
Jimmy, come on.

2194
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,940
- Jimmy, what are you doin'? - Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

2195
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,090
I asked for your endorsement and you're giving me all this crap.

2196
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:39,420
I asked for your apology.

2197
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:42,070
Who the fuck are you to apologize to?

2198
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:42,850
Jimmy...

2199
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:44,400
Who the fuck are you?

2200
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:45,420
Be gentle.

2201
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,130
- I don't need this. - Let's just sit down. Tony.

2202
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:49,390
I need this? I need you?

2203
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:50,900
- Yeah, you need me. - Oh, please.

2204
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:52,790
Jimmy, come on. You're asking him for something.

2205
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:54,890
The guy gets me nervous. He talks about things that get me upset.

2206
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:56,580
- Take it easy. - Everybody's here.

2207
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:59,290
Let's have the fucking meeting. Come on.

2208
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:00,630
- Let's talk. - That's all.

2209
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,980
He's here.

2210
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,610
Was this the altercation youse had in the can?

2211
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:09,760
Yeah, it was something like this.

2212
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,550
We... We got to arm wrestling.

2213
01:56:12,830 --> 01:56:13,750
He lost.

2214
01:56:13,870 --> 01:56:15,750
I lost. You should see his ribs.

2215
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,430
Why don't you just talk about what you need to talk about.

2216
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:19,710
- That's right. - Yeah.

2217
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:21,460
What do you want me to do?

2218
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,160
I said, "You people."

2219
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,070
What do you want me to do, apologize for it?

2220
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:27,340
That's exactly what I want, Jimmy. An apology.

2221
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,150
I'll apologize for it.

2222
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:30,720
That's all I want.

2223
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:35,720
After you apologize for being late,

2224
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:39,440
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

2225
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,280
Jimmy, are you out of your fucking mind?

2226
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,210
I'll apologize for being late

2227
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:47,030
after I kidnap your granddaughter, rip her guts out,

2228
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,960
and send them to you in a fucking envelope!

2229
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:54,780
Get him off! Come on!

2230
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:55,830
I'll fucking kill him!

2231
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:57,340
- Come on, Tony! - Jesus!

2232
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:04,480
You think Russ would...

2233
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:06,540
would do something about this guy?

2234
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,880
That's complicated.

2235
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:11,440
Yeah. It's complicated.

2236
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:13,870
I'd like to clip the motherfucker myself, you know,

2237
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,930
- Get the okay from them. But... - I know.

2238
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,610
This guy's gotta go.

2239
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:19,960
He's gotta go, Frank.

2240
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:22,150
I'm not gonna get the okay to do that.

2241
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,750
Frank, just talk to the guy.

2242
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:28,050
Okay? Just talk to him.

2243
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,410
These guys from Jersey keep fucking calling me

2244
01:57:38,410 --> 01:57:40,480
about this bullshit between these two guys.

2245
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,520
I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told them.

2246
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:45,690
I don't approve of what Pro said about Jimmy.

2247
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:46,280
No.

2248
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,850
I mean, who talks like that about a person's grandchildren?

2249
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:51,040
- It's not fucking right. - No.

2250
01:57:56,370 --> 01:57:57,760
But Pro isn't nobody.

2251
01:57:58,970 --> 01:58:00,000
Jimmy should know that.

2252
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:01,700
What am I gonna go?

2253
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:04,320
I'm not gonna tell this guy what he can or can't fucking say,

2254
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:05,460
like he's a child.

2255
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,140
Well, listen.

2256
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:09,250
Jimmy don't mean nothing. He just gets upset.

2257
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,200
Russ, come on, we all know he's a fucking hothead.

2258
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,550
We're all hotheads once in a while.

2259
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:14,720
Yeah, but Jimmy says things he shouldn't say sometimes.

2260
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,330
Yeah. We all do that too.

2261
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,230
Well, somebody should just calm him down.

2262
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,720
Yeah, well, that... I'm gonna...

2263
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:27,020
I'm gonna calm him down. He's difficult, but...

2264
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:28,720
Maybe this could help him calm down.

2265
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,470
You could tell him that I always liked him.

2266
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:35,600
And I won't stand in his way of him trying to get his job back.

2267
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:37,020
I will. I will tell him that, Tony.

2268
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,220
- Okay? - Yes.

2269
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:40,530
That's not making me calm down.

2270
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:41,990
Standing by me.

2271
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:44,240
What the fuck does that mean?

2272
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:48,170
Standing by me ain't the same thing as doing something

2273
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:51,880
about some out-of-control fucking psycho!

2274
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:54,260
Jimmy, the Little Guy ain't a nobody.

2275
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,460
You gotta understand that.

2276
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:56,990
- He ain't a nobody. - He's a cocksucker.

2277
01:58:56,990 --> 01:58:58,600
Fitz is a cocksucker.

2278
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,660
I'm gonna deal with both these cocksuckers...

2279
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:03,230
myself!

2280
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:06,290
This used to be my office.

2281
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:09,570
Go look for Frank Fitzsimmons there. You're not gonna find him.

2282
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:12,260
That's because he travels all over the country

2283
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:15,610
looking for goddamn golf courses because that's what he does.

2284
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,730
He plays golf.

2285
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:18,660
Who is he to run around with Nixon,

2286
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,640
run around with the attorney general?

2287
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:25,080
He does this and collects full-time salary while he's doing it.

2288
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:26,040
Now, how do you do that?

2289
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,140
There's not enough hours in a day to do this job.

2290
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,610
I was sent to prison for fraud.

2291
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:34,070
This is fraud, what he's doing.

2292
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:38,100
So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?

2293
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:39,990
He does it by sending a message

2294
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:42,250
to Jimmy's old friend, Dave Johnson.

2295
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:46,030
Now, Dave Johnson, he ran Local 299.

2296
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:48,780
This was the message.

2297
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:54,870
So this is how Fitz says

2298
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:58,180
he wants my old pal Dave Johnson to step down

2299
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:02,740
so he can have his son take over Local 299.

2300
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:07,390
This is how I'm gonna say no to his son, little fucking Fitz.

2301
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:10,040
She looked a lot like your mother.

2302
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,060
About the same size.

2303
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:11,910
Pops, come on, you told me like a thousand times.

2304
02:00:11,910 --> 02:00:14,160
Good-looking girl. She was a good-looking girl.

2305
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:17,070
But I had no idea that it wasn't your mother.

2306
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:17,990
It was dark and...

2307
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,460
This is how Fitz says he doesn't like

2308
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:31,830
who I say runs the 299.

2309
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:33,770
By firing my wife

2310
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:38,100
from her forty-eight-fucking-thousand- dollar-a-year union job!

2311
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,230
Son of a bitch. Fuck him!

2312
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:25,560
He had previously taped the locks

2313
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:28,480
on the entry door of the basement of the Watergate...

2314
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:30,360
- What are you looking at? - Uh, it's...

2315
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:32,080
It's Big Ears.

2316
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:35,390
He had noticed that the tape had been removed,

2317
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:38,750
and he re-taped the door.

2318
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:40,650
Big Ears?

2319
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:42,030
That's, uh...

2320
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:44,180
Somebody I met a long time ago. Just...

2321
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:47,750
His ears ain't so big.

2322
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:50,900
...at that point, I said "Let us junk it,"

2323
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,950
meaning let us scrap the operation.

2324
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:56,710
Mr. Liddy and Mr. McCord talked between themselves

2325
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:59,460
and the decision was made to go.

2326
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:01,280
I thought it was very foolhardy...

2327
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,060
So, Frank Fitzsimmons, in your opinion,

2328
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:05,550
should he remain president of the Teamsters?

2329
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:06,640
Absolutely not.

2330
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:09,330
Frank Fitzsimmons has sold his union out

2331
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:11,110
to his underworld pals.

2332
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:12,960
The mob controls him,

2333
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,630
which means it controls our pension fund.

2334
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:19,690
I'm talking about a billion dollars in low or no-interest loans

2335
02:02:19,690 --> 02:02:22,330
this man has given to known racketeers

2336
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:23,990
for their illegal enterprises.

2337
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:25,160
Not anymore.

2338
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:28,510
It's time for the rats to abandon ship.

2339
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,870
Is he serious?

2340
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:32,680
Not Jimmy. This is all publicity.

2341
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:34,780
He's running for office. He's putting on a show.

2342
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:37,540
Yeah, it's all puff. It's got no substance, nothing.

2343
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,150
Maybe he means what he says.

2344
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:42,180
- Tony, he's campaigning. - Russ.

2345
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,850
He's liable to say any fucking thing.

2346
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:45,650
I don't care if he's campaigning.

2347
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:47,030
He can't talk like that.

2348
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:48,400
It's no fucking good.

2349
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:49,550
I understand what you're saying.

2350
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:51,140
You know what he should do, Russ?

2351
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:53,570
He should cash in that big pension of his.

2352
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:56,030
Spend more time with his grandchildren.

2353
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,440
He got a beautiful family, no?

2354
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:00,730
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

2355
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:01,860
Maybe he should relax.

2356
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:05,310
Word should get back to him.

2357
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:11,850
I... I just wanna say...

2358
02:03:11,850 --> 02:03:14,260
I don't want you to take this the wrong way.

2359
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:15,960
But there I was with some people

2360
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,900
and they were saying, and you know who they are...

2361
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:18,890
They were saying...

2362
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:23,190
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy.

2363
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,020
We don't want any problem.

2364
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,890
We just think that he should...

2365
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,930
maybe enjoy his grandchildren,

2366
02:03:30,930 --> 02:03:33,360
enjoy his pension, enjoy his life as is."

2367
02:03:33,390 --> 02:03:35,020
Go no further, Frank.

2368
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:38,070
Who said it?

2369
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:41,430
- It don't matter who said it. - Oh, it matters.

2370
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,980
- Was it Russell? - No.

2371
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,140
Of course it's not Russell.

2372
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:48,610
It's that little cocksucker from the Miami fiasco?

2373
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:50,020
- No? - No.

2374
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:51,430
Not him. No?

2375
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:52,760
Then who?

2376
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,470
I'm gonna tell you.

2377
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:57,890
Tony.

2378
02:03:58,700 --> 02:03:59,630
Tony?

2379
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:00,760
Which Tony?

2380
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:02,250
They're all named Tony.

2381
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,610
I mean, what's the matter with Italians?

2382
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:06,790
They can only think of one name.

2383
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:09,700
The other Tony.

2384
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:12,670
What Tony?

2385
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:17,060
Salerno.

2386
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:26,920
Well, what can I say?

2387
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,380
Jimmy, I'm trying to help you.

2388
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:32,310
- I'm trying to tell you something. - I know you are.

2389
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,340
Frank, don't even think about it.

2390
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:37,510
I don't keep my mouth shut...

2391
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:38,970
- I know that. - ...for anyone.

2392
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:42,610
I know that, you know that, they don't know that.

2393
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:47,240
That's who I am, that's what I am and that's what I'm gonna do.

2394
02:04:49,370 --> 02:04:50,750
Somebody can tell him that.

2395
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:51,980
He said that?

2396
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,590
In so many words, you know.

2397
02:04:54,770 --> 02:04:56,440
Well, before he says something like that,

2398
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:58,200
he should remember that Joe Gallo liked to make

2399
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,650
a lot of fucking noise, too.

2400
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:01,500
Somebody should tell him that.

2401
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:02,580
Who said?

2402
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:06,290
- Tony. - He said that?

2403
02:05:06,410 --> 02:05:08,160
That's it. That does it.

2404
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:11,450
I'm never gonna retire now.

2405
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,870
Somebody can tell him that.

2406
02:05:13,870 --> 02:05:16,120
Jimmy, I did tell him. I told him over and over.

2407
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:18,030
All right, you told him. Let's stop this, then.

2408
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:19,450
Forget it. Enough.

2409
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:22,160
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

2410
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:28,790
What's the matter?

2411
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,410
Nothing.

2412
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:31,870
What?

2413
02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:33,120
- Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing?

2414
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,660
Come on, you're thinking something. What?

2415
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:36,910
I just...

2416
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:39,790
What? Come on. What are you doing?

2417
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:42,240
- It ain't the right time. - What do you mean it ain't the right time?

2418
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:43,990
It is the right time. What isn't the right time?

2419
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:44,790
Say it.

2420
02:05:47,330 --> 02:05:48,870
The Local's putting together

2421
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:51,370
a testimonial dinner for me and...

2422
02:05:51,370 --> 02:05:53,490
A testimonial dinner for you, that's good.

2423
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:56,160
Yeah. But later... Later, when...

2424
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:57,250
What's the matter?

2425
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,330
I was gonna ask you if you would...

2426
02:06:04,330 --> 02:06:05,910
present the award to me.

2427
02:06:07,450 --> 02:06:08,410
Well...

2428
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:10,950
That's nice of you, Frank.

2429
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:13,040
Really. That's nice of you. And, you know...

2430
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:14,870
Who's gonna be there?

2431
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,110
Everybody.

2432
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:22,040
Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony, huh?

2433
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:24,750
Everybody from Downtown.

2434
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:28,160
Nah. Nah, it ain't a good idea. Everybody's gonna be there.

2435
02:06:28,160 --> 02:06:30,790
People... You're gonna be uncomfortable.

2436
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:34,160
I don't give a fuck who's there.

2437
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:35,580
We gonna let those cocksuckers

2438
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:38,870
keep me from your big night? There's no way.

2439
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:39,910
No.

2440
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:43,540
I'm gonna be there. And I'll be honored to be there.

2441
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,160
You deserve this.

2442
02:06:45,370 --> 02:06:47,290
- Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you. - Yeah.

2443
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:53,530
- That mole Dean. - Yeah.

2444
02:06:53,530 --> 02:06:55,490
- She's a good-looking broad. - She's nice.

2445
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:56,660
I did not realize

2446
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,830
that Mr. Howard Hunt worked most of the time

2447
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:00,080
while he was at the White House

2448
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:02,080
in the plumbers unit until after June...

2449
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,740
He's a rat, but that's, you know...

2450
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:05,790
He's a rat. But he's a smart rat.

2451
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:11,900
We've got a great crowd for Frank tonight, huh?

2452
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:13,000
Come on. Give it up.

2453
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:20,700
That's because Frank is a man with a lot of friends.

2454
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:25,120
From his war buddies who fought with him in Italy

2455
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:27,830
under General George Patton...

2456
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:32,290
to the drivers, national organizers,

2457
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:35,160
business agents, local presidents,

2458
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:38,950
joint committee chairmen, and regional trustees,

2459
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:42,620
we are all friends of Frank's tonight.

2460
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:44,660
Friends of Frank.

2461
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:49,870
Like NAACP president Cecil Moore.

2462
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:53,580
District Attorney Emmett Fitzpatrick.

2463
02:07:54,330 --> 02:07:57,120
Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo.

2464
02:07:58,700 --> 02:08:00,290
Hey, they like you, Frank.

2465
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,950
And, of course, our featured speaker,

2466
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:05,540
James Riddell Hoffa.

2467
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,790
And meanwhile, outside in the trees,

2468
02:08:14,790 --> 02:08:16,160
we got the FBI.

2469
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:19,540
Somebody wanna check on them?

2470
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,200
Now, let me tell you about the first time I met Frank.

2471
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,330
He took me out to a steak dinner,

2472
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:27,410
and he asked me, he said, "How do you like your steak?"

2473
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:29,160
I said, "I like it rare." He said, "Me too."

2474
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:31,500
Well, they bring out the steaks. Mine's rare.

2475
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:33,830
Frank's was still walking from the kitchen.

2476
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:37,580
He turns to me, he said, "Well, you know,

2477
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:39,910
I'm an animal lover. I don't wanna hurt it."

2478
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:43,120
He's an animal lover.

2479
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:09,240
This guy is not even the goddamn president

2480
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:11,410
and he's holding up people's loans.

2481
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:13,750
- Are you sure? - I'm sure.

2482
02:09:14,450 --> 02:09:15,450
And how's he supposed to do that?

2483
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:17,040
Because his guys are holding 'em back loans

2484
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,080
on Carlos's new hotel in New Orleans,

2485
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:21,410
the add-on that we're doing at Caesars.

2486
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:28,080
- And what's Fitz doing all this time? - Fitz?

2487
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:30,040
Yeah, he's supposed to help with this shit.

2488
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:32,410
The money comes from the Pension Fund trustees.

2489
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:33,740
They gotta sign off on it.

2490
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:35,990
They're supposed to be rubber-stamping what Fitz says.

2491
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,290
- Right, right. Yeah. - Except Jimmy

2492
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:40,870
has a couple of them to stop rubber-stamping.

2493
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:44,330
The son of a bitch.

2494
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:46,370
I thought we took care of that.

2495
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:48,950
You know what he told somebody?

2496
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:50,950
He goes, once Fitz is out and he's in,

2497
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:53,120
he's gonna call in the old loans.

2498
02:09:53,330 --> 02:09:56,870
Hotels, casinos, real estate, no matter what it is.

2499
02:09:56,870 --> 02:09:59,290
And if you don't have his money and interest in two seconds,

2500
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:00,620
he's taking 'em over.

2501
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:02,200
We can't have that.

2502
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:06,540
- He said that? - He said that.

2503
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:08,450
You sure he said that, Tony?

2504
02:10:08,450 --> 02:10:09,580
He said that.

2505
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:11,990
Everything I'm telling you, yeah, he said.

2506
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,120
I mean, who does he think he is? Castro?

2507
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,990
* The time is now *

2508
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
* The time to stand and cheer *

2509
02:10:22,410 --> 02:10:26,370
* 'Cause better times are here to stay *

2510
02:10:26,370 --> 02:10:29,080
* Oh, yesterday is over *

2511
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,290
* Tomorrow's on its way *

2512
02:10:31,290 --> 02:10:36,330
* But look what's new and made for you today *

2513
02:10:36,330 --> 02:10:39,450
* Today *

2514
02:10:39,450 --> 02:10:40,870
You don't need money, do you?

2515
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:42,330
It's not about money.

2516
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:43,910
If it's not about money,

2517
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:45,870
then I'm really having trouble understanding,

2518
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:48,370
because I don't know what all the talk is about.

2519
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:49,830
It's my union.

2520
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,950
- Is that hard to understand? - No, no.

2521
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:55,490
It's your union, that's right. It'll always be your union.

2522
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:57,080
You could step down and still run it.

2523
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,290
- No, you don't step down. - What do you mean?

2524
02:10:59,290 --> 02:11:01,330
Russ, you don't step down to run a union.

2525
02:11:01,330 --> 02:11:03,200
You step down to go to your grave.

2526
02:11:03,370 --> 02:11:05,000
Well, listen.

2527
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:08,240
I still think... I can't help but think, I'm sorry,

2528
02:11:08,250 --> 02:11:10,580
but is there another reason or something?

2529
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:13,450
This is my union! What do you mean, "another reason"?

2530
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:16,330
This is my union.

2531
02:11:16,330 --> 02:11:18,040
All right? Let's start with that

2532
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,950
and then try to understand things.

2533
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:22,000
Listen, some people,

2534
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:25,330
not me, but some people,

2535
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:27,580
they're a little concerned.

2536
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:31,250
Some people, not me, they think that you might...

2537
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:32,870
I might...

2538
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:36,910
You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation.

2539
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:41,370
I'm not showing appreciation?

2540
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:43,990
According to, you know, some people.

2541
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,080
I went to school for five fucking years.

2542
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,830
- Yes, you did. - Five fucking years.

2543
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,910
I didn't name one fucking name.

2544
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:54,740
- You did the right thing. - I did the right thing.

2545
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:55,830
You did the right thing.

2546
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:57,740
I sat there every day with that

2547
02:11:57,750 --> 02:12:01,160
whining cocksucker from New Jersey,

2548
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:04,700
talking to me about his woes, his problems,

2549
02:12:05,410 --> 02:12:08,580
and all I wanted to do was finish my ice cream in peace.

2550
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:14,080
This cocksucker shows up at a meeting 15 minutes late,

2551
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:16,790
wearing fucking shorts!

2552
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:20,120
- Who wears shorts to a meeting? - Nobody.

2553
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,660
- That's right. - Nobody.

2554
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,160
I'm not showing appreciation?

2555
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:25,370
It's not me.

2556
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:26,910
According to some people...

2557
02:12:26,910 --> 02:12:29,410
No, I know it's not you. Some people...

2558
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:32,120
Some people say I'm not showing appreciation?

2559
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,410
Well, then fuck them.

2560
02:12:34,330 --> 02:12:35,870
I'm trying to help you, Jim.

2561
02:12:35,870 --> 02:12:36,950
I know you are.

2562
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:39,450
But nobody threatens Hoffa.

2563
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:41,790
* The time is now *

2564
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:44,160
* The time is now *

2565
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:50,450
* The time is now *

2566
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:03,740
He has done it as a driver,

2567
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:06,200
he has done it as an organizer,

2568
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:09,040
and I don't think many of you here know this,

2569
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,870
but Frank holds a record.

2570
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:16,200
It's most arrests on the picket line.

2571
02:13:17,790 --> 02:13:22,240
Twenty-six times in 24 hours,

2572
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:23,910
beating my record.

2573
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:29,750
There it is, ladies and gentlemen. There's no exaggeration.

2574
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:35,290
He is a union man to his bones.

2575
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:37,450
Which side are you on?

2576
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:38,830
Your side!

2577
02:13:38,830 --> 02:13:39,910
Whose side?

2578
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:41,120
Your side!

2579
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:41,950
My side.

2580
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:43,080
Your side.

2581
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:45,200
- His side. - Yeah!

2582
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:46,580
There it is.

2583
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:50,870
And so, it is an honor for me to be here tonight

2584
02:13:50,870 --> 02:13:52,540
to present this award

2585
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:57,330
to my dear friend, Mr. Frank Sheeran!

2586
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:08,870
Thank you, Jimmy, thank you so much.

2587
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:12,490
And thank you to my lovely wife Reenie

2588
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:14,330
for being here with me.

2589
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:17,410
My lovely, sweet, adorable daughters,

2590
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:21,620
Maryanne, Dolores, Connie, Peggy,

2591
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:24,580
for putting up with me for all these years.

2592
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,700
And, Jimmy, I can't tell you what this means to me

2593
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:30,450
to get this honor from you.

2594
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:34,660
It's the highlight of my life. Thank you very, very much.

2595
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:37,750
And this man, James Riddell Hoffa,

2596
02:14:38,290 --> 02:14:40,540
is the guy that gets the job done.

2597
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,540
I'm behind you, Jimmy.

2598
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:45,910
All the way.

2599
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:48,950
In any case,

2600
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:51,490
from the deepest part of my heart, I thank you all.

2601
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:53,500
'Cause I don't really deserve all this.

2602
02:14:54,370 --> 02:14:57,160
But I have bursitis and I don't deserve that either.

2603
02:14:58,870 --> 02:15:01,370
Thank you all tonight and thank you for coming.

2604
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:02,250
Good night.

2605
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:15,870
What happened to "Say cheese"?

2606
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:17,500
Cheese!

2607
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:30,370
* Bringing you all the love your heart can hold *

2608
02:15:30,370 --> 02:15:39,250
* Please say "sí, sí" *

2609
02:15:39,410 --> 02:15:49,290
* Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me *

2610
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:57,790
* Blue Spanish eyes *

2611
02:15:59,450 --> 02:16:08,990
* Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico *

2612
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:16,950
* True Spanish eyes *

2613
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:27,040
* Please smile for me once more before I go... *

2614
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:35,500
Only three people in the world have one of these.

2615
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:37,660
And only one of them is Irish.

2616
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,160
I have one.

2617
02:16:39,410 --> 02:16:40,910
Angelo has one.

2618
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:44,540
Now you have one.

2619
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:50,700
This is beautiful.

2620
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:57,410
I... I don't... I don't know what to say, Russ. It's...

2621
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,450
Slip it on. See how it looks.

2622
02:17:04,450 --> 02:17:06,120
- Feel good? - Yeah.

2623
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:11,000
You know how strong I made you? You know how strong?

2624
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:13,910
You're my kid.

2625
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:17,290
Nobody... Nobody can fuck with you.

2626
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:18,500
Nobody.

2627
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:46,000
Listen, Frank.

2628
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:49,750
Things have gotten out of hand with our friend again.

2629
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:54,160
And some people are having serious problems with him.

2630
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,990
And it's at a point where

2631
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,540
you're gonna have to talk to him and tell him

2632
02:18:01,410 --> 02:18:02,950
it's what it is.

2633
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,540
What it is?

2634
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:08,830
Yes. It's what they want.

2635
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,620
It's where it's gotten.

2636
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:14,540
You're close to him. Maybe he'll listen to you.

2637
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,410
You know I talked to him.

2638
02:18:16,410 --> 02:18:18,410
He's a tough guy to talk to. You know him.

2639
02:18:18,410 --> 02:18:20,240
He has no choice.

2640
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:22,040
He has no choice.

2641
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:24,160
These are the higher-ups.

2642
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:28,540
Well, he's a higher-up too. I mean... No?

2643
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:31,330
Not like this. You know that.

2644
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:32,870
Come on now, Frank.

2645
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:37,700
If they can whack a president,

2646
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,200
they can whack a president of the union.

2647
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:44,410
You know it and I know it.

2648
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:56,660
I talk to this guy, I talk to him, I talk to him,

2649
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:58,040
I talk to him, he don't listen.

2650
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:00,290
But he's gotta listen now. I gotta make him listen.

2651
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:06,410
That ain't right. He's... he's a fucking knucklehead.

2652
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:19,410
Jimmy. I talked to Russ.

2653
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:21,160
He talked to Tony.

2654
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:22,500
He means what he's saying.

2655
02:19:23,370 --> 02:19:25,450
- Who? Russ? - No, Tony.

2656
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:26,910
- Tony? - Yeah.

2657
02:19:27,370 --> 02:19:28,870
Well, I mean what I'm saying.

2658
02:19:29,790 --> 02:19:33,620
He can't seem to get that through his fat, fucking Sicilian head.

2659
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:35,580
Can he? Don't worry about it.

2660
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:36,700
What's the matter with you?

2661
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:38,040
You... you look...

2662
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:39,200
- I'm concerned. - Yeah, I know.

2663
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,500
You look concerned. What are you concerned about?

2664
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:42,370
I'm... I'm...

2665
02:19:42,370 --> 02:19:43,950
They should be concerned.

2666
02:19:43,950 --> 02:19:45,290
- They are. They are. - Well, let them be.

2667
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:46,870
They're more than a little concerned.

2668
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:48,290
There's widespread concern.

2669
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:49,750
It's a big problem.

2670
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:55,290
Tony told the old man to tell me to tell you...

2671
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:57,040
"It's what it is."

2672
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,040
What it is?

2673
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:03,290
It's what it is.

2674
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:08,450
Please, listen to me.

2675
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:12,160
They wouldn't dare.

2676
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:14,450
- Don't... - They wouldn't dare.

2677
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:16,290
- Jimmy... - Please, Frank, come on.

2678
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:18,080
- Don't say they wouldn't dare. - No.

2679
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:21,120
Don't... don't tell me that kinda... That's fairy tales.

2680
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,330
No, don't say they wouldn't dare.

2681
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:26,370
If something funny happens to me...

2682
02:20:28,290 --> 02:20:29,160
they're done.

2683
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,290
You understand that? And they know it.

2684
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:33,910
Because I got files. I got proof.

2685
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,750
I got records. I got tapes.

2686
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:38,200
Any time I want, they'll be gone.

2687
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:39,830
These Guinea motherfuckers

2688
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:41,990
will spend the rest of their lives in jail,

2689
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,870
and they know it.

2690
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:45,040
They know it.

2691
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,410
But what you're saying is what they're concerned about.

2692
02:20:47,410 --> 02:20:49,120
What I'm saying is I know things.

2693
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:52,540
I know things they don't know I know.

2694
02:20:52,910 --> 02:20:55,080
- Please... - Are you gonna take that chance?

2695
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,200
What chance am I... Why should I be taking a chance?

2696
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,830
They're saying this is it.

2697
02:20:59,540 --> 02:21:01,540
They're saying this is it, and then it's it?

2698
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:03,660
- Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank. - Come on.

2699
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:05,200
Jimmy, I'm trying to tell you something.

2700
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:07,450
I know you are. You're telling me that they're threatening me

2701
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:09,080
and I gotta do what they say.

2702
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,910
It's more than a threat. It's the bottom line.

2703
02:21:11,910 --> 02:21:12,910
The bottom line.

2704
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:15,120
It's what it is.

2705
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:17,830
They do something to me, I do something to them.

2706
02:21:18,660 --> 02:21:21,120
That's all I know. I don't know anything else. Do you?

2707
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:26,080
So what am I gonna do? What am I gonna tell McGee?

2708
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:27,870
That you're not gonna listen?

2709
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:29,580
He ain't used to people not listening to him.

2710
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,620
Well, neither am I.

2711
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:33,950
- What? - Neither am I.

2712
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:35,870
Then I don't know what to do.

2713
02:21:35,870 --> 02:21:37,620
I mean, maybe you should get some bodies around you

2714
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:39,290
- for protection. - Come on. Please.

2715
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:41,240
I'm not gonna go that route.

2716
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:42,910
Don't do this to me, Frank.

2717
02:21:42,910 --> 02:21:45,330
What do you mean, "bodies around me"? I don't need...

2718
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:47,910
You put bodies around you, then they go after your family.

2719
02:21:47,910 --> 02:21:50,160
- It doesn't matter. You worried? - I'm worried.

2720
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,700
Get some bodies around you. I'll tell you why.

2721
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:55,120
This could happen to you.

2722
02:21:55,330 --> 02:21:57,330
They could come after you

2723
02:21:57,620 --> 02:21:58,910
since you're with me.

2724
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:00,200
No?

2725
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:03,870
I'm worried.

2726
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:06,540
Tell Russ I got nothing but respect for him.

2727
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:09,160
I got a little trouble with him.

2728
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:11,700
We were talking before and I just got a little crazy.

2729
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:14,790
- You know how I am. I just blow. Sometimes. - Yeah.

2730
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:16,200
I just walked away like that.

2731
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:18,200
But I get that way. I get abrupt.

2732
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:21,040
Maybe you could tell him how much I respect him.

2733
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:23,620
I have nothing but respect for this guy.

2734
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:25,330
I would never hurt him,

2735
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:28,790
no matter what I do with files, or whatever I do with anything.

2736
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,160
But you should tell him. Yourself.

2737
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,410
No, I'm not gonna tell him myself.

2738
02:22:32,410 --> 02:22:33,450
- Please. - Come on.

2739
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:36,000
- It would go a long way. - He's your rabbi.

2740
02:22:36,410 --> 02:22:38,040
Because of him, you're here.

2741
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:39,250
You tell him.

2742
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:41,080
Listen to me.

2743
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:44,120
At the end, there's only one thing that's real.

2744
02:22:44,750 --> 02:22:46,660
This is my union.

2745
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:51,410
This is my union, Frank.

2746
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:55,790
Very simple when you say it that way.

2747
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:02,160
Peggy!

2748
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:04,200
Shall we dance?

2749
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:05,580
Excuse us.

2750
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:39,410
A couple of hours outside Detroit,

2751
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:41,620
we figured we'd spend the night,

2752
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:43,500
drive up in the morning.

2753
02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:45,700
I mean, the wedding, that was the thing.

2754
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:50,040
Bill Bufalino, you know, was giving his daughter away to a hell of a guy.

2755
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:52,540
Better than the bum she was with before.

2756
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:54,580
And that was all well and good.

2757
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:58,500
But the wedding was really a peace mission.

2758
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:00,790
And that's what we were there for.

2759
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:02,750
And everybody kinda knew that,

2760
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:04,750
and we were there to straighten it all out.

2761
02:24:05,330 --> 02:24:06,700
- Jimmy? - Yeah.

2762
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:08,490
I'm with the old man, we're driving up.

2763
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,870
He hopes we can straighten this whole thing out.

2764
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:12,080
What did he say?

2765
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,540
He said he hopes we can straighten it out.

2766
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:15,410
After the wedding, we sit down, we talk,

2767
02:24:15,410 --> 02:24:16,370
we straighten it out.

2768
02:24:16,370 --> 02:24:17,330
Right, the wedding.

2769
02:24:17,330 --> 02:24:18,870
I'm not going to the wedding.

2770
02:24:18,910 --> 02:24:20,700
Too many people I don't like are gonna be there,

2771
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:22,620
so I'm not going to the wedding.

2772
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:23,990
You're not going to the wedding?

2773
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,200
I'm not gonna be there.

2774
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:28,540
Well, then we could...

2775
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:30,490
Jimmy, then we could do it anywhere you want.

2776
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:32,540
We can do it at your house.

2777
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:33,990
We can do it anywhere you want.

2778
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,370
Wherever you're comfortable.

2779
02:24:36,330 --> 02:24:37,290
The lake?

2780
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:39,580
Yeah, the lake. You wanna do it at the lake?

2781
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:43,540
From day one, I wanted to work this out.

2782
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:46,740
- I know. I know. - From day fucking one.

2783
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:49,540
I know. Nobody knows better than me. I know that.

2784
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:52,500
All right, uh... Just you two, right?

2785
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:54,450
I mean, not the Little Guy.

2786
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:56,740
- No, of course, the Little Guy. - No.

2787
02:24:56,750 --> 02:24:58,290
I'm not doing it with him.

2788
02:24:58,290 --> 02:24:59,950
Jimmy, there's no point just the three of us.

2789
02:24:59,950 --> 02:25:01,080
No, no. No, no.

2790
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:03,410
Just the three of us. That's the way it's...

2791
02:25:03,410 --> 02:25:04,910
There's no point just the three of us.

2792
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:06,200
It's gotta be the Little Guy with us.

2793
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:08,830
No, I'm not sitting down with that little cocksucker again!

2794
02:25:08,830 --> 02:25:11,370
Do you understand? I can't do it, Frank!

2795
02:25:11,370 --> 02:25:11,910
You have to.

2796
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:13,410
No, Jimmy, you gotta sit down with him.

2797
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:14,660
- We don't gotta do anything. - Everybody says...

2798
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:16,870
This is a courtesy with these people.

2799
02:25:16,870 --> 02:25:18,080
A complete courtesy.

2800
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,330
- You know that. - I understand.

2801
02:25:19,330 --> 02:25:21,160
But you gotta try and move past that.

2802
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:22,790
Get past it? I am past it!

2803
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:25,070
I'm never seeing that motherfucker again.

2804
02:25:25,070 --> 02:25:26,370
- You see that's... - Jimmy, you gotta sit down.

2805
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:27,410
Everybody says so.

2806
02:25:27,410 --> 02:25:29,870
But there's no point. There's only one point,

2807
02:25:29,870 --> 02:25:31,990
I don't wanna do it and I'm not gonna do it.

2808
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,660
Frank, I'm gonna hang up on you now.

2809
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:35,830
Please. Understand this. Okay?

2810
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:52,330
- What did he say? - Uh, he's thinking about it.

2811
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:54,160
- Thinking about it? - Yeah.

2812
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:02,700
That's for you.

2813
02:26:10,830 --> 02:26:12,330
Well, that's good. Okay.

2814
02:26:25,580 --> 02:26:27,120
What time you got, Frank?

2815
02:26:28,250 --> 02:26:29,200
About five.

2816
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:30,370
Five, huh?

2817
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,700
Maybe you should give Jimmy a call.

2818
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,870
I mean, he said he was gonna think about it, right?

2819
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:43,870
Okay.

2820
02:26:55,290 --> 02:26:56,580
So when are you getting in?

2821
02:26:56,830 --> 02:26:57,950
Tomorrow morning.

2822
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:00,410
That's good. That's good, 'cause, uh...

2823
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,700
I changed my mind about the other thing.

2824
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:06,200
- You did? - Yeah.

2825
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:09,290
Yeah, I'm gonna meet, uh, with the Little Guy tomorrow afternoon.

2826
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:11,410
With the lit...

2827
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:13,370
- With the Little Guy? - Yeah.

2828
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:15,950
Tony Jack set it up. I like Jack.

2829
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:16,550
Jack's good.

2830
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:20,200
I met with him a few times after that, you know, Miami fiasco.

2831
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:22,000
With the Little Guy. Where?

2832
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:25,750
Same place as before. You know where it is.

2833
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:27,200
In public.

2834
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:31,000
You know Tony Jack is Pro's cousin?

2835
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:32,790
Yeah. So?

2836
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:34,870
They're all fucking cousins. What're you gonna do?

2837
02:27:35,410 --> 02:27:37,200
Jimmy, I think I should be there.

2838
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:38,700
Yeah, I want you there.

2839
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:40,540
That's why I asked when you're coming in.

2840
02:27:40,830 --> 02:27:42,040
What time's the meeting?

2841
02:27:42,410 --> 02:27:43,330
Two-thirty.

2842
02:27:43,330 --> 02:27:45,910
And he better not be late, that cocksucker,

2843
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:47,910
or wearing those fucking shorts.

2844
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:49,490
Listen, I'm gonna get there at 2:00,

2845
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:51,250
so you should get there at 2:00.

2846
02:27:51,450 --> 02:27:52,790
- Okay? - I'll be there at 2:00.

2847
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:55,080
Oh, good. Good. Okay.

2848
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:56,120
I'll see you at 2:00.

2849
02:27:56,370 --> 02:27:57,790
- Thanks, Frank. - Okay, Jimmy.

2850
02:27:59,410 --> 02:28:00,250
See you at 2:00.

2851
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:07,830
What did he say?

2852
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:09,790
He's gonna meet with Pro.

2853
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:13,580
Tony Jack set it up.

2854
02:28:14,290 --> 02:28:15,250
Very good.

2855
02:28:29,790 --> 02:28:32,750
- Hello. - Hello. Good evening.

2856
02:28:33,330 --> 02:28:35,660
- We're starving. - Oh, let's go, let's go.

2857
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,200
It was the best move we made,

2858
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:45,950
getting this red wine vinegar from Angelo's guy.

2859
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:51,950
Great Italian olive oil we got from that other mooch was not bad either.

2860
02:28:53,950 --> 02:28:56,290
Catania olives, what better.

2861
02:28:56,450 --> 02:28:57,330
The best.

2862
02:29:02,250 --> 02:29:03,950
There's been a change.

2863
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:08,280
Instead of, uh, going up early,

2864
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:11,120
we're gonna hang around tomorrow morning and then go drive up.

2865
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:15,750
But... But I told Jimmy that we were gonna be up in the morning.

2866
02:29:17,410 --> 02:29:18,410
I told Jimmy...

2867
02:29:18,410 --> 02:29:20,370
I told Jimmy we're gonna be up in the morning.

2868
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:22,000
I know. I know.

2869
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:28,120
That I would be there for that... meeting with Pro.

2870
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:29,410
- What? - That I'd be...

2871
02:29:29,410 --> 02:29:31,330
be there for that meeting with Pro.

2872
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:33,160
Oh, yeah. I know. I know.

2873
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:39,700
But what I... What am I gonna do?

2874
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:43,330
We gotta go there. I mean, I gotta go.

2875
02:29:43,330 --> 02:29:44,910
I told him I'd be there.

2876
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:49,500
Frank...

2877
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:52,500
we did all we could for the man.

2878
02:30:04,130 --> 02:30:05,330
Don't call him.

2879
02:30:42,290 --> 02:30:44,090
- Hey. Good morning. - Hey. Morning.

2880
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:48,230
Want some coffee?

2881
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:49,830
No, I got it here.

2882
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:54,180
- How'd ya sleep? - Good. You?

2883
02:30:55,410 --> 02:30:56,450
All right.

2884
02:31:00,450 --> 02:31:02,560
Want some Total or Corn Flakes?

2885
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:04,630
Maybe Total.

2886
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:14,230
That's good, thanks.

2887
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:23,440
We're gonna take a ride up to Port Clinton today.

2888
02:31:28,970 --> 02:31:30,430
I thought we were staying here.

2889
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:33,540
No, the girls are gonna stay here.

2890
02:31:34,270 --> 02:31:36,260
You and me, we're going up and, uh...

2891
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:40,320
we'll be back three hours tops.

2892
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:46,010
But... But what's in Port Clinton?

2893
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,510
A plane.

2894
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:52,640
A plane? To where?

2895
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:54,420
Detroit.

2896
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:03,630
We're going to Detroit now?

2897
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:06,800
No, you're gonna go to Detroit.

2898
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,720
And when you come back,

2899
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:14,020
me and you, we get together with the girls,

2900
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:16,100
we take a nice slow drive up.

2901
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:18,830
With cigarette breaks, you know.

2902
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:31,160
Frank.

2903
02:32:32,050 --> 02:32:34,450
I had to put you into this thing,

2904
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:36,980
or you would never let it happen.

2905
02:32:37,930 --> 02:32:39,480
And I know you wouldn't.

2906
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:46,730
But it's gonna happen.

2907
02:32:49,070 --> 02:32:52,270
Either way, he's going.

2908
02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:00,810
I know how you feel, Frank. Trust me.

2909
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:02,640
I know how you feel.

2910
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:06,780
I told you before, we tried everything to help him.

2911
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:07,930
You know that.

2912
02:33:07,930 --> 02:33:09,380
You tried.

2913
02:33:11,910 --> 02:33:13,980
He brought this on himself.

2914
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:17,830
And it's landing on us.

2915
02:33:21,550 --> 02:33:23,890
The only reason they agreed to this

2916
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:26,500
was out of respect to me.

2917
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:31,050
But you and Reenie will be okay,

2918
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:33,000
'cause you're with me.

2919
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:39,180
You're with me.

2920
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:20,120
Give me your glasses.

2921
02:38:47,230 --> 02:38:48,240
Hey, Frank.

2922
02:38:49,130 --> 02:38:50,070
Hey, Sal.

2923
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:53,950
Chuckie's late.

2924
02:39:47,860 --> 02:39:48,840
That him?

2925
02:39:53,610 --> 02:39:54,490
Yeah.

2926
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:58,270
Jesus.

2927
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:03,910
I'm Sally.

2928
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:05,240
Hi.

2929
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:09,010
- Chuck. - Frank.

2930
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:11,090
Let's go. I don't want your father yelling at me for being late.

2931
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:12,550
Frank, you take the front.

2932
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:15,770
- What the fuck is this? - What?

2933
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:17,310
It's wet.

2934
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:22,090
Yeah, I had a frozen fish I had to deliver for a friend of mine.

2935
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:23,870
A fish?

2936
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:25,270
The seat is wet from a fish?

2937
02:40:25,270 --> 02:40:26,890
Yeah, I know. What do you want me to do about it now?

2938
02:40:26,890 --> 02:40:28,130
- Jesus Christ. - I'll sit back there.

2939
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:29,460
No, no, no, it's all right. You sit in the front.

2940
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,710
I'll sit there.

2941
02:40:31,250 --> 02:40:32,600
I'll sit here, you take the front.

2942
02:40:32,610 --> 02:40:33,560
No, no.

2943
02:40:33,770 --> 02:40:35,150
I'll sit there.

2944
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:39,160
- I'm not sitting there. - Why don't you...

2945
02:40:39,160 --> 02:40:40,480
I'm sitting there.

2946
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:44,270
All right, sit where you want.

2947
02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:48,090
You want me to get you a newspaper, Frank?

2948
02:40:48,090 --> 02:40:49,930
It's okay. Let's go. We gotta hurry.

2949
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:05,260
What kind of fish?

2950
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:08,210
What?

2951
02:41:10,660 --> 02:41:12,100
What kind of fish?

2952
02:41:13,990 --> 02:41:17,170
I don't know. The kind you eat. A fish.

2953
02:41:18,020 --> 02:41:19,560
You don't know what kind?

2954
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:22,770
No. I don't.

2955
02:41:23,900 --> 02:41:25,010
Where did you get it?

2956
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:28,480
What the fuck. At a fish place.

2957
02:41:30,390 --> 02:41:34,000
What, you just go in there and say, "Gimme a fish"?

2958
02:41:34,930 --> 02:41:36,370
Pretty much. Yeah.

2959
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:39,460
You didn't say you want a salmon,

2960
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:41,330
you want a... haddock,

2961
02:41:41,330 --> 02:41:43,640
you want a... a fucking cod?

2962
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:46,890
What the fuck does it matter what kind of fish it was?

2963
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:48,650
Why are you so concerned about this fish?

2964
02:41:48,650 --> 02:41:50,130
I'm just trying to understand how...

2965
02:41:50,130 --> 02:41:50,900
Does it...

2966
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:56,500
...how a person can buy a fish and not know what kind it was.

2967
02:41:58,510 --> 02:42:01,250
There was a fish waiting for me there.

2968
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:07,550
I didn't ask what kind of fish it was. I'm sorry.

2969
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,320
- So your friend had already ordered this fish. - Right.

2970
02:42:20,140 --> 02:42:23,120
'Cause I wanna be able to explain this if somebody asks me.

2971
02:42:30,280 --> 02:42:31,510
Yeah. Absolutely.

2972
02:42:44,500 --> 02:42:45,420
Dad.

2973
02:42:47,210 --> 02:42:48,240
Chuckie.

2974
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:50,720
- Yeah, sorry I'm late. I had to drop off... - Late?

2975
02:42:50,870 --> 02:42:52,660
What the fuck are you even doing here?

2976
02:42:52,660 --> 02:42:54,640
- Who invited you? - Hey, Jimmy.

2977
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:58,740
Who the fuck are you?

2978
02:42:58,970 --> 02:43:00,110
I'm with Pro.

2979
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:01,700
You're with Pro?

2980
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:04,400
Are you with the cocksucker who just stood me up?

2981
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:06,560
I don't wait for anybody more than ten minutes.

2982
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,150
He's at the house.

2983
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,540
What house?

2984
02:43:09,540 --> 02:43:10,640
With Russ.

2985
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:14,450
- Russ? What the fuck is... - Hey, look who's here.

2986
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:16,210
- Frank. - Jimmy.

2987
02:43:16,290 --> 02:43:18,490
What the fuck is going on?

2988
02:43:18,710 --> 02:43:20,910
I was waiting for you. I was there at two o'clock.

2989
02:43:20,910 --> 02:43:21,950
You were supposed to show. What happened?

2990
02:43:21,950 --> 02:43:25,090
I'm sorry. But McGee's here, he decided to come.

2991
02:43:25,090 --> 02:43:27,530
But he ain't comfortable here. He don't wanna come here.

2992
02:43:27,530 --> 02:43:28,350
He's at the house.

2993
02:43:28,350 --> 02:43:31,010
- McGee's in Detroit? - Yeah, he's here.

2994
02:43:31,010 --> 02:43:32,370
He decided to come.

2995
02:43:34,690 --> 02:43:36,810
Yeah, he came to help straighten this all out.

2996
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:39,500
The house?

2997
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:47,080
We'll bring you back after to get your car.

2998
02:43:53,010 --> 02:43:53,880
Yeah.

2999
02:43:55,700 --> 02:43:56,640
Okay.

3000
02:44:01,730 --> 02:44:02,690
- Yeah. - Yeah.

3001
02:44:13,270 --> 02:44:14,170
There was a fish in here,

3002
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:16,620
but we cleaned it up.

3003
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:17,980
A fish?

3004
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:20,980
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.

3005
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:21,940
Didn't even know what kind.

3006
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:24,020
But it's okay now. I wiped it up.

3007
02:44:24,020 --> 02:44:26,830
- I got the handkerchief here. - Yeah, I can smell it.

3008
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:27,800
Hey, Chuckie.

3009
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:29,890
You had a fish in here in your car?

3010
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:31,470
For Bobby Holmes.

3011
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:33,310
You know, Bobby likes fish.

3012
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:35,050
We cleaned it up, Jimmy. It's all right.

3013
02:44:35,050 --> 02:44:36,240
You cleaned it up?

3014
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:38,400
- You cleaned it up? - Yeah.

3015
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:40,080
What the fuck you know about fish?

3016
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:42,880
You ever caught a fucking fish in your life?

3017
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:44,300
No.

3018
02:44:44,310 --> 02:44:46,420
Well, then you don't know. See?

3019
02:44:46,690 --> 02:44:47,250
Chuck.

3020
02:44:47,250 --> 02:44:50,220
Listen to me. Never put a fish in your car.

3021
02:44:50,220 --> 02:44:51,890
You never get the smell out.

3022
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:53,760
- No... - Unless you pack it tight, you know.

3023
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,150
No, I... I know.

3024
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:57,180
- You know? Remember that. - Right.

3025
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:57,980
I know.

3026
02:44:57,990 --> 02:44:59,660
It'll help you in life.

3027
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:07,530
Frank, you couldn't come by at 2:00 and tell me this?

3028
02:45:07,650 --> 02:45:10,640
I was waiting there 40 minutes like a fuckin' moron.

3029
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:13,180
Jimmy, I'm sorry. I came as soon as I got here.

3030
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:15,090
- You got in this morning. - No, no, no.

3031
02:45:15,090 --> 02:45:16,290
I got here this afternoon.

3032
02:45:16,290 --> 02:45:19,180
Russell had business in Port Clinton. I had to wait for him.

3033
02:45:19,180 --> 02:45:20,800
He reminded me. I forgot.

3034
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:22,940
So, we had to come and as soon as we got here,

3035
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:24,580
I came right here to see you.

3036
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:26,980
All due respect to Russ, you know,

3037
02:45:27,810 --> 02:45:30,730
but somebody should have come tell me, you know.

3038
02:45:30,730 --> 02:45:34,140
Just come tell me it's 2:30, 2:40, at the very least.

3039
02:45:34,150 --> 02:45:35,810
You're not incorrect. I mean...

3040
02:45:35,810 --> 02:45:39,930
Who the fuck is Pro? He sends a fucking errand boy here.

3041
02:45:39,930 --> 02:45:41,050
He ain't stayin'.

3042
02:45:41,060 --> 02:45:42,190
I know he ain't staying.

3043
02:45:42,190 --> 02:45:44,290
That's not the point, he's staying or not staying.

3044
02:45:44,290 --> 02:45:46,120
The point is Pro sent him.

3045
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:46,970
You know?

3046
02:45:46,970 --> 02:45:48,750
Point is, he should've come picked me up himself.

3047
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:50,350
That's the point I'm makin'.

3048
02:45:53,560 --> 02:45:55,710
Can you even see out of those glasses?

3049
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:58,650
I can't see a fucking thing.

3050
02:45:58,650 --> 02:46:01,390
That's good. I'm glad you're not driving, then.

3051
02:46:09,810 --> 02:46:11,390
Yeah, it's right... It's right up...

3052
02:46:11,890 --> 02:46:13,740
It's right up here. Right... Right up...

3053
02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:15,690
That building with the staircase.

3054
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:19,060
You got your friend with you?

3055
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:20,750
- Right here. - Good.

3056
02:46:21,430 --> 02:46:23,240
You never know with this cocksucker,

3057
02:46:23,380 --> 02:46:25,250
with or without Russ there.

3058
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:06,370
Let's get outta here, Frank. Come on.

3059
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:36,030
* Before the light *

3060
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:36,030
In The Still Of The Night - The Five Satins

3061
02:48:36,030 --> 02:48:38,100
* Hold me again *

3062
02:48:39,070 --> 02:48:41,180
* With all of your might *

3063
02:48:41,180 --> 02:48:45,050
* In the still of the night *

3064
02:48:45,050 --> 02:48:49,140
* In the still of the night *

3065
02:49:22,370 --> 02:49:28,830
* So before the light *

3066
02:49:28,830 --> 02:49:31,170
* Hold me again *

3067
02:49:31,950 --> 02:49:34,010
* With all of your might *

3068
02:49:34,010 --> 02:49:37,020
* In the still of the night *

3069
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:42,060
* In the still of the night *

3070
02:49:42,060 --> 02:49:44,660
James Hoffa, former president of the Teamsters Union,

3071
02:49:44,660 --> 02:49:46,010
disappeared on Wednesday.

3072
02:49:46,010 --> 02:49:49,320
And as of tonight, no trace of him has been found.

3073
02:49:49,320 --> 02:49:52,100
Hoffa spent four years in prison and made no bones

3074
02:49:52,100 --> 02:49:53,530
- about his intention... - Frank.

3075
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:55,750
...to get the presidency back from his successor,

3076
02:49:55,750 --> 02:49:57,000
Frank Fitzsimmons.

3077
02:49:57,010 --> 02:49:59,040
Fitzsimmons' son is the vice president of...

3078
02:49:59,050 --> 02:50:00,160
Still nothing?

3079
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:04,490
...young Fitzsimmons' car was bombed. He was not in it.

3080
02:50:04,490 --> 02:50:07,680
But there is bad blood in the Detroit Local.

3081
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:10,710
Hoffa disappeared Wednesday afternoon.

3082
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:14,170
Now, more than 48 hours later, with no word yet

3083
02:50:14,170 --> 02:50:18,170
on what happened to Hoffa, police are extremely concerned.

3084
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:20,470
Authorities are most anxious to find whom

3085
02:50:20,470 --> 02:50:23,710
Hoffa was supposed to meet outside the Red Fox restaurant

3086
02:50:23,710 --> 02:50:25,410
where he was last seen.

3087
02:50:25,930 --> 02:50:29,530
Police think it could have been a man named Anthony Giacalone,

3088
02:50:29,530 --> 02:50:32,190
described as a big man in the Detroit Mafia.

3089
02:50:32,190 --> 02:50:35,560
Hoffa's son, James, tried to contact Giacalone today,

3090
02:50:35,570 --> 02:50:36,740
but didn't succeed.

3091
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:39,040
Hoffa's family and friends stayed

3092
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:41,080
in the family home in Lake Orion today...

3093
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:42,710
I should call Jo.

3094
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:46,350
You haven't called Jo yet?

3095
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:54,280
Why?

3096
02:50:54,810 --> 02:50:55,700
What?

3097
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:57,810
Why?

3098
02:50:59,450 --> 02:51:00,420
Why what?

3099
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:03,960
Why haven't you called Jo?

3100
02:51:04,670 --> 02:51:08,120
Has anybody come forward with a ransom demand or anything like that?

3101
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:09,110
Not as of yet.

3102
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:11,840
Do you think the abduction was for ransom?

3103
02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:13,880
I'm gonna call her now.

3104
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:16,460
Do you think the abduction

3105
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:19,610
had anything to do with the recent conflicts

3106
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:21,580
within Local 299, his own Local?

3107
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:24,050
I think the union politics

3108
02:51:24,050 --> 02:51:25,970
is certainly something that has to be investigated.

3109
02:51:25,970 --> 02:51:28,510
One high official of the Teamsters International

3110
02:51:28,510 --> 02:51:30,300
says he fears the worst,

3111
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:32,490
that Hoffa may have been killed.

3112
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:34,940
Robert Hager, NBC News,

3113
02:51:34,940 --> 02:51:36,580
Bloomfield, Michigan.

3114
02:51:37,890 --> 02:51:39,820
At a truck stop outside Detroit,

3115
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:42,850
where Hoffa rose to the top in the Teamsters Union,

3116
02:51:42,850 --> 02:51:45,180
truck drivers had a variety of theories...

3117
02:51:45,180 --> 02:51:47,630
She stopped talking to me that day.

3118
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:51,060
August 3rd, 1975.

3119
02:51:52,470 --> 02:51:56,700
She's got a good job now and lives just outside Philly.

3120
02:51:57,780 --> 02:51:59,530
But my daughter...

3121
02:52:00,270 --> 02:52:01,230
Peggy...

3122
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:03,480
disappeared...

3123
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:06,510
from my life that day.

3124
02:52:10,340 --> 02:52:11,330
Hello.

3125
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,160
- Hello. - Hello?

3126
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:16,250
Jo.

3127
02:52:16,250 --> 02:52:17,220
Jo?

3128
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:19,520
It's... It's...

3129
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:22,580
- Frank. Frank? - Yeah. Yeah.

3130
02:52:23,130 --> 02:52:25,040
- Yeah... - I don't...

3131
02:52:25,910 --> 02:52:28,280
- Look, I... - Frank...

3132
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:31,140
Do you think... Do you think he's alive?

3133
02:52:34,070 --> 02:52:35,550
He's gotta be.

3134
02:52:36,660 --> 02:52:38,500
You know, you gotta think positively.

3135
02:52:38,510 --> 02:52:40,730
It's just, you know, it ain't that long. It's just...

3136
02:52:40,730 --> 02:52:41,610
But do you...

3137
02:52:42,430 --> 02:52:43,890
Do you know he's okay?

3138
02:52:43,890 --> 02:52:46,600
No, no, no, I mean, you know me, I...

3139
02:52:46,600 --> 02:52:49,390
He maybe did something like the Joe Bananas thing,

3140
02:52:49,390 --> 02:52:52,670
where, you know, he had himself kidnapped

3141
02:52:52,670 --> 02:52:55,890
and then came back, but he wasn't hurt, nothing happened.

3142
02:52:55,890 --> 02:52:57,770
Maybe he...

3143
02:52:58,030 --> 02:52:59,110
Maybe he just felt, you know,

3144
02:52:59,110 --> 02:53:00,970
he wanted to clear his head a bit.

3145
02:53:00,970 --> 02:53:03,200
But you gotta just think that it's gonna be...

3146
02:53:03,910 --> 02:53:05,700
It's gonna be okay.

3147
02:53:06,140 --> 02:53:07,510
It's gonna be okay.

3148
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:10,720
He's gonna be...

3149
02:53:12,380 --> 02:53:14,820
If you need anything, I'm here for you.

3150
02:53:14,820 --> 02:53:17,160
Anything. Anything.

3151
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:20,000
Can you just... Can you call me again?

3152
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,180
Yeah, I'll call... I'll call you.

3153
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:25,270
Yeah, I'll... I'll call you.

3154
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:28,420
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

3155
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:30,150
Yes, call me tomorrow.

3156
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:32,590
Okay. I'll call you in the morning, okay?

3157
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:33,610
Promise?

3158
02:53:33,610 --> 02:53:35,250
Don't worry. Be strong.

3159
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:37,280
Be positive, huh?

3160
02:53:37,790 --> 02:53:40,500
Okay, Jo, okay, okay.

3161
02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:42,160
Okay.

3162
02:53:42,410 --> 02:53:44,260
- Okay. - Talk to ya a little later. Bye.

3163
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:46,590
- Bye. - Goodbye, Frank.

3164
02:54:45,290 --> 02:54:48,010
It was no more complicated than that.

3165
02:54:50,060 --> 02:54:51,260
Mr. Sheeran,

3166
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:54,240
do you know who, if anyone,

3167
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:57,030
was behind the disappearance of James Hoffa?

3168
02:54:57,030 --> 02:55:00,620
Everybody who ever had anything to do with Jimmy

3169
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:02,500
was hauled in and questioned.

3170
02:55:02,500 --> 02:55:03,440
On the advice of counsel,

3171
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:05,610
I respectfully decline to answer that question

3172
02:55:05,610 --> 02:55:07,990
on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me.

3173
02:55:07,990 --> 02:55:09,240
Okay, let me ask you this:

3174
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:11,530
what color is my pen?

3175
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:15,360
And everybody took the Fifth.

3176
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:18,570
I mean, in that situation, that's what you do.

3177
02:55:18,570 --> 02:55:19,780
What else are you gonna do?

3178
02:55:19,950 --> 02:55:24,530
Still, everybody got indicted or convicted on one thing or another,

3179
02:55:24,530 --> 02:55:25,820
but not that.

3180
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:27,030
Not about Jimmy.

3181
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:30,190
Nobody, as you know, even went to jail for that.

3182
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:32,280
And nobody talked, which is unusual,

3183
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:34,940
'cause usually, three people can keep a secret

3184
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:36,740
only when two of them are dead.

3185
02:55:38,820 --> 02:55:41,400
Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi,

3186
02:55:41,400 --> 02:55:45,240
they got 20 years each for shaking down a trucking company.

3187
02:55:45,990 --> 02:55:47,570
Pro was convicted with them,

3188
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:49,240
but he was already back in school

3189
02:55:49,240 --> 02:55:51,740
for that other matter I talked about before.

3190
02:55:51,820 --> 02:55:53,650
Well, you remember that poor union treasurer,

3191
02:55:53,650 --> 02:55:56,610
Tony "Three Fingers," who got more votes than Pro?

3192
02:55:56,610 --> 02:55:57,820
They got him on that.

3193
02:55:58,110 --> 02:56:01,450
Sally Bugs, you know, he did that one.

3194
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:11,320
One day, Bugs was seen walking into the Federal building.

3195
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:14,400
What he did itself ain't no crime.

3196
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:16,910
I mean, a lot of people get called in for things.

3197
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:19,070
But Sally knows better.

3198
02:56:19,610 --> 02:56:21,820
How come he didn't say anything to anybody?

3199
02:56:23,150 --> 02:56:24,990
He didn't tell anybody one word.

3200
02:56:25,610 --> 02:56:26,950
Not one word.

3201
02:56:28,030 --> 02:56:29,700
And one thing for sure,

3202
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:32,780
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

3203
02:56:46,030 --> 02:56:46,820
Sally.

3204
02:56:47,820 --> 02:56:49,570
- What's good? - Hey, Irish.

3205
02:57:02,030 --> 02:57:03,820
Turns out Sally did tell somebody

3206
02:57:03,820 --> 02:57:05,610
he had to go in there for something.

3207
02:57:05,610 --> 02:57:07,190
They just forgot to tell somebody else.

3208
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:09,360
So it was a bad hit.

3209
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:14,530
Jimmy's son, Chuckie, you know, his foster son,

3210
02:57:14,530 --> 02:57:16,030
was in the thing, too,

3211
02:57:16,030 --> 02:57:17,740
but he didn't know it.

3212
02:57:18,490 --> 02:57:20,610
All Chuckie knew was he was pickin' up

3213
02:57:20,610 --> 02:57:22,360
one of Pro's guys and me,

3214
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:24,490
and we was all gonna pick up his dad

3215
02:57:24,490 --> 02:57:26,320
at the Red Fox for a meeting.

3216
02:57:27,110 --> 02:57:28,570
Well, I mean, he was in it, yeah,

3217
02:57:28,570 --> 02:57:30,860
you could say that, but stupidly.

3218
02:57:31,570 --> 02:57:34,400
I... I always felt sorry for Chuckie in this whole thing.

3219
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:36,110
And I... I still do.

3220
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:37,860
And the Feds gave him ten months

3221
02:57:37,860 --> 02:57:40,530
for some bullshit thing about a car, and that's about it.

3222
02:57:40,530 --> 02:57:41,820
Who knows what the fuck...

3223
02:57:43,900 --> 02:57:47,200
Fat Tony Salerno, they got on an income tax thing.

3224
02:57:48,110 --> 02:57:49,070
A little while after,

3225
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:51,740
he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

3226
02:57:55,490 --> 02:57:58,160
There's a... a pork store up in...

3227
02:58:00,700 --> 02:58:02,530
northern California.

3228
02:58:03,950 --> 02:58:04,780
Right around...

3229
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:07,320
Walnut Creek.

3230
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:08,820
You're from up there, ain't you?

3231
02:58:09,280 --> 02:58:10,740
- Yeah. - Yeah.

3232
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:12,990
And you might even know the guy that runs it.

3233
02:58:13,650 --> 02:58:15,910
Actually, I'm looking for a little favor...

3234
02:58:16,320 --> 02:58:17,950
for him, not for me.

3235
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:22,780
But if you can get him a ticket, like, to Australia...

3236
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:25,450
You know what I mean.

3237
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:29,030
Yeah.

3238
02:58:30,820 --> 02:58:32,660
You want to help him get down there?

3239
02:58:38,400 --> 02:58:39,360
Ye... Yeah.

3240
02:58:39,610 --> 02:58:41,400
Now, Russell, he got pinched

3241
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:44,030
for telling Jimmy the Weasel to strangle Jack Napoli

3242
02:58:44,030 --> 02:58:46,820
over some beef about 25 grand of jewelry

3243
02:58:46,820 --> 02:58:49,360
that Jack took on credit from Russell

3244
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:51,110
and then he never paid for.

3245
02:58:51,530 --> 02:58:53,820
Now, with Russ, you don't do that.

3246
02:58:54,950 --> 02:58:58,160
So, only thing is, the Weasel, he flipped.

3247
02:58:58,240 --> 02:58:59,610
He had a wire on him.

3248
02:59:00,110 --> 02:59:02,700
They called it "conspiracy to kill a witness."

3249
02:59:02,740 --> 02:59:04,030
It was obvious to everybody else

3250
02:59:04,030 --> 02:59:05,860
that Napoli was clearly in the wrong.

3251
02:59:05,860 --> 02:59:08,070
I mean, how could you not see that?

3252
02:59:08,070 --> 02:59:09,940
He set him up. It was entrapment.

3253
02:59:09,950 --> 02:59:11,320
What else could you call it?

3254
02:59:11,530 --> 02:59:14,860
But that's another thing I don't wanna get into now.

3255
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:16,610
Raise your right hand.

3256
02:59:16,610 --> 02:59:19,990
They brought me up on bribery and labor racketeering charges

3257
02:59:19,990 --> 02:59:22,200
and some other bullshit things I don't know.

3258
02:59:22,450 --> 02:59:24,280
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

3259
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:25,860
- so help you God? - I do.

3260
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:27,990
Did you also tell them that Mr. Boffa

3261
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:30,110
had given you and your wife luxury vehicles?

3262
02:59:30,110 --> 02:59:33,360
Mr. Cole, I worked for 44 years,

3263
02:59:33,360 --> 02:59:37,820
I never took one dime illegal off Boffa or nobody else.

3264
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:40,280
You can think whatever you wanna think. Don't matter to me.

3265
02:59:40,280 --> 02:59:43,360
But all they got me for was blowing up a crane company

3266
02:59:43,360 --> 02:59:45,440
that fired two of my shop stewards

3267
02:59:45,450 --> 02:59:46,820
for no good reason.

3268
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:51,030
And... And my Lincoln.

3269
02:59:51,570 --> 02:59:54,280
I mean, I bought that car from Eugene Boffa.

3270
02:59:55,070 --> 02:59:57,650
He leased truck drivers to freight companies,

3271
02:59:57,650 --> 03:00:00,360
and then he paid them substandard wages.

3272
03:00:02,450 --> 03:00:04,690
They said I paid a lot less for the car

3273
03:00:04,700 --> 03:00:06,280
than what it was worth.

3274
03:00:06,780 --> 03:00:08,860
They said the car was a bribe.

3275
03:00:14,900 --> 03:00:16,820
I... I... I loved that car.

3276
03:00:17,570 --> 03:00:21,110
But it wasn't worth the 18 years they gave me for it.

3277
03:00:21,570 --> 03:00:22,610
That's for sure.

3278
03:00:27,490 --> 03:00:29,740
Russell, he had a stroke.

3279
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:33,450
Fat Tony, he couldn't control his urine no more.

3280
03:00:33,490 --> 03:00:38,110
And my arthritis that started in the foxholes of Anzio

3281
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:40,740
was eatin' away at my lower back now,

3282
03:00:40,740 --> 03:00:43,360
and I couldn't feel much in my feet no more.

3283
03:00:43,780 --> 03:00:44,900
I needed a cane.

3284
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:47,860
But, you know, they're not gonna give you a cane in the can

3285
03:00:47,860 --> 03:00:50,450
because they say you're gonna use it as a weapon.

3286
03:00:50,780 --> 03:00:52,530
There was this medicine, Neurontin,

3287
03:00:52,530 --> 03:00:53,690
it helped me a little bit,

3288
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:55,820
but it also made you loopy.

3289
03:00:55,820 --> 03:00:56,610
He's got it!

3290
03:00:57,400 --> 03:00:58,240
He's got it!

3291
03:00:59,990 --> 03:01:01,320
We were all falling apart right there

3292
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:02,990
in the freezing fucking cold.

3293
03:01:02,990 --> 03:01:04,860
I can see it from here. You getting scared now?

3294
03:01:04,860 --> 03:01:06,780
Yeah, you stay here another fucking ten years,

3295
03:01:06,780 --> 03:01:07,910
you'll beat me.

3296
03:01:17,110 --> 03:01:18,990
Is this the good grape juice?

3297
03:01:31,740 --> 03:01:32,820
I can't eat it.

3298
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:35,320
- Take a bite. - I got no teeth. I can't.

3299
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:36,660
Put a little piece.

3300
03:01:37,110 --> 03:01:38,530
Just a little piece, thank you.

3301
03:01:38,530 --> 03:01:39,530
That's it?

3302
03:01:53,070 --> 03:01:54,820
- E buono, no? - Buono.

3303
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:56,320
Buono.

3304
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:02,700
Jimmy was a good man.

3305
03:02:03,400 --> 03:02:05,780
You know? He had a nice family too, huh?

3306
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:10,570
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

3307
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:14,700
I never wanted it to go that far.

3308
03:02:23,860 --> 03:02:26,410
I picked us over him.

3309
03:02:27,530 --> 03:02:28,320
Fuck 'em.

3310
03:02:29,740 --> 03:02:30,530
Fuck 'em.

3311
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:33,660
Fuck 'em.

3312
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:43,700
Mangia che cresci... figlio mio, mangia.

3313
03:02:58,530 --> 03:02:59,280
Hey, Russ.

3314
03:02:59,820 --> 03:03:01,110
Hey, Frankie.

3315
03:03:01,110 --> 03:03:02,940
- Where you goin'? - What?

3316
03:03:02,950 --> 03:03:05,530
- Where you goin'? - I'm going to church.

3317
03:03:05,990 --> 03:03:06,820
Church?

3318
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:09,070
Don't laugh, you'll see.

3319
03:03:09,110 --> 03:03:10,360
Don't laugh.

3320
03:03:10,820 --> 03:03:12,030
You'll see.

3321
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:21,700
Russell went to church.

3322
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:26,950
Then he went to the prison hospital.

3323
03:03:29,240 --> 03:03:32,570
And... And then he went to the graveyard.

3324
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:37,540
Lord Jesus Christ...

3325
03:03:38,530 --> 03:03:40,360
I got out that October.

3326
03:03:40,450 --> 03:03:42,700
Reenie died in December.

3327
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:45,660
On December 23rd, to be exact.

3328
03:03:46,030 --> 03:03:47,200
Lung cancer.

3329
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:48,860
No surprise.

3330
03:03:49,860 --> 03:03:52,610
...even as it claims our mortal bodies.

3331
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:55,900
Grant that our sister may sleep here in peace,

3332
03:03:55,900 --> 03:03:58,320
until you awaken her to glory.

3333
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:01,530
For you are the resurrection and the life.

3334
03:04:01,650 --> 03:04:04,240
And then she will see you face to face,

3335
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:06,570
and in your light will see light,

3336
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:11,110
and know the splendor of God for ever and ever.

3337
03:04:11,360 --> 03:04:12,280
Amen.

3338
03:04:45,360 --> 03:04:50,200
...six points shy of his career average of .296

3339
03:04:50,360 --> 03:04:51,740
coming into this season.

3340
03:04:51,990 --> 03:04:54,780
Top four batters in this lineup for Philadelphia

3341
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:57,030
today are all switch hitters.

3342
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:53,490
Much to the frustration of some policy makers,

3343
03:05:53,490 --> 03:05:56,320
NATO military leaders will not risk

3344
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:59,990
low flying attacks on Serb troops in Kosovo.

3345
03:06:01,150 --> 03:06:04,440
It could take days more of systematic bombing,

3346
03:06:04,450 --> 03:06:05,780
especially since the Serbs

3347
03:06:05,780 --> 03:06:08,940
have hidden so many of their anti-aircraft missiles,

3348
03:06:08,950 --> 03:06:11,990
in essence, daring NATO to fly low.

3349
03:06:34,820 --> 03:06:37,070
You go... you go there. Yeah, yeah.

3350
03:06:37,570 --> 03:06:38,490
Yeah, yeah.

3351
03:06:47,990 --> 03:06:48,910
Peggy.

3352
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:51,910
Peggy. I just want to talk.

3353
03:07:13,450 --> 03:07:15,200
I just, you know... I...

3354
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:16,860
She walked away.

3355
03:07:17,950 --> 03:07:20,650
I know she's mad at me and all, but I... I want...

3356
03:07:20,650 --> 03:07:23,490
Call her. Call her. I just want to talk to her.

3357
03:07:24,860 --> 03:07:26,820
Talk to her and tell her what?

3358
03:07:27,030 --> 03:07:27,820
What...

3359
03:07:28,490 --> 03:07:30,660
I just want to say I'm sorry. That's all.

3360
03:07:32,150 --> 03:07:33,160
For?

3361
03:07:35,650 --> 03:07:36,410
Look...

3362
03:07:37,860 --> 03:07:40,990
I know I wasn't a... a good dad. I know that.

3363
03:07:40,990 --> 03:07:43,570
I know that. I was just trying to protect her.

3364
03:07:43,700 --> 03:07:44,820
Protect all of youse.

3365
03:07:44,820 --> 03:07:47,360
I mean, that's what I was doing. That's...

3366
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:49,360
From what?

3367
03:07:50,610 --> 03:07:51,570
Well, everything.

3368
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:52,950
I mean...

3369
03:07:53,570 --> 03:07:57,070
You... Youse had a sheltered life, in a way,

3370
03:07:57,240 --> 03:07:59,110
because you didn't see what I see

3371
03:07:59,110 --> 03:08:00,450
and what I've been through.

3372
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:04,950
There's a lot of bad people out there.

3373
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:06,530
What else am I gonna do?

3374
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:10,410
Daddy, you have no idea what it was like for us.

3375
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:13,360
I mean, we couldn't go to you with a problem

3376
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:14,940
'cause of what you would do.

3377
03:08:14,950 --> 03:08:17,360
You know, we couldn't come to you for protection

3378
03:08:17,360 --> 03:08:19,910
because of the terrible things that you would do.

3379
03:08:22,570 --> 03:08:23,570
I was just... I was...

3380
03:08:23,570 --> 03:08:26,110
I didn't want to see youse get hurt, that's all.

3381
03:08:31,200 --> 03:08:33,820
I know you read a lot of things about me, heard about me.

3382
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:35,200
I'm sorry.

3383
03:08:35,860 --> 03:08:36,700
I...

3384
03:08:38,950 --> 03:08:42,240
Can I do anything now to make it up to you?

3385
03:08:53,860 --> 03:08:56,280
If you're looking for something with a little bit more luxury,

3386
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:58,280
we have these two models over here.

3387
03:08:58,490 --> 03:09:00,910
They're like the Cadillacs of caskets.

3388
03:09:01,150 --> 03:09:02,780
Now, if we puttin' you in the fuckin' oven,

3389
03:09:02,780 --> 03:09:04,740
it really doesn't matter what you go in.

3390
03:09:05,070 --> 03:09:06,650
The cheapest shit possible.

3391
03:09:06,650 --> 03:09:08,610
Particle board, that's it.

3392
03:09:08,610 --> 03:09:11,240
What are we doin' today? Are we doin' a cremation?

3393
03:09:11,780 --> 03:09:13,950
- A burial. - Burial?

3394
03:09:14,450 --> 03:09:16,070
Is it for a man or for a woman?

3395
03:09:16,110 --> 03:09:16,990
Me.

3396
03:09:18,150 --> 03:09:19,030
Shit.

3397
03:09:23,650 --> 03:09:24,950
You see anything you like?

3398
03:09:36,360 --> 03:09:38,490
- That green one. - That's a beauty.

3399
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:40,740
That one'll set you back about $7,500

3400
03:09:40,740 --> 03:09:42,200
if you take it home today.

3401
03:09:43,070 --> 03:09:43,990
What do you think?

3402
03:09:45,570 --> 03:09:46,700
Can you do any better?

3403
03:09:47,650 --> 03:09:51,820
I mean, buddy, this is what you want to go home in, no?

3404
03:09:53,950 --> 03:09:56,660
I think we could go six on that for you. How about that?

3405
03:09:57,150 --> 03:09:59,780
- Six flat cash work for you? - That's good.

3406
03:10:00,650 --> 03:10:01,570
Good for me.

3407
03:10:21,650 --> 03:10:22,990
Sooner or later,

3408
03:10:23,400 --> 03:10:26,490
everybody put here has a date when he's gonna go.

3409
03:10:26,490 --> 03:10:28,110
That's just the way it is.

3410
03:10:29,240 --> 03:10:33,200
And I think there's gotta be something when you go

3411
03:10:33,860 --> 03:10:38,160
'cause, I mean, how the hell did this whole thing start?

3412
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:44,690
People smarter than me can't figure it out.

3413
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:46,530
That's why I would never go for cremation

3414
03:10:46,530 --> 03:10:48,860
because it's so... it's so final.

3415
03:10:50,780 --> 03:10:51,910
This... This one.

3416
03:10:53,700 --> 03:10:55,450
1948.

3417
03:10:56,280 --> 03:10:59,320
That's the hardest part of anybody when they bury youse,

3418
03:10:59,320 --> 03:11:00,990
is when they go into the ground

3419
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:03,530
because it's... it's so final.

3420
03:11:04,820 --> 03:11:07,240
If you go into a building, the building's there.

3421
03:11:07,280 --> 03:11:08,660
The crypt is there.

3422
03:11:08,780 --> 03:11:10,400
It has to be a metal casket,

3423
03:11:10,400 --> 03:11:12,240
and they have you in the room.

3424
03:11:12,610 --> 03:11:13,820
And all that there.

3425
03:11:14,070 --> 03:11:15,360
It's just not as final.

3426
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:18,320
You're dead, but it ain't that final.

3427
03:11:21,490 --> 03:11:25,740
I'm sorry, but I gotta direct youse to my attorney,

3428
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:26,990
Mr. Ragano...

3429
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:31,570
if youse want to talk about Mr. Hoffa or...

3430
03:11:31,950 --> 03:11:33,740
or any matter, for that matter.

3431
03:11:34,030 --> 03:11:35,860
I got noth... nothing new to say.

3432
03:11:36,990 --> 03:11:38,070
He's dead.

3433
03:11:38,990 --> 03:11:39,990
Who's dead?

3434
03:11:40,650 --> 03:11:42,190
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.

3435
03:11:42,200 --> 03:11:43,070
- He's dead? - Yeah.

3436
03:11:43,070 --> 03:11:44,070
Who did it?

3437
03:11:45,990 --> 03:11:46,990
Cancer.

3438
03:11:49,780 --> 03:11:51,660
Everybody's dead, Mr. Sheeran.

3439
03:11:53,490 --> 03:11:54,610
It's over.

3440
03:11:55,150 --> 03:11:56,280
They're all gone.

3441
03:11:56,570 --> 03:11:58,660
Russell, Angelo, Salerno,

3442
03:11:58,900 --> 03:12:01,240
Pro, Dorfman, Sally Bugs.

3443
03:12:01,240 --> 03:12:02,360
They're gone.

3444
03:12:04,030 --> 03:12:05,240
Who are you protecting?

3445
03:12:07,490 --> 03:12:08,780
You know who's not gone?

3446
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:12,820
Mr. Hoffa's family. His children.

3447
03:12:13,280 --> 03:12:16,700
They're here. And they gotta live not knowing.

3448
03:12:17,740 --> 03:12:18,820
That's hard to do.

3449
03:12:21,860 --> 03:12:23,490
I mean, you got kids, Frank.

3450
03:12:24,150 --> 03:12:25,280
Can you imagine?

3451
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:34,200
Frank, it's time. It's time you say what happened.

3452
03:12:40,900 --> 03:12:42,950
You seem like nice fellas.

3453
03:12:43,780 --> 03:12:45,860
I appreciate youse coming to see me.

3454
03:12:46,650 --> 03:12:48,570
But I... I can't help you.

3455
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:53,110
That's it?

3456
03:12:53,150 --> 03:12:54,030
That's it.

3457
03:13:01,070 --> 03:13:03,690
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

3458
03:13:03,700 --> 03:13:05,030
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

3459
03:13:05,030 --> 03:13:07,650
- Pray for us sinners... - Pray for us sinners...

3460
03:13:07,650 --> 03:13:11,200
- Now and at the hour of our death. - Now and at the hour of our death.

3461
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:12,910
- Amen. - Amen.

3462
03:13:15,740 --> 03:13:16,740
That was...

3463
03:13:17,450 --> 03:13:18,990
That wasn't too bad.

3464
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:20,610
It's been a while.

3465
03:13:21,110 --> 03:13:22,190
Not bad at all.

3466
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:24,610
And the intention was there. The intention.

3467
03:13:24,610 --> 03:13:25,490
I know.

3468
03:13:26,400 --> 03:13:28,240
I know the intention is there.

3469
03:13:28,360 --> 03:13:29,740
It was there, Father.

3470
03:13:31,400 --> 03:13:33,110
Do you feel anything for...

3471
03:13:33,530 --> 03:13:35,910
for what you've done?

3472
03:13:39,280 --> 03:13:42,660
I, I don't. I mean, maybe that...

3473
03:13:43,650 --> 03:13:45,570
Because I'm here now talking to you,

3474
03:13:45,570 --> 03:13:47,610
that in itself is,

3475
03:13:47,610 --> 03:13:51,030
you know, an attempt to...

3476
03:13:54,570 --> 03:13:57,820
But you don't feel anything at all?

3477
03:13:59,490 --> 03:14:00,320
No.

3478
03:14:03,070 --> 03:14:04,820
Water under the dam.

3479
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:13,320
Any... Any remorse for the families?

3480
03:14:13,530 --> 03:14:16,110
I... I didn't know the families.

3481
03:14:18,950 --> 03:14:21,070
I didn't know 'em. Except one I knew.

3482
03:14:26,780 --> 03:14:29,740
I think we can... we can be sorry...

3483
03:14:29,820 --> 03:14:33,360
We can be sorry even when we don't feel sorry.

3484
03:14:33,400 --> 03:14:36,400
Well, for us to say, to make a decision of the will...

3485
03:14:36,400 --> 03:14:37,360
"God...

3486
03:14:38,070 --> 03:14:39,820
I am sorry, God.

3487
03:14:41,450 --> 03:14:42,700
Forgive me."

3488
03:14:43,610 --> 03:14:46,570
And that... that's a decision of the will.

3489
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:55,490
What kind of man

3490
03:14:57,400 --> 03:15:00,110
makes a... a phone call like that?

3491
03:15:05,700 --> 03:15:07,940
What do you mean? What phone call?

3492
03:15:07,950 --> 03:15:10,320
Well, I can't tell you.

3493
03:15:12,610 --> 03:15:13,910
I can't. I got...

3494
03:15:15,070 --> 03:15:16,110
That's okay.

3495
03:15:19,700 --> 03:15:21,610
Frank, do you wanna pray with me again?

3496
03:15:21,610 --> 03:15:22,530
Yeah.

3497
03:15:23,530 --> 03:15:25,490
This time, we'll do it in our own words. Okay?

3498
03:15:25,490 --> 03:15:26,320
Okay.

3499
03:15:28,650 --> 03:15:30,820
God, we come before you

3500
03:15:31,360 --> 03:15:33,700
sinful and sorrowful.

3501
03:15:33,950 --> 03:15:36,240
Sinful and sorrowful.

3502
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:41,280
We know you are all good and all merciful.

3503
03:15:41,450 --> 03:15:44,860
We know you are all good and all merciful.

3504
03:15:45,950 --> 03:15:49,030
- We ask you... - We ask you...

3505
03:15:49,030 --> 03:15:51,240
to help us see ourselves...

3506
03:15:51,240 --> 03:15:54,240
to help us see ourselves...

3507
03:15:54,240 --> 03:15:57,490
- as you see us. - as you see us.

3508
03:15:59,900 --> 03:16:01,490
That's my daughter, Peggy.

3509
03:16:01,900 --> 03:16:03,240
- Is it? - Yeah.

3510
03:16:03,450 --> 03:16:04,780
I don't think I've met her yet.

3511
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:07,910
Well, she... she ain't been around too much.

3512
03:16:08,110 --> 03:16:09,740
Is she your only child?

3513
03:16:09,740 --> 03:16:11,950
No, I got four daughters.

3514
03:16:12,070 --> 03:16:13,860
Over there. See?

3515
03:16:13,860 --> 03:16:15,070
Beautiful.

3516
03:16:15,570 --> 03:16:17,110
- Busy man. - Yeah.

3517
03:16:19,150 --> 03:16:20,160
Yeah.

3518
03:16:21,280 --> 03:16:22,410
Who's that with her?

3519
03:16:24,030 --> 03:16:25,240
You don't know who that is?

3520
03:16:27,490 --> 03:16:28,570
No.

3521
03:16:29,490 --> 03:16:30,660
Jimmy Hoffa.

3522
03:16:32,820 --> 03:16:33,570
Oh, yeah.

3523
03:16:33,570 --> 03:16:35,240
Yeah, right, "Oh, yeah."

3524
03:16:37,070 --> 03:16:38,360
You don't know who he is.

3525
03:16:38,650 --> 03:16:39,860
Okay, I don't.

3526
03:16:41,110 --> 03:16:44,150
Yeah. Boy, you don't know how fast time goes by

3527
03:16:44,150 --> 03:16:45,860
until you get there.

3528
03:16:46,450 --> 03:16:48,150
But you don't have to worry about that

3529
03:16:48,150 --> 03:16:50,820
because you have your whole life ahead of you.

3530
03:16:50,950 --> 03:16:53,160
Forever. It goes fast, time...

3531
03:16:53,780 --> 03:16:54,570
I'm tellin' ya.

3532
03:16:54,990 --> 03:16:56,740
I'm trying to take your pulse, Mr. Sheeran.

3533
03:16:56,740 --> 03:16:58,570
Please, please don't talk.

3534
03:17:00,360 --> 03:17:01,570
It's great today.

3535
03:17:02,240 --> 03:17:03,240
I'm still alive?

3536
03:17:03,450 --> 03:17:06,160
- Yes, you are. - That's good to know.

3537
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:07,410
Alive and well.

3538
03:17:07,700 --> 03:17:08,860
And you're free

In the name of the Father, and of the Son,

Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.

3547

- His mercy endures forever. - endures forever.

3549

All right, Frank. I'll be back to visit, okay? Very soon.

Almost.

3555
03:18:06,570 --> 03:18:07,910
Well, I ain't going nowhere.

3556
03:18:10,900 --> 03:18:12,570
- Father? - Yup?

3557
03:18:13,570 --> 03:18:14,780
Do me a favor?
