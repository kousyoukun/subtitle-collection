00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:45,421
THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE

2
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:49,522
We apologize for this interruption...

3
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:52,525
Is the movie over?

4
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,694
Don't you want to tell grandma?

5
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,946
Is the movie over?

6
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:14,255
We now continue with
a musical interlude.

7
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,917
In this 17th stage
of the Tour de France

8
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:54,380
the pack, the machine of muscles
and steel, finally gets going.

9
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:59,301
But before the rubber tests the
overheated paving-stones of Marseille,

10
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:04,682
these young lads still have
many obstacles to face.

11
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:27,288
And a fantastic escape
by the yellow jersey,

12
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:31,625
who devours Klaut and Glutman
of the canned food factory from Frankfurt.

13
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,628
They'll have a hard time
catching up

14
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:39,050
on the spot where they already
failed miserably last year,

15
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:43,554
When they really had
to bite the bullet.

16
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:46,390
How admirable this fierce
endurance is

17
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:49,393
On the face of this great eagle.

18
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:03,569
The very top lies at
an altitude of 1912 metres,

19
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:06,655
the horrible Ventoux,
an impressive scenery

20
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:10,284
of white desert,
under a burning sun.

21
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,203
They climb standing on the pedals,

22
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:15,164
Constantly watching their gear ratio,
It is hell.

23
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,958
But before they reach the finish,

24
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,879
they work themselves into a sweat,

25
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,924
and leave behind that musky smell,

26
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,301
That supporters know so well.

27
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:37,311
The pack sink into oblivion.

28
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:41,065
For some the bell already sounds
And they give up.

29
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,027
Those who can not really pound the pedals,

30
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:48,864
lose pace, fall behind,

31
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:51,867
vanish into nothingness.

32
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:29,947
Together with a dazzling speed
comes the liberating descent

33
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:31,949
to Marseille.

34
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,669
Keep going, my DOV!

35
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:10,649
Insurance company "The Pigeon"
gives away a whole week's free insurance

36
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,860
for the best sprinter.

37
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:16,364
Yes, that's right, for free,
for his bicycle.

38
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,899
My box! That's my box!
Give me back my box!

39
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,400
Is that your dog?

40
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:34,403
I don't believe it! The nerve!

41
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:37,281
She now has my box and the dog!

42
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,868
Here, stuff this!

43
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:37,316
Dried tadpoles

44
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:41,490
Get out.

45
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,589
And now: The triplets of Belleville.

46
00:57:51,222 --> 00:57:53,265
Another racer's grave discovered.
Third in two months' time

47
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,937
Sinister details

48
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:01,732
Investigation got stuck

49
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,693
French Mafia denies everything!

50
01:14:57,832 --> 01:15:01,627
BELLEVILLE
Thank you for your visit - Goodbye

51
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:14,974
Is the movie over?

52
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:18,602
Don't you want to tell grandma?
Is the movie over?

53
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:29,280
It's finished, grandma.

54
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:35,286
For my parents.

55
01:15:35,594 --> 01:15:43,594
