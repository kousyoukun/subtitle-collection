1
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,125
Are you wasting my time,
Bourdette?

2
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,292
Are you wasting my time?

3
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,125
If they find out
I'm talking to you, they'll

4
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,000
they'll kill me.

5
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,125
Tell me how it works.

6
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:51,292
No, this is...

7
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,458
- this is wrong. This is insane.
- Whoa, whoa.

8
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,167
You're doing the right thing

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,917
the brave thing.
Please sit down.

10
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,250
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

11
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,583
Stop!

12
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,958
Thank you.

13
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,208
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

14
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,083
So where are we five years from now?

15
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,708
Right here at the Lafitte Hotel except
we have a babysitter at home.

16
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,250
I like that.

17
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,458
- Me too.
- A babysitter

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,292
blond, about 19 Swedish

19
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,292
and he's very handsome.

20
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,125
Don't fuck with me.

21
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,125
Plunge to his death today off the roof
of a parking structure on Burgundy Street.

22
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,083
- We're going live to the scene.
- It's where I parked my car.

23
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,125
Joining me is Lieutenant Durgan
with the NOPD.

24
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,208
You think we have a murder victim here?

25
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,417
I'm not gonna comment at this time
but I will tell you that NOPD

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,125
is gonna do everything in its power

27
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:36,250
- to get to the bottom of this.
- Yeah, right, another unsolved case.

28
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,458
- I know what's happening.
- It's New Orleans.

29
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,333
- The city's going in hell.
- Oh, come on, we love New Orleans.

30
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:42,875
Who dat?

31
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:46,667
Well, the city may be going to hell
but we are going dancing.

32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,250
That's right.

33
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,208
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,583
How did you two meet?

35
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:15,167
I'll bet it was really juicy and romantic.

36
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,458
- No, not really.
- I thought it was.

37
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:19,458
Well...

38
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,917
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop. It's a "well"?

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,083
I know it's a "well".

40
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,125
Oh, he was sitting with all these kids
like, 14-15 year olds.

41
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,792
Their first time at Symphony
you could tell.

42
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,292
- And they were actually listening.
- One or two of them.

43
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,083
You know I just thought it was incredible
what he was doing for those kids.

44
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,167
Bullshit! Those, no, listen,
those kids were juvenile delinquents.

45
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,958
They were supposed to be in detention

46
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,625
and Will was supposed
to supervise but instead

47
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,167
this son of a bitch uses his own
hard-earned cash

48
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,542
to take them to a concert.

49
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,000
- They are my students.
- Of course, you do.

50
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,125
Some bad ass kids.

51
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,292
Oh, it's not "Ow!". It's Aaaw!

52
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,125
- What? ...What?
- Close your eyes.

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,625
Where are you going?

54
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't look at me.

55
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,000
- Come back.
- Close your eyes.

56
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,083
Close your eyes.
Tight.

57
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,583
Okay.

58
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,958
Put out your hands.

59
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,667
What are you going to do?

60
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,667
Unspeakable things.

61
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,667
Happy anniversary.

62
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,625
Oh...

63
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,708
It's beautiful.

64
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,458
I didn't think
you've gotten me anything.

65
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,958
Of course, I got you something.

66
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,917
They're little rubies.

67
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,542
Thank you.

68
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,333
I love you.

69
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,917
One at a time, please.
One at a time.

70
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,417
Phone, beepers, knives, guns.
If it rings hand it.

71
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:36,875
Hand over the phone, Edwin.

72
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,458
- What phone? I'm clean.
- And the beeping is?

73
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,042
- Thank you. Mr. Will.
- Mr. Jimmy.

74
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,875
- Hey, are we still on for tonight?
- You're going down.

75
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,125
Keep dreaming.

76
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,333
Remember if your phone to school,
your parents...

77
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,458
The expense of spirit in a waste
of shame is lust in action.

78
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,958
And till action, lust is perjured

79
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:00,250
murderous, bloody, full of blame
savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust.

80
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,667
You see what Shakespeare's doing here?
He's using words to create emotions.

81
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,083
What kind of words are these?

82
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,083
They're violent words.
And why is this important?

83
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,000
Because when you feel angry, when you
wanna punch somebody in the face

84
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,917
you put it on paper instead.

85
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:18,167
You find words that evoke emotions in you
and you do something positive with it.

86
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,500
Edwin.

87
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,667
I could have sworn I saw the principal
take the phone from you this morning.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,167
Guess what?

89
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,417
If you applied yourself half as much to
class as you do to scamming the school

90
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,417
you could accomplish anything.

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,125
Ready to suffer?

92
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:07,917
Bring it on.

93
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,917
- Thank you.
- I'll see you. / I'll see you.

94
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,417
I'm this way.

95
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,292
- Goodnight.
- Bye. / Bye.

96
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,458
Bitch, huh?

97
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,375
Get in!

98
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,625
Really.

99
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,667
Check mate and mate, mate.

100
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,625
I didn't see that coming.

101
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,125
Yo, your problem,
my man, is you play it too safe.

102
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,250
You gotta take some chances,
you know, play not to lose.

103
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,875
Pretty much ensures defeat.

104
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,625
Set 'em up, asshole.

105
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,292
- All right, good play.
- All right.

106
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:04,417
- Goodnight, Jimmy.
- Goodnight.

107
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,042
I'm here to see Laura Gerard.
I'm her husband.

108
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,917
Mr. Gerard, if you would follow me.

109
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,917
I've been caring for your wife
ever since she came in.

110
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,125
We've be keeping her pretty
sedated on pain medication.

111
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,000
She has several deep lacerations,
internal bleeding.

112
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,250
We're keeping a close watch on her.

113
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Lieutenant Richards, NOPD.

114
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,792
She gave us description.

115
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,792
We're working up a composite likeness.
We're gonna get there.

116
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,583
Could you all give me a moment
with my wife? Please?

117
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,625
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,792
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,042
I wanted to her to come out with us.

120
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,750
Hey, Will.

121
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,708
I'm so sorry.

122
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,083
The son of the bitch
who did this to Laura

123
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,125
they're gonna find him.

124
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,750
Go home, Jimmy. It's late.

125
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:04,083
- I'll be all right.
- Anything you need, man, okay?

126
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,875
- Anything. You just call me.
- Thanks.

127
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,458
Close your own eyes. Tight.

128
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,667
Thank you.

129
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,625
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

130
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,208
Sounds terrible.

131
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,292
Laura, right?
Is she okay?

132
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,125
- Are you with the police?
- No.

133
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,500
No, but I, um...

134
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,875
a couple of years ago,
I experienced something similar.

135
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,167
So it's probably
what you're going through right now.

136
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,792
- You did?
- Yeah.

137
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,625
The man who raped your wife,
he was, uh...

138
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,625
he was paroled three weeks ago.

139
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,333
You know who did this?

140
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,625
He's done it before, he'll do it again.

141
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,625
If you want...

142
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,500
we can take care of him for you.

143
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,500
Take care of who?
What do you mean arrest him?

144
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,875
Uh, well, if we hand him
over to the police

145
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,583
it'll take at least six months
for DNA tests to be completed.

146
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,042
Ultimately there would be a trial
which your wife

147
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,125
assuming she didn't drop
the charges would be...

148
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,583
dragged through
this nightmare over and over.

149
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,417
She'll be in court.
She'll be questioned by the lawyers.

150
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:14,208
And even if the DA gets a conviction
which is not guaranteed

151
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,625
the rapist can serve
as little as 11 months

152
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,458
you know which is half the time
you get for tax evasion.

153
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,250
Who are you?

154
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,167
I'm Simon.

155
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,292
I represent an organization that, uh...

156
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,417
that deals with people.

157
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,125
Like the man that raped your wife

158
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,292
we would very much like
to take care of him for you.

159
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,500
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

160
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,583
You know what I'm talking about.

161
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,417
This wouldn't cost you
anything financially.

162
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,000
I mean if you did want us
to deal with this, uh

163
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,292
we may ask a favor of you
at some point in the future.

164
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,542
Look after somebody
for a couple of hours

165
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,000
or break a security camera,
make a phone call or just

166
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,292
something that would help us out.

167
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,792
You...

168
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,458
you know where he is?

169
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,083
We do but we have a time issue
so, uh, we would have to...

170
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,375
get an answer from you pretty quickly.

171
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,458
Listen.

172
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:30,417
We're just a few citizens
who are seeking justice.

173
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,042
You know we love the city.
We're tired of watching it go to hell.

174
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,542
No.

175
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,583
No.

176
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:53,792
Okay. That's okay.
You take care.

177
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,125
Wait.

178
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,625
There's a row of vending machines
in the Oncology Department cafeteria.

179
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,625
If you want this to happen,
select the Forever Bar.

180
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:34,000
Buy two of them, okay?
Two of them.

181
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,750
And, Mr. Gerard, we never spoke.

182
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,750
You never met me. Okay?

183
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,917
You do not repeat
this conversation to anybody.

184
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,750
- So, you got the healthy ones, huh?
- Excuse me?

185
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,625
I just figured
if you're going to have a treat

186
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,792
you should have
something that's worth it, huh?

187
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,917
Hey. Cool, man.

188
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,375
It's all right.

189
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:56,792
What the fuck...?

190
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,208
What do you want?

191
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,458
You raped a woman tonight.

192
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,708
Your wife?

193
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,625
I have no wife.
I don't know who she is.

194
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,958
My wife was murdered three months ago
by some scumbag just like you.

195
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,458
Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,500
Kirksey Funeral Homes.

197
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,833
The hungry rabbit jumps.

198
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,000
Mr. Gerard?

199
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,292
- Mr. Gerard?
- Yes.

200
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,167
We need you to sign a few more
insurance forms, please.

201
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,458
I talked to the police this morning.

202
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,375
They found the rapist.

203
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,292
He's dead.

204
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,458
Committed suicide.

205
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,875
We'll find a way to get over this

206
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,000
together.

207
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,208
I know.

208
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,958
- I'm sorry.
- No.

209
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,167
Don't say that.

210
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,875
It's just hard.

211
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,500
Sweetheart, that man is gone.

212
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,333
- I want a new lock on the door.
- Okay.

213
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,083
And bars on the windows.

214
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,458
Will?

215
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,125
Yeah, just me.

216
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,625
- Did you lock the door?
- Doors locked.

217
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,542
I sound like a crazy person.

218
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,125
No, you sound like a person
who's getting over something difficult.

219
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,083
I wanna buy a gun.

220
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,792
We're not keeping a gun in this house.
No guns.

221
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,292
All right. If your stance is not stable
you're not gonna be stable.

222
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,917
Remember feet shoulder-width apart
knees slightly bent.

223
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,125
Lean forward at the waist.

224
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,833
Bring the gun to your eyesight.

225
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,750
You got that front sight, rear sight.

226
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,583
Squeeze the trigger.

227
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,958
There's your pepper spray.

228
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,375
Remember, squeeze the trigger.

229
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,375
- Take care.
- Thanks.

230
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,917
Oh, on you I missed.

231
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,583
- Well, you still have to make it.
- All right,

232
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,958
- side pocket.
- Oh, no. A lot of green, Laura.

233
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,417
A lot of green.

234
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,042
- Oh, good game, honey.
- You're a pool shark.

235
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,000
You noticed.

236
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,500
All right, let's go again.
I'll give you a chance to even the score.

237
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:57,125
- All right, I'll rack 'em, you grab drinks.
- Fine. Good idea.

238
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,000
Hello?

239
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:11,083
Will? Come outside.
I need to talk to you.

240
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,958
- Who is this?
- It's Simon. I have to talk to you.

241
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,583
Come outside.

242
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,833
Just tell Laura, it's your sister.

243
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,167
- Hello?
- You see the store on the corner?

244
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,500
- Yes.
- Go in there.

245
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,208
Now I want you to buy a pack of gum

246
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,833
then come out the back entrance.

247
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:40,917
- Have any gum?
- Yes.

248
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,917
- How much is it?
- Dollar fifty.

249
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,083
- Is that the back entrance?
- Yeah, through that.

250
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,917
- Hey, Will, come on in.
- What do you want?

251
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,083
Just a quick talk.
Relax. You're looking good.

252
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,083
So is your wife. I'm glad to
see you guys are back on track.

253
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:11,917
What do you want to talk about?

254
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,083
What do you think?

255
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,917
There is a, uh, mailbox
at the entrance of the zoo.

256
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,667
And we would like you
to go there tomorrow after work

257
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,792
and mail this at exactly 4:15.

258
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,292
What is it?

259
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,167
It's a letter to Santa Claus.

260
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:39,333
Santa Claus?

261
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,708
- And then I'm even?
- Well, that's not up to me.

262
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,583
Well, who's it up to?

263
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:49,625
All I know is I need you to mail that

264
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:02,042
Where did you go?

265
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,667
Well, my sister called. It was too noisy
in here so I had to step outside.

266
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:09,792
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

267
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:11,708
- Fine.
- Play again? Double or nothing?

268
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,750
No. I'm real tired. Let's go.

269
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:15,958
- Okay?
- Okay.

270
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:20,833
Yes?

271
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,167
- You're in the mailbox?
- I am.

272
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,958
Open the letter.

273
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,792
Okay. Hold on.

274
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:40,833
- Okay.
- Go to the zoo.

275
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,417
Pay for the ticket with cash
and wait by the entrance.

276
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,625
If the woman and the girls show up,

277
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:51,000
you follow them. If that man appears,
and say, "The hungry rabbit jumps."

278
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,083
- You got it?
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

279
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,917
That's right.

280
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,083
- What does it mean?
- It means what it means.

281
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:02,167
Now, memorize the number
and their pictures

282
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,542
and tear up that sheet
until it's confetti.

283
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,000
You got it?

284
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,083
Okay, good luck.

285
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,958
I wanna welcome you to the zoo
and to our elephant show.

286
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:41,958
We have two elephants here
in the Audobon Zoo both Asian females.

287
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,500
This is Jean.

288
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,583
She is 36 years old

289
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:48,250
and she weighs 7600 pounds.

290
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:53,500
Anya is 45
and she's 10,400 pounds.

291
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:55,625
What we're gonna show you today
are a few behaviors

292
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,458
that the elephants know

293
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,083
and things that we need
to do daily to take a look at 'em

294
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,542
to make sure they're healthy
and doing well.

295
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:23,708
What you're looking at?
I've seen bitch.

296
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:26,208
All right! All right.
Nobody's looking at anybody.

297
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,458
- Settle down. Come on.
- Don't touch me.

298
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,583
I'm not touching you, I'm guiding you.

299
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,500
All right. We need everybody to...

300
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,666
- Hey, Will.
- You came into my classroom?

301
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
- Why? I don't get this.
- No need to shout, Will. I'm right here.

302
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,250
I've done everything you asked

303
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:56,500
- the Santa Claus letter, the zoo...
- The man didn't show up?

304
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,250
No, I don't think so but,
look, I'm finished.

305
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,750
Will, you've been very helpful
and we appreciate it.

306
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,416
But what you've done
is only part of it, okay?

307
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,416
- We just need you to do one more thing.
- I think you made a mistake here.

308
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,375
I'm not cut out to the kind of activity.

309
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,250
- Yeah?
- I hope you're right.

310
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,583
Will, a promise is a promise, okay?
I'll be in touch.

311
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,416
- Oh.
- Excuse me. Hey, now, my bad, brother.

312
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,166
- It's all right.
- Oh.

313
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,791
- You dropped something.
- No, it's not mine.

314
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,458
Oh, sure it is.

315
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,916
Hey, this isn't mine.

316
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,416
- Will?
- Yeah?

317
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,708
We finished rehearsal early today.
You wanna go out for dinner?

318
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,416
Uh, sure.

319
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,250
- Hello.
- I assume you got the package.

320
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,458
Yes.

321
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,958
Okay, tomorrow morning
you'll have an issue with your car

322
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:35,416
and take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

323
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,250
get off at the Earhart Boulevard stop.

324
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,333
You'll see a pedestrian ramp that
goes down to the ground level.

325
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,458
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

326
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,166
Wait for him on the ramp.

327
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
As he passes

328
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,458
you're gonna bump him and knock him
over the edge. It'll be easy.

329
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,291
There's a low rail.
It's gonna look like a suicide.

330
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,916
Now, there's two security cameras
that cover that spot.

331
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,375
But don't worry about them,
they're both disabled.

332
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,750
- When it's done, you call me.
- No, I am done.

333
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,750
- Will...
- I followed that woman, those girls.

334
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,291
I'm done.

335
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,083
All you have to say is
"the hungry rabbit jumps."

336
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:12,000
You got it?
The hungry rabbit jumps.

337
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:18,416
- What are you doing out here?
- I can't get reception inside.

338
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:47,416
What is it?

339
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,416
Does it have something to do with me?

340
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,291
I read that sometimes

341
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,875
the partner of the victim
has trouble readjusting.

342
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, God, no, no.
We're fine.

343
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,291
Then what is it?

344
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:10,541
- Will, whatever it is, you can tell me.
- It's nothing. I love you.

345
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,916
So take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

346
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,625
get off at the Earhart Boulevard.

347
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,416
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

348
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,875
You'll see a pedestrian ramp
that goes down to the ground level.

349
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,291
It'll be easy. There's a low rail.
It's gonna look like a suicide.

350
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,458
- Hey, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

351
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,250
But you're never late.

352
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,166
Okay, I get it.

353
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,416
How many times
do you want me to apologize?

354
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,125
And I wished that I had died

355
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:48,791
and far into the night
he crooned that tune.

356
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,916
The stars went out
and so did the moon.

357
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,708
The singer stopped playing
and went to bed

358
00:36:56,958 --> 00:37:00,125
while the weary blues echoed
through his head.

359
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,083
He slept like a rock

360
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,416
or man that's dead.

361
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:23,083
What happened?
You backed out?

362
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,083
I told you I couldn't do it.

363
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,958
Will, you know
what a child pornographer does.

364
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,958
He arranges for adult men to
have sex with children in videotapes it.

365
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,625
I get it. He's the scum of the earth.

366
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,000
Needs to get what's coming to him.

367
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,958
But I'm not the guy to do it.
I am not a killer.

368
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:39,416
- Will, let's not forget what we did for you.
- I wasn't myself that night.

369
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,916
Nobody said anything in the agreement
about killing anybody.

370
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,166
So get the hell out of my life.

371
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,791
Why would someone slash our tires?

372
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,041
But how did they even get
into the garage area?

373
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,041
It wouldn't be all that difficult.

374
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:20,791
What's the matter?

375
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,291
Nothing.

376
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,083
But why are you acting so weird?

377
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,041
- Why does somehow...
- Will?

378
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,625
Will Gerard?
I thought it was you.

379
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,291
Simon Adams.
We taught over Bartram together.

380
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,916
- Remember?
- Right.

381
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,583
- Hey, Simon.
- Laura, Will's wife.

382
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,041
So how's it going?
Still fighting a good fight?

383
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:44,416
- Yeah.
- Good.

384
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,583
I got out. I moved to Seattle.
I'm just back consoling a friend. His, uh...

385
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,750
his wife got murdered.

386
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:56,083
- Oh, my god, that's awful.
- Yeah. Unbelievable. Really, uh,

387
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:58,208
it really shouldn't have happened.

388
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,416
Well, would you like to join us,
Simon, have a drink?

389
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,958
Sure, just for a moment.
I, uh,

390
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,041
I don't wanna intrude.

391
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,791
- Don't tell me you're a teacher too, Laura?
- I'm a musician.

392
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,541
- Nice. Love to hear you play.
- Simon.

393
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,958
Not to be rude but Laura and I were
actually having a private meal together.

394
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:23,500
Of course.
Yeah, I understand.

395
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,166
Nice to meet Laura.

396
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,041
It's funny how people come in
and out of each others' lives.

397
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,291
Don't you think?

398
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,125
Call me, Will.

399
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,041
Take care, guys.

400
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,708
It's terrible about his friend's
about his friend's wife being murdered.

401
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,875
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,208
Did you see my work bag?

403
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,875
It's right there.

404
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:15,333
Honey, I think I left something in the car.
I'll be back right back.

405
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:16,875
Okay.

406
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,500
Kirksey Funeral Home.

407
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,250
Hello? Kirksey Funeral Home.

408
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,416
- I want to talk to Simon.
- Is this Mr. Gerard?

409
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,916
- Yes.
- Mr. Gerard,

410
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,250
I know that it's
a very tough time for you...

411
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,916
- but we here at Kirksey Funeral Home...
- No, no, no.

412
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:07,791
Want to make...
- Tell Simon to leave my wife the fuck alone.

413
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:10,958
Hey, man, do you realize somebody
slashed your tires

414
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,791
- on the other side?
- Yeah, I know that. Thank you.

415
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,416
Jesus, all right, man. Sorry.

416
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:26,583
- Will?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

417
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,041
Yes.

418
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,916
- Where have you been?
- I told you I had to go down to the car.

419
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,333
Oh, I thought I heard you
walking around.

420
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:03,875
What?

421
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,750
Nothing. Just watching you.

422
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,750
Laura, uh

423
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:28,666
I love you.

424
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,500
- I love you too, honey.
- Okay.

425
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,291
I called the "triple A".
They'll...

426
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,791
be here this morning with the tires on.

427
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,875
Mr. Walczak,
I need to speak with you.

428
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,958
Stop! Stop! Stop!

429
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:36,166
Stop!

430
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,416
Stop!

431
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,083
Please, I need a...

432
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:41,208
No!

433
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:45,916
No!

434
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,666
Hi. I'm gonna need your card

435
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:25,166
and I'm gonna need the locking key
of your wheel nuts.

436
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:26,458
Do you have it?

437
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:29,833
Good question.

438
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:56,291
- Yes?
- Hello, Will.

439
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,208
Just wanted to thank you.

440
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,541
You did a helluva job.
Walczak is dead.

441
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,458
And now you're done.
Have a great life.

442
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,750
- What's up, punk? Say something.
- Hey.

443
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:11,500
Hey!

444
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:12,916
Hey!

445
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,291
Come on, break it up! Come on.

446
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,291
- Break it up!
- Hands off me, faggot!

447
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,291
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get off me, man.

448
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,625
Will, what's...?

449
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:26,208
Striking a student is a minimum
three weeks suspension.

450
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,583
Three weeks.

451
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,541
What the hell are you thinking, Will?

452
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,208
You're home early.

453
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,125
Yeah, it was, uh

454
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:40,750
half day.

455
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,000
- Student conferences.
- That's funny

456
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,708
because Jimmy called me
to check on you.

457
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:47,916
What'd he say?

458
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,416
He said that you hit a student
and got suspended.

459
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,458
Yeah, well that kid is, uh...

460
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,875
- he's just, uh, total mess.
- And that makes it right?

461
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,541
Thank you. Thank you, darling,
for your support.

462
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:01,541
- My support?
- Yes, your support.

463
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,500
Here.

464
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,583
Where did you get this?

465
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,708
Where did you get it?

466
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:16,583
- I can't tell you that.
- You can't tell me.

467
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,208
I just...

468
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,458
I can't. I can't tell you all right?

469
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,833
- It's not...
- I'm going to rehearsal.

470
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,916
Mahalia Jackson Theater, please.

471
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,625
Laura?

472
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,958
Mr. Gerard, I'm Detective Rudeski.
This is Detective Green.

473
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,416
Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest
for the murder of Alan Marsh.

474
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,375
Who?

475
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,000
Turn around, please, sir.

476
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,333
Who's Alan Marsh?

477
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:11,416
To the left.

478
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,041
Hand over your cellphone, please.

479
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,750
You're gonna hold this here.
Stand up straight.

480
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:23,916
- Go ahead.
- No, it's preposterous.

481
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,958
I'm a school teacher.
I teach English at Rampart High.

482
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,541
I am not a murderer.

483
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,791
- How do you know Alan Marsh?
- I don't.

484
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,458
I want you to talks
a look at something.

485
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:43,333
That's you, right, Mr. Gerard?

486
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,083
Yes.

487
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,500
And here comes Alan Marsh.

488
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,958
Now, how do you know Mr. Marsh?

489
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:01,333
- I don't.
- That's you again.

490
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:06,458
Man, you're clearly distressed.
Right?

491
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:08,583
What happened down there?

492
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:12,916
There is another camera
that shows the ramp under the freeway.

493
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,416
Good, good because that
all proves I didn't kill him.

494
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:19,583
Unfortunately someone forgot
to put the tape in the machine.

495
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:21,791
Empty, no tape.

496
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,791
What were you doing on that ramp?

497
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:27,458
Yeah, I took the bus to work.

498
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,250
Someone slashed my tires.

499
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,750
You can go and check if you like.

500
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:34,250
Let me show you something else.

501
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:36,333
Alan Marsh's cellphone.

502
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,458
Now what were you doing there
at the zoo?

503
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:57,250
I never saw that man

504
00:50:58,291 --> 00:50:59,833
until the day he died.

505
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:01,458
I swear it.

506
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:04,375
Is he gonna write
something bad about you?

507
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:08,708
- What do you mean?
- Investigative journalists like to pry.

508
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,208
He is a journalist?

509
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,333
Look

510
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,583
why don't you walk us through
what happened?

511
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,416
Will, here's the thing.

512
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,916
You tell us the truth.
We can help each other.

513
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,500
I want a lawyer.

514
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,750
Will Gerard, no priors

515
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,958
teaches high school English.

516
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,666
Married, no kids.

517
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,083
Well, only, I guess,
semi-interesting thing...

518
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:58,291
is his wife, Laura Gerard,
was raped in September.

519
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,500
- Why would he wanna kill Marsh?
- Uh, we're getting there, right?

520
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,583
You got anything connected
with him and victim?

521
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,333
- Yeah.
- Video of Gerard on the Marsh's phone.

522
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,458
It looks like Marsh
has been following him.

523
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,500
Let me have a go at him.

524
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,000
You give us an hour?

525
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:16,208
- He'll break soon, boss.
- I said I wanna go at him.

526
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:19,208
You got 23 unsolved up
there on the board.

527
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,250
Work those.

528
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:24,291
- Twenty two actually.
- Well, look again, it's 23.

529
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:33,291
Good afternoon, Mr. Gerard.
I'm Lieutenant Durgan.

530
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:39,958
Let me ask you a few simple questions,
just procedure. Nothing to worry about.

531
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,083
I wanna lawyer.

532
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,750
The day after Monday is...?

533
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:52,833
I want a lawyer.

534
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:56,416
You haven't been charged
with anything, Mr. Gerard.

535
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,125
The day after Monday is...?

536
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:00,625
Tuesday.

537
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,125
My favorite color is...?

538
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,916
What the hell is this?

539
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,166
My favorite color is...?

540
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:10,291
My favorite color?
Uh, purple.

541
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,208
Purple.

542
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,083
If a baby is unhappy, he...?

543
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,416
He cries.

544
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,541
The hungry rabbit?

545
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,583
Jumps.

546
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:31,125
The hungry rabbit jumps.

547
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,166
Got it.

548
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:43,875
Get up.

549
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,166
Put that on.
I'm gonna leave the room.

550
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:49,708
Wait 10 seconds
and get the fuck outta here.

551
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:51,291
And then what?

552
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,000
If you don't go now,
you won't make it through the night.

553
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:56,791
They'll kill you
and make it look like a suicide.

554
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,791
Shut the door behind you.

555
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,083
Hold on a sec?

556
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:11,458
Afternoon.

557
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:27,333
Lieutenant,
you move Will Gerard to Holding?

558
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,791
- No, he's still in three.
- I was just there. It's empty.

559
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,958
- The fuck you're talking about?
- He's not in there.

560
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,416
What do you think he's hiding?

561
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:43,750
I don't know.
I've never seen him like that before.

562
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:46,500
An affair?

563
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,083
No.

564
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,541
No, it's something worse than that.

565
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:55,458
Call him. Tell him, you want some answers,
or you're not coming home.

566
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:00,958
I'll give you some privacy.

567
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:11,958
Homicide.

568
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,375
- Who is this?
- Ma'am, this is Detective Rudeski.

569
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,625
Is this Will Gerard's wife?

570
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:38,041
Hey, it's Trudy.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

571
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,625
Trudy, it's Will.

572
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,458
I need you to do me a favor.

573
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:44,583
I need you to tell Laura in person,
not on the phone.

574
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,750
Tell her I will try to meet her
at rehearsal tomorrow.

575
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,000
- Leave the corner now.
- Tell her, I'm...

576
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,125
- Leave the corner.
...I'm okay.

577
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,166
All right, come on, buddy.
You're going in.

578
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:54,916
Just sleep it off tonight.
Let's go.

579
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,583
Come on.
Get your body bag.

580
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:37,541
Hey, this is Alan Marsh.
This is my website.

581
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,916
Click around on things you
wanna look at have some fun.

582
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,666
You'll find my very byline
my very second byline.

583
00:57:57,958 --> 00:58:00,333
Hey, man.

584
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:03,916
You skipped school.
They can kiss my ass.

585
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:07,750
Damn. You decide.
You decide right there. Yeah.

586
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:15,791
Now you know vandalizing
the school property is illegal, Edwin.

587
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:19,000
What you're doing here, Mr. G?
I heard you got busted by the cops.

588
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,875
What did you do for,
sucker punching a kid?

589
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,625
No.

590
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:26,166
Murder, first degree.

591
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:30,333
I'm sorry I hit it you, Edwin.
I really am.

592
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,875
It's all right.
Maybe I had it coming.

593
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,125
Can you do me a favor, Edwin?

594
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:36,875
I never saw you, Mr. G.

595
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:38,625
You never saw us.

596
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:39,916
Right.

597
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,291
Laura.

598
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:58,708
Will.

599
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,416
What the hell is happening?

600
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,375
What is and you're sure
we can't go to the cops?

601
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:17,208
- We tell them everything.
- Some of them are cops.

602
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,750
You can't stay at home.
Go to Lafitte's Hotel,

603
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:24,458
wait for me there.
Use this call me. The number's in it.

604
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,583
Here. It's all I've got.

605
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:31,208
Take this.

606
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,666
Where it come from?

607
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,333
I was scared.

608
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:41,583
I should never have put us in this mess.

609
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:44,666
If they had asked me that night,
I would have done the same thing.

610
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,791
Will, what are you gonna do?

611
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,875
- Where you're gonna go?
- Cops.

612
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,625
Those were the same guys
that came to our apartment.

613
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,708
You have to go. Go!

614
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:00,916
Mrs. Gerard.

615
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:02,250
What do you want now?

616
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,666
A little follow up. Has your husband
tried to contact you, Mrs. Gerard?

617
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:08,416
- No, he has not.
- I find that hard to believe.

618
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:12,125
- Do you?
- You seemed a little tense.

619
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:15,083
Yeah, I'm a little tense, Detective.

620
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,583
In my situation, should I be relaxed?

621
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:20,750
I have rehearsal.

622
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,583
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

623
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:25,791
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

624
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,750
Nobody takes a story like you.
You were the best.

625
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:33,500
But Jesus, Marshy, you could have picked
a more dignified way to go out.

626
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,166
You escaped from a Chechen jail.

627
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,125
You survived your own divorce,
for crying out loud.

628
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,666
Just barely.

629
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,625
And that piece you wrote about
the music industry that was beautiful.

630
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,250
Gorgeous story.
Marshy, here's to you.

631
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,583
- You're the real deal.
- Amen, brother.

632
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,041
You redheaded, asshole!

633
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,291
- Here, here!
- Here's a little music for Marshy.

634
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:28,875
- We're having a toast to Marshy.
- Marshy!

635
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,541
And to our new best friend
as long as he keeps buying.

636
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:32,916
- Will.
- Will.

637
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,208
- Marshy was a great guy, huh?
- He was one hell of a journalist.

638
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,833
A couple of weeks ago
we had lunch and, uh

639
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:45,666
- weirdest thing happened.
- What's that, he paid?

640
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:51,958
No, he, uh, he tells me
about the secret organization. Some...

641
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,916
group that claims to hand out justice

642
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,541
you know,
when the justice system fails and...

643
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,083
- He told you that?
- Oh, it's true.

644
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:02,458
They killed him,
made it look like a suicide.

645
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,416
You better watch your back there, Will.

646
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,625
Because anybody associated
with Marshy is a marked man.

647
01:03:08,166 --> 01:03:11,000
- And why do they want him dead?
- Because...

648
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,666
Joe, you tell him.

649
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,125
Because Alan Marsh...

650
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,958
was an alien.

651
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:23,291
He was sent here as a scout
to prepare for the invasion of earth.

652
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:27,458
So, Will you... you are now obligated
to buy us another round.

653
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:28,583
Absolutely.

654
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,208
Augie!

655
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,291
Don't worry about it, Will.
He's been telling that crazy story to everybody.

656
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,625
He went so far as even hiding
his own research.

657
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,625
Where'd he hide it?

658
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,625
Well, that would be the $64-million
question, wouldn't it?

659
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:53,666
Cheers.

660
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,083
Well, he was obsessed.

661
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,500
I mean he said he was about to
make that all stuff public.

662
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:03,541
The truth is, I mean, Alan...

663
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:07,541
- he had some issues.
- Yeah, it got worse.

664
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,541
One of the sources got bumped off.

665
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:13,166
And after that, I don't know, man.
He just he became like, uh...

666
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,750
- Different man.
- Yeah.

667
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:18,458
Jumpy, paranoid, lying son of a bitch.

668
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,583
Just sort of like you, Will.

669
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,416
So what are you, a cop?

670
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:26,666
Next time you wanna come snooping
around show your badge

671
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:28,958
and don't pretend to be his friend.

672
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,541
Will.

673
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:47,958
- Stop him!
- Hey, Will!

674
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:50,791
Will, come back. I wanna talk to you.

675
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:54,166
Go after him. Get in the car.

676
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,000
Go, get him.

677
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,416
He went over himself.

678
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,333
Get down. Get down below.

679
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:44,500
Will?

680
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:49,291
No need to run, Will.

681
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,875
I have something that
I think you may want.

682
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,500
It's the tape from the security camera.
I just wanna show you.

683
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,500
I have it right here.

684
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:06,083
Why don't you come out?
I'll show it to you.

685
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,458
Come on, Will.

686
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:12,583
Will, come on out.
It's very clear you didn't kill anybody.

687
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,416
I just want to sell it to you.

688
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:17,375
Will?

689
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:28,166
Hey!

690
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,166
Goddammit!

691
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:16,208
Mrs. Gerard...

692
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:18,416
I'm Detective Sims of the New Orleans
Police Department.

693
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:19,916
Would you come with me, please?

694
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:21,833
- Now what?
- Your husband, Mrs. Gerard.

695
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,666
We just found out some new information
that indicates he's innocent.

696
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:25,791
You do?

697
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:28,333
We need your help to get him out
of this mess. Come with me, please.

698
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:29,666
Of course.

699
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:52,000
So what's this new evidence?

700
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,458
- Excuse me?
- You said there was new evidence.

701
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:58,291
We'll show you
when we get down the station.

702
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:28,875
Man, mother fucker!

703
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,166
The wireless customer
you are calling is not available.

704
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,750
Please try again later.

705
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:11,666
Hey!

706
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:17,083
In a hyphenated compound situation
do you capitalize the second word?

707
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:21,458
Only if it's a noun and the words
have equal weight

708
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:27,083
like, "Homeland Security".
If it's a participle modifying the first word then

709
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,625
you better,
uh... you better keep it lower case.

710
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,791
Huh, yeah, it makes sense.
Thanks.

711
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:58,750
Edmund Burke.
"A philosophical enquiry."

712
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:07,958
It is not what a lawyer tells me
I may do but what

713
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:12,125
humanity, reason,
and justice tell me I ought to do.

714
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:28,625
There's a guy in the news room
going through Alan Marsh's desk.

715
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:30,625
I've never seen him before.

716
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:31,875
Look.

717
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:35,250
Where'd he go?
I'm telling you he was right there.

718
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:51,000
Eight sixty five, eight sixty five.
Eight sixty five,

719
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:54,041
Here we go 865.
Be right back, sir.

720
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:18,250
Thank you, sir.
By the way, this is a nice car.

721
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:19,583
Thank you.

722
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,583
Paris Truck Stop.

723
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,916
Paris Truck Stop.

724
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,750
Paris Truck Stop.
Paris Truck Stop.

725
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:56,166
Twenty one and one Paris Road.

726
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,416
All right, let's try that.

727
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,250
I wonder if you could help me.

728
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:29,541
I worked for the New Orleans Post.
And I'm looking a missing colleague.

729
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:32,583
I know he would come here
to get gas and supplies.

730
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,000
Do you recognize him?

731
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:42,291
I've seen him.
He goes fishing on the weekends.

732
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:44,750
He keeps his boat in one of those
units over there.

733
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,375
Which unit?

734
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:51,875
22, I think it is.
But I haven't seen him in a few days.

735
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:53,875
The truth is, uh

736
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:58,750
well, he owes me quite a bit of money.
Is there any way to get in that unit?

737
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:02,041
Well, uh, no, I don't have the keys.

738
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:05,458
I mean those storage units
have nothing to do with me.

739
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:10,208
So there's no other possible way
I can in there and get what's owed me?

740
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:15,625
Well, it looks like they're made out
of some pretty cheap shit.

741
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,416
I saw some guy accidentally
backed into one.

742
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,541
It went right through the door.

743
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,125
Really?

744
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:27,791
- So he went right through it?
- Right through.

745
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:33,208
I really appreciate your understanding
of my situation.

746
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,750
Well, we're all God's children.

747
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:05,333
Hey, good morning.

748
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,416
You know if they find out
I'm talking to you, they're gonna kill me.

749
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:44,500
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

750
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:47,875
It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do

751
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,083
but it's what humanity,
reason and justice tell me I ought to do.

752
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:53,000
Edmund Burke said it.

753
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:56,541
Hungry-Humanity.
Rabbit-Reason.

754
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:59,500
Jumps-Justice.
Humanity, reason, justice.

755
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:04,083
Well, it was just supposed to be the worst.
You know rapists, murderers

756
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,583
child molesters. But then...

757
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:10,000
Simon he started widening the net.

758
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:12,083
Anybody he designated as
"unworthy of living"

759
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:13,500
Who's Simon?

760
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:16,166
He runs my cell.
I don't know his real name.

761
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,583
- Tell me about how your cell works.
- Uh, it's just handful of men.

762
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:22,625
Uh, Simon gives us our orders.

763
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:27,500
He gets his from higher up. I mean
the idea is that if complications arise

764
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:31,083
then the cell can be cut off
without a threat to the organization.

765
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:33,875
We also use people
who have made a deal with us

766
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,458
who owes us a favor.

767
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:36,916
Hey, look

768
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:40,041
I got into this because I was sick
of seeing the city rot.

769
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:44,541
I wanted to help. I wanted to
make it a livable place for my family

770
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:47,333
my two little girls.

771
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:50,750
Okay? But now it's... it's wrong.

772
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,583
Simon's out of control
and I have no way

773
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:56,166
for talking anybody higher
in the organization.

774
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:58,750
Oh, god.

775
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:01,000
- What is it, Mr. Bourdette?
- I can't. This is wrong.

776
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:02,416
Whoa!

777
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:03,666
Mr. Bourdette?

778
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:12,583
November 3rd, this is Alan Marsh.

779
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:55,125
Will, Jesus, man,
everybody's looking...

780
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:59,958
- Christ, what the hell is going on?
- I know, Jimmy.

781
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:02,333
- What the fuck do you know?
- I saw the pictures.

782
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,916
You and Simon.

783
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:06,125
- You're part of this.
- Look, okay. Will,

784
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:10,333
okay, listen to me, okay?
I'm a part of the organization, okay?

785
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:13,000
I joined 15 years ago
when my brother got killed.

786
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:16,791
They didn't even test the bastard.
I had to do something so I'm sorry.

787
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:21,250
The fucking scumbag that raped Laura
I wanted him crucified.

788
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:24,041
Who set me up for the murder
of that reporter, huh?

789
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:26,375
- Was it you, you fuck?
- I called Durgan

790
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:28,708
told him to let you go.
That was me.

791
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,291
What's Simon's real name?

792
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,791
Will, I can't tell you that.

793
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:38,625
You have no idea
what this guy is capable of.

794
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:42,083
His name.

795
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:45,583
- I'm your fucking friend.
- No!

796
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,750
You're Simon's friend.
You tell me his fucking name.

797
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:51,416
What's his name?

798
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,166
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

799
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:34,250
- Open the seatbelt.
- Get out of the car!

800
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:35,791
Okay.

801
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:38,791
Fuck you pedophile.

802
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:40,916
The hungry rabbit jumps.

803
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,875
- The hungry rabbit jumps.
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

804
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:52,041
How long have you been following me?

805
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:53,541
Answer me!

806
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,875
Not long. Just from that house
on Seaborne Street.

807
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:58,916
I was just told to wait for you there.

808
01:25:59,208 --> 01:26:00,958
And if you turned up
and I was to follow you and...

809
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,541
Why did you agree to kill me?

810
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,208
I owed him.

811
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:06,625
He killed the man
who murdered my sister.

812
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:07,750
Simon?

813
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,583
- What's his mobile number?
- It's in my cellphone.

814
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,000
Get up.

815
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:15,250
- Get up!
- Don't kill me, please. Please don't kill...

816
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:17,416
Get up! Give me the phone.

817
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:21,208
Get outta here, Go!

818
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,958
What does hungry rabbit jumps mean?

819
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:57,250
"It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do..."

820
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:01,000
Yeah?

821
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:02,833
Eugene Cook

822
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:05,583
head of the RJ Allen Group.

823
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:07,416
- Will?
- You framed me.

824
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:10,083
You framed me for the murder
of Alan Marsh.

825
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:12,000
I also know that

826
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:15,208
you had Bourdette killed.
Watch.

827
01:27:21,625 --> 01:27:23,166
The hungry rabbit jumps mean...

828
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:27,333
"It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do but it's what..."

829
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,125
And there's more.

830
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,791
Very resourceful.

831
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,416
I want the security tape
from the overpass.

832
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,500
The one that shows I didn't kill Marsh.

833
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,083
So I've got something you want

834
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:39,041
and now it looks like
you've got something I want.

835
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,250
We should trade.

836
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,083
Here's what's going to happen.

837
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,083
You're going to meet me
at the Super dome

838
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:46,833
five o'clock tonight.

839
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:49,291
You bring the tape.

840
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:56,375
- Eugene Cook.
- There'll be a prepaid ticket in your name.

841
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:58,208
Go to your assigned seat

842
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:00,708
and wait for me there.

843
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:47,375
Hey, Trudy, I need to talk to you.
Can I come in?

844
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:49,000
Yeah, sure.

845
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:54,416
By hiding out, she is not helping Will.

846
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:57,250
And she may be charged with aiding
and abetting a fugitive

847
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:58,791
or even as an accessory to murder.

848
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,333
- Do you...
- I'm sorry, Jimmy. I don't know.

849
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,416
She's not answering her cell.
She's not returning my calls.

850
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,041
You're her best friend, right?

851
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:06,750
You know her better than
maybe anyone else in the whole world.

852
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,416
If you were in her shoes,
where would you go?

853
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,291
Will?

854
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:28,208
- Who is it?
- Laura? Where's Jimmy?

855
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:31,583
- How did you...?
- Can I come in?

856
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:32,625
Where's Will?

857
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:47,083
Will?

858
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:50,750
I'm here.

859
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,583
- Where are you?
- Get up on your seat

860
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:55,291
and head towards the concourse.

861
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,916
- What?
- Get up and head toward the concourse.

862
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:22,750
- Yeah?
- Go out on to the concourse.

863
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:25,500
You'll see a men's room.
Go in.

864
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:36,500
Yeah?

865
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:38,041
Take a leak.

866
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,958
- Yeah?
- Go to the hot-dog stand

867
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:56,083
and buy yourself a hot-dog.

868
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:15,625
Having fun?

869
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:32,791
Look at you

870
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:36,208
- trying not to kill a child pornographer.
- He wasn't a child pornographer.

871
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,000
Oh, but you didn't know that.

872
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:40,083
You must be a good man, Will.

873
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,791
An endangered species.

874
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:44,708
- But where is the actual security tape?
- Yeah?

875
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,083
Good.
Sent me a picture.

876
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,500
It's with your wife.

877
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:59,583
This time Jimmy's done a good job.
Now where's my DVD?

878
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:02,166
I don't have it on me.

879
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,875
I'll tell you where it is
when I get my wife.

880
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:13,000
Well, she's in the abandoned mall
next door.

881
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,750
Let's go see her.

882
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:33,125
You believe they
haven't fixed this place up

883
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,666
all these years after the hurricane?

884
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:50,791
Laura.

885
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:54,375
Sorry, buddy.
You left me no choice.

886
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:55,791
Let her go.

887
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:02,041
Did you make copies of this thing?

888
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:03,791
- No.
- Now that's good.

889
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:07,250
'Cause if you did, I'm gonna fly to Philly
and find your sister and her two little kids

890
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,041
- and tell them a really scary bedtime story.
- You have what you want.

891
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:11,791
Please let her go.

892
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:15,875
What I do is so important
to jeopardize. I'm sorry.

893
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,625
So you and Laura are not gonna
walk outta here today.

894
01:33:20,666 --> 01:33:21,833
You're insane.

895
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:26,791
What did you say?

896
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:30,041
I said I think you're sick.

897
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:34,166
On the contrary, I am very well.

898
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:36,000
You don't see it, do you?

899
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:39,250
The city and how close
we are to absolute chaos?

900
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,541
Jimmy sees it.
Don't you, Jimmy?

901
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:45,583
Sick, I'm not sick.

902
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:48,583
The sick ones are sitting on their fat,
fucking asses eating and

903
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:51,416
drinking and fucking themselves
into a stupor.

904
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:55,583
Polluting the world without a second
thought while it goes down the toilet.

905
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:58,041
Nobody wants
to do the nasty work, Will.

906
01:33:58,583 --> 01:33:59,833
You know the shit that
we all just think about.

907
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:02,291
Most good citizens
are just along for the ride

908
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:05,083
and they fucking bitch and moan
and complain about everything

909
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:06,458
when it doesn't work out.

910
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:08,750
But not me.

911
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:10,333
Get it done.

912
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:13,250
Will!

913
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:26,958
What the fuck, Jimmy?

914
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,666
You promised not to hurt them!

915
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:34,666
We didn't get into this organization
to kill innocent people.

916
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:42,041
Laura, run!

917
01:34:43,999 --> 01:34:44,999
You're happy now?

918
01:35:44,624 --> 01:35:45,583
Will!

919
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:47,833
Will!

920
01:36:54,666 --> 01:36:56,583
So Jimmy's dead, huh?

921
01:36:57,124 --> 01:36:58,541
Eugene Cook killed him.

922
01:37:06,791 --> 01:37:08,624
Who killed Eugene Cook?

923
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:10,791
I did.

924
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:13,874
I don't think so.

925
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:17,916
Here's what happened.

926
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:22,083
Eugene Cook
and Jimmy killed each other.

927
01:37:22,874 --> 01:37:24,874
I don't even think you two were here.

928
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:31,583
Simple case of a dead man
killing a dead man.

929
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:36,958
You don't suppose I could interest you
in joining our organization.

930
01:37:37,874 --> 01:37:39,791
- No.
- You sure?

931
01:37:41,124 --> 01:37:43,666
Well, if you have a change of heart

932
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:45,624
you know where to find me, right?

933
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:49,041
Now, I think you two better
get the hell outta here.

934
01:37:49,499 --> 01:37:50,458
Lieutenant.

935
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:53,666
The story you just told us

936
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:55,916
is that how it's going to be?

937
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:58,541
This is New Orleans.

938
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,708
Yeah, that's how it's gonna be.

939
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:04,958
Go on.

940
01:38:13,041 --> 01:38:15,416
Breaking news, we're going live
to Catherine James

941
01:38:15,666 --> 01:38:16,583
on the scene.

942
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:20,541
Detective, the bodies of four males were
found shot in that abandoned mall.

943
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:22,208
Can you tell us what happened?

944
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:25,249
I'm not gonna comment in the middle
of an ongoing investigation.

945
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:26,416
But I can tell you

946
01:38:26,499 --> 01:38:29,666
NOPD is gonna do everything
in its power to get to the bottom of it.

01:38:29,999 --> 01:38:34,416
In other news, prosecutors have dropped all
charges against school teacher Will Gerard

948
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:38,041
who was accused of murdering
the New Orleans Post reporter Alan Marsh.

949
01:38:38,624 --> 01:38:40,958
A security tape uncovered by the NOPD

950
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:44,083
clearly proves that Gerard
did not kill Alan Marsh

951
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:49,166
and, in fact, was trying to defend himself
when Marsh attacked him on the walkway

952
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:51,291
under the Broad Street overpass.

953
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:24,583
This is for you.
It's Marsh's research. It's just a start.

954
01:39:26,624 --> 01:39:27,458
Thanks, Will.

955
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:31,249
He just scratched the surface
and I thought someone should finish it.

956
01:39:32,124 --> 01:39:33,166
I'll give it a look.

957
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:36,416
The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?
