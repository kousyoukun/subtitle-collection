Subtitled by xprakash :)
Enjoy the movie

2
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,367
Are you wasting my time,
Bourdette?

3
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,534
Are you wasting my time?

4
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,367
If they find out
I'm talking to you, they'll

5
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,242
they'll kill me.

6
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,367
Tell me how it works.

7
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:51,534
No, this is...

8
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,700
- this is wrong. This is insane.
- Whoa, whoa.

9
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:55,409
You're doing the right thing

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,159
the brave thing.
Please sit down.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,492
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

12
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,825
Stop!

13
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,200
Thank you.

14
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,450
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

15
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:00,325
So where are we five years from now?

16
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:05,950
Right here at the Lafitte Hotel except
we have a babysitter at home.

17
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:07,492
I like that.

18
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,700
- Me too.
- A babysitter

19
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:13,534
blond, about 19 Swedish

20
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,534
and he's very handsome.

21
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:17,367
Don't fuck with me.

22
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,367
Plunge to his death today off the roof
of a parking structure on Burgundy Street.

23
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:25,325
- We're going live to the scene.
- It's where I parked my car.

24
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,367
Joining me is Lieutenant Durgan
with the NOPD.

25
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,450
You think we have a murder victim here?

26
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,659
I'm not gonna comment at this time
but I will tell you that NOPD

27
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,367
is gonna do everything in its power

28
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,492
- to get to the bottom of this.
- Yeah, right, another unsolved case.

29
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:38,700
- I know what's happening.
- It's New Orleans.

30
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:41,575
- The city's going in hell.
- Oh, come on, we love New Orleans.

31
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,117
Who dat?

32
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:46,909
Well, the city may be going to hell
but we are going dancing.

33
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,492
That's right.

34
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,450
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,825
How did you two meet?

36
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:15,409
I'll bet it was really juicy and romantic.

37
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:18,700
- No, not really.
- I thought it was.

38
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:19,700
Well...

39
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:23,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop. It's a "well"?

40
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:27,325
I know it's a "well".

41
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:31,367
Oh, he was sitting with all these kids
like, 14-15 year olds.

42
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:34,034
Their first time at Symphony
you could tell.

43
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,534
- And they were actually listening.
- One or two of them.

44
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,325
You know I just thought it was incredible
what he was doing for those kids.

45
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:42,409
Bullshit! Those, no, listen,
those kids were juvenile delinquents.

46
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,200
They were supposed to be in detention

47
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,867
and Will was supposed
to supervise but instead

48
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:49,409
this son of a bitch uses his own
hard-earned cash

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,784
to take them to a concert.

50
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,242
- They are my students.
- Of course, you do.

51
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,367
Some bad ass kids.

52
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,534
Oh, it's not "Ow!". It's Aaaw!

53
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,367
- What? ...What?
- Close your eyes.

54
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:35,867
Where are you going?

55
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:37,242
Don't look at me.

56
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,242
- Come back.
- Close your eyes.

57
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,325
Close your eyes.
Tight.

58
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:44,825
Okay.

59
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,200
Put out your hands.

60
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:49,909
What are you going to do?

61
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,909
Unspeakable things.

62
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,909
Happy anniversary.

63
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:01,867
Oh...

64
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:03,950
It's beautiful.

65
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,700
I didn't think
you've gotten me anything.

66
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,200
Of course, I got you something.

67
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,159
They're little rubies.

68
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:19,784
Thank you.

69
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:21,575
I love you.

70
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:31,159
One at a time, please.
One at a time.

71
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,659
Phone, beepers, knives, guns.
If it rings hand it.

72
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:37,117
Hand over the phone, Edwin.

73
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,700
- What phone? I'm clean.
- And the beeping is?

74
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,284
- Thank you. Mr. Will.
- Mr. Jimmy.

75
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,117
- Hey, are we still on for tonight?
- You're going down.

76
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:46,367
Keep dreaming.

77
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,575
Remember if your phone to school,
your parents...

78
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,700
The expense of spirit in a waste
of shame is lust in action.

79
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,200
And till action, lust is perjured

80
00:06:55,575 --> 00:07:00,492
murderous, bloody, full of blame
savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust.

81
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:04,909
You see what Shakespeare's doing here?
He's using words to create emotions.

82
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,325
What kind of words are these?

83
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,325
They're violent words.
And why is this important?

84
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:12,242
Because when you feel angry, when you
wanna punch somebody in the face

85
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:14,159
you put it on paper instead.

86
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:18,409
You find words that evoke emotions in you
and you do something positive with it.

87
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:19,742
Edwin.

88
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,909
I could have sworn I saw the principal
take the phone from you this morning.

89
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,409
Guess what?

90
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:30,659
If you applied yourself half as much to
class as you do to scamming the school

91
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,659
you could accomplish anything.

92
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,367
Ready to suffer?

93
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,159
Bring it on.

94
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,159
- Thank you.
- I'll see you. / I'll see you.

95
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:36,659
I'm this way.

96
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,534
- Goodnight.
- Bye. / Bye.

97
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,700
Bitch, huh?

98
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:23,617
Get in!

99
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:35,867
Really.

100
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,909
Check mate and mate, mate.

101
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,867
I didn't see that coming.

102
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:44,367
Yo, your problem,
my man, is you play it too safe.

103
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,492
You gotta take some chances,
you know, play not to lose.

104
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:49,117
Pretty much ensures defeat.

105
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:50,867
Set 'em up, asshole.

106
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,534
- All right, good play.
- All right.

107
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,659
- Goodnight, Jimmy.
- Goodnight.

108
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:24,284
I'm here to see Laura Gerard.
I'm her husband.

109
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:27,159
Mr. Gerard, if you would follow me.

110
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,159
I've been caring for your wife
ever since she came in.

111
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,367
We've be keeping her pretty
sedated on pain medication.

112
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,242
She has several deep lacerations,
internal bleeding.

113
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,492
We're keeping a close watch on her.

114
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:55,992
Lieutenant Richards, NOPD.

115
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,034
She gave us description.

116
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,034
We're working up a composite likeness.
We're gonna get there.

117
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:07,825
Could you all give me a moment
with my wife? Please?

118
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:34,867
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:37,034
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,284
I wanted to her to come out with us.

121
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,992
Hey, Will.

122
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:49,950
I'm so sorry.

123
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,325
The son of the bitch
who did this to Laura

124
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,367
they're gonna find him.

125
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,992
Go home, Jimmy. It's late.

126
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,325
- I'll be all right.
- Anything you need, man, okay?

127
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,117
- Anything. You just call me.
- Thanks.

128
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,700
Close your own eyes. Tight.

129
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:24,909
Thank you.

130
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:10,867
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

131
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,450
Sounds terrible.

132
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,534
Laura, right?
Is she okay?

133
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,367
- Are you with the police?
- No.

134
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,742
No, but I, um...

135
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:26,117
a couple of years ago,
I experienced something similar.

136
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,409
So it's probably
what you're going through right now.

137
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,034
- You did?
- Yeah.

138
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,867
The man who raped your wife,
he was, uh...

139
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,867
he was paroled three weeks ago.

140
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,575
You know who did this?

141
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,867
He's done it before, he'll do it again.

142
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:44,867
If you want...

143
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,742
we can take care of him for you.

144
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:52,742
Take care of who?
What do you mean arrest him?

145
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,117
Uh, well, if we hand him
over to the police

146
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:59,825
it'll take at least six months
for DNA tests to be completed.

147
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,284
Ultimately there would be a trial
which your wife

148
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,367
assuming she didn't drop
the charges would be...

149
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,825
dragged through
this nightmare over and over.

150
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,659
She'll be in court.
She'll be questioned by the lawyers.

151
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,450
And even if the DA gets a conviction
which is not guaranteed

152
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:17,867
the rapist can serve
as little as 11 months

153
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,700
you know which is half the time
you get for tax evasion.

154
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:24,492
Who are you?

155
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,409
I'm Simon.

156
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,534
I represent an organization that, uh...

157
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:32,659
that deals with people.

158
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,367
Like the man that raped your wife

159
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,534
we would very much like
to take care of him for you.

160
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,742
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

161
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:45,825
You know what I'm talking about.

162
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,659
This wouldn't cost you
anything financially.

163
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:53,242
I mean if you did want us
to deal with this, uh

164
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,534
we may ask a favor of you
at some point in the future.

165
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,784
Look after somebody
for a couple of hours

166
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,242
or break a security camera,
make a phone call or just

167
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,534
something that would help us out.

168
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,034
You...

169
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,700
you know where he is?

170
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:17,325
We do but we have a time issue
so, uh, we would have to...

171
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,617
get an answer from you pretty quickly.

172
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:25,700
Listen.

173
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:30,659
We're just a few citizens
who are seeking justice.

174
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:35,284
You know we love the city.
We're tired of watching it go to hell.

175
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:41,784
No.

176
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:44,825
No.

177
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:54,034
Okay. That's okay.
You take care.

178
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,367
Wait.

179
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:24,867
There's a row of vending machines
in the Oncology Department cafeteria.

180
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,867
If you want this to happen,
select the Forever Bar.

181
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,242
Buy two of them, okay?
Two of them.

182
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,992
And, Mr. Gerard, we never spoke.

183
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:39,992
You never met me. Okay?

184
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,159
You do not repeat
this conversation to anybody.

185
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:00,992
- So, you got the healthy ones, huh?
- Excuse me?

186
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:02,867
I just figured
if you're going to have a treat

187
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:05,034
you should have
something that's worth it, huh?

188
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,159
Hey. Cool, man.

189
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,617
It's all right.

190
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,034
What the fuck...?

191
00:20:58,117 --> 00:20:59,450
What do you want?

192
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,700
You raped a woman tonight.

193
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,950
Your wife?

194
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,867
I have no wife.
I don't know who she is.

195
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:13,200
My wife was murdered three months ago
by some scumbag just like you.

196
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,700
Yeah. Yeah.

197
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,742
Kirksey Funeral Homes.

198
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,075
The hungry rabbit jumps.

199
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,242
Mr. Gerard?

200
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,534
- Mr. Gerard?
- Yes.

201
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:57,409
We need you to sign a few more
insurance forms, please.

202
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,700
I talked to the police this morning.

203
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,617
They found the rapist.

204
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,534
He's dead.

205
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Committed suicide.

206
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,117
We'll find a way to get over this

207
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,242
together.

208
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,450
I know.

209
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,200
- I'm sorry.
- No.

210
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,409
Don't say that.

211
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:50,117
It's just hard.

212
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:56,742
Sweetheart, that man is gone.

213
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:03,575
- I want a new lock on the door.
- Okay.

214
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,325
And bars on the windows.

215
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:35,700
Will?

216
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,367
Yeah, just me.

217
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:39,867
- Did you lock the door?
- Doors locked.

218
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,784
I sound like a crazy person.

219
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:50,367
No, you sound like a person
who's getting over something difficult.

220
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:57,325
I wanna buy a gun.

221
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,034
We're not keeping a gun in this house.
No guns.

222
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:12,534
All right. If your stance is not stable
you're not gonna be stable.

223
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,159
Remember feet shoulder-width apart
knees slightly bent.

224
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:18,367
Lean forward at the waist.

225
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:20,075
Bring the gun to your eyesight.

226
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:22,992
You got that front sight, rear sight.

227
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:24,825
Squeeze the trigger.

228
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,200
There's your pepper spray.

229
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,617
Remember, squeeze the trigger.

230
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,617
- Take care.
- Thanks.

231
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,159
Oh, on you I missed.

232
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:39,825
- Well, you still have to make it.
- All right,

233
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
- side pocket.
- Oh, no. A lot of green, Laura.

234
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:43,659
A lot of green.

235
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:49,284
- Oh, good game, honey.
- You're a pool shark.

236
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:51,242
You noticed.

237
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:53,742
All right, let's go again.
I'll give you a chance to even the score.

238
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:57,367
- All right, I'll rack 'em, you grab drinks.
- Fine. Good idea.

239
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,242
Hello?

240
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,325
Will? Come outside.
I need to talk to you.

241
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,200
- Who is this?
- It's Simon. I have to talk to you.

242
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,825
Come outside.

243
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,075
Just tell Laura, it's your sister.

244
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:24,409
- Hello?
- You see the store on the corner?

245
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:27,742
- Yes.
- Go in there.

246
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,450
Now I want you to buy a pack of gum

247
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,075
then come out the back entrance.

248
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,159
- Have any gum?
- Yes.

249
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:43,159
- How much is it?
- Dollar fifty.

250
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:47,325
- Is that the back entrance?
- Yeah, through that.

251
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,159
- Hey, Will, come on in.
- What do you want?

252
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:07,325
Just a quick talk.
Relax. You're looking good.

253
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:10,325
So is your wife. I'm glad to
see you guys are back on track.

254
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:12,159
What do you want to talk about?

255
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,325
What do you think?

256
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,159
There is a, uh, mailbox
at the entrance of the zoo.

257
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:27,909
And we would like you
to go there tomorrow after work

258
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:31,034
and mail this at exactly 4:15.

259
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:35,534
What is it?

260
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,409
It's a letter to Santa Claus.

261
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,575
Santa Claus?

262
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,950
- And then I'm even?
- Well, that's not up to me.

263
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:45,825
Well, who's it up to?

264
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,867
All I know is I need you to mail that

265
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:02,284
Where did you go?

266
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:05,909
Well, my sister called. It was too noisy
in here so I had to step outside.

267
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,034
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

268
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:11,950
- Fine.
- Play again? Double or nothing?

269
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:13,992
No. I'm real tired. Let's go.

270
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,200
- Okay?
- Okay.

271
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:21,075
Yes?

272
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,409
- You're in the mailbox?
- I am.

273
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,200
Open the letter.

274
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,034
Okay. Hold on.

275
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,075
- Okay.
- Go to the zoo.

276
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:43,659
Pay for the ticket with cash
and wait by the entrance.

277
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,867
If the woman and the girls show up,

278
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:51,242
you follow them. If that man appears,
and say, "The hungry rabbit jumps."

279
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:54,325
- You got it?
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

280
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:56,159
That's right.

281
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:59,325
- What does it mean?
- It means what it means.

282
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:02,409
Now, memorize the number
and their pictures

283
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,784
and tear up that sheet
until it's confetti.

284
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,242
You got it?

285
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:09,325
Okay, good luck.

286
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,200
I wanna welcome you to the zoo
and to our elephant show.

287
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:42,200
We have two elephants here
in the Audobon Zoo both Asian females.

288
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:43,742
This is Jean.

289
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:45,825
She is 36 years old

290
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:48,492
and she weighs 7600 pounds.

291
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:53,742
Anya is 45
and she's 10,400 pounds.

292
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:55,867
What we're gonna show you today
are a few behaviors

293
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,700
that the elephants know

294
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:00,325
and things that we need
to do daily to take a look at 'em

295
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,784
to make sure they're healthy
and doing well.

296
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:23,950
What you're looking at?
I've seen bitch.

297
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,450
All right! All right.
Nobody's looking at anybody.

298
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
- Settle down. Come on.
- Don't touch me.

299
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,825
I'm not touching you, I'm guiding you.

300
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,742
All right. We need everybody to...

301
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:43,908
- Hey, Will.
- You came into my classroom?

302
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:48,742
- Why? I don't get this.
- No need to shout, Will. I'm right here.

303
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:53,492
I've done everything you asked

304
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:56,742
- the Santa Claus letter, the zoo...
- The man didn't show up?

305
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,492
No, I don't think so but,
look, I'm finished.

306
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,992
Will, you've been very helpful
and we appreciate it.

307
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:03,658
But what you've done
is only part of it, okay?

308
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:06,658
- We just need you to do one more thing.
- I think you made a mistake here.

309
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:09,617
I'm not cut out to the kind of activity.

310
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,492
- Yeah?
- I hope you're right.

311
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,825
Will, a promise is a promise, okay?
I'll be in touch.

312
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:25,658
- Oh.
- Excuse me. Hey, now, my bad, brother.

313
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:27,408
- It's all right.
- Oh.

314
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,033
- You dropped something.
- No, it's not mine.

315
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,700
Oh, sure it is.

316
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:35,158
Hey, this isn't mine.

317
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:13,658
- Will?
- Yeah?

318
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,950
We finished rehearsal early today.
You wanna go out for dinner?

319
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:19,658
Uh, sure.

320
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:26,492
- Hello.
- I assume you got the package.

321
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Yes.

322
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,200
Okay, tomorrow morning
you'll have an issue with your car

323
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,658
and take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

324
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,492
get off at the Earhart Boulevard stop.

325
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:41,575
You'll see a pedestrian ramp that
goes down to the ground level.

326
00:33:41,742 --> 00:33:44,700
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

327
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:46,408
Wait for him on the ramp.

328
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:47,742
As he passes

329
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:50,700
you're gonna bump him and knock him
over the edge. It'll be easy.

330
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:53,533
There's a low rail.
It's gonna look like a suicide.

331
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,158
Now, there's two security cameras
that cover that spot.

332
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,617
But don't worry about them,
they're both disabled.

333
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,992
- When it's done, you call me.
- No, I am done.

334
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,992
- Will...
- I followed that woman, those girls.

335
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:06,533
I'm done.

336
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,325
All you have to say is
"the hungry rabbit jumps."

337
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,242
You got it?
The hungry rabbit jumps.

338
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,658
- What are you doing out here?
- I can't get reception inside.

339
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:47,658
What is it?

340
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,658
Does it have something to do with me?

341
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,533
I read that sometimes

342
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:58,117
the partner of the victim
has trouble readjusting.

343
00:34:58,408 --> 00:35:01,242
Oh, God, no, no.
We're fine.

344
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,533
Then what is it?

345
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:10,783
- Will, whatever it is, you can tell me.
- It's nothing. I love you.

346
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,158
So take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

347
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:35,867
get off at the Earhart Boulevard.

348
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:38,658
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

349
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,117
You'll see a pedestrian ramp
that goes down to the ground level.

350
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:44,533
It'll be easy. There's a low rail.
It's gonna look like a suicide.

351
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:33,700
- Hey, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

352
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:35,492
But you're never late.

353
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,408
Okay, I get it.

354
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:39,658
How many times
do you want me to apologize?

355
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:45,367
And I wished that I had died

356
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:49,033
and far into the night
he crooned that tune.

357
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:52,158
The stars went out
and so did the moon.

358
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,950
The singer stopped playing
and went to bed

359
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,367
while the weary blues echoed
through his head.

360
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,325
He slept like a rock

361
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,658
or man that's dead.

362
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,325
What happened?
You backed out?

363
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,325
I told you I couldn't do it.

364
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:27,200
Will, you know
what a child pornographer does.

365
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,200
He arranges for adult men to
have sex with children in videotapes it.

366
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:31,867
I get it. He's the scum of the earth.

367
00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:33,242
Needs to get what's coming to him.

368
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:36,200
But I'm not the guy to do it.
I am not a killer.

369
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:39,658
- Will, let's not forget what we did for you.
- I wasn't myself that night.

370
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:43,158
Nobody said anything in the agreement
about killing anybody.

371
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:45,408
So get the hell out of my life.

372
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:10,033
Why would someone slash our tires?

373
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,283
But how did they even get
into the garage area?

374
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,283
It wouldn't be all that difficult.

375
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:21,033
What's the matter?

376
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:22,533
Nothing.

377
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:25,325
But why are you acting so weird?

378
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,283
- Why does somehow...
- Will?

379
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,867
Will Gerard?
I thought it was you.

380
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,533
Simon Adams.
We taught over Bartram together.

381
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:36,158
- Remember?
- Right.

382
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:39,825
- Hey, Simon.
- Laura, Will's wife.

383
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,283
So how's it going?
Still fighting a good fight?

384
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:44,658
- Yeah.
- Good.

385
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:48,825
I got out. I moved to Seattle.
I'm just back consoling a friend. His, uh...

386
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:50,992
his wife got murdered.

387
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:56,325
- Oh, my god, that's awful.
- Yeah. Unbelievable. Really, uh,

388
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,450
it really shouldn't have happened.

389
00:39:00,408 --> 00:39:02,658
Well, would you like to join us,
Simon, have a drink?

390
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,200
Sure, just for a moment.
I, uh,

391
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,283
I don't wanna intrude.

392
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,033
- Don't tell me you're a teacher too, Laura?
- I'm a musician.

393
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,783
- Nice. Love to hear you play.
- Simon.

394
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:20,200
Not to be rude but Laura and I were
actually having a private meal together.

395
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:23,742
Of course.
Yeah, I understand.

396
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:25,408
Nice to meet Laura.

397
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,283
It's funny how people come in
and out of each others' lives.

398
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:32,533
Don't you think?

399
00:39:33,492 --> 00:39:34,367
Call me, Will.

400
00:39:35,325 --> 00:39:36,283
Take care, guys.

401
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:53,950
It's terrible about his friend's
about his friend's wife being murdered.

402
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:57,117
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:40:58,158 --> 00:40:59,450
Did you see my work bag?

404
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,117
It's right there.

405
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,575
Honey, I think I left something in the car.
I'll be back right back.

406
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:17,117
Okay.

407
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:46,742
Kirksey Funeral Home.

408
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:49,492
Hello? Kirksey Funeral Home.

409
00:41:53,242 --> 00:41:56,658
- I want to talk to Simon.
- Is this Mr. Gerard?

410
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,158
- Yes.
- Mr. Gerard,

411
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:02,492
I know that it's
a very tough time for you...

412
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,158
- but we here at Kirksey Funeral Home...
- No, no, no.

413
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:08,033
Want to make...
- Tell Simon to leave my wife the fuck alone.

414
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,200
Hey, man, do you realize somebody
slashed your tires

415
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,033
- on the other side?
- Yeah, I know that. Thank you.

416
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,658
Jesus, all right, man. Sorry.

417
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:26,825
- Will?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

418
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,283
Yes.

419
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:39,158
- Where have you been?
- I told you I had to go down to the car.

420
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,575
Oh, I thought I heard you
walking around.

421
00:43:03,158 --> 00:43:04,117
What?

422
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:07,992
Nothing. Just watching you.

423
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:24,992
Laura, uh

424
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:28,908
I love you.

425
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:31,742
- I love you too, honey.
- Okay.

426
00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:33,533
I called the "triple A".
They'll...

427
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,033
be here this morning with the tires on.

428
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,117
Mr. Walczak,
I need to speak with you.

429
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:35,200
Stop! Stop! Stop!

430
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:36,408
Stop!

431
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:37,658
Stop!

432
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:39,325
Please, I need a...

433
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:41,450
No!

434
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,158
No!

435
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,908
Hi. I'm gonna need your card

436
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,408
and I'm gonna need the locking key
of your wheel nuts.

437
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,700
Do you have it?

438
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:30,075
Good question.

439
00:46:54,908 --> 00:46:56,533
- Yes?
- Hello, Will.

440
00:46:57,117 --> 00:46:58,450
Just wanted to thank you.

441
00:46:58,742 --> 00:47:00,783
You did a helluva job.
Walczak is dead.

442
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,700
And now you're done.
Have a great life.

443
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,992
- What's up, punk? Say something.
- Hey.

444
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,742
Hey!

445
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:13,158
Hey!

446
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:14,533
Come on, break it up! Come on.

447
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,533
- Break it up!
- Hands off me, faggot!

448
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:20,533
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get off me, man.

449
00:47:20,867 --> 00:47:21,867
Will, what's...?

450
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:26,450
Striking a student is a minimum
three weeks suspension.

451
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:27,825
Three weeks.

452
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:29,783
What the hell are you thinking, Will?

453
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,450
You're home early.

454
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,367
Yeah, it was, uh

455
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:40,992
half day.

456
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:43,242
- Student conferences.
- That's funny

457
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:45,950
because Jimmy called me
to check on you.

458
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,158
What'd he say?

459
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:50,658
He said that you hit a student
and got suspended.

460
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:52,700
Yeah, well that kid is, uh...

461
00:47:52,992 --> 00:47:57,117
- he's just, uh, total mess.
- And that makes it right?

462
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,783
Thank you. Thank you, darling,
for your support.

463
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:01,783
- My support?
- Yes, your support.

464
00:48:02,658 --> 00:48:03,742
Here.

465
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:08,825
Where did you get this?

466
00:48:10,742 --> 00:48:11,950
Where did you get it?

467
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:16,825
- I can't tell you that.
- You can't tell me.

468
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:18,450
I just...

469
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:21,700
I can't. I can't tell you all right?

470
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,075
- It's not...
- I'm going to rehearsal.

471
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:40,158
Mahalia Jackson Theater, please.

472
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:42,867
Laura?

473
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:51,200
Mr. Gerard, I'm Detective Rudeski.
This is Detective Green.

474
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,658
Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest
for the murder of Alan Marsh.

475
00:48:54,742 --> 00:48:55,617
Who?

476
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,242
Turn around, please, sir.

477
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:00,575
Who's Alan Marsh?

478
00:49:10,783 --> 00:49:11,658
To the left.

479
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:19,283
Hand over your cellphone, please.

480
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,992
You're gonna hold this here.
Stand up straight.

481
00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:24,158
- Go ahead.
- No, it's preposterous.

482
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm a school teacher.
I teach English at Rampart High.

483
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:29,783
I am not a murderer.

484
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,033
- How do you know Alan Marsh?
- I don't.

485
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,700
I want you to talks
a look at something.

486
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,575
That's you, right, Mr. Gerard?

487
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,325
Yes.

488
00:49:49,242 --> 00:49:51,742
And here comes Alan Marsh.

489
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,200
Now, how do you know Mr. Marsh?

490
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:01,575
- I don't.
- That's you again.

491
00:50:03,658 --> 00:50:06,700
Man, you're clearly distressed.
Right?

492
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:08,825
What happened down there?

493
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,158
There is another camera
that shows the ramp under the freeway.

494
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:15,658
Good, good because that
all proves I didn't kill him.

495
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:19,825
Unfortunately someone forgot
to put the tape in the machine.

496
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,033
Empty, no tape.

497
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,033
What were you doing on that ramp?

498
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:27,700
Yeah, I took the bus to work.

499
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:29,492
Someone slashed my tires.

500
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:31,992
You can go and check if you like.

501
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:34,492
Let me show you something else.

502
00:50:34,825 --> 00:50:36,575
Alan Marsh's cellphone.

503
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:47,700
Now what were you doing there
at the zoo?

504
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:57,492
I never saw that man

505
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:00,075
until the day he died.

506
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,700
I swear it.

507
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:04,617
Is he gonna write
something bad about you?

508
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:08,950
- What do you mean?
- Investigative journalists like to pry.

509
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:13,450
He is a journalist?

510
00:51:14,492 --> 00:51:15,575
Look

511
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,825
why don't you walk us through
what happened?

512
00:51:22,242 --> 00:51:25,658
Will, here's the thing.

513
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:29,158
You tell us the truth.
We can help each other.

514
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,742
I want a lawyer.

515
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:47,992
Will Gerard, no priors

516
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:50,200
teaches high school English.

517
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:51,908
Married, no kids.

518
00:51:52,867 --> 00:51:55,325
Well, only, I guess,
semi-interesting thing...

519
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,533
is his wife, Laura Gerard,
was raped in September.

520
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:01,742
- Why would he wanna kill Marsh?
- Uh, we're getting there, right?

521
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:03,825
You got anything connected
with him and victim?

522
00:52:04,242 --> 00:52:06,575
- Yeah.
- Video of Gerard on the Marsh's phone.

523
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:08,700
It looks like Marsh
has been following him.

524
00:52:10,408 --> 00:52:11,742
Let me have a go at him.

525
00:52:12,283 --> 00:52:13,242
You give us an hour?

526
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:16,450
- He'll break soon, boss.
- I said I wanna go at him.

527
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:19,450
You got 23 unsolved up
there on the board.

528
00:52:19,575 --> 00:52:20,492
Work those.

529
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:24,533
- Twenty two actually.
- Well, look again, it's 23.

530
00:52:29,658 --> 00:52:33,533
Good afternoon, Mr. Gerard.
I'm Lieutenant Durgan.

531
00:52:35,867 --> 00:52:40,200
Let me ask you a few simple questions,
just procedure. Nothing to worry about.

532
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,325
I wanna lawyer.

533
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,992
The day after Monday is...?

534
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,075
I want a lawyer.

535
00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:56,658
You haven't been charged
with anything, Mr. Gerard.

536
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,367
The day after Monday is...?

537
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:00,867
Tuesday.

538
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,367
My favorite color is...?

539
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:05,158
What the hell is this?

540
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:07,408
My favorite color is...?

541
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:10,533
My favorite color?
Uh, purple.

542
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:12,450
Purple.

543
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:16,325
If a baby is unhappy, he...?

544
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:18,658
He cries.

545
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:20,783
The hungry rabbit?

546
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,825
Jumps.

547
00:53:29,908 --> 00:53:31,367
The hungry rabbit jumps.

548
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:34,408
Got it.

549
00:53:43,158 --> 00:53:44,117
Get up.

550
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:47,408
Put that on.
I'm gonna leave the room.

551
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,950
Wait 10 seconds
and get the fuck outta here.

552
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:51,533
And then what?

553
00:53:51,825 --> 00:53:54,242
If you don't go now,
you won't make it through the night.

554
00:53:54,617 --> 00:53:57,033
They'll kill you
and make it look like a suicide.

555
00:53:57,617 --> 00:53:59,033
Shut the door behind you.

556
00:54:32,992 --> 00:54:34,325
Hold on a sec?

557
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,700
Afternoon.

558
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,575
Lieutenant,
you move Will Gerard to Holding?

559
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,033
- No, he's still in three.
- I was just there. It's empty.

560
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:35,200
- The fuck you're talking about?
- He's not in there.

561
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:37,658
What do you think he's hiding?

562
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:43,992
I don't know.
I've never seen him like that before.

563
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:46,742
An affair?

564
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:48,325
No.

565
00:55:49,992 --> 00:55:52,783
No, it's something worse than that.

566
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:55,700
Call him. Tell him, you want some answers,
or you're not coming home.

567
00:55:59,867 --> 00:56:01,200
I'll give you some privacy.

568
00:56:11,283 --> 00:56:12,200
Homicide.

569
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,617
- Who is this?
- Ma'am, this is Detective Rudeski.

570
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:19,867
Is this Will Gerard's wife?

571
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:38,283
Hey, it's Trudy.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

572
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:39,867
Trudy, it's Will.

573
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:41,700
I need you to do me a favor.

574
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:44,825
I need you to tell Laura in person,
not on the phone.

575
00:56:46,242 --> 00:56:47,992
Tell her I will try to meet her
at rehearsal tomorrow.

576
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,242
- Leave the corner now.
- Tell her, I'm...

577
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:51,367
- Leave the corner.
...I'm okay.

578
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,408
All right, come on, buddy.
You're going in.

579
00:56:53,783 --> 00:56:55,158
Just sleep it off tonight.
Let's go.

580
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:57,825
Come on.
Get your body bag.

581
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:37,783
Hey, this is Alan Marsh.
This is my website.

582
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,158
Click around on things you
wanna look at have some fun.

583
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,908
You'll find my very byline
my very second byline.

584
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,575
Hey, man.

585
00:58:01,075 --> 00:58:04,158
You skipped school.
They can kiss my ass.

586
00:58:05,117 --> 00:58:07,992
Damn. You decide.
You decide right there. Yeah.

587
00:58:12,908 --> 00:58:16,033
Now you know vandalizing
the school property is illegal, Edwin.

588
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:19,242
What you're doing here, Mr. G?
I heard you got busted by the cops.

589
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,117
What did you do for,
sucker punching a kid?

590
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:23,867
No.

591
00:58:24,158 --> 00:58:26,408
Murder, first degree.

592
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:30,575
I'm sorry I hit it you, Edwin.
I really am.

593
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:33,117
It's all right.
Maybe I had it coming.

594
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,367
Can you do me a favor, Edwin?

595
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:37,117
I never saw you, Mr. G.

596
00:58:37,825 --> 00:58:38,867
You never saw us.

597
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,158
Right.

598
00:59:48,575 --> 00:59:49,533
Laura.

599
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:58,950
Will.

600
01:00:01,408 --> 01:00:02,658
What the hell is happening?

601
01:00:11,992 --> 01:00:14,617
What is and you're sure
we can't go to the cops?

602
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:17,450
- We tell them everything.
- Some of them are cops.

603
01:00:18,117 --> 01:00:20,992
You can't stay at home.
Go to Lafitte's Hotel,

604
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,700
wait for me there.
Use this call me. The number's in it.

605
01:00:27,575 --> 01:00:29,825
Here. It's all I've got.

606
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:31,450
Take this.

607
01:00:35,992 --> 01:00:36,908
Where it come from?

608
01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:39,575
I was scared.

609
01:00:40,033 --> 01:00:41,825
I should never have put us in this mess.

610
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:44,908
If they had asked me that night,
I would have done the same thing.

611
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:48,033
Will, what are you gonna do?

612
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:50,117
- Where you're gonna go?
- Cops.

613
01:00:51,867 --> 01:00:53,867
Those were the same guys
that came to our apartment.

614
01:00:54,158 --> 01:00:55,950
You have to go. Go!

615
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:01,158
Mrs. Gerard.

616
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:02,492
What do you want now?

617
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:05,908
A little follow up. Has your husband
tried to contact you, Mrs. Gerard?

618
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:08,658
- No, he has not.
- I find that hard to believe.

619
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,367
- Do you?
- You seemed a little tense.

620
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:15,325
Yeah, I'm a little tense, Detective.

621
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,825
In my situation, should I be relaxed?

622
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:20,992
I have rehearsal.

623
01:01:22,117 --> 01:01:23,825
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

624
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:26,033
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

625
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,992
Nobody takes a story like you.
You were the best.

626
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:33,742
But Jesus, Marshy, you could have picked
a more dignified way to go out.

627
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,408
You escaped from a Chechen jail.

628
01:01:36,742 --> 01:01:38,367
You survived your own divorce,
for crying out loud.

629
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:39,908
Just barely.

630
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:43,867
And that piece you wrote about
the music industry that was beautiful.

631
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,492
Gorgeous story.
Marshy, here's to you.

632
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,825
- You're the real deal.
- Amen, brother.

633
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,283
You redheaded, asshole!

634
01:01:50,617 --> 01:01:53,533
- Here, here!
- Here's a little music for Marshy.

635
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:29,117
- We're having a toast to Marshy.
- Marshy!

636
01:02:29,742 --> 01:02:31,783
And to our new best friend
as long as he keeps buying.

637
01:02:32,075 --> 01:02:33,158
- Will.
- Will.

638
01:02:36,033 --> 01:02:39,450
- Marshy was a great guy, huh?
- He was one hell of a journalist.

639
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,075
A couple of weeks ago
we had lunch and, uh

640
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,908
- weirdest thing happened.
- What's that, he paid?

641
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:52,200
No, he, uh, he tells me
about the secret organization. Some...

642
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:55,158
group that claims to hand out justice

643
01:02:55,533 --> 01:02:57,783
you know,
when the justice system fails and...

644
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,325
- He told you that?
- Oh, it's true.

645
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:02,700
They killed him,
made it look like a suicide.

646
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:04,658
You better watch your back there, Will.

647
01:03:04,992 --> 01:03:07,867
Because anybody associated
with Marshy is a marked man.

648
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:11,242
- And why do they want him dead?
- Because...

649
01:03:11,992 --> 01:03:13,908
Joe, you tell him.

650
01:03:14,617 --> 01:03:16,367
Because Alan Marsh...

651
01:03:18,033 --> 01:03:19,200
was an alien.

652
01:03:19,617 --> 01:03:23,533
He was sent here as a scout
to prepare for the invasion of earth.

653
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:27,700
So, Will you... you are now obligated
to buy us another round.

654
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:28,825
Absolutely.

655
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:30,450
Augie!

656
01:03:40,742 --> 01:03:43,533
Don't worry about it, Will.
He's been telling that crazy story to everybody.

657
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:46,867
He went so far as even hiding
his own research.

658
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:49,867
Where'd he hide it?

659
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,867
Well, that would be the $64-million
question, wouldn't it?

660
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,908
Cheers.

661
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:57,325
Well, he was obsessed.

662
01:03:57,825 --> 01:04:00,742
I mean he said he was about to
make that all stuff public.

663
01:04:00,867 --> 01:04:03,783
The truth is, I mean, Alan...

664
01:04:04,117 --> 01:04:07,783
- he had some issues.
- Yeah, it got worse.

665
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:09,783
One of the sources got bumped off.

666
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:13,408
And after that, I don't know, man.
He just he became like, uh...

667
01:04:13,742 --> 01:04:14,992
- Different man.
- Yeah.

668
01:04:15,367 --> 01:04:18,700
Jumpy, paranoid, lying son of a bitch.

669
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:20,825
Just sort of like you, Will.

670
01:04:21,742 --> 01:04:23,658
So what are you, a cop?

671
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:26,908
Next time you wanna come snooping
around show your badge

672
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,200
and don't pretend to be his friend.

673
01:04:40,825 --> 01:04:41,783
Will.

674
01:04:46,533 --> 01:04:48,200
- Stop him!
- Hey, Will!

675
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:51,033
Will, come back. I wanna talk to you.

676
01:04:52,783 --> 01:04:54,408
Go after him. Get in the car.

677
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,242
Go, get him.

678
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:36,658
He went over himself.

679
01:05:40,158 --> 01:05:41,575
Get down. Get down below.

680
01:05:43,783 --> 01:05:44,742
Will?

681
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:49,533
No need to run, Will.

682
01:05:50,992 --> 01:05:53,117
I have something that
I think you may want.

683
01:05:58,242 --> 01:06:00,742
It's the tape from the security camera.
I just wanna show you.

684
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:03,742
I have it right here.

685
01:06:04,658 --> 01:06:06,325
Why don't you come out?
I'll show it to you.

686
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:07,700
Come on, Will.

687
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:12,825
Will, come on out.
It's very clear you didn't kill anybody.

688
01:06:14,283 --> 01:06:15,658
I just want to sell it to you.

689
01:06:16,533 --> 01:06:17,617
Will?

690
01:06:27,408 --> 01:06:28,408
Hey!

691
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:09,408
Goddammit!

692
01:07:15,617 --> 01:07:16,450
Mrs. Gerard...

693
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,658
I'm Detective Sims of the New Orleans
Police Department.

694
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:20,158
Would you come with me, please?

695
01:07:20,617 --> 01:07:22,075
- Now what?
- Your husband, Mrs. Gerard.

696
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,908
We just found out some new information
that indicates he's innocent.

697
01:07:25,117 --> 01:07:26,033
You do?

698
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:28,575
We need your help to get him out
of this mess. Come with me, please.

699
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:29,908
Of course.

700
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,242
So what's this new evidence?

701
01:07:53,075 --> 01:07:55,700
- Excuse me?
- You said there was new evidence.

702
01:07:56,283 --> 01:07:58,533
We'll show you
when we get down the station.

703
01:08:27,658 --> 01:08:29,117
Man, mother fucker!

704
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:58,408
The wireless customer
you are calling is not available.

705
01:09:58,492 --> 01:09:59,992
Please try again later.

706
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:11,908
Hey!

707
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:17,325
In a hyphenated compound situation
do you capitalize the second word?

708
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Only if it's a noun and the words
have equal weight

709
01:11:22,075 --> 01:11:27,325
like, "Homeland Security".
If it's a participle modifying the first word then

710
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:30,867
you better,
uh... you better keep it lower case.

711
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:36,033
Huh, yeah, it makes sense.
Thanks.

712
01:11:55,408 --> 01:11:58,992
Edmund Burke.
"A philosophical enquiry."

713
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:08,200
It is not what a lawyer tells me
I may do but what

714
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:12,367
humanity, reason,
and justice tell me I ought to do.

715
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:28,867
There's a guy in the news room
going through Alan Marsh's desk.

716
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,867
I've never seen him before.

717
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,117
Look.

718
01:12:32,867 --> 01:12:35,492
Where'd he go?
I'm telling you he was right there.

719
01:13:47,867 --> 01:13:51,242
Eight sixty five, eight sixty five.
Eight sixty five,

720
01:13:51,825 --> 01:13:54,283
Here we go 865.
Be right back, sir.

721
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,492
Thank you, sir.
By the way, this is a nice car.

722
01:14:18,908 --> 01:14:19,825
Thank you.

723
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,825
Paris Truck Stop.

724
01:14:49,242 --> 01:14:51,158
Paris Truck Stop.

725
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,992
Paris Truck Stop.
Paris Truck Stop.

726
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:56,408
Twenty one and one Paris Road.

727
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,658
All right, let's try that.

728
01:15:23,533 --> 01:15:25,492
I wonder if you could help me.

729
01:15:26,075 --> 01:15:29,783
I worked for the New Orleans Post.
And I'm looking a missing colleague.

730
01:15:30,075 --> 01:15:32,825
I know he would come here
to get gas and supplies.

731
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:35,242
Do you recognize him?

732
01:15:39,575 --> 01:15:42,533
I've seen him.
He goes fishing on the weekends.

733
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,992
He keeps his boat in one of those
units over there.

734
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:46,617
Which unit?

735
01:15:47,783 --> 01:15:52,117
22, I think it is.
But I haven't seen him in a few days.

736
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:54,117
The truth is, uh

737
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:58,992
well, he owes me quite a bit of money.
Is there any way to get in that unit?

738
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:02,283
Well, uh, no, I don't have the keys.

739
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,700
I mean those storage units
have nothing to do with me.

740
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:10,450
So there's no other possible way
I can in there and get what's owed me?

741
01:16:13,283 --> 01:16:15,867
Well, it looks like they're made out
of some pretty cheap shit.

742
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:18,658
I saw some guy accidentally
backed into one.

743
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:20,783
It went right through the door.

744
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:22,367
Really?

745
01:16:24,575 --> 01:16:28,033
- So he went right through it?
- Right through.

746
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,450
I really appreciate your understanding
of my situation.

747
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,992
Well, we're all God's children.

748
01:18:04,658 --> 01:18:05,575
Hey, good morning.

749
01:21:40,367 --> 01:21:42,658
You know if they find out
I'm talking to you, they're gonna kill me.

750
01:21:42,825 --> 01:21:44,742
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

751
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:48,117
It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do

752
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:51,325
but it's what humanity,
reason and justice tell me I ought to do.

753
01:21:51,617 --> 01:21:53,242
Edmund Burke said it.

754
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,783
Hungry-Humanity.
Rabbit-Reason.

755
01:21:57,283 --> 01:21:59,742
Jumps-Justice.
Humanity, reason, justice.

756
01:22:00,117 --> 01:22:04,325
Well, it was just supposed to be the worst.
You know rapists, murderers

757
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:06,825
child molesters. But then...

758
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,242
Simon he started widening the net.

759
01:22:10,533 --> 01:22:12,325
Anybody he designated as
"unworthy of living"

760
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,742
Who's Simon?

761
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:16,408
He runs my cell.
I don't know his real name.

762
01:22:16,742 --> 01:22:20,825
- Tell me about how your cell works.
- Uh, it's just handful of men.

763
01:22:21,408 --> 01:22:22,867
Uh, Simon gives us our orders.

764
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:27,742
He gets his from higher up. I mean
the idea is that if complications arise

765
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,325
then the cell can be cut off
without a threat to the organization.

766
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:34,117
We also use people
who have made a deal with us

767
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:35,700
who owes us a favor.

768
01:22:36,075 --> 01:22:37,158
Hey, look

769
01:22:37,658 --> 01:22:40,283
I got into this because I was sick
of seeing the city rot.

770
01:22:41,325 --> 01:22:44,783
I wanted to help. I wanted to
make it a livable place for my family

771
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:47,575
my two little girls.

772
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,992
Okay? But now it's... it's wrong.

773
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,825
Simon's out of control
and I have no way

774
01:22:54,325 --> 01:22:56,408
for talking anybody higher
in the organization.

775
01:22:58,158 --> 01:22:58,992
Oh, god.

776
01:22:59,158 --> 01:23:01,242
- What is it, Mr. Bourdette?
- I can't. This is wrong.

777
01:23:01,825 --> 01:23:02,658
Whoa!

778
01:23:02,992 --> 01:23:03,908
Mr. Bourdette?

779
01:23:09,867 --> 01:23:12,825
November 3rd, this is Alan Marsh.

780
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,367
Will, Jesus, man,
everybody's looking...

781
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:00,200
- Christ, what the hell is going on?
- I know, Jimmy.

782
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:02,575
- What the fuck do you know?
- I saw the pictures.

783
01:24:03,075 --> 01:24:04,158
You and Simon.

784
01:24:04,658 --> 01:24:06,367
- You're part of this.
- Look, okay. Will,

785
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:10,575
okay, listen to me, okay?
I'm a part of the organization, okay?

786
01:24:10,908 --> 01:24:13,242
I joined 15 years ago
when my brother got killed.

787
01:24:13,575 --> 01:24:17,033
They didn't even test the bastard.
I had to do something so I'm sorry.

788
01:24:17,533 --> 01:24:21,492
The fucking scumbag that raped Laura
I wanted him crucified.

789
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,283
Who set me up for the murder
of that reporter, huh?

790
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:26,617
- Was it you, you fuck?
- I called Durgan

791
01:24:27,158 --> 01:24:28,950
told him to let you go.
That was me.

792
01:24:29,783 --> 01:24:31,533
What's Simon's real name?

793
01:24:34,617 --> 01:24:36,033
Will, I can't tell you that.

794
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:38,867
You have no idea
what this guy is capable of.

795
01:24:40,908 --> 01:24:42,325
His name.

796
01:24:43,617 --> 01:24:45,825
- I'm your fucking friend.
- No!

797
01:24:46,742 --> 01:24:49,992
You're Simon's friend.
You tell me his fucking name.

798
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:51,658
What's his name?

799
01:25:30,867 --> 01:25:32,408
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

800
01:25:32,867 --> 01:25:34,492
- Open the seatbelt.
- Get out of the car!

801
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:36,033
Okay.

802
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,033
Fuck you pedophile.

803
01:25:40,117 --> 01:25:41,158
The hungry rabbit jumps.

804
01:25:41,742 --> 01:25:44,117
- The hungry rabbit jumps.
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

805
01:25:50,783 --> 01:25:52,283
How long have you been following me?

806
01:25:52,783 --> 01:25:53,783
Answer me!

807
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:57,117
Not long. Just from that house
on Seaborne Street.

808
01:25:57,658 --> 01:25:59,158
I was just told to wait for you there.

809
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:01,200
And if you turned up
and I was to follow you and...

810
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:02,783
Why did you agree to kill me?

811
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,450
I owed him.

812
01:26:04,908 --> 01:26:06,867
He killed the man
who murdered my sister.

813
01:26:07,117 --> 01:26:07,992
Simon?

814
01:26:08,492 --> 01:26:10,825
- What's his mobile number?
- It's in my cellphone.

815
01:26:11,283 --> 01:26:12,242
Get up.

816
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,492
- Get up!
- Don't kill me, please. Please don't kill...

817
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:17,658
Get up! Give me the phone.

818
01:26:19,533 --> 01:26:21,450
Get outta here, Go!

819
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,200
What does hungry rabbit jumps mean?

820
01:26:55,325 --> 01:26:57,492
"It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do..."

821
01:27:00,533 --> 01:27:01,242
Yeah?

822
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,075
Eugene Cook

823
01:27:03,617 --> 01:27:05,825
head of the RJ Allen Group.

824
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,658
- Will?
- You framed me.

825
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,325
You framed me for the murder
of Alan Marsh.

826
01:27:10,783 --> 01:27:12,242
I also know that

827
01:27:12,575 --> 01:27:15,450
you had Bourdette killed.
Watch.

828
01:27:21,867 --> 01:27:23,408
The hungry rabbit jumps mean...

829
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:27,575
"It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do but it's what..."

830
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:29,367
And there's more.

831
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,033
Very resourceful.

832
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:33,658
I want the security tape
from the overpass.

833
01:27:34,117 --> 01:27:35,742
The one that shows I didn't kill Marsh.

834
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,325
So I've got something you want

835
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:39,283
and now it looks like
you've got something I want.

836
01:27:39,408 --> 01:27:40,492
We should trade.

837
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,325
Here's what's going to happen.

838
01:27:43,742 --> 01:27:45,325
You're going to meet me
at the Super dome

839
01:27:45,783 --> 01:27:47,075
five o'clock tonight.

840
01:27:48,575 --> 01:27:49,533
You bring the tape.

841
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,617
- Eugene Cook.
- There'll be a prepaid ticket in your name.

842
01:27:57,033 --> 01:27:58,450
Go to your assigned seat

843
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:00,950
and wait for me there.

844
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:47,617
Hey, Trudy, I need to talk to you.
Can I come in?

845
01:28:48,117 --> 01:28:49,242
Yeah, sure.

846
01:28:51,867 --> 01:28:54,658
By hiding out, she is not helping Will.

847
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,492
And she may be charged with aiding
and abetting a fugitive

848
01:28:57,908 --> 01:28:59,033
or even as an accessory to murder.

849
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:00,575
- Do you...
- I'm sorry, Jimmy. I don't know.

850
01:29:00,783 --> 01:29:02,658
She's not answering her cell.
She's not returning my calls.

851
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:04,283
You're her best friend, right?

852
01:29:04,367 --> 01:29:06,992
You know her better than
maybe anyone else in the whole world.

853
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:09,658
If you were in her shoes,
where would you go?

854
01:29:22,492 --> 01:29:23,533
Will?

855
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:28,450
- Who is it?
- Laura? Where's Jimmy?

856
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:31,825
- How did you...?
- Can I come in?

857
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:32,867
Where's Will?

858
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:47,325
Will?

859
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:50,992
I'm here.

860
01:29:52,075 --> 01:29:53,825
- Where are you?
- Get up on your seat

861
01:29:54,033 --> 01:29:55,533
and head towards the concourse.

862
01:29:55,992 --> 01:30:00,158
- What?
- Get up and head toward the concourse.

863
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,992
- Yeah?
- Go out on to the concourse.

864
01:30:23,367 --> 01:30:25,742
You'll see a men's room.
Go in.

865
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:36,742
Yeah?

866
01:30:37,367 --> 01:30:38,283
Take a leak.

867
01:30:52,367 --> 01:30:54,200
- Yeah?
- Go to the hot-dog stand

868
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:56,325
and buy yourself a hot-dog.

869
01:31:14,867 --> 01:31:15,867
Having fun?

870
01:31:32,283 --> 01:31:33,033
Look at you

871
01:31:33,367 --> 01:31:36,450
- trying not to kill a child pornographer.
- He wasn't a child pornographer.

872
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,242
Oh, but you didn't know that.

873
01:31:38,908 --> 01:31:40,325
You must be a good man, Will.

874
01:31:40,742 --> 01:31:42,033
An endangered species.

875
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,950
- But where is the actual security tape?
- Yeah?

876
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:49,325
Good.
Sent me a picture.

877
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,742
It's with your wife.

878
01:31:57,408 --> 01:31:59,825
This time Jimmy's done a good job.
Now where's my DVD?

879
01:32:01,325 --> 01:32:02,408
I don't have it on me.

880
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,117
I'll tell you where it is
when I get my wife.

881
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:13,242
Well, she's in the abandoned mall
next door.

882
01:32:13,742 --> 01:32:14,992
Let's go see her.

883
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:33,367
You believe they
haven't fixed this place up

884
01:32:34,033 --> 01:32:35,908
all these years after the hurricane?

885
01:32:50,075 --> 01:32:51,033
Laura.

886
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:54,617
Sorry, buddy.
You left me no choice.

887
01:32:55,117 --> 01:32:56,033
Let her go.

888
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:02,283
Did you make copies of this thing?

889
01:33:02,617 --> 01:33:04,033
- No.
- Now that's good.

890
01:33:04,575 --> 01:33:07,492
'Cause if you did, I'm gonna fly to Philly
and find your sister and her two little kids

891
01:33:07,742 --> 01:33:10,283
- and tell them a really scary bedtime story.
- You have what you want.

892
01:33:10,992 --> 01:33:12,033
Please let her go.

893
01:33:13,575 --> 01:33:16,117
What I do is so important
to jeopardize. I'm sorry.

894
01:33:16,658 --> 01:33:18,867
So you and Laura are not gonna
walk outta here today.

895
01:33:20,908 --> 01:33:22,075
You're insane.

896
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:27,033
What did you say?

897
01:33:27,492 --> 01:33:30,283
I said I think you're sick.

898
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,408
On the contrary, I am very well.

899
01:33:35,075 --> 01:33:36,242
You don't see it, do you?

900
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,492
The city and how close
we are to absolute chaos?

901
01:33:41,117 --> 01:33:42,783
Jimmy sees it.
Don't you, Jimmy?

902
01:33:44,367 --> 01:33:45,825
Sick, I'm not sick.

903
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:48,825
The sick ones are sitting on their fat,
fucking asses eating and

904
01:33:49,033 --> 01:33:51,658
drinking and fucking themselves
into a stupor.

905
01:33:52,367 --> 01:33:55,825
Polluting the world without a second
thought while it goes down the toilet.

906
01:33:56,075 --> 01:33:58,283
Nobody wants
to do the nasty work, Will.

907
01:33:58,825 --> 01:34:00,075
You know the shit that
we all just think about.

908
01:34:00,283 --> 01:34:02,533
Most good citizens
are just along for the ride

909
01:34:02,867 --> 01:34:05,325
and they fucking bitch and moan
and complain about everything

910
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,700
when it doesn't work out.

911
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:08,992
But not me.

912
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,575
Get it done.

913
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,492
Will!

914
01:34:26,033 --> 01:34:27,200
What the fuck, Jimmy?

915
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:30,908
You promised not to hurt them!

916
01:34:31,492 --> 01:34:34,908
We didn't get into this organization
to kill innocent people.

917
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,283
Laura, run!

918
01:34:44,241 --> 01:34:45,241
You're happy now?

919
01:35:44,866 --> 01:35:45,825
Will!

920
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,075
Will!

921
01:36:54,908 --> 01:36:56,825
So Jimmy's dead, huh?

922
01:36:57,366 --> 01:36:58,783
Eugene Cook killed him.

923
01:37:07,033 --> 01:37:08,866
Who killed Eugene Cook?

924
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:11,033
I did.

925
01:37:12,866 --> 01:37:14,116
I don't think so.

926
01:37:17,033 --> 01:37:18,158
Here's what happened.

927
01:37:19,075 --> 01:37:22,325
Eugene Cook
and Jimmy killed each other.

928
01:37:23,116 --> 01:37:25,116
I don't even think you two were here.

929
01:37:28,908 --> 01:37:31,825
Simple case of a dead man
killing a dead man.

930
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:37,200
You don't suppose I could interest you
in joining our organization.

931
01:37:38,116 --> 01:37:40,033
- No.
- You sure?

932
01:37:41,366 --> 01:37:43,908
Well, if you have a change of heart

933
01:37:44,575 --> 01:37:45,866
you know where to find me, right?

934
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:49,283
Now, I think you two better
get the hell outta here.

935
01:37:49,741 --> 01:37:50,700
Lieutenant.

936
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:53,908
The story you just told us

937
01:37:54,575 --> 01:37:56,158
is that how it's going to be?

938
01:37:57,408 --> 01:37:58,783
This is New Orleans.

939
01:37:59,408 --> 01:38:00,950
Yeah, that's how it's gonna be.

940
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,200
Go on.

941
01:38:13,283 --> 01:38:15,658
Breaking news, we're going live
to Catherine James

942
01:38:15,908 --> 01:38:16,825
on the scene.

943
01:38:17,533 --> 01:38:20,783
Detective, the bodies of four males were
found shot in that abandoned mall.

944
01:38:21,158 --> 01:38:22,450
Can you tell us what happened?

945
01:38:22,533 --> 01:38:25,491
I'm not gonna comment in the middle
of an ongoing investigation.

946
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:26,658
But I can tell you

947
01:38:26,741 --> 01:38:29,908
NOPD is gonna do everything
in its power to get to the bottom of it.

In other news, prosecutors have dropped all
charges against school teacher Will Gerard

949
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,283
who was accused of murdering
the New Orleans Post reporter Alan Marsh.

950
01:38:38,866 --> 01:38:41,200
A security tape uncovered by the NOPD

951
01:38:41,658 --> 01:38:44,325
clearly proves that Gerard
did not kill Alan Marsh

952
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:49,408
and, in fact, was trying to defend himself
when Marsh attacked him on the walkway

953
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,533
under the Broad Street overpass.

954
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:24,825
This is for you.
It's Marsh's research. It's just a start.

955
01:39:26,866 --> 01:39:27,700
Thanks, Will.

956
01:39:28,075 --> 01:39:31,491
He just scratched the surface
and I thought someone should finish it.

957
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:33,408
I'll give it a look.

958
01:39:34,908 --> 01:39:36,658
The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?
