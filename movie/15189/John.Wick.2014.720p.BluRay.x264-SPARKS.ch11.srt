世事无常.

人这辈子总会有几天像这样的日子

It's not what you did, son, that angers me so.

148
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,020
而是你对谁做了
It's who you did it to.

149
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:09,330
谁啊？他就是个无名小卒！
Who? The fucking nobody!

150
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,541
那个无名小卒是
That fuckin' nobody

151
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:15,931
John Wick!
is John Wick.

152
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,564
他曾与我们共事
He once was an associate of ours.

153
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:35,525
我叫他Baba Yago
They call him Baba Yaga.

154
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,906
夜魔？
The Boogeyman?

155
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:41,466
John不是那个夜魔
Well, John wasn't exactly The Boogeyman.

156
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:48,697
他是你派去杀夜魔的人
He was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogeyman.

157
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:53,918
哦
Oh.

158
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,228
John是一个被
John is a man of focus,

159
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,239
承诺
commitment,

160
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,159
纯粹意志所驱使的人
sheer will.

161
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,789
是你所不了解的
Something you know very little about.

162
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:07,960
我曾亲眼看到他在酒吧用铅笔杀了3个人
I once saw him kill three men in a bar.

163
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:10,031
用一枝铅笔
With a pencil.

164
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,582
就用他妈一枝
With a fuckin'...

165
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:16,542
铅笔
...pencil.

166
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,504
突然有一天他说要金盆洗手了
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

167
00:22:28,065 --> 00:22:29,774
当然是为了一个女人
It's over a woman, of course.

168
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:36,825
所以我和他做了笔交易
So I made a deal with him.

169
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:41,416
我给了他一个不可能完成的任务
I gave him an impossible task.

170
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:45,346
一个无人能完成的任务
A job no one could have pulled off.

171
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,448
他那天所埋下的尸体
The bodies he buried that day

172
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,079
成就了我们的今天
laid the foundation of what we are now.

173
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:02,930
那么 我的儿子
And then, my son,

174
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:06,050
就在他妻子死了的几天后
a few days after his wife died,

175
00:23:07,492 --> 00:23:08,510
你却偷了他的车
you steal his car

176
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,771
还杀了他的狗
and kill his fuckin' dog.

177
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:14,608
父亲 我可以搞定这件事
Father, I can make this right.

178
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:15,833
哦
Oh...

179
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:17,602
你有什么打算
How do you plan that?

180
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,462
搞定由我所挑起的事
By finishing what I started.

181
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,126
他有听到我说的话了吗？
What the... Did he hear a fucking word I said?

182
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:25,523
Iosef! Iosef! 听着！
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!

183
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:28,585
什么？
Huh?

184
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,325
John会过来找你寻仇
John will come for you.

185
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:37,315
而你什么都做不了
And you will do nothing,

186
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:39,176
因为你本就一事无成
because you can do nothing.

187
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:41,456
滚出我的视线！
So get the fuck out of my sight!

188
00:24:07,803 --> 00:24:08,911
你好 John
Hello, John.

189
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:14,042
我听说了你妻子的事了 我很抱歉
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.

190
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,051
节哀顺变
My condolences.

191
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:21,574
这似乎就是命运 或是偶然
It seems to be fate, or happenstance

192
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:24,965
或只是纯粹运气不好
or just bad fuckin' luck caused our paths to cross once again.

193
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:30,335
John?

194
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:37,507
我们不要被自己不好的天性所驱使
Let us not resort to our baser instincts

195
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,207
让我们像文明人一样来解决这件事
and handle this like civilized men, to move on...

196
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,939
他说了什么
What'd he say?

197
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:55,600
够了
Enough.

198
00:24:55,602 --> 00:24:56,590
天啊
Oh, God.

199
00:25:00,823 --> 00:25:01,794
准备好人手
Task your crew.

200
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:04,720
多少人？
How many?

201
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:06,042
你有多少人？
How many do you have?

202
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,340
晚上好 John
Evenin', John.

203
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,260
晚上好 Jimmy
Evenin', Jimmy.

204
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:55,581
有邻居抱怨噪音？
Noise complaint?

205
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:58,851
是的 是噪音
Noise complaint.

206
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:10,163
你又重新工作了？
You, uh, workin' again?

207
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,928
没有 只是理清点事情
No, just sortin' some stuff out.

208
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:14,484
啊 好吧
Ah, well...

209
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,324
那就这样吧
I'll leave you be, then.

210
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:20,245
晚安 John
Good night, John.

211
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:21,325
晚安 Jimmy
Good night, Jimmy.

212
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,889
我是Wick
This is Wick.

213
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:40,019
是的 John Wick
Yes, John Wick, that's right.

214
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,389
我想预定个12人份的晚餐
I'd like to make a dinner reservation for 12.

215
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:00,848
很高兴见到你 John
Good to see you, John.

216
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:02,522
Charlie.

217
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,131
你气色不错啊
You look good.

218
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:18,844
我就怕你早就不干这些了
And here I'd feared you'd left all this behind.

219
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:58,367
我以后还能再接到你电话吗？
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

220
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:01,579
再见 Carlie
Goodbye, Charlie.

221
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:04,033
John.

222
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:09,433
肯定是他干的
Of course he did.

223
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:13,304
悬赏John Wick
Put a contract on John Wick.

224
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:14,715
多少钱？
How much?

225
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:15,832
两百万
Two million.

226
00:31:22,728 --> 00:31:24,496
请说英语 Viggo
English, Viggo, please.

227
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:31,457
把Iosef放在红圈里 然后我们守株待兔
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.

228
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,518
为了什么？
For what?

229
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:36,469
当然是为了 John Wick
For John Wick, of course.

230
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:00,293
谢谢
Thank you.

231
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:04,223
您登门拜访 有何贵干？
To what do I owe this visit?

232
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:09,594
我有个工作给你做
I have a job for you.

233
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,205
你怎么不在电话里说
And I've got a phone.

234
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,245
Hmm.

235
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:17,455
我想要当面给你
I want to offer you this face to face

236
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:20,155
鉴于你可能觉得这有点私人
seeing as how you might find it personal.

237
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:24,537
你会为了两百万杀了John Wick吗？
Would you kill John Wick for two million dollars?

238
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:30,207
毕竟 你是他最亲密的人
After all, you were close.

239
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,599
这悬赏只面向我一人吗？
Is the contract exclusive?

240
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,219
不 面向所有人
No, it's open.

241
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,168
这只是时间问题 得马上解决
It's a timely matter, it has to be handled quickly.

242
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,480
我考虑下
Consider it done.

243
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,080
谢谢 Macus
Thank you, Marcus.

244
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,241
我就知道我能信任你 谢谢那杯酒
I know I can trust you. Thanks for the drink.

245
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,590
918号房 祝您入住愉快

246
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:40,850
谢谢

247
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:44,223
很高心见到你 John
Good seeing you again, John.

248
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,131
Perkins.
Perkins.

249
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:50,752
您要入住两晚吗
I have you for two nights.

250
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:52,672
看情况 可能久点
Depending on business, it may be more.

251
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,173
当然 先生
Of course, sir.

252
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,913
这里什么时候装修过了？
So when did the old place get a facelift?

253
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,674
大概在4年前
Around four years ago.

254
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:01,374
我保证你 先生 这里没多大变化
But I assure you, sir, she really hasn't changed much.

255
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:02,454
还是同一个主人？
Same owner?

256
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:03,864
是的
Same owner.

257
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:12,236
818号房
Room 818.

258
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:16,406
和往常一样
And, as always,

259
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:20,576
很荣幸您又入住 Wick先生
it is a pleasure having you with us again, Mr. Wick.

260
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:36,881
你在干什么 John?
What are you doing, John?

261
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,250
看着你
Looking at you.

262
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,417
到这来
Come here.

263
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,565
你好 Winston
Hello, Winston.

264
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:08,896
Jonathan
Jonathan.

265
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:12,826
据我回忆
Now, as I recall,

266
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:14,687
你是不是就是那个
weren't you the one tasked to dole out

267
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:16,577
打架从来不输的人?
the beatings, not receive them?

268
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,927
差不多吧
Rusty, I guess.

269
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,358
您有何贵干？
To what do we owe the pleasure?

270
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:23,599
Iosef Tarasov.
Iosef Tarasov.

271
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:25,998
他怎么了
What about him?

272
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,116
我想和他谈谈
I'd like to talk with him.

273
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,679
谈谈 哈
A talk, you say.

274
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:35,241
我对你这种说辞很熟悉, Johnathon
I'm familiar with the parlance, Jonathan.

275
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:38,361
我想要问问你
I want to ask you this.

276
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,041
Have you returned to the fold?

277
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:43,432
只是拜访
Just visiting.

278
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:45,322
那你有想过吗
Have you thought this through?

279
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:48,742
彻头彻尾的
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

280
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:52,253
你躲了一次
You got out once.

281
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,504
你陷的太深了
You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond,

282
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:59,304
你兴许能找到拜托的方法
you may well find something reaches out

283
00:37:59,307 --> 00:38:01,435
但你只会越陷越深
and drags you back into its depths.

284
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:02,575
我到哪儿去找他?

285
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:06,086
嘿.

286
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,456
Wick在大陆酒店里.

287
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,287
欢迎回家, John.

288
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,411
我们有人愿意帮我们摆平他
We have a contact there who's willing to take him out for us.

289
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:16,497
是吗?
Yeah?

290
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,078
真无耻.
How Bracen.

291
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:23,668
如果他们敢于破坏酒店的规矩
If they're willing to break the rules of Continental,

292
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,079
双倍悬赏金
double the bounty.

293
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:27,359
你知道这的规矩的
You know the rules.

294
00:38:27,362 --> 00:38:29,250
别在我这儿做坏事
No business can be conducted on these premises

295
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:32,340
以避免严重惩罚.
Lest incurring heavy penalties

296

先喝一杯
Have a drink

297

然后放松

298
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:42,961
现在

299

这是私事
It's personal.

300
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:56,194
我的天啊! Jonathan!
Holy shit! Jonathan!

301
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:58,234
嘿, Addy. 我的天啊！

302
00:38:58,237 --> 00:39:00,816
多久没见面了？四年？
How long has it been? Four years?

303
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,286
五年多吧
Five and change.

304
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:05,376
告诉，在那边的生活怎么样？
So tell me, how was life on the other side?

305
00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:07,176
很好，Addy
It was good, Addy.

306
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,826
比我应有的生活好多了
Far better than I deserved.

307

Vulnerable.

312

我退休了
I'm retired.

313
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:25,720
只要你在这喝酒 就代表着你没有
Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not.

314
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,959
还和往常一样？
Usual? Please.

315
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:36,011
我请客
Compliments of the house.

316
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:38,292
谢谢
Thanks.

317
00:41:34,143 --> 00:41:35,791
你看到那女孩的胸了吗？

Lita最好今晚不要工作

319

你是不是怕那啥夜魔了？
Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman?

320

我没有
I'm not.

321
00:41:58,297 --> 00:42:01,026
不，你应该感到害怕
No. But you should be.

322

我想再喝一杯

你为什么今晚不休息一下

我能为您效劳吗？
How may I be of service?

342
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,498
医生在吗？
Is the doctor in?

343
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,178
是的 先生 在24/7

346
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,349
我很抱歉的说没人会那么好
I'm sorry to say that no one's that good.

347
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:07,800
我想是的

348
00:50:07,802 --> 00:50:10,410
您要喝一杯吗 先生？
May I suggest a drink, sir.

349
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:11,528
波本威士忌
Bourbon, perhaps.

350
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,341
听起来不错
That sounds perfect.

351
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:29,734
我的情况怎么样？
So what sort of movement am I looking at?

352
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:32,194
如果你想要治愈的话
Well, if you're lookin' to heal,

353
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,365
你就得注意点
then keep it marginal.

354
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,445
不过 你要是依然还有
However, if you still have...

355
00:50:37,447 --> 00:50:38,957
事要办的话
...business to attend to,

356
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:43,841
先用这两个
take two of these beforehand.

357
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:47,107
要不然的阵线会崩开 你又会流血
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed,

358
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,737
但是你还依然可以稳健自如
but you'll have full function.

359
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,718
你需要一些止疼的吗？
Do you need anything for the pain?

360
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:55,268
不 我能搞定
No, I've got that covered.

361
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:56,749
嘿 John

我以为我能进来呢
I thought I'd let myself in.

364
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,640
我注意到了
I noticed.

365
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,542
我还不知道Perkins小姐能从床上下来少过三次呢
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get out of bed for less than three.

366
00:52:14,544 --> 00:52:16,312
Viggo给我四倍的价钱来破坏酒店的规矩
Viggo's giving me four to break hotel rules.

367
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:19,012
那很蠢 我保证你
That's unwise, I assure you.

368
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:25,463
你永远都是个娘们
You were always a pussy.

369
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:35,586
是吗？
Yes?

370
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,536
我很抱歉我现在给你打电话
I apologize for calling you at this hour,

371
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:40,357

你们楼层传来噪音的抱怨
from your floor concerning the noise.

373
00:53:44,168 --> 00:53:45,607
我很抱歉
My apologies.

我在处理一个不速之客

375

晚餐预定 也许？

00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,449
也许. 我会待会打给你
Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you.

Where's Viggo?

382
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:10,211
我才不告诉你呢！
I'm not telling you shit!

383
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:12,433
你想死在这儿吗？Perkins?
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

384
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:15,282
告诉我

这样对待女士？
Treat all your ladies like this?

416

你破坏了规矩
You've broken the rules.

420

去他的管理层
Fuck management.

423
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:17,545
别担心 扫地的会发现你的
Don't worry. Housekeeping will find you.

424
00:58:23,697 --> 00:58:25,286
尘归尘
Ashes to ashes.

425
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:27,777
我能从中恢复过来吗？
Can we recover from this?

426
00:58:27,778 --> 00:58:29,186
Viggo 你知道地下室里面有什么 对吧？
Viggo, you know what was in that vault, right?

427
00:58:29,188 --> 00:58:30,356
什么都没有
It was nothing.

428
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:35,427
靠！
Shit!

429
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:51,900
靠！
Come on!

430
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:04,483
我会这么说的 John
I'll say this, John.

431
01:00:04,485 --> 01:00:06,793
他们肯定会搞死你的
They sure as fuck broke the mold with you.

432
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:11,204
呀
Ay, ay...

433
01:00:19,307 --> 01:00:21,496
你总是如此的
You always had a certain...

434
01:00:22,908 --> 01:00:24,466
...大胆, 你知道吗.
...the audacity, you know.

435
01:00:25,398 --> 01:00:27,347
是吗？哦 是的
Right? Oh, yeah.

436
01:00:30,648 --> 01:00:34,577
我敢说说你还是老样子
I can say you're still very much the John Wick of old.

437
01:00:35,479 --> 01:00:36,469
是吗？
Am I?

438
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,499
人不怎么变化 你知道的
People don't change. You know that.

439
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:45,020
时间会
Times, they do.

440
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:51,622
你知道在地下室里有什么吗？
Do you know what was in that vault?

441
01:00:51,623 --> 01:00:53,541
艺术品，钞票，之类的可能没啥价值
Artwork, cash, not without its worth,

442
01:00:53,543 --> 01:00:56,001
但是我在这座城市里的干的坏事的
but the leverage I had on this city,

443
01:00:56,004 --> 01:00:59,543
音频录音，物证,勒索
audio recordings, physical evidence, blackmail,

444
01:00:59,545 --> 01:01:00,742
这些都是无价的！
it was fuckin' priceless!

445
01:01:01,644 --> 01:01:03,023
无价！
Priceless!

446
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:08,724
是的 我还挺享受这样的
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

447
01:01:08,726 --> 01:01:11,424
我知道
Yeah, I know you did.

448
01:01:11,427 --> 01:01:12,384
是的
Yeah.

449
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:14,574
你在笑吗？
Are you really laughing?

450
01:01:21,027 --> 01:01:22,106
所以
So...

451
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:27,687
你结婚了 啊？稳定下来的
Then you got married, ah? Settled down.

452
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:30,136
你是怎么做到的？
How did you manage that anyways?

453
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:32,278
运气
Luck, I guess.

454
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,399
是吗
Yeah.

455
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:38,129
是的 你有你的妻子 我有我的儿子
Yeah, while you had your wife, I had my son.

456
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:40,889
相信我 你本有个更好的活可做
And believe me, you had a far better deal.

457
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,430
但你却洗手不干了
And then you left.

458
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:49,351
你退出的样子
And the way you got out,

459
01:01:49,353 --> 01:01:54,271
自欺欺人说过去不会影响将来
lying to yourself that the past held no sway over the future.

460
01:01:54,274 --> 01:01:55,712
但是到最后
But in the end,

461
01:01:57,334 --> 01:02:01,683
我们还是要为我们的恶心做出代价
a lot of us are rewarded for our misdeeds,

462
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:05,043
这就是为什么上帝带走了你的妻子
which is why God took your wife

463
01:02:06,455 --> 01:02:08,644
然后你摊上了我
and unleashed you upon me.

464
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:14,135
这回影响你一生
This life follows you.

465
01:02:16,117 --> 01:02:18,546
紧跟着你
It clings to you,

466
01:02:18,548 --> 01:02:23,347
感染每一个与你亲近的人
infecting everyone who comes close to you.

467
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:25,866
你和我 都被诅咒了
We are cursed, you and I.

468
01:02:27,098 --> 01:02:29,918
这个我同意
On that we agree.

469
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,319
终于达成了共识
Finally, common ground.

470
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,719
好吧
Okay.

471
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:39,759
站一边去
Step aside.

472
01:02:39,762 --> 01:02:41,500
交出你的儿子
Give me your son.

473
01:02:42,732 --> 01:02:43,870
John Wick.
John Wick.

474
01:02:49,543 --> 01:02:52,872
那只是部车！一条狗
It was just a fucking car! Just a fuckin' dog!

475
01:02:52,874 --> 01:02:54,162
只是条狗
Just a dog...

476
01:02:55,424 --> 01:02:56,431
Viggo?
Viggo?

477
01:02:57,764 --> 01:02:59,053
Yeah.
Yeah.

478
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:01,213
Helen死了后，我失去了一切
When Helen died, I lost everything.

479
01:03:02,565 --> 01:03:05,414
直到那条狗到了我的门前
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep.

480
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:08,325
一个来自我妻子最后的礼物
A final gift from my wife.

481
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,174
那一刻 我看到了希望
In that moment, I received some semblance of hope.

482
01:03:13,547 --> 01:03:15,736
一个不在独自一人痛苦的机会
An opportunity to grieve unalone.

483
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:19,066
但是 你的儿子
And your son

484
01:03:19,968 --> 01:03:21,676
夺走了它！
took that from me!

485
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:22,637
哦 好了
Oh, come on...

486
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:24,468
从我身边偷走了它！
Stole that from me!

487
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,138
从我面前杀了它！
Killed that from me!

488
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,598
人们一直在问我是不是重操旧业了
People keep asking if I'm back.

489
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,938
但我不知如何回答
And I haven't really had an answer.

490
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:35,270
但是现在 我觉得 我回来了！
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back!

491
01:03:35,272 --> 01:03:38,060
所以 你要么交出你的儿子
So you can either hand over your son...

492
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:41,360
要么就在他旁边尖叫着死去
...or you can die screaming alongside him!

493
01:06:02,686 --> 01:06:04,304
冷静 冷静 冷静！
Cool it, cool it, cool it, cool it, cool it!

494
01:06:04,966 --> 01:06:06,195

495
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,844
他在哪？Shit
Where is he? Shit.

496
01:06:11,328 --> 01:06:12,526
Shit!
Shit!

497
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:19,278
你可以保证我 如果我告诉他在哪
I have your word that if I tell you where he is,

498
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,928
你可以放过我？
you'll let me walk away?

499
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:22,037

但是这已经无关紧要了

506
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:31,451
你能不能别玩那破游戏了？

507
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:46,232
你能不能别玩那破游戏了？

508
