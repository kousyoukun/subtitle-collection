1
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,210
All right ! Let her go !

2
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,380
It floats

3
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,460
Not bad, uh ?

4
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,000
It's fantastic

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,670
Can I get on ?

6
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,040
You paid for her

7
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm the one who has to
ask permission to board

8
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,580
Go ahead

9
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,670
Here you go
Frank

10
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,330
No
I'll take one of these

11
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,830
To Frank Morrison
for building us the most

12
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,170
beautiful boat
in the water

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you ! Thank you !

14
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,000
That boat was the
bargain of the century

15
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,080
I made a price,
kept the price

16
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,790
And if you build
any more at that price

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,830
you'll go out of business

18
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,000
Theresa,
I should explain to

19
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,170
you my theory of
noble failure

20
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,120
But Danny's got
a game

21
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,830
See you

22
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,540
So how come
your boyfriend's

23
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,420
not coming
with you?

24
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,790
Danny said he wouldn't play

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
if he saw Rick in the stands

26
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,290
He's really got it in
for the guy, doesn't he?

27
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,620
Coach ! Coach !

28
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,620
How are you?

29
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,670
Hey, Frank,
how's it going ?

30
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,620
Where's Dan ?

31
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,460
He isn't here

32
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,460
Why not?

33
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,210
I asked him to stay,
but he chose to leave

34
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,500
I don't know where
he went yeah

35
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,580
This is
Frank Morrison

36
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,290
Oh, really?

37
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,580
What is that Danny?

38
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,880
Okay, we'll be there

39
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,580
He's at the police
station

40
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,290
Mom ! Dad !

41
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,790
I can't believe you
would stow away in some

42
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,080
complete stranger's car

43
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,580
Where did you think
you were going ?

44
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,000
No... Anywhere, What
difference does it make?

45
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
Christ, Danny,
what are you thinking ?

46
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,500
What's the big deal ?

47
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry, okay?

48
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,250
I just didn't feel like
playing today, so I booked

49
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,620
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison
Please come in

50
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,460
Wait here

51
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,830
The first time
we picked him up,

52
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,920
it was for breaking windows

53
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,460
Danny insisted that we
had the wrong kid

54
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,170
He wanted to hire a
lawyer, we remember

55
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,790
That was two years ago
after you guys separated

56
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,460
Six months later we got
him in here for truancy

57
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,000
That was right after - Right
after we got our divorce, yes

58
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,120
All this acting out is
Danny's way of

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,880
trying to get us
back together

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,120
Look we've
logged a lot of

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,330
hours a
lot of counsellors

62
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,750
Clearly, it hasn't
done us any good

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,880
Any idea what set him
off this time?

64
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,330
Yes, I'm sure it's because
I'm getting remarried

65
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,120
Oh, boy
who's the lucky guy?

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,790
Rick Barnes

67
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,120
I know Rick

68
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,670
Of course, you do
Everybody does

69
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,420
Congratulations! then

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,710
Well, they do, honey

71
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Your mom's
getting married

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,290
I know you don't
like it I get it

73
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,290
But you're not going to

74
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,120
use it as an
excuse to get wild

75
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,250
Okay, Dad

76
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,460
No, I'm not kidding,
Danny

77
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,960
Your mother's got a right
to move on with her life

78
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,620
I think you ought to give
this guy a break

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,960
What do you think?

80
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,330
Dad, do you ever wish that
things could be like they were?

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,580
Well, Danny, maybe you
don't remember,

82
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,170
But things weren't all
that great

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
I remember you were
home every day

84
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,460
Yeah, I know

85
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,040
The truth is, your mother
and I tried hard to make

86
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,920
it work out but we were

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,000
arguing all the time
and frankly

88
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,120
I didn't think I was doing

89
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,330
you any favours by
sticking around

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,040
Guess what?

91
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,290
The mast is up on the
big boat

92
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,960
So we're still going
sailing Saturday?

93
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,210
Yeah, you bet

94
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,290
Great

95
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,790
See you Saturday

96
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,790
Saturday

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,080
Frank, will you hold on
for a second ?

98
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,120
I'm sorry, Mom

99
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,290
It's okay, sweetheart

100
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,290
I love you
I love you, too

101
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,380
Bye, Dad

102
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
All right, so he said that
he would give Rick a break

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,960
At least it's something

104
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,500
Yeah, cool, thank you

105
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,960
Your're still taking him
sailing on Saturday?

106
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,620
Yeah, why?

107
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,000
It's just that Danny
takes his cues from you

108
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,290
And I thought that maybe
if you asked Rick to go

109
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,960
sailing with you guys
Jesus Susan I mean,

110
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,250
giving him a pep talk is
one thing

111
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,920
But taking your fiance
sailing with us?

112
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,920
Come on ! Jeez !

113
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,580
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have asked

114
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,460
Damn it

115
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,620
You okay?

116
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, I'm okay

117
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,120
Susan asked me to take
Rick sailing with us this weekend

118
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,290
So Danny and he can bond

119
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,500
Maybe it's a good idea

120
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,540
What ?

121
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Danny needs to
accept the fact

122
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,920
that his mom is
getting remarried

123
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,620
And you're going to have
to accept it too, Frank

124
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,040
I have no problem
accepting it

125
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,420
I don't want to hang out
with the guy, that's all

126
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,710
So what really bothers
you about sailing with Rick?

127
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,670
You afraid that Danny
might get to like him?

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,460
Maybe I don't want him
bonding with him

129
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,710
Maybe I don't want him
to have a new dad

130
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,420
Remember my friend,

131
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,330
His ex-wife ran away
with Keith Barrel,

132
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,500
the football player ?

133
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,290
We'll his kid admired
the guy so much

134
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,170
That he took his name

135
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,750
And then
eventually stopped

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,710
seeing his
dad altogether

137
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,040
Come on, Frank, Danny
loves you. You're his Dad

138
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,960
Diane,
these things happen

139
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,880
And Rick Barnes

140
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,620
Ever since he got in
town, everyone's just

141
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,460
falling all over him just
cause he's loaded

142
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,210
He's got more than just
money, Frank

143
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,040
Yeah, what?

144
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,580
According to everyone,
he's a very nice guy

145
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,380
Well, I'm a nice guy, too
but no one's falling

146
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,580
all over -Yes, you are

147
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,380
I'm just a boat builder
A poor boat builder at that

148
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,290
All right, it's just
like a car, okay?

149
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,330
You turn left to go left,
and right to go

150
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,250
Port

151
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,750
No, that's left

152
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,330
Right, right, right

153
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,500
And that's starboard

154
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,620
I know what you mean

155
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,580
Maybe we should stick
to lefts and rights

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,620
That way

157
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,830
That I understand

158
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,540
I'm impressed, Danny

159
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,670
You know a lot about
boats, man

160
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,290
You know, my Dad and I,

161
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,460
we spend a lot of time
out here

162
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,170
I can see why,
It's beautiful

163
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,040
Thanks for including me
today, I'm having fun

164
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,420
No problem

165
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,880
There are so many
beautiful places in the world

166
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
How did you end up here?

167
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,250
I invested in this
pharmaceutical company

168
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,830
They came out with this
new blood pressure medicine

169
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,120
Stock just went through
the roof

170
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,580
It was like winning
the lottery

171
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,790
It gave me a
chance to do

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,670
something different
with my life

173
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,000
You know, Frank, I'd never
try to take your place with him

174
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
I just want a shot at
being his friend

175
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I tell you what
There are two

176
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,250
things you have to
remember with a kid

177
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,170
Number one

178
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
you have to show them
that you love them

179
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,000
Number two,
give them stuff

180
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,710
You mean bribe him, right?

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,080
If you bought him a new
baseball g love,

182
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,290
you'd be right in with him

183
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,250
Sounds like a plan

184
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,120
Danny ! Ready about !

185
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Pull it in. There you go

186
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,460
See you, Rick

187
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,580
See you later, Dan

188
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,080
Frank, you know the sea
Cliff Resort at Buzzard's Bay?

189
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,710
The dump? Sure
What about it?

190
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,330
Actually
I just bought it

191
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,960
It's beautiful

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
The idea is to
try to turn it

193
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,120
into something beautiful

194
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
How would
you feel about

195
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,670
building me
some boats?

196
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,080
We're so busy lately

197
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,620
Come on
Frank You would

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
be doing me a favour

199
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,460
I'll think about it

200
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,830
So

201
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,080
Are you maybe feeling
a little bit better

202
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,170
about your mom
marrying Rick, or what?

203
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,380
I guess, yeah

204
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:05,880
Good

205
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,710
But I'm still not going
to the wedding ?

206
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,000
Why is that?

207
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,000
It would just
be too weird

208
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,040
watching mom
get married

209
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,040
You have to go

210
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,120
Cause you're
going to break your

211
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,120
mother's heart
if you don't

212
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,750
You going ?

213
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,250
No, but that's different

214
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,670
We were married
It's different

215
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,580
See? It's too weird for
you, too

216
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,830
You're right, you're right

217
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,540
Okay, I tell you what,
I'll go if you go

218
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,420
Deal ?

219
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,250
Deal

220
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,040
Good, we'll make fun
of them together

221
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:47,580
Yeah

222
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,920
Susan sure did hit the
jackpot

223
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm kidding, Frank

224
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,790
Hey, Dad

225
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,790
Look at you
You are so handsome

226
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm doing great, I guess

227
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,670
Wait, I got to show
you what Rick got me

228
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,880
I'll be right back

229
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:06,960
Dad !

230
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,540
It's a Cal Ripken g love

231
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,210
That's great

232
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,710
Everyone please
take your seats

233
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,960
The ceremony is
about to begin

234
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,960
Danny
time to get ready

235
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,210
Hey, folks, look over here

236
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,120
Susan

237
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,290
do you take Rick to be

238
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,170
your lawfully
wedded husband

239
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,580
for richer, for poorer, in
sickness and in health

240
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,040
till death do you part?

241
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,290
I do

242
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,000
Rick, do you take Susan
to be your lawfully

243
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,000
wedded wife

244
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,330
for richer, for poorer

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,620
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

246
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,500
I do

247
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,500
I now pronounce you
husband and wife

248
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,330
You may kiss the bride

249
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,710
You're a trooper
I'm proud of you

250
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,830
Appreciate you coming

251
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,540
Friend of Rick's
Congratulations!

252
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,460
Long time no see

253
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,500
Yeah, Ray, we got a lot
of catching up to do

254
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,880
I can't wait

255
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,330
Thanks for dressing up

256
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,880
You look beautiful

257
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,750
Thank you

258
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,290
Congratulations!

259
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,580
I'm glad you came

260
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,170
Thanks
Who's your buddy?

261
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,500
He's an old business
acquaintance

262
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,250
I'm surprised he even
showed up

263
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,790
I know,
you looked surprised

264
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,080
What do you mean ?

265
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,620
You just looked surprised

266
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,460
Diet Coke and champagne
to go

267
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,920
How are you?

268
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,290
You're a friend of Rick's,
right?

269
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,420
That's right

270
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,540
Frank Morrison

271
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,710
Ray Coleman

272
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,620
Nice wedding, huh ?

273
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,920
She must know some
pretty good tricks to make

274
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,000
old Rick settle down

275
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,460
That's my ex-wife Susan

276
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,540
You ex?
You're kidding me

277
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,500
No

278
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,460
So where are you from?

279
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,710
Bay area, California

280
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,330
Came all the way out here
for the wedding, huh ?

281
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,670
I had some business
in DC

282
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,500
So how long you know
Rick?

283
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,670
We go way back, went
to school together

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,620
Really?

285
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,080
What about it?

286
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,500
Oh, nothing

287
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,620
He told me
that you were

288
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,040
in business together,

289
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,000
or something

290
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,670
Excuse me, Frank
Catch you later

291
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,920
It really is too bad

292
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
What's that, Ray?

293
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,330
You registered

294
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,500
I saw the gift table

295
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,920
Registered at Crate and
Barrel, wow

296
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,790
The dishes, table cloths,
soup tureens

297
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,750
You registered for a
soup tureen ?

298
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,920
That's what I would've
got you if I'd been

299
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,500
invited earlier

300
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,040
In fact, I could have
been your best man

301
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,290
I appreciate we got some
things to discuss here, Ray

302
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,290
But now's not a good
time

303
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,250
Are you busy?

304
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,830
What I'm going to do
is put you

305
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,000
up in a motel for a while

306
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,290
outside of town, and
I'll get in touch with you

307
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,330
in a couple of days

308
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,000
Why can't I stay here?
You've got plenty of room

309
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,500
That's not a good idea,
Ray

310
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,620
I'm very lucky, Danny

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,830
I'm fortunate to have
three great men in my life

312
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,170
Who's number one?

313
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,790
You are, sweetheart

314
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,250
You'll always be
number one

315
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll see you guys later

316
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,080
Where you going ?

317
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,750
I got some shopping
to do

318
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,380
All right, well, have fun

319
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,670
Come on, Rick,
throw the ball

320
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,670
See you later,
sweetheart

321
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,080
Good catch

322
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,040
Come on, you could
have had that

323
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,170
I should have had that?

324
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,040
Yeah

325
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,790
You should have had
that

326
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,250
My g love, it's not
broken in all the way

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
G love's not broken
in yet, all right

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
Is your arm not broken
in yet?

329
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,790
That was practically
right to you, Rick

330
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,750
That was practically
right to me

331
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,290
My dad would have
had that

332
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,120
Who's you dad,
Shaquille O'Neal ?

333
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,000
He used to be captain
of his baseball team

334
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,040
He's great all sports

335
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,960
You know, your dad is
going to be working for me

336
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,290
I hired him to
build me some boats

337
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:12,920
Did he
tell you that?

338
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,460
No, he didn't

339
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,790
If your dad's such a
great baseball player,

340
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
how come
he never taught you

341
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:24,670
how to
throw a baseball ?

342
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,880
I can throw the ball

343
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Then why are you

344
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,790
standing with
your feet like this

345
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
and putting the ball
everywhere where I'm not?

346
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,290
When you throw a
baseball, you point your

347
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,960
foot to somebody so
the ball goes to them

348
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,290
Just throw the ball

349
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,580
I'm going to throw
the ball

350
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,170
But I don't want to run
or jump for the ball

351
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,500
I want the ball to
come to me

352
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,960
Aim and concentrate

353
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,670
Take it easy !

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,120
I am taking it easy
How the hell are you

355
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,670
supposed to learn
anything out here?

356
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,290
Come on,
turn the ball loose

357
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,330
You throw like shit

358
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,580
You know, Rick, I don't
want to play anymore

359
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,670
Suit yourself. Bring the
g loves in when you're done

360
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,960
Don't ask me to play again
if you're going to be a brat !

361
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,330
You want about a half
inch up

362
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,880
Just trim it off like that

363
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,750
All your strokes are

364
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,080
even and forward
like so, right?

365
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,000
And you use the other
side of the brush, as well

366
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,460
This is the important
part, make sure that the

367
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,330
edges don't dry

368
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,790
Because then you'll
get distortion

369
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,460
No open spots
You ready to try it?

370
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,670
What if I mess up?

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,960
That's a very interesting
question, 'cause that's

372
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,500
what I asked my dad

373
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,750
And that's what he
asked his father

374
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,330
So do you know what your
great grandfather told

375
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,120
your grandfather who

376
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,330
told your father
who's telling you now?

377
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,210
What?

378
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,920
That's why God
invented sandpaper

379
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,420
So this is okay?

380
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,580
Yeah, it's very good

381
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
So what happened with
that whole window thing ?

382
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,790
I told Mom it was an
accident

383
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,540
Yeah, well, tell me it
was an accident

384
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,000
I just got mad, okay?

385
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,080
Why, because he had a
problem with the way

386
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,080
you threw a ball ?

387
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,960
No, he threw it hard and
he tried to hurt me

388
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,710
Come on, Danny, was it
any harder than a line

389
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,710
drive coming at you?

390
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:18,880
No

391
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,960
Maybe he was just trying
to prepare you for a real game

392
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,920
or something

393
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,540
Why do you have to work
for him, anyway?

394
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,880
Tell him you don't want
his money,

395
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,120
that you don't
need anything from him

396
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,500
I can't do that

397
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,170
Why not?

398
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,080
Because the truth is,
Dan

399
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,540
I love making these
wooden boats,

400
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,960
but people
don't want them anymore

401
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,250
When your
grandpa made them,

402
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,580
they'd line up
from here to Maine

403
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,120
Just to have one

404
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,330
But they want
plastic now

405
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,040
It's cheaper, they can
afford it

406
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,460
You understand ?

407
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,460
Yeah

408
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,000
I was in the donut shop
this morning

409
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,120
You know
who I saw?

410
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,830
You know that girl Katie
that you like,

411
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,960
what's her
last name?

412
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,170
Lewis? she was there
with a girlfriend

413
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,290
She was talking about
you, she said, he's nice

414
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,830
or something like that

415
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,290
Since she got her braces
off, she's a total babe

416
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,170
I know, and then she
said that she thought

417
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,710
your dad was a fox

418
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,380
Here you go, Frank
Have a nice day

419
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,540
You too

420
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,170
How's it going ?

421
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,960
Frank Morrison, I met
you at Rick's wedding

422
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Jesus, of course !

423
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,040
Ray, right !

424
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,960
You want to sit down ?

425
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,880
Sure

426
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,210
Sorry Frank, yeah

427
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,790
I'm getting really bad
with faces

428
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,500
It must be early
Alzheimer's or something

429
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,790
It's been a while since
the wedding

430
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,290
I wouldn't worry about it

431
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,500
I was just surprised
you're still here

432
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,750
You said something

433
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,710
about just being
in for the day

434
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,710
Yeah, I decided
to stick around,

435
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,120
grab myself a little R& R

436
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:09,960
Tell you what, Frank,

437
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,170
now that I've been here
for a while

438
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,420
I can see why Rick really
fell in love with the place

439
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
I'm actually
thinking about

440
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,920
looking at some
real estate myself

441
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,380
No kidding

442
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,540
I kid you not

443
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,040
Well, if you're serious
about it, I know a realtor

444
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,880
Sam Jones, he'll hook
you up

445
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,540
You know that
I'm noticing ?

446
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,250
I haven't seen any adult
bookstores in this town

447
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,460
No kidding

448
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,830
I kid you not

449
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,710
Just the man I wanted
to see

450
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,920
I owe you a call
Good to see you

451
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,960
You're a busy man

452
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,620
If you weren't so busy,

453
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,170
you wouldn't be getting

454
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,500
Southport's Man
of the year award

455
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,290
Yeah, well, it's a slow
year, we all know that

456
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,250
right?

457
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,330
How's the backhand
coming ?

458
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,420
Coming along, want to
play tomorrow?

459
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,880
Let me give you a call

460
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,750
Give my best to
everybody

461
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,620
I will

462
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,120
Open up, Ray

463
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
What the hell were

464
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
How did you know
I was in town ?

465
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,790
What are you doing with
my wife's ex, Ray?

466
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,420
Having eggs

467
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,170
Why did she leave him?
He was great

468
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,960
Told him
I was thinking

469
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,250
about buying some
property here

470
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,750
And he offered to find
me a realtor

471
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,170
Maybe you and me
could be neighbors

472
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,460
I had a good reason for

473
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,620
wanting you to stay out
of town, Ray

474
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,330
You talk too much
You always have

475
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,500
Maybe I'm not the
only one

476
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,500
How do you think
I found you?

477
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
When we
were on the

478
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,710
inside doing
our little stretch

479
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,290
We'd all take our best
shots at imagining

480
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,620
Where you'd run off to
spend our money

481
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,460
You're lucky it was only
me who figured it out

482
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,290
or you would have had

483
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,460
all three of us for
wedding guests

484
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,920
What about Tommy
and John ?

485
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,960
What about them?

486
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,790
What are you going to
send them their share?

487
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,120
So? Don't you want to
know how I found you?

488
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,290
Yeah, of course I do,
Ray

489
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,540
I remember this one
time you were drunk

490
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,330
and telling me how
crappy your childhood was

491
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,000
Except for this one
summer you spent on

492
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,120
the Maryland coast

493
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,290
Where there was clean
air and friendly people

494
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,040
I ain't saying you were
easy to find

495
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,330
I mean, I only had a
general idea of where

496
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,120
to look

497
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,290
and a lot of times I
came this close to just

498
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,750
giving it up

499
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,170
But then

500
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,380
then you made the
papers

501
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,290
You know, I'll tell you
something, Ray

502
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,830
You know what I came to
hate most about working

503
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,790
outside the law?

504
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,460
Having to associate
with scumbags

505
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,290
You found yourself a
lawyer to get

506
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,210
yourself off

507
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,380
Maybe that makes you
smarter than me

508
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,830
doesn't make you better

509
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,460
I'll call you, Ray

510
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,750
I'm sick of you stalling
me, Jack !

511
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,500
I told you, Ray

512
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,290
it takes time to put

513
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,330
this kind of
money together

514
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:16,880
Name's Rick

515
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,170
It's funny how quick you
can forget a name

516
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,790
Rick

517
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,750
Stay out of town, Ray

518
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,620
You don't belong there

519
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,040
Well, I was right, the
doctor said pregnant

520
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,000
Baby, I'm so happy
That's so great

521
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,960
Oh, Susan, I bet you it's
going to be a boy, too

522
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,290
You want to
bet me on that?

523
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,250
What's wrong, honey?

524
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,210
Nothing

525
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,960
I just didn't expect it to
happen so soon,

526
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:01,920
that's all

527
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,420
You know how much I
wanted to have a baby

528
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,790
I'm happy

529
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,500
I know you do, I do, too
Promise

530
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,460
You just worried
about Danny, huh ?

531
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,040
Ya I'm just first married
and... Baby, it's hard

532
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,920
to handle, You know
for kid...

533
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,170
Danny ! Dan, Don't !

534
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,380
Sweetie, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

535
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,540
I did not mean it for you
to find out this...

536
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,330
Leave me alone, Mom !

537
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,120
Danny?

538
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,170
Danny, can you at least
try to be happy

539
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
for everybody?
No !

540
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,620
Danny, please don't !

541
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,670
Please don't let him
ruin this

542
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,460
This is the happiest day
of my life

543
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

544
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,330
Just give me two minutes
I'll be right down

545
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,290
Diane, it's me, is my
dad there?

546
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,250
I have to talk to him

547
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,880
No, honey,
he's not home yet

548
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,880
When is he coming
home?

549
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,040
Soon, I guess, Danny,
are you okay?

550
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,880
Tell him he's got to
come and get me,

551
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,080
I have to talk to him

552
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,500
Who are you talking to?

553
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,540
Take me to my Dad's
house. I want to go now

554
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,080
No, this is between us

555
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,250
You and I are going to
sit down here and we're

556
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,540
going to talk this
through, okay?

557
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,290
I know that you're upset,
sweetheart,

558
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,670
but you have to believe
me when I tell you

559
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,620
that a baby
is not going

560
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,330
to change the way
I feel about you

561
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,380
I know, Mom, I'm
number one, remember ?

562
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,210
Check out of your room
Meet me out front at seven

563
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,750
Did you get it all ?

564
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,290
Yeah, Ray
I've got it all

565
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,880
All right,
I'll be waiting

566
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,580
About time

567
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,080
What did I miss?

568
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,330
Excuse me guys

569
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,460
I got to go into town
for a little while,

570
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,580
but it shouldn't take long

571
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,620
Okay, will you wait?

572
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,830
I'll walk you to your
car, okay?

573
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,790
We're not through
I'll be right back

574
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,000
How do you think the
conversation's going ?

575
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,460
You don't understand

576
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,830
I feel like I've betrayed
him, or something

577
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,380
Stop it, will you? You
haven't betrayed anybody

578
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,000
He's just upset
He'll get over it

579
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,080
Listen, I'll wrap this
thing up as soon as

580
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,790
I can and I'll be home
I love you

581
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,290
Please drive carefully

582
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,670
It looks like there's
a storm coming in

583
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,080
It's been a pleasure
having you

584
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,540
Mr.Coleman
Come back anytime

585
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,330
See you around
Take care

586
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,580
Put it in the back

587
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,880
Good - bye and good
riddance

588
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,290
So where you off to?

589
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,210
Miami Beach

590
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,080
Starting tomorrow

591
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,080
I'm going to be working on
my tan and a case of Cuervo

592
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,290
If you ever get fed up
here in Frontier land

593
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,290
come on down

594
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,960
Miami's got no appeal
for me

595
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,170
None whatsoever

596
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,710
I'm going to have a kid

597
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Get the hell out of here

598
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,290
Isn't that great?

599
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,960
You're really going all
the way with this

600
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,080
" Leave it to Beaver " thing

601
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,290
Two kids?

602
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,790
Danny's not mine

603
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,290
That's got to be tough,

604
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,790
putting up with some
other guy's brat

605
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,170
I couldn't do it

606
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,290
I put up with the damn
kid because I got no choice

607
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,460
you know

608
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,170
I got to make a stop here

609
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,250
Why?

610
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
You don't think I had
that kind of cash on me

611
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:54,830
did you?

612
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,210
No, I got it stashed up
here at a brickworks I own

613
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,250
Comes in handy for
stuff, Jesus !

614
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,790
What?

615
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,000
No, it's just that I've never
been out here before at night

616
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,080
And I can't see a goddamn
thing cause it's pouring

617
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,500
Are you kidding me?

618
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,960
No, I'm not kidding you
You see anything in this shit?

619
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Jesus ! What are you,
lost?

620
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:28,960
Relax, it's around here
somewhere. Let me just

621
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,040
look at the map,
all right?

622
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,380
The map's in here

623
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,750
I got a flight to catch !

624
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,080
Stop bitching at me !
look in the back for the map

625
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,330
Jesus Christ

626
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,920
I don't see no
goddamn map

627
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,120
It's in here somewhere

628
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,710
You see it?

629
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:48,960
This is unbelievable !

630
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,170
Wait till you see what
you got back here

631
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,500
What's going on ?

632
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,960
It's Danny, Rick
He ran away

633
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:27,880
Are you okay?

634
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:28,960
I'm fine

635
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,210
It's okay, Mr. Barnes
Your wife got a call

636
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,580
from Mr. Morrison

637
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,960
Danny showed up over
there

638
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Thank God, you want to
go get him?

639
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,580
Hold on, Mr. Barnes
There's more

640
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,330
What is it?

641
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,960
He told his father he
saw you kill a man

642
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,330
He told his father what?

643
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,830
He claims he was hiding
in the back of your Suburban

644
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,040
He says that's where he
saw you do it

645
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,670
Susan, what would make
Danny say something like this?

646
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,670
It's obvious,

647
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,330
Rick, it's Danny's way of getting

648
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,460
back at us for the baby

649
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,380
We should head down to
the station

650
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,460
And we'll be needing the
keys to your Suburban

651
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,500
I know what I saw, I'm
not making this up

652
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,040
He killed a guy

653
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,540
Danny, are you sure
you're not doing this

654
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,750
because you're
mad at Rick?

655
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,960
Diane, please

656
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,250
Danny, let's go over this
again, all right?

657
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,000
Take your time, start
from the beginning

658
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,170
Don't leave anything out

659
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,000
Send them in

660
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,540
It's your mother and
stepfather

661
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,580
They're going to join us

662
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,750
No Dad, please no
I don't want to see him, Dad

663
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,540
Danny

664
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,540
A already told you, he
never said his name

665
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,040
Dad ?

666
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,120
Just answer the question
It's okay

667
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,830
And you say that
you heard

668
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
your stepfather and
this man

669
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,460
talking about money

670
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,290
They were supposed to be
going to get some money

671
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,380
Only, Rick killed him
instead

672
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,580
Danny, stop this, please

673
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,210
He said that he loved

674
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,080
the baby and that he hated me

675
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,040
Sweetheart, listen, I
know that we've hurt you,

676
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,620
But what you're doing
isn't fair, it's not right

677
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,420
I'm telling the truth

678
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,210
No, Danny, you're doing

679
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,250
what you do when a situation

680
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,880
comes along
that you can't handle

681
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,580
Look, he knows the truth,
he knows what he did

682
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,040
and you're just going to
sit there and let him get

683
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,460
away with it, Dad

684
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,460
Come in

685
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,420
Johnson just called in
from the brickworks

686
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,380
Excuse me

687
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,790
So, no charbroiled
skeletons?

688
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,460
If a body was incinerated

689
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,960
in a kiln like they got over there,

690
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,620
it would take a forensic
specialist-

691
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,750
I am not wasting
any more time or money

692
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,670
on this sick kid's
bullshit story

693
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,460
David, phone call,
line seven

694
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:09,620
Hold on

695
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,710
Stevens

696
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,460
It's the garage
Okay, go on

697
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,620
There was

698
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,920
No visible evidence at
all at the brickworks

699
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,080
or, for that matter,
in your truck

700
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,380
Keys are at the front desk
You all should go home

701
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,540
Danny, let's go home

702
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,750
I'm not going home
with him

703
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,670
Danny, we are going to
go home and talk about this

704
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,500
okay?

705
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,670
Dad, please don't make
me go home

706
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,830
Susan, let him come
home with me

707
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,710
No, Frank, every time he
has a problem,

708
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,670
he comes
running to you

709
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,330
I want him to come
home now

710
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,000
Dad, don't make me go

711
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,880
Jesus, Danny,
knock it off !

712
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,040
Dad ? You don't believe
me, either ?

713
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,330
You're asleep right now
This is a dream

714
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,500
You're dreaming that
someone's got their

715
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,250
hand over your mouth and
it's hard to breathe

716
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,540
and you can't wake up,
can you?

717
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,290
can you?

718
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,420
Now, you had a dream
about a murder

719
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,500
And it felt like it was
real

720
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,920
It's only a nightmare

721
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,040
You don't want every
moment of your life to

722
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:37,750
be a big screaming nightmare

723
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,380
do you, Danny?

724
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,040
Better wake up

725
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,920
He wants me to pick them up?

726
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,670
Have the port lights come in

727
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,960
I'm expecting them this
afternoon

728
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,170
All right, call and
make sure

729
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,170
Hey, how you doing ?
Good morning

730
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,500
How are you, Frank?

731
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,170
Rick

732
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,000
You got a hell of a
place here

733
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,380
Frank, I just want to let
you know I'm not taking

734
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,250
what happened last
night personally

735
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,040
I just look forward to
getting past it

736
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,830
But on to something more
positive here, I do have

737
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,210
the start- up money for
the Seacliff, $50,000

738
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,620
When do you think you
could start building the boats?

739
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,380
You know, when I went
home last night,

740
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,620
I couldn't
even think about sleeping

741
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,460
But here's what I did
think about

742
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,710
My son is living with you
in your house

743
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,210
And I have absolutely no

744
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,830
idea of what kind
of man you really are

745
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,080
and, honestly, that scares
the hell out of me

746
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,620
Well, Frank, you're a good
dad, you know

747
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,830
But before you start
letting your imagination

748
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,620
Run away with you here,

749
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,080
I'd ask you to remember
something

750
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,790
It's true that you may not
know me so well, but

751
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,380
you do know Danny

752
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,620
and he lies, I know that

753
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,960
He lies to his mother
his grandmother

754
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:40,960
His teachers, the police

755
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,040
Just about everybody, but

756
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,120
But what?

757
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,290
He doesn't lie to me

758
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,880
Hard as I tried, I couldn't
think of a sing le time

759
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,500
I didn't kill anybody,
Frank

760
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:56,620
probably not, Rick

761
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,750
I'm glad to hear you
say that

762
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,330
As long as my son is
living with you under your roof,

763
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,620
" probably" isn't good
enough

764
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,710
Jesus Christ, Frank, who's
this guy, Ray?

765
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,750
What about him?

766
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,920
He's your
school chum

767
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,420
he's your business
acquaintance

768
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,790
The other day I saw him,
he was looking for real estate

769
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,580
Ray
Yeah

770
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,500
So now it's Ray
I supposedly killed,

771
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,960
is that right?

772
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,170
I tell you, Frank, trying
to be a stepfather

773
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,120
To a child that hates
your guts,

774
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,580
isn't exactly a picnic

775
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,040
I thought you were on
my side for this

776
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,380
I'm on Danny's side

777
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,420
Give my best to Diane
then, Frank

778
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:51,080
Right

779
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,460
I just think it's a good
idea if he stays with

780
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,330
that's all

781
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,790
I'm not having this
conversation with you

782
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,750
I know that Rick
threatens you-

783
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,920
He threatens me,
all right

784
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,290
You're so wrong
about him

785
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,000
You don't even know
what he's really about

786
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,670
You're the one that
I don't really know

787
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,120
anything about anymore,
Frank

788
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,670
Do you think that I so
desperately need a man,

789
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,000
that I'm going to endanger
my own child by marring a-

790
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:08,790
Danny

791
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,920
What are you
doing here?

792
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,750
Come on,
Danny, let's go

793
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,750
No, he's coming home
with me

794
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,330
He's scared of the guy
It's not right

795
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,330
What do you get?

796
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,670
Have I ever stopped you
from seeing him?

797
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,830
This is not about custody

798
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,500
Danny, please get
in my car

799
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,120
If you want to fight me
for custody-

800
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,670
I don't want to fight you
for custody !

801
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,880
Please don't do this !

802
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,500
Hold on a second, Frank

803
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,830
This is none of your
business

804
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,920
What if I make it my
business?

805
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,290
Don't !

806
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,290
Frank, don't do this !

807
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,120
I'm sorry, Mike

808
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,080
Dad, that was so cool

809
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,210
Put your seat belt on

810
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,960
That was awesome

811
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:52,960
Knock it off, Danny

812
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,540
You know what I've
just done?

813
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,960
It's called kidnapping

814
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,080
How could it be
kidnapping ?

815
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,120
I'm your kid

816
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,250
It just is
It doesn't matter

817
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,290
So you believe me now?

818
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,210
Yeah, yeah

819
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,460
What are we going to
do now? I don't know

820
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:20,460
Dad, watch out !

821
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,460
You never struck me
as the kind of guy

822
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,000
Who would exploit the
emotional problems of

823
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,880
his son to make a play
for custody

824
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,540
Sergeant, I know you have
a history with my son

825
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,790
I know that's why you're
having a hard time with this

826
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,120
But this character,

827
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,830
Ray Coleman
he was at the weeding -

828
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,580
When Ray Coleman
showed up at the wedding,

829
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,580
Rick Barnes
wasn't happy to see him

830
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,670
But there's more

831
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,040
they had two different
stories about how they met

832
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,620
Maybe Ray Coleman is
a little confused

833
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,330
But he wasn't confused

834
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,250
Maybe he'd been
drinking, come on now

835
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,670
You can go now
Mr. Morrison

836
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,290
Your ex-wife isn't
pressing charges

837
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,290
And, for the time being,
neither are we

838
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,290
By the way, I checked
with the police in the

839
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,210
Bay Area

840
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,330
No Ray Coleman was
reported missing

841
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,290
That's not good enough

842
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,620
Good-bye, Mr. Morrison

843
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,710
Jack, look, it was not

844
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,710
my intention to
fight for custody

845
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,920
But now I have
no choice, do I ?

846
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,670
Right !

847
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,750
Okay, all right, I'll see
you there at 10. Thanks

848
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,290
That was Berman
He's tough, man

849
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080
But he's good, he's the
one who handled the

850
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,290
whole divorce thing

851
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,080
Just have to figure out
What?

852
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,420
I'm sorry, Frank

853
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,750
I can't believe that you
have actually managed to

854
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,330
convince yourself that
this man -This man ?

855
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:57,460
This man who only
wanted to help-This man ?

856
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,830
Do you want me to
ignore the fact that my son is

857
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,620
living with a killer ?
is that what you want?

858
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:03,670
This fantasy of yours,

859
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,000
it sure does give you a
good excuse, doesn't it?

860
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,920
For what? Excuse for what?

861
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,460
An excuse to hold on to
your old life

862
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,040
I know Danny's your son,

863
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,460
And I would never ask
you to choose between us

864
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,420
But I won't hang around
while you take Susan on

865
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,620
in some insane
custody battle

866
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,540
Diane, I have never
failed Danny, ever

867
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,580
And I can't fail him now
not when it counts

868
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,540
I'm sorry

869
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,000
I'm sorry too, Frank

870
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,920
But I can't do this

871
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,460
Rick, sweetheart will you
please hurry up?

872
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,500
I don't
want to be late for this

873
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,120
Calm down will you?

874
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,500
Moms always win these
things, right?

875
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,250
No, it's never a sure
thing, Rick

876
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,290
You all right?

877
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,460
I still can't believe
this is happening

878
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,120
You know, Susan

879
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,420
ever since Frank hit us
with this custody thing,

880
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,040
there's something I'd like
to talk to you about

881
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,540
About what?

882
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,710
Well, I feel like I've done

883
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,040
Everything I can but
stand on my head with

884
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,710
Danny's concern

885
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,080
And he won't give me a
break. There's no way-

886
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,830
I know and I'm sorry
sweet pea

887
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,500
There's nothing for you
to be sorry about

888
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,790
It's been hard on
everybody

889
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,420
But maybe if Danny went
off to live with Frank

890
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,620
for a little while

891
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,830
That wouldn't be the
worse thing in the world

892
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,670
for everybody

893
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,580
What?

894
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,540
I'm just trying to think
about what would be

895
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,880
best for everyone, dear

896
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:36,420
Rick

897
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,250
Susan

898
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,790
things get really tense
when Danny's around

899
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,250
and the doctor said if
you get stressed out,

900
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,460
you could lose the baby

901
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,040
I don't give a damn
what the doctor said,

902
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,120
Danny's my son

903
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,330
It's bad enough he hardly
talks to me anymore

904
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,420
If he goes to live with Frank

905
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,750
I'd be lucky if I ever
see him again

906
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,000
Rick,
we talked about this

907
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,040
I'm sorry

908
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,250
Danny's not going to go
anywhere,

909
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,120
I promise
you that, okay?

910
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,540
Dan, listen up

911
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,710
Whatever the judge
decides today

912
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,290
I want you to know that
your mother loves you

913
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,250
remember that

914
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,420
I'll see you there

915
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,290
All right

916
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,040
Love you

917
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:15,960
Love you, too

918
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,080
I'm ready to go

919
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:28,960
Mom?

920
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,620
She's bringing the car
around,

921
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,330
Danny She can't hear you

922
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,920
I'm not afraid of you

923
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,080
I don't give a damn if
you're afraid of me or not

924
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:41,880
What I want to know is,

925
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,250
do I need to be afraid of you
Danny?

926
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,120
What do you mean ?

927
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,670
This custody hearing

928
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,460
thing that you have
us all going to today

929
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,250
if we come home
without you

930
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,210
Dan

931
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,330
that's going to upset
your mom

932
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,290
and like I said to you
I can't allow that to happen

933
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,500
Now, I know that you
love your dad very much

934
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,080
How would you feel if
something happened to him?

935
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,540
Look, I'll do whatever
you want

936
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,210
Just, please,
leave them alone

937
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,120
I want both parties
to know

938
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,500
That a child of
Danny's age

939
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,120
is old enough to have a
voice in determining

940
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,420
which parent he would be
better off living with

941
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,620
Now, that being said

942
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,580
call your witness
Mr. Berman

943
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:29,920
Thank you

944
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,250
Your honour, we'd like to call
Danny Morrison to the stand

945
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:55,120
Hello, Danny

946
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,580
Danny Morrison ?

947
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,500
Yes, sir

948
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,620
How old are you?

949
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,330
I'm 12, sir

950
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:05,210
Twelve, so we can't
swear you in

951
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,120
But it is your word of
honour when you sit in

952
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,380
that witness box

953
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,380
do you understand that?

954
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,250
Yes, sir

955
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,670
Good,
then let's get to work

956
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,880
Counsellor

957
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,170
Thank you, Your honour

958
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,830
Hello, Danny

959
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,920
I'm going to ask you a
few questions

960
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,920
you all right with that?

961
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,920
All right, let's go back

962
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,420
to the evening of October 18th

963
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,880
That was the night your
mother cane home from the

964
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,540
doctor with some news

965
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,670
just tell what
happened

966
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,170
I found out that my mom
was going to have a baby

967
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,880
Yeah ? How did you
handle that?

968
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,960
I guess I kind of freaked

969
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,460
Go on

970
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,420
After that, I wanted to
go and see my dad

971
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,250
How come?

972
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,620
Cause I felt like I needed
to talk things over with him

973
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,420
You and your dad are
pretty close then ?

974
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,080
Yes, sir

975
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,330
All right, Danny, just
take your time and tell us

976
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,290
what happened next

977
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,580
Well, I hid in the back
of Rick's truck

978
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,920
cause he was going
into town,

979
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,710
and that's near where
my dad lives

980
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,750
And then

981
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,580
And then he stopped at
this office building and

982
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,750
I jumped out

983
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,120
What?

984
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,580
I ran to my dad's house,

985
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:27,790
And I made up this story

986
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,500
about seeing him kill some guy

987
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,540
Danny, what are you
doing ? Tell them the truth

988
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,290
This is the truth, Dad

989
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,920
Did he threaten you?

990
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,250
You keep this up
Mr. Morrison,

991
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,170
I will have you removed
from this courtroom

992
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,210
This is not how
Frank sit down

993
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,460
Let me ask you
something, Danny

994
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:47,960
Do you want to give it

995
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,120
another try with your
mom and Rick

996
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,080
Or do you think you'd

997
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:53,540
be better off living
with your dad ?

998
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,540
I'd like to stay with my
mom and Rick

999
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,540
Look
Frank

1000
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,120
I know what
happened today

1001
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,540
I'm glad somebody
does. Drink?

1002
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,080
I'm not going to
drink with you

1003
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:36,750
Frank

1004
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,540
Too bad

1005
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,290
You ought to go home

1006
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,250
Okay
Frank

1007
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,380
Danny lied

1008
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,000
Again

1009
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,670
But at least he's not

1010
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,080
living under the same
roof with a killer

1011
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:53,790
I'll drink to that

1012
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,460
No, this is how you
lost Danny the first time

1013
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Come on
Frank let's go home

1014
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,620
That's the best offer
I've had in a while

1015
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,250
You get fresh
Frank

1016
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,040
I'll make it real

1017
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,460
It's my day to see him
Susan

1018
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,710
Yeah, I know it is

1019
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,290
What?

1020
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
I tried talking to him

1021
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,250
but he just
went racing out

1022
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm sure he just feels
badly about lying to you

1023
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,380
I'm sure it'll be okay
I'm sorry

1024
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,500
I have to go,

1025
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,580
But I promise I'll tell
him to call you

1026
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,170
Cheeseburger and
french fries

1027
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,380
Can I get you anything
to drink?

1028
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,120
Diet Coke

1029
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,750
Sounds good

1030
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,120
Took me 15 years to get

1031
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:22,960
one of these. How long
you been here?

1032
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,920
Been here about two years

1033
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,580
but I being here
for a long time

1034
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,710
Two years

1035
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,880
At the rate you're going,

1036
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,540
we'll be naming the town
after you

1037
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:34,250
Thank you very much, I
appreciate it. Thank you

1038
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,080
I'd just like to say

1039
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,790
thank you to the men and
women of Southport

1040
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,120
For recognizing me with

1041
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,210
this honour, I feel flattered
to be included

1042
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,670
Hey, Dan

1043
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:16,920
Hey, Dad

1044
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,790
You're a hard man to
get a hold of lately

1045
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,040
What are you doing here?

1046
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,540
What is this about,
Frank?

1047
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,790
I'm just trying to talk
to my son

1048
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:23,960
Ten o'clock at night?

1049
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,620
It's not your business

1050
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,330
Frank, do you really
think

1051
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,920
That showing up here
drunk in front of your son

1052
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,710
What is that supposed

1053
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,670
to make him want to spend
more time around you?

1054
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,750
Are you crazy
Frank?

1055
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,710
What are you doing ?

1056
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,040
Screw you, Patterson !

1057
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,710
Just because this
asshole's got some money

1058
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,460
to spread around you don't
give a shit who he is !

1059
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,170
Dad why don't you
just go home?

1060
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,500
Dad you dropped
your wallet

1061
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,170
Dad wait up

1062
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,460
Sorry Danny I shouldn't
have come here

1063
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,120
You dropped your wallet

1064
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,540
That's not my wallet, Dan

1065
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,120
Dad, you have to stop
making trouble for him

1066
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:16,080
So, Dad, please
just lay off, okay?

1067
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:32,750
How are you?

1068
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,460
What do you want?

1069
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,380
Nothing much

1070
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,880
Just five bucks

1071
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,290
You wouldn't happen to
have $5 you could lend

1072
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,500
your old step dad
would you, Dan ?

1073
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,170
No

1074
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,290
You don't?

1075
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,380
Maybe we should
check your wallet

1076
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,040
Where's your wallet,
Danny?

1077
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,710
I don't know

1078
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:56,920
You don't know?

1079
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,120
Don't you think you

1080
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,330
should probably
start looking for it?

1081
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,500
I really hope you didn't
lose that, Dan

1082
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,250
Start looking for it

1083
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,210
I didn't tell him
anything, Rick

1084
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:08,790
Maybe you think I've

1085
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,290
just been fooling around
with you

1086
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,330
is that it, Danny?

1087
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,250
All I did was say I was
sorry for not being home-

1088
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,000
Bullshit !

1089
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,120
I swear to God,
that's all I said

1090
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,120
You're a little fucking
liar, aren't you, Danny?

1091
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,330
I'm telling the truth, Rick

1092
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,460
I hope so

1093
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:56,210
Does Ray Coleman
sound familiar to you?

1094
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,790
Ray Coleman ? That name
doesn't sound familiar

1095
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,620
Would you check your
register ?

1096
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,380
Because my sister's
really worried about him

1097
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,290
Here we go, Ray Coleman

1098
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,210
Checked in on
September the 8th

1099
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,290
and checked out on -

1100
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,750
check the 18th

1101
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,290
Yeah, October 18th

1102
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:44,380
How about a telephone
number, address?

1103
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,120
I could check his bill

1104
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,380
Yeah, yeah

1105
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,120
Here we go, C, Coleman

1106
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,830
These are just the
local calls

1107
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:00,880
What's this?

1108
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:01,960
Pizza Hut

1109
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,750
How about this?
He called this a lot

1110
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,620
Yeah, he liked the ladies

1111
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:17,710
You patty?

1112
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:18,920
Who are you?

1113
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,580
A friend of Ray's

1114
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,290
Ray?

1115
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:23,250
Coleman

1116
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,580
That shit owes me money

1117
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,380
Join the club

1118
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:30,120
Can I talk to you?

1119
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,420
I didn't know Ray that

1120
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,120
well, we were just
killing time

1121
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,250
You know how it is

1122
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,540
Yeah, I can't believe
this guy

1123
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,080
He never even told you
where he was from?

1124
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,250
No

1125
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,540
What did you guys
talk about?

1126
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,080
We didn't do that
much talking

1127
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:50,540
We weren't doing that

1128
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,830
We were watching TV

1129
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,420
I don't know what Ray
likes better

1130
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,790
to screw or
watch basketball

1131
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,710
At least he gave me this

1132
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,880
I know that lighter
Let me see

1133
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:06,620
Oh, yeah

1134
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,750
It was my birthday a
couple of weeks ago

1135
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:10,540
I like this lighter

1136
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:12,790
It's not even real

1137
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,580
Yeah, but I like the
horseshoe thing

1138
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,380
Buy it from you
How much ?

1139
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,880
I don't know, it's a
pretty nice lighter

1140
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,670
$25

1141
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:30,540
Cool

1142
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,750
If you can just have this
dusted for prints

1143
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,040
I'm sure we'll find that
this Ray Coleman's

1144
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,290
got a record

1145
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,380
And if he does

1146
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:39,880
then we know that Rick Barnes

1147
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:40,620
will have one, too

1148
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,040
A lot of people have
handled this lighter

1149
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,460
The lab could
only manage

1150
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,120
to lift off one
clean set of prints

1151
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,880
It turns out they belong
to a convicted felon

1152
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,330
Her name is Patty Walsh

1153
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,750
Prostitution, Drug use

1154
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,380
Hey, Frank

1155
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,290
I'm glad I ran into you

1156
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,250
About last night, we
both got a little bit hot

1157
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,670
under the collar

1158
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,120
And I felt terrible
about it

1159
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,460
Recognize that?

1160
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,710
Probably fell out of Ray's

1161
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,920
pocket when you pulled
him from the truck

1162
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,580
What are you doing,
Frank?

1163
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:22,670
You touch

1164
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,920
so much as one hair
on my son's head

1165
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:28,670
and I swear, as God is
my witness

1166
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,960
that'll be the last thing
you ever do in this world

1167
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:52,250
You're the second guy today

1168
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,710
who's been in here
looking for Ray Coleman

1169
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,880
You again ?
What do you want?

1170
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:27,540
What basketball team
did he root for ?

1171
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,170
What are you talking
about?

1172
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:30,120
You said that he liked

1173
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:31,080
to screw and watch
basketball, what team

1174
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,000
did he root for ?

1175
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,420
Chicago

1176
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:43,080
Ray Coleman -Three

1177
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,420
Convictions in
Racketeering Case

1178
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:21,750
Oh, God

1179
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,790
Is Detective Stevens
there?

1180
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,460
No, this is
Frank Morrison

1181
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,830
When will he be back?

1182
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,920
You have an e-mail
address there?

1183
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,120
Thank you
No, wait, listen

1184
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,540
When he gets in, have
him check his e-mail

1185
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,920
And have him call Frank
Morrison at the boathouse

1186
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,120
as soon as he gets it

1187
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,290
Thank you

1188
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,040
As you can see, this
venerable building

1189
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,540
a long time fixture in the
Southport community

1190
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,080
Continues to bum

1191
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,920
It just keeps ringing,
Mom

1192
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,580
It's okay, sweetheart
You know how careful Dad is

1193
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,000
I'm sure he's fine
He's fine

1194
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,960
No, Mom, Rick said
he'd do this !

1195
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,460
He said he'd hurt Dad !

1196
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,670
He killed the guy,
just like I said,

1197
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,580
and he threatened to
kill Dad, too !

1198
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,500
Forget it, Mom, you won't
believe me, anyway

1199
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,540
Danny, what are you
talking about?

1200
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,040
Danny, we're getting
out of here

1201
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,250
Mom?

1202
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,620
Now

1203
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,580
Sweetheart, I didn't
hear you come in

1204
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,540
Just got back

1205
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,420
Danny, you go wait
in the car

1206
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,420
Where are you going ?

1207
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,580
There was a fire at
Frank's place and the

1208
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,620
boathouse burned down

1209
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:50,380
What?

1210
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:51,580
Danny wants to go and
make sure

1211
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,000
that Frank is okay

1212
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,210
You want
me to take you?

1213
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,250
It's okay

1214
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,460
Danny's really upset and
I think it's best if I

1215
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:58,880
take him alone, okay?

1216
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,580
Stevens

1217
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,040
What is this?

1218
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,710
Frank Morrison sent
it over

1219
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,330
Rick Barnes, indicted for
extortion bribery

1220
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,670
attempted murder

1221
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,580
His real name is
Jack Pamell

1222
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,830
Your reckon the

1223
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:22,790
Chicago Chamber of
Commerce gave

1224
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,920
him an award, too?

1225
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,290
Hello?

1226
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,170
Frank Morrison

1227
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,880
Susan, it's Frank
Now, listen

1228
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,290
You and Danny get
out of the house now !

1229
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,540
I know I'm in the car
with Danny-

1230
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,620
I think I better drive
Danny

1231
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,380
I'm fine, Rick

1232
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,210
Get out of the car, Susan

1233
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,080
Mom?

1234
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,960
It's okay, sweetheart

1235
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,960
I just need to hang on to
him till I'm someplace safe

1236
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,580
Please don't do this
Please

1237
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:30,790
Mom, are you all right?

1238
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,170
Give me the keys

1239
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,710
Take me instead, please

1240
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,000
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me

1241
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,880
Run, Danny, run !

1242
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:49,830
You bitch !

1243
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,710
Danny, go lock the doors
and the living room !

1244
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,710
Did you lock everything ?

1245
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,960
Yeah,
did you call the police?

1246
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,380
Go ! Run !

1247
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,580
Leave him alone !

1248
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:18,080
Mom, get up
Mom, wake up

1249
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,880
Mom, please get up

1250
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,710
Get up

1251
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,830
You're going to sit still,
aren't you?

1252
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:02,420
You sure you're
going to be okay?

1253
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,170
I'll be fine, Mom

1254
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,380
We'll follow you
to the hospital

1255
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:08,750
Frank, I'm sorry

1256
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,210
No, it's okay

1257
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,920
I'm sorry about the baby

1258
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,120
Mom, I love you

1259
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,040
I love you too,
sweetheart

1260
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:28,790
Mr. Morrison, hold on

1261
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:32,330
There's really not a
whole lot

1262
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,920
I can say right
now, except

1263
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:36,960
Just say it to him

1264
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,290
Danny, I'm sorry

1265
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:43,920
It's all right

1266
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:15,830
