1
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,833
Another great race today,
Johnny.

2
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,236
Who are you gonna
ride in the Stakes?

3
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:51,900
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

4
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:54,467
and l live by it...

5
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,809
"Never change horses
in midstream."

6
00:00:56,846 --> 00:01:01,215
Never change horses.
Sounds like a smart bet.

7
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,517
Always stick with a winner.

8
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,082
Keep America working.

9
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,983
Don't change horses
in midstream.

10
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:13,791
On election day,
reelect the president.

11
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:30,611
Can you step this way,
Mr. Brean?

12
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,444
Lift your arms, please.

13
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,981
That's him.
That's Mr. Fix-it.

14
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:54,625
lt's right here.

15
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,737
You have a seat here, Connie.

16
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,767
He doesn't know anything.

17
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:16,147
John Levy's staff,
his assistant...

18
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,245
and Amy Cain, Press.

19
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,324
Thank you.
That'll be all.

20
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,729
-Want some coffee?
-Black, please.

21
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:31,427
Gaviston, bring some coffee.
Black.

22
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:36,394
You kids in this room...

23
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,566
what you hear and say here...

24
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:41,270
if it gets out, you leaked it.

25
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:42,573
Tell them
what they need to know.

26
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:45,638
When it broke, the president
said, "Get me Conrad Brean."

27
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:49,847
What's the thing?

28
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:53,083
He had an illegal immigrant
nanny years back?

29
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:56,752
You get ahead in the polls,
suddenly you get nervous.

30
00:03:56,793 --> 00:04:00,194
He made a pass
at some secretary years ago?

31
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,824
A group of Firefly Girls
were here last month.

32
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:05,357
One expressed interest
in a Frederic Remington bust.

33
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:08,235
They went in the office
behind the Oval Office.

34
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,831
lt couldn't have
been over three minutes.

35
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:12,933
The Secret Service
will confirm that.

36
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:14,341
lt's not the illegal
immigrant nanny thing?

37
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,474
The girl's alleging...

38
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,146
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

39
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:27,850
Maybe we could say it was
a drug reaction to the flu.

40
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,188
Who's got the story?

41
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,715
Don't you want to know
if it's true?

42
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,091
What's the difference?

43
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,562
lt's a story.
They'll run with it.

44
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,030
How long till it breaks?

45
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:38,056
Front page,
Washington Post, tomorrow.

46
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,296
That's not good.

47
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:43,430
-Where is he?
-China.

48
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:45,338
When is he due back?

49
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,173
They're set to leave soon.

50
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,645
He stays on the ground
in China at least another day.

51
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:55,617
Why?

52
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,142
You the Press Office?

53
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:58,848
Earn your money.
He's ill.

54
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,321
When do we bring him back?

55
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:03,018
l'm gonna need a day.

56
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:05,027
He's sick.
Get that out now.

57
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,188
Tell the jackals how sick he is.

58
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,222
We gotta get that out
before the story breaks.

59
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,598
lssue a bulletin.
He's got some rare strain--

60
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:15,502
-Won't hold.
-l need running time.

61
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:16,835
lt won't hold a day.

62
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,602
lt will.
l'll tell you why.

63
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,108
Why is the president in China?

64
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:22,441
-Trade relations.
-You're right.

65
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,777
lt's got nothing to do
with the B-3 bomber.

66
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:28,443
-There is no B-3 bomber.
-l just said that.

67
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,953
l don't know why
these rumors get started.

68
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:35,222
l need $20,000.
l need a car.

69
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:37,123
Get me a car and driver.

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,787
The southwest gate.

71
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:42,528
What?

72
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,930
What is it?

73
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,368
Campaign commercial.
Should we look at it?

74
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:50,372
Put it in.
This should be interesting.

75
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,806
What is it?

76
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,810
The other side's new commercial.

77
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,072
The Neal commercial.

78
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,080
We had somebody steal it.

79
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:00,981
This'll be on the air
the day after tomorrow.

80
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:03,850
ln the final days
of the campaign...

81
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,787
has the president
changed his tune?

82
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:09,121
Thank heaven for little girls.

83
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:11,490
The presidency is about honor.

84
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:14,986
Thank heaven for little girls.

85
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,726
lt's about principles.

86
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:20,099
Without them,
what would little boys do?

87
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:22,696
lt's about integrity.

88
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,866
This tune has got to change.

89
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:29,971
On election day,
vote Neal for president.

90
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,277
Oh, boy.

91
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:35,807
Who's gonna take
the press conference today?

92
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:37,786
ls there a press conference
today?

93
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,117
What do you think?

94
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:42,022
We have to use this
as a base of operations.

95
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:44,151
l'm gonna need one, two days.

96
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,185
Whoever's leaking that stuff
to the Post lets it slip...

97
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,256
"l hope this won't
screw up the B-3 program."

98
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,633
"What B-3 program,
and why should it screw it up?"

99
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,831
"lf the president
deploys the B-3...

100
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,863
"before it's fully tested..."

101
00:06:57,907 --> 00:07:00,341
"Deploy the B-3
before it's fully tested?"

102
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,469
"Why?"

103
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:03,911
"The crisis."

104
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:06,541
-What crisis?
-l'm working on that.

105
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,482
Get General Scott
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

106
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,351
and put them
on a plane to Seattle.

107
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,356
He's nervous to talk
to the Boeing people.

108
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:16,918
-But what?

109
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,518
There isn't a B-3 bomber.

110
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:20,188
-Where'd you go to school?
-Dartmouth.

111
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,595
Then show a little spunk.
There is no B-3 bomber.

112
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,065
General Scott,
to your knowledge...

113
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,863
is not in Seattle
to talk to Boeing.

114
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:27,199
lt won't prove out.

115
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:30,637
lt doesn't have to prove out.
We just gotta distract them.

116
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:32,231
Got less than two weeks
till the election.

117
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,438
What in the world would do that?

118
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:36,672
l'm working on it.

119
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,185
Winifred, Mr. Brean.

120
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,586
-What's this?
-$20,000

121
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:50,684
l gotta go to L.A.
and see a Hollywood producer.

122
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,695
Meet me at National in an hour.

123
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,856
We'll go to Chicago
and connect there to L.A.

124
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:56,421
See you at National.

125
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:06,535
Tell me this again.

126
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:07,907
We landing?

127
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:10,769
Tell me again.

128
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:13,179
Don't worry.
lt's nothing new.

129
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:17,243
During Reagan's administration,
240 Marines killed in Beirut.

130
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,151
24 hours later,
we invade Grenada.

131
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,587
That was their M.O.

132
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:21,988
Change the story,
change the lead.

133
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,583
lt's not a new concept.

134
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:25,594
Wake me when we land.
We'll talk more.

135
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:27,892
Wait.
We can't afford a war.

136
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,921
We're not having a war.

137
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,524
We're having
the appearance of a war.

138
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,159
We cannot afford it.

139
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:36,137
-What'll it cost?
-But they would find out.

140
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:38,140
Who's gonna find out?
The American people?

141
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,165
Who's gonna tell them?

142
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:43,838
What did they find out
about the Gulf War?

143
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,440
One video of one bomb
falls down a chimney.

144
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,177
The building could have been
made out of Legos.

145
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:51,277
-You want us to go to war?
-That's the general idea.

146
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,684
With who?

147
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:56,316
l'm working on it.

148
00:08:58,761 --> 00:08:59,955
Albania?

149
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:03,124
Why?

150
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,361
Why not?
What do you know about them?

151
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,631
-Nothing.
-Precisely.

152
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,400
They seem shifty, standoffish.

153
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,671
Who knows from Albania?
Who trusts Albanians?

154
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,644
What did Albania ever do to us?

155
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:16,736
What did they do for us?

156
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,646
This is why we have to
mobilize the B-3 bomber.

157
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:21,582
You really want to go
to war with Albania?

158
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:24,848
We don't have a choice.
This is what you do.

159
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:27,253
Get your press office
right now to deny it.

160
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,587
lt didn't happen.

161
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:31,422
"There is no report
of Albanian activity."

162
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:32,985
They have to deny it.

163
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,964
-lt didn't happen.
-Deny.

164
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:38,865
...news from the president
on his visit to China.

165
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:40,630
Another sort of news, however...

166
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,433
has emerged
from the presidential quarter.

167
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:45,464
We turn to Melissa Gardner
at KZAB in Santa Fe...

168
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:46,702
with this breaking news.

169
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,375
Thanks, Richard.
Today a local Firefly Girl...

170
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:53,177
accused the president
of sexual misconduct.

171
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:55,480
This photo of the president
with the girls...

172
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:58,578
was taken during their tour
of the White House.

173
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,646
The girl claims
that the sexual misconduct...

174
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,250
occurred inside the Oval Office.

175
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,351
Her attorney says
there are no plans yet...

176
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:06,793
to hold a press conference.

177
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:09,491
Folks in Santa Fe
and the rest of America...

178
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,693
are waiting for a response
from the White House...

179
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:13,793
on these harsh allegations.

180
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:17,567
With the election days away,
the big question is...

181
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:20,838
how much will this scandal
affect the outcome?

182
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,174
Top people, Albanian desk.

183
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:24,975
l don't know, either,
but we probably have one.

184
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:27,005
Roust them out of bed.

185
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,745
Albanian desk, ClA, NSA.
Roust them, sirens blaring.

186
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,913
l know they're gonna be up
in an hour.

187
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:33,979
l want them up now.
Tell your staff...

188
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,320
General Scott in Seattle?

189
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:39,795
l don't think his trip
has to do with the B-3 bomber.

190
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:42,127
l'll have to ask you
to turn that off.

191
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:44,133
lt'll just be a second.

192
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,101
There are no electronics
on the plane.

193
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,262
l have to ask you
to turn that off.

194
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:49,737
lt'll just take two seconds.

195
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:52,605
We've said flat out
there is no B-3 bomber.

196
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:54,439
l understand.

197
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:57,935
lf it is true, he should,
he must step down...

198
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,313
and if it's not true,
then he must...

199
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,444
We are informed he has extended
his visit to China.

200
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:07,615
l say on behalf of
the American people, come home.

201
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:10,524
Face the music,
whatever that may be.

202
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,050
The election's in 11 days.

203
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,289
Let the American people decide.

204
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,797
"Let the American people
decide."

205
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:18,630
Senator Neal,
presidential candidate.

206
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:20,226
Excuse me, Senator...

207
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,203
That's 11 days
till the election...

208
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:24,798
and the president
ahead in the polls by--Bob?

209
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,274
Seventeen percent.

210
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:30,370
Accusations have surfaced which
could affect the outcome...

211
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:31,778
The White House has announced...

212
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:33,577
in response
to the media pressure...

213
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:35,413
there will be
a press conference.

214
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,681
This is how
a Hollywood producer lives?

215
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,245
This is bigger
than the White House.

216
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,922
Get me my veggie shake...

217
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:47,395
and remind me
to turn over in 10 minutes...

218
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,830
to tan the other side.

219
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,664
Do l know you?

220
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:55,193
We have mutual friends
in Washington.

221
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:58,639
Yes, as you said,
and is it true?

222
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,665
Mr. Motss, l wouldn't--

223
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,508
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't true.

224
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:07,312
Really, who could say?

225
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,944
l like the guy.
He signed his book to me...

226
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:13,114
"For two generations--"
What was it?

227
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:15,817
"For progress to occur,"
l think he said.

228
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:18,918
Two Generations to Agree, yes.

229
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:20,952
That's what he inscribed.
How'd you know that?

230
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:22,328
That's the title of the book.

231
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,696
That's the title?

232
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,996
For Progress to Occur
lt's Necessary for Two--

233
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:29,470
That's a terrible title.

234
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,335
You're right.

235
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:37,244
For Two Generations to Agree.
That is the title.

236
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,907
l never looked at the cover.

237
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:39,915
l just looked
at what he wrote to me.

238
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:42,144
When you get the time,
read the cover.

239
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:45,483
John Levy is expected to respond
to the allegations...

240
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,182
of sexual misconduct
by the president.

241
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:49,949
This guy is fucked.

242
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,288
What one has to do, Mr. Motss,
is fight a holding action.

243
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,063
They'll run this man
through the shredder.

244
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:03,003
lf we hold the break
in the dam till the election...

245
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,370
we got a chance.

246
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:06,705
You can't hold the dam.

247
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,972
l don't get
what you want me to do.

248
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:14,746
...advised him to stay
in China for one or two days.

249
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:17,719
During that time,
of course, we'll remain--

250
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,721
But he's gotta
come back sometime.

251
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,620
What is one or two days
gonna buy you?

252
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,284
Look at all those hands.

253
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:24,987
Brer Rabbit
couldn't get out of this.

254
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:27,325
Would you comment please
on the rumors...

255
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:30,389
that the president's delay...

256
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,526
is due to the situation
in Albania?

257
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:36,029
There is...

258
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:38,540
l'm not aware of the situation
to which you refer.

259
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,565
We've just learned
that the State Department...

260
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:44,045
has set up a special Albanian
task force at Ops Center.

261
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,312
Mr. Sklansky, l am--We have--
Mrs. Rose?

262
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:52,219
Early this morning,
General Scott flew to Seattle.

263
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:55,451
ls his trip connected
with the B-3 bomber?

264
00:13:55,491 --> 00:14:00,485
To the best of my knowledge,
there is no B-3 bomber.

265
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,555
Mr. Levy, is the situation
in Albania related...

266
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:06,090
to the Muslim fundamentalist
anti-American uprising?

267
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:08,797
Now they get it.

268
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:11,864
There you go.
There's a little help.

269
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:15,673
...that have
fundamentalist movements...

270
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,804
How close are you to this?

271
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:19,712
What do you want the kid to say?

272
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:26,317
We will keep you apprised
of any new information.

273
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:29,916
At this time,
there is no information...

274
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,894
Have him say...

275
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:35,863
l know we're all concerned
for the president.

276
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:40,062
l'm sure that our hopes
and prayers are with him.

277
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,002
Could you have Levy say...

278
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,029
"l know we're all concerned
for the president.

279
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:45,540
"l'm sure our hopes
and prayers are with him."

280
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:52,879
l want to say l know we are all
concerned for the president...

281
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,383
and our hopes and prayers
are with him.

282
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:56,646
He didn't phrase it right.

283
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,209
He didn't sell the line.

284
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:04,689
You bought yourself one day,
maybe two.

285
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:07,218
All l need
is 11 till the election.

286
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,663
This isn't gonna hold
for 11 days.

287
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:11,825
-The guy fucked a Girl Scout.
-A Firefly Girl.

288
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,097
He fucked a Firefly Girl.

289
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:16,502
What are you gonna do
to hold that off?

290
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:18,234
l'm gonna get my veggie shake.

291
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:19,707
What do you think
would hold it off?

292
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:20,902
Nothing.

293
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:25,372
You'd have to have a war.

294
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:31,652
You're kidding.
You're not kidding.

295
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:38,627
l'm in show business.
Why come to me?

296
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,124
l'll tell you why.

297
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,860
"54, 40, or fight."
What does that mean?

298
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,891
-lt's a slogan.
-"Remember the Maine."

299
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:49,737
"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too."

300
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:52,706
They're war slogans.

301
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:55,266
We remember the slogans,
not the wars.

302
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,676
You know why?

303
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,680
That's show business.
That's why we're here.

304
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:00,944
Naked girl, covered in napalm.

305
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,314
"V" for victory.

306
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:05,411
5 Marines raising the flag,
Mount Surabachi.

307
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:08,816
You remember the picture
in 50 years, but forget the war.

308
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:11,588
The Gulf War, smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

309
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,822
2,500 missions a day, 100 days.

310
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:16,127
One video of one bomb.

311
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:17,894
The American people
bought that war.

312
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,902
War is show business.
That's why we're here.

313
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,530
What do you do
for the president?

314
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,106
Why Albania?

315
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,769
Why not?

316
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,505
They gotta know at some point.

317
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:30,705
Who?

318
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:35,616
The public.

319
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:37,118
They gotta know?

320
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:39,178
Get with it.
Who killed Kennedy?

321
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:41,382
l read the first draft
of the Warren Report.

322
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:43,550
Says he was killed
by a drunk driver.

323
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:45,856
The Gulf War.
What do you see day after day?

324
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:47,954
The one smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

325
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:49,259
The truth?

326
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,528
l was in the building
when we shot that shot.

327
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,535
We shot it in a studio
in Falls Church, Virginia.

328
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:54,934
1/10 scale model of a building.

329
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,198
ls that true?

330
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:58,206
How do we know?
You take my point?

331
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,901
All right.

332
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:02,308
You want me to do what?

333
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:03,709
To produce.

334
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,340
You want me to produce your war?

335
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:08,247
Not a war.
lt's a pageant.

336
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:10,844
We need a theme,
a song, some visuals.

337
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:12,285
lt's a pageant.

338
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:14,380
lt's like the Oscars.
That's why we came to you.

339
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:16,118
l never won an Oscar.

340
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,490
That's a shame,
but you produced the Oscars.

341
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:20,154
lndeed, l did.

342
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,528
You're a writer,
that's your script.

343
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:24,829
You're a director,
but if you're the producer...

344
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,495
nobody knows what you do.

345
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:29,401
The producer,
all he's got is the credit.

346
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,872
You see?
And some plaques on the wall.

347
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:34,842
They don't know what we do.
Don't get me started.

348
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,709
lf you never won an Oscar...

349
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,338
how would you like
an ambassadorship?

350
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,179
An ambassadorship?
That's my payoff?

351
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,845
Tell me what you want.

352
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:46,684
l'd just do it
for a story to tell.

353
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:48,155
You couldn't tell anybody.

354
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,351
l'm just kidding.

355
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:52,986
-You couldn't tell anybody.
-Just a figure of speech.

356
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,394
lt's a pageant.

357
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:56,659
That's what it is.

358
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:57,961
The country's at war.

359
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,228
lt's Miss America.
You're Bert Parks.

360
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:01,099
-Why Albania?
-Because.

361
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:03,696
What do we have
that they want?

362
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:05,730
-Freedom.
-Why would they want that?

363
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:09,175
-Oppressed?
-Fuck freedom.

364
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,476
They want to destroy
the godless Satan.

365
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,709
They want to destroy
our way of life.

366
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,012
All right?

367
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,179
The president is in China.

368
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:22,190
He is dealing with the dispatch
of the B-3 bomber to Albania.

369
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,420
Why?

370
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,153
Why? Help me.

371
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,127
Geo-politically...

372
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,199
We found out they have the bomb.

373
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:45,477
-That's good.
-And...wait a second.

374
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:49,112
The bomb's not there...

375
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:52,245
because they'd have to have
a rocket and that shit.

376
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:55,485
They are a bunch of wogs.
Cross that out.

377
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:57,617
lt's a suitcase bomb.

378
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,594
l didn't know l said that.

379
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:02,096
lt's a suitcase bomb.
You don't need missiles.

380
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,962
You can put a bomb
in a suitcase.

381
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:08,793
That's good.
A suitcase bomb.

382
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,236
lt's a suitcase bomb.

383
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,674
When it's cooking, it's cooking.

384
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:15,836
We're cooking, and it's in...

385
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:20,408
Canada. All right?

386
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,009
Albanian terrorists
have placed a suitcase bomb...

387
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:27,250
in Canada in an attempt
to infiltrate it into the USA.

388
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:30,588
-That's good.
-That's terrific.

389
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,856
l'll tell you why.
lt is cost effective.

390
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:35,159
lt's producing.
That's what it is.

391
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:37,791
-lt's really great.
-l could tell you stories.

392
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,131
Cecil B. De Mille,
The Greatest Show on Earth...

393
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,137
he needs an elephant.

394
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:43,399
l got the president on the line.

395
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,234
One minute.

396
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:50,873
Needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Know what he does?

397
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,347
Ames here. Yes, sir?

398
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:55,350
You listening?

399
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:57,477
-Nobody's listening.
-l'm listening.

400
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,818
-The suitcase bomb.
-Good title for a movie.

401
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:02,915
Please, write it down.
Don't editorialize.

402
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,290
The thinking is, terrorism.

403
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:08,785
Act One:
Albania denies everything.

404
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,062
The president comes on the air,
"Be calm."

405
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,398
Know what l need?

406
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:17,201
Get me Johnny Dean,
Liz Butsky, and the Fad King.

407
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,729
lsn't Johnny Dean in the...

408
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:22,071
Back in Nashville.

409
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,669
-Act Two.
-We don't need an Act Two.

410
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:28,512
Don't forget Fad King.
We don't need an Act Two?

411
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,541
We just have to hold
their interest for 11 days.

412
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:32,554
lt's a teaser.

413
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:34,249
Absolutely right.

414
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:37,315
Grace. Teaser.

415
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,055
They're getting a good reaction
on the Albanian thing.

416
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:43,222
Hello, John, you two-bit
redneck shitkicker.

417
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:45,028
How the heck are you?

418
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,035
Get out.

419
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,773
He's got a new wife.

420
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:56,574
He's riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.

421
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:03,342
We need you here yesterday.

422
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:06,718
All right?
Get your ass out here.

423
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:09,223
The president wonders about
the possible Albanian backlash.

424
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:11,783
You can't have a war
without an enemy.

425
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,193
We could, but it would be dull.

426
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,719
How long do we need him?

427
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:17,527
We're done in 11 days.

428
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,830
Eleven days. We need you.

429
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:22,393
You want to write a song for us?

430
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:24,201
ls there gonna be a back end?

431
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,242
ls there a back end?

432
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:29,073
Back end?

433
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:31,079
Percentage points, money.

434
00:21:31,113 --> 00:21:32,603
Count on it.

435
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:35,412
Where is the back end
coming from?

436
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:38,147
lt's like
that yellow ribbon thing.

437
00:21:38,187 --> 00:21:40,883
The hostages.

438
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:43,289
They tied the yellow ribbons
around everything.

439
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:45,225
But that was
a naturally occurring--

440
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,454
That was a put-up job?

441
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,529
l want you to get Johnny
a ticket.

442
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:58,130
Fad King on two.

443
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:01,142
He's riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.

444
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,173
Are you shitting me?

445
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:08,115
King, got a thing here,
product placement.

446
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,412
Of course there's a back end.

447
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:13,917
-lt can't be a ribbon.
-What's wrong with a ribbon?

448
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:15,856
AlDS has
the yellow ribbon thing.

449
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,153
Fuck ribbons.

450
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:18,887
Canada.
Our neighbor to the north...

451
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:21,657
all of a sudden transformed
into that place from whence...

452
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:23,858
like the north wind,
terror comes.

453
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:25,366
l like that. Keep talking.

454
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,095
What guards us against Canada?

455
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:30,593
l guard the Canadian border.

456
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,129
Mounties guard the border.
Mountie hats.

457
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:33,607
Stupid fucking hats.

458
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,041
Davy Crockett had a hat.

459
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:38,205
You could crush them
and put them in your pocket.

460
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,807
You can't put a mountie hat
in your pocket.

461
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:43,511
You see this?
This is what producing is.

462
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:47,716
You put me in a room
with talent...electric.

463
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,451
l'm thinking armbands.

464
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:53,894
-Armbands is good.
-l'm thinking green.

465
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,898
Last year, the number one color
in new cars was green.

466
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:59,093
-People like green.
-Hunter.

467
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:02,126
Hunter green.
Strong, pride, dignity.

468
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,035
Not Kelly green.

469
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:06,267
l like it with a hat.

470
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:08,299
-Maybe.
-You see that?

471
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:14,446
Sit on my lap if you love me...

472
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:17,384
but don't put your hand
down there.

473
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:18,784
l didn't mean--

474
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,618
We'll take a short nap.

475
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:23,887
l thought you should see it.

476
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:25,359
lt shouldn't be a song.

477
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:29,660
l'm glad that your mama's
not here.

478
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:31,290
Don't do a song about it.

479
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,561
l thought it was funny.

480
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:33,898
Sit on my lap...

481
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:37,531
l don't think it's appropriate
for what we're doing.

482
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:38,471
l just meant for you to see it.

483
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:42,876
l guard the Canadian border.

484
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:45,175
The president spent the weekend
pressing the flesh.

485
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:47,238
He wasn't campaigning.
He was dating, actually.

486
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:53,852
Change this. Thank you.

487
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,756
Behind the mention of Albania,
of his stomach flu...

488
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,920
taking refuge these scant days
away from the election.

489
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:02,053
Young girl in rubble.

490
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:05,260
She was driven from her home
by Albanian terrorists.

491
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,064
lt is her
we are mobilizing to defend.

492
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:11,004
-Or is it she?
-lt is her.

493
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,529
Can we get her a kitten?

494
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:14,940
Young girl in rubble
with a kitten.

495
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:16,239
That's good.

496
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:19,475
This is too static.

497
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:22,108
Young girl running
from the village.

498
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,412
More energy.

499
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:25,920
Time to face
these terrible charges...

500
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:29,253
to answer
all of these questions.

501
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,316
-What's this?
-Head shots.

502
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,093
Girls to play the victim
in our news footage.

503
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:37,393
Write this down.

504
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,832
Young girl running
from village towards camera.

505
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:42,564
Grainy hand-held news footage.

506
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:43,935
Send it to everyone.

507
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:47,237
What do you think?
l like the sorrowful one.

508
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:49,436
What is this again?

509
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:52,470
Young Albanian girl
running from her home.

510
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:53,776
l like this broad here.

511
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:56,511
Where? Too Texan.

512
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,280
We're locked into Albania.
Why?

513
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,651
Albania's hard to rhyme.

514
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:02,247
What are you looking at me for?

515
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,689
lt's the name of the country.

516
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:10,222
That rhymes.

517
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,329
-John Belushi?
-Jim.

518
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:15,802
Jim Belushi.

519
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:18,067
-Jim Belushi what?
-Albanian?

520
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:19,903
Jim Belushi's Albanian?

521
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,306
Are you kidding?

522
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:24,676
Know anybody who's eaten
in an Albanian restaurant?

523
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:27,443
-ls there such a thing?
-Has to be.

524
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:31,213
-ls there a national dish?
-We can make it up.

525
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:33,050
Jim Belushi is Albanian.

526
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:51,135
What time is it?

527
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,202
3:03.

528
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,504
Great idea.

529
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:59,071
To the men and women of
the 303 detachment with their...

530
00:25:59,114 --> 00:26:00,604
Leopard skin.

531
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:02,674
With their berets.

532
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:04,151
How about all black?

533
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,154
That's good.

534
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,587
Half black, half leopard...

535
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:09,783
wear it on your head.

536
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:12,726
Half black, half leopard...

537
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:15,321
wear it to your bed.

538
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:17,661
Half black, half leopard.

539
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,860
l guard...

540
00:26:21,203 --> 00:26:23,103
the American dream.

541
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:26,867
l guard...

542
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:30,803
the American dream.

543
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:42,019
Everybody's always
in a hurry these days.

544
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:44,048
lf they're not
rushing somewhere...

545
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:46,686
they're changing something
that doesn't need changing.

546
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:50,129
That's why l'm glad
we're behind the president.

547
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:53,601
Sure we are.
lt just makes good sense.

548
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:56,069
You don't want to change
horses in midstream.

549
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:58,436
Why are they sticking
with this age-old horseshit?

550
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:00,737
Why are they sticking
with the same garbage?

551
00:27:00,776 --> 00:27:03,939
-Who hires these people?
-l feel insulted having seen it.

552
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:07,073
-lt's offensive.
-Poorly costumed.

553
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:10,778
New York Times,
Washington Post: war.

554
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:13,879
Times got the Firefly Girl
in the Style section.

555
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:16,686
Post on page 12.

556
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:18,886
lt's good. Hello?

557
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:21,961
lt's very important. Listen up.

558
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:25,296
lt's all war.
You're doing good.

559
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,995
Would you vote for that person
based on that commercial?

560
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:30,231
-l don't vote.
-Why don't you vote?

561
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:32,570
When Major League Baseball
started the fans voting...

562
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,040
l voted for Boog Powell
on first base.

563
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:36,373
He didn't get in,
and it disappointed me.

564
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:37,673
lt's futile.

565
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:39,680
You've never voted
for president?

566
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:41,943
Do you vote?

567
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:44,713
No. l always vote
for the Academy Awards...

568
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:46,084
but l never win.

569
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:47,349
Liz, do you vote?

570
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:49,949
l don't vote.
l don't like the rooms.

571
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:52,289
Too claustrophobic.
l can't vote in small places.

572
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:55,026
lt's about that time.

573
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,375
We got the Albanian girl
with a cat, a kitten, and a dog.

574
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,571
l don't want a dog.
l asked for a kitten.

575
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:13,672
l understand that,
but the pet wrangler suggested--

576
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:16,843
l need to speak to the president
before you pick an animal.

577
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:20,252
Can't they find me a kitten?
Listen to me.

578
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:22,586
Albanian terrorists
have a staging area...

579
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:25,286
for their atomic workshop.
That's why she's fleeing.

580
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,420
What if it wasn't Albania?
Say it was ltaly?

581
00:28:27,462 --> 00:28:30,226
l can get a lot of cash
if it's ltaly.

582
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:33,462
"Give them the boot."
What if a shoe was the fad?

583
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:36,527
The little girl
is coming toward the camera.

584
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:39,199
What does she have in her hands?
A kitten.

585
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,175
Albania doesn't
do anything for me.

586
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:42,608
That's the problem.

587
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:45,112
-We're locked into Albania.
-Why is that?

588
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,514
The president's going to war
in about 30 minutes.

589
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,018
Declaring war on Albania?

590
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:53,213
We're not declaring war.
We're going to war.

591
00:28:53,255 --> 00:28:55,587
We haven't declared war
since World War ll.

592
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:57,091
We're going to war.

593
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:03,889
This late-breaking news
just in from Air Force One.

594
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:05,365
The president
of the United States...

595
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,801
has said he apologizes
for the need for secrecy...

596
00:29:08,837 --> 00:29:10,998
and he assures
that it is necessary...

597
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,769
for the safety of the men
and women in combat.

598
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:15,969
He says that
the Republic of Albania...

599
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:19,742
long a staging ground
for terrorism around the world.

600
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:23,717
He mentioned a state of war
is or is about to happen...

601
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:26,653
between the United States
and the Republic of Albania.

602
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:28,221
How many kittens do we have?

603
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:30,554
There ought to be
kittens a-plenty. l called.

604
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:34,191
People, let's get started.

605
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,564
My name is Stanley Motss.
l'll be your producer.

606
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,694
What l would like you to do,
Miss--

607
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:42,964
Tracy Lime.

608
00:29:43,004 --> 00:29:45,268
Stand against that wall,
and on my signal...

609
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:47,605
l want you running toward me,
screaming.

610
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,735
-Can we get you anything?
-l'm fine.

611
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:52,770
How about a cup of tea?
A little milk, low fat?

612
00:29:52,814 --> 00:29:54,042
You OK?

613
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:56,209
Fine. Let's try one.

614
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:58,583
ls this a national?
ls that the case?

615
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,679
lt's a direct buy-out.

616
00:30:00,722 --> 00:30:03,156
Have your agent--
What is this?

617
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:05,091
What is this, a menagerie?

618
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:07,651
l can't wait to put this
on my resume.

619
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:10,529
Can l talk to you for a minute?

620
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:12,260
This is a special kind
of situation.

621
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:17,104
We have a schnauzer
and what appears to be--

622
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,298
lt's a Lhasa apso.

623
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:21,366
lt couldn't have been simpler.
Kittens.

624
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:25,539
What you got here
is a cross between a dog--

625
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,343
l just want kittens.

626
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:29,907
Absolutely, sir.
The president wants a kitten.

627
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:32,044
l want a kitten.

628
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,215
Get rid of the dogs
and keep the kittens.

629
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:36,723
Miss. Excuse me.

630
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:39,488
l have to have you sign
this sheet of paper.

631
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:42,121
My agent would be miffed
with me if l--

632
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:43,926
This doesn't have to do
with your deal.

633
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,990
This is your security clearance.

634
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:48,664
Right there.

635
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:52,571
Nice signature. Thank you.

636
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,006
Nice meeting you.

637
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,943
This is a nice one.

638
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:02,711
That's a cat.
These are kittens.

639
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,412
They wanted to give options.

640
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:08,445
lt's too confusing.
He's pushing the Lopso opso.

641
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,549
-We'll do it optically.
-Digitally.

642
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,685
Let's try to shoot one.

643
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:14,422
-Stacey--
-Tracy.

644
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:16,930
l want you to stand over here.

645
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:19,263
Here you go. Right there.

646
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,631
These are chips.

647
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:25,768
Hold the bag when you run.

648
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:27,741
lt's for the arm position.
On screen, it'll be a kitten.

649
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:29,243
Can l hold the kitten?

650
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:30,744
We'll punch it in later.

651
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,508
You're gonna punch
the kitten later?

652
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:33,775
Why?

653
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,578
For a wider set of options.

654
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,983
A wider option of what?

655
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:39,714
Of kittens.

656
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:45,925
Sir, all kidding aside,
l get to put it on my resume?

657
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,552
Actually, no.

658
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:50,996
What is it,
a guild thing or something?

659
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:53,364
You can never tell anyone
you did this.

660
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:54,698
What could they do?

661
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:57,170
They'd come to your house
and kill you.

662
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:59,332
The president.

663
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:01,569
Stop the makeup.
She's been raped by terrorists.

664
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,509
-She's not pale enough.
-Jump out.

665
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:05,911
They're starting to shoot now...

666
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:09,075
and they're gonna
do the kitten thing optically.

667
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,846
That's right, Mr. President.

668
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,819
l don't know how
they do the kitten optically...

669
00:32:12,854 --> 00:32:14,788
but they know
what they're doing.

670
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:21,759
She's not an illegal immigrant,
is she?

671
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:23,024
Could l see the contract?

672
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:24,895
Why is it so flat?

673
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:28,425
Because the president cannot
employ an illegal immigrant.

674
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,267
-Let's use more spray.
-Cover up.

675
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:32,136
Let's keep working!

676
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:33,697
Are we getting there?

677
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,645
Good.
Put the village behind her.

678
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,258
Gimme some flames.

679
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:56,127
How about some screaming?

680
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:57,461
Screaming's good.

681
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,433
Some sound of screaming.

682
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:06,703
What might be good
is ooh-ahh sirens.

683
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:08,732
You know. Anne Frank.

684
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:10,835
That's good.

685
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:12,813
Find us the Anne Frank sirens.

686
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:14,678
That's chilling. That's good.

687
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:16,183
That's giving me goose bumps.

688
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:18,775
Find us the ooh-ahhs.

689
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,788
We're gonna be back
in Washington when?

690
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:29,353
We'll be back tonight.

691
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,058
Tonight is...

692
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:34,034
lt seems that Senator Neal
has discovered something.

693
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:36,628
lt makes no difference
about Senator Neal.

694
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:39,435
l don't care what he's got.
We got a war.

695
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:43,238
Look at that girl.

696
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:44,768
Doesn't she look Albanian?

697
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:47,303
She looks like she was
born and raised in Albania.

698
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:51,184
l got an instinct for casting.
Don't ask me why.

699
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,153
We're gonna do it again,
sweetie.

700
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:55,418
-What's her name, Stacey?
-Tracy.

701
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,720
One more time.
You're doing fine.

702
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:02,462
Could she be running
across a bridge?

703
00:34:03,865 --> 00:34:06,925
She's running across
a burning bridge.

704
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:16,604
-That looks good.
-That's beautiful.

705
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:18,441
Of course,
we'll need some water.

706
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,276
ls it a stream?

707
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:21,680
l think...

708
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:24,082
-A pond?
-l think...

709
00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:26,643
l think it's a calico kitten.

710
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
She's running across
with a kitten.

711
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,724
Can we have a calico kitten?
Please?

712
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,387
Floyd, punch in a calico kitten.

713
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,056
l have 19 screens here.

714
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,860
l can't see one calico kitten.

715
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:41,596
The thinking is
a small calico kitten, sir.

716
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:51,244
We have a small calico kitten.

717
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:56,247
-What?
-He wants a white one.

718
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:58,218
He wants a white one?

719
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:01,411
Let me talk to him.

720
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:03,424
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

721
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,255
Can l talk to him?

722
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:07,056
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

723
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:11,631
l hate it
when they start to meddle.

724
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,133
Can we have a white one?

725
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:14,532
He wants a white one.

726
00:35:18,373 --> 00:35:19,670
Thank you.

727
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,245
Are we ready yet?

728
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:34,278
How soon can we get this cut?

729
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:36,017
4 or 5 hours.

730
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:38,992
That's good.
We can leak that to the press...

731
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:41,552
they can downlink it
on Tel star 401, transporter 21.

732
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,289
Makes you glad
you've lived this long.

733
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:51,329
This just in--a special report
from the Albanian front.

734
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:52,737
We've just received
information...

735
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:56,039
the young Albanian national
fleeing in this video...

736
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:57,977
is attempting to escape
terrorist reprisals...

737
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,274
in her village.

738
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,310
America has seldom witnessed...

739
00:36:06,354 --> 00:36:08,481
a more poignant picture
of the human race...

740
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:10,548
Fantastic.

741
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:12,252
They used the same process...

742
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:13,920
with the last
Schwarzenegger movie.

743
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,025
lsn't that amazing
how they do that?

744
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:19,397
This is only the beginning.

745
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,163
Wait till we get the song.

746
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:23,898
Then you got the song, image,
merchandising tie-ins.

747
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:25,269
This is only the beginning.

748
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:28,332
We were right.
You're the man.

749
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:30,435
To the beginning.

750
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:31,945
Got your car.

751
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:34,675
l hate it
when they send these long ones.

752
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,241
-Did you make the turn OK?
-Not a problem.

753
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:39,412
l'm sorry.
You think it's too ostentatious?

754
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:40,853
Just fine. l'll stretch out.

755
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,219
Good. Just make due.

756
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:45,225
l'll see you in Nashville.

757
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,656
Go with the two-tone hat.

758
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:52,165
l don't care.
You work it out.

759
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,363
You. You must have had
similar situations in the past.

760
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:59,100
There are unconfirmed reports
from a reliable source...

761
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,971
that things are in motion.

762
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:03,568
What l'm hearing--
and this is a quote--

763
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:05,511
"The president
is looking for a swift...

764
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:07,844
"painless, and victorious
conclusion to the war."

765
00:37:07,882 --> 00:37:10,976
However, the source
will not go on record.

766
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:14,146
All l can tell you is this
comes from the highest level.

767
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:16,019
New York Times,
Washington Post...

768
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:17,388
Detroit Register,
Sacramento Bee...

769
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:20,417
all in remission.
No mention of the Firefly Girl.

770
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:23,055
10 days to go.
Big Bird lands when?

771
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:24,621
Five a.m.

772
00:37:24,665 --> 00:37:25,962
Anything at the airport?

773
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,729
The press thought no.
What do you think?

774
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:29,760
Here's what l think.
ls it gonna rain?

775
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:31,533
Can you give me the weather
tomorrow morning?

776
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:33,062
Andrews, five a.m.

777
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:35,166
A young Albanian girl...

778
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:36,972
dressed in her...whatever.

779
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:40,538
ls there
some harvest festival...

780
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:42,913
an Albanian harvest festival,
something like that?

781
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,180
Find me
an Albanian harvest festival.

782
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,516
There's gotta be something.

783
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:48,681
Anyway, she gives him
the sacred whatever it is...

784
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:51,487
telling him this is a sacred
traditional offering...

785
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,994
given to the man
who ties the first sheaf...

786
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:56,155
the last sheaf,
who knows what sheaf?

787
00:37:56,197 --> 00:37:57,596
ls she saying this in Albanian?

788
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,929
She's speaking in Albanian...

789
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:01,230
because this is the only way
it can be understood...

790
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,931
by her sacred, sainted,
and aged mother...

791
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:06,906
We're picking them up now.

792
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:10,172
The old lady starts to speak.

793
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:12,076
"You have brought peace
not only to this--"

794
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:14,479
The child speaks.

795
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:16,380
A face of innocence,
no cynicism.

796
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,714
The child says...

797
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:19,379
Are you getting this?

798
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,184
The old broad starts to cry.

799
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:24,191
Big Bird shrugs off
his secret service,...

800
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:26,352
covers her with his coat,
end of story.

801
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:30,194
Can you find out if we could
get some rain tomorrow?

802
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:32,062
How is Big Bird holding up?

803
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,327
He's good.

804
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:36,359
He does want to know--
what does Motss want?

805
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:38,929
l don't know.
Ambassador to Togo.

806
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:42,272
No rain tomorrow at Andrews,
but there's rain at Boca Raton.

807
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,278
Then direct the plane to Boca.

808
00:38:44,312 --> 00:38:46,542
Connie says
divert the plane to Boca.

809
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:54,683
What's happening?

810
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:12,996
Can l help you?

811
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,371
What's the problem?

812
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,100
We're in a rush.

813
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:19,408
Do you know who we are?

814
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:21,312
l'm afraid that's the trouble,
Miss Ames.

815
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,112
ClA.

816
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:32,217
l have this to say...

817
00:39:41,302 --> 00:39:44,294
...every American man,
woman, and child...

818
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,999
What am l gonna do?

819
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,473
l have
a three-year-old daughter...

820
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:49,339
eventually headed
for orthodonture.

821
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:52,210
Now that the ClA knows,
l'm gonna lose everything--

822
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:54,441
my career, my reputation.
What am l gonna do?

823
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:56,450
Brazen it through.

824
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:58,213
Took you long enough.

825
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:00,345
We found them
as soon as we could.

826
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:02,253
All right.

827
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,259
After l'm done with them,
what do they want me to do?

828
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:07,693
Lug them back to the district
or dump them in the country...

829
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:09,218
let the FBl trip over them?

830
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:11,254
Legal department says you pick.

831
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:12,857
Depends on what we want
to do with them.

832
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,698
This is a special report
on the war in Albania.

833
00:40:15,736 --> 00:40:17,328
We've just received
more details...

834
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:19,339
on the Albanian girl
running for her life.

835
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:21,000
The young girl
was trying to escape...

836
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:23,010
after hearing
her family was killed.

837
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:25,444
Apparently, there was
a family connection in Canada.

838
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:31,475
Two things l know to be true...

839
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:35,588
there's no difference between
good flan and bad flan...

840
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:37,147
and there is no war.

841
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:38,488
Guess who l am.

842
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:41,518
l would like to point out
that l am under medical care...

843
00:40:41,562 --> 00:40:43,996
and taking medication,
side effects of which have--

844
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:45,692
Quite touching.

845
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,394
l also take this opportunity...

846
00:40:47,435 --> 00:40:50,131
to suggest that, equally,
l admit to nothing...

847
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:51,729
and l would like
my lawyer present.

848
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:53,706
We show, and NSA confirms...

849
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,608
there are no nuclear devices
on the Canadian border.

850
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:58,874
There are no nuclear devices
in Albania.

851
00:40:58,913 --> 00:41:00,904
Albania has no nuclear capacity.

852
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:02,609
Our spy satellites...

853
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,811
show no secret
terrorist training camps...

854
00:41:04,852 --> 00:41:06,786
in the Albanian hinterland.

855
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,790
The border patrol, the FBl,
the RCMP report...

856
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:13,453
no--repeat--
no untoward activity...

857
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:15,792
along our picturesque
Canadian border.

858
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:18,822
The Albanian government
is screaming its defense.

859
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:20,163
The world is listening.

860
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:21,634
There is no war.

861
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:24,194
There's a war.
l'm watching it on television.

862
00:41:24,238 --> 00:41:26,229
Who might you be?

863
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:28,867
-Conrad Brean.
-Who do you work for?

864
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:32,310
Nobody whose name
you want me to say.

865
00:41:32,346 --> 00:41:35,406
lt's all well, but when the fit
hits the shan...

866
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,041
somebody has to stay
after school.

867
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:38,574
Who might that be?

868
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:40,951
l don't know
what you're talking about.

869
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:43,456
The spy satellites show it.

870
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,788
They show no war.

871
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:46,349
Then what good are they?

872
00:41:46,394 --> 00:41:49,727
Why spend a quarter trillion
dollars a year on defense?

873
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:51,197
What good are they?

874
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:52,665
Are they useless or just broken?

875
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,565
l would like
to point out further...

876
00:41:54,602 --> 00:41:56,467
that these medications
taken in conjunction--

877
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:59,166
lf there's no threat,
then where are you?

878
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:00,833
lf there's no threat,
what good are you?

879
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:03,070
You are the threat.

880
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,509
l'm the threat?

881
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:05,978
What have l been doing
the last 30 years...

882
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:08,004
that you haven't been doing?

883
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:09,880
The last 30 years...

884
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,851
l have been working to ensure
the security of my country.

885
00:42:11,886 --> 00:42:14,946
l'm sure that speaks well
of you and your parents...

886
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:17,321
but if forced to choose between
the security of your country...

887
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:19,622
and the security of your job,
which would you pick?

888
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,254
While you hesitate,
permit me to suggest...

889
00:42:22,296 --> 00:42:24,628
that they are one in the same.

890
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:27,156
l'm doing my job.
That's what you see me doing.

891
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:28,793
l'm doing my job, too.

892
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:30,064
The constant stress
l am under...

893
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:33,005
Let me ask you
a simple question.

894
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,372
Why do people go to war?

895
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:37,934
l'll play your silly game.

896
00:42:37,978 --> 00:42:39,240
To ensure their way of life.

897
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,271
-Would you fight to do that?
-l have.

898
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:44,011
lf you went to war again,
who would it be against?

899
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:46,281
Your ability to fight
a two-ocean war against who?

900
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,548
Sweden and Togo?

901
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:49,681
That time has passed.
lt's over.

902
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:52,488
The war of the future
is nuclear terrorism.

903
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:54,460
lt'll be against
a small group of dissidents...

904
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:57,589
who, unbeknownst perhaps to
their own governments, have...

905
00:42:57,631 --> 00:42:59,826
To go to that war,
you have to be prepared.

906
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:02,358
You gotta be alert.
The public has gotta be alert...

907
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:04,598
because that is the war
of the future...

908
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:07,402
and if you're not gearing up
to fight that war...

909
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:09,568
then the ax will fall.
You'll be out in the street.

910
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,704
You can call this a drill,
call this job security...

911
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:15,181
call it anything you like,
but l got one for you.

912
00:43:15,216 --> 00:43:16,877
Go to war
to preserve your way of life?

913
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:20,216
Chuck, this is your way of life.

914
00:43:20,254 --> 00:43:22,222
lf your spy satellites
don't see nothing...

915
00:43:22,256 --> 00:43:23,848
if there ain't no war...

916
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:26,860
then you can go home
and take up golf...

917
00:43:26,894 --> 00:43:28,953
'cause there ain't no war
but ours.

918
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,697
Thank you.

919
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,462
Drive carefully.

920
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,508
Nice enough people.

921
00:43:47,548 --> 00:43:49,140
They just hadn't
thought it through.

922
00:43:49,183 --> 00:43:51,014
You talked us out of there.

923
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:53,212
We got delayed.
We're going to Nashville.

924
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:54,482
What?

925
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:56,319
You could talk a dog
off a meat truck.

926
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:58,257
Thank you.

927
00:43:58,292 --> 00:43:59,725
We just got stuck.

928
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,456
All systems five-by-five.
See you in Nashville.

929
00:44:02,496 --> 00:44:04,088
You saved our bacon.

930
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,361
lt was just a...

931
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,766
a phenomenal performance.

932
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:10,395
You turned them around.

933
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:13,597
They hadn't thought it through.

934
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:22,742
He's moving across the tarmac.

935
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:28,947
But it appears something
has distracted the president...

936
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,480
and he has stopped moving
toward the waiting motorcade.

937
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:33,322
There's a little girl...

938
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,225
trying to speak
to the president.

939
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:37,093
lt seems she's speaking in--

940
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:38,621
ls it Albanian?

941
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,429
Can we get someone
to translate?

942
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:44,066
Dan,
l think what she is saying...

943
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:48,063
is that this wheat offering
is sort of ceremonial...

944
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:50,668
and that it is
the first sheaf...

945
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:52,406
the first cut of the harvest.

946
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:54,437
l'm not proficient
in Albanian...

947
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:56,108
but the old woman
is quite taken...

948
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,414
as the president
is offering her the coat.

949
00:44:58,452 --> 00:45:01,080
lt is quite
an emotional moment here.

950
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:03,453
There comes a time...

951
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:07,657
in the course of human events...

952
00:45:08,362 --> 00:45:11,126
when a threat
must be answered...

953
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:13,897
with courage and strength.

954
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:18,494
Our forefathers earned...

955
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:20,973
the right to be free.

956
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:23,670
Now it's time...

957
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:27,704
to guard their dream.

958
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:30,842
We guard...

959
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:35,049
our American borders.

960
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:37,523
We guard...

961
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:40,721
the American dream.

962
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:43,423
We guard our right...

963
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:48,401
to fight for democracy...

964
00:45:48,435 --> 00:45:53,930
and keep our country free.

965
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:57,802
We guard...

966
00:45:57,845 --> 00:46:00,473
our American spirit.

967
00:46:02,216 --> 00:46:04,446
We guard...

968
00:46:04,485 --> 00:46:07,283
the American dream.

969
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:21,229
Our country's built...

970
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:24,363
on the rock of liberty.

971
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:28,541
And we, as people...

972
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:30,770
must keep it free.

973
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:33,871
lt is for life...

974
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:35,211
liberty...

975
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:38,446
the pursuit of happiness...

976
00:46:38,485 --> 00:46:43,616
Freedom, 'tis of thee.

977
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:47,724
We guard...

978
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:51,822
our American borders.

979
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:54,299
We guard...

980
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:57,304
the American dream.

981
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:00,440
l loved the fat,
wet Albanian broad.

982
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:01,771
Thank you.

983
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:03,572
You know why?
lt was understated.

984
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,339
You got lucky
with the rain, too.

985
00:47:05,379 --> 00:47:07,711
We had to divert
the plane to Boca Raton.

986
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:10,080
You should have come to me.
We have rain machines.

987
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:11,448
l'm a producer. l make rain.

988
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:12,884
Next time.

989
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:15,578
l have just gotten word...

990
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:18,955
that the situation
in Albania is resolved...

991
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:21,257
that it is resolved.

992
00:47:21,295 --> 00:47:22,990
The ClA confirms...

993
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,999
that our troops
along the Canadian border...

994
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:28,763
and overseas are standing down.

995
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:34,098
l must take this opportunity
to call upon our president...

996
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:36,234
What does he mean,
the situation has been resolved?

997
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:37,937
He just ended the war.

998
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:39,240
He ended the war?

999
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:40,712
Why did he do that?

1000
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:42,272
l think the ClA
cut a better deal.

1001
00:47:42,316 --> 00:47:43,578
He ended the war?

1002
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:47,943
He can't end the war.

1003
00:47:47,988 --> 00:47:50,013
He's not producing this.

1004
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:55,256
This is in bad taste.

1005
00:47:55,295 --> 00:47:56,626
Can we stop this?

1006
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,024
Stop. lt's over.

1007
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:04,095
Can we stop this?

1008
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:05,628
Stop the choir.

1009
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:09,404
lt has been quite a week,
Richard.

1010
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:11,775
l can't remember
when any president...

1011
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:13,575
was hit with the flu, a war...

1012
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:16,208
and accused of sexual
misconduct by a teenage girl...

1013
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,683
all in the same
seven-day period.

1014
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:21,415
This, of course, only days
before he runs for reelection.

1015
00:48:21,455 --> 00:48:23,821
We've just received information
from sources at the ClA...

1016
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:27,020
that confirms the cessation
of hostilities...

1017
00:48:27,061 --> 00:48:28,323
The ClA.

1018
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:33,499
l thought they let us out
too easily.

1019
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:35,399
The war's over.

1020
00:48:35,436 --> 00:48:37,461
lt's over.
l saw it on television.

1021
00:48:37,504 --> 00:48:38,766
l have to sell my house.

1022
00:48:38,806 --> 00:48:41,934
The war is not over.

1023
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:43,340
l saw it on TV.

1024
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:46,141
That's what you hired me for.

1025
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,614
The war isn't over
until l say it's over.

1026
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:51,083
This is my picture.
This is not the ClA's picture.

1027
00:48:51,118 --> 00:48:54,087
You think
you're in a tight spot now?

1028
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:56,885
Try making The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

1029
00:48:56,924 --> 00:48:58,892
Three of the horsemen died.

1030
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:01,724
Hear what he's saying?
Three of the horsemen died...

1031
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:03,992
two weeks before the end
of principal photography.

1032
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:06,295
This is nothing.

1033
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:09,530
This is just Act One,
"The War."

1034
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,529
We really do need an Act Two,
so we work.

1035
00:49:13,574 --> 00:49:14,802
Act Two.

1036
00:49:14,842 --> 00:49:16,207
You know what it's like?

1037
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:17,938
The Japanese. ln the caves.

1038
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:20,071
-Go on.
-Okinawa.

1039
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:22,048
They didn't believe
the war was over.

1040
00:49:22,082 --> 00:49:24,175
We have a guy
who doesn't believe--

1041
00:49:24,218 --> 00:49:26,345
We have an American serviceman.

1042
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:29,253
A brave American serviceman
is left behind.

1043
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:31,484
A hero.

1044
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:33,789
l can't believe it.
What was l thinking?

1045
00:49:33,827 --> 00:49:35,590
We had a war.
We forgot the hero.

1046
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:38,462
You can't have a war
and not have a hero.

1047
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:39,864
lt's like we sent
a Christmas card...

1048
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,458
and left out the--
What do you call it?

1049
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:42,799
-Fruitcake.
-There you go.

1050
00:49:42,836 --> 00:49:44,804
Let's work.

1051
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:46,931
We got a guy
who's left behind, so--

1052
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:49,568
This is terrific.
This is lucky this happened.

1053
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,578
He was left behind,
just discarded...

1054
00:49:51,612 --> 00:49:54,809
like an old shoe.

1055
00:49:54,848 --> 00:49:56,076
That's good.

1056
00:49:56,116 --> 00:49:57,845
What's good? What did l say?

1057
00:49:57,885 --> 00:49:59,113
-Shoe.
-Old shoe?

1058
00:49:59,153 --> 00:50:00,415
lt's just instinct.

1059
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:04,517
Get me the Pentagon...

1060
00:50:04,558 --> 00:50:08,187
a list of people in all
military special programs.

1061
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:10,253
"Left behind like an old shoe."
That is good.

1062
00:50:11,465 --> 00:50:13,399
l want to talk to Johnny.

1063
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:18,332
What is it?

1064
00:50:18,372 --> 00:50:21,273
The war is over.

1065
00:50:21,308 --> 00:50:23,572
We're going to need a new song.

1066
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,340
lt should be a song
about a shiny shoe...

1067
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,940
a black patent shoe...

1068
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,779
a good old shoe.

1069
00:50:30,817 --> 00:50:33,581
l was on my way to get drunk.

1070
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,750
You get drunk, but l need
a good old shoe song.

1071
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,224
A ballad of loss...

1072
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:42,927
-Want to help me?
-Redemption.

1073
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:45,796
Loss and redemption
is very good.

1074
00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:49,029
Shit.
What key do you want it in?

1075
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:50,536
l don't know keys.

1076
00:50:51,705 --> 00:50:55,539
People here are depressed
because the war just ended.

1077
00:50:55,576 --> 00:50:57,703
Please give me a new song.

1078
00:50:57,744 --> 00:50:59,541
l got him.

1079
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,707
King, Pentagon.

1080
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:03,272
Take it.

1081
00:51:03,317 --> 00:51:06,946
l need a list
of military special programs.

1082
00:51:06,987 --> 00:51:09,387
Bottom of the ninth.

1083
00:51:09,423 --> 00:51:10,890
They don't know
who they're playing with.

1084
00:51:12,492 --> 00:51:14,551
They don't shut down
our picture.

1085
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:16,426
You people gonna be long?

1086
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:18,363
Otherwise,
l'll put away the equipment.

1087
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:19,626
l don't know what l'm doing.

1088
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:22,430
l think l'm supposed
to be writing a song.

1089
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:23,902
What kind of song?

1090
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:26,269
ls there anybody there named...

1091
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:28,240
Schumann?

1092
00:51:28,275 --> 00:51:30,573
-Schuster?
-Schumacher.

1093
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:31,873
l got a great idea.

1094
00:51:33,614 --> 00:51:35,548
Old shoe, new shoe.

1095
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:39,376
Daddy had a hound dog...

1096
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:42,616
used to call him Blue.

1097
00:51:45,425 --> 00:51:48,087
Follow me 'round...

1098
00:51:48,128 --> 00:51:50,688
stick to me like glue.

1099
00:51:54,701 --> 00:51:57,636
His favorite thing
to play with...

1100
00:51:57,671 --> 00:51:59,730
used to be a good ol' shoe.

1101
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:01,832
Wait a minute.
Used to be.

1102
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,570
You hit that 16-16.

1103
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,601
Well, l wish l had a woman...

1104
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:08,906
who was half as good and true.

1105
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:14,409
Anybody here know Morse code?

1106
00:52:14,454 --> 00:52:15,785
What you gonna do?

1107
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:17,153
Give me the fax.

1108
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:20,326
Sergeant William Schumann,
U.S. Army...

1109
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,296
serial number 2131284262.

1110
00:52:25,565 --> 00:52:26,998
Good ol' shoe...

1111
00:52:27,034 --> 00:52:28,296
Here's the deal.

1112
00:52:29,636 --> 00:52:31,570
Good Ol' Shoe.

1113
00:52:33,907 --> 00:52:35,568
Whatever you walk in...

1114
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:37,201
he will get you through.

1115
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:40,236
He's in a sweater...

1116
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,872
and he's...

1117
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:44,907
We drop him behind enemy lines.

1118
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:46,509
He's trapped.

1119
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:47,986
The sweater.

1120
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:49,818
-ln the sweater.
-Good.

1121
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:55,961
ls there a way we can make it
sound old and scratchy...

1122
00:52:55,996 --> 00:52:57,691
with, like, a hiss?

1123
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:04,133
With an old label.

1124
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:05,638
l see where you're going.

1125
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:13,506
Stand up straight and tall...

1126
00:53:13,547 --> 00:53:15,412
the way he taught you to.

1127
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:17,212
l'll write a speech.

1128
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:21,012
l'll help you with the speech.

1129
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:23,921
The president reveals
that William Schumann...

1130
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,560
was trapped behind enemy lines.

1131
00:53:29,596 --> 00:53:31,530
This is good.

1132
00:53:31,565 --> 00:53:33,362
Heartfelt.

1133
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,662
Touching.

1134
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:37,231
People will weep.

1135
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:40,999
Soul of a good ol' shoe.

1136
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:46,008
He might even get to heaven...

1137
00:53:46,046 --> 00:53:49,106
on the soul of his good ol'...

1138
00:53:49,149 --> 00:53:51,811
shoe.

1139
00:53:56,356 --> 00:53:58,381
Here's the president's speech.

1140
00:53:58,425 --> 00:54:00,450
Put this
in the Library of Congress.

1141
00:54:00,494 --> 00:54:02,189
Folk music section, 1930.

1142
00:54:02,229 --> 00:54:04,163
Right away, please.

1143
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:06,927
Get it in
the Library of Congress now.

1144
00:54:08,635 --> 00:54:10,899
Oh, God.

1145
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:12,928
Who's seeing
the CBS guy tonight?

1146
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:17,473
Tonight, you remember some song
from the folk song days--

1147
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:18,876
about a good old shoe.

1148
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:20,243
Tonight?

1149
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,010
You're with him watching
the president's speech--

1150
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:24,311
What if he's busy?

1151
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:27,047
-Lure him.
-What are you saying?

1152
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:30,250
l don't have to be
your confessor, darling.

1153
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,850
Tell him you've got info
on the sex scandal...

1154
00:54:32,893 --> 00:54:34,190
it's on your conscience.

1155
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:36,058
He'll drop whatever he's doing.

1156
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:38,855
This is a shitty business.

1157
00:54:38,899 --> 00:54:41,060
lt needs no ghost from the grave
to tell us that...

1158
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:43,535
but, Lord willing,
eight days from now...

1159
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,266
l'm gonna take you
into the second term.

1160
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:47,705
Wait till you hear the speech.

1161
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:49,675
The 303 speech. Great.

1162
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,506
Where's that Fad King?

1163
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:52,773
l'll get him.

1164
00:54:52,813 --> 00:54:54,144
Could we go now?

1165
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:56,615
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

1166
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,948
How are they doing
on Sergeant Schumann?

1167
00:54:58,985 --> 00:55:00,782
They're working on him,
they're finding him.

1168
00:55:00,821 --> 00:55:02,413
Good. lt's working.

1169
00:55:02,456 --> 00:55:04,981
lt's all happening.
lt's taking place around us.

1170
00:55:05,025 --> 00:55:08,722
lt is in the works.
lt is being addressed.

1171
00:55:08,762 --> 00:55:10,059
We are being proactive.

1172
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:13,259
We are going out with what
may be the finest example--

1173
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,030
Get me an update on the army,
the Pentagon.

1174
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:17,593
Get this guy Schumann.

1175
00:55:17,637 --> 00:55:19,002
Have him standing by.

1176
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:23,237
l gotta tell you,
l see a lot of glum faces.

1177
00:55:23,276 --> 00:55:24,800
Please don't be disconsolate.

1178
00:55:24,845 --> 00:55:28,110
This is politics at its finest.

1179
00:55:28,148 --> 00:55:31,208
This is where the rubber
meets the road.

1180
00:55:31,251 --> 00:55:33,481
We've got a leader
going out tonight...

1181
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,181
to 95 million American homes.

1182
00:55:35,222 --> 00:55:36,951
He's gonna turn
this thing around.

1183
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,753
You think this is tough?

1184
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:41,659
l was 4 months into production
on The Song of Solomon...

1185
00:55:41,695 --> 00:55:43,253
found out l didn't
have the rights.

1186
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:44,888
Turn it up. lt's our spot.

1187
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:48,162
Tough? This is nothing.

1188
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:51,432
Will you look at that shit?

1189
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:55,005
'Cause you don't change
horses in midstream.

1190
00:55:57,377 --> 00:55:59,811
Don't change horses.

1191
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:01,245
This speech is good.

1192
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:03,476
We're kinda locked into it,
Mr. President.

1193
00:56:05,118 --> 00:56:07,245
For the future
of our families...

1194
00:56:07,287 --> 00:56:09,414
The music.
Where did they get that?

1195
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:15,725
-Pain in the ass.
-What?

1196
00:56:17,964 --> 00:56:20,432
He won't do the speech.

1197
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:22,526
What do you mean?

1198
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:24,400
What choice does he have?

1199
00:56:24,437 --> 00:56:26,405
He won't do the speech?

1200
00:56:26,439 --> 00:56:27,872
He says it's corny.

1201
00:56:27,908 --> 00:56:30,206
lt's what? lt's corny?

1202
00:56:31,478 --> 00:56:32,775
Of course it's corny.

1203
00:56:32,812 --> 00:56:35,474
We wouldn't have him say it
if it wasn't.

1204
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:36,948
lt's not a question.

1205
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:38,712
This is the center
for rest of the thing.

1206
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:39,980
Don't tell me it's corny.

1207
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,454
We're locked into the speech,
right?

1208
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:43,717
We're locked in.

1209
00:56:43,757 --> 00:56:45,657
We are playing way past this.

1210
00:56:45,692 --> 00:56:47,023
We are past this.

1211
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:50,489
This is what l need.

1212
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:54,159
Get me 30 secretaries
and put them in an office now.

1213
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,193
l need to see the president.

1214
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:59,068
l need 5 minutes.

1215
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:01,039
Know what this reminds me of?

1216
00:57:01,074 --> 00:57:04,134
Years ago, when l first
went out to Hollywood...

1217
00:57:04,177 --> 00:57:05,405
they said,
"lt's too theatrical."

1218
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:08,539
l was from the theater.
Everything was over their heads.

1219
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:09,913
He thinks it's corny.

1220
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,611
Don't tell me it's corny.

1221
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:13,118
Tell him l'm comin'.

1222
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:17,180
My fellow Americans,
l thank a merciful God...

1223
00:57:17,223 --> 00:57:19,987
and l am sure
each and every one of us...

1224
00:57:20,026 --> 00:57:21,960
will thank that Supreme Power...

1225
00:57:21,995 --> 00:57:25,226
whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1226
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:27,756
that peace is at hand.

1227
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:31,464
The threat of nuclear terrorism
has been quelled.

1228
00:57:31,504 --> 00:57:34,667
Mr. President, l'm using
a little more projection...

1229
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:38,337
because l think this speech
needs a little umph.

1230
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:41,510
Bear with me.

1231
00:57:43,016 --> 00:57:44,608
Beautiful.

1232
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:47,246
Thank you so much.

1233
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:01,827
That was so moving.

1234
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:03,165
Thank you so much.

1235
00:58:03,203 --> 00:58:04,465
Thank you.

1236
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,975
l felt very much at home
in there.

1237
00:58:14,014 --> 00:58:15,606
Simple quirk of fate.

1238
00:58:15,649 --> 00:58:17,207
l could have gone this way.

1239
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,649
lt's all a change in wardrobe.

1240
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:21,286
Was it too much?

1241
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:24,313
l'll tell you.

1242
00:58:24,357 --> 00:58:25,619
You did it.

1243
00:58:26,693 --> 00:58:27,990
You jumped in there...

1244
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:29,893
and saved the thing
when the thing needed saving.

1245
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:31,920
lt wasn't too much?

1246
00:58:31,965 --> 00:58:33,796
Personally?

1247
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,061
Maybe it was.

1248
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:38,332
The president doesn't
have to say it that way.

1249
00:58:38,371 --> 00:58:39,838
lt's like Plato once said.

1250
00:58:39,873 --> 00:58:41,500
lt doesn't matter
how you get there...

1251
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,803
as long as you get there.

1252
00:58:42,842 --> 00:58:44,104
He said that?

1253
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:46,442
What is it exactly
you do for the president?

1254
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:49,573
My fellow Americans,
l thank a merciful God...

1255
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:53,552
and l'm sure all of us
will thank that Supreme Power...

1256
00:58:53,586 --> 00:58:56,282
whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1257
00:58:56,322 --> 00:58:58,882
that peace is at hand.

1258
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:06,428
The threat of nuclear terrorism
has been quelled.

1259
00:59:06,466 --> 00:59:09,958
We are in contact
with the Albanian premier...

1260
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:11,470
who assures me--

1261
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:13,734
and this government
credits his assurances--

1262
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:16,264
his country
does not wish us ill...

1263
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:17,537
Know any Latin?

1264
00:59:17,577 --> 00:59:19,135
l, Claudius.
That's what l know.

1265
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:22,774
l need a Latin motto
for the patch.

1266
00:59:22,816 --> 00:59:24,443
The 303 patch.

1267
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:28,147
...but by
a designation number, 303.

1268
00:59:28,188 --> 00:59:32,420
A member was left behind
what were then enemy lines.

1269
00:59:32,459 --> 00:59:36,623
l can only say to those
family members of Group 303...

1270
00:59:36,663 --> 00:59:39,359
whose members are,
l know as l speak...

1271
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:40,798
gathering to comfort you.

1272
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:43,302
To the parents
of the missing man...

1273
00:59:43,336 --> 00:59:45,167
no effort will be spared...

1274
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:48,834
to find this brave man
and bring him home.

1275
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:52,311
We've just received
this photograph of Schumann...

1276
00:59:52,345 --> 00:59:55,439
held by a dissident group
of Albanian terrorists.

1277
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:58,610
l don't know how many of you
know Morse code...

1278
00:59:58,651 --> 01:00:01,643
but could you
bring the camera closer?

1279
01:00:01,688 --> 01:00:05,749
You'll see his sweater is worn.

1280
01:00:05,792 --> 01:00:08,260
lt has been unraveled in places.

1281
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:10,023
Those places
form dashes and dots...

1282
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:14,864
and those dots spell out
a message in Morse code.

1283
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:17,631
That message is, "Courage, Mom."

1284
01:00:20,106 --> 01:00:21,573
He got the message through.

1285
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:25,443
Not bad for government work.

1286
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:27,173
Having a good time?

1287
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:29,477
Haven't had this much fun
since live TV.

1288
01:00:29,516 --> 01:00:32,178
To the men and women
of Unit 303...

1289
01:00:32,218 --> 01:00:34,686
to my fellow citizens,
l say, "Courage, Mom."

1290
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:38,680
l have informed Albania
that we will not rest...

1291
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:40,556
until the safe return
of Sergeant Schumann.

1292
01:00:40,593 --> 01:00:44,791
l'm told his unit mates gave him
the nickname "Old Shoe."

1293
01:00:44,831 --> 01:00:48,858
Wasn't there a folk song
called "Old Shoe?"

1294
01:00:48,902 --> 01:00:51,996
Do you remember that?
Something like...

1295
01:00:52,038 --> 01:00:55,030
l don't know.
l can vaguely remember it.

1296
01:00:55,074 --> 01:00:57,304
Do you know
what l'm talking about?

1297
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:01,273
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1298
01:01:01,314 --> 01:01:03,373
Good night and God bless.

1299
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:07,819
Trump that, Senator Neal,
you Howdy-Doody-looking vontz.

1300
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:10,823
As we reported earlier, U.S.
Serviceman Willie Schumann...

1301
01:01:10,857 --> 01:01:12,586
remains missing behind
enemy lines...

1302
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,991
lt's all thinking ahead.

1303
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:16,518
That's what producing is.

1304
01:01:16,563 --> 01:01:18,053
lt's like being a plumber.

1305
01:01:19,899 --> 01:01:22,424
Do your job right,
nobody should notice.

1306
01:01:22,468 --> 01:01:25,369
When you fuck up,
everything gets full of shit.

1307
01:01:25,405 --> 01:01:27,134
...symbol of
the military team...

1308
01:01:27,173 --> 01:01:30,142
Sergeant William Schumann,
the "Old Shoe."

1309
01:01:30,176 --> 01:01:32,838
Let's line up the president
for the Peace Prize.

1310
01:01:32,879 --> 01:01:34,779
Our job ends on election day.

1311
01:01:34,814 --> 01:01:36,543
Come on.

1312
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,746
Just for the symmetry
of the thing?

1313
01:01:39,786 --> 01:01:41,048
That's right.

1314
01:01:41,087 --> 01:01:42,850
lf Kissinger can win
the Peace Prize...

1315
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:46,154
l wouldn't be surprised
if l'd won the Preakness.

1316
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:49,719
But our guy did bring peace.

1317
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:51,286
But there wasn't a war.

1318
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:53,891
All the greater accomplishment.

1319
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:13,485
Where's the money--

1320
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:16,317
where's the tie-in
with throwing away shoes?

1321
01:02:16,356 --> 01:02:18,051
Who pays you for that?

1322
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:20,423
You throw away shoes.
What are you gonna do?

1323
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,927
Buy new ones.

1324
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:24,156
We have some powerful
new friends...

1325
01:02:24,197 --> 01:02:27,132
at the lnternational Association
of Shoe Manufacturers.

1326
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,827
You guys sure get around.

1327
01:02:28,868 --> 01:02:30,995
Fad King is my hero.
Want to go first?

1328
01:02:31,037 --> 01:02:32,800
Sure.

1329
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,399
Attaboy.

1330
01:02:35,441 --> 01:02:37,102
History, Connie.

1331
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:40,568
Those are ratty shoes.

1332
01:02:40,613 --> 01:02:42,843
That's why
we're flinging them away.

1333
01:02:42,882 --> 01:02:45,874
You want to try some?
Go ahead.

1334
01:02:45,919 --> 01:02:47,546
Attaboy.

1335
01:02:47,587 --> 01:02:49,452
Do it again.

1336
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:51,252
Go ahead. Have a ball.

1337
01:02:54,861 --> 01:02:56,954
Watch this.

1338
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:01,757
Go on, tell your friends.

1339
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:06,235
This is interesting.

1340
01:03:06,272 --> 01:03:10,140
l have just been handed this.
Something just discovered.

1341
01:03:10,176 --> 01:03:13,873
A 1930s recording, part of
the folk song collection...

1342
01:03:13,913 --> 01:03:15,437
of the Library of Congress...

1343
01:03:15,481 --> 01:03:18,848
and a fitting song,
if l may say so, about Shoe.

1344
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:20,682
Schumann
is the military soldier...

1345
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,620
who's been left behind
enemy lines...

1346
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,061
Jim, can l get a word with you?

1347
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:35,192
Would you like to comment
on Albania?

1348
01:03:36,836 --> 01:03:39,168
There is one thing
l'd like to say.

1349
01:03:39,205 --> 01:03:43,107
This is to the Albanians
that have this man.

1350
01:03:43,142 --> 01:03:46,441
l mean this from the bottom
of my heart as one of your race.

1351
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:51,644
l didn't know Jim Belushi
was Albanian.

1352
01:03:58,091 --> 01:03:59,922
The search
for Willie Schumann continues...

1353
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:32,289
As soon as we land,
l want a reflexologist.

1354
01:04:32,325 --> 01:04:33,587
Male or female?

1355
01:04:33,626 --> 01:04:35,253
The White House
wants to know about...

1356
01:04:35,294 --> 01:04:36,556
the Congressional Medal
of Honor.

1357
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:38,154
-What about it?
-For Schumann.

1358
01:04:38,197 --> 01:04:40,791
Wait a minute.
We got 86% in favor.

1359
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:44,098
We bring him back tomorrow,
charts don't go down.

1360
01:04:44,137 --> 01:04:45,729
l don't want to tell them
how to do their business...

1361
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:47,239
but why don't they do it
after the election?

1362
01:04:47,273 --> 01:04:49,503
Makes more sense,
and it'll help them more.

1363
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:51,567
When are you bringing him back?

1364
01:04:51,611 --> 01:04:53,579
King, show him the thing.

1365
01:04:53,613 --> 01:04:56,446
-lt's not done yet.
-Show it to him.

1366
01:04:56,482 --> 01:05:00,111
Talk about enlarging the market.
Tell him.

1367
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:02,678
Here it is. Artist's rendering
of the memorial.

1368
01:05:02,722 --> 01:05:04,053
The memorial?

1369
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,650
That's the memorial
of the fallen.

1370
01:05:06,692 --> 01:05:08,057
Of the Albanian campaign.

1371
01:05:08,094 --> 01:05:10,119
-Lovely.
-lt's better than lovely.

1372
01:05:10,163 --> 01:05:12,222
This guy made a deal
with Governor Kneehigh--

1373
01:05:12,265 --> 01:05:13,926
Senator Leahy.

1374
01:05:13,966 --> 01:05:16,491
You should see the granite
you have to put in this thing.

1375
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:18,470
Got a site picked out
and everything.

1376
01:05:18,504 --> 01:05:20,472
The beauty part is...

1377
01:05:20,506 --> 01:05:22,406
guess who retains
the merchandising rights.

1378
01:05:22,442 --> 01:05:24,103
Show him the clock?

1379
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:25,906
Got it as a clock.

1380
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:27,606
Lovely.

1381
01:05:27,647 --> 01:05:29,808
-Let's go.
-When's Schumann coming back?

1382
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:31,146
Getting him right now.

1383
01:05:31,184 --> 01:05:33,584
l need his neck size.

1384
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:34,881
l think it's 17 1/2.

1385
01:05:34,921 --> 01:05:37,116
Thinking 17 1/2
is not good enough.

1386
01:05:37,156 --> 01:05:39,750
l'm an artist,
not a factory worker.

1387
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:41,919
What did he eat
behind enemy lines?

1388
01:05:41,961 --> 01:05:43,553
Birds, snakes.

1389
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:46,565
Bullshit. He ate
tiny cheeseburgers in tin foil.

1390
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:47,998
Pull a string,
they heat themselves.

1391
01:05:48,034 --> 01:05:50,002
We call Burger King,
Johnny Rockets.

1392
01:05:50,036 --> 01:05:52,504
We get the Shoe Burger
with cheese and 303 sauce...

1393
01:05:52,538 --> 01:05:55,234
"Behind enemy lines or anytime."

1394
01:05:55,274 --> 01:05:56,741
That's the slogan.

1395
01:05:56,776 --> 01:05:59,609
l got the copyright
on the Albanian kitten thing.

1396
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:01,772
l'm gonna call Nike,
get Rodman to dye his hair.

1397
01:06:01,814 --> 01:06:03,714
We'll have a sneaker--
"Air Leopard."

1398
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,250
...a high school
basketball game last night...

1399
01:06:09,288 --> 01:06:11,984
between Montgomery Bell
and Blair Park.

1400
01:06:12,024 --> 01:06:13,491
Students, during the game...

1401
01:06:13,526 --> 01:06:16,154
in spontaneous moment
of sheer patriotism...

1402
01:06:16,195 --> 01:06:19,460
threw their tennis shoes
on the court by the hundreds,

1403
01:06:19,499 --> 01:06:21,023
just for the Old Shoe.

1404
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:23,831
Bring him back.
William Schumann...

1405
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,838
There's no business like it.

1406
01:06:25,872 --> 01:06:28,466
Demonstrations are springing up
all over the country...

1407
01:06:28,508 --> 01:06:31,238
as Americans
show their patriotism.

1408
01:06:31,277 --> 01:06:34,474
You ought to get them to run
that inaugural speech by me.

1409
01:06:34,514 --> 01:06:36,414
lnaugural speech?
l don't know.

1410
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:38,781
The White House staff
won't give up that one.

1411
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:42,845
Come on. Let me close out
the thing in style.

1412
01:06:42,889 --> 01:06:44,982
l've come to feel it's my thing.

1413
01:06:45,024 --> 01:06:48,516
You take a job, and many times,
it's just a job...

1414
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,157
Hell of a ride.

1415
01:06:52,198 --> 01:06:53,756
lsn't it?

1416
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:55,357
You take the bitter
with the sweet...

1417
01:06:55,401 --> 01:06:57,096
or the sweet with the bitter.

1418
01:06:57,136 --> 01:06:58,433
What's that expression?

1419
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:05,108
...feeling good
about the economy.

1420
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,078
That's why we're voting
for the president, Ed.

1421
01:07:07,113 --> 01:07:08,410
What do you think?

1422
01:07:08,447 --> 01:07:12,850
Bob, my mind wasn't
100% made up, but now it is.

1423
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:16,548
Don't go changing horses
in midstream.

1424
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:19,819
Absolutely.

1425
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:22,760
Who needs surprises these days?

1426
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:24,285
For an economy
you can rely on...

1427
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:26,093
Fucking amateurs.

1428
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:31,294
Pity of it is, two more days,
and we bring it back home.

1429
01:07:31,337 --> 01:07:32,429
Knock wood.

1430
01:07:33,206 --> 01:07:34,696
Who's gonna know?

1431
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,532
Who's gonna know what we did?

1432
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:40,369
Pride of a job well done, Stan.

1433
01:07:40,413 --> 01:07:43,644
lt's the pride of a job
well done, but it's more.

1434
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:48,310
lt's the gratitude of your party
and your president, right?

1435
01:07:49,155 --> 01:07:51,646
-ls that the thing?
-lndeed it is.

1436
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,054
Dean City, Oklahoma.
Army special programs.

1437
01:07:57,096 --> 01:07:58,791
Tell 'em to bring
Schumann to the plane.

1438
01:07:58,831 --> 01:08:01,265
We'll bring him back
and stash him in the hospital.

1439
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,394
Call the plane.
Tell me where to pick him up.

1440
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:06,462
l bet you're good at chess.

1441
01:08:07,673 --> 01:08:10,198
l would be, l could remember
how all the pieces move.

1442
01:08:10,876 --> 01:08:12,275
We'll call you.

1443
01:08:13,379 --> 01:08:18,316
l'll do the same
in His great name...

1444
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:21,320
if you have courage, Mom.

1445
01:08:22,488 --> 01:08:26,618
l can always feel your love.

1446
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,656
Send, and l'll receive.

1447
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:35,266
Units of 303,
the Defense Department...

1448
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:37,326
confirmed early this morning,
Albanian time...

1449
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:41,204
stormed the mountain hideaway
near the city of...

1450
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,141
freeing a tired but happy
William Schumann.

1451
01:08:44,176 --> 01:08:46,406
A high White House source
confirms...

1452
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:49,141
that he's expected
in Washington tomorrow morning.

1453
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:50,443
How's that?

1454
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:59,155
When we touch down tomorrow...

1455
01:08:59,191 --> 01:09:00,818
Big Bird meets Schumann
at the airport?

1456
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,658
Big mistake. You got to bring
him in by stages.

1457
01:09:03,696 --> 01:09:06,597
Big mistake to reveal
Schumann before the election.

1458
01:09:06,632 --> 01:09:07,894
How so?

1459
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:10,527
Sweetheart,
Schumann is the shark.

1460
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:12,537
Schumann is Jaws.

1461
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:14,971
You have to tease 'em.

1462
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:18,340
You don't put Jaws
in the first reel of the movie.

1463
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:20,345
lt's the contract, sweetheart.

1464
01:09:20,379 --> 01:09:23,177
The contract with the election,
whether they know it or not...

1465
01:09:23,215 --> 01:09:25,183
is vote for me Tuesday...

1466
01:09:25,217 --> 01:09:27,481
Wednesday,
l will produce Schumann.

1467
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,647
That's what they're paying
their seven bucks for.

1468
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:31,247
Know what l mean?

1469
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:33,053
Whatever.

1470
01:09:33,092 --> 01:09:34,559
Everybody's gotta learn.

1471
01:09:34,593 --> 01:09:36,117
Any business.

1472
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:39,392
You take the fruit
of 40 years...

1473
01:09:39,432 --> 01:09:41,696
hard lessons, mistakes,
and you call it wisdom.

1474
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:42,962
That's the truth.

1475
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:45,436
End of the day,
just when you know something...

1476
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:47,029
time to go home.

1477
01:09:47,073 --> 01:09:49,337
You got decades in you now.

1478
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:51,502
You got decades left in you.

1479
01:09:51,544 --> 01:09:52,704
Yeah, but...

1480
01:09:54,814 --> 01:09:56,145
What could l do to top this?

1481
01:09:57,883 --> 01:10:01,751
The 37th Psalm.

1482
01:10:01,787 --> 01:10:06,486
l'll do the same
in His great name...

1483
01:10:06,525 --> 01:10:09,323
if you have courage, Mom.

1484
01:10:09,362 --> 01:10:12,195
You see her?
That was real tears.

1485
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:14,461
We were gonna give her
those drops.

1486
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,627
-She cried.
-Really?

1487
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:19,103
-She cried real.
-lt looks it.

1488
01:10:19,138 --> 01:10:21,606
Pray for me...

1489
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,972
and the USA.

1490
01:10:24,009 --> 01:10:27,410
Pray they never use the bomb.

1491
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:31,342
What are you going
to do after this?

1492
01:10:31,384 --> 01:10:33,011
They owe you big.

1493
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:35,486
Ambassador to this or that,
whatever.

1494
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:36,988
Ambassador to what?

1495
01:10:37,022 --> 01:10:38,853
l don't even like to go
to Brentwood.

1496
01:10:41,427 --> 01:10:43,452
That's what l want.

1497
01:10:43,496 --> 01:10:44,963
That's my reward.

1498
01:10:44,997 --> 01:10:46,225
That's the payoff.

1499
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:48,563
You want to go to the lnaugural?

1500
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:51,297
Might if l was asked.

1501
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:15,821
This here, Schumann and us...

1502
01:11:15,861 --> 01:11:18,295
Look at that.
King Kong and the trainers.

1503
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,264
This is it.

1504
01:11:22,535 --> 01:11:25,368
l'm standing with this picture
of Sergeant Willie Schumann.

1505
01:11:25,404 --> 01:11:29,204
He's become known to Americans
simply as the Old Shoe...

1506
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:31,334
This is gonna be a masterpiece.

1507
01:11:31,377 --> 01:11:33,174
Giving them what they want.

1508
01:11:33,212 --> 01:11:36,807
...his Group 303 and left behind
in enemy territory.

1509
01:11:36,849 --> 01:11:39,317
Here at
Andrews Air Force Base...

1510
01:11:39,351 --> 01:11:41,182
they prepare for the return
of Willie Schumann.

1511
01:11:48,327 --> 01:11:51,694
Sergeant Schumann, if l may,
welcome to history.

1512
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:53,527
Sergeant Schumann, l'm Ames.

1513
01:11:53,566 --> 01:11:55,227
Somebody named Brean?

1514
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:56,734
Right here.

1515
01:11:56,769 --> 01:11:58,464
Sign here for me.

1516
01:12:00,139 --> 01:12:02,471
Captain,
you want to take her up?

1517
01:12:02,508 --> 01:12:03,907
There's heavy weather back east.

1518
01:12:03,943 --> 01:12:05,240
What do you think?

1519
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:07,802
6 to 5 and pick 'em.
You want to chance it?

1520
01:12:07,847 --> 01:12:09,974
lf it'll fly, let's fly.
People are waiting.

1521
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:18,053
A child at the airport
breaks through the ranks...

1522
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:21,890
runs to Old Shoe,
rubs meat on Schumann's cuff.

1523
01:12:21,927 --> 01:12:24,487
A little dog runs to it.
The dog loves Schumann.

1524
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,896
He is a perfect war hero.

1525
01:12:26,932 --> 01:12:28,331
Perfect.

1526
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:30,232
You cast him.

1527
01:12:30,269 --> 01:12:31,930
All right. Book it up.

1528
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,539
What's this?

1529
01:12:36,575 --> 01:12:38,270
Keys to the manacles.

1530
01:12:41,514 --> 01:12:43,345
Oh, my God.

1531
01:12:43,382 --> 01:12:45,282
Wait.

1532
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:55,620
What is the trouble?

1533
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:58,152
No trouble at all, ma'am.

1534
01:12:58,197 --> 01:13:00,062
Then why is he in chains?

1535
01:13:01,066 --> 01:13:03,091
He's in chains
because he's a convict.

1536
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:05,598
A convict?

1537
01:13:10,142 --> 01:13:11,234
How you doing?

1538
01:13:25,157 --> 01:13:26,351
Take a look.

1539
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:34,428
When we asked
for special programs...

1540
01:13:34,466 --> 01:13:36,161
they gave us special prisons.

1541
01:13:36,201 --> 01:13:38,294
Only a one-word difference.

1542
01:13:38,337 --> 01:13:41,067
-Has he been in jail long?
-12 years.

1543
01:13:41,106 --> 01:13:42,505
Does he have much longer
to serve?

1544
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:45,804
What did he do?

1545
01:13:45,844 --> 01:13:47,607
He raped a nun.

1546
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:51,982
-And...
-l don't want to know an "and."

1547
01:13:52,017 --> 01:13:52,984
Why is there an "and"?

1548
01:13:54,019 --> 01:13:57,182
He's fine as long
as he gets his medications.

1549
01:13:57,222 --> 01:13:59,156
And if he doesn't?

1550
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:00,488
He's not fine.

1551
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:05,162
Up there, Captain.

1552
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:08,862
You'd better get us
to Washington.

1553
01:14:14,373 --> 01:14:15,635
How are ya?

1554
01:14:17,509 --> 01:14:18,999
Fine.

1555
01:14:29,121 --> 01:14:30,645
Gonna get me back tomorrow?

1556
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:34,250
'Cause, you know, tomorrow
they're having beans.

1557
01:14:34,293 --> 01:14:36,818
l need a readjustment.
We have to rethink this.

1558
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:38,261
Beans!

1559
01:14:38,297 --> 01:14:40,231
We're trying to do this thing.

1560
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:43,701
As long as you
get me back for the beans.

1561
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:45,761
He's sicker than we thought.

1562
01:14:45,804 --> 01:14:49,433
Rush him under wraps
to Walter Reed for tests.

1563
01:14:49,475 --> 01:14:52,672
lf you're gonna keep me out,
l'd like to go to church.

1564
01:14:52,711 --> 01:14:54,110
You know what l mean?

1565
01:14:55,648 --> 01:14:57,479
Are you very religious?

1566
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,649
What have you done to me?

1567
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:09,184
All combat takes place
at night in the rain...

1568
01:15:09,228 --> 01:15:10,752
at the junction
of four map segments.

1569
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:12,195
What are you going to do?

1570
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:14,199
He's fine as long
as he gets his medication.

1571
01:15:14,233 --> 01:15:18,192
Speaking of that,
we're gonna need lots of this.

1572
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:20,068
Get on the phone and get it.

1573
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:22,733
You people are looking
at this wrong.

1574
01:15:22,775 --> 01:15:24,743
lf you look at the back story...

1575
01:15:24,777 --> 01:15:26,870
the guy is coming back
from combat and torture...

1576
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:28,846
of course he's going to be
a little fucked up.

1577
01:15:30,115 --> 01:15:31,548
He's gonna need help.

1578
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:35,178
Anybody want a beer?
'Cause l could party.

1579
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,085
l'm gonna need an ambulance.

1580
01:15:37,122 --> 01:15:38,885
We take him the last moment
from the plane.

1581
01:15:38,924 --> 01:15:42,792
We land, take him
from the plane to the ambulance.

1582
01:15:42,828 --> 01:15:45,922
Air Force jet lands, we take
somebody else from that jet.

1583
01:15:45,964 --> 01:15:48,159
What the fuck do l care?

1584
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,758
Somebody in a hospital gown.

1585
01:15:49,802 --> 01:15:51,463
You get me back for the beans.

1586
01:15:51,503 --> 01:15:52,970
'Cause tomorrow's the beans.

1587
01:15:53,005 --> 01:15:54,597
'Cause this dog
ain't gonna hunt.

1588
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,040
He's gonna be fine.

1589
01:15:57,076 --> 01:15:58,338
Aren't you, William?

1590
01:15:58,377 --> 01:16:00,902
Speaking of which,
l have a prescription here.

1591
01:16:00,946 --> 01:16:03,278
l want you standing by
with a lot of this stuff.

1592
01:16:03,315 --> 01:16:05,180
A crate of it. lt's...

1593
01:16:07,419 --> 01:16:08,750
Anti-psychotic.

1594
01:16:09,621 --> 01:16:11,213
The number is V--

1595
01:16:13,292 --> 01:16:14,554
This is nothing.

1596
01:16:14,593 --> 01:16:16,584
l used to think
l was a pharmacist...

1597
01:16:16,628 --> 01:16:17,959
the stuff l carried.

1598
01:16:17,996 --> 01:16:21,557
With the beans, you can tell
if they're puttin' stuff in it.

1599
01:16:23,135 --> 01:16:25,467
So you don't have to fear it.

1600
01:16:26,772 --> 01:16:28,171
What kind of stuff?

1601
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:33,239
What do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1602
01:16:36,148 --> 01:16:38,673
He just wanted to know
what you meant.

1603
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:40,184
Did you mean?

1604
01:16:40,219 --> 01:16:42,346
-l didn't.
-He didn't mean.

1605
01:16:42,387 --> 01:16:44,821
-He didn't mean anything.
-You meant something.

1606
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:46,085
He didn't mean anything.

1607
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:47,717
Give him another pill.

1608
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,594
What the fuck do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1609
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,791
Pill, William.

1610
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:57,100
This is nothing.
Did you ever shoot in ltaly?

1611
01:16:57,136 --> 01:17:00,469
Try three starlets swacked-out
on Benzedrine and grappa.

1612
01:17:00,506 --> 01:17:02,440
This is nothing.

1613
01:17:02,474 --> 01:17:04,567
This is a walk in the park.

1614
01:17:07,146 --> 01:17:08,477
Who are you?

1615
01:17:08,514 --> 01:17:10,243
Who are you sons of bitches?

1616
01:17:10,282 --> 01:17:12,842
-Killers!
-Just calm down.

1617
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:14,682
Where are you taking me?

1618
01:17:18,757 --> 01:17:20,088
Oh, my God!

1619
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:26,254
Sergeant Willie Schumann
is coming home.

1620
01:17:26,298 --> 01:17:28,789
Schumann's plane should be
over the Atlantic Ocean...

1621
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:31,564
making its final descent
back into this country.

1622
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:32,900
The White House reported...

1623
01:17:32,938 --> 01:17:36,135
he was safely rescued
and on his way to American soil.

1624
01:17:36,175 --> 01:17:38,143
We're still waiting
for his plane...

1625
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:39,735
at Andrews Air Force Base.

1626
01:17:39,778 --> 01:17:43,043
A plane that is due to land.
Long overdue.

1627
01:17:43,081 --> 01:17:45,811
The president is monitoring
the situation...

1628
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:47,819
personally and closely.

1629
01:17:47,853 --> 01:17:50,185
We will keep you updated
as to any developments.

1630
01:17:50,222 --> 01:17:51,519
Thank you very much.

1631
01:17:51,557 --> 01:17:54,048
Oh, God.
What do we do now?

1632
01:17:55,294 --> 01:17:57,387
What do we do now, boy producer?

1633
01:17:57,429 --> 01:17:59,954
Mister win-an-Emmy,
social-conscience, whale-shit...

1634
01:17:59,998 --> 01:18:02,432
save-the-rain-forest,
peacenik-commie...

1635
01:18:02,467 --> 01:18:04,697
fuckin'-hire-a-convict shithead?

1636
01:18:04,736 --> 01:18:08,035
What do we do now, liberal,
affirmative action, shithead...

1637
01:18:08,073 --> 01:18:09,734
peacenik commie fuck?

1638
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:14,573
This is nothing.
Piece of cake.

1639
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:17,343
Producing
is being a samurai warrior.

1640
01:18:17,382 --> 01:18:19,077
They pay you day in,
day out for years...

1641
01:18:19,117 --> 01:18:21,779
so that one day,
when called upon...

1642
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,789
you can respond,
your training at its peak...

1643
01:18:24,823 --> 01:18:26,450
and save the day!

1644
01:18:30,262 --> 01:18:31,923
Produce this Schumann.

1645
01:18:31,964 --> 01:18:33,625
Produce him, l say...

1646
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:35,189
or, and l don't hesitate
to say this...

1647
01:18:35,234 --> 01:18:39,694
rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.

1648
01:18:39,738 --> 01:18:43,538
This tardy absence of the flight
must give us pause...

1649
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:48,103
and in that pause, we should
take time to examine ourselves--

1650
01:18:48,146 --> 01:18:49,579
Fuck you.

1651
01:18:49,615 --> 01:18:51,776
Leave it alone.
What did television do to you?

1652
01:18:51,817 --> 01:18:54,445
lt destroyed
the electoral process.

1653
01:18:54,486 --> 01:18:57,580
Enough lovemaking.
Let's go. Come on.

1654
01:18:57,623 --> 01:19:00,751
-Where?
-We got work to do.

1655
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:02,259
Come on, pal.

1656
01:19:02,294 --> 01:19:03,761
ls it time for exercise?

1657
01:19:03,795 --> 01:19:05,786
lt's my day in the yard.

1658
01:19:05,831 --> 01:19:07,560
Let's get him to the highway.

1659
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:09,999
Think this is tough?
Come on, pal!

1660
01:19:10,035 --> 01:19:12,367
This is nothing! Piece of cake!

1661
01:19:12,404 --> 01:19:14,099
Albanian dissidents...

1662
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:17,006
having somehow obtained
a surface-to-air missile...

1663
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:19,510
You had your fortune here.

1664
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:21,478
You were ready to throw it away.

1665
01:19:21,513 --> 01:19:24,778
lf you got a problem, solve it.
That's producing.

1666
01:19:24,816 --> 01:19:28,115
Someday when they
tell this story--

1667
01:19:28,153 --> 01:19:29,620
You can't tell this story.

1668
01:19:29,655 --> 01:19:32,146
-Why not?
-Somebody would have you killed.

1669
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,590
Of course, l know.

1670
01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:38,426
Not now. But when
they do tell the story--

1671
01:19:38,463 --> 01:19:41,591
Nobody can tell this story,
ever.

1672
01:19:43,068 --> 01:19:46,265
Listen to me.
This is what l do for a living.

1673
01:19:47,172 --> 01:19:49,333
You can't tell this story.
He's not kidding you.

1674
01:19:49,374 --> 01:19:51,501
You can't tell this story.
You knew that.

1675
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:53,636
The deal was you get
an ambassadorship.

1676
01:19:54,947 --> 01:19:57,006
l used to have a Camaro.

1677
01:19:57,049 --> 01:19:59,643
What are you going to tell?
The guy's a nut case.

1678
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:01,880
You would be too if you went
through what he went through.

1679
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,387
He raped a nun.

1680
01:20:03,422 --> 01:20:04,650
What he went through in Albania.

1681
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:06,021
He's doped to the gills.

1682
01:20:06,058 --> 01:20:07,423
Where's my little pills?

1683
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:08,687
Show some compassion.

1684
01:20:08,727 --> 01:20:11,025
He spent the last 12 years
in a military prison.

1685
01:20:11,063 --> 01:20:13,224
How are we gonna explain that?

1686
01:20:13,265 --> 01:20:15,631
Explain it? Am l worried?

1687
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:17,567
How do we explain that
when the world is watching?

1688
01:20:17,602 --> 01:20:20,070
Fuck the world.
Try a 10 a.m. pitch meeting...

1689
01:20:20,105 --> 01:20:22,573
coked to the gills, and you
haven't read the treatment.

1690
01:20:22,607 --> 01:20:24,632
How do we explain
he was in prison?

1691
01:20:25,744 --> 01:20:27,109
Well, you see, Winifred...

1692
01:20:27,145 --> 01:20:29,443
this is where
you've never been at a pitch.

1693
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:30,880
His records say he was
in prison...

1694
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:34,079
as they say for all the men
and women of Group 303...

1695
01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:37,850
as they must
because of the secrecy involved.

1696
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,073
l'm on top of it.

1697
01:20:57,109 --> 01:20:59,134
Not sure whether enemy action...

1698
01:20:59,177 --> 01:21:00,644
l'm fine. l got it.

1699
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,876
Stanley, l told you,
l do this for a living.

1700
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,543
You do what for a living?

1701
01:21:06,585 --> 01:21:08,212
Exactly what do you do
for the president?

1702
01:21:08,253 --> 01:21:10,585
l lost my wallet.
You got any change?

1703
01:21:12,724 --> 01:21:14,282
How we doing, boy?

1704
01:21:14,326 --> 01:21:15,850
Ready to mix it up?

1705
01:21:15,894 --> 01:21:17,725
ls today laundry day?

1706
01:21:17,763 --> 01:21:20,732
-What do you do on laundry day?
-Laundry.

1707
01:21:20,766 --> 01:21:23,428
Stand by to copy this.
Just get a pencil.

1708
01:21:23,468 --> 01:21:24,935
Down safely.

1709
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:27,097
Produce this Schumann.

1710
01:21:27,139 --> 01:21:30,472
Produce him, l say, or, and
l don't hesitate to say this...

1711
01:21:30,509 --> 01:21:34,639
rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.

1712
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:36,146
Sustained minor injuries.

1713
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:38,581
Flight crew being investigated
for possible pilot error.

1714
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:40,642
Transshipped
to an undisclosed location.

1715
01:21:42,187 --> 01:21:45,486
This deserted runway should be
filled with well-wishers.

1716
01:21:45,524 --> 01:21:48,823
How you doing?
A cold drink?

1717
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:51,351
Schumann was to return
to American soil today...

1718
01:21:51,396 --> 01:21:53,421
after his safe rescue
in Albania.

1719
01:21:54,266 --> 01:21:56,496
He looks like me.

1720
01:21:57,769 --> 01:22:00,829
...deserves an explanation
from the White House.

1721
01:22:00,872 --> 01:22:05,036
Wait, we are now going
live to the White House.

1722
01:22:05,077 --> 01:22:07,545
l have an update regarding
the aircraft incident...

1723
01:22:07,579 --> 01:22:09,240
involving Sergeant Schumann.

1724
01:22:09,281 --> 01:22:11,977
He is down safely
and will be transshipped.

1725
01:22:12,017 --> 01:22:14,781
We are informed he has sustained
minor injuries...

1726
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,651
which will require his being
medicated for some time...

1727
01:22:16,688 --> 01:22:18,781
Bring in the cavalry.
Nick of time.

1728
01:22:21,226 --> 01:22:22,989
Political shitbirds.
Fuck with us, huh?

1729
01:22:23,028 --> 01:22:24,620
They don't know
who they're playing with.

1730
01:22:29,734 --> 01:22:31,065
Purty.

1731
01:22:32,838 --> 01:22:34,738
l'm a little concerned
about the driver of the rig.

1732
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:36,263
-What rig?
-The harvester.

1733
01:22:36,308 --> 01:22:39,334
-What about him?
-He doesn't have his green card.

1734
01:22:44,249 --> 01:22:45,807
So what?

1735
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:49,446
You want Schumann to be
rescued by an illegal alien?

1736
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:52,548
We can't have Schumann saved
by an illegal immigrant.

1737
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:54,559
Get on the phone.
Fly in a judge.

1738
01:22:54,593 --> 01:22:57,084
Get on the phone.
What's all this moping about?

1739
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:04,962
Do you have any change?

1740
01:23:06,972 --> 01:23:10,339
l like the night life,
l like to boogie.

1741
01:23:12,544 --> 01:23:13,670
Susie!

1742
01:23:13,712 --> 01:23:15,043
William?

1743
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,911
Are you all right?

1744
01:23:20,952 --> 01:23:22,317
Kickball.

1745
01:23:28,994 --> 01:23:30,985
Let me talk to him !

1746
01:23:31,029 --> 01:23:32,496
What are you doing?

1747
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:33,896
l think we should--

1748
01:23:33,932 --> 01:23:37,265
Willie, where are you going?

1749
01:23:38,537 --> 01:23:40,004
Shoester!

1750
01:23:44,809 --> 01:23:48,301
Let me talk to him.
Shoe, you in there?

1751
01:23:48,346 --> 01:23:50,610
l'll kill that son of a bitch.

1752
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:53,618
l have a relationship.
You want to talk?

1753
01:23:53,652 --> 01:23:56,177
Get you anything you want.
You want some beans?

1754
01:23:56,221 --> 01:23:57,518
Will that do it, Shoester?

1755
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:01,256
Come on, Shoe!

1756
01:24:03,428 --> 01:24:05,521
He's dead.

1757
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:15,233
Wait a minute.

1758
01:24:15,273 --> 01:24:17,468
He's not dead. He's alive.

1759
01:24:18,777 --> 01:24:20,142
Strike that.

1760
01:24:26,818 --> 01:24:28,843
So close and yet so far.

1761
01:24:28,887 --> 01:24:30,184
What do you mean?

1762
01:24:30,222 --> 01:24:31,621
We were this close.

1763
01:24:31,656 --> 01:24:33,920
This is nothing.

1764
01:24:33,959 --> 01:24:35,187
This just got big.

1765
01:24:35,227 --> 01:24:37,218
Big? He's dead.

1766
01:24:37,262 --> 01:24:38,627
We killed Old Shoe.

1767
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:42,932
What is better
than the triumphal homecoming...

1768
01:24:42,968 --> 01:24:44,663
of a war hero?

1769
01:24:51,109 --> 01:24:52,235
Ready!

1770
01:24:53,011 --> 01:24:54,137
Lift!

1771
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:56,306
We're gathered here...

1772
01:24:56,948 --> 01:24:59,917
with a cross to bear.

1773
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:02,112
The bravest men...

1774
01:25:03,255 --> 01:25:05,485
anywhere.

1775
01:25:05,924 --> 01:25:08,415
That this great land...

1776
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:12,089
will remain free.

1777
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,791
God bless the men...

1778
01:25:13,832 --> 01:25:17,700
of the 303.

1779
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:20,898
Side by side...

1780
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:23,908
we know no fear.

1781
01:25:23,942 --> 01:25:26,911
Our minds are sharp.

1782
01:25:26,945 --> 01:25:29,880
Our eyes are clear.

1783
01:25:29,914 --> 01:25:32,940
ln the air, on land...

1784
01:25:32,984 --> 01:25:35,817
or on the sea...

1785
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:38,084
we're the fightin' men...

1786
01:25:38,123 --> 01:25:41,718
of the 303.

1787
01:25:44,963 --> 01:25:47,796
Give us this day...

1788
01:25:47,832 --> 01:25:50,892
our daily bread...

1789
01:25:50,935 --> 01:25:53,233
and leopard skin...

1790
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,867
for our head.

1791
01:25:56,908 --> 01:25:59,001
That we may fight...

1792
01:26:07,185 --> 01:26:08,413
Coffee?

1793
01:26:08,453 --> 01:26:09,852
Please.

1794
01:26:09,888 --> 01:26:11,981
Looking good.

1795
01:26:12,023 --> 01:26:14,218
Bring it all back home.

1796
01:26:14,259 --> 01:26:16,921
Lassie barks twice, and it's
time to take out the garbage.

1797
01:26:16,961 --> 01:26:18,519
Hell of a show.

1798
01:26:18,563 --> 01:26:19,962
Hell of a job.

1799
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:21,659
lt's just producing.

1800
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,692
There's no Academy Award
for producing.

1801
01:26:24,736 --> 01:26:26,067
You're kidding.

1802
01:26:27,339 --> 01:26:29,671
Where do movies come from
if nobody produces them?

1803
01:26:30,975 --> 01:26:32,704
They come from people like you.

1804
01:26:36,281 --> 01:26:38,078
You just got to take
the bitter with the better.

1805
01:26:38,116 --> 01:26:40,607
Job's almost done--

1806
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:41,812
knock on wood.

1807
01:26:42,787 --> 01:26:44,084
We did a good job.

1808
01:26:44,122 --> 01:26:45,419
That's our reward.

1809
01:26:46,991 --> 01:26:48,686
You can't save the world.

1810
01:26:48,727 --> 01:26:50,058
All you can do is try.

1811
01:26:50,662 --> 01:26:52,493
Ain't that the truth?

1812
01:26:58,069 --> 01:26:59,798
As we said, the president--

1813
01:26:59,838 --> 01:27:02,500
thrust of the Albanian episode
to put him over the top.

1814
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,634
You could say that, Shirley,
but it's not true.

1815
01:27:05,677 --> 01:27:07,042
What would be true, then?

1816
01:27:07,078 --> 01:27:09,239
You said it earlier,
if l may rephrase...

1817
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,441
the success
of the president in the polls--

1818
01:27:11,483 --> 01:27:15,783
As of today, 89% favorable.

1819
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,380
Based not on the events...

1820
01:27:18,423 --> 01:27:20,983
but on the spin
given to those events.

1821
01:27:21,025 --> 01:27:24,461
What's the lesson here?
Never give up.

1822
01:27:24,496 --> 01:27:25,724
You're right.

1823
01:27:25,764 --> 01:27:27,197
The show must go on.

1824
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,460
Proud tradition.

1825
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,834
l am prouder of this
than anything l ever did.

1826
01:27:32,871 --> 01:27:34,099
You should be.

1827
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:35,606
l want to thank you.

1828
01:27:39,344 --> 01:27:40,709
You gave me a good opportunity.

1829
01:27:44,616 --> 01:27:47,779
As we said, the president,
a surefire winner...

1830
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:50,720
and the campaign, many said,
that put him there.

1831
01:27:51,389 --> 01:27:53,414
Another great race today,
Johnny.

1832
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:55,756
Who you going to ride
in the Stakes?

1833
01:27:55,794 --> 01:27:58,558
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

1834
01:27:58,596 --> 01:27:59,790
The message is irrelevant.

1835
01:27:59,831 --> 01:28:01,822
The main element
we have to deal with...

1836
01:28:01,866 --> 01:28:04,391
is that fear is
what's driving a lot of people.

1837
01:28:04,436 --> 01:28:06,233
Commercials.

1838
01:28:07,672 --> 01:28:08,900
The president is a product.

1839
01:28:10,742 --> 01:28:13,643
He's the President
of the United States at 89%.

1840
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:15,373
Which we're dealing with today.

1841
01:28:15,413 --> 01:28:16,880
Commercials.

1842
01:28:18,249 --> 01:28:21,047
lt's time the American people
began to look at that.

1843
01:28:21,085 --> 01:28:24,054
Now we're going
to take your calls.

1844
01:28:24,088 --> 01:28:25,612
The number is 1-800...

1845
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:27,852
Oh, shit.

1846
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:38,864
Stanley, what are you doing?

1847
01:28:38,903 --> 01:28:40,200
What am l doing?

1848
01:28:41,606 --> 01:28:43,267
l'm going to call somebody.

1849
01:28:44,609 --> 01:28:45,906
That's very funny.

1850
01:28:45,944 --> 01:28:47,605
l'm going to get
these people straight.

1851
01:28:47,645 --> 01:28:49,169
You can't do that.

1852
01:28:49,214 --> 01:28:50,511
Watch me.

1853
01:28:55,253 --> 01:28:56,811
You knew the deal
when you signed on.

1854
01:28:56,855 --> 01:28:58,880
Come on. Deals change.

1855
01:28:58,923 --> 01:29:00,686
Sure it is.

1856
01:29:00,725 --> 01:29:03,751
Let's rethink
that ambassadorship.

1857
01:29:03,795 --> 01:29:05,786
l'm talking London.
l'm talking Paris.

1858
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:08,128
A secret account
for your extra expenses...

1859
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,599
getting laid whenever you want.

1860
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:11,067
Marine guards will salute you.

1861
01:29:11,102 --> 01:29:13,969
lt's tempting, but l got
to answer to a higher calling.

1862
01:29:14,005 --> 01:29:15,973
-Art.
-Money?

1863
01:29:16,007 --> 01:29:18,100
You think l did this for money?

1864
01:29:18,142 --> 01:29:20,838
l did this for credit.

1865
01:29:20,879 --> 01:29:22,312
You knew
you couldn't take the credit.

1866
01:29:22,347 --> 01:29:23,814
l'm not going to stand here...

1867
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:26,282
and let two dickheads
from film school take it.

1868
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:28,182
Listen to me.

1869
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:29,447
Are you nuts?

1870
01:29:29,487 --> 01:29:30,784
Stanley, no fooling.

1871
01:29:30,822 --> 01:29:32,483
You're playing with your life.

1872
01:29:32,524 --> 01:29:33,855
Fuck my life.

1873
01:29:33,892 --> 01:29:35,860
l want the credit.

1874
01:29:35,894 --> 01:29:38,419
Know what the New York Times
said about my last picture?

1875
01:29:38,463 --> 01:29:40,226
They called it
"a thrill ride for the ages..."

1876
01:29:40,265 --> 01:29:41,755
but they didn't mention
the producer.

1877
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:43,960
They talked
about the costumes...

1878
01:29:44,002 --> 01:29:45,526
but never talked
about the producer.

1879
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:46,798
You know what
that picture grossed?

1880
01:29:46,838 --> 01:29:48,066
Now l'm going to stand here...

1881
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:50,267
and let some limp-dick
film-school pansy...

1882
01:29:50,308 --> 01:29:51,536
take the credit?

1883
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:53,043
You can't do it.

1884
01:29:53,077 --> 01:29:55,045
Don't you tell me that!

1885
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:57,479
Don't you ever tell me that!

1886
01:29:57,515 --> 01:29:59,278
l am the producer!

1887
01:29:59,317 --> 01:30:01,376
lf l didn't step up,
you're nowhere!

1888
01:30:01,419 --> 01:30:03,979
l put this together
out of spit and polish!

1889
01:30:04,022 --> 01:30:05,956
Look at that.

1890
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:08,515
That is a complete
fucking fraud...

1891
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,927
and it looks 100% real.

1892
01:30:17,902 --> 01:30:20,962
lt's the best work
l've ever done in my life...

1893
01:30:21,005 --> 01:30:23,200
because it's so honest.

1894
01:30:31,215 --> 01:30:33,183
They told me l couldn't
remake Moby Dick...

1895
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:34,809
from the point of view
of the whale.

1896
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:36,683
$450 million domestic.

1897
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:38,188
l'm not even talking
about the video.

1898
01:30:38,222 --> 01:30:40,349
l made this lame turkey fly.

1899
01:30:40,391 --> 01:30:41,983
l did it--pure Hollywood.

1900
01:30:43,661 --> 01:30:47,119
For once in my life,
l won't be pissed on.

1901
01:30:47,165 --> 01:30:48,359
Do you hear me?

1902
01:30:49,534 --> 01:30:51,195
l want the credit.

1903
01:30:53,104 --> 01:30:55,038
l'm taking it.

1904
01:30:55,073 --> 01:30:56,768
Shit.

1905
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:13,214
He's coming down.

1906
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:15,623
Could l see you a minute?
Thanks.

1907
01:31:19,597 --> 01:31:20,723
Do you swear to uphold...

1908
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:22,232
the duties
and responsibilities...

1909
01:31:22,266 --> 01:31:24,996
of a citizen of
the United States of America--

1910
01:31:25,036 --> 01:31:27,004
to defend her
in time of peril...

1911
01:31:27,038 --> 01:31:30,496
to defend her from all enemies,
foreign and domestic?

1912
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:33,203
Do you make this pledge
with full resolve?

1913
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:53,429
Common ground...

1914
01:31:53,464 --> 01:31:56,729
and family.

1915
01:31:56,768 --> 01:31:58,235
Let's give thanks...

1916
01:31:58,269 --> 01:32:02,672
to the 303.

1917
01:32:02,707 --> 01:32:05,369
Years from now...

1918
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:08,379
when we are gone...

1919
01:32:08,413 --> 01:32:11,382
our children's kids...

1920
01:32:11,416 --> 01:32:14,783
will hear this song.

1921
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:17,447
Think how strong...

1922
01:32:17,488 --> 01:32:20,821
and proud they'll be.

1923
01:32:20,858 --> 01:32:22,223
Grandpa fought...

1924
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:26,492
for the 303.

1925
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:29,022
God bless the men...

1926
01:32:29,067 --> 01:32:37,099
of the 303.

1927
01:32:38,376 --> 01:32:39,866
Ten-hut!

1928
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:42,311
Present arms!

1929
01:32:51,255 --> 01:32:54,019
Turning to the Hollywood page...

1930
01:32:54,058 --> 01:32:56,959
famed film producer
Stanley R. Motss...

1931
01:32:56,994 --> 01:32:59,394
died suddenly
of a massive heart attack...

1932
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:01,557
while sunbathing poolside.

1933
01:33:01,599 --> 01:33:05,262
Mr. Motss
was 57 or 62-years-old...

1934
01:33:05,303 --> 01:33:07,328
depending on the bio.

1935
01:33:07,371 --> 01:33:09,566
His credits
include numerous films...

1936
01:33:09,607 --> 01:33:14,306
which America has come
to love as old classics.

1937
01:33:18,483 --> 01:33:19,711
This just in.

1938
01:33:19,751 --> 01:33:22,151
A group calling itself
"Albania Unite..."

1939
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:24,711
has claimed responsibility
for the bombing moments ago...

1940
01:33:24,756 --> 01:33:26,587
of the village of Klos, Albania.

1941
01:33:26,624 --> 01:33:28,353
The president
was unavailable for comment...

1942
01:33:28,392 --> 01:33:31,122
but General William Scott
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

1943
01:33:31,162 --> 01:33:33,596
says he has no doubt we'll
be sending planes and troops...

1944
01:33:33,631 --> 01:33:35,155
back in to finish the job.
