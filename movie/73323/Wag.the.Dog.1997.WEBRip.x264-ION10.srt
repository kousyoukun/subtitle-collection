00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,222
TELL THEM WHAT
THEY NEED TO KNOW.

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
WHEN IT BROKE,

38
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,392
THE PRESIDENT SAID
ONE THING.

39
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,593
"GET ME CONRAD BREAN."

40
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,597
ANYWAY, WHAT'S THE THING?

41
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,333
HE HAD AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT
NANNY SOME YEARS BACK?

42
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,434
DIDN'T DECLARE HER?

43

00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,504
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU GET A LITTLE NERVOUS.

45
00:03:56,504 --> 00:04:00,073
HE MADE A PASS AT SOME
SECRETARY SOME YEARS AGO?

46
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,309
THERE WAS A GROUP
OF FIREFLY GIRLS

47
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,643
FROM SANTA FE HERE
LAST MONTH.

48
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,044
ONE OF THE GIRLS
EXPRESSED AN INTEREST

00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,245
IN A FREDERIC
REMINGTON BUST.

50
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,514
THE PRESIDENT
TOOK HER INTO--

51
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,181
YOU KNOW THE OFFICE
BEHIND THE OVAL OFFICE?

52
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,317
FOR A PERIOD OF--

53
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:10,651
IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN OVER 3 MINUTES.

54
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,720
THE SECRET SERVICE
WILL BACK ME UP ON THAT.

55
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,523
SO IT'S NOT THE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANT NANNY THING?

56
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,525

CERTAIN THAT--

60
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,199
MAYBE WE COULD SAY

61
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,868
IT WAS A FUNNY DRUG
REACTION TO THE FLU.

62
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,337
WHO'S GOT THE STORY?

63
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,571
DON'T YOU WANT
TO KNOW IF IT'S TRUE?

64
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,039
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
IF IT'S TRUE?

65
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,140
IT'S A STORY
AND IT BREAKS,

66
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,408
THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO RUN WITH IT.

67
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,009
HOW LONG WE GOT

79
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,296

00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,337
AT LEAST A DAY.

85
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,038
HE'S SICK.

00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,173
GET 'EM ON THE PHONE

87
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,475
AND TELL THE JACKALS
HOW SICK HE IS.

WE GOTTA GET THAT OUT
BEFORE THE STORY BREAKS

89
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,077

A DAY, CONNIE.

YES, IT WILL. YOU KNOW WHY?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,120
WHY IS THE PRESIDENT
IN CHINA?

WITH THE B-3 BOMBER.

THERE IS NO B-3 BOMBER,

THESE RUMORS GET STARTED.

IT WON'T PROVE OUT.

166
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,248
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO PROVE OUT.

00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,301
$20,000.

177
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,804
I GOTTA GO TO L.A. AND SEE
A HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER.

178
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,540
YOU'LL MEET ME AT NATIONAL
IN AN HOUR.

179
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,675
WE'LL GO TO CHICAGO
AND CONNECT THERE TO L.A.

180
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,476
SEE YOU AT NATIONAL.

181
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,453
TELL ME THIS AGAIN.

182
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,988
WE LANDING?

183
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,057
TELL ME AGAIN.

184
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,960
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S NOTHING NEW.

185
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,430
DURING REAGAN'S ADMINISTRATION,
240 MARINES KILLED IN BEIRUT.

186
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,432
24 HOURS LATER
WE INVADE GRENADA.

187
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,534
THAT WAS THEIR M.O.

188
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,835
CHANGE THE STORY,
CHANGE THE LEAD.

189
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,303
IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT.

190
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,539
WAKE ME WHEN WE TOUCH DOWN.
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT IT.

191
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,540
WAIT, WAIT.

192
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,775
WE CAN'T AFFORD A WAR.

193
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,777
WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE A WAR.

194
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,444
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THE APPEARANCE OF A WAR.

195
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,180
WE CANNOT AFFORD
THE APPEARANCE OF A WAR.

196
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,314
WHAT'LL IT COST?

197
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,149
BUT THEY WOULD FIND OUT.

198
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,150
WHO'S GONNA FIND OUT?

199
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,151
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

200
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,152
EXACTLY.

201
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,187
WHO'S GONNA TELL 'EM?

202
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,523
WHAT DID THEY FIND OUT
ABOUT THE GULF WAR?

203
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,458
ONE VIDEO OF ONE BOMB
FALLS DOWN A CHIMNEY,

204
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,760
BLOWS UP THE BUILDING.

205
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,828
THE BUILDING COULD HAVE BEEN
MADE OUT OF LEGOS.

206
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,597
YOU REALLY WANT US
TO GO TO WAR?

207
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,098
THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA.

208
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,400
WITH WHO?

209
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,069
I'M WORKING ON IT.

210
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,239
ALBANIA?

211
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,473
YEAH.

212
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,542
WHY?

213
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,577
WHY NOT?

214
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,178
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT 'EM?

215
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,179
NOTHING.

216
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,414
PRECISELY.

217
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,682
THEY SEEM SHIFTY.

218
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,217
THEY SEEM
STANDOFFISH.

219
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,218
WHO KNOWS
FROM ALBANIA?

220
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,385
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALBANIANS?

221
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,587
WHO TRUSTS
ALBANIANS?

222
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,922
YEAH, BUT WHAT DID ALBANIA
EVER DO TO US?

223
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,289
WHAT DID THEY
EVER DO FOR US?

224
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,559
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO
MOBILIZE THE B-3 BOMBER.

225
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,361
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO TO WAR WITH ALBANIA?

226
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,663
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

227
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,564
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.

228
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,900
GET YOUR PRESS OFFICE
RIGHT NOW TO DENY IT.

229
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,235
OK, IT DIDN'T
HAPPEN.

230
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,338
DENY. "THERE IS NO REPORT
OF ALBANIAN ACTIVITY."

231
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,706
THEY HAVE TO DENY IT.

232
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,574
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

233
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,876
DENY, DENY, DENY.

234
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:36,944
T.V. Anchor: EXPECTING
NEWS FROM THE PRESIDENT

235
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,578
ON TRADE
AND HIS VISIT TO CHINA.

236
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,213
ANOTHER SORT OF NEWS,
HOWEVER,

237
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,049
HAS EMERGED FROM
THE PRESIDENTIAL QUARTER.

238
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,285
WE TURN TO MELISSA GARDNER
AT KZAB IN SANTA FE

239
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,486
WITH THIS BREAKING NEWS.

240
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,990
Gardner: THANKS, RICHARD.
TODAY A LOCAL FIREFLY GIRL

241
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,860
ACCUSED THE PRESIDENT
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

242
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,095
THIS PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT
WITH THE GIRLS

243
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,165
WAS TAKEN DURING THEIR RECENT
TOUR OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

244
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,201
THE GIRL CLAIMS THAT THE SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT OCCURRED

245
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,903
INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE.

246
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,472
HER ATTORNEY SAYS
THERE ARE NO PLANS YET

247
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,539
TO HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE.

248
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,508
RIGHT NOW FOLKS IN SANTA FE

249
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,810
AND THE REST OF AMERICA

250
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,478
ARE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

251
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,646
ON THESE HARSH ALLEGATIONS.

252
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:15,883
WITH THE ELECTION
ONLY DAYS AWAY,

253
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,184
THE BIG QUESTION IS

254
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,620
HOW MUCH WILL THIS SCANDAL
AFFECT THE OUTCOME?

255
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,855
TOP PEOPLE,
ALBANIAN DESK.

256
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,490
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T KNOW EITHER,

257
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,758
BUT WE PROBABLY HAVE ONE.

258
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,727
LISTEN, I WANT YOU
TO ROUST THEM OUT OF BED.

259
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:27,928
ALBANIAN DESK, CIA, NSA,

260
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,296
ROUST THEM OUT OF BED,
SIRENS BLARING.

261
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,431
HONEY, I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
BE UP IN AN HOUR.

262
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,701
I WANT THEM UP NOW.
LISTEN, YOU TELL YOUR STAFF...

263
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,802
GENERAL SCOTT IN SEATTLE?

264
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,770
WELL, NO,
I DON'T THINK HIS TRIP

265
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,538
HAS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE B-3 BOMBER.

266
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,539
WELL, BECAUSE--

267
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,708
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

268
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,209
I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO TURN THAT OFF.

269
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,777
YEAH, IT'LL JUST BE A SECOND.
BECAUSE I'VE SAID FLAT OUT--

270
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,778
THERE ARE NO
ELECTRONICS

271
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:45,913
ON THE PLANE.

272
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,314
I HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO TURN THAT OFF.

273
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,316
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
IT'LL JUST TAKE 2 SECONDS.

274
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,385
WE'VE SAID FLAT OUT
THERE IS NO B-3 BOMBER.

275
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,054
I UNDERSTAND,
I UNDERSTAND.

276
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,657
IF IT IS TRUE, HE SHOULD,
HE MUST STEP DOWN,

277
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,028
AND IF IT'S NOT TRUE,
THEN HE MUST--

278
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,131
WE ARE INFORMED HE HAS EXTENDED
HIS VISIT TO CHINA,

279
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,834
AND I SAY ON BEHALF
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

280
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,403
COME HOME. FACE THE MUSIC,
WHATEVER THAT MAY BE.

281
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,739
THE ELECTION'S IN 11 DAYS.

282
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,007
LET THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE DECIDE.

283
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,608
Reporter: "LET THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE DECIDE."

284
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,478
SENATOR NEAL,
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

285
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,947
WITH--EXCUSE ME, SENATOR,

286
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,949
THAT'S 11 DAYS
TILL THE ELECTION

287
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,617
AND THE PRESIDENT
AHEAD IN THE POLLS BY--BOB?

288
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,986
17%

289
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,055
ACCUSATIONS
HAVE SURFACED

290
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,090
WHICH COULD AFFECT
THE OUTCOME...

291
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,591
Bob: THE WHITE HOUSE
HAS ANNOUNCED

292
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,226
THAT IN RESPONSE
TO THE MEDIA PRESSURE,

293
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,095
THERE WILL BE
A PRESS CONFERENCE.

294
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,330
Ames: MY GOD, THIS IS HOW
A HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER LIVES?

295
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,167
THIS IS BIGGER
THAN THE WHITE HOUSE.

296
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,704
Stanley Motss: GET ME
MY VEGGIE SHAKE, RAMON,

297
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,307
AND REMIND ME
TO TURN OVER IN 10 MINUTES

298
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,642
TO TAN THE OTHER SIDE.

299
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,312
UH, DO I KNOW YOU?

300
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,948
Brean: WE HAVE SOME MUTUAL
FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON.

301
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,285
YES, AS YOU SAID,
AND IS IT TRUE?

302
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,387
Ames: OH, MR. MOTSS,
I WOULDN'T--

303
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,422
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF IT WASN'T TRUE.

304
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,456
IT'S TRUE, RIGHT?

305
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,927
WELL, REALLY,
WHO COULD SAY?

306
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,629
I LIKE THE GUY.
HE SIGNED HIS BOOK TO ME,

307
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,766
"FOR 2 GENERATIONS--"
NO, WHAT WAS IT?

308
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,535
"FOR PROGRESS TO OCCUR,
I THINK HE SAID."

309
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,405
2 GENERATIONS
TO AGREE, YES.

310
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,707
THAT'S WHAT HE INSCRIBED.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

311
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,942
THAT'S THE TITLE
OF THE BOOK.

312
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,510
THAT'S THE TITLE?

313
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,945
MM-HMM. YEAH.

314
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,680
FOR PROGRESS TO OCCUR
IT'S NECESSARY FOR 2--

315
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,249
THAT'S A TERRIBLE TITLE.

316
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,954
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

317
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,823
FOR 2 GENERATIONS
TO AGREE.

318
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:36,990
THAT IS THE TITLE.

319
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,391
YOU KNOW, I NEVER
LOOKED AT THE COVER.

320
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,527
I JUST LOOKED AT
WHAT HE WROTE TO ME.

321
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,829
WELL, WHEN YOU GET THE TIME,
YOU CAN READ THE COVER.

322
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,230
PRESS SECRETARY
JOHN LEVY.

323
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,665
HE'S EXPECTED TO RESPOND
TO THE FIREFLY'S ALLEGATIONS

324
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,867
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT
BY THE PRESIDENT.

325
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,803
OOH, THIS GUY
IS FUCKED.

326
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,974
Brean: WELL, WHAT ONE
HAS TO DO, MR. MOTSS,

327
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,775
IS TO FIGHT A HOLDING ACTION.

328
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,910
HOLDING ACTION?

329
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,045
THEY'RE GOING
TO RUN THIS MAN

330
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,746
THROUGH
THE SHREDDER.

331
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,214
IF WE CAN HOLD THE BREAK
IN THE DAM

332
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,183
FOR 11 DAYS TILL THE ELECTION,
WE THINK WE GOT A CHANCE.

333
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,318
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
HOLD THE DAM.

334
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,286
HOW THE HELL--

335
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,057
I DON'T GET WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO.

336
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,759
Levy: ADVISED HIM TO STAY
ON THE GROUND IN CHINA

337
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,327
FOR, THEY ESTIMATE,
ONE OR 2 DAYS.

338
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,297
AND DURING THAT TIME,
OF COURSE, WE'LL REMAIN--

339
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,299
YEAH, BUT HE'S GOTTA
COME BACK SOMETIME.

340
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,434
WHAT THE HELL IS ONE OR 2
DAYS GONNA BUY YOU?

341
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,970
LOOK AT ALL THOSE HANDS.

342
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,737
BRER RABBIT COULDN'T
GET OUT OF THIS.

343
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,007
WOULD YOU COMMENT PLEASE
ON THE RUMORS

344
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,043
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S DELAY

345
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,646
IS DUE TO THE SITUATION

00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,202
NO, NO, NO. CROSS THAT OUT.

519
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,304
ALL RIGHT,
SO IT'S A SUITCASE BOMB.

520
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,272
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I SAID THAT.

521
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,840
IT'S A SUITCASE BOMB.

522
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,941
YOU DON'T NEED MISSILES.

523
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,477
YOU CAN PUT A BOMB
IN A SUITCASE.

524
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,078
IT'S A SUITCASE BOMB.

525
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,715
THAT'S GOOD.
A SUITCASE BOMB.

526
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,251
IT'S A SUITCASE BOMB.

527
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,386
WHEN IT'S COOKING,
IT'S COOKING.

528
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,088
WE'RE COOKING,
AND IT'S IN...

529
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,990
IT'S IN--IT'S IN...

530
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,125
CANADA.

531
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,427
ALL RIGHT?

532
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,862
ALBANIAN TERRORISTS HAVE
PLACED A SUITCASE BOMB

533
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:23,796
IN CANADA IN AN ATTEMPT

534
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,066
TO INFILTRATE THE BOMB
INTO THE USA.

535
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,435
THAT'S GOOD.

536
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,269
HUH?

537
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,537
THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S TERRIFIC,

538
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,539
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
IT IS COST EFFECTIVE.

539
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,007
IT'S PRODUCING.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

540
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,175
NO, IT'S REALLY GREAT.

541
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,610
OH, LISTEN, I COULD
TELL YOU STORIES.

542
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,979
CECIL B. DE MILLE,
THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.

543
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,981
HE NEEDS AN ELEPHANT.

544
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,884
I GOT THE PRESIDENT
ON THE LINE.

545
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,519
HEY, ONE MINUTE.

546
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,521
DE MILLE, RIGHT?
NEEDS AN ELEPHANT

547
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,757
FOR A RESHOOT.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES?

548
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:51,758
AMES HERE.

549
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,159
YES, SIR?

550
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,160
YOU LISTENING?

551
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,161
OH, YEAH.

552
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,263
NOBODY'S LISTENING.

553
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,264
I'M LISTENING.

554
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,499
OK, OK, THE SUITCASE BOMB.

555
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,733
OOH, GOOD TITLE
FOR A MOVIE.

556
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,602
PLEASE, WRITE IT DOWN.
DON'T EDITORIALIZE.

557
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,104
THE THINKING IS,
TERRORISM.

558
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:08,508
ACT 1: ALBANIA DENIES
EVERYTHING.

559
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,711
THE PRESIDENT COMES
ON THE AIR, "BE CALM."

560
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,212
KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA NEED
RIGHT AWAY?

561
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,684
YOU BETTER GET ME JOHNNY DEAN,
LIZ BUTSKY AND THE FAD KING.

562
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,319
ISN'T JOHNNY DEAN
IN THE...

563
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,988
BACK IN NASHVILLE.

564
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,023
OK, ACT 2.

565
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,425
WE DON'T NEED
AN ACT 2.

566
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,294
DON'T FORGET,
YOU KNOW, FAD KING.

567
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,395
WE DON'T NEED AN ACT 2?

568
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,429
WE JUST HAVE TO HOLD
THEIR INTEREST

569
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,330
FOR 11 DAYS
TILL THE ELECTION.

570
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,332
IT'S A TEASER.

571
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,066
IT'S A TEASER.
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

572
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,134
GRACE.

573
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,135
Grace: YEAH?

574
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,304
TEASER.

575
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,805
THEY'RE GETTING
A REALLY GOOD REACTION

576
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:39,839
ON THE ALBANIAN THING.

577
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,209
HELLO, JOHN, YOU 2-BIT
REDNECK SHITKICKER,

578
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,911
HOW THE HECK ARE YOU?

579
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,946
GET OUT, GET OUT.

580
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,448
[LAUGHS]

581
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,485
HE'S GOT A NEW WIFE.

582
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,186
RIGHT NOW HE'S RIDING AROUND
IN A PICKUP TRUCK

583
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,356
WITH A SHOTGUN
AND A DOG.

584
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,724
[LAUGHS]

585
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,528
LISTEN, LISTEN.

586
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,229
WE NEED YOU HERE YESTERDAY.

587
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,064
ALL RIGHT? YEAH.

588
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,499
COME ON,
GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE.

589
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,634
THE PRESIDENT
WONDERS

590
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:08,901
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE
ALBANIAN BACKLASH.

591
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,571
YOU CAN'T HAVE A WAR
WITHOUT AN ENEMY.

592
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,106
WE COULD HAVE ONE, BUT IT
WOULD BE A VERY DULL WAR.

593
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,508
HOW LONG DO WE
NEED HIM HERE FOR?

594
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,377
WE'RE DONE IN 11 DAYS.

595
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,612
11 DAYS, JOHN.
WE NEED YOU.

596
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,048
YOU WANT TO WRITE
A SONG FOR US?

597
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,283
IS THERE GONNA BE
A BACK END ON THIS THING?

598
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,552
WHAT?

599
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,119
IS THERE GONNA BE
A BACK END ON THIS THING?

600
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,388
WHAT?
BACK END?

601
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,288
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

602
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,890
PERCENTAGE POINTS, MONEY.

603
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,325
YEAH,
COUNT ON IT.

604
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,893
WHERE IS THE BACK
END COMING FROM?

605
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:34,961
LOTS OF CASH, JOHN.

606
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,729
IT'S LIKE THAT THING
WITH THE YELLOW RIBBONS.

607
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,964
THING WITH
THE YELLOW RIBBONS?

608
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,065
YEAH, THE HOSTAGES.

609
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,567
HOSTAGES?

610
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,869
YEAH. THEY TIED THE YELLOW
RIBBONS AROUND EVERYTHING.

611
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,237
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS
A NATURALLY OCCURRING--

612
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,074
WHAT? THAT WAS
A PUT-UP JOB?

613
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,075
Motss: ALL RIGHT.

614
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,310
GRACE. GRACE!

615
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,679
Grace:
YES, WHAT?

616
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,746
JEEZ.

617
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,783
Motss: I WANT YOU TO GET
JOHNNY A TICKET, OK?

618
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,950
FAD KING ON 2.

619
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,586
OK. HE'S RIDING AROUND
IN A PICKUP TRUCK RIGHT NOW

620
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,320
WITH A SHOTGUN AND A DOG.

621
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,056
ARE YOU
SHITTING ME?

622
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,425
KING.

623
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,794
LISTEN, YEAH. GOT A THING
HERE, PRODUCT PLACEMENT.

624
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,029
OF COURSE
THERE'S A BACK END.

625
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:12,632
IT CAN'T BE
A RIBBON.

626
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:13,633
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH A RIBBON?

627
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:14,801
'CAUSE AIDS
HAS A RIBBON,

628
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:15,835
THE YELLOW RIBBON
THING HAD A RIBBON.

629
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,903
FUCK RIBBONS.

630
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,605
LOOK, CANADA, OK?
OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH

631
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,441
ALL OF A SUDDEN TRANSFORMED
INTO THAT PLACE FROM WHENCE,

632
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,810
LIKE THE NORTH WIND,
TERROR COMES.

633
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,211
I LIKE THAT.
KEEP TALKING.

634
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,779
WHAT GUARDS US
AGAINST CANADA?

635
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:30,383
* I GUARD
THE CANADIAN BORDER *

636
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,818
MOUNTIES GUARD THE BORDER.
MOUNTIE HATS.

637
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,386
Fad King: NO.
STUPID FUCKING HATS.

638
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,754
DAVY CROCKETT HAD A HAT.
HE MADE A FORTUNE.

639
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,088
WITH DAVY CROCKETT HATS,
YOU COULD CRUSH THEM

640
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,890
WHEN YOU FELT STUPID
AND PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET.

641
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,560
YOU CAN'T PUT A MOUNTIE HAT
IN YOUR POCKET.

642
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,794
YOU SEE THIS?

643
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,329
THIS IS WHAT
PRODUCING IS.

644
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,265
YOU PUT ME IN A ROOM
WITH TALENT, WHOO.

645
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,600
ELECTRIC.

646
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,268
I'M THINKING ARMBANDS.
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

647
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,003
ARMBANDS IS GOOD.

648
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,639
AND I'M THINKING GREEN.

649
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,806
NOT LIKE KELLY GREEN.

650
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,941
LAST YEAR THE NUMBER ONE
SELLING COLOR

651
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,643
IN NEW CARS IN AMERICA
WAS GREEN.

652
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:57,877
PEOPLE LIKE GREEN,
BUT NOT...

653
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,845
HUNTER.

654
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,881
HUNTER GREEN.
STRONG, PRIDE, DIGNITY.

655
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,783
NOT KELLY GREEN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

656
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,185
I LIKE IT WITH A HAT.
PUT IT WITH A HAT.

657
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,186
MAYBE.

658
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,387
YOU SEE THAT?

659
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:14,126
* SIT ON MY LAP
IF YOU LOVE ME *

660
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,263
* BUT DON'T PUT
YOUR HAND DOWN THERE *

661
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,431
Motss: NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN--

662
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,468
* WE'LL TAKE A SHORT NAP *

663
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,670
SEE, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD SEE IT.

664
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,071
I DON'T THINK
IT SHOULD BE A SONG.

665
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:29,509
* I'M GLAD THAT
YOUR MAMA'S NOT HERE *

666
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,243
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO DO A SONG ABOUT IT.

667
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,411
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS FUNNY.

668
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,746
* SIT ON MY LAP *

669
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,416
I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

670
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,819
I JUST MEANT
FOR YOU TO SEE IT.

671
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,689
* I GUARD
THE CANADIAN BORDER *

672
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,924
THE PRESIDENT SPENT THE WEEKEND
PRESSING THE FLESH.

673
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:49,028
HE WASN'T CAMPAIGNING,
HE WAS DATING, ACTUALLY.

674
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,430
CONNIE.

675
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,666
CHANGE THIS.
THANK YOU.

676
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,368
BEHIND THE MENTION OF ALBANIA,
OF HIS STOMACH FLU.

677
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,706
TAKING REFUGE THESE SCANT DAYS
AWAY FROM THE ELECTION.

678
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,874
YOUNG GIRL IN RUBBLE.

679
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,176
SHE WAS DRIVEN FROM HER HOME
BY ALBANIAN TERRORISTS.

680
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:08,481
OK, IT IS HER
WE ARE MOBILIZING TO DEFEND.

681
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,782
OR IS IT SHE?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

682
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,050
IT IS "HER WE
ARE MOBILIZING."

683
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,451
CAN WE GET HER A KITTEN?

684
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,987
YOUNG GIRL IN RUBBLE
WITH A KITTEN.

685
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,222
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

686
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:19,425
SEE, THIS IS TOO STATIC.

687
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,361
YOUNG GIRL RUNNING
FROM THE VILLAGE.

688
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:23,496
RIGHT? MORE ENERGY.

689
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,765
TIME TO FACE THESE

00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,485
MY NAME IS CONRAD BREAN.

1204
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,654
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

1205
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,321
NOBODY WHOSE NAME
YOU WANT ME TO SAY,

1206
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,523
MR. YOUNG, I PROMISE YOU.

1207
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,592
HA HA.
IT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,

1208
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,993
BUT WHEN
THE FIT HITS THE SHAN,

1209
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,728
SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE
TO STAY AFTER SCHOOL.

1210
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,129
WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT MIGHT BE?

1211
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,632
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1212
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:43,234
THE SPY SATELLITES
SHOW IT, MR. BREAN.

1213
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,502
THEY SHOW NO WAR.

1214
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,471
THEN WHAT GOOD ARE THEY
IF THEY SHOW NO WAR?

1215
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,539
WHAT ARE WE SPENDING

1216
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,506
A QUARTER TRILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR

1217
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,708
ON OUR DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT?

1218
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:50,609
WHAT GOOD ARE THEY
IF THEY SHOW NOTHING?

1219
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,643
WHAT ARE THEY,
USELESS,

1220
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,844
OR ARE THEY
JUST BROKEN?

1221
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,780
UHHHH, I WOULD LIKE
TO POINT OUT FURTHER

1222
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,047
THAT THESE MEDICATIONS
TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION--

1223
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,515
IF THERE'S NO THREAT,
THEN WHERE ARE YOU?

1224
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,817
LET ME GO YOU ONE MORE.

1225
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,619
IF THERE'S NO THREAT,
WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?

1226
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,988
MR. BREAN YOU
ARE THE THREAT.

1227
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,155
I'M THE THREAT?

1228
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,757
WELL, WHAT HAVE I BEEN
DOING THE LAST 30 YEARS

1229
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:06,825
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN DOING?

1230
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:07,826
YOU WANT TO
FILL ME IN ON THAT?

1231
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,494
THE LAST 30 YEARS,
MR. BREAN,

1232
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,630
I HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ENSURE
THE SECURITY OF MY COUNTRY.

1233
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,431
WELL, I'M SURE
THAT SPEAKS WELL
AS HAVE WE ALL.

1234
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,433
OF YOU
AND YOUR PARENTS,
THE SECURITY OF
THIS COUNTRY--

1235
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,568
BUT IF FORCED TO CHOOSE

1236
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:17,969
BETWEEN THE SECURITY
OF YOUR COUNTRY

1237
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,237
AND THE SECURITY OF YOUR JOB,
WHICH WOULD YOU PICK?

1238
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,940
AND WHILE YOU HESITATE,
PERMIT ME TO SUGGEST

1239
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,241
THAT THEY ARE ONE IN THE SAME,

1240
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,442
YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR JOB.

1241
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,877
I'M DOING MY JOB, MR. BREAN.

1242
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,878
THAT'S WHAT
YOU SEE ME DOING.

1243
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,580
I'M DOING MY JOB, TOO...

1244
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,781
THE CONSTANT STRESS
THAT I AM UNDER...

1245
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,751
AND LET ME ASK YOU
A SIMPLE QUESTION.

1246
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:35,453
WHY DO PEOPLE
GO TO WAR?

1247
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,688
I'LL PLAY YOUR SILLY GAME.

1248
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:37,689
OK. WHY DO THEY
GO TO WAR?

1249
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:38,924
TO ENSURE
THEIR WAY OF LIFE.

1250
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,158
WOULD YOU GO TO WAR
TO DO THAT?

1251
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:40,992
I HAVE.

1252
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:41,993
AND IF YOU WENT
TO WAR AGAIN,

1253
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,762
WHO WOULD IT
BE AGAINST, HUH?

1254
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:44,763
YOUR ABILITY
TO FIGHT

1255
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,364
A 2-OCEAN WAR
AGAINST WHO?

1256
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:47,432
SWEDEN AND TOGO?

1257
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,300
THAT TIME HAS
PASSED. IT'S OVER.

1258
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,337
THE WAR OF THE FUTURE
IS NUCLEAR TERRORISM.

1259
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,538
IT IS, AND IT'LL BE

1260
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:54,806
AGAINST A SMALL GROUP
OF DISSIDENTS WHO,

1261
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,174
UNBEKNOWNST PERHAPS TO
THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS,

1262
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,776
HAVE BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

1263
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,611
AND TO GO TO THAT WAR,
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED.

1264
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,112
YOU GOTTA BE ALERT.

1265
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,547
THE PUBLIC HAS
GOTTA BE ALERT,

1266
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,282
BECAUSE THAT IS
THE WAR OF THE FUTURE,

1267
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,118
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GEARING UP
TO FIGHT THAT WAR,

1268
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,486
THEN EVENTUALLY
THE AX WILL FALL,

1269
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:09,655
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
OUT IN THE STREET,

1270
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:10,856
AND YOU CAN CALL THIS
A DRILL,

1271
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:12,557
YOU CAN CALL
THIS JOB SECURITY,

1272
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:13,825
YOU CAN CALL IT
ANYTHING YOU LIKE,

1273
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,160
BUT I GOT ONE FOR YOU.

1274
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,695
YOU SAID GO TO WAR TO
PRESERVE YOUR WAY OF LIFE?

1275
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,965
WELL, CHUCK,
THIS IS YOUR WAY OF LIFE.

1276
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,167
AND IF YOUR SPY SATELLITES
DON'T SEE NOTHING,

1277
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,702
IF THERE AIN'T NO WAR,

1278
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:24,903
THEN YOU CAN GO HOME

1279
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,705
AND PREMATURELY
TAKE UP GOLF, MY FRIEND,

1280
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,940
'CAUSE THERE AIN'T
NO WAR BUT OURS.

1281
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,681
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

1282
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:36,715
DRIVE CAREFULLY.

1283
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:37,916
THANK YOU.
BYE-BYE.

1284
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:39,985
THANK YOU.

1285
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,158
NICE ENOUGH PEOPLE.

1286
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,927
THEY JUST HADN'T
THOUGHT IT THROUGH.

1287
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:50,829
NO, YOU TALKED US OUT
OF THERE RIGHT EASY.

1288
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:51,997
NO. WE JUST GOT DELAYED.
WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

1289
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:54,199
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO NASHVILLE. WHAT?

1290
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,434
I SAID YOU COULD TALK
A DOG OFF A MEAT TRUCK.

1291
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,003
OH, THANK YOU.

1292
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,437
NO, WE JUST GOT STUCK.
IT'S OK.

1293
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:02,240
ALL SYSTEMS FIVE-BY-FIVE.
SEE YOU IN NASHVILLE. YEAH.

1294
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,142
CONNIE, YOU KNOW,
YOU SAVED OUR BACON.

1295
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,344
IT WAS JUST A...

1296
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,679
A PHENOMENAL
PERFORMANCE.

1297
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,747
AW, YOU KNOW--

1298
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:10,181
NO, BUT YOU
TURNED THEM AROUND.

1299
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,950
YOU TURNED THEM
AROUND LIKE A--

1300
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,451
WELL, THEY JUST HADN'T
THOUGHT IT THROUGH.

1301
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:14,652
OH.

1302
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,694
Television reporter: HE'S
MOVING ACROSS THE TARMAC.

1303
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,998
BUT IT APPEARS SOMETHING

1304
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,700
HAS DISTRACTED
THE PRESIDENT,

1305
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,901
AND HE HAS STOPPED MOVING

1306
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,136
TOWARD
THE WAITING MOTORCADE.

1307
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:33,004
IT APPEARS
THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL

1308
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,106
TRYING TO SPEAK
TO THE PRESIDENT.

1309
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,808
IT SEEMS SHE'S SPEAKING IN--

1310
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,243
IS IT ALBANIAN?

1311
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:40,245
COULD WE GET SOMEONE
UP THERE TO TRANSLATE?

1312
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,412
[SPEAKING ALBANIAN]

1313
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,782
Second reporter: DAN,
I THINK WHAT SHE IS SAYING

1314
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:47,786
IS THAT THIS WHEAT OFFERING
IS SORT OF CEREMONIAL.

1315
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:50,488
AND THAT IT IS
THE FIRST SHEAF,

1316
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,057
THE FIRST CUT
OF THE HARVEST.

1317
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:54,092
I'M NOT PROFICIENT
IN ALBANIAN,

1318
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:55,827
BUT THE OLD WOMAN
IS QUITE TAKEN

1319
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:58,063
AS THE PRESIDENT IS
OFFERING HER THE COAT.

1320
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,731
IT IS QUITE
AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT HERE.

1321
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,966
OH!

1322
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:04,069
Female singer:
* THERE COMES A TIME *

1323
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:08,073
* IN THE COURSE
OF HUMAN EVENTS *

1324
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:09,507
Male singer:
* WHEN A PRAYER *

1325
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:11,810
* MUST BE ANSWERED *

1326
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,780
* WITH COURAGE
AND STRENGTH *

1327
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,416
* OUR FOREFATHERS EARNED *

1328
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,786
* THE RIGHT TO BE FREE *

1329
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:23,554
* NOW IT'S TIME *

1330
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,558
* TO GUARD
THEIR DREAM *

1331
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,695
* WE GUARD *

1332
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,664
* OUR AMERICAN BORDERS *

1333
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:34,833
* OUR AMERICAN
BORDERS *

1334
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,435
* WE GUARD *

1335
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:40,571
* THE AMERICAN DREAM *

1336
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,141
* WE GUARD OUR RIGHT *

1337
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:46,744
* TO FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY *

1338
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,113
* OH, DEMOCRACY *

1339
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:52,550
* AND KEEP
OUR COUNTRY FREE *

1340
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,585

00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,287

00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,209
* OOH, OOH *

1364
00:46:57,082 --> 00:47:00,618
I LOVED THE FAT,
WET ALBANIAN BROAD.

1365
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:01,752
OH, THANK YOU.

1366
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,388
YOU KNOW WHY?
IT WAS UNDERSTATED.

1367
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,190
SO YOU GOT LUCKY
WITH THE RAIN, TOO.

1368
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,692
WELL, WE HAD TO DIVERT
THE PLANE TO BOCA RATON.

1369
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:08,894
OH, YOU SHOULD
HAVE COME TO ME.

1370
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:09,995
WE HAVE
RAIN MACHINES.

1371
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,496
I'M A PRODUCER.
I MAKE RAIN.

1372
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,998
Brean: NEXT TIME.

1373
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:15,901
Senator Neal:
I HAVE JUST GOTTEN WORD

1374
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,904
THAT THE SITUATION
IN ALBANIA IS RESOLVED,

1375
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:21,339
THAT IT IS RESOLVED.

1376
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,941
THE CIA CONFIRMS

1377
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:25,944
THAT OUR TROOPS
ALONG THE CANADIAN BORDER

1378
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:28,713
AND OVERSEAS
ARE STANDING DOWN.

1379
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:32,050
AND I MUST TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

1380
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,019
TO CALL UPON
OUR PRESIDENT...

1381
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,086
WHAT DOES HE MEAN,

1382
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,121
THE SITUATION
HAS BEEN RESOLVED?

1383
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:37,889
HE JUST ENDED THE WAR.

1384
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,124
HE ENDED THE WAR?

1385
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:40,491
WHY DID HE HAVE TO
GO AND DO THAT?

1386
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,160
I THINK THE CIA
JUST CUT A BETTER DEAL.

1387
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,394
HE ENDED THE WAR?

1388
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:46,264
Neal: THE INNOCENCE
OF A CHILD...

1389
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:47,899
I CAN'T--
HE CAN'T END THE WAR.

1390
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:49,935
HE'S NOT PRODUCING THIS.

1391
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:53,138
Singers:
* WE GUARD... *

1392
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:56,641
THIS IS IN BAD TASTE.
CAN WE STOP THIS?

1393
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:57,909
* OUR AMERICAN
BORDERS *

1394
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,310
* WE GUARD... *

1395
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,179
Brean: STOP.
IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER.

1396
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,147
OK.

1397
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:03,848
CAN WE STOP THIS?
CAN WE STOP THIS?

1398
00:48:03,848 --> 00:48:05,483
Motss: STOP THE CHOIR.

1399
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:06,851
WHAT?

1400
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,054
IT HAS BEEN QUITE
A WEEK, RICHARD.

1401
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:10,221
I CAN'T REMEMBER

1402
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,389
WHEN ANY PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES

1403
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,224
WAS HIT WITH
THE FLU, A WAR,

1404
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,892
AND ACCUSED
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

1405
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,927
BY A TEENAGE GIRL

1406
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,795
ALL IN THE SAME
7-DAY PERIOD.

1407
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:18,997
THIS, OR COURSE,

1408
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:21,099
ONLY DAYS BEFORE HE
RUNS FOR REELECTION.

1409
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,533
Male reporter: WE HAVE
JUST RECEIVED INFORMATION

1410
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:23,634
FROM SOURCES AT THE CIA

1411
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,804
THAT CONFIRMS THE CESSATION
OF HOSTILITIES...

1412
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:27,805
THE CIA.

1413
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:29,674
UH, YOU KNOW,
I--CIA.

1414
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:31,176
CIA. CIA.

1415
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:33,178
I THOUGHT THEY LET US
OUT OF THERE TOO EASILY.

1416
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:35,080
THE WAR'S OVER, GUYS.
Motss: NO.

1417
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,148
IT'S OVER.
I SAW IT ON TELEVISION.

1418
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,583
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
SELL MY HOUSE.

1419
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,750
THE WAR'S NOT OVER.

1420
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,719
NO, THE WAR ISN'T OVER.

1421
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,054
Brean: I SAW IT
ON TV.

1422
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,190
NO. THAT'S WHAT
YOU HIRED ME FOR.

1423
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,491
NO, THE WAR ISN'T OVER

1424
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,460
UNTIL I SAY IT'S OVER,
OK? THIS IS MY PICTURE.

1425
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,828
THIS IS NOT
THE CIA's PICTURE.

1426
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:52,797
YOU THINK YOU'RE
IN A TIGHT SPOT NOW.

1427
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:54,532
ALL RIGHT, CONRAD,
TRY MAKING

1428
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,667
THE FOUR HORSEMEN
OF THE APOCALYPSE--

1429
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:57,668
TELL HIM, KING.

1430
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:58,669
THREE OF THE HORSEMEN DIED.

1431
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,670
HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING?

1432
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,406
THREE OF
THE HORSEMEN DIED

1433
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:04,042
2 WEEKS BEFORE THE END
OF PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

1434
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,077
THIS IS NOTHING.
THIS IS NOTHING.

1435
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:09,247
THIS IS JUST ACT ONE,
"THE WAR."

1436
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:12,117
NOW WE REALLY DO NEED
AN ACT TWO,

1437
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,418
SO WE WORK.

1438
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:14,219
ACT TWO.

1439
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:15,987
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE?

1440
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,788
THE JAPANESE.
IN THE CAVES.

1441
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,457
GO ON.
OKINAWA.

1442
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,425
GO ON.

1443
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:21,892
THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE
THE WAR WAS OVER.

1444
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,961
THAT'S RIGHT, SO NOW WE HAVE
A GUY WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE--

1445
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,097
NO, NO, NO. WE HAVE
AN AMERICAN SERVICEMAN.

1446
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:27,698
A BRAVE AMERICAN
SERVICEMAN

1447
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,034
IS LEFT BEHIND.

1448
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:31,236
A HERO.

1449
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:33,004
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1450
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,105
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

1451
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:35,306
WE HAD A WAR.
WE FORGOT THE HERO.

1452
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,209
YOU CAN'T HAVE A WAR
AND NOT HAVE A HERO.

1453
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,510
IT'S LIKE WE SENT
HIM A CHRISTMAS CARD

1454
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,412
AND LEFT OUT THE
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

1455
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:42,413
FRUITCAKE.

1456
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:43,214
THERE YOU GO.

1457
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,482
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S WORK, OK?

1458
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,251
WE GOT A GUY
WHO'S LEFT BEHIND,

1459
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:48,119
SO, UH--OH,
THIS IS TERRIFIC.

1460
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,120
OH, THIS IS
LUCKY THIS HAPPENED.

1461
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,288
HE WAS LEFT BEHIND.

1462
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,990
HE WAS JUST DISCARDED
LIKE A--LIKE A--

1463
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,492
LIKE AN OLD SHOE.

1464
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,893
OH, THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

1465
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:57,728
WHAT'S GOOD?
WHAT DID I SAY?

1466
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,030
SHOE.
OLD SHOE?

1467
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,398
IT'S JUST INSTINCT.

1468
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:04,269
CONRAD, I WANT YOU
TO GET ME THE PENTAGON,

1469
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:07,805
A LIST OF PEOPLE IN ALL
MILITARY SPECIAL PROGRAMS.

1470
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:10,041
"LEFT BEHIND LIKE
AN OLD SHOE." THAT IS GOOD.

1471
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:13,344
OK, I WANT TO TALK TO JOHNNY
BEYOND THE GLASS.

1472
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,545
JOHNNY!

1473
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,115
JOHNNY!

1474
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:18,116
YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

1475
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:21,152
THE WAR IS OVER, OK?

1476
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,288
NOW WE'RE GOING
TO NEED A NEW SONG.

1477
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:26,124
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A SONG
ABOUT A SHOE, A SHINY SHOE,

1478
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,793
A--A--A BLACK PATENT SHOE,

1479
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,461
A GOOD OLD--A GOOD OLD SHOE.

1480
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,298
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO GET DRUNK.

1481
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:34,465
YES, YOU GET DRUNK, JOHN,

1482
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,634
BUT I NEED
A NEW SONG, OK?

1483
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,435
A GOOD OLD SHOE SONG.

1484
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,003
IT SHOULD BE
A BALLAD OF LOSS

1485
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,606
AND, UH--AND, UH--
YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

1486
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:42,607
King: REDEMPTION.

1487
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:45,476
LOSS AND REDEMPTION
IS VERY, VERY GOOD.

1488
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:48,879
OH, SHIT. WHAT KEY
DO YOU WANT IT IN?

1489
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,248
NO, I DON'T KNOW KEYS.

1490
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:52,917
JOHNNY, I GOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE

1491
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,185
WHO ARE
A LITTLE DEPRESSED

1492
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:55,286
BECAUSE THE WAR
JUST ENDED.

1493
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:57,422
PLEASE GIVE ME
A NEW SONG.

1494
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,290
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT HIM ON THE PHONE.

1495
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,659
KING, PENTAGON.

1496
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,927
TAKE IT.

00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,236
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHO THEY'RE PLAYING WITH.

1500
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,272
SEE, THAT'S--THEY DON'T
SHUT DOWN OUR PICTURE.

1501

YOU PEOPLE
GONNA BE LONG?

1502
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,309
OTHERWISE, I'LL
PUT AWAY THE EQUIPMENT.

1503
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:19,544
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

1504
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:21,579
I THINK I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE WRITING A SONG.

1505
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,413
WRITING A SONG?

1506
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,548
WHAT KIND OF SONG
YOU WRITING?

1507
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:26,050

1542
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,697
HE'S TRAPPED.

1543
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:47,732
IN THE SWEATER.

1544
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:48,733
IN THE SWEATER.

1545
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:49,534
GOOD.

1546
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:53,371
IS THERE A WAY
WE CAN MAKE IT

1547
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,873

OH, GOD.

1577
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,584
WHO'S SEEING THE GUY
FROM CBS TONIGHT?

1578
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,921
TONIGHT,
YOU REMEMBER SOME SONG

1579
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:17,788
FROM THE FOLK SONG DAYS,

1580
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:18,923
SOMETHING ABOUT
A GOOD OLD SHOE.

1581
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,224
Woman: TONIGHT?

1582
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:21,292
TONIGHT. YOU'RE
WITH HIM TONIGHT,

1583
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,327
WATCHING
THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH--

1584
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:24,295
WHAT IF HE'S BUSY TONIGHT?

1585
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,063
WELL, LURE HIM.

1586
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:27,064
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1587
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,299
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

1588
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:30,234
I DON'T HAVE TO BE
YOUR CONFESSOR, DARLING.

1589
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,069
TELL HIM YOU'VE
GOT SOME INFO

1590
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,103
ON THE PRESIDENT'S
SEX SCANDAL,

1591
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,405
IT'S ON YOUR CONSCIENCE.

1592
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:36,674
BELIEVE ME, HE'LL DROP
WHATEVER HE'S DOING, OK?

1593
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:38,876
NOW, FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS
IS A SHITTY BUSINESS,

1594
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:40,978
AND IT NEEDS NO "GHOST
COME FROM THE GRAVE"

1595
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:41,912
TO TELL US THAT,

1596
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:42,980
BUT, LORD WILLING
AND JESUS TARRIES,

1597
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,781
8 DAYS FROM NOW,

1598
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:44,982
I'M GONNA BE
TAKING YOU FOLKS

1599
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,250
INTO THE SECOND TERM.

1600
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,618
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR
THE SPEECH TONIGHT.

1601
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,387
THE 3-0-3 SPEECH. GREAT.

1602
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:51,456
WHERE'S THAT FAD KING,
BY THE WAY?

1603
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:52,523
OH, I'LL GET HIM.

1604
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,758
COULD WE GO NOW,
PLEASE, PEOPLE?

1605
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:54,792
A GOOD PLAN TODAY
IS BETTER

1606
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,126
THAN A PERFECT PLAN
TOMORROW.

1607
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,596
CONRAD, HOW ARE THEY DOING
ON SERGEANT SCHUMANN?

1608
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:00,531
THEY'RE WORKING ON HIM,
THEY'RE FINDING HIM.

1609
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:02,567
GOOD. IT'S WORKING.
IT'S WORKING. IT'S WORKING.

1610
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:03,634
IT'S ALL HAPPENING, PEOPLE.

1611
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,135
IT'S TAKING PLACE
AROUND US, OK?

1612
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,904
PEOPLE, IT IS IN THE WORKS.

1613
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,640
IT IS BEING ADDRESSED.
WE ARE BEING PROACTIVE.

1614
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,741
WE ARE GOING OUT TONIGHT

1615
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:12,109
WITH WHAT MAY BE
THE FINEST EXAMP--

1616
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:13,110
OK, OK.
WINIFRED, WINIFRED.

1617
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,379
YEAH?

1618
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:15,713
GET ME AN UPDATE ON
THE ARMY, THE PENTAGON.

1619
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:17,382
GET THIS GUY SCHUMANN
AND PUT HIM ON HOLD, OK?

1620
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:18,516
HAVE HIM STANDING BY.

1621
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:19,850
PEOPLE, PEOPLE,
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

1622
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,087
I SEE A LOT OF GLUM,
GLUM FACES NOW.

1623
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:24,555
PLEASE
DON'T BE DISCONSOLATE.

1624
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:26,991
THIS IS--
THIS IS POLITICS

1625
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:27,992
AT ITS FINEST.

1626
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,060
THIS IS WHERE THE RUBBER
MEETS THE ROAD,

1627
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,195
AND I'M HERE
TO TELL YOU,

1628
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,297
WE'VE GOT A LEADER
GOING OUT TONIGHT

1629
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,332
TO 95 MILLION
AMERICAN HOMES.

1630
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,667
HE'S GONNA TURN
THIS THING AROUND.

1631
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,769
YOU THINK THIS IS TOUGH?

1632
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,270
I WAS 4 MONTHS
INTO PRODUCTION

1633
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,439
ON THE SONG OF SOLOMON,

1634
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:42,907
FOUND OUT I DIDN'T
HAVE THE RIGHTS.

1635
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,509
Ames: HEY, TURN IT UP.
IT'S OUR SPOT.

1636
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:45,610
OH, ALL RIGHT.
JUST PUT HIM ON.

1637
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,845
TOUGH? THIS IS NOTHING.

1638
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:52,016
THIS--WILL YOU
LOOK AT THAT...SHIT?

1639
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,685
'CAUSE YOU DON'T CHANGE
HORSES IN MIDSTREAM.

1640
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,987
YEAH, HI. HELLO, SIR.

1641
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:59,557
Woman on television:
DON'T CHANGE HORSES.

1642
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:00,958
THIS SPEECH
IS VERY GOOD.

1643
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:04,829
WE'RE KINDA LOCKED
INTO IT, MR. PRESIDENT.

1644
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,164
Announcer: FOR THE FUTURE
OF OUR FAMILIES...

1645
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:08,165
AND THE MUSIC.

1646
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:09,299
WHERE DID
THEY GET THAT?

1647
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,602
OK. ALL RIGHT. YES.

1648
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:14,939
PAIN IN THE ASS.

1649
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,908
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

1650
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:18,709
HE WON'T DO IT.

1651
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,244
HE WON'T
DO THE SPEECH.

1652
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:21,245
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE WON'T DO IT?

1653
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,513
HE WON'T DO
THE SPEECH.

1654
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:24,081
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT CHOICE DOES HE HAVE?

1655
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,516
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE WON'T DO THE SPEECH?

1656
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:26,651
HE WON'T DO OUR SPEECH?

1657
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:27,652
HE SAYS IT'S CORNY.

1658
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:30,755
IT'S WHAT?
IT'S CORNY?

1659
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:33,057
CORNY?
OF COURSE IT'S CORNY.

1660
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,358
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HIM
SAY THE FLIPPIN' THING

1661
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:35,392
IF IT WASN'T CORNY.

1662
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,761
LOOK, NO,
IT'S NOT A QUESTION.

1663
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,629
THIS IS THE CENTER FOR
THE WHOLE REST OF THE THING.

1664
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:39,764
DON'T TELL ME IT'S CORNY.

1665
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:42,533
WE'RE LOCKED
INTO THE SPEECH, RIGHT?

1666
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:43,534
WE'RE LOCKED IN.

1667
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,503
WE ARE PLAYING
WAY PAST THIS.

1668
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:47,772
WE ARE PAST THIS. OK...

1669
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:50,407
CORNY. THIS IS WHAT I NEED.

1670
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,909
I WANT YOU TO GET ME
30 SECRETARIES,

1671
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,110
AND YOU PUT THEM
IN AN OFFICE NOW.

1672
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:53,911
OK? WOULD YOU?

1673
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,813
JUST TELL HIM
I'M COMING UP.

1674
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:56,947
I NEED
TO SEE THE PRESIDENT.

1675
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,816
I NEED 5 MINUTES
OF HIS TIME.

1676
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:00,851
SPEECH IS CORNY. KNOW
WHAT THIS REMINDS ME OF?

1677
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:03,954
YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST
WENT OUT TO HOLLYWOOD,

1678
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:05,355
THEY SAID TO ME,
"IT'S TOO THEATRICAL."

1679
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,491
THEY KNEW I WAS
FROM THE THEATER,

1680
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:07,458
SO EVERYTHING WAS
OVER THEIR HEADS.

1681
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,493
"IT'S TOO THEATRICAL."

1682
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:09,760
HE THINKS
IT'S TOO CORNY, NOW.

1683
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,529
OH, DON'T TELL ME
THE SPEECH IS CORNY.

1684
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:12,930
JUST TELL HIM
I'M COMIN' UP.

1685
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,666
Motss: MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
I THANK A MERCIFUL GOD,

1686
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:19,670
AND I AM SURE
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US

1687
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,672
WILL THANK
THAT SUPREME POWER,

1688
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:25,109
WHATEVER WE CONCEIVE
THAT POWER TO BE,

1689
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,311
THAT PEACE IS AT HAND.

1690
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:31,081
THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM
HAS BEEN QUELLED.

1691
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:34,218
MR. PRESIDENT, I'M USING
A LITTLE MORE PROJECTION

1692
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:40,024
BECAUSE I THINK THIS SPEECH
NEEDS A LITTLE UMPH.

1693
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,291
BEAR WITH ME.

1694
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,893
[SNIFFLING]

1695
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:44,529
BEAUTIFUL.

1696
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,064
Secretary:
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.

1697
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,672
[SOBBING]

1698
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:01,445
THAT WAS SO MOVING.

1699
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:03,748
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1700
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,990
YOU KNOW, CONNIE, I FELT
VERY MUCH AT HOME IN THERE.

1701
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,561
SIMPLE QUIRK OF FATE.
I COULD HAVE GONE THIS WAY.

1702
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:18,495
IT'S ALL A CHANGE
IN WARDROBE.

1703
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,931
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WAS IT TOO MUCH?

1704
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:25,002
I'LL TELL YOU,
STANLEY. YOU DID IT.

1705
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:25,870
YEAH.

1706
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,204
YOU DID IT.
YOU JUMPED IN THERE

1707
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,640
AND SAVED THE THING WHEN
THE THING NEEDED SAVING.

1708
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,475
YOU DON'T THINK
IT WAS TOO MUCH?

1709
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:34,779
PERSONALLY?
MAYBE...IT WAS.

1710
00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:37,514
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T
HAVE TO SAY IT THAT WAY.

1711
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,550
Brean: IT'S LIKE
PLATO ONCE SAID.

1712
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,218
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW THE FUCK YOU GET THERE

1713
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,519
AS LONG AS YOU GET THERE.

1714
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,921
HE SAID THAT?

1715
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:46,090
CONNIE, WHAT IS IT EXACTLY
YOU DO FOR THE PRESIDENT?

1716
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,393
President: MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
I THANK A MERCIFUL GOD,

1717
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,395
AND I'M SURE
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US

1718
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,163
WILL THANK
THAT SUPREME POWER,

1719
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:56,166
WHATEVER WE CONCEIVE
THAT POWER TO BE,

1720
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:58,569
THAT PEACE IS AT HAND.

1721
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:00,137
[CLEARS THROAT]

1722
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,043
THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM
WAS BEEN QUELLED.

1723
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,747
WE ARE IN CONTACT
WITH THE ALBANIAN PREMIER

1724
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:11,148
WHO ASSURES ME--

1725
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,584
AND THIS GOVERNMENT
CREDITS HIS ASSURANCES--

1726
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:16,186
THAT HIS COUNTRY
DOES NOT WISH US ILL...

1727
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,221
Liz: KNOW ANY LATIN?

1728
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,889
I, CLAUDIUS.
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW.

1729
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,593
I NEED A LATIN MOTTO
FOR THE PATCH.

1730
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,128
THE 303 PATCH.

1731
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:27,865
...BUT BY
A DESIGNATION NUMBER, 303.

1732
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:30,300
A MEMBER OF THAT GROUP
WAS LEFT BEHIND

1733
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,102
WHAT WERE THEN ENEMY LINES,

1734
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:36,473
AND I CAN ONLY SAY TO THOSE
FAMILY MEMBERS OF GROUP 303,

1735
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:39,243
WHOSE MEMBERS ARE,
I KNOW AS I SPEAK,

1736
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:40,611
GATHERING TO COMFORT YOU.

1737
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:43,013
TO THE PARENTS
OF THE MISSING MAN,

1738
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,882
I CAN ONLY SAY,
NO EFFORT WILL BE SPARED

1739
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:48,619
TO FIND THIS BRAVE MAN
AND BRING HIM HOME.

1740
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,621
WE'VE JUST RECEIVED
THIS PHOTOGRAPH

1741
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,022
OF SCHUMANN IN CAPTIVITY,

1742
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:55,125
HELD BY A DISSIDENT GROUP
OF ALBANIAN TERRORISTS.

1743
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:58,262
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU
ARE FAMILIAR WITH MORSE CODE,

1744
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:01,498
BUT COULD YOU BRING THE CAMERA
CLOSER IN HERE, PLEASE?

1745
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:05,569
YOU'LL SEE
HIS SWEATER IS WORN.

1746
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,972
IT HAS BEEN UNRAVELED
IN PLACES

1747
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:09,774
AND THOSE PLACES
FORM DASHES AND DOTS,

1748
01:00:09,774 --> 01:00:14,645
AND THOSE DOTS SPELL OUT
A MESSAGE IN THE MORSE CODE.

1749
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:17,882
AND THAT MESSAGE IS,
"COURAGE, MOM."

1750
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:21,518
"COURAGE, MOM."
HE GOT THE MESSAGE THROUGH.

1751
01:00:21,518 --> 01:00:23,387
"COURAGE, MOM."

1752
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:25,322
NOT BAD FOR
GOVERNMENT WORK.

1753
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:26,924
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

1754
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:29,159
HAVEN'T HAD THIS
MUCH FUN SINCE LIVE TV.

1755
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,929
TO THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF UNIT 303,

1756
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:34,331
TO MY FELLOW CITIZENS,
I SAY, "COURAGE, MOM."

1757
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:36,934
I HAVE INFORMED
THE ALBANIAN GOVERNMENT

1758
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,335
THAT WE WILL NOT REST

1759
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,204
UNTIL THE SAFE RETURN
OF SERGEANT SCHUMANN.

1760
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:44,408
I'M TOLD HIS UNIT MATES GAVE HIM
THE NICKNAME, "OLD SHOE."

1761
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:48,679
WASN'T THERE AN FOLK
SONG CALLED "OLD SHOE?"

1762
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:51,782
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
SOMETHING LIKE...

1763
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:54,819
I DON'T KNOW. I CAN
VAGUELY REMEMBER IT.

1764
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:59,223
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT? OLD SHOE?

1765
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:01,058
President: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

1766
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,127
GOOD NIGHT
AND GOD BLESS.

1767
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:04,929
TRUMP THAT,
SENATOR NEAL,

1768
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:07,497
YOU HOWDY-DOODY-
LOOKING VONTZ.

1769
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,701
AS WE REPORTED EARLIER, U.S.
SERVICEMAN WILLIE SCHUMANN

1770
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,502
REMAINS MISSING BEHIND
ENEMY LINES...

1771
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,839
IT'S ALL
THINKING AHEAD.

1772
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:16,440
THAT'S WHAT
PRODUCING IS.

1773
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,842
IT'S LIKE
BEING A PLUMBER.

1774
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,710
YES. LIKE BEING
A PLUMBER.

1775
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,379
DO YOUR JOB RIGHT,
NOBODY SHOULD NOTICE.

1776
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:23,781
BUT WHEN YOU FUCK UP,

1777
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,115
EVERYTHING GETS
FULL OF SHIT.

1778
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,951
...SYMBOL OF
THE ELITE MILITARY TEAM,

1779
01:01:26,951 --> 01:01:29,954
SERGEANT WILLIAM SCHUMANN,
THE "OLD SHOE."

1780
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:31,555
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
LINE UP THE PRESIDENT

1781
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:32,723
FOR THE PEACE PRIZE?

1782
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,658
OUR JOB ENDS
ON ELECTION DAY.

1783
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:36,326
OH, YES,
BUT COME ON.

1784
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:39,696
JUST FOR THE SYMMETRY
OF THE THING?

1785
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,831
THAT'S RIGHT.

1786
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:42,532
IF KISSINGER CAN
WIN THE PEACE PRIZE,

1787
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,468
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
TO WAKE UP AND FIND OUT

1788
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:45,970
I'D WON THE PREAKNESS.

1789
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:49,606
YES, BUT OUR GUY
DID BRING PEACE.

1790
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:51,075
YEAH, BUT THERE
WASN'T A WAR.

1791
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:54,044
ALL THE GREATER
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

1792
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:13,297
WHERE'S THE, UH,
WHERE'S THE MONEY--

1793
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:16,166
WHERE'S THE TIE-IN WITH
THE THROWING AWAY OF OLD SHOES?

1794
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,002
WHO STEPS UP AND
PAYS YOU FOR THAT?

1795
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:20,437
YOU THROW AWAY OLD SHOES.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

1796
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:21,839
BUY NEW ONES.

1797
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,041
WE HAVE SOME VERY
POWERFUL NEW FRIENDS

1798
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:27,044
IN THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF SHOE MANUFACTURERS.

1799
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,813
YOU GUYS
SURE GET AROUND.

1800
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:31,148
FAD KING IS MY HERO.
WANT TO GO FIRST?

1801
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:32,783
SURE.

1802
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:35,485
ATTA-BOY.

1803
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,221
HISTORY, CONNIE.

1804
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,624
THOSE ARE RATTY SHOES.

1805
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:42,827
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
FLINGING THEM AWAY.

1806
01:02:42,827 --> 01:02:45,863
YOU WANT TO TRY
SOME? GO AHEAD.

1807
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,597
ATTA-BOY.

1808
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,533
HERE,
DO IT AGAIN.

1809
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:51,335
GO AHEAD.
HAVE A BALL.

1810
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,874
OK, WATCH THIS.
YAAH!

1811
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:01,778
HA HA HA! GO ON,
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

1812
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:05,983
DJ on radio:
WELL, THIS IS INTERESTING.

1813
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:09,887
I HAVE JUST BEEN HANDED THIS.
SOMETHING JUST DISCOVERED.

1814
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:13,690
A 1930s RECORDING, PART OF
THE FOLK SONG COLLECTION

1815
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,125
OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,

1816
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,662
AND A FITTING SONG,
IF I MAY SAY SO, ABOUT SHOE.

1817
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:20,664
SCHUMANN
IS THE MILITARY SOLDIER

1818
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:22,466
WHO'S BEEN LEFT BEHIND
ENEMY LINES...

1819
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:30,340
* I WISHED I HAD A WOMAN *

1820
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,642
Reporter: JIM, CAN I
GET A WORD WITH YOU?

1821
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,778
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT
ON THE SITUATION IN ALBANIA?

1822
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:38,916
YES, THERE IS ONE THING
I'D LIKE TO SAY.

1823
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,617
THIS IS TO THE ALBANIANS

1824
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,352
THAT HAVE THIS MAN
IN CUSTODY.

1825
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,554
I MEAN THIS FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

1826
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,123
AS ONE OF YOUR RACE.

1827
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:49,126
[SPEAKING ALBANIAN]

1828
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:51,828
I DIDN'T KNOW JIM BELUSHI
WAS ALBANIAN.

1829
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,265
* JUST LIKE
THAT GOOD OL' SHOE *

1830
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:56,533
HEY.

1831
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:59,736
Reporter: AND THE SEARCH FOR
WILLIE SCHUMANN CONTINUES...

1832
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:02,472
* GOOD OL' SHOE *

1833
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:04,308
* GOOD OL' SHOE *

1834
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:07,144
* WHATEVER ROAD
YOU'RE WALKIN' *

1835
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:10,447

01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:13,517

1840
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,160
* AND YOU MIGHT EVEN
GET TO HEAVEN *

1841
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,729
* WITH A SOUL LIKE THAT *

1842
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:28,465
* GOOD OL' SHOE *

1843
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,069
AS SOON AS WE LAND,
I WANT A REFLEXOLOGIST.

1844
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:33,437
MALE OR FEMALE?

1845
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:34,771
THE WHITE HOUSE
WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT

1846
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:35,973
THE CONGRESSIONAL
MEDAL OF HONOR.

1847
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:36,974
WHAT ABOUT IT?

1848
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:38,075
FOR SCHUMANN.

1849
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:40,477
WAIT A MINUTE.
WE GOT 86% IN FAVOR.

1850
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:43,747
WE BRING HIM BACK TOMORROW.
CHARTS DON'T GO DOWN.

1851
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,449
I DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM
HOW TO DO THEIR BUSINESS,

1852
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:47,051
BUT WHY DON'T THEY DO IT
AFTER THE ELECTION?

1853
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,253
MAKES MORE SENSE,
AND IT'LL HELP HIM MORE.

1854
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:51,321
WHEN ARE YOU
BRINGING HIM BACK?

1855
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,523
KING, SHOW HIM
THE THING.

1856
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:54,558
IT'S NOT DONE YET.

1857
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,226
SHOW IT TO HIM.

1858
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,828
TALK ABOUT ENLARGING
THE MARKET. TELL HIM.

1859
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,130
SHOW HIM.

1860
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,666
HERE IT IS. ARTIST'S
RENDERING OF THE MEMORIAL.

1861
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:03,833
Brean: THE MEMORIAL?

1862
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,370
THAT'S THE MEMORIAL
OF THE FALLEN.

1863
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,904
OF THE ALBANIAN
CAMPAIGN.

1864
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:08,905
LOVELY.

1865
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,207
IT'S BETTER THAN LOVELY.

1866
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:12,042
THIS GUY MADE A DEAL
WITH GOVERNOR KNEEHIGH--

1867
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:13,843
SENATOR LEAHY.

1868
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,079
YOU OUGHT TO SEE
HOW MUCH GRANITE

1869
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:16,313
YOU HAVE TO PUT
IN THIS THING.

1870
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:18,282
GOT A SITE PICKED OUT
AND EVERYTHING.

1871
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:20,284
AND THE BEAUTY PART IS,

1872
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:22,452
GUESS WHO RETAINS THE
MERCHANDISING RIGHTS?

1873
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:23,988
SHOW HIM THE CLOCK?

1874
01:05:23,988 --> 01:05:25,855
LOOK AT THIS.
GOT IT AS A CLOCK.

1875
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,591
LOVELY, LOVELY.

1876
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:28,392
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

1877
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:29,759
WHEN'S SCHUMANN
COMING BACK?

1878
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:30,995
GETTING HIM
RIGHT NOW.

1879
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:32,129
I NEED
HIS NECK SIZE.

1880
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:33,597
YOU'RE GONNA GET
HIS NECK SIZE.

1881
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:34,831
I THINK
IT'S 17 1/2.

1882
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:37,001
Liz: THINKING
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1883
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:39,536
I'M AN ARTIST, NOT
A FACTORY WORKER.

1884
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,871
WHAT DID HE EAT
BEHIND ENEMY LINES?

1885
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,373
BIRDS, SNAKES.

1886
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:46,376
BULLSHIT. HE ATE TINY
CHEESEBURGERS IN TIN FOIL.

1887
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,911
PULL A STRING,
THEY HEAT THEMSELVES.

1888
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:49,713
WE CALL BURGER KING,
JOHNNY ROCKETS.

1889
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:52,316
WE GET THE SHOE BURGER
WITH CHEESE AND 303 SAUCE,

1890
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:54,118
"BEHIND ENEMY LINES
OR ANYTIME."

1891
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:55,119
GOOD, GOOD.

1892
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,553
THAT'S THE SLOGAN.

1893
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,622
AND I GOT THE COPYRIGHT
ON THE ALBANIAN KITTEN THING,

1894
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,024
AND I'M GONNA CALL NIKE,

1895
01:06:00,024 --> 01:06:01,691
GET RODMAN TO DYE HIS HAIR
A LEOPARD SKIN COLOR.

1896
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,727
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SNEAKER--
"AIR LEOPARD."

1897
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,166
TV reporter: ...A HIGH SCHOOL
BASKETBALL GAME LAST NIGHT

1898
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,968
BETWEEN MONTGOMERY BELL
AND BLAIR PARK.

1899
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,370
STUDENTS, DURING THE GAME

1900
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,905
IN SPONTANEOUS MOMENT
OF SHEER PATRIOTISM,

1901
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:19,143
THREW THEIR TENNIS SHOES ON
THE COURT BY THE HUNDREDS.

1902
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:20,610
JUST FOR THE OLD SHOE.

1903
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,447
BRING HIM BACK.
WILLIAM SCHUMANN...

1904
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,449
THERE'S NO BUSINESS
LIKE IT, HUH?

1905
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:28,852
TV: DEMONSTRATIONS ARE POPPING
UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

1906
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,987
AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CONTINUE
TO SHOW THEIR PATRIOTISM.

1907
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,389
YOU OUGHT TO GET THEM

1908
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:34,158
TO RUN THAT
INAUGURAL SPEECH BY ME.

1909
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:36,126
INAUGURAL SPEECH?
I DON'T KNOW.

1910
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:38,628
THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF
WON'T GIVE UP THAT ONE.

1911
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:39,929
COME ON, CONNIE.

1912
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,466
LET ME CLOSE OUT
THE THING IN STYLE.

1913
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:44,568
I'VE COME TO FEEL
IT'S MY THING.

1914
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:47,337
YOU TAKE A JOB,
YOU TAKE A JOB,

1915
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,838
AND MANY TIMES,
IT'S JUST A JOB,

1916
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,174
AND THEN, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1917
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:51,908
HELL OF A RIDE,
STANLEY.

1918
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:53,410
ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT?

1919
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,079
YOU TAKE THE BITTER
WITH THE SWEET

1920
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:56,880
OR THE SWEET
WITH THE BITTER.

1921
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,315
WHAT'S THAT EXPRESSION?

1922
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:04,721
Man in commercial: ...FEELING
GOOD ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

1923
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,890
THAT'S WHY WE'RE VOTING
FOR THE PRESIDENT, ED.

1924
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,092
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1925
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:11,128
WELL, BOB, MY MIND
WASN'T 100% MADE UP,

1926
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:12,529
BUT NOW IT IS.

1927
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:16,466
I SAY, DON'T GO CHANGING
HORSES IN MIDSTREAM.

1928
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:19,503
ABSOLUTELY.

1929
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:22,406
WHO NEEDS SURPRISES
THESE DAYS?

1930
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,074
Announcer: FOR AN ECONOMY
YOU CAN RELY ON...

1931
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:26,776
FUCKING AMATEURS.

1932
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:31,047
PITY OF IT IS, 2 MORE DAYS,
AND WE BRING IT ALL BACK HOME.

1933
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,049
KNOCK WOOD.

1934
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,252
AND WHO'S
GONNA KNOW?

1935
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:37,121
WHO'S GONNA KNOW
WHAT WE DID?

1936
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:38,455
WHO'S GONNA KNOW?

1937
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:40,157
PRIDE OF A JOB
WELL DONE, STAN.

1938
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:42,159
YES, IT'S THE PRIDE OF
A JOB WELL DONE,

1939
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,161
BUT IT'S MORE
THAN THAT, STANLEY.

1940
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:46,763
IT'S THE GRATITUDE
OF YOUR PARTY

1941
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:48,232
AND YOUR PRESIDENT,
RIGHT?

1942
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:49,833
IS THAT THE THING?

1943
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:52,336
INDEED, IT IS.

1944
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:55,004
YEAH. DEAN CITY, OKLAHOMA.

1945
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,640
ARMY SPECIAL PROGRAMS.

1946
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,442
TELL 'EM TO BRING
SCHUMANN TO THE PLANE.

1947
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,877
WE'LL BRING HIM BACK AND
STASH HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.

1948
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:04,181
CALL THE PLANE, TELL ME
WHERE TO PICK HIM UP.

1949
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,883
I BET YOU'RE GOOD
AT CHESS, CONNIE.

1950
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:09,786
I WOULD BE, I COULD REMEMBER
HOW ALL THE PIECES MOVE.

1951
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:12,922
YEAH. OK, SO WE'LL CALL YOU.

1952
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:18,094
Merle Haggard: * I'LL DO
THE SAME IN HIS GREAT NAME *

1953
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,265

1954
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:27,404
* I CAN ALWAYS
FEEL YOUR LOVE *

1955
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:30,574
* SEND AND I'LL RECEIVE *

1956
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:34,878
UNITS OF 303,
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT

1959
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:43,987
FREEING A TIRED BUT HAPPY
WILLIAM SCHUMANN.

1960
01:08:43,987 --> 01:08:45,989
A HIGH WHITE HOUSE SOURCE
CONFIRMS

1961
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:48,992
THAT HE'S EXPECTED IN
WASHINGTON TOMORROW MORNING.

1962
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:50,894
HOW'S THAT?

1963
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:53,129
HELLO? HELLO?

1964
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,299

1966
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,670
BIG BIRD IS GONNA MEET
SCHUMANN AT THE AIRPORT, HUH?

1967
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,806
BIG MISTAKE. YOU GOT TO
BRING HIM IN BY STAGES.

1968
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,008
BIG MISTAKE
TO REVEAL SCHUMANN

1969
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:06,610
BEFORE THE ELECTION.

1970
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:07,577
HOW SO?

1971
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:10,347
SWEETHEART, SCHUMANN
IS THE SHARK.

1972
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:12,349
SCHUMANN IS JAWS,
YOU KNOW?

1973
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:14,684
YOU HAVE TO TEASE 'EM.
YOU GOTTA TEASE 'EM.

1974
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:18,188
YOU DON'T PUT JAWS IN
THE FIRST REEL OF THE MOVIE.

1975
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:19,623
IT'S THE CONTRACT,
SWEETHEART.

1976
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:21,358
THE CONTRACT
WITH THE ELECTION,

1977
01:09:21,358 --> 01:09:23,059
WHETHER THEY KNOW IT
OR NOT,

1978
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,061
IS VOTE FOR ME TUESDAY,

1979
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:27,297
WEDNESDAY I WILL
PRODUCE SCHUMANN.

1980
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:29,433
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
PAYING 7 BUCKS FOR.

1981
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:31,134
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1982
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,969
WHATEVER.

1983
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,371
EVERYBODY'S GOTTA LEARN.

1984
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,872
YEAH.
ANY BUSINESS.

1985
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,975
YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE
THE FRUIT OF 40 YEARS,

1986
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:41,778
HARD LESSONS, MISTAKES,
AND YOU CALL IT WISDOM.

1987
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:42,846
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

1988
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:45,282
END OF THE DAY, JUST
WHEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING,

1989
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:46,750
TIME TO GO HOME.

1990
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,185
STANLEY, YOU GOT
DECADES IN YOU NOW.

1991
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,321
YOU GOT DECADES
LEFT IN YOU.

1992
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:54,558
YEAH, BUT...

1993
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:57,794
WHAT COULD I DO
TO TOP THIS?

1994
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:01,531
* THE 37th PSALM *

1995
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:06,336
* I'LL DO THE SAME
IN HIS GREAT NAME *

1996
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:09,205
* IF YOU HAVE COURAGE,
MOM *

1997
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,474
YOU SEE HER?
MM-HMM.

1998
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:12,075
THAT WAS REAL TEARS.

1999
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:14,344
WE WERE GONNA
GIVE HER THOSE DROPS.

2000
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,312
SHE CRIED.

2001
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:16,313
REALLY?

2002
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:17,914
SHE CRIED REAL.

2003
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:18,915
IT LOOKS IT.

2004
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,285
* PRAY FOR ME *

2005
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:23,587
* AND THE U.S.A. *

2006
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:27,291
* PRAY THEY NEVER
USE THE BOMB *

2007
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:28,725
* AND I'LL
DO THE SAME... *

2008
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,860
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO AFTER THIS?

2009
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,596
THEY OWE YOU BIG, STAN.
OWE YOU BIG.

2010
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:35,198
AMBASSADOR TO THIS OR THAT,
WHATEVER.

2011
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:36,600
AMBASSADOR TO WHAT?

2012
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,702
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
TO GO TO BRENTWOOD.

2013
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,172
AH, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

2014
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,574
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S MY REWARD.

2015
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:45,809
THAT'S THE PAYOFF.

2016
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:48,278
YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE INAUGURAL?

2017
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:51,247
MIGHT IF I WAS ASKED.

2018
01:11:11,535 --> 01:11:15,539
YOU KNOW, CONNIE,

01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,276
THIS IS IT.

2021
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,680
Reporter:
I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF

2024
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:29,052
SIMPLY AS THE OLD SHOE...

2025
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:31,154
THIS IS GONNA BE
A MASTERPIECE.

2026
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:32,822
GIVING THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.

2027
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:36,526
...HIS GROUP 303 AND LEFT

LET'S GO.
COME ON.

2207
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,201
WHERE?!

2208
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,603
WE GOT WORK TO DO,
WINIFRED.

2209
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:02,005
COME ON, PAL.

2210
01:19:02,005 --> 01:19:03,406
IS IT TIME FOR EXERCISE?

2211
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:05,608
'CAUSE I KNOW IT'S
MY DAY IN THE YARD.

2212
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,243
LET'S GET HIM OUT
TO THE HIGHWAY.

2213
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,779
THINK THIS IS TOUGH?
COME ON, PAL!

2214
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:12,081
THIS IS NOTHING!
PIECE OF CAKE!

2215
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,682
Ames:
ALBANIAN DISSIDENTS,

2216
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,786
HAVING SOMEHOW OBTAINED
A SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE TODAY,

2217
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:19,188
Motss: YOU HAD YOUR
FORTUNE RIGHT HERE,

2218
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:21,157
AND YOU WERE READY
TO THROW IT AWAY.

2219
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:23,526
IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM,
SOLVE IT.

2220
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:24,828
THAT'S PRODUCING.

2221
01:19:24,828 --> 01:19:27,897
I TELL YOU, SOMEDAY WHEN
THEY TELL THIS STORY--

2222
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:29,498
YOU CAN'T TELL
THIS STORY.

2223
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:30,633
WHY NOT?

2224
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:31,901
SOMEBODY WOULD
HAVE YOU KILLED.

2225
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:34,270
NO, NO.
OF COURSE, I KNOW.

2226
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:38,141
NOT NOW. BUT WHEN
THEY DO TELL THE STORY--

2227
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:41,310
NOBODY CAN TELL
THIS STORY. EVER.

2228
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:46,515
LISTEN TO ME. THIS IS
WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

2229
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,052
YOU CAN'T TELL THIS STORY.
HE'S NOT KIDDING YOU.

2230
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:51,187
YOU CAN'T TELL THIS STORY.
YOU KNEW THAT.

2231
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:52,922
THE DEAL WAS YOU GET
AN AMBASSADORSHIP.

2232
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:54,190
NO, NO, NO.

2233
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,792
I USED TO HAVE
A CAMARO.

2234
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,594
WHAT THE FUCK STORY
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL?

2235
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,096
THE GUY'S A NUT CASE.

2236
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:01,697
YOU WOULD BE TOO IF YOU WENT
THROUGH WHAT HE WENT THROUGH.

2237
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:03,099
HE RAPED A NUN.

2238
01:20:03,099 --> 01:20:04,667
WHAT HE WENT THROUGH
IN ALBANIA.

2239
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:05,801
HE'S DOPED
TO THE GILLS.

2240
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,403
WHERE'S MY
LITTLE PILLS?

2241
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:08,537
SHOW SOME COMPASSION.

2242
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:12,341
HE SPENT THE LAST 12 YEARS
IN A MILITARY PRISON.

2243
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:13,943
YEAH. HOW ARE WE
GONNA EXPLAIN THAT?

2244
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:15,311
EXPLAIN IT?
AM I WORRIED?

2245
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,246
HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THAT
WHEN THE WORLD IS WATCHING?

2246
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,648
FUCK THE WORLD.
TRY A 10 A.M. PITCH MEETING

2247
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,251
COKED TO THE GILLS AND YOU
HAVEN'T READ THE TREATMENT.

2248
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:24,720
HOW DO WE EXPLAIN
HE WAS IN PRISON?

2249
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,890
HOW?
WELL, YOU SEE, WINIFRED,

2250
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:29,158
THIS IS WHERE YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN AT A PITCH.

2251
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,560
HIS RECORDS SAY
HE WAS IN PRISON

2252
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,463
AS THEY SAY FOR ALL THE MEN
AND WOMEN OF GROUP 303

2253
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:38,301
AS THEY MUST BECAUSE OF
THE SECRECY INVOLVED.

2254
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:56,920
Brean:
I'M ON TOP OF IT.

2255
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,922
Motss: NOT SURE
WHETHER ENEMY ACTION...

2256
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,389
I'M FINE, I'M FINE.
I GOT IT.

2257
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:04,760
STANLEY, I TOLD YOU,
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

2258
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,295
YOU DO WHAT
FOR A LIVING?

2259
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:08,031
EXACTLY WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR THE PRESIDENT?

2260
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,599
I LOST MY WALLET.
YOU GOT ANY CHANGE.

2261
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,600
YEAH.

2262
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,601
THANKS, PAL.

2263
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:14,103
HOW WE DOING, BOY?

2264
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:15,738
I'M OK.
READY TO MIX IT UP?

2265
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:17,640
IS TODAY LAUNDRY DAY?

2266
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,575
WHAT DO YOU DO
ON LAUNDRY DAY?

2267
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:20,576
LAUNDRY.

2268
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:23,479
STAND BY TO COPY THIS.
JUST GET A PENCIL.

2269
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,880
DOWN SAFELY...

2270
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,815
PRODUCE THIS SCHUMANN.

2271
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:30,286
PRODUCE HIM I SAY, OR, AND I
DON'T HESITATE TO SAY THIS,

2272
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:34,623
RANK HIM AS JUST ANOTHER IN
A SERIES OF BROKEN PROMISES.

2273
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,092
SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES.

2274
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:38,394
FLIGHT CREW BEING INVESTIGATED
FOR POSSIBLE PILOT ERROR.

2275
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,396
TRANSSHIPPED TO AN
UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.

2276
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:42,031
BLAH BLAH BLAH,
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

2277
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:43,432
Reporter:
THIS DESERTED RUNWAY

2278
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:45,501
SHOULD BE FILLED
WITH WELL-WISHERS...

2279
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:46,602
HOW YOU DOING?

2280
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:47,603
YEAH?

2281
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:48,837
A COLD DRINK?

2282
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:52,175
Reporter: SCHUMANN WAS TO RETURN
TO AMERICAN SOIL TODAY

2283
01:21:52,175 --> 01:21:54,110
AFTER HIS SAFE RESCUE
IN ALBANIA.

2284
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:57,513
HE LOOKS LIKE ME.

2285
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:00,583
...DESERVES AN EXPLANATION
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

2286
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:04,753
UH, WAIT, WE ARE NOW GOING
LIVE TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

2287
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,356
Levy: I HAVE AN UPDATE
REGARDING THE AIRCRAFT INCIDENT

2288
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,125
INVOLVING SERGEANT SCHUMANN.

2289
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:11,727
HE IS DOWN SAFELY
AND WILL BE TRANSSHIPPED.

2290
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:14,563
WE ARE INFORMED HE HAS
SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES

2291
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:16,465
WHICH WILL REQUIRE HIS BEING
MEDICATED FOR SOME TIME...

2292
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:19,402
BRING IN THE CAVALRY.
NICK OF TIME.

2293
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:21,137
[SIGHS] YEAH?

2294
01:22:21,137 --> 01:22:22,938
POLITICAL SHITBIRDS.
FUCK WITH US, HUH?

2295
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,707
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO
THEY'RE PLAYING WITH.

2296
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,414
PURTY.

2297
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:34,783
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE DRIVER OF THE RIG.

2298
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,419
WHAT RIG?
THE HARVESTER.

2299
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:37,286
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

2300
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,988
HE DOESN'T HAVE
HIS GREEN CARD.

2301
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:40,723
HE DOESN'T HAVE
HIS GREEN CARD.

2302
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:43,459
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A GREEN CARD.

2303
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,394
Motss: SO WHAT?

2304
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:49,132
SO? YOU WANT SCHUMANN TO BE
RESCUED BY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN?

2305
01:22:49,132 --> 01:22:52,201
WE CAN'T HAVE SCHUMANN SAVED
BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.

2306
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:54,203
GET ON THE PHONE.
FLY IN A JUDGE.

2307
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:57,473
GET ON THE PHONE. WHAT'S
ALL THIS MOPING ABOUT?

2308
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,747

01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,282

01:24:30,032 --> 01:24:31,334
WELL, WE WERE THIS CLOSE.
