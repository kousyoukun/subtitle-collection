1
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,890
Another great race today,
Johnny.

2
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,293
Who are you gonna
ride in the Stakes?

3
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,957
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

4
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,523
and I live by it...

5
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,866
``Never change horses
in midstream.``

6
00:00:56,903 --> 00:01:01,272
Never change horses.
Sounds like a smart bet.

7
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,573
Always stick with a winner.

8
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,139
Keep America working.

9
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,040
Don`t change horses
in midstream.

10
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:13,848
On election day,
reelect the president.

11
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,667
Can you step this way,
Mr. Brean?

12
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,501
Lift your arms, please.

13
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:37,037
That`s him.
That`s Mr. Fix-it.

14
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,682
It`s right here.

15
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:06,794
You have a seat here, Connie.

16
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,824
He doesn`t know anything.

17
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,204
John Levy`s staff,
his assistant...

18
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,302
and Amy Cain, Press.

19
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:26,381
Thank you.
That`II be aII.

20
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,785
-Want some coffee?
-BIack, pIease.

21
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:31,484
Gaviston, bring some coffee.
BIack.

22
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:36,451
You kids in this room...

23
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,623
what you hear and say here...

24
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,327
if it gets out, you Ieaked it.

25
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,630
TeII them
what they need to know.

26
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,695
When it broke, the president
said, ``Get me Conrad Brean.``

27
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:49,903
What`s the thing?

28
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:53,140
He had an iIIegaI immigrant
nanny years back?

29
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,808
You get ahead in the poIIs,
suddenIy you get nervous.

30
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,251
He made a pass
at some secretary years ago?

31
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:02,881
A group of FirefIy GirIs
were here Iast month.

32
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:05,414
One expressed interest
in a Frederic Remington bust.

33
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,291
They went in the office
behind the OvaI Office.

34
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,888
It couIdn`t have
been over three minutes.

35
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,990
The Secret Service
wiII confirm that.

36
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,398
It`s not the iIIegaI
immigrant nanny thing?

37
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,531
The girI`s aIIeging...

38
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,203
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

39
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:27,907
Maybe we couId say it was
a drug reaction to the fIu.

40
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,245
Who`s got the story?

41
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,772
Don`t you want to know
if it`s true?

42
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:32,148
What`s the difference?

43
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,619
It`s a story.
They`II run with it.

44
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,087
How Iong tiII it breaks?

45
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,113
Front page,
Washington Post, tomorrow.

46
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,353
That`s not good.

47
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:43,487
-Where is he?
-China.

48
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,395
When is he due back?

49
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,230
They`re set to Ieave soon.

50
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:53,702
He stays on the ground
in China at Ieast another day.

51
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,674
Why?

52
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,199
You the Press Office?

53
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:58,904
Earn your money.
He`s iII.

54
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:00,378
When do we bring him back?

55
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:03,075
I`m gonna need a day.

56
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,084
He`s sick.
Get that out now.

57
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,245
TeII the jackaIs how sick he is.

58
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,279
We gotta get that out
before the story breaks.

59
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:12,655
Issue a buIIetin.
He`s got some rare strain--

60
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,559
-Won`t hoId.
-I need running time.

61
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:16,892
It won`t hoId a day.

62
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,659
It wiII.
I`II teII you why.

63
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,165
Why is the president in China?

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,498
-Trade reIations.
-You`re right.

65
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,833
It`s got nothing to do
with the B-3 bomber.

66
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:28,500
-There is no B-3 bomber.
-I just said that.

67
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,009
I don`t know why
these rumors get started.

68
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,279
I need $20,000.
I need a car.

69
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:37,180
Get me a car and driver.

70
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:38,844
The southwest gate.

71
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:42,584
What?

72
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,987
What is it?

73
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,425
Campaign commerciaI.
ShouId we Iook at it?

74
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,429
Put it in.
This shouId be interesting.

75
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,863
What is it?

76
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,867
The other side`s new commerciaI.

77
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,129
The NeaI commerciaI.

78
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,137
We had somebody steaI it.

79
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:01,038
This`II be on the air
the day after tomorrow.

80
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,907
In the final days
of the campaign...

81
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,843
has the president
changed his tune?

82
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,178
Thank heaven for little girls.

83
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:11,547
The presidency is about honor.

84
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:15,042
Thank heaven for little girls.

85
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,783
It`s about principles.

86
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:20,156
Without them,
what would little boys do?

87
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,753
It`s about integrity.

88
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:24,923
This tune has got to change.

89
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:30,027
On election day,
vote Neal for president.

90
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,334
Oh, boy.

91
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:35,864
Who`s gonna take
the press conference today?

92
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,843
Is there a press conference
today?

93
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,174
What do you think?

94
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:42,079
We have to use this
as a base of operations.

95
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:44,208
I`m gonna need one, two days.

96
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,242
Whoever`s Ieaking that stuff
to the Post Iets it sIip...

97
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,313
``I hope this won`t
screw up the B-3 program.``

98
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:53,689
``What B-3 program,
and why shouId it screw it up?``

99
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,888
``If the president
depIoys the B-3...

100
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,920
before it`s fuIIy tested...``

101
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,398
``DepIoy the B-3
before it`s fuIIy tested?``

102
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,526
``Why?``

103
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:03,968
``The crisis.``

104
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,597
-What crisis?
-I`m working on that.

105
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,539
Get GeneraI Scott
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

106
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:12,408
and put them
on a pIane to SeattIe.

107
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:14,413
He`s nervous to taIk
to the Boeing peopIe.

108
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:16,975
But what?

109
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,574
There isn`t a B-3 bomber.

110
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,245
-Where`d you go to schooI?
-Dartmouth.

111
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,652
Then show a IittIe spunk.
There is no B-3 bomber.

112
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,122
GeneraI Scott,
to your knowIedge...

113
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:25,920
is not in SeattIe
to taIk to Boeing.

114
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,256
It won`t prove out.

115
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,694
It doesn`t have to prove out.
We just gotta distract them.

116
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,288
Got Iess than two weeks
tiII the eIection.

117
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:35,495
What in the worId wouId do that?

118
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:36,729
I`m working on it.

119
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,242
Winifred, Mr. Brean.

120
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:47,643
-What`s this?
-$20,000.

121
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,740
I gotta go to L.A.
and see a HoIIywood producer.

122
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:52,752
Meet me at NationaI in an hour.

123
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,913
We`II go to Chicago
and connect there to L.A.

124
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:56,478
See you at NationaI.

125
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,592
TeII me this again.

126
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,964
We Ianding?

127
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:10,826
TeII me again.

128
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,236
Don`t worry.
It`s nothing new.

129
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:17,300
During Reagan`s administration,
240 Marines kiIIed in Beirut.

130
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:19,208
24 hours Iater,
we invade Grenada.

131
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,644
That was their M.O.

132
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,045
Change the story,
change the Iead.

133
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,639
It`s not a new concept.

134
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,651
Wake me when we Iand.
We`II taIk more.

135
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:27,949
Wait.
We can`t afford a war.

136
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:29,978
We`re not having a war.

137
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,581
We`re having
the appearance of a war.

138
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,216
We cannot afford it.

139
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,194
-What`II it cost?
-But they wouId find out.

140
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,197
Who`s gonna find out?
The American peopIe?

141
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,222
Who`s gonna teII them?

142
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,895
What did they find out
about the GuIf War?

143
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,497
One video of one bomb
faIIs down a chimney.

144
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,234
The buiIding couId have been
made out of Legos.

145
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,334
-You want us to go to war?
-That`s the generaI idea.

146
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,741
With who?

147
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,373
I`m working on it.

148
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,012
AIbania?

149
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:03,181
Why?

150
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,418
Why not?
What do you know about them?

151
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,688
-Nothing.
-PreciseIy.

152
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,457
They seem shifty, standoffish.

153
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,727
Who knows from AIbania?
Who trusts AIbanians?

154
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,700
What did AIbania ever do to us?

155
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,793
What did they do for us?

156
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:19,703
This is why we have to
mobiIize the B-3 bomber.

157
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,639
You reaIIy want to go
to war with AIbania?

158
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:24,905
We don`t have a choice.
This is what you do.

159
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,310
Get your press office
right now to deny it.

160
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:28,644
It didn`t happen.

161
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,479
``There is no report
of AIbanian activity.``

162
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,041
They have to deny it.

163
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:36,021
-It didn`t happen.
-Deny.

164
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,922
...news from the president
on his visit to China.

165
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,687
Another sort of news, however...

166
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,490
has emerged
from the presidential quarter.

167
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:45,520
We turn to Melissa Gardner
at KZAB in Santa Fe...

168
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:46,759
with this breaking news.

169
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:50,432
Thanks, Richard.
Today a local Firefly Girl...

170
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,234
accused the president
of sexual misconduct.

171
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:55,537
This photo of the president
with the girls...

172
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,635
was taken during their tour
of the White House.

173
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:00,703
The girl claims
that the sexual misconduct...

174
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,307
occurred inside the Oval Office.

175
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,408
Her attorney says
there are no plans yet...

176
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:06,850
to hold a press conference.

177
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,548
Folks in Santa Fe
and the rest of America...

178
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,750
are waiting for a response
from the White House...

179
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,850
on these harsh allegations.

180
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:17,624
With the election days away,
the big question is...

181
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,895
how much will this scandal
affect the outcome?

182
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,231
Top peopIe, AIbanian desk.

183
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:25,032
I don`t know, either,
but we probabIy have one.

184
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:27,062
Roust them out of bed.

185
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:29,802
AIbanian desk, CIA, NSA.
Roust them, sirens bIaring.

186
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:31,969
I know they`re gonna be up
in an hour.

187
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,036
I want them up now.
TeII your staff...

188
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,377
GeneraI Scott in SeattIe?

189
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:39,852
I don`t think his trip
has to do with the B-3 bomber.

190
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,184
I`II have to ask you
to turn that off.

191
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:44,189
It`II just be a second.

192
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,157
There are no eIectronics
on the pIane.

193
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,319
I have to ask you
to turn that off.

194
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,794
It`II just take two seconds.

195
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,662
We`ve said fIat out
there is no B-3 bomber.

196
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,496
I understand.

197
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,992
If it is true, he should,
he must step down...

198
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,370
and if it`s not true,
then he must...

199
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:04,501
We are informed he has extended
his visit to China.

200
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,672
I say on behalf of
the American people, come home.

201
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:10,581
Face the music,
whatever that may be.

202
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,106
The election`s in 1 1 days.

203
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,346
Let the American people decide.

204
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,854
``Let the American people
decide.``

205
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,686
Senator Neal,
presidential candidate.

206
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,283
Excuse me, Senator...

207
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,260
That`s 1 1 days
till the election...

208
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,855
and the president
ahead in the polls by--Bob?

209
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:26,330
Seventeen percent.

210
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:30,427
Accusations have surfaced which
could affect the outcome...

211
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,835
The White House has announced...

212
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,634
in response
to the media pressure...

213
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,470
there will be
a press conference.

214
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,738
This is how
a HoIIywood producer Iives?

215
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,302
This is bigger
than the White House.

216
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:44,981
Get me my veggie shake...

217
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:47,452
and remind me
to turn over in 10 minutes...

218
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,887
to tan the other side.

219
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,720
Do I know you?

220
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,250
We have mutuaI friends
in Washington.

221
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:58,695
Yes, as you said,
and is it true?

222
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,722
Mr. Motss, I wouIdn`t--

223
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,565
You wouIdn`t be here
if it wasn`t true.

224
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:07,369
ReaIIy, who couId say?

225
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,001
I Iike the guy.
He signed his book to me...

226
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:13,171
``For two generations--``
What was it?

227
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:15,874
``For progress to occur,``
I think he said.

228
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:18,975
Two Generations to Agree, yes.

229
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,009
That`s what he inscribed.
How`d you know that?

230
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,385
That`s the titIe of the book.

231
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:23,753
That`s the titIe?

232
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:28,053
For Progress to Occur
It`s Necessary for Two--

233
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,527
That`s a terribIe titIe.

234
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:34,392
You`re right.

235
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:37,301
For Two Generations to Agree.
That is the titIe.

236
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:38,963
I never Iooked at the cover.

237
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:39,972
I just Iooked
at what he wrote to me.

238
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,201
When you get the time,
read the cover.

239
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:45,540
John Levy is expected to respond
to the allegations...

240
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,239
of sexual misconduct
by the president.

241
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,006
This guy is fucked.

242
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:57,345
What one has to do, Mr. Motss,
is fight a hoIding action.

243
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,120
They`II run this man
through the shredder.

244
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,060
If we hoId the break
in the dam tiII the eIection...

245
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,427
we got a chance.

246
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,762
You can`t hoId the dam.

247
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,029
I don`t get
what you want me to do.

248
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:14,803
...advised him to stay
in China for one or two days.

249
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,776
During that time,
of course, we`ll remain--

250
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,778
But he`s gotta
come back sometime.

251
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,677
What is one or two days
gonna buy you?

252
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,341
Look at aII those hands.

253
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:25,043
Brer Rabbit
couIdn`t get out of this.

254
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,382
Would you comment please
on the rumors...

255
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,446
that the president`s delay...

256
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,583
is due to the situation
in Albania?

257
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,086
There is...

258
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,597
I`m not aware of the situation
to which you refer.

259
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,622
We`vejust learned
that the State Department...

260
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,102
has set up a special Albanian
task force at Ops Center.

261
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:48,369
Mr. Sklansky, I am--We have--
Mrs. Rose?

262
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:52,275
Early this morning,
General Scott flew to Seattle.

263
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:55,508
Is his trip connected
with the B-3 bomber?

264
00:13:55,548 --> 00:14:00,542
To the best of my knowledge,
there is no B-3 bomber.

265
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:03,612
Mr. Levy, is the situation
in Albania related...

266
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,147
to the Muslim fundamentalist
anti-American uprising?

267
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,854
Now they get it.

268
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,921
There you go.
There`s a IittIe heIp.

269
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:15,730
...that have
fundamentalist movements...

270
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:17,861
How cIose are you to this?

271
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,769
What do you want the kid to say?

272
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:26,374
We will keep you apprised
of any new information.

273
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:29,973
At this time,
there is no information...

274
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,951
Have him say...

275
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,920
I know we`re aII concerned
for the president.

276
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:40,119
I`m sure that our hopes
and prayers are with him.

277
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,059
CouId you have Levy say...

278
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:44,085
``I know we`re aII concerned
for the president.

279
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,597
I`m sure our hopes
and prayers are with him.``

280
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,936
I want to say I know we are all
concerned for the president...

281
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,440
and our hopes and prayers
are with him.

282
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:56,702
He didn`t phrase it right.

283
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,266
He didn`t seII the Iine.

284
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:04,746
You bought yourseIf one day,
maybe two.

285
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,275
AII I need
is 11 tiII the eIection.

286
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,720
This isn`t gonna hoId
for 11 days.

287
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:11,882
-The guy fucked a GirI Scout.
-A FirefIy GirI.

288
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:14,154
He fucked a FirefIy GirI.

289
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,559
What are you gonna do
to hoId that off?

290
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,291
I`m gonna get my veggie shake.

291
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,764
What do you think
wouId hoId it off?

292
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,959
Nothing.

293
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,428
You`d have to have a war.

294
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,709
You`re kidding.
You`re not kidding.

295
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,684
I`m in show business.
Why come to me?

296
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:42,181
I`II teII you why.

297
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,917
``54, 40, or fight.``
What does that mean?

298
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,948
-It`s a sIogan.
-``Remember the Maine.``

299
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:49,794
``Tippecanoe and TyIer, too.``

300
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,763
They`re war sIogans.

301
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,323
We remember the sIogans,
not the wars.

302
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,733
You know why?

303
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,737
That`s show business.
That`s why we`re here.

304
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,001
Naked girI, covered in napaIm.

305
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,371
``V`` for victory.

306
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:05,468
5 Marines raising the fIag,
Mount Surabachi.

307
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:08,873
You remember the picture
in 50 years, but forget the war.

308
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:11,644
The GuIf War, smart bomb
faIIing down a chimney.

309
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,879
2,500 missions a day, 100 days.

310
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,183
One video of one bomb.

311
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,951
The American peopIe
bought that war.

312
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,959
War is show business.
That`s why we`re here.

313
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:23,587
What do you do
for the president?

314
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,163
Why AIbania?

315
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,825
Why not?

316
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,562
They gotta know at some point.

317
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,762
Who?

318
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,673
The pubIic.

319
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,175
They gotta know?

320
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,234
Get with it.
Who kiIIed Kennedy?

321
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,439
I read the first draft
of the Warren Report.

322
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,607
Says he was kiIIed
by a drunk driver.

323
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,913
The GuIf War.
What do you see day after day?

324
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,010
The one smart bomb
faIIing down a chimney.

325
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:49,316
The truth?

326
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:51,585
I was in the buiIding
when we shot that shot.

327
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,592
We shot it in a studio
in FaIIs Church, Virginia.

328
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,991
1l10 scaIe modeI of a buiIding.

329
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,255
Is that true?

330
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:58,263
How do we know?
You take my point?

331
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,958
AII right.

332
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,365
You want me to do what?

333
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,766
To produce.

334
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:06,397
You want me to produce your war?

335
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,304
Not a war.
It`s a pageant.

336
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:10,901
We need a theme,
a song, some visuaIs.

337
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:12,342
It`s a pageant.

338
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,437
It`s Iike the Oscars.
That`s why we came to you.

339
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,175
I never won an Oscar.

340
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,547
That`s a shame,
but you produced the Oscars.

341
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:20,211
Indeed, I did.

342
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,584
You`re a writer,
that`s your script.

343
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,885
You`re a director,
but if you`re the producer...

344
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,552
nobody knows what you do.

345
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:29,458
The producer,
aII he`s got is the credit.

346
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,929
You see?
And some pIaques on the waII.

347
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,899
They don`t know what we do.
Don`t get me started.

348
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,766
If you never won an Oscar...

349
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,395
how wouId you Iike
an ambassadorship?

350
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,236
An ambassadorship?
That`s my payoff?

351
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:43,901
TeII me what you want.

352
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:46,741
I`d just do it
for a story to teII.

353
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,212
You couIdn`t teII anybody.

354
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:50,408
I`m just kidding.

355
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:53,043
-You couIdn`t teII anybody.
-Just a figure of speech.

356
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,451
It`s a pageant.

357
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:56,716
That`s what it is.

358
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,018
The country`s at war.

359
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,285
It`s Miss America.
You`re Bert Parks.

360
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,156
-Why AIbania?
-Because.

361
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,753
What do we have
that they want?

362
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,787
-Freedom.
-Why wouId they want that?

363
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:09,232
-Oppressed?
-Fuck freedom.

364
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,533
They want to destroy
the godIess Satan.

365
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,766
They want to destroy
our way of Iife.

366
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:16,069
AII right?

367
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:19,236
The president is in China.

368
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:22,247
He is deaIing with the dispatch
of the B-3 bomber to AIbania.

369
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:25,477
Why?

370
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:28,210
Why? HeIp me.

371
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:33,184
Geo-poIiticaIIy...

372
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,256
We found out they have the bomb.

373
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,534
-That`s good.
-And...wait a second.

374
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,169
The bomb`s not there...

375
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,302
because they`d have to have
a rocket and that shit.

376
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:55,541
They are a bunch of wogs.
Cross that out.

377
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:57,674
It`s a suitcase bomb.

378
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,650
I didn`t know I said that.

379
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,153
It`s a suitcase bomb.
You don`t need missiIes.

380
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,019
You can put a bomb
in a suitcase.

381
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,849
That`s good.
A suitcase bomb.

382
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,293
It`s a suitcase bomb.

383
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:13,731
When it`s cooking, it`s cooking.

384
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,893
We`re cooking, and it`s in...

385
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,465
Canada. AII right?

386
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:23,066
AIbanian terrorists
have pIaced a suitcase bomb...

387
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:27,306
in Canada in an attempt
to infiItrate it into the USA.

388
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:30,645
-That`s good.
-That`s terrific.

389
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,913
I`II teII you why.
It is cost effective.

390
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,216
It`s producing.
That`s what it is.

391
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,848
-It`s reaIIy great.
-I couId teII you stories.

392
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,188
CeciI B. De MiIIe,
The Greatest Show on Earth...

393
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:42,194
he needs an eIephant.

394
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:43,456
I got the president on the Iine.

395
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,290
One minute.

396
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,930
Needs an eIephant for a reshoot.
Know what he does?

397
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,404
Ames here. Yes, sir?

398
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,407
You Iistening?

399
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,534
-Nobody`s Iistening.
-I`m Iistening.

400
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:00,875
-The suitcase bomb.
-Good titIe for a movie.

401
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,972
PIease, write it down.
Don`t editoriaIize.

402
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,347
The thinking is, terrorism.

403
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:08,842
Act One:
AIbania denies everything.

404
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:12,119
The president comes on the air,
``Be caIm.``

405
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:13,454
Know what I need?

406
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:17,258
Get me Johnny Dean,
Liz Butsky, and the Fad King.

407
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,786
Isn`t Johnny Dean in the...

408
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,128
Back in NashviIIe.

409
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:25,726
-Act Two.
-We don`t need an Act Two.

410
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,569
Don`t forget Fad King.
We don`t need an Act Two?

411
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,598
We just have to hoId
their interest for 11 days.

412
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:32,611
It`s a teaser.

413
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,306
AbsoIuteIy right.

414
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:37,372
Grace. Teaser.

415
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,112
They`re getting a good reaction
on the AIbanian thing.

416
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:43,280
HeIIo, John, you two-bit
redneck shitkicker.

417
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:45,085
How the heck are you?

418
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,092
Get out.

419
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,830
He`s got a new wife.

420
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:56,631
He`s riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.

421
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,398
We need you here yesterday.

422
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,775
AII right?
Get your ass out here.

423
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:09,280
The president wonders about
the possibIe AIbanian backIash.

424
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,840
You can`t have a war
without an enemy.

425
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,250
We couId, but it wouId be duII.

426
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:15,776
How Iong do we need him?

427
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,584
We`re done in 11 days.

428
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,887
EIeven days. We need you.

429
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,450
You want to write a song for us?

430
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:25,258
Is there gonna be a back end?

431
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,299
Is there a back end?

432
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,130
Back end?

433
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,136
Percentage points, money.

434
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,660
Count on it.

435
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,469
Where is the back end
coming from?

436
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:38,203
It`s Iike
that yeIIow ribbon thing.

437
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,939
The hostages.

438
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,346
They tied the yeIIow ribbons
around everything.

439
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,282
But that was
a naturaIIy occurring--

440
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,511
That was a put-up job?

441
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,586
I want you to get Johnny
a ticket.

442
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,187
Fad King on two.

443
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,199
He`s riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.

444
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:04,230
Are you shitting me?

445
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:08,171
King, got a thing here,
product pIacement.

446
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,469
Of course there`s a back end.

447
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,974
-It can`t be a ribbon.
-What`s wrong with a ribbon?

448
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:15,913
AIDS has
the yeIIow ribbon thing.

449
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,210
Fuck ribbons.

450
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:18,944
Canada.
Our neighbor to the north...

451
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:21,714
aII of a sudden transformed
into that pIace from whence...

452
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:23,915
Iike the north wind,
terror comes.

453
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:25,423
I Iike that. Keep taIking.

454
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:27,152
What guards us against Canada?

455
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:30,650
I guard the Canadian border.

456
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,186
Mounties guard the border.
Mountie hats.

457
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,664
Stupid fucking hats.

458
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,098
Davy Crockett had a hat.

459
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,262
You couId crush them
and put them in your pocket.

460
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,863
You can`t put a mountie hat
in your pocket.

461
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:43,568
You see this?
This is what producing is.

462
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:47,773
You put me in a room
with taIent...eIectric.

463
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,508
I`m thinking armbands.

464
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:53,951
-Armbands is good.
-I`m thinking green.

465
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,955
Last year, the number one coIor
in new cars was green.

466
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:59,150
-PeopIe Iike green.
-Hunter.

467
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:02,183
Hunter green.
Strong, pride, dignity.

468
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:04,092
Not KeIIy green.

469
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,324
I Iike it with a hat.

470
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:08,356
-Maybe.
-You see that?

471
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:14,503
Sit on my lap if you love me...

472
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,441
but don`t put your hand
down there.

473
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,841
I didn`t mean--

474
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:21,675
We`ll take a short nap.

475
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,944
I thought you shouId see it.

476
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,415
It shouIdn`t be a song.

477
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:29,717
I`m glad that your mama`s
not here.

478
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:31,347
Don`t do a song about it.

479
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,618
I thought it was funny.

480
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:33,955
Sit on my lap...

481
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:37,587
I don`t think it`s appropriate
for what we`re doing.

482
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:38,527
I just meant for you to see it.

483
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:42,933
I guard the Canadian border.

484
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:45,232
The president spent the weekend
pressing the flesh.

485
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,295
He wasn`t campaigning.
He was dating, actually.

486
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:53,909
Change this. Thank you.

487
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:56,813
Behind the mention of Albania,
of his stomach flu...

488
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:59,977
taking refuge these scant days
away from the election.

489
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,111
Young girI in rubbIe.

490
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:05,317
She was driven from her home
by AIbanian terrorists.

491
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:08,121
It is her
we are mobiIizing to defend.

492
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,061
-Or is it she?
-It is her.

493
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,586
Can we get her a kitten?

494
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,997
Young girI in rubbIe
with a kitten.

495
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,295
That`s good.

496
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:19,532
This is too static.

497
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:22,165
Young girI running
from the viIIage.

498
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:23,469
More energy.

499
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:25,977
Time to face
these terrible charges...

500
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:29,310
to answer
all of these questions.

501
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,373
-What`s this?
-Head shots.

502
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:36,149
GirIs to pIay the victim
in our news footage.

503
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,450
Write this down.

504
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,889
Young girI running
from viIIage towards camera.

505
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,621
Grainy hand-heId news footage.

506
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:43,992
Send it to everyone.

507
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:47,294
What do you think?
I Iike the sorrowfuI one.

508
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:49,493
What is this again?

509
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,527
Young AIbanian girI
running from her home.

510
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,833
I Iike this broad here.

511
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,568
Where? Too Texan.

512
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:58,337
We`re Iocked into AIbania.
Why?

513
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,708
AIbania`s hard to rhyme.

514
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:02,304
What are you Iooking at me for?

515
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:03,746
It`s the name of the country.

516
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,278
That rhymes.

517
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:14,385
-John BeIushi?
-Jim.

518
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:15,859
Jim BeIushi.

519
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:18,124
-Jim BeIushi what?
-AIbanian?

520
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:19,960
Jim BeIushi`s AIbanian?

521
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,363
Are you kidding?

522
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,733
Know anybody who`s eaten
in an AIbanian restaurant?

523
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,500
-Is there such a thing?
-Has to be.

524
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:31,270
-Is there a nationaI dish?
-We can make it up.

525
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,107
Jim BeIushi is AIbanian.

526
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,192
What time is it?

527
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:54,259
3:03.

528
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,561
Great idea.

529
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:59,128
To the men and women of
the 303 detachment with their...

530
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:00,661
Leopard skin.

531
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:02,731
With their berets.

532
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:04,207
How about aII bIack?

533
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:06,211
That`s good.

534
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:07,644
Half black, half leopard...

535
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,840
wear it on your head.

536
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,783
Half black, half leopard...

537
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:15,378
wear it to your bed.

538
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,718
Half black, half leopard.

539
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:19,917
I guard...

540
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,160
the American dream.

541
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:26,924
I guard...

542
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,860
the American dream.

543
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,076
Everybody`s always
in a hurry these days.

544
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,105
If they`re not
rushing somewhere...

545
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,743
they`re changing something
that doesn`t need changing.

546
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:50,186
That`s why I`m glad
we`re behind the president.

547
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:53,658
Sure we are.
Itjust makes good sense.

548
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:56,126
You don`t want to change
horses in midstream.

549
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,493
Why are they sticking
with this age-oId horseshit?

550
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,794
Why are they sticking
with the same garbage?

551
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,995
-Who hires these peopIe?
-I feeI insuIted having seen it.

552
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,130
-It`s offensive.
-Poorly costumed.

553
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:10,835
New York Times,
Washington Post: war.

554
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:13,936
Times got the FirefIy GirI
in the StyIe section.

555
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,743
Post on page 12.

556
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:18,943
It`s good. HeIIo?

557
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:22,018
It`s very important. Listen up.

558
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:25,353
It`s aII war.
You`re doing good.

559
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,052
WouId you vote for that person
based on that commerciaI?

560
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:30,288
-I don`t vote.
-Why don`t you vote?

561
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:32,627
When Major League BasebaII
started the fans voting...

562
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,097
I voted for Boog PoweII
on first base.

563
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,430
He didn`t get in,
and it disappointed me.

564
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:37,730
It`s futiIe.

565
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:39,737
You`ve never voted
for president?

566
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:42,000
Do you vote?

567
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,770
No. I aIways vote
for the Academy Awards...

568
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,141
but I never win.

569
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:47,406
Liz, do you vote?

570
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:50,006
I don`t vote.
I don`t Iike the rooms.

571
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:52,346
Too cIaustrophobic.
I can`t vote in smaII pIaces.

572
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,082
It`s about that time.

573
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:08,432
We got the AIbanian girI
with a cat, a kitten, and a dog.

574
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,628
I don`t want a dog.
I asked for a kitten.

575
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:13,729
I understand that,
but the pet wrangIer suggested--

576
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:16,900
I need to speak to the president
before you pick an animaI.

577
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:20,309
Can`t they find me a kitten?
Listen to me.

578
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,643
AIbanian terrorists
have a staging area...

579
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,343
for their atomic workshop.
That`s why she`s fIeeing.

580
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:27,477
What if it wasn`t AIbania?
Say it was ItaIy?

581
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,283
I can get a Iot of cash
if it`s ItaIy.

582
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:33,519
``Give them the boot.``
What if a shoe was the fad?

583
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,584
The IittIe girI
is coming toward the camera.

584
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:39,256
What does she have in her hands?
A kitten.

585
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:41,231
AIbania doesn`t
do anything for me.

586
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,665
That`s the probIem.

587
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,169
-We`re Iocked into AIbania.
-Why is that?

588
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:49,571
The president`s going to war
in about 30 minutes.

589
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,075
DecIaring war on AIbania?

590
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,270
We`re not decIaring war.
We`re going to war.

591
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,643
We haven`t decIared war
since WorId War II.

592
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,147
We`re going to war.

593
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:03,946
This late-breaking news
just in from Air Force One.

594
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,422
The president
of the United States...

595
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:08,858
has said he apologizes
for the need for secrecy...

596
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:11,055
and he assures
that it is necessary...

597
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:13,826
for the safety of the men
and women in combat.

598
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:16,026
He says that
the Republic of Albania...

599
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:19,799
long a staging ground
for terrorism around the world.

600
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:23,774
He mentioned a state of war
is or is about to happen...

601
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,710
between the United States
and the Republic of Albania.

602
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:28,269
How many kittens do we have?

603
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,611
There ought to be
kittens a-pIenty. I caIIed.

604
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:34,247
PeopIe, Iet`s get started.

605
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,621
My name is StanIey Motss.
I`II be your producer.

606
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,751
What I wouId Iike you to do,
Miss--

607
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,021
Tracy Lime.

608
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:45,325
Stand against that waII,
and on my signaI...

609
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,661
I want you running toward me,
screaming.

610
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,792
-Can we get you anything?
-I`m fine.

611
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,827
How about a cup of tea?
A IittIe miIk, Iow fat?

612
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,099
You OK?

613
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,266
Fine. Let`s try one.

614
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:58,640
Is this a nationaI?
Is that the case?

615
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,736
It`s a direct buy-out.

616
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,213
Have your agent--
What is this?

617
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:05,148
What is this, a menagerie?

618
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:07,708
I can`t wait to put this
on my r�sum�.

619
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:10,585
Can I taIk to you for a minute?

620
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:12,317
This is a speciaI kind
of situation.

621
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:17,161
We have a schnauzer
and what appears to be--

622
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:18,355
It`s a Lhasa apso.

623
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,423
It couIdn`t have been simpIer.
Kittens.

624
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:25,596
What you got here
is a cross between a dog--

625
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,400
I just want kittens.

626
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,964
AbsoIuteIy, sir.
The president wants a kitten.

627
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:32,101
I want a kitten.

628
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:35,272
Get rid of the dogs
and keep the kittens.

629
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:36,780
Miss. Excuse me.

630
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:39,545
I have to have you sign
this sheet of paper.

631
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:42,178
My agent wouId be miffed
with me if I--

632
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,983
This doesn`t have to do
with your deaI.

633
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:46,047
This is your security cIearance.

634
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:48,721
Right there.

635
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:52,628
Nice signature. Thank you.

636
00:30:52,664 --> 00:30:54,063
Nice meeting you.

637
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,000
This is a nice one.

638
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,768
That`s a cat.
These are kittens.

639
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,468
They wanted to give options.

640
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:08,502
It`s too confusing.
He`s pushing the Lopso opso.

641
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:10,606
-We`II do it opticaIIy.
-DigitaIIy.

642
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,742
Let`s try to shoot one.

643
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:14,479
-Stacey--
-Tracy.

644
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,987
I want you to stand over here.

645
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:19,320
Here you go. Right there.

646
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:20,688
These are chips.

647
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:25,825
HoId the bag when you run.

648
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:27,798
It`s for the arm position.
On screen, it`II be a kitten.

649
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,299
Can I hoId the kitten?

650
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,801
We`II punch it in Iater.

651
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:32,564
You`re gonna punch
the kitten Iater?

652
00:31:32,604 --> 00:31:33,832
Why?

653
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:35,635
For a wider set of options.

654
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:38,040
A wider option of what?

655
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,771
Of kittens.

656
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,982
Sir, aII kidding aside,
I get to put it on my r�sum�?

657
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:47,609
ActuaIIy, no.

658
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:51,053
What is it,
a guiId thing or something?

659
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:53,421
You can never teII anyone
you did this.

660
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,755
What couId they do?

661
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:57,227
They`d come to your house
and kiII you.

662
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,389
The president.

663
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:01,626
Stop the makeup.
She`s been raped by terrorists.

664
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,566
-She`s not paIe enough.
-Jump out.

665
00:32:03,602 --> 00:32:05,968
They`re starting to shoot now...

666
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:09,132
and they`re gonna
do the kitten thing opticaIIy.

667
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,903
That`s right, Mr. President.

668
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,876
I don`t know how
they do the kitten opticaIIy...

669
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,845
but they know
what they`re doing.

670
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,815
She`s not an iIIegaI immigrant,
is she?

671
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:23,081
CouId I see the contract?

672
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:24,952
Why is it so fIat?

673
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,482
Because the president cannot
empIoy an iIIegaI immigrant.

674
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,323
-Let`s use more spray.
-Cover up.

675
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:32,193
Let`s keep working!

676
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,754
Are we getting there?

677
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:40,702
Good.
Put the viIIage behind her.

678
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:51,315
Gimme some fIames.

679
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:56,184
How about some screaming?

680
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:57,518
Screaming`s good.

681
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:59,489
Some sound of screaming.

682
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:06,760
What might be good
is ooh-ahh sirens.

683
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:08,789
You know. Anne Frank.

684
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,892
That`s good.

685
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,869
Find us the Anne Frank sirens.

686
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:14,735
That`s chiIIing. That`s good.

687
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:16,240
That`s giving me goose bumps.

688
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,832
Find us the ooh-ahhs.

689
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,845
We`re gonna be back
in Washington when?

690
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:29,410
We`II be back tonight.

691
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:31,115
Tonight is...

692
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:34,091
It seems that Senator NeaI
has discovered something.

693
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,685
It makes no difference
about Senator NeaI.

694
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:39,492
I don`t care what he`s got.
We got a war.

695
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,294
Look at that girI.

696
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:44,825
Doesn`t she Iook AIbanian?

697
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,360
She Iooks Iike she was
born and raised in AIbania.

698
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:51,241
I got an instinct for casting.
Don`t ask me why.

699
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:53,210
We`re gonna do it again,
sweetie.

700
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,474
-What`s her name, Stacey?
-Tracy.

701
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:57,777
One more time.
You`re doing fine.

702
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,519
CouId she be running
across a bridge?

703
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:06,982
She`s running across
a burning bridge.

704
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:16,661
-That Iooks good.
-That`s beautifuI.

705
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,498
Of course,
we`II need some water.

706
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,333
Is it a stream?

707
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:21,737
I think...

708
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,139
-A pond?
-I think...

709
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:26,700
I think it`s a caIico kitten.

710
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,305
She`s running across
with a kitten.

711
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,781
Can we have a caIico kitten?
PIease?

712
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,444
FIoyd, punch in a caIico kitten.

713
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:36,113
I have 19 screens here.

714
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:37,917
I can`t see one caIico kitten.

715
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:41,653
The thinking is
a smaII caIico kitten, sir.

716
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:51,301
We have a smaII caIico kitten.

717
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,304
-What?
-He wants a white one.

718
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,275
He wants a white one?

719
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:01,468
Let me taIk to him.

720
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:03,481
He`s mobiIizing the sixth fIeet.

721
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,312
Can I taIk to him?

722
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,113
He`s mobiIizing the sixth fIeet.

723
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:11,688
I hate it
when they start to meddIe.

724
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,190
Can we have a white one?

725
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:14,589
He wants a white one.

726
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,727
Thank you.

727
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,302
Are we ready yet?

728
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:34,334
How soon can we get this cut?

729
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,074
4 or 5 hours.

730
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,049
That`s good.
We can Ieak that to the press...

731
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,608
they can downIink it
on TeI star 401, transporter 21.

732
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:45,346
Makes you gIad
you`ve Iived this Iong.

733
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:51,386
This just in--a special report
from the Albanian front.

734
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:52,794
We`vejust received
information...

735
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:56,096
the young Albanian national
fleeing in this video...

736
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,034
is attempting to escape
terrorist reprisals...

737
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:59,331
in her village.

738
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,366
America has seldom witnessed...

739
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,538
a more poignant picture
of the human race...

740
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,605
Fantastic.

741
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,309
They used the same process...

742
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,977
with the Iast
Schwarzenegger movie.

743
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,081
Isn`t that amazing
how they do that?

744
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:19,453
This is onIy the beginning.

745
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,220
Wait tiII we get the song.

746
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:23,955
Then you got the song, image,
merchandising tie-ins.

747
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:25,326
This is onIy the beginning.

748
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:28,389
We were right.
You`re the man.

749
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:30,492
To the beginning.

750
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:32,002
Got your car.

751
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,732
I hate it
when they send these Iong ones.

752
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:37,297
-Did you make the turn OK?
-Not a probIem.

753
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,469
I`m sorry.
You think it`s too ostentatious?

754
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,910
Just fine. I`II stretch out.

755
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:42,276
Good. Just make due.

756
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,282
I`II see you in NashviIIe.

757
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:49,713
Go with the two-tone hat.

758
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:52,222
I don`t care.
You work it out.

759
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:55,420
You. You must have had
simiIar situations in the past.

760
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,157
There are unconfirmed reports
from a reliable source...

761
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:01,028
that things are in motion.

762
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:03,625
What I`m hearing--
and this is a quote--

763
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,568
``The president
is looking for a swift...

764
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:07,901
painless, and victorious
conclusion to the war.``

765
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:11,033
However, the source
will not go on record.

766
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:14,203
All I can tell you is this
comes from the highest level.

767
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,076
New York Times,
Washington Post...

768
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:17,445
Detroit Register,
Sacramento Bee...

769
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:20,474
aII in remission.
No mention of the FirefIy GirI.

770
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:23,112
10 days to go.
Big Bird Iands when?

771
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,678
Five a.m.

772
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:26,019
Anything at the airport?

773
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:27,786
The press thought no.
What do you think?

774
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,816
Here`s what I think.
Is it gonna rain?

775
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:31,590
Can you give me the weather
tomorrow morning?

776
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,119
Andrews, five a.m.

777
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:35,223
A young AIbanian girI...

778
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:37,029
dressed in her...whatever.

779
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:40,595
Is there
some harvest festivaI...

780
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:42,970
an AIbanian harvest festivaI,
something Iike that?

781
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:45,237
Find me
an AIbanian harvest festivaI.

782
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:46,573
There`s gotta be something.

783
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,738
Anyway, she gives him
the sacred whatever it is...

784
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,544
teIIing him this is a sacred
traditionaI offering...

785
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,051
given to the man
who ties the first sheaf...

786
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,212
the Iast sheaf,
who knows what sheaf?

787
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:57,653
Is she saying this in AIbanian?

788
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:58,986
She`s speaking in AIbanian...

789
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:01,287
because this is the onIy way
it can be understood...

790
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:03,988
by her sacred, sainted,
and aged mother...

791
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:06,963
We`re picking them up now.

792
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:10,229
The old lady starts to speak.

793
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:12,133
``You have brought peace
not only to this--``

794
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,536
The chiId speaks.

795
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:16,437
A face of innocence,
no cynicism.

796
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:17,771
The chiId says...

797
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:19,436
Are you getting this?

798
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:22,241
The oId broad starts to cry.

799
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,248
Big Bird shrugs off
his secret service,...

800
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:26,409
covers her with his coat,
end of story.

801
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:30,251
Can you find out if we could
get some rain tomorrow?

802
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,119
How is Big Bird holding up?

803
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,384
He`s good.

804
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:36,416
He does want to know--
what does Motss want?

805
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:38,986
I don`t know.
Ambassador to Togo.

806
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,329
No rain tomorrow at Andrews,
but there`s rain at Boca Raton.

807
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,335
Then direct the pIane to Boca.

808
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,599
Connie says
divert the pIane to Boca.

809
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:54,740
What`s happening?

810
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,053
Can I heIp you?

811
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,428
What`s the probIem?

812
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,157
We`re in a rush.

813
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:19,465
Do you know who we are?

814
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:21,369
I`m afraid that`s the troubIe,
Miss Ames.

815
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:23,169
CIA.

816
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:32,274
I have this to say...

817
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,351
...every American man,
woman, and child...

818
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,056
What am I gonna do?

819
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:47,530
I have
a three-year-oId daughter...

820
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:49,396
eventuaIIy headed
for orthodonture.

821
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:52,267
Now that the CIA knows,
I`m gonna Iose everything--

822
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:54,498
my career, my reputation.
What am I gonna do?

823
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,507
Brazen it through.

824
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,270
Took you Iong enough.

825
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,402
We found them
as soon as we couId.

826
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,310
AII right.

827
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:05,315
After I`m done with them,
what do they want me to do?

828
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,749
Lug them back to the district
or dump them in the country...

829
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:09,275
Iet the FBI trip over them?

830
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,311
LegaI department says you pick.

831
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:12,913
Depends on what we want
to do with them.

832
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:15,755
This is a special report
on the war in Albania.

833
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:17,385
We`vejust received
more details...

834
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:19,396
on the Albanian girl
running for her life.

835
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,057
The young girl
was trying to escape...

836
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:23,067
after hearing
her family was killed.

837
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,501
Apparently, there was
a family connection in Canada.

838
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:31,531
Two things I know to be true...

839
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,645
there`s no difference between
good fIan and bad fIan...

840
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,204
and there is no war.

841
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:38,545
Guess who I am.

842
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,575
I wouId Iike to point out
that I am under medicaI care...

843
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,053
and taking medication,
side effects of which have--

844
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:45,749
Quite touching.

845
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,451
I aIso take this opportunity...

846
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:50,188
to suggest that, equaIIy,
I admit to nothing...

847
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:51,786
and I wouId Iike
my Iawyer present.

848
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,763
We show, and NSA confirms...

849
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:56,665
there are no nucIear devices
on the Canadian border.

850
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:58,931
There are no nucIear devices
in AIbania.

851
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,961
AIbania has no nucIear capacity.

852
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:02,666
Our spy sateIIites...

853
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,868
show no secret
terrorist training camps...

854
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,843
in the AIbanian hinterIand.

855
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:09,847
The border patroI, the FBI,
the RCMP report...

856
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:13,510
no--repeat--
no untoward activity...

857
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,849
aIong our picturesque
Canadian border.

858
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:18,879
The AIbanian government
is screaming its defense.

859
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:20,220
The worId is Iistening.

860
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:21,691
There is no war.

861
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,251
There`s a war.
I`m watching it on teIevision.

862
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,286
Who might you be?

863
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,924
-Conrad Brean.
-Who do you work for?

864
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:32,367
Nobody whose name
you want me to say.

865
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:35,463
It`s aII weII, but when the fit
hits the shan...

866
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,098
somebody has to stay
after schooI.

867
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:38,631
Who might that be?

868
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:41,008
I don`t know
what you`re taIking about.

869
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:43,513
The spy sateIIites show it.

870
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:44,845
They show no war.

871
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:46,406
Then what good are they?

872
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,783
Why spend a quarter triIIion
doIIars a year on defense?

873
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,254
What good are they?

874
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:52,722
Are they useIess or just broken?

875
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:54,622
I wouId Iike
to point out further...

876
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:56,524
that these medications
taken in conjunction--

877
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,223
If there`s no threat,
then where are you?

878
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:00,890
If there`s no threat,
what good are you?

879
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:03,127
You are the threat.

880
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,566
I`m the threat?

881
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:06,035
What have I been doing
the Iast 30 years...

882
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,061
that you haven`t been doing?

883
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:09,936
The Iast 30 years...

884
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,908
I have been working to ensure
the security of my country.

885
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:15,003
I`m sure that speaks weII
of you and your parents...

886
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:17,378
but if forced to choose between
the security of your country...

887
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:19,679
and the security of your job,
which wouId you pick?

888
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:22,311
WhiIe you hesitate,
permit me to suggest...

889
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,685
that they are one in the same.

890
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:27,213
I`m doing my job.
That`s what you see me doing.

891
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:28,850
I`m doing my job, too.

892
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:30,121
The constant stress
I am under...

893
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:33,062
Let me ask you
a simpIe question.

894
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:35,429
Why do peopIe go to war?

895
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:37,991
I`II pIay your siIIy game.

896
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,297
To ensure their way of Iife.

897
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:41,328
-WouId you fight to do that?
-I have.

898
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:44,068
If you went to war again,
who wouId it be against?

899
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:46,338
Your abiIity to fight
a two-ocean war against who?

900
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:47,605
Sweden and Togo?

901
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:49,738
That time has passed.
It`s over.

902
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,544
The war of the future
is nucIear terrorism.

903
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,517
It`II be against
a smaII group of dissidents...

904
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:57,646
who, unbeknownst perhaps to
their own governments, have...

905
00:42:57,688 --> 00:42:59,883
To go to that war,
you have to be prepared.

906
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:02,415
You gotta be aIert.
The pubIic has gotta be aIert...

907
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,655
because that is the war
of the future...

908
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:07,459
and if you`re not gearing up
to fight that war...

909
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:09,625
then the ax wiII faII.
You`II be out in the street.

910
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,761
You can caII this a driII,
caII this job security...

911
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:15,237
caII it anything you Iike,
but I got one for you.

912
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:16,934
Go to war
to preserve your way of Iife?

913
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:20,273
Chuck, this is your way of Iife.

914
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,279
If your spy sateIIites
don`t see nothing...

915
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,905
if there ain`t no war...

916
00:43:23,948 --> 00:43:26,917
then you can go home
and take up goIf...

917
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,010
`cause there ain`t no war
but ours.

918
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:34,754
Thank you.

919
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:37,519
Drive carefuIIy.

920
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:47,565
Nice enough peopIe.

921
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:49,197
They just hadn`t
thought it through.

922
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,071
You taIked us out of there.

923
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:53,269
We got deIayed.
We`re going to NashviIIe.

924
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:54,539
What?

925
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:56,375
You couId taIk a dog
off a meat truck.

926
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,314
Thank you.

927
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:59,782
We just got stuck.

928
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:02,513
AII systems five-by-five.
See you in NashviIIe.

929
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:04,145
You saved our bacon.

930
00:44:04,188 --> 00:44:06,418
It was just a...

931
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:08,823
a phenomenaI performance.

932
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,451
You turned them around.

933
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,654
They hadn`t thought it through.

934
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:22,799
He`s moving across the tarmac.

935
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,004
But it appears something
has distracted the president...

936
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,537
and he has stopped moving
toward the waiting motorcade.

937
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,379
There`s a little girl...

938
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:35,282
trying to speak
to the president.

939
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,150
It seems she`s speaking in--

940
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:38,678
Is it Albanian?

941
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:40,486
Can we get someone
to translate?

942
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:44,123
Dan,
I think what she is saying...

943
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:48,120
is that this wheat offering
is sort of ceremonial...

944
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:50,725
and that it is
the first sheaf...

945
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:52,463
the first cut of the harvest.

946
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:54,494
I`m not proficient
in Albanian...

947
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:56,165
but the old woman
is quite taken...

948
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,471
as the president
is offering her the coat.

949
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:01,137
It is quite
an emotional moment here.

950
00:45:01,178 --> 00:45:03,510
There comes a time...

951
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:07,714
in the course of human events...

952
00:45:08,419 --> 00:45:11,183
when a threat
must be answered...

953
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,954
with courage and strength.

954
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:18,551
Our forefathers earned...

955
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:21,030
the right to be free.

956
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:23,727
Now it`s time...

957
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:27,761
to guard their dream.

958
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:30,899
We guard...

959
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:35,105
our American borders.

960
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:37,580
We guard...

961
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:40,778
the American dream.

962
00:45:40,818 --> 00:45:43,480
We guard our right...

963
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:48,458
to fight for democracy...

964
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:53,987
and keep our country free.

965
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:57,859
We guard...

966
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:00,530
our American spirit.

967
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:04,503
We guard...

968
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:07,340
the American dream.

969
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:21,286
Our country`s built...

970
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:24,420
on the rock of liberty.

971
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:28,598
And we, as people...

972
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:30,827
must keep it free.

973
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:33,928
It is for life...

974
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:35,268
liberty...

975
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:38,503
the pursuit of happiness...

976
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:43,673
Freedom, `tis of thee.

977
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:47,781
We guard...

978
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:51,879
our American borders.

979
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:54,356
We guard...

980
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:57,360
the American dream.

981
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:00,497
I Ioved the fat,
wet AIbanian broad.

982
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:01,828
Thank you.

983
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:03,629
You know why?
It was understated.

984
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,396
You got Iucky
with the rain, too.

985
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:07,768
We had to divert
the pIane to Boca Raton.

986
00:47:07,805 --> 00:47:10,137
You shouId have come to me.
We have rain machines.

987
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:11,505
I`m a producer. I make rain.

988
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:12,941
Next time.

989
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:15,636
I havejust gotten word...

990
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,012
that the situation
in Albania is resolved...

991
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:21,313
that it is resolved.

992
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:23,047
The CIA confirms...

993
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,056
that our troops
along the Canadian border...

994
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,820
and overseas are standing down.

995
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:34,155
I must take this opportunity
to call upon our president...

996
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:36,291
What does he mean,
the situation has been resoIved?

997
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,994
He just ended the war.

998
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:39,297
He ended the war?

999
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:40,769
Why did he do that?

1000
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:42,328
I think the CIA
cut a better deaI.

1001
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:43,635
He ended the war?

1002
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,000
He can`t end the war.

1003
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,070
He`s not producing this.

1004
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:55,313
This is in bad taste.

1005
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:56,683
Can we stop this?

1006
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:01,081
Stop. It`s over.

1007
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,152
Can we stop this?

1008
00:48:04,195 --> 00:48:05,685
Stop the choir.

1009
00:48:07,698 --> 00:48:09,461
It has been quite a week,
Richard.

1010
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,832
I can`t remember
when any president...

1011
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:13,632
was hit with the flu, a war...

1012
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:16,265
and accused of sexual
misconduct by a teenage girl...

1013
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:17,740
all in the same
seven-day period.

1014
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:21,472
This, of course, only days
before he runs for reelection.

1015
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:23,878
We`vejust received information
from sources at the CIA...

1016
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:27,077
that confirms the cessation
of hostilities...

1017
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:28,379
The CIA.

1018
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,556
I thought they Iet us out
too easiIy.

1019
00:48:33,591 --> 00:48:35,456
The war`s over.

1020
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:37,517
It`s over.
I saw it on teIevision.

1021
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:38,823
I have to seII my house.

1022
00:48:38,862 --> 00:48:41,990
The war is not over.

1023
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:43,397
I saw it on TV.

1024
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:46,198
That`s what you hired me for.

1025
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:48,671
The war isn`t over
untiI I say it`s over.

1026
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:51,140
This is my picture.
This is not the CIA`s picture.

1027
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:54,144
You think
you`re in a tight spot now?

1028
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:56,942
Try making The Four Horsemen
of the ApocaIypse.

1029
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:58,949
Three of the horsemen died.

1030
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:01,781
Hear what he`s saying?
Three of the horsemen died...

1031
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:04,049
two weeks before the end
of principaI photography.

1032
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:06,352
This is nothing.

1033
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,587
This is just Act One,
``The War.``

1034
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:13,586
We reaIIy do need an Act Two,
so we work.

1035
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:14,859
Act Two.

1036
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:16,263
You know what it`s Iike?

1037
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,995
The Japanese. In the caves.

1038
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:20,128
-Go on.
-Okinawa.

1039
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,104
They didn`t beIieve
the war was over.

1040
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:24,232
We have a guy
who doesn`t beIieve--

1041
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:26,402
We have an American serviceman.

1042
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:29,310
A brave American serviceman
is Ieft behind.

1043
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:31,541
A hero.

1044
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:33,846
I can`t beIieve it.
What was I thinking?

1045
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:35,647
We had a war.
We forgot the hero.

1046
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:38,519
You can`t have a war
and not have a hero.

1047
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:39,920
It`s Iike we sent
a Christmas card...

1048
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,515
and Ieft out the--
What do you caII it?

1049
00:49:41,558 --> 00:49:42,855
-Fruitcake.
-There you go.

1050
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:44,861
Let`s work.

1051
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:46,988
We got a guy
who`s Ieft behind, so--

1052
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:49,625
This is terrific.
This is Iucky this happened.

1053
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:51,635
He was Ieft behind,
just discarded...

1054
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:54,866
Iike an oId shoe.

1055
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,133
That`s good.

1056
00:49:56,173 --> 00:49:57,902
What`s good? What did I say?

1057
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:59,169
-Shoe.
-OId shoe?

1058
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:00,471
It`s just instinct.

1059
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:04,574
Get me the Pentagon...

1060
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:08,244
a Iist of peopIe in aII
miIitary speciaI programs.

1061
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,310
``Left behind Iike an oId shoe.``
That is good.

1062
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,456
I want to taIk to Johnny.

1063
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:18,389
What is it?

1064
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:21,330
The war is over.

1065
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:23,629
We`re going to need a new song.

1066
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:26,397
It shouId be a song
about a shiny shoe...

1067
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:28,997
a bIack patent shoe...

1068
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:30,836
a good oId shoe.

1069
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:33,638
I was on my way to get drunk.

1070
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:37,807
You get drunk, but I need
a good oId shoe song.

1071
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:39,281
A baIIad of Ioss...

1072
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:42,983
-Want to heIp me?
-Redemption.

1073
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,853
Loss and redemption
is very good.

1074
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:49,086
Shit.
What key do you want it in?

1075
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:50,593
I don`t know keys.

1076
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:55,596
PeopIe here are depressed
because the war just ended.

1077
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:57,759
PIease give me a new song.

1078
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,598
I got him.

1079
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:01,763
King, Pentagon.

1080
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:03,329
Take it.

1081
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:07,003
I need a Iist
of miIitary speciaI programs.

1082
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:09,444
Bottom of the ninth.

1083
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,947
They don`t know
who they`re pIaying with.

1084
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:14,608
They don`t shut down
our picture.

1085
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:16,482
You peopIe gonna be Iong?

1086
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,420
Otherwise,
I`II put away the equipment.

1087
00:51:18,455 --> 00:51:19,683
I don`t know what I`m doing.

1088
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:22,487
I think I`m supposed
to be writing a song.

1089
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:23,959
What kind of song?

1090
00:51:23,994 --> 00:51:26,326
Is there anybody there named...

1091
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:28,297
Schumann?

1092
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:30,630
-Schuster?
-Schumacher.

1093
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:31,929
I got a great idea.

1094
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,604
OId shoe, new shoe.

1095
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,433
Daddy had a hound dog...

1096
00:51:40,978 --> 00:51:42,673
used to call him Blue.

1097
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:48,144
Follow me `round...

1098
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:50,745
stick to me like glue.

1099
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:57,693
His favorite thing
to play with...

1100
00:51:57,728 --> 00:51:59,787
used to be a good ol` shoe.

1101
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,889
Wait a minute.
Used to be.

1102
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,627
You hit that 16-16.

1103
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,658
Well, I wish I had a woman...

1104
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:08,963
who was half as good and true.

1105
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:14,466
Anybody here know Morse code?

1106
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:15,842
What you gonna do?

1107
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:17,210
Give me the fax.

1108
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,383
Sergeant WiIIiam Schumann,
U.S. Army...

1109
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:24,353
seriaI number 2131284262.

1110
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:27,055
Good oI` shoe...

1111
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,352
Here`s the deaI.

1112
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:31,627
Good Ol` Shoe.

1113
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:35,625
Whatever you walk in...

1114
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,258
he will get you through.

1115
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:40,293
He`s in a sweater...

1116
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:41,929
and he`s...

1117
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:44,964
We drop him behind enemy Iines.

1118
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:46,566
He`s trapped.

1119
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,043
The sweater.

1120
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:49,875
-In the sweater.
-Good.

1121
00:52:51,114 --> 00:52:56,017
Is there a way we can make it
sound oId and scratchy...

1122
00:52:56,053 --> 00:52:57,748
with, Iike, a hiss?

1123
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:04,190
With an oId IabeI.

1124
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:05,695
I see where you`re going.

1125
00:53:11,368 --> 00:53:13,563
Stand up straight and tall...

1126
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,469
the way he taught you to.

1127
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:17,269
I`II write a speech.

1128
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:21,069
I`II heIp you with the speech.

1129
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,978
The president reveaIs
that WiIIiam Schumann...

1130
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:29,617
was trapped behind enemy Iines.

1131
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:31,587
This is good.

1132
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:33,419
HeartfeIt.

1133
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:34,719
Touching.

1134
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,288
PeopIe wiII weep.

1135
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:41,056
Soul of a good ol` shoe.

1136
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,064
He might even get to heaven...

1137
00:53:46,103 --> 00:53:49,163
on the soul of his good ol`...

1138
00:53:49,206 --> 00:53:51,868
shoe.

1139
00:53:56,413 --> 00:53:58,438
Here`s the president`s speech.

1140
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:00,507
Put this
in the Library of Congress.

1141
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:02,246
FoIk music section, 1930.

1142
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:04,220
Right away, pIease.

1143
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:06,984
Get it in
the Library of Congress now.

1144
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:10,956
Oh, God.

1145
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:12,985
Who`s seeing
the CBS guy tonight?

1146
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:17,530
Tonight, you remember some song
from the foIk song days--

1147
00:54:17,568 --> 00:54:18,933
about a good oId shoe.

1148
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,300
Tonight?

1149
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:23,067
You`re with him watching
the president`s speech--

1150
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:24,368
What if he`s busy?

1151
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:27,104
-Lure him.
-What are you saying?

1152
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:30,307
I don`t have to be
your confessor, darIing.

1153
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:32,907
TeII him you`ve got info
on the sex scandaI...

1154
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,247
it`s on your conscience.

1155
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:36,115
He`II drop whatever he`s doing.

1156
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:38,912
This is a shitty business.

1157
00:54:38,956 --> 00:54:41,117
It needs no ghost from the grave
to teII us that...

1158
00:54:41,158 --> 00:54:43,592
but, Lord wiIIing,
eight days from now...

1159
00:54:43,627 --> 00:54:46,323
I`m gonna take you
into the second term.

1160
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:47,762
Wait tiII you hear the speech.

1161
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:49,732
The 303 speech. Great.

1162
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,563
Where`s that Fad King?

1163
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:52,830
I`II get him.

1164
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:54,200
CouId we go now?

1165
00:54:54,237 --> 00:54:56,671
A good pIan today is better
than a perfect pIan tomorrow.

1166
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:59,005
How are they doing
on Sergeant Schumann?

1167
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,839
They`re working on him,
they`re finding him.

1168
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:02,469
Good. It`s working.

1169
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:05,037
It`s aII happening.
It`s taking pIace around us.

1170
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:08,779
It is in the works.
It is being addressed.

1171
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:10,116
We are being proactive.

1172
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:13,316
We are going out with what
may be the finest exampIe--

1173
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:16,087
Get me an update on the army,
the Pentagon.

1174
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:17,650
Get this guy Schumann.

1175
00:55:17,694 --> 00:55:19,059
Have him standing by.

1176
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:23,294
I gotta teII you,
I see a Iot of gIum faces.

1177
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,857
PIease don`t be disconsoIate.

1178
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:28,166
This is poIitics at its finest.

1179
00:55:28,205 --> 00:55:31,265
This is where the rubber
meets the road.

1180
00:55:31,308 --> 00:55:33,538
We`ve got a Ieader
going out tonight...

1181
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:35,238
to 95 miIIion American homes.

1182
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,007
He`s gonna turn
this thing around.

1183
00:55:37,047 --> 00:55:38,810
You think this is tough?

1184
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:41,716
I was 4 months into production
on The Song of SoIomon...

1185
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:43,310
found out I didn`t
have the rights.

1186
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,945
Turn it up. It`s our spot.

1187
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:48,219
Tough? This is nothing.

1188
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:51,489
WiII you Iook at that shit?

1189
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:55,062
`Cause you don`t change
horses in midstream.

1190
00:55:57,434 --> 00:55:59,868
Don`t change horses.

1191
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:01,302
This speech is good.

1192
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:03,533
We`re kinda Iocked into it,
Mr. President.

1193
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:07,302
For the future
of our families...

1194
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:09,471
The music.
Where did they get that?

1195
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,782
-Pain in the ass.
-What?

1196
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:20,489
He won`t do the speech.

1197
00:56:20,524 --> 00:56:22,583
What do you mean?

1198
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,457
What choice does he have?

1199
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,462
He won`t do the speech?

1200
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:27,929
He says it`s corny.

1201
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:30,262
It`s what? It`s corny?

1202
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:32,832
Of course it`s corny.

1203
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:35,531
We wouIdn`t have him say it
if it wasn`t.

1204
00:56:35,572 --> 00:56:37,005
It`s not a question.

1205
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,769
This is the center
for rest of the thing.

1206
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:40,037
Don`t teII me it`s corny.

1207
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:42,511
We`re Iocked into the speech,
right?

1208
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:43,774
We`re Iocked in.

1209
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:45,714
We are pIaying way past this.

1210
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,080
We are past this.

1211
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:50,546
This is what I need.

1212
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:54,216
Get me 30 secretaries
and put them in an office now.

1213
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,250
I need to see the president.

1214
00:56:57,294 --> 00:56:59,125
I need 5 minutes.

1215
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:01,096
Know what this reminds me of?

1216
00:57:01,131 --> 00:57:04,191
Years ago, when I first
went out to HoIIywood...

1217
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:05,462
they said,
``It`s too theatricaI.``

1218
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:08,596
I was from the theater.
Everything was over their heads.

1219
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:09,969
He thinks it`s corny.

1220
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:11,667
Don`t teII me it`s corny.

1221
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,175
TeII him I`m comin`.

1222
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:17,237
My feIIow Americans,
I thank a mercifuI God...

1223
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,044
and I am sure
each and every one of us...

1224
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:22,017
wiII thank that Supreme Power...

1225
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:25,283
whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1226
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:27,813
that peace is at hand.

1227
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:31,521
The threat of nucIear terrorism
has been queIIed.

1228
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,724
Mr. President, I`m using
a IittIe more projection...

1229
00:57:34,765 --> 00:57:38,394
because I think this speech
needs a IittIe umph.

1230
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,567
Bear with me.

1231
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:44,665
BeautifuI.

1232
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:47,302
Thank you so much.

1233
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:01,884
That was so moving.

1234
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:03,222
Thank you so much.

1235
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,522
Thank you.

1236
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:14,032
I feIt very much at home
in there.

1237
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,662
SimpIe quirk of fate.

1238
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:17,263
I couId have gone this way.

1239
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:18,706
It`s aII a change in wardrobe.

1240
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,343
Was it too much?

1241
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:24,370
I`II teII you.

1242
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:25,676
You did it.

1243
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,047
You jumped in there...

1244
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:29,949
and saved the thing
when the thing needed saving.

1245
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:31,977
It wasn`t too much?

1246
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:33,853
PersonaIIy?

1247
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,118
Maybe it was.

1248
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:38,389
The president doesn`t
have to say it that way.

1249
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:39,895
It`s Iike PIato once said.

1250
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:41,557
It doesn`t matter
how you get there...

1251
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:42,860
as Iong as you get there.

1252
00:58:42,899 --> 00:58:44,161
He said that?

1253
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:46,499
What is it exactIy
you do for the president?

1254
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:49,630
My fellow Americans,
I thank a merciful God...

1255
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:53,609
and I`m sure all of us will thank
that Supreme Power...

1256
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:56,339
whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1257
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:58,939
that peace is at hand.

1258
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:06,485
The threat of nuclear terrorism
has been quelled.

1259
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:10,015
We are in contact
with the Albanian premier...

1260
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,527
who assures me--

1261
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,791
and this government
credits his assurances--

1262
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,321
his country
does not wish us ill...

1263
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:17,594
Know any Latin?

1264
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:19,192
I, CIaudius.
That`s what I know.

1265
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:22,831
I need a Latin motto
for the patch.

1266
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:24,500
The 303 patch.

1267
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:28,204
...but by
a designation number, 303.

1268
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:32,477
A member was left behind
what were then enemy lines.

1269
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:36,679
I can only say to those
family members of Group 303...

1270
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,416
whose members are,
I know as I speak...

1271
00:59:39,456 --> 00:59:40,855
gathering to comfort you.

1272
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,359
To the parents
of the missing man...

1273
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:45,224
no effort will be spared...

1274
00:59:45,262 --> 00:59:48,891
to find this brave man
and bring him home.

1275
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:52,368
We`vejust received
this photograph of Schumann...

1276
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:55,496
held by a dissident group
of Albanian terrorists.

1277
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:58,666
I don`t know how many of you
know Morse code...

1278
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:01,700
but could you
bring the camera closer?

1279
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:05,806
You`ll see his sweater is worn.

1280
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:08,317
It has been unraveled in places.

1281
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:10,080
Those places
form dashes and dots...

1282
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:14,921
and those dots spell out
a message in Morse code.

1283
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,688
That message is,
``Courage, Mom.``

1284
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:21,630
He got the message through.

1285
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,500
Not bad for government work.

1286
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:27,230
Having a good time?

1287
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,534
Haven`t had this much fun
since Iive TV.

1288
01:00:29,572 --> 01:00:32,234
To the men and women
of Unit 303...

1289
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:34,743
to my fellow citizens,
I say, ``Courage, Mom.``

1290
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:38,737
I have informed Albania
that we will not rest...

1291
01:00:38,782 --> 01:00:40,613
until the safe return
of Sergeant Schumann.

1292
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,848
I`m told his unit mates gave him
the nickname ``Old Shoe.``

1293
01:00:44,888 --> 01:00:48,915
Wasn`t there a foIk song
caIIed ``OId Shoe?``

1294
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:52,053
Do you remember that?
Something Iike...

1295
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:55,087
I don`t know.
I can vagueIy remember it.

1296
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:57,361
Do you know
what I`m taIking about?

1297
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:01,330
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1298
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:03,430
Good night and God bless.

1299
01:01:03,473 --> 01:01:07,876
Trump that, Senator NeaI,
you Howdy-Doody-Iooking vontz.

1300
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:10,880
As we reported earlier, U.S.
Serviceman Willie Schumann...

1301
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:12,643
remains missing behind
enemy lines...

1302
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:15,048
It`s aII thinking ahead.

1303
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:16,575
That`s what producing is.

1304
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:18,109
It`s Iike being a pIumber.

1305
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:22,481
Do your job right,
nobody shouId notice.

1306
01:01:22,525 --> 01:01:25,426
When you fuck up,
everything gets fuII of shit.

1307
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:27,191
...symbol of
the military team...

1308
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:30,199
Sergeant William Schumann,
the ``Old Shoe.``

1309
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:32,895
Let`s Iine up the president
for the Peace Prize.

1310
01:01:32,936 --> 01:01:34,836
Our job ends on eIection day.

1311
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:36,600
Come on.

1312
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,802
Just for the symmetry
of the thing?

1313
01:01:39,843 --> 01:01:41,105
That`s right.

1314
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:42,907
If Kissinger can win
the Peace Prize...

1315
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:46,211
I wouIdn`t be surprised
if I`d won the Preakness.

1316
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:49,776
But our guy did bring peace.

1317
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:51,343
But there wasn`t a war.

1318
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:53,948
AII the greater accompIishment.

1319
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:13,542
Where`s the money--

1320
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:16,374
where`s the tie-in
with throwing away shoes?

1321
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:18,108
Who pays you for that?

1322
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:20,480
You throw away shoes.
What are you gonna do?

1323
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:21,984
Buy new ones.

1324
01:02:22,018 --> 01:02:24,213
We have some powerfuI
new friends...

1325
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:27,189
at the InternationaI Association
of Shoe Manufacturers.

1326
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:28,884
You guys sure get around.

1327
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:31,052
Fad King is my hero.
Want to go first?

1328
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:32,857
Sure.

1329
01:02:32,896 --> 01:02:35,456
Attaboy.

1330
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:37,159
History, Connie.

1331
01:02:39,135 --> 01:02:40,625
Those are ratty shoes.

1332
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,900
That`s why
we`re fIinging them away.

1333
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:45,931
You want to try some?
Go ahead.

1334
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:47,602
Attaboy.

1335
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:49,509
Do it again.

1336
01:02:49,546 --> 01:02:51,309
Go ahead. Have a baII.

1337
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:57,011
Watch this.

1338
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:01,814
Go on, teII your friends.

1339
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:06,292
This is interesting.

1340
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:10,197
I havejust been handed this.
Something just discovered.

1341
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:13,930
A 1930s recording, part of
the folk song collection...

1342
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,494
Of the Library of Congress...

1343
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:18,905
and a fitting song,
if I may say so, about Shoe.

1344
01:03:18,942 --> 01:03:20,739
Schumann
is the military soldier...

1345
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:22,677
who`s been left behind
enemy lines...

1346
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,118
Jim, can I get a word with you?

1347
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:35,249
Would you like to comment
on Albania?

1348
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:39,225
There is one thing
I`d like to say.

1349
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:43,164
This is to the Albanians
that have this man.

1350
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,498
I mean this from the bottom
of my heart as one of your race.

1351
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:51,701
I didn`t know Jim BeIushi
was AIbanian.

1352
01:03:58,148 --> 01:03:59,979
The search for
Willie Schumann continues...

1353
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:32,346
As soon as we Iand,
I want a refIexoIogist.

1354
01:04:32,382 --> 01:04:33,644
MaIe or femaIe?

1355
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:35,310
The White House
wants to know about...

1356
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:36,613
the CongressionaI MedaI
of Honor.

1357
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,211
-What about it?
-For Schumann.

1358
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:40,848
Wait a minute.
We got 86% in favor.

1359
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,155
We bring him back tomorrow,
charts don`t go down.

1360
01:04:44,194 --> 01:04:45,786
I don`t want to teII them
how to do their business...

1361
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:47,295
but why don`t they do it
after the eIection?

1362
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,560
Makes more sense,
and it`II heIp them more.

1363
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,624
When are you bringing him back?

1364
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:53,636
King, show him the thing.

1365
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,503
-It`s not done yet.
-Show it to him.

1366
01:04:56,539 --> 01:05:00,168
TaIk about enIarging the market.
TeII him.

1367
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,735
Here it is. Artist`s rendering
of the memoriaI.

1368
01:05:02,779 --> 01:05:04,110
The memoriaI?

1369
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:06,707
That`s the memoriaI
of the faIIen.

1370
01:05:06,749 --> 01:05:08,114
Of the AIbanian campaign.

1371
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:10,176
-LoveIy.
-It`s better than IoveIy.

1372
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,279
This guy made a deaI
with Governor Kneehigh--

1373
01:05:12,322 --> 01:05:13,983
Senator Leahy.

1374
01:05:14,023 --> 01:05:16,548
You shouId see the granite
you have to put in this thing.

1375
01:05:16,593 --> 01:05:18,527
Got a site picked out
and everything.

1376
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:20,529
The beauty part is...

1377
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:22,463
guess who retains
the merchandising rights.

1378
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:24,159
Show him the cIock?

1379
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,963
Got it as a cIock.

1380
01:05:26,002 --> 01:05:27,663
LoveIy.

1381
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:29,865
-Let`s go.
-When`s Schumann coming back?

1382
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:31,203
Getting him right now.

1383
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:33,641
I need his neck size.

1384
01:05:33,676 --> 01:05:34,938
I think it`s 17 1l2.

1385
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:37,173
Thinking 17 1l2
is not good enough.

1386
01:05:37,213 --> 01:05:39,807
I`m an artist,
not a factory worker.

1387
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,976
What did he eat
behind enemy Iines?

1388
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:43,610
Birds, snakes.

1389
01:05:43,653 --> 01:05:46,622
BuIIshit. He ate
tiny cheeseburgers in tin foiI.

1390
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:48,055
PuII a string,
they heat themseIves.

1391
01:05:48,091 --> 01:05:50,059
We caII Burger King,
Johnny Rockets.

1392
01:05:50,093 --> 01:05:52,561
We get the Shoe Burger
with cheese and 303 sauce...

1393
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:55,291
``Behind enemy Iines or anytime.``

1394
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:56,798
That`s the sIogan.

1395
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,666
I got the copyright
on the AIbanian kitten thing.

1396
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:01,829
I`m gonna caII Nike,
get Rodman to dye his hair.

1397
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:03,771
We`II have a sneaker--
``Air Leopard.``

1398
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:09,306
...a high school
basketball game last night...

1399
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:12,041
between Montgomery Bell
and Blair Park.

1400
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:13,548
Students, during the game...

1401
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:16,211
in spontaneous moment
of sheer patriotism...

1402
01:06:16,252 --> 01:06:19,517
threw their tennis shoes
on the court by the hundreds,

1403
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,079
just for the Old Shoe.

1404
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:23,888
Bring him back.
William Schumann...

1405
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:25,894
There`s no business Iike it.

1406
01:06:25,928 --> 01:06:28,522
Demonstrations are springing up
all over the country...

1407
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:31,294
as Americans
show their patriotism.

1408
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:34,531
You ought to get them to run
that inauguraI speech by me.

1409
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,470
InauguraI speech?
I don`t know.

1410
01:06:36,506 --> 01:06:38,838
The White House staff
won`t give up that one.

1411
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:42,902
Come on. Let me cIose out
the thing in styIe.

1412
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:45,038
I`ve come to feeI it`s my thing.

1413
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:48,573
You take ajob, and many times,
it`s just ajob...

1414
01:06:50,586 --> 01:06:52,213
HeII of a ride.

1415
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:53,813
Isn`t it?

1416
01:06:53,856 --> 01:06:55,414
You take the bitter
with the sweet...

1417
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:57,153
or the sweet with the bitter.

1418
01:06:57,193 --> 01:06:58,490
What`s that expression?

1419
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:05,165
...feeling good
about the economy.

1420
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:07,135
That`s why we`re voting
for the president, Ed.

1421
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,467
What do you think?

1422
01:07:08,504 --> 01:07:12,907
Bob, my mind wasn`t
100% made up, but now it is.

1423
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:16,605
Don`t go changing horses
in midstream.

1424
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:19,876
Absolutely.

1425
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:22,817
Who needs surprises these days?

1426
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:24,342
For an economy
you can rely on...

1427
01:07:24,387 --> 01:07:26,150
Fucking amateurs.

1428
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:31,351
Pity of it is, two more days,
and we bring it back home.

1429
01:07:31,394 --> 01:07:32,486
Knock wood.

1430
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:34,752
Who`s gonna know?

1431
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:37,589
Who`s gonna know what we did?

1432
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:40,426
Pride of ajob weII done, Stan.

1433
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:43,701
It`s the pride of ajob
weII done, but it`s more.

1434
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:48,367
It`s the gratitude of your party
and your president, right?

1435
01:07:49,212 --> 01:07:51,703
-Is that the thing?
-Indeed it is.

1436
01:07:54,016 --> 01:07:57,110
Dean City, OkIahoma.
Army speciaI programs.

1437
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,848
TeII `em to bring
Schumann to the pIane.

1438
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:01,322
We`II bring him back
and stash him in the hospitaI.

1439
01:08:01,357 --> 01:08:04,451
CaII the pIane.
TeII me where to pick him up.

1440
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:06,519
I bet you`re good at chess.

1441
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,255
I wouId be, I couId remember
how aII the pieces move.

1442
01:08:10,933 --> 01:08:12,332
We`II caII you.

1443
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:18,373
I`ll do the same
in His great name...

1444
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:21,377
if you have courage, Mom.

1445
01:08:22,545 --> 01:08:26,675
I can always feel your love.

1446
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:30,713
Send, and I`ll receive.

1447
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:35,323
Units of 303,
the Defense Department...

1448
01:08:35,358 --> 01:08:37,383
confirmed earIy this morning,
AIbanian time...

1449
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:41,261
stormed the mountain hideaway
near the city of...

1450
01:08:41,297 --> 01:08:44,198
freeing a tired but happy
WiIIiam Schumann.

1451
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:46,463
A high White House source
confirms...

1452
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,198
that he`s expected
in Washington tomorrow morning.

1453
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:50,500
How`s that?

1454
01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:59,211
When we touch down tomorrow...

1455
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:00,875
Big Bird meets Schumann
at the airport?

1456
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,715
Big mistake. You got to bring
him in by stages.

1457
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:06,654
Big mistake to reveaI
Schumann before the eIection.

1458
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:07,951
How so?

1459
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,584
Sweetheart,
Schumann is the shark.

1460
01:09:10,626 --> 01:09:12,594
Schumann is Jaws.

1461
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:15,028
You have to tease `em.

1462
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:18,397
You don`t put Jaws
in the first reeI of the movie.

1463
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,402
It`s the contract, sweetheart.

1464
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:23,234
The contract with the eIection,
whether they know it or not...

1465
01:09:23,272 --> 01:09:25,240
is vote for me Tuesday...

1466
01:09:25,274 --> 01:09:27,538
Wednesday,
I wiII produce Schumann.

1467
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:29,704
That`s what they`re paying
their seven bucks for.

1468
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:31,303
Know what I mean?

1469
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:33,110
Whatever.

1470
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:34,616
Everybody`s gotta Iearn.

1471
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,174
Any business.

1472
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:39,449
You take the fruit
of 40 years...

1473
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:41,753
hard Iessons, mistakes,
and you caII it wisdom.

1474
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:43,019
That`s the truth.

1475
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:45,493
End of the day,
just when you know something...

1476
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:47,086
time to go home.

1477
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:49,393
You got decades in you now.

1478
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:51,559
You got decades Ieft in you.

1479
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:52,761
Yeah, but...

1480
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:56,202
What couId I do to top this?

1481
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,808
The 37th Psalm.

1482
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:06,543
I`ll do the same
in His great name...

1483
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:09,380
if you have courage, Mom.

1484
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:12,251
You see her?
That was reaI tears.

1485
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:14,518
We were gonna give her
those drops.

1486
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:16,684
-She cried.
-ReaIIy?

1487
01:10:16,726 --> 01:10:19,160
-She cried reaI.
-It Iooks it.

1488
01:10:19,195 --> 01:10:21,663
Pray for me...

1489
01:10:21,697 --> 01:10:24,029
and the USA.

1490
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:27,467
Pray they never use the bomb.

1491
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:31,399
What are you going
to do after this?

1492
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,067
They owe you big.

1493
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:35,543
Ambassador to this or that,
whatever.

1494
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,045
Ambassador to what?

1495
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:38,910
I don`t even Iike to go
to Brentwood.

1496
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:43,509
That`s what I want.

1497
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:45,020
That`s my reward.

1498
01:10:45,054 --> 01:10:46,282
That`s the payoff.

1499
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:48,620
You want to go to the InauguraI?

1500
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:51,354
Might if I was asked.

1501
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,877
This here, Schumann and us...

1502
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:18,352
Look at that.
King Kong and the trainers.

1503
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:20,321
This is it.

1504
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:25,425
I`m standing with this picture
of Sergeant Willie Schumann.

1505
01:11:25,461 --> 01:11:29,261
He`s become known to Americans
simply as the Old Shoe...

1506
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:31,391
This is gonna be a masterpiece.

1507
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:33,231
Giving them what they want.

1508
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:36,864
...his Group 303 and left behind
in enemy territory.

1509
01:11:36,906 --> 01:11:39,374
Here at
Andrews Air Force Base...

1510
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:41,239
they prepare for the return
of Willie Schumann.

1511
01:11:48,384 --> 01:11:51,751
Sergeant Schumann, if I may,
weIcome to history.

1512
01:11:51,787 --> 01:11:53,584
Sergeant Schumann, I`m Ames.

1513
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:55,284
Somebody named Brean?

1514
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:56,791
Right here.

1515
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:58,521
Sign here for me.

1516
01:12:00,196 --> 01:12:02,528
Captain,
you want to take her up?

1517
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:03,964
There`s heavy weather back east.

1518
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,297
What do you think?

1519
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:07,859
6 to 5 and pick `em.
You want to chance it?

1520
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:10,030
If it`II fIy, Iet`s fIy.
PeopIe are waiting.

1521
01:12:15,778 --> 01:12:18,110
A chiId at the airport
breaks through the ranks...

1522
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:21,947
runs to OId Shoe,
rubs meat on Schumann`s cuff.

1523
01:12:21,984 --> 01:12:24,544
A IittIe dog runs to it.
The dog Ioves Schumann.

1524
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,953
He is a perfect war hero.

1525
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:28,388
Perfect.

1526
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:30,289
You cast him.

1527
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:31,987
AII right. Book it up.

1528
01:12:35,197 --> 01:12:36,596
What`s this?

1529
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,327
Keys to the manacIes.

1530
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:43,401
Oh, my God.

1531
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:45,339
Wait.

1532
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:55,677
What is the troubIe?

1533
01:12:55,718 --> 01:12:58,209
No troubIe at aII, ma`am.

1534
01:12:58,254 --> 01:13:00,119
Then why is he in chains?

1535
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:03,148
He`s in chains
because he`s a convict.

1536
01:13:04,393 --> 01:13:05,655
A convict?

1537
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:11,291
How you doing?

1538
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:26,408
Take a Iook.

1539
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:34,485
When we asked
for speciaI programs...

1540
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:36,218
they gave us speciaI prisons.

1541
01:13:36,258 --> 01:13:38,351
OnIy a one-word difference.

1542
01:13:38,394 --> 01:13:41,124
-Has he been in jaiI Iong?
-12 years.

1543
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:42,562
Does he have much Ionger
to serve?

1544
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:45,861
What did he do?

1545
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:47,664
He raped a nun.

1546
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:52,039
-And...
-I don`t want to know an ``and.``

1547
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:53,041
Why is there an ``and``?

1548
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:57,239
He`s fine as Iong
as he gets his medications.

1549
01:13:57,279 --> 01:13:59,213
And if he doesn`t?

1550
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:00,545
He`s not fine.

1551
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:05,219
Up there, Captain.

1552
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:08,919
You`d better get us
to Washington.

1553
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:15,692
How are ya?

1554
01:14:17,566 --> 01:14:19,056
Fine.

1555
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:30,702
Gonna get me back tomorrow?

1556
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:34,307
`Cause, you know, tomorrow
they`re having beans.

1557
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,875
I need a readjustment.
We have to rethink this.

1558
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:38,318
Beans!

1559
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:40,288
We`re trying to do this thing.

1560
01:14:40,322 --> 01:14:43,758
As Iong as you
get me back for the beans.

1561
01:14:43,793 --> 01:14:45,818
He`s sicker than we thought.

1562
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,490
Rush him under wraps
to WaIter Reed for tests.

1563
01:14:49,532 --> 01:14:52,729
If you`re gonna keep me out,
I`d Iike to go to church.

1564
01:14:52,768 --> 01:14:54,167
You know what I mean?

1565
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,535
Are you very reIigious?

1566
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:03,706
What have you done to me?

1567
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:09,241
AII combat takes pIace
at night in the rain...

1568
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:10,809
at the junction
of four map segments.

1569
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:12,252
What are you going to do?

1570
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:14,256
He`s fine as Iong
as he gets his medication.

1571
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:18,249
Speaking of that,
we`re gonna need Iots of this.

1572
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:20,125
Get on the phone and get it.

1573
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:22,790
You peopIe are Iooking
at this wrong.

1574
01:15:22,832 --> 01:15:24,800
If you Iook at the back story...

1575
01:15:24,834 --> 01:15:26,927
the guy is coming back
from combat and torture...

1576
01:15:26,969 --> 01:15:28,903
of course he`s going to be
a IittIe fucked up.

1577
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:31,605
He`s gonna need heIp.

1578
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:35,235
Anybody want a beer?
`Cause I couId party.

1579
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:37,142
I`m gonna need an ambuIance.

1580
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:38,942
We take him the Iast moment
from the pIane.

1581
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:42,849
We Iand, take him
from the pIane to the ambuIance.

1582
01:15:42,885 --> 01:15:45,979
Air Force jet Iands, we take
somebody eIse from that jet.

1583
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:48,216
What the fuck do I care?

1584
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:49,815
Somebody in a hospitaI gown.

1585
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:51,520
You get me back for the beans.

1586
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,027
`Cause tomorrow`s the beans.

1587
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:54,654
`Cause this dog
ain`t gonna hunt.

1588
01:15:54,697 --> 01:15:57,097
He`s gonna be fine.

1589
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:58,394
Aren`t you, WiIIiam?

1590
01:15:58,434 --> 01:16:00,959
Speaking of which,
I have a prescription here.

1591
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:03,335
I want you standing by
with a Iot of this stuff.

1592
01:16:03,372 --> 01:16:05,237
A crate of it. It`s...

1593
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:08,807
Anti-psychotic.

1594
01:16:09,678 --> 01:16:11,270
The number is V--

1595
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:14,611
This is nothing.

1596
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,641
I used to think
I was a pharmacist...

1597
01:16:16,685 --> 01:16:18,016
the stuff I carried.

1598
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:21,614
With the beans, you can teII
if they`re puttin` stuff in it.

1599
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:25,524
So you don`t have to fear it.

1600
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:28,228
What kind of stuff?

1601
01:16:31,066 --> 01:16:33,296
What do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1602
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:38,730
He just wanted to know
what you meant.

1603
01:16:38,774 --> 01:16:40,241
Did you mean?

1604
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:42,403
-I didn`t.
-He didn`t mean.

1605
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:44,878
-He didn`t mean anything.
-You meant something.

1606
01:16:44,914 --> 01:16:46,142
He didn`t mean anything.

1607
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:47,773
Give him another piII.

1608
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:51,650
What the fuck do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1609
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:53,848
PiII, WiIIiam.

1610
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:57,157
This is nothing.
Did you ever shoot in ItaIy?

1611
01:16:57,192 --> 01:17:00,525
Try three starIets swacked-out
on Benzedrine and grappa.

1612
01:17:00,562 --> 01:17:02,496
This is nothing.

1613
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:04,624
This is a waIk in the park.

1614
01:17:07,202 --> 01:17:08,533
Who are you?

1615
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:10,299
Who are you sons of bitches?

1616
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:12,899
-KiIIers!
-Just caIm down.

1617
01:17:12,942 --> 01:17:14,739
Where are you taking me?

1618
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:20,145
Oh, my God!

1619
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:26,314
Sergeant Willie Schumann
is coming home.

1620
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,846
Schumann`s plane should be
over the Atlantic Ocean...

1621
01:17:28,891 --> 01:17:31,621
making its final descent
back into this country.

1622
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,957
The White House reported...

1623
01:17:32,995 --> 01:17:36,192
he was safely rescued
and on his way to American soil.

1624
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:38,199
We`re still waiting
for his plane...

1625
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:39,791
at Andrews Air Force Base.

1626
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:43,100
A plane that is due to land.
Long overdue.

1627
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:45,868
The president is monitoring
the situation...

1628
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:47,876
personally and closely.

1629
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:50,242
We will keep you updated
as to any developments.

1630
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:51,576
Thank you very much.

1631
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:54,104
Oh, God.
What do we do now?

1632
01:17:55,351 --> 01:17:57,444
What do we do now, boy producer?

1633
01:17:57,486 --> 01:18:00,011
Mister win-an-Emmy,
sociaI-conscience, whaIe-shit...

1634
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:02,489
save-the-rain-forest,
peacenik-commie...

1635
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:04,754
fuckin`-hire-a-convict shithead?

1636
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:08,092
What do we do now, IiberaI,
affirmative action, shithead...

1637
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,791
peacenik commie fuck?

1638
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:14,630
This is nothing.
Piece of cake.

1639
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:17,400
Producing
is being a samurai warrior.

1640
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:19,134
They pay you day in,
day out for years...

1641
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:21,836
so that one day,
when caIIed upon...

1642
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:24,846
you can respond,
your training at its peak...

1643
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,507
and save the day!

1644
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:31,980
Produce this Schumann.

1645
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:33,682
Produce him, I say...

1646
01:18:33,722 --> 01:18:35,246
or, and I don`t hesitate
to say this...

1647
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:39,750
rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.

1648
01:18:39,795 --> 01:18:43,595
This tardy absence of the flight
must give us pause...

1649
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:48,160
and in that pause, we should
take time to examine ourselves--

1650
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:49,636
Fuck you.

1651
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:51,832
Leave it aIone.
What did teIevision do to you?

1652
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:54,502
It destroyed
the eIectoraI process.

1653
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:57,637
Enough Iovemaking.
Let`s go. Come on.

1654
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,807
-Where?
-We got work to do.

1655
01:19:00,849 --> 01:19:02,316
Come on, paI.

1656
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:03,818
Is it time for exercise?

1657
01:19:03,852 --> 01:19:05,843
It`s my day in the yard.

1658
01:19:05,888 --> 01:19:07,617
Let`s get him to the highway.

1659
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:10,056
Think this is tough?
Come on, paI!

1660
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:12,424
This is nothing! Piece of cake!

1661
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:14,156
AIbanian dissidents...

1662
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:17,063
having somehow obtained
a surface-to-air missiIe...

1663
01:19:17,099 --> 01:19:19,567
You had your fortune here.

1664
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:21,535
You were ready to throw it away.

1665
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:24,835
If you got a probIem, soIve it.
That`s producing.

1666
01:19:24,873 --> 01:19:28,172
Someday when they
teII this story--

1667
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:29,677
You can`t teII this story.

1668
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:32,202
-Why not?
-Somebody wouId have you kiIIed.

1669
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:34,647
Of course, I know.

1670
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:38,483
Not now. But when
they do teII the story--

1671
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,648
Nobody can teII this story,
ever.

1672
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:46,322
Listen to me.
This is what I do for a Iiving.

1673
01:19:47,229 --> 01:19:49,390
You can`t teII this story.
He`s not kidding you.

1674
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:51,558
You can`t teII this story.
You knew that.

1675
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,693
The deaI was you get
an ambassadorship.

1676
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:57,062
I used to have a Camaro.

1677
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:59,700
What are you going to teII?
The guy`s a nut case.

1678
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:01,936
You wouId be too if you went
through what he went through.

1679
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:03,444
He raped a nun.

1680
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:04,707
What he went through in AIbania.

1681
01:20:04,746 --> 01:20:06,077
He`s doped to the giIIs.

1682
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:07,480
Where`s my IittIe piIIs?

1683
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:08,744
Show some compassion.

1684
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:11,082
He spent the Iast 12 years
in a miIitary prison.

1685
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,281
How are we gonna expIain that?

1686
01:20:13,322 --> 01:20:15,688
ExpIain it? Am I worried?

1687
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:17,624
How do we expIain that
when the worId is watching?

1688
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:20,127
Fuck the worId.
Try a 10 a.m. pitch meeting...

1689
01:20:20,162 --> 01:20:22,630
cooked to the giIIs, and you
haven`t read the treatment.

1690
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:24,689
How do we expIain
he was in prison?

1691
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:27,166
WeII, you see, Winifred...

1692
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,500
this is where
you`ve never been at a pitch.

1693
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:30,937
His records say he was
in prison...

1694
01:20:30,973 --> 01:20:34,136
as they say for aII the men
and women of Group 303...

1695
01:20:34,176 --> 01:20:37,907
as they must
because of the secrecy invoIved.

1696
01:20:55,697 --> 01:20:57,130
I`m on top of it.

1697
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:59,191
Not sure whether enemy action...

1698
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:00,701
I`m fine. I got it.

1699
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:04,933
StanIey, I toId you,
I do this for a Iiving.

1700
01:21:04,973 --> 01:21:06,600
You do what for a Iiving?

1701
01:21:06,642 --> 01:21:08,269
ExactIy what do you do
for the president?

1702
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:10,642
I Iost my waIIet.
You got any change?

1703
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,339
How we doing, boy?

1704
01:21:14,383 --> 01:21:15,907
Ready to mix it up?

1705
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:17,782
Is today Iaundry day?

1706
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:20,788
-What do you do on Iaundry day?
-Laundry.

1707
01:21:20,822 --> 01:21:23,484
Stand by to copy this.
Just get a penciI.

1708
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:24,992
Down safeIy.

1709
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:27,154
Produce this Schumann.

1710
01:21:27,196 --> 01:21:30,529
Produce him, I say, or, and
I don`t hesitate to say this...

1711
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:34,696
rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.

1712
01:21:34,736 --> 01:21:36,203
Sustained minor injuries.

1713
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:38,638
FIight crew being investigated
for possibIe piIot error.

1714
01:21:38,674 --> 01:21:40,699
Transshipped
to an undiscIosed Iocation.

1715
01:21:42,244 --> 01:21:45,543
This deserted runway should be
filled with well-wishers.

1716
01:21:45,581 --> 01:21:48,880
How you doing?
A coId drink?

1717
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:51,408
Schumann was to return
to American soil today...

1718
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:53,478
after his safe rescue
in Albania.

1719
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:56,553
He Iooks Iike me.

1720
01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:00,886
...deserves an explanation
from the White House.

1721
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:05,093
Wait, we are now going
live to the White House.

1722
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,601
I have an update regarding
the aircraft incident...

1723
01:22:07,636 --> 01:22:09,297
involving Sergeant Schumann.

1724
01:22:09,338 --> 01:22:12,034
He is down safely
and will be transshipped.

1725
01:22:12,074 --> 01:22:14,838
We are informed he has sustained
minor injuries...

1726
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:16,707
which will require his being
medicated for some time...

1727
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:18,838
Bring in the cavaIry.
Nick of time.

1728
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:23,046
PoIiticaI shitbirds.
Fuck with us, huh?

1729
01:22:23,085 --> 01:22:24,677
They don`t know
who they`re pIaying with.

1730
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:31,122
Purty.

1731
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:34,794
I`m a IittIe concerned
about the driver of the rig.

1732
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,320
-What rig?
-The harvester.

1733
01:22:36,365 --> 01:22:39,391
-What about him?
-He doesn`t have his green card.

1734
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:45,864
So what?

1735
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:49,502
You want Schumann to be
rescued by an iIIegaI aIien?

1736
01:22:49,544 --> 01:22:52,604
We can`t have Schumann saved
by an iIIegaI immigrant.

1737
01:22:52,648 --> 01:22:54,616
Get on the phone.
FIy in ajudge.

1738
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:57,141
Get on the phone.
What`s aII this moping about?

1739
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,019
Do you have any change?

1740
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:10,396
I Iike the night Iife,
I Iike to boogie.

1741
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:13,727
Susie!

1742
01:23:13,769 --> 01:23:15,100
WiIIiam?

1743
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:16,968
Are you aII right?

1744
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:22,374
KickbaII.

1745
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:31,042
Let me taIk to him!

1746
01:23:31,086 --> 01:23:32,553
What are you doing?

1747
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:33,952
I think we shouId--

1748
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:37,322
WiIIie, where are you going?

1749
01:23:38,593 --> 01:23:40,060
Shoester!

1750
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:48,358
Let me taIk to him.
Shoe, you in there?

1751
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:50,667
I`II kiII that son of a bitch.

1752
01:23:50,706 --> 01:23:53,675
I have a reIationship.
You want to taIk?

1753
01:23:53,709 --> 01:23:56,234
Get you anything you want.
You want some beans?

1754
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:57,575
WiII that do it, Shoester?

1755
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:01,313
Come on, Shoe!

1756
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:05,578
He`s dead.

1757
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:15,290
Wait a minute.

1758
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,525
He`s not dead. He`s aIive.

1759
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:20,199
Strike that.

1760
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,900
So cIose and yet so far.

1761
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:30,241
What do you mean?

1762
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:31,677
We were this cIose.

1763
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:33,977
This is nothing.

1764
01:24:34,015 --> 01:24:35,243
This just got big.

1765
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:37,274
Big? He`s dead.

1766
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:38,684
We kiIIed OId Shoe.

1767
01:24:40,088 --> 01:24:42,989
What is better than
the triumphaI homecoming...

1768
01:24:43,024 --> 01:24:44,719
of a war hero?

1769
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:52,292
Ready!

1770
01:24:53,068 --> 01:24:54,194
Lift!

1771
01:24:54,236 --> 01:24:56,363
We`re gathered here...

1772
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:59,974
with a cross to bear.

1773
01:25:00,008 --> 01:25:02,169
The bravest men...

1774
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:05,541
anywhere.

1775
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,472
That this great land...

1776
01:25:08,517 --> 01:25:12,146
will remain free.

1777
01:25:12,187 --> 01:25:13,848
God bless the men...

1778
01:25:13,889 --> 01:25:17,757
of the 303.

1779
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:20,954
Side by side...

1780
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:23,965
we know no fear.

1781
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:26,968
Our minds are sharp.

1782
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:29,937
Our eyes are clear.

1783
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:32,997
In the air, on land...

1784
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:35,874
or on the sea...

1785
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:38,141
we`re the fightin` men...

1786
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,775
of the 303.

1787
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,853
Give us this day...

1788
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:50,949
our daily bread...

1789
01:25:50,992 --> 01:25:53,290
and leopard skin...

1790
01:25:54,296 --> 01:25:56,924
for our head.

1791
01:25:56,965 --> 01:25:59,058
That we may fight...

1792
01:26:07,242 --> 01:26:08,470
Coffee?

1793
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:09,909
PIease.

1794
01:26:09,945 --> 01:26:12,038
Looking good.

1795
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,275
Bring it aII back home.

1796
01:26:14,316 --> 01:26:16,978
Lassie barks twice, and it`s
time to take out the garbage.

1797
01:26:17,018 --> 01:26:18,576
HeII of a show.

1798
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,019
HeII of ajob.

1799
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,716
It`s just producing.

1800
01:26:21,756 --> 01:26:24,748
There`s no Academy Award
for producing.

1801
01:26:24,793 --> 01:26:26,124
You`re kidding.

1802
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:29,727
Where do movies come from
if nobody produces them?

1803
01:26:31,032 --> 01:26:32,761
They come from peopIe Iike you.

1804
01:26:36,338 --> 01:26:38,135
You just got to take
the bitter with the better.

1805
01:26:38,173 --> 01:26:40,664
Job`s aImost done--

1806
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:41,869
knock on wood.

1807
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:44,141
We did a good job.

1808
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:45,476
That`s our reward.

1809
01:26:47,048 --> 01:26:48,743
You can`t save the worId.

1810
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:50,114
AII you can do is try.

1811
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,550
Ain`t that the truth?

1812
01:26:58,126 --> 01:26:59,855
As we said, the president--

1813
01:26:59,895 --> 01:27:02,557
thrust of the Albanian episode
to put him over the top.

1814
01:27:02,597 --> 01:27:05,691
You could say that, Shirley,
but it`s not true.

1815
01:27:05,734 --> 01:27:07,099
What would be true, then?

1816
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:09,296
You said it earlier,
if I may rephrase...

1817
01:27:09,337 --> 01:27:11,498
the success
of the president in the polls--

1818
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:15,840
As of today, 89% favorable.

1819
01:27:15,877 --> 01:27:18,437
Based not on the events...

1820
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,040
but on the spin
given to those events.

1821
01:27:21,082 --> 01:27:24,518
What`s the Iesson here?
Never give up.

1822
01:27:24,553 --> 01:27:25,781
You`re right.

1823
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,253
The show must go on.

1824
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:28,517
Proud tradition.

1825
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:32,891
I am prouder of this
than anything I ever did.

1826
01:27:32,928 --> 01:27:34,156
You shouId be.

1827
01:27:34,195 --> 01:27:35,662
I want to thank you.

1828
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:40,766
You gave me a good opportunity.

1829
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:47,836
As we said, the president,
a surefire winner...

1830
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:50,777
and the campaign, many said,
that put him there.

1831
01:27:51,446 --> 01:27:53,471
Another great race today,
Johnny.

1832
01:27:53,515 --> 01:27:55,813
Who you going to ride
in the Stakes?

1833
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:58,614
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

1834
01:27:58,653 --> 01:27:59,847
The message is irrelevant.

1835
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:01,879
The main element
we have to deal with...

1836
01:28:01,923 --> 01:28:04,448
is that fear is
what`s driving a lot of people.

1837
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:06,289
Commercials.

1838
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:09,959
The president is a product.

1839
01:28:10,799 --> 01:28:13,700
He`s the President
of the United States at 89%.

1840
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:15,430
Which we`re dealing with today.

1841
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:16,937
Commercials.

1842
01:28:18,306 --> 01:28:21,104
It`s time the American people
began to look at that.

1843
01:28:21,142 --> 01:28:24,111
Now we`re going
to take your calls.

1844
01:28:24,145 --> 01:28:25,669
The number is 1-800...

1845
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:27,909
Oh, shit.

1846
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:38,921
StanIey, what are you doing?

1847
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,257
What am I doing?

1848
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:43,324
I`m going to caII somebody.

1849
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:45,963
That`s very funny.

1850
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:47,662
I`m going to get
these peopIe straight.

1851
01:28:47,702 --> 01:28:49,226
You can`t do that.

1852
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:51,568
Watch me.

1853
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:56,868
You knew the deaI
when you signed on.

1854
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:58,936
Come on. DeaIs change.

1855
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,743
Sure it is.

1856
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:03,808
Let`s rethink
that ambassadorship.

1857
01:29:03,852 --> 01:29:05,843
I`m taIking London.
I`m taIking Paris.

1858
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:08,185
A secret account
for your extra expenses...

1859
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:09,656
getting Iaid whenever you want.

1860
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:11,124
Marine guards wiII saIute you.

1861
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:14,026
It`s tempting, but I got
to answer to a higher caIIing.

1862
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:16,030
-Art.
-Money?

1863
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,157
You think I did this for money?

1864
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:20,895
I did this for credit.

1865
01:29:20,935 --> 01:29:22,368
You knew
you couIdn`t take the credit.

1866
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:23,871
I`m not going to stand here...

1867
01:29:23,905 --> 01:29:26,339
and Iet two dickheads
from fiIm schooI take it.

1868
01:29:26,374 --> 01:29:28,239
Listen to me.

1869
01:29:28,276 --> 01:29:29,504
Are you nuts?

1870
01:29:29,544 --> 01:29:30,841
StanIey, no fooIing.

1871
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:32,540
You`re pIaying with your Iife.

1872
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,911
Fuck my Iife.

1873
01:29:33,948 --> 01:29:35,916
I want the credit.

1874
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:38,475
Know what the New York Times
said about my Iast picture?

1875
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,283
They caIIed it
``a thriII ride for the ages...``

1876
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:41,811
but they didn`t mention
the producer.

1877
01:29:41,856 --> 01:29:44,017
They taIked
about the costumes...

1878
01:29:44,059 --> 01:29:45,583
but never taIked
about the producer.

1879
01:29:45,627 --> 01:29:46,855
You know what
that picture grossed?

1880
01:29:46,895 --> 01:29:48,123
Now I`m going to stand here...

1881
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:50,324
and Iet some Iimp-dick
fiIm-schooI pansy...

1882
01:29:50,365 --> 01:29:51,593
take the credit?

1883
01:29:51,633 --> 01:29:53,100
You can`t do it.

1884
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:55,102
Don`t you teII me that!

1885
01:29:55,136 --> 01:29:57,536
Don`t you ever teII me that!

1886
01:29:57,572 --> 01:29:59,335
I am the producer!

1887
01:29:59,374 --> 01:30:01,433
If I didn`t step up,
you`re nowhere!

1888
01:30:01,476 --> 01:30:04,036
I put this together
out of spit and poIish!

1889
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:06,013
Look at that.

1890
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:08,572
That is a compIete
fucking fraud...

1891
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:11,983
and it Iooks 100% reaI.

1892
01:30:17,959 --> 01:30:21,019
It`s the best work
I`ve ever done in my Iife...

1893
01:30:21,062 --> 01:30:23,257
because it`s so honest.

1894
01:30:31,272 --> 01:30:33,240
They toId me I couIdn`t
remake Moby Dick...

1895
01:30:33,274 --> 01:30:34,866
from the point of view
of the whaIe.

1896
01:30:34,909 --> 01:30:36,740
$450 miIIion domestic.

1897
01:30:36,778 --> 01:30:38,245
I`m not even taIking
about the video.

1898
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:40,406
I made this Iame turkey fIy.

1899
01:30:40,448 --> 01:30:42,040
I did it--pure HoIIywood.

1900
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:47,176
For once in my Iife,
I won`t be pissed on.

1901
01:30:47,222 --> 01:30:48,416
Do you hear me?

1902
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:51,252
I want the credit.

1903
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,095
I`m taking it.

1904
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:56,825
Shit.

1905
01:31:11,246 --> 01:31:13,271
He`s coming down.

1906
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:15,680
CouId I see you a minute?
Thanks.

1907
01:31:19,654 --> 01:31:20,780
Do you swear to uphoId...

1908
01:31:20,822 --> 01:31:22,289
the duties
and responsibiIities...

1909
01:31:22,323 --> 01:31:25,053
of a citizen of
the United States of America--

1910
01:31:25,093 --> 01:31:27,061
to defend her
in time of periI...

1911
01:31:27,095 --> 01:31:30,553
to defend her from aII enemies,
foreign and domestic?

1912
01:31:30,598 --> 01:31:33,260
Do you make this pIedge
with fuII resoIve?

1913
01:31:51,085 --> 01:31:53,485
Common ground...

1914
01:31:53,521 --> 01:31:56,786
and family.

1915
01:31:56,825 --> 01:31:58,292
Let`s give thanks...

1916
01:31:58,326 --> 01:32:02,729
to the 303.

1917
01:32:02,764 --> 01:32:05,426
Years from now...

1918
01:32:05,466 --> 01:32:08,435
when we are gone...

1919
01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:11,438
our children`s kids...

1920
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:14,839
will hear this song.

1921
01:32:14,876 --> 01:32:17,504
Think how strong...

1922
01:32:17,545 --> 01:32:20,878
and proud they`ll be.

1923
01:32:20,915 --> 01:32:22,280
Grandpa fought...

1924
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:26,549
for the 303.

1925
01:32:26,588 --> 01:32:29,079
God bless the men...

1926
01:32:29,123 --> 01:32:37,155
of the 303.

1927
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:39,923
Ten-hut!

1928
01:32:39,968 --> 01:32:42,368
Present arms!

1929
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:54,076
Turning to the Hollywood page...

1930
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:57,016
famed film producer
Stanley R. Motss...

1931
01:32:57,051 --> 01:32:59,451
died suddenly
of a massive heart attack...

1932
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:01,614
while sunbathing poolside.

1933
01:33:01,656 --> 01:33:05,319
Mr. Motss
was 57 or 62-years-old...

1934
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,385
depending on the bio.

1935
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:09,623
His credits
include numerous films...

1936
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:14,363
which America has come
to love as old classics.

1937
01:33:18,539 --> 01:33:19,767
This just in.

1938
01:33:19,807 --> 01:33:22,207
A group calling itself
``Albania Unite...``

1939
01:33:22,243 --> 01:33:24,768
has claimed responsibility
for the bombing moments ago...

1940
01:33:24,812 --> 01:33:26,643
of the village of Klos, Albania.

1941
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:28,410
The president
was unavailable for comment...

1942
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:31,179
but General William Scott
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

1943
01:33:31,219 --> 01:33:33,653
says he has no doubt we`ll
be sending planes and troops...

1944
01:33:33,688 --> 01:33:35,212
back in to finish thejob.
