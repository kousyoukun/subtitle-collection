1
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:46,708
<i>Another great race today,
Johnny.</i>

2
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:49,110
<i>Who are you gonna
ride in the Stakes?</i>

3
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,775
<i>Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...</i>

4
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:54,341
<i>and I live by it...</i>

5
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:56,683
<i>"Never change horses
in midstream."</i>

6
00:00:56,721 --> 00:01:01,090
<i>Never change horses.
Sounds like a smart bet.</i>

7
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:04,391
<i>Always stick with a winner.</i>

8
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:06,957
<i>Keep America working.</i>

9
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,858
<i>Don't change horses
in midstream.</i>

10
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:13,666
<i>On election day,
reelect the president.</i>

11
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,485
<i>Can you step this way,
Mr. Brean?</i>

12
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:32,318
<i>Lift your arms, please.</i>

13
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,855
<i>That's him.
That's Mr. Fix-it.</i>

14
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:54,499
<i>It's right here.</i>

15
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:06,611
You have a seat here, Connie.

16
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:08,642
<i>He doesn't know anything.</i>

17
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:16,022
<i>John Levy's staff,
his assistant...</i>

18
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,119
and Amy Cain, Press.

19
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:26,198
<i>Thank you.
That'll be all.</i>

20
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:28,603
- Want some coffee?
- Black, please.

21
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,301
Gaviston, bring some coffee.
Black.

22
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,268
You kids in this room...

23
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,441
what you hear and say here...

24
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,145
if it gets out, you leaked it.

25
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:42,447
Tell them
what they need to know.

26
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,513
<i>When it broke, the president
said, "Get me Conrad Brean."</i>

27
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,721
<i>What's the thing?</i>

28
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,958
He had an illegal immigrant
nanny years back?

29
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:56,626
You get ahead in the polls,
suddenly you get nervous.

30
00:03:56,667 --> 00:04:00,068
He made a pass
at some secretary years ago?

31
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:02,698
A group of Firefly Girls
were here last month.

32
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,231
One expressed interest
in a Frederic Remington bust.

33
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:08,109
They went in the office
behind the Oval Office.

34
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:10,706
<i>It couldn't have
been over three minutes.</i>

35
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,807
The Secret Service
will confirm that.

36
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,215
<i>It's not the illegal
immigrant nanny thing?</i>

37
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,349
<i>The girl's alleging...</i>

38
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,021
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

39
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:27,724
Maybe we could say it was
a drug reaction to the flu.

40
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:29,062
<i>Who's got the story?</i>

41
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,590
<i>Don't you want to know
if it's true?</i>

42
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:31,966
<i>What's the difference?</i>

43
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,437
<i>It's a story.
They'll run with it.</i>

44
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:35,905
How long till it breaks?

45
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,931
Front page,
Washington Post, tomorrow.

46
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,170
<i>That's not good.</i>

47
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,305
- Where is he?
- China.

48
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:45,212
When is he due back?

49
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:48,047
<i>They're set to leave soon.</i>

50
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,519
He stays on the ground
in China at least another day.

51
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:55,492
Why?

52
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,016
You the Press Office?

53
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:58,722
<i>Earn your money.
He's ill.</i>

54
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,196
When do we bring him back?

55
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:02,893
<i>I'm gonna need a day.</i>

56
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,902
<i>He's sick.
Get that out now.</i>

57
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:07,063
Tell the jackals how sick he is.

58
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:10,096
We gotta get that out
before the story breaks.

59
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,473
<i>Issue a bulletin.
He's got some rare strain...</i>

60
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,377
<i>- Won't hold.
- I need running time.</i>

61
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,710
<i>It won't hold a day.</i>

62
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:18,476
<i>It will.
I'll tell you why.</i>

63
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:19,983
Why is the president in China?

64
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,315
<i>- Trade relations.
- You're right.</i>

65
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:24,651
<i>It's got nothing to do
with the B-3 bomber.</i>

66
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,318
- There is no B-3 bomber.
- I just said that.

67
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,827
<i>I don't know why
these rumors get started.</i>

68
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,097
I need $20,000.
I need a car.

69
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:36,997
Get me a car and driver.

70
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:38,661
The southwest gate.

71
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,402
What?

72
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:44,805
What is it?

73
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:47,242
Campaign commercial.
Should we look at it?

74
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:50,247
Put it in.
This should be interesting.

75
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:52,681
What is it?

76
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:54,685
<i>The other side's new commercial.</i>

77
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:55,947
The Neal commercial.

78
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:57,955
We had somebody steal it.

79
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,856
<i>This'll be on the air
the day after tomorrow.</i>

80
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,725
<i>In the final days
of the campaign...</i>

81
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:05,661
<i>has the president
changed his tune?</i>

82
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:08,995
<i>Thank heaven for little girls.</i>

83
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,365
<i>The presidency is about honor.</i>

84
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:14,860
<i>Thank heaven for little girls.</i>

85
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,601
<i>It's about principles.</i>

86
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,974
<i>Without them,
what would little boys do?</i>

87
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:22,571
<i>It's about integrity.</i>

88
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:24,740
<i>This tune has got to change.</i>

89
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:29,845
<i>On election day,
vote Neal for president.</i>

90
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,152
Oh, boy.

91
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,681
<i>Who's gonna take
the press conference today?</i>

92
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,660
Is there a press conference
today?

93
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:38,992
What do you think?

94
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,897
We have to use this
as a base of operations.

95
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,026
<i>I'm gonna need one, two days.</i>

96
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:47,060
<i>Whoever's leaking that stuff
to the Post lets it slip...</i>

97
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:50,130
<i>"I hope this won't
screw up the B-3 program."</i>

98
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:53,507
<i>"What B-3 program,
and why should it screw it up?"</i>

99
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,705
<i>"If the president
deploys the B-3...</i>

100
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:57,737
<i>before it's fully tested..."</i>

101
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:00,216
<i>"Deploy the B-3
before it's fully tested?"</i>

102
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,344
<i>"Why?"</i>

103
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:03,785
<i>"The crisis."</i>

104
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:06,415
<i>- What crisis?
- I'm working on that.</i>

105
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:10,357
Get General Scott
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

106
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:12,225
and put them
on a plane to Seattle.

107
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,231
<i>He's nervous to talk
to the Boeing people.</i>

108
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:16,793
But what?

109
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,392
<i>There isn't a B-3 bomber.</i>

110
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:20,063
<i>- Where'd you go to school?
- Dartmouth.</i>

111
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:22,470
Then show a little spunk.
There is no B-3 bomber.

112
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:23,939
General Scott,
to your knowledge...

113
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,738
is not in Seattle
to talk to Boeing.

114
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,073
<i>It won't prove out.</i>

115
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:30,512
<i>It doesn't have to prove out.
We just gotta distract them.</i>

116
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,106
Got less than two weeks
till the election.

117
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:35,312
What in the world would do that?

118
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:36,547
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

119
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:45,059
Winifred, Mr. Brean.

120
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:47,460
<i>- What's this?
- $20,000.</i>

121
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,558
I gotta go to L.A.
And see a Hollywood producer.

122
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,569
Meet me at National in an hour.

123
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:54,730
<i>We'll go to Chicago
and connect there to L.A.</i>

124
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:56,296
See you at National.

125
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:06,410
Tell me this again.

126
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,781
We landing?

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,644
Tell me again.

128
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:13,054
<i>Don't worry.
It's nothing new.</i>

129
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,117
<i>During Reagan's administration,
240 Marines killed in Beirut.</i>

130
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,026
24 hours later,
we invade Grenada.

131
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,462
That was their M.O.

132
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:21,863
Change the story,
change the lead.

133
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,457
<i>It's not a new concept.</i>

134
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,469
<i>Wake me when we land.
We'll talk more.</i>

135
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,767
<i>Wait.
We can't afford a war.</i>

136
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,796
<i>We're not having a war.</i>

137
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,398
<i>We're having
the appearance of a war.</i>

138
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:33,034
We cannot afford it.

139
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:36,012
<i>- What'll it cost?
- But they would find out.</i>

140
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,015
<i>Who's gonna find out?
The American people?</i>

141
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,040
<i>Who's gonna tell them?</i>

142
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:43,713
What did they find out
about the Gulf War?

143
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:46,314
One video of one bomb
falls down a chimney.

144
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:48,052
The building could have been
made out of Legos.

145
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:51,152
<i>- You want us to go to war?
- That's the general idea.</i>

146
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,558
With who?

147
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:56,190
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

148
00:08:58,636 --> 00:08:59,830
Albania?

149
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,999
Why?

150
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,235
Why not?
What do you know about them?

151
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:07,506
- Nothing.
- Precisely.

152
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:10,275
They seem shifty, standoffish.

153
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:13,545
Who knows from Albania?
Who trusts Albanians?

154
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,518
What did Albania ever do to us?

155
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,611
What did they do for us?

156
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:19,521
This is why we have to
mobilize the B-3 bomber.

157
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,457
You really want to go
to war with Albania?

158
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:24,723
<i>We don't have a choice.
This is what you do.</i>

159
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,128
Get your press office
right now to deny it.

160
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:28,461
<i>It didn't happen.</i>

161
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:31,297
<i>"There is no report
of Albanian activity."</i>

162
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:32,859
They have to deny it.

163
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:35,838
<i>- It didn't happen.
- Deny.</i>

164
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:38,740
<i>... news from the president
on his visit to China.</i>

165
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,505
<i>Another sort of news, however...</i>

166
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:42,307
<i>has emerged
from the presidential quarter.</i>

167
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:45,338
<i>We turn to Melissa Gardner
at KZAB in Santa Fe...</i>

168
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:46,576
<i>with this breaking news.</i>

169
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,249
<i>Thanks, Richard.
Today a local Firefly Girl...</i>

170
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,051
<i>accused the president
of sexual misconduct.</i>

171
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,354
<i>This photo of the president
with the girls...</i>

172
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:58,452
<i>was taken during their tour
of the White House.</i>

173
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,521
<i>The girl claims
that the sexual misconduct...</i>

174
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:03,124
<i>occurred inside the Oval Office.</i>

175
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,226
<i>Her attorney says
there are no plans yet...</i>

176
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,668
<i>to hold a press conference.</i>

177
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:09,366
<i>Folks in Santa Fe
and the rest of America...</i>

178
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:11,567
<i>are waiting for a response
from the White House...</i>

179
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:13,668
<i>on these harsh allegations.</i>

180
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:17,442
<i>With the election days away,
the big question is...</i>

181
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:20,712
<i>how much will this scandal
affect the outcome?</i>

182
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,048
Top people, Albanian desk.

183
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:24,850
<i>I don't know, either,
but we probably have one.</i>

184
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,880
Roust them out of bed.

185
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:29,620
Albanian desk, CIA, NSA.
Roust them, sirens blaring.

186
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,787
<i>I know they're gonna be up
in an hour.</i>

187
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,854
I want them up now.
Tell your staff...

188
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:35,195
General Scott in Seattle?

189
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:39,669
<i>I don't think his trip
has to do with the B-3 bomber.</i>

190
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:42,001
<i>I'll have to ask you
to turn that off.</i>

191
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,007
<i>It'll just be a second.</i>

192
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,975
There are no electronics
on the plane.

193
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,137
I have to ask you
to turn that off.

194
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,612
<i>It'll just take two seconds.</i>

195
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:52,480
<i>We've said flat out
there is no B-3 bomber.</i>

196
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,313
I understand.

197
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:57,809
<i>If it is true, he should,
he must step down...</i>

198
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:01,188
<i>and if it's not true,
then he must...</i>

199
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:04,319
<i>We are informed he has extended
his visit to China.</i>

200
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:07,489
<i>I say on behalf of
the American people, come home.</i>

201
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:10,398
<i>Face the music,
whatever that may be.</i>

202
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:11,924
<i>The election's in 11 days.</i>

203
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:14,164
<i>Let the American people decide.</i>

204
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,672
<i>"Let the American people
decide."</i>

205
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:18,504
<i>Senator Neal,
presidential candidate.</i>

206
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,100
<i>Excuse me, Senator...</i>

207
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,078
<i>That's 11 days
till the election...</i>

208
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,672
<i>and the president
ahead in the polls by... Bob?</i>

209
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:26,148
<i>Seventeen percent.</i>

210
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:30,244
<i>Accusations have surfaced which
could affect the outcome...</i>

211
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:31,652
<i>The White House has announced...</i>

212
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,452
<i>in response
to the media pressure...</i>

213
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,287
<i>there will be
a press conference.</i>

214
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,556
This is how
a Hollywood producer lives?

215
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,120
This is bigger
than the White House.

216
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,798
Get me my veggie shake...

217
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:47,269
and remind me
to turn over in 10 minutes...

218
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,704
to tan the other side.

219
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,538
Do I know you?

220
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:55,067
We have mutual friends
in Washington.

221
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:58,513
Yes, as you said,
and is it true?

222
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,540
<i>Mr. Motss, I wouldn't...</i>

223
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:03,382
<i>You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't true.</i>

224
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,186
Really, who could say?

225
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:09,818
I like the guy.
He signed his book to me...

226
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,988
<i>"For two generations..."
What was it?</i>

227
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,692
<i>"For progress to occur,"
I think he said.</i>

228
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,793
Two Generations to Agree, yes.

229
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,827
<i>That's what he inscribed.
How'd you know that?</i>

230
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:22,202
<i>That's the title of the book.</i>

231
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,570
<i>That's the title?</i>

232
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:27,870
<i>For Progress to Occur
It's Necessary for Two...</i>

233
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:29,345
<i>That's a terrible title.</i>

234
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,209
<i>You're right.</i>

235
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,118
For Two Generations to Agree.
That is the title.

236
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:38,781
I never looked at the cover.

237
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:39,789
I just looked
at what he wrote to me.

238
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:42,018
When you get the time,
read the cover.

239
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,358
<i>John Levy is expected to respond
to the allegations...</i>

240
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:47,057
<i>of sexual misconduct
by the president.</i>

241
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:49,824
This guy is fucked.

242
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:57,162
What one has to do, Mr. Motss,
is fight a holding action.

243
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,937
<i>They'll run this man
through the shredder.</i>

244
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:02,878
If we hold the break
in the dam till the election...

245
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:04,244
we got a chance.

246
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:06,579
<i>You can't hold the dam.</i>

247
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,847
<i>I don't get
what you want me to do.</i>

248
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:14,621
<i>... advised him to stay
in China for one or two days.</i>

249
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:17,593
<i>During that time,
of course, we'll remain...</i>

250
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:19,596
<i>But he's gotta
come back sometime.</i>

251
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,495
What is one or two days
gonna buy you?

252
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:23,159
Look at all those hands.

253
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,861
<i>Brer Rabbit
couldn't get out of this.</i>

254
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,200
<i>Would you comment please
on the rumors...</i>

255
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:30,263
<i>that the president's delay...</i>

256
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:32,400
<i>is due to the situation
in Albania?</i>

257
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,904
<i>There is...</i>

258
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:38,414
<i>I'm not aware of the situation
to which you refer.</i>

259
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,440
<i>We'vejust learned
that the State Department...</i>

260
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:43,920
<i>has set up a special Albanian
task force at Ops Center.</i>

261
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:48,186
<i>Mr. Sklansky, I am... We have...
Mrs. Rose?</i>

262
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:52,093
<i>Early this morning,
General Scott flew to Seattle.</i>

263
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,326
<i>Is his trip connected
with the B-3 bomber?</i>

264
00:13:55,366 --> 00:14:00,360
<i>To the best of my knowledge,
there is no B-3 bomber.</i>

265
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:03,430
<i>Mr. Levy, is the situation
in Albania related...</i>

266
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,965
<i>to the Muslim fundamentalist
anti-American uprising?</i>

267
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,672
Now they get it.

268
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:11,738
<i>There you go.
There's a little help.</i>

269
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:15,548
<i>... that have
fundamentalist movements...</i>

270
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:17,679
How close are you to this?

271
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,586
What do you want the kid to say?

272
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:26,191
<i>We will keep you apprised
of any new information.</i>

273
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,791
<i>At this time,
there is no information...</i>

274
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,768
Have him say...

275
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,738
<i>I know we're all concerned
for the president.</i>

276
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:39,937
<i>I'm sure that our hopes
and prayers are with him.</i>

277
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,877
Could you have Levy say...

278
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:43,903
<i>"I know we're all concerned
for the president.</i>

279
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,414
<i>I'm sure our hopes
and prayers are with him."</i>

280
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:52,754
<i>I want to say I know we are all
concerned for the president...</i>

281
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,258
<i>and our hopes and prayers
are with him.</i>

282
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,520
<i>He didn't phrase it right.</i>

283
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,084
<i>He didn't sell the line.</i>

284
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,564
You bought yourself one day,
maybe two.

285
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:07,092
All I need
is 11 till the election.

286
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,537
<i>This isn't gonna hold
for 11 days.</i>

287
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,700
- The guy fucked a Girl Scout.
- A Firefly Girl.

288
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,972
He fucked a Firefly Girl.

289
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,377
What are you gonna do
to hold that off?

290
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,108
<i>I'm gonna get my veggie shake.</i>

291
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,581
What do you think
would hold it off?

292
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:20,776
Nothing.

293
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:25,246
<i>You'd have to have a war.</i>

294
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:31,527
<i>You're kidding.
You're not kidding.</i>

295
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:38,501
<i>I'm in show business.
Why come to me?</i>

296
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:41,998
<i>I'll tell you why.</i>

297
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,735
<i>"54, 40, or fight."
What does that mean?</i>

298
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,766
<i>- It's a slogan.
- "Remember the Maine."</i>

299
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:49,611
<i>"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too."</i>

300
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:52,581
<i>They're war slogans.</i>

301
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:55,141
We remember the slogans,
not the wars.

302
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,550
You know why?

303
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:58,555
<i>That's show business.
That's why we're here.</i>

304
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,819
Naked girl, covered in napalm.

305
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,189
<i>"V" for victory.</i>

306
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:05,286
5 Marines raising the flag,
Mount Surabachi.

307
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:08,691
You remember the picture
in 50 years, but forget the war.

308
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:11,462
The Gulf War, smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

309
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,697
2,500 missions a day, 100 days.

310
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:16,001
One video of one bomb.

311
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,768
The American people
bought that war.

312
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:20,777
<i>War is show business.
That's why we're here.</i>

313
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,405
What do you do
for the president?

314
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,981
Why Albania?

315
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,643
Why not?

316
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:29,379
They gotta know at some point.

317
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:30,579
Who?

318
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,490
The public.

319
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:36,993
They gotta know?

320
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:39,052
Get with it.
Who killed Kennedy?

321
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,257
I read the first draft
of the Warren Report.

322
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,425
Says he was killed
by a drunk driver.

323
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,731
The Gulf War.
What do you see day after day?

324
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,828
The one smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

325
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,133
The truth?

326
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:51,403
I was in the building
when we shot that shot.

327
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,409
We shot it in a studio
in Falls Church, Virginia.

328
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:54,808
<i>1l10 scale model of a building.</i>

329
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:56,073
Is that true?

330
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:58,081
How do we know?
You take my point?

331
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:59,776
All right.

332
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:02,182
You want me to do what?

333
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,584
To produce.

334
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,214
You want me to produce your war?

335
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,121
<i>Not a war.
It's a pageant.</i>

336
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:10,718
We need a theme,
a song, some visuals.

337
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,160
<i>It's a pageant.</i>

338
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,255
<i>It's like the Oscars.
That's why we came to you.</i>

339
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,993
I never won an Oscar.

340
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,365
<i>That's a shame,
but you produced the Oscars.</i>

341
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:20,029
Indeed, I did.

342
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,402
<i>You're a writer,
that's your script.</i>

343
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,703
<i>You're a director,
but if you're the producer...</i>

344
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:27,369
nobody knows what you do.

345
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,276
<i>The producer,
all he's got is the credit.</i>

346
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,747
You see?
And some plaques on the wall.

347
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:34,717
<i>They don't know what we do.
Don't get me started.</i>

348
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,584
If you never won an Oscar...

349
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,213
how would you like
an ambassadorship?

350
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:42,054
<i>An ambassadorship?
That's my payoff?</i>

351
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:43,719
Tell me what you want.

352
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,558
<i>I'd just do it
for a story to tell.</i>

353
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:48,030
<i>You couldn't tell anybody.</i>

354
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:50,226
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>

355
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:52,861
<i>- You couldn't tell anybody.
- Just a figure of speech.</i>

356
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:55,269
<i>It's a pageant.</i>

357
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:56,533
<i>That's what it is.</i>

358
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:57,835
<i>The country's at war.</i>

359
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,102
<i>It's Miss America.
You're Bert Parks.</i>

360
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,973
- Why Albania?
- Because.

361
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,571
What do we have
that they want?

362
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,605
- Freedom.
- Why would they want that?

363
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:09,050
- Oppressed?
- Fuck freedom.

364
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:12,351
They want to destroy
the godless Satan.

365
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,584
They want to destroy
our way of life.

366
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,887
All right?

367
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:19,054
The president is in China.

368
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:22,065
He is dealing with the dispatch
of the B-3 bomber to Albania.

369
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,295
Why?

370
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:28,028
Why? Help me.

371
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,002
Geo-politically...

372
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:37,074
We found out they have the bomb.

373
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:45,352
<i>- That's good.
- And... wait a second.</i>

374
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:48,986
<i>The bomb's not there...</i>

375
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:52,120
<i>because they'd have to have
a rocket and that shit.</i>

376
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:55,359
They are a bunch of wogs.
Cross that out.

377
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:57,492
<i>It's a suitcase bomb.</i>

378
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,468
<i>I didn't know I said that.</i>

379
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:01,971
<i>It's a suitcase bomb.
You don't need missiles.</i>

380
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,836
You can put a bomb
in a suitcase.

381
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:08,667
<i>That's good.
A suitcase bomb.</i>

382
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,111
<i>It's a suitcase bomb.</i>

383
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,548
<i>When it's cooking, it's cooking.</i>

384
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,710
<i>We're cooking, and it's in...</i>

385
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:20,283
Canada. All right?

386
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,884
Albanian terrorists
have placed a suitcase bomb...

387
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:27,124
in Canada in an attempt
to infiltrate it into the USA.

388
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:30,463
<i>- That's good.
- That's terrific.</i>

389
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,730
<i>I'll tell you why.
It is cost effective.</i>

390
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,033
<i>It's producing.
That's what it is.</i>

391
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:37,666
<i>- It's really great.
- I could tell you stories.</i>

392
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,006
Cecil B. De Mille,
The Greatest Show on Earth...

393
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,011
he needs an elephant.

394
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:43,273
I got the president on the line.

395
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,108
One minute.

396
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,747
Needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Know what he does?

397
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:53,221
Ames here. Yes, sir?

398
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,224
You listening?

399
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:57,351
<i>- Nobody's listening.
- I'm listening.</i>

400
00:19:57,394 --> 00:20:00,693
- The suitcase bomb.
- Good title for a movie.

401
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:02,790
<i>Please, write it down.
Don't editorialize.</i>

402
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,165
The thinking is, terrorism.

403
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:08,660
Act One:
Albania denies everything.

404
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:11,936
<i>The president comes on the air,
"Be calm."</i>

405
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:13,272
Know what I need?

406
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,076
Get me Johnny Dean,
Liz Butsky, and the Fad King.

407
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:18,604
<i>Isn't Johnny Dean in the...</i>

408
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,946
Back in Nashville.

409
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:25,544
<i>- Act Two.
- We don't need an Act Two.</i>

410
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:28,387
<i>Don't forget Fad King.
We don't need an Act Two?</i>

411
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,416
We just have to hold
their interest for 11 days.

412
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,428
<i>It's a teaser.</i>

413
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,123
Absolutely right.

414
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:37,190
Grace. Teaser.

415
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:39,930
<i>They're getting a good reaction
on the Albanian thing.</i>

416
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,098
Hello, John, you two-bit
redneck shitkicker.

417
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,903
How the heck are you?

418
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,909
Get out.

419
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:52,647
<i>He's got a new wife.</i>

420
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:56,448
<i>He's riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.</i>

421
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:03,216
We need you here yesterday.

422
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,593
All right?
Get your ass out here.

423
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,098
The president wonders about
the possible Albanian backlash.

424
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:11,657
<i>You can't have a war
without an enemy.</i>

425
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:14,067
We could, but it would be dull.

426
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,594
How long do we need him?

427
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,402
<i>We're done in 11 days.</i>

428
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,705
Eleven days. We need you.

429
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:22,268
You want to write a song for us?

430
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:25,076
Is there gonna be a back end?

431
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:27,116
Is there a back end?

432
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,947
Back end?

433
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:30,953
Percentage points, money.

434
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:32,477
Count on it.

435
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:35,286
Where is the back end
coming from?

436
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:38,021
<i>It's like
that yellow ribbon thing.</i>

437
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:40,757
The hostages.

438
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:43,163
They tied the yellow ribbons
around everything.

439
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,100
But that was
a naturally occurring...

440
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,329
That was a put-up job?

441
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:56,404
I want you to get Johnny
a ticket.

442
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,004
Fad King on two.

443
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:01,017
<i>He's riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.</i>

444
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:04,048
Are you shitting me?

445
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:07,989
King, got a thing here,
product placement.

446
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,286
<i>Of course there's a back end.</i>

447
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:13,792
<i>- It can't be a ribbon.
- What's wrong with a ribbon?</i>

448
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,730
AIDS has
the yellow ribbon thing.

449
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,027
Fuck ribbons.

450
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,762
Canada.
Our neighbor to the north...

451
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:21,532
all of a sudden transformed
into that place from whence...

452
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:23,732
like the north wind,
terror comes.

453
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,240
I like that. Keep talking.

454
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:26,970
What guards us against Canada?

455
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,468
<i>I guard the Canadian border.</i>

456
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:32,004
Mounties guard the border.
Mountie hats.

457
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:33,481
Stupid fucking hats.

458
00:22:33,517 --> 00:22:34,916
Davy Crockett had a hat.

459
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:38,079
You could crush them
and put them in your pocket.

460
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,681
<i>You can't put a mountie hat
in your pocket.</i>

461
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:43,386
You see this?
This is what producing is.

462
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:47,590
You put me in a room
with talent... electric.

463
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:49,326
<i>I'm thinking armbands.</i>

464
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:53,769
<i>- Armbands is good.
- I'm thinking green.</i>

465
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:56,772
Last year, the number one color
in new cars was green.

466
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:58,967
- People like green.
- Hunter.

467
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:02,001
Hunter green.
Strong, pride, dignity.

468
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,910
Not Kelly green.

469
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:06,142
I like it with a hat.

470
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:08,173
- Maybe.
- You see that?

471
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,320
<i>Sit on my lap if you love me...</i>

472
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:17,258
<i>but don't put your hand
down there.</i>

473
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:18,659
<i>I didn't mean...</i>

474
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:21,493
<i>We'll take a short nap.</i>

475
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:23,761
I thought you should see it.

476
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,233
<i>It shouldn't be a song.</i>

477
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:29,534
<i>I'm glad that your mama's
not here.</i>

478
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:31,165
<i>Don't do a song about it.</i>

479
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:32,435
I thought it was funny.

480
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:33,772
<i>Sit on my lap...</i>

481
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,405
<i>I don't think it's appropriate
for what we're doing.</i>

482
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:38,345
I just meant for you to see it.

483
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:42,750
<i>I guard the Canadian border.</i>

484
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:45,050
<i>The president spent the weekend
pressing the flesh.</i>

485
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:47,113
<i>He wasn't campaigning.
He was dating, actually.</i>

486
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:53,726
Change this. Thank you.

487
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:56,630
<i>Behind the mention of Albania,
of his stomach flu...</i>

488
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,794
<i>taking refuge these scant days
away from the election.</i>

489
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:01,929
Young girl in rubble.

490
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:05,135
She was driven from her home
by Albanian terrorists.

491
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:07,939
It is her
we are mobilizing to defend.

492
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:10,879
- Or is it she?
- It is her.

493
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,404
Can we get her a kitten?

494
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,815
Young girl in rubble
with a kitten.

495
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:16,113
<i>That's good.</i>

496
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:19,349
This is too static.

497
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:21,983
Young girl running
from the village.

498
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,287
More energy.

499
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:25,794
<i>Time to face
these terrible charges...</i>

500
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,128
<i>to answer
all of these questions.</i>

501
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:31,190
<i>- What's this?
- Head shots.</i>

502
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:35,967
Girls to play the victim
in our news footage.

503
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,268
Write this down.

504
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:39,707
Young girl running
from village towards camera.

505
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:42,439
Grainy hand-held news footage.

506
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,810
Send it to everyone.

507
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:47,112
What do you think?
I like the sorrowful one.

508
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,311
What is this again?

509
00:24:49,352 --> 00:24:52,344
Young Albanian girl
running from her home.

510
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:53,651
I like this broad here.

511
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,386
Where? Too Texan.

512
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:58,155
<i>We're locked into Albania.
Why?</i>

513
00:24:58,194 --> 00:24:59,525
<i>Albania's hard to rhyme.</i>

514
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:02,121
What are you looking at me for?

515
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,564
<i>It's the name of the country.</i>

516
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:10,096
That rhymes.

517
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:14,203
- John Belushi?
- Jim.

518
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:15,677
Jim Belushi.

519
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,942
- Jim Belushi what?
- Albanian?

520
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,778
<i>Jim Belushi's Albanian?</i>

521
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:21,181
Are you kidding?

522
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:24,550
<i>Know anybody who's eaten
in an Albanian restaurant?</i>

523
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:27,317
- Is there such a thing?
- Has to be.

524
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:31,088
- Is there a national dish?
- We can make it up.

525
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:32,924
Jim Belushi is Albanian.

526
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:51,010
What time is it?

527
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,077
3:03.

528
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,379
Great idea.

529
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:58,945
To the men and women of
the 303 detachment with their...

530
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,478
Leopard skin.

531
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:02,548
With their berets.

532
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,025
How about all black?

533
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,028
<i>That's good.</i>

534
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:07,461
<i>Half black, half leopard...</i>

535
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:09,658
<i>wear it on your head.</i>

536
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:12,600
<i>Half black, half leopard...</i>

537
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:15,195
<i>wear it to your bed.</i>

538
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:17,536
<i>Half black, half leopard.</i>

539
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:19,735
<i>I guard...</i>

540
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:22,977
<i>the American dream.</i>

541
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:26,742
<i>I guard...</i>

542
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:30,678
<i>the American dream.</i>

543
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:41,893
<i>Everybody's always
in a hurry these days.</i>

544
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,922
<i>If they're not
rushing somewhere...</i>

545
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,561
<i>they're changing something
that doesn't need changing.</i>

546
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:50,004
<i>That's why I'm glad
we're behind the president.</i>

547
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,475
<i>Sure we are.
Itjust makes good sense.</i>

548
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,944
<i>You don't want to change
horses in midstream.</i>

549
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:58,311
Why are they sticking
with this age-old horseshit?

550
00:26:58,348 --> 00:27:00,612
Why are they sticking
with the same garbage?

551
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,813
- Who hires these people?
- I feel insulted having seen it.

552
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:06,947
<i>- It's offensive.
- Poorly costumed.</i>

553
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,653
New York Times,
Washington Post: War.

554
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:13,753
Times got the Firefly Girl
in the Style section.

555
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,561
Post on page 12.

556
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,760
<i>It's good. Hello?</i>

557
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,836
<i>It's very important. Listen up.</i>

558
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:25,170
<i>It's all war.
You're doing good.</i>

559
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,870
Would you vote for that person
based on that commercial?

560
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:30,106
<i>- I don't vote.
- Why don't you vote?</i>

561
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:32,444
When Major League Baseball
started the fans voting...

562
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:33,915
I voted for Boog Powell
on first base.

563
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,248
<i>He didn't get in,
and it disappointed me.</i>

564
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:37,548
<i>It's futile.</i>

565
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,555
<i>You've never voted
for president?</i>

566
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:41,817
Do you vote?

567
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:44,588
No. I always vote
for the Academy Awards...

568
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:45,958
but I never win.

569
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:47,223
Liz, do you vote?

570
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:49,823
<i>I don't vote.
I don't like the rooms.</i>

571
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:52,164
<i>Too claustrophobic.
I can't vote in small places.</i>

572
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,900
<i>It's about that time.</i>

573
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:08,250
We got the Albanian girl
with a cat, a kitten, and a dog.

574
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:10,445
<i>I don't want a dog.
I asked for a kitten.</i>

575
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:13,546
I understand that,
but the pet wrangler suggested...

576
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,718
I need to speak to the president
before you pick an animal.

577
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,126
<i>Can't they find me a kitten?
Listen to me.</i>

578
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,461
Albanian terrorists
have a staging area...

579
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:25,160
<i>for their atomic workshop.
That's why she's fleeing.</i>

580
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,294
<i>What if it wasn't Albania?
Say it was Italy?</i>

581
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:30,101
<i>I can get a lot of cash
if it's Italy.</i>

582
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:33,336
<i>"Give them the boot."
What if a shoe was the fad?</i>

583
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:36,402
The little girl
is coming toward the camera.

584
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:39,074
What does she have in her hands?
A kitten.

585
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:41,049
<i>Albania doesn't
do anything for me.</i>

586
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,483
<i>That's the problem.</i>

587
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:44,986
<i>- We're locked into Albania.
- Why is that?</i>

588
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:49,389
<i>The president's going to war
in about 30 minutes.</i>

589
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:50,892
Declaring war on Albania?

590
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,088
<i>We're not declaring war.
We're going to war.</i>

591
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:55,461
<i>We haven't declared war
since World War II.</i>

592
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,965
<i>We're going to war.</i>

593
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:03,763
<i>This late-breaking news
just in from Air Force One.</i>

594
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:05,239
<i>The president
of the United States...</i>

595
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:08,676
<i>has said he apologizes
for the need for secrecy...</i>

596
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,872
<i>and he assures
that it is necessary...</i>

597
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:13,644
<i>for the safety of the men
and women in combat.</i>

598
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:15,844
<i>He says that
the Republic of Albania...</i>

599
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:19,616
<i>long a staging ground
for terrorism around the world.</i>

600
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:23,592
<i>He mentioned a state of war
is or is about to happen...</i>

601
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,527
<i>between the United States
and the Republic of Albania.</i>

602
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:28,086
How many kittens do we have?

603
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:30,429
There ought to be
kittens a-plenty. I called.

604
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,065
<i>People, let's get started.</i>

605
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:39,438
<i>My name is Stanley Motss.
I'll be your producer.</i>

606
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:41,568
What I would like you to do,
Miss...

607
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:42,839
Tracy Lime.

608
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:45,143
Stand against that wall,
and on my signal...

609
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:47,479
I want you running toward me,
screaming.

610
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:49,610
<i>- Can we get you anything?
- I'm fine.</i>

611
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:52,644
How about a cup of tea?
A little milk, low fat?

612
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:53,917
You OK?

613
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:56,084
<i>Fine. Let's try one.</i>

614
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,457
Is this a national?
Is that the case?

615
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:00,553
<i>It's a direct buy-out.</i>

616
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:03,030
Have your agent...
What is this?

617
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,966
What is this, a menagerie?

618
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,526
<i>I can't wait to put this
on my résumé></i>

619
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,403
Can I talk to you for a minute?

620
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,135
This is a special kind
of situation.

621
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,979
We have a schnauzer
and what appears to be...

622
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:18,173
<i>It's a Lhasa apso.</i>

623
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:21,241
<i>It couldn't have been simpler.
Kittens.</i>

624
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:25,414
What you got here
is a cross between a dog...

625
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:27,218
I just want kittens.

626
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:29,781
Absolutely, sir.
The president wants a kitten.

627
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,919
I want a kitten.

628
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:35,089
Get rid of the dogs
and keep the kittens.

629
00:30:35,131 --> 00:30:36,598
Miss. Excuse me.

630
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:39,362
I have to have you sign
this sheet of paper.

631
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:41,996
My agent would be miffed
with me if l...

632
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,801
<i>This doesn't have to do
with your deal.</i>

633
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,865
This is your security clearance.

634
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:48,538
Right there.

635
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,445
Nice signature. Thank you.

636
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:53,881
Nice meeting you.

637
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:00,818
This is a nice one.

638
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,586
<i>That's a cat.
These are kittens.</i>

639
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,286
They wanted to give options.

640
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:08,320
<i>It's too confusing.
He's pushing the Lopso opso.</i>

641
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,423
<i>- We'll do it optically.
- Digitally.</i>

642
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:12,559
<i>Let's try to shoot one.</i>

643
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,297
- Stacey...
- Tracy.

644
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:16,805
I want you to stand over here.

645
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,137
Here you go. Right there.

646
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:20,506
These are chips.

647
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,642
Hold the bag when you run.

648
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:27,615
<i>It's for the arm position.
On screen, it'll be a kitten.</i>

649
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,117
Can I hold the kitten?

650
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,619
<i>We'll punch it in later.</i>

651
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,382
<i>You're gonna punch
the kitten later?</i>

652
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:33,650
Why?

653
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:35,452
For a wider set of options.

654
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:37,857
A wider option of what?

655
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:39,589
Of kittens.

656
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:45,800
Sir, all kidding aside,
I get to put it on my résumé?

657
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:47,427
Actually, no.

658
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,871
What is it,
a guild thing or something?

659
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:53,239
You can never tell anyone
you did this.

660
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:54,573
What could they do?

661
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,044
<i>They'd come to your house
and kill you.</i>

662
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,207
The president.

663
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:01,443
<i>Stop the makeup.
She's been raped by terrorists.</i>

664
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,384
<i>- She's not pale enough.
- Jump out.</i>

665
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,785
<i>They're starting to shoot now...</i>

666
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:08,950
<i>and they're gonna
do the kitten thing optically.</i>

667
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:10,720
<i>That's right, Mr. President.</i>

668
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,694
<i>I don't know how
they do the kitten optically...</i>

669
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:14,662
<i>but they know
what they're doing.</i>

670
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,633
<i>She's not an illegal immigrant,
is she?</i>

671
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:22,899
Could I see the contract?

672
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:24,770
Why is it so flat?

673
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:28,299
Because the president cannot
employ an illegal immigrant.

674
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:30,141
<i>- Let's use more spray.
- Cover up.</i>

675
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,010
<i>Let's keep working!</i>

676
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:33,572
Are we getting there?

677
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:40,520
Good.
Put the village behind her.

678
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:51,132
Gimme some flames.

679
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:56,002
How about some screaming?

680
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:57,335
<i>Screaming's good.</i>

681
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:59,307
Some sound of screaming.

682
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,578
What might be good
is ooh-ahh sirens.

683
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,607
You know. Anne Frank.

684
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:10,710
<i>That's good.</i>

685
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,687
Find us the Anne Frank sirens.

686
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:14,553
<i>That's chilling. That's good.</i>

687
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,057
<i>That's giving me goose bumps.</i>

688
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,650
Find us the ooh-ahhs.

689
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:27,662
<i>We're gonna be back
in Washington when?</i>

690
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:29,227
<i>We'll be back tonight.</i>

691
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:30,933
Tonight is...

692
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,908
It seems that Senator Neal
has discovered something.

693
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:36,503
It makes no difference
about Senator Neal.

694
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:39,310
<i>I don't care what he's got.
We got a war.</i>

695
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,112
Look at that girl.

696
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:44,642
<i>Doesn't she look Albanian?</i>

697
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:47,178
She looks like she was
born and raised in Albania.

698
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:51,059
<i>I got an instinct for casting.
Don't ask me why.</i>

699
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:53,027
<i>We're gonna do it again,
sweetie.</i>

700
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:55,292
<i>- What's her name, Stacey?
- Tracy.</i>

701
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,595
<i>One more time.
You're doing fine.</i>

702
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,337
Could she be running
across a bridge?

703
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:06,799
<i>She's running across
a burning bridge.</i>

704
00:34:13,783 --> 00:34:16,479
<i>- That looks good.
- That's beautiful.</i>

705
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,316
<i>Of course,
we'll need some water.</i>

706
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:20,151
Is it a stream?

707
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:21,554
I think...

708
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,957
- A pond?
- I think...

709
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:26,518
<i>I think it's a calico kitten.</i>

710
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:29,122
<i>She's running across
with a kitten.</i>

711
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,599
Can we have a calico kitten?
Please?

712
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,262
Floyd, punch in a calico kitten.

713
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:35,930
I have 19 screens here.

714
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:37,735
<i>I can't see one calico kitten.</i>

715
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:41,470
The thinking is
a small calico kitten, sir.

716
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:51,118
We have a small calico kitten.

717
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,122
- What?
- He wants a white one.

718
00:34:56,158 --> 00:34:58,092
He wants a white one?

719
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,286
Let me talk to him.

720
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,298
<i>He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.</i>

721
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,129
Can I talk to him?

722
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,930
<i>He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.</i>

723
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:11,506
I hate it
when they start to meddle.

724
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,007
Can we have a white one?

725
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:14,407
He wants a white one.

726
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:19,544
Thank you.

727
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,119
Are we ready yet?

728
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,152
How soon can we get this cut?

729
00:35:34,196 --> 00:35:35,891
4 or 5 hours.

730
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:38,866
<i>That's good.
We can leak that to the press...</i>

731
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:41,426
they can downlink it
on Tel star 401, transporter 21.

732
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:45,164
<i>Makes you glad
you've lived this long.</i>

733
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:51,204
<i>This just in... a special report
from the Albanian front.</i>

734
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:52,612
<i>We'vejust received
information...</i>

735
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:55,913
<i>the young Albanian national
fleeing in this video...</i>

736
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,851
<i>is attempting to escape
terrorist reprisals...</i>

737
00:35:57,887 --> 00:35:59,149
<i>in her village.</i>

738
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,184
<i>America has seldom witnessed...</i>

739
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,355
<i>a more poignant picture
of the human race...</i>

740
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:10,422
Fantastic.

741
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:12,127
They used the same process...

742
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:13,795
with the last
Schwarzenegger movie.

743
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:16,899
<i>Isn't that amazing
how they do that?</i>

744
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:19,271
This is only the beginning.

745
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:21,037
Wait till we get the song.

746
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:23,773
Then you got the song, image,
merchandising tie-ins.

747
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:25,144
This is only the beginning.

748
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:28,207
<i>We were right.
You're the man.</i>

749
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,309
To the beginning.

750
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:31,820
Got your car.

751
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:34,550
I hate it
when they send these long ones.

752
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,115
- Did you make the turn OK?
- Not a problem.

753
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,286
<i>I'm sorry.
You think it's too ostentatious?</i>

754
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:40,727
<i>Just fine. I'll stretch out.</i>

755
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,094
Good. Just make due.

756
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:45,099
<i>I'll see you in Nashville.</i>

757
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,531
Go with the two-tone hat.

758
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:52,040
<i>I don't care.
You work it out.</i>

759
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,237
You. You must have had
similar situations in the past.

760
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:58,974
<i>There are unconfirmed reports
from a reliable source...</i>

761
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:00,845
<i>that things are in motion.</i>

762
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:03,443
<i>What I'm hearing...
and this is a quote...</i>

763
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:05,386
<i>"The president
is looking for a swift...</i>

764
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:07,719
<i>painless, and victorious
conclusion to the war."</i>

765
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:10,851
<i>However, the source
will not go on record.</i>

766
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:14,021
<i>All I can tell you is this
comes from the highest level.</i>

767
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:15,894
New York Times,
Washington Post...

768
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,262
Detroit Register,
Sacramento Bee...

769
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:20,291
all in remission.
No mention of the Firefly Girl.

770
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:22,930
10 days to go.
Big Bird lands when?

771
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,496
Five a.m.

772
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,837
Anything at the airport?

773
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,604
The press thought no.
What do you think?

774
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:29,634
<i>Here's what I think.
Is it gonna rain?</i>

775
00:37:29,678 --> 00:37:31,407
Can you give me the weather
tomorrow morning?

776
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:32,937
Andrews, five a.m.

777
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:35,041
A young Albanian girl...

778
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:36,847
dressed in her... whatever.

779
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:40,413
Is there
some harvest festival...

780
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:42,788
an Albanian harvest festival,
something like that?

781
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:45,055
Find me
an Albanian harvest festival.

782
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:46,391
<i>There's gotta be something.</i>

783
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:48,556
Anyway, she gives him
the sacred whatever it is...

784
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:51,361
telling him this is a sacred
traditional offering...

785
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,868
given to the man
who ties the first sheaf...

786
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:56,030
the last sheaf,
who knows what sheaf?

787
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:57,470
Is she saying this in Albanian?

788
00:37:57,506 --> 00:37:58,803
<i>She's speaking in Albanian...</i>

789
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:01,105
because this is the only way
it can be understood...

790
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:03,805
by her sacred, sainted,
and aged mother...

791
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,780
<i>We're picking them up now.</i>

792
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:10,047
<i>The old lady starts to speak.</i>

793
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:11,950
<i>"You have brought peace
not only to this..."</i>

794
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:14,353
The child speaks.

795
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,255
A face of innocence,
no cynicism.

796
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,589
The child says...

797
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,253
Are you getting this?

798
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:22,059
The old broad starts to cry.

799
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:24,065
Big Bird shrugs off
his secret service...

800
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,226
covers her with his coat,
end of story.

801
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:30,068
<i>Can you find out if we could
get some rain tomorrow?</i>

802
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:31,936
<i>How is Big Bird holding up?</i>

803
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,202
<i>He's good.</i>

804
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:36,234
<i>He does want to know...
what does Motss want?</i>

805
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:38,803
<i>I don't know.
Ambassador to Togo.</i>

806
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,147
<i>No rain tomorrow at Andrews,
but there's rain at Boca Raton.</i>

807
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:44,152
Then direct the plane to Boca.

808
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:46,416
Connie says
divert the plane to Boca.

809
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:54,557
<i>What's happening?</i>

810
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,871
Can I help you?

811
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:14,246
<i>What's the problem?</i>

812
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:16,974
<i>We're in a rush.</i>

813
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:19,283
Do you know who we are?

814
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:21,186
<i>I'm afraid that's the trouble,
Miss Ames.</i>

815
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:22,986
CIA.

816
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:32,092
<i>I have this to say...</i>

817
00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:44,168
<i>... every American man,
woman, and child...</i>

818
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:45,874
What am I gonna do?

819
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:47,348
I have
a three-year-old daughter...

820
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:49,214
eventually headed
for orthodonture.

821
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:52,084
<i>Now that the CIA knows,
I'm gonna lose everything...</i>

822
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,316
my career, my reputation.
What am I gonna do?

823
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:56,324
Brazen it through.

824
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:58,087
Took you long enough.

825
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:00,220
We found them
as soon as we could.

826
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:02,127
All right.

827
00:40:02,164 --> 00:40:05,133
<i>After I'm done with them,
what do they want me to do?</i>

828
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,567
Lug them back to the district
or dump them in the country...

829
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:09,093
let the FBI trip over them?

830
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,129
Legal department says you pick.

831
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:12,731
Depends on what we want
to do with them.

832
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:15,573
<i>This is a special report
on the war in Albania.</i>

833
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:17,203
<i>We'vejust received
more details...</i>

834
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:19,214
<i>on the Albanian girl
running for her life.</i>

835
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:20,875
<i>The young girl
was trying to escape...</i>

836
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,884
<i>after hearing
her family was killed.</i>

837
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:25,318
<i>Apparently, there was
a family connection in Canada.</i>

838
00:40:29,825 --> 00:40:31,349
Two things I know to be true...

839
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:35,463
<i>there's no difference between
good flan and bad flan...</i>

840
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:37,021
and there is no war.

841
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:38,363
Guess who I am.

842
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,392
I would like to point out
that I am under medical care...

843
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:43,871
and taking medication,
side effects of which have...

844
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:45,567
Quite touching.

845
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,269
I also take this opportunity...

846
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:50,005
to suggest that, equally,
I admit to nothing...

847
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:51,603
and I would like
my lawyer present.

848
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,581
We show, and NSA confirms...

849
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:56,483
there are no nuclear devices
on the Canadian border.

850
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:58,748
There are no nuclear devices
in Albania.

851
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:00,778
Albania has no nuclear capacity.

852
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:02,484
Our spy satellites...

853
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:04,685
show no secret
terrorist training camps...

854
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:06,661
in the Albanian hinterland.

855
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:09,664
The border patrol, the FBI,
the RCMP report...

856
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:13,327
no... repeat...
no untoward activity...

857
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:15,667
along our picturesque
Canadian border.

858
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:18,696
The Albanian government
is screaming its defense.

859
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:20,038
The world is listening.

860
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:21,508
There is no war.

861
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:24,068
<i>There's a war.
I'm watching it on television.</i>

862
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:26,104
Who might you be?

863
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:28,742
- Conrad Brean.
- Who do you work for?

864
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:32,185
Nobody whose name
you want me to say.

865
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:35,281
<i>It's all well, but when the fit
hits the shan...</i>

866
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:36,916
somebody has to stay
after school.

867
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,449
Who might that be?

868
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:40,826
<i>I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

869
00:41:40,863 --> 00:41:43,331
The spy satellites show it.

870
00:41:43,365 --> 00:41:44,662
They show no war.

871
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,224
Then what good are they?

872
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:49,601
Why spend a quarter trillion
dollars a year on defense?

873
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:51,071
What good are they?

874
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:52,539
Are they useless or just broken?

875
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:54,439
I would like
to point out further...

876
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:56,341
that these medications
taken in conjunction...

877
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:59,040
<i>If there's no threat,
then where are you?</i>

878
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,708
<i>If there's no threat,
what good are you?</i>

879
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:02,944
You are the threat.

880
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,384
<i>I'm the threat?</i>

881
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,853
What have I been doing
the last 30 years...

882
00:42:05,888 --> 00:42:07,879
<i>that you haven't been doing?</i>

883
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:09,754
The last 30 years...

884
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,726
I have been working to ensure
the security of my country.

885
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,820
<i>I'm sure that speaks well
of you and your parents...</i>

886
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:17,195
but if forced to choose between
the security of your country...

887
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:19,496
and the security of your job,
which would you pick?

888
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:22,129
While you hesitate,
permit me to suggest...

889
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:24,503
that they are one in the same.

890
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,031
<i>I'm doing my job.
That's what you see me doing.</i>

891
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:28,668
<i>I'm doing my job, too.</i>

892
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:29,939
The constant stress
I am under...

893
00:42:29,978 --> 00:42:32,879
Let me ask you
a simple question.

894
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:35,247
Why do people go to war?

895
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:37,809
<i>I'll play your silly game.</i>

896
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:39,115
To ensure their way of life.

897
00:42:39,154 --> 00:42:41,145
- Would you fight to do that?
- I have.

898
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,886
If you went to war again,
who would it be against?

899
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:46,156
Your ability to fight
a two-ocean war against who?

900
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:47,423
Sweden and Togo?

901
00:42:47,463 --> 00:42:49,556
<i>That time has passed.
It's over.</i>

902
00:42:49,598 --> 00:42:52,362
The war of the future
is nuclear terrorism.

903
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:54,335
<i>It'll be against
a small group of dissidents...</i>

904
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:57,463
who, unbeknownst perhaps to
their own governments, have...

905
00:42:57,506 --> 00:42:59,701
To go to that war,
you have to be prepared.

906
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:02,233
You gotta be alert.
The public has gotta be alert...

907
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,472
because that is the war
of the future...

908
00:43:04,513 --> 00:43:07,277
<i>and if you're not gearing up
to fight that war...</i>

909
00:43:07,316 --> 00:43:09,443
<i>then the ax will fall.
You'll be out in the street.</i>

910
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:12,579
You can call this a drill,
call this job security...

911
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:15,055
call it anything you like,
but I got one for you.

912
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,751
Go to war
to preserve your way of life?

913
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:20,091
Chuck, this is your way of life.

914
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:22,097
<i>If your spy satellites
don't see nothing...</i>

915
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:23,723
<i>if there ain't no war...</i>

916
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:26,735
then you can go home
and take up golf...

917
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:28,828
<i>'cause there ain't no war
but ours.</i>

918
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:34,572
Thank you.

919
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:37,336
Drive carefully.

920
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:47,383
Nice enough people.

921
00:43:47,422 --> 00:43:49,014
<i>They just hadn't
thought it through.</i>

922
00:43:49,057 --> 00:43:50,888
You talked us out of there.

923
00:43:50,926 --> 00:43:53,087
<i>We got delayed.
We're going to Nashville.</i>

924
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:54,356
What?

925
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:56,193
You could talk a dog
off a meat truck.

926
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:58,131
Thank you.

927
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:59,600
We just got stuck.

928
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:02,331
All systems five-by-five.
See you in Nashville.

929
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:03,963
You saved our bacon.

930
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:06,236
It was just a...

931
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:08,641
a phenomenal performance.

932
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:10,269
You turned them around.

933
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:13,472
<i>They hadn't thought it through.</i>

934
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,616
<i>He's moving across the tarmac.</i>

935
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,821
<i>But it appears something
has distracted the president...</i>

936
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:31,355
<i>and he has stopped moving
toward the waiting motorcade.</i>

937
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,197
<i>There's a little girl...</i>

938
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,100
<i>trying to speak
to the president.</i>

939
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:36,968
<i>It seems she's speaking in...</i>

940
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:38,495
<i>Is it Albanian?</i>

941
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,303
<i>Can we get someone
to translate?</i>

942
00:44:41,677 --> 00:44:43,941
<i>Dan,
I think what she is saying...</i>

943
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:47,938
<i>is that this wheat offering
is sort of ceremonial...</i>

944
00:44:47,983 --> 00:44:50,543
<i>and that it is
the first sheaf...</i>

945
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:52,281
<i>the first cut of the harvest.</i>

946
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:54,312
<i>I'm not proficient
in Albanian...</i>

947
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:55,983
<i>but the old woman
is quite taken...</i>

948
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:58,288
<i>as the president
is offering her the coat.</i>

949
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:00,955
<i>It is quite
an emotional moment here.</i>

950
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:03,328
<i>There comes a time...</i>

951
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:07,532
<i>in the course of human events...</i>

952
00:45:08,237 --> 00:45:11,001
<i>when a threat
must be answered...</i>

953
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,771
<i>with courage and strength.</i>

954
00:45:14,877 --> 00:45:18,369
<i>Our forefathers earned...</i>

955
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:20,847
<i>the right to be free.</i>

956
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:23,545
<i>Now it's time...</i>

957
00:45:23,585 --> 00:45:27,578
<i>to guard their dream.</i>

958
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,717
<i>We guard...</i>

959
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:34,923
<i>our American borders.</i>

960
00:45:34,963 --> 00:45:37,397
<i>We guard...</i>

961
00:45:37,432 --> 00:45:40,595
<i>the American dream.</i>

962
00:45:40,636 --> 00:45:43,298
<i>We guard our right...</i>

963
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:48,275
<i>to fight for democracy...</i>

964
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:53,805
<i>and keep our country free.</i>

965
00:45:54,616 --> 00:45:57,676
<i>We guard...</i>

966
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:00,347
<i>our American spirit.</i>

967
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,320
<i>We guard...</i>

968
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:07,157
<i>the American dream.</i>

969
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:21,104
<i>Our country's built...</i>

970
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:24,238
<i>on the rock of liberty.</i>

971
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,416
<i>And we, as people...</i>

972
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,645
<i>must keep it free.</i>

973
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:33,746
<i>It is for life...</i>

974
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:35,086
<i>liberty...</i>

975
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:38,320
<i>the pursuit of happiness...</i>

976
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:43,491
<i>Freedom, 'tis of thee.</i>

977
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:47,599
<i>We guard...</i>

978
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:51,697
<i>our American borders.</i>

979
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,174
<i>We guard...</i>

980
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:57,178
<i>the American dream.</i>

981
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:00,315
I loved the fat,
wet Albanian broad.

982
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:01,646
Thank you.

983
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:03,446
You know why?
It was understated.

984
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:05,214
You got lucky
with the rain, too.

985
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:07,585
We had to divert
the plane to Boca Raton.

986
00:47:07,622 --> 00:47:09,954
You should have come to me.
We have rain machines.

987
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:11,323
<i>I'm a producer. I make rain.</i>

988
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,759
Next time.

989
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:15,454
<i>I havejust gotten word...</i>

990
00:47:15,497 --> 00:47:18,830
<i>that the situation
in Albania is resolved...</i>

991
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:21,131
<i>that it is resolved.</i>

992
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:22,864
<i>The CIA confirms...</i>

993
00:47:22,904 --> 00:47:25,873
<i>that our troops
along the Canadian border...</i>

994
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:28,637
<i>and overseas are standing down.</i>

995
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:33,972
<i>I must take this opportunity
to call upon our president...</i>

996
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:36,109
What does he mean,
the situation has been resolved?

997
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:37,812
He just ended the war.

998
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,903
He ended the war?

999
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:40,475
Why did he do that?

1000
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,034
I think the CIA
cut a better deal.

1001
00:47:42,078 --> 00:47:43,340
He ended the war?

1002
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:47,706
<i>He can't end the war.</i>

1003
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:49,776
<i>He's not producing this.</i>

1004
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,019
This is in bad taste.

1005
00:47:55,058 --> 00:47:56,389
Can we stop this?

1006
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:00,786
<i>Stop. It's over.</i>

1007
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:03,857
Can we stop this?

1008
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,390
Stop the choir.

1009
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:09,167
<i>It has been quite a week,
Richard.</i>

1010
00:48:09,205 --> 00:48:11,537
<i>I can't remember
when any president...</i>

1011
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:13,337
<i>was hit with the flu, a war...</i>

1012
00:48:13,376 --> 00:48:15,970
<i>and accused of sexual
misconduct by a teenage girl...</i>

1013
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:17,445
<i>all in the same
seven-day period.</i>

1014
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,177
<i>This, of course, only days
before he runs for reelection.</i>

1015
00:48:21,217 --> 00:48:23,583
<i>We'vejust received information
from sources at the CIA...</i>

1016
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,783
<i>that confirms the cessation
of hostilities...</i>

1017
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,085
The CIA.

1018
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:33,262
I thought they let us out
too easily.

1019
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:35,161
<i>The war's over.</i>

1020
00:48:35,198 --> 00:48:37,223
<i>It's over.
I saw it on television.</i>

1021
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:38,529
I have to sell my house.

1022
00:48:38,568 --> 00:48:41,696
The war is not over.

1023
00:48:41,738 --> 00:48:43,103
I saw it on TV.

1024
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:45,903
<i>That's what you hired me for.</i>

1025
00:48:45,942 --> 00:48:48,376
<i>The war isn't over
until I say it's over.</i>

1026
00:48:48,411 --> 00:48:50,845
<i>This is my picture.
This is not the CIA's picture.</i>

1027
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,849
<i>You think
you're in a tight spot now?</i>

1028
00:48:53,883 --> 00:48:56,647
Try making The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

1029
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:58,654
Three of the horsemen died.

1030
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:01,486
<i>Hear what he's saying?
Three of the horsemen died...</i>

1031
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:03,754
two weeks before the end
of principal photography.

1032
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:06,057
This is nothing.

1033
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:09,293
<i>This is just Act One,
"The War."</i>

1034
00:49:09,332 --> 00:49:13,291
We really do need an Act Two,
so we work.

1035
00:49:13,336 --> 00:49:14,564
Act Two.

1036
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:15,969
<i>You know what it's like?</i>

1037
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,701
The Japanese. In the caves.

1038
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:19,834
- Go on.
- Okinawa.

1039
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:21,810
<i>They didn't believe
the war was over.</i>

1040
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:23,938
<i>We have a guy
who doesn't believe...</i>

1041
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,107
We have an American serviceman.

1042
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:29,016
A brave American serviceman
is left behind.

1043
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:31,247
A hero.

1044
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:33,551
<i>I can't believe it.
What was I thinking?</i>

1045
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,353
We had a war.
We forgot the hero.

1046
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:38,225
<i>You can't have a war
and not have a hero.</i>

1047
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:39,626
<i>It's like we sent
a Christmas card...</i>

1048
00:49:39,662 --> 00:49:41,220
and left out the...
What do you call it?

1049
00:49:41,264 --> 00:49:42,561
- Fruitcake.
- There you go.

1050
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,567
<i>Let's work.</i>

1051
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:46,694
<i>We got a guy
who's left behind, so...</i>

1052
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:49,330
This is terrific.
This is lucky this happened.

1053
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:51,340
He was left behind,
just discarded...

1054
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:54,571
like an old shoe.

1055
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:55,839
<i>That's good.</i>

1056
00:49:55,879 --> 00:49:57,608
<i>What's good? What did I say?</i>

1057
00:49:57,647 --> 00:49:58,875
- Shoe.
- Old shoe?

1058
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:00,177
<i>It's just instinct.</i>

1059
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:04,280
Get me the Pentagon...

1060
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,949
a list of people in all
military special programs.

1061
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:10,016
<i>"Left behind like an old shoe."
That is good.</i>

1062
00:50:11,227 --> 00:50:13,161
I want to talk to Johnny.

1063
00:50:16,866 --> 00:50:18,094
What is it?

1064
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:21,035
The war is over.

1065
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:23,335
<i>We're going to need a new song.</i>

1066
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:26,103
It should be a song
about a shiny shoe...

1067
00:50:26,142 --> 00:50:28,702
a black patent shoe...

1068
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:30,542
a good old shoe.

1069
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,344
I was on my way to get drunk.

1070
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:37,513
You get drunk, but I need
a good old shoe song.

1071
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:38,987
A ballad of loss...

1072
00:50:40,323 --> 00:50:42,689
- Want to help me?
- Redemption.

1073
00:50:42,725 --> 00:50:45,558
Loss and redemption
is very good.

1074
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:48,792
Shit.
What key do you want it in?

1075
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:50,299
<i>I don't know keys.</i>

1076
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:55,302
People here are depressed
because the war just ended.

1077
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:57,465
Please give me a new song.

1078
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:59,304
I got him.

1079
00:50:59,342 --> 00:51:01,469
King, Pentagon.

1080
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:03,035
Take it.

1081
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,708
I need a list
of military special programs.

1082
00:51:06,749 --> 00:51:09,149
Bottom of the ninth.

1083
00:51:09,185 --> 00:51:10,652
<i>They don't know
who they're playing with.</i>

1084
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,314
<i>They don't shut down
our picture.</i>

1085
00:51:14,357 --> 00:51:16,188
You people gonna be long?

1086
00:51:16,226 --> 00:51:18,126
<i>Otherwise,
I'll put away the equipment.</i>

1087
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,389
<i>I don't know what I'm doing.</i>

1088
00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:22,193
<i>I think I'm supposed
to be writing a song.</i>

1089
00:51:22,232 --> 00:51:23,665
What kind of song?

1090
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,032
Is there anybody there named...

1091
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:28,003
Schumann?

1092
00:51:28,037 --> 00:51:30,335
- Schuster?
- Schumacher.

1093
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:31,635
I got a great idea.

1094
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:35,310
Old shoe, new shoe.

1095
00:51:37,113 --> 00:51:39,138
<i>Daddy had a hound dog...</i>

1096
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:42,378
<i>used to call him Blue.</i>

1097
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,850
<i>Follow me 'round...</i>

1098
00:51:47,891 --> 00:51:50,451
<i>stick to me like glue.</i>

1099
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:57,399
<i>His favorite thing
to play with...</i>

1100
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:59,492
<i>used to be a good ol' shoe.</i>

1101
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,595
Wait a minute.
Used to be.

1102
00:52:01,638 --> 00:52:03,333
You hit that 16-16.

1103
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,364
<i>Well, I wish I had a woman...</i>

1104
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:08,668
<i>who was half as good and true.</i>

1105
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:14,172
Anybody here know Morse code?

1106
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:15,548
What you gonna do?

1107
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:16,916
Give me the fax.

1108
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:20,089
Sergeant William Schumann,
U.S. Army...

1109
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:24,059
serial number 2131284262.

1110
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:26,761
<i>Good ol' shoe...</i>

1111
00:52:26,796 --> 00:52:28,058
<i>Here's the deal.</i>

1112
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,333
<i>Good OI' Shoe.</i>

1113
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,331
<i>Whatever you walk in...</i>

1114
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:36,963
<i>he will get you through.</i>

1115
00:52:37,006 --> 00:52:39,998
<i>He's in a sweater...</i>

1116
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:41,635
<i>and he's...</i>

1117
00:52:41,678 --> 00:52:44,670
We drop him behind enemy lines.

1118
00:52:44,714 --> 00:52:46,272
<i>He's trapped.</i>

1119
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:47,749
The sweater.

1120
00:52:47,784 --> 00:52:49,581
- In the sweater.
- Good.

1121
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,723
Is there a way we can make it
sound old and scratchy...

1122
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:57,453
with, like, a hiss?

1123
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,896
With an old label.

1124
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:05,400
<i>I see where you're going.</i>

1125
00:53:11,074 --> 00:53:13,269
<i>Stand up straight and tall...</i>

1126
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:15,174
<i>the way he taught you to.</i>

1127
00:53:15,211 --> 00:53:16,974
<i>I'll write a speech.</i>

1128
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:20,774
<i>I'll help you with the speech.</i>

1129
00:53:20,817 --> 00:53:23,684
The president reveals
that William Schumann...

1130
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:29,323
was trapped behind enemy lines.

1131
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,293
This is good.

1132
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:33,124
Heartfelt.

1133
00:53:33,162 --> 00:53:34,424
Touching.

1134
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:36,994
People will weep.

1135
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:40,761
<i>Soul of a good ol' shoe.</i>

1136
00:53:43,506 --> 00:53:45,770
<i>He might even get to heaven...</i>

1137
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:48,868
<i>on the soul of his good ol'...</i>

1138
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:51,573
<i>shoe.</i>

1139
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:58,144
<i>Here's the president's speech.</i>

1140
00:53:58,187 --> 00:54:00,212
Put this
in the Library of Congress.

1141
00:54:00,256 --> 00:54:01,951
Folk music section, 1930.

1142
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,925
Right away, please.

1143
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,690
Get it in
the Library of Congress now.

1144
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:10,662
Oh, God.

1145
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,691
<i>Who's seeing
the CBS guy tonight?</i>

1146
00:54:13,936 --> 00:54:17,235
Tonight, you remember some song
from the folk song days...

1147
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:18,638
about a good old shoe.

1148
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:20,006
Tonight?

1149
00:54:20,043 --> 00:54:22,773
<i>You're with him watching
the president's speech...</i>

1150
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:24,074
<i>What if he's busy?</i>

1151
00:54:24,113 --> 00:54:26,809
- Lure him.
- What are you saying?

1152
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:30,012
<i>I don't have to be
your confessor, darling.</i>

1153
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:32,613
<i>Tell him you've got info
on the sex scandal...</i>

1154
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:33,952
<i>it's on your conscience.</i>

1155
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,821
<i>He'll drop whatever he's doing.</i>

1156
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,618
This is a shitty business.

1157
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,822
It needs no ghost from the grave
to tell us that...

1158
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:43,297
but, Lord willing,
eight days from now...

1159
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:46,029
<i>I'm gonna take you
into the second term.</i>

1160
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:47,468
Wait till you hear the speech.

1161
00:54:47,503 --> 00:54:49,437
The 303 speech. Great.

1162
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:51,269
<i>Where's that Fad King?</i>

1163
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:52,535
<i>I'll get him.</i>

1164
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:53,906
Could we go now?

1165
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:56,377
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

1166
00:54:56,412 --> 00:54:58,710
How are they doing
on Sergeant Schumann?

1167
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:00,545
<i>They're working on him,
they're finding him.</i>

1168
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,175
<i>Good. It's working.</i>

1169
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:04,743
<i>It's all happening.
It's taking place around us.</i>

1170
00:55:04,787 --> 00:55:08,484
It is in the works.
It is being addressed.

1171
00:55:08,524 --> 00:55:09,821
We are being proactive.

1172
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:13,022
We are going out with what
may be the finest example...

1173
00:55:13,062 --> 00:55:15,792
Get me an update on the army,
the Pentagon.

1174
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:17,356
Get this guy Schumann.

1175
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,765
Have him standing by.

1176
00:55:18,801 --> 00:55:22,999
I gotta tell you,
I see a lot of glum faces.

1177
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:24,563
<i>Please don't be disconsolate.</i>

1178
00:55:24,607 --> 00:55:27,872
This is politics at its finest.

1179
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,970
This is where the rubber
meets the road.

1180
00:55:31,013 --> 00:55:33,243
<i>We've got a leader
going out tonight...</i>

1181
00:55:33,282 --> 00:55:34,943
to 95 million American homes.

1182
00:55:34,984 --> 00:55:36,713
<i>He's gonna turn
this thing around.</i>

1183
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:38,516
You think this is tough?

1184
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:41,421
I was 4 months into production
on The Song of Solomon...

1185
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:43,015
<i>found out I didn't
have the rights.</i>

1186
00:55:43,059 --> 00:55:44,651
<i>Turn it up. It's our spot.</i>

1187
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:47,925
Tough? This is nothing.

1188
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:51,195
Will you look at that shit?

1189
00:55:52,402 --> 00:55:54,768
<i>'Cause you don't change
horses in midstream.</i>

1190
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,574
<i>Don't change horses.</i>

1191
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:01,008
This speech is good.

1192
00:56:01,043 --> 00:56:03,238
<i>We're kinda locked into it,
Mr. President.</i>

1193
00:56:04,881 --> 00:56:07,008
<i>For the future
of our families...</i>

1194
00:56:07,049 --> 00:56:09,176
The music.
Where did they get that?

1195
00:56:13,156 --> 00:56:15,488
- Pain in the ass.
- What?

1196
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:20,195
<i>He won't do the speech.</i>

1197
00:56:20,229 --> 00:56:22,288
What do you mean?

1198
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:24,162
What choice does he have?

1199
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,168
<i>He won't do the speech?</i>

1200
00:56:26,202 --> 00:56:27,635
<i>He says it's corny.</i>

1201
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,968
<i>It's what? It's corny?</i>

1202
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,537
<i>Of course it's corny.</i>

1203
00:56:32,575 --> 00:56:35,237
<i>We wouldn't have him say it
if it wasn't.</i>

1204
00:56:35,278 --> 00:56:36,711
<i>It's not a question.</i>

1205
00:56:36,746 --> 00:56:38,475
This is the center
for rest of the thing.

1206
00:56:38,514 --> 00:56:39,742
<i>Don't tell me it's corny.</i>

1207
00:56:39,782 --> 00:56:42,216
<i>We're locked into the speech,
right?</i>

1208
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:43,479
<i>We're locked in.</i>

1209
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,419
We are playing way past this.

1210
00:56:45,455 --> 00:56:46,786
We are past this.

1211
00:56:48,624 --> 00:56:50,251
This is what I need.

1212
00:56:50,293 --> 00:56:53,922
Get me 30 secretaries
and put them in an office now.

1213
00:56:54,931 --> 00:56:56,956
I need to see the president.

1214
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:58,830
I need 5 minutes.

1215
00:56:58,868 --> 00:57:00,802
Know what this reminds me of?

1216
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:03,897
Years ago, when I first
went out to Hollywood...

1217
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,168
<i>they said,
"It's too theatrical."</i>

1218
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:08,302
I was from the theater.
Everything was over their heads.

1219
00:57:08,344 --> 00:57:09,675
<i>He thinks it's corny.</i>

1220
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:11,373
<i>Don't tell me it's corny.</i>

1221
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:12,881
<i>Tell him I'm comin'.</i>

1222
00:57:12,915 --> 00:57:16,942
My fellow Americans,
I thank a merciful God...

1223
00:57:16,986 --> 00:57:19,750
and I am sure
each and every one of us...

1224
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:21,723
will thank that Supreme Power...

1225
00:57:21,757 --> 00:57:24,988
whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1226
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:27,518
that peace is at hand.

1227
00:57:27,563 --> 00:57:31,226
The threat of nuclear terrorism
has been quelled.

1228
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:34,430
<i>Mr. President, I'm using
a little more projection...</i>

1229
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:38,099
because I think this speech
needs a little umph.

1230
00:57:39,976 --> 00:57:41,273
Bear with me.

1231
00:57:42,778 --> 00:57:44,370
Beautiful.

1232
00:57:45,381 --> 00:57:47,008
Thank you so much.

1233
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:01,589
That was so moving.

1234
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:02,928
Thank you so much.

1235
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:04,227
Thank you.

1236
00:58:10,473 --> 00:58:13,738
I felt very much at home
in there.

1237
00:58:13,776 --> 00:58:15,368
Simple quirk of fate.

1238
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:16,969
I could have gone this way.

1239
00:58:17,013 --> 00:58:18,412
<i>It's all a change in wardrobe.</i>

1240
00:58:19,615 --> 00:58:21,048
Was it too much?

1241
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:24,075
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

1242
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,382
You did it.

1243
00:58:26,455 --> 00:58:27,752
You jumped in there...

1244
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,655
and saved the thing
when the thing needed saving.

1245
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:31,683
<i>It wasn't too much?</i>

1246
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:33,558
Personally?

1247
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:34,824
Maybe it was.

1248
00:58:34,864 --> 00:58:38,095
<i>The president doesn't
have to say it that way.</i>

1249
00:58:38,134 --> 00:58:39,601
<i>It's like Plato once said.</i>

1250
00:58:39,635 --> 00:58:41,262
<i>It doesn't matter
how you get there...</i>

1251
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:42,566
as long as you get there.

1252
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:43,867
He said that?

1253
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:46,204
What is it exactly
you do for the president?

1254
00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:49,336
<i>My fellow Americans,
I thank a merciful God...</i>

1255
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:53,314
<i>and I'm sure all of us will thank
that Supreme Power...</i>

1256
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:56,045
<i>whatever we conceive
that power to be...</i>

1257
00:58:56,085 --> 00:58:58,645
<i>that peace is at hand.</i>

1258
00:59:03,392 --> 00:59:06,190
<i>The threat of nuclear terrorism
has been quelled.</i>

1259
00:59:06,228 --> 00:59:09,720
<i>We are in contact
with the Albanian premier...</i>

1260
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:11,232
<i>who assures me...</i>

1261
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:13,497
<i>and this government
credits his assurances...</i>

1262
00:59:13,536 --> 00:59:16,027
<i>his country
does not wish us ill...</i>

1263
00:59:16,072 --> 00:59:17,300
Know any Latin?

1264
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,898
<i>I, Claudius.
That's what I know.</i>

1265
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:22,536
I need a Latin motto
for the patch.

1266
00:59:22,578 --> 00:59:24,205
The 303 patch.

1267
00:59:24,246 --> 00:59:27,909
<i>... but by
a designation number, 303.</i>

1268
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:32,182
<i>A member was left behind
what were then enemy lines.</i>

1269
00:59:32,221 --> 00:59:36,385
<i>I can only say to those
family members of Group 303...</i>

1270
00:59:36,425 --> 00:59:39,121
<i>whose members are,
I know as I speak...</i>

1271
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:40,560
<i>gathering to comfort you.</i>

1272
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:43,064
<i>To the parents
of the missing man...</i>

1273
00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:44,930
<i>no effort will be spared...</i>

1274
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:48,596
<i>to find this brave man
and bring him home.</i>

1275
00:59:48,638 --> 00:59:52,074
<i>We'vejust received
this photograph of Schumann...</i>

1276
00:59:52,108 --> 00:59:55,202
<i>held by a dissident group
of Albanian terrorists.</i>

1277
00:59:55,244 --> 00:59:58,372
<i>I don't know how many of you
know Morse code...</i>

1278
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:01,406
<i>but could you
bring the camera closer?</i>

1279
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,511
<i>You'll see his sweater is worn.</i>

1280
01:00:05,554 --> 01:00:08,022
<i>It has been unraveled in places.</i>

1281
01:00:08,057 --> 01:00:09,786
<i>Those places
form dashes and dots...</i>

1282
01:00:09,825 --> 01:00:14,626
<i>and those dots spell out
a message in Morse code.</i>

1283
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:17,394
<i>That message is,
"Courage, Mom."</i>

1284
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:21,336
<i>He got the message through.</i>

1285
01:00:23,305 --> 01:00:25,205
Not bad for government work.

1286
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:26,936
Having a good time?

1287
01:00:26,976 --> 01:00:29,240
<i>Haven't had this much fun
since live TV.</i>

1288
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:31,940
<i>To the men and women
of Unit 303...</i>

1289
01:00:31,981 --> 01:00:34,449
<i>to my fellow citizens,
I say, "Courage, Mom."</i>

1290
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:38,442
<i>I have informed Albania
that we will not rest...</i>

1291
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:40,318
<i>until the safe return
of Sergeant Schumann.</i>

1292
01:00:40,356 --> 01:00:44,554
<i>I'm told his unit mates gave him
the nickname "Old Shoe."</i>

1293
01:00:44,593 --> 01:00:48,620
<i>Wasn't there a folk song
called "Old Shoe?"</i>

1294
01:00:48,664 --> 01:00:51,758
Do you remember that?
Something like...

1295
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:54,793
<i>I don't know.
I can vaguely remember it.</i>

1296
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:57,067
<i>Do you know
what I'm talking about?</i>

1297
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:01,036
<i>Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1298
01:01:01,077 --> 01:01:03,136
<i>Good night and God bless.</i>

1299
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:07,582
Trump that, Senator Neal,
you Howdy-Doody-looking vontz.

1300
01:01:07,616 --> 01:01:10,585
<i>As we reported earlier, U.S.
Serviceman Willie Schumann...</i>

1301
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:12,348
<i>remains missing behind
enemy lines...</i>

1302
01:01:12,388 --> 01:01:14,754
<i>It's all thinking ahead.</i>

1303
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,280
<i>That's what producing is.</i>

1304
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:17,815
<i>It's like being a plumber.</i>

1305
01:01:19,662 --> 01:01:22,187
Do your job right,
nobody should notice.

1306
01:01:22,231 --> 01:01:25,132
When you fuck up,
everything gets full of shit.

1307
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:26,896
<i>... symbol of
the military team...</i>

1308
01:01:26,936 --> 01:01:29,905
<i>Sergeant William Schumann,
the "Old Shoe."</i>

1309
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:32,601
<i>Let's line up the president
for the Peace Prize.</i>

1310
01:01:32,641 --> 01:01:34,541
Our job ends on election day.

1311
01:01:34,577 --> 01:01:36,306
Come on.

1312
01:01:36,345 --> 01:01:39,508
Just for the symmetry
of the thing?

1313
01:01:39,548 --> 01:01:40,810
<i>That's right.</i>

1314
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,613
If Kissinger can win
the Peace Prize...

1315
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:45,916
<i>I wouldn't be surprised
if I'd won the Preakness.</i>

1316
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:49,482
But our guy did bring peace.

1317
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:51,049
<i>But there wasn't a war.</i>

1318
01:01:51,093 --> 01:01:53,653
All the greater accomplishment.

1319
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,248
<i>Where's the money...</i>

1320
01:02:13,282 --> 01:02:16,080
<i>where's the tie-in
with throwing away shoes?</i>

1321
01:02:16,118 --> 01:02:17,813
Who pays you for that?

1322
01:02:17,853 --> 01:02:20,185
You throw away shoes.
What are you gonna do?

1323
01:02:20,222 --> 01:02:21,689
Buy new ones.

1324
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:23,919
We have some powerful
new friends...

1325
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:26,894
at the International Association
of Shoe Manufacturers.

1326
01:02:26,929 --> 01:02:28,590
You guys sure get around.

1327
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:30,758
Fad King is my hero.
Want to go first?

1328
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,563
Sure.

1329
01:02:32,601 --> 01:02:35,161
Attaboy.

1330
01:02:35,204 --> 01:02:36,865
History, Connie.

1331
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:40,331
Those are ratty shoes.

1332
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:42,606
<i>That's why
we're flinging them away.</i>

1333
01:02:42,645 --> 01:02:45,637
You want to try some?
Go ahead.

1334
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:47,308
Attaboy.

1335
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:49,214
Do it again.

1336
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:51,014
Go ahead. Have a ball.

1337
01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:56,716
Watch this.

1338
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:01,520
Go on, tell your friends.

1339
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,997
<i>This is interesting.</i>

1340
01:03:06,035 --> 01:03:09,903
<i>I havejust been handed this.
Something just discovered.</i>

1341
01:03:09,939 --> 01:03:13,636
<i>A 1930s recording, part of
the folk song collection...</i>

1342
01:03:13,676 --> 01:03:15,200
<i>Of the Library of Congress...</i>

1343
01:03:15,244 --> 01:03:18,611
<i>and a fitting song,
if I may say so, about Shoe.</i>

1344
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:20,444
<i>Schumann
is the military soldier...</i>

1345
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:22,382
<i>who's been left behind
enemy lines...</i>

1346
01:03:30,993 --> 01:03:32,824
<i>Jim, can I get a word with you?</i>

1347
01:03:32,862 --> 01:03:34,955
<i>Would you like to comment
on Albania?</i>

1348
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,931
<i>There is one thing
I'd like to say.</i>

1349
01:03:38,968 --> 01:03:42,870
<i>This is to the Albanians
that have this man.</i>

1350
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:46,204
<i>I mean this from the bottom
of my heart as one of your race.</i>

1351
01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:51,406
<i>I didn't know Jim Belushi
was Albanian.</i>

1352
01:03:57,853 --> 01:03:59,684
<i>The search for
Willie Schumann continues...</i>

1353
01:04:29,652 --> 01:04:32,052
As soon as we land,
I want a reflexologist.

1354
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:33,349
Male or female?

1355
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:35,016
The White House
wants to know about...

1356
01:04:35,057 --> 01:04:36,319
the Congressional Medal
of Honor.

1357
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:37,916
- What about it?
- For Schumann.

1358
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,554
Wait a minute.
We got 86% in favor.

1359
01:04:40,596 --> 01:04:43,861
<i>We bring him back tomorrow,
charts don't go down.</i>

1360
01:04:43,899 --> 01:04:45,491
<i>I don't want to tell them
how to do their business...</i>

1361
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:47,001
<i>but why don't they do it
after the election?</i>

1362
01:04:47,036 --> 01:04:49,266
<i>Makes more sense,
and it'll help them more.</i>

1363
01:04:49,305 --> 01:04:51,330
When are you bringing him back?

1364
01:04:51,373 --> 01:04:53,341
King, show him the thing.

1365
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:56,208
<i>- It's not done yet.
- Show it to him.</i>

1366
01:04:56,245 --> 01:04:59,874
Talk about enlarging the market.
Tell him.

1367
01:04:59,915 --> 01:05:02,440
<i>Here it is. Artist's rendering
of the memorial.</i>

1368
01:05:02,484 --> 01:05:03,815
The memorial?

1369
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:06,412
<i>That's the memorial
of the fallen.</i>

1370
01:05:06,455 --> 01:05:07,820
Of the Albanian campaign.

1371
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:09,881
<i>- Lovely.
- It's better than lovely.</i>

1372
01:05:09,925 --> 01:05:11,984
This guy made a deal
with Governor Kneehigh...

1373
01:05:12,027 --> 01:05:13,688
Senator Leahy.

1374
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:16,254
You should see the granite
you have to put in this thing.

1375
01:05:16,298 --> 01:05:18,232
Got a site picked out
and everything.

1376
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:20,235
The beauty part is...

1377
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:22,169
guess who retains
the merchandising rights.

1378
01:05:22,204 --> 01:05:23,865
Show him the clock?

1379
01:05:23,906 --> 01:05:25,669
Got it as a clock.

1380
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:27,369
Lovely.

1381
01:05:27,409 --> 01:05:29,570
<i>- Let's go.
- When's Schumann coming back?</i>

1382
01:05:29,611 --> 01:05:30,908
Getting him right now.

1383
01:05:30,946 --> 01:05:33,346
I need his neck size.

1384
01:05:33,382 --> 01:05:34,644
<i>I think it's 171l2.</i>

1385
01:05:34,683 --> 01:05:36,878
<i>Thinking 171l2
is not good enough.</i>

1386
01:05:36,919 --> 01:05:39,513
<i>I'm an artist,
not a factory worker.</i>

1387
01:05:39,555 --> 01:05:41,682
What did he eat
behind enemy lines?

1388
01:05:41,724 --> 01:05:43,316
Birds, snakes.

1389
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:46,328
Bullshit. He ate
tiny cheeseburgers in tin foil.

1390
01:05:46,362 --> 01:05:47,761
Pull a string,
they heat themselves.

1391
01:05:47,796 --> 01:05:49,764
We call Burger King,
Johnny Rockets.

1392
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:52,266
We get the Shoe Burger
with cheese and 303 sauce...

1393
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:54,997
<i>"Behind enemy lines or anytime."</i>

1394
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:56,504
<i>That's the slogan.</i>

1395
01:05:56,538 --> 01:05:59,371
I got the copyright
on the Albanian kitten thing.

1396
01:05:59,408 --> 01:06:01,535
<i>I'm gonna call Nike,
get Rodman to dye his hair.</i>

1397
01:06:01,577 --> 01:06:03,477
<i>We'll have a sneaker...
"Air Leopard."</i>

1398
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:09,012
<i>... a high school
basketball game last night...</i>

1399
01:06:09,051 --> 01:06:11,747
<i>between Montgomery Bell
and Blair Park.</i>

1400
01:06:11,787 --> 01:06:13,254
<i>Students, during the game...</i>

1401
01:06:13,288 --> 01:06:15,916
<i>in spontaneous moment
of sheer patriotism...</i>

1402
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:19,223
<i>threw their tennis shoes
on the court by the hundreds,</i>

1403
01:06:19,261 --> 01:06:20,785
<i>just for the Old Shoe.</i>

1404
01:06:20,829 --> 01:06:23,593
<i>Bring him back.
William Schumann...</i>

1405
01:06:23,632 --> 01:06:25,600
<i>There's no business like it.</i>

1406
01:06:25,634 --> 01:06:28,228
<i>Demonstrations are springing up
all over the country...</i>

1407
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,000
<i>as Americans
show their patriotism.</i>

1408
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,237
You ought to get them to run
that inaugural speech by me.

1409
01:06:34,276 --> 01:06:36,176
<i>Inaugural speech?
I don't know.</i>

1410
01:06:36,211 --> 01:06:38,543
<i>The White House staff
won't give up that one.</i>

1411
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,607
Come on. Let me close out
the thing in style.

1412
01:06:42,651 --> 01:06:44,744
<i>I've come to feel it's my thing.</i>

1413
01:06:44,787 --> 01:06:48,279
<i>You take ajob, and many times,
it's just ajob...</i>

1414
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:51,919
Hell of a ride.

1415
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,518
<i>Isn't it?</i>

1416
01:06:53,562 --> 01:06:55,120
You take the bitter
with the sweet...

1417
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:56,859
or the sweet with the bitter.

1418
01:06:56,899 --> 01:06:58,196
<i>What's that expression?</i>

1419
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,871
<i>... feeling good
about the economy.</i>

1420
01:07:04,907 --> 01:07:06,841
<i>That's why we're voting
for the president, Ed.</i>

1421
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,172
<i>What do you think?</i>

1422
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:12,613
<i>Bob, my mind wasn't
100% made up, but now it is.</i>

1423
01:07:12,648 --> 01:07:16,311
<i>Don't go changing horses
in midstream.</i>

1424
01:07:17,886 --> 01:07:19,581
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1425
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:22,522
<i>Who needs surprises these days?</i>

1426
01:07:22,558 --> 01:07:24,048
<i>For an economy
you can rely on...</i>

1427
01:07:24,093 --> 01:07:25,856
Fucking amateurs.

1428
01:07:27,529 --> 01:07:31,056
Pity of it is, two more days,
and we bring it back home.

1429
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,192
Knock wood.

1430
01:07:32,968 --> 01:07:34,458
<i>Who's gonna know?</i>

1431
01:07:35,304 --> 01:07:37,295
<i>Who's gonna know what we did?</i>

1432
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:40,132
Pride of ajob well done, Stan.

1433
01:07:40,175 --> 01:07:43,406
<i>It's the pride of ajob
well done, but it's more.</i>

1434
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,072
<i>It's the gratitude of your party
and your president, right?</i>

1435
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:51,408
- Is that the thing?
- Indeed it is.

1436
01:07:53,722 --> 01:07:56,816
Dean City, Oklahoma.
Army special programs.

1437
01:07:56,859 --> 01:07:58,554
<i>Tell 'em to bring
Schumann to the plane.</i>

1438
01:07:58,594 --> 01:08:01,028
<i>We'll bring him back
and stash him in the hospital.</i>

1439
01:08:01,063 --> 01:08:04,157
Call the plane.
Tell me where to pick him up.

1440
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:06,224
<i>I bet you're good at chess.</i>

1441
01:08:07,436 --> 01:08:09,961
I would be, I could remember
how all the pieces move.

1442
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:12,038
<i>We'll call you.</i>

1443
01:08:13,142 --> 01:08:18,079
<i>I'll do the same
in His great name...</i>

1444
01:08:18,113 --> 01:08:21,082
<i>if you have courage, Mom.</i>

1445
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:26,381
<i>I can always feel your love.</i>

1446
01:08:27,723 --> 01:08:30,419
<i>Send, and I'll receive.</i>

1447
01:08:32,561 --> 01:08:35,029
Units of 303,
the Defense Department...

1448
01:08:35,063 --> 01:08:37,088
confirmed early this morning,
Albanian time...

1449
01:08:37,132 --> 01:08:40,966
stormed the mountain hideaway
near the city of...

1450
01:08:41,003 --> 01:08:43,904
freeing a tired but happy
William Schumann.

1451
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:46,169
A high White House source
confirms...

1452
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,904
<i>that he's expected
in Washington tomorrow morning.</i>

1453
01:08:48,944 --> 01:08:50,206
<i>How's that?</i>

1454
01:08:57,052 --> 01:08:58,917
When we touch down tomorrow...

1455
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:00,581
Big Bird meets Schumann
at the airport?

1456
01:09:00,622 --> 01:09:03,420
Big mistake. You got to bring
him in by stages.

1457
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:06,359
Big mistake to reveal
Schumann before the election.

1458
01:09:06,395 --> 01:09:07,657
How so?

1459
01:09:07,696 --> 01:09:10,290
Sweetheart,
Schumann is the shark.

1460
01:09:10,332 --> 01:09:12,300
Schumann is Jaws.

1461
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:14,734
<i>You have to tease 'em.</i>

1462
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:18,103
<i>You don't put Jaws
in the first reel of the movie.</i>

1463
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,108
<i>It's the contract, sweetheart.</i>

1464
01:09:20,142 --> 01:09:22,940
The contract with the election,
whether they know it or not...

1465
01:09:22,978 --> 01:09:24,946
is vote for me Tuesday...

1466
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:27,244
Wednesday,
I will produce Schumann.

1467
01:09:27,282 --> 01:09:29,409
<i>That's what they're paying
their seven bucks for.</i>

1468
01:09:29,451 --> 01:09:31,009
Know what I mean?

1469
01:09:31,053 --> 01:09:32,816
Whatever.

1470
01:09:32,854 --> 01:09:34,321
<i>Everybody's gotta learn.</i>

1471
01:09:34,356 --> 01:09:35,880
Any business.

1472
01:09:37,893 --> 01:09:39,155
You take the fruit
of 40 years...

1473
01:09:39,194 --> 01:09:41,458
hard lessons, mistakes,
and you call it wisdom.

1474
01:09:41,496 --> 01:09:42,724
<i>That's the truth.</i>

1475
01:09:42,764 --> 01:09:45,198
End of the day,
just when you know something...

1476
01:09:45,234 --> 01:09:46,792
time to go home.

1477
01:09:46,835 --> 01:09:49,099
You got decades in you now.

1478
01:09:49,137 --> 01:09:51,264
You got decades left in you.

1479
01:09:51,306 --> 01:09:52,466
Yeah, but...

1480
01:09:54,576 --> 01:09:55,907
What could I do to top this?

1481
01:09:57,646 --> 01:10:01,514
<i>The 37th Psalm.</i>

1482
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:06,249
<i>I'll do the same
in His great name...</i>

1483
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:09,086
<i>if you have courage, Mom.</i>

1484
01:10:09,124 --> 01:10:11,957
You see her?
That was real tears.

1485
01:10:11,994 --> 01:10:14,224
We were gonna give her
those drops.

1486
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:16,390
- She cried.
- Really?

1487
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:18,865
- She cried real.
- It looks it.

1488
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,368
<i>Pray for me...</i>

1489
01:10:21,403 --> 01:10:23,735
<i>and the USA.</i>

1490
01:10:23,772 --> 01:10:27,173
<i>Pray they never use the bomb.</i>

1491
01:10:28,944 --> 01:10:31,105
What are you going
to do after this?

1492
01:10:31,146 --> 01:10:32,773
They owe you big.

1493
01:10:32,814 --> 01:10:35,248
Ambassador to this or that,
whatever.

1494
01:10:35,284 --> 01:10:36,751
Ambassador to what?

1495
01:10:36,785 --> 01:10:38,616
<i>I don't even like to go
to Brentwood.</i>

1496
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:43,214
<i>That's what I want.</i>

1497
01:10:43,258 --> 01:10:44,725
<i>That's my reward.</i>

1498
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,988
<i>That's the payoff.</i>

1499
01:10:46,028 --> 01:10:48,326
You want to go to the Inaugural?

1500
01:10:48,363 --> 01:10:51,059
Might if I was asked.

1501
01:11:12,921 --> 01:11:15,583
This here, Schumann and us...

1502
01:11:15,624 --> 01:11:18,058
Look at that.
King Kong and the trainers.

1503
01:11:18,093 --> 01:11:20,027
This is it.

1504
01:11:22,297 --> 01:11:25,130
<i>I'm standing with this picture
of Sergeant Willie Schumann.</i>

1505
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:28,967
<i>He's become known to Americans
simply as the Old Shoe...</i>

1506
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:31,097
This is gonna be a masterpiece.

1507
01:11:31,139 --> 01:11:32,936
Giving them what they want.

1508
01:11:32,974 --> 01:11:36,569
<i>... his Group 303 and left behind
in enemy territory.</i>

1509
01:11:36,611 --> 01:11:39,079
<i>Here at
Andrews Air Force Base...</i>

1510
01:11:39,114 --> 01:11:40,945
<i>they prepare for the return
of Willie Schumann.</i>

1511
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:51,457
Sergeant Schumann, if I may,
welcome to history.

1512
01:11:51,493 --> 01:11:53,290
<i>Sergeant Schumann, I'm Ames.</i>

1513
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:54,989
Somebody named Brean?

1514
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,497
Right here.

1515
01:11:56,531 --> 01:11:58,226
Sign here for me.

1516
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:02,233
Captain,
you want to take her up?

1517
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:03,669
<i>There's heavy weather back east.</i>

1518
01:12:03,705 --> 01:12:05,002
What do you think?

1519
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,565
<i>6 to 5 and pick 'em.
You want to chance it?</i>

1520
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:09,736
<i>If it'll fly, let's fly.
People are waiting.</i>

1521
01:12:15,484 --> 01:12:17,816
A child at the airport
breaks through the ranks...

1522
01:12:17,853 --> 01:12:21,653
<i>runs to Old Shoe,
rubs meat on Schumann's cuff.</i>

1523
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:24,250
A little dog runs to it.
The dog loves Schumann.

1524
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:26,658
He is a perfect war hero.

1525
01:12:26,695 --> 01:12:28,094
Perfect.

1526
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:29,995
You cast him.

1527
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:31,692
All right. Book it up.

1528
01:12:34,903 --> 01:12:36,302
<i>What's this?</i>

1529
01:12:36,338 --> 01:12:38,033
Keys to the manacles.

1530
01:12:41,276 --> 01:12:43,107
Oh, my God.

1531
01:12:43,145 --> 01:12:45,045
Wait.

1532
01:12:52,721 --> 01:12:55,383
What is the trouble?

1533
01:12:55,424 --> 01:12:57,915
<i>No trouble at all, ma'am.</i>

1534
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:59,824
Then why is he in chains?

1535
01:13:00,829 --> 01:13:02,854
<i>He's in chains
because he's a convict.</i>

1536
01:13:04,099 --> 01:13:05,361
A convict?

1537
01:13:09,905 --> 01:13:10,997
How you doing?

1538
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,114
Take a look.

1539
01:13:31,426 --> 01:13:34,190
When we asked
for special programs...

1540
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:35,924
they gave us special prisons.

1541
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:38,057
Only a one-word difference.

1542
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:40,829
- Has he been in jail long?
- 12 years.

1543
01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:42,268
Does he have much longer
to serve?

1544
01:13:44,372 --> 01:13:45,566
What did he do?

1545
01:13:45,607 --> 01:13:47,370
He raped a nun.

1546
01:13:48,844 --> 01:13:51,745
<i>- And...
- I don't want to know an "and."</i>

1547
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,747
<i>Why is there an "and"?</i>

1548
01:13:53,782 --> 01:13:56,945
<i>He's fine as long
as he gets his medications.</i>

1549
01:13:56,985 --> 01:13:58,919
<i>And if he doesn't?</i>

1550
01:13:58,954 --> 01:14:00,251
<i>He's not fine.</i>

1551
01:14:03,492 --> 01:14:04,925
Up there, Captain.

1552
01:14:06,862 --> 01:14:08,625
<i>You'd better get us
to Washington.</i>

1553
01:14:14,135 --> 01:14:15,397
How are ya?

1554
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:18,762
Fine.

1555
01:14:28,884 --> 01:14:30,408
Gonna get me back tomorrow?

1556
01:14:30,452 --> 01:14:34,013
<i>'Cause, you know, tomorrow
they're having beans.</i>

1557
01:14:34,055 --> 01:14:36,580
I need a readjustment.
We have to rethink this.

1558
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,024
Beans!

1559
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:39,993
<i>We're trying to do this thing.</i>

1560
01:14:40,028 --> 01:14:43,464
As long as you
get me back for the beans.

1561
01:14:43,498 --> 01:14:45,523
<i>He's sicker than we thought.</i>

1562
01:14:45,567 --> 01:14:49,196
Rush him under wraps
to Walter Reed for tests.

1563
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:52,434
<i>If you're gonna keep me out,
I'd like to go to church.</i>

1564
01:14:52,474 --> 01:14:53,873
You know what I mean?

1565
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,241
Are you very religious?

1566
01:15:01,683 --> 01:15:03,412
What have you done to me?

1567
01:15:05,921 --> 01:15:08,947
All combat takes place
at night in the rain...

1568
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:10,514
at the junction
of four map segments.

1569
01:15:10,559 --> 01:15:11,958
What are you going to do?

1570
01:15:11,993 --> 01:15:13,961
<i>He's fine as long
as he gets his medication.</i>

1571
01:15:13,995 --> 01:15:17,954
<i>Speaking of that,
we're gonna need lots of this.</i>

1572
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:19,830
Get on the phone and get it.

1573
01:15:19,868 --> 01:15:22,496
You people are looking
at this wrong.

1574
01:15:22,537 --> 01:15:24,505
If you look at the back story...

1575
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:26,632
the guy is coming back
from combat and torture...

1576
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:28,609
<i>of course he's going to be
a little fucked up.</i>

1577
01:15:29,878 --> 01:15:31,311
<i>He's gonna need help.</i>

1578
01:15:31,346 --> 01:15:34,941
<i>Anybody want a beer?
'Cause I could party.</i>

1579
01:15:34,983 --> 01:15:36,848
<i>I'm gonna need an ambulance.</i>

1580
01:15:36,885 --> 01:15:38,648
We take him the last moment
from the plane.

1581
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:42,555
We land, take him
from the plane to the ambulance.

1582
01:15:42,591 --> 01:15:45,685
Air Force jet lands, we take
somebody else from that jet.

1583
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:47,922
What the fuck do I care?

1584
01:15:47,963 --> 01:15:49,521
Somebody in a hospital gown.

1585
01:15:49,564 --> 01:15:51,225
You get me back for the beans.

1586
01:15:51,266 --> 01:15:52,733
<i>'Cause tomorrow's the beans.</i>

1587
01:15:52,767 --> 01:15:54,359
<i>'Cause this dog
ain't gonna hunt.</i>

1588
01:15:54,402 --> 01:15:56,802
<i>He's gonna be fine.</i>

1589
01:15:56,838 --> 01:15:58,100
<i>Aren't you, William?</i>

1590
01:15:58,139 --> 01:16:00,664
Speaking of which,
I have a prescription here.

1591
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:03,041
I want you standing by
with a lot of this stuff.

1592
01:16:03,078 --> 01:16:04,943
<i>A crate of it. It's...</i>

1593
01:16:07,182 --> 01:16:08,513
Anti-psychotic.

1594
01:16:09,384 --> 01:16:10,976
The number is V...

1595
01:16:13,054 --> 01:16:14,316
This is nothing.

1596
01:16:14,356 --> 01:16:16,347
I used to think
I was a pharmacist...

1597
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:17,722
the stuff I carried.

1598
01:16:17,759 --> 01:16:21,320
<i>With the beans, you can tell
if they're puttin' stuff in it.</i>

1599
01:16:22,897 --> 01:16:25,229
<i>So you don't have to fear it.</i>

1600
01:16:26,534 --> 01:16:27,933
What kind of stuff?

1601
01:16:30,772 --> 01:16:33,002
What do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1602
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:38,435
He just wanted to know
what you meant.

1603
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,947
Did you mean?

1604
01:16:39,981 --> 01:16:42,108
<i>- I didn't.
- He didn't mean.</i>

1605
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:44,584
<i>- He didn't mean anything.
- You meant something.</i>

1606
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:45,847
<i>He didn't mean anything.</i>

1607
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:47,479
Give him another pill.

1608
01:16:47,522 --> 01:16:51,356
What the fuck do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1609
01:16:51,393 --> 01:16:53,554
Pill, William.

1610
01:16:53,962 --> 01:16:56,863
This is nothing.
Did you ever shoot in Italy?

1611
01:16:56,898 --> 01:17:00,231
Try three starlets swacked-out
on Benzedrine and grappa.

1612
01:17:00,268 --> 01:17:02,202
This is nothing.

1613
01:17:02,237 --> 01:17:04,330
This is a walk in the park.

1614
01:17:06,908 --> 01:17:08,239
Who are you?

1615
01:17:08,276 --> 01:17:10,005
Who are you sons of bitches?

1616
01:17:10,045 --> 01:17:12,605
- Killers!
- Just calm down.

1617
01:17:12,647 --> 01:17:14,444
Where are you taking me?

1618
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,851
Oh, my God!

1619
01:17:23,858 --> 01:17:26,019
<i>Sergeant Willie Schumann
is coming home.</i>

1620
01:17:26,061 --> 01:17:28,552
<i>Schumann's plane should be
over the Atlantic Ocean...</i>

1621
01:17:28,596 --> 01:17:31,326
<i>making its final descent
back into this country.</i>

1622
01:17:31,366 --> 01:17:32,663
<i>The White House reported...</i>

1623
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:35,898
<i>he was safely rescued
and on his way to American soil.</i>

1624
01:17:35,937 --> 01:17:37,905
<i>We're still waiting
for his plane...</i>

1625
01:17:37,939 --> 01:17:39,497
<i>at Andrews Air Force Base.</i>

1626
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:42,806
<i>A plane that is due to land.
Long overdue.</i>

1627
01:17:42,844 --> 01:17:45,574
<i>The president is monitoring
the situation...</i>

1628
01:17:45,613 --> 01:17:47,581
<i>personally and closely.</i>

1629
01:17:47,615 --> 01:17:49,947
<i>We will keep you updated
as to any developments.</i>

1630
01:17:49,984 --> 01:17:51,281
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1631
01:17:51,319 --> 01:17:53,810
Oh, God.
What do we do now?

1632
01:17:55,056 --> 01:17:57,149
What do we do now, boy producer?

1633
01:17:57,192 --> 01:17:59,717
Mister win-an-Emmy,
social-conscience, whale-shit...

1634
01:17:59,761 --> 01:18:02,195
save-the-rain-forest,
peacenik-commie...

1635
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:04,460
<i>fuckin'- hire-a-convict shithead?</i>

1636
01:18:04,499 --> 01:18:07,798
What do we do now, liberal,
affirmative action, shithead...

1637
01:18:07,836 --> 01:18:09,497
peacenik commie fuck?

1638
01:18:11,139 --> 01:18:14,336
This is nothing.
Piece of cake.

1639
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:17,105
Producing
is being a samurai warrior.

1640
01:18:17,145 --> 01:18:18,840
They pay you day in,
day out for years...

1641
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,542
so that one day,
when called upon...

1642
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:24,552
you can respond,
your training at its peak...

1643
01:18:24,586 --> 01:18:26,213
and save the day!

1644
01:18:30,024 --> 01:18:31,685
<i>Produce this Schumann.</i>

1645
01:18:31,726 --> 01:18:33,387
<i>Produce him, I say...</i>

1646
01:18:33,428 --> 01:18:34,952
<i>or, and I don't hesitate
to say this...</i>

1647
01:18:34,996 --> 01:18:39,456
<i>rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.</i>

1648
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:43,301
<i>This tardy absence of the flight
must give us pause...</i>

1649
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:47,866
<i>and in that pause, we should
take time to examine ourselves...</i>

1650
01:18:47,909 --> 01:18:49,342
Fuck you.

1651
01:18:49,377 --> 01:18:51,538
Leave it alone.
What did television do to you?

1652
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:54,207
It destroyed
the electoral process.

1653
01:18:54,249 --> 01:18:57,343
<i>Enough lovemaking.
Let's go. Come on.</i>

1654
01:18:57,385 --> 01:19:00,513
- Where?
- We got work to do.

1655
01:19:00,555 --> 01:19:02,022
Come on, pal.

1656
01:19:02,056 --> 01:19:03,523
Is it time for exercise?

1657
01:19:03,558 --> 01:19:05,549
<i>It's my day in the yard.</i>

1658
01:19:05,593 --> 01:19:07,322
<i>Let's get him to the highway.</i>

1659
01:19:07,362 --> 01:19:09,762
Think this is tough?
Come on, pal!

1660
01:19:09,798 --> 01:19:12,130
This is nothing! Piece of cake!

1661
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,862
Albanian dissidents...

1662
01:19:13,902 --> 01:19:16,769
having somehow obtained
a surface-to-air missile...

1663
01:19:16,805 --> 01:19:19,273
You had your fortune here.

1664
01:19:19,307 --> 01:19:21,241
You were ready to throw it away.

1665
01:19:21,276 --> 01:19:24,541
<i>If you got a problem, solve it.
That's producing.</i>

1666
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:27,878
Someday when they
tell this story...

1667
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:29,383
<i>You can't tell this story.</i>

1668
01:19:29,417 --> 01:19:31,908
- Why not?
- Somebody would have you killed.

1669
01:19:31,953 --> 01:19:34,353
Of course, I know.

1670
01:19:34,389 --> 01:19:38,189
Not now. But when
they do tell the story...

1671
01:19:38,226 --> 01:19:41,354
Nobody can tell this story,
ever.

1672
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:46,028
Listen to me.
This is what I do for a living.

1673
01:19:46,935 --> 01:19:49,096
<i>You can't tell this story.
He's not kidding you.</i>

1674
01:19:49,137 --> 01:19:51,264
<i>You can't tell this story.
You knew that.</i>

1675
01:19:51,306 --> 01:19:53,399
The deal was you get
an ambassadorship.

1676
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:56,768
I used to have a Camaro.

1677
01:19:56,811 --> 01:19:59,405
<i>What are you going to tell?
The guy's a nut case.</i>

1678
01:19:59,447 --> 01:20:01,642
You would be too if you went
through what he went through.

1679
01:20:01,683 --> 01:20:03,150
He raped a nun.

1680
01:20:03,184 --> 01:20:04,412
What he went through in Albania.

1681
01:20:04,452 --> 01:20:05,783
<i>He's doped to the gills.</i>

1682
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,185
<i>Where's my little pills?</i>

1683
01:20:07,222 --> 01:20:08,450
Show some compassion.

1684
01:20:08,489 --> 01:20:10,787
He spent the last 12 years
in a military prison.

1685
01:20:10,825 --> 01:20:12,986
How are we gonna explain that?

1686
01:20:13,027 --> 01:20:15,393
Explain it? Am I worried?

1687
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:17,330
How do we explain that
when the world is watching?

1688
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:19,833
Fuck the world.
Try a 10 a.m. Pitch meeting...

1689
01:20:19,868 --> 01:20:22,336
<i>cooked to the gills, and you
haven't read the treatment.</i>

1690
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:24,395
How do we explain
he was in prison?

1691
01:20:25,506 --> 01:20:26,871
Well, you see, Winifred...

1692
01:20:26,908 --> 01:20:29,206
<i>this is where
you've never been at a pitch.</i>

1693
01:20:29,244 --> 01:20:30,643
His records say he was
in prison...

1694
01:20:30,678 --> 01:20:33,841
as they say for all the men
and women of Group 303...

1695
01:20:33,882 --> 01:20:37,613
as they must
because of the secrecy involved.

1696
01:20:55,403 --> 01:20:56,836
<i>I'm on top of it.</i>

1697
01:20:56,871 --> 01:20:58,896
Not sure whether enemy action...

1698
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,407
<i>I'm fine. I got it.</i>

1699
01:21:01,943 --> 01:21:04,639
Stanley, I told you,
I do this for a living.

1700
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:06,306
You do what for a living?

1701
01:21:06,347 --> 01:21:07,974
Exactly what do you do
for the president?

1702
01:21:08,016 --> 01:21:10,348
I lost my wallet.
You got any change?

1703
01:21:12,487 --> 01:21:14,045
How we doing, boy?

1704
01:21:14,088 --> 01:21:15,612
Ready to mix it up?

1705
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:17,488
Is today laundry day?

1706
01:21:17,525 --> 01:21:20,494
- What do you do on laundry day?
- Laundry.

1707
01:21:20,528 --> 01:21:23,190
Stand by to copy this.
Just get a pencil.

1708
01:21:23,231 --> 01:21:24,698
Down safely.

1709
01:21:24,732 --> 01:21:26,859
<i>Produce this Schumann.</i>

1710
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:30,234
<i>Produce him, I say, or, and
I don't hesitate to say this...</i>

1711
01:21:30,271 --> 01:21:34,401
<i>rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.</i>

1712
01:21:34,442 --> 01:21:35,909
Sustained minor injuries.

1713
01:21:35,944 --> 01:21:38,344
Flight crew being investigated
for possible pilot error.

1714
01:21:38,379 --> 01:21:40,404
Transshipped
to an undisclosed location.

1715
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:45,249
<i>This deserted runway should be
filled with well-wishers.</i>

1716
01:21:45,286 --> 01:21:48,585
How you doing?
A cold drink?

1717
01:21:48,623 --> 01:21:51,114
<i>Schumann was to return
to American soil today...</i>

1718
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:53,184
<i>after his safe rescue
in Albania.</i>

1719
01:21:54,028 --> 01:21:56,258
He looks like me.

1720
01:21:57,532 --> 01:22:00,592
<i>... deserves an explanation
from the White House.</i>

1721
01:22:00,635 --> 01:22:04,799
<i>Wait, we are now going
live to the White House.</i>

1722
01:22:04,839 --> 01:22:07,307
<i>I have an update regarding
the aircraft incident...</i>

1723
01:22:07,342 --> 01:22:09,003
<i>involving Sergeant Schumann.</i>

1724
01:22:09,043 --> 01:22:11,739
<i>He is down safely
and will be transshipped.</i>

1725
01:22:11,779 --> 01:22:14,543
<i>We are informed he has sustained
minor injuries...</i>

1726
01:22:14,582 --> 01:22:16,413
<i>which will require his being
medicated for some time...</i>

1727
01:22:16,451 --> 01:22:18,544
Bring in the cavalry.
Nick of time.

1728
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:22,752
Political shitbirds.
Fuck with us, huh?

1729
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:24,382
<i>They don't know
who they're playing with.</i>

1730
01:22:29,497 --> 01:22:30,828
Purty.

1731
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,500
<i>I'm a little concerned
about the driver of the rig.</i>

1732
01:22:34,535 --> 01:22:36,025
- What rig?
- The harvester.

1733
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:39,096
<i>- What about him?
- He doesn't have his green card.</i>

1734
01:22:44,012 --> 01:22:45,570
So what?

1735
01:22:45,613 --> 01:22:49,208
You want Schumann to be
rescued by an illegal alien?

1736
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:52,310
<i>We can't have Schumann saved
by an illegal immigrant.</i>

1737
01:22:52,353 --> 01:22:54,321
Get on the phone.
Fly in ajudge.

1738
01:22:54,355 --> 01:22:56,846
<i>Get on the phone.
What's all this moping about?</i>

1739
01:23:03,064 --> 01:23:04,725
Do you have any change?

1740
01:23:06,734 --> 01:23:10,101
I like the night life,
I like to boogie.

1741
01:23:12,306 --> 01:23:13,432
Susie!

1742
01:23:13,474 --> 01:23:14,805
William?

1743
01:23:14,842 --> 01:23:16,673
Are you all right?

1744
01:23:20,715 --> 01:23:22,080
Kickball.

1745
01:23:27,755 --> 01:23:30,747
Let me talk to him!

1746
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:32,259
What are you doing?

1747
01:23:32,293 --> 01:23:33,658
I think we should...

1748
01:23:33,694 --> 01:23:37,027
Willie, where are you going?

1749
01:23:38,299 --> 01:23:39,766
Shoester!

1750
01:23:44,572 --> 01:23:48,064
Let me talk to him.
Shoe, you in there?

1751
01:23:48,109 --> 01:23:50,373
<i>I'll kill that son of a bitch.</i>

1752
01:23:50,411 --> 01:23:53,380
I have a relationship.
You want to talk?

1753
01:23:53,414 --> 01:23:55,939
Get you anything you want.
You want some beans?

1754
01:23:55,983 --> 01:23:57,280
Will that do it, Shoester?

1755
01:23:59,654 --> 01:24:01,019
Come on, Shoe!

1756
01:24:03,191 --> 01:24:05,284
<i>He's dead.</i>

1757
01:24:13,768 --> 01:24:14,996
Wait a minute.

1758
01:24:15,036 --> 01:24:17,231
<i>He's not dead. He's alive.</i>

1759
01:24:18,539 --> 01:24:19,904
Strike that.

1760
01:24:26,581 --> 01:24:28,606
So close and yet so far.

1761
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:29,946
What do you mean?

1762
01:24:29,984 --> 01:24:31,383
We were this close.

1763
01:24:31,419 --> 01:24:33,683
This is nothing.

1764
01:24:33,721 --> 01:24:34,949
This just got big.

1765
01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:36,980
<i>Big? He's dead.</i>

1766
01:24:37,024 --> 01:24:38,389
We killed Old Shoe.

1767
01:24:39,794 --> 01:24:42,695
What is better than
the triumphal homecoming...

1768
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:44,425
of a war hero?

1769
01:24:50,872 --> 01:24:51,998
<i>Ready!</i>

1770
01:24:52,773 --> 01:24:53,899
<i>Lift!</i>

1771
01:24:53,941 --> 01:24:56,068
<i>We're gathered here...</i>

1772
01:24:56,711 --> 01:24:59,680
<i>with a cross to bear.</i>

1773
01:24:59,714 --> 01:25:01,875
<i>The bravest men...</i>

1774
01:25:03,017 --> 01:25:05,247
<i>anywhere.</i>

1775
01:25:05,686 --> 01:25:08,177
<i>That this great land...</i>

1776
01:25:08,222 --> 01:25:11,851
<i>will remain free.</i>

1777
01:25:11,893 --> 01:25:13,554
<i>God bless the men...</i>

1778
01:25:13,594 --> 01:25:17,462
<i>of the 303.</i>

1779
01:25:18,032 --> 01:25:20,660
<i>Side by side...</i>

1780
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:23,670
<i>we know no fear.</i>

1781
01:25:23,704 --> 01:25:26,673
<i>Our minds are sharp.</i>

1782
01:25:26,707 --> 01:25:29,642
<i>Our eyes are clear.</i>

1783
01:25:29,677 --> 01:25:32,703
<i>In the air, on land...</i>

1784
01:25:32,747 --> 01:25:35,580
<i>or on the sea...</i>

1785
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,846
<i>we're the fightin' men...</i>

1786
01:25:37,885 --> 01:25:41,480
<i>of the 303.</i>

1787
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:47,558
<i>Give us this day...</i>

1788
01:25:47,595 --> 01:25:50,655
<i>our daily bread...</i>

1789
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:52,996
<i>and leopard skin...</i>

1790
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:56,629
<i>for our head.</i>

1791
01:25:56,671 --> 01:25:58,764
<i>That we may fight...</i>

1792
01:26:06,948 --> 01:26:08,176
Coffee?

1793
01:26:08,216 --> 01:26:09,615
Please.

1794
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:11,743
Looking good.

1795
01:26:11,786 --> 01:26:13,981
Bring it all back home.

1796
01:26:14,021 --> 01:26:16,683
<i>Lassie barks twice, and it's
time to take out the garbage.</i>

1797
01:26:16,724 --> 01:26:18,282
Hell of a show.

1798
01:26:18,326 --> 01:26:19,725
Hell of ajob.

1799
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,421
<i>It's just producing.</i>

1800
01:26:21,462 --> 01:26:24,454
<i>There's no Academy Award
for producing.</i>

1801
01:26:24,498 --> 01:26:25,829
<i>You're kidding.</i>

1802
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:29,433
Where do movies come from
if nobody produces them?

1803
01:26:30,738 --> 01:26:32,467
They come from people like you.

1804
01:26:36,043 --> 01:26:37,840
You just got to take
the bitter with the better.

1805
01:26:37,878 --> 01:26:40,369
<i>Job's almost done...</i>

1806
01:26:40,414 --> 01:26:41,574
knock on wood.

1807
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:43,847
We did a good job.

1808
01:26:43,884 --> 01:26:45,181
<i>That's our reward.</i>

1809
01:26:46,754 --> 01:26:48,449
<i>You can't save the world.</i>

1810
01:26:48,489 --> 01:26:49,820
All you can do is try.

1811
01:26:50,424 --> 01:26:52,255
<i>Ain't that the truth?</i>

1812
01:26:57,832 --> 01:26:59,561
<i>As we said, the president...</i>

1813
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,262
<i>thrust of the Albanian episode
to put him over the top.</i>

1814
01:27:02,303 --> 01:27:05,397
<i>You could say that, Shirley,
but it's not true.</i>

1815
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:06,804
<i>What would be true, then?</i>

1816
01:27:06,841 --> 01:27:09,002
<i>You said it earlier,
if I may rephrase...</i>

1817
01:27:09,043 --> 01:27:11,204
<i>the success
of the president in the polls...</i>

1818
01:27:11,245 --> 01:27:15,545
<i>As of today, 89% favorable.</i>

1819
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:18,143
<i>Based not on the events...</i>

1820
01:27:18,185 --> 01:27:20,745
<i>but on the spin
given to those events.</i>

1821
01:27:20,788 --> 01:27:24,224
<i>What's the lesson here?
Never give up.</i>

1822
01:27:24,258 --> 01:27:25,486
<i>You're right.</i>

1823
01:27:25,526 --> 01:27:26,959
The show must go on.

1824
01:27:26,994 --> 01:27:28,222
Proud tradition.

1825
01:27:28,262 --> 01:27:32,596
I am prouder of this
than anything I ever did.

1826
01:27:32,633 --> 01:27:33,861
You should be.

1827
01:27:33,901 --> 01:27:35,368
I want to thank you.

1828
01:27:39,106 --> 01:27:40,471
You gave me a good opportunity.

1829
01:27:44,378 --> 01:27:47,541
<i>As we said, the president,
a surefire winner...</i>

1830
01:27:47,581 --> 01:27:50,482
<i>and the campaign, many said,
that put him there.</i>

1831
01:27:51,152 --> 01:27:53,177
<i>Another great race today,
Johnny.</i>

1832
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,518
<i>Who you going to ride
in the Stakes?</i>

1833
01:27:55,556 --> 01:27:58,320
<i>Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...</i>

1834
01:27:58,359 --> 01:27:59,553
<i>The message is irrelevant.</i>

1835
01:27:59,593 --> 01:28:01,584
<i>The main element
we have to deal with...</i>

1836
01:28:01,629 --> 01:28:04,154
<i>is that fear is
what's driving a lot of people.</i>

1837
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:05,995
<i>Commercials.</i>

1838
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:09,665
<i>The president is a product.</i>

1839
01:28:10,504 --> 01:28:13,405
<i>He's the President
of the United States at 89%.</i>

1840
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:15,136
<i>Which we're dealing with today.</i>

1841
01:28:15,176 --> 01:28:16,643
<i>Commercials.</i>

1842
01:28:18,012 --> 01:28:20,810
<i>It's time the American people
began to look at that.</i>

1843
01:28:20,848 --> 01:28:23,817
<i>Now we're going
to take your calls.</i>

1844
01:28:23,851 --> 01:28:25,375
<i>The number is 1-800...</i>

1845
01:28:25,419 --> 01:28:27,614
Oh, shit.

1846
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,627
Stanley, what are you doing?

1847
01:28:38,666 --> 01:28:39,963
What am I doing?

1848
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:43,030
<i>I'm going to call somebody.</i>

1849
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:45,669
<i>That's very funny.</i>

1850
01:28:45,706 --> 01:28:47,367
<i>I'm going to get
these people straight.</i>

1851
01:28:47,408 --> 01:28:48,932
<i>You can't do that.</i>

1852
01:28:48,976 --> 01:28:51,274
Watch me.

1853
01:28:55,015 --> 01:28:56,573
You knew the deal
when you signed on.

1854
01:28:56,617 --> 01:28:58,642
Come on. Deals change.

1855
01:28:58,686 --> 01:29:00,449
Sure it is.

1856
01:29:00,488 --> 01:29:03,514
<i>Let's rethink
that ambassadorship.</i>

1857
01:29:03,557 --> 01:29:05,548
<i>I'm talking London.
I'm talking Paris.</i>

1858
01:29:05,593 --> 01:29:07,891
A secret account
for your extra expenses...

1859
01:29:07,928 --> 01:29:09,361
getting laid whenever you want.

1860
01:29:09,397 --> 01:29:10,830
Marine guards will salute you.

1861
01:29:10,865 --> 01:29:13,732
<i>It's tempting, but I got
to answer to a higher calling.</i>

1862
01:29:13,768 --> 01:29:15,736
- Art.
- Money?

1863
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:17,863
You think I did this for money?

1864
01:29:17,905 --> 01:29:20,601
I did this for credit.

1865
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:22,074
<i>You knew
you couldn't take the credit.</i>

1866
01:29:22,109 --> 01:29:23,576
<i>I'm not going to stand here...</i>

1867
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:26,045
and let two dickheads
from film school take it.

1868
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,945
Listen to me.

1869
01:29:27,982 --> 01:29:29,210
Are you nuts?

1870
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,547
Stanley, no fooling.

1871
01:29:30,584 --> 01:29:32,245
<i>You're playing with your life.</i>

1872
01:29:32,286 --> 01:29:33,617
Fuck my life.

1873
01:29:33,654 --> 01:29:35,622
I want the credit.

1874
01:29:35,656 --> 01:29:38,181
Know what the New York Times
said about my last picture?

1875
01:29:38,225 --> 01:29:39,988
<i>They called it
"a thrill ride for the ages..."</i>

1876
01:29:40,027 --> 01:29:41,517
<i>but they didn't mention
the producer.</i>

1877
01:29:41,562 --> 01:29:43,723
They talked
about the costumes...

1878
01:29:43,764 --> 01:29:45,288
but never talked
about the producer.

1879
01:29:45,332 --> 01:29:46,560
You know what
that picture grossed?

1880
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,828
<i>Now I'm going to stand here...</i>

1881
01:29:47,868 --> 01:29:50,029
and let some limp-dick
film-school pansy...

1882
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,298
take the credit?

1883
01:29:51,338 --> 01:29:52,805
<i>You can't do it.</i>

1884
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,808
<i>Don't you tell me that!</i>

1885
01:29:54,842 --> 01:29:57,242
<i>Don't you ever tell me that!</i>

1886
01:29:57,278 --> 01:29:59,041
I am the producer!

1887
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:01,138
<i>If I didn't step up,
you're nowhere!</i>

1888
01:30:01,182 --> 01:30:03,742
I put this together
out of spit and polish!

1889
01:30:03,784 --> 01:30:05,718
Look at that.

1890
01:30:05,753 --> 01:30:08,278
That is a complete
fucking fraud...

1891
01:30:08,322 --> 01:30:11,689
and it looks 100% real.

1892
01:30:17,665 --> 01:30:20,725
<i>It's the best work
I've ever done in my life...</i>

1893
01:30:20,768 --> 01:30:22,963
<i>because it's so honest.</i>

1894
01:30:30,978 --> 01:30:32,946
<i>They told me I couldn't
remake Moby Dick...</i>

1895
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:34,572
from the point of view
of the whale.

1896
01:30:34,615 --> 01:30:36,446
$450 million domestic.

1897
01:30:36,484 --> 01:30:37,951
<i>I'm not even talking
about the video.</i>

1898
01:30:37,985 --> 01:30:40,112
I made this lame turkey fly.

1899
01:30:40,154 --> 01:30:41,746
I did it... pure Hollywood.

1900
01:30:43,424 --> 01:30:46,882
<i>For once in my life,
I won't be pissed on.</i>

1901
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:48,121
Do you hear me?

1902
01:30:49,296 --> 01:30:50,957
I want the credit.

1903
01:30:52,867 --> 01:30:54,801
<i>I'm taking it.</i>

1904
01:30:54,835 --> 01:30:56,530
Shit.

1905
01:31:10,951 --> 01:31:12,976
<i>He's coming down.</i>

1906
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:15,386
Could I see you a minute?
Thanks.

1907
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,486
Do you swear to uphold...

1908
01:31:20,528 --> 01:31:21,995
the duties
and responsibilities...

1909
01:31:22,029 --> 01:31:24,759
of a citizen of
the United States of America...

1910
01:31:24,798 --> 01:31:26,766
to defend her
in time of peril...

1911
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,258
to defend her from all enemies,
foreign and domestic?

1912
01:31:30,304 --> 01:31:32,966
Do you make this pledge
with full resolve?

1913
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:53,191
<i>Common ground...</i>

1914
01:31:53,227 --> 01:31:56,492
<i>and family.</i>

1915
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:57,997
<i>Let's give thanks...</i>

1916
01:31:58,032 --> 01:32:02,435
<i>to the 303.</i>

1917
01:32:02,469 --> 01:32:05,131
<i>Years from now...</i>

1918
01:32:05,172 --> 01:32:08,141
<i>when we are gone...</i>

1919
01:32:08,175 --> 01:32:11,144
<i>our children's kids...</i>

1920
01:32:11,178 --> 01:32:14,545
<i>will hear this song.</i>

1921
01:32:14,582 --> 01:32:17,210
<i>Think how strong...</i>

1922
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:20,584
<i>and proud they'll be.</i>

1923
01:32:20,621 --> 01:32:21,986
<i>Grandpa fought...</i>

1924
01:32:22,022 --> 01:32:26,254
<i>for the 303.</i>

1925
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:28,784
<i>God bless the men...</i>

1926
01:32:28,829 --> 01:32:36,861
<i>of the 303.</i>

1927
01:32:38,138 --> 01:32:39,628
<i>Ten-hut!</i>

1928
01:32:39,673 --> 01:32:42,073
<i>Present arms!</i>

1929
01:32:51,018 --> 01:32:53,782
<i>Turning to the Hollywood page...</i>

1930
01:32:53,821 --> 01:32:56,722
<i>famed film producer
Stanley R. Motss...</i>

1931
01:32:56,757 --> 01:32:59,157
<i>died suddenly
of a massive heart attack...</i>

1932
01:32:59,193 --> 01:33:01,320
<i>while sunbathing poolside.</i>

1933
01:33:01,362 --> 01:33:05,025
<i>Mr. Motss
was 57 or 62-years-old...</i>

1934
01:33:05,065 --> 01:33:07,090
<i>depending on the bio.</i>

1935
01:33:07,134 --> 01:33:09,329
<i>His credits
include numerous films...</i>

1936
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:14,069
<i>which America has come
to love as old classics.</i>

1937
01:33:18,245 --> 01:33:19,473
<i>This just in.</i>

1938
01:33:19,513 --> 01:33:21,913
<i>A group calling itself
"Albania Unite..."</i>

1939
01:33:21,949 --> 01:33:24,474
<i>has claimed responsibility
for the bombing moments ago...</i>

1940
01:33:24,518 --> 01:33:26,349
<i>of the village of Klos, Albania.</i>

1941
01:33:26,387 --> 01:33:28,116
<i>The president
was unavailable for comment...</i>

1942
01:33:28,155 --> 01:33:30,885
<i>but General William Scott
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...</i>

1943
01:33:30,924 --> 01:33:33,358
<i>says he has no doubt we'll
be sending planes and troops...</i>

1944
01:33:33,394 --> 01:33:34,918
<i>back in to finish thejob.</i>
