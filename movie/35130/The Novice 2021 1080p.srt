1
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,299
All right, class is over.

2
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:54,911
You finished first.

3
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,144
Why'd you take it twice?

4
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:51,100
I am and the... Hi.
Whoa! Slow down.

5
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:52,969
You don't gotta run.
You are all good.

6
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,004
Have a seat. You are good.

7
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:57,807
As I was saying, I'm Coach Pete.

8
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,676
I'm the novice rowing coach,

9
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,577
and I presume you guys
are all here for

10
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:04,379
the Wellington
Novice Rowing Program.

11
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:05,515
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:09,284
Okay, so, let's hear
why all of you

13
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,587
came to fly with
the Ravens. Yeah?

14
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,691
All right, we'll go from
the top. You, "caw."

15
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:16,626
Uh, some lady coach emailed me

16
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:17,760
and asked me to try out.

17
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:19,437
Said something about
scholarships

18
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:20,606
if you make it to
sophomore year.

19
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,166
Okay, well, it's
traditionally very hard

20
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:25,101
to move up to varsity,
but, I mean,

21
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,837
I personally would love to see
all of you guys move up,

22
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,173
but in the meantime,
I think we should all...

23
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,874
probably learn how to row,

24
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,609
and just have some fun, yeah?

25
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,377
Okay. You, "caw."

26
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,879
Caw. Like that?

27
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:38,346
Good.

28
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,883
Kidding. Um,
I thought it'd be like,

29
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,552
a good way to, like,
make friends.

30
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:43,953
Friends.

31
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,604
Why are you here?

32
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:11,446
- Um...
- Oh, here they are.

33
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,983
Say hi, everybody.
They're here to help us today.

34
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:16,251
The captain, Highsmith,

35
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:19,421
and the powerhouse of the 1V,

36
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:20,990
Janssen.

37
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:23,401
All right, so most of you guys
have been to the gym, right?

38
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:25,595
And you've seen how
the bros row.

39
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:26,662
Show 'em.

40
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:29,165
That's a bro row.

41
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:30,700
All right?

42
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:33,202
That's a one-way ticket
to a herniated disc.

43
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:34,237
We don't want that.

44
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,972
Janssen, show 'em how it's done.

45
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:37,940
Look at that.

46
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:39,374
You guys see the difference?

47
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:40,710
She's using her legs.

48
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,913
So most people think
rowing is about arms.

49
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,648
Those people are wrong.

50
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,216
It's legs and back, right?

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,851
<i>Correctamundo,</i> Brill

52
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:52,021
It's 60 to 70 percent
lower body.

53
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:53,189
Look at her rhythm.

54
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:55,725
Same way. Every time.

55
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:58,928
See that? Legs, body, arms,
arms, body, legs.

56
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:00,696
Legs, body, arms,

57
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,732
arms, body, legs. In rhythm.

58
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,233
Legs, body, arms,

59
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,102
arms, body, legs.

60
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,137
You see that?
It's the same every time.

61
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,413
- Body, arms...
- Say it with me.

62
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:12,208
Legs, body, arms,
arms, body, legs.

63
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:15,111
Legs, body, arms,
arms, body, legs.

64
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,146
- That's it.
- Legs, body, arms,

65
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,815
arms, body, legs,

66
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:20,283
- Legs, body...
- And you.

67
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:21,584
Hit the lost and found.

68
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:22,985
I'm sorry,
you can't row in that.

69
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,087
Yeah? Okay. Let's go. Good.

70
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,454
Let's go!

71
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,324
Step by step. Row. Good.

72
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:30,669
Posture. A little desperate.
Loose.

73
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,562
Raven claws.
Raven... Legs first.

74
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:34,096
Body then legs. Body, arms.

75
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,599
Line up to the bra strap.
Legs, body, arms.

76
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:39,101
That's groovy. Backwards.
Arms, body, legs.

77
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,903
Legs, body, arms.

78
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:42,839
Arms, body, legs.

79
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,907
Golden. Weigh enough.
Weigh enough.

80
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:47,076
Weigh enough then stop.

81
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:49,420
I mean, there's a better way
to do that,

82
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:50,478
but, you know.

83
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,148
Okay, guys!

84
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:55,685
It's 10,000 hours
to be an expert.

85
00:05:56,185 --> 00:06:00,156
Right now we'll focus on
10,000 strokes, yeah?

86
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,058
Cement it!

87
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:08,164
Legs, body, arms.

88
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:15,838
<i>Body, arms.</i>

89
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:22,612
Yesterday, I just woke up
and I had this epiphany.

90
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:24,914
Like, everyone here was
the top of their high school.

91
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,716
We're all, like,
the same, you know?

92
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:28,383
Like big fish in a small pond.

93
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,986
Mm-hm.

94
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,321
And I know your mom's happy
that we're rooming together.

95
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:33,856
And, I mean, I'm so excited,

96
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,025
we've been dreaming about it
since, like, sixth grade.

97
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,260
<i>Body, legs, arms.</i>

98
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:42,031
<i>Body, legs, arms.</i>

99
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,902
Welcome, novice.

100
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:47,703
This is your boat house.

101
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,372
These are the eights over here,

102
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:51,473
fours over in bay five.

103
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,876
We got the singles, we'll
get into that later in the year.

104
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,978
But dive right in.

105
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:07,957
Cox.

106
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:11,227
I get it. It's funny.

107
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:13,095
That is your one laugh.

108
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,697
You used it up, guys.

109
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,500
There are a lot of funny words
in rowing.

110
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,504
There's cox. Shaft. Crab.

111
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:23,706
Excuse me.
There's crabs in the lake?

112
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:26,909
No. Catching a crab...

113
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:29,512
is rowing's version of a fumble.

114
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,380
It's, uh, you lose control of
the oar,

115
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,715
it could knock your teeth out.

116
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:34,508
It could literally
fling a girl off the boat.

117
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:36,018
It's no joke.

118
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:39,355
Okay. Erin is the 2V cox.
She'll be with us today.

119
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:42,858
She is your eyes out there because you
are literally rowing ass backwards.

120
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,928
She steers the boat, she does
the race plan, yada, yada.

121
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:48,397
She's the furthest thing from
just a cheerleader.

122
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:50,833
Up to shoulders. Ready?

123
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,768
Up.

124
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,672
Walk down. Watch your step.

125
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:58,841
And the tree.

126
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,710
Watch the dock!

127
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:02,712
All right, feet to the edge.

128
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,514
Sorry, excuse me,
it's just... it's raining,

129
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:07,960
- so maybe we could...
- Novice, I just said it's a water sport,

130
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,385
so you will get wet.

131
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,954
Up and over head. Ready? Up.

132
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,990
Down and into water.

133
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:15,424
Ready? Down.

134
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,326
Careful.

135
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,663
Graceful, novice.

136
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,665
Don't put a hole in the boat,
it costs 50K.

137
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,034
Sure you don't want to
go back to the novice stand?

138
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,570
Fifty fucking K for a boat?

139
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,081
Fifty K's, like, their
allowance.

140
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:30,115
They don't even give a shit.

141
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,640
It's raining again.

142
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:34,010
Ports, get the oars,
starboards, the oarlocks.

143
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,013
What?

144
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,352
Just the seat?
You just do it on the seat?

145
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:44,529
- Hands on the dock.
- Oh, I got it.

146
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:46,455
Lean away. Push.

147
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:48,524
Oars!

148
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:51,127
Arms, body, legs!

149
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,930
Legs, body, arms!

150
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:58,034
Arms, body, legs!

151
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,005
Okay, that... that's my fault.

152
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,941
No... No baggy clothes, people!

153
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:06,975
Okay?

154
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:11,380
It's like meant to be.

155
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:13,625
Also, those IV girls are,
like, so nice. Don't you think?

156
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:15,051
You mean 1V.

157
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:18,054
Yeah, yeah.
Well, that's what I said, 1V.

158
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,289
Well, if you make the 1V,
you get a full scholarship,

159
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,291
so better watch out
because I'm comin' for it.

160
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,060
Right. Yeah.

161
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:25,961
- But I'm... I'm serious.
- Right.

162
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:28,075
I made starting varsity in
two sports in high school.

163
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,876
I mean, you're like the best
novice out of all of us,

164
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,702
so you probably have the
best chance out of all of us.

165
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,805
Yeah.

166
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:37,382
Also, did you know
Coach Edwards was novice

167
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,775
and she, like, became
an Olympian, so...

168
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:41,487
I don't give a shit about
the Olympics.

169
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,079
- Look where it got her.
- Right.

170
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah, she's coaching
a third rate team.

171
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,092
At a school where no one even
knows we have a rowing team.

172
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,484
Right. Yeah,
I don't care either.

173
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:00,530
<i>I need a scholarship,
so I'm staying.</i>

174
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:03,999
<i>Yeah, I mean, like,
you're like the best novice.</i>

175
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,769
<i>I mean, you're like the best
novice out of all of us.</i>

176
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:08,637
<i>Scholarship, scholarship,
scholarship...</i>

177
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:11,107
<i>The best novice.</i>

178
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,409
<i>So you probably have the
best chance out of all of us.</i>

179
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,517
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm.

180
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,352
Last 30 seconds.

181
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:24,920
Let's go!

182
00:10:25,454 --> 00:10:26,789
Nice, Brill.

183
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:28,290
Smooth.

184
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,025
Steady.

185
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:32,261
That's what we like, ladies.
Steady.

186
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:34,463
Steady, steady.

187
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,799
Rhythm. Rhythm is everything.

188
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,401
Having fun, Zucker?

189
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,203
Making friends, rowing boats.

190
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:43,372
Nice, ladies.

191
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:45,908
Timing...

192
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,042
is everything.

193
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,723
Good job.

194
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:06,996
Hey, guys,
take a walk, grab a drink.

195
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:12,201
Take a break. Sit.

196
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:27,917
Jamie.

197
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,252
You played volleyball
or basketball?

198
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,320
Both.

199
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:33,989
I knew it.

200
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:35,991
You're a natural.

201
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,802
High 1:30s, low 1:40s.

202
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,446
- You did pretty good, then.
- Put it this way.

203
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,372
Over the course of
a 2,000 meter race,

204
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,708
if you get a 2 flat
and they get a 1:59.2,

205
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,843
they've beaten you by
a full boat length.

206
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:58,214
Races are won and lost by
100ths of a second.

207
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,049
Technique wins and loses races.

208
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,726
- Uh...
- You don't have to raise your hand.

209
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,953
So the varsity,
they do this workout a lot?

210
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:06,855
Today they did
the same workout as you.

211
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:09,693
Six times, and then they
hit the weights.

212
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:13,630
Okay, guys, next Friday is
your first 2K ERG test baseline.

213
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:14,863
What's a good time for that?

214
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,268
What's your name again?

215
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:22,071
- Alex Dall.
- Al... Dall, yeah, um...

216
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:25,709
take the average of your
500 meter time,

217
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,644
multiply them by four,
and then just add...

218
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,044
ten to 20 seconds.

219
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,014
How well do you think
I did today?

220
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,382
- Well, you did great.
- Okay.

221
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:34,651
'Cause I could do better.

222
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:35,827
How well did you think you did?

223
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:37,419
I think I did...

224
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,831
Arms, body, legs.
Legs, body, arms.

225
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,734
Arms, body, legs,
Legs, body, arms.

226
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,570
The party looks kinda shitty.

227
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:54,714
You sure it's
supposed to be good?

228
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:57,339
- They seem nice.
- What, a nice frat?

229
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:58,774
Okay, we can still go back.

230
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:00,686
- No, we're not going back.
- Watch out, watch out.

231
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,945
Excuse me, excuse me. Party up!

232
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,088
- There's not much left.
- Okay.

233
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:08,183
Drink the rest of it.

234
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:09,753
More.

235
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,954
One more. One more. You're good.

236
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:13,088
Let's do it.

237
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:15,958
Oh, my God.

238
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,530
Slow. Slow, slow.

239
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:00,002
- Shit, I think the condom slipped off.
- What?!

240
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,970
I literally had to fish it out.

241
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:04,774
Probably the worst
I ever had, so over eager.

242
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,643
Well, was he like bigger...

243
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,177
or, like, less so?

244
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,045
You know the cliche.
It's not about the...

245
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:11,280
size of the boat,

246
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:12,749
more about the motion
in the ocean.

247
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,685
Well, maybe the second time
will be better.

248
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,120
Are you kidding me?
I just wanted to get

249
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,690
the drunk college
one night stand out of the way.

250
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,157
Check. Done. Next.

251
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,326
Okay, well, positives.

252
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,795
You got to sleep in
your own bed.

253
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:27,896
I slept on the floor of some
sorority girl's room.

254
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:30,165
What?

255
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:31,367
Nothing.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,803
- You're processing.
- I'm not processing.

257
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,839
I'm just trying to
figure something out.

258
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,073
Yeah, that's processing.

259
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:40,109
Mindfulness.

260
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:41,845
- Okay, relax.
- I'm relaxed.

261
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:44,289
Okay, 'cause you really shouldn't
be stressed about school.

262
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:45,914
You were the smartest
in our high school.

263
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:48,785
I'm not stressed about school
and I worked the hardest.

264
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,452
- There's a difference.
- Whatever.

265
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:53,889
Just remember, a 90 and 100
are both 4.0s in college.

266
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:55,023
Okay?

267
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,092
I was worried about you
senior year.

268
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,963
Speaking of weird.
Sorority, really?

269
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,399
I mean, they were
kind of cool, actually.

270
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:04,967
Now, I think I judged them

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,177
before really
getting to know them.

272
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,970
Hey.

273
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:10,707
Jamie.

274
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:12,542
What's up?

275
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:35,130
You took it three times today.
Find any mistakes?

276
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:37,901
- Always.
- Here's your last quiz.

277
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:39,935
See you next week.

278
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:50,856
- Where are the answers?
- Please don't argue with the grade.

279
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,792
- I'm not arguing with the grade.
- Office hours are Monday.

280
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,082
After fall break.

281
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,370
Do you want me to email
the professor for the answers?

282
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,405
- 'Cause I can do that.
- Well, maybe I should thank you.

283
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:08,598
Thank me? why?

284
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:10,041
All this time I spent
waiting on you,

285
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:11,467
I finished my applications
early.

286
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:12,802
To the school of rock?

287
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,938
Doctor programs. Astrophysics.

288
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,941
Top choice is U. of Chicago,
led by Dr. Friedman.

289
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:19,843
She calculated
the age of the universe.

290
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:23,045
Do you want me to pretend
to be impressed?

291
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,147
It's freshman year.

292
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,659
Take if from someone
who's been in your shoes.

293
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:27,884
Overdoing it.

294
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,919
Physics is my worst subject,
so I...

295
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,955
I kind of have to overdo it.

296
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:33,288
Aren't you a physics major?

297
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,894
Okay. I just need
the answer key.

298
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:40,329
13.7 billion years.

299
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:42,130
- What?
- Age of the universe.

300
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:44,667
I think it puts your
meaninglessness into perspective.

301
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,745
- I'll see you after break.
- You know, let me take you out sometime.

302
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,404
Make it up to you for all of
the time of yours I've wasted.

303
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:51,078
I'm a TA, I don't go out
with my students.

304
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:52,575
What are you doing?

305
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:54,978
Getting the answer key.
Thank you!

306
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,318
- Late!
- I know.

307
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,021
Hey, Brill.

308
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:08,357
What are you looking at?

309
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:11,093
See what time
I have to get to make varsity.

310
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:13,768
You're not gonna do the time
that coach recommended?

311
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:15,698
No.

312
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:17,442
I wasn't really trying
that hard,

313
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:18,866
so I don't think it's
very accurate.

314
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:22,939
7:59 seems doable.

315
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,547
7:59, 7:59.

316
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:34,717
7:59.

317
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:38,521
7:59.

318
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:55,323
7:55, Dall. Not bad.

319
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:01,931
7:49, Brill.
You two are on a roll.

320
00:20:02,297 --> 00:20:05,068
Good job, novice.

321
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,672
Up, ladies, up!

322
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:11,941
In the words of Unk,

323
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:13,943
"walk it out."

324
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:20,049
Shit.

325
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:29,826
Good job, Dall.

326
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,095
Just take your time.
You earned it.

327
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:35,498
See you in the weight room.

328
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:38,901
Let's go, ladies.

329
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:40,295
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

330
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:42,031
We learned a lot.

331
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:45,535
Thank you. Bye.

332
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,003
Leave your sweatshirt.

333
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:48,638
Dall.

334
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:52,608
Rowing is not for everyone.

335
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,644
It's a big time commitment.

336
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:57,547
Not everyone is willing
to go the extra mile.

337
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,983
But I am, so if you could just
give me a chance on anything.

338
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:03,719
I mean, I... I could even maybe
stay after or later...

339
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:05,453
No, no, relax, relax.

340
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:09,158
My point is, uh,
Regatta in one week.

341
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,194
I thought it was three...
three weeks.

342
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:13,328
No, no, the novice Regatta
in three weeks.

343
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:15,665
The varsity is in one week.

344
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,999
We are making a fresh four

345
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:19,735
and I don't got enough varsity
to, uh, fill it,

346
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:22,939
so you'll start practicing with
the team in the mornings,

347
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:25,842
if you want,
every day for the next week.

348
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:29,579
- Me?
- Yeah, you. If you want.

349
00:22:30,546 --> 00:22:32,124
Look, it's twice as much work
as you're doing now,

350
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:34,482
you gotta be there at
the lake at 5 a.m. every day.

351
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,019
And plus, the Regatta overlaps
with fall break,

352
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:38,362
and frankly, that pisses
a lot of girls off.

353
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:39,856
- So I don't want...
- I don't care.

354
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,991
I don't care, I can...
I can do that. I can to that.

355
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,726
I... I'd love to do that.

356
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:45,561
Awesome sauce.

357
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:47,997
Good. Get outta here. Scooch.

358
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:52,168
The only novice
to get moved up to varsity.

359
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:54,904
Yeah.

360
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,707
Well, double.

361
00:22:58,007 --> 00:22:59,342
They practice at 5 a.m.

362
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,144
5 a.m.?

363
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:03,880
I thought practices were in
the afternoons.

364
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:06,481
Varsities do, uh, two days.

365
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,230
- Okay.
- When are you supposed to, like, sleep?

366
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:11,888
Yep. Okay. I love you.

367
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:13,689
Bye.

368
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,239
Hey. What's up?

369
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:32,808
<i>Yo, um... I'm gonna
go to bed soon,</i>

370
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,242
<i>but do you want to
carpool tomorrow?</i>

371
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:37,847
Um... I... I actually am
gonna be practicing

372
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,082
with the varsity tomorrow.

373
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,450
<i>Duh! That's what I mean. Me too.</i>

374
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,395
<i>Coach Pete told me you're
the other novice moving up.</i>

375
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,389
<i>You wanna, uh, meet outside
Turner Hall at 4:30?</i>

376
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,592
Yeah. Okay. Cool.

377
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,626
<i>Cool.</i>

378
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:23,626
Maybe we got the time wrong?

379
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:25,594
The email definitely said 5 a.m.

380
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:30,672
What if they're fucking with us?

381
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,637
God, this better not be
some hazing shit.

382
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:36,672
You and me have to
stick together.

383
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:39,875
Um... why would they be
fucking with us?

384
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:42,979
Uh, because varsity
does not want fresh meat

385
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:44,146
nipping at their heels.

386
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,208
And all the other novices,
they're just like,

387
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,151
"Oh, yeah, a fun intramural.

388
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:50,720
Ooh, ducks. Ooh, friends."

389
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:54,123
We actually need this shit.

390
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:57,069
God, when Coach Pete
reached out to me

391
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:59,013
and basically said I was gonna
get a scholarship,

392
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:01,897
I mean, I'm not religious
but, like, fuck.

393
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,401
Also, Rachel's such
a little bitch,

394
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:07,554
she didn't give a shit when
they offered her the spot.

395
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:10,706
She just booked a flight
for fall break.

396
00:25:11,941 --> 00:25:13,181
It's probably first class, too.

397
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:15,745
Silver spoon bitch.

398
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:18,206
Honestly, your lucky break,
though.

399
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:20,082
They offered the spot to Rachel?

400
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:21,851
Yes.

401
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:27,490
But, honestly, it's her loss.

402
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:30,259
And you try way harder
than her, so...

403
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,120
Sure as shit need it
more than her, too.

404
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:40,512
These novices are gonna
drop like flies.

405
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:41,904
I know it. I just...

406
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:43,507
know it.

407
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,008
Try-hard? Gone.

408
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:48,611
Rachel? Gonna be gone.

409
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,202
Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,304
Yeah?

411
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:20,142
It's so much better doing it
with another person.

412
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:21,977
You know? Way more fun.

413
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,047
We got this. You know?

414
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:28,584
Oh!

415
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,065
Let's go.

416
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:52,741
You're late, novice.

417
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:53,943
Yeah, sorry, we were just...

418
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:55,579
Freshman four, over here.

419
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:01,050
All right, we're doing
novice sandwiches this week.

420
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,219
Moore, four. Dall, you're three.

421
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:04,564
You've rode starboard before,
right?

422
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:06,355
Yeah, I've rode starboard
before, and port,

423
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:08,424
so I can do both.
Whichever one you want.

424
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:10,626
So, Dall three.

425
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,028
Mitchell, two. Brill,
you got bow, okay?

426
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:15,140
All right, hurry the fuck up
and grab the boat.

427
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,699
I'm stuck with you dumbasses
this week.

428
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:19,001
Don't piss me off.

429
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,302
Anyone see lightning?

430
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:22,747
No? Well, friggin' tell me
if you do.

431
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,691
I'm not getting electrocuted
for a freshman boat.

432
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:30,279
Stern pair, pick drill. Ready?

433
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,148
Row.

434
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:34,584
Whoa, wait up.

435
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,085
All right, novice, pick drill.

436
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:37,820
First arms,
then arms and bodies,

437
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,421
then quarter side,
half side, full side.

438
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:41,790
Got it? Okay. Ready? Row.

439
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,228
All four, watch your hands!

440
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:48,964
- Jesus Christ.
- In full.

441
00:27:49,198 --> 00:27:51,700
And two. One.

442
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:54,036
Two.

443
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,442
Jesus, novice, you're
turning the whole boat.

444
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:01,844
Light strokes.

445
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,079
Lightly.

446
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:06,849
You know what?
Fuck it, fuck it, wait up.

447
00:28:06,882 --> 00:28:08,350
Check it down.

448
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:10,352
Lightly.

449
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:11,921
All right, enough of that.

450
00:28:12,154 --> 00:28:13,956
Bow pair.

451
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,257
Get ready.

452
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,859
Row!

453
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,998
Get that up.

454
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:24,934
That is what I'm talking about.

455
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,269
That's what it looks like.
See, she's a natural.

456
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:28,672
The other one isn't.

457
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:30,906
Three seat, set the boat.

458
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:56,041
Novice in the back,
behind the freshmen.

459
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,866
Let's go.

460
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,139
And then back, all the way.

461
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:13,916
All right, no more
shits on the bus, people.

462
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:16,029
Thelma, I'm talking to you.
I don't want to smell it.

463
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:17,886
No. Novice in the back.

464
00:29:18,053 --> 00:29:19,288
Fuck you, we're a team.

465
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:21,490
Am I right, guys? Come on.

466
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:23,118
Come on! Let's go!

467
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,301
- Water?
- No, no, hold on.

468
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,404
How'd it go today?

469
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:44,139
Heard you caught a crab, huh?

470
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,041
It happens.

471
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:48,844
How was it, though?
Today? Your first race?

472
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:50,913
Well, considering it was
my fault we lost, I...

473
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:53,115
It's not the fault of the person
who caught the crab.

474
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:55,585
It means the technique on
the entire boat is off.

475
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:58,354
Not one person wins
or loses a race.

476
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:01,056
I think I just got tired
and my oar slipped so...

477
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:03,992
I couldn't frickin' feel my legs
and, uh,

478
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:05,595
just need to get stronger.

479
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:08,565
Can you give yourself
a break, please?

480
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,100
When you focus on
your technique for a bit,

481
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,868
it'll come.
And remember what I said.

482
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:15,538
It's 10,000 hours
to be an expert.

483
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:18,107
You literally just started.

484
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:20,075
Relax.

485
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:24,079
Will you?

486
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,224
I'm just gonna go to
the bathroom.

487
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:27,851
Right.

488
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,522
Jesus Christ, move.
Little people freeze faster.

489
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:06,723
All right, bitch.

490
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:21,937
Welcome, novice.

491
00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:23,939
Your first practice
with varsity.

492
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:26,241
Well, for most of you.

493
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:30,078
Varsity, the novice
will be practicing...

494
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:32,214
- Hey, listen up.
- Sorry.

495
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:33,516
Please. Thank you.

496
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:36,123
The novice will be practicing
with us until the new year.

497
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:37,986
I want you to set an example
for them.

498
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:40,189
All right.

499
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:43,593
I want you to set
an example for them.

500
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,228
Show them how hard you work.

501
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:48,430
Show them what it's like to
fight for a 2K PR,

502
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:51,099
and keep in mind, some of them
might be moving up one day.

503
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:53,368
They'll be part of your team,

504
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:55,204
and your competition.

505
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:58,245
It's a good motivation
going into the new year.

506
00:32:58,407 --> 00:32:59,441
For everyone.

507
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:03,913
All right.

508
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,915
Put your stuff away,
grab an ERG and warm up.

509
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:07,449
Brill, do we got an issue today?

510
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:08,918
- No.
- Good.

511
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,155
- Whoo!
- Ready?

512
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,824
Oh, my God, I was born ready.

513
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,459
Long time, bro.

514
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:18,628
Yeah.

515
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:20,830
You ready?

516
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:22,364
Yeah, I think so.

517
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:26,401
That's my ERG.

518
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:27,904
Novice in the back.

519
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:36,144
Novice, in the back.

520
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:38,648
Sorry, I... I didn't know.

521
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,709
Just take some time, all right?

522
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:40,977
- Pete!
- All right.

523
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:52,287
Fuck.

524
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:11,808
We're going to the trainer,
novice.

525
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:17,279
Earth to Dall.

526
00:35:18,113 --> 00:35:20,617
You don't have to kill yourself
in the last 2K of the semester.

527
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:22,928
Coaches know everyone sucks
this time of year.

528
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:24,419
Still wasn't enough.

529
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,623
You're never gonna get

530
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:28,457
a seven minute 2K
if that's what you think.

531
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,125
You're just not built for it.

532
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,295
Besides, you fuckin' PR'ed
at 7:45.

533
00:35:33,495 --> 00:35:34,530
The best novice time.

534
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:36,799
7:45.5.

535
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,602
And there are only
five novice left.

536
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,642
Well, assuming we do seat races,

537
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:43,539
you'll probably end up in
the 2V, anyway.

538
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:44,607
A what?

539
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:46,709
Fugh!

540
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:50,889
Technique doesn't matter
on the ERG,

541
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:52,048
but it matters in the water.

542
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:53,716
Hence, a seat race to tell

543
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,652
who's actually making the boat
move faster.

544
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,987
Okay, so?

545
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:02,992
Okay, so two people race against
one another in fours,

546
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,761
do one piece,

547
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:06,005
then the people seat racing
swap,

548
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:07,589
but the rest of the crew stays
the same,

549
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:09,899
go again, run the numbers,
blah and blah.

550
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:11,309
So you're saying
I need to seat race.

551
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,402
Weirdo, chill. It's drama...

552
00:36:13,435 --> 00:36:15,138
Ew! Don't get piss on me.

553
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:18,041
Seriously,
it's drama fucking city.

554
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,085
This girl in my high school got
kicked off the team

555
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:21,343
for trying to throw one.

556
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,012
So, should I ask Edwards?

557
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,515
I could ask for, like, next week.

558
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,918
No, you don't demand shit
from Edwards.

559
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,930
Besides, I heard she does them
every spring break

560
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:33,188
to finalize lineups.

561
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:35,390
- So that's my shot.
- No.

562
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,993
2K ERG tests matter.

563
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:39,361
The seat race, the dumb-ass
around-the-lake rows.

564
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:42,098
Edwards takes these tests
really seriously.

565
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,285
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

566
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:47,170
But, like, relax.

567
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,921
<i>Seat racers swap, rest of
the crew stays the same...</i>

568
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:13,896
<i>Seat racers swap, rest of
the crew stays the same</i>

569
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,530
<i>go again, run the numbers,
blah and blah.</i>

570
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,219
You went through it three times.

571
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:12,188
You've been here
two hours and 44 minutes.

572
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:13,523
I'm going home.

573
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,691
I still have six minutes.

574
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:17,627
Hey!

575
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,327
You gotta know when to quit.

576
00:38:34,476 --> 00:38:35,978
Fuck!

577
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:30,967
- Dall?
- Hey, coach, hi.

578
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,668
- I was just...
- You were...

579
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:35,370
Shouldn't you be stuffed in
a library somewhere

580
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:37,006
- studying right now?
- Yeah.

581
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,318
And there's a reason we don't
have practices during exams.

582
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:41,110
NCAA reasons, but, uh,
I don't know,

583
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:42,386
we care about you, too,
at least I do.

584
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,214
- Yeah.
- You're a student athlete, Dall.

585
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,351
Student comes first, so
would you repeat after me.

586
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:52,288
Student athlete.
I'm a student athlete.

587
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:57,560
I just did a 2K and a PR.
Awesome sauce.

588
00:39:57,593 --> 00:39:59,629
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm trying to get better.

589
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:01,197
Before you do that,
why don't you...

590
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:02,999
Don't leave me hangin'.

591
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:04,967
Weight adjusted,
I guess it's, uh...

592
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:06,969
- it's okay.
- Weight adjusted?

593
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:08,170
What? Where'd you learn that?

594
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:09,872
Well, I figured...

595
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:11,483
the force generated by
a more powerful rower

596
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:13,142
might be offset by their weight

597
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:16,178
if their boat gets pushed into
the water more by their weight.

598
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:17,990
'Cause the more surface area of
the boat in the water,

599
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:19,854
the more friction causes
the boat to slow down.

600
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,018
If there was
a weight adjustment...

601
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,418
Weight adjustment calculators.

602
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:26,322
Look, don't focus on
the numbers, okay?

603
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:28,324
That is enough to
drive me crazy. I...

604
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,861
Um, yeah, well, I'm taking
a winter mini-mester,

605
00:40:31,894 --> 00:40:33,872
so at least that way I can
at least use the ERG room.

606
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:35,097
I want to get stronger.

607
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:37,667
Uh, I've got
a tip for you, Dall.

608
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,936
It's not all about strength.

609
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,672
And are you using the ERG room

610
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:44,082
'cause you're taking
a winter-mester,

611
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:46,342
or are you taking
a winter-mester

612
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,077
just so you can use
the ERG room?

613
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,755
I don't even want to know
if that's the answer.

614
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:52,581
I... I want to do 2Ks
every day this break.

615
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:55,985
I will chain the ERG room shut.

616
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:57,286
There's an ERG in the gym.

617
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,221
Oh, my God, you're...

618
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:00,656
a lot.

619
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:02,525
Okay. Um...

620
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,529
Maybe...

621
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:09,899
Maybe you can spend
some time on the single,

622
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:11,300
work on some technique.

623
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:13,312
I didn't know I was allowed
to row during break.

624
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:14,870
- I'll do it.
- Well, usually,

625
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:16,272
it's meant for
experienced girls,

626
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:17,707
and it's usually done
in the summer,

627
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,275
'cause the boat's easy to flip.

628
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:21,486
Okay, well, I'll be careful,
I'll stay close to the dock.

629
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,312
It's not me you gotta convince.

630
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:25,548
Coach Edwards.

631
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:27,116
She has to unlock
the boat house.

632
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:31,053
- Can't you do it?
- No.

633
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:33,589
I have in-law visitation duty,

634
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:35,424
which is my own thing,

635
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,726
but, anyway, no.

636
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:38,493
She's the boss lady.

637
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:40,896
And, uh, she lives walking
distance to the boat house

638
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,865
so, I don't know, why don't you
shoot her a text.

639
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,412
I'm sure she'll
let you right in.

640
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:47,336
Why am I not surprised to
see you here during break?

641
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:48,471
You're here.

642
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:51,007
What are you doing Saturday?

643
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:52,241
Why?

644
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:53,909
Playing a little
school of rock set

645
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,745
at the historic Red Dog.
You should stop by.

646
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:57,580
I thought you don't date
students.

647
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,348
Who said it was a date?

648
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:54,236
Yeah, Mom. Well, the plan is...

649
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,172
is to drive in on Christmas Eve,

650
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:58,441
and then I'm gonna go back
on, uh, Christmas Day.

651
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:02,578
Okay, well, the day after.

652
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:13,055
Well...

653
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,658
No, I'm good.

654
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:16,959
Yeah.

655
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,296
Well, why have you been
talking to Winona?

656
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:23,466
No. I'm going to bed right now.

657
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:29,573
- ID.
- Hm.

658
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:33,909
Go.

659
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,961
- Hi.
- What can I get you?

660
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:53,629
Um, can I get
a vodka soda, please.

661
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,169
Well, aren't you
full of surprises.

662
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:02,938
Are you of age?

663
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:04,541
Uh, I'm in here, right?

664
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:05,808
I invited you

665
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,601
expecting you to get
turned away at the door.

666
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,044
Okay, then.

667
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:13,649
Hey. Hey.

668
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:15,985
I was just kidding.
Just kidding.

669
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:17,486
Well, kinda.

670
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:19,455
- Five minutes.
- Okay.

671
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:20,890
- I'll see you after?
- Okay.

672
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,791
Thank you.

673
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:27,663
All right, guys,
so this next song

674
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:29,098
is actually a new song we wrote.

675
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:30,332
I hope you guys like it.

676
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,902
And afterwards, we have
the Paper Shakers,

677
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:34,103
so stick around.

708
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:24,433
Thanks so much for,
um, meeting me so early.

709
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,934
I've been up since five.

710
00:48:26,435 --> 00:48:28,705
I just wanted to get
some extra practice in

711
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:30,707
since other girls are
so much bigger than I am.

712
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,975
No. Those.

713
00:48:35,944 --> 00:48:37,881
Okay.

714
00:48:39,281 --> 00:48:41,083
Look, have you even rowed
a single before?

715
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,128
'Cause if not, you're gonna wait
until we take 'em out as a team.

716
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:44,153
No, I have.

717
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:47,657
- I have.
- Good thing.

718
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,725
Water's cold.

719
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:50,335
Shoot me a text
when you're done.

720
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:51,639
Let me know
the boat's back safe.

721
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:52,961
Cool.

722
00:49:12,047 --> 00:49:13,048
Mm, 'kay

723
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:54,858
- You're late, Dall.
- Yeah.

724
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:57,660
You know, the girls
who row in summer

725
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:58,795
usually come later.

726
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:00,964
Yeah, well,
I have class at 9:30.

727
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:03,900
So... Have you seen my umbrella?

728
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:05,668
- No.
- Okay.

729
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,971
- Come in if you see lightning.
- Okay!

730
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,685
Late again, Dall?

731
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,360
I'm here.

732
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:36,063
You know, you could just
give me the key.

733
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:38,267
You don't need a key.

734
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:39,669
Just slam the door.

735
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,919
Look who's on time and dry.

736
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,092
Shit.

737
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,433
Sorry, I just thought
it would be quicker

738
00:51:44,466 --> 00:51:45,935
if I came here.

739
00:52:05,287 --> 00:52:06,623
Opens the boat house.

740
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:08,256
You're lookin' good out there.

741
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:10,131
I didn't know you were watching.

742
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:12,528
That's the point.

743
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:15,263
Six a.m., Monday morning.

744
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:36,879
I mean, why's he interviewing

745
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,033
a whole bunch of deans at
a dinner table or something.

746
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:42,636
I can't get a word in edge...
I don't know what I'm...

747
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,020
- Hey.
- Hi.

748
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:45,121
How you doin'?

749
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:48,091
Um, Alex, this is Dani, my TA.

750
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:50,660
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

751
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:52,695
Yeah, you're both pursuing
physics, right?

752
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,397
I'm actually underage, so...

753
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:58,534
Oh. Underage.

754
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,837
Did you, uh, TA

755
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,404
for my class last semester?

756
00:54:02,437 --> 00:54:04,907
Oh, the class was so big.
And it's been so long.

757
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,417
Well, the two of you
should get acquainted.

758
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,745
Alex is, uh, one of our
presidential scholars.

759
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,881
And Dani here just actually got
into her top choice school.

760
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,984
You did? Congratulations.

761
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:16,753
Thank you.

762
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:19,756
That's a sweet cardigan.

763
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:22,257
Is this the line for
the bathroom?

764
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:23,492
Right.

765
00:54:26,294 --> 00:54:27,429
It's warm in here.

766
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,868
What, do you like me now that
you know I'm leaving?

767
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:35,571
I'm just waiting for
the bathroom.

768
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,439
You don't date
your students, so...

769
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,941
there's also that.

770
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,284
You're not my student anymore.

771
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:02,031
Oh, you said you were
good at this.

772
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:03,800
So freshman year of high school

773
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,235
my mother said that I should
enroll in some honors classes

774
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,970
so that way I could
challenge myself,

775
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,772
which was a huge mistake.

776
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,406
Yeah, sure, Miss 4.0.

777
00:55:11,439 --> 00:55:13,408
You've seen what I have to do
to get an A.

778
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:15,077
- Valid.
- Great. Okay.

779
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,546
So I was about to transfer out,

780
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,550
but there was this smart ass
douchy future frat bro

781
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,752
who was always talking about me.

782
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:24,187
He would always finish first,

783
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,222
and then humble brag about
how he never studied.

784
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:27,824
So obviously,
when he asked me out,

785
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,091
- I turned him down.
- Oh, no.

786
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,827
This one class,
we got our grades back,

787
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,394
and he saw mine, which was a C,

788
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:34,997
and he goes, "If you took
the regular class",

789
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,899
then you would probably
get an A."

790
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,466
Oh, no he didn't.

791
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,937
I decided, fuck him. I was gonna
beat him on the next test.

792
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,138
I was gonna turn it in first

793
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:43,482
and I was gonna get
the better grade,

794
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,242
- so I studied my ass off and...
- And beat him.

795
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:48,476
Well, I got a C but
I did turn it in first.

796
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,179
And it hit me, like,

797
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:52,347
if I was rushing and making
all these mistakes,

798
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,159
then surely he must too,
because there's no way,

799
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,426
no matter how smart
this guy was,

800
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,484
he didn't miss one.

801
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,788
So the next time,
I took my time.

802
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:01,423
- And you beat him.
- Uh, no.

803
00:56:01,456 --> 00:56:04,193
Well, I got... I got
my first B in that class.

804
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,761
Okay? But the next time,

805
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,931
I double checked my work,
I re-did the test,

806
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,365
- and then...
- You beat him.

807
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:11,466
I tied him.

808
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,836
The time after that...

809
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,539
- You beat him.
- Yes, I beat him!

810
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,007
- It's your turn.
- I know.

811
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,308
Now, everyone knew that

812
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,844
this guy was gonna graduate
valedictorian,

813
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:25,348
but he only took the minimum
classes needed to graduate.

814
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,352
Well, I took a full load of
honors classes to weight my GPS.

815
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:30,720
He didn't study, but I did.

816
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:32,688
He was smarter,
but I worked harder.

817
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:34,833
- And you became valedictorian?
- Still no.

818
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:36,959
Some girl transferred in
junior year, beat us both.

819
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:40,563
But I did graduate salutatorian
and he was third.

820
00:56:40,596 --> 00:56:42,365
Bumped off the podium entirely.

821
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,834
So that's how it all began.

822
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:47,503
Somebody pissed you off
and you got revenge.

823
00:56:47,536 --> 00:56:49,639
You don't know how many people
gave me high fives

824
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,874
during graduation, okay?
This guy irritated everyone.

825
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,189
So it was about the high fives
and standing at the podium?

826
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:58,881
No? Come on, give me something.

827
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,583
Well, why did we go to the moon?

828
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,152
Oh, God.

829
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:04,353
No, no, really, tell me.

830
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,188
Why did we go to
some lifeless rock?

831
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,423
Come on. Don't break my heart.

832
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:10,492
Wasn't it just some huge
propaganda factory

833
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:11,661
and ego trips,

834
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,229
that way, we could prove
as Americans

835
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:15,231
that we were superior to
the Russians?

836
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:17,333
- Ooh.
- Who even cares that we got there first?

837
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:18,868
We had bigger shit
to worry about.

838
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:22,171
We had people starving,
civil rights, wars.

839
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,006
Okay? All we got out of it was

840
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,242
a bunch of dead astronauts
and huge deficit.

841
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:27,610
It was totally pointless.

842
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,187
I can't believe you're
a physics major,

843
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:31,347
and you're shit talking
space travel.

844
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,283
- Mm-hm.
- The advancements of technology because of that.

845
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:36,552
- Okay.
- The sense of national pride.

846
00:57:36,585 --> 00:57:37,720
Mm-hm.

847
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:39,454
Not that I give a shit
about that.

848
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:41,390
- Oh, no.
- To test our limits as a species,

849
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,292
to see if we could.

850
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,127
What was it Kennedy said?

851
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,930
We do it not because it's easy,

852
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,932
- but because it's hard.
- Yes!

853
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:55,071
Wow. Just wow.

854
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,039
- No, it's my turn.
- No way.

855
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:58,641
- Let me show you how to...
- No.

856
00:57:58,674 --> 00:57:59,809
All right, ladies,

857
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:01,310
welcome back after
your winter break.

858
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,088
And I don't care if you've been
sitting on your asses

859
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,414
for the last two weeks,
you are about to get moving.

860
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:06,882
Welcome to hell.

861
00:58:07,783 --> 00:58:10,052
All right, Janssen...

862
00:58:15,524 --> 00:58:16,625
You okay?

863
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,661
Yeah, just, uh...

864
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,495
just this little thing,
no big deal.

865
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:28,671
Hm?

866
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,575
I said, nice to see
a novice move up.

867
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:38,447
Hey, Groundsman, Dall,

868
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,815
what are we waiting for?

869
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,584
It's practice. Let's go.

870
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:46,088
Nice work, Groundsman and Dall.

871
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:49,658
Everyone, this is
the work ethic I'm after.

872
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,460
Okay? The schools we're
going up against

873
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,163
are bigger,
they've got more money,

874
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:55,297
more rowers,

875
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,600
but we can work harder.

876
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,374
When you're doing it right,

877
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:07,943
the oar will make a V
from the back splash.

878
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,678
Push before you pull.

879
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,882
Guys, more of that.
That's it! Alex.

880
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:34,703
Okay, bring it up.

881
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,959
Time!

882
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,874
That's it, ladies!

883
01:00:11,907 --> 01:00:13,342
Move! Move!

884
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,649
What do I do with this?

885
01:01:38,727 --> 01:01:40,930
All right.

886
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:55,277
Let's go!

887
01:01:57,179 --> 01:01:58,447
Push it here!

888
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,786
Yes!

889
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,556
Paddle! Paddle!

890
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:11,561
We won this one.

891
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:13,697
Weigh enough, girls.

892
01:02:17,866 --> 01:02:20,269
Their silver spoon asses
got soft, I guess.

893
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:27,876
Coach is gonna have to
seat our asses.

894
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,983
Shut the fuck up!

895
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:38,187
Who the fuck are you talking to?

896
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:43,192
We just lost to 2V boat.

897
01:02:43,225 --> 01:02:44,860
Do you realize
how embarrassing that is?

898
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:46,362
Do you realize that?

899
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:08,793
You know, my roommate's
probably waking up hungover

900
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:10,052
at her all-inclusive right now,

901
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:11,463
and we've already
worked out six hours.

902
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,255
Anyone can party
on spring break.

903
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,592
Not us, apparently.

904
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:18,403
Also, it's been four days
and there have been

905
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,928
no mention of seat races at all.

906
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,263
That's fuckin' bullshit.

907
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,132
Erin said that they'd be
later this week.

908
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:26,935
No. Coach can't accept that

909
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,605
our reject boat
beat her recruited stars.

910
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:30,382
Also, Janssen said
the only reason we won

911
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,046
was because the cox
charted a shit course.

912
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,829
That's why we need a seat race.
That way, we know for sure.

913
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:37,514
Mm.

914
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,419
Shut up, Janssen.

915
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,187
Still here.

916
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,990
Nice work today, stern pair.

917
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,729
We were actually hoping
that we'd get to seat race.

918
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:57,567
Crews are always changing,

919
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,201
so just, uh,
keep up the good work.

920
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:01,504
Get some sleep, eat well,

921
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,038
and we'll see you
dark and early.

922
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,174
We beat the 1V in the scrimmage.

923
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:11,146
Yes. The 1V had a few
technical difficulties.

924
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,249
But, uh, you two, you rode
a really good race.

925
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,662
And if there are technical
difficulties on race day,

926
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,721
then what, we lose?

927
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,330
Why don't you keep your head
in your boat where it belongs,

928
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,834
and, uh, we'll worry about
the rest, all right?

929
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,334
Good?

930
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:46,915
Fuck.

931
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,225
It's bullshit.

932
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:58,227
She fucking scouted me.

933
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,729
She promised me
that scholarship.

934
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:02,599
- We'll get our chance.
- No, I fucking need this, man.

935
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,200
Like, I really need this
right now.

936
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,412
Don't know what the fuck
I was thinking coming here.

937
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:08,571
I'm a fucking idiot.

938
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:11,584
If I don't get this, I have to
transfer to a state school.

939
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:13,175
I can't fucking live
with my dad.

940
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,644
I fucking can't.

941
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:17,317
I should have tried out for
basketball or something.

942
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:18,815
And now there's no fucking time,

943
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,482
and I thought this was
a guarantee.

944
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,918
And now some entitled bitches
and fucking seniority bullshit

945
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:24,219
are ruining my shot.

946
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:26,790
Our fucking shot.

947
01:05:30,392 --> 01:05:32,072
I'm gonna say something to
Highsmith later.

948
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,163
Do you think that's a good idea?

949
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,241
Why the fuck do I care?
What have I got to lose?

950
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,299
Absolutely nothing.

951
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,002
She fucking graduates
in a couple months.

952
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:41,838
She doesn't need the 1V, we do.

953
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,078
This one is my favorite.

954
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,515
- Can we post it?
- Yeah, if you want.

955
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:54,288
Which one's your favorite?

956
01:05:54,983 --> 01:05:56,820
Um, I like this one.

957
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,589
Larry looks great.

958
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:11,935
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

959
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:57,847
All right, everyone,
we have some news.

960
01:06:59,114 --> 01:07:00,282
Groundman is out.

961
01:07:00,315 --> 01:07:01,416
Whoa, what?

962
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:02,819
That pain in her shoulder?

963
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,486
Turns out,
her collarbone's broken.

964
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,088
It's been hurting her for weeks.

965
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:07,700
This thing has been broken
this whole time?

966
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:09,291
Yeah, it's fucking insane.

967
01:07:09,324 --> 01:07:11,193
So, listen to your bodies,
people.

968
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:12,929
Where's Edwards at?

969
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,143
All right, those of you
who are not on the board,

970
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,537
y'all are doing 60 minute run.

971
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,838
The rest of you are in fours.

972
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,790
Hands on.

973
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,106
Hey.

974
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:46,876
How are you?

975
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,931
They were supposed to row
the same in both races.

976
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,380
There's no way to know if...

977
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,414
They rowed hard for Brill,
they rowed light for me.

978
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,419
They wanted me to lose.

979
01:11:02,357 --> 01:11:04,359
- Fuck this.
- Dall, come here.

980
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:05,704
- I heard them all talking.
- Dall...

981
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,688
- They were all in on it.
- Get over here, novice.

982
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:14,804
Be careful.

983
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,439
You have years of rowing left.

984
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,307
That's years of
a lot of these girls.

985
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,512
You'll make the 1V a year,
maybe two.

986
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:24,479
- This isn't fair.
- No, it's not.

987
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,281
But life isn't fair.

988
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,450
That's so easy for you to say.

989
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:30,586
Is it? Where's my seat race?

990
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,132
I was in the boat
that won the scrimmage.

991
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,456
I charted the best course.

992
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:36,398
You don't see me throwing a fit.

993
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,213
You have to decide if this is
the hill you want to die on.

994
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:47,970
Trust me.

995
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,338
It's not.

996
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,850
Hey, I know you're late but
your name's on the list.

997
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,252
- Okay, I...
- See you at the Parkhurst.

998
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:35,111
All right, all right.
Be there in an hour.

999
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:38,080
<i>So sorry.</i>

1000
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:42,218
<i>Please accept my apology.</i>

1001
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:47,056
<i>But love is blind,</i>

1002
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:51,294
<i>and I was too blind to see.</i>

1003
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,330
Shit.

1004
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:53,956
You good dude?

1005
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,870
Dall, that's my ERG.

1006
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:10,206
Dall!

1007
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,412
You're kidding me, right?

1008
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,355
You couldn't let Highsmith
row next to me?

1009
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,826
- We're gonna be a pair.
- I know.

1010
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,529
Congrats, man. Great.

1011
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,962
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1012
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:08,297
Why'd you do it?

1013
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,067
Do what?

1014
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:16,064
Wait, you're pissed about
the seat race?

1015
01:16:16,506 --> 01:16:18,707
Yeah, you could have beat me
fair and square. So...

1016
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,545
Yeah, I'm sorry you lost,

1017
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,312
but at least you could be
cool about it.

1018
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,581
Yeah, you should have beat me
fair and square.

1019
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,560
I don't even know what the fuck
you're talking about.

1020
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,985
Can you fucking stop?

1021
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:31,763
You know, the difference between
you and me is that

1022
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,589
I actually put in
the extra work.

1023
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,691
You have all this talk about
silver spoon bitches,

1024
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,960
and look who's Audi
you're riding in right now.

1025
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,595
You know what? Fuck you!

1026
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,498
- I do what I have to.
- Oh, my God.

1027
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:44,212
Something you wouldn't
actually understand.

1028
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,336
This whole time,
I thought you needed this.

1029
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,440
I really did. But you're just
another silver spoon bitch.

1030
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,411
This is you. Yeah?

1031
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,416
Alex Dall.

1032
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:04,019
Presidential scholar.

1033
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:06,981
I actually thought they were
fucking with me.

1034
01:17:08,491 --> 01:17:10,793
Trying to put a wedge
between us, but...

1035
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,027
there it is.

1036
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:15,998
Oh, and I checked.
Presidential scholars,

1037
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,501
they get a full ride.

1038
01:17:20,604 --> 01:17:21,880
I never said I needed
a scholarship.

1039
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,272
Sure as shit let me think it.

1040
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,901
You know, this whole team thinks
you're fucking insane.

1041
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:29,979
I was your friend.

1042
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,482
I had your back from day one.

1043
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:36,979
And you were
supposed to have mine.

1044
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,824
You were my friend until
I actually became a threat.

1045
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,401
- The second I'm your competition...
- Fuck you!

1046
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:44,827
You turned on me!

1047
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,566
You don't fucking need this.
You don't need it.

1048
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:52,101
So what difference does it make
if you're in the 1V or the 2V?

1049
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,703
We can't be psychotic like you.
Some of us have lives.

1050
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:57,173
Yeah, your mistake is that

1051
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,041
you always stick to
what you're good at.

1052
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,411
You could have
fucking earned it.

1053
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,119
You know, the funny thing...

1054
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:11,987
about teams...

1055
01:18:12,556 --> 01:18:13,732
which you actually
wouldn't understand

1056
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:15,316
seeing as you've
never been on a team...

1057
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,366
is that you don't have to
like each other.

1058
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,276
But you do have to
respect each other.

1059
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,335
And no one respects you, Dall.

1060
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,706
I won that seat race.

1061
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:36,533
You've got to start
taking care of yourself.

1062
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,569
You'll ruin the scholarship
you do have.

1063
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:40,637
For what?

1064
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:43,172
My grades are good.

1065
01:20:43,807 --> 01:20:45,074
- Are they?
- Mm-hm.

1066
01:20:45,642 --> 01:20:47,042
I spoke to your new TA.

1067
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:49,813
You... What's your problem?

1068
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:52,716
My problem? I don't know.
What's yours?

1069
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,951
You're majoring in your
worst subject, Alex.

1070
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:58,320
- Mm-hm.
- Okay, you like a challenge.

1071
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,055
Taking tests four times

1072
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:02,826
Overkill, right? But for you,
it works. I get it.

1073
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:05,294
Now you're trying to apply

1074
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,196
the same obsessive logic
to rowing.

1075
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:08,732
It just doesn't work.

1076
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:10,834
You've got to let it go.

1077
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:16,238
Look.

1078
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:18,340
I'm not wrong here.

1079
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,052
Beating yourself to a pulp
trying to get your team to say,

1080
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,712
"Good job, you earned this."

1081
01:21:22,746 --> 01:21:24,514
Just like in high school,

1082
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,215
all for high fives and a podium.

1083
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,883
- No.
- You gotta relax.

1084
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,351
Oh, my God.

1085
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:33,857
You know, I am so sick and tired

1086
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:36,925
of everyone in my life
telling me to relax.

1087
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:38,193
Okay?

1088
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:41,598
Relaxing should be a privilege,
not a fucking standard.

1089
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,642
If everyone sat on their asses
and did nothing

1090
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:46,201
all this, this would
cease to exist.

1091
01:21:46,603 --> 01:21:49,138
If you didn't practice with
your fucking band...

1092
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:50,649
I mean, maybe if you
practiced more,

1093
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:52,374
you would be more than
just an opener.

1094
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:54,419
You think you know things
about me?

1095
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,145
I haven't told you shit
about me.

1096
01:21:56,613 --> 01:21:58,147
You don't know anything
about me.

1097
01:21:58,715 --> 01:22:01,049
I didn't go to graduation
and have high fives

1098
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,519
and a fucking podium, okay?

1099
01:22:02,552 --> 01:22:04,153
I didn't even go to graduation.

1100
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:07,624
Because I was 51/50'd
by all the people in my life,

1101
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:10,359
yourself included, who kept
telling me to fucking relax!

1102
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:11,628
I'm not gonna relax!

1103
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:14,096
You don't know how hard it is
for me to be the best.

1104
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,465
How hard I have to push myself
to be the best.

1105
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,071
Second best.

1106
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,245
Wow. Just... Okay.

1107
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:32,749
- You think I don't see you?
- Just stop.

1108
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:34,517
Just... Dani, stop.

1109
01:22:34,551 --> 01:22:36,920
Stop. No. Don't. Just stop it!

1110
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,388
You're self-immolating
on a loop.

1111
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,758
Just quit.

1112
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,526
Don't. It's just...
You don't under...

1113
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,360
I don't think you're ever
gonna feel good.

1114
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:47,429
You don't understand.
You don't understand!

1115
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:48,665
You'll never understand.

1116
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,301
I can't keep watching
you do this to yourself.

1117
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:53,670
Don't watch anymore.

1118
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:02,010
Don't. We always knew this had
an end date, right?

1119
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:45,588
All right.

1120
01:23:45,788 --> 01:23:49,091
Next week, we will have our
spring around-the-lake row.

1121
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,326
Okay, we'll knock it out
in four days,

1122
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,560
There will be a sign up sheet,
first come, first served.

1123
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:55,965
Now, this will help determine
championship line-ups,

1124
01:23:55,999 --> 01:23:57,834
but more importantly,
let's have fun.

1125
01:23:57,867 --> 01:23:59,002
Bullshit.

1126
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,369
Why do seniors have to do this?

1127
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,271
- It's our last week.
- Shut up, Janssen.

1128
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:04,144
You know I'm coming for
your record, Highsmith.

1129
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:05,274
Yeah, we'll see.

1130
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:06,375
So there's a record?

1131
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:10,013
Look, it's meant to be fun.
Okay?

1132
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,614
- What is it?
- So...

1133
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:13,917
What's the record?

1134
01:24:15,752 --> 01:24:18,487
I, uh... I... I don't know it
off the top of my head.

1135
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,722
Do you know it?

1136
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:21,558
Do you know what it is?

1137
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,469
It's your record, Highsmith.
Do you not know your own record?

1138
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:26,061
Does anyone know
Highsmith's record?

1139
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,405
You know, it's not actually
even important...

1140
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,731
Fourteen minutes flat.

1141
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,769
Right. Thank you, Erin.

1142
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:35,737
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1143
01:24:39,609 --> 01:24:40,977
Excuse me. Thanks.

1144
01:24:41,611 --> 01:24:43,378
- There's a line.
- Oh! Okay, sure.

1145
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,440
What the fuck, dude?
It's supposed to be fun.

1146
01:24:46,516 --> 01:24:48,116
I'm not rowing against you,
psycho.

1147
01:24:48,952 --> 01:24:50,085
It's your last week,

1148
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,362
and you already beat me
in the seat race

1149
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,946
so what do you guys
have to worry about?

1150
01:24:58,528 --> 01:24:59,662
Fucking stupid.

1151
01:25:00,964 --> 01:25:02,130
Piece of shit.

1152
01:25:15,078 --> 01:25:19,916
Janssen, Mitchell, and Dall.

1153
01:25:22,986 --> 01:25:24,353
It's gonna rain.

1154
01:25:24,654 --> 01:25:27,557
Say it with me, ladies.

1155
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:30,192
We row in the rain.

1156
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,695
Not in the lightning.

1157
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:34,097
Any signs of it, head in.

1158
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,099
Otherwise, I will see you
at the finish line.

1159
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,008
Ready?

1160
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:22,745
Row!

1161
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:29,351
This is bullshit!
I'm motherfucking freezing!

1162
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:30,853
Fuck!

1163
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:36,125
Watch your point!

1164
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,527
What the fuck!

1165
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,461
- There's lightning.
- There's no lightning.

1166
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:41,898
- Fucking lightning!
- Shut the fuck up!

1167
01:26:41,998 --> 01:26:44,332
- Fuck you!
- You're gonna hit my oar!

1168
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:45,501
Fuck off!

1169
01:26:48,971 --> 01:26:50,039
Fuck!

1170
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,607
You rocked my boat!

1171
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:53,275
Fuck you!

1172
01:27:08,758 --> 01:27:09,892
Lightning!

1173
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,427
Lightning!

1174
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,397
There's lightning!

1175
01:27:18,101 --> 01:27:19,434
Look!

1176
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:50,332
Yield!

1177
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,667
You fuckin' yield!

1178
01:27:52,869 --> 01:27:54,804
Yield! You're gonna
fucking hit me.

1179
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,438
Fuck!

1180
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:57,774
Ahh!

1181
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:08,450
Fuck!

1182
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,419
Fuck.

1183
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:34,877
It's lightning!

1184
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,680
Keep rowing through!

1185
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,217
Lightning, we have to go in!

1186
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,484
Keep rowing!

1187
01:28:43,786 --> 01:28:45,453
Alex, we're going in!

1188
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:51,961
Keep rowing!

1189
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,863
- Alex!
- Keep rowing!

1190
01:29:03,272 --> 01:29:04,540
Keep rowing!

1191
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:06,809
Keep rowing!

1192
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,151
Keep rowing.
