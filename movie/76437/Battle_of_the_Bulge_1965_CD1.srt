1
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,008
December, 1944.

2
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,272
British and American Armies
were on the threshold of victory.

3
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,915
Stretched across half of europe.

4
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,577
The allies cathered themselves for the
final assault of Germany.

5
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,777
To the north stood montcomery's

6
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,115
Eichth army.

7
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,849
To the south, patton's third.

8
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,322
In the center.

9
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,961
Along an 88-mile front.

10
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,324
A few battle-weary Amercan divisions

11
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,126
Rested in a quiet sector.

12
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:26,465
To them.
The war seemed already won.

13
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,335
This is their story.

14
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,509
Colonel, we've been flying

15
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,699
Over these woods all week.

16
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:32,741
There's nothing but trees.

17
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,776
Let's turn back.

18
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,448
Getting hungry, Joe?

19
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,581
The war is over.

20
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,978
I hear CHQ is shipping

21
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,153
Us home for Christmas.

22
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,514
Joe, the German Army still has

23
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,280
Six million men carrying arms.

24
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,484
They're not going home for Christmas.

25
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,426
Hey, there it is.

26
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,829
The German Amry.

27
00:03:56,035 --> 00:04:01,940
Let's go down and have a look.

28
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,437
Buzz him acain. Joe.

29
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,406
I'll get a picturre.

30
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,581
Ok.

31
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,269
This time gun your engine.

32
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,470
Make him look up.

33
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,158
It worked.

34
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:41,830
Swing around, Joe.
I want to get another one.

35
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,203
Conrad?

36
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,847
I am ashamed of you.

37
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,018
Get up.

38
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,584
They could have killed us, sir.

39
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,587
If you had taken the

40
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,350
pains to look carefully.

41
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,424
You would have observed.

42
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,756
It was an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

43
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:39,989
You would stay in the car

44
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,032
If fighter planes were shooting at us.

45
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,329
I did not lose a man to die in the back

46
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,800
Seat of a car.

47
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,439
Does the Colonel think anyone has a

48
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,007
Choice where to die?

49
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,700
I know where you'll die, conrad...

50
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,642
At home, in your own bed.

51
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,249
Is the Colonel trying to cet rid of me?

52
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,851
I think...

53
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,384
The world is coing to get

54
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,182
Rid of both of us.

55
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,790
Pick up your cap!

56
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,221
Put it on!

57
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,829
Try to look like a soldier!

58
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,192
What good is a soldier anyhow?

59
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,630
He wins, he loses.

60
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,236
What's he good for anyhow?

61
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,067
Conrad, I've told you before.

62
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,503
Never leave the motor running.

63
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,301
Petrol is blood.

64
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,910
I am sorry, sir.

65
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,072
It won't happen again.

66
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,423
Looks like something

67
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,757
On the cround at 10:00.

68
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,925
Let's take a look.

69
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,001
Nothing

70
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,114
Let's go home

71
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:08,102
Herr oberst Hessler is here.

72
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:16,644
Nach links, herr oberst.

73
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,953
Colonel Hessler, sir.

74
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,125
Ja.

75
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:58,088
Well, Hessler...
It has been a long time.

76
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,959
How good it is to see you acain.

77
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,101
You look the same.

78
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,931
A little... a
little leaner, perhaps, hmm?

79
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,835
The Russian front does not
put meat on a man's bones.

80
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,009
Cenral.

81
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,579
Ah, yes.
War is hard on all of us.

82
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,181
Central heating.

83
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,114
Crystal Chandeliers.

84
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,151
You have a nice cellar.

85
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,018
Field Hitler goering
gave me that painting.

86
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,184
Lovely, isn't it?

87
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:37,064
I imagine he found a
barcain in Paris last year.

88
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,464
My corporal is waiting
outside. He's had a hard drive.

89
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:44,405
Is there somewhere in
these runs. He can find a bed?

90
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,875
Sit down, Hessler.

91
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,172
You have too little faith.

92
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,148
In the genius of the german people.

93
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,185
A few stones have been knocked down.

94
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,357
But our country is strong...

95
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,422
United... Determined...

96
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,594
And more productive than ever.

97
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,263
The allies think that their
constant air raids.

98
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,024
Have undermined our morale.

99
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,394
This they shall never do.

100
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,060
Why send for me, General?

101
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,900
You are our finest panzer commander

102
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,837
Hessler.

103
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,875
You will lead us to victory.

104
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,639
Our Germany is now like an iceberg...

105
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,876
Only a fraction of it
can be seen on the surface.

106
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,647
Let me show you some of the results of

107
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,986
What Germany has produced underground.

108
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,458
You will discover a new Germany

109
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:41,531
And will take a new pride in being
a German.

110
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,827
Our latest airplane.

111
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,435
A jet.

112
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,539
It files at more than
900 kilometers per hour.

113
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,765
Within six months.

114
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,943
We will have enough jet fighters

115
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,944
To shoot down every
allied plane in the air.

116
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,172
Our V-1 rocket.

117
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,181
Destroyed 20% of london.

118
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:06,347
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

119
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,496
The new 70-ton king tiger tank.

120
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,791
It has 21/2 times the fire power

121
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,664
And double the armor
of the American tanks.

122
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:24,172
Our Germany is far from
finished, hmm, Hessler?

123
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:29,006
It's a very... beautiful model, General.

124
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,512
It proves that the Germans

125
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,879
Are still the world's best toymakers.

126
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,953
Ha. The toys we are making these days.

127
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,922
Are not for children.

128
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:46,087
Let me show them to you.

129
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,902
We will attack...

130
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,166
Throuch the losheim cap.

131
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,901
Which is deffended only by
a sincle battalion.

132
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,409
The American division on the schnee

133
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,081
Eifel will be cut off.

134
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,878
The our river bridge
will be in our hands.

135
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,487
From there on the Ambleve,
with the road network.

136
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,457
In four days, we will be
across the river Meuse.

137
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,926
The strategic objective?

138
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,395
Antwerp.

139
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,658
By taking Antwerp.

140
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,701
We split the enemy forces in two.

141
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,897
It will take them 18 months to recover.

142
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,201
By then, we will have air superiority

143
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,242
With our jet encines,

144
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,970
And we will have even more significant

145
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,048
Aeapons- Weapons which
can destroy

146
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,618
An entire city with a single blast.

147
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,756
You have forgotten one
important detail, General.

148
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,289
With their present control of the air.

149
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:25,020
The allies will smash our
tanks, machine Gun our troops

150
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,758
Bomb the bridges.
And cut our communications.

151
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,266
Suppose I tell you there will be no

152
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,439
Allied planes.

153
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,376
Another secret weapon?

154
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,636
From Spitsbergen, norway...

155
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,644
The northernmost weather
station in the world.

156
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,512
We have been waiting
two months for this report.

157
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,486
"A low pressure area over
northern europe "Starting december

158
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,184
"Low clouds and FOG, which
will ground all aircraft."

159
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,623
How long?

160
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,195
Long enough.

161
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:04,062
If we keep strictly to our timetable.

162
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,795
Unusual clock, isn't it?

163
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,974
It has only 1 cycle...

164
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,301
50 hours.

165
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,380
We have the resources for
50 hours full-scale attack.

166
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,542
Maps... Clocks... Toys

167
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,055
But with what will I fight?

168
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,953
Colonel Hessler,

169
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,649
I am putting you

170
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:33,321
In comand
our armored spearhead.

171
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,193
I got a Christmas cake from home today.

172
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,526
Think I'll be around to eat it?

173
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,225
Bring me the prints as soon

174
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,301
As they're developed.

175
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,062
Yes, sir.
Hello, Kiley.

176
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,707
Find any Germans under
your bed this morning?

177
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,342
Marching there all night.

178
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,775
Couldn't sleep a wink.

179
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,209
That's an order.

180
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,212
I want every item on that menu

181
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,443
Delivered to every soldier in
the Division,

182
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,020
Especialy those
in the forward positions.

183
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:36,217
Deliver them in time for
Christmas dinner.

184
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,588
Counterintellicence
picked this up

185
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,232
From an enemy acent,
dated November 29.

186
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,425
"From field marshal Kitel, most secret.

187
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,126
"Officers and men who speak English

188
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,670
"And wanted for special mission.

189
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,901
"Volunteers will report to
General Kohler's headquarters."

190
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,306
What do you make of it?

191
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,639
In my opinion, General,

192
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,442
This is one more confirmation

193
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,275
They're going to attack us.

194
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,975
Come on, Kiley. Not that acain.

195
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,484
They're probably preparing
a fifth column

196
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,850
To drop behind our lines.

197
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,390
Were you in the state
department, too. Kiley?

198
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,826
I thought your experience was
limited to police work.

199
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,556
Haveing have an inspector of police

200
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,292
Doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

201
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,528
All cops aren't flatfoots.

202
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,330
Your limited military experience

203
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,703
Doesn't exactly inspire
confidence in your conclusions.

204
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,075
If you think... Why do you say they're
mounting an offensive?

205
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,342
I spent 20 years before the
war asking questions.

206
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,487
Ever since D-day, you've had
me doing the same thing...

207
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,815
Interrocating prisoners.

208
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,254
I can only report what I've learned.

209
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,260
The Grman soldier facing us
is still undefeated.

210
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,226
He can still fight.

211
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,626
His leaders know that.

212
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,927
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

213
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,627
I have io other officers
in my section.

214
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,431
We see the same information,

215
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,007
Get the same facts as you.

216
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,302
All of us arrive at one answer,

217
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,378
And yours is a complete opposite.

218
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,173
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,

219
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,611
You'd better lie down.

220
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,911
You may be my superior officer...

221
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,714
He is.

222
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,912
Excuse me, sir.

223
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,682
Here are your prints, Colonel.

224
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,861
Thank you.

225
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,162
Look what showed up on this one.

226
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:27,327
I took it over the ardennes.

227
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,273
Is this a tiger tank, or isn't it?

228
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,240
So it appears.

229
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,605
Doesn't make a juncle.

230
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,973
Sir.

231
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,648
Tiger belong in jungles.

232
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,943
But when there's one in
a peaceful neighborhood.

233
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,451
I recommend we all look under our beds.

234
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,614
Excuse me, sir.

235
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,303
Step outside.

236
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:16,916
With your permission, sir.

237
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,057
This is from headquarters,
Kiley. Top secret.

238
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,749
The third army has been ordered

239
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,985
To attack the cermans in the saar.

240
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,427
General Patton is launghing
the offensive in two days.

241
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,694
Does it seem possible
headquarters would commit an entire army

242
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:32,836
To an offensive in the south

243
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,266
If there were any possibility

244
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:39,410
Of germans attacking in the ardennes?

245
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,509
With all due respect toheadquarters,

246
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,239
They could be wrong.

247
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,576
Send this to headquarters
anyway, pritchard.

248
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,548
There seem to be new
features on that tank.

249
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,618
Yes, sir. Anything else?

250
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:55,054
I'd like a rundown on
this german officer.

251
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,386
All right. Send this along.

252
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,325
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,432
Get up to the line. Tell them
to grab some new prisoners.

254
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,068
I want any fresh information I can get.

255
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,861
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,538
And one thing more...

257
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,434
Why are you in a reconnaissance plane?

258
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,371
You're not a combat soldier.

259
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,442
Trying to shorten the war.

260
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,613
All by yourself?

261
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:16,678
I just want to enjoy

262
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:22,843
That nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

263
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,190
I see the Colonel's in
fine appetite again.

264
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,527
I am.

265
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,204
Join me in a glass of wine.

266
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,600
Thank you, sir.

267
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,002
Sit down.

268
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,178
Thanks.

269
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,791
Conrad.

270
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,986
Speak.

271
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,720
What does the Colonel wish me to say?

272
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,025
Speak your mind... the truth.

273
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:09,893
Don't be afraid, Conrad.

274
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:15,563
I must have someone
to tell me the truth.

275
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:23,611
I've always been fortunate to
serve under brilliant men.

276
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,112
Who know everything.

277
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,115
From them I have learned one thing.

278
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,810
When all was lost,

279
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:34,618
These brilliant men never lost hope.

280
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,727
I admire that.

281
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,729
What else do you admire about these men?

282
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,764
The illusion.

283
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:48,963
Maybe... l'm not using the right word,
Colonel.

284
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,972
I'm... Not an educated man.

285
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,443
The hope that there's
always one more chance,

286
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,550
That is the illusion.

287
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,352
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

288
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:09,016
On, it's not my place to
speak of such things.

289
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,196
Go on.

290
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,191
I order you to.

291
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,961
Colonel.

292
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,935
This new command...

293
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,665
Is an illusion.

294
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,845
Give it up.

295
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,679
I am martin Hessler.

296
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,149
For years ago, my panzers
overran poland in one week.

297
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,312
That was no illusion.

298
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,117
In 39 days.
My tanks smashed all the way to Paris.

299
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,224
That way no illusion.

300
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:47,660
I conquered the crimea.
That was no illusion.

301
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,333
Today...

302
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,867
I was given a brigade of tiger tanks.

303
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,972
When I have a brigade of tanks.

304
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:00,133
That is reality.

305
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,108
And who will drive your tanks?

306
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,215
The men you led were soldiers
veteran soldiers.

307
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,248
Are there any left?

308
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,283
What will they give you now?

309
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,888
I was by your side in Poland,
france, the crimea.

310
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,990
Look at me. I'm no tthe same man.

311
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,056
I jumped in a ditch today

312
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,161
At the sight of an unarmed
reconnaissange plane.

313
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,888
My two boys remember me
as a good soldier.

314
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,760
They wouldn't believe it,

315
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,529
But, Colonel, I am not the only one.

316
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,602
How sure can you be

317
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:33,767
Of the men who will drive your tanks?

318
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,315
Major diepel.

319
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,480
Jawohl, oberst.

320
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,158
Diepel.

321
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,760
I want to see my tank commanders.

322
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,020
Have them assemble at once.

323
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,562
Jawohl, oberst.

324
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,494
Conrad.

325
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,669
My boots.

326
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,615
Achtung!

327
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:17,411
Your commanders, sir.

328
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,736
Boys. Too many boys.

329
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,033
The first battle will
turn them into men.

330
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,574
In the old days, I lived
six months with my men

331
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,836
Before going into action.

332
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:41,876
We knew each other.

333
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,570
These are strangers.

334
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,272
Too many boys.

335
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,350
They have never tasted defeat.

336
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,680
Do they know what is expected of them?

337
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,687
They are ready to die for you

338
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,851
Can you ask more?

339
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,106
Sing.

340
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,417
Louder.

341
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,068
Hold it! Hold it!

342
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,104
Hold it! Hold it!

343
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,605
Pull up.
We got brass on our tail...

344
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,799
Pull it forward, you idiot!

345
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,943
Heh heh heh.

346
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:34,839
Drop dead.

347
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:41,007
Pull it forward, you idiot!

348
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,683
Just a little bit. Hold it.

349
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,685
Hold it! Hold it!

350
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,790
You're dropping my merchandise!

351
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,119
Barrel, Eddie, come on out of there!

352
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,386
Come on, Cortland!

353
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,688
Oh ho ho ho.

354
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,297
Oh, wow.

355
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,626
Disaster.

356
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,893
Oh.

357
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,001
Solid.

358
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,637
Some driver, huh?

359
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,101
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

360
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,239
Complain to my union.

361
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,033
Yeah, tie it up.

362
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,767
Are we near enemy territory yet?

363
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,240
Too near. Give me a cigarette.

364
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,140
I don't smoke.

365
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,439
When will we see some germans?

366
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,343
Hey, Barrel.

367
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,312
Smoke your own.

368
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,348
You got a cigarette, Eddie?

369
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,712
You kidding?

370
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,046
You cheapskates.

371
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,951
Reach into my duffel
bag get me some cigarettes.

372
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,921
What's with you and the germans?

373
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,186
Nothing. I've just never seen one.

374
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,659
I've never even seen a german plane.

375
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,493
When are we going to get any action?

376
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,261
What are you, some kind of a nut?

377
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,837
What kind of replacements
they sending us, huh?

378
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,008
"I want to see action."

379
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:38,675
What's this?

380
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,902
Put that back.
That's merchandise.

381
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,205
Don't tell me there's women
where we're going.

382
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,109
Who are you giving these to?

383
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,409
Guffy don't give nothing.

384
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,449
He's peddling them.

385
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,813
Keep tying it up, huh?

386
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,750
Peddling them? To who?

387
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,888
The boys in the front.

388
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,353
They'll need that when they cet
to Germany.

389
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,857
There's lots of broads there.

390
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,256
Wow! French perfume!

391
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,125
Champagne

392
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,096
That's going to bring me bills a bottle
where we're going

393
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,760
Because there's nothing too
good for our boys.

394
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,496
Yeah. What's in here?

395
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,969
The mail.

396
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,701
Are you going to charce
them for that, too?

397
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,709
Huh?

398
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,405
No. They wouldn't sit still
for that, huh?

399
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,345
Just kidding. Sarge. Just kidding.

400
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,610
No. When you get these good thoughts,

401
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:22,844
You tell me anyway.

402
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:26,615
One thing I'm not going
back home again is poor!

403
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:32,787
Keep thinking, Kid. Very nice.

404
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,651
Germans?

405
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:03,961
This is the up-front front.

406
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,399
Wide-awake bunch of boys.

407
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,266
Don't you people post a sentry?

408
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,668
Sorry. I just came in for a second.

409
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:18,672
What's the matter with you?

410
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,242
Close the pneumonia hole!

411
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,935
Where where you born, in a barn?

412
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:27,140
Sorry, sir. We didn't know it was you.

413
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,182
Major Wolenski?

414
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,345
He's over there, sir.

415
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,255
Oh, hello, Colonel.

416
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,155
I wasn't expecting a visit
from the front office.

417
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,296
I would've had my men smarten up.

418
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,725
Some hot coffee for the Colonel.

419
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,492
Come over and get warm.

420
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,726
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

421
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,303
That radio's been yakking
between Christmas carols

422
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,667
We're all going home.

423
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,139
Here, sit down.

424
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,834
It's tough to try to keep discipline

425
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:55,944
When the only action around here

426
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,308
Is sitting on your butt,
trying to keep warm.

427
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,778
What are the Germans doing on the ridge?

428
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,817
Same thing, except they
don't have ny heat.

429
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,319
They exercise to keep from freezing.

430
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,788
I got a little exercise for your boys.

431
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:14,090
I want a patrol
tonight to pick up some prisoners.

432
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,258
Well, there they are.

433
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,508
Hey, Sarge, put those blankets back.

434
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,235
Come on. Shut the window.

435
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,676
Why are you doing that, Sarge?

436
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:31,576
You know they're out of range.

437
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,115
They'll only shoot
back with something heavier.

438
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,814
It's you or them, docface.
I need practice.

439
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,355
That's enough, Sergeant.

440
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,825
You want to play with that popgun,
go outside.

441
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,429
What if I take the men out

442
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,159
For a field drill, Lieutenant?

443
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,631
In the weather?

444
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,896
What for?

445
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,098
Because they're drilling, that's why.

446
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,676
I'll let you know when I want a drill,
Sergeant.

447
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:05,838
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

448
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,451
I'll take that Sergeant.

449
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,713
All right. That's all right.

450
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,586
But I'll pick the rest of
your volunteers.

451
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,626
Here you are, Colonel.

452
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,263
We got about three hours before dark.

453
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,399
How about some half-and-half?

454
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,559
Just sweeten it.

455
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,626
Bitte.

456
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,367
You are Colonel Hessler?

457
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,969
Who are you?

458
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,640
How did you get in here?

459
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:08,210
General Kohler's signature is magic.

460
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,176
You will excuse us. Major.

461
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,370
Before you give orders.

462
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,379
May I ask your rank?

463
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,984
Courtesan first class,

464
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,712
Compliments of General Kohler.

465
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:25,385
I think we have covered
everything, Colonel.

466
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,457
General Kohler did not tell me

467
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,692
You were so handsome.

468
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,270
What did General kohler
tell you about me?

469
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,442
Nothing.

470
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,907
Whatever I want to know...

471
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,514
I'll find out for myself.

472
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,675
I'm very good at that.

473
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,519
Aren't you going to offer me a drink,

474
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,388
Or have you been at the front so long,

475
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:04,501
You have forgotten your manners?

476
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,269
What shall we talk about?

477
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:16,436
Your wife, perhaps?

478
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,609
Won't you join me?

479
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,787
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

480
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,486
You are not paying much attention to me.

481
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:37,395
Very little has escaped my attention.

482
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,299
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

483
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,974
What he admires most about you

484
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:49,408
Is your reputation with the ladies.

485
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:57,077
I regret that is the opinion
of my commanding officer.

486
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,951
I have worked very hard

487
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,058
To achieve a reputation as a soldier.

488
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,024
Do not the two go together?

489
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,526
Give the general my compliments.

490
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,892
Tell him thank you,
I appreciate his gesture

491
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,864
And good night.

492
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:18,030
You can make your own way out.

493
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,359
Zero minus two hours.

494
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,588
All units ready to attack.

495
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,696
Repeat.

496
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,764
Zero minus two hours.

497
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:49,929
All units ready to attack.

498
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,577
Come with me.

499
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,941
Come on.

500
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:03,052
Put them down, dummkopf.

501
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,748
Hello, Kiley.

502
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,621
I was curious to see how you
interrogate your prisoners.

503
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:15,094
My other officers may be
asking the wrong questions.

504
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,564
I'm afraid you won't hear
any new answers.

505
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,600
Sometimes it's more important
what you see

506
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,764
Than what they say.

507
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,478
Could we get a little
more light in here?

508
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,646
How is that, sir?

509
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,766
Hmm.

510
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:54,702
So this is the face of the
undefeated enemy.

511
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:55,803
It looks you've captured

512
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,373
A sunday school class.

513
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,133
Is this all they have left.

514
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,367
For their front lines?

515
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,772
Where are their weapons?

516
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,948
Here, sir.

517
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,487
What's this?

518
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,817
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.

519
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,756
Did they put up any fight? No, sir.

520
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,055
Just gave up?

521
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:23,825
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.

522
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,900
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

523
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,092
They're not even tough enough

524
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,739
To be classified as delinquents.

525
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,929
Go ahead and question them.

526
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,633
Ask them if Germany's going
to win the war.

527
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,711
Go ahead, Kiley.

528
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:37,505
They could be plants

529
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,344
Put in the front lines to misleas us.

530
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,043
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

531
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,190
Have these prisoners escorted to the
rear for proper interrogation.

532
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,291
Yes, sir. Move them out.

533
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:53,486
Let's go! Move it out!

534
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,494
Sir, all these prisoners

535
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,132
Were carrying these rubber hoses.

536
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,427
Send them along
and anything else you've found on them.

537
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,537
Yes, sir.

538
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,602
Do you actually still think

539
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,005
That the Germans are
preparing a Major offensive?

540
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,510
Yes, sir, Colonel, I do.

541
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,114
You mean those kids you captured

542
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,216
Are just replacements for
more seasoned troofps

543
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,251
Who were sent to the bear to re-form
for the big attack?

544
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,754
Yes, sir, Colonel, I do.

545
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,016
Kiley, you're crazy.

546
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,193
Facts mean nothing to you.

547
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,452
Evidenge means nothing to you.

548
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,526
The only thing you can see

549
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,722
Are your own cock-eyed hunches.

550
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,094
Well, that doesn't work in the army.

551
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,496
I'm recommending you for transfer

552
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:39,165
To a desk in washington.
You can tell the president how to run

553
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,789
Major.

554
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,160
Speak English!

555
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,703
Ok, Lieutenant.

556
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:48,868
Let's get this stuff out of here.

557
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:03,417
Luftwaffe calling standard O.B.
Luftwaffe calling standard O.B.

558
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,994

behind enemy lines.

559
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:14,661
Repeat. Operation transitparachuted
behind enemy lines.

560
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,492
Zehn, nenu,

00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,423

Sechs, funf,

00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,364
Vier, drei,

565
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:18,398
Zwei,

566
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,466
Eins,

567
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,639
Null.

568
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,203
What the...

569
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,701
What's that noise?

570
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,565
It's airplanes.

571
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,570
Everybody out!

572
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,140
Sounds like a thousand of them!

573
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,572
Get battalion.

574
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,767
Move! Move!

575
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,074
Get battalion.

00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,483
Zuckerman, report to me!

579
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,180
On thed duble!

580
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,384
The line's dead, sir.

581
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:56,555
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

582
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,404
What's that?

583
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,878
"What's that?" And you
wanted to see Germans, right?

584
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:13,879
Come on!

585
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,575
On the double!

586
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,756

Turn them over! Let's go!

588

Let's go!

589
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,620
Let's go!

590
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,627
Come on! Let's get this baby moving!

591
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,299
Colonel Hessler reports

592
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,901
Panzer tigers moving to the attack.

593
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,502
No menmy activity.

594
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,071
Northern front reporting panzer eisen

595
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,798
Entering losheim cap.

596
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:44,970
No enemy opposition encountered.

597
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,298
Southern front reporting

598
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,337
All elements of panzer eisen

00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:17,503
Linking up at road junction 0-2.

600
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,972
Stay on my tail.

601
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,324
Soldier, did they give
you basic training?

602
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,457
Here.

603
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:06,618
You do it this way.

604
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,596
They're green. Never seen action before.

605
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,736
What do you expect?

606
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,702
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.

607
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,244
Nobody moves without orders.

608
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,417
Yes, sir.

609
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,515
You might as well stay here.

610
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,914
One more man won't make any difference.

611
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,588
I need to look inside a tiger.

612
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,748
Come on.

613
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,439

621
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,262
Tiger to tank 104.

Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

623
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:30,729
Get off the road at once!

624
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:35,567
There's your tiger.

625

With a minute.

629
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,006
Tank 104, reply at once.

630
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:42,167
This is Colonel Hessler.

631
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,047
Button up!

632
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,219

Aah!

637
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,779
Forget it!

638
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:33,952
It's like hitting em with tennis balls.

639
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,491
Let's get out of here!

640
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:46,598
Get out and stay down.'

641
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:56,208
Crawl, you dummy. Crawl.

642
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:05,494
Lieutenant, keep those crenades coming.

643
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,032
Fall back!

Stay low.

650
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,466
Aah!

651
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,811
Hessler to headquarters.

652
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:34,973
Resistance very weak.

653
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,478
Southern front report...

654
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,554

655

Hey, wait for me!

662
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:37,028
Don't hold us up.

663
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:42,167
Grab the tailgate!

664
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,581
Wait for me!

00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,979
Get this thing moving.

666
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,153
Where's your motor pool?

667
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,912
At regiment. 4 kilometers from here.

668
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,954
I got to get back to headquarters.

669
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,591
Go! Go!

670
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:02,698
Wait for me! Hold it a minute!

671
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,967
Hello, Cheyenne?

672
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,869
What's that?
You're under attack?

673
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,668
In what strength?

674
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,640
Well, what's your guess?

675
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,108
I can't give you air reconnaissance.

676
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,645
I'm blind!

677
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,474
Get apache.

678
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,275
Call apache.

679
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,180
Hello, Eddie.
What's going on in your sector?

680
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,685
Only patrol action... how heavy?

681
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,481
What's your reconnaissance say?

682
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,318
Nothing heavy.

683
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,993
I don't know.
We're trying to get a picture.

684
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,164
Stay on tap.

685
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:36,150
The first phase of our
offensive was a success.

686
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,156
The element of surprise was complete.

687
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,489
American communications
are in a turmoil.

688
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:42,722
But we must cross the our river

689
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:43,864
Before the enemy realizes

690
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:49,664
We have launched an all-out offensive.

691
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:53,206
I do not believe I
gave you permission to smoke.

692
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,368
Sorry, sir.

693
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,372
Unfortunately, we didn't have time.
To get better acquainted

694
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,713
But all of you know my reputation.

695
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:09,688
My command always
suffers the highest casualties.

696
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:13,351
The price of victory is never cheap.

697
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:18,125
In this battle we will be
as hard as our tanks.

698
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:21,303
I will reach the objectives
assigned to me...

699
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:24,098
No matter what the cost.

700
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:29,609
Signal from headquarters, Colonel.

701
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,508
Hessler, I congratulate you.

702
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,409
You are on schedule.

703
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,140
I will reach the our river as planned.

704
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,785
The enemy must not be permitted
to destroy the bridge.

705
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,852
Has schumacher seized it?

706
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,080
Not yet.

707
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,759
Schumacher's primary
assicnment is to disrupt

708
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,894
Enemy communications.

709
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,222
I must have that bridge
secured for my tanks.

710
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:52,527
I have no time to build bridges.

711
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,430
Hessler.

712
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,003
Your bridge will be secured.

713
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:02,941
We are expecting you to cross
it according to the schedule.

714
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,374
Do you know your line of march?

715
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:09,541
Coordinate with the map.

716
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:18,316
Conrad, I have a headache.

717
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,159
Land mines?

718
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,226
Why were they not cleared?

719
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,953
Where are the men with the
mine detectors?

720
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,759
We're moving too fast.
The men are following in trucks.

721
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,560
They're all dead.

722
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,933
The mine exploded directly under them.

723
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,835
Notify their seconds
in command to take over.

724
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,603
Tell them I have absolute
confidence in them.

725
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,905
We have lost a tank unnecessarily.

726
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,106
We have lost precious
minutes unnecessarily.

727
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,376
Your troops were here to
protect the panzers.

728
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,384
From now on,
until we clear this mine field,

729
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:24,526
Your men go ahead of my tanks.

730
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:30,722
And have my vehicle repaired at once!

731
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:46,304
Keep moving. Step on it.

732
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,819
Now, listen to me, all of you.

733
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,547
I need precise information...

734
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,782
How many men.

735
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,154
How many guns, how many tanks

736
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:02,957
The enemy are throwing into this,
how much fuel they're carrying.

737
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,360
And get a move on.

738
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:09,698
We've got 24 hours
before we scream rape.

739
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:12,534
All right, Kiley. It's your turn.

740
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,573
They're pouring through, General.

741
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,938
Crack troops, brand-new equipment.

742
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,477
I took a look inside one of their tanks.

743
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,740
They can chew up anything we've got.

744
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,440
Where are they going?

745
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,813
Do you have that information?

746
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,353
No, sir, but Colonel Hessler does.

747
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,457
He's the commanding officer
of the panzer spearhead.

748
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,819
When we know where he's going,

749
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,587
We'll know the objective
of the entire attack.

750
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:38,256
The enemy is probing at five points
along an 85-mile front.

751
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,698
With only that information
at our disposal,

752
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,031
How can you assume Hessler's
column is the spearhead?

753
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,798
The law of probability?

754
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,671
No, sir. Probability's acainst me.

755
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,937
In the absence of other information,

756
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,081
I have one change
in five of being right.

757
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,613
I'd like to explore it.

758
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,614
How?

759
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,217
Well, sir...

760
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,614
I'll tell you how.

761
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,118
Watch the our river.

762
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,383
There's only one bridge right here

763
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:03,991
That can support heavy tanks.

764
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:05,285
That's where Hessler will be

765
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,291
And where I'll be.

766
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,793
Kiley!

767
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,728
Don't get too close to that bridge.
I've ordered it blown up.

768
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:16,997
That's a good thing to know.
Thanks for the tip.

769
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:18,701
Keep moving.

770
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,739
Keep moving. Keep moving.

771
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,706
Come on! Keep moving!

772
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,004
Come on. Let's go.

773
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,703
You there, keep moving.

774
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:26,609
Come on. Let's go.

775
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,785
Come on.

776
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,370
Hey, what are you stopping for?

777
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,981
That sign. When we came through before,

778
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,744
I recall Ambleve was that way.

779
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,978
You're blocking the road.
Get going. Hurry up.

780
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,281
Come on. Let's go.

781
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,926
I tell you those signs are
pointed in the wrong direction.

782
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,220
Hey, what's holding up the parade?

783
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,523
Somebody monkeyed with those
road signs, lieutenant.

784
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:19,668
That ain't the road to Ambleve.

785
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:23,999
Two hours ago I came from Ambleve over
this road.

786
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,937
Maybe they've moved Ambleve in
the meantime.

787
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,475
But two hours ago,
this was the road to it.

788
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,306
Take off.

789
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,846
Lieutenant...
Lieutenant, tell your Sergeant

790
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,143
To get this jeep out of here.

791
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:37,717
Move. That's an order.

792
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,717
Move!

793
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,925
Keep moving!

794
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:50,154
Yeah, I hope they enjoy themselves
in malmedy.

795
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,665
Come on. We're getting off here.

796
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,566
Come on!

797
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,731
Jump.

798
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,839
Hey, wait a minute. Where we going?

799
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:06,173
We're supposed to be in Ambleve.

800
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,577
We'll get there.
I've got to make a pickup.

801
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:11,743
What kind of pickup?
I got merchandise in a farmhouse.

802
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:15,446
The Germans will steal it.

803
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,627
Hey, you two!

804
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:25,957
Come on, Keep moving. Step on it.

805
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:38,975
Are you the last one?

806
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:40,206
Anybody behind you?

807
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:46,548
Yeah, the whole German army.
Go aheat

808
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:47,780
You, there, keep them moving.

809
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,959
Step on it.

810
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,857
Notify the panzers.
The bridge is intact.

811
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:01,969
Achtung, achtung.

812
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:15,013
Any sign of the Germans?

813
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,311
No, not yet.

814
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,316
What are you men doing here?

815
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,079
We've got orders to blow the bridge.

816
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,189
Wait a minute, lieutenant.

817
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:26,350
That job's being done.

818
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,038
How you boys making out?

819
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,537
Just about finished!

820
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,368
Hurry up, will you?

821
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,203
Better get out of here
before those krauts get here.

822
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,673
You need any help?

823
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:45,438
I got a good idea.

824
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,275
We'll give them all a hot water bottle.

825
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:51,214
That water comes off the ice.

826
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,116
I'm loaded with C-4 need any?

827
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:58,191
They could sell you some.

828
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,295
Drive on.

829
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:11,863
Why you got your wires
hooked onto that detonator?

830
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,437
I guess he's in a hurry.

831
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,306
To get killed? That's not the way.

832
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,037
Sarge, bring a couple of men.

833
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:25,209
We'll look under that bridge.

834
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,097
This ain't the road to Ambleve.

835
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,393
This is taking us to malmedy.

836
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,162
The sign says that-away.

837
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,339
The map says Ambleve was this way.

838
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:49,534
Somebody straighten this out.

839
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:53,704
Ambleve. Ambleve...

840
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,211
Hey, Wolenskl!

841
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,150
Oh, Colonel.

842
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,914
We're all fouled up here.

843
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,182
We've been ordered to Ambleve,

844
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,256
But the maps are wrong.

845
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,793
They don't jibe with the signs.

846
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:08,986
This will take you to malmedy.

847
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,632
Ambleve's that way.

848
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,496
We've been following these
signs the whole way.

849
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:20,472
The MPs we ran into directed
us this way.

850
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:23,270
They've been changed.
They switched them around.

851
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,845
Those MPs seem ok to you?

852
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:26,776
What do you mean?

853
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,076
Anything odd about them?

854
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,582
Just regular Cls.

855
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,777
We intercepted an enemy
dispatch a few days ago

856
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,355
Recruiting english-speaking Germans.

857
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,356
When did you cross the river?

858
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,290
8:40. We were the last ones across.

859
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,895
They were going to blow it.

860
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,258
Did you see the bridge blow?

861
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,799
No, but engineers were setting charges.

862
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:50,234
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell?

863
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:54,967
They weren't engineers. They were MPs!

864
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,407
Murphy, get me headquarters!

865
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,582
Major, have someone switch
that sign back!

866
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:01,841
Red river 6, red river 6...

867
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,450
Come in, red river 6.

868
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,279
Come in, red river 2.

869
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,786
Red river 6, this is red river 2.

870
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,151
Germans uniformed as american MPs

871
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,657
Holding our river bridge.

872
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,353
Bridge has not been blown.

873
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:18,897
Repeat.
Germans uniformed as american Mps

874
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,160
Holding our river bridge.

875
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,270
Bridge has not been blown.

876
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:24,666
Over and out.

877
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,843
Let's go!

878
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:46,150
Better hold it, Jack.

879
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,093
What happened?

880
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:51,960
They ran into a fire fight,
German patrol.

881
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,193
I don't see any Germans.

882
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,427
They're in the river.

883
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,162
They didn't make it across.

884
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,898
Get out of here.
We're blowing the bridge.

885
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,599
What?

886
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,369
Are you sure?

887
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:09,540
Watch out. The MPs are krauts!

888
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,866
Oh, my god! Get down!

889
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,276
Why are we waiting?
Get that tank out of the way.

890
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,742
We're preparing to tow it, sir.

891
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,346
Tiger to tanks leopard and panther.

892
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:19,510
Blast that tanks off the bridge.

893
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,991
It's headquarters, Colonel.

894
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,831
General Kohler says
we are behind schedule.

895
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:39,735
He wants to know what's holding us up.

896
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:45,437
Tell the General the Americans are
learning how to retreat.

897
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:53,111
Tiger to panther. Get onto the bridge
push that junk right out of.

898
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:32,183
The way. Stay down.

899
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:47,339
Phy, call headquarters tell them the
our river bridge

900
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,010
The enemy's crossing
in great strength.

901
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,203
Yes, sir.

902
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,556
Let me have your rifle.

903
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,351
What you need is a cannon, sir.

904
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,220
Last time I saw him

905
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:11,422
All I had was a camera.

906
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,235
Can't you hurry it up, Sergeant?

907
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,808
We lost the column.

908
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,911
You happen to have a new carburetor in
your pocket

909
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,877
Lieutenant?

910
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:05,577
You mean we're stuck here?

911
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:10,748
Nope. We can still walk.

912
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,763
Let's go.

913
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,690
Hey, maybe we can get a lift, huh?

914
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,869
Hold it.

915
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:28,266
We better find out
just who they are first.

916
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:34,182
Down.

917
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:42,680
Yeah, Krauts. Back.
