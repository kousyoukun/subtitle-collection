00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000

1944年12月
December, 1944.

9
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:54,761
美军与英军正迈向 他们胜利之路
British and American armies were on the threshold of victory.

10
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,102
越过了半个欧洲 盟军终于对德国本土 
Stretched across half of Europe, the Allies gathered themselves...

11
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:01,110
形成了合围
... for the final assault on Germany.

12
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,713
在北方有蒙哥马利的第八军
To the north stood Montgomery's Eighth Army...

13
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:06,350
在南方有巴顿的第三军
... to the south, Patton's Third.

14
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,214
在中央，沿着88哩长的前线
In the center, along an 88-mile front...

15
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:14,620
几个久经征战而疲乏的美军师 在那个区域安静的休养着
... a few battle-weary American divisions rested in a quiet sector.

16
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:18,891
对他们而言 战争似乎已经赢了
To them, the war seemed already won.

17
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,860
这就是他们的故事
This is their story.

18
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:24,127
中校 我们在这森林飞了一星期
We've been flying over these woods all week.

19
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,328
除了树以外什么也没有 我们回去吧！
There's nothing but trees. Let's turn back.

20
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:30,134
- 饿了吗？ 乔  - 战争已经结束了 
- Getting hungry, Joe?  - The war is over.

21
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,676
我听说后勤司令部要下令 送我们回国去过圣诞节
I hear GHQ is cutting orders to ship us home for Christmas.

22
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:36,815
乔，德国还有六百万武装部队
The German army still has 6 million men carrying arms.

23
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,849
我没听说他们要去过圣诞节
I haven't heard they're going home for Christmas.

24
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,419
在那了
Hey, there it is...

25
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:47,355
德国陆军！
...the German army.

26
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,824
我们飞下去看看！
Let's go down and have a look.

27
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:59,568
- 再飞一次！乔，我要拍照  - 好
- Buzz him again. I wanna get a picture.  - Okay.

28
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:05,766
这一次让你的马达 发点声音出来 让他往上看！
This time, gun your engine. Make him look up.

29
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:28,289
生效了
It worked.

30
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,925
再飞一次，我要再拍一张
Swing around. I wanna get another one.

31
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:11,972
康拉德
Conrad.

32
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,137
我以你为耻
I am ashamed of you.

33
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:17,012
站起来
Get up.

34
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:24,018
我们可能会死的，长官
They could have killed us, sir.

35
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:27,020
你若仔细的看清楚那飞机
If you'd taken the pains to have looked carefully...

36
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,990
你会发现是 没有武装的侦察机！
...you would have observed it was an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

37
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:35,358
他会留在空中叫 战斗机来射我们
You would stay in the car if it were a fighter plane shooting at us.

38
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:39,258
我还没打输 也不想死在车后座
I did not lose a war to die in the back seat of a car.

39
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,496
上校认为我们有选择的权利？ 选我们死在那里？
Does the colonel think any of us has a choice where we will die?

40
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:48,235
我想你是死在家里的床上 康拉德
I know where you'll die, Conrad, at home, in your own bed.

41
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:51,505
所以上校计划要换掉我
Is the colonel trying to get rid of me?

42
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:57,215
我认为世界预备好 要弄掉我们俩
I think that the world is going to get rid of both of us.

43
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:00,750
把你的帽子捡起来 把它戴上 
Pick up your cap! Put it on.

44
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:03,519
试着看起来像个军人
Try to look like a soldier!

45
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,727
当个军人又有什么好的？
What good is a soldier anyhow?

46
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,127
你胜了，你在这与这个为伍
He wins, he loses.

47
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,792
看看我现在又是什么样子
What's he good for anyhow?

48
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:14,596
康拉德！ 我以前告诉过你，
Conrad, I've told you before...

49
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:17,741
别让引擎空转 汽油就如同血液一样宝贵！
...never leave the motor running. Petrol is blood.

50
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,274
抱歉，长官，
I'm sorry, sir.

51
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:21,537
不会再发生了
It won't happen again.

52
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:41,562
看来十点钟方向的地面上 有东西 我们去看看
Looks like something on the ground at 10 o'clock. Let's take a look.

53
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,410
什么也没有
Nothing.

54
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,569
我们回去吧！
Let's go home.

55
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:56,702
海斯勒上校到了
Herr Oberst Hessler is here.

56
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,325
是！是！海斯勒上校

57
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:23,289
这边走，长官

58
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,955
- 海斯勒上校，长官  - 好的
- Colonel Hessler, sir.  - Yes.

59
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:48,255
海斯勒！
Well, Hessler.

60
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,729
好久不见了
It has been a long time.

61
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,230
再见到你太好了
How good it is to see you again.

62
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,636
你神采依旧
You look the same.

63
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:56,964
有点…
Little...

64
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:58,469
也许有点瘦了
Little leaner perhaps.

65
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,543
你的苏俄前线 并没让我好好发挥 将军
The Russian front does not put meat on a man's bones, general.

66
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:07,443
是的 战争影响了我们每一个人
Ah, yes. War is hard on all of us.

67
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:10,750
- 中央暖气系统  - 是啊
- Central heating.  - Yeah.

68
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,444
水晶吊灯
Crystal chandeliers.

69
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:15,719
你这间房间真是舒适
You have a nice cellar.

70
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:18,587
戈林元帅给了我那幅画
Field Marshal Goring gave me that painting.

71
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,955
很可爱，不是吗？
Lovely, isn't it?

72
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:29,192
想想是他去年在巴黎 找到的交易
I imagine he found a bargain in Paris last year.

73
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:32,137
我的伍长在外面 开车开的很累
My corporal's waiting. He's had a hard drive.

74
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:36,300
你想在这些废墟的某处 能找张床
Do you suppose there's somewhere in these ruins he can find a bed?

75
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:38,978
坐，海斯勒
Sit down, Hessler.

76
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:45,145
你得对德国人民的天才 有点信心
You have too little faith in the genius of the German people.

77
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:48,789
几块石头被打倒了
A few stones have been knocked down...

78
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,019
但我们的国家依然坚强 比以前更团结，更有生机
...but our country's strong, united, determined...

79
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,286
更有生产效率
...and more productive than ever.

80
00:13:55,466 --> 00:14:00,869
盟国以为他们对我们持续轰炸能够打击我们的士气
The Allies think that their constant air raids have undermined our morale.

81
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,268
- 这永远不会发生的  - 你为何找我来此？ 将军
- This they'll never do.  - Why have you sent for me, general?

82
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:10,280
你是我们最佳的战车指挥官 海斯勒
You are our finest panzer commander, Hessler.

83
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,142
能带我们走向胜利的人
You will lead us to victory.

84
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,810
我们德国现在像冰山一样
Our Germany is now like an iceberg.

85
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,321
只有小部份能在表面看到
Only a fraction of it can be seen on the surface.

86
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,219
让我带你看看一些成果
Let me show you some of the results...

87
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,761
德国在地下所制造的
...of what Germany has produced underground.

88
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,996
这是新的德国
You will discover a new Germany...

89
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:33,831
而当个德国人会有新的骄傲
...and will take a new pride in being a German.

90
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,397
我们最新的飞机
Our latest airplane.

91
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,007
喷射机
A jet.

92
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,168
时速高达九百公里
It flies at more than 900 kilometers per hour.

93
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,577
六个月之内 我们就能造足够的喷射机
Within six months, we will have enough jet fighters...

94
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:48,219
把盟军空中的 每架飞机都打下来
...to shoot down every Allied plane in the air.

95
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,747
我们的V1火箭摧毁了20%的伦敦
Our V-1 rocket destroyed 20 percent of London.

96
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:57,327
V2会彻底的毁掉那城市
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

97
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,931
我们新型的70吨的虎型坦克
The new 70-ton King Tiger tank.

98
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,432
较美军坦克的火力大两倍半
It has two-and-a-half times the firepower...

99
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:11,837
装甲要厚两倍！
...and double the armor of the American tanks.

100
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,938
我们德国离结束还早呢！ 不是吗？
Our Germany is far from finished, Hessler.

101
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:21,109
很漂亮的模型，将军
It's a very beautiful model, general.

102
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:26,521
那证明了我们的元首 是最佳的玩具制造者
It proves that the Germans are still the world's best toy makers.

103
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:32,460
我们今日所做的玩具 不是小孩的
The toys we are making these days are not for children.

104
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,930
让我带你去看它们
Let me show them to you.

105
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,384
举起手
Hands up! Get on over.

106
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,620
靠墙站，举起手
Hold it! Put them up! Stand against the wall. Put them up, general.

107
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,098
孩子们
Well, boys...

108
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,996
好像我们抓到一些大鱼
...looks like we've caught ourselves a couple of big fish.

109
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:13,607
- 一条肥鱼  - 够了
- One nice, fat Kraut trout.  - That's enough, now.

110
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:20,271
对不起，将军我们正在搞突击演习
Sorry, general. We are just rehearsing a commando raid.

111
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,914
很好
Very good.

112
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,607
不错吧，是不是？
Not bad, Hessler, huh?

113
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,087
他们把你蒙骗了？
Had you fooled, didn't they?

114
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:29,119
完全
Completely.

115
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,315
不幸的是，我很能玩游戏
Unfortunately, I am beyond playing games.

116
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:34,791
不是游戏
Oh, this is no game.

117
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:38,090
是德国士兵，全都是
These are German soldiers, all of them.

118
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,996
训练有素的德国士兵
Trained German soldiers.

119
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:46,367
迪波命令手榴弹兵紧跟坦克1旅
Diepel commands the panzer grenadiers attached to the 1 st Tank Brigade.

120
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,771
这些人会与他们一同作战
These men will work with him.

121
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:53,107
迪波少校，请向上校解释
Major Diepel, kindly explain Operation Transit to the colonel.

122
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:57,047
士兵会在美国线后面伞降
The soldiers will be parachuted behind the American lines.

123
00:16:57,219 --> 00:17:01,154
他们的任务是破坏敌军通讯
Their mission: To disrupt enemy communications.

124
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:03,950
我们组织了许多此类的队伍
We have organized many such teams.

125
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:09,290
每支队伍由一名在美国居住过的人领导
Each will be led by a man who has actually lived in America.

126
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:12,558
舒马赫在德州居住了12年
Schumacher here lived in Texas for 12 years...

127
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,328
然后才回到祖国
...before returning to the fatherland.

128
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,337
告诉我，中尉，你最喜欢的棒球选手是谁？
Tell me, lieutenant, who is your favorite baseball player?

129
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,874
- 鲁・格里克  - 因为他打出了最多的本垒打？
- Lou Gehrig.  - Because he's hit the most home runs?

130
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:26,345
不，是贝比・鲁斯，在1927年打出60个本垒打
No, sir. Babe Ruth hit the most home runs, 60 in 1927.

131
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:29,349
你对希特勒有何看法？
And what's your opinion of Adolf Hitler?

132
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:35,251
作为一名美国人我对这人比较反感
As an American, my opinion would be offensive to these gentlemen.

133
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,894
众位，作为一名美国军官你不与德国人一样看待
Come, lieutenant. As an American officer, you care nothing for German opinion.

134
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:46,497
希特勒是一个狂热的奥地利粉漆工
Adolf Hitler is a crazy, Austrian housepainter.

135
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:51,105
他是个疯子，以为比全世界的人都有智慧
He's a madman who thinks he knows more than the whole general's staff.

136
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:54,402
他使德国走向彻底毁灭
And he's leading Germany to complete, total destruction.

137
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:58,178
你可能言之有过了
Perhaps you are going too far.

138
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:03,547
不要假装了，他们的内心都是美国人的想法
To carry off this great deception, even their reflexes must be American.

139
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:09,180
你的想法很值得恭喜，中尉
Your reflexes are to be congratulated, lieutenant.

140
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:15,999
无礼的人
Insolent man.

141
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:18,901
让他开心一下
Let him have his fun now.

142
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,903
若他被俘他会被当作间谍杀死
If he is captured, he will be shot as a spy.

143
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:25,371
若他幸存他会被当作叛徒杀死
And if he survives, he can be shot as a traitor.

144
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:32,210
你得承认我们检查很严密
You must admit, we are very thorough.

145
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:42,420
即使有通行证也无法到此
Even a pass won't get you through here.

146
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,625
我们要攻击 并通过罗森关口
We will attack through the Losheim Gap.

147
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,103
那里只有一个营的兵力防守
It's defended only by a single battalion.

148
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:32,800
在施奈亚芙的美军师会被切断
The American division on the Schnee Eifel will be cut off.

149
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:35,674
那么瓦尔河的桥会在我们手中
Then the Our River Bridge will be in our hands.

150
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:40,174
由那里到安不列芙是喉头地带
From there, on to Ambleve, with its road network.

151
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:44,879
四天之后，我们会越过马士河
In four days, we will be across the River Meuse.

152
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,659
目标是在那里呢？
The strategic objective?

153
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:49,351
安特卫普
Antwerp.

154
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:54,164
我们攻下了安特卫普 会将敌军兵力分割为二
By taking Antwerp, we split the enemy forces in two.

155
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:58,229
他们要花18个月才能恢复
It will take them 18 months to recover.

156
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,900
到那时候我们的喷射机 就能占有空中优势
By then, we will have air superiority with our jet engines.

157
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,408
甚至我们更有独特的武器
And we will have even more significant weapons.

158
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:10,379
一种能在一瞬间 毁灭整城的武器
Weapons which can destroy an entire city with a single blast.

159
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,512
你遗忘了一个重要的细节 将军
You have forgotten one important detail, general.

160
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:18,749
盟军现有的空中优势
With their present control of the air, the Allies will smash our tanks...

161
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,588
会夷平我们的坦克、机枪部队
...machine-gun our troops, bomb the bridges...

162
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,491
炸掉桥及切断我们的通信
...and cut our communications.

163
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:29,533
假使我告诉你 不会有盟军飞机呢
Suppose I tell you there will be no Allied planes.

164
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:33,266
另一种秘密武器
Another secret weapon?

165
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:36,234
来自挪威的史必兹堡
From Spitzbergen, Norway...

166
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,378
世界最北端的气象站
...the northernmost weather station in the world.

167
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:42,710
我等这份报告已经两个月了
We have been waiting two months for this report.

168
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:47,218
低气压自12月16日起南下
"A low-pressure area over northern Europe, starting December 16th.

169
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:51,290
云雾皆浓，任何飞机不能起飞
Low clouds and fog which will ground all aircraft."

170
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:54,890
- 有多久？  - 够久了
- How long?  - Long enough...

171
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:57,530
若我们能和 我们定的时间表同速
...if we keep strictly to our timetable.

172
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,926
不寻常的钟，不是吗？
Unusual clock, isn't it?

173
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,637
只有一圈
It has only one cycle.

174
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,170
50个小时
Fifty hours.

175
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:11,439
我们有足够的资源 供50个小时的全力攻击
We have the resources for 50 hours, full-scale attack.

176
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:17,480
地图，时钟，玩具
Maps, clocks, toys.

177
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:20,777
但我要用什么来作战呢？
But with what will I fight?

178
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,720
海斯勒上校
Colonel Hessler...

179
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:27,122
我要任命你 当我们机械化前锋的指挥官
...l'm putting you in command of our armored spearhead.

180
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:10,300
可以
It can be done.

181
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:40,967
（师部）

182
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,504
只是来聊天的
This came in from SHAEF.

183
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:45,904
我今天收到家里寄的圣诞蛋糕
I got a Christmas cake from home today.

184
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:49,239
- 我想我还会在这里吃它  - 立刻把这个发出去
- Think I'll still be here to eat it?  - Send this right through.

185
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:52,248
立刻冲洗这个 一经到定影液后 就立刻拿来给我
Develop this. Bring me the prints as soon as they come out.

186
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,908
- 是的，长官  - 哈，凯利
- Yes, sir.  - Hello, Kiley.

187
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,552
在你今早的搜索中 找到德军了吗？
Find any Germans under your bed this morning?

188
00:22:56,721 --> 00:23:00,918
也许明晚一晚都在那行军 我一刻也睡不着
Marching around under there all night. Couldn't sleep a wink.

189
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:03,057
是命令！
That's an order.

190
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:08,255
我要那菜单上的每一样东西 送到师里每位弟兄的手中
I want every item on that menu delivered to every soldier in the division...

191
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,924
尤其是那些在前线的
...especially those in the forward positions.

192
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:14,435
我要它们及时送到 以便当做圣诞晚餐
And I want them delivered in time for Christmas dinner.

193
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,903
我们的情报部队 自敌人间谍那里得到的
Counterintelligence picked this up from an enemy agent.

194
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:21,044
日期是11月29日
Dated November 29th.

195
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:24,272
由元帅凯特尔发出，最高机密
"From Field Marshal Keitel. Most secret.

196
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,579
会说英文的军官与士兵 因特别任务召集
Officers and men who speak English are wanted for special mission.

197
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:32,553
志愿者向科勒将军的总部报到
Volunteers will report to General Kohler's headquarters."

198
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:35,420
- 你有何想法？  - 我个人的意见是，将军
- What do you make of it?  - You know my opinion.

199
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:38,221
只是另一次的确认 他们要攻击我们了
This is one more confirmation. They're going to attack.

200
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:40,830
得了吧！凯利！ 别又来那一套了
Oh, come on, Kiley, not that again.

201
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:45,435
他们可能预备将第五纵队 空投在我们的阵线后面
They're probably preparing a fifth column to drop behind our lines.

202
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,262
你也在国务院待过吗？ 凯利
Were you in the State Department too, Kiley?

203
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,467
我以为你的经验局限在 警务工作
I thought your experience was limited to police work.

204
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:57,211
我当刑警并不使我 失去思考资格
Having been an inspector of police doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

205
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:59,214
所有的警察都思想熟虑
All cops aren't flatfoots.

206
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:01,281
你有限的军事经验
Your limited military experience...

207
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:04,946
使我们对你的结论没什么信心 若你认为…
...doesn't inspire confidence in your conclusions. If you think...

208
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,093
为何你一直说他们预备攻击
Why do you keep saying they're mounting an offensive?

209
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:13,158
我在战前花了20年 都在问问题
I spent 20 years before the war asking questions.

210
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,164
而自登陆欧洲后 你又叫我做同样的事情
Ever since D-day, you've had me doing the same thing...

211
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,633
侦讯战俘 
...interrogating prisoners.

212
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,931
我只能报告我所知道的
I can only report what I've learned.

213
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:25,134
面对我们的德军士兵 仍然是一个没有击溃的敌军
The German soldier facing us is still an undefeated enemy.

214
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:27,439
他们仍然能作战！ 他们的领袖知道那一点！
He can still fight. His leaders know that.

215
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:29,638
只要他们还能作战 他们就会攻击
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

216
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:33,441
我的科里还有其他十位军官
I have 10 other officers in my section.

217
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:37,921
我们看到的是同样的资料 看到与你相同的事实，凯利
We see the same information, get the same facts as you, Kiley.

218
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:42,187
所有的人都得到同样的答案 而你出来的是完全相反的
All of us come up with one answer, you come up with the complete opposite.

219
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:45,193
当十个人都说你醉了 你最好躺下来！
When 10 men tell you you're drunk, you'd better lie down.

220
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,799
比瑞奇上校 你也许是我的上司
Colonel Pritchard, you may be my superior officer...

221
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:49,832
他是的
He is.

222
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:52,935
打扰，长官 这是你要的照片，中校
Excuse me. Here are the prints you wanted.

223
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:54,539
谢谢
Thank you.

224
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,503
看看这上面的是什么
Look what showed up on this one.

225
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:03,173
看看阿登森林
I took it over the Ardennes.

226
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:09,914
这是辆虎型坦克，或不是？
Is this a Tiger tank, or isn't it?

227
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:12,988
这上面的是它
So it appears.

228
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,287
但一只老虎不能构成整座森林 长官
One tiger doesn't make a jungle, sir.

229
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,731
我期待在森林中看到老虎 但我在宁静的邻近地区 看到一只
I expect tigers in jungles. When I discover one in a peaceful neighborhood...

230
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:23,232
我建议我们大家都看看床底下
...I recommend all of us take a good look under our beds.

231
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,167
打扰了，长官
Excuse me, sir.

232
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,982
到外面去
Step outside.

233
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,094
请你允许，长官
With your permission, sir.

234
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:59,372
这是总部来的，凯利 最高机密
This is from headquarters, Kiley. Top-secret.

235
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:03,739
第三军奉令攻击德国萨尔区
The Third Army has been ordered to attack the Germans in the Saar.

236
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:07,210
巴顿将军已进攻了两天了
General Patton is launching the offensive in two days.

237
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:08,872
总部会命令整个军进攻南方
Does it seem possible...

238
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:12,680
而在北方敌人 会攻击阿登地区
...headquarters would commit an entire army to an offensive in the south...

239
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:16,586
这对你是否没有一点道理？
...if there were any possibility of the Germans attacking in the Ardennes?

240
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:22,720
我们全都尊敬总部 但他们可能会出错的
With all due respect to headquarters, they could be wrong.

241
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:25,964
总之还是把这个送去总部
Send this to headquarters anyway.

242
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:28,296
比瑞奇 那坦克上似乎有新配备
There seem to be new features on that tank.

243
00:26:28,506 --> 00:26:29,802
- 是的，长官  - 还有别的事吗？
- Yes, sir.  - Anything else?

244
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:32,702
我想查查这位德国军官
Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown on this German officer.

245
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:37,740
- 好的，把这一起送去  - 是的，长官
- All right, send this along.  - Yes, sir.

246
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,275
你最好到前线 去叫他们捉新战俘
Get up to the line and tell them to grab some new prisoners.

247
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:45,616
- 我对我能得到的任何新资料都感兴趣  - 是的，长官
- I'm interested in any fresh information.  - Yes, sir.

248
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,246
还有一件事 你在侦察机里做什么？
One thing more. What are you doing in a reconnaissance plane?

249
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:52,259
我们不是请你来当战斗军人的
We're not paying you to be a combat soldier.

250
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,455
- 想要一个人缩短这场战争？  - 不是，长官 
- Trying to shorten the war by yourself?  - No, sir.

251
00:26:55,633 --> 00:27:00,626
只是想确定能如愿的安享你订的那份圣诞晚餐
Just wanna make sure I can enjoy that nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

252
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,012
我看到上校又有食欲了
I see the colonel's in fine appetite again.

253
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,847
我是的
I am.

254
00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:19,682
陪我喝杯酒吧！
Join me in a glass of wine.

255
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:21,620
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

256
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:25,494
- 坐下  - 谢谢
- Sit down.  - Thanks.

257
00:27:36,508 --> 00:27:38,372
康拉德
Conrad.

258
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:41,703
说话呀
Speak.

259
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:45,345
上校希望我说些什么呢？
What does the colonel wish me to say?

260
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:47,712
说你心里的话，说真话
Speak your mind, the truth.

261
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:53,154
别怕，康拉德 总得有人对我说真话
Don't be afraid, Conrad. I must have someone to tell me the truth.

262
00:27:56,596 --> 00:28:02,227
我很幸运能服侍一位聪明的人
I've always been fortunate to serve under brilliant men...

263
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:04,732
他知道所有的事
...who know everything.

264
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:07,838
由那全部，我知道一件事
From them, I've learned one thing:

265
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:13,342
当一切都失去时 但这位聪明人并未失去希望
When all was lost, these brilliant men never lost hope.

266
00:28:14,548 --> 00:28:16,174
我仰慕那一点
I admire that.

267
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:20,984
你对这个人还仰慕那些呢？
What else do you admire about these men?

268
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,214
幻像
The illusion.

269
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:28,717
也许我没用对字，上校
Maybe I'm not using the right word, colonel.

270
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:31,487
我不是个受过教育的人
I'm not an educated man.

271
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:35,732
希望永远都还有一次机会
The hope that there is always one more chance.

272
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:39,130
那是，你知道吗？ 幻像
That is the illusion.

273
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:44,140
继续，康拉德，说的非常好
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

274
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,377
这不是我说这种事的地方
It's not my place to speak of such things.

275
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,949
说呀！
Go on.

276
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,251
我命令你说
I order you to.

277
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:57,851
上校
Colonel...

278
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,192
这个新指挥权 是幻像
...this new command is an illusion.

279
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:06,759
放弃吧！
Give it up.

280
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:12,298
我是马丁海斯勒
I am Martin Hessler.

281
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:15,802
四年前我的坦克在一周之内
Four years ago, my panzers overran Poland in one week.

282
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:18,102
征服了波兰，那不是幻像
That was no illusion.

283
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,113
39天我的坦克一路打到巴黎 那不是幻像
In 39 days, my tanks smashed all the way to Paris. That was no illusion.

284
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:25,284
我征服了克里米亚 那不是幻像
I conquered the Crimea. That was no illusion.

285
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:29,147
今天
Today...

286
00:29:29,323 --> 00:29:32,723
给了我一个旅的虎型坦克
...I was given a brigade of Tiger tanks.

287
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:35,760
当我有一旅的坦克
When I have a brigade of tanks...

288
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,454
那就是现实
...that is reality.

289
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:41,929
但谁是驾驶那些坦克的人
And who will drive your tanks?

290
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:45,071
你率领的人是军人
The men you led were soldiers. Veteran soldiers.

291
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,070
还有剩下的吗？
Are there any left?

292
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,141
他们现在给你的是什么？
What will they give you now?

293
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,675
我在波兰，法国，克里米亚 都与你并肩在一起
I was by your side in Poland, France, Crimea.

294
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,836
看看我，上校 我不是那个人了
Look at me, colonel, I'm not the same man.

295
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:58,008
我今天被一架 没有武装的侦察机吓的半死！
I jumped in a ditch today at the sight of an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

296
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,744
我的两个儿子 记得我是勇敢战士
My two boys remember me as a good soldier.

297
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,617
他们不会相信的
They wouldn't believe it.

298
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,418
但是上校，我不是唯一的一个
But, colonel, I am not the only one.

299
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:11,258
你能多确定你的人 会与坦克共存亡？
How sure can you be of the men who will drive your tanks?

300
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,640
- 基伯少校  - 稍待！上校
- Major Diepel?  - [Speak German]

301
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:28,281
- 基伯  - 有
- Diepel.  - Yep.

302
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:32,816
- 我要见我的坦克连长 立刻召集  - 他们马上来
- I want to see my tank commanders. Have them assembled at once.  - - [Speak German]

303
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:37,255
- 康拉德 我的靴子  - 有 
- Conrad, my boots.  - Yep.

304
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,103
立正！

305
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:55,269
你的战车连长！长官
Your commanders, sir.

306
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:12,823
孩子！太多孩子了
Boys. Too many boys.

307
00:31:13,531 --> 00:31:16,556
第一场战役会把他们变成男人
The first battle will turn them into men.

308
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:19,099
昔日我们生活六个月才上战场
In the old days, I lived six months with my men...

309
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:23,364
我认得他们，他们认得我 而这些是陌生人
...before going into action. I knew them, they knew me. These are strangers.

310
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:25,032
太多孩子了 
Too many boys.

311
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,005
他们从来没被击败过
They have never tasted defeat.

312
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,942
他们知道什么在等着他们吗？
Do they know what is expected of them?

313
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:33,242
他们预备好为你而死！
They are ready to die for you.

314
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,012
你能要求更多吗？
Can you ask more?

315
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,198
唱！
Sing.

316
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:38,034
大声点！
Louder.

317
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,559
慢点！慢点
Hold it. Hold it.

318
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:06,962
慢点！慢点
Hold it. Hold it.

319
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,438
前进 有军官在这，
Pull up. We got brass on our tail. Take it...

320
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,576
往前开！白痴
Pull it forward, you idiot!

321
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,811
去死吧！ 往前进！白痴
Drop dead. Pull it forward, you idiot!

322
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,644
只要一点点，慢一点
Just a little bit. Hold it.

323
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,515
停！停！
Hold it! Hold it!

324
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:27,679
你把我的货物弄掉下来了
You're dropping my merchandise!

325
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,018
快点，艾迪！快点出来
Barrel and Eddie, come on out of there.

326
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,321
快点！高林
Come on, Cortland.

327
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,100
大灾难！
Disaster.

328
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:41,903
没破 好一个驾驶 没打破算你运气好
Solid. Some driver, huh? Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

329
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,733
- 向我的工会投诉吧！  - 是，去吧，把它们绑好
- Complain to my union.  - Yeah, go ahead, tie it up.

330
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,069
- 我们接近敌区了吗？  - 太近了
- We near enemy territory yet?  - Too near.

331
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,235
- 杜丹，给我根烟  - 我不抽烟
- Give me a cigarette.  - I don't smoke.

332
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,472
上士 我们何时才能看到德国人
Sarge, when will we see some Germans?

333
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,082
- 你呢？ 贝罗  - 抽你自己的吧
- Barrel?  - Smoke your own.

334
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,581
你有烟吗？ 艾迪
Got a cigarette, Eddie?

335
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,050
- 你开玩笑  - 一些便宜货
- You kidding?  - You cheapskates.

336
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,883
由我的袋子里拿条烟给我
Reach into my bag, get me a carton of cigarettes.

337
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,888
你和德国人有那不对劲？
What's with you and the Germans?

338
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,152
没什么，我只没看过而已
Nothing. I just ain't never seen one.

339
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,821
你知道 我甚至没见过德国飞机
You know, I've never even seen a German plane.

340
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,489
上士，我们何时能打仗？
Sarge, when are we gonna get in the action?

341
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,192
你是疯子吗？
What are you, some kind of a nut?

342
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,929
他们派给我们的 是那种补充兵？
What kind of replacements they sending us, huh?

343
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,866
我想看打仗
"I wanna see action."

344
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,705
- 这是什么？  - 把它放回去，那是货物
- What's this?  - Put that back. That's merchandise.

345
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,370
别告诉我 我们去的地方有女人
Don't tell me there's women where we're going.

346
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:27,245
- 你要把这个送给谁？  - 葛菲不会送东西给人
- Who are you gonna give these to?  - Guffy don't give nothing.

347
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,045
- 他靠它们挣钱  - 你继续绑你的
- He's peddling them.  - You keep tying it up.

348
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:32,782
- 卖它们？ 卖给谁？  - 前线的人 
- Peddling them? To who?  - The boys in the front.

349
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:36,860
到了德国就需要它了 那里有很多妞！
They're gonna need that in Germany. There's lots of broads there.

350
00:36:37,897 --> 00:36:40,763
- 法国香水  - 香槟
- French perfume.  - Champagne.

351
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,264
在我们去的地方一瓶值30元
That's gonna bring me 30 bills a bottle where we're going.

352
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:47,872
因为对我们的人来说 没有任何东西是太好了
Because there's nothing, nothing too good for our boys.

353
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:51,032
- 这里面是什么？  - 那是邮件
- Yeah. What's in here?  - That's the mail.

354
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,303
你连那个也要收费吗？
Are you gonna charge them something for that too?

355
00:36:55,182 --> 00:37:00,140
- 有何不可？他们不会拒绝的  - 只是开玩笑，上士 只是开玩笑
- No, they wouldn't sit still for that.  - Just kidding, sarge. Just kidding.

356
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:03,048
不，当你有这种好点子时 不管是什么我都要你告诉我
No. When you get these thoughts, tell me anyway...

357
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:06,588
因为我不要再回家当穷光蛋
...because one thing I'm not going back home again is poor.

358
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:09,124
继续想，小鬼，很好
Keep thinking, kid. Very nice.

359
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:32,314
德军？
Germans?

360
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,518
这是最前线了
This is the up-front front.

361
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:53,200
真是群清醒的孩子们
Wide awake bunch of boys.

362
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:57,674
- 你们不该派卫兵站岗吗？  - 抱歉，长官 我才进去一会儿
- Don't you people ever post a sentry?  - I'm sorry, sir. I came in for a second.

363
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:00,210
玩什么花样？ 关门！
What's the matter? Close the pneumonia hole.

364
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:02,974
- 你在那生的？ 谷仓吗？  - 抱歉，长官，
- What were you born in, a barn?  - Oh, sorry, sir.

365
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:05,175
我们不知道是你
We didn't know it was you.

366
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,645
- 乌兰斯基少校呢？  - 他在那边，长官
- Major Wolenski?  - He's over there, sir.

367
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:18,454
中校，我没料到有高阶军官来 否则我会叫我的人精明点 
Hello, colonel. I wasn't expecting a visit or I'd have had my men smarten up.

368
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:20,793
你好 给中校来点热咖啡
How are you? Hot coffee for the colonel.

369
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,959
到这边来暖和一下
Come over and get warm.

370
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,664
你这蛮轻松的
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

371
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,538
那收音机一直在叫着 圣诞节时我们全都回家去了
That radio's been yakking between Christmas carols we're all going home.

372
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:32,542
请坐
Here, sit down.

373
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:36,007
想要在这种只想保暖的地方
It's tough keeping discipline when the only action...

374
00:38:36,185 --> 00:38:38,345
来维持军纪，并不简单
...is sitting on your butt to keep warm.

375
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,010
对面的德军在干什么？
What are the Germans doing?

376
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,885
同样的事，他们没有火
Same damn thing, except they don't have any heat.

377
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:45,389
他们得运动来保持暖和
They gotta exercise to keep from freezing.

378
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:48,724
我对你的人也带来一点小运动
Well, I got a little exercise for your boys.

379
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:51,991
我今晚要派巡逻队 抓战俘回来
I wanna patrol tonight, try to pick up some prisoners.

380
00:38:54,104 --> 00:38:56,595
好，我来安排
Well, there they are.

381
00:39:04,814 --> 00:39:08,271
- 上士，把那些毡子装回去  - 别这样，把窗户封起来
- Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.  - Come on, shut the window.

382
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:10,441
你为何要那么做？ 上士
What do you wanna do that for, sarge?

383
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,111
你知道那超过射程 只会招惹较大火力的还击而已
They're out of range. They'll shoot back with something heavier.

384
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:18,454
是你和他们，狗脸 我需要练习
It's you or them, dogface. I need practice.

385
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,363
够了，上士，
That's enough, sergeant.

386
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:24,762
想玩射击游戏 就到外面去
If you wanna play with that popgun, you can go outside.

387
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:29,963
你认为我带人去打野外如何？ 少尉
What do you say I take the men out for a field drill, lieutenant?

388
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,768
在这种天气下 为了什么呢？
In this weather? What for?

389
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:37,970
因为他们在操练 那就是为什么
Because they're drilling, that's why.

390
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:41,583
我想出操时会让你知道，上士
I'll let you know when I want a drill, sergeant.

391
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:44,720
是的，长官，少尉
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

392
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:50,290
我要那个上士
I'll take that sergeant.

393
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:54,659
好，那没关系 但你其他的志愿者由我挑选
All right. That's all right. But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.

394
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,566
你的，中校
Here you are, colonel.

395
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:02,265
我们在天黑前还有三个小时 来点一半一半如何？
We got about three hours before dark. How about some half-and-half?

396
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,304
只要加一点点就行了
Just sweeten it.

397
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:29,150
稍候

398
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:39,342
你是海斯勒上校？
You are Colonel Hessler?

399
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,001
你是谁？
Who are you?

400
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,671
你是怎么进来这里的？
How did you get in here?

401
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:48,218
科勒将军的签字是魔术
General Kohler's signature is magic.

402
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,319
请原谅我们失陪，少校
You will excuse us, major.

403
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,356
在你下命令之前 我能问你的阶级吗？
Before you give orders, may I ask your rank?

404
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:55,992
一级交际花
Courtesan, first class.

405
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,721
科勒将军的致意
Compliments of General Kohler.

406
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,558
我想我们都谈到了，上校
I think we have covered everything, colonel.

407
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:11,674
科勒将军没告诉我你这么帅！
General Kohler did not tell me you were so handsome.

408
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,335
科勒将军对我的事 告诉你些什么
What did General Kohler tell you about me?

409
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,574
什么都没说
Nothing.

410
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,577
任何我想知道的事
Whatever I want to know...

411
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:25,647
我会自己去发掘
...l'll find out for myself.

412
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:28,350
对那方面我很在行
I'm very good at that.

413
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,992
你不请我喝杯酒吗？
Aren't you going to offer me a drink?

414
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:42,366
还是你在前线待的太久 忘了礼貌
Or have you been at the front so long you have forgotten your manners?

415
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:52,245
我们聊些什么？
What shall we talk about?

416
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:54,852
也许聊你太太
Your wife perhaps.

417
00:41:59,693 --> 00:42:01,853
你不与我一块喝吗？
Won't you join me?

418
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:10,864
有人说我是个有魅力的女人
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

419
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:13,529
而你对我并不太注意
You are not paying much attention to me.

420
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,870
能逃过我注意的非常少
Very little has escaped my attention.

421
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:21,308
科勒将军的确告诉我一件事
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

422
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:28,078
他最钦佩你的是 你在女人方面的名声
What he admires most about you is your reputation with the ladies.

423
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:34,926
真遗憾 我的指挥官对我是这个看法
I regret that is the opinion of my commanding officer.

424
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:42,095
我非常努力的保持 我是军人之名
I have worked very hard to achieve a reputation as a soldier.

425
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,737
我们两不能在一起了吗？
Do not the two go together?

426
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:47,931
转达将军，他的好意我心领了
Give the general my compliments. Tell him, "Thank you.

427
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,101
晚安
I appreciate his gesture." And good night.

428
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:54,438
你能自己走出去
You can make your own way out.

429
00:43:16,473 --> 00:43:18,440
距攻击发起时间还有2小时
Zero minus two hours.

430
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:20,438
各部队预备攻击
All units ready to attack.

431
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:26,571
重复:距攻击发起时间 有2小时 各部队预备攻击
Repeat. Zero minus two hours. All units ready to attack.

432
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:40,183
- 快点！快点！  - 把手放下来，德国人
- Come on.  - Put them down, dummkopf.

433
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:46,827
哈！凯利
Hello, Kiley.

434
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:50,871
我很好奇你如何侦讯你的战俘
I was curious to see how you interrogate your prisoners.

435
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,703
我其他的军官也许问错了问题
My other officers may be asking the wrong questions.

436
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:58,744
我恐怕不会有新的答案
I'm afraid you won't hear any new answers.

437
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:03,511
有时候你看到的较他们所说的更来的重要
Sometimes it's more important what you see than what they say.

438
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:16,561
这里能亮一点吗？
Could we get a little more light in here?

439
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:18,758
这样行吗？ 长官
How's that, sir?

440
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:34,949
这就是不败之师的面孔
So this is the face of the undefeated enemy.

441
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,110
看起来像是 星期天主日学上抓的
It looks like you've captured a Sunday school class.

442
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:42,282
这是他们剩下 能放在前线的吗？ 他们武器在那？
This all they have left to put in the front lines? Where are the weapons?

443
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,256
在这，长官
Here, sir.

444
00:44:47,566 --> 00:44:49,227
这是什么？
What's this?

445
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:55,829
枪膛里还有黄油 这从未射击过
Still has grease in the barrel. It's never been fired.

446
00:44:56,008 --> 00:44:58,066
- 他们有开枪吗？  - 没有，长官
- Did they put up any fight?  - No, sir.

447
00:44:58,243 --> 00:45:00,176
只是投降？
Just gave up.

448
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:04,007
我不感到惊异，他们只是孩子
Well, I'm not surprised. They're only children.

449
00:45:04,182 --> 00:45:06,115
仔细的看看他们，凯利
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

450
00:45:06,284 --> 00:45:10,083
他们甚至不够强悍到能被视为不良少年
They're not even tough enough to be classified as delinquents.

451
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:13,781
问他们吗？ 他们是否会赢得战争
Go ahead and question them. Ask if Germany's gonna win the war.

452
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,927
问吧！凯利
Go ahead, Kiley.

453
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:20,461
他们可能是计划这么做的 以便误导我们
They could be plants put in the front lines to mislead us.

454
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:24,260
我要单独和你谈谈，凯利
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

455
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:27,701
护送这些战俘接受适当的侦讯
Escort these prisoners to the rear for proper interrogation.

456
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:29,635
是的，长官，把他们带出去
Yes, sir. Move them out.

457
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,436
- 好了、我们走、走！  - 出发！
- Let's go, move it out.  - Go!

458
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:36,039
长官 所有的战俘都带着橡胶管
These prisoners were carrying these rubber hoses.

459
00:45:36,215 --> 00:45:38,546
一起送去 及任何他们带的东西
Send them along, and anything else you found.

460
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:40,910
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

461
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:47,924
你事实上仍然想着 德军在准备一次主要的攻击
Do you actually still think the Germans are preparing a major offensive?

462
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:50,485
是的，长官，上校，我认为
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

463
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:54,327
你是说你所抓到的那些孩子 只是替换调到后方整编
You mean those kids are replacements for more seasoned troops...

464
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,560
预备较大攻击之精锐部队的人
...sent to the rear to re-form for the big attack?

465
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,967
是的，长官，上校，我认为
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

466
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:04,874
凯利，你疯了 事实对你没有任何意义 证据对你没有任何意义
Kiley, you're crazy. Facts mean nothing to you. Evidence means nothing.

467
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:08,536
唯一对你是重要的是 你的烂预感
The only thing you can see are your own cockeyed hunches.

468
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:11,241
但那在军中是没用的
Well, that doesn't work in the Army.

469
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:15,546
我推荐你调到华府去坐办公桌
I'm recommending you for transfer to a desk in Washington.

470
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:22,151
你可以告诉总统 要如何打这场仗
You can tell the president how to run the war.

471
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,569
少校
Major.

472
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:47,982
你与我妻子一样不会泡咖啡
You make coffee as bad as my wife.

473
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:53,024
她总是告诉我 我不能在军队里好好生活
She always told me I'd never get along in the Army.

474
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:58,763
我在警察局里从未那么轻松
I never had it so easy in the police force.

475
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:05,662
我错了很多次
I've just been counting up how many times I've been wrong.

476
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:08,434
但这次绝对不会错
But never this wrong.

477
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:12,339
所有迹象指明一点
All the signs point to only one thing.

478
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:16,109
或许他们有别的企图吗？
Is it possible they mean something else?

479
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:22,520
或许我无法胜任这次战争又或许上校是对的
Maybe this war is beyond me and maybe Colonel Pritchard's right.

480
00:47:22,691 --> 00:47:25,524
从总部来的，给你的
Runner brought this from headquarters. It's for you.

481
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:27,058
打开
Open it.

482
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:37,572
是德军上校和他的记录照片
Well, it's a picture of a Kraut colonel and his service record.

483
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:40,208
是我要的
I wanted that.

484
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:49,516
这个也是，坦克指挥官，五次作战纪录
Well, there it is again. Panzer officer. Fine fighting record.

485
00:47:49,686 --> 00:47:53,052
最后一次是在苏联前线指挥坦克团
Last reported in the Russian front commanding a tank regiment.

486
00:47:53,223 --> 00:47:54,985
他在干吗？
What's he doing here?

487
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:57,523
证明了我的观点
I'd say that proves my point.

488
00:47:57,694 --> 00:48:03,655
他在苏联打了败仗之后就被解职了
Colonel Pritchard would probably say he got fired for losing the war in Russia.

489
00:48:04,602 --> 00:48:08,401
我不知道，你觉得呢？
I don't know. What do you think?

490
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:14,732
长官，我是在正规军队我没与上校们打交道
Well, sir. I'm regular Army. I don't get into beefs between colonels.

491
00:48:15,578 --> 00:48:19,775
但我可以告诉你一些狂人的想法
But I'll tell you what some of my stir-crazy men think.

492
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:23,180
他们认为我们在此有很大机会
They think we got a great opportunity here.

493
00:48:23,354 --> 00:48:26,516
我们有机会横扫德国
We got a chance to wipe out Germany.

494
00:48:26,691 --> 00:48:30,786
从地图上横扫，销毁一切
Just wipe it clean off the map. Knock everything down...

495
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:32,358
每座城市
...every city...

496
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,056
每个城堡，每座桥梁每条道路，一切
...every castle, all the bridges, all the roads. Everything.

497
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:41,067
别留下两块放在一起的石头把表面扫干净
Don't leave two stones standing together. Just wipe the slate clean.

498
00:48:41,238 --> 00:48:44,570
把德国变成大草原然后运些水牛过来
Turn Germany into a prairie, then ship over a few buffalo...

499
00:48:44,742 --> 00:48:46,766
让他们开始抓爬
...and let them start from scratch.

500
00:48:46,945 --> 00:48:49,640
你觉得如何，上校？
Now, what do you think of that, colonel?

501
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:59,455
我觉得你们那些人需要洗洗袜子，刮刮胡子，太臭了
I think your men ought to wash their socks and take a shave. It stinks in here.

502
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:33,883
（德文）

503
00:49:37,195 --> 00:49:40,163
- 说英文，只准说英文  - 是的，少尉
- Speak English. Only English.  - Okay, lieutenant.

504
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:43,199
让我们把这些东西弄离开这里
Let's get this stuff out of here.

505
00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:01,046
空军呼叫OB！空军呼叫OB

506
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,552
特遣队空降敌线之后
Operation Transit parachuted behind enemy lines.

507
00:50:04,724 --> 00:50:09,854
重复:特遣队空降敌线之后
Repeat. Operation Transit parachuted behind enemy lines.

508
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:11,343
十，九，八，七，六

509
00:51:12,325 --> 00:51:16,284
五，四，三，二，一

510
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:20,433
零

511
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:24,697
是什…
What the...?

512
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:26,961
那是什么声音？
What's that noise?

513
00:52:27,138 --> 00:52:29,002
起来，大家都到外面来
On your feet! Everybody out!

514
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:33,198
- 听起来像是有几千辆  - 查理！接通营部
- Sounds like a thousand of them.  - Hey, Charlie, get battalion.

515
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:35,969
- 接营部  - 快点！快点！
- Get battalion.  - On the double! On the double!

516
00:52:36,846 --> 00:52:39,814
上士！叫大家都出来
Sergeant, haul everybody out.

517
00:52:39,984 --> 00:52:43,441
- 大家都出来  - 各排长向我报到
- Everybody out. Come on.  - Bazooka men, report to me.

518
00:52:45,856 --> 00:52:48,016
线路不通，长官
The line's dead, sir.

519
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:51,992
走…走！
Go! Go! Go!

520
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,040
那是什么？
What's that?

521
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:10,510
那是什么？ 你想看德国人，对吧
"What's that?" And you wanted to see Germans, right?

522
00:53:10,682 --> 00:53:13,515
到外面去，快点
Come on! On the double!

523
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:16,550
快点
On the double!

524
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:22,588
调头！调头！我们走！ 我们走…我们走！
Turn them over! Turn them over! Let's go! Let's go!

525
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,352

拿着！ 你要这么做！
Here, you do it this way.

536
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:09,162
菜鸟！从未看过战争场面 你还能期待什么？
They're green, never seen action before. What do you expect?

537
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:21,876
上士 没有命令没有人能够动
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here. Nobody moves without orders.

538
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,641
是的，长官

539
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:28,680
你会发现多一个人在这 不会有任何差别的
Stay here. One more man won't make a difference.

540
00:55:28,857 --> 00:55:32,815

受到轻微抵抗
Meeting weak resistance.

543
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,416

Take cover! Make a stand. Take cover! Make a stand.

544
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,788
设法抵挡

545
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,713
填弹！

546
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:02,283
我说填弹！
I said, load!

547
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:23,634
老虎对104号坦克 104号坦克，你挡住路了
Tiger to Tank 104. Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

等一下
Wait a minute.

00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:41,481
你会需要这个
You're gonna need this.

00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,683
带着那冲锋枪

104号坦克，立刻回答

555
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:37,242
我是海斯勒上校

556
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,615
关顶盖

557
00:58:45,425 --> 00:58:46,915
虎型坦克在11点方向
Tigers at 11 o'clock.

558
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:56,528
干掉他们！艾迪
Hit them hard, Eddie.

559
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:17,787
他们干掉布朗迪了
They got Blondie.

560
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:27,867
算了 就像是用网球打它们
Forget it. It's like hitting them with tennis balls.

561
00:59:33,675 --> 00:59:35,869
我们离开这里！
Come on, let's get out of here!

562
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:40,745
保持低姿势
Get down and stay down.

563
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:52,556
笨蛋！用爬的
Crawl, you dummy! Crawl.

564
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,492
少尉，继续拿枪榴弹来
Lieutenant, keep those grenades coming.

565
01:00:05,107 --> 01:00:07,734
撤退！
Fall back!

566
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,772
撤退！
Fall back!

567
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:23,257

569
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:29,462
趴下！
Get down.

570
01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:51,244
保持低姿势！保持低姿势！
Get going. Stay low.

571
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,092
海斯勒呼叫总部
Hessler to headquarters.

572
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:32,059
抵抗非常的轻微
Resistance very weak.

573
01:01:33,734 --> 01:01:35,395
南方前线报告
Southern front reporting.

574
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:38,469
海斯勒指挥官遭到轻微的抵抗

575
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,234
敌人正越过K1O河退却中

576
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:44,842
- 少尉 我们离开这里  - 来个人协助操作这挺机枪
- Let's get out of here.  - Hey, somebody man this gun!

577
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:47,707
- 他们来了  - 射击！他们来了
- Here they come!  - There they are!

578
01:03:06,769 --> 01:03:08,998
拿弹带来
Give me a belt!

579
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:31,854
等等我！
Hey, wait for me!

580
01:03:35,868 --> 01:03:37,926
抓住车边
Grab the tailgate!

581
01:03:40,273 --> 01:03:41,967
等等我！
Wait for me!

582
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:50,872
- 你的车辆调度场在那？  - 在团里，离此地四公里
- Where's your motor pool?  - At regiment, four kilometers.

583
01:03:51,052 --> 01:03:53,816
我们到那去，我得赶回师部
Let's get there. I gotta get back to headquarters.

584
01:03:54,689 --> 01:03:56,315
- 等等我  - 慢一点
- Wait for me!  - Hold it a minute!

585
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:58,049
等等我
Wait for me!

586
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,768
我们没机会了
We haven't got a chance.

587
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:44,636
放松
Relax. Stay loose.

588
01:04:45,878 --> 01:04:48,675
你认为我们得投降？
You think we'll have to surrender?

589
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:52,542
我听说他们对待美国俘虏很好
Well, I hear they treat American prisoners real well.

590
01:04:52,753 --> 01:04:55,744
在战斗中，他们对谁都不好
In a big battle, they treat nobody real well.

591
01:04:56,189 --> 01:04:59,555
有一条后路
Come on. There's a back road that leads to the motor pool.

592
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:02,996
- 或许我们能得到一辆吉普  - 你如何知道？
- Maybe we can get us a jeep.  - How do you know?

593
01:05:03,163 --> 01:05:05,996
因为我来此之前研究过地图
Because I studied the maps when we arrived here.

594
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:08,691
就如你该做的
Just like you should've done.

595
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:16,377
- 若我们走入线内呢？  - 我们仍在他们前头
- What if we run into their lines?  - We're still ahead of them.

596
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,480
- 他们可能有高级巡逻队  - 要保住性命真麻烦
- They might have advanced patrols.  - It's enough trouble keeping alive...

597
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,844
在这种混乱的形势下
...in this mess without you bellyaching.

598
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,318
若你想投降，尽管去 我一个人轻松一点
If you wanna surrender, go ahead. I'll make it easier alone.

599
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,888
你出线了
You're out of line, sergeant.

600
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:32,017
对不起，中尉
Sorry, lieutenant.

601
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:36,495
我不需要你的帮助 你自己前进
Look, I don't need help from you. You wanna go on by yourself, go ahead.

602
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:43,470
你来吗？ 我要背你吗？
Are you coming, or am I gonna have to carry you?

603
01:06:02,862 --> 01:06:04,523
哈，夏安
Hello, Cheyenne.

604
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:06,562
什么？ 你被攻击了
What's that? You're under attack?

605
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:08,427
什么样的兵力？
In what strength?

606
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,431
那你推测呢？
Well, what's your guess?

607
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:13,333
我不能给你空中侦察 气候太差,无法侦查!
I can't give you air reconnaissance, I'm blind.

608
01:06:13,507 --> 01:06:15,497
- 接“阿帕奇”  - 呼叫“阿帕奇”
- Get Apache.  - Call Apache.

609
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,034
哈，艾迪，你那区如何？
Eddie, what's going on in your sector?

610
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:20,577
只有巡逻队的接战 有多强大？
It's only patrol action. How heavy?

611
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:23,910
你的侦察部队怎么说？ 没有任何大规模的
Well, what does your reconnaissance say? Nothing heavy.

612
01:06:24,086 --> 01:06:26,680
我不知道，正试着了解全盘 保持联络
We're trying to get a picture. Stay on task.

613
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:56,618
我们的第一阶段进攻取得了成功。
The first phase of our offensive was a success.

614
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,079
奇袭的效果完成了
The element of surprise was complete.

615
01:06:59,257 --> 01:07:02,090
美军的通信有如在矿坑一般
American communications are in a turmoil.

616
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,285
但我们得在美军了解 我们是全面攻击之前
We must cross the Our River before the enemy realizes...

617
01:07:05,463 --> 01:07:08,329
先占领瓦尔桥
...we have launched an all-out offensive.

618
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:13,995
我相信我没准许你抽烟！
I do not believe I gave you permission to smoke.

619
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:16,002
抱歉，长官
Sorry, sir.

620
01:07:17,477 --> 01:07:21,140
我们没能有时间相处 非常的不幸
Unfortunately, we did not have time to get better acquainted...

621
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:24,614
但你们全都了解我的名声
...but all of you know my reputation.

622
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,717
我的部队永远是有最多的死伤
My command always suffers the highest casualties.

623
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:34,117
胜利的代价从来不便宜
The price of victory is never cheap.

624
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:38,460
这次的战役我们会像我们的坦克一般的坚硬！
In this battle, we will be as hard as our tanks.

625
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:42,093
我会完成派给我的任务
I will reach the objectives assigned to me...

626
01:07:42,273 --> 01:07:44,103
不计一切的代价！
...no matter what the cost.

627
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:47,671
总部来的电讯，指挥官
Signal from headquarters, colonel.

628
01:07:50,514 --> 01:07:52,208
海斯勒，我恭喜你！
Hessler, I congratulate you.

629
01:07:52,384 --> 01:07:55,683
- 你依照着计划的时间  - 我会如同计划的到达鲁尔桥
- You're on schedule.  - I will reach the Our River as planned.

630
01:07:55,854 --> 01:07:59,016
但一定不能让敌人炸毁那座桥
But the enemy must not be permitted to destroy the bridge.

631
01:07:59,191 --> 01:08:01,955
- 特遣队占领了它没有？  - 还没有
- Has Schumacher seized it yet?  - Not yet.

632
01:08:02,127 --> 01:08:06,153
特遣队首要的任务是破坏敌人的通信
Schumacher's primary assignment is to disrupt enemy communications.

633
01:08:06,631 --> 01:08:09,064
我必须要为我的坦克巩固那座桥的安全
I must have that bridge secured for my tanks.

634
01:08:09,268 --> 01:08:11,201
我没有时间架桥
I have no time to build bridges.

635
01:08:13,407 --> 01:08:17,672
海斯勒 你的桥会确保安全的
Hessler, your bridge will be secured.

636
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,404
我们期待根据 你时间表经过它！
We are expecting you to cross it according to the schedule.

637
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:27,878
你们晓得我们前进的路线？ 配合地图研究吧？
You know your line of march. Coordinate with the map.

638
01:08:32,994 --> 01:08:36,360
康拉德！我头痛！
Conrad, I have a headache.

639
01:08:52,815 --> 01:08:54,441
着火了 着火了 
Fire! Fire!

640
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:13,463
地雷？ 它们为何没被清除掉？
Land mines! Why were they not cleared?

641
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:15,731
带地雷侦测器的人呢？
Where are the men with mine detectors?

642
01:09:15,908 --> 01:09:17,431
我们前进的太快，
We are moving too fast.

643
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:19,576
他们跟不上
The men are following in trucks.

644
01:09:19,745 --> 01:09:21,235
他们全死了
They are all dead.

645
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:24,349
地雷在他们底下爆炸
The mine exploded directly under them.

646
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:27,250
叫副连长接管，告诉他们
Notify their seconds-in-command to take over.

647
01:09:27,421 --> 01:09:29,980
我对他们有绝对的信心！
Tell them I have absolute confidence in them.

648
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,448
我们不必要的损失了坦克
We have lost a tank unnecessarily.

649
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,924
我们不必要的损失了 宝贵的时间
We've lost precious minutes unnecessarily.

650
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:37,563
你有责任要保护这型坦克
Your troops were here to protect the panzers.

651
01:09:37,731 --> 01:09:40,130
从现在起到我们清理完 这地雷区
From now on, until we clear this minefield...

652
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:43,429
你的人要走在我的坦车之前
...your men will go ahead of my tanks.

653
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:47,740
而且立刻修好我的指挥车！
And have my vehicle repaired at once!

654
01:10:01,124 --> 01:10:03,455
快点！继续走！跟上去
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

655
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:13,469
现在！听我说！你们全部！
Now, listen to me, all of you.

656
01:10:13,637 --> 01:10:16,299
我需要准确的情报
I need precise information:

657
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:19,032
有多少人，敌人投入这次攻击
How many men, how many guns...

658
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:21,974
多少大炮，多少坦克
...how many tanks the enemy are throwing into this.

659
01:10:22,147 --> 01:10:25,047
他们有多少燃料携行？ 而且查清楚
How much fuel are they carrying? And get a move on.

660
01:10:25,216 --> 01:10:28,946
在我们大叫救命前有24小时
We've got 24 hours before we scream rape.

661
01:10:30,489 --> 01:10:32,718
好了，凯利！轮到你了
All right, Kiley, it's your turn.

662
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:35,289
他们突破而过，将军
They're pouring through, general.

663
01:10:35,462 --> 01:10:37,486
精锐的部队，全新的装备
Crack troops. Brand-new equipment.

664
01:10:37,664 --> 01:10:41,565
我看了他们坦克的内部 我们现有装备无法与之匹敌！
I looked inside one of their tanks. They can chew up anything we've got.

665
01:10:41,735 --> 01:10:45,569
- 问题是，他们要去哪里？  - 你有那情报？ 凯利
- Question is, where are they going?  - Do you have that information?

666
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,639
没有，长官，但是他有 海斯勒上校
No, but he does. Colonel Hessler...

667
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:50,366
我发现他是坦克的指挥官
...the commanding officer of the panzer spearhead.

668
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:52,305
当我们知道他去那时
When we know where he's going...

669
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,971
我们就知道整个 德军攻击的目标
...we'll know the objective of the attack.

670
01:10:55,149 --> 01:10:58,709
敌军在85哩前线中 突破了五处
The enemy is probing at five points along an 85-mile front.

671
01:10:58,886 --> 01:11:01,354
在只有那些情报能分析处理下
With only that information at our disposal...

672
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:04,855
你如何能说海斯勒的旅是前锋
...how can you assume Hessler's column is the spearhead?

673
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:07,188
- 法律的可能性？ 凯利  - 不，长官 
- The law of probability, Kiley?  - No, sir.

674
01:11:07,362 --> 01:11:09,352
法律的可能性反对我
The law of probability is against me.

675
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:13,865
但是既然没有其他的情报 我有五分之一的机会是对的
But in the absence of other information, I've one chance in five of being right.

676
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,334
- 而我想赌赌那个机会  - 怎么做
- I'd like to explore that chance.  - How?

677
01:11:17,508 --> 01:11:19,338
- 这个，长官  - 我告诉你怎么做
- Well, sir...  - I'll tell you how.

678
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,840
看着瓦尔河
Watch the Our River.

679
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:24,571
只有在这里的一座桥 能支持重型坦克
There's only one bridge, right here, that can support heavy tanks.

680
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:28,514
我说那是海斯勒要去的地方 也是我要去的地方
I'd say that's where Hessler will be, and that's where I'll be.

681
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,519
凯利！ 别太接近那座桥 我下令炸掉它
Don't get too close to that bridge. I've ordered it blown up.

682
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:35,852
能知道太好了，谢谢你的消息
That's a good thing to know. Thanks for the tip.

683
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:43,366
继续走…继续走！ 快点！继续走！ 
Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Go on, keep moving.

684
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:46,736
快点！我们走 继续走！
Come on, let's go. You there, keep moving.

685
01:11:46,908 --> 01:11:48,875
-快点！我们走！  - 快点！ 
- Come on, let's go.  - Come on.

686
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,711
快点！快点！我们走！
Come on. Come on, let's go.

687
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,787
我们走！你还在等什么？
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

688
01:12:06,228 --> 01:12:09,128
快点！继续走！ 快点！我们走！ 
Move it. Come on, keep moving. Step on it. Get going.

689
01:12:09,298 --> 01:12:12,266
好了！快走！跟上前面的
Come on, let's get going. Step on it.

690
01:12:15,281 --> 01:12:16,941
（安不列芙…36公里）

691
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,407
你停下来干什么？
Hey, what are you stopping for?

692
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:22,067
那个路标 我们以前也走过呀！
That sign. When we came through before...

693
01:12:22,246 --> 01:12:26,272
- 我记得安不列芙是往那条路走  - 你们挡住路了，快走！
- ...I recall Ambleve was that way.  - You're blocking the road. Get going.

694
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,280
- 快点！  - 来吧！我们走
- Hurry up.  - Come on, let's go.

695
01:12:28,486 --> 01:12:32,149
且慢 我告诉你那路标方向错了
Wait a minute. I tell you, those signs point in the wrong direction.

696
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:34,347
是什么阻挡了这次的行进？
What's holding up the parade here?

697
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,755
有人对路标做了手脚，少尉
Somebody's been monkeying around with those road signs.

698
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:40,089
那不是去安不列芙的路
That ain't the road to Ambleve.

699
01:12:40,766 --> 01:12:43,097
两小时前我由安不列芙来
Two hours ago, I came here from Ambleve...

700
01:12:43,269 --> 01:12:44,963
走的是一模一样的路
...over this exact same road.

701
01:12:45,137 --> 01:12:47,970
也许他们同时把 安不列芙移动了
Now, maybe they've moved Ambleve in the meantime...

702
01:12:48,141 --> 01:12:50,540
但两小时前这是去那的路
...but two hours ago this was the road to it.

703
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:53,474
- 走吧！杜金  - 少尉，我在告诉你…
- Take off, Duquesne.  - Lieutenant, I'm telling you...

704
01:12:53,647 --> 01:12:57,104
少尉！叫你的上士 把吉普车开走好吗？
Lieutenant, tell your sergeant to get this jeep out of here.

705
01:12:57,283 --> 01:13:00,582
走！这是命令！走！
Move. That's an order. Move.

706
01:13:05,192 --> 01:13:08,320
是，希望他在美乐地玩的愉快
Yeah, I hope they enjoy themselves in Malmedy.

707
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:14,701
- 来吧！我们在这下车  - 等一下 
- Come on. We're getting off here.  - Wait.

708
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,632
来吧！
Come on!

709
01:13:17,672 --> 01:13:19,195
跳
Jump.

710
01:13:23,145 --> 01:13:25,078
等一下，等一下，我们去那？
Hey, wait a minute. Where we going?

711
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:27,215
我们应该到安不列芙去的 你晓得我们的营部在那
We're supposed to be in Ambleve.

712
01:13:27,383 --> 01:13:29,907
闭嘴！我们会到那的 我们得先去取点货 
We'll get there. I gotta make a pickup first.

713
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,917
- 取货？取哪类的货  - 我在路旁的农舍放了一些货
- Pickup?  - I got some merchandise in a farmhouse.

714
01:13:33,123 --> 01:13:36,558
但德军要来了 他们会偷走它的 你得来帮帮我，来吧！
Germans are coming. They'll steal it. You gotta give me a hand.

715
01:13:36,727 --> 01:13:38,887
你们两个
Hey, you two!

716
01:13:40,865 --> 01:13:43,629
快点！继续走，跟着前面的
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

717
01:13:58,784 --> 01:14:01,252
你是最后一辆了吗？ 你后面有任何人吗？
Are you the last one? Anybody behind you?

718
01:14:01,421 --> 01:14:04,583
有，整个德军！走吧！
Yeah, the whole German army. Go ahead.

719
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:10,457
你！继续走！快点！ 跟着前面的
You there, keep them moving. Come on, step on it.

720
01:14:15,169 --> 01:14:18,797
通知坦克，桥安然无恙
Notify the panzers. The bridge is intact.

721
01:14:18,989 --> 01:14:22,889
呼叫，呼叫，桥安然无恙

722
01:14:23,728 --> 01:14:26,695
桥安然无恙

723
01:14:34,689 --> 01:14:37,657
- 有德军的踪影吗？  - 还没有
- Any sign of the Germans?  - No, not yet.

724
01:14:37,827 --> 01:14:41,318
- 你们到这来干什么  - 我们奉令炸桥，
- What are you men doing here?  - We got orders to blow the bridge.

725
01:14:41,497 --> 01:14:43,225
- 下车  - 等一下，中尉
- Pile out.  - Wait a minute.

726
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,560
桥已经在装炸药了
That job's being done.

727
01:14:56,481 --> 01:14:58,072
你们弄的怎么样了
How you boys making out?

728
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:01,240
- 快弄好了  - 快一点，好吗？
- Just about finished.  - Hurry up, will you?

729
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:03,852
你们最好在德军来之前 离开这里
Get out of here before those Krauts get here.

730
01:15:04,023 --> 01:15:06,422
- 你们需要帮忙吗？  - 我有个好主意
- You need any help?  - I got a good idea.

731
01:15:06,592 --> 01:15:12,154
我们把所有的热水瓶给他们 那些水刚由冰上收集的
We'll give them all a hot-water bottle. That water comes straight off the ice.

732
01:15:12,331 --> 01:15:14,993
我有一车的C4炸药 需要用吗？
Well, I'm sure loaded with C-4. Can you use any?

733
01:15:15,168 --> 01:15:17,863
我想我能卖一些给你
I imagine they could sell you some.

734
01:15:19,305 --> 01:15:20,999
开车
Climb in.

735
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:30,976
你接引爆器的电线 是谁给你们的
Hey, why do you got your wires hooked on to that detonator?

736
01:15:33,754 --> 01:15:38,213
- 我想他太快...  - 去送命吗？ 不是那种方法
- I guess he's in a hurry.  - To get killed? That's not the way.

737
01:15:38,393 --> 01:15:40,019
中士，带几个你的人
Sarge, bring a couple of men.

738
01:15:40,196 --> 01:15:43,131
我们要去看看那座桥的底下
We're gonna take a look under that bridge.

739
01:15:58,249 --> 01:16:00,307
这不是去安不列芙的路 这是去美乐地的路
This ain't the road to Ambleve.

740
01:16:00,485 --> 01:16:01,883
路标是这么说的
That's what the sign says.

741
01:16:02,053 --> 01:16:05,385
路标说是那条路 地图说是这条
The sign says thataway, the map says Ambleve was this way.

742
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:08,184
有人的工作没做好
Will somebody straighten this out?

743
01:16:10,562 --> 01:16:13,359
安不列芙，安不列芙
Ambleve. Ambleve.

744
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:20,160
- 乌兰斯基  - 中校
- Hey, Wolenski.  - Oh, colonel.

745
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:23,037
路在这弄不清楚了
Hey, we're all fouled up here.

746
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:27,111
我们奉命到安不列芙去 但地图和路标不一样
We've been ordered to Ambleve, but the maps don't jibe with the signs.

747
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:30,510
你开始就走错路了 这是去美乐地的路
How'd you get off the road? This will take you to Malmedy.

748
01:16:30,684 --> 01:16:32,708
- 安不列芙是那一条  - 那条路？ 
- Ambleve's that way.  - That way?

749
01:16:32,886 --> 01:16:35,719
我们一直跟着路标在走
We've been following these road signs the whole way.

750
01:16:35,889 --> 01:16:39,915
而且我们遇到的宪兵 也指挥我们走这条路
And the MPs we ran into, they've been directing us this way.

751
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,424
它们改过了，被人调换过了
They've been changed. They switched them around.

752
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,567
你遇到的那些宪兵看起来没有问题吧
Those MPs you ran into seem okay?

753
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:49,931
- 此话怎讲  - 他们有任何怪异的地方吗？
- What do you mean?  - Anything odd about them?

754
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,436
只是普通的大兵
Just regular Gls.

755
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,573
我们几天前截到敌人的情报
We intercepted an enemy dispatch.

756
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:56,438
他们在招募说英文的德军
They were recruiting English-speaking Germans.

757
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:59,308
你什么时候度过瓦尔桥的
What time did you cross the Our River?

758
01:16:59,483 --> 01:17:02,782
八点40分 我们是最后一辆车 我听他们说要炸桥
8:40. We were last ones across. They were set to blow it.

759
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:05,044
- 你看到桥被炸掉？  - 没
- You see the bridge blown?  - No.

760
01:17:05,222 --> 01:17:07,951
但我看到工兵在装炸药
But I saw the engineers setting the charges.

761
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:14,256
等一等，怎么回事 他们不是工兵，是宪兵
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell? They weren't engineers, they were MPs.

762
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:18,399
墨菲，给我接师部
Murphy, get me headquarters.

763
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:21,629
少校，叫人把路标换回来
And, major, have someone switch that sign back.

764
01:17:21,807 --> 01:17:24,571
红河六号，请回答，红河六号
Red River Six. Come in, Red River Six.

765
01:17:24,743 --> 01:17:28,906
- 请讲话，红河二号  - 红河六号，这是红河二号
- Come in, Red River Two.  - Red River Six, this is Red River Two.

766
01:17:29,082 --> 01:17:33,678
德军扮成美军宪兵 控制了瓦尔桥
Germans uniformed as American MPs holding Our River Bridge.

767
01:17:33,886 --> 01:17:36,354
桥没有被炸掉
Bridge has not been blown.

768
01:17:36,522 --> 01:17:39,923
重覆，德军扮成 美军宪兵
Repeat. Germans uniformed as American MPs...

769
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:44,189
控制瓦尔桥 桥没有被炸掉
...holding Our River Bridge. Bridge has not been blown.

770
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:47,333
通话完毕 我们走
Over and out. Let's go.

771
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,178
停下来，杰克
Better hold it, Jack.

772
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:12,991
- 发生了什么事  - 他们遭遇了德军巡逻队的战斗
- What happened?  - They ran into a firefight. German patrol.

773
01:18:13,129 --> 01:18:14,686
我没看到任何德国人
I don't see any Germans.

774
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:18,166
他们在河里，他们没渡过来
They're in the river. They didn't make it across.

775
01:18:18,336 --> 01:18:20,565
快离开这，要炸桥了
Get out of here. We're blowing the bridge.

776
01:18:21,372 --> 01:18:24,067
什么？你确定吗？
What? Are you sure?

777
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,565
小心，宪兵是伪装的
Watch out, the MPs are Krauts!

778
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,597
我的天，下来
Oh, my God! Get down!

779
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:29,003
我们在等什么？ 把那坦克弄走
Why are we waiting? Get that tank out of the way.

780
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,610
我们现在预备拖走了，长官
We are preparing to tow it off now, sir.

781
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:36,918
老虎对豹营前锋 把那坦克由桥上轰掉
Tiger to tanks Leopard and Panther. Blast that tank off the bridge.

782
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,997
是总部，上校
It's headquarters, colonel.

783
01:19:55,175 --> 01:19:57,608
科勒将军说我们时间落后了
General Kohler says we are behind schedule.

784
01:19:57,979 --> 01:20:00,674
他要知道是什么拖延我们了
He wants to know what's holding us up.

785
01:20:00,848 --> 01:20:06,410
告诉将军 美军学会了如何撤退
Tell the general the Americans are learning how to retreat.

786
01:20:06,588 --> 01:20:13,187
老虎对豹营 上桥把那废物推开
Tiger to Panther. Get onto the bridge, push that junk right out of the way.

787
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:50,827
保持低姿势
Stay down.

788
01:21:03,884 --> 01:21:08,320
墨菲 通知师部瓦尔桥没被炸掉
Murphy, call headquarters. Tell them the Our River Bridge hasn't been blown.

789
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:11,547
- 敌军大部队正在通过  - 是的，长官
- The enemy's crossing in great strength.  - Yes, sir.

790
01:21:23,205 --> 01:21:26,571
- 把步枪给我  - 你需要的是大炮，长官
- Let me have your rifle.  - What you need is a cannon, sir.

791
01:21:26,742 --> 01:21:30,734
我上次看到那德军时 我有的只是架照相机
The last time I saw that German, all I had was a camera.

792
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,393
你不能快一点吗？ 上士 我们快跟不上部队了
Can't you hurry it up, sergeant? We lost the column.

793
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:21,465
你凑巧在口袋里 有个新化油器吗？ 少尉
Do you happen to have a new carburetor in your pocket, lieutenant?

794
01:22:22,503 --> 01:22:24,630
你是说我们卡在这了
You mean we're stuck here?

795
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:30,503
不，我们还可以用走的
Nope. We can still walk.

796
01:22:33,314 --> 01:22:35,247
我们走
Let's go.

797
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:40,709
- 也许我们能搭便车  - 站住
- Hey, maybe we can get a lift, huh?  - Hold it.

798
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:46,750
我们最好先弄清楚他们是谁
We better find out just who they are first.

799
01:22:52,602 --> 01:22:54,159
头低下
Down.

800
01:23:00,244 --> 01:23:02,371
是德国人，退后
Yeah, Krauts. Back.

801
01:23:41,722 --> 01:23:44,713
若是你能放轻松点 我能把他们全干掉的
If you'd just stayed loose, I could've gotten them all.

802
01:24:04,549 --> 01:24:08,849
美军退却中 我军在所有的前线都节节胜利
Americans in headlong retreat. Our forces are advancing on all fronts.

803
01:24:10,221 --> 01:24:12,552
俘获许多的战俘
Great numbers of prisoners are being taken.

804
01:25:12,923 --> 01:25:15,517
我对这件事有不良的预感
I got a bad feeling about this.

805
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,753
你想脱逃，为何不跑呢
If you wanted to make a run for it, why didn't you?

806
01:25:19,898 --> 01:25:22,331
我是你的排副，少尉
I'm in your outfit, lieutenant.

807
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,401
我的职责是照顾你 到你去的地方去
My job is to look out for you, go where you go.

808
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,772
这一次的确把你弄到 错误的地方
I sure got you into the wrong place this time.

809
01:25:34,313 --> 01:25:36,804
我…我很高兴你和我在一起
But I'm glad you're with me.

810
01:25:38,819 --> 01:25:43,482
当我们到达战俘营时会被分开
When we get to the POW camp, they'll separate us...

811
01:25:43,657 --> 01:25:45,419
你会到军官区的
...you being an officer.

812
01:25:47,527 --> 01:25:49,494
是的
Yeah.

813
01:25:51,132 --> 01:25:53,190
我会想念你的，上士
I'm gonna miss you, sergeant.

814
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:15,980
跑
Run!

815
01:26:34,345 --> 01:26:36,073
继续跑
Keep going!

816
01:27:37,678 --> 01:27:39,838
继续走，快点，快点
Get going. Come on, step on it.

817
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:58,529
- 露易丝在这吗？  - 不在
- Is she here?  - No.

818
01:27:58,701 --> 01:28:00,634
那么告诉她我回来了，好吗？
Well, tell her I'm back, huh?

819
01:28:10,781 --> 01:28:14,944
我要你们去把本部队的人全都能找出来
I want you all to fan out. Round up every man that belongs to this outfit.

820
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,849
我们十分钟后在这里集合 快点去
We will assemble here in 10 minutes. On the double.

821
01:28:18,023 --> 01:28:19,284
我们走
Let's go.

822
01:28:31,704 --> 01:28:33,068
这是什么
What's all this?

823
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,538
看起来像什么？ 我作生意的地方
What's it look like? My place of business.

824
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:43,546
- 这些鸡是干什么的  - 它们生蛋
- What are the chickens for?  - They lay eggs.

825
01:28:43,717 --> 01:28:46,208
你知道现在新鲜鸡蛋 是什么价钱
Any idea what fresh eggs brings in these days?

826
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:48,615
太美了，太美了
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

827
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,515
去开门，那是我的拍档
All right, open the door, that's my partner.

828
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:02,401
听着 查清楚我们的战车停在那
Look, run down to the tank park and check us both in.

829
01:29:02,571 --> 01:29:05,198
- 但…  - 何时出发 然后再来找我，去吧
- But...  - And then report back to me. Go ahead.

830
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:09,410
这些鸡看起好瘦 你有按时喂吗？
The chickens look scrawny. Have you been feeding them regular?

831
01:29:09,579 --> 01:29:11,069
我在担心你
I was worried about you.

832
01:29:11,248 --> 01:29:14,239
- 德国人要来了是不是真的  - 是，正好经过这
- Is it true the Germans are coming?  - Right through here.

833
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:17,250
- 我们得赶快把一切都卖了  - 然后你就要走了
- We gotta sell everything, fast.  - Then you'll leave?

834
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:23,255
我们面对它吧 我们生意作不成了 一箱香槟360元
Face it, kid, we're out of business. One case of champagne, $360.

835
01:29:23,427 --> 01:29:29,127
两打玻璃丝袜80元 20瓶香水200元
Two dozen nylons, $80. Twenty bottles of perfume, $200.

836
01:29:29,301 --> 01:29:33,964
6百…40元 这是你那一半，
Six hundred and forty dollars. Here's your half.

837
01:29:34,172 --> 01:29:37,629
320元 你作了多少
Three hundred and twenty dollars. All right, what did you make?

838
01:29:37,809 --> 01:29:41,244
1230元，在这
One thousand, two hundred and thirty dollars. Here.

839
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:48,312
你在卖些什么？ 没看到卖多少货
What have you been selling? I don't see much stock gone.

840
01:29:48,489 --> 01:29:51,116
- 拿去  - 在我知道你是怎么挣的之前
- Take it.  - I won't until I know how you made it.

841
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:53,986
- 我不会拿的 你以为我是什么人  - 你以为我是什么人
- What do you think I am?  - What do you think I am?

842
01:29:55,295 --> 01:29:59,321
- 这些钱是我为我们存的  - 为我们？ 你在说些什么
- It's money I've saved for us.  - For us? What are you talking about?

843
01:30:00,401 --> 01:30:04,701
当一个女人 和一个男的合伙挣钱 她的意思是永远
When a woman goes in business with a man, it means forever.

844
01:30:04,906 --> 01:30:09,103
什么是永远？ 店关了，德军来了
What's forever? The shop is closed. The Germans are coming.

845
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:11,405
他们以前来这过
They've been here before.

846
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,479
我活过来了
I've lived through it.

847
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:16,311
我会再活过来的
I will live through it again.

848
01:30:22,225 --> 01:30:24,158
我会等你的
I will wait for you.

849
01:30:28,432 --> 01:30:31,833
你为何会对我有这种感觉 我碰都没碰过你
How can you feel this way about me? I never laid a hand on you.

850
01:30:32,036 --> 01:30:33,935
那就是原因
That's why.

851
01:30:34,505 --> 01:30:36,335
你爱上我了
You're in love with me.

852
01:30:39,945 --> 01:30:42,970
稍候，慢一点
Just a second. Hold the phone.

853
01:30:43,148 --> 01:30:44,876
等一等
Hold the phone, here.

854
01:30:45,951 --> 01:30:47,508
闭嘴
Shut up.

855
01:31:05,505 --> 01:31:07,472
你知道吗？
You know what?

856
01:31:07,641 --> 01:31:09,403
你是对的
You're right.

857
01:31:10,812 --> 01:31:12,403
这里
There.

858
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,515
所有的钱你保管 我得回去打仗
You hold all the money. I gotta go back in action.

859
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:17,843
你不晓得作战时是什么情况
You don't know what it's like in combat.

860
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:20,248
你知道，你中弹了 有人拿走你所有的钱 
You get shot, somebody takes your money.

861
01:31:20,422 --> 01:31:23,788
在卫生兵来到之前 那些人的手已伸进了你的口袋
Before the plasma comes, a guy's got his hand in your pocket.

862
01:31:24,326 --> 01:31:26,988
葛菲，葛菲
Guffy. Guffy.

863
01:31:28,297 --> 01:31:32,027
- 我不要你被杀  - 谁在说要被杀了？
- I don't want you to get killed.  - Who's talking about getting killed?

864
01:31:32,202 --> 01:31:33,759
你保管钱
You take care of the money.

865
01:31:33,937 --> 01:31:36,533
上士，坦克奉令后撤 来吧，我们得赶上它们
Sarge, the tanks aren't there. They've been pulled back. We gotta catch up.

866
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:39,596
葛菲
Guffy.

867
01:31:41,545 --> 01:31:43,512
回头见，拍档
So long, partner.

868
01:31:44,014 --> 01:31:45,344
保重
Take care of yourself.

869
01:31:45,517 --> 01:31:47,007
葛菲
Guffy.

870
01:31:51,022 --> 01:31:53,513
你不想吻我吗？
Don't you want to kiss me?

871
01:32:09,876 --> 01:32:13,606
别忘了喂鸡
Don't forget to feed the chickens, huh?

872
01:32:18,754 --> 01:32:21,813
继续走，我们走，继续走
Keep moving. Let's go, keep moving.

873
01:32:21,989 --> 01:32:26,152

Come on, sarge, we gotta catch up with the tanks. Let's go!

874

Goodbye, Louise!

875
01:32:32,367 --> 01:32:33,924
把那个放在那里面
Put that in there.

876
01:32:34,103 --> 01:32:36,765
快点，弄好它，弄好它
Come on, get to it. Get to it.

877
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:16,273

878
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:18,713

882
01:33:50,353 --> 01:33:55,346
- 死了，不见了 全不见了  - 中士，挡下那个人
- Dead. Gone. They're all gone.  - Sergeant, stop that man!

883
01:33:55,526 --> 01:33:58,585
他所做的我们正在做的别无二致
He's not doing anything we aren't.

884
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:20,551
我们留下
We're staying.

885
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:22,777
联络已经后撤的人
Countermand that order to fall back.

886
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:26,014
由现在此各部队就地抵抗
All units are to make a stand where they are and fight.

887
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:29,059
而那表示是每一个了 除了坦克
And that means everybody. Except tanks.

888
01:34:29,262 --> 01:34:32,230
文书，炊事兵，参谋

889
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:35,799
任何一个能拿枪使用的人
Anybody who can carry a rifle is to use it.

890
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:42,902
- 凯利  - 来吧，全都搬回来
- Kiley.  - Come on, bring it all in.

891
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:49,514
对我而言非常难以启齿 我错了
It's very difficult for me to say this. I was wrong.

892
01:34:58,094 --> 01:35:01,460
- 下车，中士，全都下车  - 全都下车
- Sergeant, haul them out again.  - Everybody out.

893
01:35:01,631 --> 01:35:03,929

894
01:35:04,801 --> 01:35:06,665
好了，中校 看来我们要留下了
Well, it looks like we're staying.

895
01:35:06,837 --> 01:35:09,896
- 当我需要把步枪时 你似乎从来都没有  - 拿我的去吧
- I never have a rifle when I need one.  - Take mine.

01:35:12,543 --> 01:35:15,443
- 我们走  - 我们走，快点，快点
- Let's go!  - Let's go. Come on.

898
01:35:17,916 --> 01:35:19,849
总部的电话，长官
We're on the line, sir.

899
01:35:20,051 --> 01:35:23,452
我是葛雷将军 布雷德莱
General Grey speaking. Fred.

900
01:35:23,621 --> 01:35:26,953
我守着安不列芙 但没有重武器我守不住
I'm holding at Ambleve, but I can't last without heavy stuff.

901
01:35:27,126 --> 01:35:28,990
你能给我什么
What can you let me have?

902
01:35:29,962 --> 01:35:33,921
155榴炮能挡的住 它们在哪？ 在平板车上 
155s will do the trick. Where are they? On flatcars.

903
01:35:34,099 --> 01:35:35,998
铁路还在我们手中？
Are we still holding the rail line?

904
01:35:36,169 --> 01:35:39,069
好，你何时能让它们到这里？
Good. Now, when can you get them here?

905
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:43,803
不是待会，佛列得，指望你了
Well, not later, Fred. We're counting on you.

906
01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:27,980
把那些拿上来
Bring that ammo up!

907
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:32,025
把那些东西拿来，堆在墙边

908
01:38:38,269 --> 01:38:40,293
把那些猪弄过来
Get some beef behind it.

909
01:38:40,871 --> 01:38:42,838
叫些人待在它后面
Hey, lay those logs in there.

910
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:51,280
我们走，往前去
Let's go! Let's move it out.

911
01:38:53,585 --> 01:38:56,485
第一排跟我走 第二排到那边去
First Platoon, follow me. Second Platoon, over there.

912
01:39:02,695 --> 01:39:04,525
射击
Fire.

913
01:39:34,307 --> 01:39:39,242
（圣诞快乐一美军进城了）

914
01:39:54,485 --> 01:39:56,384
士兵们
Soldier!

915
01:39:56,554 --> 01:39:58,111
往前去，往前去
Go! Go!

916
01:40:04,963 --> 01:40:06,657
大家都出去
Everybody out!

917
01:40:06,865 --> 01:40:09,765
- 等一等，等一等，你们要去哪  - 去防空壕去
- Wait a minute. Where you men going?  - To the shelter.

918
01:40:09,935 --> 01:40:13,392
- 不，你们不去 脱掉围裙拿步枪  - 但我们是炊事兵
- No, you're not. Grab your rifles.  - But we're cooks.

919
01:40:13,573 --> 01:40:16,872
午餐结束了，拿着步枪跟我来
Lunch is over. Get your rifles and follow me.

920
01:40:21,283 --> 01:40:23,945
- 小心砖头，离建筑物远一点  - 快点，士兵，到前面去
- Stay away from the buildings!  - Soldier, up front.

921
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:25,949
我是伞兵
I'm in the Air Corps.

922
01:40:26,121 --> 01:40:28,520
你现在是步兵了，跟我来
You're in the infantry now. Follow me.

923
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:34,353
我们打退他们了，他们在后撤
We're driving them back. They're running.

924
01:41:34,529 --> 01:41:36,257
这只是第一回合
This is only the first round.

925
01:42:11,303 --> 01:42:13,065
你为何停下来
Why have you stopped?

926
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:14,705
他们筑了工事，
They have dug in.

927
01:42:14,873 --> 01:42:17,602
- 很强的防御  - 绕过去
- It's a very strong defense.  - Bypass it.

928
01:42:17,776 --> 01:42:21,267
- 我考虑过那一点了  - 没什么好考虑的
- I have considered that.  - There's nothing to consider.

929
01:42:22,381 --> 01:42:27,647
我们必须衡量我们的得失
We must measure what we might gain by what we might lose.

930
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:31,122
来吧
Come on.

931
01:42:42,035 --> 01:42:45,595
在此刻你应该已经在 安不列芙以西十公里的地方了
You were to have been 10 kilometers west of Ambleve by this hour.

932
01:42:45,772 --> 01:42:47,102
你为何还在这里
Why are you still here?

933
01:42:47,308 --> 01:42:50,401
我第一次攻击失败了 我必须攻下安不列芙
My first attack failed. I must take Ambleve.

934
01:42:50,613 --> 01:42:54,946
我们在浪费时间 时间不早了 你没有多少时间了
We are wasting time. Time, Hessler, you don't have much.

935
01:42:55,117 --> 01:42:58,176
安不列芙此刻是个 孤立的囊中物 绕过它去 
Ambleve is an isolated resistance. Go around it.

936
01:42:58,354 --> 01:43:01,653
我们也包围了 巴斯东而绕了过去 做同样的事
We have surrounded and bypassed Bastogne. Do the same.

937
01:43:01,825 --> 01:43:04,918
将军，再一小时天就黑了
General, it will be dark in one hour.

938
01:43:05,095 --> 01:43:09,054
我要你允许我以全部军力夜袭
I want your permission for a night assault with all my armor.

939
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,530
海斯勒上校 
Colonel Hessler...

940
01:43:11,701 --> 01:43:15,192
你要脱离这次接战 而去执行你的任务，
...you will break off this engagement, proceed with your mission.

941
01:43:15,438 --> 01:43:17,632
- 这是命令  - 是的，长官
- That's an order.  - Yes, sir.

942
01:43:18,709 --> 01:43:21,871
将军，在你离开之前 我能给你看样东西吗？
General, before you go, may I show you something?

943
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:23,636
是什么
What is it?

944
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:30,653
一个巧克力蛋糕
A chocolate cake.

945
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:32,789
又怎样
Well?

946
01:43:32,958 --> 01:43:37,291
从被俘的美军士兵那拿到的 还是新鲜的
It was taken from a captured American private. It's still fresh.

947
01:43:37,597 --> 01:43:42,193
你若看那包装，将军 你会看到是由波士顿来的
If you will look at the wrapping, general, you will see it comes from Boston.

948
01:43:42,503 --> 01:43:43,993
还有呢
And?

949
01:43:45,104 --> 01:43:47,868
将军，你了解这表示什么意思
General, do you realize what this means?

950
01:43:48,108 --> 01:43:50,905
那表示美国有燃料及飞机
It means that the Americans have fuel and planes...

951
01:43:51,111 --> 01:43:54,375
运蛋糕越过大西洋
...to fly cake across the Atlantic Ocean.

952
01:43:55,617 --> 01:43:58,483
他们没有被打败的信念
They have no conception of defeat.

953
01:43:58,852 --> 01:44:02,719
我们在这有机会 击垮他们的士气
We have the opportunity here to break their morale...

954
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:05,552
摧毁他们的作战意识
...to destroy their will to fight.

955
01:44:05,828 --> 01:44:09,558
那是你必须准许我 把安不列芙夷为平地的原因
That is why you must permit me to reduce Ambleve to ashes.

956
01:44:21,444 --> 01:44:25,744
你有…到凌晨四点之前的时间
You have until 0400.

957
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:28,011
仅此而已
That is all.

958
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,763
我们已令他们的枪声沉寂 现在我们要攻击了
We have silenced their guns. Now we will attack.

959
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:06,960
你的步兵和我的坦克一起去
Your infantry will go in with my tanks.

960
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:08,968
是，长官
Yes, sir.

961
01:48:25,593 --> 01:48:27,786
第二排去那边
Second Platoon, over there.

962
01:48:27,963 --> 01:48:29,452
我们走！快点
Let's go. Move it out.

963
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:33,395
我们最好在合围之前快离开
We'd better get going, sir, before the town is completely surrounded.

964
01:48:34,036 --> 01:48:38,631
我是否该派信差找 乌兰斯基少校叫他掩护撒退？
Shall I send a runner to Major Wolenski telling him to cover our withdrawal?

965
01:48:38,808 --> 01:48:42,402
不 那种命令只能我亲自下
No, that's the kind of order I give to a man myself.

966
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:14,170
瞄准坦克
Aim at the trench!

967
01:49:58,227 --> 01:50:00,625
瞄低一点，我们接近一点
Some more. Let's get closer.

968
01:50:09,074 --> 01:50:12,201
再多拿些塑胶炸药来
Bring up some more plastique!

969
01:50:46,886 --> 01:50:48,112
乌兰斯基少校
Major Wolenski!

970
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:51,216
将军
The general.

971
01:50:53,391 --> 01:50:56,324
在那，进去，赶快 把弹药拿上来
Hurry up! Move that ammo up!

972
01:50:58,697 --> 01:51:01,061
乌兰斯基，我们奉令撒退
Wolenski, we've been ordered out.

973
01:51:01,232 --> 01:51:05,690
我需要时间尽力抢救东西 你的部队得掩护撒退
I'll need time to save what I can. Your outfit will have to cover the withdrawal.

974
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:08,860
- 他们现在已经打到面前了 长官  - 你尽你的力
- They're coming down the chimney, sir.  - Do what you can.

975
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:10,734
- 是，长官  - 走吧
- Yes, sir.  - Come on.

976
01:51:12,778 --> 01:51:15,439
这把步枪我只是借你的
I only loaned you this rifle.

977
01:51:16,415 --> 01:51:20,042
- 待会见了，少校  - 是，长官
- See you later, major.  - Yes, sir.

978
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:26,953
散开
Spread out.

979
01:51:44,811 --> 01:51:46,640
把弹药拿来
Bring up ammo!

980
01:53:32,486 --> 01:53:34,179
修女姐妹
Sister.

981
01:53:35,589 --> 01:53:37,078
上校，打扰了
Colonel, excuse me.

982
01:53:37,259 --> 01:53:39,418
我们在找一位能帮忙的人
We are looking for someone who can help.

983
01:53:39,593 --> 01:53:41,183
说吧
Be brief.

984
01:53:41,363 --> 01:53:44,455
教堂地窖里 有许多受伤的本地人
There are many wounded townspeople in the church cellar.

985
01:53:44,633 --> 01:53:48,123
我们需要医药，纱布 你能分一点给我们吗？
We need medicine, bandages. Can you spare any?

986
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:50,063
我们没东西分给你
We have nothing to spare.

987
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:53,603
有虏获任何医疗用品都给 修女
If there are captured medical supplies, give them to the nuns.

988
01:53:53,809 --> 01:53:56,605
是的，长官，跟我来
Yes, sir. Follow me.

989
01:54:30,279 --> 01:54:31,676
他用这个开火
He fired with this.

990
01:54:37,419 --> 01:54:40,113
珍
Jean, Jean, Jean!

991
01:54:45,995 --> 01:54:48,188
别伤害他
Don't do anything to him, please.

992
01:54:48,364 --> 01:54:49,829
这是孩子的父亲
This is the boy's father.

993
01:54:49,999 --> 01:54:53,330
我求你了，他只是个小孩子
I beg you. He's just a little boy.

994
01:54:53,503 --> 01:54:56,129
他是我的独生子
He's my only child.

995
01:54:56,672 --> 01:54:59,833
别伤害他
Don't do anything to him, please.

996
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:06,177
放了这孩子
Release the boy.

997
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,683
珍
Jean.

998

杀死他爸爸
Shoot the father.

999
01:55:19,997 --> 01:55:23,294
- 爸爸  - 不
- Papa! Papa!  - No!

1000
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:33,368
上校
Colonel.

1001
01:55:33,544 --> 01:55:36,010
被俘的美国高级军官
The senior American officer taken prisoner...

1002
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:38,373
请求与您谈话
...requests permission to speak with you.

1003
01:55:38,549 --> 01:55:41,812
- 他想干吗？  - 他只想与您谈
- What does he want?  - He'll only discuss it with you.

1004
01:55:41,985 --> 01:55:44,110
- 军衔？  - 少校
- Rank?  - Major.

1005
01:55:44,755 --> 01:55:47,688
- 给他两分钟时间  - 是，长官
- He has two minutes.  - Yes, sir.

1006
01:56:02,573 --> 01:56:04,266
康拉德
Conrad.

1007
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:10,739
- 什么食物？  - 城中最好的食物
- What is this food?  - It's the best this town has to offer.

1008
01:56:10,914 --> 01:56:14,245
我告诉过你坦克实施汽油配给， 士兵实施食物配给
I told you, tanks run on petrol and soldiers run on rations.

1009
01:56:14,419 --> 01:56:19,081
我必须与士兵吃一样的东西， 以便了解他们能走多远. 拿走.
I must eat as my men do so I know how far they can go. Take it away.

1010
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:32,693
- 康拉德  - 什么？

1014
01:56:55,527 --> 01:56:56,822
进来
Go in.

1015
01:57:01,299 --> 01:57:02,924
什么？
What is it?

1016
01:57:03,101 --> 01:57:06,728
上校，你抓到的逃兵告诉我
Colonel, stragglers you've captured tell me...

1017
01:57:06,906 --> 01:57:10,135
无助的美国俘虏被屠杀了
...that helpless American prisoners have been massacred.

1018
01:57:10,976 --> 01:57:13,738
- 在哪里？  - 美乐地
- Where?  - Malmedy.

1019
01:57:13,913 --> 01:57:18,814
作为高级军官，我无法控制我的属下， 除非得到你的保证，
And as senior officer, I can't control my men unless I have your assurance...

1020
01:57:18,984 --> 01:57:23,146
他们不会被杀害 我要你签署命令…
...they'll not be murdered. I want your signed order stating that my men...

1021
01:57:23,322 --> 01:57:25,618
声明我的属下会遵照日内瓦公约
...will be accorded the protection...

1022
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:28,985
作为战俘受到保护
...guaranteed prisoners of war by the Geneva Convention.

1023
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:33,350
除非我带这个命令回去， 否则俘虏会暴动
Unless I return with that order, colonel, the prisoners will riot.

1024
01:57:33,531 --> 01:57:36,430
无疑，你会杀了我们， 但请帮我...
Undoubtedly, you'll kill us, but so help me...

1025
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:39,433
...否则我们会拖上你们很多人垫背
...we'll take a hell of a lot of you with us.

1026
01:57:40,305 --> 01:57:43,295
不会签这个命令， 也不能有暴动
There will be no signed order. There will be no riot.

1027
01:57:43,474 --> 01:57:47,533
你不会被允许回去煽动暴动
You will not be allowed to return to your men to instigate that riot.

1028
01:57:48,781 --> 01:57:51,543
你听我说，上校
You listen to me, colonel.

1029
01:57:51,749 --> 01:57:53,942
任何大屠杀都会有生还者
There are survivors in all massacres.

1030
01:57:54,118 --> 01:57:56,710
我警告你，若我的人被伤害
I warn you, if any of my men are harmed...

1031
01:57:56,889 --> 01:58:01,688
你要负责任，你无处可逃
...you will be held responsible. There will be no place on earth that you can hide.

1032
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:06,760
当找到你时，我希望是由我将你问吊
And when you're found, I hope I'm the man that ties the rope around your neck.

1033
01:58:09,268 --> 01:58:11,359
少校
Major...

1034
01:58:11,537 --> 01:58:15,494
我从不喜欢被威胁
...I have never liked threats.

1035
01:58:15,674 --> 01:58:18,164
我不会杀俘虏的
I do not kill prisoners.

1036
01:58:18,343 --> 01:58:23,711
但我如果因为你的最后一句话而亲手杀你，我不会有悔恨
But I will have no compunction at shooting you myself for your last remark.

1037
01:58:23,916 --> 01:58:25,814
那就杀了我吧
Then do it.

1038
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:36,691
你是故意想惹我
You are deliberately trying to provoke me.

1039
01:58:38,597 --> 01:58:41,325
没错，上校
Yes, colonel, that's right.

1040
01:58:41,567 --> 01:58:46,867
若我活着走出去我知道我的人会被善待
If I walk out of here alive, I know my men will be properly treated.

1041
01:58:48,207 --> 01:58:49,900
迪波
Diepel!

1042
01:58:53,246 --> 01:58:56,873
把这位军官送回关押处 活着的
Return this officer to the prisoners' compound, alive.

1043
01:58:57,049 --> 01:58:58,571
走
Come.

1044
01:58:59,719 --> 01:59:03,676
我要你使你的人放心
Major, I'm relying on you to reassure your men...

1045
01:59:03,857 --> 01:59:08,189
我没时间对付烦人的俘虏
...I have no time for troublesome prisoners.

1046
01:59:11,831 --> 01:59:15,629
老虎呼叫OB，科勒将军
Tiger to Standard O-bay, General Kohler.

1047
01:59:18,405 --> 01:59:21,237
你的例行配给
Your usual ration, sir.

1048
01:59:24,477 --> 01:59:27,103
科勒将军
General Kohler. Hessler.

1049
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:32,477
将军，美国俘虏在美乐地被杀害的消息是真的吗？
General, is it true that American prisoners were executed at Malmedy?

1050
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:35,311
美乐地有党卫军部队
There are SS units in the Malmedy sector.

1051
01:59:35,488 --> 01:59:39,388
我无法为前线每一个士兵负责任
I can't assume responsibility for every soldier on this front.

1052
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:43,257
你明白这种行为的后果吗？
Do you realize the consequences of this act?

1053
01:59:43,431 --> 01:59:47,160
为了安不列芙，我损失了17辆坦克，一队人马
I have lost 17 tanks and a battalion of men leveling Ambleve...

1054
01:59:47,368 --> 01:59:50,893
就因为打垮敌军的士气
...for the sole purpose of reducing the enemy's will to fight.

1055
01:59:51,072 --> 01:59:54,335
屠杀会使我们更加充满反抗之心
This massacre will stiffen resistance to us everywhere.

1056
01:59:54,507 --> 01:59:58,805
这会使一群匪徒变成复仇的战士
It will turn a demoralized mob into avenging soldiers.

1057
01:59:59,013 --> 02:00:00,945
你很无礼，上校
You are being insolent, colonel.

1058
02:00:01,115 --> 02:00:03,013
关心你自己的任务吧
Concern yourself with your mission.

1059
02:00:03,184 --> 02:00:05,810
你明天下午4点要达到圣米歇
You are to reach Saint-Michel by 1600 tomorrow.

1060
02:00:05,985 --> 02:00:10,147
- 到那里  - 是的，长官
- Be there.  - Yes, sir.

1061
02:00:40,921 --> 02:00:44,355
他们接受的了打击 而且会面对它
They've taken a beating, and they look it.

1062
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:46,955
他们不是乌合之众
They're not a rabble.

1063
02:00:47,128 --> 02:00:49,822
他们像是军人在撤退
They're retreating like soldiers.

1064
02:00:54,068 --> 02:00:56,364
他们依然有战意
There's still fight in them.

1065
02:00:56,872 --> 02:00:59,839
我们要在哪叫他们 停下来战斗呢
Where are we gonna stop and put up the fight?

1066
02:01:00,742 --> 02:01:04,471
我们最后的一道防线 摩马士河
At our last line of defense, the River Meuse.

1067
02:01:04,645 --> 02:01:07,544
我们渡河在西岸筑工事
We'll cross it and dig in on the west bank.

1068
02:01:07,716 --> 02:01:10,342
至少我们会让德军弄湿
At least we'll get the Germans wet.

1069
02:01:13,555 --> 02:01:15,987
我拖你出安不列芙依然遗憾
Still sore I pulled you out of Ambleve?

1070
02:01:16,158 --> 02:01:18,990
我在那确认战事的结果，长官
I was contributing to the war effort there, sir.

1071
02:01:19,161 --> 02:01:23,596
在我们想办法阻挡他们时 试着别冻僵了你的脚
Try to keep your feet from freezing while we figure a way to stop them.

1072
02:01:23,765 --> 02:01:25,890
他们以前也犯过错
They've made mistakes before.

1073
02:01:26,068 --> 02:01:28,591
这一次他们会在那里犯错
Where have they made one this time?

1074
02:01:30,205 --> 02:01:32,671
他们让我生他们的气了
Well, they got me mad at them.

1075
02:01:42,584 --> 02:01:45,278
闭嘴，我们能走的
Shut up. We'll get there.

1076
02:01:49,292 --> 02:01:51,850
走呀，走呀
Come on. Come on.

1077
02:01:53,196 --> 02:01:55,389
继续走，继续走
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1078
02:01:55,598 --> 02:01:59,260
- 是什么留住你了  - 我没油了 
- What's holding you up?  - I'm out of gas.

1079
02:01:59,435 --> 02:02:02,630
一小时前申请油料了 燃料车在什么地方
I reported low about an hour ago. Where's the fuel truck?

1080
02:02:02,872 --> 02:02:06,806
离开道路去等它 继续走
Get off the road and wait for it. Keep moving.

1081
02:02:07,009 --> 02:02:09,499
- 开到旁边去  - 开走
- Pull it over.  - Move it!

1082
02:02:11,582 --> 02:02:13,242
走呀
Come on!

1083
02:02:16,819 --> 02:02:18,944
继续走…
Keep moving.

1084
02:02:19,121 --> 02:02:22,111
继续走
Keep moving. Move it.

1085
02:02:33,336 --> 02:02:35,666
你要去哪？ 等一下行吗？
Where are you going? Will you wait a minute?

1086
02:02:35,839 --> 02:02:37,964
我需要汽油
I need gas.

1087
02:02:39,943 --> 02:02:41,432
这死王八蛋
Oh, get down.

1088
02:02:44,447 --> 02:02:46,811
你这个丑陋的混蛋
Why, you ugly jerk!

1089
02:02:58,595 --> 02:03:01,653
拿去，用你的大嘴巴用它吧
Here, use your big mouth on that.

1090
02:03:02,933 --> 02:03:05,058
来吧，我们去拿油吧
Hey, come on, let's get with it.

1091
02:03:09,573 --> 02:03:12,506
你们在笑什么？ 快来搬这玩意
What are you laughing at? Come and move this thing.

1092
02:03:12,676 --> 02:03:15,438
- 怎么啦？ 上士  - 搬起来
- You're all wet, sarge.  - Now get it up.

1093
02:03:22,186 --> 02:03:25,950
- 上士，你要这个干什么  - 你要这个干什么
- What are you gonna do with this?  - "What are you gonna do with this?"

1094
02:03:26,123 --> 02:03:28,089
虹吸原理，白痴，把它插进去
Siphon with it, idiot. Put it in.

1095
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:32,986
- 你在想什么  - 和你想的一样
- What are you thinking?  - Same thing you are.

1096
02:03:33,163 --> 02:03:36,062
你抓回来的那些战俘 我们在他们身上找到橡皮管
Those prisoners you brought had rubber hoses on them.

1097
02:03:36,234 --> 02:03:38,530
他们带那个是在吸汽油吗？
They've been carrying those to siphon gas?

1098
02:03:38,703 --> 02:03:41,193
在瓦尔河时我看到 燃料车的油桶
At the Our River, I saw a German fuel truck...

1099
02:03:41,371 --> 02:03:43,837
掉进河里，它们飘在水面
...drop oil drums in the water, they floated.

1100
02:03:44,709 --> 02:03:47,642
- 你们两在说些什么  - 汽油，长官
- What the hell are you talking about?  - Gasoline, sir.

1101
02:03:47,812 --> 02:03:51,712
空的油桶及士兵带着橡皮管 指出了一件事
Empty fuel drums and men carrying siphon hoses add up to one thing.

1102
02:03:51,883 --> 02:03:54,873
德军的汽油不足 必须四处搜刮
The Germans are low on gas. They have to forage for it.

1103
02:03:55,053 --> 02:03:57,315
那就是他们的弱点
That's their weakness.

1104
02:03:58,823 --> 02:04:01,881
- 把这个发去总部  - 长官
- Get this off to headquarters.  - Sir.

1105
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:06,753
A:虎型坦克的燃料消耗量？
A, what is the fuel consumption of a Tiger tank?

1106
02:04:07,398 --> 02:04:11,196
B:攻击发起线 到瓦尔河的确实距离
B, the exact distance from the Siegfried Line to the Meuse River.

1107
02:04:11,369 --> 02:04:15,895
C:德军汽油储存量 预估有多少
C, what is the estimate of fuel reserves in the German army?

1108
02:04:16,075 --> 02:04:18,701
- 就这些  - 是的，长官，立刻发
- That's it.  - Yes, sir, right away.

1109
02:04:22,347 --> 02:04:24,870
你笑什么？ 白痴
What are you laughing at, you idiot?

1110
02:04:34,393 --> 02:04:36,291
巴斯东的确实情况如何
What is the situation in Bastogne?

1111
02:04:36,461 --> 02:04:39,519
我军已彻底包围了美军
Our forces have completely encircled the Americans.

1112
02:04:39,698 --> 02:04:44,360
他们的情况毫无希望 他们除了投降没有第二条路
Their situation is hopeless. They have no recourse but to surrender.

1113
02:04:48,607 --> 02:04:51,904
看看是什么来了，少尉
Hey, look what's coming. Lieutenant!

1114
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:06,046
停
Halt!

1115
02:05:13,699 --> 02:05:16,131
德军指挥官
The German commander wishes to communicate...

1116
02:05:16,302 --> 02:05:19,827
想与巴斯东的美军指挥官对话
...with the American commander of the encircled town of Bastogne.

1117
02:05:20,006 --> 02:05:22,838
他现在有点忙 你心里想些什么
He's a little busy right now. What's on your mind?

1118
02:05:25,011 --> 02:05:30,840
德军指挥官致巴斯东美军指挥官
"From the German commanding general to the commander of American troops fighting in Bastogne.

1119
02:05:31,818 --> 02:05:33,841
由于战争局面的改变
With the changing fortunes of war...

1120
02:05:34,019 --> 02:05:37,316
在巴斯东附近的美军
...the U.S.A. Forces in and around Bastogne...

1121
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:42,516
已经完全被优势的德军机械化部队包围
...have become completely surrounded by superior German armored units.

1122
02:05:43,163 --> 02:05:46,130
唯一能拯救美军 
The only possibility to spare the American troops...

1123
02:05:46,299 --> 02:05:50,529
被全歼灭的机会 是他们光荣的投降
...from total annihilation is their honorable surrender...

1124
02:05:50,737 --> 02:05:55,297
那才能防止对无助平民的屠杀
...which will also prevent the slaughter of helpless civilians."

1125
02:05:56,009 --> 02:05:58,841
你们有一个小时来做停战答覆
You have one hour of truce to reply.

1126
02:06:00,246 --> 02:06:02,212
蒙上他的眼睛
Blindfold him.

1127
02:06:02,382 --> 02:06:04,245
带他到指挥部去
Take him up to the command post.

1128
02:06:21,468 --> 02:06:23,627
请重覆
Repeat, please.

1129
02:06:26,006 --> 02:06:27,869
就这些？
Is that all?

1130
02:06:28,042 --> 02:06:30,838
长官，我收到巴斯东的回音
Sir, I have a message from Bastogne.

1131
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:37,379
怎么说？
What is it?

1132
02:06:37,551 --> 02:06:40,313
我不明白
I don't understand it.

1133
02:06:41,822 --> 02:06:45,655
巴斯东美军指挥官 致德军指挥官
"From the American commander of Bastogne to the German commander.

1134
02:06:45,826 --> 02:06:47,553
坚果（疯子）
Nuts."

1135
02:06:51,165 --> 02:06:52,994
疯子
Nuts.

1136
02:08:04,506 --> 02:08:06,472
在那边
Hey, over there.

1137
02:08:07,876 --> 02:08:09,171
是位军官
Hey, it's an officer.

1138
02:08:09,376 --> 02:08:11,239
我们真高兴见过你
Boy, are we glad to see you.

1139
02:08:11,413 --> 02:08:14,312
- 我们已经12个小时没吃东西了  - 我们迷路了
- I haven't eaten in 12 hours.  - We got lost.

1140
02:08:14,516 --> 02:08:15,981
慢着，等一下
Hold it. Wait a minute.

1141
02:08:16,151 --> 02:08:18,947
你认为我们该投降吗？ 少尉
Do you think we should surrender, lieutenant?

1142
02:08:21,289 --> 02:08:23,152
投降？
Surrender?

1143
02:08:24,092 --> 02:08:25,752
不！
No.

1144
02:08:27,796 --> 02:08:31,195
放松，全部放松
Just stay loose, all of you. Stay loose.

1145
02:08:31,399 --> 02:08:33,297
现在把那手电筒给我
Now, give me that light.

1146
02:08:40,976 --> 02:08:43,772
好了，散开来，休息一会
All right, spread out. Get some rest.

1147
02:08:43,945 --> 02:08:46,411
天亮我们就开始行动
We'll get started when it's light.

1148
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:18,743
葛雷将军
General Grey.

1149
02:09:18,948 --> 02:09:21,346
长官，这刚到
Sir, this just came in.

1150
02:09:22,485 --> 02:09:25,850
- 你往那去，你往那去  - 你们有任何人到过 安不列芙吗？
- Move along.  - Any of you guys been to Ambleve?

1151
02:09:26,022 --> 02:09:28,011
等一等，那家伙 等一下行吗？
Wait a minute. Will you wait a minute?

1152
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:32,352
- 听我说 你们到过安不列芙吗？  - 别这样，葛菲 我们会惹上麻烦
- Any of you guys been to Ambleve?  - Come on, Guffy, we'll get in trouble.

1153
02:09:32,529 --> 02:09:34,392
不，我必须知道
I gotta know.

1154
02:09:35,598 --> 02:09:37,587
我由安不列芙出来的
I've been to Ambleve.

1155
02:09:37,767 --> 02:09:39,357
- 你知道安蓓客栈？  - 是的
- You know Ambleve inn?  - Yeah.

1156
02:09:39,535 --> 02:09:41,024
它没事，对吧？
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

1157
02:09:41,204 --> 02:09:43,762
它片瓦不存
There's nothing left of it.

1158
02:09:48,344 --> 02:09:50,503
葛菲，别这样
Guffy, come on.

1159
02:09:55,752 --> 02:09:58,275
他们何时才要让我们作战？
When are they gonna let us fight?

1160
02:09:58,789 --> 02:10:00,618
我们走
Let's go.

1161
02:10:05,394 --> 02:10:09,351
这是你要求总部给的资料 长官
It's here, sir, the information you requested from headquarters.

1162
02:10:11,435 --> 02:10:13,025
没错
That's it.

1163
02:10:13,203 --> 02:10:15,294
他们没汽油了
They're running out of gas.

1164
02:10:16,373 --> 02:10:19,397
德军攻击的前锋现在在那里？
Where's the spearhead of the German advance right now?

1165
02:10:19,576 --> 02:10:23,409
我们收到消息是 过安不列芙四哩处朝西前进
We place it four miles past Ambleve, moving west.

1166
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:25,307
你预测日出时他们会在那里？
Where will they be at daybreak?

1167
02:10:25,515 --> 02:10:30,815
若他们彻夜前进 他们该在油料库东方9哩处
If they travel all night, they should be nine miles due east of the fuel depot.

1168
02:10:31,022 --> 02:10:33,215
我们会在那等他们
We'll be there to meet them.

1169
02:10:33,391 --> 02:10:36,153
我要指挥我的坦克
I'm committing my tanks.

1170
02:10:36,326 --> 02:10:38,224
我们用F计划
We'll use plan F.

1171
02:10:38,396 --> 02:10:41,625
- 替我呼叫蓝码301  - 301
- Get me Blue Code 301.  - 301.

1172
02:10:41,933 --> 02:10:46,231
好了，上车 出发！出发！
All right, mount up. Crank them up. Let's go. Let's go.

1173
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,233
出发！发动它们！发动它们
Let's go. Crank them up, crank them up.

1174
02:11:13,297 --> 02:11:15,320
看看那雾
Look at that fog.

1175
02:11:16,268 --> 02:11:19,827
它若不散我们就不会找到他们 我们就不会战斗
If it stays, we won't find them and we won't fight.

1176
02:11:20,505 --> 02:11:23,438
它若转晴了，他们会找到我们
If it lifts, they'll find us.

1177
02:11:24,175 --> 02:11:27,370
那会是我们的人及坦克的终结
And that will be the end of our men and our tanks.

1178
02:11:29,214 --> 02:11:31,942
而我在祈祷它睛天
And I'm praying that it lifts.

1179
02:11:34,019 --> 02:11:36,645
那会让我是什么样的人？
What does that make me, Dan?

1180
02:11:38,157 --> 02:11:40,123
一位将军
A general.

1181
02:11:52,403 --> 02:11:54,893
是那样吗？ 将军
Is that so, general?

1182
02:11:55,107 --> 02:11:56,629
非常的有趣
It's very interesting.

1183
02:11:57,676 --> 02:11:59,699
谢谢你，将军
Thank you, general.

1184
02:12:05,484 --> 02:12:08,508
我们的旅目前是前进的最远的
Our column has made the farthest advance.

1185
02:12:08,687 --> 02:12:14,555
我们的战车是前进最远的 是全德国所嘱目的
We have outrun the other panzers. The eyes of Germany are on us.

1186
02:12:14,727 --> 02:12:18,183
元首本人会为我授勋
The Führer himself will decorate me.

1187
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:21,892
我们做到了，康拉德 我们做到了
We have done it, Conrad. We have done it.

1188
02:12:22,067 --> 02:12:24,899
那么我错了，我们赢了这战争
Then I was wrong. We have won the war.

1189
02:12:25,437 --> 02:12:27,198
没有
No.

1190
02:12:28,006 --> 02:12:30,029
你是说我们输了？
You mean we have lost?

1191
02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:32,176
没有
No.

1192
02:12:33,046 --> 02:12:37,174
我不了解 若我们没有赢我们又没有输
I don't understand. If we have not won and we have not lost...

1193
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:38,679
那么是怎么回事？
...then what's happening?

1194
02:12:38,885 --> 02:12:42,547
可能发生最好的事 是战争会持续
The best thing possible is happening. The war will go on.

1195
02:12:43,056 --> 02:12:46,217
- 持续多久？  - 永远
- For how long?  - Indefinitely.

1196
02:12:46,859 --> 02:12:50,054
一直持续下去！
On and on and on.

1197
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:54,464
- 但它必须要终结的  - 你是个傻瓜，康拉德
- But it must come to an end.  - You're a fool, Conrad.

1198
02:12:54,667 --> 02:12:59,534
我们在1941年就已晓得 我们永远赢不了的
Those of us who understood knew, in 1941, we could never win.

1199
02:13:00,074 --> 02:13:03,439
你是说，上校 我们打了三年 
You mean, colonel, for three years, we have been fighting...

1200
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:07,772
- 没有胜利希望的仗  - 胜利有许多种
- ...without any hope of victory?  - There are many kinds of victory.

1201
02:13:07,947 --> 02:13:11,938
德军是否能活下来 让我们还能穿着这身军服
For the German army to survive, for us to remain in uniform...

1202
02:13:12,119 --> 02:13:14,745
那就是我们的胜利
...that is our victory.

1203
02:13:14,922 --> 02:13:19,755
康拉德 世界毕竟不能除掉我们！
Conrad, the world is not going to get rid of us after all.

1204
02:13:21,728 --> 02:13:23,751
但，我们何时才能回家？
But when do we go home?

1205
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:27,325
这就是我们的家
This is our home.

1206
02:13:29,569 --> 02:13:35,403
那我的儿子呢？ 我何时才能看到他们？ 他们会变成什么样子？
And my sons? When do I see them? What will become of them?

1207
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:41,705
他们会变成德国军人 而你会以他们为傲
They will become German soldiers, and you will be proud of them.

1208
02:13:49,356 --> 02:13:50,685
康拉德
Conrad.

1209
02:13:50,858 --> 02:13:55,520
在安不列芙你给我吃的东西 还有吗？
You still have any of those delicacies left you offered me at Ambleve?

1210
02:13:55,729 --> 02:13:56,751
有，有的，长官
Yes, sir.

1211
02:13:57,097 --> 02:14:01,293
为我弄一下，我的胃口非常好
Prepare them for me, will you? I'm in very good appetite.

1212
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:08,129
- 看到任何东西了吗？  - 什么也没有
- See anything?  - Nothing.

1213
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:10,503
好像失踪了一样
It's like they disappeared.

1214
02:14:14,615 --> 02:14:17,105
- 发现他们了吗？  - 没有，长官
- They been spotted yet?  - No, sir.

1215
02:14:17,284 --> 02:14:19,842
他们一定利用晚上改变了方向
They must have changed course during the night.

1216
02:14:21,957 --> 02:14:24,048
再呼叫我们的侦察兵
Call our scouts again.

1217
02:14:32,033 --> 02:14:34,625
- 看到任何东西了吗？ 什么都没
- See anything?  - Nothing.

1218
02:14:35,135 --> 02:14:37,226
红河6号，红河6号
Red River Six. Red River Six.

1219
02:14:37,405 --> 02:14:39,234
侦察预定交战地区
Scouted designated territory.

1220
02:14:39,407 --> 02:14:40,963
没有德军坦克的踪影
No sign of German tanks.

1221
02:14:50,318 --> 02:14:55,049
视野20码都没有 他们不在这，否则我会听见的
Can't see 20 yards. They're nowhere around, or I'd hear something.

1222
02:14:57,560 --> 02:14:59,150
讲点道理，中校
Let's be reasonable, colonel.

1223
02:14:59,327 --> 02:15:02,488
这种雾没有任何东西会起飞 你怎么能期待我带你上去
You expect me to take you up? Nothing's flying in this fog.

1224
02:15:02,665 --> 02:15:05,497
那让你安全，乔 不会撞到别的飞机
That makes it safe. We won't bump into another plane.

1225
02:15:05,668 --> 02:15:09,261
那我们怎么能看到坦克群 我们的能见度是零
How can we see the panzer column when we have zero visibility?

1226
02:15:09,437 --> 02:15:13,565
你若不停止争论 我们都会得肺炎 坐到那操纵杆后面去
You'll catch pneumonia if you don't stop arguing. Get behind that stick.

1227
02:15:13,842 --> 02:15:15,774
且慢
Wait a minute.

1228
02:15:15,945 --> 02:15:17,570
飞行命令在那？
Where are the flying orders?

1229
02:15:17,746 --> 02:15:19,678
我要看它
I wanna see them.

1230
02:15:19,848 --> 02:15:22,610
我要知道是那个疯子批准的
I wanna know what lunatic issued them.

1231
02:15:23,118 --> 02:15:26,608
没有命令，乔，那疯子是我
There are no orders, Joe. I'm the lunatic.

1232
02:15:27,623 --> 02:15:30,852
我家庭中没有疯子
Well, there's no insanity in my family.

1233
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:35,258
乔，我们不找到那坦克群 那就不会有坦克会战
If we don't find that panzer column, there will be no tank battle.

1234
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,521
那我们得用步兵去阻止他们
We'll have to stop them with infantry.

1235
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:40,724
很多人得战死 就因为你要保持安全距离
A lot of guys are gonna die to keep you safe and cozy.

1236
02:15:40,904 --> 02:15:43,837
你真的很会打重要害，中校 那太脏了
You sure know how to hit below the belt. That's dirty.

1237
02:15:44,274 --> 02:15:48,072
我们不是在打枕头仗，乔 抱歉它让你痛心
We're not in a pillow fight, Joe. Sorry it hurts.

1238
02:15:50,246 --> 02:15:52,235
上去吧！
Get in.

1239
02:15:56,085 --> 02:15:58,449
所有的报告都是没有，长官
All reports negative, sir.

1240
02:16:08,097 --> 02:16:10,962
他们一定在某个地方
Well, they must be someplace.

1241
02:16:11,934 --> 02:16:14,924
大地不可能就那样 吞灭了他们
The earth couldn't have just swallowed them up.

1242
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:21,139
- 派出侦察巡逻队  - 是的，长官
- Send out additional patrols.  - Yes, sir.

1243
02:16:30,519 --> 02:16:33,975
我在这干什么？ 这就像是在灯泡中飞行一样
What am I doing up here? It's like flying inside a light bulb.

1244
02:16:34,156 --> 02:16:37,089
只要保持我给你的航向 我们会找到他们的
Just stay on the course I gave you. We'll find them.

1245
02:16:37,259 --> 02:16:40,249
- 你怎么知道  - 海斯勒在找汽油
- How do you know?  - Hessler's looking for gas.

1246
02:16:40,429 --> 02:16:43,692
他在以寻获我方的补给打赌 飞低一点
He's gambling on capturing our supply. Get lower.

1247
02:16:43,899 --> 02:16:47,333
- 我们已经在五百尺以下了  - 我们须找个陆标
- We're down to 500 feet.  - We just have to pick up a landmark.

1248
02:16:47,503 --> 02:16:51,165
这里到处都是山，中校 我们找个陆标就要撞上去了
Hills are all around. We'll pick up a landmark right in the kisser.

1249
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:53,169
试着飞低一点
Try it a little lower.

1250
02:17:02,352 --> 02:17:06,014
- 我什么都看不见  - 好了，关掉发动机
- I can't see a damn thing.  - All right, cut your engine.

1251
02:17:06,556 --> 02:17:08,852
滑行并且听 我们不必看见他们 我们能听见他们
Glide and listen. We can hear them.

1252
02:17:09,024 --> 02:17:14,858
- 你是在告诉我 在两百尺上空滑行  - 别说话了，关掉发动机
- Are you telling me to glide at 200 feet?  - Cut the talk and the engine.

1253
02:17:32,516 --> 02:17:36,678
- 取消吧！  - 当然，现在我们再试一次
- I'm calling this off.  - Sure. Now, let's try it again.

1254
02:17:41,025 --> 02:17:43,491
好了，关掉发动机
Okay, cut your engine.

1255
02:17:47,031 --> 02:17:50,157
我们若只有一百尺高 我跳机把你留在这
If we were 100 feet higher, I'd jump and leave you here.

1256
02:17:50,334 --> 02:17:51,959
安静
Quiet.

1257
02:18:01,411 --> 02:18:03,969
那是油料库
There's the depot.

1258
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:10,852
河在那里
There's the river.

1259
02:18:12,256 --> 02:18:15,088
德国人一定在南方
The column has to be due south.

1260
02:18:16,861 --> 02:18:18,190
那是你的航向
That's your course.

1261
02:18:21,933 --> 02:18:24,594
飞低到我们能看见的高度，乔
Get her down, Joe, where we can see.

1262
02:18:27,438 --> 02:18:30,963
- 我们的高度是多少  - 四百尺
- What's our altitude?  - Four hundred feet.

1263
02:18:31,142 --> 02:18:33,301
好了，关掉发动机
All right, cut the engine.

1264
02:18:42,086 --> 02:18:43,608
你听见了吗？
Do you hear that?

1265
02:18:43,789 --> 02:18:46,017
有，我们飞下去看看
Yeah. We're going down for a look.

1266
02:18:58,303 --> 02:19:01,099
点燃发动机，我们快离开这
Hit your engine, let's get out of here.

1267
02:19:03,542 --> 02:19:06,941
红河6号，红河6号 这里是红河2号 发现敌军战车旅
Red River Six, this is Red River Two. The enemy column sighted.

Send scouts forward. I want their numbers and composition.

我在说我要我的望远镜
I was saying I wanted my binoculars.

1297

有什么不对了？
What's wrong?
