1
00:00:00,687 --> 00:00:03,019
Fall back!

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,124
Get down.

3
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:26,904
Get going. Stay low.

4
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,749
Hessler to headquarters.

5
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:07,715
<i>Resistance very weak. </i>

6
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:11,050
<i>Southern front reporting. </i>

7
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:14,125
<i>Commander Nimke</i>
<i>encountering light resistance. </i>

8
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:16,888
<i>Enemy retreating across river K- 10.</i>

9
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:20,490
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, somebody man this gun!

10
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,356
- Here they come!
- There they are!

11
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:44,645
Give me a belt!

12
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,498
Hey, wait for me!

13
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:13,570
Grab the tailgate!

14
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:17,610
Wait for me!

15
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:26,515
- Where's your motor pool?
- At regiment, four kilometers.

16
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,457
Let's get there.
I gotta get back to headquarters.

17
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,957
- Wait for me!
- Hold it a minute!

18
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,690
Wait for me!

19
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,405
We haven't got a chance.

20
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:20,273
Relax. Stay loose.

21
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:24,312
You think we'll have to surrender?

22
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:28,179
Well, I hear they treat
American prisoners real well.

23
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:31,380
In a big battle,
they treat nobody real well.

24
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:35,192
Come on. There's a back road
that leads to the motor pool.

25
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:38,831
- Maybe we can get us a jeep.
- How do you know?

26
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,831
Because I studied the maps
when we arrived here.

27
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,526
Just like you should've done.

28
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:52,211
- What if we run into their lines?
- We're still ahead of them.

29
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:56,314
- They might have advanced patrols.
- It's enough trouble keeping alive...

30
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,678
...in this mess
without you bellyaching.

31
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:02,151
If you wanna surrender, go ahead.
I'll make it easier alone.

32
00:05:02,355 --> 00:05:04,721
You're out of line, sergeant.

33
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,849
Sorry, lieutenant.

34
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:12,327
Look, I don't need help from you.
You wanna go on by yourself, go ahead.

35
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:19,301
Are you coming,
or am I gonna have to carry you?

36
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:40,352
Hello, Cheyenne.

37
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:42,392
What's that? You're under attack?

38
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:44,257
In what strength?

39
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:46,261
Well, what's your guess?

40
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:49,162
I can't give you air reconnaissance,
I'm blind.

41
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,326
- Get Apache.
- Call Apache.

42
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:53,863
Eddie, what's going on
in your sector?

43
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,406
It's only patrol action.
How heavy?

44
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:59,739
Well, what does your
reconnaissance say? Nothing heavy.

45
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:02,507
We're trying to get a picture.
Stay on task.

46
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:32,442
The first phase of our offensive
was a success.

47
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,904
The element of surprise
was complete.

48
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,914
American communications
are in a turmoil.

49
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:41,110
We must cross the Our River
before the enemy realizes...

50
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:44,154
...we have launched
an all-out offensive.

51
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:49,818
I do not believe I gave you permission
to smoke.

52
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,826
Sorry, sir.

53
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:56,962
Unfortunately, we did not have time
to get better acquainted...

54
00:06:57,136 --> 00:07:00,435
...but all of you know my reputation.

55
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:05,539
My command always suffers
the highest casualties.

56
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:09,938
The price of victory is never cheap.

57
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:14,280
In this battle, we will be
as hard as our tanks.

58
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,913
I will reach the objectives
assigned to me...

59
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,922
...no matter what the cost.

60
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:23,491
Signal from headquarters, colonel.

61
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:28,027
Hessler, I congratulate you.

62
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:31,500
- You're on schedule.
- I will reach the Our River as planned.

63
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,834
But the enemy must not be permitted
to destroy the bridge.

64
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,772
- Has Schumacher seized it yet?
- Not yet.

65
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:41,971
Schumacher's primary assignment
is to disrupt enemy communications.

66
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:44,882
I must have that bridge secured
for my tanks.

67
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,018
I have no time to build bridges.

68
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:53,488
Hessler, your bridge will be secured.

69
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,221
We are expecting you to cross it
according to the schedule.

70
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:03,693
You know your line of march.
Coordinate with the map.

71
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:12,175
Conrad, I have a headache.

72
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,255
Fire! Fire!

73
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,275
Land mines!
Why were they not cleared?

74
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,542
Where are the men
with mine detectors?

75
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:53,242
We are moving too fast.

76
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,387
The men are following in trucks.

77
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:57,045
They are all dead.

78
00:08:57,223 --> 00:09:00,158
The mine exploded
directly under them.

79
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,060
Notify their seconds-in-command
to take over.

80
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:05,789
Tell them I have absolute
confidence in them.

81
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,258
We have lost a tank unnecessarily.

82
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,732
We've lost precious minutes
unnecessarily.

83
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:13,371
Your troops were here
to protect the panzers.

84
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,939
From now on,
until we clear this minefield...

85
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:19,237
...your men will go ahead of my tanks.

86
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,548
And have my vehicle repaired at once!

87
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:39,261
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

88
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:49,274
Now, listen to me, all of you.

89
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:52,104
I need precise information:

90
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:54,838
How many men, how many guns...

91
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:57,778
...how many tanks
the enemy are throwing into this.

92
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,851
How much fuel are they carrying?
And get a move on.

93
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,751
We've got 24 hours
before we scream rape.

94
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,522
All right, Kiley, it's your turn.

95
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,093
They're pouring through, general.

96
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:13,289
Crack troops. Brand-new equipment.

97
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:17,368
I looked inside one of their tanks.
They can chew up anything we've got.

98
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:21,371
- Question is, where are they going?
- Do you have that information?

99
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,441
No, but he does. Colonel Hessler...

100
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,169
...the commanding officer
of the panzer spearhead.

101
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:28,108
When we know where he's going...

102
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:30,772
...we'll know the objective
of the attack.

103
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,511
The enemy is probing at five points
along an 85-mile front.

104
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:37,155
With only that information
at our disposal...

105
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:40,656
...how can you assume Hessler's column
is the spearhead?

106
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,988
- The law of probability, Kiley?
- No, sir.

107
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:45,153
The law of probability is against me.

108
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:49,665
But in the absence of other information,
I've one chance in five of being right.

109
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:53,134
- I'd like to explore that chance.
- How?

110
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:55,137
- Well, sir...
- I'll tell you how.

111
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,639
Watch the Our River.

112
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:00,370
There's only one bridge, right here,
that can support heavy tanks.

113
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:04,312
I'd say that's where Hessler will be,
and that's where I'll be.

114
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:08,317
Don't get too close to that bridge.
I've ordered it blown up.

115
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:11,651
That's a good thing to know.
Thanks for the tip.

116
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:19,162
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Go on, keep moving.

117
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:22,532
Come on, let's go.
You there, keep moving.

118
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:24,670
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

119
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,506
Come on. Come on, let's go.

120
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:38,582
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

121
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:44,922
Move it. Come on, keep moving.
Step on it. Get going.

122
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,060
Come on, let's get going.
Step on it.

123
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:55,200
Hey, what are you stopping for?

124
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:57,859
That sign.
When we came through before...

125
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:02,064
...I recall Amblève was that way.
- You're blocking the road. Get going.

126
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:04,072
- Hurry up.
- Come on, let's go.

127
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:07,940
Wait a minute. I tell you, those signs
point in the wrong direction.

128
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:10,139
What's holding up the parade here?

129
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:13,546
Somebody's been monkeying around
with those road signs.

130
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,880
That ain't the road to Amblève.

131
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:18,888
Two hours ago,
I came here from Amblève...

132
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,753
...over this exact same road.

133
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:23,760
Now, maybe they've moved Amblève
in the meantime...

134
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,330
...but two hours ago
this was the road to it.

135
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,263
- Take off, Duquesne.
- Lieutenant, I'm telling you...

136
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:32,893
Lieutenant, tell your sergeant
to get this jeep out of here.

137
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:36,371
Move. That's an order. Move.

138
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,108
Yeah, I hope they enjoy themselves
in Malmedy.

139
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,488
- Come on. We're getting off here.
- Wait.

140
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:52,419
Come on!

141
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,983
Jump.

142
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,865
Hey, wait a minute. Where we going?

143
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:03,001
We're supposed to be in Amblève.

144
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:05,694
We'll get there.
I gotta make a pickup first.

145
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:08,703
- Pickup?
- I got some merchandise in a farmhouse.

146
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:12,344
Germans are coming. They'll steal it.
You gotta give me a hand.

147
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:14,672
Hey, you two!

148
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,413
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

149
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,035
Are you the last one?
Anybody behind you?

150
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:40,366
Yeah, the whole German army.
Go ahead.

151
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:46,240
You there, keep them moving.
Come on, step on it.

152
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,579
Notify the panzers.
The bridge is intact.

153
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:13,438
- Any sign of the Germans?
- No, not yet.

154
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:17,098
- What are you men doing here?
- We got orders to blow the bridge.

155
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,005
- Pile out.
- Wait a minute.

156
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:21,339
That job's being done.

157
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:33,850
How you boys making out?

158
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:37,018
- Just about finished.
- Hurry up, will you?

159
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,630
Get out of here
before those Krauts get here.

160
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,199
- You need any help?
- I got a good idea.

161
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:47,931
We'll give them all a hot-water bottle.
That water comes straight off the ice.

162
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:50,769
Well, I'm sure loaded with C-4.
Can you use any?

163
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:53,639
I imagine they could sell you some.

164
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,776
Climb in.

165
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:06,751
Hey, why do you got your wires
hooked on to that detonator?

166
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:13,988
- I guess he's in a hurry.
- To get killed? That's not the way.

167
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,793
Sarge, bring a couple of men.

168
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:18,903
We're gonna take a look
under that bridge.

169
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,079
This ain't the road to Amblève.

170
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:37,654
That's what the sign says.

171
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:41,156
The sign says thataway,
the map says Amblève was this way.

172
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,955
Will somebody straighten this out?

173
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:49,130
Amblève. Amblève.

174
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:55,930
- Hey, Wolenski.
- Oh, colonel.

175
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,806
Hey, we're all fouled up here.

176
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:02,880
We've been ordered to Amblève,
but the maps don't jibe with the signs.

177
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:06,279
How'd you get off the road?
This will take you to Malmedy.

178
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:08,477
- Amblève's that way.
- That way?

179
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:11,487
We've been following these road signs
the whole way.

180
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:15,684
And the MPs we ran into,
they've been directing us this way.

181
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:20,190
They've been changed.
They switched them around.

182
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,334
Those MPs you ran into seem okay?

183
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:25,698
- What do you mean?
- Anything odd about them?

184
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:27,202
Just regular Gls.

185
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,340
We intercepted an enemy dispatch.

186
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:32,204
They were recruiting
English-speaking Germans.

187
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:35,074
What time did you cross the Our River?

188
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:38,546
8:40. We were last ones across.
They were set to blow it.

189
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,810
- You see the bridge blown?
- No.

190
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:43,716
But I saw the engineers
setting the charges.

191
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:50,021
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell?
They weren't engineers, they were MPs.

192
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:54,162
Murphy, get me headquarters.

193
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,393
And, major,
have someone switch that sign back.

194
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,334
Red River Six. Come in, Red River Six.

195
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:04,670
<i>- Come in, Red River Two. </i>
- Red River Six, this is Red River Two.

196
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:09,440
Germans uniformed as American MPs
holding Our River Bridge.

197
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,116
Bridge has not been blown.

198
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:15,685
Repeat. Germans uniformed
as American MPs...

199
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:19,951
...holding Our River Bridge.
Bridge has not been blown.

200
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:23,094
Over and out. Let's go.

201
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:40,937
Better hold it, Jack.

202
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,749
- What happened?
- They ran into a firefight.

203
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,716
German patrol.

204
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,446
I don't see any Germans.

205
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:53,925
They're in the river.
They didn't make it across.

206
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:56,323
Get out of here.
We're blowing the bridge.

207
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:59,825
What? Are you sure?

208
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:02,323
Watch out, the MPs are Krauts!

209
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,352
Oh, my God! Get down!

210
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:04,755
Why are we waiting?
Get that tank out of the way.

211
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,362
We are preparing
to tow it off now, sir.

212
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:12,669
Tiger to tanks Leopard and Panther.
Blast that tank off the bridge.

213
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:30,746
It's headquarters, colonel.

214
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:33,357
General Kohler says
we are behind schedule.

215
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:36,422
He wants to know
what's holding us up.

216
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:42,158
Tell the general the Americans
are learning how to retreat.

217
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:48,933
Tiger to Panther. Get onto the bridge,
push that junk right out of the way.

218
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:26,570
Stay down.

219
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:44,062
Murphy, call headquarters. Tell them
the Our River Bridge hasn't been blown.

220
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:47,289
- The enemy's crossing in great strength.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:02,311
- Let me have your rifle.
- What you need is a cannon, sir.

222
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:06,474
The last time I saw that German,
all I had was a camera.

223
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:53,128
Can't you hurry it up, sergeant?
We lost the column.

224
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:57,200
Do you happen to have a new carburetor
in your pocket, lieutenant?

225
00:21:58,237 --> 00:22:00,364
You mean we're stuck here?

226
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:06,238
Nope. We can still walk.

227
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,981
Let's go.

228
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:16,443
- Hey, maybe we can get a lift, huh?
- Hold it.

229
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,483
We better find out
just who they are first.

230
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,891
Down.

231
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:38,101
Yeah, Krauts. Back.

232
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:20,441
If you'd just stayed loose,
I could've gotten them all.

233
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:44,572
<i>Americans in headlong retreat. </i>
<i>Our forces are advancing on all fronts. </i>

234
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:48,276
<i>Great numbers of prisoners</i>
<i>are being taken. </i>

235
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,234
I got a bad feeling about this.

236
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,470
If you wanted to make a run for it,
why didn't you?

237
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:58,048
I'm in your outfit, lieutenant.

238
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:02,118
My job is to look out for you,
go where you go.

239
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:09,488
I sure got you into the wrong place
this time.

240
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:12,519
But I'm glad you're with me.

241
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:19,197
When we get to the POW camp,
they'll separate us...

242
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:21,134
...you being an officer.

243
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,209
Yeah.

244
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:28,904
I'm gonna miss you, sergeant.

245
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:51,692
Run!

246
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:11,784
Keep going!

247
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,542
Get going. Come on, step on it.

248
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,232
- Is she here?
- No.

249
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,336
Well, tell her I'm back, huh?

250
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:50,645
I want you all to fan out. Round up
every man that belongs to this outfit.

251
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,549
We will assemble here in 10 minutes.
On the double.

252
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:54,984
Let's go.

253
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:08,767
What's all this?

254
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,235
What's it look like?
My place of business.

255
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:19,243
- What are the chickens for?
- They lay eggs.

256
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:21,905
Any idea what fresh eggs
brings in these days?

257
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,313
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

258
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,212
All right, open the door,
that's my partner.

259
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:38,096
Look, run down to the tank park
and check us both in.

260
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:40,894
- But...
- And then report back to me. Go ahead.

261
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:45,104
The chickens look scrawny.
Have you been feeding them regular?

262
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,763
I was worried about you.

263
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:49,933
- Is it true the Germans are coming?
- Right through here.

264
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,944
- We gotta sell everything, fast.
- Then you'll leave?

265
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:58,950
Face it, kid, we're out of business.
One case of champagne, $360.

266
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,820
Two dozen nylons, $80.
Twenty bottles of perfume, $200.

267
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:09,657
Six hundred and forty dollars.
Here's your half.

268
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:13,322
Three hundred and twenty dollars.
All right, what did you make?

269
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,937
One thousand, two hundred
and thirty dollars. Here.

270
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:24,003
What have you been selling?
I don't see much stock gone.

271
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,807
- Take it.
- I won't until I know how you made it.

272
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:29,677
- What do you think I am?
- What do you think I am?

273
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:35,012
- It's money I've saved for us.
- For us? What are you talking about?

274
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:40,391
When a woman goes in business
with a man, it means forever.

275
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:44,793
What's forever? The shop is closed.
The Germans are coming.

276
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:47,093
They've been here before.

277
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,168
I've lived through it.

278
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:51,999
I will live through it again.

279
00:29:57,912 --> 00:29:59,846
I will wait for you.

280
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,520
How can you feel this way about me?
I never laid a hand on you.

281
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,622
That's why.

282
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:12,022
You're in love with me.

283
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,656
Just a second. Hold the phone.

284
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,562
Hold the phone, here.

285
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,194
Shut up.

286
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:43,157
You know what?

287
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:45,087
You're right.

288
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:48,086
There.

289
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,198
You hold all the money.
I gotta go back in action.

290
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,527
You don't know
what it's like in combat.

291
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:55,931
You get shot,
somebody takes your money.

292
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,471
Before the plasma comes,
a guy's got his hand in your pocket.

293
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:02,670
Guffy. Guffy.

294
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:07,709
- I don't want you to get killed.
- Who's talking about getting killed?

295
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,440
You take care of the money.

296
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:14,213
Sarge, the tanks aren't there. They've
been pulled back. We gotta catch up.

297
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,193
So long, partner.

298
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,025
Take care of yourself.

299
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,686
Guffy.

300
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,192
Don't you want to kiss me?

301
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:49,284
Don't forget to feed the chickens, huh?

302
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:57,489
Keep moving. Let's go, keep moving.

303
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,829
Come on, sarge, we gotta catch up
with the tanks. Let's go!

304
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:04,436
Goodbye, Louise!

305
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,600
Put that in there.

306
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:12,439
Come on, get to it. Get to it.

307
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,944
Lion Battalion,
take up bombardment position.

308
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,384
Panther Battalion, stand by.

309
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:02,527
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

310
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:22,414
- Hold it. Where you running?
- The Germans are coming.

311
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:25,848
- Where's your rifle? Where's your outfit?
- Captured.

312
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:31,014
- Dead. Gone. They're all gone.
- Sergeant, stop that man!

313
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:34,252
He's not doing anything we aren't.

314
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:56,216
We're staying.

315
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,443
Countermand that order to fall back.

316
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:01,679
All units are to make a stand
where they are and fight.

317
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,723
And that means everybody.
Except tanks.

318
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,895
Clerks, cooks, bakers, staff officers.

319
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:11,463
Anybody who can carry a rifle
is to use it.

320
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:18,564
- Kiley.
- Come on, bring it all in.

321
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:25,177
It's very difficult for me to say this.
I was wrong.

322
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:37,122
- Sergeant, haul them out again.
- Everybody out.

323
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,589
Come on, what are you waiting for?

324
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,326
Well, it looks like we're staying.

325
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,557
- I never have a rifle when I need one.
- Take mine.

326
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,997
- It's on the house.
- I'll return it later.

327
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:51,103
- Let's go!
- Let's go. Come on.

328
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:55,508
We're on the line, sir.

329
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,111
General Grey speaking. Fred.

330
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,613
I'm holding at Amblève,
but I can't last without heavy stuff.

331
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,649
What can you let me have?

332
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,579
155s will do the trick.
Where are they? On flatcars.

333
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,657
Are we still holding the rail line?

334
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:14,727
Good.
Now, when can you get them here?

335
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,461
Well, not later, Fred.
We're counting on you.

336
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,621
Bring that ammo up!

337
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:07,666
Stack it up. Position, on the wall.

338
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,933
Get some beef behind it.

339
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,478
Hey, lay those logs in there.

340
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:26,919
Let's go! Let's move it out.

341
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,124
First Platoon, follow me.
Second Platoon, over there.

342
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,163
Fire.

343
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,017
Soldier!

344
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:33,744
Go! Go!

345
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:42,289
Everybody out!

346
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:45,397
- Wait a minute. Where you men going?
- To the shelter.

347
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:49,024
- No, you're not. Grab your rifles.
- But we're cooks.

348
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:52,502
Lunch is over.
Get your rifles and follow me.

349
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:59,573
- Stay away from the buildings!
- Soldier, up front.

350
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,578
I'm in the Air Corps.

351
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:04,149
You're in the infantry now. Follow me.

352
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,976
We're driving them back.
They're running.

353
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,880
This is only the first round.

354
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,684
Why have you stopped?

355
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,323
They have dug in.

356
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:53,221
- It's a very strong defense.
- Bypass it.

357
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:56,886
- I have considered that.
- There's nothing to consider.

358
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:03,265
We must measure what we might gain
by what we might lose.

359
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,739
Come on.

360
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:21,212
You were to have been 10 kilometers
west of Amblève by this hour.

361
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:22,719
Why are you still here?

362
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:26,017
My first attack failed.
I must take Amblève.

363
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:30,561
We are wasting time.
Time, Hessler, you don't have much.

364
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,791
Amblève is an isolated resistance.
Go around it.

365
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,267
We have surrounded
and bypassed Bastogne. Do the same.

366
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:40,532
General, it will be dark in one hour.

367
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:44,667
I want your permission
for a night assault with all my armor.

368
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,144
Colonel Hessler...

369
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,806
...you will break off this engagement,
proceed with your mission.

370
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:53,246
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,484
General, before you go,
may I show you something?

372
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:59,249
What is it?

373
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,265
A chocolate cake.

374
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,400
Well?

375
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:12,903
It was taken from a captured
American private. It's still fresh.

376
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:17,803
If you will look at the wrapping, general,
you will see it comes from Boston.

377
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:19,602
And?

378
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:23,478
General,
do you realize what this means?

379
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:26,515
It means that the Americans
have fuel and planes...

380
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,985
...to fly cake
across the Atlantic Ocean.

381
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:34,092
They have no conception of defeat.

382
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:38,329
We have the opportunity here
to break their morale...

383
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:41,161
...to destroy their will to fight.

384
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:45,166
That is why you must permit me
to reduce Amblève to ashes.

385
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:01,351
You have until 0400.

386
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:03,618
That is all.

387
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,368
We have silenced their guns.
Now we will attack.

388
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,566
Your infantry will go in with my tanks.

389
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:44,574
Yes, sir.

390
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:03,390
Second Platoon, over there.

391
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:05,054
Let's go. Move it out.

392
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:08,998
We'd better get going, sir, before
the town is completely surrounded.

393
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:14,232
Shall I send a runner to Major Wolenski
telling him to cover our withdrawal?

394
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:18,003
No, that's the kind of order I give
to a man myself.

395
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:49,769
Aim at the trench!

396
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,220
Some more. Let's get closer.

397
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:47,793
Bring up some more plastique!
