1
00:00:02,395 --> 00:00:05,364
Achtung!

2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:07,799
If you'd just stayed loose,

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:13,962
I could've gotten them all.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,416
Schnell, schnell!

5
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:31,182
Americans in headlong retreat.

6
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,383
Our forces are advancing on all fronts.

7
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:42,057
Great numbers of prisoners
are being taken.

8
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:19,772
Schnell!

9
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:39,949
I got a bad feeling about this.

10
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,153
If you wanted to make a run
for it, why didn't you?

11
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:46,730
I'm in your outfit, lieutenant.

12
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,992
My job is to look out for you.

13
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:53,138
Go where you go.

14
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,803
I sure got you into
the wrong place this time,

15
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:03,073
But I'm clad you're with me.

16
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:07,982
When we get to the P.O. W camp,
they'll separate us.

17
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:11,885
You being an officer.

18
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:15,061
Yeah.

19
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:21,534
I'm going to miss you, Sergeant.

20
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:42,054
Run!

21
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,358
Aah!

22
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:52,091
Aah!
Aah!

23
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:55,267
Aah!

24
00:02:59,072 --> 00:02:59,970
Keep going!

25
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,142
Ah.

26
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:07,996
Get going. Come on. Step on it.

27
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:22,517
Is she here?
No.

28
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:28,661
Well, tell her I'm back, huh?

29
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:36,960
I want you all to fan out.

30
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,400
Round up every man that
belongs to this outfit.

31
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:42,404
We'll assemble here in 10 minutes.
On the double!

32
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,578
Let's go!

33
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:57,621
What's all this?

34
00:04:57,824 --> 00:05:03,285
What's it look like?
My place of business.

35
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,858
What are the chickens for?

36
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:07,555
They lay eggs.

37
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,634
Have you any idea what fresh eggs
brings in these days?

38
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:14,238
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

39
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,379
Open the door. That's my partner.

40
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:26,344
Look, run down to the tank park
and check us both in.

41
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:30,546
Then report back to me. Go ahead.

42
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:33,749
The chickens look scrawny.
Have you been feeding them regular?

43
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,587
I was worried about you.

44
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,262
Is it true the Germans are coming?

45
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:38,521
Yeah, and right through here.

46
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,096
We got to sell everything fast.

47
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,994
Then you'll be leaving?

48
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,168
Let's face it, kid.

49
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:43,767
We're out of business.

50
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,599
One case of champagne $360.

51
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,207
Two dozen nylons $80.

52
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,504
20 bottles of perfume $200.

53
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:56,682
$640.

54
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,615
Here's your half.
320.

55
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,287
Now, what did you make?

56
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:05,491
$1,230. Here.

57
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:09,561
Oh?

58
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:12,356
What have you been selling?
I don't see much stock gone.

59
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,465
Take it.

60
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,429
No till I know how you made it.

61
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:19,662
What do you think I am?

62
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,807
It's money I've saved for us.

63
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,806
What are you talking about?

64
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,809
When a woman goes in
business with a man.

65
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,311
It means forever.

66
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,176
Hey, what's forever, kid?
The shop is closed.

67
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:33,614
The Germans are coming, hmm?

68
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,913
They've been here before.

69
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:37,987
I've lived through it.

70
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:44,130
I will live through it again.

71
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,290
I will wait for you.

72
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,504
Hey.

73
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,596
How can you feel this way about me?

74
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:56,400
I never laid a hand on you.

75
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:58,873
That's why.

76
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:04,038
You're in love with me.

77
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:05,542
Just a second, huh?

78
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:07,481
Hold the phone.

79
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:10,281
Hold the phone here.

80
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,459
Shup up!

81
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,909
You know what?

82
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:35,080
You're right.

83
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:39,146
Here. You hold all the money.

84
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:40,319
I got to go back in action.

85
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:41,918
You don't know what it's like in combat.

86
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,122
You know, you get shot.

87
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:44,221
Somebody takes all your money.

88
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,356
Before the plasma comes,

89
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:48,391
A guy's got his hand in your pocket.

90
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,563
Guffy. Guffy.

91
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,059
I don't want you to get killed.

92
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,894
Who's talking about getting killed?

93
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,468
You take care of the money.

94
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,002
Sarge, the tanks aren't there.

95
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:01,104
We got to catch up with them!

96
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:04,276
Guffy.

97
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:08,275
So long, partner.

98
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,675
Take care of yourself.

99
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:12,851
Guffy!

100
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:21,460
Don't you want to kiss me?

101
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:40,413
Don't forget to feed the chickens, huh?

102
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:44,341
Keep moving. Let's go. Keep moving.

103
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,279
Louise!

104
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:48,477
Come on, sarge. We got
to catch up with the tanks!

105
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:50,622
Let's go.

106
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:54,759
Goodbye, Louise!

107
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:58,455
Put that in there.

108
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:04,603
Come on. Get to it! Get to it!

109
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,797
Lion battalion, take up
bombardment position.

110
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:46,912
Panther battalion, stand by.

111
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:49,648
Get started.

112
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:52,818
Yes, sir.

113
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:09,833
Hold it, soldier.
Where are you running?

114
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:10,661
The Germans are coming.

115
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,064
Where's your rifle?

116
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:13,203
Where's your outfit?

117
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:17,172
Captured, dead, gone. They're all gone!

118
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:19,844
Sergeant, stop that man!

119
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,018
He's not doing anything we aren't.

120
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,034
We're staying.

121
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:47,001
Countermand that order to fall back.

122
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:47,865
From this moment.

123
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,167
All units are to make
a stand and fight.

124
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:53,106
And that means everybody,
except tanks.

125
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:56,611
Clerks, cooks, bakers, staff officers.

126
00:10:56,816 --> 00:11:02,755
Anybody who can carry a rifle is to
use it.

127
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,348
Kiley.

128
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:09,221
Come on. Bring it all in!

129
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:12,488
It's very difficult for me to say this.

130
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:15,667
I was wrong.

131
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,735
Sergeant, haul them out again!

132
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:29,540
Everybody out. What are you waiting for?

133
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:30,875
Well, Colonel,
it looks like we're staying.

134
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,051
I never seem to have a
rifle when I need one.

135
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:34,981
Take mine. It's on the house.

136
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,621
I'll return it later.

137
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:37,846
Let's go!

138
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:42,153
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

139
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:44,226
Corps on the line, sir.

140
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,261
General Grey speaking.

141
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,867
Fred, I'm holding at Ambleve,

142
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,898
But I can't last
long without heavy stuff.

143
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:54,163
Now, what can you let me have?

144
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,602
155 will do the trick.
Where are they?

145
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,903
On flat cars. Are we still
holding the rail line?

146
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:04,811
Good. Now, when can you get them here?

147
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:10,455
Well, not later, Fred.
We're counting on you.

148
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:47,826
Achtung, schumacher. Achtung, panzer.

149
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,282
Bring that ammo up!

150
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:53,713
Stock it up!

151
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,858
Replace that, on the wall!

152
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,420
Move the pigs in here!

153
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:08,567
Get some beef behind there!

154
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,897
Let's go!
Step it up!

155
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:17,701
Hurry up, damn it!

156
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:24,338
First platoon, follow me!
Second platoon, over there!

157
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:30,255
Fire.

158
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:20,735
Soldier!

159
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,909
Go! Go!

160
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,040
Everybody out!

161
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,115
Wait a minute. Where are you men going?

162
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,183
To the shelter.

163
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:36,286
No, you're not. Grab your rifles.

164
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,854
But we're cooks!

165
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:42,517
Lunch is over.
Get your rifles and follow me.

166
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:47,298
Come on, soldier, up front.

167
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:50,331
Leave him to the medics.
I'm in the air corps.

168
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:56,475
You're in the infantry now. Follow me.

169
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:37,082
Aah!

170
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,360
Aah! Aah!

171
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,366
We're driving them back.
They're running!

172
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:04,498
This is only the first round.

173
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,308
Why have you stopped?

174
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:40,501
They have dug in.
It's a very strong defense.

175
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,872
Bypass it.

176
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,810
I have considered that.

177
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:46,450
There's nothing to consider.

178
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:49,018
We must measure what we might gain

179
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:53,157
By what we might lose.

180
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,561
Jawohl.

181
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:06,997
You were to have been

182
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,868
10 kilometers west of
Ambleve by this hour.

183
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,406
Why are you still here?

184
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,807
My first attack failed.
I must take Ambleve.

185
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:16,345
We are wasting time.

186
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:19,108
Time, Hessler, you don't have much.

187
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:21,183
Ambleve is an isolated
pocket of resistance.

188
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:22,445
Go around it.

189
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,613
We have surrounded and
bypassed bastogne. Do the same!

190
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:29,191
General, it will be dark in one hour.

191
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:34,332
I want your permission for a
night assault with all my armor.

192
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:37,467
Colonel Hessler, you are to
break off this engagement

193
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,400
And proceed with your
mission. That's an order!

194
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:42,836
Yes sir.

195
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:43,872
General, before you go.

196
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:46,203
May I show you something?

197
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:49,314
What is it?

198
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:55,645
A chocolate cake.

199
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:57,048
Well?

200
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:59,281
It was taken from
a captured American private.

201
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,584
Still fresh.

202
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:03,728
If you look at the wrapping,
General,

203
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:06,591
You will see it comes from boston.

204
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,233
And?

205
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:12,302
General, do you realize what
this means?

206
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,302
It means that the Americans
have fuel and plans

207
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:19,637
To fly cake across the atlantic ocean.

208
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,076
They have no conception of defeat.

209
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:25,182
We have the opportunity here

210
00:20:25,384 --> 00:20:27,113
To break their morale,

211
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,913
To destroy their will to fight.

212
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,350
That is why you must permit me

213
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:37,496
To reduce Ambleve to ashes.

214
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:47,101
You have...

215
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:50,275
Until 0400.

216
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:53,578
That is all.

217
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,084
We have silenced their guns.

218
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,843
Now we will attack.

219
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:12,148
Your infantry will go in with my tanks.

220
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:15,326
Yes, sir.

221
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:32,809
Second platoon, over there!

222
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:34,637
Let's go! Move it out!

223
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:35,802
We'd better get going, sir,

224
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:39,142
Before the town is
completely surrounded.

225
00:22:39,351 --> 00:22:40,750
Shall I send a runner to Major wolenski

226
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:42,215
Telling him to cover
our withdrawal?

227
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:43,683
No.

228
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:49,293
That's the kind of
order I give to a man myself.

229
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:21,225
Aim at the tank!

230
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:09,507
Aim lower! Let's get closer!

231
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:20,318
Bring up some more plastic!

232
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,650
Major Wolenski!

233
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,720
The General.

234
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:03,828
Get in there! Hurry up!
Bring that ammo up.

235
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:06,395
Wolenski, we've been ordered out.

236
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:08,828
I'll need time to save what I can.

237
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:11,195
Your outfit will have to
cover the withdrawal.

238
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:12,870
They're coming down the chimney now.

239
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:13,867
Do what you can.

240
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:17,041
Come on.

241
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:21,544
I only loaned you this rifle.

242
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:23,647
See you later, Major.

243
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:26,818
Yes, sir.

244
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,458
Spread out.

245
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:54,144
Bring up the ammo!

246
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,016
Sister.

247
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:41,685
Colonel, excuse me.

248
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,946
We are looking for someone who can help.

249
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,384
Be brief.

250
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,582
There are many wounded
townspeople in the church cellar.

251
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,227
We need medicine, bandages.

252
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:52,896
Can you spare any?

253
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:54,963
We have nothing to spare.

254
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,725
If there are any captured
medical supplies,

255
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:58,368
Give them to the nuns.

256
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,506
Yes, sir. Follow me.

257
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,763
They've taken a beating,
and they look it.

258
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:34,768
They're not a rabble.

259
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:40,912
They're retreating like soldiers.

260
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,508
There's still fight in them.

261
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:48,277
Where are we going to stop
and put up the fight?

262
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:52,149
At our last line of defense...
the river Meuse.

263
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,190
We'll cross it and
dig in on the west bank.

264
00:28:55,393 --> 00:29:01,093
At least we'll get the Germans wet.

265
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,733
Still sore I pulled you out of Ambleve?

266
00:29:03,935 --> 00:29:06,699
I was contributing to the
war effort there, sir.

267
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:07,997
Try to keep your feet from freezing

268
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,300
While we figure a way to stop them.

269
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,636
They've made mistakes before.

270
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:17,781
Where have they made one this time?

271
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:23,955
Well, they got me mad at them.

272
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,756
Shut up. We'll get there.

273
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:34,932
Ah-choo!

274
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:40,631
Come on. Come on.

275
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:43,069
Keep moving! Keep moving!

276
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,539
What's holding you up?

277
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,679
I'm out of gas.
I reported low an hour ago.

278
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,575
Where the hell's the fuel truck?

279
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:53,114
Get off the road and wait for it.

280
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:54,444
Keep moving?

281
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:57,622
Move it over.

282
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:02,193
Come on!

283
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:06,259
Keep moving!

284
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:07,795
Keep moving!

285
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:10,968
Move it!

286
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:19,605
Hey!

287
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,778
Ow!

288
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:23,344
Where are you going?
Will you wait a minute?

289
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:26,517
I need gas!

290
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,921
Aw, get down.

291
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:36,059
Why, you ugly jerk!

292
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:50,300
Here. Use your big mouth on that.

293
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:56,447
Hey, come on. Let's get with it.

294
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:57,307
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

295
00:30:57,515 --> 00:31:00,177
What are you laughing at?
Help me with this thing.

296
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:01,283
You're all wet, sarge.

297
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:05,422
Now, get it up.

298
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:11,455
What are you going to do with this?

299
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,187
"What are you going to do with this?"

300
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:17,333
Siphon with it. Put it in.

301
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:18,536
What are you thinking?

302
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:20,671
Same thing you are.

303
00:31:20,872 --> 00:31:21,839
Those prisoners you brought in...

304
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:24,041
We found rubber hoses on them.

305
00:31:24,242 --> 00:31:26,142
Could they have been carrying those
to siphon gas?

306
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:29,040
I saw German fuel trucks drop
oil drums in the water.

307
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:32,410
And they floated.

308
00:31:32,617 --> 00:31:33,845
What the hell are you two talking about?

309
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:35,212
Gasoline, sir.

310
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,820
Empty fuel drums and men
carrying siphon hoses

311
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,353
Add up to one thing...

312
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:40,546
The Germans are low on gas.

313
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,487
They have to forage for it.

314
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:46,186
That's their weakness.

315
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,592
Get this off to headquarters.

316
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,596
Yes, sir.

317
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:54,738
A... What is the fuel consumption
of a tiger tank?

318
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:56,372
B... The exact distance

319
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:58,565
From the siegfried line to
the meuse river.

320
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:03,440
C... What is the estimate of
fuel reserves in the German army?

321
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:04,615
That's it.

322
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:08,785
Yes, sir. Right away.

323
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:16,060
What are you laughing at. You idiot?

324
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,763
What is the situation in bastogne?

325
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:27,096
Our forces have completely
encircled the americans.

326
00:32:27,305 --> 00:32:28,772
Their situation is hopeless.

327
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:34,946
They have no pecourse but to surrender.

328
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:37,511
Hey! Look what's coming.

329
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:40,684
Lieutenant!

330
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,099
Halt!

331
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:03,240
The German commander
wishes to communicate

332
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,408
With the american commander

333
00:33:04,642 --> 00:33:07,440
Of the encircled town of bastogne.

334
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,616
He's a little busy right now.
What's on your mind?

335
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:14,284
"From the German commanding General

You have one hour of truce to reply.

347

Blindfold him.

348
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:55,960
Take him up to the command post.

Repeat, please.

350
00:34:13,745 --> 00:34:15,610
Is that all?

351
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:21,752
Sir, I have a message from bastogne.

352
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:25,017
What is it?

353
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:29,159
I don't understand it.

354
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:33,197
"From the American commander of
Bastogne "To the German commander...

Hey. Over there.

358
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,742
Hey. It's an officer.

359
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:59,917
Boy, are we clad to see you.

360
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:01,483
We were out 12 hours. We got lost...

361
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:03,620
Hold it. Hold it. Wait a minute.

362
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:08,815
You think we should
surrender, Lieutenant?

363
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,620
Surrender?

364
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:14,798
No.

365
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,627
Just stay loose.

366
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:19,064
All of you, stay loose.

367
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:24,207
And give me that light.

368
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,410
All right. Spread out. Get some rest.

369
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,555
We'll get started when it's light.

370
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:06,411
General Grey.

371
00:37:06,617 --> 00:37:10,917
Sir, this just came in.

372
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:13,488
Any of you guys been to Ambleve?

373
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:14,157
Hey, wait a minute, mac.

374
00:37:14,392 --> 00:37:15,689
Will you wait a minute?

375
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:18,259
Listen to me. Anybody been to Ambleve?

376
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:19,327
Come on, Guffy. We'll get in trouble.

377
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,499
I got to know.

378
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:25,326
I've been to Ambleve.

379
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,434
You know the Ambleve inn?

380
00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:28,571
Yeah.
It's ok, isn't it?

381
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:34,712
There's nothing left of it.

382
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:40,083
Guffy, come on.

383
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:46,288
When are they going to let us fight?

384
00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:49,393
Let's go.

385
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,462
It's here, sir...

386
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:58,829
The information you
requested from headquarters.

387
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:00,526
That's it.

388
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,605
They're running out of gas.

389
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:06,743
Where's the spearhead of the
German advance right now?

390
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:11,005
We place it 4 miles past Ambleve,
moving west.

391
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:12,944
Where do you estimate they'll
be at daybreak?

392
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:14,379
If they travel all night.

393
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:18,453
They should be 9 miles due
east of the fuel depot.

394
00:38:18,656 --> 00:38:20,920
We'll be there to meet them.

395
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,821
I'm committing my tanks.

396
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:25,825
We'll use plan F.

397
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,759
Get me blue code 301.

398
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:29,364
301.

399
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,693
All right. Mount up.

400
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:36,363
Crank 'em up. Let's go. Let's go.

401
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:42,546
Let's go. Crank 'em up. Crank 'em up.

402
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:03,760
Look at that fog.

403
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,094
If it stays, we won't find them

404
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:08,067
And we won't fight.

405
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:11,708
If it lifts, they'll find us.

406
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:16,744
That'll be the end of our
men and our tanks.

407
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:21,612
And I'm praying that it lifts.

408
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,585
What does that make me, dan?

409
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,759
A general.

410
00:39:40,204 --> 00:39:42,502
Is that so, general?

411
00:39:42,707 --> 00:39:45,107
That's very interesting.

412
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:49,211
Thank you, general.

413
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:56,053
Our column has made
the farthest advance.

414
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:57,754
We have outrun the other panzers.

415
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:02,119
The eyes of Germany are on us.

416
00:40:02,326 --> 00:40:06,763
The fuhrer himself will decorate me.

417
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:09,489
We have done it, conrad!
We have done it.

418
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:13,101
Then I was wrong, we have won the war.

419
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:15,704
No.

420
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:17,807
You mean we have lost?

421
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:20,500
No.

422
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:24,772
I don't understand
If we have not won and we have not lost.

423
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:26,449
Then what's happening?

424
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:27,982
The best thing possibile is happening.

425
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,585
The war will go on.

426
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:31,720
For how long?

427
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:34,357
Indefinitely.

428
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:38,050
On and on and on.

429
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:39,991
But it must come to an end.

430
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:42,188
You're a fool, conrad.

431
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:43,422
Those of us who understood

432
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:47,695
Knew in 1941 we could never win.

433
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,499
You mean, Colonel,
For three years we have been fighting

434
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,972
Without any hope of victory?

435
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,145
There are many kinds of victory.

436
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:56,641
For the German army to survive,

437
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:59,509
For us to remain in uniform...

438
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:02,379
That is our victory.

439
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,451
Conrad.

440
00:41:04,655 --> 00:41:09,149
The world won't get rid of us after all.

441
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:13,090
But when do we go home?

442
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:17,097
This is our home.

443
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,235
And my sons?

444
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:21,302
When do I see them?

445
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:23,666
What will become of them?

446
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:26,866
They will become German soldiers,

447
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:33,050
And you will be proud of them.

448
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:38,345
Conrad.

449
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:39,886
Do you still have any
of those delicacies

450
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:41,922
You offered me at Ambleve?

451
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,457
Yes.

452
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:44,821
Yes, sir.

453
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:45,893
Prepare them for me, will you?

454
00:41:46,097 --> 00:41:51,967
I'm in very good appetite.

455
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:54,862
See anything?

456
00:41:55,106 --> 00:42:01,045
Nothing. It's like they disappeared.

457
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,113
They've been spotted yet?

458
00:42:03,347 --> 00:42:04,780
No, sir.

459
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:09,476
They must have changed
course during the night.

460
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,656
Call our scouts again.

461
00:42:19,797 --> 00:42:22,698
See anything?
Nothing.

462
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,800
Red river 6. Red river 6.

463
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,833
Scouted designated territory.

464
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:31,964
No sign of German tanks.

465
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:40,310
Can't see 20 yards.

466
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:45,217
They're nowhere around,
or I'd hear something.

467
00:42:45,423 --> 00:42:46,890
Now let's be reasonable, Colonel.

468
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:48,148
How can you expect me to take you up?

469
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:49,723
Nothing's flying in this fog.

470
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:50,723
That makes it safe.

471
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:52,793
We won't bump into another plane.

472
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:55,295
How can we sight the panzer column

473
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:56,431
With zero visibility?

474
00:42:56,634 --> 00:42:58,625
We'll catch pneumonia if
you don't stop arcuing.

475
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:01,269
Get behind that stick.

476
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:05,203
Where are the flying orders?

477
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:07,343
I want to see them.

478
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:10,571
I want to know what lunatic issued them.

479
00:43:10,815 --> 00:43:12,783
There are no orders, joe.

480
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:15,178
I'm the lunatic.

481
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:19,220
Well, there's no insanity in my family.

482
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,118
If we don't find that panzer column,

483
00:43:21,325 --> 00:43:22,724
There's going to be no tank battle.

484
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:24,417
We'll have to stop them with infantry.

485
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:28,393
A lot of guys will die to keep you safe.

486
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,830
You sure know how to hit below the belt.

487
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:34,300
We're not at a pillow fight, joe.

488
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:37,633
I'm sorry it hurts.

489
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:40,811
Get in.

490
00:43:43,814 --> 00:43:49,719
All reports negative, sir.

491
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:59,424
Well, they must be someplace.

492
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:05,159
The earth couldn't have
just swallowed them up.

493
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:06,835
Send out additional patrols.

494
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:10,006
Yes, sir.

495
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:19,238
What am I doing up here?

496
00:44:19,483 --> 00:44:21,678
It's like flying inside a light bulb.

497
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:23,786
Just stay on the course I gave you.

498
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:24,750
We'll find them.

499
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:25,751
How do you know?

500
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:28,117
Hessler's looking for gas.

501
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:29,917
He's gambling on capturing our supply.

502
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:31,389
Get lower.

503
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:33,062
We're down to 500 feet.

504
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:34,993
We just have to pick up a landmark.

505
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,961
There are hills all around.

506
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,499
We'll pick up a landmark in the kisser.

507
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:42,638
Try it a little lower.

508
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,481
I can't see a damn thing.

509
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:53,946
All right. Gut your engine.

510
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:55,049
Glide and listen.

511
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:57,516
We don't have to see them.
We can hear them.

512
00:44:57,721 --> 00:44:59,120
Glide at 200 feet?

513
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:05,262
Cut the talk and the engine.

514
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:21,405
I'm calling this off.

515
00:45:21,612 --> 00:45:27,551
Sure, now, let's try it acain.

516
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,655
Ok. Cut your engine.

517
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:36,322
If we were 100 feet higher,

518
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:37,551
I'd jump and leave you here.

519
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:40,764
Quiet.

520
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,975
There's the depot.

521
00:45:56,547 --> 00:45:59,641
There's the river.

522
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:04,480
The column has to be due south.

523
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:08,624
That's your course.

524
00:46:09,727 --> 00:46:14,926
Get her down, joe, where we can see.

525
00:46:15,132 --> 00:46:17,100
What's our altitude?

526
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:18,700
400 feet.

527
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:24,841
All right. Cut the engine.

528
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:31,041
Do you hear that?

529
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:37,187
Yeah. We're going down for a look.

530
00:46:45,796 --> 00:46:50,961
Hit your engine. Let's get out of here.

531
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:53,261
Red river 6, This is red river 2.

532
00:46:53,504 --> 00:46:54,528
Enemy column sighted.

533
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:59,038
Present position... map
coordinates 873144.

534
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:01,643
Enemy column sighted, sir.

535
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:04,780
Found them!

536
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:10,420
Present position... map
coordinates 873144.

537
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:19,129
Repeat. Enemy column sighted.

538
00:47:20,097 --> 00:47:21,257
Come in, red river 2.

539
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,932
Come in, red river 2.

540
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:24,600
Come in, red river 2.

541
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:26,099
Contact broken, sir.

542
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:26,962
Where's that coordinate?

543
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:28,433
Right here, sir.

544
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:29,105
Terrain?

545
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:31,103
Low, rolling hills.

546
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:33,299
Order our tanks to intercept
at that point.

547
00:47:33,544 --> 00:47:34,704
Yes, sir.

548
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:38,177
Red river 2? That's kiley.

549
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:41,317
I know.

550
00:47:42,286 --> 00:47:45,915
There's a plane up there.

551
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:50,025
He's in trouble.

552
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:05,403
Medic!

553
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:08,578
Medic!

554
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:30,700
Schneider.

555
00:48:30,968 --> 00:48:33,095
From spitsbergen. Weather forecast.

556
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:37,239
Warm front moving in.

557
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,566
Notify all columns...

558
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:43,143
Weather clearing.

559
00:48:59,696 --> 00:49:02,859
Enemy forces are reported
crossing the river meuse.

560
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:04,033
Send scouts forward.

561
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:05,599
I want numbers and composition.

562
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:07,202
Yes, sir.

563
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:08,371
Conrad.

564
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:11,541
My binoculars.

565
00:49:12,943 --> 00:49:15,912
Conrad?

566
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:27,254
I was saying I wanted...

567
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:29,483
What is it, conrad?

568
00:49:29,726 --> 00:49:32,695
Nothing, sir.

569
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:40,103
I was saying I wanted my binoculars.

570
00:49:42,506 --> 00:49:45,441
What's wrong?

571
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:51,380
I would like to be
transferred to other duties, sir.

572
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:55,317
What is the matter with you?

573
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,986
Don't ask me, sir.

574
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:59,655
Just transfer me.

575
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:00,983
For combat duty?

576
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:04,160
Yes, sir.

577
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:05,851
You want to fight?

578
00:50:06,096 --> 00:50:10,123
Very admirable, but why?

579
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:14,303
Personal reasons sir.

580
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:18,399
Personal reasons.

581
00:50:18,642 --> 00:50:22,806
Personal reasons... What
the devil are you trying to say?

582
00:50:23,013 --> 00:50:24,275
It is the right of every German soldier

583
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:28,713
To ask permission for a transfer
to other duties.

584
00:50:28,919 --> 00:50:30,910
It is the right of every
commanding officer

585
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,621
To know the reason for the transfer.

586
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:35,792
The truth...

587
00:50:37,227 --> 00:50:39,058
Is that I'm a fool.

588
00:50:39,263 --> 00:50:41,231
I believed in you.

589
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:44,229
But all you believe in is a war.

590
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:47,403
You have the war, you like the war,

591
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:48,866
And all I have are my sons,

592
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:51,836
And I don't want to lose them.

593
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:53,873
I'm not responsible for your children.

594
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:55,772
You would make them soldiers.

595
00:50:55,979 --> 00:50:57,173
Yes, and they'll fight.

596
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:58,678
And die.
In necessary.

597
00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:03,615
Necessary for who? For you?

598
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,685
You are not only a fool,

599
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:09,723
You are a traitor.

600
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:13,090
And you are a murderer.

601
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:15,527
You would murder my sons.

602
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:18,166
You would murder my country.

603
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:19,767
You would murder the whole world

604
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,907
To stay in that uniform.

605
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,349
Only the memory of you as a friend

606
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,518
Prevents me from having
you court-martialed.

607
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:38,688
Get out.

608
00:51:46,363 --> 00:51:51,266
Our scouts have sighted
a brigade of medium tanks.

609
00:51:51,468 --> 00:51:53,231
Light armor at this point?

610
00:51:53,437 --> 00:51:54,062
Any artillery?

611
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:55,135
None.

612
00:51:55,339 --> 00:51:56,670
And no infantry.

613
00:51:56,873 --> 00:51:58,135
They're committing their reserves.

614
00:51:58,342 --> 00:51:59,001
We destroy them.

615
00:51:59,209 --> 00:52:03,111
They have nothing between us
and the fuel depot.

616
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:04,678
Send all infantry to the rear.

617
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:07,850
Yes, sir.

618
00:52:08,085 --> 00:52:10,383
Diepel.

619
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:16,253
Assign this man to fuel trucks.

620
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,429
Yes, sir.

621
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:25,057
Sir, enemy advancing on our position.

622
00:52:25,302 --> 00:52:26,701
Good.

623
00:52:26,903 --> 00:52:30,134
They've taken the bait.

624
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,898
Pritchard.

625
00:52:32,142 --> 00:52:33,200
We're going to test that information

626
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:36,810
We got from headquarters.

627
00:52:37,014 --> 00:52:39,608
And if it's accurate,

628
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:45,117
We'll run them out of gas.

629
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:46,880
Tiger to all units.

630
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:48,352
Close hatches.

631
00:52:48,558 --> 00:52:51,527
Forward.

632
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:51,184
Butcher, swing up and take
positions on the ridges.

633
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:53,583
Watch that damn gully.

634
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:59,729
This is no time to lose a track.

635
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:28,557
Here they come.

636
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:39,803
Hold your fire till they're right on us.

637
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,264
Load with hypershot.

638
00:54:41,471 --> 00:54:45,407
Make every one count.

639
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,548
Hold your fire.

640
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:55,183
How long?

641
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:59,321
Until I tell you!

642
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:02,854
We will attack in staggered formation.

643
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:09,931
First... lion on the assault.
Second... panther.

644
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:11,031
Remember, hold your fire

645
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:17,173
Till they're within effective range.

646
00:55:22,078 --> 00:55:23,511
How long we going to wait?

647
00:55:23,713 --> 00:55:26,079
Until we can hit a soft spot.

648
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:28,046
Steady...

649
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:29,445
Steady...

650
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:30,915
Hold it...

651
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:32,053
Hold it...

652
00:55:32,255 --> 00:55:34,450
Let them come on in.

653
00:55:34,658 --> 00:55:35,590
That's the way.

654
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:39,728
Now! Let them have it!

655
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:07,011
Fire one more round,

656
00:56:07,257 --> 00:56:13,196
Then let's get off this ridge.

657
00:56:21,538 --> 00:56:26,669
There's one coming over the rise.
See him?

658
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:28,504
Steady, boy.

659
00:56:28,712 --> 00:56:31,272
Ready on...

660
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:34,483
Fire!

661
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,017
Tiger to panther, spread out left.

662
00:56:46,263 --> 00:56:47,787
Lion, spread out right.

663
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:53,970
We'll try to encircle them.

664
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:56,670
Sherman damaged.

665
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:58,534
We'll finish it off.

666
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:00,801
Fire!

667
00:57:01,044 --> 00:57:03,069
It's a hit!

668
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:07,249
Next, 11:00, 900.

669
00:57:11,187 --> 00:57:11,881
Get in among them

670
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:19,551
So they can't fire without
hitting each other.

671
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:26,263
Butcher-1...

672
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:27,265
This is butcher-3.

673
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,233
There's a kraut at 1:00

674
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:33,102
With a pennant on his antenna.

675
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,904
This one belongs to me. He's mine.

676
00:57:36,146 --> 00:57:38,011
There he is.

677
00:57:38,214 --> 00:57:39,772
All right. Kick a left, Kid. Left!

678
00:57:40,016 --> 00:57:41,745
Now hard right!

679
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:44,910
Hard right!

680
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:47,184
Stay with him.

681
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,620
Range, 9-0-0.

682
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:51,623
Up 2.

683
00:57:51,828 --> 00:57:54,797
Fire!

684
00:57:55,298 --> 00:57:57,232
Good shot! We got him!

685
00:57:57,434 --> 00:57:58,765
Load again.

686
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:00,368
Nothing has happened.

687
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,662
Watch it. They see us.

688
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:05,841
Let's get out of here!

689
00:58:07,077 --> 00:58:13,016
Aim just ahead as he runs.

690
00:58:16,553 --> 00:58:19,522
Fire!

691
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,393
Butcher-1, this is butcher-3. over.

692
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,931
Come in. Report damage, over.

693
00:58:32,135 --> 00:58:34,865
I've got... one dead

694
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:35,969
And two wounded,

695
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:38,970
But we can still fight.

696
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:39,971
You lost your gun.

697
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:42,576
Try to make it to the
assembly area. Over.

698
00:58:42,779 --> 00:58:45,247
We don't need a gun! We'll ram them!

699
00:58:45,482 --> 00:58:47,541
Guffy, you're all busted up.

700
00:58:47,784 --> 00:58:50,218
Get out of there
Get to the assembly area.

701
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,048
That's an order! Out!

702
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:57,192
Get her over the hill.

703
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:02,296
Driver, halt.

704
00:59:02,499 --> 00:59:04,228
Let's try to pick them off.

705
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:05,958
10:00...

706
00:59:06,202 --> 00:59:07,726
Sherman 800...

707
00:59:07,971 --> 00:59:10,940
Fire!

708
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:50,408
Baker battalion reporting in.

709
00:59:50,613 --> 00:59:52,137
Two tanks destroyed, one damaged,

710
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:53,815
Out of action.

711
00:59:54,017 --> 00:59:56,281
Phantom battalion reports
six tanks destroyed,

712
00:59:56,486 --> 00:59:57,976
Nine out of action.

713
00:59:58,221 --> 01:00:01,054
Butcher battalion reports
11 tanks destroyed,

714
01:00:01,257 --> 01:00:04,226
Eight on fire.

715
01:00:05,495 --> 01:00:11,434
Keep burning up their gas.

716
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:20,342
Commander to base.

717
01:00:20,577 --> 01:00:25,514
I am returning to refuel.

718
01:01:10,326 --> 01:01:12,487
We are cutting them to pieces.

719
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:18,634
And they are emptying our tanks.

720
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:21,436
They are deliberately sacrificing
their armor

721
01:01:21,638 --> 01:01:25,574
To bleed us dry.

722
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:27,402
What is the distance to the fuel depot?

723
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:30,204
12 kilometers.

724
01:01:30,446 --> 01:01:32,437
You will continue the battle here.

725
01:01:32,682 --> 01:01:35,651
Let them-believe their
strategy is succeeding.

726
01:01:35,885 --> 01:01:38,786
I want 15 tanks and all
the empty trucks.

727
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:40,216
I'm going on to the depot.

728
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:43,221
Yes, sir.

729
01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:47,328
All right. Forward.

730
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:10,642
Hey, come on, soldier.
You can make it.

731
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:18,652
Hey! Hey! Stop!

732
01:02:18,895 --> 01:02:20,453
Pull it off the road!

733
01:02:20,697 --> 01:02:25,634
All right! Hey, com on!

734
01:02:27,437 --> 01:02:28,495
Pull it off the road!

735
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:31,707
Pull it off...

736
01:02:33,076 --> 01:02:34,941
Get off the tank!

737
01:02:35,144 --> 01:02:37,135
Stay off the tank!

738
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,847
You got room. You can carry these guys.

739
01:02:39,048 --> 01:02:40,879
This tank ain't going no place.

740
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:44,212
Get off the tank!

741
01:02:44,454 --> 01:02:46,319
Wherever you're going,
you'd better walk.

742
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:47,284
Why wait here?

743
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:49,321
I'm waiting for the Germans.

744
01:02:49,525 --> 01:02:53,154
They got to come by here.

745
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:56,365
And I still got a machine gun.

746
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:58,466
Not much you can do with that.

747
01:02:58,668 --> 01:03:00,135
How much ammo's left?

748
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,769
Two belts.

749
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:05,998
That'll take care of some of them.

750
01:03:06,242 --> 01:03:07,436
You got a wounded man.

751
01:03:07,644 --> 01:03:11,011
You think you ought to get
him to the medics?

752
01:03:11,214 --> 01:03:12,681
Ah, he's not too bad.

753
01:03:12,882 --> 01:03:15,180
He can still fight.

754
01:03:15,385 --> 01:03:16,818
Get on, fellas.

755
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,921
Head this tank due west
to the river meuse.

756
01:03:20,123 --> 01:03:21,681
I'm warning you, Lieutenant.

757
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:25,860
Stay off my tank!

758
01:03:28,498 --> 01:03:34,926
Either put up that gun or
fire it, Sergeant.

759
01:03:37,874 --> 01:03:42,811
It's ok, sarge. It's ok.

760
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:19,470
General, another panzer
column's been spotted

761
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:20,978
4 miles from the river meuse.

762
01:04:21,184 --> 01:04:24,676
Where did they come from?

763
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:26,718
Contact the officer in
charge of the fuel depot.

764
01:04:26,923 --> 01:04:29,483
Get silver cloud 201, quickly.

765
01:04:29,726 --> 01:04:33,162
It's not a new column.

766
01:04:33,396 --> 01:04:34,863
It's hessler.

767
01:04:35,098 --> 01:04:36,622
He slipped away from the battle.

768
01:04:36,866 --> 01:04:39,130
Fuel depot, sir.

769
01:04:39,335 --> 01:04:40,632
General Grey speaking.

770
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:43,032
I'm giving you this order personally.

771
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:45,434
Destroy the fuel depot at once.

772
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:46,505
I repeat.

773
01:04:46,709 --> 01:04:48,768
Destroy the fuel depot at once.

774
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:50,444
Yes, sir.

775
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:52,204
I'll destroy the depot immediately, sir.

776
01:04:52,448 --> 01:04:54,313
Set it on fire.

777
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:56,348
No, sir. Not a drop.

778
01:04:56,552 --> 01:04:57,348
I'll make sure, sir.

779
01:04:57,553 --> 01:05:01,489
They won't get a drop.

780
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:03,447
Let's get these bodies out of here.

781
01:05:03,693 --> 01:05:07,629
Let's go. Move!

782
01:05:24,113 --> 01:05:27,844
Llk and eisen report
fuel exhaustion, sir.

783
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,984
What's hessler's present position?

784
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:31,244
He reports being 3 kilometers

785
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:33,580
From the American fuel depot.

786
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:36,087
We must get there.

787
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:38,283
He will do it.

788
01:05:38,528 --> 01:05:42,464
Hessler will do it.

789
01:05:53,543 --> 01:05:54,601
No shooting.

790
01:05:54,844 --> 01:05:56,334
I'll do the talking.

791
01:05:56,579 --> 01:06:00,515
Get back to your post.

792
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,145
Hold it up there, Sergeant.

793
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:07,356
Hold it!

794
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:08,522
What can I do for you?

795
01:06:08,724 --> 01:06:10,316
Could you fill her up?

796
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,390
Sure.

797
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:14,563
I'll give you a hand, soldier.

798
01:06:14,797 --> 01:06:17,197
Corporal, bring some of
those cans over here.

799
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,334
You boys help out, will you?

800
01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:23,972
Sergeant, we'll have you
cassed up in no time.

801
01:06:24,207 --> 01:06:26,437
Get on your machine gun.

802
01:06:26,642 --> 01:06:28,269
Hey, uh, Lieutenant.

803
01:06:28,511 --> 01:06:30,809
Yeah.

804
01:06:31,013 --> 01:06:32,446
Weren't you directing traffic

805
01:06:32,648 --> 01:06:34,809
At the our river bridge?

806
01:06:35,017 --> 01:06:42,446
Does the Ambleve road still
lead to malmedy?

807
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,309
Stop.

808
01:07:06,415 --> 01:07:12,354
This fuel dump must be taken intact.

809
01:07:13,556 --> 01:07:16,491
No shooting.

810
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:36,242
Hey, look.
Let's get out of here.

811
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:37,434
Hold it.

812
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,408
They'll capture the gas.

813
01:07:38,614 --> 01:07:42,414
We can't just leave it.

814
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:43,812
Come on, Lieutenant. Let's go.

815
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:44,782
Hold it!

816
01:07:44,987 --> 01:07:48,753
They're after the gas.

817
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,255
We ought to blow it up.

818
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:52,427
We can't do that.

819
01:07:52,662 --> 01:07:54,630
We got no orders, Lieutenant.

820
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,389
Well, I'm giving the orders.

821
01:07:57,633 --> 01:08:03,071
Hey, Lieutenant!
One of them's still alive.

822
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:08,302
Hold it! He's one of ours.

823
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:09,636
I got you, Colonel.

824
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:10,504
Burn it!

825
01:08:10,746 --> 01:08:12,179
Easy, sir. I know.

826
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:13,211
Burn it!

827
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:14,610
Give him a hand.

828
01:08:14,817 --> 01:08:16,216
Burn it!

829
01:08:16,419 --> 01:08:19,217
Come on! I'm waiting for you!

830
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:20,946
Come on!

831
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,021
Get those barrels off
the end of that ramp.

832
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:24,556
Hold your fire, guffy!

833
01:08:24,794 --> 01:08:28,093
Move behind that pile till
I tell you to shove.

834
01:08:28,297 --> 01:08:34,236
Get me some hand grenades off the tank.

835
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:42,572
Get to that gas truck and
open all the valves.

836
01:08:42,812 --> 01:08:47,715
Then get the hell away.

837
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:14,409
All right. Roll them down!

838
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,043
Get off the road.

839
01:09:16,245 --> 01:09:21,182
Give me a hand grenade.

840
01:09:47,343 --> 01:09:50,312
Aah!

841
01:10:13,202 --> 01:10:17,138
He's getting away.

842
01:10:20,776 --> 01:10:23,745
Ok, shove!

843
01:10:32,188 --> 01:10:33,450
Don't stop!

844
01:10:33,656 --> 01:10:38,593
Keep going! Don't stop!

845
01:12:11,487 --> 01:12:13,182
Get this message through
to headquarters.

846
01:12:13,389 --> 01:12:15,152
They've abandoned their tanks.

847
01:12:15,357 --> 01:12:21,296
And they're walking back to Germany
