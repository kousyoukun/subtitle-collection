1
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,604
December, 1944.

2
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,771
British and American armies
were on the threshold of victory.

3
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,112
Stretched across half of Europe,
the Allies gathered themselves...

4
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,120
... for the final assault on Germany.

5
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,723
To the north
stood Montgomery's Eighth Army...

6
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:06,360
... to the south, Patton's Third.

7
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,224
In the center, along an 88-mile front...

8
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:14,630
... a few battle-weary American divisions
rested in a quiet sector.

9
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,901
To them, the war seemed already won.

10
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,870
This is their story.

11
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,137
We've been flying over these woods
all week.

12
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,338
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.

13
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:30,144
- Getting hungry, Joe?
- The war is over.

14
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,686
I hear GHQ is cutting orders
to ship us home for Christmas.

15
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:36,825
The German army still has
6 million men carrying arms.

16
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,859
I haven't heard they're going home
for Christmas.

17
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:44,429
Hey, there it is...

18
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:47,365
...the German army.

19
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:50,834
Let's go down and have a look.

20
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:59,578
- Buzz him again. I wanna get a picture.
- Okay.

21
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,776
This time, gun your engine.
Make him look up.

22
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:28,299
It worked.

23
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,935
Swing around.
I wanna get another one.

24
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,982
Conrad.

25
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,147
I am ashamed of you.

26
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,022
Get up.

27
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,028
They could have killed us, sir.

28
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,030
If you'd taken the pains
to have looked carefully...

29
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:31,000
...you would have observed it was
an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

30
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,368
You would stay in the car if it were
a fighter plane shooting at us.

31
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:39,268
I did not lose a war to die
in the back seat of a car.

32
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,506
Does the colonel think any of us
has a choice where we will die?

33
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:48,245
I know where you'll die, Conrad,
at home, in your own bed.

34
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,515
Is the colonel trying to get rid of me?

35
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:57,225
I think that the world is going
to get rid of both of us.

36
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,760
Pick up your cap! Put it on.

37
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:03,529
Try to look like a soldier!

38
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,737
What good is a soldier anyhow?

39
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:09,137
He wins, he loses.

40
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,802
What's he good for anyhow?

41
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,606
Conrad, I've told you before...

42
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,751
...never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.

43
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,284
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,547
It won't happen again.

45
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:41,572
Looks like something on the ground
at 10 o'clock. Let's take a look.

46
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,420
Nothing.

47
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,579
Let's go home.

48
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,712
Herr Oberst Hessler is here.

49
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,965
- Colonel Hessler, sir.
- Yes.

50
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:48,265
Well, Hessler.

51
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,739
It has been a long time.

52
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:53,240
How good it is to see you again.

53
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,646
You look the same.

54
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:56,974
Little...

55
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:58,479
Little leaner perhaps.

56
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:03,553
The Russian front does not put meat
on a man's bones, general.

57
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:07,453
Ah, yes. War is hard on all of us.

58
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:10,760
- Central heating.
- Yeah.

59
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,454
Crystal chandeliers.

60
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,729
You have a nice cellar.

61
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:18,597
Field Marshal Goring
gave me that painting.

62
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,965
Lovely, isn't it?

63
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:29,202
I imagine he found a bargain
in Paris last year.

64
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:32,147
My corporal's waiting.
He's had a hard drive.

65
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:36,310
Do you suppose there's somewhere
in these ruins he can find a bed?

66
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:38,988
Sit down, Hessler.

67
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:45,155
You have too little faith
in the genius of the German people.

68
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,799
A few stones
have been knocked down...

69
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:53,029
...but our country's strong,
united, determined...

70
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,296
...and more productive than ever.

71
00:13:55,476 --> 00:14:00,879
The Allies think that their constant
air raids have undermined our morale.

72
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:04,278
- This they'll never do.
- Why have you sent for me, general?

73
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:10,290
You are our finest
panzer commander, Hessler.

74
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,152
You will lead us to victory.

75
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:14,820
Our Germany is now like an iceberg.

76
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:19,331
Only a fraction of it
can be seen on the surface.

77
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:23,229
Let me show you some of the results...

78
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,771
...of what Germany
has produced underground.

79
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,006
You will discover a new Germany...

80
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:33,841
...and will take a new pride
in being a German.

81
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:36,407
Our latest airplane.

82
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,017
A jet.

83
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:41,178
It flies at more than 900 kilometers
per hour.

84
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:44,587
Within six months,
we will have enough jet fighters...

85
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:48,229
...to shoot down every
Allied plane in the air.

86
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:52,757
Our V-1 rocket destroyed
20 percent of London.

87
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:57,337
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

88
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:02,941
The new 70-ton King Tiger tank.

89
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:07,442
It has two-and-a-half times
the firepower...

90
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,847
...and double the armor
of the American tanks.

91
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:15,948
Our Germany is far
from finished, Hessler.

92
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:21,119
It's a very beautiful model, general.

93
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:26,531
It proves that the Germans
are still the world's best toy makers.

94
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:32,470
The toys we are making these days
are not for children.

95
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:35,940
Let me show them to you.

96
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:59,394
Hands up! Get on over.

97
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,630
Hold it! Put them up! Stand against
the wall. Put them up, general.

98
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,108
Well, boys...

99
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:09,006
...looks like we've caught ourselves
a couple of big fish.

100
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:13,617
- One nice, fat Kraut trout.
- That's enough, now.

101
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:20,281
Sorry, general.
We are just rehearsing a commando raid.

102
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,924
Very good.

103
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,617
Not bad, Hessler, huh?

104
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,097
Had you fooled, didn't they?

105
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,129
Completely.

106
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,325
Unfortunately,
I am beyond playing games.

107
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:34,801
Oh, this is no game.

108
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:38,100
These are German soldiers, all of them.

109
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:41,006
Trained German soldiers.

110
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:46,377
Diepel commands the panzer grenadiers
attached to the 1 st Tank Brigade.

111
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:49,781
These men will work with him.

112
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:53,117
Major Diepel, kindly explain
Operation Transit to the colonel.

113
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:57,057
The soldiers will be parachuted
behind the American lines.

114
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:01,164
Their mission:
To disrupt enemy communications.

115
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,960
We have organized many such teams.

116
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:09,300
Each will be led by a man who has
actually lived in America.

117
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:12,568
Schumacher here lived
in Texas for 12 years...

118
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:15,338
...before returning to the fatherland.

119
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,347
Tell me, lieutenant,
who is your favorite baseball player?

120
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,884
- Lou Gehrig.
- Because he's hit the most home runs?

121
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:26,355
No, sir. Babe Ruth hit
the most home runs, 60 in 1927.

122
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:29,359
And what's your opinion
of Adolf Hitler?

123
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:35,261
As an American, my opinion
would be offensive to these gentlemen.

124
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:39,904
Come, lieutenant. As an American officer,
you care nothing for German opinion.

125
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,507
Adolf Hitler is a crazy,
Austrian housepainter.

126
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,115
He's a madman who thinks he knows
more than the whole general's staff.

127
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:54,412
And he's leading Germany
to complete, total destruction.

128
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:58,188
Perhaps you are going too far.

129
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:03,557
To carry off this great deception,
even their reflexes must be American.

130
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:09,190
Your reflexes are to be congratulated,
lieutenant.

131
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,009
Insolent man.

132
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,911
Let him have his fun now.

133
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,913
If he is captured,
he will be shot as a spy.

134
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,381
And if he survives,
he can be shot as a traitor.

135
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,220
You must admit, we are very thorough.

136
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:42,430
Even a pass won't get you through here.

137
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:25,635
We will attack
through the Losheim Gap.

138
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,113
It's defended only by a single battalion.

139
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:32,810
The American division
on the Schnee Eifel will be cut off.

140
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:35,684
Then the Our River Bridge
will be in our hands.

141
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:40,184
From there, on to Amblêve,
with its road network.

142
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:44,889
In four days, we will be across
the River Meuse.

143
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:47,669
The strategic objective?

144
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,361
Antwerp.

145
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:54,174
By taking Antwerp, we split
the enemy forces in two.

146
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,239
It will take them 18 months to recover.

147
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,910
By then, we will have air superiority
with our jet engines.

148
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,418
And we will have even more
significant weapons.

149
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:10,389
Weapons which can destroy
an entire city with a single blast.

150
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:14,522
You have forgotten
one important detail, general.

151
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:18,759
With their present control of the air,
the Allies will smash our tanks...

152
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:21,598
...machine-gun our troops,
bomb the bridges...

153
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:24,501
...and cut our communications.

154
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:29,543
Suppose I tell you there will be
no Allied planes.

155
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:33,276
Another secret weapon?

156
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:36,244
From Spitzbergen, Norway...

157
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,388
...the northernmost weather station
in the world.

158
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,720
We have been waiting two months
for this report.

159
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:47,228
"A low-pressure area over northern
Europe, starting December 16th.

160
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:51,300
Low clouds and fog
which will ground all aircraft."

161
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:54,900
- How long?
- Long enough...

162
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:57,540
...if we keep strictly to our timetable.

163
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:01,936
Unusual clock, isn't it?

164
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,647
It has only one cycle.

165
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,180
Fifty hours.

166
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:11,449
We have the resources
for 50 hours, full-scale attack.

167
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:17,490
Maps, clocks, toys.

168
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:20,787
But with what will I fight?

169
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,730
Colonel Hessler...

170
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:27,132
...l'm putting you in command
of our armored spearhead.

171
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:10,310
It can be done.

172
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,514
This came in from SHAEF.

173
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:45,914
I got a Christmas cake
from home today.

174
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:49,249
- Think I'll still be here to eat it?
- Send this right through.

175
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:52,258
Develop this. Bring me the prints
as soon as they come out.

176
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:53,918
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Kiley.

177
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,562
Find any Germans under
your bed this morning?

178
00:22:56,731 --> 00:23:00,928
Marching around under there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.

179
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,067
That's an order.

180
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:08,265
I want every item on that menu delivered
to every soldier in the division...

181
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:10,934
...especially those
in the forward positions.

182
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:14,445
And I want them delivered
in time for Christmas dinner.

183
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:18,913
Counterintelligence picked
this up from an enemy agent.

184
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,054
Dated November 29th.

185
00:23:21,223 --> 00:23:24,282
"From Field Marshal Keitel. Most secret.

186
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,589
Officers and men who speak English
are wanted for special mission.

187
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:32,563
Volunteers will report
to General Kohler's headquarters."

188
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:35,430
- What do you make of it?
- You know my opinion.

189
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:38,231
This is one more confirmation.
They're going to attack.

190
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:40,840
Oh, come on, Kiley, not that again.

191
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:45,445
They're probably preparing a fifth column
to drop behind our lines.

192
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:48,272
Were you
in the State Department too, Kiley?

193
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:51,477
I thought your experience
was limited to police work.

194
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:57,221
Having been an inspector of police
doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

195
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,224
All cops aren't flatfoots.

196
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,291
Your limited military experience...

197
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:04,956
...doesn't inspire confidence
in your conclusions. If you think...

198
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:08,103
Why do you keep saying
they're mounting an offensive?

199
00:24:10,006 --> 00:24:13,168
I spent 20 years before the war
asking questions.

200
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:16,174
Ever since D-day,
you've had me doing the same thing...

201
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,643
...interrogating prisoners.

202
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:20,941
I can only report what I've learned.

203
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:25,144
The German soldier facing us
is still an undefeated enemy.

204
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:27,449
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.

205
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:29,648
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

206
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,451
I have 10 other officers in my section.

207
00:24:33,631 --> 00:24:37,931
We see the same information,
get the same facts as you, Kiley.

208
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:42,197
All of us come up with one answer, you
come up with the complete opposite.

209
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:45,203
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
you'd better lie down.

210
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,809
Colonel Pritchard,
you may be my superior officer...

211
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:49,842
He is.

212
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:52,945
Excuse me.
Here are the prints you wanted.

213
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,549
Thank you.

214
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,513
Look what showed up on this one.

215
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,183
I took it over the Ardennes.

216
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:09,924
Is this a Tiger tank, or isn't it?

217
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:12,998
So it appears.

218
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:15,297
One tiger doesn't make a jungle, sir.

219
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,741
I expect tigers in jungles. When I discover
one in a peaceful neighborhood...

220
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:23,242
...I recommend all of us
take a good look under our beds.

221
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:25,177
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:36,992
Step outside.

223
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,104
With your permission, sir.

224
00:25:56,915 --> 00:25:59,382
This is from headquarters, Kiley.
Top-secret.

225
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:03,749
The Third Army has been ordered
to attack the Germans in the Saar.

226
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:07,220
General Patton is launching
the offensive in two days.

227
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:08,882
Does it seem possible...

228
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:12,690
...headquarters would commit an entire
army to an offensive in the south...

229
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:16,596
...if there were any possibility of the
Germans attacking in the Ardennes?

230
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:22,730
With all due respect to headquarters,
they could be wrong.

231
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:25,974
Send this to headquarters anyway.

232
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:28,306
There seem to be new features
on that tank.

233
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:29,812
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

234
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:32,712
Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown
on this German officer.

235
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:37,750
- All right, send this along.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,285
Get up to the line and tell them
to grab some new prisoners.

237
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:45,626
- I'm interested in any fresh information.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,256
One thing more. What are
you doing in a reconnaissance plane?

239
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:52,269
We're not paying you
to be a combat soldier.

240
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,465
- Trying to shorten the war by yourself?
- No, sir.

241
00:26:55,643 --> 00:27:00,636
Just wanna make sure I can enjoy
that nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

242
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,022
I see the colonel's
in fine appetite again.

243
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:16,857
I am.

244
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,692
Join me in a glass of wine.

245
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,630
Thank you, sir.

246
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:25,504
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

247
00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:38,382
Conrad.

248
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:41,713
Speak.

249
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:45,355
What does the colonel wish me to say?

250
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:47,722
Speak your mind, the truth.

251
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:53,164
Don't be afraid, Conrad. I must have
someone to tell me the truth.

252
00:27:56,606 --> 00:28:02,237
I've always been fortunate
to serve under brilliant men...

253
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:04,742
...who know everything.

254
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:07,848
From them, I've learned one thing:

255
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:13,352
When all was lost,
these brilliant men never lost hope.

256
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:16,184
I admire that.

257
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,994
What else do you admire
about these men?

258
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,224
The illusion.

259
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:28,727
Maybe I'm not using
the right word, colonel.

260
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:31,497
I'm not an educated man.

261
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:35,742
The hope that there is
always one more chance.

262
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:39,140
That is the illusion.

263
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,150
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

264
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,387
It's not my place
to speak of such things.

265
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,959
Go on.

266
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:55,261
I order you to.

267
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,861
Colonel...

268
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:04,202
...this new command is an illusion.

269
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:06,769
Give it up.

270
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,308
I am Martin Hessler.

271
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:15,812
Four years ago,
my panzers overran Poland in one week.

272
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:18,112
That was no illusion.

273
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:22,123
In 39 days, my tanks smashed all
the way to Paris. That was no illusion.

274
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:25,294
I conquered the Crimea.
That was no illusion.

275
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,157
Today...

276
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,733
...I was given a brigade of Tiger tanks.

277
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,770
When I have a brigade of tanks...

278
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,464
...that is reality.

279
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,939
And who will drive your tanks?

280
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,081
The men you led were soldiers.
Veteran soldiers.

281
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,080
Are there any left?

282
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,151
What will they give you now?

283
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,685
I was by your side
in Poland, France, Crimea.

284
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,846
Look at me, colonel,
I'm not the same man.

285
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:58,018
I jumped in a ditch today at the sight
of an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

286
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,754
My two boys remember me
as a good soldier.

287
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,627
They wouldn't believe it.

288
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,428
But, colonel, I am not the only one.

289
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:11,268
How sure can you be of the men
who will drive your tanks?

290
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,650
Major Diepel?

291
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,291
- Diepel.
- Yep.

292
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:32,826
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assembled at once.

293
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:37,265
Conrad, my boots.

294
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,279
Your commanders, sir.

295
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:12,833
Boys. Too many boys.

296
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:16,566
The first battle will turn them into men.

297
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,109
In the old days,
I lived six months with my men...

298
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:23,374
...before going into action. I knew them,
they knew me. These are strangers.

299
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:25,042
Too many boys.

300
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,015
They have never tasted defeat.

301
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:29,952
Do they know what is expected of them?

302
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,252
They are ready to die for you.

303
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:36,022
Can you ask more?

304
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,208
Sing.

305
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:38,044
Louder.

306
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,569
Hold it. Hold it.

307
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:06,972
Hold it. Hold it.

308
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,448
Pull up. We got brass on our tail.
Take it...

309
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:13,586
Pull it forward, you idiot!

310
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:16,821
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!

311
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,654
Just a little bit. Hold it.

312
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:25,525
Hold it! Hold it!

313
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,689
You're dropping my merchandise!

314
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:30,028
Barrel and Eddie,
come on out of there.

315
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,331
Come on, Cortland.

316
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:37,110
Disaster.

317
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:41,913
Solid. Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

318
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:44,743
- Complain to my union.
- Yeah, go ahead, tie it up.

319
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:47,079
- We near enemy territory yet?
- Too near.

320
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:49,245
- Give me a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

321
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:51,482
Sarge, when will we see
some Germans?

322
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,092
- Barrel?
- Smoke your own.

323
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:54,591
Got a cigarette, Eddie?

324
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:57,060
- You kidding?
- You cheapskates.

325
00:35:57,231 --> 00:35:59,893
Reach into my bag,
get me a carton of cigarettes.

326
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,898
What's with you and the Germans?

327
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,162
Nothing. I just ain't never seen one.

328
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,831
You know, I've never
even seen a German plane.

329
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,499
Sarge, when are we
gonna get in the action?

330
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:12,202
What are you, some kind of a nut?

331
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,939
What kind of replacements
they sending us, huh?

332
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,876
"I wanna see action."

333
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,715
- What's this?
- Put that back. That's merchandise.

334
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,380
Don't tell me there's women
where we're going.

335
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,255
- Who are you gonna give these to?
- Guffy don't give nothing.

336
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:30,055
- He's peddling them.
- You keep tying it up.

337
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:32,792
- Peddling them? To who?
- The boys in the front.

338
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:36,870
They're gonna need that in Germany.
There's lots of broads there.

339
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:40,773
- French perfume.
- Champagne.

340
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:44,274
That's gonna bring me 30 bills a bottle
where we're going.

341
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:47,882
Because there's nothing,
nothing too good for our boys.

342
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:51,042
- Yeah. What's in here?
- That's the mail.

343
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,313
Are you gonna charge them
something for that too?

344
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,150
- No, they wouldn't sit still for that.
- Just kidding, sarge. Just kidding.

345
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:03,058
No. When you get these thoughts,
tell me anyway...

346
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:06,598
...because one thing I'm not
going back home again is poor.

347
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:09,134
Keep thinking, kid. Very nice.

348
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:32,324
Germans?

349
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:40,528
This is the up-front front.

350
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,210
Wide awake bunch of boys.

351
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:57,684
- Don't you people ever post a sentry?
- I'm sorry, sir. I came in for a second.

352
00:37:57,855 --> 00:38:00,220
What's the matter?
Close the pneumonia hole.

353
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:02,984
- What were you born in, a barn?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

354
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:05,185
We didn't know it was you.

355
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:09,655
- Major Wolenski?
- He's over there, sir.

356
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:18,464
Hello, colonel. I wasn't expecting a visit
or I'd have had my men smarten up.

357
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:20,803
How are you?
Hot coffee for the colonel.

358
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:22,969
Come over and get warm.

359
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:25,674
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

360
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,548
That radio's been yakking between
Christmas carols we're all going home.

361
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,552
Here, sit down.

362
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:36,017
It's tough keeping discipline
when the only action...

363
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:38,355
...is sitting on your butt
to keep warm.

364
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,020
What are the Germans doing?

365
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,895
Same damn thing,
except they don't have any heat.

366
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,399
They gotta exercise
to keep from freezing.

367
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:48,734
Well, I got a little exercise
for your boys.

368
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:52,001
I wanna patrol tonight,
try to pick up some prisoners.

369
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,605
Well, there they are.

370
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:08,281
- Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.
- Come on, shut the window.

371
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:10,451
What do you wanna
do that for, sarge?

372
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,121
They're out of range. They'll
shoot back with something heavier.

373
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:18,464
It's you or them, dogface.
I need practice.

374
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,373
That's enough, sergeant.

375
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,772
If you wanna play with that popgun,
you can go outside.

376
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:29,973
What do you say I take the men out
for a field drill, lieutenant?

377
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:34,778
In this weather? What for?

378
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,980
Because they're drilling, that's why.

379
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:41,593
I'll let you know
when I want a drill, sergeant.

380
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:44,730
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

381
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:50,300
I'll take that sergeant.

382
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:54,669
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.

383
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,576
Here you are, colonel.

384
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:02,275
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?

385
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,314
Just sweeten it.

386
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:39,352
You are Colonel Hessler?

387
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,011
Who are you?

388
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,681
How did you get in here?

389
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,228
General Kohler's signature is magic.

390
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,329
You will excuse us, major.

391
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,366
Before you give orders,
may I ask your rank?

392
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,002
Courtesan, first class.

393
00:40:56,172 --> 00:40:58,731
Compliments of General Kohler.

394
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,568
I think we have covered
everything, colonel.

395
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:11,684
General Kohler did not tell me
you were so handsome.

396
00:41:11,854 --> 00:41:15,345
What did General Kohler
tell you about me?

397
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:17,584
Nothing.

398
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:21,587
Whatever I want to know...

399
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,657
...l'll find out for myself.

400
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:28,360
I'm very good at that.

401
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:36,002
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

402
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:42,376
Or have you been at the front so long
you have forgotten your manners?

403
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:52,255
What shall we talk about?

404
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,862
Your wife perhaps.

405
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,863
Won't you join me?

406
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:10,874
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

407
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:13,539
You are not paying
much attention to me.

408
00:42:13,718 --> 00:42:16,880
Very little has escaped my attention.

409
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:21,318
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

410
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:28,088
What he admires most about you
is your reputation with the ladies.

411
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:34,936
I regret that is the opinion
of my commanding officer.

412
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:42,105
I have worked very hard
to achieve a reputation as a soldier.

413
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,747
Do not the two go together?

414
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,941
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him, "Thank you.

415
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,111
I appreciate his gesture."
And good night.

416
00:42:51,924 --> 00:42:54,448
You can make your own way out.

417
00:43:16,483 --> 00:43:18,450
Zero minus two hours.

418
00:43:18,618 --> 00:43:20,448
All units ready to attack.

419
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:26,581
Repeat. Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.

420
00:43:36,736 --> 00:43:40,193
- Come on.
- Put them down, dummkopf.

421
00:43:44,477 --> 00:43:46,637
Hello, Kiley.

422
00:43:46,814 --> 00:43:50,681
I was curious to see how
you interrogate your prisoners.

423
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,513
My other officers may be
asking the wrong questions.

424
00:43:55,256 --> 00:43:58,554
I'm afraid you won't
hear any new answers.

425
00:43:58,726 --> 00:44:03,321
Sometimes it's more important
what you see than what they say.

426
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:16,371
Could we get
a little more light in here?

427
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:18,568
How's that, sir?

428
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,759
So this is the face
of the undefeated enemy.

429
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:37,920
It looks like you've captured
a Sunday school class.

430
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,092
This all they have left to put in
the front lines? Where are the weapons?

431
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,066
Here, sir.

432
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:49,037
What's this?

433
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:55,639
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.

434
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,876
- Did they put up any fight?
- No, sir.

435
00:44:58,053 --> 00:44:59,986
Just gave up.

436
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:03,817
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.

437
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,925
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

438
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:09,893
They're not even tough enough
to be classified as delinquents.

439
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:13,591
Go ahead and question them.
Ask if Germany's gonna win the war.

440
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,737
Go ahead, Kiley.

441
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:20,271
They could be plants put
in the front lines to mislead us.

442
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,070
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

443
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:27,511
Escort these prisoners to the rear
for proper interrogation.

444
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:29,445
Yes, sir. Move them out.

445
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:32,246
- Let's go, move it out.
- Go!

446
00:45:33,222 --> 00:45:35,849
These prisoners
were carrying these rubber hoses.

447
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,356
Send them along,
and anything else you found.

448
00:45:38,594 --> 00:45:40,720
Yes, sir.

449
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:47,734
Do you actually still think the Germans
are preparing a major offensive?

450
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:50,295
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

451
00:45:50,474 --> 00:45:54,137
You mean those kids are replacements
for more seasoned troops...

452
00:45:54,311 --> 00:45:57,370
...sent to the rear
to re-form for the big attack?

453
00:45:57,548 --> 00:45:59,777
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

454
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:04,684
Kiley, you're crazy. Facts mean nothing
to you. Evidence means nothing.

455
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:08,346
The only thing you can see
are your own cockeyed hunches.

456
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:11,051
Well, that doesn't work in the Army.

457
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:15,356
I'm recommending you for transfer
to a desk in Washington.

458
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,961
You can tell the president
how to run the war.

459
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,479
Major.

460
00:46:44,662 --> 00:46:47,892
You make coffee as bad as my wife.

461
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,934
She always told me
I'd never get along in the Army.

462
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:58,673
I never had it so easy
in the police force.

463
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:05,572
I've just been counting up
how many times I've been wrong.

464
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:08,344
But never this wrong.

465
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:12,249
All the signs point
to only one thing.

466
00:47:12,425 --> 00:47:16,019
Is it possible they mean
something else?

467
00:47:18,097 --> 00:47:22,430
Maybe this war is beyond me
and maybe Colonel Pritchard's right.

468
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:25,434
Runner brought this from headquarters.
It's for you.

469
00:47:25,604 --> 00:47:26,968
Open it.

470
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:37,482
Well, it's a picture of a Kraut colonel
and his service record.

471
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:40,118
I wanted that.

472
00:47:43,123 --> 00:47:49,426
Well, there it is again. Panzer officer.
Fine fighting record.

473
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:52,962
Last reported in the Russian front
commanding a tank regiment.

474
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:54,895
What's he doing here?

475
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:57,433
I'd say that proves my point.

476
00:47:57,604 --> 00:48:03,565
Colonel Pritchard would probably say
he got fired for losing the war in Russia.

477
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:08,311
I don't know. What do you think?

478
00:48:09,683 --> 00:48:14,642
Well, sir. I'm regular Army.
I don't get into beefs between colonels.

479
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:19,685
But I'll tell you what some
of my stir-crazy men think.

480
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:23,090
They think we got
a great opportunity here.

481
00:48:23,264 --> 00:48:26,426
We got a chance
to wipe out Germany.

482
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:30,696
Just wipe it clean off the map.
Knock everything down...

483
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:32,268
...every city...

484
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,966
...every castle, all the bridges,
all the roads. Everything.

485
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:40,977
Don't leave two stones standing
together. Just wipe the slate clean.

486
00:48:41,148 --> 00:48:44,480
Turn Germany into a prairie,
then ship over a few buffalo...

487
00:48:44,652 --> 00:48:46,676
...and let them start from scratch.

488
00:48:46,855 --> 00:48:49,550
Now, what do you think
of that, colonel?

489
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:59,365
I think your men ought to wash their
socks and take a shave. It stinks in here.

490
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:40,073
- Speak English. Only English.
- Okay, lieutenant.

491
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,109
Let's get this stuff out of here.

492
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,462
Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

493
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:09,764
Repeat. Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

494
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:24,607
What the...?

495
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:26,871
What's that noise?

496
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:28,912
On your feet! Everybody out!

497
00:52:29,082 --> 00:52:33,108
- Sounds like a thousand of them.
- Hey, Charlie, get battalion.

498
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:35,879
- Get battalion.
- On the double! On the double!

499
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:39,724
Sergeant, haul everybody out.

500
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:43,351
- Everybody out. Come on.
- Bazooka men, report to me.

501
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:47,926
The line's dead, sir.

502
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:51,902
Go! Go! Go!

503
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,950
What's that?

504
00:53:07,122 --> 00:53:10,420
"What's that?" And you wanted
to see Germans, right?

505
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:13,425
Come on! On the double!

506
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:16,460
On the double!

507
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:22,498
Turn them over! Turn them over!
Let's go! Let's go!

508
00:53:23,272 --> 00:53:25,262
Come on,
let's get this baby moving.

509
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:30,401
Colonel Hessler reports
panzer Tiger moving to the attack.

510
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:32,069
No enemy activity.

511
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:36,307
Northern front reporting
panzer Eisen entering Losheim Gap.

512
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:38,418
No enemy opposition encountered.

513
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,841
Southern front reporting.

514
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:11,951
All elements of panzer Eisen
linking up at road junction 0-2.

515
00:54:47,357 --> 00:54:49,415
Stay on my tail.

516
00:54:55,232 --> 00:54:56,755
Soldier.

517
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:58,900
Did they give you basic training?

518
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:01,832
Here, you do it this way.

519
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:09,072
They're green, never seen action before.
What do you expect?

520
00:55:18,056 --> 00:55:21,786
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.
Nobody moves without orders.

521
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,551
Yes, sir.

522
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,590
Stay here. One more man
won't make a difference.

523
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,725
- I need to look inside one of those Tigers.
- All right, come on.

524
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:30,517
Relay to Standard O-bay.
I've made contact with enemy.

525
00:56:30,697 --> 00:56:32,664
Meeting weak resistance.

526
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,326
Take cover! Make a stand.
Take cover! Make a stand.

527
00:56:37,504 --> 00:56:39,698
Make a stand.

528
00:56:58,191 --> 00:56:59,623
Load.

529
00:56:59,794 --> 00:57:02,193
I said, load!

530
00:57:19,814 --> 00:57:23,544
Tiger to Tank 104.
Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

531
00:57:23,718 --> 00:57:26,345
Get off the road at once!

532
00:57:29,524 --> 00:57:31,457
There's your Tiger.

533
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:39,662
Wait a minute.

534
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,391
You're gonna need this.

535
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:43,593
Take the greaser.

536
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:31,080
Tiger to Tank 104,
what is your condition?

537
00:58:31,888 --> 00:58:34,788
Tank 104, reply at once.

538
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:37,152
This is Colonel Hessler.

539
00:58:42,899 --> 00:58:44,525
Button up!

540
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:46,825
Tigers at 11 o'clock.

541
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:56,438
Hit them hard, Eddie.

542
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:17,697
They got Blondie.

543
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:27,777
Forget it. It's like hitting them
with tennis balls.

544
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:35,779
Come on, let's get out of here!

545
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:40,655
Get down and stay down.

546
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:52,466
Crawl, you dummy! Crawl.

547
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,402
Lieutenant,
keep those grenades coming.

548
01:00:05,017 --> 01:00:07,644
Fall back!

549
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,682
Fall back!

550
01:00:21,234 --> 01:00:23,167
Fall back!

551
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:27,267
Fall back!

552
01:00:27,439 --> 01:00:29,372
Get down.

553
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:51,154
Get going. Stay low.

554
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:28,002
Hessler to headquarters.

555
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:31,969
Resistance very weak.

556
01:01:33,644 --> 01:01:35,305
Southern front reporting.

557
01:01:35,479 --> 01:01:38,379
Commander Nimke
encountering light resistance.

558
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,144
Enemy retreating across river K- 10.

559
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,752
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, somebody man this gun!

560
01:02:44,922 --> 01:02:47,617
- Here they come!
- There they are!

561
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:08,908
Give me a belt!

562
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,764
Hey, wait for me!

563
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,836
Grab the tailgate!

564
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,877
Wait for me!

565
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:50,782
- Where's your motor pool?
- At regiment, four kilometers.

566
01:03:50,962 --> 01:03:53,726
Let's get there.
I gotta get back to headquarters.

567
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:56,225
- Wait for me!
- Hold it a minute!

568
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:57,959
Wait for me!

569
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:41,678
We haven't got a chance.

570
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:44,546
Relax. Stay loose.

571
01:04:45,788 --> 01:04:48,585
You think we'll have to surrender?

572
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:52,452
Well, I hear they treat
American prisoners real well.

573
01:04:52,663 --> 01:04:55,654
In a big battle,
they treat nobody real well.

574
01:04:56,099 --> 01:04:59,465
Come on. There's a back road
that leads to the motor pool.

575
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:03,106
- Maybe we can get us a jeep.
- How do you know?

576
01:05:03,273 --> 01:05:06,106
Because I studied the maps
when we arrived here.

577
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,801
Just like you should've done.

578
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:16,487
- What if we run into their lines?
- We're still ahead of them.

579
01:05:16,689 --> 01:05:20,590
- They might have advanced patrols.
- It's enough trouble keeping alive...

580
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,954
...in this mess
without you bellyaching.

581
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:26,428
If you wanna surrender, go ahead.
I'll make it easier alone.

582
01:05:26,633 --> 01:05:28,998
You're out of line, sergeant.

583
01:05:29,636 --> 01:05:32,127
Sorry, lieutenant.

584
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:36,605
Look, I don't need help from you.
You wanna go on by yourself, go ahead.

585
01:05:40,281 --> 01:05:43,580
Are you coming,
or am I gonna have to carry you?

586
01:06:02,972 --> 01:06:04,633
Hello, Cheyenne.

587
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:06,672
What's that? You're under attack?

588
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:08,537
In what strength?

589
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:10,541
Well, what's your guess?

590
01:06:10,748 --> 01:06:13,443
I can't give you air reconnaissance,
I'm blind.

591
01:06:13,617 --> 01:06:15,607
- Get Apache.
- Call Apache.

592
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,144
Eddie, what's going on
in your sector?

593
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:20,687
It's only patrol action.
How heavy?

594
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:24,020
Well, what does your
reconnaissance say? Nothing heavy.

595
01:06:24,196 --> 01:06:26,790
We're trying to get a picture.
Stay on task.

596
01:06:53,895 --> 01:06:56,728
The first phase of our offensive
was a success.

597
01:06:57,165 --> 01:06:59,189
The element of surprise
was complete.

598
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:02,200
American communications
are in a turmoil.

599
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:05,395
We must cross the Our River
before the enemy realizes...

600
01:07:05,573 --> 01:07:08,439
...we have launched
an all-out offensive.

601
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:14,105
I do not believe I gave you permission
to smoke.

602
01:07:14,316 --> 01:07:16,112
Sorry, sir.

603
01:07:17,587 --> 01:07:21,250
Unfortunately, we did not have time
to get better acquainted...

604
01:07:21,425 --> 01:07:24,724
...but all of you know my reputation.

605
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,827
My command always suffers
the highest casualties.

606
01:07:30,736 --> 01:07:34,227
The price of victory is never cheap.

607
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:38,570
In this battle, we will be
as hard as our tanks.

608
01:07:39,212 --> 01:07:42,203
I will reach the objectives
assigned to me...

609
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:44,213
...no matter what the cost.

610
01:07:44,984 --> 01:07:47,781
Signal from headquarters, colonel.

611
01:07:50,624 --> 01:07:52,318
Hessler, I congratulate you.

612
01:07:52,494 --> 01:07:55,793
- You're on schedule.
- I will reach the Our River as planned.

613
01:07:55,964 --> 01:07:59,126
But the enemy must not be permitted
to destroy the bridge.

614
01:07:59,301 --> 01:08:02,065
- Has Schumacher seized it yet?
- Not yet.

615
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:06,263
Schumacher's primary assignment
is to disrupt enemy communications.

616
01:08:06,741 --> 01:08:09,174
I must have that bridge secured
for my tanks.

617
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:11,311
I have no time to build bridges.

618
01:08:13,517 --> 01:08:17,782
Hessler, your bridge will be secured.

619
01:08:17,954 --> 01:08:21,514
We are expecting you to cross it
according to the schedule.

620
01:08:23,927 --> 01:08:27,988
You know your line of march.
Coordinate with the map.

621
01:08:33,104 --> 01:08:36,470
Conrad, I have a headache.

622
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:54,551
Fire! Fire!

623
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:13,573
Land mines!
Why were they not cleared?

624
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,841
Where are the men
with mine detectors?

625
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,541
We are moving too fast.

626
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:19,686
The men are following in trucks.

627
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,345
They are all dead.

628
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,459
The mine exploded
directly under them.

629
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:27,360
Notify their seconds-in-command
to take over.

630
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:30,090
Tell them I have absolute
confidence in them.

631
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,558
We have lost a tank unnecessarily.

632
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:35,034
We've lost precious minutes
unnecessarily.

633
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,673
Your troops were here
to protect the panzers.

634
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,240
From now on,
until we clear this minefield...

635
01:09:40,411 --> 01:09:43,539
...your men will go ahead of my tanks.

636
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:47,850
And have my vehicle repaired at once!

637
01:10:01,234 --> 01:10:03,565
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

638
01:10:11,111 --> 01:10:13,579
Now, listen to me, all of you.

639
01:10:13,747 --> 01:10:16,409
I need precise information:

640
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:19,142
How many men, how many guns...

641
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,084
...how many tanks
the enemy are throwing into this.

642
01:10:22,257 --> 01:10:25,157
How much fuel are they carrying?
And get a move on.

643
01:10:25,326 --> 01:10:29,056
We've got 24 hours
before we scream rape.

644
01:10:30,599 --> 01:10:32,828
All right, Kiley, it's your turn.

645
01:10:33,068 --> 01:10:35,399
They're pouring through, general.

646
01:10:35,572 --> 01:10:37,596
Crack troops. Brand-new equipment.

647
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:41,675
I looked inside one of their tanks.
They can chew up anything we've got.

648
01:10:41,845 --> 01:10:45,679
- Question is, where are they going?
- Do you have that information?

649
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,749
No, but he does. Colonel Hessler...

650
01:10:47,917 --> 01:10:50,476
...the commanding officer
of the panzer spearhead.

651
01:10:50,653 --> 01:10:52,415
When we know where he's going...

652
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:55,081
...we'll know the objective
of the attack.

653
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:58,819
The enemy is probing at five points
along an 85-mile front.

654
01:10:58,996 --> 01:11:01,464
With only that information
at our disposal...

655
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,965
...how can you assume Hessler's column
is the spearhead?

656
01:11:05,138 --> 01:11:07,298
- The law of probability, Kiley?
- No, sir.

657
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,462
The law of probability is against me.

658
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:13,975
But in the absence of other information,
I've one chance in five of being right.

659
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:17,444
- I'd like to explore that chance.
- How?

660
01:11:17,618 --> 01:11:19,448
- Well, sir...
- I'll tell you how.

661
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,950
Watch the Our River.

662
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:24,681
There's only one bridge, right here,
that can support heavy tanks.

663
01:11:24,858 --> 01:11:28,624
I'd say that's where Hessler will be,
and that's where I'll be.

664
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:32,629
Don't get too close to that bridge.
I've ordered it blown up.

665
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,962
That's a good thing to know.
Thanks for the tip.

666
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:43,476
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Go on, keep moving.

667
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,846
Come on, let's go.
You there, keep moving.

668
01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:48,985
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

669
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:00,821
Come on. Come on, let's go.

670
01:12:00,998 --> 01:12:02,897
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

671
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:09,238
Move it. Come on, keep moving.
Step on it. Get going.

672
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,376
Come on, let's get going.
Step on it.

673
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,517
Hey, what are you stopping for?

674
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:22,177
That sign.
When we came through before...

675
01:12:22,356 --> 01:12:26,382
...I recall Ambleve was that way.
- You're blocking the road. Get going.

676
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,390
- Hurry up.
- Come on, let's go.

677
01:12:28,596 --> 01:12:32,259
Wait a minute. I tell you, those signs
point in the wrong direction.

678
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:34,457
What's holding up the parade here?

679
01:12:34,669 --> 01:12:37,865
Somebody's been monkeying around
with those road signs.

680
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:40,199
That ain't the road to Ambleve.

681
01:12:40,876 --> 01:12:43,207
Two hours ago,
I came here from Ambleve...

682
01:12:43,379 --> 01:12:45,073
...over this exact same road.

683
01:12:45,247 --> 01:12:48,080
Now, maybe they've moved Ambleve
in the meantime...

684
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:50,650
...but two hours ago
this was the road to it.

685
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,584
- Take off, Duquesne.
- Lieutenant, I'm telling you...

686
01:12:53,757 --> 01:12:57,214
Lieutenant, tell your sergeant
to get this jeep out of here.

687
01:12:57,393 --> 01:13:00,692
Move. That's an order. Move.

688
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:08,430
Yeah, I hope they enjoy themselves
in Malmedy.

689
01:13:12,343 --> 01:13:14,811
- Come on. We're getting off here.
- Wait.

690
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,742
Come on!

691
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:19,305
Jump.

692
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:25,188
Hey, wait a minute. Where we going?

693
01:13:25,358 --> 01:13:27,325
We're supposed to be in Ambleve.

694
01:13:27,493 --> 01:13:30,017
We'll get there.
I gotta make a pickup first.

695
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:33,027
- Pickup?
- I got some merchandise in a farmhouse.

696
01:13:33,233 --> 01:13:36,668
Germans are coming. They'll steal it.
You gotta give me a hand.

697
01:13:36,837 --> 01:13:38,997
Hey, you two!

698
01:13:40,975 --> 01:13:43,739
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

699
01:13:58,894 --> 01:14:01,362
Are you the last one?
Anybody behind you?

700
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:04,693
Yeah, the whole German army.
Go ahead.

701
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:10,567
You there, keep them moving.
Come on, step on it.

702
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:18,907
Notify the panzers.
The bridge is intact.

703
01:14:34,799 --> 01:14:37,767
- Any sign of the Germans?
- No, not yet.

704
01:14:37,937 --> 01:14:41,428
- What are you men doing here?
- We got orders to blow the bridge.

705
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:43,335
- Pile out.
- Wait a minute.

706
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,670
That job's being done.

707
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,182
How you boys making out?

708
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:01,350
- Just about finished.
- Hurry up, will you?

709
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:03,962
Get out of here
before those Krauts get here.

710
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:06,532
- You need any help?
- I got a good idea.

711
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:12,264
We'll give them all a hot-water bottle.
That water comes straight off the ice.

712
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:15,103
Well, I'm sure loaded with C-4.
Can you use any?

713
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:17,973
I imagine they could sell you some.

714
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:21,109
Climb in.

715
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:31,086
Hey, why do you got your wires
hooked on to that detonator?

716
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:38,323
- I guess he's in a hurry.
- To get killed? That's not the way.

717
01:15:38,503 --> 01:15:40,129
Sarge, bring a couple of men.

718
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:43,241
We're gonna take a look
under that bridge.

719
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:00,417
This ain't the road to Ambleve.

720
01:16:00,595 --> 01:16:01,993
That's what the sign says.

721
01:16:02,163 --> 01:16:05,495
The sign says thataway,
the map says Ambleve was this way.

722
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:08,294
Will somebody straighten this out?

723
01:16:10,672 --> 01:16:13,469
Ambleve. Ambleve.

724
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,270
- Hey, Wolenski.
- Oh, colonel.

725
01:16:21,351 --> 01:16:23,147
Hey, we're all fouled up here.

726
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:27,221
We've been ordered to Ambleve,
but the maps don't jibe with the signs.

727
01:16:27,424 --> 01:16:30,620
How'd you get off the road?
This will take you to Malmedy.

728
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,818
- Ambleve's that way.
- That way?

729
01:16:32,996 --> 01:16:35,829
We've been following these road signs
the whole way.

730
01:16:35,999 --> 01:16:40,025
And the MPs we ran into,
they've been directing us this way.

731
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,534
They've been changed.
They switched them around.

732
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,677
Those MPs you ran into seem okay?

733
01:16:46,879 --> 01:16:50,041
- What do you mean?
- Anything odd about them?

734
01:16:50,216 --> 01:16:51,546
Just regular Gls.

735
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,683
We intercepted an enemy dispatch.

736
01:16:53,853 --> 01:16:56,548
They were recruiting
English-speaking Germans.

737
01:16:56,723 --> 01:16:59,418
What time did you cross the Our River?

738
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:02,892
8:40. We were last ones across.
They were set to blow it.

739
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:05,154
- You see the bridge blown?
- No.

740
01:17:05,332 --> 01:17:08,061
But I saw the engineers
setting the charges.

741
01:17:08,234 --> 01:17:14,366
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell?
They weren't engineers, they were MPs.

742
01:17:16,211 --> 01:17:18,509
Murphy, get me headquarters.

743
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,739
And, major,
have someone switch that sign back.

744
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,681
Red River Six. Come in, Red River Six.

745
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:29,016
- Come in, Red River Two.
- Red River Six, this is Red River Two.

746
01:17:29,192 --> 01:17:33,788
Germans uniformed as American MPs
holding Our River Bridge.

747
01:17:33,996 --> 01:17:36,464
Bridge has not been blown.

748
01:17:36,632 --> 01:17:40,033
Repeat. Germans uniformed
as American MPs...

749
01:17:40,204 --> 01:17:44,299
...holding Our River Bridge.
Bridge has not been blown.

750
01:17:44,508 --> 01:17:47,443
Over and out. Let's go.

751
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:05,288
Better hold it, Jack.

752
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:11,101
- What happened?
- They ran into a firefight.

753
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:13,067
German patrol.

754
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:14,796
I don't see any Germans.

755
01:18:15,308 --> 01:18:18,276
They're in the river.
They didn't make it across.

756
01:18:18,446 --> 01:18:20,675
Get out of here.
We're blowing the bridge.

757
01:18:21,482 --> 01:18:24,177
What? Are you sure?

758
01:18:24,685 --> 01:18:26,675
Watch out, the MPs are Krauts!

759
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,707
Oh, my God! Get down!

760
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:29,113
Why are we waiting?
Get that tank out of the way.

761
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:31,720
We are preparing
to tow it off now, sir.

762
01:19:33,127 --> 01:19:37,028
Tiger to tanks Leopard and Panther.
Blast that tank off the bridge.

763
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:55,107
It's headquarters, colonel.

764
01:19:55,285 --> 01:19:57,718
General Kohler says
we are behind schedule.

765
01:19:58,089 --> 01:20:00,784
He wants to know
what's holding us up.

766
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:06,520
Tell the general the Americans
are learning how to retreat.

767
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:13,297
Tiger to Panther. Get onto the bridge,
push that junk right out of the way.

768
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,937
Stay down.

769
01:21:03,994 --> 01:21:08,430
Murphy, call headquarters. Tell them
the Our River Bridge hasn't been blown.

770
01:21:08,598 --> 01:21:11,657
- The enemy's crossing in great strength.
- Yes, sir.

771
01:21:23,315 --> 01:21:26,681
- Let me have your rifle.
- What you need is a cannon, sir.

772
01:21:26,852 --> 01:21:30,844
The last time I saw that German,
all I had was a camera.

773
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:17,503
Can't you hurry it up, sergeant?
We lost the column.

774
01:22:17,674 --> 01:22:21,575
Do you happen to have a new carburetor
in your pocket, lieutenant?

775
01:22:22,613 --> 01:22:24,740
You mean we're stuck here?

776
01:22:27,451 --> 01:22:30,613
Nope. We can still walk.

777
01:22:33,424 --> 01:22:35,357
Let's go.

778
01:22:37,362 --> 01:22:40,819
- Hey, maybe we can get a lift, huh?
- Hold it.

779
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,860
We better find out
just who they are first.

780
01:22:52,712 --> 01:22:54,269
Down.

781
01:23:00,354 --> 01:23:02,481
Yeah, Krauts. Back.

782
01:23:41,832 --> 01:23:44,823
If you'd just stayed loose,
I could've gotten them all.

783
01:24:04,659 --> 01:24:08,959
Americans in headlong retreat.
Our forces are advancing on all fronts.

784
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:12,662
Great numbers of prisoners
are being taken.

785
01:25:13,033 --> 01:25:15,627
I got a bad feeling about this.

786
01:25:15,804 --> 01:25:18,863
If you wanted to make a run for it,
why didn't you?

787
01:25:20,008 --> 01:25:22,441
I'm in your outfit, lieutenant.

788
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:26,511
My job is to look out for you,
go where you go.

789
01:25:31,153 --> 01:25:33,882
I sure got you into the wrong place
this time.

790
01:25:34,423 --> 01:25:36,914
But I'm glad you're with me.

791
01:25:38,929 --> 01:25:43,592
When we get to the POW camp,
they'll separate us...

792
01:25:43,767 --> 01:25:45,529
...you being an officer.

793
01:25:47,637 --> 01:25:49,604
Yeah.

794
01:25:51,242 --> 01:25:53,300
I'm gonna miss you, sergeant.

795
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,090
Run!

796
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:36,183
Keep going!

797
01:27:37,788 --> 01:27:39,948
Get going. Come on, step on it.

798
01:27:57,309 --> 01:27:58,639
- Is she here?
- No.

799
01:27:58,811 --> 01:28:00,744
Well, tell her I'm back, huh?

800
01:28:10,891 --> 01:28:15,054
I want you all to fan out. Round up
every man that belongs to this outfit.

801
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:17,959
We will assemble here in 10 minutes.
On the double.

802
01:28:18,133 --> 01:28:19,394
Let's go.

803
01:28:31,814 --> 01:28:33,178
What's all this?

804
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,648
What's it look like?
My place of business.

805
01:28:41,325 --> 01:28:43,656
- What are the chickens for?
- They lay eggs.

806
01:28:43,827 --> 01:28:46,318
Any idea what fresh eggs
brings in these days?

807
01:28:46,496 --> 01:28:48,725
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

808
01:28:50,101 --> 01:28:52,625
All right, open the door,
that's my partner.

809
01:28:59,678 --> 01:29:02,511
Look, run down to the tank park
and check us both in.

810
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:05,308
- But...
- And then report back to me. Go ahead.

811
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:09,520
The chickens look scrawny.
Have you been feeding them regular?

812
01:29:09,689 --> 01:29:11,179
I was worried about you.

813
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:14,349
- Is it true the Germans are coming?
- Right through here.

814
01:29:14,527 --> 01:29:17,360
- We gotta sell everything, fast.
- Then you'll leave?

815
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:23,365
Face it, kid, we're out of business.
One case of champagne, $360.

816
01:29:23,537 --> 01:29:29,237
Two dozen nylons, $80.
Twenty bottles of perfume, $200.

817
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:34,074
Six hundred and forty dollars.
Here's your half.

818
01:29:34,282 --> 01:29:37,739
Three hundred and twenty dollars.
All right, what did you make?

819
01:29:37,919 --> 01:29:41,354
One thousand, two hundred
and thirty dollars. Here.

820
01:29:45,329 --> 01:29:48,422
What have you been selling?
I don't see much stock gone.

821
01:29:48,599 --> 01:29:51,226
- Take it.
- I won't until I know how you made it.

822
01:29:51,401 --> 01:29:54,096
- What do you think I am?
- What do you think I am?

823
01:29:55,405 --> 01:29:59,431
- It's money I've saved for us.
- For us? What are you talking about?

824
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:04,811
When a woman goes in business
with a man, it means forever.

825
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:09,213
What's forever? The shop is closed.
The Germans are coming.

826
01:30:09,388 --> 01:30:11,515
They've been here before.

827
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:13,589
I've lived through it.

828
01:30:13,759 --> 01:30:16,421
I will live through it again.

829
01:30:22,335 --> 01:30:24,268
I will wait for you.

830
01:30:28,542 --> 01:30:31,943
How can you feel this way about me?
I never laid a hand on you.

831
01:30:32,146 --> 01:30:34,045
That's why.

832
01:30:34,615 --> 01:30:36,445
You're in love with me.

833
01:30:40,055 --> 01:30:43,080
Just a second. Hold the phone.

834
01:30:43,258 --> 01:30:44,986
Hold the phone, here.

835
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:47,618
Shut up.

836
01:31:05,615 --> 01:31:07,582
You know what?

837
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:09,513
You're right.

838
01:31:10,922 --> 01:31:12,513
There.

839
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:15,625
You hold all the money.
I gotta go back in action.

840
01:31:15,793 --> 01:31:17,953
You don't know
what it's like in combat.

841
01:31:18,129 --> 01:31:20,358
You get shot,
somebody takes your money.

842
01:31:20,532 --> 01:31:23,898
Before the plasma comes,
a guy's got his hand in your pocket.

843
01:31:24,436 --> 01:31:27,098
Guffy. Guffy.

844
01:31:28,407 --> 01:31:32,137
- I don't want you to get killed.
- Who's talking about getting killed?

845
01:31:32,312 --> 01:31:33,869
You take care of the money.

846
01:31:34,047 --> 01:31:38,643
Sarge, the tanks aren't there. They've
been pulled back. We gotta catch up.

847
01:31:41,655 --> 01:31:43,622
So long, partner.

848
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,454
Take care of yourself.

849
01:31:45,627 --> 01:31:47,117
Guffy.

850
01:31:51,132 --> 01:31:53,623
Don't you want to kiss me?

851
01:32:09,986 --> 01:32:13,716
Don't forget to feed the chickens, huh?

852
01:32:18,864 --> 01:32:21,923
Keep moving. Let's go, keep moving.

853
01:32:22,099 --> 01:32:26,262
Come on, sarge, we gotta catch up
with the tanks. Let's go!

854
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:28,870
Goodbye, Louise!

855
01:32:32,477 --> 01:32:34,034
Put that in there.

856
01:32:34,213 --> 01:32:36,875
Come on, get to it. Get to it.

857
01:33:12,823 --> 01:33:16,383
Lion Battalion,
take up bombardment position.

858
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,823
Panther Battalion, stand by.

859
01:33:25,102 --> 01:33:26,966
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

860
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:46,856
- Hold it. Where you running?
- The Germans are coming.

861
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:50,290
- Where's your rifle? Where's your outfit?
- Captured.

862
01:33:50,463 --> 01:33:55,456
- Dead. Gone. They're all gone.
- Sergeant, stop that man!

863
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:58,695
He's not doing anything we aren't.

864
01:34:19,194 --> 01:34:20,661
We're staying.

865
01:34:20,829 --> 01:34:22,887
Countermand that order to fall back.

866
01:34:23,099 --> 01:34:26,124
All units are to make a stand
where they are and fight.

867
01:34:26,303 --> 01:34:29,169
And that means everybody.
Except tanks.

868
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:32,340
Clerks, cooks, bakers, staff officers.

869
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:35,909
Anybody who can carry a rifle
is to use it.

870
01:34:39,884 --> 01:34:43,012
- Kiley.
- Come on, bring it all in.

871
01:34:45,256 --> 01:34:49,624
It's very difficult for me to say this.
I was wrong.

872
01:34:58,204 --> 01:35:01,570
- Sergeant, haul them out again.
- Everybody out.

873
01:35:01,741 --> 01:35:04,039
Come on, what are you waiting for?

874
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:06,775
Well, it looks like we're staying.

875
01:35:06,947 --> 01:35:10,006
- I never have a rifle when I need one.
- Take mine.

876
01:35:10,184 --> 01:35:12,447
- It's on the house.
- I'll return it later.

877
01:35:12,653 --> 01:35:15,553
- Let's go!
- Let's go. Come on.

878
01:35:18,026 --> 01:35:19,959
We're on the line, sir.

879
01:35:20,161 --> 01:35:23,562
General Grey speaking. Fred.

880
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:27,063
I'm holding at Ambleve,
but I can't last without heavy stuff.

881
01:35:27,236 --> 01:35:29,100
What can you let me have?

882
01:35:30,072 --> 01:35:34,031
155s will do the trick.
Where are they? On flatcars.

883
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:36,108
Are we still holding the rail line?

884
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:39,179
Good.
Now, when can you get them here?

885
01:35:40,683 --> 01:35:43,913
Well, not later, Fred.
We're counting on you.

886
01:38:26,499 --> 01:38:28,090
Bring that ammo up!

887
01:38:28,268 --> 01:38:32,135
Stack it up. Position, on the wall.

888
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,403
Get some beef behind it.

889
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:42,948
Hey, lay those logs in there.

890
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:51,390
Let's go! Let's move it out.

891
01:38:53,695 --> 01:38:56,595
First Platoon, follow me.
Second Platoon, over there.

892
01:39:02,805 --> 01:39:04,635
Fire.

893
01:39:54,595 --> 01:39:56,494
Soldier!

894
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:58,221
Go! Go!

895
01:40:05,073 --> 01:40:06,767
Everybody out!

896
01:40:06,975 --> 01:40:09,875
- Wait a minute. Where you men going?
- To the shelter.

897
01:40:10,045 --> 01:40:13,502
- No, you're not. Grab your rifles.
- But we're cooks.

898
01:40:13,683 --> 01:40:16,982
Lunch is over.
Get your rifles and follow me.

899
01:40:21,393 --> 01:40:24,055
- Stay away from the buildings!
- Soldier, up front.

900
01:40:24,229 --> 01:40:26,059
I'm in the Air Corps.

901
01:40:26,231 --> 01:40:28,630
You're in the infantry now. Follow me.

902
01:41:32,303 --> 01:41:34,463
We're driving them back.
They're running.

903
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:36,367
This is only the first round.

904
01:42:11,413 --> 01:42:13,175
Why have you stopped?

905
01:42:13,348 --> 01:42:14,815
They have dug in.

906
01:42:14,983 --> 01:42:17,712
- It's a very strong defense.
- Bypass it.

907
01:42:17,886 --> 01:42:21,377
- I have considered that.
- There's nothing to consider.

908
01:42:22,491 --> 01:42:27,757
We must measure what we might gain
by what we might lose.

909
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:31,232
Come on.

910
01:42:42,145 --> 01:42:45,705
You were to have been 10 kilometers
west of Ambleve by this hour.

911
01:42:45,882 --> 01:42:47,212
Why are you still here?

912
01:42:47,418 --> 01:42:50,511
My first attack failed.
I must take Ambleve.

913
01:42:50,723 --> 01:42:55,056
We are wasting time.
Time, Hessler, you don't have much.

914
01:42:55,227 --> 01:42:58,286
Ambleve is an isolated resistance.
Go around it.

915
01:42:58,464 --> 01:43:01,763
We have surrounded
and bypassed Bastogne. Do the same.

916
01:43:01,935 --> 01:43:05,028
General, it will be dark in one hour.

917
01:43:05,205 --> 01:43:09,164
I want your permission
for a night assault with all my armor.

918
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,640
Colonel Hessler...

919
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:15,302
...you will break off this engagement,
proceed with your mission.

920
01:43:15,548 --> 01:43:17,742
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

921
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:21,981
General, before you go,
may I show you something?

922
01:43:22,189 --> 01:43:23,746
What is it?

923
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:30,763
A chocolate cake.

924
01:43:31,501 --> 01:43:32,899
Well?

925
01:43:33,068 --> 01:43:37,401
It was taken from a captured
American private. It's still fresh.

926
01:43:37,707 --> 01:43:42,303
If you will look at the wrapping, general,
you will see it comes from Boston.

927
01:43:42,613 --> 01:43:44,103
And?

928
01:43:45,214 --> 01:43:47,978
General,
do you realize what this means?

929
01:43:48,218 --> 01:43:51,015
It means that the Americans
have fuel and planes...

930
01:43:51,221 --> 01:43:54,485
...to fly cake
across the Atlantic Ocean.

931
01:43:55,727 --> 01:43:58,593
They have no conception of defeat.

932
01:43:58,962 --> 01:44:02,829
We have the opportunity here
to break their morale...

933
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,662
...to destroy their will to fight.

934
01:44:05,938 --> 01:44:09,668
That is why you must permit me
to reduce Ambleve to ashes.

935
01:44:21,554 --> 01:44:25,854
You have until 0400.

936
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,121
That is all.

937
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:03,873
We have silenced their guns.
Now we will attack.

938
01:48:04,046 --> 01:48:07,070
Your infantry will go in with my tanks.

939
01:48:07,249 --> 01:48:09,078
Yes, sir.

940
01:48:25,703 --> 01:48:27,896
Second Platoon, over there.

941
01:48:28,073 --> 01:48:29,562
Let's go. Move it out.

942
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:33,505
We'd better get going, sir, before
the town is completely surrounded.

943
01:48:34,146 --> 01:48:38,741
Shall I send a runner to Major Wolenski
telling him to cover our withdrawal?

944
01:48:38,918 --> 01:48:42,512
No, that's the kind of order I give
to a man myself.

945
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:14,280
Aim at the trench!

946
01:49:58,337 --> 01:50:00,735
Some more. Let's get closer.

947
01:50:09,184 --> 01:50:12,311
Bring up some more plastique!

948
01:50:46,996 --> 01:50:48,222
Major Wolenski!

949
01:50:49,531 --> 01:50:51,326
The general.

950
01:50:53,501 --> 01:50:56,434
Hurry up! Move that ammo up!

951
01:50:58,807 --> 01:51:01,171
Wolenski, we've been ordered out.

952
01:51:01,342 --> 01:51:05,800
I'll need time to save what I can. Your
outfit will have to cover the withdrawal.

953
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:08,970
- They're coming down the chimney, sir.
- Do what you can.

954
01:51:09,151 --> 01:51:10,844
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

955
01:51:12,888 --> 01:51:15,549
I only loaned you this rifle.

956
01:51:16,525 --> 01:51:20,152
- See you later, major.
- Yes, sir.

957
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,063
Spread out.

958
01:51:44,921 --> 01:51:46,750
Bring up ammo!

959
01:53:32,596 --> 01:53:34,289
Sister.

960
01:53:35,699 --> 01:53:37,188
Colonel, excuse me.

961
01:53:37,369 --> 01:53:39,528
We are looking for someone
who can help.

962
01:53:39,703 --> 01:53:41,293
Be brief.

963
01:53:41,473 --> 01:53:44,565
There are many wounded townspeople
in the church cellar.

964
01:53:44,743 --> 01:53:48,233
We need medicine, bandages.
Can you spare any?

965
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,173
We have nothing to spare.

966
01:53:50,348 --> 01:53:53,713
If there are captured medical supplies,
give them to the nuns.

967
01:53:53,919 --> 01:53:56,715
Yes, sir. Follow me.

968
01:54:30,389 --> 01:54:31,786
He fired with this.

969
01:54:37,529 --> 01:54:40,223
Jean, Jean, Jean!

970
01:54:46,105 --> 01:54:48,298
Don't do anything to him, please.

971
01:54:48,474 --> 01:54:49,939
This is the boy's father.

972
01:54:50,109 --> 01:54:53,440
I beg you. He's just a little boy.

973
01:54:53,613 --> 01:54:56,239
He's my only child.

974
01:54:56,782 --> 01:54:59,943
Don't do anything to him, please.

975
01:55:04,924 --> 01:55:06,287
Release the boy.

976
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:11,793
Jean.

977
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,496
Shoot the father.

978
01:55:20,107 --> 01:55:23,404
- Papa! Papa!
- No!

979
01:55:31,818 --> 01:55:33,478
Colonel.

980
01:55:33,654 --> 01:55:36,120
The senior American officer
taken prisoner...

981
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:38,483
...requests permission
to speak with you.

982
01:55:38,659 --> 01:55:41,922
- What does he want?
- He'll only discuss it with you.

983
01:55:42,095 --> 01:55:44,220
- Rank?
- Major.

984
01:55:44,865 --> 01:55:47,798
- He has two minutes.
- Yes, sir.

985
01:56:02,683 --> 01:56:04,376
Conrad.

986
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:10,849
- What is this food?
- It's the best this town has to offer.

987
01:56:11,024 --> 01:56:14,355
I told you, tanks run on petrol
and soldiers run on rations.

988
01:56:14,529 --> 01:56:19,191
I must eat as my men do so I know
how far they can go. Take it away.

989
01:56:29,677 --> 01:56:32,803
- Conrad.
- Yeah?

990
01:56:35,282 --> 01:56:39,046
My Christmas present,
it's for your sons.

991
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,049
Your promotion to first sergeant.

992
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,326
My sons thank you.

993
01:56:55,637 --> 01:56:56,932
Go in.

994
01:57:01,409 --> 01:57:03,034
What is it?

995
01:57:03,211 --> 01:57:06,838
Colonel, stragglers you've captured
tell me...

996
01:57:07,016 --> 01:57:10,245
...that helpless American prisoners
have been massacred.

997
01:57:11,086 --> 01:57:13,848
- Where?
- Malmedy.

998
01:57:14,023 --> 01:57:18,924
And as senior officer, I can't control
my men unless I have your assurance...

999
01:57:19,094 --> 01:57:23,256
...they'll not be murdered. I want your
signed order stating that my men...

1000
01:57:23,432 --> 01:57:25,728
...will be accorded the protection...

1001
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:29,095
...guaranteed prisoners of war
by the Geneva Convention.

1002
01:57:29,469 --> 01:57:33,460
Unless I return with that order, colonel,
the prisoners will riot.

1003
01:57:33,641 --> 01:57:36,540
Undoubtedly, you'll kill us,
but so help me...

1004
01:57:36,711 --> 01:57:39,543
...we'll take a hell of a lot
of you with us.

1005
01:57:40,415 --> 01:57:43,405
There will be no signed order.
There will be no riot.

1006
01:57:43,584 --> 01:57:47,643
You will not be allowed to return
to your men to instigate that riot.

1007
01:57:48,891 --> 01:57:51,653
You listen to me, colonel.

1008
01:57:51,859 --> 01:57:54,052
There are survivors in all massacres.

1009
01:57:54,228 --> 01:57:56,820
I warn you,
if any of my men are harmed...

1010
01:57:56,999 --> 01:58:01,798
...you will be held responsible. There will
be no place on earth that you can hide.

1011
01:58:01,969 --> 01:58:06,870
And when you're found, I hope I'm the
man that ties the rope around your neck.

1012
01:58:09,378 --> 01:58:11,469
Major...

1013
01:58:11,647 --> 01:58:15,604
...I have never liked threats.

1014
01:58:15,784 --> 01:58:18,274
I do not kill prisoners.

1015
01:58:18,453 --> 01:58:23,821
But I will have no compunction at
shooting you myself for your last remark.

1016
01:58:24,026 --> 01:58:25,924
Then do it.

1017
01:58:32,901 --> 01:58:36,801
You are deliberately trying
to provoke me.

1018
01:58:38,707 --> 01:58:41,435
Yes, colonel, that's right.

1019
01:58:41,677 --> 01:58:46,977
If I walk out of here alive, I know
my men will be properly treated.

1020
01:58:48,317 --> 01:58:50,010
Diepel!

1021
01:58:53,356 --> 01:58:56,983
Return this officer
to the prisoners' compound, alive.

1022
01:58:57,159 --> 01:58:58,681
Come.

1023
01:58:59,829 --> 01:59:03,786
Major, I'm relying on you
to reassure your men...

1024
01:59:03,967 --> 01:59:08,299
...I have no time
for troublesome prisoners.

1025
01:59:11,941 --> 01:59:15,739
Tiger to Standard O-bay,
General Kohler.

1026
01:59:18,515 --> 01:59:21,347
Your usual ration, sir.

1027
01:59:24,587 --> 01:59:27,213
General Kohler. Hessler.

1028
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:32,587
General, is it true that American
prisoners were executed at Malmedy?

1029
01:59:32,829 --> 01:59:35,421
There are SS units
in the Malmedy sector.

1030
01:59:35,598 --> 01:59:39,498
I can't assume responsibility
for every soldier on this front.

1031
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:43,367
Do you realize the consequences
of this act?

1032
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:47,270
I have lost 17 tanks and a battalion
of men leveling Ambleve...

1033
01:59:47,478 --> 01:59:51,003
...for the sole purpose of reducing
the enemy's will to fight.

1034
01:59:51,182 --> 01:59:54,445
This massacre will stiffen resistance
to us everywhere.

1035
01:59:54,617 --> 01:59:58,915
It will turn a demoralized mob
into avenging soldiers.

1036
01:59:59,123 --> 02:00:01,055
You are being insolent, colonel.

1037
02:00:01,225 --> 02:00:03,123
Concern yourself with your mission.

1038
02:00:03,294 --> 02:00:05,920
You are to reach Saint-Michel
by 1600 tomorrow.

1039
02:00:06,095 --> 02:00:10,257
- Be there.
- Yes, sir.

1040
02:00:41,031 --> 02:00:44,465
They've taken a beating,
and they look it.

1041
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:47,065
They're not a rabble.

1042
02:00:47,238 --> 02:00:49,932
They're retreating like soldiers.

1043
02:00:54,178 --> 02:00:56,474
There's still fight in them.

1044
02:00:56,982 --> 02:00:59,949
Where are we gonna stop
and put up the fight?

1045
02:01:00,852 --> 02:01:04,581
At our last line of defense,
the River Meuse.

1046
02:01:04,755 --> 02:01:07,654
We'll cross it
and dig in on the west bank.

1047
02:01:07,826 --> 02:01:10,452
At least we'll get the Germans wet.

1048
02:01:13,665 --> 02:01:16,097
Still sore I pulled you out of Ambleve?

1049
02:01:16,268 --> 02:01:19,100
I was contributing
to the war effort there, sir.

1050
02:01:19,271 --> 02:01:23,706
Try to keep your feet from freezing
while we figure a way to stop them.

1051
02:01:23,875 --> 02:01:26,000
They've made mistakes before.

1052
02:01:26,178 --> 02:01:28,701
Where have they made one this time?

1053
02:01:30,315 --> 02:01:32,781
Well, they got me mad at them.

1054
02:01:42,694 --> 02:01:45,388
Shut up. We'll get there.

1055
02:01:49,402 --> 02:01:51,960
Come on. Come on.

1056
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:55,499
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1057
02:01:55,708 --> 02:01:59,370
- What's holding you up?
- I'm out of gas.

1058
02:01:59,545 --> 02:02:02,740
I reported low about an hour ago.
Where's the fuel truck?

1059
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:06,916
Get off the road and wait for it.
Keep moving.

1060
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:09,609
- Pull it over.
- Move it!

1061
02:02:11,692 --> 02:02:13,352
Come on!

1062
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:19,054
Keep moving.

1063
02:02:19,231 --> 02:02:22,221
Keep moving. Move it.

1064
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:35,776
Where are you going?
Will you wait a minute?

1065
02:02:35,949 --> 02:02:38,074
I need gas.

1066
02:02:40,053 --> 02:02:41,542
Oh, get down.

1067
02:02:44,557 --> 02:02:46,921
Why, you ugly jerk!

1068
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:01,763
Here, use your big mouth on that.

1069
02:03:03,043 --> 02:03:05,168
Hey, come on, let's get with it.

1070
02:03:09,683 --> 02:03:12,616
What are you laughing at?
Come and move this thing.

1071
02:03:12,786 --> 02:03:15,548
- You're all wet, sarge.
- Now get it up.

1072
02:03:22,296 --> 02:03:26,060
- What are you gonna do with this?
- "What are you gonna do with this?"

1073
02:03:26,233 --> 02:03:28,199
Siphon with it, idiot. Put it in.

1074
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:33,096
- What are you thinking?
- Same thing you are.

1075
02:03:33,273 --> 02:03:36,172
Those prisoners you brought
had rubber hoses on them.

1076
02:03:36,344 --> 02:03:38,640
They've been carrying those
to siphon gas?

1077
02:03:38,813 --> 02:03:41,303
At the Our River,
I saw a German fuel truck...

1078
02:03:41,481 --> 02:03:43,947
...drop oil drums in the water,
they floated.

1079
02:03:44,819 --> 02:03:47,752
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Gasoline, sir.

1080
02:03:47,922 --> 02:03:51,822
Empty fuel drums and men carrying
siphon hoses add up to one thing.

1081
02:03:51,993 --> 02:03:54,983
The Germans are low on gas.
They have to forage for it.

1082
02:03:55,163 --> 02:03:57,425
That's their weakness.

1083
02:03:58,933 --> 02:04:01,991
- Get this off to headquarters.
- Sir.

1084
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:06,863
A, what is the fuel consumption
of a Tiger tank?

1085
02:04:07,508 --> 02:04:11,306
B, the exact distance from the
Siegfried Line to the Meuse River.

1086
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:16,005
C, what is the estimate of fuel reserves
in the German army?

1087
02:04:16,185 --> 02:04:18,811
- That's it.
- Yes, sir, right away.

1088
02:04:22,457 --> 02:04:24,980
What are you laughing at, you idiot?

1089
02:04:34,503 --> 02:04:36,401
What is the situation in Bastogne?

1090
02:04:36,571 --> 02:04:39,629
Our forces have completely
encircled the Americans.

1091
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:44,470
Their situation is hopeless. They have
no recourse but to surrender.

1092
02:04:48,717 --> 02:04:52,014
Hey, look what's coming. Lieutenant!

1093
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:06,156
Halt!

1094
02:05:13,809 --> 02:05:16,241
The German commander wishes
to communicate...

1095
02:05:16,412 --> 02:05:19,937
...with the American commander
of the encircled town of Bastogne.

1096
02:05:20,116 --> 02:05:22,948
He's a little busy right now.
What's on your mind?

1097
02:05:25,121 --> 02:05:29,112
"From the German commanding general
to the commander of American troops...

1098
02:05:29,325 --> 02:05:30,950
...fighting in Bastogne.

1099
02:05:31,928 --> 02:05:33,951
With the changing fortunes of war...

1100
02:05:34,129 --> 02:05:37,426
...the U.S.A. Forces
in and around Bastogne...

1101
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:42,626
...have become completely surrounded
by superior German armored units.

1102
02:05:43,273 --> 02:05:46,240
The only possibility
to spare the American troops...

1103
02:05:46,409 --> 02:05:50,639
...from total annihilation
is their honorable surrender...

1104
02:05:50,847 --> 02:05:55,407
...which will also prevent the slaughter
of helpless civilians."

1105
02:05:56,119 --> 02:05:58,951
You have one hour of truce to reply.

1106
02:06:00,356 --> 02:06:02,322
Blindfold him.

1107
02:06:02,492 --> 02:06:04,355
Take him up to the command post.

1108
02:06:21,578 --> 02:06:23,737
Repeat, please.

1109
02:06:26,116 --> 02:06:27,979
Is that all?

1110
02:06:28,152 --> 02:06:30,948
Sir, I have a message from Bastogne.

1111
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,489
What is it?

1112
02:06:37,661 --> 02:06:40,423
I don't understand it.

1113
02:06:41,932 --> 02:06:45,765
"From the American commander of
Bastogne to the German commander.

1114
02:06:45,936 --> 02:06:47,663
Nuts."

1115
02:06:51,275 --> 02:06:53,104
Nuts.

1116
02:08:04,616 --> 02:08:06,582
Hey, over there.

1117
02:08:07,986 --> 02:08:09,281
Hey, it's an officer.

1118
02:08:09,486 --> 02:08:11,349
Boy, are we glad to see you.

1119
02:08:11,523 --> 02:08:14,422
- I haven't eaten in 12 hours.
- We got lost.

1120
02:08:14,626 --> 02:08:16,091
Hold it. Wait a minute.

1121
02:08:16,261 --> 02:08:19,057
Do you think we should surrender,
lieutenant?

1122
02:08:21,399 --> 02:08:23,262
Surrender?

1123
02:08:24,202 --> 02:08:25,862
No.

1124
02:08:27,906 --> 02:08:31,305
Just stay loose, all of you. Stay loose.

1125
02:08:31,509 --> 02:08:33,407
Now, give me that light.

1126
02:08:41,086 --> 02:08:43,882
All right, spread out.
Get some rest.

1127
02:08:44,055 --> 02:08:46,521
We'll get started when it's light.

1128
02:09:17,490 --> 02:09:18,853
General Grey.

1129
02:09:19,058 --> 02:09:21,456
Sir, this just came in.

1130
02:09:22,595 --> 02:09:25,960
- Move along.
- Any of you guys been to Ambleve?

1131
02:09:26,132 --> 02:09:28,121
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?

1132
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:32,462
- Any of you guys been to Ambleve?
- Come on, Guffy, we'll get in trouble.

1133
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:34,502
I gotta know.

1134
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:37,697
I've been to Ambleve.

1135
02:09:37,877 --> 02:09:39,467
- You know Ambleve inn?
- Yeah.

1136
02:09:39,645 --> 02:09:41,134
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

1137
02:09:41,314 --> 02:09:43,872
There's nothing left of it.

1138
02:09:48,454 --> 02:09:50,613
Guffy, come on.

1139
02:09:55,862 --> 02:09:58,385
When are they gonna let us fight?

1140
02:09:58,899 --> 02:10:00,728
Let's go.

1141
02:10:05,504 --> 02:10:09,461
It's here, sir, the information
you requested from headquarters.

1142
02:10:11,545 --> 02:10:13,135
That's it.

1143
02:10:13,313 --> 02:10:15,404
They're running out of gas.

1144
02:10:16,483 --> 02:10:19,507
Where's the spearhead of
the German advance right now?

1145
02:10:19,686 --> 02:10:23,519
We place it four miles past Ambleve,
moving west.

1146
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:25,417
Where will they be at daybreak?

1147
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:30,925
If they travel all night, they should be
nine miles due east of the fuel depot.

1148
02:10:31,132 --> 02:10:33,325
We'll be there to meet them.

1149
02:10:33,501 --> 02:10:36,263
I'm committing my tanks.

1150
02:10:36,436 --> 02:10:38,334
We'll use plan F.

1151
02:10:38,506 --> 02:10:41,735
- Get me Blue Code 301.
- 301.

1152
02:10:42,043 --> 02:10:46,341
All right, mount up. Crank them up.
Let's go. Let's go.

1153
02:10:49,150 --> 02:10:51,343
Let's go. Crank them up,
crank them up.

1154
02:11:13,407 --> 02:11:15,430
Look at that fog.

1155
02:11:16,378 --> 02:11:19,937
If it stays, we won't find them
and we won't fight.

1156
02:11:20,615 --> 02:11:23,548
If it lifts, they'll find us.

1157
02:11:24,285 --> 02:11:27,480
And that will be the end of our men
and our tanks.

1158
02:11:29,324 --> 02:11:32,052
And I'm praying that it lifts.

1159
02:11:34,129 --> 02:11:36,755
What does that make me, Dan?

1160
02:11:38,267 --> 02:11:40,233
A general.

1161
02:11:52,513 --> 02:11:55,003
Is that so, general?

1162
02:11:55,217 --> 02:11:56,739
It's very interesting.

1163
02:11:57,786 --> 02:11:59,809
Thank you, general.

1164
02:12:05,594 --> 02:12:08,618
Our column has made
the farthest advance.

1165
02:12:08,797 --> 02:12:14,665
We have outrun the other panzers.
The eyes of Germany are on us.

1166
02:12:14,837 --> 02:12:18,293
The Führer himself will decorate me.

1167
02:12:19,341 --> 02:12:22,002
We have done it, Conrad.
We have done it.

1168
02:12:22,177 --> 02:12:25,009
Then I was wrong.
We have won the war.

1169
02:12:25,547 --> 02:12:27,308
No.

1170
02:12:28,116 --> 02:12:30,139
You mean we have lost?

1171
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,286
No.

1172
02:12:33,156 --> 02:12:37,284
I don't understand. If we have not won
and we have not lost...

1173
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:38,789
...then what's happening?

1174
02:12:38,995 --> 02:12:42,657
The best thing possible is happening.
The war will go on.

1175
02:12:43,166 --> 02:12:46,327
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

1176
02:12:46,969 --> 02:12:50,164
On and on and on.

1177
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:54,574
- But it must come to an end.
- You're a fool, Conrad.

1178
02:12:54,777 --> 02:12:59,644
Those of us who understood
knew, in 1941, we could never win.

1179
02:13:00,184 --> 02:13:03,549
You mean, colonel, for three years,
we have been fighting...

1180
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:07,882
...without any hope of victory?
- There are many kinds of victory.

1181
02:13:08,057 --> 02:13:12,048
For the German army to survive,
for us to remain in uniform...

1182
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:14,855
...that is our victory.

1183
02:13:15,032 --> 02:13:19,865
Conrad, the world is not going
to get rid of us after all.

1184
02:13:21,838 --> 02:13:23,861
But when do we go home?

1185
02:13:25,742 --> 02:13:27,435
This is our home.

1186
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:35,513
And my sons? When do I see them?
What will become of them?

1187
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:41,815
They will become German soldiers,
and you will be proud of them.

1188
02:13:49,466 --> 02:13:50,795
Conrad.

1189
02:13:50,968 --> 02:13:55,630
You still have any of those delicacies left
you offered me at Ambleve?

1190
02:13:55,839 --> 02:13:56,861
Yes, sir.

1191
02:13:57,207 --> 02:14:01,403
Prepare them for me, will you?
I'm in very good appetite.

1192
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:08,239
- See anything?
- Nothing.

1193
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:10,613
It's like they disappeared.

1194
02:14:14,725 --> 02:14:17,215
- They been spotted yet?
- No, sir.

1195
02:14:17,394 --> 02:14:19,952
They must have changed course
during the night.

1196
02:14:22,067 --> 02:14:24,158
Call our scouts again.

1197
02:14:32,143 --> 02:14:34,735
- See anything?
- Nothing.

1198
02:14:35,245 --> 02:14:37,336
Red River Six. Red River Six.

1199
02:14:37,515 --> 02:14:39,344
Scouted designated territory.

1200
02:14:39,517 --> 02:14:41,073
No sign of German tanks.

1201
02:14:50,428 --> 02:14:55,159
Can't see 20 yards. They're nowhere
around, or I'd hear something.

1202
02:14:57,670 --> 02:14:59,260
Let's be reasonable, colonel.

1203
02:14:59,437 --> 02:15:02,598
You expect me to take you up?
Nothing's flying in this fog.

1204
02:15:02,775 --> 02:15:05,607
That makes it safe. We won't
bump into another plane.

1205
02:15:05,778 --> 02:15:09,371
How can we see the panzer column
when we have zero visibility?

1206
02:15:09,547 --> 02:15:13,675
You'll catch pneumonia if you don't
stop arguing. Get behind that stick.

1207
02:15:13,952 --> 02:15:15,884
Wait a minute.

1208
02:15:16,055 --> 02:15:17,680
Where are the flying orders?

1209
02:15:17,856 --> 02:15:19,788
I wanna see them.

1210
02:15:19,958 --> 02:15:22,720
I wanna know what lunatic
issued them.

1211
02:15:23,228 --> 02:15:26,718
There are no orders, Joe.
I'm the lunatic.

1212
02:15:27,733 --> 02:15:30,962
Well, there's no insanity in my family.

1213
02:15:31,570 --> 02:15:35,368
If we don't find that panzer column,
there will be no tank battle.

1214
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:37,631
We'll have to stop them with infantry.

1215
02:15:37,810 --> 02:15:40,834
A lot of guys are gonna die
to keep you safe and cozy.

1216
02:15:41,014 --> 02:15:43,947
You sure know how
to hit below the belt. That's dirty.

1217
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:48,182
We're not in a pillow fight, Joe.
Sorry it hurts.

1218
02:15:50,356 --> 02:15:52,345
Get in.

1219
02:15:56,195 --> 02:15:58,559
All reports negative, sir.

1220
02:16:08,207 --> 02:16:11,072
Well, they must be someplace.

1221
02:16:12,044 --> 02:16:15,034
The earth couldn't have just
swallowed them up.

1222
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:21,249
- Send out additional patrols.
- Yes, sir.

1223
02:16:30,629 --> 02:16:34,085
What am I doing up here?
It's like flying inside a light bulb.

1224
02:16:34,266 --> 02:16:37,199
Just stay on the course I gave you.
We'll find them.

1225
02:16:37,369 --> 02:16:40,359
- How do you know?
- Hessler's looking for gas.

1226
02:16:40,539 --> 02:16:43,802
He's gambling on capturing our supply.
Get lower.

1227
02:16:44,009 --> 02:16:47,443
- We're down to 500 feet.
- We just have to pick up a landmark.

1228
02:16:47,613 --> 02:16:51,275
Hills are all around. We'll pick up
a landmark right in the kisser.

1229
02:16:51,450 --> 02:16:53,279
Try it a little lower.

1230
02:17:02,462 --> 02:17:06,124
- I can't see a damn thing.
- All right, cut your engine.

1231
02:17:06,666 --> 02:17:08,962
Glide and listen. We can hear them.

1232
02:17:09,134 --> 02:17:14,968
- Are you telling me to glide at 200 feet?
- Cut the talk and the engine.

1233
02:17:32,626 --> 02:17:36,788
- I'm calling this off.
- Sure. Now, let's try it again.

1234
02:17:41,135 --> 02:17:43,601
Okay, cut your engine.

1235
02:17:47,141 --> 02:17:50,267
If we were 100 feet higher,
I'd jump and leave you here.

1236
02:17:50,444 --> 02:17:52,069
Quiet.

1237
02:18:01,521 --> 02:18:04,079
There's the depot.

1238
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:10,962
There's the river.

1239
02:18:12,366 --> 02:18:15,198
The column has to be due south.

1240
02:18:16,971 --> 02:18:18,300
That's your course.

1241
02:18:22,043 --> 02:18:24,704
Get her down, Joe,
where we can see.

1242
02:18:27,548 --> 02:18:31,073
- What's our altitude?
- Four hundred feet.

1243
02:18:31,252 --> 02:18:33,411
All right, cut the engine.

1244
02:18:42,196 --> 02:18:43,718
Do you hear that?

1245
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:46,127
Yeah. We're going down for a look.

1246
02:18:58,413 --> 02:19:01,209
Hit your engine, let's get out of here.

1247
02:19:03,652 --> 02:19:07,051
Red River Six, this is Red River Two.
The enemy column sighted.

1248
02:19:07,222 --> 02:19:11,350
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

1249
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:14,118
Enemy column sighted, sir.

1250
02:19:14,296 --> 02:19:16,228
Found them.

1251
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:20,896
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

1252
02:19:25,775 --> 02:19:28,367
Repeat. Enemy column sighted.

1253
02:19:32,581 --> 02:19:35,480
Come in, Red River Two.
Come in, Red River Two.

1254
02:19:35,685 --> 02:19:37,048
Come in, Red River Two.

1255
02:19:37,219 --> 02:19:39,447
- Contact broken.
- Where's that coordinate?

1256
02:19:39,622 --> 02:19:41,485
- Right here.
- What's the terrain?

1257
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:43,383
Low rolling hills.

1258
02:19:43,559 --> 02:19:46,117
Order our tanks to intercept them
at that point.

1259
02:19:46,295 --> 02:19:48,488
- Yes, sir.
- Red River Two.

1260
02:19:48,697 --> 02:19:51,926
- That's Kiley.
- I know.

1261
02:19:54,703 --> 02:19:56,794
There's a plane up there.

1262
02:19:58,474 --> 02:20:00,804
He's in trouble.

1263
02:20:16,493 --> 02:20:19,722
Medic! Medic!

1264
02:20:40,149 --> 02:20:41,774
Schneider.

1265
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:45,548
From Spitzbergen,
the weather forecast.

1266
02:20:45,756 --> 02:20:48,018
Warm front moving in.

1267
02:20:49,992 --> 02:20:53,949
Notify all columns, weather clearing.

1268
02:21:12,983 --> 02:21:15,973
Enemy forces are reported crossing
the River Meuse.

1269
02:21:16,154 --> 02:21:19,315
Send scouts forward.
I want their numbers and composition.

1270
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:20,546
Yes, sir.

1271
02:21:20,724 --> 02:21:23,714
Conrad. My binoculars.

1272
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:28,162
Conrad?

1273
02:21:36,541 --> 02:21:38,666
I was saying I wanted...

1274
02:21:40,745 --> 02:21:42,938
What is it, Conrad?

1275
02:21:43,114 --> 02:21:45,672
Nothing, sir.

1276
02:21:47,451 --> 02:21:51,909
I was saying I wanted my binoculars.

1277
02:21:55,860 --> 02:21:58,019
What's wrong?

1278
02:21:59,130 --> 02:22:03,531
I would like to be transferred
to other duties, sir.

1279
02:22:06,638 --> 02:22:12,097
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't ask me, sir. Just transfer me.

1280
02:22:13,145 --> 02:22:16,044
- For combat duty?
- Yes, sir.

1281
02:22:17,550 --> 02:22:21,484
You want to fight?
Very admirable, but why?

1282
02:22:23,722 --> 02:22:26,212
Personal reasons, sir.

1283
02:22:28,593 --> 02:22:30,991
Personal reasons.

1284
02:22:31,964 --> 02:22:36,126
Personal reasons? What the devil
are you trying to say?

1285
02:22:36,302 --> 02:22:39,463
It's the right of every German soldier
to ask permission...

1286
02:22:39,637 --> 02:22:41,830
...for a transfer to other duties.

1287
02:22:42,006 --> 02:22:45,496
It is the right of every commanding
officer to know the reason...

1288
02:22:45,678 --> 02:22:50,409
...for the transfer, and I want the truth.
- The truth...

1289
02:22:50,583 --> 02:22:54,574
...is that I'm a fool.
I believed in you.

1290
02:22:54,753 --> 02:22:57,481
But all you believe in is the war.

1291
02:22:57,656 --> 02:23:00,817
You have the war. You like the war.

1292
02:23:00,993 --> 02:23:04,427
And all I have are my sons,
and I don't want to lose them.

1293
02:23:05,264 --> 02:23:09,358
- I'm not responsible for your children.
- You are. You'd make them soldiers.

1294
02:23:09,536 --> 02:23:11,525
- Yes. They will fight.
- They will die.

1295
02:23:11,705 --> 02:23:15,298
- Lf necessary.
- Necessary for who? For you?

1296
02:23:17,010 --> 02:23:20,466
You are not only a fool,
you are a traitor.

1297
02:23:23,148 --> 02:23:26,309
And you are a murderer.

1298
02:23:26,486 --> 02:23:31,478
You would murder my sons.
You would murder my country.

1299
02:23:31,658 --> 02:23:35,183
You would murder the whole world
to stay in that uniform.

1300
02:23:43,803 --> 02:23:46,497
It is only the memory of you
as a friend...

1301
02:23:46,674 --> 02:23:50,574
...that prevents me from having you
court-martialed. Get out.

1302
02:23:59,653 --> 02:24:03,212
Our scouts have sighted a brigade
of medium tanks.

1303
02:24:04,825 --> 02:24:08,487
- Light armor at this point? Any artillery?
- None.

1304
02:24:08,662 --> 02:24:11,527
- And no infantry.
- They're committing their reserves.

1305
02:24:11,698 --> 02:24:15,462
We destroy them, they have nothing
between us and the fuel depot.

1306
02:24:16,603 --> 02:24:19,866
- Send all infantry to the rear.
- Yes, sir.

1307
02:24:21,341 --> 02:24:26,777
Diepel, assign this man to fuel trucks.

1308
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:31,682
Yes, sir.

1309
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:38,448
Sir, enemy advancing on our position.

1310
02:24:38,626 --> 02:24:42,116
Good. They've taken the bait.

1311
02:24:43,598 --> 02:24:45,223
Pritchard...

1312
02:24:45,399 --> 02:24:48,889
...we're going to test that information
we got from headquarters.

1313
02:24:50,371 --> 02:24:52,496
If it's accurate...

1314
02:24:52,940 --> 02:24:55,601
...we'll run them out of gas.

1315
02:24:58,547 --> 02:25:03,312
Tiger to all units, close hatches.
Forward.

1316
02:25:56,971 --> 02:25:59,699
Butcher, swing up and take positions
on the ridges.

1317
02:26:04,646 --> 02:26:09,479
And watch that damn gully.
This is no time to lose a track.

1318
02:26:37,913 --> 02:26:39,970
Here they come.

1319
02:26:47,055 --> 02:26:50,147
Hold your fire
till they're right on us.

1320
02:26:53,362 --> 02:26:56,921
Load with hypershot.
Make every one count.

1321
02:27:06,876 --> 02:27:08,536
- Hold your fire.
- How long?

1322
02:27:08,711 --> 02:27:10,438
Until I tell you!

1323
02:27:14,517 --> 02:27:16,177
Attack in staggered formation.

1324
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:19,410
First, Lion on the assault.
Second, Panther.

1325
02:27:23,426 --> 02:27:26,860
Remember, hold your fire
till they're within effective range.

1326
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:38,770
- How long are we gonna wait?
- Until we can hit a soft spot.

1327
02:27:39,710 --> 02:27:41,232
Steady.

1328
02:27:41,410 --> 02:27:42,705
Steady.

1329
02:27:42,879 --> 02:27:45,311
Hold it. Hold it.

1330
02:27:45,482 --> 02:27:48,916
Let them come on in. Let them come in.
That's the way.

1331
02:27:49,085 --> 02:27:51,881
Now! Let them have it!

1332
02:28:19,216 --> 02:28:22,445
Fire one more round,
then let's get the hell off this ridge.

1333
02:28:34,832 --> 02:28:38,266
There's one coming up over the rise.
You see him?

1334
02:28:40,170 --> 02:28:42,864
Steady, boy. Ready on.

1335
02:28:44,875 --> 02:28:46,864
Fire!

1336
02:28:57,555 --> 02:29:01,217
Tiger to Panther, spread out to left.
Lion, spread out to right.

1337
02:29:01,391 --> 02:29:03,448
We will try to encircle.

1338
02:29:08,533 --> 02:29:11,728
Sherman damaged.
We'll finish it off.

1339
02:29:11,903 --> 02:29:15,769
Fire! It's a hit.

1340
02:29:16,574 --> 02:29:18,540
The next, 11 o'clock, 900.

1341
02:29:24,649 --> 02:29:25,671
Get in among them.

1342
02:29:25,850 --> 02:29:29,181
Mix with them so they can't fire
without hitting each other.

1343
02:29:38,397 --> 02:29:42,661
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.
There's a Kraut at 1 o'clock...

1344
02:29:42,835 --> 02:29:44,733
...with a pennant on his antenna.

1345
02:29:46,738 --> 02:29:48,897
This one belongs to me. He's mine.

1346
02:29:49,575 --> 02:29:51,370
There he is.

1347
02:29:51,543 --> 02:29:56,604
All right, kick her left, kid. Left.
Now, hard right! Hard right!

1348
02:29:59,584 --> 02:30:04,110
Stay with them! Range, 9-0-0.
Up two.

1349
02:30:05,391 --> 02:30:07,084
Fire!

1350
02:30:08,961 --> 02:30:10,450
Good shot! We got him!

1351
02:30:10,863 --> 02:30:13,762
Load again. Nothing has happened.

1352
02:30:13,966 --> 02:30:17,092
Hey, watch it. They see us.
Hey, let's get out of here.

1353
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:23,198
Aim just ahead as he runs.

1354
02:30:30,082 --> 02:30:31,707
Fire!

1355
02:30:41,061 --> 02:30:42,959
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.

1356
02:30:43,129 --> 02:30:45,755
Come in, Butcher Three.
Report damage. Over.

1357
02:30:45,931 --> 02:30:50,764
I've got one dead and two wounded,
but we can still fight.

1358
02:30:52,372 --> 02:30:56,170
You lost your gun. Pull out. Try
to make it back to the assembly area.

1359
02:30:56,409 --> 02:30:58,568
We don't need a gun!
We can ram them.

1360
02:30:58,945 --> 02:31:01,138
Guffy, you're all busted up.

1361
02:31:01,314 --> 02:31:05,749
Get out of there and make it back to
the assembly area. That's an order. Out.

1362
02:31:06,753 --> 02:31:08,912
Get her over the hill.

1363
02:31:13,426 --> 02:31:15,517
Driver, halt.

1364
02:31:16,029 --> 02:31:17,689
Let's try to pick them off.

1365
02:31:17,897 --> 02:31:22,332
Ten o'clock. Sherman, 800. Fire!

1366
02:32:02,077 --> 02:32:03,975
Baker Battalion reporting in.

1367
02:32:04,145 --> 02:32:07,306
Two tanks destroyed, one damaged,
out of action.

1368
02:32:07,481 --> 02:32:11,540
Phantom Battalion reports six tanks
destroyed, nine out of action.

1369
02:32:11,719 --> 02:32:16,882
Butcher Battalion reports 11 tanks
destroyed, eight on fire.

1370
02:32:18,526 --> 02:32:21,358
Keep burning up their gas.

1371
02:32:32,774 --> 02:32:36,469
Commander to base,
I am returning to refuel.

1372
02:33:23,758 --> 02:33:25,986
We are cutting them to pieces.

1373
02:33:26,162 --> 02:33:28,890
And they are emptying our tanks.

1374
02:33:33,436 --> 02:33:37,929
They are deliberately sacrificing
their armor to bleed us dry.

1375
02:33:39,243 --> 02:33:43,143
- What is the distance to the fuel depot?
- Twelve kilometers.

1376
02:33:43,946 --> 02:33:46,003
You will continue the battle here.

1377
02:33:46,182 --> 02:33:49,240
Let them believe their strategy
is succeeding.

1378
02:33:49,418 --> 02:33:52,317
I want 15 tanks and all
the empty trucks.

1379
02:33:52,488 --> 02:33:56,616
- I'm going on to the depot.
- Yes, sir, 15 tanks and fuel trucks.

1380
02:33:57,059 --> 02:33:58,820
Forward.

1381
02:34:17,714 --> 02:34:21,443
Hey, come on, soldier.
You can make it.

1382
02:34:32,396 --> 02:34:34,089
Pull it off the road!

1383
02:34:34,298 --> 02:34:36,788
- Wait!
- Come on! Come on!

1384
02:34:40,871 --> 02:34:44,396
Pull it off the road! Pull it off!

1385
02:34:46,477 --> 02:34:48,500
Get off the tank.

1386
02:34:48,679 --> 02:34:51,340
- Stay off the tank!
- You've got plenty of room.

1387
02:34:51,515 --> 02:34:54,710
- You can carry these guys.
- This tank ain't going no place.

1388
02:34:54,885 --> 02:34:57,113
Get off the tank!

1389
02:34:57,689 --> 02:34:59,746
Wherever you're going,
you better walk.

1390
02:34:59,923 --> 02:35:02,890
- What are you waiting here for?
- For the Germans.

1391
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:05,618
They gotta come by here.

1392
02:35:06,863 --> 02:35:08,624
And I still got a machine gun.

1393
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:11,923
There's not much you can
do with that.

1394
02:35:12,135 --> 02:35:15,330
- How much ammo do you have left?
- Two belts.

1395
02:35:15,505 --> 02:35:18,563
That will take care of some of them.

1396
02:35:19,743 --> 02:35:23,871
You got a wounded man. You think
you ought to get him to the medics?

1397
02:35:24,548 --> 02:35:27,572
Oh, he's not too bad.
He can still fight.

1398
02:35:28,952 --> 02:35:30,212
Get on, fellas.

1399
02:35:30,387 --> 02:35:33,843
Pull this tank back.
Head it west towards the River Meuse.

1400
02:35:34,024 --> 02:35:36,923
I'm warning you, lieutenant,
stay off my tank.

1401
02:35:41,965 --> 02:35:45,023
Either put up that gun or fire it,
sergeant.

1402
02:35:51,375 --> 02:35:54,809
It's okay, sarge. It's okay.

1403
02:36:30,615 --> 02:36:34,071
General, another panzer column
has been spotted four miles...

1404
02:36:34,252 --> 02:36:37,242
...from the River Meuse.
- Where did they come from?

1405
02:36:38,023 --> 02:36:40,513
Get me the officer in charge
of the fuel depot.

1406
02:36:40,725 --> 02:36:43,021
Get Silver Cloud 201. Quickly.

1407
02:36:43,228 --> 02:36:45,626
It's not a new column.

1408
02:36:46,932 --> 02:36:48,454
It's Hessler.

1409
02:36:48,633 --> 02:36:52,692
- He slipped away from the battle.
- The fuel depot, sir.

1410
02:36:52,871 --> 02:36:56,600
General Grey speaking.
I'm giving you this order personally.

1411
02:36:56,775 --> 02:36:59,970
Destroy the fuel depot at once.
I repeat.

1412
02:37:00,179 --> 02:37:02,372
Destroy the fuel depot at once.

1413
02:37:02,548 --> 02:37:07,882
Yes, sir. I'll destroy the depot
immediately, sir. Set it on fire.

1414
02:37:08,052 --> 02:37:12,987
No, sir, not a drop. I'll make sure
of that, sir. They won't get a drop.

1415
02:37:15,895 --> 02:37:20,023
All right, let's get these bodies
out of here. Let's go. Move!

1416
02:37:37,584 --> 02:37:41,348
Elke and Eisner report fuel
exhausted, sir.

1417
02:37:41,521 --> 02:37:43,510
What's Hessler's present position?

1418
02:37:43,690 --> 02:37:47,089
He reports being three kilometers
from the American fuel depot.

1419
02:37:47,292 --> 02:37:49,588
We must get there.

1420
02:37:49,796 --> 02:37:54,289
He will do it. Hessler will do it.

1421
02:38:07,046 --> 02:38:09,945
No shooting. I'll do the talking.

1422
02:38:10,116 --> 02:38:11,581
Get back to your post.

1423
02:38:16,623 --> 02:38:19,385
- Hold it up there, sergeant.
- Stop it.

1424
02:38:19,927 --> 02:38:23,918
- What can I do for you boys?
- We just made it. Could you fill her up?

1425
02:38:24,097 --> 02:38:28,088
Sure. Give you a hand, soldier. Sure.

1426
02:38:28,402 --> 02:38:30,800
Corporal, bring some of those
cans over here.

1427
02:38:30,971 --> 02:38:32,698
A couple of you boys help out.

1428
02:38:33,072 --> 02:38:37,530
Sergeant, we'll have you gassed up
and on your way in no time.

1429
02:38:37,711 --> 02:38:39,973
Get on your machine gun.

1430
02:38:40,147 --> 02:38:42,943
- Hey, lieutenant.
- Yeah?

1431
02:38:44,418 --> 02:38:48,546
Weren't you directing traffic
at the Our River Bridge?

1432
02:38:48,756 --> 02:38:52,155
Does the road to Ambleve
still lead to Malmedy?

1433
02:39:10,878 --> 02:39:12,571
Stop.

1434
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:23,582
This fuel dump must be taken intact.

1435
02:39:26,994 --> 02:39:29,460
No shooting.

1436
02:39:48,350 --> 02:39:51,943
- Look. Let's get out of here.
- Hold it. They'll capture the gas.

1437
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:54,450
We can't just leave it.

1438
02:39:56,024 --> 02:40:00,686
- What are you waiting for? Let's go.
- Hold it! They're after the gas.

1439
02:40:02,497 --> 02:40:06,022
- We ought to blow it up.
- We can't set a match to all that.

1440
02:40:06,202 --> 02:40:10,637
- We got no orders, lieutenant.
- Yeah? Well, I'm giving the orders.

1441
02:40:11,072 --> 02:40:14,233
Hey, lieutenant,
one of them is still alive.

1442
02:40:17,245 --> 02:40:20,077
Hold it! Hold it! He's one of ours.

1443
02:40:22,017 --> 02:40:24,074
- I got you, colonel.
- Burn it.

1444
02:40:24,253 --> 02:40:26,685
- Take it easy. I know what to do.
- Burn it.

1445
02:40:26,855 --> 02:40:29,754
- Give him a hand, if you can.
- Burn it.

1446
02:40:29,959 --> 02:40:34,087
Come on, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!

1447
02:40:34,396 --> 02:40:37,989
Get those barrels off the end
of that ramp. Hold your fire, Guffy.

1448
02:40:38,167 --> 02:40:41,498
Move your tank behind that pile
until I tell you to shove.

1449
02:40:41,671 --> 02:40:45,537
You, get me some hand grenades
off the tank. Come on.

1450
02:40:50,513 --> 02:40:51,978
Come on.

1451
02:40:53,349 --> 02:40:56,214
You, get to that gas truck
and open all the valves.

1452
02:40:56,385 --> 02:40:59,716
Then get the hell away from it.

1453
02:41:23,413 --> 02:41:25,311
All right, roll them down.

1454
02:41:28,050 --> 02:41:29,379
Get off the road.

1455
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:31,879
Give me a hand grenade.

1456
02:42:26,677 --> 02:42:28,438
He's getting away.

1457
02:42:34,385 --> 02:42:36,875
Okay, shove.

1458
02:42:45,696 --> 02:42:49,824
Don't stop! Keep going! Don't stop!

1459
02:44:24,999 --> 02:44:26,828
Get this message to headquarters:

1460
02:44:27,001 --> 02:44:31,902
They've abandoned their tanks,
and they're walking back to Germany.
