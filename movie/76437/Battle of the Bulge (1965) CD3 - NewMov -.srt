1
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:35,803
Major Wolenski!

2
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,907
The general.

3
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:44,016
Hurry up! Move that ammo up!

4
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,752
Wolenski, we've been ordered out.

5
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:53,382
I'll need time to save what I can. Your
outfit will have to cover the withdrawal.

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,552
- They're coming down the chimney, sir.
- Do what you can.

7
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,425
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

8
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:03,129
I only loaned you this rifle.

9
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:07,733
- See you later, major.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,644
Spread out.

11
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:34,330
Bring up ammo!

12
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,868
Sister.

13
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:24,766
Colonel, excuse me.

14
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:27,106
We are looking for someone
who can help.

15
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,872
Be brief.

16
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,143
There are many wounded townspeople
in the church cellar.

17
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,811
We need medicine, bandages.
Can you spare any?

18
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:37,751
We have nothing to spare.

19
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:41,291
If there are captured medical supplies,
give them to the nuns.

20
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:44,293
Yes, sir. Follow me.

21
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:19,363
He fired with this.

22
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:27,801
Jean, Jean, Jean!

23
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,875
Don't do anything to him, please.

24
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:37,516
This is the boy's father.

25
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:41,017
I beg you. He's just a little boy.

26
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:43,816
He's my only child.

27
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:47,520
Don't do anything to him, please.

28
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,864
Release the boy.

29
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,369
Jean.

30
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:04,073
Shoot the father.

31
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,980
- Papa! Papa!
- No!

32
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:21,053
Colonel.

33
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:23,696
The senior American officer
taken prisoner...

34
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,059
...requests permission
to speak with you.

35
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:29,498
- What does he want?
- He'll only discuss it with you.

36
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,796
- Rank?
- Major.

37
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,374
- He has two minutes.
- Yes, sir.

38
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:51,952
Conrad.

39
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:58,425
- What is this food?
- It's the best this town has to offer.

40
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:01,931
I told you, tanks run on petrol
and soldiers run on rations.

41
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:06,766
I must eat as my men do so I know
how far they can go. Take it away.

42
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,378
- Conrad.
- Yeah?

43
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:26,622
My Christmas present,
it's for your sons.

44
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,624
Your promotion to first sergeant.

45
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:39,901
My sons thank you.

46
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,507
Go in.

47
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:50,609
What is it?

48
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:54,413
Colonel, stragglers you've captured
tell me...

49
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,819
...that helpless American prisoners
have been massacred.

50
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:01,422
- Where?
- Malmedy.

51
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:06,498
And as senior officer, I can't control
my men unless I have your assurance...

52
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,830
...they'll not be murdered. I want your
signed order stating that my men...

53
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,302
...will be accorded the protection...

54
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:16,670
...guaranteed prisoners of war
by the Geneva Convention.

55
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:21,036
Unless I return with that order, colonel,
the prisoners will riot.

56
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:24,115
Undoubtedly, you'll kill us,
but so help me...

57
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:27,117
...we'll take a hell of a lot
of you with us.

58
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,980
There will be no signed order.
There will be no riot.

59
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:35,218
You will not be allowed to return
to your men to instigate that riot.

60
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:39,227
You listen to me, colonel.

61
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:41,627
There are survivors in all massacres.

62
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,395
I warn you,
if any of my men are harmed...

63
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:49,372
...you will be held responsible. There will
be no place on earth that you can hide.

64
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:54,445
And when you're found, I hope I'm the
man that ties the rope around your neck.

65
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,043
Major...

66
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,178
...I have never liked threats.

67
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,847
I do not kill prisoners.

68
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:11,396
But I will have no compunction at
shooting you myself for your last remark.

69
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,498
Then do it.

70
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:24,375
You are deliberately trying
to provoke me.

71
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,009
Yes, colonel, that's right.

72
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:34,551
If I walk out of here alive, I know
my men will be properly treated.

73
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,584
Diepel!

74
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:44,556
Return this officer
to the prisoners' compound, alive.

75
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,255
Come.

76
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,359
Major, I'm relying on you
to reassure your men...

77
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:55,872
...I have no time
for troublesome prisoners.

78
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:03,312
Tiger to Standard O-bay,
General Kohler.

79
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:08,919
Your usual ration, sir.

80
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:14,786
General Kohler. Hessler.

81
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:20,160
General, is it true that American
prisoners were executed at Malmedy?

82
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,994
There are SS units
in the Malmedy sector.

83
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:27,071
I can't assume responsibility
for every soldier on this front.

84
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,939
Do you realize the consequences
of this act?

85
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:34,842
I have lost 17 tanks and a battalion
of men leveling Amblève...

86
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:38,575
...for the sole purpose of reducing
the enemy's will to fight.

87
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:42,017
This massacre will stiffen resistance
to us everywhere.

88
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:46,488
It will turn a demoralized mob
into avenging soldiers.

89
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:48,627
You are being insolent, colonel.

90
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:50,695
Concern yourself with your mission.

91
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:53,492
You are to reach Saint-Michel
by 1600 tomorrow.

92
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,830
- Be there.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:32,037
They've taken a beating,
and they look it.

94
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,636
They're not a rabble.

95
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,504
They're retreating like soldiers.

96
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:44,046
There's still fight in them.

97
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:47,520
Where are we gonna stop
and put up the fight?

98
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:52,152
At our last line of defense,
the River Meuse.

99
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,226
We'll cross it
and dig in on the west bank.

100
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:58,023
At least we'll get the Germans wet.

101
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,668
Still sore I pulled you out of Amblève?

102
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,670
I was contributing
to the war effort there, sir.

103
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,277
Try to keep your feet from freezing
while we figure a way to stop them.

104
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:13,571
They've made mistakes before.

105
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:16,271
Where have they made one this time?

106
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:20,352
Well, they got me mad at them.

107
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,959
Shut up. We'll get there.

108
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,530
Come on. Come on.

109
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:43,069
Keep moving! Keep moving!

110
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:46,939
- What's holding you up?
- I'm out of gas.

111
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:50,310
I reported low about an hour ago.
Where's the fuel truck?

112
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,486
Get off the road and wait for it.
Keep moving.

113
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,178
- Pull it over.
- Move it!

114
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:00,920
Come on!

115
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,624
Keep moving.

116
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,791
Keep moving. Move it.

117
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:23,346
Where are you going?
Will you wait a minute?

118
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:25,643
I need gas.

119
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,110
Oh, get down.

120
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,491
Why, you ugly jerk!

121
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:49,332
Here, use your big mouth on that.

122
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,737
Hey, come on, let's get with it.

123
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,185
What are you laughing at?
Come and move this thing.

124
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:03,117
- You're all wet, sarge.
- Now get it up.

125
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:13,628
- What are you gonna do with this?
- "What are you gonna do with this?"

126
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,768
Siphon with it, idiot. Put it in.

127
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:20,665
- What are you thinking?
- Same thing you are.

128
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,741
Those prisoners you brought
had rubber hoses on them.

129
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,208
They've been carrying those
to siphon gas?

130
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,870
At the Our River,
I saw a German fuel truck...

131
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:31,516
...drop oil drums in the water,
they floated.

132
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:35,320
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Gasoline, sir.

133
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:39,390
Empty fuel drums and men carrying
siphon hoses add up to one thing.

134
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,551
The Germans are low on gas.
They have to forage for it.

135
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:44,993
That's their weakness.

136
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:49,559
- Get this off to headquarters.
- Sir.

137
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:54,430
A, what is the fuel consumption
of a Tiger tank?

138
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:58,874
B, the exact distance from the
Siegfried Line to the Meuse River.

139
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:03,573
C, what is the estimate of fuel reserves
in the German army?

140
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,378
- That's it.
- Yes, sir, right away.

141
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,548
What are you laughing at, you idiot?

142
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,968
What is the situation in Bastogne?

143
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:27,197
Our forces have completely
encircled the Americans.

144
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:32,037
Their situation is hopeless. They have
no recourse but to surrender.

145
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:39,581
Hey, look what's coming. Lieutenant!

146
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:53,723
Halt!

147
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,808
The German commander wishes
to communicate...

148
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:07,503
...with the American commander
of the encircled town of Bastogne.

149
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,513
He's a little busy right now.
What's on your mind?

150
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:16,678
"From the German commanding general
to the commander of American troops...

151
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,516
...fighting in Bastogne.

152
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,517
With the changing fortunes of war...

153
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:24,993
...the U.S.A. Forces
in and around Bastogne...

154
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:30,192
...have become completely surrounded
by superior German armored units.

155
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:33,806
The only possibility
to spare the American troops...

156
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:38,205
...from total annihilation
is their honorable surrender...

157
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:42,973
...which will also prevent the slaughter
of helpless civilians. "

158
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:46,516
You have one hour of truce to reply.

159
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,888
Blindfold him.

160
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,921
Take him up to the command post.

161
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,303
Repeat, please.

162
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,544
Is that all?

163
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,513
Sir, I have a message from Bastogne.

164
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,054
What is it?

165
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:27,988
I don't understand it.

166
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:33,329
"From the American commander of
Bastogne to the German commander.

167
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,228
Nuts. "

168
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:40,669
Nuts.

169
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,146
Hey, over there.

170
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,845
Hey, it's an officer.

171
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,914
Boy, are we glad to see you.

172
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:01,986
- I haven't eaten in 12 hours.
- We got lost.

173
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,655
Hold it. Wait a minute.

174
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:06,621
Do you think we should surrender,
lieutenant?

175
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,826
Surrender?

176
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:13,425
No.

177
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:18,869
Just stay loose, all of you. Stay loose.

178
00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:20,971
Now, give me that light.

179
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,446
All right, spread out.
Get some rest.

180
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,085
We'll get started when it's light.

181
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:06,416
General Grey.

182
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:09,019
Sir, this just came in.

183
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:13,523
- Move along.
- Any of you guys been to Amblève?

184
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,684
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?

185
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:20,025
- Any of you guys been to Amblève?
- Come on, Guffy, we'll get in trouble.

186
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:22,064
I gotta know.

187
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,260
I've been to Amblève.

188
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:27,030
- You know Amblève inn?
- Yeah.

189
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,696
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

190
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:31,434
There's nothing left of it.

191
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:38,176
Guffy, come on.

192
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:45,947
When are they gonna let us fight?

193
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,290
Let's go.

194
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:57,024
It's here, sir, the information
you requested from headquarters.

195
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:00,697
That's it.

196
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:02,966
They're running out of gas.

197
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:07,069
Where's the spearhead of
the German advance right now?

198
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:11,080
We place it four miles past Amblève,
moving west.

199
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,979
Where will they be at daybreak?

200
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:18,487
If they travel all night, they should be
nine miles due east of the fuel depot.

201
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,886
We'll be there to meet them.

202
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,824
I'm committing my tanks.

203
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,896
We'll use plan F.

204
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:29,296
- Get me Blue Code 301.
- 301.

205
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:33,902
All right, mount up. Crank them up.
Let's go. Let's go.

206
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,904
Let's go. Crank them up,
crank them up.

207
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:02,991
Look at that fog.

208
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:07,497
If it stays, we won't find them
and we won't fight.

209
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:11,109
If it lifts, they'll find us.

210
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:15,041
And that will be the end of our men
and our tanks.

211
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:19,612
And I'm praying that it lifts.

212
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:24,315
What does that make me, Dan?

213
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,793
A general.

214
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:42,563
Is that so, general?

215
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,299
It's very interesting.

216
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,369
Thank you, general.

217
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:56,178
Our column has made
the farthest advance.

218
00:21:56,355 --> 00:22:02,225
We have outrun the other panzers.
The eyes of Germany are on us.

219
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:05,852
The Führer himself will decorate me.

220
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:09,561
We have done it, Conrad.
We have done it.

221
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:12,568
Then I was wrong.
We have won the war.

222
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:14,868
No.

223
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:17,699
You mean we have lost?

224
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:19,845
No.

225
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:24,843
I don't understand. If we have not won
and we have not lost...

226
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:26,348
...then what's happening?

227
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:30,215
The best thing possible is happening.
The war will go on.

228
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:33,886
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

229
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,724
On and on and on.

230
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:42,133
- But it must come to an end.
- You're a fool, Conrad.

231
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:47,203
Those of us who understood
knew, in 1941, we could never win.

232
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,107
You mean, colonel, for three years,
we have been fighting...

233
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:55,441
...without any hope of victory?
- There are many kinds of victory.

234
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:59,607
For the German army to survive,
for us to remain in uniform...

235
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:02,413
...that is our victory.

236
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:07,423
Conrad, the world is not going
to get rid of us after all.

237
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:11,420
But when do we go home?

238
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,994
This is our home.

239
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:23,072
And my sons? When do I see them?
What will become of them?

240
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:29,373
They will become German soldiers,
and you will be proud of them.

241
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,353
Conrad.

242
00:23:38,524 --> 00:23:43,188
You still have any of those delicacies left
you offered me at Amblève?

243
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,419
Yes, sir.

244
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:48,961
Prepare them for me, will you?
I'm in very good appetite.

245
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,797
- See anything?
- Nothing.

246
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:58,170
It's like they disappeared.

247
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:04,772
- They been spotted yet?
- No, sir.

248
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,510
They must have changed course
during the night.

249
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,715
Call our scouts again.

250
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:22,292
- See anything?
- Nothing.

251
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:24,894
Red River Six. Red River Six.

252
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,901
Scouted designated territory.

253
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:28,630
No sign of German tanks.

254
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:42,716
Can't see 20 yards. They're nowhere
around, or I'd hear something.

255
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:46,816
Let's be reasonable, colonel.

256
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:50,155
You expect me to take you up?
Nothing's flying in this fog.

257
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:53,162
That makes it safe. We won't
bump into another plane.

258
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:56,927
How can we see the panzer column
when we have zero visibility?

259
00:24:57,102 --> 00:25:01,232
You'll catch pneumonia if you don't
stop arguing. Get behind that stick.

260
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:03,441
Wait a minute.

261
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,236
Where are the flying orders?

262
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:07,345
I wanna see them.

263
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:10,277
I wanna know what lunatic
issued them.

264
00:25:10,783 --> 00:25:14,275
There are no orders, Joe.
I'm the lunatic.

265
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:18,518
Well, there's no insanity in my family.

266
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:22,924
If we don't find that panzer column,
there will be no tank battle.

267
00:25:23,095 --> 00:25:25,188
We'll have to stop them with infantry.

268
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:28,390
A lot of guys are gonna die
to keep you safe and cozy.

269
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,502
You sure know how
to hit below the belt. That's dirty.

270
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:35,737
We're not in a pillow fight, Joe.
Sorry it hurts.

271
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,901
Get in.

272
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:46,115
All reports negative, sir.

273
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,628
Well, they must be someplace.

274
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:02,590
The earth couldn't have just
swallowed them up.

275
00:26:05,404 --> 00:26:08,805
- Send out additional patrols.
- Yes, sir.

276
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:21,641
What am I doing up here?
It's like flying inside a light bulb.

277
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,755
Just stay on the course I gave you.
We'll find them.

278
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:27,915
- How do you know?
- Hessler's looking for gas.

279
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:31,358
He's gambling on capturing our supply.
Get lower.

280
00:26:31,563 --> 00:26:34,999
- We're down to 500 feet.
- We just have to pick up a landmark.

281
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:38,830
Hills are all around. We'll pick up
a landmark right in the kisser.

282
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,835
Try it a little lower.

283
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:53,678
- I can't see a damn thing.
- All right, cut your engine.

284
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:56,517
Glide and listen. We can hear them.

285
00:26:56,688 --> 00:27:02,524
- Are you telling me to glide at 200 feet?
- Cut the talk and the engine.

286
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:24,343
- I'm calling this off.
- Sure. Now, let's try it again.

287
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,155
Okay, cut your engine.

288
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,821
If we were 100 feet higher,
I'd jump and leave you here.

289
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:39,623
Quiet.

290
00:27:49,074 --> 00:27:51,634
There's the depot.

291
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:58,516
There's the river.

292
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:02,751
The column has to be due south.

293
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:05,854
That's your course.

294
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:12,257
Get her down, Joe,
where we can see.

295
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,627
- What's our altitude?
- Four hundred feet.

296
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:20,965
All right, cut the engine.

297
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:31,272
Do you hear that?

298
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,680
Yeah. We're going down for a look.

299
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:48,762
Hit your engine, let's get out of here.

300
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:54,604
Red River Six, this is Red River Two.
The enemy column sighted.

301
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:58,903
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

302
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:01,671
Enemy column sighted, sir.

303
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:03,781
Found them.

304
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,449
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

305
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:15,919
Repeat. Enemy column sighted.

306
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:23,033
Come in, Red River Two.
Come in, Red River Two.

307
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:24,600
Come in, Red River Two.

308
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,000
- Contact broken.
- Where's that coordinate?

309
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:29,037
- Right here.
- What's the terrain?

310
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:30,936
Low rolling hills.

311
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:33,669
Order our tanks to intercept them
at that point.

312
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:36,040
- Yes, sir.
- Red River Two.

313
00:29:36,248 --> 00:29:39,479
- That's Kiley.
- I know.

314
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:44,347
There's a plane up there.

315
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:48,356
He's in trouble.

316
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:07,273
Medic! Medic!

317
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:29,326
Schneider.

318
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,099
From Spitzbergen,
the weather forecast.

319
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:35,569
Warm front moving in.

320
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:41,501
Notify all columns, weather clearing.

321
00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:03,524
Enemy forces are reported crossing
the River Meuse.

322
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:06,865
Send scouts forward.
I want their numbers and composition.

323
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,097
Yes, sir.

324
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:11,265
Conrad. My binoculars.

325
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,713
Conrad?

326
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:26,216
I was saying I wanted...

327
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:30,488
What is it, Conrad?

328
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:33,222
Nothing, sir.

329
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,460
I was saying I wanted my binoculars.

330
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:45,569
What's wrong?

331
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:51,081
I would like to be transferred
to other duties, sir.

332
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:59,647
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't ask me, sir. Just transfer me.

333
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:03,593
- For combat duty?
- Yes, sir.

334
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:09,033
You want to fight?
Very admirable, but why?

335
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,760
Personal reasons, sir.

336
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,541
Personal reasons.

337
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:23,675
Personal reasons? What the devil
are you trying to say?

338
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:27,012
It's the right of every German soldier
to ask permission...

339
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:29,380
...for a transfer to other duties.

340
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:33,046
It is the right of every commanding
officer to know the reason...

341
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:37,958
...for the transfer, and I want the truth.
- The truth...

342
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,123
...is that I'm a fool.
I believed in you.

343
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,030
But all you believe in is the war.

344
00:32:45,203 --> 00:32:48,366
You have the war. You like the war.

345
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,976
And all I have are my sons,
and I don't want to lose them.

346
00:32:52,811 --> 00:32:56,907
- I'm not responsible for your children.
- You are. You'd make them soldiers.

347
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:59,073
- Yes. They will fight.
- They will die.

348
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:02,846
- If necessary.
- Necessary for who? For you?

349
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:08,014
You are not only a fool,
you are a traitor.

350
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:13,858
And you are a murderer.

351
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:19,026
You would murder my sons.
You would murder my country.

352
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:22,731
You would murder the whole world
to stay in that uniform.

353
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:34,045
It is only the memory of you
as a friend...

354
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:38,121
...that prevents me from having you
court-martialed. Get out.

355
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:50,760
Our scouts have sighted a brigade
of medium tanks.

356
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,033
- Light armor at this point? Any artillery?
- None.

357
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,075
- And no infantry.
- They're committing their reserves.

358
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:03,010
We destroy them, they have nothing
between us and the fuel depot.

359
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:07,414
- Send all infantry to the rear.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:34:08,887 --> 00:34:14,325
Diepel, assign this man to fuel trucks.

361
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,229
Yes, sir.

362
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:25,995
Sir, enemy advancing on our position.

363
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:29,663
Good. They've taken the bait.

364
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:32,769
Pritchard...

365
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:36,436
...we're going to test that information
we got from headquarters.

366
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,043
If it's accurate...

367
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:43,147
...we'll run them out of gas.

368
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:50,858
Tiger to all units, close hatches.
Forward.

369
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:47,246
Butcher, swing up and take positions
on the ridges.

370
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,025
And watch that damn gully.
This is no time to lose a track.

371
00:36:25,457 --> 00:36:27,516
Here they come.

372
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,693
Hold your fire
till they're right on us.

373
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:44,466
Load with hypershot.
Make every one count.

374
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:56,080
- Hold your fire.
- How long?

375
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:57,983
Until I tell you!

376
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,721
Attack in staggered formation.

377
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:06,955
First, Lion on the assault.
Second, Panther.

378
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:14,405
Remember, hold your fire
till they're within effective range.

379
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:26,314
- How long are we gonna wait?
- Until we can hit a soft spot.

380
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:28,776
Steady.

381
00:37:28,953 --> 00:37:30,250
Steady.

382
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,856
Hold it. Hold it.

383
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:36,460
Let them come on in. Let them come in.
That's the way.

384
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:39,426
Now! Let them have it!

385
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:09,989
Fire one more round,
then let's get the hell off this ridge.

386
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:25,809
There's one coming up over the rise.
You see him?

387
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:30,408
Steady, boy. Ready on.

388
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,408
Fire!

389
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:48,759
Tiger to Panther, spread out to left.
Lion, spread out to right.

390
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,992
We will try to encircle.

391
00:38:56,074 --> 00:38:59,271
Sherman damaged.
We'll finish it off.

392
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:03,312
Fire! It's a hit.

393
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:06,083
The next, 11 o'clock, 900.

394
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,214
Get in among them.

395
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:16,724
Mix with them so they can't fire
without hitting each other.

396
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:30,203
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.
There's a Kraut at 1 o'clock...

397
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,275
...with a pennant on his antenna.

398
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:36,440
This one belongs to me. He's mine.

399
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:38,912
There he is.

400
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:44,146
All right, kick her left, kid. Left.
Now, hard right! Hard right!

401
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:51,653
Stay with them! Range, 9-0-0.
Up two.

402
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:54,626
Fire!

403
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,991
Good shot! We got him!

404
00:39:58,403 --> 00:40:01,304
Load again. Nothing has happened.

405
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:04,634
Hey, watch it. They see us.
Hey, let's get out of here.

406
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:10,739
Aim just ahead as he runs.

407
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,249
Fire!

408
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,500
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.

409
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:33,296
<i>Come in, Butcher Three. </i>
<i>Report damage. Over. </i>

410
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:38,306
I've got one dead and two wounded,
but we can still fight.

411
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:43,711
You lost your gun. Pull out. Try
to make it back to the assembly area.

412
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:46,109
We don't need a gun!
We can ram them.

413
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:48,679
Guffy, you're all busted up.

414
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:53,290
Get out of there and make it back to
the assembly area. That's an order. Out.

415
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,453
Get her over the hill.

416
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:03,058
Driver, halt.

417
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:05,229
Let's try to pick them off.

418
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:09,873
Ten o'clock. Sherman, 800. Fire!

419
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:51,514
Baker Battalion reporting in.

420
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:54,846
Two tanks destroyed, one damaged,
out of action.

421
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:59,080
Phantom Battalion reports six tanks
destroyed, nine out of action.

422
00:41:59,257 --> 00:42:04,422
Butcher Battalion reports 11 tanks
destroyed, eight on fire.

423
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:08,897
Keep burning up their gas.

424
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:24,008
Commander to base,
I am returning to refuel.

425
00:43:11,295 --> 00:43:13,525
We are cutting them to pieces.

426
00:43:13,698 --> 00:43:16,428
And they are emptying our tanks.

427
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:25,466
They are deliberately sacrificing
their armor to bleed us dry.

428
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:30,680
- What is the distance to the fuel depot?
- Twelve kilometers.

429
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:33,541
You will continue the battle here.

430
00:43:33,718 --> 00:43:36,778
Let them believe their strategy
is succeeding.

431
00:43:36,954 --> 00:43:39,855
I want 15 tanks and all
the empty trucks.

432
00:43:40,024 --> 00:43:44,154
- I'm going on to the depot.
- Yes, sir, 15 tanks and fuel trucks.

433
00:43:44,595 --> 00:43:46,358
Forward.

434
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:08,980
Hey, come on, soldier.
You can make it.

435
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:21,626
Pull it off the road!

436
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,324
- Wait!
- Come on! Come on!

437
00:44:28,406 --> 00:44:31,933
Pull it off the road! Pull it off!

438
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:36,036
Get off the tank.

439
00:44:36,214 --> 00:44:38,876
- Stay off the tank!
- You've got plenty of room.

440
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,247
- You can carry these guys.
- This tank ain't going no place.

441
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,650
Get off the tank!

442
00:44:45,223 --> 00:44:47,282
Wherever you're going,
you better walk.

443
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:50,427
- What are you waiting here for?
- For the Germans.

444
00:44:50,595 --> 00:44:53,155
They gotta come by here.

445
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:56,161
And I still got a machine gun.

446
00:44:57,435 --> 00:44:59,460
There's not much you can
do with that.

447
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,867
- How much ammo do you have left?
- Two belts.

448
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,100
That will take care of some of them.

449
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:11,408
You got a wounded man. You think
you ought to get him to the medics?

450
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:15,109
Oh, he's not too bad.
He can still fight.

451
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:17,749
Get on, fellas.

452
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:21,380
Pull this tank back.
Head it west towards the River Meuse.

453
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:24,460
I'm warning you, lieutenant,
stay off my tank.

454
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,560
Either put up that gun or fire it,
sergeant.

455
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,346
It's okay, sarge. It's okay.

456
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:21,607
General, another panzer column
has been spotted four miles...

457
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:24,778
...from the River Meuse.
- Where did they come from?

458
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:28,047
Get me the officer in charge
of the fuel depot.

459
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:30,557
Get Silver Cloud 201. Quickly.

460
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:33,161
It's not a new column.

461
00:46:34,465 --> 00:46:35,989
It's Hessler.

462
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:40,228
- He slipped away from the battle.
- The fuel depot, sir.

463
00:46:40,404 --> 00:46:44,135
General Grey speaking.
I'm giving you this order personally.

464
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:47,505
Destroy the fuel depot at once.
I repeat.

465
00:46:47,712 --> 00:46:49,907
<i>Destroy the fuel depot at once. </i>

466
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:55,417
Yes, sir. I'll destroy the depot
immediately, sir. Set it on fire.

467
00:46:55,586 --> 00:47:00,523
No, sir, not a drop. I'll make sure
of that, sir. They won't get a drop.

468
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:07,557
All right, let's get these bodies
out of here. Let's go. Move!

469
00:47:25,116 --> 00:47:28,882
Elke and Eisner report fuel
exhausted, sir.

470
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,044
What's Hessler's present position?

471
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:34,623
He reports being three kilometers
from the American fuel depot.

472
00:47:34,825 --> 00:47:37,123
We must get there.

473
00:47:37,328 --> 00:47:41,822
He will do it. Hessler will do it.

474
00:47:54,578 --> 00:47:57,479
No shooting. I'll do the talking.

475
00:47:57,648 --> 00:47:59,115
Get back to your post.

476
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:06,919
- Hold it up there, sergeant.
- Stop it.

477
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:11,451
- What can I do for you boys?
- We just made it. Could you fill her up?

478
00:48:11,629 --> 00:48:15,622
Sure. Give you a hand, soldier. Sure.

479
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:18,333
Corporal, bring some of those
cans over here.

480
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:20,231
A couple of you boys help out.

481
00:48:20,604 --> 00:48:25,064
Sergeant, we'll have you gassed up
and on your way in no time.

482
00:48:25,242 --> 00:48:27,506
Get on your machine gun.

483
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:30,476
- Hey, lieutenant.
- Yeah?

484
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:36,079
Weren't you directing traffic
at the Our River Bridge?

485
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:39,688
Does the road to Amblève
still lead to Malmedy?

486
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:00,104
Stop.

487
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:11,114
This fuel dump must be taken intact.

488
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:16,993
No shooting.

489
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,475
- Look. Let's get out of here.
- Hold it. They'll capture the gas.

490
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,982
We can't just leave it.

491
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:48,218
- What are you waiting for? Let's go.
- Hold it! They're after the gas.

492
00:49:50,027 --> 00:49:53,554
- We ought to blow it up.
- We can't set a match to all that.

493
00:49:53,731 --> 00:49:58,168
- We got no orders, lieutenant.
- Yeah? Well, I'm giving the orders.

494
00:49:58,602 --> 00:50:01,765
Hey, lieutenant,
one of them is still alive.

495
00:50:04,775 --> 00:50:07,608
Hold it! Hold it! He's one of ours.

496
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:11,606
- I got you, colonel.
- Burn it.

497
00:50:11,782 --> 00:50:14,216
- Take it easy. I know what to do.
- Burn it.

498
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:17,286
- Give him a hand, if you can.
- Burn it.

499
00:50:17,488 --> 00:50:21,618
Come on, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!

500
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:25,521
Get those barrels off the end
of that ramp. Hold your fire, Guffy.

501
00:50:25,696 --> 00:50:29,029
Move your tank behind that pile
until I tell you to shove.

502
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,068
You, get me some hand grenades
off the tank. Come on.

503
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:39,509
Come on.

504
00:50:40,878 --> 00:50:43,745
You, get to that gas truck
and open all the valves.

505
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:47,247
Then get the hell away from it.

506
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:12,841
All right, roll them down.

507
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:16,910
Get off the road.

508
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:19,409
Give me a hand grenade.

509
00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:15,967
He's getting away.

510
00:52:21,912 --> 00:52:24,403
Okay, shove.

511
00:52:33,223 --> 00:52:37,353
Don't stop! Keep going! Don't stop!

512
00:54:12,523 --> 00:54:14,354
Get this message to headquarters:

513
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:19,428
They've abandoned their tanks,
and they're walking back to Germany.

514
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:32,229
