1
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,515
December, 1944.

2
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,686
British and American armies
were on the threshold of victory.

3
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,023
Stretched across half of Europe,
the Allies gathered themselves...

4
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,026
...for the final assault on Germany.

5
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,612
To the north
stood Montgomery's Eighth Army...

6
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,281
...to the south, Patton's Third.

7
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,117
In the center, along an 88-mile front...

8
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:14,539
...a few battle-weary American divisions
rested in a quiet sector.

9
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,794
To them, the war seemed already won.

10
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,797
This is their story.

11
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,049
We've been flying over these woods
all week.

12
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,259
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.

13
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,055
- Getting hungry, Joe?
- The war is over.

14
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,600
I hear GHQ is cutting orders
to ship us home for Christmas.

15
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,728
The German army still has
6 million men carrying arms.

16
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,773
I haven't heard they're going home
for Christmas.

17
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,319
Hey, there it is...

18
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,280
...the German army.

19
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,742
Let's go down and have a look.

20
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,501
- Buzz him again. I wanna get a picture.
- Okay.

21
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,692
This time, gun your engine.
Make him look up.

22
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,215
It worked.

23
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,842
Swing around.
I wanna get another one.

24
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,883
Conrad.

25
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,053
I am ashamed of you.

26
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,930
Get up.

27
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,937
They could have killed us, sir.

28
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,940
If you'd taken the pains
to have looked carefully...

29
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,902
...you would have observed it was
an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

30
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,282
You would stay in the car if it were
a fighter plane shooting at us.

31
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,160
I did not lose a war to die
in the back seat of a car.

32
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,415
Does the colonel think any of us
has a choice where we will die?

33
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,169
I know where you'll die, Conrad,
at home, in your own bed.

34
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,423
Is the colonel trying to get rid of me?

35
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:57,137
I think that the world is going
to get rid of both of us.

36
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,682
Pick up your cap! Put it on.

37
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,435
Try to look like a soldier!

38
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,646
What good is a soldier anyhow?

39
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,024
He wins, he loses.

40
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,693
What's he good for anyhow?

41
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,529
Conrad, I've told you before...

42
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,657
...never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.

43
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,453
It won't happen again.

45
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:41,473
Looks like something on the ground
at 10 o'clock. Let's take a look.

46
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,317
Nothing.

47
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,486
Let's go home.

48
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,631
Herr Oberst Hessler is here.

49
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,845
- Colonel Hessler, sir.
- Yes.

50
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,183
Well, Hessler.

51
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,643
It has been a long time.

52
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,146
How good it is to see you again.

53
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,523
You look the same.

54
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,858
Little...

55
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,359
Little leaner perhaps.

56
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,448
The Russian front does not put meat
on a man's bones, general.

57
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,368
Ah, yes. War is hard on all of us.

58
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,663
- Central heating.
- Yeah.

59
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,374
Crystal chandeliers.

60
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,627
You have a nice cellar.

61
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,505
Field Marshal Goring
gave me that painting.

62
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,882
Lovely, isn't it?

63
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,098
I imagine he found a bargain
in Paris last year.

64
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,060
My corporal's waiting.
He's had a hard drive.

65
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,231
Do you suppose there's somewhere
in these ruins he can find a bed?

66
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,900
Sit down, Hessler.

67
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:45,073
You have too little faith
in the genius of the German people.

68
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,701
A few stones
have been knocked down...

69
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,914
...but our country's strong,
united, determined...

70
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,208
...and more productive than ever.

71
00:13:55,376 --> 00:14:00,755
The Allies think that their constant
air raids have undermined our morale.

72
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,175
- This they'll never do.
- Why have you sent for me, general?

73
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,181
You are our finest
panzer commander, Hessler.

74
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,058
You will lead us to victory.

75
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,727
Our Germany is now like an iceberg.

76
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,232
Only a fraction of it
can be seen on the surface.

77
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,111
Let me show you some of the results...

78
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,656
...of what Germany
has produced underground.

79
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,909
You will discover a new Germany...

80
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,746
...and will take a new pride
in being a German.

81
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,291
Our latest airplane.

82
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,917
A jet.

83
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,087
It flies at more than 900 kilometers
per hour.

84
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,465
Within six months,
we will have enough jet fighters...

85
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,136
...to shoot down every
Allied plane in the air.

86
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,640
Our V-1 rocket destroyed
20 percent of London.

87
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:57,228
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

88
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,817
The new 70-ton King Tiger tank.

89
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,322
It has two-and-a-half times
the firepower...

90
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,743
...and double the armor
of the American tanks.

91
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,830
Our Germany is far
from finished, Hessler.

92
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:21,002
It's a very beautiful model, general.

93
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,424
It proves that the Germans
are still the world's best toy makers.

94
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:32,347
The toys we are making these days
are not for children.

95
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,850
Let me show them to you.

96
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,290
Hands up! Get on over.

97
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,544
Hold it! Put them up! Stand against
the wall. Put them up, general.

98
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,005
Well, boys...

99
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,883
...looks like we've caught ourselves
a couple of big fish.

100
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,513
- One nice, fat Kraut trout.
- That's enough, now.

101
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,186
Sorry, general.
We are just rehearsing a commando raid.

102
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,813
Very good.

103
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,524
Not bad, Hessler, huh?

104
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,985
Had you fooled, didn't they?

105
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,028
Completely.

106
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,240
Unfortunately,
I am beyond playing games.

107
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,701
Oh, this is no game.

108
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,996
These are German soldiers, all of them.

109
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,915
Trained German soldiers.

110
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:46,254
Diepel commands the panzer grenadiers
attached to the 1st Tank Brigade.

111
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,674
These men will work with him.

112
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,011
Major Diepel, kindly explain
Operation Transit to the colonel.

113
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,931
The soldiers will be parachuted
behind the American lines.

114
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,060
Their mission:
To disrupt enemy communications.

115
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,855
We have organized many such teams.

116
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:09,193
Each will be led by a man who has
actually lived in America.

117
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,447
Schumacher here lived
in Texas for 12 years...

118
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,241
...before returning to the fatherland.

119
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,245
Tell me, lieutenant,
who is your favorite baseball player?

120
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,789
- Lou Gehrig.
- Because he's hit the most home runs?

121
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:26,252
No, sir. Babe Ruth hit
the most home runs, 60 in 1927.

122
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,255
And what's your opinion
of Adolf Hitler?

123
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,136
As an American, my opinion
would be offensive to these gentlemen.

124
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:39,807
Come, lieutenant. As an American officer,
you care nothing for German opinion.

125
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,397
Adolf Hitler is a crazy,
Austrian housepainter.

126
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,985
He's a madman who thinks he knows
more than the whole general's staff.

127
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,322
And he's leading Germany
to complete, total destruction.

128
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,076
Perhaps you are going too far.

129
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,456
To carry off this great deception,
even their reflexes must be American.

130
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,087
Your reflexes are to be congratulated,
lieutenant.

131
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,885
Insolent man.

132
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,805
Let him have his fun now.

133
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,808
If he is captured,
he will be shot as a spy.

134
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,269
And if he survives,
he can be shot as a traitor.

135
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:32,110
You must admit, we are very thorough.

136
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,328
Even a pass won't get you through here.

137
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,538
We will attack
through the Losheim Gap.

138
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,999
It's defended only by a single battalion.

139
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,712
The American division
on the Schnee Eifel will be cut off.

140
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,590
Then the Our River Bridge
will be in our hands.

141
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,094
From there, on to Ambleve,
with its road network.

142
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:44,765
In four days, we will be across
the River Meuse.

143
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,560
The strategic objective?

144
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,270
Antwerp.

145
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,066
By taking Antwerp, we split
the enemy forces in two.

146
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,112
It will take them 18 months to recover.

147
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,783
By then, we will have air superiority
with our jet engines.

148
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,287
And we will have even more
significant weapons.

149
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,291
Weapons which can destroy
an entire city with a single blast.

150
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,420
You have forgotten
one important detail, general.

151
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,633
With their present control of the air,
the Allies will smash our tanks...

152
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,469
...machine-gun our troops,
bomb the bridges...

153
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,388
...and cut our communications.

154
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:29,435
Suppose I tell you there will be
no Allied planes.

155
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,147
Another secret weapon?

156
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,150
From Spitzbergen, Norway...

157
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,278
...the northernmost weather station
in the world.

158
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,615
We have been waiting two months
for this report.

159
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,119
"A low-pressure area over northern
Europe, starting December 16th.

160
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,165
Low clouds and fog
which will ground all aircraft."

161
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,794
- How long?
- Long enough...

162
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,421
...if we keep strictly to our timetable.

163
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,842
Unusual clock, isn't it?

164
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,512
It has only one cycle.

165
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,055
Fifty hours.

166
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,352
We have the resources
for 50 hours, full-scale attack.

167
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,358
Maps, clocks, toys.

168
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,695
But with what will I fight?

169
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,614
Colonel Hessler...

170
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,034
...I'm putting you in command
of our armored spearhead.

171
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,202
It can be done.

172
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,402
This came in from SHAEF.

173
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,780
I got a Christmas cake
from home today.

174
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,116
- Think I'll still be here to eat it?
- Send this right through.

175
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,119
Develop this. Bring me the prints
as soon as they come out.

176
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,788
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Kiley.

177
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,457
Find any Germans under
your bed this morning?

178
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,795
Marching around under there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.

179
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,963
That's an order.

180
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:08,135
I want every item on that menu delivered
to every soldier in the division...

181
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,805
...especially those
in the forward positions.

182
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,308
And I want them delivered
in time for Christmas dinner.

183
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,813
Counterintelligence picked
this up from an enemy agent.

184
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,940
Dated November 29th.

185
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,151
"From Field Marshal Keitel. Most secret.

186
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,489
Officers and men who speak English
are wanted for special mission.

187
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,451
Volunteers will report
to General Kohler's headquarters."

188
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,329
- What do you make of it?
- You know my opinion.

189
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,124
This is one more confirmation.
They're going to attack.

190
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,709
Oh, come on, Kiley, not that again.

191
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,339
They're probably preparing a fifth column
to drop behind our lines.

192
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,175
Were you
in the State Department too, Kiley?

193
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,345
I thought your experience
was limited to police work.

194
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:57,101
Having been an inspector of police
doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

195
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,103
All cops aren't flatfoots.

196
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,188
Your limited military experience...

197
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,859
...doesn't inspire confidence
in your conclusions. If you think...

198
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,987
Why do you keep saying
they're mounting an offensive?

199
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,033
I spent 20 years before the war
asking questions.

200
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,036
Ever since D-day,
you've had me doing the same thing...

201
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,539
...interrogating prisoners.

202
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,833
I can only report what I've learned.

203
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:25,045
The German soldier facing us
is still an undefeated enemy.

204
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,339
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.

205
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,550
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

206
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,345
I have 10 other officers in my section.

207
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,808
We see the same information,
get the same facts as you, Kiley.

208
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:42,062
All of us come up with one answer, you
come up with the complete opposite.

209
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,065
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
you'd better lie down.

210
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,693
Colonel Pritchard,
you may be my superior officer...

211
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,737
He is.

212
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,823
Excuse me.
Here are the prints you wanted.

213
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,408
Thank you.

214
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,414
Look what showed up on this one.

215
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,083
I took it over the Ardennes.

216
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,798
Is this a Tiger tank, or isn't it?

217
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,885
So it appears.

218
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,179
One tiger doesn't make a jungle, sir.

219
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,600
I expect tigers in jungles. When I discover
one in a peaceful neighborhood...

220
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,103
...I recommend all of us
take a good look under our beds.

221
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,064
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,867
Step outside.

223
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,968
With your permission, sir.

224
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,265
This is from headquarters, Kiley.
Top-secret.

225
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,644
The Third Army has been ordered
to attack the Germans in the Saar.

226
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,106
General Patton is launching
the offensive in two days.

227
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,774
Does it seem possible...

228
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,570
...headquarters would commit an entire
army to an offensive in the south...

229
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,490
...if there were any possibility of the
Germans attacking in the Ardennes?

230
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,621
With all due respect to headquarters,
they could be wrong.

231
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,833
Send this to headquarters anyway.

232
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,168
There seem to be new features
on that tank.

233
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,670
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

234
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,590
Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown
on this German officer.

235
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,636
- All right, send this along.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,182
Get up to the line and tell them
to grab some new prisoners.

237
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,519
- I'm interested in any fresh information.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,148
One thing more. What are
you doing in a reconnaissance plane?

239
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,151
We're not paying you
to be a combat soldier.

240
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,362
- Trying to shorten the war by yourself?
- No, sir.

241
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,534
Just wanna make sure I can enjoy
that nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

242
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,882
I see the colonel's
in fine appetite again.

243
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,717
I am.

244
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,553
Join me in a glass of wine.

245
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,513
Thank you, sir.

246
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,392
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

247
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,238
Conrad.

248
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,575
Speak.

249
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,245
What does the colonel wish me to say?

250
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,581
Speak your mind, the truth.

251
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:53,045
Don't be afraid, Conrad. I must have
someone to tell me the truth.

252
00:27:56,466 --> 00:28:02,096
I've always been fortunate
to serve under brilliant men...

253
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,598
...who know everything.

254
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,726
From them, I've learned one thing:

255
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:13,232
When all was lost,
these brilliant men never lost hope.

256
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,068
I admire that.

257
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,864
What else do you admire
about these men?

258
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,117
The illusion.

259
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:28,622
Maybe I'm not using
the right word, colonel.

260
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,375
I'm not an educated man.

261
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,629
The hope that there is
always one more chance.

262
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,007
That is the illusion.

263
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,012
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

264
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,267
It's not my place
to speak of such things.

265
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,811
Go on.

266
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,149
I order you to.

267
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,735
Colonel...

268
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,074
...this new command is an illusion.

269
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,660
Give it up.

270
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,166
I am Martin Hessler.

271
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,669
Four years ago,
my panzers overran Poland in one week.

272
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,005
That was no illusion.

273
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:22,009
In 39 days, my tanks smashed all
the way to Paris. That was no illusion.

274
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,179
I conquered the Crimea.
That was no illusion.

275
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,016
Today...

276
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,603
...I was given a brigade of Tiger tanks.

277
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,647
When I have a brigade of tanks...

278
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,357
...that is reality.

279
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,820
And who will drive your tanks?

280
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,948
The men you led were soldiers.
Veteran soldiers.

281
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,950
Are there any left?

282
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,036
What will they give you now?

283
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,538
I was by your side
in Poland, France, Crimea.

284
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,707
Look at me, colonel,
I'm not the same man.

285
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,878
I jumped in a ditch today at the sight
of an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

286
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,631
My two boys remember me
as a good soldier.

287
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,508
They wouldn't believe it.

288
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,303
But, colonel, I am not the only one.

289
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:11,141
How sure can you be of the men
who will drive your tanks?

290
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,528
Major Diepel?

291
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,158
- Diepel.
- Yep.

292
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,704
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assembled at once.

293
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,125
Conrad, my boots.

294
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,143
Your commanders, sir.

295
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,703
Boys. Too many boys.

296
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,456
The first battle will turn them into men.

297
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,959
In the old days,
I lived six months with my men...

298
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:23,255
...before going into action. I knew them,
they knew me. These are strangers.

299
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,923
Too many boys.

300
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,884
They have never tasted defeat.

301
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,803
Do they know what is expected of them?

302
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,140
They are ready to die for you.

303
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,893
Can you ask more?

304
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,087
Sing.

305
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,931
Louder.

306
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,853
Hold it. Hold it.

307
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,316
Pull up. We got brass on our tail.
Take it...

308
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,443
Pull it forward, you idiot!

309
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,696
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!

310
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,537
Just a little bit. Hold it.

311
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,372
Hold it! Hold it!

312
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,541
You're dropping my merchandise!

313
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,876
Barrel and Eddie,
come on out of there.

314
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,212
Come on, Cortland.

315
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,967
Disaster.

316
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,763
Solid. Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

317
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,599
- Complain to my union.
- Yeah, go ahead, tie it up.

318
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,935
- We near enemy territory yet?
- Too near.

319
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,104
- Give me a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

320
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,356
Sarge, when will we see
some Germans?

321
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,941
- Barrel?
- Smoke your own.

322
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,442
Got a cigarette, Eddie?

323
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,903
- You kidding?
- You cheapskates.

324
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,739
Reach into my bag,
get me a carton of cigarettes.

325
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,741
What's with you and the Germans?

326
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,035
Nothing. I just ain't never seen one.

327
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,705
You know, I've never
even seen a German plane.

328
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,374
Sarge, when are we
gonna get in the action?

329
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,085
What are you, some kind of a nut?

330
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,796
What kind of replacements
they sending us, huh?

331
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,757
"I wanna see action."

332
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,594
- What's this?
- Put that back. That's merchandise.

333
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,263
Don't tell me there's women
where we're going.

334
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,100
- Who are you gonna give these to?
- Guffy don't give nothing.

335
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,936
- He's peddling them.
- You keep tying it up.

336
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,647
- Peddling them? To who?
- The boys in the front.

337
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,735
They're gonna need that in Germany.
There's lots of broads there.

338
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,614
- French perfume.
- Champagne.

339
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:44,117
That's gonna bring me 30 bills a bottle
where we're going.

340
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,746
Because there's nothing,
nothing too good for our boys.

341
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,916
- Yeah. What's in here?
- That's the mail.

342
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,169
Are you gonna charge them
something for that too?

343
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,008
- No, they wouldn't sit still for that.
- Just kidding, sarge. Just kidding.

344
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,928
No. When you get these thoughts,
tell me anyway...

345
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,473
...because one thing I'm not
going back home again is poor.

346
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,975
Keep thinking, kid. Very nice.

347
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,165
Germans?

348
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,382
This is the up-front front.

349
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,061
Wide awake bunch of boys.

350
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:57,524
- Don't you people ever post a sentry?
- I'm sorry, sir. I came in for a second.

351
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,068
What's the matter?
Close the pneumonia hole.

352
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,862
- What were you born in, a barn?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

353
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,031
We didn't know it was you.

354
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,536
- Major Wolenski?
- He's over there, sir.

355
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:18,336
Hello, colonel. I wasn't expecting a visit
or I'd have had my men smarten up.

356
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,672
How are you?
Hot coffee for the colonel.

357
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,841
Come over and get warm.

358
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,552
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

359
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,390
That radio's been yakking between
Christmas carols we're all going home.

360
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,392
Here, sit down.

361
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,895
It's tough keeping discipline
when the only action...

362
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,231
...is sitting on your butt
to keep warm.

363
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,899
What are the Germans doing?

364
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,736
Same damn thing,
except they don't have any heat.

365
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,238
They gotta exercise
to keep from freezing.

366
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,575
Well, I got a little exercise
for your boys.

367
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,870
I wanna patrol tonight,
try to pick up some prisoners.

368
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,458
Well, there they are.

369
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,136
- Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.
- Come on, shut the window.

370
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,305
What do you wanna
do that for, sarge?

371
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,975
They're out of range. They'll
shoot back with something heavier.

372
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,313
It's you or them, dogface.
I need practice.

373
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,232
That's enough, sergeant.

374
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,611
If you wanna play with that popgun,
you can go outside.

375
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,824
What do you say I take the men out
for a field drill, lieutenant?

376
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,621
In this weather? What for?

377
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,832
Because they're drilling, that's why.

378
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,461
I'll let you know
when I want a drill, sergeant.

379
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,589
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

380
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,136
I'll take that sergeant.

381
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:54,516
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.

382
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,435
Here you are, colonel.

383
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,148
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?

384
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,150
Just sweeten it.

385
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,185
You are Colonel Hessler?

386
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,854
Who are you?

387
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,523
How did you get in here?

388
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,069
General Kohler's signature is magic.

389
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,196
You will excuse us, major.

390
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,199
Before you give orders,
may I ask your rank?

391
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,869
Courtesan, first class.

392
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,580
Compliments of General Kohler.

393
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,417
I think we have covered
everything, colonel.

394
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:11,551
General Kohler did not tell me
you were so handsome.

395
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,221
What did General Kohler
tell you about me?

396
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,432
Nothing.

397
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,436
Whatever I want to know...

398
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,523
...I'll find out for myself.

399
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,234
I'm very good at that.

400
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,867
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

401
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:42,248
Or have you been at the front so long
you have forgotten your manners?

402
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,091
What shall we talk about?

403
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,719
Your wife perhaps.

404
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,726
Won't you join me?

405
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,735
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

406
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,404
You are not paying
much attention to me.

407
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,741
Very little has escaped my attention.

408
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:21,162
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

409
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:27,961
What he admires most about you
is your reputation with the ladies.

410
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:34,801
I regret that is the opinion
of my commanding officer.

411
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,975
I have worked very hard
to achieve a reputation as a soldier.

412
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,602
Do not the two go together?

413
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,814
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him, "Thank you.

414
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,984
I appreciate his gesture."
And good night.

415
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,320
You can make your own way out.

416
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,303
Zero minus two hours.

417
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,305
All units ready to attack.

418
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:26,436
Repeat. Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.

419
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,033
- Come on.
- Put them down, dummkopf.

420
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,497
Hello, Kiley.

421
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:50,543
I was curious to see how
you interrogate your prisoners.

422
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,380
My other officers may be
asking the wrong questions.

423
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,384
I'm afraid you won't
hear any new answers.

424
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:03,181
Sometimes it's more important
what you see than what they say.

425
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,235
Could we get
a little more light in here?

426
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,404
How's that, sir?

427
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,587
So this is the face
of the undefeated enemy.

428
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,757
It looks like you've captured
a Sunday school class.

429
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:41,928
This all they have left to put in
the front lines? Where are the weapons?

430
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,930
Here, sir.

431
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,893
What's this?

432
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,483
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.

433
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,735
- Did they put up any fight?
- No, sir.

434
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,821
Just gave up.

435
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,658
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.

436
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,785
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

437
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,747
They're not even tough enough
to be classified as delinquents.

438
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,459
Go ahead and question them.
Ask if Germany's gonna win the war.

439
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,586
Go ahead, Kiley.

440
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:20,133
They could be plants put
in the front lines to mislead us.

441
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,928
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

442
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,348
Escort these prisoners to the rear
for proper interrogation.

443
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,308
Yes, sir. Move them out.

444
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,103
- Let's go, move it out.
- Go!

445
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,690
These prisoners
were carrying these rubber hoses.

446
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,192
Send them along,
and anything else you found.

447
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,570
Yes, sir.

448
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:47,577
Do you actually still think the Germans
are preparing a major offensive?

449
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,163
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

450
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,000
You mean those kids are replacements
for more seasoned troops...

451
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,211
...sent to the rear
to re-form for the big attack?

452
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,630
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

453
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,510
Kiley, you're crazy. Facts mean nothing
to you. Evidence means nothing.

454
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:08,181
The only thing you can see
are your own cockeyed hunches.

455
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,892
Well, that doesn't work in the Army.

456
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:15,188
I'm recommending you for transfer
to a desk in Washington.

457
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,819
You can tell the president
how to run the war.

458
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,329
Major.

459
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,720
You make coffee as bad as my wife.

460
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,767
She always told me
I'd never get along in the Army.

461
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:58,523
I never had it so easy
in the police force.

462
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,404
I've just been counting up
how many times I've been wrong.

463
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,199
But never this wrong.

464
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,078
All the signs point
to only one thing.

465
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,873
Is it possible they mean
something else?

466
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:22,255
Maybe this war is beyond me
and maybe Colonel Pritchard's right.

467
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,258
Runner brought this from headquarters.
It's for you.

468
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,801
Open it.

469
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:37,311
Well, it's a picture of a Kraut colonel
and his service record.

470
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,939
I wanted that.

471
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:49,282
Well, there it is again. Panzer officer.
Fine fighting record.

472
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,785
Last reported in the Russian front
commanding a tank regiment.

473
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,745
What's he doing here?

474
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,290
I'd say that proves my point.

475
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:03,421
Colonel Pritchard would probably say
he got fired for losing the war in Russia.

476
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:08,134
I don't know. What do you think?

477
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:14,473
Well, sir. I'm regular Army.
I don't get into beefs between colonels.

478
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,520
But I'll tell you what some
of my stir-crazy men think.

479
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,940
They think we got
a great opportunity here.

480
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,277
We got a chance
to wipe out Germany.

481
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:30,531
Just wipe it clean off the map.
Knock everything down...

482
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,116
...every city...

483
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,828
...every castle, all the bridges,
all the roads. Everything.

484
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:40,833
Don't leave two stones standing
together. Just wipe the slate clean.

485
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,337
Turn Germany into a prairie,
then ship over a few buffalo...

486
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,505
...and let them start from scratch.

487
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,383
Now, what do you think
of that, colonel?

488
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:59,185
I think your men ought to wash their
socks and take a shave. It stinks in here.

489
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,892
- Speak English. Only English.
- Okay, lieutenant.

490
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,937
Let's get this stuff out of here.

491
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,291
Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

492
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:09,588
Repeat. Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

493
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,431
What the...?

494
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,725
What's that noise?

495
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,727
On your feet! Everybody out!

496
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,940
- Sounds like a thousand of them.
- Hey, Charlie, get battalion.

497
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,734
- Get battalion.
- On the double! On the double!

498
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,572
Sergeant, haul everybody out.

499
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,200
- Everybody out. Come on.
- Bazooka men, report to me.

500
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,746
The line's dead, sir.

501
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,750
Go! Go! Go!

502
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,765
What's that?

503
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,269
"What's that?" And you wanted
to see Germans, right?

504
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,272
Come on! On the double!

505
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,275
On the double!

506
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,323
Turn them over! Turn them over!
Let's go! Let's go!

507
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,117
Come on,
let's get this baby moving.

508
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:30,247
Colonel Hessler reports
panzer Tiger moving to the attack.

509
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,916
No enemy activity.

510
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:36,128
Northern front reporting
panzer Eisen entering Losheim Gap.

511
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,255
No enemy opposition encountered.

512
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,659
Southern front reporting.

513
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:11,789
All elements of panzer Eisen
linking up at road junction 0-2.

514
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,243
Stay on my tail.

515
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,583
Soldier.

516
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,711
Did they give you basic training?

517
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,672
Here, you do it this way.

518
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,887
They're green, never seen action before.
What do you expect?

519
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,608
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.
Nobody moves without orders.

520
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,402
Yes, sir.

521
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,407
Stay here. One more man
won't make a difference.

522
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:32,578
- I need to look inside one of those Tigers.
- All right, come on.

523
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:30,344
Relay to Standard O-bay.
I've made contact with enemy.

524
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,471
Meeting weak resistance.

525
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:37,142
Take cover! Make a stand.
Take cover! Make a stand.

526
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,520
Make a stand.

527
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,456
Load.

528
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,000
I said, load!

529
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:23,355
Tiger to Tank 104.
Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

530
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,191
Get off the road at once!

531
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,280
There's your Tiger.

532
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,496
Wait a minute.

533
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,206
You're gonna need this.

534
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,417
Take the greaser.

535
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,923
Tiger to Tank 104,
what is your condition?

536
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,593
Tank 104, reply at once.

537
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,970
This is Colonel Hessler.

538
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,353
Button up!

539
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,647
Tigers at 11 o'clock.

540
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,281
Hit them hard, Eddie.

541
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,511
They got Blondie.

542
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,604
Forget it. It's like hitting them
with tennis balls.

543
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,612
Come on, let's get out of here!

544
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,492
Get down and stay down.

545
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,296
Crawl, you dummy! Crawl.

546
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,219
Lieutenant,
keep those grenades coming.

547
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:27,372
Fall back!

548
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,458
Get down.

549
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,229
Get going. Stay low.

550
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,100
Hessler to headquarters.

551
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,062
Resistance very weak.

552
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,399
Southern front reporting.

553
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,443
Commander Nimke
encountering light resistance.

554
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,238
Enemy retreating across river K-10.

555
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,843
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, somebody man this gun!

556
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,679
- Here they come!
- There they are!

557
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,992
Give me a belt!

558
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,848
Hey, wait for me!

559
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,896
Grab the tailgate!

560
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,942
Wait for me!

561
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,867
- Where's your motor pool?
- At regiment, four kilometers.

562
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,787
Let's get there.
I gotta get back to headquarters.

563
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,289
- Wait for me!
- Hold it a minute!

564
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,041
Wait for me!

565
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,751
We haven't got a chance.

566
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,629
Relax. Stay loose.

567
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,633
You think we'll have to surrender?

568
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,512
Well, I hear they treat
American prisoners real well.

569
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,724
In a big battle,
they treat nobody real well.

570
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,519
Come on. There's a back road
that leads to the motor pool.

571
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:03,148
- Maybe we can get us a jeep.
- How do you know?

572
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:06,151
Because I studied the maps
when we arrived here.

573
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,862
Just like you should've done.

574
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,536
- What if we run into their lines?
- We're still ahead of them.

575
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,665
- They might have advanced patrols.
- It's enough trouble keeping alive...

576
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,001
...in this mess
without you bellyaching.

577
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,504
If you wanna surrender, go ahead.
I'll make it easier alone.

578
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,049
You're out of line, sergeant.

579
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,177
Sorry, lieutenant.

580
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:36,681
Look, I don't need help from you.
You wanna go on by yourself, go ahead.

581
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,647
Are you coming,
or am I gonna have to carry you?

582
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,709
Hello, Cheyenne.

583
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,711
What's that? You're under attack?

584
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,588
In what strength?

585
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,590
Well, what's your guess?

586
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,510
I can't give you air reconnaissance,
I'm blind.

587
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,679
- Get Apache.
- Call Apache.

588
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,223
Eddie, what's going on
in your sector?

589
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,725
It's only patrol action.
How heavy?

590
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:24,062
Well, what does your
reconnaissance say? Nothing heavy.

591
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,856
We're trying to get a picture.
Stay on task.

592
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,761
The first phase of our offensive
was a success.

593
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,264
The element of surprise
was complete.

594
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,267
American communications
are in a turmoil.

595
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,437
We must cross the Our River
before the enemy realizes...

596
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,481
...we have launched
an all-out offensive.

597
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:14,154
I do not believe I gave you permission
to smoke.

598
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,156
Sorry, sir.

599
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:21,286
Unfortunately, we did not have time
to get better acquainted...

600
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,789
...but all of you know my reputation.

601
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:29,878
My command always suffers
the highest casualties.

602
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:34,299
The price of victory is never cheap.

603
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:38,636
In this battle, we will be
as hard as our tanks.

604
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:42,265
I will reach the objectives
assigned to me...

605
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,267
...no matter what the cost.

606
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,812
Signal from headquarters, colonel.

607
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:52,358
Hessler, I congratulate you.

608
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:55,820
- You're on schedule.
- I will reach the Our River as planned.

609
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,157
But the enemy must not be permitted
to destroy the bridge.

610
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,118
- Has Schumacher seized it yet?
- Not yet.

611
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:06,331
Schumacher's primary assignment
is to disrupt enemy communications.

612
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,209
I must have that bridge secured
for my tanks.

613
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,336
I have no time to build bridges.

614
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:17,842
Hessler, your bridge will be secured.

615
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,554
We are expecting you to cross it
according to the schedule.

616
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:28,019
You know your line of march.
Coordinate with the map.

617
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:36,528
Conrad, I have a headache.

618
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,587
Fire! Fire!

619
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,606
Land mines!
Why were they not cleared?

620
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,900
Where are the men
with mine detectors?

621
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,569
We are moving too fast.

622
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,737
The men are following in trucks.

623
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,406
They are all dead.

624
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,492
The mine exploded
directly under them.

625
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,412
Notify their seconds-in-command
to take over.

626
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,123
Tell them I have absolute
confidence in them.

627
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,584
We have lost a tank unnecessarily.

628
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:35,086
We've lost precious minutes
unnecessarily.

629
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,714
Your troops were here
to protect the panzers.

630
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,258
From now on,
until we clear this minefield...

631
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,595
...your men will go ahead of my tanks.

632
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,891
And have my vehicle repaired at once!

633
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,615
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

634
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:13,625
Now, listen to me, all of you.

635
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:16,461
I need precise information:

636
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,172
How many men, how many guns...

637
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,133
...how many tanks
the enemy are throwing into this.

638
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:25,178
How much fuel are they carrying?
And get a move on.

639
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:29,098
We've got 24 hours
before we scream rape.

640
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,852
All right, Kiley, it's your turn.

641
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,438
They're pouring through, general.

642
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,649
Crack troops. Brand-new equipment.

643
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:41,694
I looked inside one of their tanks.
They can chew up anything we've got.

644
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:45,698
- Question is, where are they going?
- Do you have that information?

645
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,784
No, but he does. Colonel Hessler...

646
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,495
...the commanding officer
of the panzer spearhead.

647
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,455
When we know where he's going...

648
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,124
...we'll know the objective
of the attack.

649
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:58,836
The enemy is probing at five points
along an 85-mile front.

650
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,506
With only that information
at our disposal...

651
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:05,009
...how can you assume Hessler's column
is the spearhead?

652
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,345
- The law of probability, Kiley?
- No, sir.

653
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,514
The law of probability is against me.

654
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:14,018
But in the absence of other information,
I've one chance in five of being right.

655
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:17,480
- I'd like to explore that chance.
- How?

656
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,482
- Well, sir...
- I'll tell you how.

657
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,984
Watch the Our River.

658
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,696
There's only one bridge, right here,
that can support heavy tanks.

659
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:28,658
I'd say that's where Hessler will be,
and that's where I'll be.

660
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:32,662
Don't get too close to that bridge.
I've ordered it blown up.

661
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,999
That's a good thing to know.
Thanks for the tip.

662
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:43,506
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Go on, keep moving.

663
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,884
Come on, let's go.
You there, keep moving.

664
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,012
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

665
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,857
Come on. Come on, let's go.

666
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,900
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

667
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:09,240
Move it. Come on, keep moving.
Step on it. Get going.

668
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,410
Come on, let's get going.
Step on it.

669
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,542
Hey, what are you stopping for?

670
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,211
That sign.
When we came through before...

671
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:26,424
...I recall Ambleve was that way.
- You're blocking the road. Get going.

672
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,426
- Hurry up.
- Come on, let's go.

673
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:32,263
Wait a minute. I tell you, those signs
point in the wrong direction.

674
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,474
What's holding up the parade here?

675
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,894
Somebody's been monkeying around
with those road signs.

676
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:40,229
That ain't the road to Ambleve.

677
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,232
Two hours ago,
I came here from Ambleve...

678
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,109
...over this exact same road.

679
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,112
Now, maybe they've moved Ambleve
in the meantime...

680
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,656
...but two hours ago
this was the road to it.

681
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,618
- Take off, Duquesne.
- Lieutenant, I'm telling you...

682
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,246
Lieutenant, tell your sergeant
to get this jeep out of here.

683
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,708
Move. That's an order. Move.

684
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,466
Yeah, I hope they enjoy themselves
in Malmedy.

685
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,806
- Come on. We're getting off here.
- Wait.

686
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,766
Come on!

687
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,310
Jump.

688
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:25,191
Hey, wait a minute. Where we going?

689
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,318
We're supposed to be in Ambleve.

690
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,029
We'll get there.
I gotta make a pickup first.

691
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,032
- Pickup?
- I got some merchandise in a farmhouse.

692
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,661
Germans are coming. They'll steal it.
You gotta give me a hand.

693
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,996
Hey, you two!

694
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,751
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

695
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:01,352
Are you the last one?
Anybody behind you?

696
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,689
Yeah, the whole German army.
Go ahead.

697
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,570
You there, keep them moving.
Come on, step on it.

698
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:18,911
Notify the panzers.
The bridge is intact.

699
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,763
- Any sign of the Germans?
- No, not yet.

700
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:41,434
- What are you men doing here?
- We got orders to blow the bridge.

701
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,352
- Pile out.
- Wait a minute.

702
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,688
That job's being done.

703
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,201
How you boys making out?

704
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:01,370
- Just about finished.
- Hurry up, will you?

705
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:03,956
Get out of here
before those Krauts get here.

706
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:06,542
- You need any help?
- I got a good idea.

707
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:12,256
We'll give them all a hot-water bottle.
That water comes straight off the ice.

708
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:15,092
Well, I'm sure loaded with C-4.
Can you use any?

709
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,970
I imagine they could sell you some.

710
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,098
Climb in.

711
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,108
Hey, why do you got your wires
hooked on to that detonator?

712
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:38,324
- I guess he's in a hurry.
- To get killed? That's not the way.

713
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,117
Sarge, bring a couple of men.

714
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:43,246
We're gonna take a look
under that bridge.

715
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:00,429
This ain't the road to Ambleve.

716
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:01,973
That's what the sign says.

717
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,476
The sign says thataway,
the map says Ambleve was this way.

718
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:08,312
Will somebody straighten this out?

719
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,484
Ambleve. Ambleve.

720
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,283
- Hey, Wolenski.
- Oh, colonel.

721
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,160
Hey, we're all fouled up here.

722
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:27,206
We've been ordered to Ambleve,
but the maps don't jibe with the signs.

723
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,626
How'd you get off the road?
This will take you to Malmedy.

724
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,837
- Ambleve's that way.
- That way?

725
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,840
We've been following these road signs
the whole way.

726
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:40,011
And the MPs we ran into,
they've been directing us this way.

727
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,515
They've been changed.
They switched them around.

728
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,684
Those MPs you ran into seem okay?

729
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:50,021
- What do you mean?
- Anything odd about them?

730
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:51,522
Just regular GIs.

731
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,691
We intercepted an enemy dispatch.

732
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,527
They were recruiting
English-speaking Germans.

733
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,405
What time did you cross the Our River?

734
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:02,867
8:40. We were last ones across.
They were set to blow it.

735
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:05,161
- You see the bridge blown?
- No.

736
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,039
But I saw the engineers
setting the charges.

737
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:14,378
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell?
They weren't engineers, they were MPs.

738
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:18,507
Murphy, get me headquarters.

739
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:21,719
And, major,
have someone switch that sign back.

740
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,680
Red River Six. Come in, Red River Six.

741
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:29,018
- Come in, Red River Two.
- Red River Six, this is Red River Two.

742
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:33,773
Germans uniformed as American MPs
holding Our River Bridge.

743
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,442
Bridge has not been blown.

744
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:40,029
Repeat. Germans uniformed
as American MPs...

745
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:44,283
...holding Our River Bridge.
Bridge has not been blown.

746
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,411
Over and out. Let's go.

747
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,262
Better hold it, Jack.

748
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:11,102
- What happened?
- They ran into a firefight.

749
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,062
German patrol.

750
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,772
I don't see any Germans.

751
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,275
They're in the river.
They didn't make it across.

752
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,653
Get out of here.
We're blowing the bridge.

753
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:24,156
What? Are you sure?

754
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,659
Watch out, the MPs are Krauts!

755
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,687
Oh, my God! Get down!

756
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:29,096
Why are we waiting?
Get that tank out of the way.

757
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,682
We are preparing
to tow it off now, sir.

758
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:37,021
Tiger to tanks Leopard and Panther.
Blast that tank off the bridge.

759
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:55,080
It's headquarters, colonel.

760
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:57,708
General Kohler says
we are behind schedule.

761
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,753
He wants to know
what's holding us up.

762
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:06,509
Tell the general the Americans
are learning how to retreat.

763
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:13,265
Tiger to Panther. Get onto the bridge,
push that junk right out of the way.

764
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,928
Stay down.

765
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:08,404
Murphy, call headquarters. Tell them
the Our River Bridge hasn't been blown.

766
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,615
- The enemy's crossing in great strength.
- Yes, sir.

767
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:26,630
- Let me have your rifle.
- What you need is a cannon, sir.

768
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:30,801
The last time I saw that German,
all I had was a camera.

769
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,473
Can't you hurry it up, sergeant?
We lost the column.

770
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:21,518
Do you happen to have a new carburetor
in your pocket, lieutenant?

771
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:24,688
You mean we're stuck here?

772
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,569
Nope. We can still walk.

773
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,324
Let's go.

774
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:40,788
- Hey, maybe we can get a lift, huh?
- Hold it.

775
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,835
We better find out
just who they are first.

776
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,218
Down.

777
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,434
Yeah, Krauts. Back.

778
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:44,768
If you'd just stayed loose,
I could've gotten them all.

779
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:08,917
Americans in headlong retreat.
Our forces are advancing on all fronts.

780
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,629
Great numbers of prisoners
are being taken.

781
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:15,567
I got a bad feeling about this.

782
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:18,821
If you wanted to make a run for it,
why didn't you?

783
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,366
I'm in your outfit, lieutenant.

784
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:26,453
My job is to look out for you,
go where you go.

785
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,836
I sure got you into the wrong place
this time.

786
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,880
But I'm glad you're with me.

787
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:43,554
When we get to the POW camp,
they'll separate us...

788
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:45,472
...you being an officer.

789
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,560
Yeah.

790
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:53,230
I'm gonna miss you, sergeant.

791
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,044
Run!

792
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:36,106
Keep going!

793
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,878
Get going. Come on, step on it.

794
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,563
- Is she here?
- No.

795
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,691
Well, tell her I'm back, huh?

796
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:14,997
I want you all to fan out. Round up
every man that belongs to this outfit.

797
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,874
We will assemble here in 10 minutes.
On the double.

798
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:19,334
Let's go.

799
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,098
What's all this?

800
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,559
What's it look like?
My place of business.

801
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:43,567
- What are the chickens for?
- They lay eggs.

802
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,236
Any idea what fresh eggs
brings in these days?

803
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,655
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

804
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,576
All right, open the door,
that's my partner.

805
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,419
Look, run down to the tank park
and check us both in.

806
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:05,255
- But...
- And then report back to me. Go ahead.

807
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,426
The chickens look scrawny.
Have you been feeding them regular?

808
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,094
I was worried about you.

809
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:14,264
- Is it true the Germans are coming?
- Right through here.

810
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:17,267
- We gotta sell everything, fast.
- Then you'll leave?

811
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:23,273
Face it, kid, we're out of business.
One case of champagne, $360.

812
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:29,154
Two dozen nylons, $80.
Twenty bottles of perfume, $200.

813
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:33,992
Six hundred and forty dollars.
Here's your half.

814
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:37,662
Three hundred and twenty dollars.
All right, what did you make?

815
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:41,291
One thousand, two hundred
and thirty dollars. Here.

816
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:48,340
What have you been selling?
I don't see much stock gone.

817
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:51,134
- Take it.
- I won't until I know how you made it.

818
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:54,012
- What do you think I am?
- What do you think I am?

819
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:59,351
- It's money I've saved for us.
- For us? What are you talking about?

820
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:04,731
When a woman goes in business
with a man, it means forever.

821
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:09,152
What's forever? The shop is closed.
The Germans are coming.

822
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,446
They've been here before.

823
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,490
I've lived through it.

824
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:16,326
I will live through it again.

825
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,167
I will wait for you.

826
01:30:28,464 --> 01:30:31,842
How can you feel this way about me?
I never laid a hand on you.

827
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,969
That's why.

828
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:36,346
You're in love with me.

829
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:43,019
Just a second. Hold the phone.

830
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:44,896
Hold the phone, here.

831
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,524
Shut up.

832
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,502
You know what?

833
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,421
You're right.

834
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,424
There.

835
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:15,552
You hold all the money.
I gotta go back in action.

836
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,888
You don't know
what it's like in combat.

837
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:20,265
You get shot,
somebody takes your money.

838
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,810
Before the plasma comes,
a guy's got his hand in your pocket.

839
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:27,022
Guffy. Guffy.

840
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:32,068
- I don't want you to get killed.
- Who's talking about getting killed?

841
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,778
You take care of the money.

842
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:38,575
Sarge, the tanks aren't there. They've
been pulled back. We gotta catch up.

843
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,538
So long, partner.

844
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,373
Take care of yourself.

845
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,042
Guffy.

846
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:53,548
Don't you want to kiss me?

847
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:13,610
Don't forget to feed the chickens, huh?

848
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:21,826
Keep moving. Let's go, keep moving.

849
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:26,164
Come on, sarge, we gotta catch up
with the tanks. Let's go!

850
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,792
Goodbye, Louise!

851
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,964
Put that in there.

852
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:36,800
Come on, get to it. Get to it.

853
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:16,298
Lion Battalion,
take up bombardment position.

854
01:33:16,465 --> 01:33:18,717
Panther Battalion, stand by.

855
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:26,850
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

856
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,745
- Hold it. Where you running?
- The Germans are coming.

857
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:50,206
- Where's your rifle? Where's your outfit?
- Captured.

858
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:55,378
- Dead. Gone. They're all gone.
- Sergeant, stop that man!

859
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,590
He's not doing anything we aren't.

860
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,570
We're staying.

861
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,781
Countermand that order to fall back.

862
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:26,034
All units are to make a stand
where they are and fight.

863
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:29,079
And that means everybody.
Except tanks.

864
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:32,248
Clerks, cooks, bakers, staff officers.

865
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,794
Anybody who can carry a rifle
is to use it.

866
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:42,926
- Kiley.
- Come on, bring it all in.

867
01:34:45,137 --> 01:34:49,516
It's very difficult for me to say this.
I was wrong.

868
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,444
- Sergeant, haul them out again.
- Everybody out.

869
01:35:01,612 --> 01:35:03,947
Come on, what are you waiting for?

870
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,658
Well, it looks like we're staying.

871
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:09,911
- I never have a rifle when I need one.
- Take mine.

872
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:12,330
- It's on the house.
- I'll return it later.

873
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,458
- Let's go!
- Let's go. Come on.

874
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,838
We're on the line, sir.

875
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:23,466
General Grey speaking. Fred.

876
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:26,970
I'm holding at Ambleve,
but I can't last without heavy stuff.

877
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,972
What can you let me have?

878
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:33,935
155s will do the trick.
Where are they? On flatcars.

879
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,979
Are we still holding the rail line?

880
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:39,065
Good.
Now, when can you get them here?

881
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:43,695
Well, not later, Fred.
We're counting on you.

882
01:38:26,358 --> 01:38:27,984
Bring that ammo up!

883
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:31,988
Stack it up. Position, on the wall.

884
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:40,288
Get some beef behind it.

885
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:42,832
Hey, lay those logs in there.

886
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:51,257
Let's go! Let's move it out.

887
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:56,471
First Platoon, follow me.
Second Platoon, over there.

888
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:04,520
Fire.

889
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:56,364
Soldier!

890
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:58,074
Go! Go!

891
01:40:04,915 --> 01:40:06,624
Everybody out!

892
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:09,752
- Wait a minute. Where you men going?
- To the shelter.

893
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,381
- No, you're not. Grab your rifles.
- But we're cooks.

894
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:16,843
Lunch is over.
Get your rifles and follow me.

895
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,933
- Stay away from the buildings!
- Soldier, up front.

896
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,935
I'm in the Air Corps.

897
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:28,479
You're in the infantry now. Follow me.

898
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,337
We're driving them back.
They're running.

899
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:36,214
This is only the first round.

900
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,042
Why have you stopped?

901
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,669
They have dug in.

902
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:17,547
- It's a very strong defense.
- Bypass it.

903
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:21,217
- I have considered that.
- There's nothing to consider.

904
01:42:22,344 --> 01:42:27,598
We must measure what we might gain
by what we might lose.

905
01:42:29,184 --> 01:42:31,060
Come on.

906
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:45,575
You were to have been 10 kilometers
west of Ambleve by this hour.

907
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:47,076
Why are you still here?

908
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:50,371
My first attack failed.
I must take Ambleve.

909
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:54,917
We are wasting time.
Time, Hessler, you don't have much.

910
01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:58,129
Ambleve is an isolated resistance.
Go around it.

911
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:01,591
We have surrounded
and bypassed Bastogne. Do the same.

912
01:43:01,758 --> 01:43:04,886
General, it will be dark in one hour.

913
01:43:05,053 --> 01:43:09,015
I want your permission
for a night assault with all my armor.

914
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:11,475
Colonel Hessler...

915
01:43:11,643 --> 01:43:15,146
...you will break off this engagement,
proceed with your mission.

916
01:43:15,397 --> 01:43:17,607
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

917
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:21,819
General, before you go,
may I show you something?

918
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,613
What is it?

919
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,620
A chocolate cake.

920
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,747
Well?

921
01:43:32,915 --> 01:43:37,251
It was taken from a captured
American private. It's still fresh.

922
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:42,131
If you will look at the wrapping, general,
you will see it comes from Boston.

923
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:43,966
And?

924
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:47,803
General,
do you realize what this means?

925
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:50,848
It means that the Americans
have fuel and planes...

926
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:54,310
...to fly cake
across the Atlantic Ocean.

927
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:58,439
They have no conception of defeat.

928
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:02,652
We have the opportunity here
to break their morale...

929
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:05,488
...to destroy their will to fight.

930
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:09,492
That is why you must permit me
to reduce Ambleve to ashes.

931
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:25,675
You have until 0400.

932
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,969
That is all.

933
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:03,726
We have silenced their guns.
Now we will attack.

934
01:48:03,894 --> 01:48:06,896
Your infantry will go in with my tanks.

935
01:48:07,063 --> 01:48:08,898
Yes, sir.

936
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:27,750
Second Platoon, over there.

937
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,418
Let's go. Move it out.

938
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:33,339
We'd better get going, sir, before
the town is completely surrounded.

939
01:48:33,965 --> 01:48:38,594
Shall I send a runner to Major Wolenski
telling him to cover our withdrawal?

940
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:42,348
No, that's the kind of order I give
to a man myself.

941
01:49:12,462 --> 01:49:14,129
Aim at the trench!

942
01:49:58,174 --> 01:50:00,551
Some more. Let's get closer.

943
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:12,146
Bring up some more plastique!

944
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,265
Major Wolenski!

945
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:51,393
The general.

946
01:50:53,563 --> 01:50:56,482
Hurry up! Move that ammo up!

947
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:01,236
Wolenski, we've been ordered out.

948
01:51:01,404 --> 01:51:05,866
I'll need time to save what I can. Your
outfit will have to cover the withdrawal.

949
01:51:06,034 --> 01:51:09,036
- They're coming down the chimney, sir.
- Do what you can.

950
01:51:09,204 --> 01:51:10,913
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

951
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:15,584
I only loaned you this rifle.

952
01:51:16,586 --> 01:51:20,214
- See you later, major.
- Yes, sir.

953
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:27,096
Spread out.

954
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:46,782
Bring up ammo!

955
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,348
Sister.

956
01:53:35,725 --> 01:53:37,226
Colonel, excuse me.

957
01:53:37,393 --> 01:53:39,561
We are looking for someone
who can help.

958
01:53:39,729 --> 01:53:41,355
Be brief.

959
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:44,608
There are many wounded townspeople
in the church cellar.

960
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:48,278
We need medicine, bandages.
Can you spare any?

961
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,239
We have nothing to spare.

962
01:53:50,406 --> 01:53:53,742
If there are captured medical supplies,
give them to the nuns.

963
01:53:53,952 --> 01:53:56,745
Yes, sir. Follow me.

964
01:54:30,446 --> 01:54:31,822
He fired with this.

965
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:40,289
Jean, Jean, Jean!

966
01:54:46,129 --> 01:54:48,338
Don't do anything to him, please.

967
01:54:48,506 --> 01:54:49,965
This is the boy's father.

968
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:53,468
I beg you. He's just a little boy.

969
01:54:53,636 --> 01:54:56,305
He's my only child.

970
01:54:56,806 --> 01:54:59,975
Don't do anything to him, please.

971
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:06,315
Release the boy.

972
01:55:10,486 --> 01:55:11,820
Jean.

973
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,533
Shoot the father.

974
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:23,457
- Papa! Papa!
- No!

975
01:55:31,841 --> 01:55:33,508
Colonel.

976
01:55:33,676 --> 01:55:36,178
The senior American officer
taken prisoner...

977
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:38,513
...requests permission
to speak with you.

978
01:55:38,681 --> 01:55:41,975
- What does he want?
- He'll only discuss it with you.

979
01:55:42,143 --> 01:55:44,269
- Rank?
- Major.

980
01:55:44,896 --> 01:55:47,856
- He has two minutes.
- Yes, sir.

981
01:56:02,705 --> 01:56:04,414
Conrad.

982
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:10,879
- What is this food?
- It's the best this town has to offer.

983
01:56:11,047 --> 01:56:14,383
I told you, tanks run on petrol
and soldiers run on rations.

984
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:19,221
I must eat as my men do so I know
how far they can go. Take it away.

985
01:56:29,732 --> 01:56:32,859
- Conrad.
- Yeah?

986
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:39,074
My Christmas present,
it's for your sons.

987
01:56:39,242 --> 01:56:41,076
Your promotion to first sergeant.

988
01:56:49,585 --> 01:56:52,379
My sons thank you.

989
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:56,967
Go in.

990
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:03,098
What is it?

991
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:06,893
Colonel, stragglers you've captured
tell me...

992
01:57:07,061 --> 01:57:10,272
...that helpless American prisoners
have been massacred.

993
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:13,900
- Where?
- Malmedy.

994
01:57:14,068 --> 01:57:18,947
And as senior officer, I can't control
my men unless I have your assurance...

995
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:23,285
...they'll not be murdered. I want your
signed order stating that my men...

996
01:57:23,453 --> 01:57:25,787
...will be accorded the protection...

997
01:57:25,955 --> 01:57:29,124
...guaranteed prisoners of war
by the Geneva Convention.

998
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:33,503
Unless I return with that order, colonel,
the prisoners will riot.

999
01:57:33,671 --> 01:57:36,590
Undoubtedly, you'll kill us,
but so help me...

1000
01:57:36,758 --> 01:57:39,593
...we'll take a hell of a lot
of you with us.

1001
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:43,472
There will be no signed order.
There will be no riot.

1002
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:47,684
You will not be allowed to return
to your men to instigate that riot.

1003
01:57:48,936 --> 01:57:51,688
You listen to me, colonel.

1004
01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:54,107
There are survivors in all massacres.

1005
01:57:54,275 --> 01:57:56,860
I warn you,
if any of my men are harmed...

1006
01:57:57,028 --> 01:58:01,823
...you will be held responsible. There will
be no place on earth that you can hide.

1007
01:58:01,991 --> 01:58:06,912
And when you're found, I hope I'm the
man that ties the rope around your neck.

1008
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:11,500
Major...

1009
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:15,670
...I have never liked threats.

1010
01:58:15,838 --> 01:58:18,340
I do not kill prisoners.

1011
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:23,845
But I will have no compunction at
shooting you myself for your last remark.

1012
01:58:24,055 --> 01:58:25,972
Then do it.

1013
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:36,858
You are deliberately trying
to provoke me.

1014
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:41,488
Yes, colonel, that's right.

1015
01:58:41,697 --> 01:58:47,035
If I walk out of here alive, I know
my men will be properly treated.

1016
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:50,038
Diepel!

1017
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:57,045
Return this officer
to the prisoners' compound, alive.

1018
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:58,713
Come.

1019
01:58:59,882 --> 01:59:03,844
Major, I'm relying on you
to reassure your men...

1020
01:59:04,011 --> 01:59:08,348
...I have no time
for troublesome prisoners.

1021
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:15,772
Tiger to Standard O-bay,
General Kohler.

1022
01:59:18,568 --> 01:59:21,403
Your usual ration, sir.

1023
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:27,242
General Kohler. Hessler.

1024
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:32,622
General, is it true that American
prisoners were executed at Malmedy?

1025
01:59:32,874 --> 01:59:35,458
There are SS units
in the Malmedy sector.

1026
01:59:35,626 --> 01:59:39,546
I can't assume responsibility
for every soldier on this front.

1027
01:59:40,089 --> 01:59:43,425
Do you realize the consequences
of this act?

1028
01:59:43,593 --> 01:59:47,304
I have lost 17 tanks and a battalion
of men leveling Ambleve...

1029
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:51,057
...for the sole purpose of reducing
the enemy's will to fight.

1030
01:59:51,225 --> 01:59:54,477
This massacre will stiffen resistance
to us everywhere.

1031
01:59:54,645 --> 01:59:58,940
It will turn a demoralized mob
into avenging soldiers.

1032
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:01,109
You are being insolent, colonel.

1033
02:00:01,277 --> 02:00:03,153
Concern yourself with your mission.

1034
02:00:03,321 --> 02:00:05,947
You are to reach Saint-Michel
by 1600 tomorrow.

1035
02:00:06,115 --> 02:00:10,285
- Be there.
- Yes, sir.

1036
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:44,486
They've taken a beating,
and they look it.

1037
02:00:45,321 --> 02:00:47,113
They're not a rabble.

1038
02:00:47,281 --> 02:00:49,991
They're retreating like soldiers.

1039
02:00:54,205 --> 02:00:56,498
There's still fight in them.

1040
02:00:56,999 --> 02:01:00,001
Where are we gonna stop
and put up the fight?

1041
02:01:00,878 --> 02:01:04,631
At our last line of defense,
the River Meuse.

1042
02:01:04,799 --> 02:01:07,676
We'll cross it
and dig in on the west bank.

1043
02:01:07,843 --> 02:01:10,512
At least we'll get the Germans wet.

1044
02:01:13,683 --> 02:01:16,142
Still sore I pulled you out of Ambleve?

1045
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:19,145
I was contributing
to the war effort there, sir.

1046
02:01:19,313 --> 02:01:23,733
Try to keep your feet from freezing
while we figure a way to stop them.

1047
02:01:23,901 --> 02:01:26,027
They've made mistakes before.

1048
02:01:26,195 --> 02:01:28,738
Where have they made one this time?

1049
02:01:30,366 --> 02:01:32,826
Well, they got me mad at them.

1050
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:45,380
Shut up. We'll get there.

1051
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:51,970
Come on. Come on.

1052
02:01:53,305 --> 02:01:55,515
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1053
02:01:55,683 --> 02:01:59,352
- What's holding you up?
- I'm out of gas.

1054
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,731
I reported low about an hour ago.
Where's the fuel truck?

1055
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:06,901
Get off the road and wait for it.
Keep moving.

1056
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:09,612
- Pull it over.
- Move it!

1057
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:13,366
Come on!

1058
02:02:16,912 --> 02:02:19,039
Keep moving.

1059
02:02:19,206 --> 02:02:22,208
Keep moving. Move it.

1060
02:02:33,429 --> 02:02:35,764
Where are you going?
Will you wait a minute?

1061
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:38,058
I need gas.

1062
02:02:40,061 --> 02:02:41,561
Oh, get down.

1063
02:02:44,565 --> 02:02:46,900
Why, you ugly jerk!

1064
02:02:58,704 --> 02:03:01,748
Here, use your big mouth on that.

1065
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:05,168
Hey, come on, let's get with it.

1066
02:03:09,673 --> 02:03:12,592
What are you laughing at?
Come and move this thing.

1067
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:15,553
- You're all wet, sarge.
- Now get it up.

1068
02:03:22,269 --> 02:03:26,064
- What are you gonna do with this?
- "What are you gonna do with this?"

1069
02:03:26,232 --> 02:03:28,191
Siphon with it, idiot. Put it in.

1070
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:33,113
- What are you thinking?
- Same thing you are.

1071
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,157
Those prisoners you brought
had rubber hoses on them.

1072
02:03:36,325 --> 02:03:38,618
They've been carrying those
to siphon gas?

1073
02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:41,287
At the Our River,
I saw a German fuel truck...

1074
02:03:41,455 --> 02:03:43,957
...drop oil drums in the water,
they floated.

1075
02:03:44,792 --> 02:03:47,752
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Gasoline, sir.

1076
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:51,798
Empty fuel drums and men carrying
siphon hoses add up to one thing.

1077
02:03:51,966 --> 02:03:54,968
The Germans are low on gas.
They have to forage for it.

1078
02:03:55,136 --> 02:03:57,428
That's their weakness.

1079
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:01,975
- Get this off to headquarters.
- Sir.

1080
02:04:02,351 --> 02:04:06,855
A, what is the fuel consumption
of a Tiger tank?

1081
02:04:07,481 --> 02:04:11,317
B, the exact distance from the
Siegfried Line to the Meuse River.

1082
02:04:11,485 --> 02:04:15,989
C, what is the estimate of fuel reserves
in the German army?

1083
02:04:16,157 --> 02:04:18,825
- That's it.
- Yes, sir, right away.

1084
02:04:22,454 --> 02:04:24,998
What are you laughing at, you idiot?

1085
02:04:34,508 --> 02:04:36,384
What is the situation in Bastogne?

1086
02:04:36,552 --> 02:04:39,637
Our forces have completely
encircled the Americans.

1087
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:44,475
Their situation is hopeless. They have
no recourse but to surrender.

1088
02:04:48,689 --> 02:04:52,025
Hey, look what's coming. Lieutenant!

1089
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:06,164
Halt!

1090
02:05:13,797 --> 02:05:16,216
The German commander wishes
to communicate...

1091
02:05:16,383 --> 02:05:19,928
...with the American commander
of the encircled town of Bastogne.

1092
02:05:20,095 --> 02:05:22,931
He's a little busy right now.
What's on your mind?

1093
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:29,103
"From the German commanding general
to the commander of American troops...

1094
02:05:29,313 --> 02:05:30,939
...fighting in Bastogne.

1095
02:05:31,899 --> 02:05:33,942
With the changing fortunes of war...

1096
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:37,403
...the U.S.A. Forces
in and around Bastogne...

1097
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:42,617
...have become completely surrounded
by superior German armored units.

1098
02:05:43,244 --> 02:05:46,246
The only possibility
to spare the American troops...

1099
02:05:46,413 --> 02:05:50,625
...from total annihilation
is their honorable surrender...

1100
02:05:50,834 --> 02:05:55,421
...which will also prevent the slaughter
of helpless civilians."

1101
02:05:56,090 --> 02:05:58,925
You have one hour of truce to reply.

1102
02:06:00,344 --> 02:06:02,303
Blindfold him.

1103
02:06:02,471 --> 02:06:04,347
Take him up to the command post.

1104
02:06:21,573 --> 02:06:23,741
Repeat, please.

1105
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:27,954
Is that all?

1106
02:06:28,122 --> 02:06:30,957
Sir, I have a message from Bastogne.

1107
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:37,463
What is it?

1108
02:06:37,631 --> 02:06:40,425
I don't understand it.

1109
02:06:41,927 --> 02:06:45,763
"From the American commander of
Bastogne to the German commander.

1110
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:47,640
Nuts."

1111
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:53,104
Nuts.

1112
02:08:04,593 --> 02:08:06,552
Hey, over there.

1113
02:08:07,971 --> 02:08:09,263
Hey, it's an officer.

1114
02:08:09,473 --> 02:08:11,349
Boy, are we glad to see you.

1115
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:14,394
- I haven't eaten in 12 hours.
- We got lost.

1116
02:08:14,603 --> 02:08:16,062
Hold it. Wait a minute.

1117
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:19,065
Do you think we should surrender,
lieutenant?

1118
02:08:21,402 --> 02:08:23,236
Surrender?

1119
02:08:24,196 --> 02:08:25,863
No.

1120
02:08:27,908 --> 02:08:31,285
Just stay loose, all of you. Stay loose.

1121
02:08:31,495 --> 02:08:33,413
Now, give me that light.

1122
02:08:41,088 --> 02:08:43,881
All right, spread out.
Get some rest.

1123
02:08:44,049 --> 02:08:46,509
We'll get started when it's light.

1124
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:18,833
General Grey.

1125
02:09:19,042 --> 02:09:21,461
Sir, this just came in.

1126
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:25,965
- Move along.
- Any of you guys been to Ambleve?

1127
02:09:26,133 --> 02:09:28,134
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?

1128
02:09:28,302 --> 02:09:32,472
- Any of you guys been to Ambleve?
- Come on, Guffy, we'll get in trouble.

1129
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:34,474
I gotta know.

1130
02:09:35,684 --> 02:09:37,685
I've been to Ambleve.

1131
02:09:37,853 --> 02:09:39,479
- You know Ambleve inn?
- Yeah.

1132
02:09:39,646 --> 02:09:41,147
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

1133
02:09:41,315 --> 02:09:43,858
There's nothing left of it.

1134
02:09:48,447 --> 02:09:50,615
Guffy, come on.

1135
02:09:55,829 --> 02:09:58,372
When are they gonna let us fight?

1136
02:09:58,874 --> 02:10:00,708
Let's go.

1137
02:10:05,506 --> 02:10:09,467
It's here, sir, the information
you requested from headquarters.

1138
02:10:11,512 --> 02:10:13,137
That's it.

1139
02:10:13,305 --> 02:10:15,389
They're running out of gas.

1140
02:10:16,475 --> 02:10:19,519
Where's the spearhead of
the German advance right now?

1141
02:10:19,686 --> 02:10:23,523
We place it four miles past Ambleve,
moving west.

1142
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:25,399
Where will they be at daybreak?

1143
02:10:25,609 --> 02:10:30,905
If they travel all night, they should be
nine miles due east of the fuel depot.

1144
02:10:31,114 --> 02:10:33,324
We'll be there to meet them.

1145
02:10:33,492 --> 02:10:36,244
I'm committing my tanks.

1146
02:10:36,411 --> 02:10:38,329
We'll use plan F.

1147
02:10:38,497 --> 02:10:41,666
- Get me Blue Code 301.
- 301.

1148
02:10:42,042 --> 02:10:46,337
All right, mount up. Crank them up.
Let's go. Let's go.

1149
02:10:49,132 --> 02:10:51,342
Let's go. Crank them up,
crank them up.

1150
02:11:13,407 --> 02:11:15,408
Look at that fog.

1151
02:11:16,368 --> 02:11:19,912
If it stays, we won't find them
and we won't fight.

1152
02:11:20,581 --> 02:11:23,541
If it lifts, they'll find us.

1153
02:11:24,251 --> 02:11:27,461
And that will be the end of our men
and our tanks.

1154
02:11:29,298 --> 02:11:32,049
And I'm praying that it lifts.

1155
02:11:34,094 --> 02:11:36,762
What does that make me, Dan?

1156
02:11:38,265 --> 02:11:40,224
A general.

1157
02:11:52,487 --> 02:11:54,989
Is that so, general?

1158
02:11:55,198 --> 02:11:56,741
It's very interesting.

1159
02:11:57,784 --> 02:11:59,785
Thank you, general.

1160
02:12:05,584 --> 02:12:08,628
Our column has made
the farthest advance.

1161
02:12:08,795 --> 02:12:14,634
We have outrun the other panzers.
The eyes of Germany are on us.

1162
02:12:14,801 --> 02:12:18,304
The Fuhrer himself will decorate me.

1163
02:12:19,306 --> 02:12:21,974
We have done it, Conrad.
We have done it.

1164
02:12:22,142 --> 02:12:24,977
Then I was wrong.
We have won the war.

1165
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,313
No.

1166
02:12:28,106 --> 02:12:30,149
You mean we have lost?

1167
02:12:30,317 --> 02:12:32,276
No.

1168
02:12:33,153 --> 02:12:37,281
I don't understand. If we have not won
and we have not lost...

1169
02:12:37,449 --> 02:12:38,783
...then what's happening?

1170
02:12:38,992 --> 02:12:42,662
The best thing possible is happening.
The war will go on.

1171
02:12:43,163 --> 02:12:46,332
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

1172
02:12:46,958 --> 02:12:50,169
On and on and on.

1173
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:54,548
- But it must come to an end.
- You're a fool, Conrad.

1174
02:12:54,758 --> 02:12:59,637
Those of us who understood
knew, in 1941, we could never win.

1175
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:03,516
You mean, colonel, for three years,
we have been fighting...

1176
02:13:03,684 --> 02:13:07,853
...without any hope of victory?
- There are many kinds of victory.

1177
02:13:08,021 --> 02:13:12,024
For the German army to survive,
for us to remain in uniform...

1178
02:13:12,192 --> 02:13:14,860
...that is our victory.

1179
02:13:15,028 --> 02:13:19,865
Conrad, the world is not going
to get rid of us after all.

1180
02:13:21,827 --> 02:13:23,869
But when do we go home?

1181
02:13:25,706 --> 02:13:27,415
This is our home.

1182
02:13:29,668 --> 02:13:35,506
And my sons? When do I see them?
What will become of them?

1183
02:13:36,216 --> 02:13:41,804
They will become German soldiers,
and you will be proud of them.

1184
02:13:49,438 --> 02:13:50,771
Conrad.

1185
02:13:50,939 --> 02:13:55,609
You still have any of those delicacies left
you offered me at Ambleve?

1186
02:13:55,819 --> 02:13:56,861
Yes, sir.

1187
02:13:57,195 --> 02:14:01,407
Prepare them for me, will you?
I'm in very good appetite.

1188
02:14:06,246 --> 02:14:08,247
- See anything?
- Nothing.

1189
02:14:08,415 --> 02:14:10,583
It's like they disappeared.

1190
02:14:14,713 --> 02:14:17,214
- They been spotted yet?
- No, sir.

1191
02:14:17,382 --> 02:14:19,925
They must have changed course
during the night.

1192
02:14:22,053 --> 02:14:24,138
Call our scouts again.

1193
02:14:32,105 --> 02:14:34,732
- See anything?
- Nothing.

1194
02:14:35,233 --> 02:14:37,318
Red River Six. Red River Six.

1195
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:39,320
Scouted designated territory.

1196
02:14:39,488 --> 02:14:41,071
No sign of German tanks.

1197
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:55,127
Can't see 20 yards. They're nowhere
around, or I'd hear something.

1198
02:14:57,631 --> 02:14:59,256
Let's be reasonable, colonel.

1199
02:14:59,424 --> 02:15:02,593
You expect me to take you up?
Nothing's flying in this fog.

1200
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:05,596
That makes it safe. We won't
bump into another plane.

1201
02:15:05,764 --> 02:15:09,350
How can we see the panzer column
when we have zero visibility?

1202
02:15:09,518 --> 02:15:13,646
You'll catch pneumonia if you don't
stop arguing. Get behind that stick.

1203
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:15,856
Wait a minute.

1204
02:15:16,024 --> 02:15:17,650
Where are the flying orders?

1205
02:15:17,818 --> 02:15:19,777
I wanna see them.

1206
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:22,696
I wanna know what lunatic
issued them.

1207
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:26,700
There are no orders, Joe.
I'm the lunatic.

1208
02:15:27,702 --> 02:15:30,955
Well, there's no insanity in my family.

1209
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:35,334
If we don't find that panzer column,
there will be no tank battle.

1210
02:15:35,502 --> 02:15:37,628
We'll have to stop them with infantry.

1211
02:15:37,796 --> 02:15:40,840
A lot of guys are gonna die
to keep you safe and cozy.

1212
02:15:41,007 --> 02:15:43,926
You sure know how
to hit below the belt. That's dirty.

1213
02:15:44,344 --> 02:15:48,180
We're not in a pillow fight, Joe.
Sorry it hurts.

1214
02:15:50,350 --> 02:15:52,351
Get in.

1215
02:15:56,189 --> 02:15:58,524
All reports negative, sir.

1216
02:16:08,201 --> 02:16:11,036
Well, they must be someplace.

1217
02:16:12,038 --> 02:16:15,040
The earth couldn't have just
swallowed them up.

1218
02:16:17,836 --> 02:16:21,213
- Send out additional patrols.
- Yes, sir.

1219
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:34,059
What am I doing up here?
It's like flying inside a light bulb.

1220
02:16:34,227 --> 02:16:37,187
Just stay on the course I gave you.
We'll find them.

1221
02:16:37,355 --> 02:16:40,357
- How do you know?
- Hessler's looking for gas.

1222
02:16:40,525 --> 02:16:43,777
He's gambling on capturing our supply.
Get lower.

1223
02:16:43,987 --> 02:16:47,406
- We're down to 500 feet.
- We just have to pick up a landmark.

1224
02:16:47,574 --> 02:16:51,243
Hills are all around. We'll pick up
a landmark right in the kisser.

1225
02:16:51,411 --> 02:16:53,245
Try it a little lower.

1226
02:17:02,422 --> 02:17:06,091
- I can't see a damn thing.
- All right, cut your engine.

1227
02:17:06,635 --> 02:17:08,928
Glide and listen. We can hear them.

1228
02:17:09,095 --> 02:17:14,934
- Are you telling me to glide at 200 feet?
- Cut the talk and the engine.

1229
02:17:32,619 --> 02:17:36,789
- I'm calling this off.
- Sure. Now, let's try it again.

1230
02:17:41,127 --> 02:17:43,587
Okay, cut your engine.

1231
02:17:47,133 --> 02:17:50,260
If we were 100 feet higher,
I'd jump and leave you here.

1232
02:17:50,428 --> 02:17:52,054
Quiet.

1233
02:18:01,481 --> 02:18:04,066
There's the depot.

1234
02:18:08,989 --> 02:18:10,948
There's the river.

1235
02:18:12,325 --> 02:18:15,160
The column has to be due south.

1236
02:18:16,955 --> 02:18:18,288
That's your course.

1237
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:24,670
Get her down, Joe,
where we can see.

1238
02:18:27,507 --> 02:18:31,051
- What's our altitude?
- Four hundred feet.

1239
02:18:31,219 --> 02:18:33,387
All right, cut the engine.

1240
02:18:42,188 --> 02:18:43,689
Do you hear that?

1241
02:18:43,857 --> 02:18:46,108
Yeah. We're going down for a look.

1242
02:18:58,371 --> 02:19:01,206
Hit your engine, let's get out of here.

1243
02:19:03,626 --> 02:19:07,046
Red River Six, this is Red River Two.
The enemy column sighted.

1244
02:19:07,213 --> 02:19:11,341
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

1245
02:19:11,551 --> 02:19:14,094
Enemy column sighted, sir.

1246
02:19:14,262 --> 02:19:16,221
Found them.

1247
02:19:17,557 --> 02:19:20,893
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

1248
02:19:25,732 --> 02:19:28,358
Repeat. Enemy column sighted.

1249
02:19:32,572 --> 02:19:35,449
Come in, Red River Two.
Come in, Red River Two.

1250
02:19:35,658 --> 02:19:37,034
Come in, Red River Two.

1251
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:39,411
- Contact broken.
- Where's that coordinate?

1252
02:19:39,579 --> 02:19:41,455
- Right here.
- What's the terrain?

1253
02:19:41,664 --> 02:19:43,373
Low rolling hills.

1254
02:19:43,541 --> 02:19:46,085
Order our tanks to intercept them
at that point.

1255
02:19:46,252 --> 02:19:48,462
- Yes, sir.
- Red River Two.

1256
02:19:48,671 --> 02:19:51,924
- That's Kiley.
- I know.

1257
02:19:54,677 --> 02:19:56,762
There's a plane up there.

1258
02:19:58,431 --> 02:20:00,766
He's in trouble.

1259
02:20:16,449 --> 02:20:19,701
Medic! Medic!

1260
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,765
Schneider.

1261
02:20:43,309 --> 02:20:45,519
From Spitzbergen,
the weather forecast.

1262
02:20:45,728 --> 02:20:47,980
Warm front moving in.

1263
02:20:49,983 --> 02:20:53,944
Notify all columns, weather clearing.

1264
02:21:12,964 --> 02:21:15,966
Enemy forces are reported crossing
the River Meuse.

1265
02:21:16,134 --> 02:21:19,303
Send scouts forward.
I want their numbers and composition.

1266
02:21:19,470 --> 02:21:20,512
Yes, sir.

1267
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:23,682
Conrad. My binoculars.

1268
02:21:26,186 --> 02:21:28,145
Conrad?

1269
02:21:36,529 --> 02:21:38,655
I was saying I wanted...

1270
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:42,910
What is it, Conrad?

1271
02:21:43,077 --> 02:21:45,662
Nothing, sir.

1272
02:21:47,415 --> 02:21:51,877
I was saying I wanted my binoculars.

1273
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,008
What's wrong?

1274
02:21:59,093 --> 02:22:03,513
I would like to be transferred
to other duties, sir.

1275
02:22:06,601 --> 02:22:12,064
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't ask me, sir. Just transfer me.

1276
02:22:13,107 --> 02:22:16,026
- For combat duty?
- Yes, sir.

1277
02:22:17,528 --> 02:22:21,448
You want to fight?
Very admirable, but why?

1278
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:26,203
Personal reasons, sir.

1279
02:22:28,581 --> 02:22:30,958
Personal reasons.

1280
02:22:31,918 --> 02:22:36,088
Personal reasons? What the devil
are you trying to say?

1281
02:22:36,256 --> 02:22:39,424
It's the right of every German soldier
to ask permission...

1282
02:22:39,592 --> 02:22:41,802
...for a transfer to other duties.

1283
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:45,472
It is the right of every commanding
officer to know the reason...

1284
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:50,394
...for the transfer, and I want the truth.
- The truth...

1285
02:22:50,561 --> 02:22:54,564
...is that I'm a fool.
I believed in you.

1286
02:22:54,732 --> 02:22:57,442
But all you believe in is the war.

1287
02:22:57,610 --> 02:23:00,779
You have the war. You like the war.

1288
02:23:00,947 --> 02:23:04,408
And all I have are my sons,
and I don't want to lose them.

1289
02:23:05,243 --> 02:23:09,329
- I'm not responsible for your children.
- You are. You'd make them soldiers.

1290
02:23:09,497 --> 02:23:11,498
- Yes. They will fight.
- They will die.

1291
02:23:11,666 --> 02:23:15,294
- If necessary.
- Necessary for who? For you?

1292
02:23:16,963 --> 02:23:20,465
You are not only a fool,
you are a traitor.

1293
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:26,305
And you are a murderer.

1294
02:23:26,472 --> 02:23:31,476
You would murder my sons.
You would murder my country.

1295
02:23:31,644 --> 02:23:35,147
You would murder the whole world
to stay in that uniform.

1296
02:23:43,781 --> 02:23:46,491
It is only the memory of you
as a friend...

1297
02:23:46,659 --> 02:23:50,537
...that prevents me from having you
court-martialed. Get out.

1298
02:23:59,630 --> 02:24:03,175
Our scouts have sighted a brigade
of medium tanks.

1299
02:24:04,802 --> 02:24:08,472
- Light armor at this point? Any artillery?
- None.

1300
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:11,516
- And no infantry.
- They're committing their reserves.

1301
02:24:11,684 --> 02:24:15,437
We destroy them, they have nothing
between us and the fuel depot.

1302
02:24:16,564 --> 02:24:19,858
- Send all infantry to the rear.
- Yes, sir.

1303
02:24:21,319 --> 02:24:26,740
Diepel, assign this man to fuel trucks.

1304
02:24:29,702 --> 02:24:31,661
Yes, sir.

1305
02:24:35,875 --> 02:24:38,418
Sir, enemy advancing on our position.

1306
02:24:38,586 --> 02:24:42,089
Good. They've taken the bait.

1307
02:24:43,549 --> 02:24:45,217
Pritchard...

1308
02:24:45,385 --> 02:24:48,887
...we're going to test that information
we got from headquarters.

1309
02:24:50,348 --> 02:24:52,474
If it's accurate...

1310
02:24:52,892 --> 02:24:55,560
...we'll run them out of gas.

1311
02:24:58,523 --> 02:25:03,276
Tiger to all units, close hatches.
Forward.

1312
02:25:56,956 --> 02:25:59,666
Butcher, swing up and take positions
on the ridges.

1313
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:09,468
And watch that damn gully.
This is no time to lose a track.

1314
02:26:37,872 --> 02:26:39,956
Here they come.

1315
02:26:47,006 --> 02:26:50,133
Hold your fire
till they're right on us.

1316
02:26:53,346 --> 02:26:56,890
Load with hypershot.
Make every one count.

1317
02:27:06,859 --> 02:27:08,527
- Hold your fire.
- How long?

1318
02:27:08,694 --> 02:27:10,403
Until I tell you!

1319
02:27:14,492 --> 02:27:16,159
Attack in staggered formation.

1320
02:27:16,327 --> 02:27:19,371
First, Lion on the assault.
Second, Panther.

1321
02:27:23,376 --> 02:27:26,836
Remember, hold your fire
till they're within effective range.

1322
02:27:35,388 --> 02:27:38,723
- How long are we gonna wait?
- Until we can hit a soft spot.

1323
02:27:39,684 --> 02:27:42,686
Steady.

1324
02:27:42,853 --> 02:27:45,272
Hold it. Hold it.

1325
02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:48,900
Let them come on in. Let them come in.
That's the way.

1326
02:27:49,068 --> 02:27:51,861
Now! Let them have it!

1327
02:28:19,181 --> 02:28:22,434
Fire one more round,
then let's get the hell off this ridge.

1328
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:38,241
There's one coming up over the rise.
You see him?

1329
02:28:40,119 --> 02:28:42,829
Steady, boy. Ready on.

1330
02:28:44,832 --> 02:28:46,833
Fire!

1331
02:28:57,511 --> 02:29:01,181
Tiger to Panther, spread out to left.
Lion, spread out to right.

1332
02:29:01,349 --> 02:29:03,433
We will try to encircle.

1333
02:29:08,481 --> 02:29:11,691
Sherman damaged.
We'll finish it off.

1334
02:29:11,859 --> 02:29:15,737
Fire! It's a hit.

1335
02:29:16,530 --> 02:29:18,490
The next, 11 o'clock, 900.

1336
02:29:24,622 --> 02:29:25,664
Get in among them.

1337
02:29:25,831 --> 02:29:29,167
Mix with them so they can't fire
without hitting each other.

1338
02:29:38,344 --> 02:29:42,639
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.
There's a Kraut at 1 o'clock...

1339
02:29:42,807 --> 02:29:44,683
...with a pennant on his antenna.

1340
02:29:46,686 --> 02:29:48,853
This one belongs to me. He's mine.

1341
02:29:49,522 --> 02:29:51,356
There he is.

1342
02:29:51,524 --> 02:29:56,569
All right, kick her left, kid. Left.
Now, hard right! Hard right!

1343
02:29:59,532 --> 02:30:04,077
Stay with them! Range, 9-0-0.
Up two.

1344
02:30:05,371 --> 02:30:07,038
Fire!

1345
02:30:08,916 --> 02:30:10,417
Good shot! We got him!

1346
02:30:10,835 --> 02:30:13,712
Load again. Nothing has happened.

1347
02:30:13,921 --> 02:30:17,048
Hey, watch it. They see us.
Hey, let's get out of here.

1348
02:30:20,594 --> 02:30:23,179
Aim just ahead as he runs.

1349
02:30:30,062 --> 02:30:31,688
Fire!

1350
02:30:41,031 --> 02:30:42,907
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.

1351
02:30:43,075 --> 02:30:45,744
Come in, Butcher Three.
Report damage. Over.

1352
02:30:45,911 --> 02:30:50,749
I've got one dead and two wounded,
but we can still fight.

1353
02:30:52,334 --> 02:30:56,129
You lost your gun. Pull out. Try
to make it back to the assembly area.

1354
02:30:56,380 --> 02:30:58,548
We don't need a gun!
We can ram them.

1355
02:30:58,924 --> 02:31:01,092
Guffy, you're all busted up.

1356
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:05,722
Get out of there and make it back to
the assembly area. That's an order. Out.

1357
02:31:06,724 --> 02:31:08,892
Get her over the hill.

1358
02:31:13,397 --> 02:31:15,482
Driver, halt.

1359
02:31:15,983 --> 02:31:17,650
Let's try to pick them off.

1360
02:31:17,860 --> 02:31:22,280
Ten o'clock. Sherman, 800. Fire!

1361
02:32:02,029 --> 02:32:03,947
Baker Battalion reporting in.

1362
02:32:04,114 --> 02:32:07,283
Two tanks destroyed, one damaged,
out of action.

1363
02:32:07,451 --> 02:32:11,496
Phantom Battalion reports six tanks
destroyed, nine out of action.

1364
02:32:11,664 --> 02:32:16,835
Butcher Battalion reports 11 tanks
destroyed, eight on fire.

1365
02:32:18,504 --> 02:32:21,339
Keep burning up their gas.

1366
02:32:32,726 --> 02:32:36,437
Commander to base,
I am returning to refuel.

1367
02:33:23,736 --> 02:33:25,945
We are cutting them to pieces.

1368
02:33:26,113 --> 02:33:28,865
And they are emptying our tanks.

1369
02:33:33,412 --> 02:33:37,916
They are deliberately sacrificing
their armor to bleed us dry.

1370
02:33:39,209 --> 02:33:43,087
- What is the distance to the fuel depot?
- Twelve kilometers.

1371
02:33:43,923 --> 02:33:45,965
You will continue the battle here.

1372
02:33:46,133 --> 02:33:49,218
Let them believe their strategy
is succeeding.

1373
02:33:49,386 --> 02:33:52,263
I want 15 tanks and all
the empty trucks.

1374
02:33:52,431 --> 02:33:56,601
- I'm going on to the depot.
- Yes, sir, 15 tanks and fuel trucks.

1375
02:33:57,019 --> 02:33:58,770
Forward.

1376
02:34:17,665 --> 02:34:21,417
Hey, come on, soldier.
You can make it.

1377
02:34:32,346 --> 02:34:34,055
Pull it off the road!

1378
02:34:34,264 --> 02:34:36,766
- Wait!
- Come on! Come on!

1379
02:34:40,813 --> 02:34:44,357
Pull it off the road! Pull it off!

1380
02:34:46,443 --> 02:34:48,486
Get off the tank.

1381
02:34:48,654 --> 02:34:51,322
- Stay off the tank!
- You've got plenty of room.

1382
02:34:51,490 --> 02:34:54,659
- You can carry these guys.
- This tank ain't going no place.

1383
02:34:54,827 --> 02:34:57,078
Get off the tank!

1384
02:34:57,663 --> 02:34:59,706
Wherever you're going,
you better walk.

1385
02:34:59,873 --> 02:35:02,834
- What are you waiting here for?
- For the Germans.

1386
02:35:03,002 --> 02:35:05,586
They gotta come by here.

1387
02:35:06,839 --> 02:35:08,589
And I still got a machine gun.

1388
02:35:09,842 --> 02:35:11,884
There's not much you can
do with that.

1389
02:35:12,094 --> 02:35:15,304
- How much ammo do you have left?
- Two belts.

1390
02:35:15,472 --> 02:35:18,516
That will take care of some of them.

1391
02:35:19,685 --> 02:35:23,855
You got a wounded man. You think
you ought to get him to the medics?

1392
02:35:24,523 --> 02:35:27,525
Oh, he's not too bad.
He can still fight.

1393
02:35:28,902 --> 02:35:30,194
Get on, fellas.

1394
02:35:30,362 --> 02:35:33,823
Pull this tank back.
Head it west towards the River Meuse.

1395
02:35:33,991 --> 02:35:36,868
I'm warning you, lieutenant,
stay off my tank.

1396
02:35:41,915 --> 02:35:45,001
Either put up that gun or fire it,
sergeant.

1397
02:35:51,341 --> 02:35:54,761
It's okay, sarge. It's okay.

1398
02:36:30,589 --> 02:36:34,050
General, another panzer column
has been spotted four miles...

1399
02:36:34,218 --> 02:36:37,220
...from the River Meuse.
- Where did they come from?

1400
02:36:37,971 --> 02:36:40,473
Get me the officer in charge
of the fuel depot.

1401
02:36:40,682 --> 02:36:42,975
Get Silver Cloud 201. Quickly.

1402
02:36:43,185 --> 02:36:45,603
It's not a new column.

1403
02:36:46,897 --> 02:36:48,439
It's Hessler.

1404
02:36:48,607 --> 02:36:52,652
- He slipped away from the battle.
- The fuel depot, sir.

1405
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:56,572
General Grey speaking.
I'm giving you this order personally.

1406
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:59,951
Destroy the fuel depot at once.
I repeat.

1407
02:37:00,119 --> 02:37:02,328
Destroy the fuel depot at once.

1408
02:37:02,496 --> 02:37:07,834
Yes, sir. I'll destroy the depot
immediately, sir. Set it on fire.

1409
02:37:08,001 --> 02:37:12,964
No, sir, not a drop. I'll make sure
of that, sir. They won't get a drop.

1410
02:37:15,843 --> 02:37:19,971
All right, let's get these bodies
out of here. Let's go. Move!

1411
02:37:37,531 --> 02:37:41,325
Elke and Eisner report fuel
exhausted, sir.

1412
02:37:41,493 --> 02:37:43,494
What's Hessler's present position?

1413
02:37:43,662 --> 02:37:47,039
He reports being three kilometers
from the American fuel depot.

1414
02:37:47,249 --> 02:37:49,542
We must get there.

1415
02:37:49,751 --> 02:37:54,255
He will do it. Hessler will do it.

1416
02:38:07,019 --> 02:38:09,896
No shooting. I'll do the talking.

1417
02:38:10,063 --> 02:38:11,522
Get back to your post.

1418
02:38:16,570 --> 02:38:19,363
- Hold it up there, sergeant.
- Stop it.

1419
02:38:19,865 --> 02:38:23,868
- What can I do for you boys?
- We just made it. Could you fill her up?

1420
02:38:24,036 --> 02:38:28,039
Sure. Give you a hand, soldier. Sure.

1421
02:38:28,373 --> 02:38:30,750
Corporal, bring some of those
cans over here.

1422
02:38:30,918 --> 02:38:32,668
A couple of you boys help out.

1423
02:38:33,045 --> 02:38:37,506
Sergeant, we'll have you gassed up
and on your way in no time.

1424
02:38:37,674 --> 02:38:39,926
Get on your machine gun.

1425
02:38:40,093 --> 02:38:42,887
- Hey, lieutenant.
- Yeah?

1426
02:38:44,389 --> 02:38:48,517
Weren't you directing traffic
at the Our River Bridge?

1427
02:38:48,727 --> 02:38:52,104
Does the road to Ambleve
still lead to Malmedy?

1428
02:39:10,832 --> 02:39:12,541
Stop.

1429
02:39:19,883 --> 02:39:23,552
This fuel dump must be taken intact.

1430
02:39:26,932 --> 02:39:29,433
No shooting.

1431
02:39:48,287 --> 02:39:51,914
- Look. Let's get out of here.
- Hold it. They'll capture the gas.

1432
02:39:52,082 --> 02:39:54,417
We can't just leave it.

1433
02:39:55,961 --> 02:40:00,631
- What are you waiting for? Let's go.
- Hold it! They're after the gas.

1434
02:40:02,467 --> 02:40:05,970
- We ought to blow it up.
- We can't set a match to all that.

1435
02:40:06,138 --> 02:40:10,599
- We got no orders, lieutenant.
- Yeah? Well, I'm giving the orders.

1436
02:40:11,018 --> 02:40:14,186
Hey, lieutenant,
one of them is still alive.

1437
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:20,026
Hold it! Hold it! He's one of ours.

1438
02:40:21,987 --> 02:40:24,030
- I got you, colonel.
- Burn it.

1439
02:40:24,197 --> 02:40:26,657
- Take it easy. I know what to do.
- Burn it.

1440
02:40:26,825 --> 02:40:29,702
- Give him a hand, if you can.
- Burn it.

1441
02:40:29,911 --> 02:40:34,040
Come on, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!

1442
02:40:34,333 --> 02:40:37,960
Get those barrels off the end
of that ramp. Hold your fire, Guffy.

1443
02:40:38,128 --> 02:40:41,464
Move your tank behind that pile
until I tell you to shove.

1444
02:40:41,631 --> 02:40:45,509
You, get me some hand grenades
off the tank. Come on.

1445
02:40:50,474 --> 02:40:51,932
Come on.

1446
02:40:53,310 --> 02:40:56,187
You, get to that gas truck
and open all the valves.

1447
02:40:56,355 --> 02:40:59,690
Then get the hell away from it.

1448
02:41:23,382 --> 02:41:25,257
All right, roll them down.

1449
02:41:28,011 --> 02:41:29,345
Get off the road.

1450
02:41:29,679 --> 02:41:31,847
Give me a hand grenade.

1451
02:42:26,611 --> 02:42:28,404
He's getting away.

1452
02:42:34,327 --> 02:42:36,829
Okay, shove.

1453
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:49,800
Don't stop! Keep going! Don't stop!

1454
02:44:24,938 --> 02:44:26,772
Get this message to headquarters:

1455
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:26,772
They've abandoned their tanks,
and they're walking back to Germany.
