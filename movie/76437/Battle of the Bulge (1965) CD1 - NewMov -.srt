1
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:49,390
<i>December, 1944.</i>

2
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:53,558
<i>British and American armies</i>
<i>were on the threshold of victory. </i>

3
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,899
<i>Stretched across half of Europe,</i>
<i>the Allies gathered themselves... </i>

4
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,906
<i>... for the final assault on Germany. </i>

5
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,510
<i>To the north</i>
<i>stood Montgomery's Eighth Army... </i>

6
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:05,146
<i>... to the south, Patton's Third. </i>

7
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:08,010
<i>In the center, along an 88-mile front... </i>

8
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:13,417
<i>... a few battle-weary American divisions</i>
<i>rested in a quiet sector. </i>

9
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,687
<i>To them, the war seemed already won. </i>

10
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,657
<i>This is their story. </i>

11
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,923
We've been flying over these woods
all week.

12
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,124
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.

13
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,930
- Getting hungry, Joe?
- The war is over.

14
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:32,472
I hear GHQ is cutting orders
to ship us home for Christmas.

15
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,611
The German army still has
6 million men carrying arms.

16
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:38,645
I haven't heard they're going home
for Christmas.

17
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:43,215
Hey, there it is...

18
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,151
...the German army.

19
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,620
Let's go down and have a look.

20
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,364
- Buzz him again. I wanna get a picture.
- Okay.

21
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,560
This time, gun your engine.
Make him look up.

22
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,082
It worked.

23
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,718
Swing around.
I wanna get another one.

24
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:10,764
Conrad.

25
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,929
I am ashamed of you.

26
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,804
Get up.

27
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:22,811
They could have killed us, sir.

28
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,812
If you'd taken the pains
to have looked carefully...

29
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,782
...you would have observed it was
an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

30
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:34,150
You would stay in the car if it were
a fighter plane shooting at us.

31
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:38,049
I did not lose a war to die
in the back seat of a car.

32
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:42,288
Does the colonel think any of us
has a choice where we will die?

33
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:47,027
I know where you'll die, Conrad,
at home, in your own bed.

34
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:50,297
Is the colonel trying to get rid of me?

35
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:56,006
I think that the world is going
to get rid of both of us.

36
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:59,540
Pick up your cap! Put it on.

37
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:02,309
Try to look like a soldier!

38
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,517
What good is a soldier anyhow?

39
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,918
He wins, he loses.

40
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,581
What's he good for anyhow?

41
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,387
Conrad, I've told you before...

42
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:16,531
...never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.

43
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,064
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,327
It won't happen again.

45
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:40,352
Looks like something on the ground
at 10 o'clock. Let's take a look.

46
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,199
Nothing.

47
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,358
Let's go home.

48
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,490
<i>Herr Oberst</i> Hessler is here.

49
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,741
- Colonel Hessler, sir.
- Yes.

50
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,041
Well, Hessler.

51
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,515
It has been a long time.

52
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,017
How good it is to see you again.

53
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,422
You look the same.

54
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,750
Little...

55
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,255
Little leaner perhaps.

56
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:02,328
The Russian front does not put meat
on a man's bones, general.

57
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:06,229
Ah, yes. War is hard on all of us.

58
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:09,536
- Central heating.
- Yeah.

59
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,230
Crystal chandeliers.

60
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,505
You have a nice cellar.

61
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:17,373
Field Marshal Göring
gave me that painting.

62
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,741
Lovely, isn't it?

63
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,978
I imagine he found a bargain
in Paris last year.

64
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,923
My corporal's waiting.
He's had a hard drive.

65
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:35,086
Do you suppose there's somewhere
in these ruins he can find a bed?

66
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,763
Sit down, Hessler.

67
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:43,929
You have too little faith
in the genius of the German people.

68
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:47,574
A few stones
have been knocked down...

69
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,804
...but our country's strong,
united, determined...

70
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,072
...and more productive than ever.

71
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,654
The Allies think that their constant
air raids have undermined our morale.

72
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,052
- This they'll never do.
- Why have you sent for me, general?

73
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:09,064
You are our finest
panzer commander, Hessler.

74
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,925
You will lead us to victory.

75
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,594
Our Germany is now like an iceberg.

76
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:18,104
Only a fraction of it
can be seen on the surface.

77
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,002
Let me show you some of the results...

78
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:25,544
...of what Germany
has produced underground.

79
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,780
You will discover a new Germany...

80
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,614
...and will take a new pride
in being a German.

81
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:35,180
Our latest airplane.

82
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,790
A jet.

83
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,951
It flies at more than 900 kilometers
per hour.

84
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,360
Within six months,
we will have enough jet fighters...

85
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:47,002
...to shoot down every
Allied plane in the air.

86
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:51,530
Our V-1 rocket destroyed
20 percent of London.

87
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:56,110
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

88
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:01,713
The new 70-ton King Tiger tank.

89
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:06,215
It has two-and-a-half times
the firepower...

90
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:10,620
...and double the armor
of the American tanks.

91
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,720
Our Germany is far
from finished, Hessler.

92
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:19,891
It's a very beautiful model, general.

93
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:25,303
It proves that the Germans
are still the world's best toy makers.

94
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:31,242
The toys we are making these days
are not for children.

95
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,712
Let me show them to you.

96
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,166
Hands up! Get on over.

97
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,401
Hold it! Put them up! Stand against
the wall. Put them up, general.

98
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:04,879
Well, boys...

99
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,777
...looks like we've caught ourselves
a couple of big fish.

100
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,387
- One nice, fat Kraut trout.
- That's enough, now.

101
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:19,051
Sorry, general.
We are just rehearsing a commando raid.

102
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,695
Very good.

103
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,388
Not bad, Hessler, huh?

104
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,867
Had you fooled, didn't they?

105
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,900
Completely.

106
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,096
Unfortunately,
I am beyond playing games.

107
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,571
Oh, this is no game.

108
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,870
These are German soldiers, all of them.

109
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,776
Trained German soldiers.

110
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:45,147
Diepel commands the panzer grenadiers
attached to the 1st Tank Brigade.

111
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,551
These men will work with him.

112
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:51,887
Major Diepel, kindly explain
Operation Transit to the colonel.

113
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:55,827
The soldiers will be parachuted
behind the American lines.

114
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:59,934
Their mission:
To disrupt enemy communications.

115
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,730
We have organized many such teams.

116
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:08,070
Each will be led by a man who has
actually lived in America.

117
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:11,337
Schumacher here lived
in Texas for 12 years...

118
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,107
...before returning to the fatherland.

119
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:18,116
Tell me, lieutenant,
who is your favorite baseball player?

120
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,653
- Lou Gehrig.
- Because he's hit the most home runs?

121
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:25,123
No, sir. Babe Ruth hit
the most home runs, 60 in 1927.

122
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,127
And what's your opinion
of Adolf Hitler?

123
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,030
As an American, my opinion
would be offensive to these gentlemen.

124
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:38,673
Come, lieutenant. As an American officer,
you care nothing for German opinion.

125
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,276
Adolf Hitler is a crazy,
Austrian housepainter.

126
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,884
He's a madman who thinks he knows
more than the whole general's staff.

127
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,180
And he's leading Germany
to complete, total destruction.

128
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,957
Perhaps you are going too far.

129
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,326
To carry off this great deception,
even their reflexes must be American.

130
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,958
Your reflexes are to be congratulated,
lieutenant.

131
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,776
Insolent man.

132
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,678
Let him have his fun now.

133
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,679
If he is captured,
he will be shot as a spy.

134
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,148
And if he survives,
he can be shot as a traitor.

135
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,986
You must admit, we are very thorough.

136
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:41,196
Even a pass won't get you through here.

137
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:24,401
We will attack
through the Losheim Gap.

138
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,878
It's defended only by a single battalion.

139
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,576
The American division
on the Schnee Eifel will be cut off.

140
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,449
Then the Our River Bridge
will be in our hands.

141
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:38,949
From there, on to Amblève,
with its road network.

142
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:43,655
In four days, we will be across
the River Meuse.

143
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,434
The strategic objective?

144
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,126
Antwerp.

145
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,939
By taking Antwerp, we split
the enemy forces in two.

146
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,004
It will take them 18 months to recover.

147
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,674
By then, we will have air superiority
with our jet engines.

148
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:05,183
And we will have even more
significant weapons.

149
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:09,153
Weapons which can destroy
an entire city with a single blast.

150
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:13,286
You have forgotten
one important detail, general.

151
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,523
With their present control of the air,
the Allies will smash our tanks...

152
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:20,361
...machine-gun our troops,
bomb the bridges...

153
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:23,265
...and cut our communications.

154
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:28,307
Suppose I tell you there will be
no Allied planes.

155
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,040
Another secret weapon?

156
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,007
From Spitzbergen, Norway...

157
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:38,152
...the northernmost weather station
in the world.

158
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,483
We have been waiting two months
for this report.

159
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:45,992
"A low-pressure area over northern
Europe, starting December 16th.

160
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,063
Low clouds and fog
which will ground all aircraft. "

161
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,664
- How long?
- Long enough...

162
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,303
...if we keep strictly to our timetable.

163
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,699
Unusual clock, isn't it?

164
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,410
It has only one cycle.

165
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:04,943
Fifty hours.

166
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:10,212
We have the resources
for 50 hours, full-scale attack.

167
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:16,253
Maps, clocks, toys.

168
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,550
But with what will I fight?

169
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,493
Colonel Hessler...

170
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,895
...I'm putting you in command
of our armored spearhead.

171
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:09,072
It can be done.

172
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:42,274
This came in from SHAEF.

173
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,674
I got a Christmas cake
from home today.

174
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:48,009
- Think I'll still be here to eat it?
- Send this right through.

175
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:51,016
Develop this. Bring me the prints
as soon as they come out.

176
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:52,676
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Kiley.

177
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,322
Find any Germans under
your bed this morning?

178
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,688
Marching around under there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.

179
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,827
That's an order.

180
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:07,025
I want every item on that menu delivered
to every soldier in the division...

181
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,693
...especially those
in the forward positions.

182
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:13,204
And I want them delivered
in time for Christmas dinner.

183
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:17,673
Counterintelligence picked
this up from an enemy agent.

184
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,814
Dated November 29th.

185
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,041
"From Field Marshal Keitel. Most secret.

186
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:27,348
Officers and men who speak English
are wanted for special mission.

187
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:31,322
Volunteers will report
to General Kohler's headquarters. "

188
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,189
- What do you make of it?
- You know my opinion.

189
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:36,990
This is one more confirmation.
They're going to attack.

190
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,599
Oh, come on, Kiley, not that again.

191
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:44,204
They're probably preparing a fifth column
to drop behind our lines.

192
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,030
Were you
in the State Department too, Kiley?

193
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:50,235
I thought your experience
was limited to police work.

194
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:55,980
Having been an inspector of police
doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

195
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,982
All cops aren't flatfoots.

196
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,049
Your limited military experience...

197
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:03,714
...doesn't inspire confidence
in your conclusions. If you think...

198
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,861
Why do you keep saying
they're mounting an offensive?

199
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:11,926
I spent 20 years before the war
asking questions.

200
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:14,932
Ever since D-day,
you've had me doing the same thing...

201
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:17,401
...interrogating prisoners.

202
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:19,699
I can only report what I've learned.

203
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,902
The German soldier facing us
is still an undefeated enemy.

204
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,206
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.

205
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,406
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

206
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:32,209
I have 10 other officers in my section.

207
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:36,687
We see the same information,
get the same facts as you, Kiley.

208
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:40,954
All of us come up with one answer, you
come up with the complete opposite.

209
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:43,961
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
you'd better lie down.

210
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,566
Colonel Pritchard,
you may be my superior officer...

211
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,599
He is.

212
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,702
Excuse me.
Here are the prints you wanted.

213
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,306
Thank you.

214
00:24:57,712 --> 00:24:59,270
Look what showed up on this one.

215
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,940
I took it over the Ardennes.

216
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,681
Is this a Tiger tank, or isn't it?

217
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,755
So it appears.

218
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,054
One tiger doesn't make a jungle, sir.

219
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,498
I expect tigers in jungles. When I discover
one in a peaceful neighborhood...

220
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,999
...I recommend all of us
take a good look under our beds.

221
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:23,933
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:35,748
Step outside.

223
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:52,860
With your permission, sir.

224
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,138
This is from headquarters, Kiley.
Top-secret.

225
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,504
The Third Army has been ordered
to attack the Germans in the Saar.

226
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:05,976
General Patton is launching
the offensive in two days.

227
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,637
Does it seem possible...

228
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,445
...headquarters would commit an entire
army to an offensive in the south...

229
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,351
...if there were any possibility of the
Germans attacking in the Ardennes?

230
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,485
With all due respect to headquarters,
they could be wrong.

231
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:24,728
Send this to headquarters anyway.

232
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,060
There seem to be new features
on that tank.

233
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:28,566
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

234
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,466
Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown
on this German officer.

235
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:36,504
- All right, send this along.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,039
Get up to the line and tell them
to grab some new prisoners.

237
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:44,379
- I'm interested in any fresh information.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:48,010
One thing more. What are
you doing in a reconnaissance plane?

239
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,022
We're not paying you
to be a combat soldier.

240
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,218
- Trying to shorten the war by yourself?
- No, sir.

241
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:59,390
Just wanna make sure I can enjoy
that nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

242
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:13,775
I see the colonel's
in fine appetite again.

243
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:15,609
I am.

244
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,445
Join me in a glass of wine.

245
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,383
Thank you, sir.

246
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:24,257
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

247
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,135
Conrad.

248
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,465
Speak.

249
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:44,107
What does the colonel wish me to say?

250
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,474
Speak your mind, the truth.

251
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,916
Don't be afraid, Conrad. I must have
someone to tell me the truth.

252
00:27:55,357 --> 00:28:00,989
I've always been fortunate
to serve under brilliant men...

253
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,494
...who know everything.

254
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:06,600
From them, I've learned one thing:

255
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:12,104
When all was lost,
these brilliant men never lost hope.

256
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:14,935
I admire that.

257
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:19,745
What else do you admire
about these men?

258
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,976
The illusion.

259
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:27,478
Maybe I'm not using
the right word, colonel.

260
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:30,249
I'm not an educated man.

261
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:34,492
The hope that there is
always one more chance.

262
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,891
That is the illusion.

263
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,900
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

264
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:47,137
It's not my place
to speak of such things.

265
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,709
Go on.

266
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,012
I order you to.

267
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,611
Colonel...

268
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:02,952
...this new command is an illusion.

269
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,519
Give it up.

270
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,058
I am Martin Hessler.

271
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:14,563
Four years ago,
my panzers overran Poland in one week.

272
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:16,863
That was no illusion.

273
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,872
In 39 days, my tanks smashed all
the way to Paris. That was no illusion.

274
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:24,044
I conquered the Crimea.
That was no illusion.

275
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:27,906
Today...

276
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:31,483
...I was given a brigade of Tiger tanks.

277
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:34,520
When I have a brigade of tanks...

278
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,213
...that is reality.

279
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,688
And who will drive your tanks?

280
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,831
The men you led were soldiers.
Veteran soldiers.

281
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:45,829
Are there any left?

282
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,900
What will they give you now?

283
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:50,435
I was by your side
in Poland, France, Crimea.

284
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,596
Look at me, colonel,
I'm not the same man.

285
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:56,767
I jumped in a ditch today at the sight
of an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

286
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:59,503
My two boys remember me
as a good soldier.

287
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,376
They wouldn't believe it.

288
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,178
But, colonel, I am not the only one.

289
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:10,017
How sure can you be of the men
who will drive your tanks?

290
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,399
Major Diepel?

291
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,040
- Diepel.
<i>- Yep. </i>

292
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,572
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assembled at once.

293
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,012
Conrad, my boots.

294
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,026
Your commanders, sir.

295
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:11,580
Boys. Too many boys.

296
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,313
The first battle will turn them into men.

297
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,856
In the old days,
I lived six months with my men...

298
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:22,120
...before going into action. I knew them,
they knew me. These are strangers.

299
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,787
Too many boys.

300
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,762
They have never tasted defeat.

301
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,698
Do they know what is expected of them?

302
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,998
They are ready to die for you.

303
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,768
Can you ask more?

304
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:25,951
Sing.

305
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:36,787
Louder.

306
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,310
Hold it. Hold it.

307
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,713
Hold it. Hold it.

308
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:10,188
Pull up. We got brass on our tail.
Take it...

309
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,326
Pull it forward, you idiot!

310
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,560
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!

311
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,393
Just a little bit. Hold it.

312
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:24,264
Hold it! Hold it!

313
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:26,429
You're dropping my merchandise!

314
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:28,768
Barrel and Eddie,
come on out of there.

315
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:31,070
Come on, Cortland.

316
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,849
Disaster.

317
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:40,653
Solid. Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

318
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:43,483
- Complain to my union.
- Yeah, go ahead, tie it up.

319
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,819
- We near enemy territory yet?
- Too near.

320
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:47,984
- Give me a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

321
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:50,221
Sarge, when will we see
some Germans?

322
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,831
- Barrel?
- Smoke your own.

323
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,330
Got a cigarette, Eddie?

324
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,799
- You kidding?
- You cheapskates.

325
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,632
Reach into my bag,
get me a carton of cigarettes.

326
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,637
What's with you and the Germans?

327
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:02,901
Nothing. I just ain't never seen one.

328
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,568
You know, I've never
even seen a German plane.

329
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,237
Sarge, when are we
gonna get in the action?

330
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,941
What are you, some kind of a nut?

331
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,678
What kind of replacements
they sending us, huh?

332
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:16,615
"I wanna see action. "

333
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:19,453
- What's this?
- Put that back. That's merchandise.

334
00:36:19,627 --> 00:36:22,118
Don't tell me there's women
where we're going.

335
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:25,993
- Who are you gonna give these to?
- Guffy don't give nothing.

336
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,794
- He's peddling them.
- You keep tying it up.

337
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,530
- Peddling them? To who?
- The boys in the front.

338
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:35,608
They're gonna need that in Germany.
There's lots of broads there.

339
00:36:36,644 --> 00:36:39,511
- French perfume.
- Champagne.

340
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,013
That's gonna bring me 30 bills a bottle
where we're going.

341
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,620
Because there's nothing,
nothing too good for our boys.

342
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,779
- Yeah. What's in here?
- That's the mail.

343
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,051
Are you gonna charge them
something for that too?

344
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:58,888
- No, they wouldn't sit still for that.
- Just kidding, sarge. Just kidding.

345
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:01,796
No. When you get these thoughts,
tell me anyway...

346
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,336
...because one thing I'm not
going back home again is poor.

347
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:07,872
Keep thinking, kid. Very nice.

348
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,061
Germans?

349
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,265
This is the up-front front.

350
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:51,946
Wide awake bunch of boys.

351
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,419
- Don't you people ever post a sentry?
- I'm sorry, sir. I came in for a second.

352
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,956
What's the matter?
Close the pneumonia hole.

353
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,720
- What were you born in, a barn?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

354
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,921
We didn't know it was you.

355
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,391
- Major Wolenski?
- He's over there, sir.

356
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:17,200
Hello, colonel. I wasn't expecting a visit
or I'd have had my men smarten up.

357
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,539
How are you?
Hot coffee for the colonel.

358
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,705
Come over and get warm.

359
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:24,410
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

360
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:29,284
That radio's been yakking between
Christmas carols we're all going home.

361
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:31,288
Here, sit down.

362
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:34,753
It's tough keeping discipline
when the only action...

363
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:37,090
...is sitting on your butt
to keep warm.

364
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:38,754
What are the Germans doing?

365
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:41,629
Same damn thing,
except they don't have any heat.

366
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:44,134
They gotta exercise
to keep from freezing.

367
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:47,468
Well, I got a little exercise
for your boys.

368
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,735
I wanna patrol tonight,
try to pick up some prisoners.

369
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,338
Well, there they are.

370
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:07,015
- Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.
- Come on, shut the window.

371
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:09,185
What do you wanna
do that for, sarge?

372
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,855
They're out of range. They'll
shoot back with something heavier.

373
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:17,197
It's you or them, dogface.
I need practice.

374
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,106
That's enough, sergeant.

375
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,505
If you wanna play with that popgun,
you can go outside.

376
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:28,706
What do you say I take the men out
for a field drill, lieutenant?

377
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,511
In this weather? What for?

378
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:36,713
Because they're drilling, that's why.

379
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:40,327
I'll let you know
when I want a drill, sergeant.

380
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:43,463
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

381
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,033
I'll take that sergeant.

382
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:53,401
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.

383
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:56,309
Here you are, colonel.

384
00:39:57,344 --> 00:40:01,007
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?

385
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:03,047
Just sweeten it.

386
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:38,083
You are Colonel Hessler?

387
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,742
Who are you?

388
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,411
How did you get in here?

389
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,959
General Kohler's signature is magic.

390
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,061
You will excuse us, major.

391
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,097
Before you give orders,
may I ask your rank?

392
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:54,734
Courtesan, first class.

393
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:57,462
Compliments of General Kohler.

394
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:01,300
I think we have covered
everything, colonel.

395
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:10,415
General Kohler did not tell me
you were so handsome.

396
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:14,076
What did General Kohler
tell you about me?

397
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:16,314
Nothing.

398
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:20,318
Whatever I want to know...

399
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,387
...I'll find out for myself.

400
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,090
I'm very good at that.

401
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:34,733
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

402
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:41,106
Or have you been at the front so long
you have forgotten your manners?

403
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,985
What shall we talk about?

404
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:53,592
Your wife perhaps.

405
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,593
Won't you join me?

406
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:09,604
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

407
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,268
You are not paying
much attention to me.

408
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,609
Very little has escaped my attention.

409
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:20,046
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

410
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:26,818
What he admires most about you
is your reputation with the ladies.

411
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:33,665
I regret that is the opinion
of my commanding officer.

412
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,834
I have worked very hard
to achieve a reputation as a soldier.

413
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:43,476
Do not the two go together?

414
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,670
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him, "Thank you.

415
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:49,839
I appreciate his gesture. "
And good night.

416
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,176
You can make your own way out.

417
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,177
<i>Zero minus two hours. </i>

418
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,175
<i>All units ready to attack. </i>

419
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:25,307
<i>Repeat. Zero minus two hours. </i>
<i>All units ready to attack. </i>

420
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:38,920
- Come on.
- Put them down, dummkopf.

421
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,364
Hello, Kiley.

422
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,407
I was curious to see how
you interrogate your prisoners.

423
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:53,239
My other officers may be
asking the wrong questions.

424
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:57,280
I'm afraid you won't
hear any new answers.

425
00:43:57,451 --> 00:44:02,047
Sometimes it's more important
what you see than what they say.

426
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:15,097
Could we get
a little more light in here?

427
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:17,294
How's that, sir?

428
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,485
So this is the face
of the undefeated enemy.

429
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:36,646
It looks like you've captured
a Sunday school class.

430
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:40,817
This all they have left to put in
the front lines? Where are the weapons?

431
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:42,791
Here, sir.

432
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,761
What's this?

433
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:54,364
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.

434
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,600
- Did they put up any fight?
- No, sir.

435
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,711
Just gave up.

436
00:44:58,912 --> 00:45:02,541
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.

437
00:45:02,716 --> 00:45:04,650
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

438
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:08,618
They're not even tough enough
to be classified as delinquents.

439
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,316
Go ahead and question them.
Ask if Germany's gonna win the war.

440
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:14,461
Go ahead, Kiley.

441
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:18,995
They could be plants put
in the front lines to mislead us.

442
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:22,794
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

443
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,235
Escort these prisoners to the rear
for proper interrogation.

444
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,169
Yes, sir. Move them out.

445
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:30,970
- Let's go, move it out.
- Go!

446
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:34,573
These prisoners
were carrying these rubber hoses.

447
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:37,080
Send them along,
and anything else you found.

448
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,444
Yes, sir.

449
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:46,458
Do you actually still think the Germans
are preparing a major offensive?

450
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,019
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

451
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:52,859
You mean those kids are replacements
for more seasoned troops...

452
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:56,093
...sent to the rear
to re-form for the big attack?

453
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,500
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

454
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,408
Kiley, you're crazy. Facts mean nothing
to you. Evidence means nothing.

455
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:07,069
The only thing you can see
are your own cockeyed hunches.

456
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,774
Well, that doesn't work in the Army.

457
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:14,079
I'm recommending you for transfer
to a desk in Washington.

458
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:20,685
You can tell the president
how to run the war.

459
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:30,202
Major.

460
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:46,614
You make coffee as bad as my wife.

461
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:51,655
She always told me
I'd never get along in the Army.

462
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,394
I never had it so easy
in the police force.

463
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:04,292
I've just been counting up
how many times I've been wrong.

464
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:07,065
But never this wrong.

465
00:47:08,775 --> 00:47:10,970
All the signs point
to only one thing.

466
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:14,739
Is it possible they mean
something else?

467
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:21,151
Maybe this war is beyond me
and maybe Colonel Pritchard's right.

468
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:24,154
Runner brought this from headquarters.
It's for you.

469
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,689
Open it.

470
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,202
Well, it's a picture of a Kraut colonel
and his service record.

471
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,838
I wanted that.

472
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:48,145
Well, there it is again. Panzer officer.
Fine fighting record.

473
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:51,682
Last reported in the Russian front
commanding a tank regiment.

474
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:53,615
What's he doing here?

475
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,153
I'd say that proves my point.

476
00:47:56,323 --> 00:48:02,284
Colonel Pritchard would probably say
he got fired for losing the war in Russia.

477
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,030
I don't know. What do you think?

478
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:13,362
Well, sir. I'm regular Army.
I don't get into beefs between colonels.

479
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:18,405
But I'll tell you what some
of my stir-crazy men think.

480
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:21,809
They think we got
a great opportunity here.

481
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,145
We got a chance
to wipe out Germany.

482
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,415
Just wipe it clean off the map.
Knock everything down...

483
00:48:29,623 --> 00:48:30,988
...every city...

484
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,685
...every castle, all the bridges,
all the roads. Everything.

485
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:39,696
Don't leave two stones standing
together. Just wipe the slate clean.

486
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:43,199
Turn Germany into a prairie,
then ship over a few buffalo...

487
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,395
...and let them start from scratch.

488
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:48,268
Now, what do you think
of that, colonel?

489
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:58,083
I think your men ought to wash their
socks and take a shave. It stinks in here.

490
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:38,791
- Speak English. Only English.
- Okay, lieutenant.

491
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,826
Let's get this stuff out of here.

492
00:49:59,846 --> 00:50:03,179
<i>Operation Transit</i>
<i>parachuted behind enemy lines. </i>

493
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,481
<i>Repeat. Operation Transit</i>
<i>parachuted behind enemy lines. </i>

494
00:52:21,955 --> 00:52:23,320
What the...?

495
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,583
What's that noise?

496
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:27,624
On your feet! Everybody out!

497
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:31,821
- Sounds like a thousand of them.
- Hey, Charlie, get battalion.

498
00:52:31,998 --> 00:52:34,592
- Get battalion.
- On the double! On the double!

499
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:38,437
Sergeant, haul everybody out.

500
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:42,063
- Everybody out. Come on.
- Bazooka men, report to me.

501
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:46,638
The line's dead, sir.

502
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,614
Go! Go! Go!

503
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:05,662
What's that?

504
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:09,131
"What's that?" And you wanted
to see Germans, right?

505
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:12,135
Come on! On the double!

506
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,171
On the double!

507
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:21,209
Turn them over! Turn them over!
Let's go! Let's go!

508
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:23,973
Come on,
let's get this baby moving.

509
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:29,112
<i>Colonel Hessler reports</i>
<i>panzer Tiger moving to the attack. </i>

510
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,779
<i>No enemy activity. </i>

511
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:35,018
<i>Northern front reporting</i>
<i>panzer Eisen entering Losheim Gap. </i>

512
00:53:35,195 --> 00:53:37,129
<i>No enemy opposition encountered. </i>

513
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,551
<i>Southern front reporting. </i>

514
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:10,662
<i>All elements of panzer Eisen</i>
<i>linking up at road junction 0-2.</i>

515
00:54:46,066 --> 00:54:48,125
Stay on my tail.

516
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,464
Soldier.

517
00:54:55,642 --> 00:54:57,610
Did they give you basic training?

518
00:54:57,777 --> 00:55:00,541
Here, you do it this way.

519
00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:07,780
They're green, never seen action before.
What do you expect?

520
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:20,494
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.
Nobody moves without orders.

521
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,259
Yes, sir.

522
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,298
Stay here. One more man
won't make a difference.

523
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:31,433
- I need to look inside one of those Tigers.
- All right, come on.

524
00:56:25,231 --> 00:56:29,224
Relay to Standard O-bay.
I've made contact with enemy.

525
00:56:29,402 --> 00:56:31,370
Meeting weak resistance.

526
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:36,032
Take cover! Make a stand.
Take cover! Make a stand.

527
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:38,404
Make a stand.

528
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:58,329
Load.

529
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,898
I said, load!

530
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:22,249
Tiger to Tank 104.
Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

531
00:57:22,422 --> 00:57:25,050
Get off the road at once!

532
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:30,162
There's your Tiger.

533
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:38,366
Wait a minute.

534
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,096
You're gonna need this.

535
00:57:40,273 --> 00:57:42,298
Take the greaser.

536
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:29,782
<i>Tiger to Tank 104,</i>
<i>what is your condition?</i>

537
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,491
<i>Tank 104, reply at once. </i>

538
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,855
<i>This is Colonel Hessler. </i>

539
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,228
Button up!

540
00:58:44,037 --> 00:58:45,527
Tigers at 11 o'clock.

541
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,141
Hit them hard, Eddie.

542
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:16,399
They got Blondie.

543
00:59:23,509 --> 00:59:26,478
Forget it. It's like hitting them
with tennis balls.

544
00:59:32,285 --> 00:59:34,480
Come on, let's get out of here!

545
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,356
Get down and stay down.

546
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,167
Crawl, you dummy! Crawl.

547
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,102
Lieutenant,
keep those grenades coming.

548
01:00:03,716 --> 01:00:06,344
Fall back!

549
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,383
Fall back!

550
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:21,866
Fall back!
