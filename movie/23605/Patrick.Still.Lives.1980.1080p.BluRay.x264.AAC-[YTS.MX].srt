00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,510
Nothing we can do, Dad.

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,095
We'll have to wait until someone passes by.

5
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:14,223
Stop!

6
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:17,893
Patrick!

7
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,129
I did everything possible, Dr. Herschel.

8
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,549
He'll live,

9
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,176
but in a coma.

10
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:53,054
A coma he may never come out of.

11
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:40,518
PATRICK STILL LIVES

12
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,621
It's beautiful here.

13
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,873
I don't like this place.

14
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,002
I could do without all this.

15
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,547
You were invited as well,
don't you forget that.

16
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,884
There are some appointments
even you can't miss.

17
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,728
Hello, Miss Randolph, I'm Lydia Grant.

18
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,313
Hello, Mr. Suniak.

19
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,524
Welcome to the Herschel Wellness Resort.

20
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:13,152
Mr. and Mrs. Cough have arrived as well.
I hope you'll get along.

21
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,547
During this time of the year
we don't have a lot of guests,

22
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,365
so I hope you have a nice, relaxing stay.

23
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,825
Please follow me.

24
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,498
Right this way, please.

25
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,292
The rest of the luggage will be
brought to your room.

26
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,187
You'll have to excuse us,
this is the slow season

27
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,421
and we have few guests,

28
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,256
so we have a reduced staff.

29
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,633
But I'll make sure you have
everything you need.

30
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,885
I can't wait to take a shower.

31
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,179
What a long, exhausting trip.

32
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,182
Don't you agree, Mr. Cough?

33
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:50,982
Mr. Cough, here is the suite that has been
reserved for you and your wife.

34
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,568
I hope it meets your expectations.

35
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,026
Thank you, Miss Grant.

36
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:59,073
Dr. Herschel will be happy to
welcome you in person.

37
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,242
You're welcome.

38
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,453
This way, please.

39
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,584
What's up with that guy,
is he stuck up or what?

40
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,123
Who is he?

41
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,835
Lyndon Cough is a Member of Parliament.

42
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,170
Lyndon Cough.

43
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,338
Oh sure!

44
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,841
What's someone like him doing here?

45
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,968
Doesn't he want to run for Prime Minister?

46
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,721
I'm sorry, I was never interested
in politics.

47
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,973
Mr. Suniak, this is your room.

48
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,059
Bye.

49
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,279
Here is your room, Miss Randolph.

50
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,864
The rooms are connected.

51
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,699
The door is locked, as you requested.

52
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,326
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

53
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,549
- Yes?
- Pardon me, Dr. Herschel.

54
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,686
I wanted to inform you that the
four guests have arrived at the villa,

55
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:04,430
The Coughs, Ms. Randolph, and Mr. Suniak.

56
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,074
Weren't there supposed to be five of them?

57
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,269
Yes, Mr. Davis also made reservations
for today, but he hasn't arrived yet.

58
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,774
Excuse me for a moment.

59
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,882
He just arrived this minute, Doctor.
Now everyone is here.

60
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,574
Very good, take care of everything.

61
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,737
I don't want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

62
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:44,761
Okay.

63
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,510
Good boy.

64
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,898
Sit, sit!

65
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,029
Go back to your food.

66
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:48,760
Have you just arrived, sir?

67
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,119
Yes, just this moment.

68
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,204
Ah, I understand.

69
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,333
The guest rooms are on the other side.
I'll take you there.

70
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,004
It's strange, they're so vicious.

71
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,214
That's not normal for German shepherds.

72
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,801
People believe that, but these are
the fiercest animals in the world.

73
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,637
You must know how to train them.

74
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,813
- Hello there!
- Good day.

75
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,745
Did you know that dogs are just like men?

76
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,610
They like some people and dislike others.

77
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:23,902
Makes sense.

78
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,114
Leave us alone. The boss doesn't want you
around here, Meg.

79
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,115
Go to hell.

80
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:30,909
She's nice.

81
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,880
She seems nice, but I think she's an idiot.

82
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,205
Goodbye, sir.

83
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,834
I'm sorry, you can't stay here.
You'll have to leave.

84
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,130
Okay. Okay.

85
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,202
Don't let it go over.

86
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,080
Continue just like that, Brad.

87
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:17,873
Maintain a constant pressure.

88
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,418
If there are any changes,
let me know immediately.

89
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,794
Yes, Doctor.

90
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,741
Everything is going according to plan.

91
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,870
Patrick, my dear son.

92
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,363
The girl is here.

93
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,407
- It's about time, honey.
- My name is Meg.

94
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,899
Okay, baby, whatever you want.

95
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,117
Thanks.

96
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,953
- Not bad, huh?
- Just try it.

97
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,245
Here's to us.

98
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,977
Stella, what do you think of those two?

99
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,086
Do you like them?

100
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,632
He's a mannequin, and she's a cow.

101
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,382
You don't say.

102
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:52,843
I say, my dear.

103
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:54,928
Those two hate us.

104
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,722
Calm down, Cheryl.

105
00:09:58,057 --> 00:09:59,337
I'm telling you, I'm sure of it.

106
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,643
Relax.

107
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,814
He's also a champion swimmer.

108
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:06,190
What do you think?

109
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:12,029
I'll cook him, don't worry about that.

110
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,087
Lydia!

111
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,591
What are you doing here?

112
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:14,967
But, I...

113
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,512
I told you that no one was allowed
in this area, not even you.

114
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,472
I apologize.

115
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,976
I called you on the intercom
but you didn't answer, so...

116
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,562
That's not true.
What do you want?

117
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,230
I wanted to know if

118
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,149
you had any orders for me.

119
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,401
There are no orders.
You can leave.

120
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,198
Ms. Grant...

121
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,912
Don't make any more mistakes.

122
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,789
Don't worry, Doctor. It won't happen again.

123
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:52,463
I appreciate your diligence,
but don't go overboard.

124
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,383
The fact that you are new here
shouldn't make you nervous.

125
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,028
Do we understand each other?

126
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,052
Yes, Doctor.

127
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,386
Very good.

128
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
You may go now.

129
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:09,855
What are you doing?

130
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,398
Is your brain fried?

131
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,817
I was never the smartest kid in class.

132
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:18,656
But my talents helped you get into the
House of Lords, correct?

133
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,699
I didn't disgust you back then.

134
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:24,536
You promised you would forget.
It's water under the bridge.

135
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,122
Considering that now we
find ourselves here,

136
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,751
I'd say not much water
has passed, dear Lyndon.

137
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,922
The person who wrote that letter

138
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,675
we received knows many things

139
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,220
about your political career,
and he knows a lot about me.

140
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,972
I don't want to hear it.

141
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,642
I've forgotten.

142
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,812
You should do the same.

143
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,857
Unfortunately, someone has a good memory.

144
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,987
If you want to stay clean, we'll have to
pay whatever he or she wants.

145
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,116
What I want to know is how
they found out about us,

146
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,369
and why they invited us here.

147
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,720
They could have caused a huge scandal
if they'd gone to the media.

148
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,375
I really don't understand.

149
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,794
We'll find out soon, don't worry.

150
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,797
And if it's a man we're dealing with,

151
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:22,177
which I hope is the case,
we'll get out of this pretty easily.

152
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,680
Just let me handle it.

153
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,055
Cut it out, Cheryl.

154
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,642
We don't have a choice, old friend.

155
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:30,435
Stop it.

156
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,774
I told you to cut it out.

157
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:41,113
You really are a slut.

158
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,618
You make me sick, Lyndon.

159
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,663
You're nothing but a small, small man.

160
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,083
The least you could do is
get out of my way,

161
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,669
considering I'm trying to help you out.

162
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,629
Whore.

163
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,640
Yes, yes, yes, I love you.
You're so handsome.

164
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,901
No, calm down, be quiet.

165
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,009
You really know what you're
doing with those animals.

166
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,785
It isn't hard for me to love.

167
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,039
- In general?
- Yes, in general.

168
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,359
- Would you like one?
- No, thanks.

169
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:38,962
Listen, Mr. Davis,

170
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,715
you can't stay. Get out of here.

171
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,384
Get away from this place.

172
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,854
Thanks for your concern, but I can't leave.

173
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,304
I warned you.

174
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,814
If you know something,
come on, let's hear it.

175
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,477
No, I don't know anything.
Excuse me.

176
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,618
I'd just like to mention that the
clinic's facilities for check-ups

177
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,038
are available to anyone who'd like
to take advantage of them.

178
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,001
Most of our guests gladly
undergo a preventive exam.

179
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,947
Based on the results of the exam,

180
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,589
I can prescribe the appropriate
diet for you.

181
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,134
In case of any illness,
I can supply the treatment.

182
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:30,806
Mrs. Cough and her husband shall go first,
based on their reservations.

183
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:36,645
I'll see you tomorrow morning in my office.

184
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,606
Is 10:30 good for you?

185
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,691
Well, I don't know if...

186
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,986
My wife and I are in excellent health,
Dr. Herschel.

187
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,918
We're only here for some peace and quiet.

188
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,614
As you wish.

189
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,907
So...

190
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,618
Mr. Davis, what do you say?

191
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,829
No thanks, my health is perfect.

192
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:01,670
Oh, don't look at me. The last time
I undressed in front of a doctor,

193
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,964
well, let's not talk about that.

194
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,260
Okay then, the only one left is Mr. Suniak.

195
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,055
Who, me?

196
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,267
Well, I'll think about it.

197
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,895
For now, let's not do anything.

198
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,523
As you wish.

199
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,817
I wouldn't want to be misunderstood.

200
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:28,280
I only want to provide you
a pleasant vacation.

201
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,743
Above all, your honored presence here is,
to me, a medical obligation.

202
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,535
Whatever reasons

203
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:39,583
have led you here, you may
count on our total discretion.

204
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,503
I don't need to mention the
strict confidentiality policy

205
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,397
the medical profession
is obligated to observe.

206
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,924
Please understand that I am at the disposal

207
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,343
of whoever would like to consult me

208
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,138
at any point during your stay.

209
00:16:55,265 --> 00:17:00,729
Miss Lydia Grant, my able secretary,
is at your service as well.

210
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,358
And now a toast to your health.

211
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,650
Cheers.

212
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:07,818
What was that?

213
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,278
Miss Grant,

214
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:13,408
in the future, please make sure to
check the crystalware personally.

215
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,285
Don't worry, dear.

216
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,246
There's nothing to be afraid of.

217
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,123
Unfortunately, at this moment,
we have a reduced staff,

218
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,709
and it's inevitable that there will
be some small mishaps.

219
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,045
Please rest assured that we'll

220
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,131
do everything possible to ensure that
nothing disrupts your stay.

221
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,551
Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's all.

222
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,096
Pardon me, I must check on my patients.

223
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,560
Before I forget, room service is available
twenty-four hours a day.

224
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,021
You may call anytime.

225
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:50,945
Excuse me.

226
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,042
Lyndon, let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.

227
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,878
- It's so gloomy.
- Calm down Cheryl, please.

228
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,797
Do I have to tell you again?

229
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,649
While we were eating, I noticed that...

230
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,429
Goodnight.
See you tomorrow.

231
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,721
Goodnight.

232
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:17,972
Goodnight.

233
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,444
What were you going to say?

234
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,572
That guy, Suniak or whatever his name is,

235
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,074
he's carrying a pistol under his jacket.

236
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,406
Do you think he's the one?

237
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,162
I don't know, but who would come
to a resort carrying a weapon?

238
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:41,579
That's a good point.

239
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,081
What are you going to do?

240
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,458
Maybe I'll confront him.

241
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,993
It's better to resolve this
situation once and for all.

242
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,422
Be careful.

243
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,674
That man could be dangerous.

244
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,468
Let me handle it.

245
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:55,968
No.

246
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,971
Besides, blackmailers don't kill,

247
00:18:58,805 --> 00:18:59,805
I think.

248
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,435
Let's not worry about it right now.

249
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,064
Try to get some sleep.
And lock the door, understand?

250
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,732
Better to be careful.

251
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,484
Lyndon.

252
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,030
Forget about what I told you earlier.

253
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,283
I want us to stay together.

254
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,246
It's been forever since we
slept together, Lyndon.

255
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,457
Not tonight, excuse me.

256
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,749
Maybe tomorrow.

257
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,835
Right, always tomorrow.

258
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,018
Good evening, Doctor.

259
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,062
How are my patients doing?

260
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,925
The same, they look like mummies.

261
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,524
Very well, you may leave.

262
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,151
I'll stay here for awhile.

263
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,528
Better you than me. Goodnight.

264
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,751
Lyndon, Lyndon!

265
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,587
This is impossible!

266
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,879
Calm down, ma'am.

267
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,007
Yelling doesn't help anything.

268
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,051
Try to relax.

269
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,279
- What are you screaming about?
- They've killed him!

270
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,888
It's a terrible tragedy.

271
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,180
They'll kill us all!

272
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,307
You're upset.

273
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,100
Try to calm down.

274
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,478
Meg will accompany you to your room.

275
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,207
I've given you a sedative.
In a little while you'll be asleep.

276
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,231
Lyndon!

277
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,196
Lyndon!

278
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:04,452
Miss Grant, please take care of the
paperwork for the funeral.

279
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,455
Later on, I'll write the death certificate.

280
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:11,542
Please take her to her room.

281
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,682
I'm sorry your stay began
with this awful incident.

282
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:34,983
It's clear that Mr. Cough's
death was accidental.

283
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:40,280
The actual manner in which he perished
remains unknown at the moment.

284
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,032
The autopsy will shed light on the cause.

285
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,034
Not so fast, dear Doctor.

286
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,787
Someone who dies in the
shower doesn't look like this.

287
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,914
Why don't you tell us what really happened?

288
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,752
Don't say such things!

289
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:04,137
You see, Mr. Cough suffered
from severe alcoholism.

290
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:08,933
This was told to me in confidence
by Mrs. Cough.

291
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,979
As you all surely know,

292
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:16,983
the abuse of alcohol has this effect.

293
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,113
It actually precipitates,
at the endocrine level,

294
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,576
a neoplastic process in the human body.

295
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,829
I admit that it's a rare symptom,

296
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:35,585
but it appears to be what happened
this morning to Mr. Cough.

297
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,795
However, I assure you,

298
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:44,177
ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to worry about.

299
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:49,390
However unpleasant and unusual,
this incident is now over.

300
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,811
Please go back to enjoying your vacation.

301
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,362
It's kind of scary.

302
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,574
- What?
- The pool.

303
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,035
Yeah, sure.

304
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,967
But that's not what I was thinking about.

305
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,121
It's strange though.

306
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,166
Nobody wants to take a swim, not even you.

307
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,043
Well, it's not that important to me.

308
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,420
Why are you here?

309
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,756
I could ask you the same thing,

310
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,300
but usually I prefer to wait
and see what others do.

311
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:33,012
I think we're here for
the same reason. Fear.

312
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,471
Right.

313
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,224
Like a bunch of idiots.

314
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,893
But you look like a good fellow.

315
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,061
What's bothering you?

316
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:42,804
Those aren't questions that...

317
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,314
Don't ask me that.

318
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:45,525
Don't be a child.

319
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:47,461
It'll do you good to talk about it.

320
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:48,486
Leave me alone.

321
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:50,737
You're still here.

322
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:52,990
Well, why not?

323
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,324
Let's talk about it.

324
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,578
Your curiosity is interesting.

325
00:33:58,496 --> 00:33:59,496
All right.

326
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:05,461
A few years ago, there was an accident.

327
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,880
Three people died.

328
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:12,385
It was at night and I'd been drinking,
so I fled the scene of the crime.

329
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,136
That's it?

330
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,685
I can't risk it, my father is
an important public figure.

331
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,812
That's why I came here.

332
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,557
Now that I think about it...

333
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,357
Davis, Davis...

334
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,443
By any chance is your father
the Davis of British Insurance?

335
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:32,697
Yes, so now you understand.

336
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,114
Don't think about it.

337
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,883
Why don't we go for a walk in the park?

338
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,493
No, I want to be alone.

339
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,371
Come on, it's nothing personal.

340
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,206
That's the way I am.

341
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,334
All right, let's go.

342
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,564
I want to apologize.

343
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,109
I don't mean to disturb you.

344
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,760
I want to do something for you.

345
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,449
I don't want to!

346
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,324
I don't want to!

347
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:50,978
Hello, people!

348
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,563
How's it going?

349
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,648
No, no.

350
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,235
Wait a second,
let me rephrase the question.

351
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:03,240
How's death treating you?

352
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:05,951
Quit it. You're drunk.

353
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:10,664
Is that all you have to say?

354
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:14,001
Maybe it'll be better like this.

355
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,129
Go back to your room.

356
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,501
Get your hands off me, pig.

357
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:23,219
Don't you dare touch me, you hear?

358
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:27,348
Ma'am, don't you think you could
act more appropriately?

359
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,100
Well, well.

360
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,854
The standard bearer for
morality has spoken.

361
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,364
Why don't you shut up, you ugly bitch.

362
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:46,283
You think we don't know why we're here?

363
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:50,246
A wonderful gathering of so-called "fine,
upstanding citizens."

364
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,289
All together on a phony vacation.

365
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,250
What on earth are you talking about?

366
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,378
I'm sorry sweetie, but you're a bad liar.

367
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:02,174
The letter your husband received
is identical to mine and his.

368
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,344
Everyone's letter is identical.

369
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,930
The only possible difference

370
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:12,893
is the dirty deeds that
each of us has committed.

371
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,354
He was a drug dealer.

372
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,607
I walked the streets at
night as a prostitute.

373
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,735
And what about you?
We all know that you

374
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,823
let yourself be slammed like a cow by a
bull to help your husband's career.

375
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,324
That's what you did.

376
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,076
You're no better than any of us.

377
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,036
Ugh, you whore.

378
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:32,996
That's enough!

379
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:34,747
Stop, stop!

380
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:38,335
Get away from me before
I catch syphilis from you.

381
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:41,921
No more!

382
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,508
Stop, stop already!

383
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,428
I'll kill her, I'll kill her.

384
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:49,930
Stop it!

385
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:56,853
Stop it!

386
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,397
- Let me go!
- No!

387
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,065
I told you to let me go.

388
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,400
Stop, stop!

389
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:04,361
Take your hands off me.

390
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,200
You handle this.

391
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,411
Screaming women make me nervous.

392
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:20,878
No you bastard, let me go!

393
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,170
Come with me.

394
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:32,973
Let go of me, come on...
Let go of me, I said.

395
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:35,643
Take it easy.

396
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,020
Move it.

397
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,443
Let me go.

398
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,155
Don't you dare touch me!

399
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,629
What the hell are you doing?

400
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,935
What are you doing?

401
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,862
Here it is, just what I was looking for.

402
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,699
Jesus, leave it alone!
Not that!

403
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:36,120
What are you doing, are you crazy?

404
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:42,793
Leave that bottle alone!

405
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,085
Quiet!

406
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,589
You're the crazy one.
Haven't you done enough?

407
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,759
I'm telling the truth, nothing more.

408
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:54,972
I'm tired of being the
black sheep of this group!

409
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:57,307
Why don't you think things through, Stella?

410
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,811
With a good night's sleep,
you'll feel better.

411
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,232
You could keep me company.

412
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,693
Thanks for the invite,

413
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,906
but I usually have sex with women,
not whiskey bottles.

414
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,952
You like that Cheryl, don't you?

415
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,496
Stop with the bullshit, please.

416
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,409
Bastard, I shouldn't have expected
anything different.

417
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:23,917
Asshole.

418
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:36,972
Don't you like me anymore?

419
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:53,446
Maybe.

420
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,658
The drugs turned you into a faggot.

421
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,793
You'll die alone, whore.

422
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,254
Death...

423
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:17,156
What's the matter Davis,
do you suffer from insomnia too?

424
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:21,618
I can't fall asleep in this damn place,
no matter what I do.

425
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,882
Where did you leave your
gorilla, at the zoo?

426
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:45,058
My gorilla, as you call him,
is precisely that. An animal.

427
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:49,479
A beast.

428
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:05,537
Seeing as how you hold a drink so well,

429
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:07,246
after you.

430
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,082
Thank you.

431
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,628
In all my life I have never heard
anyone say something rude

432
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,339
so stylishly.

433
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,300
Let's call it British.

434
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,761
Here's to us.

435
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:35,901
What a nice setup.

436
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,822
I think this bed is nicer than mine.

437
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:44,493
If I try, I could fall asleep right away.

438
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:49,456
Well, don't just stand there.

439
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,667
Put down your whiskey and sit by me.

440
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,650
You don't like me.

441
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,612
- Is that it?
- No.

442
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,031
Well, yes, you know what I mean.

443
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:26,660
You were a lot of fun tonight, I must say.

444
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:30,914
You left them all lying on the mat.

445
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,837
One thing I don't get is,
why did you spare me?

446
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:39,548
It's simple.

447
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:44,720
Because in the end,
you'll have to defend me.

448
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,183
Don't you think?

449
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:57,274
Don't be shy.

450
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:02,446
You know I like you.

451
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:13,498
Get off me!

452
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:17,711
No Stella, I don't like garbage.

453
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,880
Especially a gorilla's garbage.

454
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:21,798
Bastard.

455
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,051
You're a coward.

456
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:28,263
Damn you!

457
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:03,215
Listen to me, when I come back

458
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:05,008
I don't want to see you in here.

459
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,806
You're just a whore.

460
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:14,309
You little boy.

461
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,563
You wouldn't be able to
understand anything else.

462
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:21,441
If you're still here in ten minutes,
I'll kill you.

463
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,116
Sure, little boy.

464
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:36,164
I wouldn't expect you to understand
anything else.

465
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:40,919
Little boy.

466
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:53,848
Little boy...

467
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,081
I'm telling you again, you have
to get out of here.

468
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,085
You have to tell me the truth, Meg.

469
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,004
What do you know about Lyndon's death?

470
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:25,630
I don't know anything, I swear.

471
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:28,203
But strange things have been
happening around here lately.

472
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:29,545
Run while you can. Run away.

473
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:43,856
Goodbye.

474
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:58,787
Death.

475
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,994
No! No!

476
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:15,623
Help, help!

477
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,675
Why did it have to be him?

478
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:27,676
No!

479
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,550
Watch those sensors, Brad.

480
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:53,596
I've noticed some atypical oscillations.

481
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:55,264
It can't happen again.

482
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,085
Help! Help!

483
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,213
Who's there?

484
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:53,883
Who turned off the lights?

485
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:33,256
No!

486
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:34,798
No!

487
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:40,471
No! No!

488
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:45,977
Go away!

489
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:47,895
Stay back!

490
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,324
Go away!

491
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,493
Get back!

492
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:04,161
No!

493
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:09,292
Get away from me!

494
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:19,969
No! No!

495
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,168
Who's yelling?

496
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:54,921
The door won't open.

497
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:20,655
I can't explain it.

498
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:22,406
It's, it's absurd.

499
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,076
Absolutely irrational.

500
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:28,746
I could understand the tragedy
that happened to Mr. Cough,

501
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:33,417
but what happened to those poor
bastards falls outside of human logic.

502
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:37,713
The only explanation is that
they were murdered.

503
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:39,257
I don't know.

504
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:41,842
Who could have done such a thing?

505
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,970
Davis was no featherweight.

506
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:50,643
You'd need the strength of a bull
to hang him up that way.

507
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:54,313
And why on earth do those
things to Miss Randolph?

508
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:55,815
I know the reason why.

509
01:02:56,232 --> 01:02:58,335
- What are you saying, Mrs. Cough?
- I said I know why.

510
01:02:58,359 --> 01:02:59,819
She was afraid. Afraid.

511
01:03:00,111 --> 01:03:01,904
You stay away from me. Don't touch me.

512
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:04,782
Meg, please take her back to
her room immediately.

513
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,074
Yes, Professor.

514
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:10,830
I'm staying here. I'm staying here.
I'm staying here.

515
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:15,376
Dr. Herschel, I've had enough.

516
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,400
We're better off calling the police.

517
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,755
It's already been done, Mr. Suniak.

518
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:22,883
Don't worry, I just called
Inspector Mark Gutherie.

519
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,512
He'll be here soon, okay?

520
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,222
Have some patience.

521
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:32,977
In the meantime, he told me not to
allow anyone to leave.

522
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,062
I'm sorry.

523
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,153
Here I am.

524
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:19,031
For the love of God, don't scream.
I'm not going to kill you.

525
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,536
Oh yeah? So what
are you doing here?

526
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,831
I'm about to leave this graveyard,
and I won't bother looking back.

527
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:29,166
Take me with you.

528
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,709
Not a chance.

529
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,881
Please, I'm begging you.
I'll only take a dress.

530
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,004
I'll be ready in a second.

531
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:36,757
I'll do anything you want.
Get me out of here. Don't leave me.

532
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:40,511
Fine, I'll wait for you in the garage.

533
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,054
I'm driving a Buick.

534
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:43,972
If you're not there in five minutes,

535
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:45,683
I won't wait. Are we clear?

536
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:46,974
Yes!

537
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Mrs. Cough!

538
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:44,592
Cheryl?

539
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:47,554
Oh, go to hell.

540
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:14,975
Help, help!

541
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:17,978
Let me out of here!

542
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:51,053
Patrick, what's happening?

543
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,055
Why are you refusing?

544
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,682
It's not over, you have to kill again.

545
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:58,518
Come on, I need you to concentrate!

546
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:06,944
Patrick you can't have forgotten.

547
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:10,155
How could you forget?

548
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,513
Listen to me, Patrick.

549
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:36,556
Remember

550
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:38,976
that damn road.

551
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:40,686
You have to concentrate.

552
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:43,063
We waited for them to help us.

553
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:46,024
It took me three years to find that car.

554
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:52,030
There were only six people who could
have been there to throw the bottle.

555
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:54,324
From that point on, Patrick,

556
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:56,256
I searched like a madman
into their lives,

557
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:59,246
trying to dig up any dirt,
any crimes I could find.

558
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,866
And I made them come here,
to their date with destiny,

559
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:04,001
to their date with you.

560
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,004
So you could carry out justice.

561
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,423
I've lived only for this day.

562
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,634
And in a few moments, revenge will be ours.

563
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:15,929
Are you listening to me, Patrick?

564
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:17,848
Are you listening?

565
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:20,809
You must focus, my son.

566
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,236
That's it, Patrick.

567
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,488
That's the way. Keep going.

568
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:36,283
You can't stop anymore.

569
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:38,410
The only one left is Lydia,

570
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:40,579
and you can strike her this
second if you want.

571
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,457
The mental energy I helped develop in you

572
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:45,792
all these years you couldn't move.

573
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,484
Powered by those three guinea pigs.

574
01:15:47,753 --> 01:15:50,005
What a powerful force,
what a marvelous force.

575
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:51,965
You can do as you will with it!

576
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:54,718
Come on, Patrick.

577
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:56,803
You have to strike.

578
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,639
Strike, strike!

579
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,516
Kill!

580
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:30,856
What are you doing?

581
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:32,691
Why did you stop?

582
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,199
Patrick.

583
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,161
Answer me, Patrick.

584
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:46,204
Why won't you answer?

585
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,250
Okay, Patrick.

586
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:52,335
If you don't want to do it, I will.

587
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:24,117
No, Patrick, you can't stop me.

588
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,921
What the hell is going on?

589
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:27,587
Brad, go to the circuit breaker
and shut everything off.

590
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,436
No! No!

591
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:57,599
Help, help!

592
01:25:23,578 --> 01:25:24,746
No!

593
01:25:25,622 --> 01:25:26,789
No!

594
01:26:57,839 --> 01:26:59,132
No!

595
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:04,928
Help!

596
01:27:11,561 --> 01:27:12,729
No, Patrick!

597
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,020
No!

598
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:22,989
You can't do this to me!

599
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:29,454
You can't do this to me!

600
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:17,459
Help!

601
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:21,380
Help!

602
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:25,593
Open up! Someone help!

603
01:28:35,937 --> 01:28:36,937
Help!

604
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:45,446
Somebody help me!

605
01:28:46,948 --> 01:28:48,032
Help!

606
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:15,601
Help!

607
01:29:22,817 --> 01:29:23,817
Help!

608
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,486
Help!

609
01:29:29,574 --> 01:29:30,700
Help!
