I wanna let Rocky out, then I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

126
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,560
你干吗没打断他的手指?
How come you didn't break this guy's thumb like I told you?

When you don't do what I tell you to do, you make me look bad, Rock.

131
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,630
我想...如果打断了他手指
I figured...look, I figured if I break the guy's thumb,

132
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,640
他没工开  就不能赚钱...
he gets laid off, right? Then he can't make...

133
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,870
这些事不用你伤脑筋...
Don't figure...let me do the figurin', okay, Rock?

134
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,440
由现在开始  你不要想这些
From here on in, just let me do the figurin', you know?

135
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,110
这些人以为我们搞慈善
These guys think that we're runnin' some kind of charity or somethin'.

136
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,670
以为不会受罚
That they can get off light.

137
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,150
总之从今日起  照我说话做
From here on in, do what I tell you to do

138
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,950
不然我名誉会受损  你明白吗?
because it's bad for my reputation, you understand?

139
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,860
明白没...洛奇?
You got... You got it, Rock?

140
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,850
明白
I got it.

141
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,630
度里奥   怎样写?
Hey, how do you spell Del Rio?

142
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,690
-自己查字典吧!   -不要这样
-Open a dictionary, Rock!  -Come on!

143
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,600
以后我会照你意思  关于手指的事
Hey, I won't let that happen no more...about the thumb.

144
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,830
你知道吗?
You know?

145
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,940
再见  肉球
So long, meatbag.

146
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,950
我应该打断你手指
I should've broke your thumbs!

147
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,880
洛奇  听说你昨晚打得很好
Hey, Rock, heard you did real good last night.

148
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,440
绝对是  你应该来看

149
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,250
你不用休息吗?
Don't you think you oughta take a rest?

150
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,980
-不  我背脊受了伤  -背脊?
-No, my back is hurtin'.  -Your back?

151
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,950
我背脊受了伤  你聋了吗?
My back is hurtin'. You deaf?

152
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,490

喂  迈克

where's my lock? Whose stuff is this in my locker?

155
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,020
是迪柏的东西  这已不是你的储物柜
It's Dipper's stuff. It ain't your locker no more.

156
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,090
什么意思?
What you talkin' 'bout, it ain't my locker?

157
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,760
我用了这柜六年  我的衣服呢?
It's been my locker for six years. Where's my gear?

158
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,170
米克叫我装好挂起
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

159
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,910
你把我的东西放到徙置区
You put my stuff on skid row.

160
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,310
那储物柜我用了六年了

161
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,440
你居然把我的东西放到徙置区?

162
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,110
米克吩咐的  我只是照做
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it, right, Rock?

163
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,590
他在哪里?
Where is he?

164
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,380
他在教迪柏练拳
He's outside working with Dipper.

165
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,880
-他心情不好  -我也是
-He's in a bad mood.  -So am I.

166

双手抬高  双手抬高  留意右面
Get your hands up there. Keep your hands up. That's right.

167
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,070
-嘿  米克  -闭嘴!

170
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
你想怎样?

与你无关...你有什么问题?
Never mind my problem...what's your problem?

175
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,820
迈克跟我说了
My problem is I've been talking to your man Michael.

176
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,060
干吗拿走我的储物柜?
I wanna know how come I've been put out of my locker.

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,030
他是奋斗型  你呢?
He's a climber. You know what you are?

179
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,470
-什么?  -你是番茄

180
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,870
-番茄?  -是的  面对它吧
-A tomato?  -Yeah, let's face it.

181
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,770
我这里是做生意的  不是慈善饭堂
I run a business here, not a goddamn soup kitchen.

182
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,170

I had that locker for about six years, but it don't bother me none.

210

储物柜用久了也不好
Lockers are bad, anyway.

211
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,590
他们知道你的密码
After a while, people get the combination.

212
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,360
过去六年我一定被人偷了20元
I must've had 20 bucks taken out of there in the past six years.

213
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,060
听来不是很多钱  但小数怕长计
It don't sound like much, but it adds up, you know.

214
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,260
算了吧  谁在乎?

Don't any of you guys get up.

230
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,410
整天在笼里很辛苦吧
I know you had a hard day in the cage.

231
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,810
那...我回家想个新笑话

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,190
是否要有靓车她才会睬我?
What...I need a Cadillac to connect with your sister?

262
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,190
还是我样子有问题?
Something wrong with my face? You know what I mean?

263
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,100
她是个废物
She's a freakin' loser.

264
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,500
有时她令我发狂到想用剃刀劈开她的头
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I could split her head with a razor.

265
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,240
不要发癫了
Don't get mental, man, you know.

266
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,270
-你遇着我心情差  -你永远心情差
-Well, you caught me in a bad mood. -You're always in a bad mood.

267
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,110
艾莉好蠢  艾莉是个白痴
Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian is a loser.

268
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,610
-嘿  -都奔30岁的人了
-Hey. -She's pushin' 30 freakin' years old.

269
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,280
她再不上心  就会孤独老死
And if she don't watch out, she's gonna end up dying alone.

270
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,850
-我自己都30岁  -你也会孤独老死
-I'm 30 myself.  -Then you're gonna end up dying alone.

271
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,080
你也不见得会有人陪
Hey, I don't need see no crowd around you, neither.

272
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,290
我要杀了那打烂镜子的白痴
I'd like to kill the freakin' moron who broke the mirror.

273
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,020
来  我们离开这臭地方
Come on, let's get out of this stink, would you? Come on.

274
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,800
-好  横竖我要跟你谈谈  -关于什么?
-I wanna talk to you anyway.  -About what?

275
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,200
-你还有帮加索做事吗?  -有
-You still work for Gazzo?  -Yeah, sure.

276
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,930
你可否向加索推荐我?
Why don't you talk to him about me?

277
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,810
但加索现在不请人
Well, I just don't think Gazzo's hirin' right now, you know? You know?

278
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,840
来吧
Come on.

279
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,940
-她越来越萎缩  -谁?
-The girl's dryin' up.  -Who?

280
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,680
我妹妹  她再不开始生活 身体就会萎缩掉
My sister. If she don't start livin', her body's gonna dry up.

281
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,990
明天是感恩节  知道吗?
You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving, you know that?

282
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,890
为什么不过来跟她倾诉?
Why don't you come over and talk to her?

283
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,360
好的  啤酒
Sure. Beer.

284
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,420
明天你来吃火鸡  好吗?
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?

285
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,260
当然好  我会来
Absolutely. You got it.

286
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,300
我要走了  我只要迟十分钟  她就去问医院
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late, she calls the hospital.

287
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,060
-保利!  -我来
-Paulie!  -I got it. I got it.

288
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,640
...200周年纪念赛对麦克·李·格林在费城的
Bicentennial fight with Mac Lee Green here in Philadelphia

289
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,580
费城球场  拉里?
at the fabulous Spectrum. Harry?

290
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,130
这是备受瞩目的200周年纪念赛
We're speaking now of your much publicized bicentennial fight.

291
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,370
对  这将是。。。
That's right, this is gonna be

292
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,280
本国史上最大的体坛盛事
the greatest sporting event in the country's history.

293
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,510
在这庆典里 我会当格林是罪犯般击败
A gala occurrence with me beating Green like he committed a crime.

294
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,250
你看那人?
Would you take a look at that guy?

295
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,810
真正的拳手从哪里来的?
I mean, where are the real fighters gonna come from?

296
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,880
那些专业的  现在只有那些黑人小丑
The pros. All we got today are jig clowns.

297
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,230
在1月1日  本国最大盛事...
On January 1st, the first major event in the country...

298
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,460
-小丑?  -对  小丑
-Clowns?  -That's right. Clowns.

299
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,190
像史上所有大型赛事
And in keeping with great events throughout the country's history.

300
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,860
阿波罗·奎迪会
Apollo Creed will duplicate the cracking of the liberty bell

301
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,270
击碎格林
by cracking Mac Lee Green.

302
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,830
你说阿波罗·奎迪是小丑?
You callin' Apollo Creed a clown?

303
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,970
当然啦  看他
Well, what else? Look at him.

304
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,380
努力求学  认真思考
Stay in school and use your brain.

305
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,380
做医生  律师  拿皮制公事包
Be a doctor, be a lawyer, carry a leather briefcase.

306
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,280
不要做专业运动员
Forget about sports as a profession.

307
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,010
运动令你发牢骚和发臭
Sports make you grunt and smell.

308
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,540
-要食脑  不要食屎  -谢谢你  拳王
-See, be a thinker, not a stinker. -Okay, thanks a lot, Champ.

309
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,220
你傻了?  他是世界拳王
Hey, are you crazy? This man is champion of the world.

310
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,350
他努力打出最佳水准才成为拳王
He took his best shot and became champ. Huh?

311
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,260
你努力过什么?
What shot did you ever take?

312
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,820
洛奇 你不满意自己的生活  是你的事
Hey, Rocky, you're not happy with your life, it's nice.

313
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,000
但我有盘生意  不用去努力
But me, I got a business going. I don't have to take no shots.

314
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,800
他没一个对手能捱过...
No one having gone more than...

315
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,830
对了
That's right.

316
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,670
给你的生意
Stick that up your business.

317
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,610
你干吗那样恼?
What are you so insulted about?

318
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,840
你想我努力?  好...我努力喝一杯
Want me to take a shot? All right... I'll take a shot.

319
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,330
洛奇  最近怎样?
Rocky, how's it been going?

320
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,890
嗨  洛奇  来一瓶?
Hey, Rocky, how 'bout a bottle?

321
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,300
-不喝了  -来吧  就一点.
-No wine.  -Come on. Just a little.

322
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,500
玛丽  你哥哥知道你在外面逛这么晚吗?
Marie, does your brother know you're hanging out so late?

323
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,770
-去你的!  -她哥哥知道的 
-Screw you, Go-go.  -Her brother knows.

324
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,000
这些家伙就这样教你说话?
Hey, these guys teach you to talk like that?

325
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,510
-吃狗屎吧!  -不许这样跟我说话
-Stuff it, man!  -Never say that! Come here!

326
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,140
你把附近都搞臭了!
You stink up the neighborhood!

327
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,580
-你知道你可以...  -嘿!
-You know, you can... -Hey!

328
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,920
我像你这么大时
When I was your age,

329
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,320
附近只有一个女孩说脏话
there was only one girl in the whole neighborhood talked like that.

330
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,250
是的  就只有她一个  你在干嘛?
That was it. Just one. What are you doing?

331
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,460
抽烟牙齿会变黄  别抽
It'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.

332
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,810
-我喜欢黄板牙!  -它还会让你口臭得像垃圾
-I like yellow teeth.  -It'll make your breath like garbage.

333
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,430
-兴许我喜欢垃圾  -别这样  没人喜欢垃圾
-Maybe I like garbage. -Come on, nobody likes garbage.

334
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,990
不过这个满嘴脏话的女孩长得还不赖
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...she wasn't bad-lookin',

335
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,560
可是没有男生瞧得起她
but, you see, none of the guys ever took her seriously, see.

336
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,580
他们从不约她出去
They never took her out for any serious datin'.

337
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,130
-为什么?  -因为男生就是这样的
-Why?  -'Cause that's the way guys are.

338
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,270
你说粗话时他们会笑 他们觉得你很可爱
They laugh when you talk dirty, they think you're cute,

339
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,340
过不多久  你就名声在外了
but after a while, you get a reputation, that's it.

340
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,910
没人会尊重你  明白吗?
You get no respect, you understand?

341
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,650
没人尊重你  我要用一个坏字眼
You get no respect. And I gotta use a bad word.

342
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,210
婊子  婊子  明白吗?
Whore. You understand? Whore.

343
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,950
明白吗?  说粗话的下场
See, you use dirty words

344
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,550
就是可能沦为婊子
and maybe you end up becoming a whore, you understand?

345
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,290
拜托  洛奇  我已十二岁了
Come on, Rocky. I'm just 12.

346
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,860
这与你十二岁没有关系
Hey, that don't matter that you're 12. It don't matter.

347
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,990
你不一定真的要当婊子 行为举止像就完了
You don't really have to be one. You just act like one...that's it. Boom.

348
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,010
你就会臭名远播  懂不懂?
Hey, if you get a bad rap, you understand?

349
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,230
二十年后人们会说...
Twenty years from now, people are gonna say,

350
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,200
你还记得玛丽吗?
"Hey, you remember Marie?"

351
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,610
不  她是谁?
"No, who's she?"

352
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,240
就是那个在街角鬼混的小婊子
"She's the little whore that hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

353
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,980
噢  我现在想起来了
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, now I remember her."

354
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,320
看见了吧  人们不会记得你 只会记得你的名声
You see, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.

355
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,720
明白了吧?
You understand?

356
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,790
有男朋友吗?
Hey, you got a boyfriend?

357
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,690
不  你找不到男朋友
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

358
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,420
知道为什么?  你可曾想过没有男朋友的原因?
You know why? Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?

359
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,300
因为你和这些街上的痞子鬼混
'Cause you're hangin' out with them coconuts in the corner, understand?

360
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,100
和街上的痞子鬼混没有前途
You hang around coconuts, you get nowhere.

361
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,000
他们一无是处
They're lemons. Lemons.

362
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,230
与好人交往就会有好的朋友
You hang out with nice people, you get nice friends, you understand?

363
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,800
与聪明人交往就会有聪明的朋友
You hang out with smart people, you get smart friends.

364
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,280
与混混交往就会有混混的朋友
You hang out with yo-yo people, you get yo-yo friends.

365
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,510
这个道理很简单
You see? It's simple mathematics.

366
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,110
-我希望你不会...  -我不会的
-I hope you ain't...  -I won't.

367
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,340
我说的重点是什么?
What was I gonna say?

368
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,580
你希望我不要学婊子的样子 否则我就会成为婊子 是吧?
You hope I don't keep acting like a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?

369
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,790
-是的  就是这样  -晚安  洛奇
-Yeah, something like that. -Good night, Rocky.

370
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,260
晚安  保重
Good night, Marie. Take care, you know?

371
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,130
嗨  洛奇  去你的  鬼样!
Hey, Rocky? Yo. Screw you, creep-o!

372
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,600
对  你凭什么给人忠告 你只是个鬼样
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep-o? Huh?

373
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,830
你以为你是谁?
Who are you?

374
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,830
-医生确诊了?  -确诊了
-Are the doctor's reports confirmed?  -Definitely.

375
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,730
上面说麦克·李·格林
It says here Mac Lee Green has suffered

376
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,130
左掌第三根骨头严重骨折
a severely cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.

377
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,860
该死
Damn.

378
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,200
我们可以无限期延后日期
Of course, we can cancel the fight indefinitely

379
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,860
如果你坚持要与他比赛
if you're set on fighting Green.

380
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,270
这不只是格林的问题
Hey, it ain't just Green!

381
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,500
阿波罗投入的时间呢?
What about all the time Apollo has invested?

382
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,550
我们能找出解决之道
I believe we can find a solution.

383
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,920
解决个屁   你最好尽快再找个旗鼓相当的人
Solution nothin'. You better find me another ranked contender.

384
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,540
我的意思是太戏剧化  休根斯
And I mean in a flash, Jergens.

385
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,280
别跟我的客户耍花样
Don't play games with my client.

386
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,820
阿波罗已花了一百万宣传费
Apollo's already done a million dollars worth of publicity,

387
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,880
并且有履行这个牵涉到 20个不同组织的合约的义务
has made contractual obligations with 20 different organizations...

388
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,450
他绝不能丢脸!
he's not going to be embarrassed!

389
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,290
我联络厄尼·罗曼的经纪人
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

390
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,350
他同一周在法国比赛
Ernie's fighting in France that same week.

391
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,730
那就找巴帝·萧  他排名第五
Then get me Buddy Shaw! Hell, he's ranked fifth!

392
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,830
搬到加州去了   而且胖了50磅
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.

393
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,740
我找遍了所有可能的对手
I get a hold of every worthwhile contender

394
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,400
他们都说
and they all say the same thing...

395
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,140
五周时间不够他们准备
five weeks just isn't enough time to get into shape.

396
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,540
准备个屁!  是他们怕了
Shape nothin', man! They're afraid.

397
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,600
他们知道全世界会看到这场拳赛
They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight,

398
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,510
没有一个人能击败我
and none of them's got a prayer of whippin' me.

399
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,680
所以找借口避免被我修理
They're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump

400
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,690
怕在全世界观众面前丢脸
to get whipped in front of the whole civilized world.

401
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,750
我只能说我是个好的主办者
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

402
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,850
我在世界各国主办无数拳赛
I've promoted fights in every goddamn country in the world,

403
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,390
我却在这场拳赛阴沟里翻船
and I've broken my ass over this one.

404
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,730
我已黔驴技穷!
But I don't know what the hell else to do!

405
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,230
我有办法
I do.

406
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,770
既然没有排名内的选手
Without a ranked contender,

407
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,500
这场比赛就需要些创新
what this fight is gonna need is a novelty.

408
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,170
这是个充满机会的地方  对吧?
This is the land of opportunity, right?

409
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,170
所以阿波罗·奎迪在元旦当天...
So Apollo Creed, on January 1st,

410
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,980
给当地毫无胜算的人一个机会
gives a local underdog fighter an opportunity.

411
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,390
一个名不见经传的小子
A snow-white underdog,

412
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,290
我要他的照片跟我一起登上海报
and I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me.

413
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,190
我告诉你们为什么
And I'll tell you why.

414
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,920
因为我多愁善感
Because I'm sentimental.

415
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,330
这个国家有许许多多多愁善感的人
And a lot of other people in this country are just as sentimental,

416
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,230
没有比在这个世界上最重大的节日里
and there's nothing they'd like better than to see Apollo Creed

417
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,790
看到阿波罗·奎迪让当地男孩有机会出赛
give a local Philadelphia boy

418
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,930
而在最大盛事时更让他们高兴的事
a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday.

419
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,840
这就是我的看法
Now, that's the way I see it.

420
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,500
而且赛事就要如此进行
And that's the way it's gonna be.

421
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,740
阿波罗  我喜欢
Apollo, I like it.

422
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,340
很有有美国味
It's very American.

423
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,080
不 休根斯
No, Jergens.

424
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,810
是非常聪明
It's very smart.

425
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,430
好的  晚些时候见
Okay, I'll see you later, man.

426
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,140
-怎么了?  -我只是要确认一下
-What? What is it?  -I just wanna check this thing out.

427
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,680
你说向史奈德收二百
Now, you said pick up two yards from Snyder

428
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,240
卡波里收一千
and a grand from Cappoli, right?

429
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,150
不对  卡波里收二百 史奈德收一千
No, no. No, no. Two yards from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.

430
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,050
-两百  -记下来  好吗?
-Two yards. Two yards.  -Write it down, okay?

431
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,610
好  我记下来了
Yeah, I got it. Got it.

432
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,090
明晚和你约会的女孩是谁?
Who's this girl you're going out with tomorrow night?

433
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,590
你怎么知道?
How'd you know?

434
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,720
你以为我不知道吗?  我有很多消息来源
You know.Don't you think I hear things?A lot of canaries flying around the docks.

435
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,200
-我要和保利的妹妹出去  -嗨  洛奇
-I'm going out with Paulie's sister.  -Hey, Rocky.

436
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,470
-嗯?  -听说她是弱智
-What? -I hear she's retarded.

437
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,530
她不是弱智  只是害羞而已
She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

438
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,100
告诉你怎么做
I'll tell you what to do.

439
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,370
带她去动物园  听说弱智喜欢动物园
Take her to the zoo. I hear retards like the zoo.

440
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,270
-你这无赖一定要这么说话吗?  -你说谁呢?
-This bum gotta say that?  -Who're you calling a bum?

441
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,270
-靠后点  我说你是无赖!  -别激动
-I'm calling you a bum!  -Okay, relax. Relax.

442
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,240
他心情不好 前列腺有毛病
Buddy's in a bad mood. It's his prostate.

443
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,740
他老是心情不好
He's always in a bad mood.

444
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,650
你应该多积点口德
You know, you oughta count your blessings, Buddy.

445
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,520
趁你现在还很健康
You're still a healthy person, you know that?

446

-他不喜欢你  -是的
-Buddy doesn't like you.  -Yeah.

451
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,300

Hey, Bobby Judd. He's a good boy.

466
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,850
不  那名字太无瘾
No, I don't feel any heat from that name.

467
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,470
可以考虑祖·萨克
Joe Zach's a good prospect.

468
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,320
阿波罗  到底你要找怎样的?
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?

469
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,990
这就是我要找的

470
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,990
意大利牡马
The Italian Stallion.

471
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,390
洛奇·巴尔博亚?  没听过这个人
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

472
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,100
是那名字
Look, it's the name, man.

473
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,780
意大利牡马  传媒一定喜欢
The Italian Stallion. The media will eat it up.

474
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,270
是谁发现美国?  意大利人  对吗?
Now, who discovered America? An Italian, right?

475
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,670
有什么好得过跟他的后人比赛?
What would be better than to get it on with one of his descendents?

476
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,050
他是个左撇子
He's a southpaw.

477
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,850
我不想你浪费时间跟左撇子打
I don't want you messing around with southpaws.

478
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,440
-他们做什么都反转  -左撇子没问题
-They do everything backwards.  -Southpaw nothin'.

479
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,920
我三个回合可打败他
I'll drop him in three.

480
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,920
阿波罗·奎迪对意大利牡马
Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.

481
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
听上去好像一套怪兽电影
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

482
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,140
你拿着球棒干什么?
Hey, what are you doing with that bat, huh?

483
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,870
我以前打棒球好劲  你妹妹知道我会来?
I used to be deadly at stickball. You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?

484
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,260

486
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,830
把肉从冰柜搬进搬出
The joints from walkin' and carryin' meat in and out of freezers.

487
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,240
弄坏了关节
It plays hell on the joints.

488
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,470
你应该去看医生
Maybe you oughta see a doctor. What do you think?

489
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,060
我不需要看医生  我需要转工
I don't need a doctor. I need a different job.

490
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,560
转工  是怎样的火鸡?  大还是小?
Different job. What kind of turkey? Big turkey or small turkey?

491
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,030
跟加索谈谈  说我人品不错
Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.

492
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,420
我什么都做  我会好好的收帐  打断人骨头没问题
I'd make a great collector. Bustin' bones don't bother me.

493
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,920
不想烦你  是大火鸡吧?
Don't bother you. A big turkey, right? Huh?

494
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,800
-加索会给我...  -忘记加索  那份工不好做
-Gazzo's gotta come...  -forget Gazzo. It's a bad job, you know what I mean?

495
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,800
-你有火柴吗?  -替我找他  当帮我
-You got a match?  -Go to him for me. As a favor.

496
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,490
是  上次我吃火鸡
Yeah. Yeah. You know, the last time I had a turkey

497
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,230
是做两元特价时
was when they were having a $2 special

498
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,240
三年前在康哈达自助餐厅
at Horn and Hardog's about three years ago.

499
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,970
去年  我和龟仔们吃了午餐肉
Last year me and the turtles had spam. What do you think?

500
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,140
是的  听起来是个好主意
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

501
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,780
你妹妹真的知道我来?
Your sister knows I'm coming for sure, right?

502
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,080
知道  她很高兴
Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

503
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,290
我一直很孤单
I'm all alone

504
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,520
你忘记加索好吗?
Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?

505
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,920
-我很少求人两次  -很少求人两次
-I don't ask nobody twice. -I don't ask nobody twice.

506
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,060
走开
Stay away, baby

507
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,400
你肯定你妹妹知道我来?
Hey, your sister...you sure your sister knows I'm comin'?

保利?  你迟了回来
Paulie? You're late.

你打去医院了?  我迟十分钟她就会打去医院
Called the hospital? She calls the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.

512
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
你好吗?
How you doin'?

513
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,890
一早说了  她很高兴
I told you she's very excited.

514
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,050
你为什么不告诉我他会来?
Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him here?

515
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,720
我无心理准备
Look at me. I'm not ready for this.

516
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,090
你有准备又有什么分别?
Would it make a difference if you were?

517
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,090
他会带你出去
He's a friend, and now he's taking you out.

518
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,500
不  我不会去
No, I can't.

519
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,760
我要你立即离开厨房
You're in the kitchen, and I want you out right now.

520
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,550
你立即出来
Hey, I want you outta here instamatically!

521
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,880
我厌倦了看着你像蜘蛛般孵在屋里
I'm sick of seein' you hanging around like a freakin' spider!

522
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,680
快出去  享受生命
Go out! Live! Enjoy life!

523
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,240
我不能去
Paulie, I can't go!

524
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,310
你不要在我面前扮高贵
Don't get wise with me, now, huh?

525
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,920
-我受够了你那么无用  -不要说我无用  保利
-I'm tired of you being a loser. -Don't call me that, Paulie!

526
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,290
阿波罗·奎迪说他会找另一个牺牲者
Apollo Creed says he'll be shopping for another victim

527
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,060
在200周年纪念冠军赛里 填补格林的空缺...
to fill Green's vacancy for the bicentennial championship fight.

528
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,970
你干吗不告诉我他会来?
Why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?

529
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,030
-你怎知我没说?  -我不能去
-How do you know I didn't? -I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!

530
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,200
-我不会去!  -为什么?
-I won't go!  -Why?!

531
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,880
今天是感恩节  我焗了火鸡
Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'. I got a turkey in the oven.

532
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,050
噢  焗了火鸡
Oh. A turkey in the oven?

533
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,910
焗了火鸡
A turkey in the oven.

534
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,560
你想吃火鸡?
You want the bird?

535
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,290
去后巷吃吧
Go in the alley and eat the bird.

536
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,340
噢  保利
Oh, Paulie.

537
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,810
我要你出去 离开这间屋
I want you outta here! Get outta the house!

538
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,940
出去好好享受生命
Go out and enjoy your freakin' life!

539
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,780
洛奇  你肚饿吗?
You hungry, Rock?

540
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,990
保利  今天不如算了吧?
Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just better forget all this, you know?

541
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,050
-算了吧   -算个屁 
-Just forget it. -Forget nothin'.

542
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,620
去  跟她说笑话
Go ahead. Tell her somethin' funny.

543
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,610
没什么好说的  她心情不好 我又心情不好
Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.

544
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,830
你可以搞笑的 你不是想跟她约会吗?
You know how to do funny. You wanna go out with my sister?

545
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,960
-是的  -那就加油啊...
-Yeah.  -Well... come on.

546
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,560
-我不知说什么好  -要搞笑
-I don't know what to say.  -Funny

547
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,620
艾莉  是我  洛奇
Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.

548
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,090
洛奇  知吗?
Rocky, you know?

549
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,430
听着
Listen, uh...

550
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,600
我不知说什么好
I don't know what to say,

551
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,400
因为我未试过跟门说话
'cause I ain't never talked to no door before, you know?

552
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,070
我应该跟道门说什么?  嘿  听着...
I mean, what do I say to a door... hey, listen...

553
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,870
你做得很好
Come on. You're doin' fine.

554
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,890
我做得不好  我似个白痴
I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot.

555
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,400
继续啦  搞笑
Keep doin' what you're doin'. You're funny.

556
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,470
这方面我最在行
I know all about these things.

557
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,950
我像个傻佬
I feel like a jerk.

558
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,540
艾莉  又是我  洛奇
Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again, you know?

559
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:28,090
我知你现在不开心
Listen, uh... I know you ain't too happy at this moment, you know,

560
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,760
但可否帮我一个忙?
but could you do me a favor?

561
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,830
没人陪我过感恩节
I ain't got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with, you know?

562
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,560
不如
So, uh...

563
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,230
你跟我一起出去吃顿饭
how 'bout maybe you and I maybe go out together, get something to eat.

564
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,530
我不知道  或者笑笑  知道吗?
I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit. Who knows, you know?

565
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,600
你会否想...
Would you like to, uh...

566
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,040
你会否想跟我出去?
I don't know. Would you like to maybe, you know, you and me go out together?

567
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,610
怎样?  好吗?
What do you think? Would you like to?

568
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,580
我们会玩得很开心的
We're gonna have a good time.

569
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,530
会玩得很开心的
We'll have a real good time.

570
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,830
谢谢你的火鸡
Thanks for the bird.

571
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,370
我要关掉电视  头痛死了
I'm gonna turn the TV off. I got a headache.

572
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,120
-你妹妹喜欢做什么?  -溜冰
-What does your sister like to do?  -Ice skate.

573
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,220
艾莉  来吧  暖气都走了
Adrian, come on. You're lettin' the heat out.

574
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,520
还不是我付的帐单?
Who pays the bills around here?

575
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,160
反正我不想吃火鸡
Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway, you know?

576
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,930
但今天是感恩节
But it was Thanksgiving.

577
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,940
-什么?  -感恩节
-It was what?  -It was Thanksgiving.

578
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,180
是  对你来说  但对我来说是星期四
Yeah, to you. But to me it's Thursday.

579
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,310
-很静呢  -好像关门了
-It looks kinda quiet, you know?  -I think it's closed.

580
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,500
不  大概是我们太早
No, I think maybe we're just early or something like that.

581
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,020
-我们关门了  -什么?
-We're closed. -What?

582
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,940
我们休息 
I said we're closed.

583
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,010
听着  我去跟他谈妥
Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna smooth this guy out here.

584
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,010
你等等 我很快回来 好吗?
So just wait here for a few minutes. I'll be right back, okay?

585
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,920
-我们可以去别处  -不  没问题
-We could go someplace else.  -No, it's okay.

586
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,920
你是不开放给公众
Hey, listen, are you closed to the general public,

587
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,990
还是不开放给所有人...你知道我的意思? 
or are you closed to everybody...you know what I mean?

588
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:41,390
已过了6点  今天是感恩节 所以没人来
Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving. That's why there's nobody here.

589
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,520
况且  你不应该进来
And besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.

590
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,930
所以麻烦你出去
So do me a favor and not stay here, huh?

591
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,550
-你可否帮个忙? -不要这样  我们现在不开门
-Would you do me a favor? -Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.

592
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,740
这位小姐有病在身
Look...this girl here ain't feelin' well, you know.

593
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,370
医生说她要多做运动
The doctors say she should go out and exercise once in a while,

594
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,610
溜冰是最佳选择
and ice skating's probably the best thing, know what I mean?

595
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,660
那你想怎样?
So what do you want from me?

596
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,380
我想你帮忙  你都看见她有病
I want you to do me a favor. You could see she ain't feelin' too good.

597
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,580
如果你让她溜几分钟  我会很感激
If you could let her on the ice, I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.

598
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,490
十分钟  十元
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

599
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,820
十元?  八元可以吗?
Ten bucks? How 'bout eight... eight bucks?

600
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,230
不要讲价  感恩节嘛
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

601
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,660
-好吧  九元  一口价  -十元  整个场任你玩
-All right, nine bucks, you got a deal. -You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

602
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,530
拿溜冰鞋给她
Give her the blades.

603
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,900
你不溜冰吗?
Aren't you skating?

604
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,960
我15岁开始便没溜过冰
Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.

605
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,370
那时我开始打拳
That's when I started fightin'...when I was 15.

606
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,780
溜冰会令足踝受损
Skating's kinda bad for the ankles, you know?

607
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,980
你很会溜冰  是吗?
You're a pretty good skater, are you?

608
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,030
正如我刚才说
You know, like I was saying before on the way over here.

609
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,560
以前我把打拳放在首位  但不再是
Fightin' used to be tops with me, but no more, you know?

610
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,290
我只想用打拳来证明我不是废柴
All I wanted to do at a fight was prove I was no bum...

611
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,730
我有本事做出色的专业拳手
that I had the stuff to make a good pro, you know?

612
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,130
你一直没有机会?
You never got the chance?

613
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,030
我没抱怨  我依然打拳  当它是嗜好
Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause I still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.

614
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,370
问题是我是 南泽西
I tell you what the trouble is...I'm a southpaw.

615
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,100
-什么是南泽西?  -即是左撇子
-What's a southpaw?  -A southpaw means you're left-handed.

616
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,660
南泽西较难掌握时间
And a southpaw throws your timing off, you see.

617
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,070
令对手也掌握不到时间 看上去很笨拙
Other guys it throws their timing off, makes them look awkward.

618
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,870
没人想让人觉得笨拙
Nobody wants to look awkward.

619
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,810
-你知道南泽西的来由吗?  -九分钟
-You know where southpaw came from?  -Nine minutes!

620
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,220
很久以前有个人  大概两百年前
I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...maybe a couple hundred years ago...

621
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,690
他在费城打拳
he was fightin' in the...I think it was around Philadelphia...

622
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,420
他的手...  他是用左手的 
and his arm... he was left-handed,

623
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,660
他的手向着新泽西  那是南面
and his arm was facing towards New Jersey, you see, and that's south.

624
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,660
所以人们叫他做南泽西
So then that's why they call 'em southpaw, you see?

625
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,190
南泽西  南肯顿
Southpaw, South Jersey. South Camden,

626
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,470
南泽西  你明白吗?
southpaw. You know what I mean?

627
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,760
或者这样也好
I don't know. Things probably worked out for the best, don't you think?

628
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,500
因为是左撇子而没机会?
Never got a chance, though, because you're left-handed, huh?

629
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,240
那是实情  小心
Well, that's absolutely true, you know. Watch out.

630
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,310
啊 啊 我的手指脱了臼
I just dislocated my finger.

631
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,480
啊 看  慢着  不关你事  看
Look at that. No, wait. Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.

632
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,950
看见吗?  那是旧伤口
See? Look, I had it...it's an old wound, you see that?

633
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,890
看见吗?  没事的  可以那样弯
Look. See? Nothin'. It bends like that, see?

634
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,860
我本来是... 按钮
I originally done it... look, push the button.

635
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,080
搞掂  不关你事 
-Bong. It works. It ain't your fault. Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.

636
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,660
七分钟
-Seven minutes!

637
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,900
我本来是...我带着我所有拳赛的照片
Yeah, I originally done it. I carry pictures of all my fights.

638
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,770
那本来是 在跟宝贝·坚沙的比赛中弄伤的
I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?

639
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,510
宝贝像飞机那样大只 我两只手都在打他脸部时断了骨
Big Baby's about the size of an airplane. I broke both my hands on his face.

640
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,270
我输了那场拳赛  但这张相很好 你觉得呢?
I lost that fight,but that's a nice picture,don't you think?See how it works there?

641
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,510
真的很好
Real nice.

642
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,470
你玩得开心吗?
Come on. You having a good time?

643
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,850
我动作不是很优美
I'll tell you...you could see I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.

644
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,720
我动作生硬  但我出拳可以很重
But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you know what I mean? I can really hit hard.

645
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,960
不过我是南泽西  没人喜欢跟南泽西打
But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants to fight no southpaw, know what mean?

646
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,430
你知我是怎样开始打拳的吗?
You know how I got started in fightin'?

647
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,600
不知道
No.

648
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,470
我是不是太大声?
Am I talkin' too loud?

649
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,140
-不  -三分钟!
-No.  -Three minutes!

650
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:45,580
我爸爸...不是太聪明
My father... he's, uh... my old man, he was never too smart.

651
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,590
他跟我说  你天生没有脑
He says to me, "You weren't born with much of a brain,

652
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,520
所以要用身体
so you better start using your body," right?

653
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,920
于是我做了拳手
So I become a fighter.

654
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,020
-你明我意思吗?  -是的
-You know what I mean? -Yeah.

655
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,920
你笑什么?
Why are you... why are you laughin'?

656
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,160
我母亲说的刚刚相反
My mother... she said the opposite thing.

657
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,220
她说什么相反?
What'd she say? What'd she say, the opposite?

658
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,440
她说   你天生身体不好
She said you weren't born with much of a body,

659
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,130
所以要用脑
so you better develop your brain.

660
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,370
她真的那样说?
Did she say that?

661
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,670
喂  够点了
Yo! Time!

662
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,900
我可以问你一个问题吗?
Can I ask you a question?

663
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,310
当然可以
Absolutely.

664
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,750
-你为什么喜欢打拳?  -因为我不懂唱歌跳舞
-Why do you wanna fight? -'Cause I can't sing or dance.

665
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,510
不要跌倒
Eh, oh. Don't fall! Don't fall!

666
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,850
很好  我做得不错
Hey, that was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.

667
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,250
喜欢我这样溜冰吗?
You like the way I skate?

668
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,390
我上一场比赛的对手 叫史派德·烈高
The last fight I had, I had with this guy named Spider Rico.

669
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,090
他打到我头破血流 你看见这疤痕吗?
He busted my head up. You see that scar?

670
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,500
擂台上可以很粗暴
I'll tell ya... things get pretty rough in the ring.

671
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,910
有人生性怕羞
You know, with some people, I'm very shy by nature, you know?

672
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,740
大概是
I suppose.

673
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,610
我觉得你是生性怕羞
I say you're very shy by nature, you know?

674
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,350
大概是
I suppose.

675
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,920
躲在暗角的流浪汉
Ey! Ey. The bum from the dark.

676
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,760
去找份工作啦
Get a job, you bum!

677
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,980
有人觉得怕羞是一种病
You know, some people think that being shy is a disease,

678
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,400
但我不觉得有问题
but it don't bother me none.

679
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,870
我也不觉得
It don't bother me, either.

680
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,660
那我为什么要提起?
Then why'd I bother bringing it up, huh?

681
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,400
因为我蠢
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

682
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,440
我们是一对活宝
I think we make a real sharp couple of coconuts.

683
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,670
我蠢  你怕羞  你觉得呢?
I'm dumb, you're shy. What do you think, huh?

684
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,780
我不明白怎么会有人想做拳手
I don't understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter.

685
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,620
你一定要是白痴
Hey, you gotta be a moron.

686
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,290
才会做拳手  你知道我的意思?
You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what I mean?

687
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,760
那骗人的行业注定你最终要成为废柴
It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

688
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,460
-我不觉得你是废柴  -我至少是半条废柴
-I don't think you're a bum. -Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?

689
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,030
但我告诉你
But I'll tell ya somethin'.

690
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,830
打拳最难受的  是之后那早上
The worst thing about fightin' is the mornin' after, you know?

691
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,270
-知吗?  -之后那早上
-The mornin' after? -I'll tell you. Yeah.

692
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,870
对  拳赛之后那早上  你就像个大伤口
The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing but a large wound, know what I mean?

693
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,240
有时全身痛
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

694
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,050
从床去厕所都想叫的士
I feel like callin' a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom.

695
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,880
头发痛  眼睛痛
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,

696
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,720
面部损伤  双手肿胀
your face is all busted up, your hands are swollen, you know?

697
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,090
看我块面  64场拳赛  看那鼻子
Look at this face. 64 fights. Look at that nose.

698
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,490
看见我鼻子吗? 
See that nose?

699
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,020
鼻子被人打过  却未断过
That nose ain't never been broken. 64 fights.

700
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,920
被人咬过  扭过  撞过
I've had guys bustin' on it, I had guys chewin' on it,

701
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,100
总之劈过搥过
twistin' it, punchin' it... I mean, whack! Boom!

702
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,830
他们成日打我鼻子
These guys, they hittin' my nose all the time.

703
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,170
但从没打断过  我为此很自豪  很罕见的
Never broken. I'm very proud of that. Isn't that rare? That's rare.

704
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,370
-既然会受伤  为什么还要打?  -你认为呢?
-Why do you do it if it hurts? -Why do you think?

705
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,020
因为你不懂唱歌跳舞?
'Cause... you can't sing and dance.

706
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,580
对了  大概是这样
Yeah, somethin' like that. Somethin' like that.

707
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,140
你要进来吗?
Hey, you wanna come inside?

708
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,360
不  我要走了
No. I gotta go.

709
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,420
来吧  我有小动物
Hey, come on. Hey, I got some animals.

710
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,230
我里面有很珍贵的动物  进来吧
I got these rare... very rare animals inside. Come on. Come on in.

711
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,160

712

来啦
Come on.

714
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,200
不  我真的要走 
-No,I gotta go.

715
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,320
看我的脸  很可靠吧?
-Hey,look at this face.Is that a face you could trust or what?Is it?

716
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,320
我这样子应该印在邮票上
They oughta stick this face on a stamp. What do you think?

717
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,250
来吧
Come on. Come on in.

718
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,180
喂  进来啦
Yo. Come on.

719
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,670
开灯

720
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,180
艾莉  你饿吗?
Yo, Adrian, are you hungry?

721
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,650
不
No.

722
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,060
我有食物  你要汽水  面包圈或什么吗?
I got some things in there. If you like soda, some donuts or something.

723
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,360

还有朱古力
I think I got some chocolate in there.

725
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,560
不要?
No?

726
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,940
这里很热
Hot in here, you know?

727
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,240
我想听音乐
I could go for some music.

728
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,790
艾莉
Yo, Adrian.

729
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,020
这些就是我说的奇异动物
These are the exotic animals I was tellin' you about.

730
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,120
他们是我的朋友  格夫和林肯
These are my friends Cuff and Link.

731
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,460
是我卖给你的
I sold 'em to you.

732
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,190
我知是你卖给我的
Sure, I know you sold them to me.

733
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,990
你记得吗?  你在那间宠物店工作
Remember you were workin' at that pet shop, huh?

734
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,990
你第一天上班  我进来买了这些动物 
First day you was there, I came in and bought both these animals, huh?

735
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,330
我记得
Yeah, I remember that.

我买了这个缸和里面的动物
I came and I bought this bowl and I bought the, uh, bought the animals themselves,

737
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:40,940
一些食粮  和放缸底的石粒
some food, the marbles that go in the bottom there.

738
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,840
记得那座山吗?
Remember? Remember that mountain?

739
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,610
我要丢了那座山 
I had to get rid of that mountain,

740
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,750
因为总是反转倒下来
though, 'cause they kept falling over and flipping.

741
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,010
你为什么不过来坐?
Yo, why don't you come on over here and sit down?

742
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,250
张梳化很好坐
It's a nice couch. I don't know.

743
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,390
那边有大虫  这边较安全
There's big bugs in there, you know. It's safer over here.

744
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,300
你要坐下吗?
You wanna sit down?

745
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,980
-是你父母?  -对  是我父母
-Uh, these...these your parents? -Yeah, that's...that's both of them there.

746
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,280
这个是你?
Is this you?

747
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,040
是  我那时八岁
Yeah, that's me when I was eight years old.

748
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,850
那就是婴儿版的意大利牡马
That's the Italian Stallion when he was a baby.

749
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,690
过来吧  舒服点  放松
Why don't you come on over and make yourself comfortable? Relax.

750
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,350
你有电话吗?
Do you have a phone?

751
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,760
没有  我拔了电话线
No, I ain't got no phone.

752
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,860
因为经常有人打来
I had it pulled 'cause of people calling all the time, and, uh,

753
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:44,870
令我很烦  骚扰我
who needs the aggravation, right? The interruptions.

754
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,140
你想打给谁?
Who'd you wanna call?

755
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,800
我想让我哥哥知道我在哪里
I wanna let my brother know where I am.

756
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,240
为什么?
Why?

757
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,510
他可能会担心我
I think he might be worried.

758
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,420
我可以找你哥哥  是那原因的话
Well, I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.

759
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,650
保利 你妹妹在我处  我迟些回复你 再见
Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me! I'll call yous back later! See ya!

760
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,130
你不喜欢这里  是吗?
What's the matter? You don't like the room, do ya.

761
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,540
很好呀
It's fine.

762
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,730
只是暂时性的
Well, it's only temporary, you know.

763
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:18,970
不是那个问题
It's not that.

764
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,800
那是什么问题?
What's the problem?

765
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,370
你不喜欢我?
You don't like me?

766
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,780
你不喜欢龟仔?  是什么问题?
You don't like the turtles? What's the problem?

767
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,520
-我觉得我不属于这里  -不要紧
-I don't think I belong here.  -It's okay.

768
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,780
我不属于这里
I don't belong here.

769
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,090
不要紧  因为你是我客人
Well, you know, it's okay, 'cause you're my guest.

770
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:49,460
我认识你不够深  我未试过单独在男人住所

774
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,650
我也不十分自在

They're probably lookin' for sparrin' partners for Creed, you know?

806
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,000

你有天份成为出色拳手  
'Cause you had the talent to become a good fighter,

813
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:36,560
但你却去帮二流高利贷打人收帐
and instead of that, you became a leg-breaker to some cheap, second-rate loan shark.

814
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,960
只是生活而已
It's a livin'.

815
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:39,900
是浪费生命
It's a waste of life!

829
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,930

830
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,940
-没有  就我自己  -哦

831
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,240
洛奇  我有一项建议想向你提出
Rocky, I've got a proposition I'd like to make to you.

832
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,300
-关于做练拳对手?  -什么?
-Uh, sparrin'?  -Beg your pardon?

833
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,870
我知你在找练拳对手
Well, it's just I know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,

834
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,210
我可以做
and I just wanna say I'm very available, you know.

835
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,340
我肯定你可以
I'm sure you are.

836
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,580
是的  跟拳王练拳是我的光荣
Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor.

837
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,780
-而且还有  -是什么?
-And you know what, Mr. Jergens?  -What?

838
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:11,050
我不会出暗拳  我是很好的练拳对手
I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either. I'd really be a good sparring partner.

839
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,960
你搞错了  洛奇
You don't understand me, Rocky.

840
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,660
我的建议是...
My proposition is this...

841
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,020
你会否有兴趣跟阿波罗·奎迪
Would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed

842
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,260
在世界重量级拳王赛上决战?
for the World Heavyweight Championship?

843
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,710
不会
No.

844
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,470
听着  洛奇
Listen, Rocky...

845
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,080
阿波罗看过你比赛
Apollo's seen you fight.

846
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,480
他喜欢你  他想跟你打
He likes you. He wants to fight you.

847
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,490
只是  你要明白
Well, it's just that, you see, uh...

848
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:41,490
我平时只在拳馆打  我不能赢大赛
I fight in clubs, you know. I'm really a ham-and-egger.

849
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,350
他是拳王...那不会是精彩拳赛
This guy...he's the best, and, uh, it wouldn't be such a good fight.

850
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,360
但谢谢你们好意
But thank you very much, you know.

851

我十分感激
I appreciate it and all that.

852
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:54,130
洛奇  你相信美国遍地机会吗?
Rocky? Do you believe that America is the land of opportunity?

853
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,600
相信
Yeah.

854
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,000
阿波罗·奎迪也相信
Apollo Creed does.

855
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,010
他会证明给全世界看
And he's gonna prove it to the whole world

856
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,980
就是让一个无名之辈 有争冠军的机会
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

857
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:07,020
而那无名之辈就是你
And that unknown is you.

858
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,640
他选了你  洛奇
He picked you, Rocky.

859
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,580
这是毕生难逢的机遇
Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.

860
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,760
你不能错过
You can't pass it by.

861
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,260
你意下如何?
What do you say?

862
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,390
好了  不要拍照了
All right, fellas, fellas. That's enough pictures.

863
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,230
我们想问阿波罗几个问题
We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.

864
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,970
阿波罗  你对费城感觉如何?
Apollo, how do you like the city of brotherly love?

865
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,370
身在费城令我充满爱国情绪
Well, just being in Philadelphia makes me feel patriotic.

866
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,930
美丽城市里的美丽人民
Beautiful people in a beautiful city

867
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,280
在街上走来  祝福我
comin' up to me on the street wishing me the best.

868
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:40,050
我爱我费城的兄弟  而我因身为美国人而骄傲
I love my Philadelphia brothers, and I'm proud to be an American.

869
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,690
阿波罗?  拳王?  你为什么同意
Champ, Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man

870
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,990
跟一个毫无胜出机会的人决斗?
who has virtually no chance of winning?

871
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,050
历史已证实了
Look, if history proves one thing,

872
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,720
美国历史证实了任何人都有机会赢
American history proves that everybody's got a chance to win.

873
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,730
你们没听过霍谷或賓架山吗?
Didn't you guys ever hear of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?

874
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,790
-阿波罗?  -恩?
-Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.  -Yes?

875
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:59,200
你在本国史上最重要的节庆日 跟一个白人决战
It is a coincidence that you're fighting a white man

876
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,430
是纯粹巧合吗?
on the most celebrated day in the country's history?

877
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,770
我不知道
I don't know about that.

878
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,140
在本国史上最重要的节庆日 
Is it a coincidence that he's fighting

879
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,270
跟一个黑人决战又是巧合吗
a black man on the most celebrated day in the country's history?

880
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,940
说得好  阿波罗!  说真相  兄弟
Right on! Tell the truth, brother!

881
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,740
阿波罗  你觉得你的挑战者如何?
Listen, Apollo, tell me... how do you feel about your challenger?

882
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,300
-我觉得他如何?  -是的
-How do I feel about him?  -Yeah.

883
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,150
你什么意思?  过来  洛奇
What do you mean? Come here, Rock.

884
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,390
我的对手  洛奇  你是意大利人吗?
My main man, Rocky, ain't you Italian?

885
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,220
是  我是意大利人
Yeah, I'm Italian.

886
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,120
你问了干吗?
Well, now, what does that mean?

887
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,420
就算他不打得  都赌得
It means if he can't fight, I bet he can cook.

888
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,650
好的
All right, Rocky.

889
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,390
帮个忙  打穿他个肺...
Do me a favor. His lungs... punch 'em out.

890
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,860
保利
Paulie.

891
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,200
你打算怎样打阿波罗·奎迪?
But, Rocky, how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?

892
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,500
噢  奎迪是最出色的
Uh, well, geez, you know. Creed's the best.

893
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,840
我只有尽力而为
I guess I'll have to do the best I can.

894
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,310
告诉我  洛奇  就我们两个...
Tell me, Rocky, just between us...

895
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,440
你那意大利牡马的称号 是怎样来的?
where did you get the name "Italian Stallion"?

896
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:46,850
是我八年前
Oh... uh, I invented that about eight years ago

897
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:53,120
吃晚餐时想到的  洛奇  你对于会得到十五万元报酬
when I was eatin' dinner. Rocky, now your payday will be $150.000.

898
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,590
有什么意见?
Any comment?

899
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:59,120
你没有意见  对吗  洛奇?   没有意见
You... you got no comment, Rocky, right? No comment.

900
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,530
谢谢  洛奇
Right. Thank you, Rocky.

901
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,330
慢着  我想跟我女朋友打招呼  可以吗?
Wait a minute. I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?

902
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,860
-我...  -艾莉  是我  洛奇
-I, uh... -Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.

903
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,930
你相信吗?  很多麦克风和记者
Look at this. Can you believe all this? They put a microphone on me.

904
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,220
-你不是吧  -谢谢  洛奇
-You didn't.  -Thank you, Rocky.

905
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:16,170
-你推什么?  -谢谢  洛奇
-Quit pushin', man!  -Thank you, Rocky.

906
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,840
他令你变傻仔  你不介意?  是我就打爆他的嘴
Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool? I'd break his lips.

907
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,550
-他在出暗拳  -我不介意
-He's taking cheap shots.  -It don't bother me none.

908
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:28,750
洛奇  你要找人帮你
Yo, Rock...I guess you'll be looking for people to help you out.

909
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:33,190
-帮什么?  -帮你过正常生活
-Help in what?  -Keep you livin' the clean life.

910
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,490
我生活得很好  你知道
I'll do okay. You know.

911
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,290
你需要人帮你练习
You need someone to help with the exercise,

912
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:41,460
递毛巾  做跑腿?
and someone standing by with a towel, or runnin' errands. You know.

913
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,270
之前有谁关心我?  没有人
Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.

914
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,970
所以我会自己锻炼
So I just think I'm gonna train myself, you know.

915
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,100
没有那些专业人员帮你
Without such good people around to help,

916
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,200
你机会很小
you don't have such a good chance.

917
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,610
爱恩斯坦被逐出校两次
Einstein flunked out of school twice.

918
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,210
是吗?
That so?

919
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,340
是
Yeah.

920
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,410
贝多芬是聋的  海伦·凯勒是盲的
Beethoven was deaf. Helen Keller was blind.

921
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,420
我觉得洛奇机会不错
I think Rocky's got a good chance.

922
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,390
保利  要我帮你拿啤酒吗?
Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?

923
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:14,630
你想帮我?  离开我的生活
Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed? Keep out of my freakin' life!

924
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,430
-我做错了什么?  -没有
-What'd I do?  -Nothin'.

925
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:21,100
-我说错了话吗?  -你没说什么  不要紧
-What? Did I say something wrong?  -You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.

926
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,880
对了...  你没说什么 什么都没说
That's right... you didn't say nothin'! Nothin' at all!

927
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,710
-我走先  -哦
-I gotta go.  -Oh.

928
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,220
椒盐脆饼在哪里?
Where's the freakin' pretzels?!

929
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,820
我想吃椒盐脆饼  喂  我们没啤酒?
I got the pretzels! Hey! We ain't got any beer?

930
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,990
我以为你会去买啤酒
I thought you were supposed to pick up some beer.

931
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,160
今晚在电视上听到自己名字 觉得怎样?
How'd you like hearing your name on TV tonight?

932
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,110
我很震惊  你干吗那样做?
I was shocked. Why'd you do that?

933
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,010
你跟我开玩笑  是吗?
Come on. You're puttin' me on, right?

934
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,910
当然是
Absolutely.

935
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,650
你什么时候来?
What time should I expect you?

936
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,210
大约7点  好的   嘿
Oh, about 7:00. Hey.

937
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,180
你记得我之前说 电视上发生的事我不介意吗?
You know how I said that stuff on TV didn't bother me none?

938
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,420
记得
Yeah.

939
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,720
其实我介意
It did.

940
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,530
我带你来  是因为
Listen, the reason I brought you here is because, uh...

941
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,810
我想知道你有训练用的资金吗
I wanna know if you got any money for training expenses, eh?

942
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,970
我有几元
I got a few dollars.

943
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,980
几元?  这里  放进拳套里
A few bucks? Well, here. Put this in your glove.

944
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,280
-是什么?  -500元  不用担心
-What's this?  -500 bucks. Don't worry about it.

945
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,580
你从来没有运气
You know, you ain't never had any luck,

946
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,860
但这次你可能有女人运  你觉得呢?
but I think this time Lady Luck may be in your corner. What do you think?

947
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:06,250
可能吧
Maybe. Maybe.

948
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,190
谢谢你的钱  汤尼
Hey, thanks for the money, Tony, you know.

949
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,660
不用客气  迟些见
It's okay. Don't worry about it. See ya, all right?

950
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,390
-慢着  -什么事?
-Hey, wait a minute.  -What?

951
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,400
你现在要训练  不要抽烟
You're in training, huh? Come on.

952
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,530
嘿
Hey.

953
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,570
-汤尼  -怎样?
-Yo, Tony.  -What?

954
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,510
你会去看那场拳赛吗?
You gonna show up at the fight?

955
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,840
我会到擂台边
Ringside.

956
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,080
好额  再见
Hey, ey.

957
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,580
再见
I'll see ya.

958
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,050
来了
Yeah?

959
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,910
你好  我见你还开着灯 可以进来吗?
Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?

960
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,460
-当然可以  -好
-Yeah, sure.  -Yeah, good.

961
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,030
地方很不错
Hey, it's a nice place here.

962
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,040
我是来告诉你
All right, anyway, what I come to tell you is that, uh...

963
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:31,690
你的际遇完全是运气
that what happened to you is freak luck.

964
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,690
-是  运气  -不是吗?  看其他人
-Yeah, freak luck.  -Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.

965
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,410
他们是出色拳手  他们打得精彩  成绩好
Now, they're good fighters, right? They're colorful, they got good records.

966
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,470
他们为了少少钱搏命
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

967
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,510
但你居然有机会争拳王宝座
But you... you get a shot at the title.

968
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,750
运气真是奇怪的东西
Freak luck is a strange thing.

969
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,990
的确是  我可以坐下吗?
Yeah, sure it is. Can I sit down?

970
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,220
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

971
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:53,820
那些是什么?
What the hell are those?

972
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,630
家龟
Oh, those are domestic turtles.

973
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,400
上面那隻是袖口  另外那隻是链扣
The one on the top is Cuff and the other guy's Link.

974
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,290
其余的是石粒
The rest of them are marbles.

975
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,270
是吗?  可以拿来煲靓汤
Yeah? They make good soup, don't they?

976
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:06,560
言归正传  我是来忠告你的
Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya

977
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,170
你要好小心处理这次争宝座的机会
that you gotta be very careful about this shot that you got at the title,

978
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,040
因为  正如圣经上说
because, I don't know, like the Bible says...

979
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,310
你不会有第二次机会
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

980
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,510
是  好的
Yeah. All right.

981
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,510
你有想过吗?
You thought of that, huh?

982
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:25,120
你需要一个经理人
Well, what you need is a manager.

983
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,360
经理人  听我说
A manager. Listen to me.

984
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,030
我知道  因为我在这行打滚了50年
I know because I've been in this racket for 50 years.

985
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:32,500
-50年  -50年
-50 years, huh? -50 years.

986
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:37,970
-我什么都见过  你知我做过什么吗?  -什么?
-God, I've seen it all. All of it. You know what I done? -What?

987
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,980
我什么都做过
I have done it all.

988
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,780
你应该看我把鸡仔·罗素打到跌出擂台
You shoulda seen me when I knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.

989
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:47,910
跌出擂台  那是1923年9月14日
Outta the goddamn ring. That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.

990
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:52,150
那一晚也是科普把登斯 打下擂台的一晚
And it was the same night that Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.

991
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,890
结果是谁得到传媒报导?
The same night. So, who gets the publicity? Figure that out.

992
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,620
-登斯  -对了  但为什么?
-Dempsey.  -That's right. But why?

993
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,560
-因为他是拳王  -不 因为他有经理人
-'Cause he was Champ.  -No! Because he had a manager.

994
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:03,060
我什么也没有
I had nothin', man.

995
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,300
我给你看一样东西  看我的脸
I wanna show you somethin'. Look at my face for a minute.

996
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,770
看这个  左眼上面缝了21针
Look at this. I got 21 stitches over this left eye.

997
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,970
这隻眼有34针
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

998
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,480
我鼻子被人打爆过17次
You know what? I had my nose busted 17 times.

999
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:20,350
最后一次是在跟舍勒米克决战时 被打爆的
The last time was with that fight with Sailor Mike.

1000
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,480
我还保留着那报导  很精彩的拳赛
I got that clip in here. That was a good fight.

1001
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,890
要看吗?
You wanna read that?

1002
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,720
没关系了
You... oh, it doesn't matter.

1003
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,290
总之他打到我双耳变形
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

1004
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,890
洛奇·马西安诺  世界重量级拳击冠军
Ah, Rocky Marciano.

1005
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,340
你令我想起那洛奇  知吗?
You know, you kinda remind me of the Rock, you know that?

1006
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,100
真的?
You really think so?

1007
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:45,950
是  你的动作像他  而且有他一样的 斗心
That's right. You move like him, and you got heart like he did.

1008
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,480
我有 斗心  但我没有储物柜
Yeah, I got heart, but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

1009
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,190
怎样都好
Uh... anyway,

1010
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,160
我刚入这行时...
you know, when I begun in this business, kid...

1011
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:05,060
我建议你比赛前不要喝酒
Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion. Don't drink that piss before a fight.

1012
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,960
对你无益
You know, it's no good for you.

1013
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,310
希望你不介意我这样说
If you don't mind my sayin'.

1014
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,970
我刚入这行时
Anyway, you know, when I started this racket,

1015
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,200
我们这些拳手都被人当狗
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

1016
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,770
为了10元  你要扯断别人喉咙
For ten bucks, you gotta tear somebody's throat out.

1017
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,780
但我从来没有经理人
But I never had no management. You know...

1018
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,580
有一次... 这个人渣
One time, this... this son of a bitch that I fought,

1019
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,160
他在那里放了粒钉
he put a nail right there.

1020
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,880
-在姆指  -在拳套姆指上
-Thumb. -The thumb, yeah. In the glove.

1021
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,290
他在我脸上钉了很多个洞
And he punched so many holes in my face.

1022
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,490
口水都从脸颊喷出来
I had the spit shootin' out of my cheeks.

1023
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,960
你可以想像吗?
Can you imagine that?

1024
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:38,810
让我告诉你我全盛时期的样子
Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like when I was, uh, in my prime.

1025
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,640
你看这个   看这个
I want you to look at some... will you look at that? Look at that.

1026
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:46,460
那是我被那些人  打残以前的样子
That's the way I looked... before these guys got at me.

1027
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,530
很不错 这照片你保存的很好
That's nice. You take very good care of the picture, though.

1028
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,940
我从来没人管理
But I never had...

1029
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,400
那正是问题
I never had no management... that's the trouble!

1030
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:59,080
但我现在有知识和经验  都在脑子里  我想传授给你
But now I got all this knowledge. I got it up here.  Now I wanna give it to you!

1031
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,420
我想把那知识传授给你  我想照顾你
I wanna give you this knowledge. I wanna take care of you.

1032
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:04,740
确保你不用行我的旧路
I wanna make sure that all this shit that happened to me doesn't happen to you.

1033
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,850
你明我意思吗?
You know what I mean?

1034
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,560
-那场赛事已经定下  -我想做你经理人
-The fight's set. -Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

1035
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:14,790
-你明白吧?  -赛事已定下  我不需要经理人
-You follow that, do you?  -The fight's set. I don't need a manager.

1036
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,790
但我能给你的  是你不能用钱买的
But you can't buy what I'm gonna give you.

1037
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:19,960
我有痛苦和经历
I mean, I've got pain and I've got experience.

1038
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,800
我也有痛苦和经历
Well, I got pain and I got experience, too.

1039
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,010
孩子  听着
Listen, kid...

1040
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,400
-米克  -什么?
-Hey, yo. Hey, Mick. -What?

1041
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:29,070
我十年前需要你
I needed your help about ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?

1042
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,550
-是的  -十年前  你从没帮过我  你不关心
-Right. -You never helped me. You didn't care.

1043
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,610
你需要帮忙...
Well, if you wanted help...

1044
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,020
你需要帮忙  干吗不问我?
I say, if you wanted help, why didn't you ask?

1045
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,920
你干吗不那样问我  孩子?
Why didn't you just ask me, kid?

1046
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:41,550
我问过你  但你没听见
Look, I asked, but you never heard nothin'!

1047
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,860
我...
Well, I...

1048
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,120

1050
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:58,040
而且...
And, uh... well.

1051
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,410
他妈的在哪里...
Where the hell is...

1052
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,970
那么久才来这里
Took you long enough to get here.

1053
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,180
过了十年才来我家
Took you ten years to come to my house?

1054
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,410
你不喜欢我的家吗?
Huh, what's the matter? You don't like my house?

1055
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:41,550
我的家发臭?
Does my house stink?

1056
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,390
对了  是很臭
That's right... it stinks!

1057
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,450
我没受过你恩惠
I didn't have no favors from you!

1058
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:49,260
不要这样没礼貌对我!
Don't slum around me!

1059
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,400
还在说全盛时期
Talkin' about your prime.

1060
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,460
那我的全盛时期呢  米克?
What about my prime, Mick?!

1061
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,370
至少你有过全盛时期
At least you had a prime!

1062
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,530
我没有全盛时期  我什么都没有
I didn't have no prime. I didn't have nothin'!

1063
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:02,600
双腿不行了  一切都不行了 没人给过我什么
Leg's are goin', everything is goin', Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.

1064
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,840
有人来叫我打场拳赛  有什么大不了
Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.

1065
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,610
想打那场拳赛吗?  好  我去打那场大赛
Wanna fight the fight? Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

1066
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,450

I wouldn't wanna fight. Know what's gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get that!

1067
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,920
我会赢
I'm gonna get that!

1068
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,390
你要到擂台边看吗?
And you wanna be ringside to see it?

1069
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,890
要吗?  想帮我?
Do ya? You wanna help me out?

1070
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,620
你想看我被人打扁脸吗?
Huh? Do you wanna see me get my face kicked in?!

1071
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,530
双腿不行  什么都不行
Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin',

1072
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,120
以为我会去跟拳王决斗
but they go. "Go on, fight the champ."

1073
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,960
是  我会跟他打
Yeah, I'll fight him.

1074
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,630
被人打扁脸
Get my face kicked in.

1075
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,170
你还走来这里  想搬进来吗?
And you come around here. You wanna move in here with me?!

1076
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,180
来呀  这间屋很不错
Come on in! It's a nice house!

1077
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,040
很不错 进来呀 臭的
Real nice. Come on in and move. It stinks!

1078
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,950
整间屋发臭
This whole place stinks.

1079
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,630
你想帮我?
You wanna help me out? Well, help me out!

1080

1081
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:54,580
气温只有零下2度  我们看天气预测
It's only about 28 degrees. We'll check that forecast in just a minute.

1082
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,920
我觉得是恶作剧  很奇怪...
I feel very mischievous. Very weird. Very...

1083
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,160
我车上的是胶椅
Well, the thing is, I got vinyl seats in my car.

1084
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,290
我今早坐上架车  大叫"呜"
When I hit the seats this morning, I just went. "Whew!"

1085
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,420
如果我都起了床
I'm thinkin', if I'm up,

1086
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,690
德拉威谷的人都应该起了床  你同意吗?
everybody in the Delaware Valley should be up. Do you agree with me?

1087
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,070
早上4点零3分  你还会做什么?
I mean, at three minutes past 4:00, what else are you gonna do?

1088
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,360
-喂?  -早晨  桂玛太太
-Hello?  -Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.

1089

-桂玛太太?  -什么?
-Mrs. Kramer?  -What?!

1092

I think you have a lot of nerve calling me at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!

1093
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:35,160

I tell ya, I need someone to snuggle with, 28 degrees. It's cold out there.

1097
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,930
是报应  我们上两星期逃脱了谋杀罪
We deserve it. We've been getting away with murder the last couple weeks.

1098
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:53,410
今日最高气温是...
Our high today could possibly be 58, and that's it.

1099
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,970
今晚我们会回到零下温度
Tonight we're back down on the 20 degree range,

1100
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,610
近郊再冷一点  明天幸运的话
a little colder in the suburbs, and tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,

1101
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:01,120
可上到4度
we may hit 40 somewhere.

1102
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,020
但现在是零下2度  很冷
But it's 28, it's awfully chilly.

1103
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:06,150

Stinks in... hey, come on. It stinks in here, you know.

1107
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,830

Yeah... I know.

1108
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,410
全部都是你屠宰的?
Hey, did you kill all these things?

1109
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:41,240
不  是在对面街屠宰的
No. Across the street.

1110
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,950
这里像动物殓房
This place is like an animal morgue, you know?

1111
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,770
-太冷了  -是
-It's a little cold in here, ain't it?  -Yeah.

谁屠宰的?
Who killed all these things?

1113
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,190
你疯了吗  保利?
What, are you crazy, Paulie?

1114
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,530
你不付钱给加索  就要上吊
If you don't pay Gazzo, you end up on the hook.

1115
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,930
加索是好人  你知道的
Come on, Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

1116
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,830
不要激动  我知道
Hey, don't get excited. I know that.

1117
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,740
所以我才要你跟他谈 请我做收帐的事
That's why I want you to talk to him about me...the collectin' job.

1118
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:11,210
带我离开这臭冰柜
Get me out of this stinkin' freezer.

1119
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,940
不如你当帮自己  
Why don't you do yourself a favor?

1120
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:15,850
继续做这份工 那样吃得较好
Why don't you keep this job, because you eat better, you know?

1121
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,280
这里会下雪的吗?
Does it ever snow in here?

1122
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,120
你跟我妹妹
Uh... you and my sister.

1123
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:26,020
进展如何?
How you gettin' along together?

1124
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:27,850
你认为呢?
How do you think?

1125
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:31,990
我不肯定  洛奇  实情是怎样?
Well, I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

1126
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,000
关于什么?
About what?

1127
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:36,470
你们之间所发生的
What's the story? What's happening?

1128
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,270
你真的喜欢她?
Do you really like her?

1129
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,670
我当然喜欢她
Sure, I like her.

1130
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,310
我不明白  她有什么吸引你?
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

1131
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:49,170
我不知道  大概是互补不足
I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess.

1132
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:53,790
-什么不足 ?  -我不知道  我和她都有不足之处
-What's gaps?  -I don't know. Gaps. She's got gaps, I got gaps.

1133
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,790
一起便能互补不足
Together, we fill gaps. I don't know.

1134
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,020
你跟她上过床吗?
You ballin' her?

1135
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,950
你不能用诬秽的话来说你妹妹
Hey, you don't talk dirty about your sister.

1136
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,820
你有跟她上床吗?
Are you screwin' my sister?

1137
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:14,130
你明白吗?  我为什么不介绍你给加索
You see? That's why I can't connect you with Gazzo, you know that, Paulie?

1138
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:17,840
因为你是大嘴巴  你太多话
Because you got a big mouth, you know. You just talk too much.

1139
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,070
这里很冷  我要回家了
It's gettin' cold in here. I'm going home.

1140
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,050
这里冷?  这里是很冷
Cold in here?! It is cold in here!

1141

这里很臭  你很臭
It stinks in here, and you stink!

1142
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,070
你打断了肋骨
Hey, you're breakin' the ribs.

1143
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:19,060
如果你那样打阿波罗·奎迪 我们会被拉去坐牢
If you do that to Apollo Creed, they'll put us in jail for murder.

1144
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:23,600
明早见

-我调高了暖气  -谢谢
-I turned the heat up. -Thanks.

1146
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:43,660
你哥哥是好人  只是太固执
You know, your brother's a good man, but he's awful pushy, you know?

1147
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,770
-你要我帮你擦吗?  -不用  我只是酸痛
-You want me to rub you down? -No, I'm just... I'm just sore, okay?

1148
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,330
我坐着就可以
I'll just... just sit here.

1149
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:00,570
-真的?  -真的
-You sure?  -Yeah, I'm sure.

1150

不要  不能上床  知吗?
Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right?

1151
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:08,650
我很累
I'm tired.

1152
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,550
艾莉  我现在是认真的
Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now.

1153
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:15,290
训练期间不能上床  我要养精蓄锐
There's no foolin' around during training, understand? I wanna stay strong.

1154
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,130
-你不是说笑 -不  我不是说笑
-You're not kiddin'? -No, I ain't kiddin'.

1155
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,300
-你肯定?  -是  我肯定
-You sure?  -Yeah, I'm sure.

1156
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:25,700
不如你去煮肉吧?
Listen, why don't you just make the meat, okay?

1157
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,830
好  我去煮肉
Okay, I'll make the meat.

1158
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,060
-不要紧  -对不起
-It's okay.  -I'm sorry.

1159
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:00,730
嘿
Hey.

1160
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:27,600
右边  右边  左边  左边
Right, right. Left, left.

1161
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,060
下边  加油  下边
Underneath. Come on, underneath.

1162
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:34,570
下面  下面  击倒他
Underneath, underneath, underneath. Come on!

1163
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,970
等等  洛奇
Hold it. Hold it.

1164
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,530
我真是要发疯了  
Hold it, Rock, will ya? You drive me crazy.

1165
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:41,000
你打得那样无力 因为你失了平衡
You're so sloppy because you're off balance.

1166
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:44,180
试这个  拿这条绳  绑着两边足踝
Let's try this. Now, take this string. Tie it to both ankles.

1167
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,080
留两尺空位
Leave about two feet of slack.

1168
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:47,740
我步法一向不好
I ain't never had good footwork.

1169
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,810
不用理步法  现在你平衡了
Never mind footwork. Now you're all balanced.

1170
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:54,880
马西安诺也有同样问题  这条绳医好了他
Marciano had the same problem, and this string cured it.

1171
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,120
如果...
Here's the idea...

1172
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,760
你能走动和出拳 而不弄断条绳
that if you can move and you can hit without breaking the string,

1173
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:00,990
你就取得平衡了
you got balance.

1174
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,260
你就变成危险人物
You become a very dangerous person.

1175
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:06,710
-明白吗? -打得不错  洛奇  -谢谢 -继续
-You follow? -You're lookin' good, Rock.  -Thanks. -Let's go.

1176
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,400
对了  是这样的  是这样的  下面
That's it. That's it. Underneath.

1177
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,070
-嘿  洛奇    -什么事?
-Hey, Rock.  -What?

1178
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,540
-签个名好吗?  -走开!
-How 'bout you give us your autograph?  -Get outta here!

1179
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:15,550
我在做生意  不要骚扰我
Don't you ever interrupt me while I'm conducting business.

1180
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,050
快出去
Move your little chicken asses out of here.

1181
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:22,450
你暂时不要碰那宠物店女孩
Listen, kid. You! You lay off that pet shop dame.

1182
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,150
女人令人脚软
Women weaken legs.

1183
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,420
是  但我真的很喜欢她
Yeah, but I really like this girl, you know?

1184
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,330
那叫她来训练你
Then let her train ya!

1185
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:36,690
-好的  我不碰她  -好  出拳
-Okay, no more foolin' around. -Okay. Now hit it.

1186
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,670
女人令人脚软  是吗?
Women weaken legs, huh?

1187
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,010
-洛奇  -洛奇
-Yo, Rock.  -Yo, Rocky.

1188
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,120
你很好看
Yo, you look great.

1189
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,790
-真的?  -是呀
-Really?  -Oh, yeah.

1190
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,960
很漂亮  你会令人心碎
Terrific. I mean, you could be a heartbreaker.

1191
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,690
你这样走到街上会有男人为你心碎
You'll walk down the street breaking hearts,

1192
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,890
很抢镜
the way you're lookin'...very sharp.

1193
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,340
还有一个惊喜给你
I got...I got another surprise for you.

1194
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,560
是什么?
What?

1195
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:18,040
毕寇斯   过来
Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus! Come here, kid! Come here!

1196
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:19,740
在你跑步时给你做个伴
To keep you company when you run.

1197
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,250
快进来见其他家庭成员  歌莉亚没回来吗
Come on in and meet the family. The owner ever come back?

1198
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,240
-歌莉亚说  你要的话就给你  -我要不要它?
-He's yours. He's yours if you want him. -Do I want him? Come here!

1199
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:33,360
它吃什么...  这只狗?
What's he eat... this dog?

1200
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,260
-它吃小龟  -毕寇斯
-He eats little turtles. -Yo, Butkus!

1201
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:03,750
怎么了  毕寇斯?  是谁的货车?  来
What's that, Butkus, huh? Whose truck is this? Come on.

1202
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:08,320
我打个电话  你就做了名人
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

1203
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,090
-你需要曝光率  -不要对着我喷气
-You're gonna need exposure. -Oh, don't breathe on me, Paulie!

1204
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:16,190
可以帮你出名  你以为我不懂吗?
That's the big time! Don't I know about these things?

1205
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,500
你懂个屁  他们想我怎样?
You don't know nothin'! What do these guys want from me?

1206
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,230
看着你受训
To watch you train! Boom.

1207
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,970
你有病吗?  这是很私人的
What is the matter with you, Paulie? This was supposed to be private.

1208
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,640
-我在帮你  -你不是在帮我
-I'm doin' you a favor!  -You ain't doin' me no favors!

1209
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,370
你令我在人前出丑
You're embarrassin' me in front of everybody,

1210
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,850
你令我在你妹妹面前丢脸...
you make me look bad in front of your sister...

1211
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,840
我会把这支雪茄塞进你耳朵 不要对我做这些东西
You see this cigar? I'll stick it in your ear. Don't do these things to me!

1212
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:35,050
你应该先通知我... 留个口讯
You should've called me up or something... leave a message.

1213
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,050
不能这样
Don't do that!

1214
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,850
我妹妹真的很喜欢你
My sister really likes you.

1215
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,830
我迟早杀了你
I'm gonna kill you one of these days, I swear to God!

1216
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,420
来
Come on. Come on.

1217
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,630
-宝贝  -宝贝
-Baby!  -Baby.

1218
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,430
这就是 即将接任的世界重量级拳王  洛奇·巴尔博亚
Here he is, the next heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!

1219
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:52,990
你好  洛奇·巴尔博亚
Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.

1220
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:55,670
我们想访问你  不会耽误你很久的
Listen, we wanna get a brief interview with you. It won't take long.

1221
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,140
-我呢?  -你怎样?
-What about me?  -What about you?

1222
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:59,700
-我负责管肉类  -好  站在后面
-I'm in charge of the meat. -Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?

1223
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:01,940
你不要紧张   放松
Listen, just settle yourself in. Just relax.

1224
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,850
我们会问你几个问题
What we're going to do is just ask you a few questions, Rocky.

1225
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,410
只是几个问题  关于你独特的训练方法
Just a few questions about your unique training method.

1226
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:08,820
跟观众说几句
Talk to the folks at home.

1227
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:11,050
他们想知道你是怎样想到这方法的
They really wanna know how you got into this.

1228
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,850
这不是日常见到的
I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.

1229
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:14,420
杰美  准备好了吗?  开始摄影
Jimmy, you guys ready? Let's roll.

1230
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,330
洛奇  在这里转身
Rocky, why don't you turn right around here.

1231
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,390
不要拍得我像傻仔
Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?

1232
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,460
我不会的  放松点
No, I won't do that. Just relax, Rocky.

1233
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:23,870
今天我们来到访问 重量级挑战者洛奇·巴尔博亚
Today we're here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1234
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:27,270
-我们来到这个...  -那冻肉佬伸了头进来
-The reason we're standing... -The meat guy's stickin' his face in.

1235
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,570
我们再来过
Let's try it again, Rocky.

1236
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:34,480
今天我们来到访问  重量级挑战者洛奇·巴尔博亚
Today we're here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1237
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:36,950
我们来到这个冷藏库
The reason we're standing in this refrigerated box

1238
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,280
是因为巴尔博亚先生有一套特别的训练方法
is that Mr. Balboa has an unusual method of training.

1239
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,180
过一会他会
In a moment, he's going to demonstrate that

1240
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,920
向大家示范
for the viewing audience at home.

1241
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:47,980
但首先要问洛奇 你怎么会来到冷藏库训练的?
But first, Rocky, how did you come to train in an icebox?

1242
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,460
是我的朋友...那边那个人...
Uh, well, my friend... the guy over there...

1243
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,590
有天他让我进来 我打了这里的牛肉  发觉很好
let me in one day and I hit the beef here and kinda liked it.

1244
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:57,330
因为我是挑战者 这里的老板也不介意我来训练
And since I become a challenger, the owner don't mind that I come in.

1245
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,460
这训练方法普遍吗?  其他拳手会打生肉吗?
Is this a common training method? Do other fighters pound raw meat?

1246
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,370
不  是我发明的
No, I think I invented it.

1247
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,950
订好擂台边的座位  给我的人
Don't forget to confirm the reservation for my people at ringside,

1248
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,400
和让我的发型师飞来费城
and be sure to fly my barber to Philly.

1249
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:16,020
给了西岸闭路广告多少钱?
How much is being channeled into West Coast closed circuit advertising?

1250
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:18,490
-三十万   -加到四十五万
-$300,000.  -Make it 450.

1251
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,720
以我名义送二百支玫瑰给市长夫人
And send the mayor's wife 200 roses from me,

1252
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:23,850
记着要拍照片给报馆
and make sure we get a picture of it for all the newspapers.

1253
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,760
你要中西部那十五个电台的广告时段吗?
Do you wanna run the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?

1254
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,770
那些钱放在加拿大做宣传更好
I think you could spend your money better in Canadian publicity.

1255
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,170
对了...阿波罗 我在多伦多有些朋友
By the way...I've got a couple of friends up in Toronto

1256
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,330
可以给你税务优惠
who'd probably be able to get you a good tax break.

1257
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:37,140
佐治  我喜欢你的朋友
George, I like your friends.

1258
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:46,110
拳王  
Hey, Champ...

1259
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:48,780
快过来看  你的对手上电视了
you oughta come look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

1260
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:51,020
看来他很认真
Looks like he means business.

1261
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:52,750
我也很认真
Yeah, I mean business, too.

1262
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:55,160
雪莉  出面还有咖啡吗?
Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?

1263
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:57,630
当然有  奎迪先生  我立即去拿
Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed. I'll get you some right away.

1264
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,170
拳赛之后  或者我会退休 竞选做皇帝
After the fight, I may just retire and run for emperor.

1265
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,900
那个地域唯一的节目
The arena's the only program concession,

1266
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:06,960
将要包括400...
and the gross rental of the arena is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?

1267
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:20,750
戴安娜·路易丝在冻肉场 跟南泽西洛奇·巴尔博亚的访问完毕
Diana Lewis, in the meat house with southpaw Rocky Balboa.

1268
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,920
他找了记者来?
And he called the reporters?

1269
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,600
是  打乱了我的训练时间
Yeah, it threw my whole training schedule off.

1270
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,970
不要恼他  他只是想帮忙
Don't be mad at him. He's just trying to help.

1271
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,640
我没恼他
Adrian, I ain't mad, it's just that, uh,

1272
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:19,270
只是有记者令我乱了阵脚
when a reporter's around, I get out of joint

1273
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:22,010
因为他们会把我拍得很差  保利知道的
'cause they take cheap shots, and Paulie knows that.

1274
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,580
保利不停叫我介绍工作
Paulie keeps askin' me for a job all the time,

1275
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:28,680
但他对打架一窍不通
but he don't know nothin' about fightin'.

1276
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,480
你会跟他说吗?
Are you gonna say anything to him?

1277
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,160
说什么?  我不知道他想从我身上得到什么
What's to say? I just don't know what he wants from me.

1278
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,650
我不要从你身上得到什么
I don't want nothin' from you.

1279
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,530
我不要从你身上得到什么
I don't want nothin' from you.

1280
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,260
这不是施舍
This ain't no charity case.

1281
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,830
滚出我间屋
Get outta my house.

1282
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:49,670
这间屋不是你一个人的
It's not just your house.

1283
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,240
你不再是我朋友
You ain't no friend no more.

1284
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,310
-滚出我间屋  我刚说了 -不要那样对他说话
-Get out of my house, I just says. -Don't talk to him like that.

1285
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:58,870
你两个都滚出我间屋
Both of you get out of my house.

1286
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,920
外面很冷  保利
It's cold outside, Paulie.

1287
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:14,730
我不准你再搞她
I don't want you messin' her,

1288
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,530
我养大你不是要你跟这人渣一起
and I don't raise you to go with this scum bum!

1289
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,370
来啊  你想打我吗?
Come on! Wanna hit on me? Come on!

1290
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,430
来 我会打断你双臂 等你不能再打拳
I'll break both your arms so they don't work for ya!

1291
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,640
停手   我不够资格去见加索?
That's right! I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo...

1292
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,870
加索算什么
That's what I think of Gazzo!

1293
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:32,350
现在你做了大人物
Now you're a big-shot fighter on your way up,

1294
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,580
也不帮朋友
you don't even throw a crumb to your friend Paulie!

1295
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,920
枉我每朝拿冻肉给你
When I go and get you meat every morning!

1296
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:39,650
你忘了?  我还把妹妹给你
You forgot that! Then I even give you my sister, too!

1297
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:42,890
-你没有人性才会说这样的话  -我没有人性?
-Only a pig would say that! -I'm a pig?

1298
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,690
我没有人性会把最好的给你?
A pig gives you the best?

1299
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,360
你这个没有用的人  我没结婚也是因为你
You're such a loser! I don't get married because of you!

1300
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,800
你不能自己住
You can't live by yourself!

1301
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:55,360
是我撮合你两个  你不要忘记
I put you two together! And you... don't you forget it!

1302
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,930
是你欠我的
You owe me!

1303
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,710
-你欠我  -我欠你什么?
-You owe me!  -What do I owe you?!

1304
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,270
你应该要好好对我
You're supposed to be good to me.

1305
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:07,680
我欠你什么  保利?
What do I owe you, Paulie?! What do I owe ya?!

1306
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,410
我对你很好
I treat you good!

1307
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:12,920
我为你煮饭  清洁  洗衣服
I cook for you, I clean for you, I pick up your dirty clothes!

1308
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:16,990
我一直照顾你  我没欠你什么
I take care of you, Paulie! I don't owe you nothin'!

1309
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,720
但你令我觉得自己没有用
And you made me feel like a loser!

1310
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,460
我不是没有用
I'm not a loser!

1311
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,220
-你失了贞操  -什么?
-You're busted!  -What?!

1312
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:26,270
你不是处女
You're not a virgin!

1313
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,700
你让一个男人脱掉你裤子  她失了贞操
You let him into your pants! She's busted!

1314
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,750
我不想再搬冻肉
I can't haul meat no more!

1315
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,740
你想我搬到你那吗?
You want a roommate?

1316
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:14,280
当然
Absolutely.

1317
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,590
当你走上擂台
Okay, now, when you walk into the ring

1318
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,150
面对世界第一的重量级拳手
with the number one heavyweight of the world,

1319
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,820
你会准备好
you'll be ready, won't ya?

1320
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:28,060
为什么?  因为我等了50年  去令你准备好
Why? Because I waited for 50 years to make you ready.

1321
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:33,200
你将会超级强劲   像他们说的  你可以吃闪电
You'll be able to spit nails, kid. Like the guy says, you're gonna eat lightning

1322
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:35,210
放雷屁
and you're gonna crap thunder.

1323
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:38,270
你将变成危险人物
You're gonna become a very dangerous person.

1324
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,440
-喂  -米克  你好吗?
-Yo, Mickey.  -Hey! How are ya?

1325
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:44,980
洛奇  我向你介绍这里的洗伤人 艾尔·西凡尼
Oh, Rock. I want you to meet our cutman here, Al Salvani.

1326
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:47,040
-看看他的眼睛 -艾尔  你好
-Take a look at his eye. -How're you doin'?

1327
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,280
-对了  -不算太坏  我见过更坏的
-That's right.  -It ain't bad. I seen worse.

1328
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,850
你也不坏
You ain't so bad yourself.

1329
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,520
-盖着它  很快没事  -你帮我盖着
-Cover up. Things'll be okay. -Cover up? You cover up.

1330
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:55,420
去冲凉吧
Go and take a shower, will ya?

1331
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,460
好  米克  明天见
Okay, Mick. I'll see ya tomorrow.

1332
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,730
韦特摩那场是你做助手的?
You covered that Whitmar fight, didn't you?

1333
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,960
所以他赢了
That's why you wanted me.

1334
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:06,450
他是冠军材料!  我们有机会赢的!  
Listen,we got a winner here!We got a chance!

1335
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:08,430
他拳拳到肉  无人能及
He goes to the body like nobody you've ever seen.

1336
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,820
你准备吧  我们会赢的
You just stand by, boy. We're gonna win.

1337
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:21,620
洛奇  我跟你谈几句可以吗?
Hey, Rock, It's okay I talk to ya?

1338
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,780
跟我谈几句?
Okay you talk to me?

1339
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,910
当然可以
Sure.

1340
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,320
我想了几个用你名字赚钱的方法
I figured some angle to make some money off your name.

1341
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:29,550
我的名字?
My name?

1342
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:34,030
-怎样?  -广告  我在行
-How's that?  -Advertisin'. I know about that stuff.

1343
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:38,890
你对广告有什么认识?
What do you know about advertisin'? Huh?

1344
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:44,700
你用我的名字赚钱  随便你
Hey, you can make money off my name, make it, okay?

1345
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,270
我去冲凉了
I'm gonna take a shower.

1346
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:50,210
-帮我脱拳套好吗?  -好
-Wanna help me off with these?  -Sure.

1347
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:46,000
Trying hard now

1348
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:50,900
It's so hard now

1349
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:56,240
Trying hard now

1350
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:26,940
你一定会打败他
You're gonna kill him!

1351
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:40,990
Getting strong now

1352
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:46,000
Won't be long now

1353
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:50,730
Getting strong now

1354
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:14,980
Gonna fly now

1355
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:19,890
Flying high now

1356
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:25,440
Gonna fly

1357
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,970
Fly...

1358
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:33,250
Fly...

1359
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,740
意大利牡马争夺拳王宝座

1360
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,560
意大利牡马

1361
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,910
洛奇  你怎么来这里?
Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

1362
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:25,460
休根斯先生  那海报搞错了
Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.

1363
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,860
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1364
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:30,260
我会穿白裤  有条红间
Well, I'm wearin' white pants with a red stripe.

1365
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:36,570
这没关系吧?
It doesn't really matter, does it?

1366
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,000
你会给我们一场精彩演出
I'm sure you're gonna give us a great show.

1367
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:42,560
去休息一下吧
Try to get some rest, kid.

1368
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,740
晚安
Good night.

1369
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:18,060
我做不来
I can't do it.

1370
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,130
什么?
What?

1371
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,840
我不能打败他
I can't beat him.

1372
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:27,570
阿波罗?
Apollo?

1373
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,640
是
Yeah.

1374
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,080
我去了那里  想来想去
I've been out there walkin' around, thinkin'.

1375
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:39,220
我在骗谁?  我根本不是他那个级数
I mean, who am I kiddin'? I ain't even in the guy's league.

1376
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,890
我们打算怎样?
What are we gonna do?

1377
01:37:57,610 --> 01:37:59,010
我不知道
I don't know.

1378
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:07,310
你已经很努力
You worked so hard.

1379
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:12,750
没关系  反正我以前都只是无名之辈
It don't matter, 'cause I was nobody before.

1380
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:16,120
不要那样说
Don't say that.

1381
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:19,430
不用安慰我  那是事实
Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.

1382
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,160
我是无名之辈
I was nobody.

1383
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,060
但那也没关系
But it don't matter either, you know?

1384
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:28,400
因为我在想
So, I was thinkin'...

1385
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,710
我输了这场也无所谓
It really don't matter if I lose this fight.

1386
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:37,780
他劈开了我的头也无所谓
It really don't matter if this guy opens my head, either.

1387
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:42,410
我只想好好的打一场  坚持到最后
'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.

1388
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,720
跟奎迪比赛  从来没人能捱到最后
Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed.

1389
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,430
如果我能撑久一点
And if I can go that distance...

1390
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:57,960
当钟声响起  而我还站着
see, if that bell rings and I'm still standin'...

1391
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:06,640
那将会是我人生中第一次证明...
I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, you see...

1392
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:11,850
我不是废柴
that I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood.

1393
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,240
够点了  去吧
Time, kid. Let's go.

1394
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:25,320
我在这里等你
I'll wait for you here.

1395
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:30,620
不如我在这里等你  你出去打
Or how 'bout I wait here and you fight, huh?

1396
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:34,320
你今天好漂亮
You're lookin' very great today...you know that?

1397
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:40,300
我要去了  但你不要走太远
I gotta go now, but, uh, don't you leave town, huh?

1398
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:43,460
祝我好运  我需要运气
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

1399
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,130
祝你好运
Good luck.

1400
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:49,870
艾莉  你觉不觉得这件袍太大?
Say, Adrian, you don't think this robe is too baggy, huh?

1401
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,470
祝你好运
Good luck.

1402
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:52,880
不要走太远
Don't leave town.

1403
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:59,480
让我介绍我的拍档  赖士图
I'd like to have you meet my colleague workin' the fight with me... Stu Hansen.

1404
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,620
谢谢  比尔·鲍温
Thank you, Bill Baldwin.

1405
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:03,820
今晚非常兴奋  因为洛奇·巴尔博亚...
The electricity is all over the place tonight as Rocky Balboa...

1406
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,120
那是什么?
Hey, what the hell is that?

1407
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,600
我训练你做拳手  不是广告板
I trained you to be a fighter, not a billboard.

1408
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:12,500
-是帮朋友的  -你有什么好处?
-I'm doin' it for a friend. -What do you get out of it?

1409
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:14,630
保利得到三千元  我得到这件袍
Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe.

1410
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:15,870
真聪明
Shrewd.

1411
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,980
今晚这场赛事  两位拳手的高下
The story about tonight's fight, their difference in style,

1412
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,210
正如一本近期的体育杂志所形容
you can quote a recent sports magazine which said,

1413
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,440
是"野人对骑士"  
"Could be the caveman against the cavalier."

1414
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,920
后面有起哄声
I noticed a buzzing in the background now, Bill.

1415
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,320
可能是挑战者准备上擂台
Could be the challengers getting ready to get into the ring.

1416
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:31,720
洛奇  看我的女伴  花了200元
Rocky! Look at my date. Cost me $200.

1417
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:34,280
-是250元  -我要走了  要工作
-250.  -I gotta go. I gotta work.

1418
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,350
-这件袍怎么样?  -大了点
-How's the robe?  -It's a little baggy.

1419
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:39,760
这个1赔50的冷门拳手 演绎着灰姑娘的故事
A 50 to 1 underdog living a Cinderella story,

1420
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:43,230
他体现了全球观众的梦想
and he's captured people's imaginations all over the world.

1421
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:49,570
洛奇  我们爱你 
We love you, Rocky!

1422
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:52,700
-祝你好运  拳王  -谢谢你来
-Good luck, champ. -Hey, thanks for showin' up.

1423
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:55,180
他的纪录是44场胜赛
And his record... 44 victories.

1424
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:58,240
38场击倒  20场败赛
He's got 38 by knockout, and he's lost 20 fights.

1425
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,580
我不禁想  他捱得住吗?
Which makes me wonder, can he stand it...

1426
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:03,050
要有耐力和技术支持三回合
the stamina and the skill to last the three rounds?

1427
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,390
根据赔率就绝不看好
Because Las Vegas odds say no.

1428
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:08,860
洛奇·巴尔博亚  正在攀上擂台
Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now.

1429
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:10,590
"意大利牡马" 
The Italian Stallion.

1430
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,930
袍后面有冻肉标志
Some meat sign on the back of his robe there.

1431
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,660
你看见是什么吗?  森乐冻肉公司...
Have you seen what that was? Shamrock Meats, Inc.

1432
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:20,340
背后又开始起哄  简直是震耳欲聋
A lot of noise coming from the back. You could go deaf with that noise.

1433
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:22,100
有大光灯照着
You have the spotlights.

1434
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,440
那是世界重量级拳王 阿波罗·奎迪吗?
Is that the world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed?

1435
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:29,000
他坐在船上
He's in a boat... riding in a boat.

1436
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:30,810
他在扮乔治·华盛顿吗?
Is he supposed to be George Washington?

1437
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,050
很明显是  他戴了假发
Obviously so. He's got the hat on, the whole thing. Look at that.

1438
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,610
全副装束
It's been confirmed.

1439
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:37,520
世界拳王  阿波罗·奎迪
The world champion Apollo Creed

1440
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:40,420
模仿乔治华盛顿
is doing an imitation of George Washington.

1441
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,820
-他在派钱  -我不相信
-He's throwing money.  -I don't believe it.

1442
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:47,260
我们小时候读书  说乔治·华盛顿
Remember we were talking about George Washington throwing the dollar?

1443
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:48,460
抛1元
Throwing the dollar.

1444
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:51,590
那时候的1元值钱很多
'Course, if you threw a dollar in those days, it went a lot farther.

1445
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:53,330
现在他脱去金假发
Oh, he's taking his...

1446
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,670
脱了假发  摘了帽子
White wig came off, the hat came off.

1447
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,940
我要你 
I want you!

1448
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:02,670
观众非常兴奋
And the crowd is loving every minute of it...look at that.

1449
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,580
这位就是世界重量级拳王
Here is the world heavyweight champion.

1450
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:06,580
阿波罗·奎迪  他为全球观众
Apollo Creed... for you around the world

1451
01:43:06,650 --> 01:43:09,880
装扮成我国之父乔治·华盛顿的模样
he was dressed as George Washington, the father of our country.

1452
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,440
我要你 
I want you!

1453
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,890
真不敢相信  是山姆大叔 
Oh! Look at that! Uncle Sam himself.

1454
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,660
我要你 
I want you!

1455
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:21,060
我要你们全部人 
All of you!

1456
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:23,000
我要你们全部人  他这样说到
"All of you." he's saying.

1457
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:24,930
他好像一面大国旗
He looks like a big flag.

1458
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,490
我要你 
I want you. You.

1459
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:30,130
-他在对我说吗?  -他在对你说
-Is he talkin' to me?  -He's talkin' to you.

1460
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:32,970
-他在对我说吗?  -让他说去吧
-Is he talkin' to me?  -Let him talk while he can talk.

1461
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,710
我要那匹牡马 
I want the Stallion!

1462
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,640
他说"我要那匹牡马"
He says, "I want the Stallion. I want the Stallion."

1463
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,280
外国观众或者不知道  一次大战时
In foreign countries, during WWI,

1464
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:45,290
美国陆军和海军的征兵海报里
there was the picture of Uncle Sam with his finger pointed like that.

1465
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,420
就是山姆大叔那样指着
A recruiting poster for our fellows in the service...the Army and the Navy.

1466
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:51,490
说"我要你"  那正是他在模仿的
"I want you." That's what he's doing a take of.

1467
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,530
他在大叫
There he is. That's it, Creed.

1468
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,160
奎迪三回合内胜出
Creed in three.

1469
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:57,130
他那套衣服要多少钱?
What do you think that outfit cost?

1470
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,840
各位观众
Ladies and gentlemen...

1471
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:12,310
你们好
Good evening.

1472
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,720
祝大家新年快乐
A very happy New Year.

1473
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:17,050
欢迎来到费城
Welcome to Philadelphia.

1474
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,610
今晚名人汇聚
Well, everybody who's anybody is here tonight.

1475
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:21,060
时间...
Time...

1476
01:44:21,730 --> 01:44:28,720
时间不容许我逐一介绍  今晚出席的
Time does not permit me to introduce the many luminaries of politics,

1477
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,170
政界  演艺界和体育界的杰出人士
show business, and the sporting world who are with us tonight.

1478
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:38,440
但我想有请  拳击界的不朽神话
But I would like to present one of the immortals of pugilism,

1479
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:42,500
擂台内外都是冠军
a champion in and out of the ring,

1480
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:48,350
属于费城的"火辣祖"  备受爱戴的费西亚先生 
Philadelphia's own Smoking Joe, the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!

1481
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:00,360
你好吗?
How you doin'?

1482
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:02,420
手下留情  好吗?
Don't hurt him, okay? Go light on him.

1483
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,630
他的拳击生涯是那么光辉
he's been in his career as a fighter.

1484
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,530
现在他正过去跟拳王说话
Now he's coming over to talk to the Champ.

1485
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,000
-嘿  怎么样?  -嘿  祖
-Hey, how 'bout that? -Hey, Joe.

1486
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:12,570
-你避了我很久了  -不  祖  你是下一个对手
-You've been ducking me long time. -No, Joe. You're next, Joe.

1487
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,440
-明白吗?  -下一个到你
-I want you, you understand?  -You're next, Joe!

1488
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:17,110
他们一定是好朋友
They must be friends.

1489
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,390
祖·费西亚 
Joe Frazier!

1490
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:31,950
赛事很快便会开始
The fight is on the way. Settle down because it won't be long now.

1491
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:37,760
现在...要介绍今晚的比赛
And now... for the main event.

1492
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:44,810
挑战者  
The challenger,

1493
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,370
穿白裤  重190磅
white trunks, weighing 190 pounds,

1494
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:51,940
费城的宠儿
Philadelphia's favorite son,

1495
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:57,180
绰号"意大利牡马"  洛奇·巴尔博亚
The Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.

1496
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:06,190
而在我右面
And on my right,

1497
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,430
穿着红白蓝三色

1500
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,580
绰号"灾难大师"  
the master of disaster,

1501
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,340
无可争议的世界重量级拳王
the undisputed, heavyweight champion of the world

1502
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:24,570
阿波罗·奎迪 
Apollo Creed.

1503
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:29,180
我要你  你  你 
I want you and you. You. You.

1504
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,220
你  傻佬  我要你 
You, chump. I want you!

1505
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:37,460
你们两人都在费城比过赛 应该知道规矩
You boys both fought in Philadelphia before, and you know the rules.

1506
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:40,560
不可攻击腰部以下 记着不可用头撞
No low blows, watch your heads, no butting.

1507
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:42,120
握手  出去比赛
Shake hands now and come out fightin'.

1508
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,930
举高手  傻佬
Put your hands up there, chump.

1509
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,990
-快来比赛  -来吧 
-Come out fightin'. -Come on. Come on.

1510
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:50,000
看来洛奇很小心
Rocky's takin' it carefully.

1511
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,740
洛奇很冷静
He's just going over and being calm, it looks like from here.

1512
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:56,180
要摘下帽子了
There goes the big hat.

1513
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:02,610
我从未见过有拳手会在意发型
I've never seen a fighter that concerned about his hair.

1514
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,520
第一回合钟声响了
And there's the bell for round one.

1515
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:18,060
两个拳手步向擂台中央  看着对方
The fighters come into the center of the ring, looking at each other.

1516
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,470
洛奇还在观察
Rocky just looking.

1517
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:24,940
拳王奎迪  迅速发动左拳
The Champion gives one of the left-handed jabs right there.

1518
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:30,070
拳王随心所欲地 拳击较慢的挑战者
The Champ's stinging, the slower challenger jabs at will.

1519
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:34,140
洛奇用面部来挡拳
In fact, it just looks like Rocky's blocking the blows with his face.

1520
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,550
拳王不是在最佳状态
The Champion doesn't look the best he's ever been,

1521
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,320
但他正在进入状态
but he's really moving now.

1522
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:40,550
拳王笑了
Well, the Champion is smiling now.

1523
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:42,020
他在玩弄他
He's toying with this man.

1524
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:44,990
尽量令入场观众值回票价
Trying to give the fans their money's worth.

1525
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:50,860
很明显他远胜挑战者
He's very clearly outdoing the challenger right now.

1526
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:53,530
我会打倒你的
I'll get you. Come on.

1527
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:57,440
他令对手的拳那样落空
He's just trying to make this man make him...see! Make him miss like that.

1528
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,430
拳王在嘲弄他
Oh, the Champ is just taunting him now.

1529
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:06,140
奎迪在跳舞
He's dancing around.

1530
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:09,550
难以置信 
I don't believe it!

1531
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:11,920
-拳王倒地了  -确实如此
-The Champ is down.  -Yes, he is!

1532
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:21,360
奎迪倒地了  真想不到
Creed is down! What a surprise this is!

1533
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:25,770
这是拳王首次被击倒地上
This is the first time the Champion has ever been knocked down.

1534
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:31,200
六  七  八
Six... seven... eight.

1535
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,970
他看来没有大碍  有点呆滞但没事
Appears to be all right. A little glassy-eyed, but okay.

1536
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,940
打他肋骨 努力  洛奇  加油 
Let's go to work right now, Rock! Come on!

1537
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,550
洛奇再出场  他好像很笨拙
Now Rocky coming back out, and he's like a bull in a china closet.

1538
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:44,950
他很努力
He really wants it.

1539
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,820
拳王一出场
Boy, the Champion's coming back.

1540
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:52,060
就想了结他
He's coming off the floor now, and he's trying...

1541
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:54,790
左拳  右拳
A left, a right, another left, another right, combination!

1542
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:57,700
都打到脸上  那才是我们认识的阿波罗
Into the face! And that's the Apollo we know.

1543
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:03,000
拳王正在挑衅洛奇打他
Now he's taunting him.

1544
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:05,170
拳王正在挑衅洛奇打他
He's taunting Rocky. "Come on, let's go."

1545
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,610
左拳  再一拳
Left. There's another left.

1546
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,540
再一个左拳
Another left.

1547
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:12,140
洛奇反攻了 
There!

1548
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,950
洛奇把他逼到围绳上 
Left and right. Rocky's got him on the rope!

1549
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:18,590
分开
Okay, break.

1550
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,160
我们没预见到这样的攻击
I tell you, there's no way we expected this kind of hitting from him.

1551
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:29,430
绝对没有  但是凭着拳王的能力...
Oh, no way, but with the ability of the Champion...

1552
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:37,230
阿波罗狂出左拳  他逼了他到围绳
Apollo unloading a left, really trying to get him up against the ropes.

1553
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:48,580
他们引导他回台角  洛奇找不到方向
They're leading him over to his corner. Rocky can hardly find his way.

1554
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:50,750
他现在坐下来了
He's sitting down now.

1555
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:52,520
我说过了 
I told ya! I told ya!

1556
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:53,920
你鼻梁断了
Your nose is broke.

1557
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:56,360
-看上去怎样?  -更好看了
-How's it look?  -Ah, it's an improvement.

1558
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:59,790
不要再做无聊动作 要出拳和走位 
I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'. I want you to stick and move.

1559
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:03,360
攻他肋骨  要他透不过气
Go for the ribs. Don't let that bastard breathe.

1560
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:04,830
他很棒
The guy's great.

1561
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:08,900
他不知道这是场表演  他以为是拳赛
He doesn't know it's a damn show. He thinks it's a damn fight.

1562
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:11,570
搞定那废柴  我们便可回家
Finish this bum and let's go home.

1563
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,910
继续攻胸腹位置  你表现得好好 
Stay to the body. The body! You're doing great!

1564
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:20,210
奎迪在第一回合被击倒 然后强势反攻
Creed got knocked down at the end of the first.

1565
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:23,880
现在他努力进攻
He came back strong at the end of the first, but he's working hard.

1566
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:27,120
清脆的左拳  再加个强劲的右钩拳
A smart left. Another left and a right.

1567
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,720
来了  他把对手再次逼到角落...
And now coming into the corner again...

1568
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,900
洛奇·巴尔博亚在捱打...
Oh, Balboa's taking a tremendous beating here...

1569
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:47,080
你不懂打拳吗?
Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?

1570
01:50:47,150 --> 01:50:50,140
不要再装模作样  给点东西观众 
Stop clownin' around here and give these people something to see.

1571
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:53,370
他说要继续 
He says he wants him!

1572
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:58,650
如果大家没有意识到这是一场战斗...那就让我告诉你
If you folks aren't aware... you're watching a battle...I tell you that.

1573
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:04,530
洛奇·巴尔博亚尝试反攻
Balboa trying to fight back.

1574
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,760
噢  他击中了拳王 
Oh! He tagged the Champ with a tremendous hook!

1575
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:09,160
拳王想脱身
The Champion is trying to get himself out of there,

1576
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:10,790
但做不到
but he just can't do it.

1577
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:14,000
拳王的头部和身躯 被对手的左右拳狂攻
He is being barraged with lefts and rights to the head, to the body.

1578
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:18,030
洛奇·巴尔博亚在重击拳王头部 
Balboa is smacking the Champion right on the kisser.

1579
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,440
拳证停止了比赛  但他们还想继续
And the referee's... they're ready to keep going. Look at that!

1580
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:24,950
-回到你的台角去  -拳王回到你的台角去
-Back to your corner.  -Put that chump back in his corner.

1581
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:27,710
-来  奎迪  -洛奇还想继续
-Come on, Creed.  -Balboa doesn't want to quit. Hey.

1582
01:51:27,790 --> 01:51:29,380
这是一场恶战呢
This is gonna be a tough one.

1583
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:26,340
现在他被击中了  一个左拳  
Now he's got him. A left.

1584
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,780
左右夹攻 
A hard left and a right combination.

1585
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:41,620
-比尔  是什么驱使他还撑着?  -我不知道
-What is keeping him up, Bill?  -I don't know.

1586
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,590
他连手也无法抬起来挡拳
He can't even get his gloves up to protect himself.

1587
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,500
得停下来了
He needs to stop, Bill.

1588
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:56,740
伏下  不要起来 
Down! Down! Stay down!

1589
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:59,140
阿波罗已高举双手 
Apollo dancing around with his arms in the air.

1590
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:13,150
五  六 
five... six...

1591
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:17,850
七  八  九
seven... eight... nine...

1592
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:29,200
阿波罗不能相信
Apollo can't believe it.

1593
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:49,690
拳王的右肋骨中了对手的左拳
The Champion got a left to the ribs... his right rib.

1594
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,920
这真是一场精彩的...
Oh, this has been a tremendous...

1595
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:00,230
-拳王  行吗?  -我没事
-Okay, Champ?  -Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1596
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:03,140
我可能断了肋骨
It hurts, though. He broke my rib.

1597
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:05,440
我看不见了  得打开眼睛
I can't see nothin'. You gotta open my eye.

1598
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:07,340
-割开它  -我不想这样做
-Cut me, Mick. -I don't wanna do it!

1599
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:10,280
-动手吧  割开它  -好吧
-Go on, cut me. Cut me.  -Ok.

1600
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:12,080
试割开它
Try it.

1601
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:17,580
天啊
Oh, God.

1602
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:20,090
你内出血  我要叫停比赛
You're bleeding inside, Champ. I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?

1603
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:23,560
你不可以叫停
You ain't stoppin' nothin', man. You ain't stoppin' nothin'.

You gotta go. You gotta give it all. Give it all!

1607
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,400
你要尽全力  你要打中他 
You gotta get him. You gotta work on that body.

已到了第十五回合  也是最后回合
The crowd is on fire. The 15th and final round.

They look like they've been in a war... these two.

1610
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:05,630
拳王打中了他
