1
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,141
Get him!

2
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:28,644
Come on... hit him!
Hit him!

3
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:54,600
You're waltzing.
Give this sucker some action.

4
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,136
You're fighting like a bum.

5
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:58,545
You want some advice?

6
00:01:58,616 --> 00:01:59,776
Water.

7
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,784
Cold beer here.
Get your beer.

8
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:02,910
Come on!

9
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:05,285
Rocky, should I bet the fight
don't go three rounds?

10
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:07,517
- You feel strong?
- Absolutely.

11
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:10,854
You want some good advice?

12
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:12,589
- Mouthpiece.
- Move into your...

13
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:20,828
Come on, let's go!

14
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:02,212
Give him room!

15
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:15,518
Hold your hands up!

16
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:35,909
All right. All right.

17
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,643
Next, a six-rounder
between local lightweights

18
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:42,208
Kid Brooks
and Sugar Johnson.

19
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:52,752
Good going, champ!

20
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:55,992
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

21
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:59,001
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you could have this one.

22
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:01,661
You're a bum.

23
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,765
You're a bum... you know that?
You're a bum!

24
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:32,326
Hey.

25
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,300
You really got lucky tonight.

26
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:40,036
Spider, here's your share. $40.00,
less $15 locker and corner man,

27
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,772
$5 shower and towel, 7% tax.

28
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,838
Comes to $17.20

29
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,008
You fought a good fight, Spider.

30
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:48,813
Balboa, you get winner's share.

31
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:51,446
$65 less $15
locker and corner end,

32
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:54,787
$5 shower and towel
and 7% tax,

33
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:58,124
comes to $40.55

34
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,685
When do I fight again?

35
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:02,527
Maybe two weeks.
Give me a call.

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,194
The doctor should be in
in about 20 minutes.

37
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:42,530
Hey, boy.

38
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:41,096
You guys are gettin' better
every year, you know that?

39
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:58,135
Hey, your old man
did pretty good tonight.

40
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,802
Why weren't you there, huh?
You should've seen me.

41
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,142
You guys hungry? Huh?

42
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,475
Here you go.

43
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,146
Here you go.

44
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,222
You wanna see
your friend Moby Dick, huh?

45
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:21,762
How're you doin', Moby Dick?
You missed me today or what? Huh?

46
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:23,722
Huh?

47
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:25,899
Here you go. Say hi.

48
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:28,028
You know, if you guys
could sing or dance,

49
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:30,096
I wouldn't be doin' this,
you know.

50
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:49,157
And, uh, last turtle food
I got here.

51
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:52,423
That's, uh...
last turtle food I got here.

52
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:55,226
It had more flies in it...
more moths and flies.

53
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:58,894
More flies... more moths...
who the hell cares?

54
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,883
How you feelin' this morning, huh?
Full of life?

55
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,112
Fine.

56
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:27,279
Hey, how you doin', killer?
How's the turtle food this week?

57
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:28,517
Fine.

58
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,154
Me, I'm kind of aggravated,
you know?

59
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:32,388
Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:35,454
Not your fault. I'm just kind
of aggravated. Wanna hear about it?

61
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:37,523
I'll tell you somebody who don't
wanna hear about it.

62
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,193
- How you doin', Gloria?
- Yeah.

63
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,365
The last turtle food I got had more
moths in it than flies, you know, Adrian?

64
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,102
And these moths get caught
in the turtle's throat, right about here,

65
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:48,644
and they cough, and I gotta
smack 'em on the back of the shell.

66
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:51,738
And what do you think they get,
huh? And they get what?

67
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:53,407
Huh?

68
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:55,209
Come on.

69
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:56,775
Shell shock.

70
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,510
Shell shock.

71
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,489
You're startin'
with bad jokes early, huh?

72
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:03,549
Well, no, it's just inventin' jokes
ain't so easy sometimes.

73
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:05,288
No joke, huh?

74
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,853
Hey, how's my buddy doin' today?
Yo, Butkus!

75
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:10,399
- I ain't had time to check on him.
- Yo, Butkus!

76
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:17,162
Hey, gimme a kiss.

77
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,799
Gimme a kiss, Butkus.

78
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:21,538
Adrian, I want you to go downstairs
and clean all the cat cages.

79
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:22,874
They're a mess.

80
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:40,263
You gotta pay
for that turtle food, rockhead.

81
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,322
Hey, crime don't pay...
you know that, Gloria. You know that.

82
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:10,416
- Yo, Rock, how's your boxin'?
- Real good.

83
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,553
- Hey, Rock, you fightin' again?
- Yeah, yeah.

84
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,460
Hey, we'll make some money
real soon, huh?

85
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,862
Yeah, a million dollars.

86
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,458
Hey, you.
Where you goin'?

87
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,366
Where you goin', huh?
Where you runnin'?

88
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:29,809
- Where you runnin'?
- Hey! Hey!

89
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,872
- Hey! Don't hit the face!
- Shut up!

90
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,214
- Not the face!
- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.

91
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:36,445
I'm broke... honest to God!

92
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,683
Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb, you understand?

93
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,748
- Please! Please...
- What's your name again?

94
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:46,396
- Bob.
- Bob. Listen, Bob. Listen, Bob!

95
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:50,164
You wanna dance,
you gotta pay the band, understand?

96
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,497
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

97
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,732
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved,
Bob, you understand?

98
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,296
Give me some money.

99
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:59,968
Give me some money.
Come on.

100
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:04,644
There's 130 here.

101
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,842
That's it. That's it.
I'm broke.

102
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:10,580
Hey, Bob. Hey, hey.
You're still $70 light.

103
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:13,646
You don't have to break nothing.
Here, take my coat.

104
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:16,249
It's worth 50, $60.

105
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,226
Here. Take the coat.
Take the coat!

106
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:21,060
- Just...
- No, you should've planned ahead.

107
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:22,962
You know that?
You should've planned ahead.

108
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,558
We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand
like you broke the thumb.

109
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:26,966
You should've planned ahead.

110
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:30,165
Gazzo don't have to know!
He won't be wise to nothin'!

111
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,640
Gazzo won't be wise to nothin'.
Keep the coat!

112
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,772
Keep the...

113
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,501
He only had 130, but I think he's good
for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.

114
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,738
Sure, Rocky.
Bob's good for it.

115
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:13,045
That's it for today. Here.

116
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,611
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.

117
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:17,414
He's late three weeks
and I don't like it.

118
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:19,978
Tomorrow,
three weeks, Del Rio?

119
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:22,548
All right, I got it. Del Rio...
how do you spell Del Rio?

120
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,958
- How'd you do last night?
- I did real good.

121
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,859
- Hey!
- What?

122
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,091
- Did you get the license number?
- Of what?

123
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,134
The truck
that run over your face.

124
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,260
Relax, Buddy.
All right, pull it over here.

125
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:36,499
I wanna let Rocky out, then I'm
gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

126
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,762
How come you didn't break
this guy's thumb like I told you?

127
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,096
- How do you know I didn't...
- You don't think I hear things?

128
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,362
Did I give you a job
this morning or I didn't, huh?

129
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:08,927
So, why didn't you break
his thumb like I told you to?

130
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:12,600
When you don't do what I tell you
to do, you make me look bad, Rock.

131
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:15,839
I figured... look, I figured
if I break the guy's thumb,

132
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,846
he gets laid off, right?
Then he can't make...

133
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:20,075
Don't figure... let me do
the figurin', okay, Rock?

134
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,641
From here on in, just let me do
the figurin', you know?

135
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,313
These guys think that we're runnin'
some kind of charity or somethin'.

136
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:26,878
That they can get off light.

137
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,357
From here on in,
do what I tell you to do

138
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:32,156
because it's bad
for my reputation, you understand?

139
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,060
You got... You got it, Rock?

140
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:36,058
I got it.

141
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:40,836
Hey, how do you spell Del Rio?

142
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:43,896
- Open a dictionary, Rock!
- Come on!

143
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:46,807
Hey, I won't let that happen no more...
about the thumb.

144
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,039
You know?

145
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:53,142
So long, meatbag.

146
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:58,150
<i>I should've broke your thumbs!</i>

147
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:30,081
Hey, Rock, heard you did
real good last night.

148
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:31,643
Absolutely.
You should've seen me.

149
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,450
Don't you think
you oughta take a rest?

150
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,184
- No, my back is hurtin'.
- Your back?

151
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:37,158
My back is hurtin'.
You deaf?

152
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:38,694
No, I'm short.

153
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:45,356
Hey, yo, Mike,

154
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:47,919
where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

155
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:51,229
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

156
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,298
What you talkin' 'bout,
it ain't my locker?

157
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,966
It's been my locker for six years.
Where's my gear?

158
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,373
Mickey told me to bag it
and hang it.

159
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,113
You put my stuff
on skid row.

160
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,514
I been in that locker for six years

161
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,645
and you put my stuff
in a bag on skid row?

162
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,315
Mickey tells me what to do,
I gotta do it, right, Rock?

163
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,790
Where is he?

164
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:17,588
He's outside
working with Dipper.

165
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,086
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

166
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:35,008
Get your hands up there.
Keep your hands up. That's right.

167
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,276
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

168
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:39,747
To the body. To the body.
Attaboy.

169
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,813
Time.
Time!

170
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,580
The hell.
What do you want?

171
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:49,989
How're you feelin' today?

172
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,721
- What?
- I said, how're you feelin'?

173
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,956
- What are you... a doctor?
- You got problems today?

174
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,964
Never mind my problem...
what's your problem?

175
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:58,023
My problem is I've been talking
to your man Michael.

176
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,262
I wanna know how come I've
been put out of my locker.

177
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:03,329
Because Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a contender.

178
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:05,237
He's a climber.
You know what you are?

179
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:06,673
- What?
- You're a tomato.

180
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,074
- A tomato?
- Yeah, let's face it.

181
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:10,977
I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

182
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:13,379
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

183
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,544
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won. Kayo in the second.

184
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:17,813
Yeah? Who'd you fight?

185
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,616
Spider Rico.

186
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,019
He's a bum.

187
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:24,253
You think
everybody I fight is a bum.

188
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,453
Well, ain't they?

189
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:29,294
You got heart, but you fight
like a goddamn ape.

190
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:32,358
Nothing special about you.
You never got your nose busted.

191
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:35,768
Well, leave it that way... nice and pretty,
and what's left of your mind.

192
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,330
You know, Mick, I think
I'm gonna go take a steam.

193
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:41,673
You know why? 'Cause I did real good
last night, and you should've seen me.

194
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,213
- Big deal.
- You should've seen me, too.

195
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,681
Hey, kid.
You ever think about retiring?

196
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,685
- No.
- You think about it.

197
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,687
- Yeah.
- All right. Time.

198
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:53,814
- Hey, man.
- What?

199
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,687
I dig your locker, man.

200
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,122
I dig your locker.

201
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,398
Attaboy.

202
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:35,628
Cold night.

203
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,328
Good night to catch pneumonia,
you know?

204
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:44,904
You need some help
with that cage?

205
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:48,843
There's a good game down
at the Spectrum tonight.

206
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,712
Wanna go to a basketball game?

207
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,780
Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

208
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:04,683
Tough day today, you know.
They took my locker away.

209
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,594
I had that locker for about
six years, but it don't bother me none.

210
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:08,995
Lockers are bad, anyway.

211
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:10,794
After a while,
people get the combination.

212
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:14,564
I must've had 20 bucks taken
out of there in the past six years.

213
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,265
It don't sound like much,
but it adds up, you know.

214
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,467
Doesn't matter. Who cares.

215
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,176
Wow. Cold night.

216
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:25,578
Hey, birds!
Hey, look who's here.

217
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:28,242
Look who's here.
The giant worm.

218
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:31,017
Look at these birds.

219
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:34,079
Don't these birds look like candy,
you know? Like flying candy.

220
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:35,988
Hey, bird,
you wanna fly me home?

221
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,890
You need somebody
to walk you home?

222
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:41,360
- No.
- No? It's a cold night.

223
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:44,491
If I was you and you got the money,
I would take a cab or something.

224
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,398
Too many creeps
around here, you know.

225
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:49,068
Every other block,
there's a creep.

226
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,730
You can always tell a creep.

227
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:56,311
All right. Listen,
I'm gonna go now, okay?

228
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,971
I'll see yous later, all right?

229
00:21:58,047 --> 00:21:59,708
Don't any of you guys get up.

230
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:01,613
I know you had
a hard day in the cage.

231
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:05,017
So, uh... I'm gonna go home,
make up a joke.

232
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:08,148
I'm gonna tell you a new joke
tomorrow, okay? Good night, Adrian.

233
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:09,555
Good night, Rocky.

234
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:31,814
I don't know
what happens to me.

235
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,371
Hey there, Lefty.

236
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,041
- I got a friend for you.
- Hello, Rock.

237
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,451
How you doin'?
You seen Paulie?

238
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,512
- Yeah, he's in the steam room.
- Yeah?

239
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,581
Hey, Rocky,
what's with the eye?

240
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,650
- Been fightin'.
- Hope you won it, at least.

241
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:46,627
Yeah, I did real good.
You should've seen me.

242
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:48,527
<i>Heavyweight champion
of the world Apollo Creed</i>

243
00:22:48,598 --> 00:22:49,929
<i>is at Kennedy Airport, New York.</i>

244
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,830
Hey, Rocky,
who'd you fight?

245
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:53,061
Spider Rico.

246
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:55,797
Is he still around?

247
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:59,035
Yeah, he's doing real good. He's doing
better than you... that's for sure.

248
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:01,474
Hey, Paulie, what,
did you lock the door?

249
00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:03,034
Yo, Paulie!

250
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,945
I'd like to kill the freakin' moron
who broke the mirror.

251
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:08,108
Hey, yo, Paulie,

252
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:10,175
every day,
every night I pass by

253
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,585
your sister's giving me the shoulder,
you know what I mean?

254
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,486
- Forget her.
- What do you mean, forget her?

255
00:23:14,557 --> 00:23:16,388
- You can do better than her.
- Forget nothin'.

256
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,620
Every night I pass by the place,
I tell a joke.

257
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:21,357
Every morning I pass by the place,
I tell a joke. Nothing.

258
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,365
She just looks at me,
you know what I mean?

259
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,765
- Looks, huh?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

260
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:28,326
What... I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?

261
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:31,396
Something wrong with my face?
You know what I mean?

262
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:33,305
- She's a freakin' loser.
- Hey.

263
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,709
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
I could split her head with a razor.

264
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,440
Don't get mental, man, you know.

265
00:23:38,514 --> 00:23:41,415
- Well, you caught me in a bad mood.
- You're always in a bad mood.

266
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:44,248
Adrian ain't sharp.
Adrian is a loser.

267
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,811
- Hey.
- She's pushin' 30 freakin' years old.

268
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:49,483
And if she don't watch out,
she's gonna end up dying alone.

269
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,050
- I'm 30 myself.
- Then you're gonna end up dying alone.

270
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,289
Hey, I don't need see
no crowd around you, neither.

271
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:56,491
I'd like to kill the freakin' moron
who broke the mirror.

272
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:59,228
Come on, let's get out
of this stink, would you? Come on.

273
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:03,004
- I wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?

274
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,404
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

275
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:08,137
Why don't you talk
to him about me?

276
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:12,807
Well, I just don't think Gazzo's hirin'
right now, you know? You know?

277
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,042
Come on.

278
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:20,148
- The girl's dryin' up.
- Who?

279
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:23,886
My sister. If she don't start livin',
her body's gonna dry up.

280
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,190
You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving,
you know that?

281
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:28,093
Why don't you come over
and talk to her?

282
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:29,563
Sure. Beer.

283
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:31,623
Tomorrow you come
for some bird, right?

284
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:34,465
Absolutely. You got it.

285
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:37,506
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,
she calls the hospital.

286
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:39,268
- Paulie!
- I got it. I got it.

<i>Forget about sports
as a profession.</i>

306
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:28,217
<i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i>

307
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,749
<i>- See, be a thinker, not a stinker.
- Okay, thanks a lot, Champ.</i>

308
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:34,422
Hey, are you crazy?
This man is champion of the world.

309
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:37,557
He took his best shot
and became champ. Huh?

310
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:39,464
What shot did you ever take?

311
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:43,027
Hey, Rocky, you're not happy
with your life, it's nice.

312
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:46,200
But me, I got a business going.
I don't have to take no shots.

313
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:48,004
<i>No one having gone more than...</i>

314
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,237
That's right.

315
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,878
Stick that up your business.

316
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:54,814
What are you so insulted about?

317
00:25:55,518 --> 00:26:00,046
Want me to take a shot?
All right... I'll take a shot.

318
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:13,532
Rocky, how's it been going?

319
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:15,093
Hey, Rocky,
how 'bout a bottle?

320
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:17,503
- No wine.
- Come on. Just a little.

321
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,703
Rory, does your brother
know you're hanging out so late?

322
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:24,974
- Screw you, Go-go.
- Her brother knows.

323
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,208
Hey, these guys teach you
to talk like that?

324
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:29,717
- Stuff it, man!
- Never say that! Come here!

325
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:32,346
You stink up the neighborhood!

326
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:36,785
- You know, you can...
- Hey!

327
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,121
When I was your age,

328
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:41,527
there was only one girl in the
whole neighborhood talked like that.

329
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:44,623
That was it. Just one.
What are you doing?

330
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,668
It'll make your teeth yellow.
Don't do that.

331
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:49,569
- I like yellow teeth.
- It'll make your breath like garbage.

332
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:52,631
- Maybe I like garbage.
- Come on, nobody likes garbage.

333
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,199
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...
she wasn't bad-lookin',

334
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:57,769
but, you see, none of the guys
ever took her seriously, see.

335
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:59,781
They never took her out
for any serious datin'.

336
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:01,339
- Why?
- 'Cause that's the way guys are.

337
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,476
They laugh when you talk dirty,
they think you're cute,

338
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:05,544
but after a while, you get
a reputation, that's it.

339
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:07,111
You get no respect,
you understand?

340
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,853
You get no respect.
And I gotta use a bad word.

341
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:13,418
Whore.
You understand? Whore.

342
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:15,157
See, you use dirty words

343
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:17,756
and maybe you end up becoming
a whore, you understand?

344
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,495
Come on, Rocky.
I'm just 12.

345
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:22,060
Hey, that don't matter
that you're 12. It don't matter.

346
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:26,199
You don't really have to be one.
You just act like one... that's it. Boom.

347
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:29,210
Hey, if you get a bad rap,
you understand?

348
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:31,439
Twenty years from now,
people are gonna say,

349
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:33,345
"Hey, you remember Marie?"

350
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,815
"No, who's she?"

351
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,444
"She's the little whore that hung out
at the Atomic Hoagie Shop. "

352
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,182
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
now I remember her. "

353
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:43,521
You see, they don't remember you,
they remember the rep.

354
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:44,924
You understand?

355
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,993
Hey, you got a boyfriend?

356
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:49,895
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

357
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:52,628
You know why? Why don't you
think you have a boyfriend?

358
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:55,500
'Cause you're hangin' out with them
coconuts in the corner, understand?

359
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:57,300
You hang around coconuts,
you get nowhere.

360
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:59,204
They're lemons.
Lemons.

361
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:02,438
You hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends, you understand?

362
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:05,002
You hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

363
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:07,481
You hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

364
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,711
You see?
It's simple mathematics.

365
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:12,318
- I hope you ain't...
- I won't.

366
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:13,548
What was I gonna say?

367
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:16,786
You hope I don't keep acting like
a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?

368
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:18,918
- Yeah, something like that.
- Good night, Rocky.

369
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:20,462
Good night, Marie.
Take care, you know?

370
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,326
- Hey, Rocky?
- Yo.

371
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,332
Screw you, creep-o!

372
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,807
Yeah, who are you
to give advice, creep-o? Huh?

373
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:36,037
Who are you?

374
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:58,032
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

375
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,931
It says here Mac Lee Green

376
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:04,336
has suffered a severely cracked
third metacarpal in his left hand.

377
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,068
Damn.

378
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:08,406
Of course, we can
cancel the fight indefinitely

379
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:10,069
if you're set on fighting Green.

380
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:12,478
Hey, it ain't just Green!

381
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:14,709
What about all the time
Apollo has invested?

382
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:16,752
I believe
we can find a solution.

383
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:19,185
Solution nothin'. You better find me
another ranked contender.

384
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:20,745
And I mean in a flash, Jergens.

385
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:22,484
Don't play games with my client.

386
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,026
Apollo's already done
a million dollars worth of publicity,

387
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:28,086
has made contractual obligations
with 20 different organizations...

388
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:29,654
he's not going
to be embarrassed!

389
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:32,496
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

390
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,559
Ernie's fighting in France
that same week.

391
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:36,935
Then get me Buddy Shaw!
Hell, he's ranked fifth!

392
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:40,032
Went to California
and gained 50 pounds.

393
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:41,940
I get a hold of every
worthwhile contender

394
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:43,603
and they all say the same thing...

395
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,341
five weeks just isn't enough time
to get into shape.

396
00:29:46,415 --> 00:29:48,747
Shape nothin', man!
They're afraid.

397
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:50,809
They know everybody in the world's
gonna see this fight,

398
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,717
and none of them's
got a prayer of whippin' me.

399
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,881
They're makin' excuses
so they don't have to be the chump

400
00:29:54,957 --> 00:29:56,891
to get whipped in front
of the whole civilized world.

401
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,951
All I can say
is I'm a good promoter.

402
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:03,055
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world,

403
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:05,532
and I've broken my ass over this one.

404
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:07,933
But I don't know
what the hell else to do!

405
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:14,435
I do.

406
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:17,972
Without a ranked contender,

407
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:20,709
what this fight is gonna need
is a novelty.

408
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:23,375
This is the land
of opportunity, right?

409
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:26,377
So Apollo Creed,
on January 1st,

410
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:30,186
gives a local underdog fighter
an opportunity.

411
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:31,590
A snow-white underdog,

412
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,493
and I'm gonna put his face
on this poster with me.

413
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:36,394
And I'll tell you why.

414
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:38,126
Because I'm sentimental.

415
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,531
And a lot of other people
in this country are just as sentimental,

416
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:44,437
and there's nothing they'd like better
than to see Apollo Creed

417
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:45,997
give a local Philadelphia boy

418
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:50,136
a shot at the greatest title in the world
on this country's biggest birthday.

419
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:52,043
Now, that's the way I see it.

420
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,706
And that's the way it's gonna be.

421
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:56,945
Apollo, I like it.

422
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,544
It's very American.

423
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,283
No, Jergens.

424
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,018
It's very smart.

425
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:18,635
Okay, I'll see you later, man.

426
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:29,348
- What? What is it?
- I just wanna check this thing out.

427
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:31,886
Now, you said pick up
two yards from Snyder

428
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:33,444
and a grand from Cappoli, right?

429
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:37,356
No, no. No, no. Two yards
from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.

430
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:39,257
- Two yards. Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?

431
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:40,818
Yeah, I got it. Got it.

432
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:43,296
Who's this girl you're going
out with tomorrow night?

433
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:45,793
How'd you know?

434
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,859
You know.
Don't you think I hear things?

435
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:49,871
A lot of canaries
flying around the docks.

436
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:52,407
- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.
- Hey, Rocky.

437
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,670
- What?
- I hear she's retarded.

438
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,734
She ain't retarded.
She's shy, you know?

439
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:58,302
I'll tell you what to do.

440
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,577
Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

441
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,982
- This bum gotta say that?
- Who're you calling a bum?

442
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:06,317
- I'm calling you a bum!
- Okay, relax. Relax.

443
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,379
Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.

444
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:09,947
He's always in a bad mood.

445
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:11,856
You know, you oughta count
your blessings, Buddy.

446
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:13,724
You're still a healthy person,
you know that?

447
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,787
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours, either!

448
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,696
- Kiss my ass!
- Move your shoulders down!

449
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:20,599
- Get out of the car!
- Relax, relax! Relax. My ears.

450
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:23,001
What, are you driving me crazy?
Both of yous.

451
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,701
- Buddy doesn't like you.
- Yeah.

452
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:29,505
<i>Some guys, they just hate
for no reason, capisce?</i>

453
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:31,068
- Yeah.
- Come here.

454
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:36,114
There's 50 bucks. You and your girl
Adrian have a nice time, you hear?

455
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:37,243
Thanks.

456
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,250
Hey, how'd you know her name?

457
00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:42,187
You don't think I hear things?

458
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:44,853
- Hey, Rock.
- What?

459
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:46,758
- Remember what I told you.
- What'd you tell me?

460
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:47,989
Take her to the zoo.

461
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,734
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.

462
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:01,940
What do you think
about Billy Snow?

463
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:03,171
Fouls.

464
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,970
How 'bout Big Chuck Smith?

465
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,209
- Yeah.
- Nah. He's too old and dull.

466
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,579
Hey, Bobby Judd.
He's a good boy.

467
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:12,621
No, I don't feel any heat
from that name.

468
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:14,679
Joe Zach's a good prospect.

469
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:18,520
Exactly what are
you looking for, Apollo?

470
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:22,190
This is what I'm looking for.

471
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:24,198
The Italian Stallion.

472
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,597
Rocky Balboa?
Never heard of him.

473
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,831
Look, it's the name, man.

474
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:34,569
The Italian Stallion.
The media will eat it up.

475
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:37,476
Now, who discovered America?
An Italian, right?

476
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:40,879
What would be better than to get it on
with one of his descendents?

477
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,781
He's a southpaw.

478
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:44,512
I don't want you messing around
with southpaws.

479
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,646
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothin'.

480
00:33:46,722 --> 00:33:48,121
I'll drop him in three.

481
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:54,128
Apollo Creed
meets the Italian Stallion.

482
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:57,564
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

483
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,891
Hey, what are you doing
with that bat, huh?

484
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:03,234
I used to be deadly at stickball.
You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?

485
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:04,465
She's very excited.

486
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,804
- Look at my swollen hands.
- Yeah.

487
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:10,038
The joints from walkin' and
carryin' meat in and out of freezers.

488
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:11,443
It plays hell on the joints.

489
00:34:11,513 --> 00:34:13,674
Maybe you oughta see a doctor.
What do you think?

490
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:15,842
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

491
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,318
Different job. What kind of turkey?
Big turkey or small turkey?

492
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:23,381
Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him
I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.

493
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:26,622
I'd make a great collector.
Bustin' bones don't bother me.

494
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:29,129
Don't bother you.
A big turkey, right? Huh?

495
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:32,531
Gazzo's gotta come... forget Gazzo.
It's a bad job, you know what I mean?

496
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:36,002
- You got a match?
- Go to him for me. As a favor.

497
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:38,699
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
the last time I had a turkey

498
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:40,435
was when they
were having a $2 special

499
00:34:40,509 --> 00:34:42,443
at Horn and Hardog's
about three years ago.

500
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:45,173
Last year me and the turtles
had spam. What do you think?

501
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:47,340
Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

502
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:54,986
Your sister knows
I'm coming for sure, right?

503
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:57,287
Yeah, yeah.
She's very excited.

504
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:00,490
I'm all alone

505
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:02,723
Hey, will you forget
about Gazzo, huh?

506
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:07,124
- I don't ask nobody twice.
- I don't ask nobody twice.

507
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:10,262
Stay away, baby

508
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:14,601
Hey, your sister... you sure
your sister knows I'm comin'?

509
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,508
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's very excited.

510
00:35:16,578 --> 00:35:17,602
Yeah?

511
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:22,507
Paulie? You're late.

512
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:26,585
Called the hospital? She calls
the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.

513
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,080
How you doin'?

514
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,094
I told you she's very excited.

515
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,864
Paulie, why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him here?

516
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:40,424
Look at me.
I'm not ready for this.

517
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,231
Would it make a difference
if you were?

518
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:44,295
He's a friend,
and now he's taking you out.

519
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:45,704
No, I can't.

520
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,969
You're in the kitchen,
and I want you out right now.

521
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:53,737
Hey.

522
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:55,849
Hey!

523
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:58,751
Hey, I want you
outta here instamatically!

524
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:01,654
I'm sick of seein' you hanging around
like a freakin' spider!

525
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,885
Go out! Live!
Enjoy life!

526
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,449
Paulie, I can't go!

527
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:07,518
Don't get wise with me,
now, huh?

528
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:11,088
- I'm tired of you being a loser.
- Don't call me that, Paulie!

529
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:14,499
<i>Apollo Creed says he'll
be shopping for another victim</i>

530
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,267
<i>to fill Green's vacancy for
the bicentennial championship fight.</i>

531
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,171
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?

532
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:23,609
- How do you know I didn't?
- I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!

533
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,408
- I won't go!
- Why?!

534
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:30,080
Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'.
I got a turkey in the oven.

535
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:33,253
Oh. A turkey in the oven?

536
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:41,118
A turkey in the oven.

537
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:49,764
You want the bird?

538
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:52,497
Go in the alley
and eat the bird.

539
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:54,542
Oh, Paulie.

540
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:58,472
I want you outta here!
Get outta the house!

541
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:01,141
Go out and enjoy
your freakin' life!

542
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:06,983
You hungry, Rock?

543
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:17,192
Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just
better forget all this, you know?

544
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,257
- Just forget it.
- Forget nothin'.

545
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:20,824
Go ahead.
Tell her somethin' funny.

546
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:24,304
Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in
a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.

547
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:27,035
You know how to do funny.
You wanna go out with my sister?

548
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:30,169
- Yeah.
- Well... come on.

549
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,271
I don't know what to say.

550
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:49,820
Yo, Adrian,
it's me, Rocky.

551
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:51,297
Rocky, you know?

552
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:53,632
Listen, uh...

553
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:56,802
I don't know what to say,

554
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:59,602
'cause I ain't never talked
to no door before, you know?

555
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,277
I mean, what do I say
to a door... hey, listen...

556
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:06,075
Come on.
You're doin' fine.

557
00:38:06,148 --> 00:38:08,548
I ain't doin' fine.
I look like an idiot.

558
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:10,608
Keep doin' what you're doin'.
You're funny.

559
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:12,677
I know all about these things.

560
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:14,153
I feel like a jerk.

561
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:23,220
Yo, Adrian,
it's Rocky again, you know?

562
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:24,629
Listen, uh...

563
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:28,296
I know you ain't too happy
at this moment, you know,

564
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,962
but could you do me a favor?

565
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:33,030
I ain't got nobody to spend
Thanksgiving with, you know?

566
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:34,769
So, uh...

567
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:38,438
how 'bout maybe you and I maybe
go out together, get something to eat.

568
00:38:38,514 --> 00:38:41,244
I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?

569
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:42,806
Would you like to, uh...

570
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,680
I don't know. Would you like to maybe,
you know, you and me go out together?

571
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:49,587
What do you think?
Would you like to?

572
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:56,787
We're gonna have a good time.

573
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,731
We'll have a real good time.

574
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:06,004
Thanks for the bird.

575
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:12,572
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

576
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,851
- What does your sister like to do?
- Ice skate.

577
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,921
Adrian, come on.
You're lettin' the heat out.

578
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,727
Who pays the bills around here?

579
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,369
Listen, I don't want
no turkey anyway, you know?

580
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:44,138
But it was Thanksgiving.

581
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,544
- It was what?
- It was Thanksgiving.

582
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:50,278
Yeah, to you.
But to me it's Thursday.

583
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:17,973
- It looks kinda quiet, you know?
- I think it's closed.

584
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:20,708
No, I think maybe we're just early
or something like that.

585
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:22,443
- Yo!
- Yo!

586
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:24,678
- We're closed.
- What?

587
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:26,084
I said we're closed.

588
00:40:26,154 --> 00:40:28,645
Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna
smooth this guy out here.

589
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:31,215
So just wait here for a few minutes.
I'll be right back, okay?

590
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,124
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's okay.

591
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:35,129
Hey, listen, are you closed
to the general public,

592
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:37,358
or are you closed to everybody...
you know what I mean?

593
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:41,596
Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

594
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,729
And besides, you ain't
supposed to be in here.

595
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:46,137
So do me a favor
and not stay here, huh?

596
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:50,201
- Would you do me a favor?
- Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.

597
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:52,940
Look... this girl here
ain't feelin' well, you know.

598
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:55,575
The doctors say she should go out
and exercise once in a while,

599
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:57,812
and ice skating's probably
the best thing, know what I mean?

600
00:40:57,886 --> 00:40:59,376
So what do you want from me?

601
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:02,582
I want you to do me a favor.
You could see she ain't feelin' too good.

602
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:05,786
If you could let her on the ice,
I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.

603
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:07,692
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

604
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:10,027
Ten bucks? How 'bout eight...
eight bucks?

605
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,430
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

606
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:14,492
All right, nine bucks,
you got a deal.

607
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:16,867
You have the ice to yourself.
Ten bucks.

608
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:20,739
Give her the blades.

609
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:23,102
Aren't you skating?

610
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:25,169
Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.

611
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:27,579
That's when I started fightin'...
when I was 15.

612
00:41:27,649 --> 00:41:29,981
Skating's kinda bad
for the ankles, you know?

613
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,451
Yeah.

614
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,181
You're a pretty good skater,
are you?

615
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:37,756
You know, like I was saying before
on the way over here.

616
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:40,761
Fightin' used to be tops
with me, but no more, you know?

617
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:43,491
All I wanted to do at a fight
was prove I was no bum...

618
00:41:43,565 --> 00:41:45,931
that I had the stuff
to make a good pro, you know?

619
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,332
You never got the chance?

620
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:51,236
Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause I
still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.

621
00:41:51,306 --> 00:41:53,570
I tell you what the trouble is...
I'm a southpaw.

622
00:41:53,642 --> 00:41:56,304
- What's a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you're left-handed.

623
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:58,869
And a southpaw
throws your timing off, you see.

624
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:01,279
Other guys it throws their timing off,
makes them look awkward.

625
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:03,078
Nobody wants to look awkward.

626
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:06,018
- You know where southpaw came from?
- Nine minutes!

627
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:09,421
I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...
maybe a couple hundred years ago...

628
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:12,892
he was fightin' in the...
I think it was around Philadelphia...

629
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,622
and his arm... he was left-handed,

630
00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:17,961
and his arm was facing towards
New Jersey, you see, and that's south.

631
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:20,866
So then that's why they
call 'em southpaw, you see?

632
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:25,635
Southpaw, South Jersey.
South Camden, southpaw.

633
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:26,867
You know what I mean?

634
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:30,567
I don't know. Things probably
worked out for the best, don't you think?

635
00:42:30,645 --> 00:42:33,136
Never got a chance, though,
because you're left-handed, huh?

636
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:36,048
Well, that's absolutely true,
you know. Watch out.

637
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,912
I just dislocated my finger.

638
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:46,116
Look at that. No, wait.
Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.

639
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:49,186
See? Look, I had it...
it's an old wound, you see that?

640
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:52,097
Look. See?
Nothin'. It bends like that, see?

641
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,067
I originally done it...
look, push the button.

642
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:56,127
Bong. It works.
It ain't your fault.

643
00:42:56,204 --> 00:42:58,866
- Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.
- Seven minutes!

644
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,103
Yeah, I originally done it.
I carry pictures of all my fights.

645
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:04,975
I originally done it
in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?

646
00:43:05,046 --> 00:43:08,243
Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.
I broke both my hands on his face.

647
00:43:08,316 --> 00:43:11,479
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think? See how it works there?

648
00:43:11,553 --> 00:43:12,713
Real nice.

649
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:15,679
Come on.
You having a good time?

650
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:20,518
I'll tell you... you could see
I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.

651
00:43:20,595 --> 00:43:23,928
But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you
know what I mean? I can really hit hard.

652
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:27,162
But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants
to fight no southpaw, know what mean?

653
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:28,293
Huh?

654
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:34,639
You know how I
got started in fightin'?

655
00:43:35,544 --> 00:43:36,806
- Huh?
- No.

656
00:43:37,612 --> 00:43:39,671
Am I talkin' too loud?

657
00:43:39,748 --> 00:43:41,340
- No.
- Three minutes!

658
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:45,785
My father... he's, uh...
my old man, he was never too smart.

659
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:48,322
He says to me, "You weren't born
with much of a brain,

660
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,722
so you better start using
your body," right?

661
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,123
So I become a fighter.

662
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:53,422
Oh.

663
00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:55,224
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

664
00:43:55,297 --> 00:43:57,128
Why are you...
why are you laughin'?

665
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,360
My mother...
she said the opposite thing.

666
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:03,427
What'd she say?
What'd she say, the opposite?

667
00:44:04,172 --> 00:44:06,640
She said you weren't born
with much of a body,

668
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,335
so you better develop your brain.

669
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,570
Did she say that?

670
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:11,874
Yo! Time!

671
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:14,108
Can I ask you a question?

672
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:15,513
Absolutely.

673
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:19,950
- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.

674
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:21,852
Eh, oh.

675
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,719
Don't fall! Don't fall!

676
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:27,050
Hey, that was terrific.
I'm pretty good at this.

677
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:28,459
You like the way I skate?

678
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,590
The last fight I had, I had
with this guy named Spider Rico.

679
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,294
He busted my head up.
You see that scar?

680
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:37,702
I'll tell ya...
things get pretty rough in the ring.

681
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:50,111
You know, with some people,
I'm very shy by nature, you know?

682
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:51,945
I suppose.

683
00:44:55,223 --> 00:44:57,817
I say you're very shy
by nature, you know?

684
00:44:59,227 --> 00:45:00,558
I suppose.

685
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:05,124
Ey! Ey.
The bum from the dark.

686
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,963
Get a job, you bum!

687
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:10,704
You know, some people think
that being shy is a disease,

688
00:45:10,772 --> 00:45:12,603
but it don't bother me none.

689
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:14,073
It don't bother me, either.

690
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,869
Then why'd I bother
bringing it up, huh?

691
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:19,607
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

692
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:23,644
I think we make
a real sharp couple of coconuts.

693
00:45:23,718 --> 00:45:25,879
I'm dumb, you're shy.
What do you think, huh?

694
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:31,986
I don't understand why anybody
would wanna be a fighter.

695
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:34,822
Hey, you gotta be a moron.

696
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:38,491
You gotta be a moron to wanna be
a fighter, you know what I mean?

697
00:45:38,566 --> 00:45:41,967
It's a racket where you're
almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

698
00:45:42,037 --> 00:45:45,666
- I don't think you're a bum.
- Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?

699
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,230
But I'll tell ya somethin'.

700
00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:51,906
The worst thing about fightin'
is the mornin' after, you know?

701
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,709
- The mornin' after?
- I'll tell you. Yeah.

702
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:57,650
The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing
but a large wound, know what I mean?

703
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:59,448
Sometimes I got pains
all over me.

704
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:03,252
I feel like callin' a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

705
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:05,088
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,

706
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,391
your face is all busted up,
your hands are swollen, you know?

707
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:11,296
Look at this face.
64 fights. Look at that nose.

708
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:12,697
See that nose?

709
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:15,167
That nose ain't never been broken.
64 fights.

710
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:18,069
I've had guys bustin' on it,
I had guys chewin' on it,

711
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:21,302
twistin' it, punchin' it...
I mean, whack! Boom!

712
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:24,038
These guys,
they hittin' my nose all the time.

713
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:27,104
Never broken. I'm very proud of that.
Isn't that rare? That's rare.

714
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:30,578
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why do you think?

715
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:35,220
'Cause... you can't sing and dance.

716
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,781
Yeah, somethin' like that.
Somethin' like that.

717
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:39,349
Hey, you wanna come inside?

718
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,561
No. I gotta go.

719
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:45,622
Hey, come on.
Hey, I got some animals.

720
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,431
I got these rare... very rare
animals inside. Come on. Come on in.

721
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:51,369
No, no. I gotta go.

722
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:54,602
Well, I gotta go, too.
I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.

723
00:46:54,676 --> 00:46:55,938
Come on.

724
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:58,775
- No, I gotta go.
- Hey, look at this face.

725
00:46:58,847 --> 00:47:02,248
Is that a face you could trust
or what? Huh? Is it?

726
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:04,842
They oughta stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

727
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:08,455
Come on. Come on in.

728
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:15,389
Yo. Come on.

729
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:36,877
Click.

730
00:47:42,657 --> 00:47:44,386
Yo, Adrian, are you hungry?

731
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:45,858
No.

732
00:47:45,927 --> 00:47:50,261
I got some things in there. If you
like soda, some donuts or something.

733
00:47:50,899 --> 00:47:54,562
A couple cupcakes.
Huh? No?

734
00:47:54,636 --> 00:47:56,695
I think I got
some chocolate in there.

735
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:57,760
No?

736
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:07,145
Hot in here, you know?

737
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:11,445
I could go for some music.

738
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:18,991
Yo, Adrian.

739
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,223
These are the exotic animals
I was tellin' you about.

740
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:24,322
These are my friends
Cuff and Link.

741
00:48:24,399 --> 00:48:25,661
I sold 'em to you.

742
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:27,394
Sure, I know you sold them to me.

743
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:30,029
Remember you were workin'
at that pet shop, huh?

744
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:33,199
First day you was there, I came in
and bought both these animals, huh?

745
00:48:33,274 --> 00:48:34,536
Yeah, I remember that.

746
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:36,338
I came and I bought this bowl

747
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:39,141
and I bought the, uh, bought
the animals themselves, some food,

748
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:41,148
the marbles that go
in the bottom there.

749
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:43,047
Remember?
Remember that mountain?

750
00:48:43,118 --> 00:48:46,952
I had to get rid of that mountain, though,
'cause they kept falling over and flipping.

751
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:53,216
Yo, why don't you
come on over here and sit down?

752
00:48:54,129 --> 00:48:55,790
Hmm?

753
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:58,458
It's a nice couch.
I don't know.

754
00:49:00,468 --> 00:49:03,596
There's big bugs in there, you know.
It's safer over here.

755
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:07,504
You wanna sit down?

756
00:49:13,648 --> 00:49:16,242
Uh, these...
these your parents?

757
00:49:16,317 --> 00:49:18,182
Yeah, that's...
that's both of them there.

758
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:19,481
Is this you?

759
00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:21,249
Yeah, that's me
when I was eight years old.

760
00:49:21,322 --> 00:49:24,052
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

761
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:29,894
Why don't you come on over
and make yourself comfortable? Relax.

762
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:36,559
Do you have a phone?

763
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:37,969
No, I ain't got no phone.

764
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:41,372
I had it pulled 'cause of people
calling all the time, and, uh,

765
00:49:41,442 --> 00:49:45,071
who needs the aggravation,
right? The interruptions.

766
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:46,340
Who'd you wanna call?

767
00:49:46,414 --> 00:49:49,008
I wanna let my brother
know where I am.

768
00:49:50,285 --> 00:49:51,445
Why?

769
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:54,711
I think he might be worried.

770
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:57,622
Well, I'll call your brother,
if that's the problem.

771
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:04,624
Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me!
I'll call yous back later!

772
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:05,859
See ya!

773
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:14,338
What's the matter?
You don't like the room, do ya.

774
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:15,740
It's fine.

775
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,937
Well, it's only temporary,
you know.

776
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:19,172
It's not that.

777
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,009
What's the problem?

778
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:27,577
You don't like me?

779
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:29,987
You don't like the turtles?
What's the problem?

780
00:50:30,058 --> 00:50:32,720
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's okay.

781
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:36,986
I don't belong here.

782
00:50:38,032 --> 00:50:41,297
Well, you know, it's okay,
'cause you're my guest.

783
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:45,600
I don't...
know you well enough.

784
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:49,666
I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.

785
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:53,741
Well, I...
they're all the same. You know.

786
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:00,384
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

787
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,615
I don't feel comfortable.

788
00:51:04,692 --> 00:51:07,855
Yo, Adrian, you know,
I ain't so comfortable either.

789
00:51:10,064 --> 00:51:11,656
I should go.

790
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:14,725
Don't go, please.
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

791
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,230
Don't go.

792
00:51:20,942 --> 00:51:22,534
Do me a favor?

793
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,770
What?

794
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:25,676
Take off these glasses.

795
00:51:29,617 --> 00:51:31,608
You have nice eyes.

796
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:35,111
Do me another favor?

797
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:38,285
Would you take off that hat?

798
00:51:45,233 --> 00:51:47,167
I always knew you was pretty.

799
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:51,035
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.

800
00:51:54,842 --> 00:51:56,332
I ain't teasin' ya.

801
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:00,578
I just...
wanna kiss you.

802
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:05,384
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't want.

803
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:07,915
But I wanna kiss you.

804
00:53:20,395 --> 00:53:22,386
Worm, I heard
you had a fight comin' up.

805
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:25,296
Yeah, I'm gonna fight
next month.

806
00:53:25,366 --> 00:53:28,631
That's good, man. You come down to
the gym, we'll see that you get in shape.

807
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,863
How's your weight?

808
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:32,269
- I weigh 175.
- Hey, Rock. How you doin', babe?

809
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,672
- Hey.
- Oh, Mick was lookin' for you up there.

810
00:53:34,742 --> 00:53:35,800
- For me?
- Yeah.

811
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:37,276
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

812
00:53:37,345 --> 00:53:40,280
He was lookin' for you, Jack.
Get on up there and see him.

813
00:53:40,348 --> 00:53:41,872
Yeah. It ain't locked, right?

814
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:44,042
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, go on, man.

815
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:00,163
Hey, you got somethin' for me?

816
00:54:00,234 --> 00:54:02,964
Yeah, there was some guy here
from Miles Jergens lookin' for you.

817
00:54:03,037 --> 00:54:05,028
They need sparring partners
for Apollo Creed.

818
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:06,596
- You're puttin' me on.
- There's the card.

819
00:54:06,674 --> 00:54:08,403
- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.

820
00:54:08,476 --> 00:54:11,138
They're probably lookin' for
sparrin' partners for Creed, you know?

821
00:54:11,712 --> 00:54:14,203
I said that before,
you dumb dago!

822
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:19,041
I've been comin' here for six years,
and six years you been stickin' it to me.

823
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,382
I wanna know how come.

824
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:21,752
You don't wanna know.

825
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,518
Yeah, I wanna know how come.

826
00:54:23,591 --> 00:54:25,582
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know!

827
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,491
Okay, I'm gonna tell ya!

828
00:54:27,562 --> 00:54:30,463
'Cause you had the talent
to become a good fighter,

829
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:31,930
and instead of that,

830
00:54:31,999 --> 00:54:36,766
you became a leg-breaker
to some cheap, second-rate loan shark.

831
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:38,169
It's a livin'.

832
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:40,104
It's a waste of life!

833
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,290
Yes, may I help you?

834
00:55:05,566 --> 00:55:09,730
Oh! You must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
Mr. Jergens is expecting you.

835
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:11,135
Just a moment.

836
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,601
Mr. Rocky Balboa
to see you, sir.

837
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:20,371
Fine.

838
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:23,810
- Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can I have that?

839
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:25,375
Oh, certainly.

840
00:55:25,453 --> 00:55:26,613
Thanks.

841
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:32,452
Mr. Balboa.

842
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,891
How are you?
George Jergens.

843
00:55:34,962 --> 00:55:36,554
Take a chair, please.

844
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:37,791
Thanks.

845
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,431
Mr. Balboa.

846
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:43,493
- Call me Rocky.
- Rocky.

847
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:45,562
Tell me, Rocky,
you got any representation?

848
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,130
You have a manager?

849
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,142
- No. It's just me.
- Oh.

850
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:54,445
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

851
00:55:54,515 --> 00:55:57,507
- Uh, sparrin'?
- Beg your pardon?

852
00:55:57,585 --> 00:56:00,076
Well, it's just I know
you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,

853
00:56:00,154 --> 00:56:02,418
and I just wanna say
I'm very available, you know.

854
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:03,548
I'm sure you are.

855
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:05,785
Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ
would be an honor.

856
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,521
- And you know what, Mr. Jergens?
- What?

857
00:56:07,595 --> 00:56:11,258
I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either.
I'd really be a good sparring partner.

858
00:56:11,332 --> 00:56:13,163
You don't understand me, Rocky.

859
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:15,866
My proposition is this...

860
00:56:16,737 --> 00:56:19,228
Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed

861
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:21,468
for the World
Heavyweight Championship?

862
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:27,912
No.

863
00:56:27,982 --> 00:56:29,677
Listen, Rocky...

864
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:32,282
Apollo's seen you fight.

865
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,681
He likes you.
He wants to fight you.

866
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:38,691
Well, it's just that, you see, uh...

867
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:41,694
I fight in clubs, you know.
I'm really a ham-and-egger.

868
00:56:41,762 --> 00:56:45,163
This guy... he's the best, and, uh,
it wouldn't be such a good fight.

869
00:56:45,232 --> 00:56:47,564
But thank you very much,
you know.

870
00:56:47,635 --> 00:56:49,500
I appreciate it and all that.

871
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:54,337
Rocky? Do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

872
00:56:55,209 --> 00:56:56,801
Yeah.

873
00:56:56,877 --> 00:56:59,209
Apollo Creed does.

874
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,214
And he's gonna prove it
to the whole world

875
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:04,183
by giving an unknown
a shot at the title.

876
00:57:04,251 --> 00:57:07,220
And that unknown is you.

877
00:57:07,288 --> 00:57:08,846
He picked you, Rocky.

878
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:12,782
Rocky, it's the chance
of a lifetime.

879
00:57:13,628 --> 00:57:15,960
You can't pass it by.

880
00:57:17,064 --> 00:57:18,463
What do you say?

881
00:57:23,537 --> 00:57:25,596
<i>All right, fellas, fellas.
That's enough pictures.</i>

882
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:27,436
<i>We wanna ask Apollo
a few questions.</i>

883
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:30,170
<i>Apollo, how do you like
the city of brotherly love?</i>

884
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:33,577
<i>Well, just being in Philadelphia
makes me feel patriotic.</i>

885
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:35,138
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>

886
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:37,480
<i>comin' up to me on the street
wishing me the best.</i>

887
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:40,782
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,
and I'm proud to be an American.</i>

888
00:57:40,855 --> 00:57:43,688
<i>Champ, Apollo,
why did you agree to fight a man</i>

889
00:57:43,758 --> 00:57:46,192
<i>who has virtually
no chance of winning?</i>

890
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,251
<i>Look, if history proves one thing,</i>

891
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:51,924
<i>American history proves
that everybody's got a chance to win.</i>

892
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:54,934
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear
of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

893
00:57:55,002 --> 00:57:56,993
<i>- Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.
- Yes?</i>

894
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:59,403
<i>It is a coincidence
that you're fighting a white man</i>

895
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:01,634
<i>on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?</i>

896
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:02,971
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

897
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:05,239
<i>Is it a coincidence
that he's fighting a black man</i>

898
00:58:05,312 --> 00:58:07,473
<i>on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?</i>

899
00:58:07,548 --> 00:58:09,140
<i>Right on!
Tell the truth, brother!</i>

900
00:58:09,216 --> 00:58:11,946
<i>Listen, Apollo, tell me... how do you
feel about your challenger?</i>

901
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:13,509
<i>- How do I feel about him?
- Yeah.</i>

902
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:15,350
<i>What do you mean?
Come here, Rock.</i>

903
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,085
<i>My main man,
Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>

904
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:19,421
<i>Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

905
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:21,324
<i>Well, now, what does that mean?</i>

906
00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:24,626
<i>It means if he can't fight,
I bet he can cook.</i>

907
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:25,859
<i>All right, Rocky.</i>

908
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:28,595
Do me a favor.
His lungs... punch 'em out.

909
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:30,068
Paulie.

910
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:33,402
<i>But, Rocky, how do you expect
to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

911
00:58:33,474 --> 00:58:35,704
<i>Uh, well, geez, you know.
Creed's the best.</i>

912
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:38,040
<i>I guess I'll have to do
the best I can.</i>

913
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,512
<i>Tell me, Rocky,
just between us...</i>

914
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:43,641
<i>where did you get the name
"Italian Stallion"?</i>

915
00:58:43,718 --> 00:58:47,051
<i>Oh... uh, I invented that
about eight years ago</i>

916
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:48,554
<i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i>

917
00:58:48,622 --> 00:58:53,321
<i>Rocky, now your payday
will be $150.000.</i>

918
00:58:53,394 --> 00:58:54,793
<i>Any comment?</i>

919
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:59,322
<i>You... you got no comment,
Rocky, right? No comment.</i>

920
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,731
<i>Right.
Thank you, Rocky.</i>

921
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:03,531
<i>Wait a minute. I just wanna
say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>

922
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:07,062
<i>- I, uh...
- Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i>

923
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:10,133
<i>Look at this. Can you believe
all this? They put a microphone on me.</i>

924
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,076
<i>- You didn't.
- Thank you, Rocky.</i>

925
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:16,378
<i>- Quit pushin', man!
- Thank you, Rocky.</i>

926
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:20,045
Don't it matter he's makin' you
out a fool? I'd break his lips.

927
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:23,750
- He's taking cheap shots.
- It don't bother me none.

928
00:59:23,824 --> 00:59:28,955
Yo, Rock... I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.

929
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:33,398
- Help in what?
- Keep you livin' the clean life.

930
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:35,697
I'll do okay. You know.

931
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,499
You need someone to help
with the exercise,

932
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:41,667
and someone standing by with a towel,
or runnin' errands. You know.

933
00:59:41,742 --> 00:59:44,472
Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared
about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.

934
00:59:44,545 --> 00:59:47,173
So I just think I'm
gonna train myself, you know.

935
00:59:47,248 --> 00:59:49,307
Without such good people
around to help,

936
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:51,408
you don't have
such a good chance.

937
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:54,818
Einstein flunked out of school twice.

938
00:59:54,889 --> 00:59:56,413
That so?

939
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:57,548
Yeah.

940
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,617
Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.

941
01:00:00,694 --> 01:00:02,628
I think Rocky's
got a good chance.

942
01:00:08,936 --> 01:00:10,597
Want me to get you
a beer, Paulie?

943
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:14,835
Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed?
Keep out of my freakin' life!

944
01:00:15,976 --> 01:00:17,637
- What'd I do?
- Nothin'.

945
01:00:17,711 --> 01:00:21,306
- What? Did I say something wrong?
- You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.

946
01:00:21,382 --> 01:00:24,783
That's right... you didn't say nothin'!
Nothin' at all!

947
01:00:26,854 --> 01:00:28,913
- I gotta go.
- Oh.

948
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:31,420
Where's the freakin' pretzels?!

949
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:39,022
I got the pretzels!
Hey! We ain't got any beer?

950
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,195
I thought you were supposed
to pick up some beer.

951
01:00:50,878 --> 01:00:53,369
How'd you like hearing
your name on TV tonight?

952
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:58,315
I was shocked.
Why'd you do that?

953
01:00:58,385 --> 01:01:00,216
Come on.
You're puttin' me on, right?

954
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,118
Absolutely.

955
01:01:02,189 --> 01:01:03,850
What time should I expect you?

956
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:05,414
Oh, about 7:00.

957
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:07,416
Hey.

958
01:01:21,955 --> 01:01:22,944
Hey...

959
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:28,587
You know how I said that stuff
on TV didn't bother me none?

960
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:29,821
Yeah.

961
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:33,927
It did.

962
01:01:44,244 --> 01:01:47,736
Listen, the reason I brought you here
is because, uh...

963
01:01:47,814 --> 01:01:50,544
I wanna know if you got any money
for training expenses, eh?

964
01:01:50,617 --> 01:01:52,175
I got a few dollars.

965
01:01:52,252 --> 01:01:54,652
A few bucks? Well, here.
Put this in your glove.

966
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:57,485
- What's this?
- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.

967
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:00,789
You know, you ain't never
had any luck,

968
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:04,728
but I think this time Lady Luck may be
in your corner. What do you think?

969
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:06,459
Maybe. Maybe.

970
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:08,398
Hey, thanks for the money,
Tony, you know.

971
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:10,868
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
See ya, all right?

972
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:13,595
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

973
01:02:13,673 --> 01:02:15,607
You're in training, huh?
Come on.

974
01:02:15,675 --> 01:02:16,733
Hey.

975
01:02:24,184 --> 01:02:25,776
- Yo, Tony.
- What?

976
01:02:26,386 --> 01:02:28,718
You gonna show up at the fight?

977
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:30,050
Ringside.

978
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:31,283
Hey, ey.

979
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:33,785
I'll see ya.

980
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:10,254
Yeah?

981
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:19,771
Hello, kid. I seen your light.
Can I come in?

982
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,670
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, good.

983
01:03:21,741 --> 01:03:24,232
Hey, it's a nice place here.

984
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:28,246
All right, anyway,
what I come to tell you is that, uh...

985
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:32,416
that what happened to you
is freak luck.

986
01:03:32,485 --> 01:03:35,977
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.

987
01:03:36,055 --> 01:03:39,616
Now, they're good fighters, right?
They're colorful, they got good records.

988
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:42,354
They fight their guts out
for peanuts.

989
01:03:42,428 --> 01:03:46,159
But you...
you get a shot at the title.

990
01:03:46,232 --> 01:03:47,893
Freak luck is a strange thing.

991
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,197
Yeah, sure it is.
Can I sit down?

992
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:51,430
Yeah, sure.

993
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:54,029
What the hell are those?

994
01:03:54,107 --> 01:03:55,836
Oh, those are domestic turtles.

995
01:03:55,909 --> 01:03:58,605
The one on the top is Cuff
and the other guy's Link.

996
01:03:58,678 --> 01:04:00,168
The rest of them are marbles.

997
01:04:00,246 --> 01:04:02,476
Yeah? They make good soup,
don't they?

998
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:09,045
Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya
that you gotta be very careful

999
01:04:09,122 --> 01:04:12,057
about this shot
that you got at the title,

1000
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,787
because, I don't know,
like the Bible says...

1001
01:04:14,861 --> 01:04:17,193
you ain't gonna get
a second chance.

1002
01:04:17,263 --> 01:04:19,254
Yeah. All right.

1003
01:04:19,332 --> 01:04:21,163
You thought of that, huh?

1004
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:25,330
Well, what you need
is a manager.

1005
01:04:25,405 --> 01:04:27,566
A manager.
Listen to me.

1006
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,235
I know because I've been
in this racket for 50 years.

1007
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:32,710
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years.

1008
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:36,112
God, I've seen it all.
All of it.

1009
01:04:36,182 --> 01:04:38,173
- You know what I done?
- What?

1010
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,185
I have done it all.

1011
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:43,984
You shoulda seen me when I
knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.

1012
01:04:44,057 --> 01:04:48,118
Outta the goddamn ring.
That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.

1013
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:52,358
And it was the same night that Firpo
knocks Dempsey outta the ring.

1014
01:04:52,432 --> 01:04:55,094
The same night. So, who gets
the publicity? Figure that out.

1015
01:04:55,168 --> 01:04:56,829
- Dempsey.
- That's right. But why?

1016
01:04:56,903 --> 01:05:01,203
- 'Cause he was Champ.
- No! Because he had a manager.

1017
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:03,265
I had nothin', man.

1018
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:06,501
I wanna show you somethin'.
Look at my face for a minute.

1019
01:05:06,579 --> 01:05:09,980
Look at this.
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.

1020
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:12,643
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

1021
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,314
You know what?
I had my nose busted 17 times.

1022
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:20,553
The last time was
with that fight with Sailor Mike.

1023
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:23,687
I got that clip in here.
That was a good fight.

1024
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:25,094
You wanna read that?

1025
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:27,923
You... oh, it doesn't matter.

1026
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:31,493
Anyway, he put this vegetation
on my ear.

1027
01:05:32,605 --> 01:05:36,097
Ah, Rocky Marciano.

1028
01:05:36,943 --> 01:05:41,004
You know, you kinda remind me
of the Rock, you know that?

1029
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,240
You really think so?

1030
01:05:42,315 --> 01:05:46,843
That's right. You move like him,
and you got heart like he did.

1031
01:05:46,919 --> 01:05:50,685
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

1032
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:55,958
Uh... anyway,

1033
01:05:56,029 --> 01:05:59,362
you know, when I begun
in this business, kid...

1034
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:05,267
Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

1035
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:07,169
You know, it's no good for you.

1036
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:10,165
If you don't mind my sayin'.

1037
01:06:10,243 --> 01:06:12,177
Anyway, you know,
when I started this racket,

1038
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:14,406
pugs like us,
we was treated like dogs.

1039
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,971
For ten bucks,
you gotta tear somebody's throat out.

1040
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,985
But I never had no management.
You know...

1041
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,783
One time,
this... this son of a bitch that I fought,

1042
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:25,847
he put a nail right there.

1043
01:06:25,925 --> 01:06:28,086
- Thumb.
- The thumb, yeah. In the glove.

1044
01:06:28,161 --> 01:06:30,493
And he punched
so many holes in my face.

1045
01:06:30,563 --> 01:06:33,691
I had the spit
shootin' out of my cheeks.

1046
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,164
Can you imagine that?

1047
01:06:35,835 --> 01:06:39,498
Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like
when I was, uh, in my prime.

1048
01:06:39,572 --> 01:06:42,541
I want you to look at some...
will you look at that? Look at that.

1049
01:06:42,608 --> 01:06:46,669
That's the way I looked...
before these guys got at me.

1050
01:06:46,746 --> 01:06:50,739
That's nice. You take very
good care of the picture, though.

1051
01:06:50,817 --> 01:06:52,148
But I never had...

1052
01:06:52,218 --> 01:06:54,550
I never had no management...
that's the trouble!

1053
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,952
But now I got all this knowledge.
I got it up here.

1054
01:06:57,023 --> 01:06:59,287
Now I wanna give it to you!

1055
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,623
I wanna give you this knowledge.
I wanna take care of you.

1056
01:07:01,694 --> 01:07:05,494
I wanna make sure that all this shit that
happened to me doesn't happen to you.

1057
01:07:05,565 --> 01:07:07,055
You know what I mean?

1058
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,390
The fight's set.

1059
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:11,767
Listen to me.
I wanna be your manager.

1060
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:15,934
- You follow that, do you?
- The fight's set. I don't need a manager.

1061
01:07:16,008 --> 01:07:17,999
But you can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.

1062
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,170
I mean, I've got pain
and I've got experience.

1063
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:23,010
Well, I got pain
and I got experience, too.

1064
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:25,215
Listen, kid...

1065
01:07:25,284 --> 01:07:27,343
- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.
- What?

1066
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,355
I needed your help about
ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?

1067
01:07:30,423 --> 01:07:32,755
- Right.
- You never helped me. You didn't care.

1068
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:34,816
Well, if you wanted help...

1069
01:07:34,894 --> 01:07:37,226
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you ask?

1070
01:07:37,296 --> 01:07:39,127
Why didn't you
just ask me, kid?

1071
01:07:39,198 --> 01:07:41,758
<i>Look, I asked,
but you never heard nothin'!</i>

1072
01:07:42,802 --> 01:07:44,064
Well, I...

1073
01:07:45,738 --> 01:07:47,330
I, uh...

1074
01:07:47,407 --> 01:07:50,740
I know I...
I'm 76 years old.

1075
01:07:55,314 --> 01:07:58,249
And, uh... well.

1076
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,616
Where the hell is...

1077
01:08:32,185 --> 01:08:34,176
Took you long enough to get here.

1078
01:08:35,221 --> 01:08:37,382
Took you ten years
to come to my house?

1079
01:08:37,457 --> 01:08:39,618
Huh, what's the matter?
You don't like my house?

1080
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:41,757
Does my house stink?

1081
01:08:42,862 --> 01:08:44,591
That's right... it stinks!

1082
01:08:44,664 --> 01:08:47,656
<i>I didn't have no favors from you!</i>

1083
01:08:47,733 --> 01:08:49,462
<i>Don't slum around me!</i>

1084
01:08:50,203 --> 01:08:52,603
Talkin' about your prime.

1085
01:08:52,672 --> 01:08:54,663
What about my prime, Mick?!

1086
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,571
<i>At least you had a prime!</i>

1087
01:08:57,677 --> 01:08:59,736
I didn't have no prime.
I didn't have nothin'!

1088
01:08:59,812 --> 01:09:02,804
Leg's are goin', everything is goin',
Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.

1089
01:09:02,882 --> 01:09:05,043
Guy comes up, offers me a fight.
Big deal.

1090
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:07,813
Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

1091
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:11,653
<i>I wouldn't wanna fight. Know what's
gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get that!</i>

1092
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:13,123
I'm gonna get that!

1093
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,593
And you wanna be ringside
to see it? Do ya?

1094
01:09:17,663 --> 01:09:19,096
You wanna help me out?

1095
01:09:19,165 --> 01:09:21,827
<i>Huh? Do you wanna see me
get my face kicked in?!</i>

1096
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:23,732
<i>Legs ain't workin',
nothing's workin',</i>

1097
01:09:23,803 --> 01:09:26,328
<i>but they go.
"Go on, fight the champ. "</i>

1098
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:28,170
Yeah, I'll fight him.

1099
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,839
Get my face kicked in.

1100
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:36,373
And you come around here.
You wanna move in here with me?!

1101
01:09:36,449 --> 01:09:38,383
Come on in!
It's a nice house!

1102
01:09:39,252 --> 01:09:42,244
Real nice.
Come on in and move. It stinks!

1103
01:09:43,322 --> 01:09:45,153
This whole place stinks.

1104
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:49,450
<i>You wanna help me out?
Well, help me out!</i>

1105
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:51,793
<i>Come on, help me out.
I'm standin' here!</i>

1106
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:54,787
<i>It's only about 28 degrees.
We'll check that forecast in just a minute.</i>

1107
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,125
<i>I feel very mischievous.
Very weird. Very...</i>

1108
01:10:58,965 --> 01:11:01,365
<i>Well, the thing is,
I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>

1109
01:11:01,434 --> 01:11:04,494
<i>When I hit the seats this morning,
I just went. "Whew!"</i>

1110
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:06,629
<i>I'm thinkin', if I'm up,</i>

1111
01:11:06,706 --> 01:11:09,869
<i>everybody in the Delaware Valley
should be up. Do you agree with me?</i>

1112
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:13,275
<i>I mean, at three minutes past 4:00,
what else are you gonna do?</i>

1113
01:11:15,848 --> 01:11:17,679
<i>- Hello?
- Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i>

1114
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,412
<i>This is Don Cannon,
W- I-B-G Philadelphia.</i>

1115
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:21,976
<i>- How are you this morning?
- Huh?</i>

1116
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:23,385
<i>- Mrs. Kramer?
- What?!</i>

1117
01:11:23,456 --> 01:11:28,120
<i>I think you have a lot of nerve calling me
at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!</i>

1118
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:34,866
<i>W-I-B-G</i>

1119
01:11:35,434 --> 01:11:40,895
<i>Philadelphia</i>

1120
01:11:41,574 --> 01:11:43,838
<i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,
and it's a good morning.</i>

1121
01:11:43,909 --> 01:11:48,073
<i>I tell ya, I need someone to snuggle with,
28 degrees. It's cold out there.</i>

1122
01:11:48,147 --> 01:11:51,139
<i>We deserve it. We've been getting away
with murder the last couple weeks.</i>

1123
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:53,617
<i>Our high today could possibly
be 58, and that's it.</i>

1124
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:56,177
<i>Tonight we're back down
on the 20 degree range,</i>

1125
01:11:56,255 --> 01:11:59,918
<i>a little colder in the suburbs,
and tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i>

1126
01:11:59,992 --> 01:12:01,323
<i>we may hit 40 somewhere.</i>

1127
01:12:01,394 --> 01:12:03,225
<i>But it's 28, it's awfully chilly.</i>

1128
01:12:03,295 --> 01:12:06,355
<i>Make sure you have it
snuggled on before you bring it out.</i>

1129
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,571
Come on.

1130
01:14:30,409 --> 01:14:32,900
Stinks in... hey, come on.
It stinks in here, you know.

1131
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:35,037
Yeah... I know.

1132
01:14:36,782 --> 01:14:38,613
Hey, did you kill all these things?

1133
01:14:39,618 --> 01:14:41,449
No. Across the street.

1134
01:14:43,823 --> 01:14:46,155
This place is like
an animal morgue, you know?

1135
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:49,521
- It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
- Yeah.

1136
01:14:54,433 --> 01:14:56,094
Who killed all these things?

1137
01:14:56,902 --> 01:14:58,392
What, are you crazy, Paulie?

1138
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,734
If you don't pay Gazzo,
you end up on the hook.

1139
01:15:00,806 --> 01:15:03,138
Come on, Gazzo's a good man.
You know that.

1140
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:05,040
Hey, don't get excited.
I know that.

1141
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:08,944
That's why I want you to talk to him
about me... the collectin' job.

1142
01:15:09,014 --> 01:15:11,414
Get me out
of this stinkin' freezer.

1143
01:15:11,483 --> 01:15:13,144
Why don't you do yourself a favor?

1144
01:15:13,219 --> 01:15:16,052
Why don't you keep this job,
because you eat better, you know?

1145
01:15:17,323 --> 01:15:18,813
Moo.

1146
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:20,483
Does it ever snow in here?

1147
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:24,322
Uh... you and my sister.

1148
01:15:24,396 --> 01:15:26,227
How you gettin' along together?

1149
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:28,059
How do you think?

1150
01:15:28,934 --> 01:15:32,199
Well, I'm not sure, Rock.
What's the story?

1151
01:15:32,271 --> 01:15:34,205
About what?

1152
01:15:34,273 --> 01:15:36,673
What's the story?
What's happening?

1153
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:38,471
Do you really like her?

1154
01:15:38,544 --> 01:15:39,875
Sure, I like her.

1155
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:44,512
I don't see it.
What's the attraction?

1156
01:15:45,885 --> 01:15:49,377
I don't know.
It fills gaps, I guess.

1157
01:15:49,455 --> 01:15:52,117
- What's gaps?
- I don't know. Gaps.

1158
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,991
She's got gaps, I got gaps.
Together, we fill gaps. I don't know.

1159
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,229
You ballin' her?

1160
01:15:59,965 --> 01:16:01,023
Hey.

1161
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:04,158
Hey, you don't talk dirty
about your sister.

1162
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:08,030
Are you screwin' my sister?

1163
01:16:10,743 --> 01:16:14,338
You see? That's why I can't connect
you with Gazzo, you know that, Paulie?

1164
01:16:14,413 --> 01:16:18,042
Because you got a big mouth,
you know. You just talk too much.

1165
01:16:18,117 --> 01:16:20,278
It's gettin' cold in here.
I'm going home.

1166
01:16:20,352 --> 01:16:23,253
Cold in here?!
It is cold in here!

1167
01:16:23,322 --> 01:16:25,483
It stinks in here,
and you stink!

1168
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:56,280
Hey, you're breakin' the ribs.

1169
01:17:15,774 --> 01:17:19,266
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

1170
01:17:21,814 --> 01:17:23,805
I'll see ya tomorrow morning, okay?

1171
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:39,027
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

1172
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:43,862
You know, your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

1173
01:17:53,645 --> 01:17:56,978
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just... I'm just sore, okay?

1174
01:17:57,049 --> 01:17:58,539
I'll just... just sit here.

1175
01:17:58,617 --> 01:18:00,778
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1176
01:18:04,523 --> 01:18:06,855
Hey, come on.
No foolin' around, all right?

1177
01:18:07,693 --> 01:18:08,853
I'm tired.

1178
01:18:09,762 --> 01:18:11,753
Hey, Adrian,
I'm serious now.

1179
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:15,322
There's no foolin' around during training,
understand? I wanna stay strong.

1180
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:18,333
- You're not kiddin'?
- No, I ain't kiddin'.

1181
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,501
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1182
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:25,907
Listen, why don't you
just make the meat, okay?

1183
01:18:28,547 --> 01:18:30,037
Okay, I'll make the meat.

1184
01:18:54,306 --> 01:18:55,466
Yo.

1185
01:18:57,109 --> 01:18:59,270
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1186
01:18:59,878 --> 01:19:00,936
Hey.

1187
01:19:25,471 --> 01:19:27,803
Right, right.
Left, left.

1188
01:19:29,608 --> 01:19:31,269
Underneath.
Come on, underneath.

1189
01:19:31,944 --> 01:19:34,777
Underneath, underneath,
underneath. Come on!

1190
01:19:34,847 --> 01:19:36,178
Hold it. Hold it.

1191
01:19:36,248 --> 01:19:38,739
Hold it, Rock, will ya?
You drive me crazy.

1192
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:41,149
You're so sloppy
because you're off balance.

1193
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,383
Let's try this. Now, take this string.
Tie it to both ankles.

1194
01:19:44,456 --> 01:19:46,287
Leave about two feet of slack.

1195
01:19:46,358 --> 01:19:47,950
I ain't never had good footwork.

1196
01:19:48,026 --> 01:19:50,017
Never mind footwork.
Now you're all balanced.

1197
01:19:50,095 --> 01:19:55,089
Marciano had the same problem,
and this string cured it.

1198
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:56,327
Here's the idea...

1199
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:59,962
that if you can move and you can hit
without breaking the string,

1200
01:20:00,038 --> 01:20:01,198
you got balance.

1201
01:20:01,273 --> 01:20:03,400
You become
a very dangerous person.

1202
01:20:03,475 --> 01:20:05,466
- You follow?
- You're lookin' good, Rock.

1203
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:06,875
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

1204
01:20:06,945 --> 01:20:08,606
That's it. That's it.
Underneath.

1205
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,272
- Hey, Rock.
- What?

1206
01:20:10,349 --> 01:20:12,749
- How 'bout you give us your autograph?
- Get outta here!

1207
01:20:12,818 --> 01:20:15,753
Don't you ever interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.

1208
01:20:15,821 --> 01:20:18,255
Move your little
chicken asses out of here.

1209
01:20:18,323 --> 01:20:22,657
Listen, kid. You!
You lay off that pet shop dame.

1210
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:25,356
Women weaken legs.

1211
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:28,629
Yeah, but I really like
this girl, you know?

1212
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,531
Then let her train ya!

1213
01:20:33,338 --> 01:20:36,899
- Okay, no more foolin' around.
- Okay. Now hit it.

1214
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,874
Women weaken legs, huh?

1215
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:47,215
- Yo, Rock.
- Yo, Rocky.

1216
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:54,984
Yo.

1217
01:20:56,495 --> 01:20:57,553
Yo.

1218
01:20:57,629 --> 01:20:59,324
Yo, you look great.

1219
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:01,996
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1220
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:05,161
Terrific. I mean,
you could be a heartbreaker.

1221
01:21:05,237 --> 01:21:06,898
You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts,

1222
01:21:06,972 --> 01:21:09,031
the way you're lookin'...
very sharp.

1223
01:21:09,107 --> 01:21:11,541
I got... I got another surprise for you.

1224
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:12,770
What?

1225
01:21:13,612 --> 01:21:18,242
Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus!
Come here, kid! Come here!

1226
01:21:18,317 --> 01:21:19,944
To keep you company
when you run.

1227
01:21:25,524 --> 01:21:28,459
Come on in and meet the family.
The owner ever come back?

1228
01:21:28,527 --> 01:21:31,655
- He's yours. He's yours if you want him.
- Do I want him? Come here!

1229
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,561
What's he eat... this dog?

1230
01:21:33,632 --> 01:21:36,465
- He eats little turtles.
- Yo, Butkus!

1231
01:22:00,058 --> 01:22:03,960
What's that, Butkus, huh?
Whose truck is this? Come on.

1232
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:08,530
One call from me,
you're a celebrity.

1233
01:22:10,902 --> 01:22:13,837
- You're gonna need exposure.
- Oh, don't breathe on me, Paulie!

1234
01:22:13,905 --> 01:22:16,396
That's the big time!
Don't I know about these things?

1235
01:22:16,475 --> 01:22:18,705
You don't know nothin'!
What do these guys want from me?

1236
01:22:18,777 --> 01:22:20,438
To watch you train! Boom.

1237
01:22:20,512 --> 01:22:23,174
What is the matter with you, Paulie?
This was supposed to be private.

1238
01:22:23,248 --> 01:22:25,842
- I'm doin' you a favor!
- You ain't doin' me no favors!

1239
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:27,578
You're embarrassin' me
in front of everybody,

1240
01:22:27,653 --> 01:22:30,053
you make me look bad
in front of your sister...

1241
01:22:30,122 --> 01:22:33,956
You see this cigar? I'll stick it
in your ear. Don't do these things to me!

1242
01:22:34,026 --> 01:22:36,517
You should've called me up
or something... leave a message.

1243
01:22:36,595 --> 01:22:38,256
Don't do that!

1244
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:40,059
My sister really likes you.

1245
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:44,495
I'm gonna kill you one of these days,
I swear to God!

1246
01:22:44,569 --> 01:22:45,627
Come on. Come on.

1247
01:22:45,704 --> 01:22:47,831
- Baby!
- Baby.

1248
01:22:47,906 --> 01:22:51,637
Here he is, the next
heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!

1249
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:53,200
Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.

1250
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:55,872
Listen, we wanna get a brief interview
with you. It won't take long.

1251
01:22:55,947 --> 01:22:57,346
- What about me?
- What about you?

1252
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,907
- I'm in charge of the meat.
- Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?

1253
01:22:59,985 --> 01:23:02,146
Listen, just settle yourself in.
Just relax.

1254
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:05,053
What we're going to do is
just ask you a few questions, Rocky.

1255
01:23:05,123 --> 01:23:07,614
Just a few questions
about your unique training method.

1256
01:23:07,693 --> 01:23:09,024
Talk to the folks at home.

1257
01:23:09,094 --> 01:23:11,255
They really wanna know
how you got into this.

1258
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,059
I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.

1259
01:23:13,131 --> 01:23:14,621
Jimmy, you guys ready?
Let's roll.

1260
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,531
Rocky, why don't you turn
right around here.

1261
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:18,592
Just don't take no cheap shots,
you know?

1262
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:20,661
No, I won't do that.
Just relax, Rocky.

1263
01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:24,072
Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1264
01:23:24,142 --> 01:23:27,475
- The reason we're standing...
- The meat guy's stickin' his face in.

1265
01:23:28,613 --> 01:23:30,774
Let's try it again, Rocky.

1266
01:23:30,849 --> 01:23:34,683
<i>Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

1267
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:37,153
<i>The reason we're standing
in this refrigerated box</i>

1268
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:40,487
<i>is that Mr. Balboa has
an unusual method of training.</i>

1269
01:23:40,559 --> 01:23:42,390
<i>In a moment,
he's going to demonstrate that</i>

1270
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:44,122
<i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>

1271
01:23:44,196 --> 01:23:48,189
<i>But first, Rocky, how did you
come to train in an icebox?</i>

1272
01:23:48,266 --> 01:23:50,666
<i>Uh, well, my friend...
the guy over there...</i>

1273
01:23:50,736 --> 01:23:53,796
<i>let me in one day and I hit
the beef here and kinda liked it.</i>

1274
01:23:53,872 --> 01:23:57,535
<i>And since I become a challenger,
the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>

1275
01:23:57,609 --> 01:24:01,670
<i>Is this a common training method?
Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

1276
01:24:01,747 --> 01:24:03,578
<i>No, I think I invented it.</i>

1277
01:24:03,648 --> 01:24:06,981
Don't forget to confirm the reservation
for my people at ringside,

1278
01:24:07,052 --> 01:24:09,179
and be sure
to fly my barber to Philly.

1279
01:24:13,392 --> 01:24:16,225
How much is being channeled into
West Coast closed circuit advertising?

1280
01:24:16,294 --> 01:24:18,694
- $300,000.
- Make it 450.

1281
01:24:18,764 --> 01:24:20,925
And send the mayor's wife
200 roses from me,

1282
01:24:20,999 --> 01:24:24,059
and make sure we get a picture
of it for all the newspapers.

1283
01:24:24,136 --> 01:24:26,969
Do you wanna run
the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?

1284
01:24:27,038 --> 01:24:29,973
I think you could spend your money
better in Canadian publicity.

1285
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:32,373
By the way... I've got
a couple of friends up in Toronto

1286
01:24:32,444 --> 01:24:34,537
who'd probably be able
to get you a good tax break.

1287
01:24:34,613 --> 01:24:37,343
George, I like your friends.

1288
01:24:44,756 --> 01:24:46,314
Hey, Champ...

1289
01:24:46,391 --> 01:24:48,985
you oughta come look at this boy
you're gonna fight on TV.

1290
01:24:49,895 --> 01:24:51,226
Looks like he means business.

1291
01:24:51,296 --> 01:24:52,957
Yeah, I mean business, too.

1292
01:24:53,532 --> 01:24:55,363
Shirley, we got
any more coffee out there?

1293
01:24:55,434 --> 01:24:57,834
Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed.
I'll get you some right away.

1294
01:24:57,903 --> 01:25:00,371
After the fight, I may just retire
and run for emperor.

1295
01:25:01,173 --> 01:25:03,107
The arena's
the only program concession,

1296
01:25:03,175 --> 01:25:07,168
and the gross rental of the arena
is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?

1297
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:20,953
Diana Lewis, in the meat house
with southpaw Rocky Balboa.

1298
01:26:07,606 --> 01:26:09,130
And he called the reporters?

1299
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:11,801
Yeah, it threw
my whole training schedule off.

1300
01:26:11,877 --> 01:26:14,175
Don't be mad at him.
He's just trying to help.

1301
01:26:14,246 --> 01:26:17,238
Adrian, I ain't mad,
it's just that, uh,

1302
01:26:17,315 --> 01:26:19,476
when a reporter's around,
I get out of joint

1303
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:22,213
'cause they take cheap shots,
and Paulie knows that.

1304
01:26:22,888 --> 01:26:25,789
Paulie keeps askin' me
for a job all the time,

1305
01:26:25,857 --> 01:26:28,883
but he don't know nothin'
about fightin'.

1306
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,689
Are you gonna say
anything to him?

1307
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:35,361
What's to say? I just don't know
what he wants from me.

1308
01:26:37,869 --> 01:26:39,860
I don't want nothin' from you.

1309
01:26:40,872 --> 01:26:42,737
I don't want nothin' from you.

1310
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:46,467
This ain't no charity case.

1311
01:26:46,545 --> 01:26:48,035
Get outta my house.

1312
01:26:48,113 --> 01:26:49,876
It's not just your house.

1313
01:26:50,782 --> 01:26:52,443
You ain't no friend no more.

1314
01:26:53,285 --> 01:26:56,516
- Get out of my house, I just says.
- Don't talk to him like that.

1315
01:26:56,588 --> 01:26:59,079
Both of you get out of my house.

1316
01:26:59,157 --> 01:27:00,681
Yo.

1317
01:27:00,759 --> 01:27:03,125
It's cold outside, Paulie.

1318
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:14,932
I don't want you messin' her,

1319
01:27:15,006 --> 01:27:17,736
and I don't raise you
to go with this scum bum!

1320
01:27:17,809 --> 01:27:19,572
Come on! Wanna hit on me?
Come on!

1321
01:27:19,644 --> 01:27:22,636
I'll break both your arms
so they don't work for ya!

1322
01:27:26,351 --> 01:27:28,842
That's right! I'm not good enough
to meet with Gazzo...

1323
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,080
That's what I think of Gazzo!

1324
01:27:30,155 --> 01:27:32,555
Now you're a big-shot fighter
on your way up,

1325
01:27:32,624 --> 01:27:34,785
you don't even throw a crumb
to your friend Paulie!

1326
01:27:34,859 --> 01:27:37,123
When I go
and get you meat every morning!

1327
01:27:37,195 --> 01:27:39,857
You forgot that!
Then I even give you my sister, too!

1328
01:27:39,931 --> 01:27:43,094
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

1329
01:27:43,168 --> 01:27:44,897
A pig gives you the best?

1330
01:27:45,904 --> 01:27:48,566
You're such a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

1331
01:27:49,774 --> 01:27:52,004
You can't live by yourself!

1332
01:27:52,077 --> 01:27:55,569
I put you two together!
And you... don't you forget it!

1333
01:27:55,647 --> 01:27:57,137
You owe me!

1334
01:27:59,751 --> 01:28:01,912
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?!

1335
01:28:01,987 --> 01:28:04,478
You're supposed
to be good to me.

1336
01:28:04,556 --> 01:28:07,889
What do I owe you, Paulie?!
What do I owe ya?!

1337
01:28:07,959 --> 01:28:09,620
I treat you good!

1338
01:28:09,694 --> 01:28:13,130
I cook for you, I clean for you,
I pick up your dirty clothes!

1339
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:17,191
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothin'!

1340
01:28:17,268 --> 01:28:19,930
And you made me feel
like a loser!

1341
01:28:20,839 --> 01:28:22,670
I'm not a loser!

1342
01:28:22,741 --> 01:28:25,073
- You're busted!
- What?!

1343
01:28:25,143 --> 01:28:26,474
You're not a virgin!

1344
01:28:27,045 --> 01:28:30,537
You let him into your pants!
She's busted!

1345
01:28:34,019 --> 01:28:35,953
I can't haul meat no more!

1346
01:29:06,451 --> 01:29:07,941
You want a roommate?

1347
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:14,481
Absolutely.

1348
01:29:16,361 --> 01:29:18,795
Okay, now, when you
walk into the ring

1349
01:29:18,863 --> 01:29:21,354
with the number one
heavyweight of the world,

1350
01:29:21,433 --> 01:29:23,025
you'll be ready, won't ya?

1351
01:29:23,101 --> 01:29:28,266
Why? Because I waited
for 50 years to make you ready.

1352
01:29:28,339 --> 01:29:31,172
You'll be able to spit nails, kid.

1353
01:29:31,242 --> 01:29:33,403
Like the guy says,
you're gonna eat lightning

1354
01:29:33,478 --> 01:29:35,412
and you're gonna crap thunder.

1355
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,472
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

1356
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:40,711
- Yo, Mickey.
- Hey! How are ya?

1357
01:29:40,785 --> 01:29:45,188
Oh, Rock. I want you to meet
our cutman here, Al Salvani.

1358
01:29:45,256 --> 01:29:47,247
- Take a look at his eye.
- How're you doin'?

1359
01:29:47,325 --> 01:29:49,486
- That's right.
- It ain't bad. I seen worse.

1360
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:51,051
You ain't so bad yourself.

1361
01:29:51,129 --> 01:29:53,723
- Cover up. Things'll be okay.
- Cover up? You cover up.

1362
01:29:53,798 --> 01:29:55,629
Go and take a shower, will ya?

1363
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,668
Okay, Mick.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

1364
01:29:59,104 --> 01:30:01,937
You covered that Whitmar fight,
didn't you?

1365
01:30:02,006 --> 01:30:03,166
That's why you wanted me.

1366
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:06,005
Listen, we got a winner here!
We got a chance!

1367
01:30:06,077 --> 01:30:08,568
He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

1368
01:30:08,646 --> 01:30:11,979
You just stand by, boy.
We're gonna win.

1369
01:30:18,957 --> 01:30:21,824
Hey, Rock,
It's okay I talk to ya?

1370
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,987
Okay you talk to me?

1371
01:30:24,062 --> 01:30:25,120
Sure.

1372
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:28,524
I figured some angle
to make some money off your name.

1373
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,760
My name?

1374
01:30:30,502 --> 01:30:34,233
- How's that?
- Advertisin'. I know about that stuff.

1375
01:30:36,107 --> 01:30:39,099
What do you know
about advertisin'? Huh?

1376
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,910
Hey, you can make money
off my name, make it, okay?

1377
01:30:44,983 --> 01:30:46,473
I'm gonna take a shower.

1378
01:30:47,585 --> 01:30:50,418
- Wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

1379
01:31:40,905 --> 01:31:46,207
Trying hard now

1380
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:51,110
It's so hard now

1381
01:31:51,282 --> 01:31:56,447
Trying hard now

1382
01:32:26,117 --> 01:32:27,141
You're gonna kill him!

1383
01:32:36,461 --> 01:32:41,194
Getting strong now

1384
01:32:41,366 --> 01:32:46,201
Won't be long now

1385
01:32:46,371 --> 01:32:50,933
Getting strong now

1386
01:33:10,194 --> 01:33:15,188
Gonna fly now

1387
01:33:15,366 --> 01:33:20,099
Flying high now

1388
01:33:20,271 --> 01:33:25,641
Gonna fly

1389
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:28,176
Fly

1390
01:33:28,346 --> 01:33:33,613
Fly

1391
01:35:18,589 --> 01:35:22,116
Rocky.
What brings you here tonight?

1392
01:35:23,194 --> 01:35:25,662
Mr. Jergens,
the poster's wrong.

1393
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:27,061
What do you mean?

1394
01:35:27,131 --> 01:35:30,464
Well, I'm wearin' white pants
with a red stripe.

1395
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:36,771
It doesn't really matter,
does it?

1396
01:35:36,841 --> 01:35:39,207
I'm sure you're gonna give us
a great show.

1397
01:35:40,778 --> 01:35:42,769
Try to get some rest, kid.

1398
01:35:43,681 --> 01:35:44,943
Good night.

1399
01:37:16,674 --> 01:37:18,266
I can't do it.

1400
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:22,339
What?

1401
01:37:23,381 --> 01:37:25,042
I can't beat him.

1402
01:37:26,517 --> 01:37:27,779
Apollo?

1403
01:37:28,686 --> 01:37:29,846
Yeah.

1404
01:37:31,122 --> 01:37:34,285
I've been out there
walkin' around, thinkin'.

1405
01:37:36,027 --> 01:37:39,428
I mean, who am I kiddin'?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

1406
01:37:44,769 --> 01:37:46,100
What are we gonna do?

1407
01:37:57,815 --> 01:37:59,214
I don't know.

1408
01:38:05,856 --> 01:38:07,517
You worked so hard.

1409
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,952
It don't matter,
'cause I was nobody before.

1410
01:38:15,032 --> 01:38:16,329
Don't say that.

1411
01:38:17,235 --> 01:38:19,635
Oh, come on, Adrian.
It's true.

1412
01:38:19,704 --> 01:38:21,365
I was nobody.

1413
01:38:23,107 --> 01:38:25,268
But it don't matter either,
you know?

1414
01:38:27,011 --> 01:38:28,603
So, I was thinkin'...

1415
01:38:30,081 --> 01:38:32,914
It really don't matter
if I lose this fight.

1416
01:38:34,819 --> 01:38:37,982
It really don't matter
if this guy opens my head, either.

1417
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:42,619
'Cause all I wanna do
is go the distance.

1418
01:38:47,331 --> 01:38:49,925
Nobody's ever
gone the distance with Creed.

1419
01:38:51,302 --> 01:38:53,634
And if I can go that distance...

1420
01:38:54,939 --> 01:38:58,170
...see, if that bell rings
and I'm still standin'...

1421
01:39:03,114 --> 01:39:06,845
...I'm gonna know
for the first time in my life, you see...

1422
01:39:08,653 --> 01:39:12,054
...that I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood.

1423
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:21,449
Time, kid.
Let's go.

1424
01:40:24,195 --> 01:40:25,526
I'll wait for you here.

1425
01:40:28,332 --> 01:40:30,823
Or how 'bout I wait here
and you fight, huh?

1426
01:40:32,036 --> 01:40:34,527
You're lookin' very great today...
you know that?

1427
01:40:37,174 --> 01:40:40,507
I gotta go now, but, uh,
don't you leave town, huh?

1428
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,670
Wish me luck.
I'm gonna need it.

1429
01:40:44,849 --> 01:40:46,339
Good luck.

1430
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:50,080
Say, Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, huh?

1431
01:40:50,621 --> 01:40:51,679
Good luck.

1432
01:40:51,756 --> 01:40:53,087
Don't leave town.

1433
01:40:55,993 --> 01:40:59,690
<i>I'd like to have you meet my colleague
workin' the fight with me... Stu Hansen.</i>

1434
01:40:59,764 --> 01:41:00,822
Thank you, Bill Baldwin.

1435
01:41:00,898 --> 01:41:04,026
The electricity is all over
the place tonight as Rocky Balboa...

1436
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:07,330
Hey, what the hell is that?

1437
01:41:07,405 --> 01:41:09,805
I trained you to be a fighter,
not a billboard.

1438
01:41:09,874 --> 01:41:12,707
- I'm doin' it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

1439
01:41:12,777 --> 01:41:14,836
Paulie gets three grand,
I get the robe.

1440
01:41:14,912 --> 01:41:16,072
Shrewd.

1441
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:19,181
The story about tonight's fight,
their difference in style,

1442
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:21,411
you can quote a recent
sports magazine which said,

1443
01:41:21,485 --> 01:41:23,646
"Could be the caveman
against the cavalier. "

1444
01:41:23,721 --> 01:41:26,121
I noticed a buzzing
in the background now, Bill.

1445
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:28,522
<i>Could be the challengers
getting ready to get into the ring.</i>

1446
01:41:28,592 --> 01:41:31,925
Rocky! Look at my date.
Cost me $200.

1447
01:41:31,996 --> 01:41:34,487
- 250.
- I gotta go. I gotta work.

1448
01:41:34,565 --> 01:41:36,556
- How's the robe?
- It's a little baggy.

1449
01:41:37,134 --> 01:41:39,967
<i>A 50 to 1 underdog
living a Cinderella story,</i>

1450
01:41:40,037 --> 01:41:43,438
<i>and he's captured people's
imaginations all over the world.</i>

1451
01:41:48,179 --> 01:41:49,771
We love you, Rocky!

1452
01:41:49,847 --> 01:41:52,907
- Good luck, champ.
- Hey, thanks for showin' up.

1453
01:41:53,551 --> 01:41:55,382
<i>And his record... 44 victories.</i>

1454
01:41:55,453 --> 01:41:58,445
<i>He's got 38 by knockout,
and he's lost 20 fights.</i>

1455
01:41:58,522 --> 01:42:00,786
<i>Which makes me wonder,
can he stand it...</i>

1456
01:42:00,858 --> 01:42:03,258
<i>the stamina and the skill
to last the three rounds?</i>

1457
01:42:03,327 --> 01:42:05,591
<i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>

1458
01:42:05,663 --> 01:42:09,064
<i>Rocky Balboa
climbing into the ring now.</i>

1459
01:42:09,133 --> 01:42:10,794
The Italian Stallion.

1460
01:42:10,868 --> 01:42:13,132
<i>Some meat sign
on the back of his robe there.</i>

1461
01:42:13,204 --> 01:42:15,866
<i>Have you seen what that was?
Shamrock Meats, Inc.</i>

1462
01:42:16,707 --> 01:42:20,541
<i>A lot of noise coming from the back.
You could go deaf with that noise.</i>

1463
01:42:20,611 --> 01:42:22,306
<i>You have the spotlights.</i>

1464
01:42:23,481 --> 01:42:26,644
<i>Is that the world
heavyweight champion Apollo Creed?</i>

1465
01:42:26,717 --> 01:42:29,208
<i>He's in a boat... riding in a boat.</i>

1466
01:42:29,286 --> 01:42:31,015
<i>Is he supposed
to be George Washington?</i>

1467
01:42:31,088 --> 01:42:34,251
<i>Obviously so. He's got the hat on,
the whole thing. Look at that.</i>

1468
01:42:34,325 --> 01:42:35,815
<i>It's been confirmed.</i>

1469
01:42:35,893 --> 01:42:37,724
<i>The world champion Apollo Creed</i>

1470
01:42:37,795 --> 01:42:40,628
<i>is doing an imitation
of George Washington.</i>

1471
01:42:42,366 --> 01:42:44,027
<i>- He's throwing money.
- I don't believe it.</i>

1472
01:42:44,101 --> 01:42:47,468
<i>Remember we were talking about
George Washington throwing the dollar?</i>

1473
01:42:47,538 --> 01:42:48,664
<i>Throwing the dollar.</i>

1474
01:42:48,739 --> 01:42:51,799
<i>'Course, if you threw a dollar
in those days, it went a lot farther.</i>

1475
01:42:51,876 --> 01:42:53,537
<i>Oh, he's taking his...</i>

1476
01:42:53,611 --> 01:42:55,875
<i>White wig came off,
the hat came off.</i>

1477
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:02,879
<i>And the crowd is loving
every minute of it... look at that.</i>

1478
01:43:02,953 --> 01:43:04,784
Here is the world
heavyweight champion.

1479
01:43:04,855 --> 01:43:06,789
Apollo Creed...
for you around the world

1480
01:43:06,857 --> 01:43:10,088
he was dressed as George Washington,
the father of our country.

1481
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,650
I want you!

1482
01:43:15,766 --> 01:43:18,098
<i>Oh! Look at that!
Uncle Sam himself.</i>

1483
01:43:18,168 --> 01:43:19,863
I want you!

1484
01:43:19,937 --> 01:43:21,268
All of you!

1485
01:43:21,338 --> 01:43:23,203
<i>"All of you. " he's saying.</i>

1486
01:43:23,274 --> 01:43:25,139
He looks like a big flag.

1487
01:43:25,209 --> 01:43:27,700
I want you.
You.

1488
01:43:27,778 --> 01:43:30,338
- Is he talkin' to me?
- He's talkin' to you.

1489
01:43:30,514 --> 01:43:33,176
- Is he talkin' to me?
- Let him talk while he can talk.

1490
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,911
I want the Stallion!

1491
01:43:35,586 --> 01:43:37,850
<i>He says, "I want the Stallion.
I want the Stallion. "</i>

1492
01:43:39,323 --> 01:43:42,486
<i>In foreign countries,
during WWI,</i>

1493
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,495
<i>there was the picture of Uncle Sam
with his finger pointed like that.</i>

1494
01:43:45,563 --> 01:43:48,623
<i>A recruiting poster for our fellows
in the service... the Army and the Navy.</i>

1495
01:43:48,699 --> 01:43:51,691
<i>- "I want you. "
- That's what he's doing a take of.</i>

1496
01:43:51,769 --> 01:43:53,737
<i>- There he is.
- That's it, Creed.</i>

1497
01:43:53,804 --> 01:43:55,362
<i>Creed in three.</i>

1498
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:57,339
What do you think
that outfit cost?

1499
01:44:07,885 --> 01:44:10,046
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1500
01:44:11,021 --> 01:44:12,511
<i>Good evening.</i>

1501
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:14,922
<i>A very happy New Year.</i>

1502
01:44:14,992 --> 01:44:17,256
<i>Welcome to Philadelphia.</i>

1503
01:44:17,328 --> 01:44:19,819
<i>Well, everybody who's anybody
is here tonight.</i>

1504
01:44:19,897 --> 01:44:21,262
<i>Time...</i>

1505
01:44:21,932 --> 01:44:28,529
<i>Time does not permit me to introduce
the many luminaries of politics,</i>

1506
01:44:29,006 --> 01:44:33,375
<i>show business, and the sporting world
who are with us tonight.</i>

1507
01:44:33,444 --> 01:44:38,643
<i>But I would like to present
one of the immortals of pugilism,</i>

1508
01:44:38,716 --> 01:44:42,709
<i>a champion
in and out of the ring,</i>

1509
01:44:42,786 --> 01:44:48,554
<i>Philadelphia's own Smoking Joe,
the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!</i>

1510
01:44:58,736 --> 01:45:00,567
How you doin'?

1511
01:45:00,638 --> 01:45:02,629
Don't hurt him, okay?
Go light on him.

1512
01:45:02,706 --> 01:45:03,764
Come on, now.

1513
01:45:03,841 --> 01:45:05,832
<i>...he's been in his career
as a fighter.</i>

1514
01:45:05,909 --> 01:45:07,740
<i>Now he's coming over
to talk to the Champ.</i>

1515
01:45:07,811 --> 01:45:09,210
- Hey, how 'bout that?
- Hey, Joe.

1516
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:12,771
- You've been ducking me long time.
- No, Joe. You're next, Joe.

1517
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:15,648
- I want you, you understand?
- You're next, Joe!

1518
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:17,311
They must be friends.

1519
01:45:25,663 --> 01:45:27,597
Joe Frazier!

1520
01:45:27,665 --> 01:45:32,159
<i>The fight is on the way. Settle down
because it won't be long now.</i>

1521
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:37,966
<i>And now...
for the main event.</i>

1522
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,014
<i>The challenger,</i>

1523
01:45:45,082 --> 01:45:49,576
<i>white trunks,
weighing 190 pounds,</i>

1524
01:45:49,653 --> 01:45:52,144
<i>Philadelphia's favorite son,</i>

1525
01:45:52,222 --> 01:45:57,387
<i>The Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa.</i>

1526
01:46:03,901 --> 01:46:06,392
<i>And on my right,</i>

1527
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:08,631
<i>wearing red, white and blue,</i>

1528
01:46:08,706 --> 01:46:12,267
<i>weighing 210 pounds,</i>

1529
01:46:12,342 --> 01:46:15,778
<i>undefeated in 46 fights,</i>

1530
01:46:15,846 --> 01:46:18,781
<i>the master of disaster,</i>

1531
01:46:18,849 --> 01:46:22,546
<i>the undisputed,
heavyweight champion of the world</i>

1532
01:46:22,619 --> 01:46:24,780
<i>Apollo Creed.</i>

1533
01:46:26,857 --> 01:46:29,382
I want you and you.
You. You.

1534
01:46:31,762 --> 01:46:34,424
You, chump.
I want you!

1535
01:46:34,498 --> 01:46:37,661
You boys both fought in Philadelphia
before, and you know the rules.

1536
01:46:37,735 --> 01:46:40,761
No low blows,
watch your heads, no butting.

1537
01:46:40,838 --> 01:46:42,328
Shake hands now
and come out fightin'.

1538
01:46:42,406 --> 01:46:44,135
Put your hands up there, chump.

1539
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:46,199
- Come out fightin'.
- Come on. Come on.

1540
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:50,208
<i>Rocky's takin' it carefully.</i>

1541
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,943
<i>He's just going over and being calm,
it looks like from here.</i>

1542
01:46:55,052 --> 01:46:56,383
<i>There goes the big hat.</i>

1543
01:46:59,656 --> 01:47:02,819
<i>I've never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair.</i>

1544
01:47:12,069 --> 01:47:13,730
<i>And there's the bell
for round one.</i>

1545
01:47:15,105 --> 01:47:18,268
<i>The fighters come into the center
of the ring, looking at each other.</i>

1546
01:47:18,342 --> 01:47:19,673
<i>Rocky just looking.</i>

1547
01:47:19,743 --> 01:47:25,147
<i>The Champion gives one
of the left-handed jabs right there.</i>

1548
01:47:26,784 --> 01:47:30,276
<i>The Champ's stinging,
the slower challenger jabs at will.</i>

1549
01:47:30,354 --> 01:47:34,347
<i>In fact, it just looks like Rocky's
blocking the blows with his face.</i>

1550
01:47:34,424 --> 01:47:36,756
<i>The Champion doesn't look
the best he's ever been,</i>

1551
01:47:36,827 --> 01:47:38,522
<i>but he's really moving now.</i>

1552
01:47:38,595 --> 01:47:40,756
<i>Well, the Champion
is smiling now.</i>

1553
01:47:40,831 --> 01:47:42,230
<i>He's toying with this man.</i>

1554
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,191
Trying to give the fans
their money's worth.

1555
01:47:47,905 --> 01:47:51,068
<i>He's very clearly outdoing
the challenger right now.</i>

1556
01:47:51,909 --> 01:47:53,740
I'll get you. Come on.

1557
01:47:53,811 --> 01:47:57,645
<i>He's just trying to make this man
make him... see! Make him miss like that.</i>

1558
01:47:59,149 --> 01:48:01,640
<i>Oh, the Champ
is just taunting him now.</i>

1559
01:48:04,855 --> 01:48:06,345
<i>He's dancing around.</i>

1560
01:48:07,858 --> 01:48:09,758
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

1561
01:48:09,827 --> 01:48:12,125
<i>- The Champ is down.
- Yes, he is!</i>

1562
01:48:18,168 --> 01:48:21,569
<i>Creed is down!
What a surprise this is!</i>

1563
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:25,972
<i>This is the first time the Champion
has ever been knocked down.</i>

1564
01:48:28,145 --> 01:48:31,410
Six... seven... eight.

1565
01:48:31,481 --> 01:48:34,177
<i>Appears to be all right.
A little glassy-eyed, but okay.</i>

1566
01:48:36,086 --> 01:48:39,146
Let's go to work right now, Rock!
Come on!

1567
01:48:40,424 --> 01:48:43,757
<i>Now Rocky coming back out,
and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i>

1568
01:48:43,827 --> 01:48:45,158
<i>He really wants it.</i>

1569
01:48:47,364 --> 01:48:49,025
<i>Boy, the Champion's
coming back.</i>

1570
01:48:49,099 --> 01:48:52,262
<i>He's coming off the floor now,
and he's trying...</i>

1571
01:48:52,336 --> 01:48:54,998
<i>A left, a right, another left,
another right, combination!</i>

1572
01:48:55,072 --> 01:48:57,905
<i>Into the face!
And that's the Apollo we know.</i>

1573
01:49:01,879 --> 01:49:03,210
<i>Now he's taunting him.</i>

1574
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,373
<i>He's taunting Rocky.
"Come on, let's go. "</i>

1575
01:49:05,449 --> 01:49:06,814
<i>Left. There's another left.</i>

1576
01:49:07,684 --> 01:49:08,742
<i>Another left.</i>

1577
01:49:10,587 --> 01:49:12,350
<i>There!</i>

1578
01:49:13,824 --> 01:49:16,156
<i>Left and right.
Rocky's got him on the rope!</i>

1579
01:49:16,226 --> 01:49:17,386
Come on.

1580
01:49:17,461 --> 01:49:18,792
Okay, break.

1581
01:49:18,862 --> 01:49:20,523
Punch. Hit me. Hit me.

1582
01:49:24,201 --> 01:49:27,364
<i>I tell you, there's no way we expected
this kind of hitting from him.</i>

1583
01:49:27,437 --> 01:49:29,632
<i>Oh, no way,
but with the ability of the Champion...</i>

1584
01:49:34,444 --> 01:49:37,436
<i>Apollo unloading a left, really
trying to get him up against the ropes.</i>

1585
01:49:46,256 --> 01:49:48,781
<i>They're leading him over to his corner.
Rocky can hardly find his way.</i>

1586
01:49:48,859 --> 01:49:50,952
<i>He's sitting down now.</i>

1587
01:49:51,028 --> 01:49:52,723
I told ya! I told ya!

1588
01:49:52,796 --> 01:49:54,127
Your nose is broke.

1589
01:49:54,197 --> 01:49:56,563
- How's it look?
- Ah, it's an improvement.

1590
01:49:56,633 --> 01:50:00,000
I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.
I want you to stick and move.

1591
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:03,562
Go for the ribs.
Don't let that bastard breathe.

1592
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,039
The guy's great.

1593
01:50:05,108 --> 01:50:09,101
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

1594
01:50:09,179 --> 01:50:11,773
Finish this bum and let's go home.

1595
01:50:12,282 --> 01:50:15,115
Stay to the body. The body!
You're doing great!

1596
01:50:18,755 --> 01:50:20,416
<i>Creed got knocked down
at the end of the first.</i>

1597
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:24,085
<i>He came back strong at the end
of the first, but he's working hard.</i>

1598
01:50:24,161 --> 01:50:27,324
<i>A smart left.
Another left and a right.</i>

1599
01:50:27,397 --> 01:50:29,922
<i>And now coming
into the corner again.</i>

1600
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,105
<i>Oh, Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.</i>

1601
01:50:45,349 --> 01:50:47,283
Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?

1602
01:50:47,351 --> 01:50:50,343
Stop clownin' around here
and give these people something to see.

1603
01:50:52,089 --> 01:50:53,579
<i>He says he wants him!</i>

1604
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:58,855
<i>If you folks aren't aware... you're
watching a battle... I tell you that.</i>

1605
01:51:03,367 --> 01:51:04,732
<i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i>

1606
01:51:04,801 --> 01:51:06,962
<i>Oh! He tagged the Champ
with a tremendous hook!</i>

1607
01:51:07,037 --> 01:51:09,369
<i>The Champion is trying
to get himself out of there,</i>

1608
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:10,997
<i>but he just can't do it.</i>

1609
01:51:11,074 --> 01:51:14,202
<i>He is being barraged with lefts
and rights to the head, to the body.</i>

1610
01:51:14,277 --> 01:51:18,236
<i>Balboa is smacking the Champion
right on the kisser.</i>

1611
01:51:19,082 --> 01:51:22,643
<i>And the referee's... they're ready
to keep going. Look at that!</i>

1612
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:25,153
- Back to your corner.
- Put that chump back in his corner.

1613
01:51:25,222 --> 01:51:27,918
<i>- Come on, Creed.
- Balboa doesn't want to quit. Hey.</i>

1614
01:51:27,991 --> 01:51:29,583
<i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>

1615
01:52:24,214 --> 01:52:26,546
<i>Now he's got him. A left.</i>

1616
01:52:36,726 --> 01:52:38,990
<i>A hard left
and a right combination.</i>

1617
01:52:39,062 --> 01:52:41,826
<i>What is keeping him up, Bill?
I don't know.</i>

1618
01:52:44,601 --> 01:52:46,796
<i>He can't even get his gloves up
to protect himself.</i>

1619
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:48,701
<i>He needs to stop, Bill.</i>

1620
01:52:54,611 --> 01:52:56,943
Down! Down!
Stay down!

1621
01:52:57,013 --> 01:52:59,345
<i>Apollo dancing around
with his arms in the air.</i>

1622
01:53:10,093 --> 01:53:13,358
...five... six...

1623
01:53:14,431 --> 01:53:18,060
seven... eight... nine...

1624
01:53:27,577 --> 01:53:29,408
<i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>

1625
01:53:46,563 --> 01:53:49,896
<i>The Champion got a left
to the ribs... his right rib.</i>

1626
01:53:49,966 --> 01:53:52,127
<i>Oh, this has been
a tremendous...</i>

1627
01:53:57,941 --> 01:54:00,432
- Okay, Champ?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1628
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:03,343
It hurts, though.
He broke my rib.

1629
01:54:03,413 --> 01:54:05,643
I can't see nothin'.
You gotta open my eye.

1630
01:54:05,715 --> 01:54:07,546
- Cut me, Mick.
- I don't wanna do it!

1631
01:54:07,617 --> 01:54:10,484
Go on, cut me.
Cut me.

1632
01:54:10,554 --> 01:54:12,283
Try it.

1633
01:54:16,293 --> 01:54:17,783
Oh, God.

1634
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:20,295
You're bleeding inside, Champ.
I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?

1635
01:54:20,363 --> 01:54:23,764
You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.
You ain't stoppin' nothin'.

1636
01:54:23,833 --> 01:54:26,666
- You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.
- All right.

1637
01:54:26,736 --> 01:54:30,467
- Go if you wanna go.
- I'm goin'.

1638
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:33,373
You gotta go.
You gotta give it all. Give it all!

1639
01:54:33,443 --> 01:54:35,604
You gotta get him.
You gotta work on that body.

1640
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:43,042
<i>The crowd is on fire.
The 15th and final round.</i>

1641
01:54:51,795 --> 01:54:54,195
<i>They look like they've been
in a war... these two.</i>

1642
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:05,831
<i>Oh, the Champion
really tagged him!</i>

1643
01:55:05,909 --> 01:55:09,640
<i>And Apollo clearly protecting
his right side... his ribs.</i>

1644
01:55:15,018 --> 01:55:16,610
<i>Hard left and right!</i>

1645
01:55:16,686 --> 01:55:20,178
<i>- Look at the blood coming from his face.
- Oh, he's spitting up blood now.</i>

1646
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,627
<i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>

1647
01:55:26,696 --> 01:55:28,163
Go for it! Go for it, Rock!

1648
01:55:28,231 --> 01:55:30,995
<i>Listen to this crowd!</i>

1649
01:55:31,067 --> 01:55:34,867
<i>Oh! Another to the rib.
That left hand again right to the chin!</i>

1650
01:55:34,938 --> 01:55:36,735
<i>Oh! He's got him
up against the ropes!</i>

1651
01:55:36,806 --> 01:55:37,864
<i>Apollo the Champ.</i>

1652
01:55:42,312 --> 01:55:45,145
Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

1653
01:55:45,849 --> 01:55:47,009
Don't want one.

1654
01:55:57,694 --> 01:56:00,322
Rocky, you went the 15 rounds.
How do you feel?

1655
01:56:00,397 --> 01:56:01,455
I feel all right.

1656
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:03,522
What were you thinking about
when that buzzer sounded?

1657
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,090
Adrian!

1658
01:56:05,168 --> 01:56:07,659
What? Adrian!

1659
01:56:07,737 --> 01:56:09,227
Rocky?

1660
01:56:09,372 --> 01:56:10,566
Rocky?

1661
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:13,131
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please...</i>

1662
01:56:13,209 --> 01:56:14,403
Rocky?

1663
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,044
Rocky!

1664
01:56:17,113 --> 01:56:21,447
<i>You've had the privilege
of witnessing the greatest exhibition</i>

1665
01:56:21,518 --> 01:56:25,682
<i>of guts and stamina
in the history of the ring.</i>

1666
01:56:25,755 --> 01:56:27,746
Adrian!

1667
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:30,225
Rocky!

1668
01:56:30,293 --> 01:56:32,352
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1669
01:56:32,429 --> 01:56:34,920
<i>we have a split decision.</i>

1670
01:56:38,335 --> 01:56:39,996
Adrian!

1671
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:41,401
Rocky!

1672
01:56:41,471 --> 01:56:42,961
<i>...for Creed.</i>

1673
01:56:45,642 --> 01:56:48,975
- No plans out there for a rematch?
- Ain't gonna be a rematch.

1674
01:56:49,045 --> 01:56:52,310
Oh, come on.
I don't know yet, okay?

1675
01:56:52,382 --> 01:56:53,906
You heard him, ladies and...

1676
01:56:53,983 --> 01:56:57,316
Rocko! That's my friend. Rocko!

1677
01:56:57,387 --> 01:57:00,083
- Hey, you're breakin' the jacket.
- Let's go, Buddy. Come on.

1678
01:57:00,156 --> 01:57:01,555
Paulie?

1679
01:57:01,624 --> 01:57:04,115
- Adrian? Adrian!
- Rocky!

1680
01:57:04,194 --> 01:57:06,458
Adrian!
Hey, where's your hat?

1681
01:57:06,529 --> 01:57:09,491
I love you.

1682
01:57:09,632 --> 01:57:11,497
- I love you!
- I love you.

1683
01:57:13,203 --> 01:57:14,363
I love you.

1684

I love you.
