1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,903
God, you guys are so smart.
It's like a brain factory in here.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,735
-I got some ideas too this morning.
-He got really, really good ones.

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,309
You know, in a Donald sort of way.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,107
I'm putting--
Hey! What?

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,252
I'm putting in a chase sequence.
So the killer...

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,821
...flees on horseback with the girl.
The cop's after them on a motorcycle.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,652
And it's like a battle between
motors and horses.

8
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,590
Like technology versus horse.

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,095
And they're still all one person, right?

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,724
Well, that's the big payoff.

11
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,699
-lt sounds exciting.
-Thanks, man.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,897
-Thanks.
-See, I told you he was gonna like it.

13
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:46,309
-You're my muse. You are.
-I love being your muse.

14
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,306
I'm so happy about that.

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,208
I'm picking up an order for Kaufman.

16
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,338
-Valerie.
-Hi, Charlie.

17
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,440
It's quite a coincidence
bumping into you.

18
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,236
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I was away last week.

19
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,379
-That's okay.
-I meant to because...

20
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,015
...things are going really well now,
and I wanted you to know.

21
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,310
Well, that's great.
I'm anxious to see something.

22
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,045
You should sit down because
I'm here with Susan right now.

23
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,883
And she's dying to meet you,
so it's funny bumping into you.

24
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,388
-Have a seat.
-Susan Orlean is here?

25
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:37,462
Yeah, she's here in town for a reading
or something. She's just on the phone.

26
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,195
Sit down. Have a seat.
She's dying to meet you.

27
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,601
Well, I should probably go, because....

28
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,604
Well, I'd love to meet her too...

29
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,801
...but I don't want to be beholden.
And, well--

30
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,811
Because once you meet somebody
that you've been writing about...

31
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,415
...it becomes very hard to separate.
So....

32
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,246
Well, okay, I'll speak to you soon.
And I'm almost done.

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,409
I'm almost done.

34
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,557
And tell Susan that I would
love to meet with her at a future date.

35
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,316
-As she sees fit.
-Okay.

36
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,826
Who am I kidding?
This is not Susan Orlean's story.

37
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,558
I have no connection with her.
I can't even meet her.

38
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,760
I have no understanding of anything
but my own panic and self-loathing...

39
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,461
...and pathetic, little existence.

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,632
The only thing I'm actually qualified to
write about is myself and my own self--

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,368
We open on Charlie Kaufman.

42
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,447
Fat, old, bald, repulsive, sitting in
a Hollywood restaurant...

43
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:34,644
...across from Valerie Thomas,
a lovely, statuesque film executive.

44
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,654
Kaufman, trying to get
a writing assignment...

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,850
...wanting to impress her,
sweats profusely.

46
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,463
Fat, bald Kaufman paces furiously
in his bedroom.

47
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:53,197
He speaks into his hand-held
tape recorder, and he says:

48
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,005
"Charlie Kaufman, fat, bald,
repulsive, old...

49
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,669
...sits at a Hollywood restaurant
with Valerie Thomas."

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,610
Kaufman, repugnant, ridiculous...

51
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,012
...jerks off to the book jacket photo
of Susan Or--

52
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,942
What do you want?

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,712
I've finished my script.

54
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,989
I'm done.

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,719
So would you show it to your agent?

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,291
It's called The Three.

57
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,200
Thanks. I also want to
thank you for your idea.

58
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,431
It was very helpful.
I changed it a little.

59
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:32,237
Now the killer cuts off body pieces
and makes his victims eat them.

60
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,643
Caroline has this great tattoo of a snake
swallowing its own tail, and--

61
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,875
-Ourobouros.
-I don't know what that means.

62
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,282
The snake. It's called Ourobouros.

63
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,821
I don't think so. But it's cool for my
killer to have this modus operandi...

64
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,824
...because when he forces the woman
who's really him to eat herself...

65
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,655
...he's also eating himself to death.

66
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,160
I'm insane.

67
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,428
-I'm Ourobouros.
-I don't know what that word means.

68
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,401
-I've written myself into my screenplay.
-That's kind of weird, huh?

69
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,472
It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic.

70
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,109
It's solipsistic. It's pathetic.

71
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,245
I'm pathetic.
I'm fat and pathetic.

72
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,973
I'm sure you had good reasons, Charles.
You're an artist.

73
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,346
It's because I'm too timid to speak to
the woman who wrote the book.

74
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,384
Because I'm pathetic.

75
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:19,548
Because I have no idea how to write.
Because I can't make flowers fascinating.

76
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,716
Because I suck.

77
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,863
-Hey, am I in the script?
-I'm going to New York.

78
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,457
I'll meet her. That's it.
That's what I have to do.

79
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,330
Don't get mad at me for saying this...

80
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,801
...but Bob's having a seminar
in New York this weekend.

81
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,803
So if you're stuck....

82
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:35,742
And she said,
"Laroche is such a fun character."

83
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,508
And she said,
"Laroche is such a fun character."

84
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,011
No shit, I'm a fun character.

85
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,443
Who's gonna play me?

86
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,777
Well, I've gotta write
the book first, John.

87
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,785
Then, you know, they get somebody
to write the screenplay.

88
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,185
Hey, I think I should play me.

89
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,858
Most people yearn for something
exceptional, something so inspiring...

90
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,161
...that they'd want to risk everything
for that passion, but few would act on it.

91
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,498
It was very powerful...

92
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:10,006
...and it's intoxicating to be
around someone so alive.

93
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,111
Come on, just follow me.
They're right nearby.

94
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,970
Okay.

95
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,357
Can I ask you a personal question?

96
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,258
Look, we're not lost.

97
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,150
I've done this a million times.

98
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,552
When everything is killing me, I just say,
"Screw it," and go straight ahead.

99
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,259
Oh, fuck....

100
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,308
Sundial.

101
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,335
I'll just set this up,
we'll wait a few minutes...

102
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,641
...and then we'll be able to tell
which way the sun's moving.

103
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,376
We should be headed southeast.

104
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,117
So, you collect anything?

105
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,158
Not really, no.

106
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,294
Yeah, well, you know...

107
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,195
...it's not really about
collecting the thing.

108
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,769
It's about being able....

109
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,573
The thing about computers,
the thing I like...

110
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,267
...is that I'm immersed in them...

111
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:57,144
...but it's not like a living thing
that's gonna leave or die or something.

112
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,820
-John, I'm sorry. I just--
-Okay.

113
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,628
-I don't--
-Hey. Okay.

114
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,423
Fuck the sundial.

115
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,589
I know how to get out of here.
I know how to get out of here.

116
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,668
I know this swamp like
the back of my goddamn hand.

117
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,431
You're just like everybody else.
Fucking leeches.

118
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,599
You just attach yourself to me
and suck me dry, spit me out.

119
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,008
Why don't you get your own fucking life?
Your own fucking interests?

120
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,649
Fucking spoiled bitch.

121
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:41,518
Life seemed to be filled with things
that were just like the ghost orchid.

122
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:46,131
Wonderful to imagine
and easy to fall in love with...

123
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,233
...but a little fantastic...

124
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,199
...and fleeting...

125
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,735
...and out of reach.

126
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,217
"--but a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

127
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,852
Hello?

128
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,958
Hey, it's Marty. How's it going?

129
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,959
Has it been helpful talking to the writer?
What's her name?

130
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,427
Susan Orlean. It's been okay.

131
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,060
Well, I mean, are you making headway?

132
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,260
Valerie's breathing down my neck.

133
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:10,174
-You can't rush inspiration.
-Okay. All right. Fair enough.

134
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,744
Listen, the other reason
I called was The Three.

135
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,980
It's just amazing.

136
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,207
-I don't know what that is.
-Donald's script.

137
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,082
A smart, edgy thriller.
It's the best script I've read all year.

138
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,096
-Good.
-Yeah, I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.

139
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,960
Two fucking talented guys in one family.

140
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,729
In fact, maybe you could get your
brother to help you with the orchid thing.

141
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:43,637
-Marty, don't say that. I mean--
-All right. It's just a thought, buddy.

142
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,404
I mean, he's really
goddamn amazing at structure.

143
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,878
-I have to go.
-All right. Adios, amigo.

144
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,311
Finish that--

145
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,088
Fuck!

146
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,796
Okay, thank you, thank you.

147
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,698
We have a long three days ahead.

148
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:16,365
Years from now, you'll be at a posh
cocktail party congratulating yourself...

149
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:22,276
...on how you spent a weekend with
an asshole from Hollywood for your art.

150
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,774
-I am pathetic. I am a loser.
-So...

151
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,283
...what is the substance of writing?

152
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,753
I have failed. I am panicked.
I have sold out. I am worthless.

153
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,688
I-- What the fuck am I doing here?

154
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,851
What the fuck am I doing here? Fuck!

155
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,261
It is my weakness, my ultimate lack
of conviction that brings me here.

156
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,335
Easy answers,
rules to shortcut yourself to success.

157
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,734
And here I am because my jaunt
into the abyss brought me nothing.

158
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,001
Well, isn't that just the risk one takes
for attempting something new?

159
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:55,011
I should leave right now. I'll start over.
I need to face this project head-on--

160
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,639
And God help you if you use
voice-over in your work, my friends.

161
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:02,379
God help you.
It's flaccid, sloppy writing.

162
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,458
Any idiot can write voice-over narration
to explain the thoughts of the character.

163
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,389
Okay, that's it.
One hour for lunch.

164
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,500
You cannot have a protagonist
without desire.

165
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,332
It doesn't make any sense.
Any fucking sense.

166
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,969
You follow? Good.

167
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,608
Anyone else?

168
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:35,749
What if a writer is attempting to create
a story where nothing much happens?

169
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,254
Where people don't change,
they don't have any epiphanies.

170
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,156
They struggle and are frustrated,
and nothing is resolved.

171
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,490
More a reflection of the real world.

172
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,861
The real world?

173
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,595
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,896
The real fucking world.

175
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,734
First of all, you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis...

176
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,103
...you'll bore your audience to tears.

177
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,974
Secondly, nothing happens in the world?

178
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,780
Are you out of your fucking mind?

179
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,877
People are murdered every day.

180
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,186
There's genocide, war, corruption.

181
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,986
Every fucking day,
somewhere in the world...

182
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,561
...somebody sacrifices his life
to save somebody else.

183
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,131
Every fucking day, someone somewhere
takes a conscious decision...

184
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,768
...to destroy someone else.

185
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,200
People find love. People lose it.

186
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,968
Christ, a child watches a mother
beaten to death on the steps of a church.

187
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,610
Someone goes hungry.

188
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,077
Somebody else betrays
his best friend for a woman.

189
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,049
If you can't find that stuff in life...

190
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,449
...then you, my friend,
don't know crap about life!

191
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:48,287
And why the fuck are you wasting
my two precious hours with your movie?

192
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,254
I don't have any use for it!

193
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,059
I don't have any bloody use for it!

194
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,269
Okay, thanks.

195
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,374
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

196
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,873
No. Thank you.

197
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,078
Thank you so much, Mr. McKee.

198
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,273
This course makes you look at writing
in a whole different way.

199
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,718
-Mr. McKee.
-Yes?

200
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,187
I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

201
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,088
I need more.

202
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,797
I'm the one who thought
things didn't happen in life.

203
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,596
Right. Okay.

204
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,962
-Nice to see you.
-I need to talk.

205
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,306
Mr. McKee, my even
standing here is very scary.

206
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,805
I don't meet people well.

207
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,536
But what you said this morning
shook me to the bone.

208
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,942
What you said was bigger than
my screenwriting choices.

209
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,413
It was about my choices
as a human being. Please.

210
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,944
Yeah.

211
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,381
Well, you know...

212
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,322
...I could sure use a drink, my friend.

213
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:01,326
"--but a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

214
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,400
Then what happens?

215
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,205
Well, that's the end of the book.

216
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,000
I wanted to present it simply...

217
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,109
...without big character arcs
or sensationalizing the story.

218
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,371
I wanted to show flowers
as God's miracles.

219
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:18,482
I wanted to show that Orlean
never saw the blooming ghost orchid.

220
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,346
It was about disappointment.

221
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,887
I see.

222
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,015
That's not a movie.

223
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,620
You gotta go back, put in the drama.

224
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:37,030
I can't go back. I've got pages of
false starts and wrong approaches.

225
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,330
-I'm way past my deadline.
-I'll tell you a secret.

226
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,906
A last act makes a film.

227
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,936
Wow them in the end,
and you got a hit.

228
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,777
You can have flaws, problems,
but wow them in the end...

229
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,280
...and you've got a hit.

230
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,782
Find an ending.
But don't cheat.

231
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,326
And don't you dare bring in
a deus ex machina.

232
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,129
Your characters must change...

233
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,030
...and the change must come from them.

234
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,504
Do that and you'll be fine.

235
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,072
You promise?

236
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,813
Mr. McKee.

237
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,654
-Have you taken my course before?
-My brother did.

238
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,191
My twin brother, Donald.
He's the one who got me to come.

239
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,625
-Twin screenwriters?
-Yeah.

240
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,755
Well, Julius and Philip Epstein...

241
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,698
...who wrote Casablanca...

242
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,805
-...they were twins
-You mentioned that in class.

243
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,706
Finest screenplay ever written.

244
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,937
Great writers' residence.

245
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,603
-Donald.
-Hey, how's your trip going?

246
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,409
You getting it on with that
lady journalist, you dog you?

247
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,744
Yeah.

248
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,245
Listen, I'm just calling to say
congratulations on your script.

249
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:08,291
Isn't that cool? Marty says he can
get me high-sixes against a mil-five.

250
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,957
That's great, Donald.

251
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,599
I want to thank you for all your help.

252
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,394
I wasn't any help.

253
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,763
Come on,
you let me stay in your place.

254
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,031
And your integrity
inspired me to even try.

255
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,939
It's been a wild ride.

256
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,135
Catherine says
she wants to play Cassie.

257
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,143
Oh, please!

258
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,306
Please, Donald?

259
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,950
Catherine Keener?

260
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,955
-Catherine Keener's in my house?
-Yeah, we're playing Boggle.

261
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,920
She's so great. You should really
hang out with her, Charles.

262
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,653
Yeah. Look....

263
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,629
I've been thinking.

264
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,964
Maybe you'd be interested in hanging
out with me for a few days in New York.

265
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,231
Oh, my God, yes.

266
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,567
Yeah?

267
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,972
I was gonna show my script
to some people...

268
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,978
...and, well, maybe you could
read it too, you know, if you like.

269
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,673
Of course. I'd be flattered.

270
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,952
Okay.

271
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,952
Thanks, Charles.

272
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,420
Okay, bye.

273
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,231
So, like, what would you do?

274
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,632
The script kind of makes fun of me, huh?

275
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,142
-I'm sorry. I was trying something--
-Hey, I don't mind. It's funny.

276
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,473
Good. Okay.

277
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,206
So, what would you do?

278
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,221
You and me are so different, Charles.
We're different talents.

279
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,878
I know. Just for fun...

280
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,252
...how would the great Donald
end this script?

281
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,327
Shut up. "The great Donald."

282
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,332
I feel like you're missing something.

283
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,030
-All right. Like what?
-Look.

284
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,005
I did a little research on the airplane.

285
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,376
"Sometimes this kind of story turns out
to be something more...

286
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,914
...some glimpse of life that expands...

287
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,917
...Iike those Japanese paper balls
you drop in water...

288
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,682
...and they bloom into flowers
and the flower is so marvelous...

289
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,883
...you can't believe there was a time
all you saw in front of you...

290
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,028
...was a paper ball and a glass of water."

291
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,927
Well, first of all, that's inconsistent.
She said she didn't care about flowers.

292
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,365
-For God's sake, it's just a metaphor.
-Well, but for what?

293
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,600
What turned that paper ball into
a flower? It's not in the book, Charles.

294
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,174
-I don't know. You're reaching.
-Maybe.

295
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,575
But I think you actually need to speak
to this woman. To know her.

296
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,807
I can't.

297
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,443
-Really.
-I'll go.

298
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,380
I'll pretend I'm you.

299
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,356
I want to do it, Charles.

300
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,188
We'll get to the bottom of this.
We're gonna fix your movie, bro.

301
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,462
But you've gotta be exactly me.

302
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,059
I have a reputation to maintain.

303
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,031
You can't be a goofball.
You can't be an asshole.

304
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,107
-I'm not an asshole.
-You know what I mean.

305
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,574
No flirting. No bad jokes.

306
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,009
Don't laugh how you laugh.

307
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:20,208
I'm not gonna laugh.
I get to have people think I'm you.

308
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,977
It's an honor.

309
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,453
So I guess I'll bring out
the big guns now.

310
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,288
Do you keep in touch with Laroche?

311
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:38,596
I felt I detected an attraction to him
in the subtext. Care to comment?

312
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,900
Well, our relationship
was strictly reporter-subject.

313
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:51,277
I mean, certainly an intimacy does
evolve in this kind of relationship.

314
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,944
By definition, I was so interested
in everything he had to say.

315
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,319
But the relationship ends
when the book ends.

316
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,025
-Mendacious deceit.
-What?

317
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,530
Nothing.

318
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,661
I just have one more question.

319
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,070
If you could have dinner with one
historical personage, living or dead...

320
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,710
...who would it be?

321
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,113
Well, I would have to say...

322
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,410
...Einstein.

323
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,885
Or Jesus.

324
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,085
Very good.

325
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,724
Interesting answer.

326
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,563
-She's lying.
-What do you mean?

327
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,529
-What happened?
-Nothing. She said everything right.

328
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,427
-Too right.
-Well, maybe because they're true.

329
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,034
Did you embarrass me?

330
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,334
People who answer questions
too right are liars.

331
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,809
And everybody says Jesus and Einstein.
That's a prepackaged answer.

332
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,247
-"Jesus and Einstein"?
-Listen, Charles, I have an idea.

333
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,476
You'll need to buy me
a pair of binoculars.

334
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,244
What's "Jesus and Einstein"?

335
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,918
Come on.

336
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,956
Sing with me.

337
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,159
What the hell
do you need binoculars for?

338
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,938
Let's go, let's go.

339
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,567
She hung up the phone.
She's upset.

340
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,802
Stop watching her.
Leave her alone.

341
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,707
She's crying.

342
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,546
She's at her computer.

343
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,618
This is morally reprehensible.

344
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,549
United...

345
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,646
...to Miami.

346
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,549
Eleven...

347
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,252
...fifty-five a.m. tomorrow.

348
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,199
-I thought she was done with Laroche.
-Her parents live in Florida.

349
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,892
That was no parent phone call,
my friend.

350
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,468
Don't say "my friend."

351
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,298
A guy entering.

352
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,137
Handsome.

353
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,642
Must be her husband.

354
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,978
She's acting weird
with him, though, right?

355
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,948
Don't you think?

356
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,250
What's she hiding from him?

357
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,361
Maybe she's a lesbian
and doesn't know how to tell him.

358
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,826
What do you think?

359
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,196
Have you checked out
Laroche's porn site?

360
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,267
No. I'm trying to read.

361
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,461
Anyway, I'm gonna look
at the porn site.

362
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,435
Research.

363
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,172
-Don't tell my old lady.
-You mean Mom?

364
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,935
No, I don't mean Mom.

365
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,245
I still say we should go
to Miami tomorrow.

366
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,405
Forget it.

367
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,778
Some of these chicks look okay.

368
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,147
Hey, guess what.
We're going to Miami tomorrow.

369
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:47,087
-I said, no.
-I said, oh, yeah, baby. Come here.

370
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:11,543
What I came to understand
is that change is not a choice.

371
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,709
Not for a species of plant,
and not for me.

372
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,846
It happens, and you are different.

373
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,190
Maybe the only distinction
between the plant and me...

374
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,956
...is that afterward,
I lied about my change.

375
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,624
I lied in my book.
I pretended with my husband...

376
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,532
...that everything was the same.

377
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:37,163
But something happened
in the swamp that day.

378
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,674
Hey, look.

379
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,173
I told you I'd find
the jewel of the Fakahatchee.

380
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,890
It's a flower.

381
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,256
Just a flower.

382
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,655
Well, might as well grab it.

383
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,662
Long as I'm here.

384
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,701
Oh, man.

385
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,252
Boy, my porn site's gonna be big.

386
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,624
Look, something I didn't tell you...

387
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,255
...that I want to tell you about the ghost.
Okay?

388
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,766
I think it might help you.

389
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,268
I'd just started at the nursery.

390
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,240
And I went back one night
to pick up something.

391
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,658
They wanted the ghost
just to extract the drug.

392
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,134
It had been a ceremonial thing...

393
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,138
...but the young guys, you know,
they liked to get stoned.

394
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,707
So Matthew...?

395
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,038
-He was one of the guys who--?
-Sure.

396
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,975
Matthew lived on that shit
till they ran out.

397
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:27,141
Because there was this one day
he was fascinated by me.

398
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,722
By my hair and my sadness.

399
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,859
Yeah, well, it does that.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

400
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:40,623
I mean, I think you'd like it, Susie.
It seems to help people be fascinated.

401
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,860
You know, I can extract it for you.
I know how. I watched.

402
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,731
I'm probably the only white guy
who knows.

403
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,531
I want to do this, Susie.

404
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,341
I'm done with orchids, Laroche.

405
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,127
-Hello?
-Hi.

406
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,855
It's John.

407
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,296
Did you get my package?

408
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:24,995
John?

409
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,661
John!

410
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,371
Johnny.

411
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,404
-Hey, John?
-Yeah?

412
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,349
Very happy now.

413
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,388
Well, I'm glad.

414
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,757
Very happy.

415
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,657
Will you go like this--?

416
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,036
No. Keep going.

417
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,053
No. No.

418
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm trying to make a dial tone.
And you have to sustain.

419
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,454
And then I will join you, and together--

420
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,861
-See, I can't do it by myself.
-Which one do you want me to do?

421
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,364
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-Okay. Here we go.

422
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,210
-That's it.
-We got it.

423
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,874
We got it. That's fucking amazing.

424
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,254
Do you ever get
lonely sometimes, Johnny?

425
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,684
Well, I was a weird kid.

426
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,160
Nobody liked me.

427
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,794
But I had this idea...

428
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,397
...if I waited long
enough, someone would...

429
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,736
...come around and just...

430
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:16,077
...you know, understand me.

431
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,754
Like my mom.

432
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,285
Except someone else.

433
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:36,999
She'd look at me and quietly say:

434
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,331
"Yes. "

435
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,465
Just like that.

436
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,504
And I wouldn't be alone anymore.

437
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,827
I wish I were an ant.

438
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,762
They're so shiny.

439
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,930
You're shinier than any ant, darling.

440
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:20,608
That's the sweetest thing
anybody has ever said to me.

441
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,006
Well...

442
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,547
...I like you, that's why.

443
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,451
Hey.

444
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,260
I don't have time for that.

445
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:32,039
I'll get a closer look. You wait here.

446
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,287
No, wait!

447
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,026
I should go.

448
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,093
I mean, it should be me, right?

449
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,563
I mean...

450
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,465
...it's my....

451
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,396
-I was, you know--
-Go for it, bro.

452
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,369
You're the man.

453
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,171
Rip them.

454
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,204
Just rip them.

455
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,423
Darling, I don't know
what's come over you.

456
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:33,768
You came all over me last time
I was here, as I recall.

457
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,455
Goddamn!

458
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,100
Hey! Fuck.

459
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,698
Get in here!

460
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,863
Shut the fuck up, now!
Sit the fuck down!

461
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,467
-Who is that, Johnny?
-Who the fuck are you?

462
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,304
I just--
Nobody.

463
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,210
-I just-- I'm just--
-Wait a minute, wait a minute.

464
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,349
He's that screenwriter.

465
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:26,145
-The guy that's adapting our book?
-Yeah.

466
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,784
Well, that's wild.

467
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,827
It's nice to meet you.

468
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,828
Hey, dude...

469
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:41,028
-...who's gonna play me?
-I don't know that. I should--

470
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,332
Well, I thought I should play me.

471
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,770
Why--?

472
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,638
-Did he follow me?
-No, of course not. I should go.

473
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,077
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
it was nice to meet you...

474
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,342
...but let me give you my number.

475
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,749
I'm really freaking here, Johnny.
Why is he here?

476
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,813
Why did he follow me?

477
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,417
-What does he know?
-I don't know anything about anything.

478
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,061
-He did see the greenhouse.
-Oh, shit.

479
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,628
Oh, shit.

480
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,497
Are you gonna write about this
in your screenplay?

481
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,726
I really don't know what "this" is.

482
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,968
He's lying.

483
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,675
-Hold him.
-Stay! Just--

484
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,379
We have to kill him.

485
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,378
-What?
-What are we supposed to do?

486
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,107
-What can we do?
-Sit the fuck down!

487
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,625
Susie...

488
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,893
...you gotta calm down.

489
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,292
Now, you're getting a little emotional.

490
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,024
-You don't know--
-I can't have him writing about me.

491
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,500
I can't have the whole world,
all the people knowing about us...

492
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,605
...and about this.

493
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,142
Why?

494
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,139
-You ashamed of me, Susie?
-No, that's not it.

495
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,440
-No. How can you even think of that?
-Well--

496
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,779
I'm a professional journalist,
and the drugs and--

497
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,486
We can't kill anyone.

498
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,624
Okay. Okay.

499
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,817
Then I'll do it.

500
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,662
By myself.

501
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,297
-Susan--
-Hey! Come on. Fucking get down!

502
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,026
-I wouldn't tell any--
-Put him in his fucking car!

503
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,647
Turn it off. Just get out.

504
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,081
Run! Run! Go!

505
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,110
Susan! What the fuck was that?

506
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:20,622
-I don't know. I couldn't see.
-Shit. Fuck!

507
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,292
Come on! Help me find the flashlight.

508
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,381
So it was a guy?

509
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,051
Yeah. Fat.

510
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,721
That's all I could tell.

511
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,972
This is ridiculous.
We're gonna have to split up.

512
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:15,443
I can't. I can't be by myself out here.
I'm not gonna do that.

513
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,707
-They're gonna find us.
-I don't think so.

514
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,816
I don't want to die, Donald.
I've wasted my life. God, I've wasted it.

515
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,823
-You did not. And you're not gonna die.
-I wasted it.

516
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,927
I admire you, Donald, you know?

517
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,690
I spent my whole life paralyzed,
worrying about what people think of me...

518
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,961
-...and you, you're just oblivious.
-I'm not oblivious.

519
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,337
No, you don't understand.
I mean that as a compliment.

520
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,306
There was this time in high school.

521
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,505
I was watching you out
the library window...

522
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:55,413
-...you were talking to Sarah Marsh.
-Oh, God, I was so in love with her.

523
00:40:55,586 --> 00:41:00,751
I know. And you were flirting with her,
and she was being really sweet to you.

524
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,725
-I remember that.
-And then, when you walked away...

525
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,362
...she started making fun of you
with Kim Canetti.

526
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,863
And it was like
they were laughing at me.

527
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,901
You didn't know at all?

528
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:23,836
-You seemed so happy.
-I knew. I heard them.

529
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,977
Well, how come you were so happy?

530
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,581
I loved Sarah, Charles.

531
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:37,926
It was mine, that love.

532
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,622
I owned it.

533
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:48,166
Even Sarah didn't have
the right to take it away.

534
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,704
I can love whoever I want.

535
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,839
But she thought you were pathetic.

536
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,719
That was her business, not mine.

537
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:12,785
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

538
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,293
That's what I decided a long time ago.

539
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,449
What's up?

540
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,420
Thank you.

541
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,852
For what?

542
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,428
No, shh!

543
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,433
Listen. I hear them.

544
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,938
I hear them. I hear them breathing.

545
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,014
Charlie?

546
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,779
-Charlie?
-Charlie!

547
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,617
-Guys?
-Charlie!

548
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,554
Charlie!

549
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,726
Where's the van?

550
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:56,596
-Are they gone?
-I don't know. Maybe.

551
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,022
John? John!

552
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,039
Shit!

553
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,062
I can't believe I got shot.
Isn't that fucked up?

554
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,290
Shut up. Stop laughing.

555
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,760
Donald? You're gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Donald.

556
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:40,499
Just don't go to sleep. Just don't
go to sleep, Donald. Look at me.

557
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,404
Look at me, Donald.
Keep looking at me.

558
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,600
Open your eyes.
Donald, please open your eyes.

559
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,440
Donald. Donald, please
open your eyes, Donald.

560
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,514
Donald! Donald, open your eyes!

561
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,932
Look at me.

562
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,545
Help!

563
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,398
John!

564
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,255
Halt!

565
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,460
I'm sorry.

566
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,123
Now I have to do this too.

567
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,432
I'm not a killer.

568
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,734
You put yourself in--

569
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,445
Johnny!

570
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,285
-Help!
-No, no!

571
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:16,586
Johnny! Johnny! John!

572
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,132
Oh, no, no, no.

573
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,779
Oh, God. You fat piece of shit!

574
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,889
-He's dead, you loser!
-Shut up!

575
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,757
-You ruined my life, you fat fuck!
-Shut up! Shut up!

576
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:59,903
Fuck you, lady! You're just a lonely,
old, desperate, pathetic drug addict!

577
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,708
Oh, my God.

578
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:20,815
It's over. Everything's over.

579
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,655
I did everything wrong.

580
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,694
I want my life back.

581
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:33,734
I want it back before it all got fucked up.

582
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:38,864
I want to be a baby again.
I want to be new.

583
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,234
I want to be new.

584
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,369
Hello?

585
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,473
-Hello?
-Mom.

586
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:26,350
Charles? Charles, is that you?

587
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,063
Charles, what's the matter? You okay?

588
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:59,851
Donald says,
"That was her business, not mine.

589
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:03,789
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

590
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:07,253
I decided that a long time ago. "

591
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:10,299
Kaufman starts to cry.

592
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:15,166
He tries to thank his brother,
but he can't put it into words.

593
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:21,042
-So how you getting on?
-I'm okay.

594
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,811
I miss him, you know?

595
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,479
-How's the script coming?
-It's good. I'm almost finished.

596
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,180
I'll be really glad to move on
to something else.

597
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,018
I'll bet.

598
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,256
Things okay with you?

599
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:44,059
And then in January, David and I went
to Prague. That was a high point.

600
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,328
-That sounds great.
-There's amazing puppet theater there.

601
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,404
Yeah, I've heard. I've gotta see that.

602
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:55,705
And there's this church decorated
with, like, human skulls and bones.

603
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:59,474
Forty thousand skulls and bones.

604
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,682
I thought about you when I went there.

605
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,475
Charlie, I'm with someone.
Why are you doing this now?

606
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,150
I love you.

607
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,324
I should go. I have to....

608
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:48,453
Stuff I have to do.
I'm going away this weekend....

609
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:52,432
-Million things, okay?
-Yeah.

610
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,110
I love you too, you know.

611
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,632
I have to go right home.
I know how to finish the script now.

612
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,710
It ends with Kaufman driving home
after his lunch with Amelia...

613
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,439
...thinking he knows
how to finish the script.

614
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,550
Shit, that's voice-over.
McKee would not approve.

615
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,846
How else can I show his thoughts?
I don't know.

616
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:48,184
Well, who cares what McKee says?
It feels right.

617
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,292
Conclusive.

618
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,021
I wonder who's gonna play me.
Someone not too fat.

619
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:57,598
I like that Gerard Depardieu,
but can he not do the accent?

620
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:02,101
Anyway, it's done.
And that's something.

621
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:07,005
So: "Kaufman drives off from
his encounter with Amelia...

622
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:10,408
...filled for the first time with hope. "

623
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,273
I like this.

624
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,951
This is good.
