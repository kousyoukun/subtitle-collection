1
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,720
我的光头脑袋瓜还管用吗？
Do I have an original thought in my head? My bald head?

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,190
我的光头脑袋瓜还管用吗？
Do I have an original thought in my head? My bald head?

3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,190
如果我能快乐一点 也许就不会掉头发
Maybe if I were happier, my hair wouldn't be falling out.

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,760
人生苦短 我得好好利用
Life is short. I need to make the most of it.

5
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,420
人生今日方开始
Today is the first day of the rest of my life.

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,000
我是个行尸走肉
I'm a walking cliche.

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,760
我得去看医生 检查我的腿
I really need to go to the doctor and have my leg checked.

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,560
我腿有毛病 长了瘤
There's something wrong. A bump.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,040
牙医生也打电话来 我已经赖很久了
The dentist called again. I'm way overdue.

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,440
如果我不再推推脱脱 我会更快乐
If I stopped putting things off, I'd be happier.

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,240
肥屁股整天坐着 屁股要是不这么肥，我会更快乐
All I do is sit on my fat ass. If my ass wasn't fat, I'd be happier.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,650
这些衬衫的下摆 也不会老是塞不进去
I wouldn't have to wear these shirts with the tails out all the time.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,380
不是盖的
Like that's fooling anyone.

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,280
肥屁股，我又该慢跑了 一天5英里
Fat ass. I should start jogging again. Five miles a day.

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,520
这回决不黄牛 甚至去攀岩
Really do it this time. Maybe rock climbing.

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,350
我要洗心革面
I need to turn my life around.

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,120
该怎么办？ 我需要恋爱
What do I need to do? I need to fall in love.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,770
我要交个女友
I need to have a girlfriend.

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,230
多读点书，充实自己
I need to read more, improve myself.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,130
学俄语好了 ，或者别的？
What if I learned Russian or something?

21
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,330
还是学一样乐器？ 或者学讲中文
Or took up an instrument? I could speak Chinese.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,910
那我就成了会说中文 又会吹双簧管的编剧
I would be the screenwriter who speaks Chinese. And plays the oboe.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,770
那可神了 我要剪个短发
That would be cool. I should get my hair cut short.

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,040
不再自欺欺人 让人以为我不秃头
Stop trying to fool everyone into thinking I have a full head of hair.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,240
真够可悲 真实点，拿出自信来
How pathetic is that? Just be real. Confident.

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,620
女人不就吃这套？
Isn't that what women are attracted to?

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,350
男人不必好看
Men don't have to be attractive.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,960
但世风变了 ，尤其是最近
But that's not true, especially these days.

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,220
男人的压力已经不比女人少
Almost as much pressure on men as there is on women these days.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,420
我为何要受迫害 认为自己没有存在价值？
Why should I be made to feel I have to apologize for my existence?

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,260
也许只是自己脑筋打结
Maybe it's my brain chemistry.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,670
或许这正是我的问题所在 脑筋打结
Maybe that's what's wrong with me: bad chemistry.

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,900
我的失落和焦虑 可以归结为脑筋不平衡...
All my problems and anxiety can be reduced to a chemical imbalance...

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,040
或是某种神经原不来电
...or some kind of misfiring synapses.

35
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,970
真该去看个医生
I need to get help for that.

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,270
但再看医生也是一样丑
But I'll still be ugly, though.

37
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,110
那是无救了的
Nothing's gonna change that.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
闭嘴！ 闭嘴！
Shut up! Shut up!

39
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,820
“变恼”的场景 1998年夏

40
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,480
今天让我们真正解决 摄影机问题
Let's really try today to solve our camera problems.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,710
约翰马可维奇 主演

42
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,090
要把中间空档时间减到最小
Keep between- take time at an absolute minimum.

43
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,460
这些面罩有够热，知道吗？
These masks are really hot. Okay?

44
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,260
大家全都听清楚了
l wanna be very well- heard on that from everybody.

45
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,300
别打混 除非剧情真的需要
Don't futz unless it's absolutely important to the shot, okay?

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,670
我不是说自己 我在说所有在场的人...
l don't say that for me. l say that for the people sitting here...

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,470
- 谢谢你，约翰 - 穿着沉重橡皮的人
- Thank you, John. - ...in the rubber.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,200
- 我喜欢我的洋装，行吗？ - 很好
- l like my dress. Okay? - Very good.

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,780
现在，各位 请听劝告
So now, folks, you better heed that advice.

50
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,810
唐麦史密 首席助理导演

51
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,210
准备拍片
Stand by for picture.

52
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,550
蓝斯亚可 放映师

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,590
让她在桌边转动 稍远一点
Have her rotate around the table a little bit further.

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,310
查理考夫曼 编剧

55
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,890
先等我们清场
Hold on until we're clear.

56
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,030
你，你挡住视线了 请你离开舞台好吗？
You. You're in the eyeline. Can you please get off the stage?

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,500
对，把6英尺的拿进来
Yeah, just bring in the six- footer.

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,440
我在干吗？ 今天根本不该来的
What am I doing here? Why did I bother to come here today?

59
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,570
根本没人认识我
Nobody even seems to know my name.

60
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,740
我已经在世上40年了 却还是啥都不懂
I've been on this planet for 40 years, and I don't understand a single thing.

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,880
为什么我在这里？ 我怎会在这里？
Why am I here? How did I get here?

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,450
加州好莱坞

63
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,920
早在40亿又40年前

64
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,130
我的腿很痛 ，我担心是癌症
My leg hurts. I wonder if it's cancer.

65
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,840
长了瘤，又开始流汗了 别流汗
There's a bump. I'm starting to sweat. Stop sweating.

66
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,070
我一定要止住流汗
I've got to stop sweating.

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,010
她会看见我额头滴汗吗？
Can she see it dripping down my forehead?

68
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,810
她在观察我的发根 她认为我秃头...
She looked at my hairline. She thinks I'm bald. She- -

69
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,510
我们认为你很棒
We think you're great.

70
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,390
谢了 ，你真会说话
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
我们都爱死变脑的剧本了
We all just loved the Malkovich script.

72
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,860
- 多谢， 多谢... - 见解很独到
- Thanks. Thanks.... - Such a unique voice.

73
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,660
我真想到你的头脑里面看看
Boy, l'd love to find a portal into your brain.

74
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,630
相信我，一点也不好玩
Trust me, it's no fun.

75
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,840
告诉我 你对这个疯狂计划的看法
So tell me your thoughts on this crazy little project of ours.

76
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,640
首先，这是本好书
First, l think it's a great book.

77
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,900
兰花贼 苏丝欧琳

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,310
- 老许是个搞笑角色，对吧？ - 正确
- Laroche is a fun character, isn't he? - Absolutely.

79
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,710
而欧琳使得兰花更加迷人
And Orlean makes orchids so fascinating.

80
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,450
加上，她对佛州的冥想 和偷采兰花...
Plus, her musings on Florida and orchid poaching...

81
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,850
的印地安人，简直是 棒透的纽约客题材
...lndians. lt's just- -  lt's great, sprawling New Yorker stuff.

82
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,650
我必须保持它的原有水准
l'd want to remain true to that.

83
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,760
我希望影片自己活起来 而不是...
l'd wanna let the movie exist, rather than be...

84
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,330
- 硬梆梆的照本宣科 - 好啊
- ...artificially plot- driven. - Great.

85
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,400
我也不明白这到底是啥意思
l guess l'm not exactly sure what that means.

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,040
我也不清楚它的真正涵义
l'm not sure l know what that means either.

87
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,240
我只希望好莱坞的积习 不至于毁了它
l just don't wanna ruin it by making it a Hollywood thing. You know?

88
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,080
变成一部 兰花争夺战之类的电影
Like...an orchid heist movie or something, you know?

89
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,810
或把兰花偷换成罂粟花...
Or changing the orchids into poppies...

90
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,980
而演变成毒品追逐战
...and making it about drug running, you know?

91
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,020
- 绝对正确 - 为什么就不能...
- Definitely. - Why can't there be a movie...

92
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,130
纯粹拍一部花卉电影？
...simply about flowers?

93
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,560
我想我们正是这个意思
l guess we thought that maybe...

94
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,100
苏丝欧琳和老许 可以相恋，而且...
...Susan Orlean and Laroche could fall in love, and- -

95
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,030
这么说吧，就好比 我不希望充斥着性欲...
Okay. But l'm saying, it's like, l don't wanna cram in sex...

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,230
枪枝或飞车追逐...
...or guns or car chases...

97
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,070
或是片中角色...
...you know, or characters, you know...

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,770
洞悉了深邃的人生哲学
...learning profound life lessons.

99
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,940
或成长 或相互接纳对方...
Or growing, or coming to like each other...

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,380
或突破万难 最后终于功成名立，我是说...
...or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end, you know? l mean- -

101
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,080
这本书不是这类故事...
The book isn't like that...

102
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,090
真实人生也并非如此 事实如此，而且...
...and life isn't like that. You know, it just isn't. And....

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,460
我很坚持这个理念
l feel very strongly about this.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,630

John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick...

106
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,670
眼光冷漠 双肩微垂...
...pale- eyed, slouch- shouldered...

107
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,470
轮廓俊酷 虽然烂光了满口门牙
...sharply handsome, despite the fact he's missing all his front teeth.

108
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,240
两年前我去佛州 替纽约客写一篇报导
I went to Florida two years ago to write a piece for The New Yorker.

109
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,510
那是在读到一篇一个白人 和三个印地安人的文章之后...
It was after reading a small article about a white man and three Seminole men...

110
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,380
他们因为 偷盗稀有兰花而被捕...
...arrested with rare orchids they'd stolen out of a place...

111
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,850
偷采自叫做法喀哈契浅滩 的州立保育区
...called the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.

佛州29号州公路 两年前

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,590
物竞天择之下每种物种 只有最优秀者得以生存...
As natural selection works solely by

114
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,230
这是达尔文说的
and for the good of each being...

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,070
躯体和心智的天赋 会趋于演化到完美
...all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.

116
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,230
思考理解千头万绪的知识 很有意思...
It's interesting to contemplate an entangled bank....

117
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,420
鬼兰
Polyrrhiza lindenii.

118

法喀哈契浅滩 州立保育区

121
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,980
- 早 - 嗨
- Morning. - Hey.

122
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,980
可以请问各位 你们布袋里装的是啥？
May l ask you gentlemen what you have in those pillowcases?

123
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,810
当然可以问
Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

124
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,150
- 那就请说吧 - 好吧
- Okay, then, l'm asking. - Well, okay, then.

125
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,760
来瞧瞧
Let's see.

126
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,930
这里有5种凤梨科植物...

一棵胡椒草 九株各色兰花
...one peperomia, nine orchid varieties.

128
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,700
你知道 总共有130种植物
You know, about 1 30 plants all told.

129
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,210
是我的同事们 采自这片沼泽
Which my colleagues here removed from the swamp.

130
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,940
你们明白从州有土地上 采摘或捕猎是违法的？
You're aware it's illegal to remove plants or animals from state- owned land?

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,020
是啊，而且不要忘记...
Yeah, and don't forget...

132
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,590
这些花草都是濒临绝种植物 每棵都不例外
...these plants are all endangered, sir. Every one of them.

133
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,780
这正是问题重点所在 这里是州立保育区
Well, exactly. That's exactly the issue. This is a state preserve.

134
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,090
是的，长官
Yes, sir. lt is.

135
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,590
- 但是... - 我同事都是塞米诺印第安人
- But... - My colleagues are all Seminole lndians.

136
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,060
我没有告诉你吗？ 你一定很清楚...
Did l mention that? You're familiar, l'm sure...

137
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,700
佛州控告詹姆比利的案子
...with the State of Florida v. James E. Billie?

138
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,970
因此即使塞米诺酋长比利 猎杀了佛州黑豹...
So you know that even though Seminole Chief Billie killed a Florida panther...

139
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,270
多少？全世界只剩40只吧？
...one of what, 40 in the entire world?

140
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,770
- 40只 - 40只
- Forty. - Forty.

141
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,350
州方也奈何不了他...
The state couldn't successfully prosecute him...

142
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,420
你知道吗， 因为他是印地安人 他就有这个权利
...because, you know, he's an lndian, and it's his right.

143
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,610
虽然你我白人保护主义者 极力反对他的行径
As repugnant as you and l, as white conservationists, might find his actions.

144
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,590
- 可是... - 更别提其他的失败尝试...
- But... - Not to mention the failed attempts...

145
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,160
有3次企图起诉 塞米诺人采摘棕榈蕨
...on three occasions to prosecute Seminoles for poaching palm fronds.

146
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,600
我猜他们是拿来铺设 传统鸡舍的屋顶
Which l believe they use to thatch the roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

147
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,600
你想想看？ 是鸡舍的屋顶，对吧？
How about that? With the chickee huts, right?

148
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,830
没错，我们正是用那造鸡舍的
Yeah, he's right. That's exactly what we use them for. Chickee huts.

149
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,420
是，但我也不能...
Yeah, but l don't- -

150
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,920
我还不能放你们走
l can't let you fellas leave yet.

151
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,250
- 你们先别走喔 - 好啊
- Just hold on there a minute. - Okay.

152
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,460
查理，是你吗？
Charles, is that you?

153
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,260
你吃过午餐吗？
Did you eat lunch?

154
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,770
我吃了冰箱的虾肉沙拉 那是你的吗？
l had that shrimp cocktail in the fridge. Was it yours?

155
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,240
最好不是，我也忘了 于是我吃掉了
l hope not. l couldn't remember, so l ate it.

156
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,530
也许我们今后应该 写上名字
Maybe we should write our names on our food items from now on.

157
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,240
- 你怎么了？ - 背不舒服
- What's with you? - My back.

158
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,820
查理，你一定会很开心 我准备尽快搬出去
Charles, you'll be glad. l have a plan to get me out of your house, pronto.

159
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,790
- 工作才是计划，你找到工作吗？ - 听好了
- A job is a plan. ls your plan a job? - Drum roll, please.

160
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,280
我要成为编剧 和你一样
l'm gonna be a screenwriter. Like you.

161
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,360
你一定觉得 我又在做发财梦...
l know you think this is just one of my ''get rich quick'' schemes...

162
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,160
但这次我很认真的
...but l'm doing it right this time.

163
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,100
我参加了一个3日讲习 而且只要500大洋
l'm taking a three- day seminar, and it's only 500 bucks.

164
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,830
编剧讲习根本是狗屁
Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

165
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,000
理论上我也同意 但这一个与众不同
ln theory, l agree with you. But this one's different.

166
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,110
业界风评非常好
This one's highly regarded in the industry.

167
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,540
唐诺，不要跟我说“业界”
Donald, don't say ''industry.''

168
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,680
抱歉，我又忘了
l'm sorry. l forgot.

169
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,410
查理，这家伙真的懂编剧
Charles, this guy knows screenwriting.

170
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,980
大家远道而来 向他学艺
People come from all over to study with him.

171
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,820
- 我会尽快还你钱... - 我告诉你说
- l'll pay you back as soon as l... - Let me explain something.

172
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,650
任何人说他有 “秘方” 都是想要引人上勾...
Anybody who says he's got ''the answer'' is going to attract desperate people...

173
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,420
请你实际一点...
...be it in the world of religion- -

174
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,960
让我躺着听你解释
l just need to lie down while you explain this to me.

175
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,260
抱歉，我道歉
Sorry. l apologize.

176
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,860
请继续吧
Okay, go ahead.

177
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,470
- 所以... - 对不起，请说
- So... - Sorry. Okay. Go.

178
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,970
并没有什么规则可循
There are no rules, Donald.

179
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,630
如果有人硬要说有 纯粹是在...
And anybody who says there are is just, you know- -

180
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,870
不是规则，是原则
Not rules. Principles.

181
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,310
马契写道，规则只是 “你必须要这样做”
McKee writes that a rule says, ''You must do it this way.''

182
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,110
原则是“长久以来 已经证实有效的方法”
A principle says, ''This works and has through all remembered time.''

183
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,280
我要着手的剧本 是关于花卉
The script l'm starting, it's about flowers.

184
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,520
还不曾有人写过花卉的电影
Nobody's ever done a movie about flowers before.

185
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,500
- 因此没有范例可循 - 艾吉浓之花算不算？
- So there are no guidelines. - What about Flowers for Algernon?

186
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,360
哎呀，那写的不是花 也不是电影
Well, that's not about flowers. And it's not a movie.

187
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,440
抱歉，我也没看过
l'm sorry. l never saw it.

188
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
如何...？ 好吧，请继续
How...? Okay, keep going.

189
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,800
我只是要说 那些老师很危险...
Look, my point is that those teachers are dangerous...

190
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,970
如果你是想要 尝试新鲜点子
...if your goal is to try to do something new.

191
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,910
作家应该都有这种目标 写作是对未知世界的探索
A writer should always have that goal. Writing is a journey into the unknown.

192
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,380
这和打造模型飞机不同
lt's not building, you know, one of your model airplanes.

193
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,380
马契是前任傅布莱奖学者 查理
McKee is a former Fulbright Scholar, Charles.

194
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,690
你也是个傅布莱奖学者吗？
Are you a former Fulbright Scholar?

195
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,060
开口说话呀，带她出来 竟不敢和她说话
Say something. I dragged her here, and now I'm not saying anything.

196
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,070
让她发笑 说些笑话
Make her laugh. Say something funny.

197
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,870
我讨厌派对，艾咪 我们干嘛来这里？
l hate parties, Amelia. Why did we come here?

198
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,740
因为我们时髦、是潮流引领者 对吧？
Because we're hip, young trendsetters on the make, aren't we?

199
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,670
倒像是满地失败的痞子
More like old losers sitting on the floor, maybe.

200
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,650
天哪，查理，那是你吧...
Jesus, Charlie. Speak for yourself. Okay....

201
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,910
查理，我们想给你做媒
Charlie, we're gonna fix you up.

202
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,460
我们要彻底解决 查理考夫曼乱象
We're gonna solve the whole Charlie Kaufman mess for once and for all.

203
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,320
- 好 - 让我瞧瞧
- Okay. - Okay, let me see.

204
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,930
你需要什么 什么，什么？
What do you need? What, what, what?

205
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,960
我很高兴你写了兰花剧本
Well, l'm glad you took the orchid script.

206
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,530
我想它能帮助厘清你的思路
l think it will be good for you to get out of your head.

207
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,000
能够定下心来 想一些大自然的事情
l think it'll ground you to think about the bigger picture, about nature and stuff.

208
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,110
我仍然不敢相信 他们录用了我
l still can't believe they gave me that job.

209
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,150
那顿午餐吃得我满头大汗
l mean, after that lunch. l was sweating insanely.

210
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,180
我简直口无伦次一塌糊涂
l was ranting. l was a mess.

211
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,340
你太紧张 因为她太漂亮
You were just nervous because she was pretty.

212
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,320
你怎么知道她很漂亮？
How do you know she was pretty?

213
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,360
和你认识了8个月 我很了解你流汗的原因
After eight months of knowing you, l think l get what makes you sweat.

214
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,260
哎呀，管它的 你赶快继续说
Well, whatever. Well, moving on, what next?

215
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,960
你需要新行头 这套法兰绒衬衫...
You need a new getup. This whole flannel shirt thing...

216
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,700
实在不怎么样
...it's not really doing anything for you anymore.

217
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,540
谢谢你今晚跟我出来 艾咪
Thanks for coming out with me tonight, Amelia.

218
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,460
起头
To begin.

219
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,990
起头
To begin.

220
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,390
该怎么开始？
How to start?

221
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,470
我饿了
I'm hungry.

222
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,100
我需要喝咖啡
I should get coffee.

223
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,100
咖啡可以帮助我思考
Coffee would help me think.

224
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,940
但我应该先写出一些成果 然后才喝咖啡犒赏自己
But I should write something first, then reward myself with coffee.

225
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:14,670
咖啡和松糕 我需要建立主题大纲
Coffee and a muffin. Okay, so I need to establish the themes.

226
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,120
香蕉核桃好了
Maybe banana- nut.

227
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,380
松糕很不错
That's a good muffin.

228
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,080
采摘野兰花是要命的工作
Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

229
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,420
委内瑞拉欧林诺克河 100年以前

230
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,590
维多利亚时代兰花采摘 威廉阿诺...
Victorian- era orchid hunter William Arnold...

231
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,430
在一次采摘探险中溺死了
...drowned on a collecting expedition.

232
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,590
金纳巴鲁波尼尔

233
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,530
欧斯莫 在亚洲消失得无影无踪
Osmers vanished without a trace in Asia.

234
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,110
中国西双版纳

235
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:46,240
存活的奥古斯都马奎利 染患牙痛风湿胸膜炎和痢疾...
Augustus Margary survived toothache, rheumatism, pleurisy and dysentery...

236
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,910
却在任务完成...
...only to be murdered when he completed his mission...

237
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,950
到达巴哈莫时被人谋杀
...and traveled beyond Bhamo.

238
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,790
老许钟爱兰花，但是...
Laroche loved orchids, but I....

239
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,760
我比较倾向 他对冒险犯难的热爱...
I came to believe he loved the difficulty and fatality of getting them...

240
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,560
几乎和喜爱兰花相当
...almost as much as he loved the orchids themselves.

241
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,540
我成为园艺专家已经12年了
l've been a professional horticulturist for, like, 1 2 years.

242
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,230
佛罗里达迈阿密 6个月后

243
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,570
我自己拥有的苗圃 被飓风吹垮了
l owned my own plant nursery, which was destroyed by the hurricane.

244
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,840
我现在是植物学专业讲师
l'm a professional plant lecturer.

245
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,310
我发表过60多篇 有关培养植物的专题演讲
l've given over, like, 60 lectures on the cultivation of plants.

246
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,250
我的论文刊登在杂志上 我也出书
l'm a published author, both in magazine and book form.

247
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,790
我对兰花已经了若指掌...
And l have extensive experience with orchids...

248
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,330
包括无菌状态的 试管无性繁殖
...and the asexual micropropagation of orchids under aseptic cultures.

249
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,430
那是实验室的工作 和你的苗圃完全不一样
That's laboratory work. lt's not at all like your nursery work.

250
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,770
我简直是天资异秉无人可及
l'm probably the smartest person l know.

251
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,600
- 谢谢你 - 甭客气
- Thank you. - You're very welcome.

252
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,810
是老许吗？ 我是苏丝欧琳
Mr. Laroche? l'm Susan Orlean.

253
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,470
我替纽约客杂志写文章 那是一本...
l'm a writer for The New Yorker. lt's a magazine that- -

254
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,710
纽约客我还知道
l'm familiar with The New Yorker.

255
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,120
纽约客吗？ 对呀，纽约客嘛
'' The New Yorker? Yes, The New Yorker.'' Right?

256
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,920
可不是
That's right.

257
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,720
我想写一篇文章 报导你的遭遇...
l'm very interested in doing a piece on your situation here, and- -

258
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,590
是吗？是
Yeah? Yeah.

259
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,660
你要不要写上这个？
You wanna put this in?

260
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,920
我才不在乎他们要怎么判
l don't care what goes on here.

261
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,070
我没有错 就算到最高法院也是一样
l'm right, and l'll take it all the way to Supreme Court.

262
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,330
我才不管法官要怎么恶搞
Because that judge can screw herself.

263
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,540
- 这些话会照实写吗？ - 当然
- That for real would go in? - Absolutely.

264
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,760
我们从29号公路开场
We open on State Road 29.

265
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,230
一辆破烂白色旅行车 飞会开过来，向右急转...
A battered white van speeds along, making a sharp, skidding right...

266
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,160
来到法喀哈契浅滩 州立保育区
...into the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.

267
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,000
开车的是个没有门牙的瘦子
The driver of the van is a skinny man with no front teeth.

268
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,340
他就是老许
This is John Laroche.

269
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,580
我要休息一下
I need a break.

270
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,210
- 我喜欢西比流士小提琴协奏曲 - 我也喜欢，非常好听
- l loved the Sibelius violin concerto. - Yeah, me too. lt was great.

271
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,790
- 结尾有些诡异，但是... - 哎呀，不是啦，那是热情
- The end was a little weird, but... - Oh, no! God, it was passionate.

272
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,440
一种狂喜的心情
lt was exultant.

273
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,150
独奏部分棒极了 曲调优美精确无比
The soloist was amazing. Such beautiful tones. So precise.

274
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,020
天哪，简直令我疯狂
God, it blows my mind.

275
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,100
- 真希望我也能拉得那么好 - 你跟他一样好
- l wish l could play like that. - You do.

276
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,230
查理我没有那么好 不过是个泛泛之辈
Charlie. l don't. l'm mediocre at best.

277
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
至少我喜欢听你演奏
Well, l love listening to you play.

278
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,460
谢谢你，查理
Thanks, Charlie.

279
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,110
到家啦
Here we are.

280
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,850
接下来呢？
What are you up to now, then?

281
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,920
我该睡了 明天早上还有很多工作
l should probably get to bed. l have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

282
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,520
好吧，那就再见了
Well, good night, then.

283
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,400
我很想晚点回去
l would stay out.

284
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,660
实在是我的剧本 让我伤透脑筋
lt's just that l've really been struggling on the script right now.

285
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,280
我觉得好像太单薄 如果只是写一个老许的故事
l've been thinking about it too small, just writing it like a story about Laroche.

286
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,570
我是说，好像不够充实 我是要写花卉
That's not enough. l mean, l wanted to write about flowers.

287
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,880
总之，我想不出来 所以我最近睡不好...
Anyway, l can't figure it out, and l haven't been sleeping very well lately...

288
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,750
我想我应该回家...
...so l thought l should get home...

289
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,020
好好的睡一觉 这样早上才有精神
...and try to get a good night's sleep, you know. Start fresh in the morning.

290
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,220
不然，我可以不回去
Otherwise, l'd stay out.

291
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,490
我了解，我希望你理出头绪 查理，真的
l understand. l hope you figure it out, Charlie. l really do.

292
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,690
谢了 ，总之谢谢你跟我出来
Thanks. Thanks for coming out with me and everything.

293
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,730
不用客气，我玩得很开心
Sure, it was fun.

294
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,530
下周末我要去圣巴巴拉 有一场兰花大展
So l have to go to Santa Barbara next weekend for this orchid show up there.

295
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,540
希望你也一起去
l thought maybe you could come.

296
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,570
不了 ，我...
No, l....

297
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,280
下周末可能没空
l don't think l can make it next weekend.

298
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,680
应该不行
l don't think l can.

299
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,380
我另外有事，抱歉
l've got something. Sorry.

300
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,150
好吧
Okay.

301
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,310
好吧，那就只好算了 再见了
So, well, okay, then. So good night, then.

302
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,620
再见，查理
Good night, Charlie.

303
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,360
为什么不进去？ 我真窝囊
Why didn't I go in? I'm such a chicken.

304
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,360
我白痴，我应该吻她 我搞砸了
I'm such an idiot. I should have kissed her. I've blown it.

305
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,300
赶快再去敲门 然后吻她
I should just go and knock on her door right now and kiss her.

306
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,910
一定很罗曼蒂克 老了还可以和子孙吹嘘
It would be romantic. Something we could someday tell our kids.

307
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,910
我要立刻这样去做
I'm gonna do that right now.

308
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,090
3年前，佛罗里达 3年前，佛罗里达

309
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,060
- 谢谢你来接我 - 这辆车很破
- Thanks for picking me up. - This van's a piece of shit.

310
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,430
只要让我中了刮刮乐 我会买一部拉风好车
But when l hit the jackpot, l'll buy myself an awesome car.

311
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,030
你开的是什么车？
Hey, what are you driving?

312
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
那是...租来的
lt's... Well, it's a rental.

313
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,200
- 是一部鲁米那 - 好车
- lt's a Lumina. - Awesome.

314
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,210
我也要买一部那种车
l think l'll get one of those too.

315
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,780
出发了
Here we go.

316
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,220
瞧瞧这些驾驶的德性 是吧
Where do these people learn to drive, huh?

317
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,210
全世界都疯了
The world's insane.

318
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,860
我对你在园艺方面...
So l was impressed to hear...

319
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,620
的成就印象深刻
...how accomplished you are in the world of horticulture.

320
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,660
你必须要知道...
The thing you gotta know is...

321
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,770
我一生都千方百计 想要发财？
...my whole life is looking for a goddamn profitable plant, see?

322
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,230
我看中了鬼兰
And that's the ghost.

323
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,430
为什么要选鬼兰？
Why the ghost orchid?

324
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,160
一堆烂货 车里有怪味

325
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,100
因为她很稀有
Well, the sucker's rare. You know?

326
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,370
我是全世界 唯一懂得培养鬼兰的人
And l'm the only one in the world who knows how to cultivate it.

327
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,740
重点是要请印地安人 从沼泽地区采摘
See, the idea was, get the lndians to pull it from the swamp.

328
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,980
我研究过，只要我们不碰她 佛罗里达州就不能碰我们
l researched it. Long as l don't touch the plant, Florida can't touch us.

329
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,460
我以后不用偷摘 店里就可以现成卖花
And l stop future poaching by making the flowers readily available in stores.

330
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,530
我成了英雄，花也得救了...
l'm a hero, the flowers are saved...

331
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,930
老许和大自然都胜利了
...Laroche and nature win.

332
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,190
美丽的幻象

333
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,890
棒极了
Great.

334
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,200
你写下来了吗？
Did you get that last part?

335
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,200
写下来了
Yeah, l sure did.

336
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,430
兰花是世界上最性感的花
Orchids are the sexiest flowers on Earth.

337
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:54,070
兰花的英文是从 拉丁文orchis来的
The name orchid derives from the Latin orchis, which means testicle.

338
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,650
嗨，查理
Hey, Charles.

339
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,580
我把剧本丢给妈看
l pitched my screenplay to Mom.

340
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,550
不要说丢给
Don't say ''pitch.''

341
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,090
抱歉，总之她说...
Sorry. Anyway, she said it was...

342
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,420
那是沉默的羔羊遇上 变态杀人狂
...Silence of the Lambs meets Psycho.

343
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,650
你们俩也应该合作 听说妈的构局很神
Maybe you guys could collaborate. l hear Mom's really good with structure.

344
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,230
艾咪为什么都不来了？
So how come Amelia doesn't come around anymore?

345
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,460
你是不是玩弄了人家？
Did you put the moves on her or something?

346
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,270
塞米诺 苗圃

347
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,950
我找老许
l'm looking for John Laroche.

348
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,460
我在写一篇老许的文章 想来看他
l'm writing an article on John, and l stopped by.

349
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,470
- 希望能够看到他 - 约翰不在
- l hoped l could see him. - John's not here.

350
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,170
你跟他去过沼泽地 对不对？
Well, you were at the swamp with him, weren't you?

351
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,180
我在法院见过你 我认得你
l saw you at the courthouse, that's how l know.

352
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,340
我是马邱奥修拉
l'm Matthew Osceola.

353
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,420
苏丝欧琳，幸会
Susan Orlean. Nice to meet you.

354
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,250
也许我可以跟你谈
Maybe l could talk to you for a second.

355
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,080
我只是想找一些灵感...
l'm just trying to get a feel for the whole operation....

356
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,090
你的头发很美
You have very beautiful hair.

357
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,560
谢谢你这么说
Thank you very much.

358
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,460
我才刚...
Thank you. l just....

359
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,730
今早刚洗过头
l just washed it this morning.

360
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,510
我用了润丝精
l just used a new conditioner.

361
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,270
我能感受你的哀伤
l can see your sadness.

362
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,240
真可爱
lt's lovely.

363
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,580
哎呀，我只是累了 我就是这个毛病
Well, l'm just tired, that's all. That's my problem.

364
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,090
我们可不可以谈一会...
So maybe we could chat a little bit...

365
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,330
- 让我收集一些资料... - 我跟你没有什么好谈
- ...and l could get some background... - l'm not going to talk to you much.

366
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,290
不是对你个人
lt's not personal.

367
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,430
是我们印地安人的习惯
lt's the lndian way.

368
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,340
火箭兰
Angraecum sesquipedale.

369
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,550
美呆了
Beauty! God!

370
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,920
达尔文描写过这一种
Darwin wrote about this one.

371
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,590
查尔斯达尔文？写进化论的家伙？ 记得吗？
Charles Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello?

372
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,750
看那一路垂下的蜜腺
You see that nectary all the way down there?

373
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,230
达尔文推论...
Darwin hypothesized a moth...

374
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,930
有一种12英寸鼻管的蛾 来替她授花粉
...with a nose 1 2 inches long to pollinate it.

375
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,300
每个人都骂他神经
Everyone thought he was a loon.

376
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,910
当然，后来真的着找到了 12英寸鼻管的和蛾
Then, sure enough, they found this moth with a 1 2- inch proboscis.

377
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,100
- “Proboscis”是鼻管的意思 - 我知道这个字的意思
- ''Proboscis'' means nose, by the way. - l know what ''proboscis'' means.

378
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,380
我们不要偏离主题 又不是气死人比赛
Hey, let's not get off the subject. This isn't a pissing contest.

379
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,110
重点是 她奇妙之处...
The point is, what's so wonderful...

380
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,350
是每一种花 都和特定昆虫...
...is that every one of these flowers has a specific relationship...

381
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,320
有一定的关联才能传宗接代
...with the insect that pollinates it.

382
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,260
有些兰花 看起来就像昆虫
There's a certain orchid looks exactly like a certain insect.

383
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,120
于是昆虫被吸引过来...
So the insect is drawn to this flower...

384
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,460
像是分身，像是神交...
...its double, its soul mate...

385
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,070
除了亲热 什么都不想做
...and wants nothing more than to make love to it.

386
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,800
等到虫子飞走...
After the insect flies off...

387
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,640
又去盯上另一个神交伴侣 和她亲热，替她授粉
...it spots another soul- mate flower and makes love to it, thus pollinating it.

388
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,270
但是花和昆虫 谁也不会了解...
And neither the flower nor the insect will ever understand...

389
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,380
它们亲热的真正意义
...the significance of their lovemaking.

390
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,280
它们哪里想得到，小小的振动 使世界有了生命？
How could they know that because of their little dance, the world lives?

391
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,290
但事实就是如此
But it does.

392
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,620
只要照着天赋去做...
By simply doing what they're designed to do...

393
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,560
背后却有奇妙的意义存在
...something large and magnificent happens.

394
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,990
依这种角度来看 它们是在教导我们如何生活
In this sense, they show us how to live.

395
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,830
说明心情才是 唯一的晴两指标
How the only barometer you have is your heart.

396
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,500
只要找到你的正确目标 别让任何事情阻碍你
How when you spot your flower, you can't let anything get in your way.

397
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,820
他真有个性 门牙没有了
He's really quite a character. No front teeth.

398
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,150
- 好像一点都不在乎 - 为什么不去镶假牙呢？
- Doesn't seem to bother him at all. - Why doesn't he get them fixed?

399
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,780
简直孤傲不群 竟让每个人看到他的缺牙
lt seems almost sociopathic to make everybody look at that.

400
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,720
是啊，但他的嘴上功夫 真是了得呢，宝贝
Yeah, but he gives a great blowjob, honey.

401
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,060
其实他蛮迷人的
He is a fascinating character, though.

402
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,530
听起来像金矿呢，苏丝
Sounds like a gold mine, Sue.

403
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,160
未尝不可，可说不定呢 他...
lt could be. l don't know, you know? He's....

404
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,470
他跟他爸爸住 迷恋他亡母，而且...
He lives with his dad, he's obsessed with his dead mother, and....

405
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,940
老是把墨镜挂在脖子上
He wears his sunglasses on a little dingle- dangle around his neck.

406
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,780
爱得要死
Loving it.

407
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,880
- 说说他的车子 - 好啦，车子
- Tell them about the van. - Okay, the van. The van.

408
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,220
- 我现在不能说，我要去尿尿 - 不要，快说他的车子
- l can't tell about the van. l gotta pee. - No, tell us about the van.

409
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,520
- 简直妙极了 ，那是... - 里面有什么？
- lt's amazing. lt's.... - What's in it?

410
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,920
- 你们在车里做爱 - 闭嘴
- You did it in the van. - Shut up.

411
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,690
大卫你来说... 你不准说，不可以说
David, you tell... Don't you tell them. Don't tell them.

412
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,390
好吧，关于车子
Okay, the van.

413
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,600
大卫
David!

414
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,670
车子里面都是垃圾...
This van was filled with junk- -

415
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,870
闭嘴！
Shut up!

416
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,310
一罐罐泥土，铲子 食物包装纸，肥料
Potting soil. Shovels. Food wrappers. Fertilizer.

417
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,810
至少苏丝说 她宁可称它们是肥料
Susie said she hoped it was fertilizer, anyway.

418
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,610
其实她也不确定 老许也有他温馨的一面
She said she couldn't be sure. Laroche had a certain aromatic look about him.

419
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,780
据她说...
And she said- -

420
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,360
也许他的着迷程度 使他吃喝拉撒睡...
She said perhaps his obsessiveness didn't leave room in his schedule...

421
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,720
都在车上解决
...for personal hygiene.

422
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,890
也许兰花能供应 足够的水分
Maybe the orchids got all the available water.

423
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,190
我希望像人们喜爱兰花一样 的渴望一项事物
I wanted to want something as much as people wanted these plants.

424
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,470
但...
But...

425
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,300
我的个性不是这样
...it isn't part of my constitution.

426
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,820
我确实也有一桩 不怕被人讪笑的热情
I suppose I do have one unembarrassed passion.

427
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,850
我希望能亲身体会 付出全副心神热爱某事的感觉
I wanna know what it feels like to care about something passionately.

428
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,800
谁要是有幸见到鬼兰...
''Should one be lucky enough to see a ghost orchid...

429
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,310
其他花卉就会黯然失色
...all else will seem eclipsed. ''

430
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,970
如果鬼兰真是幽灵...
If the ghost orchid was really a phantom...

431
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:05,450
也是令人神魂颠倒的幽魂 引诱人们无止境的追寻...
...it was still such a bewitching one that it could seduce people to pursue it...

432
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,950
年复一年 忘却征途辛劳
...year after year and mile after miserable mile.

433
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,580
如果真有这种花 我一定要亲眼看看
If it was a real flower, I wanted to see one.

434
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,350
不是为了我爱兰花 我甚至根本不喜欢兰花
The reason was not that I love orchids. I don't even especially like orchids.

435
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,120
我只是希望亲眼目赌...
What I wanted was to see this thing...

436
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,600
人们更会被吸引迷恋 到如此强烈的钟情地步
...that people were drawn to in such a singular and powerful way.

437
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,870
那你总共收集了多少乌龟？
So how many turtles did you end up collecting?

438
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,740
我很会就没兴趣了
l lost interest right after that.

439
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,540
自从我爱上冰河时期的化石 我就放弃了乌龟
l dropped turtles when l fell in love with lce Age fossils.

440
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,250
没命的收集化石
Collected the shit out of them.

441
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,380
化石成为这个烂世界上 唯一有意义的东西
Fossils were the only thing that made sense to me in this fucked- up world.

442
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,400
我又放弃了化石 转向修复旧镜面水银
l ditched fossils for resilvering old mirrors.

443
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,530
我妈和我收集了一大堆...
My mom and l had the largest collection...

444
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,800
19世纪荷兰镜子
...of 1 9th- century Dutch mirrors on the planet.

445
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,840
你可能读过有关的报导 镜子世界，1988年10月？
Perhaps you read about us. Mirror World, October '88?

446
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,600
我还留了一份拷贝
l got a copy here somewhere.

447
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,410
我只是想知道 你是如何割舍...
l guess l'd just like to know how you can detach from something...

448
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,020
一件曾经投注全部心神的嗜好
...that you've invested so much of your soul in.

449
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,680
我是说，你从不怀念乌龟吗？
l mean, didn't you ever miss turtles?

450
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,090
那件在你10岁的时候 支持你活下去的东西？
The only thing that made your 1 0- year- old life worth living?

451
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,990
我告诉你一个故事好了？
Look, l'll tell you a story, all right?

452
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:29,860
我曾经死心塌地 的爱上热带鱼
l once fell deeply, you know, profoundly in love with tropical fish.

453
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,160
我家里有60座金鱼缸
l had 60 goddamn fish- tanks in my house.

454
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,030
我会去浮潜寻找喜爱的品种
l'd skin- dive to find just the right ones.

455
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,650
猪鱼，皇后天使鱼 四眼蝴蝶鱼
Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus.

456
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,540
应有尽有
You name it.

457
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,940
然后有一天我说“去他的鱼”
Then one day l say, ''Fuck fish.''

458
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,450
我屏弃了鱼 发誓不再涉足海洋
l renounce fish. l vow never to set foot in that ocean again.

459
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,350
全然把鱼否定
That's how much ''fuck fish.''

460
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,920
那是17年前的事 我再也没有碰过海
That was 1 7 years ago, and l have never since stuck a toe in that ocean.

461
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,290
但我是爱海的
And l love the ocean.

462
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,400
什么道理呢？
But why?

463
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,430
跟鱼了结了
Done with fish.

464
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,810
如果你真正喜欢某件事 难道不会有一丝丝怀念吗？
If you'd really loved something, wouldn't a little bit of it linger?

465
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,040
显然老许的了结 都是干净彻底
Evidently Laroche's finishes were downright and absolute.

466
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,710
头也不回一下
He just moved on.

467
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,790
有时 我也希望有这种能耐
I sometimes wished I could do the same.

468
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,100
午安 你想吃什么？
Good afternoon. So, what looks good today?

469
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,100
给我莱姆派
The key lime pie, please.

470
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,030
一小块就好
A small slice.

471
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,830
还有1杯咖啡 请加脱脂奶水
And a coffee, please. Skim milk, please.

472
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,310
兰花，我喜欢兰花
Orchids. l love orchids.

473
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,100
正点，这是...
Cool. That's....

474
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,210
你的派马上就来
Well, l'll be right back with your pie.

475
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,990
我好兴奋 我一向希望参观兰花大展
l'm so excited. l've always wanted to come to an orchid show.

476
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,700
我觉得这些花好性感
l think these flowers are so sexy.

477
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,470
我们到后面去瞧瞧
Let's see what's around back.

478
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,750
什么？
What?

479
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,690
- 要不要听听我的卖点？ - 走开，讨厌
- You wanna hear my pitch? - Go away, goddamn it.

480
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,330
我只是想找些事情做
You know, l'm just trying to do something.

481
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,830
谢了 ，伙伴，正点
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy. Cool.

482
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,100
有一个连续杀人犯，知道吗？
Okay, there's this serial killer, right?

483
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,980
等一下 警察要捉拿他
Well, no, wait. And he's being hunted by a cop.

484
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,140
而他却捉弄警察 透露下一次作案的线索
And he's taunting the cop, right? Sending clues who his next victim is.

485
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,850
他已经抓了一个人质
He's already holding her hostage in his creepy basement.

486
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,580
使得警察抓了狂 拼命想要找出人质的身份...
So the cop gets obsessed with figuring out her identity...

487
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,160
却在过程当中爱上了她
...and in the process falls in love with her.

488
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,320
虽然从来没有见过她 却好像成了...
Even though he's never even met her. She becomes like....

489
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,660
渴望得到的东西 就像圣杯
Like the unattainable. Like the Holy Grail.

490
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,400
- 这样不会太明显吗？ - 好吧，但是关键是这样的
- lt's a little obvious, don't you think? - Okay, but here's the twist.

491
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,840
我们发现杀人犯...
We find out that the killer...

492
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,980
其实是罹患了 多重人格分裂症
...really suffers from multiple personality disorder. Right?

493
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,700
其实杀人犯就是那个警察 也是那个女孩
See, he's actually really the cop and the girl.

494
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,040
所有的人都是他 是不是天下大乱了？
All of them are him. lsn't that fucked up?

495
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,250
多重人格和连续杀人犯 虽然都是老掉牙的题材
The only idea more overused than serial killers is multiple personality.

496
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,820
但我们可以藉此铺陈...
On top of that, you explore the notion...

497
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,050
警察和杀人犯 其实是一个人的两面
...that cop and criminal are really two aspects of the same person.

498
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,220
警察电影中 常看到这类的例子
See every cop movie ever made for other examples of this.

499
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,990
妈称之为心理上的错乱
Mom called it psychologically taut.

500
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,040
你有没有考虑过 根本无法写得出来？
The other thing is, there's no way to write this. Did you consider that?

501
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,670
你看，这么可能有人 被囚禁在地下室...
l mean, how could you have somebody held prisoner in a basement...

502
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,910
同时又能在警局上班？
...and working in a police station at the same time?

503
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,910
- 用摄影技巧 - 我不是问这个
- Trick photography. - Okay, that's not what l'm asking.

504
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,850
听仔细了 我要问的是
Listen closely. What l'm asking is:

505
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,860
这部电影当中 实际上只有一个角色对吗？
ln the reality of this movie, where there's only one character, right?

506
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,590
对吗？
Okay?

507
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,730
你怎么可能...？
How could you...?

508
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,490
为什么可以...？
What exactly would...?

509
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,330
我同意妈的说法，非常错乱
l agree with Mom. Very taut.

510
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,410
千面女碰上... 剃刀边缘
Sybil meets, l don't know.... Dressed to Kill.

511
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,840
真的，我很喜欢剃刀边缘
Cool. l really liked Dressed to Kill.

512
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,310
- 直到第3幕收场 - 不是这样发音
- Until the third act denouement. - That's not how it's pronounced.

513
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,010
抱歉，我... 好吧，对不起
Sorry. l... Okay, sorry.

514
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,690
- 又要来一点莱姆派吗？ - 可以，我喜欢
- Some key lime pie for you today? - Okay, yeah. That sounds great.

515
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,560
我会切一块大一点的 特别优待
l'll cut you an extra- large slice. Preferred customer.

516
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,330
- 谢谢你，你真好 - 我是个甜姐儿，对吗？
- Thank you. That's really sweet of you. - Well, l'm just a sweetie, ain't l?

517
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,030
- 你还有在研究兰花把？ - 是的，我有
- Still reading about orchids, l hope? - Yes, l am.

518
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,070
我有一个朋友 有1棵小小的粉红色的...
This friend of mine has this little, tiny pink one...

519
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,370
就像这样长在树枝上
...that grows on a tree branch just like that.

520
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,670
- 我想不起名字... - 这叫做附生
- l can't remember... - That's called an epiphyte.

521
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,940
对，对！
Right. Right!

522
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,740
你真不是盖的
Boy, you know your stuff.

523
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,080
没有啦，我正在学
No, not really. l'm just learning.

524
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,160
附生植物长在树上 但他们不是寄生
Epiphytes grow on trees, but they're not parasites.

525
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,850
他们的养分来自空气和两水
They get all their nourishment from the air and the rain.

526
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,090
真是令我大开眼界
Well, l'm impressed. That's great.

527
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,430
世上共有3万种兰花
There are more than 30,000 kinds of orchids in the world.

528
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,140
- 喔，可真多耶？ - 是啊
- Wow, that's a lot, huh? - Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,500
对
Yeah.

530
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,770
我马上就送大片莱姆派 给我的兰花专家
So l'll be right back with an extra- large slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

531
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,410
不过，我是在想...
But... So anyway, l was also wondering....

532
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,510
这个周末我要到圣芭芭拉 去看兰花大展，我...
l'm going up to Santa Barbara this Saturday for an orchid show, and l....

533
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,560
- 对不起 - 这个...
- l'm sorry. - Well....

534
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,560
- 我道歉，我不该 - 你的派马上就来
- l apologize. l'm sorry. - So l'll just be right back with your pie.

535
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:11,130
已知的兰花超过三万种
There are more than 30,000 known orchid species.

536
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,540

One looks like that girl in high school with creamy skin.

542
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,260
有的像纽约的知识份子...
One looks like a New York intellectual...

543
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,460
礼拜天在床上 玩纽约时报字谜游戏
...with whom you do the Sunday Times crossword puzzle in bed.

544
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,330
有的像中西部选美皇后
One looks like a Midwestern beauty queen.

545
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800

有的眼睛神采飞扬
One has eyes that dance.

547
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:43,540
有的眼光中带着哀伤
One has eyes that contain the sadness of the world.

548
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,810
于是我结婚了 我和我的美丽太太...
So l got married, and me and my beautiful new wife...

549
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,850
现在是前妻，那个婊子...
...my now ex- wife, the bitch...

550
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,950
开了一间苗圃
...opened up a nursery.

551
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,150
人们开始问我问题...
People started coming out of the woodwork to ask me stuff...

552
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,850
欣赏我种的花 也欣赏我
...and admire my plants and admire me.

553
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,490
我觉得有的人根本是因为寂寞 来找我做伴
l think some people were really spending time with me because they were lonely.

554
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,400
你知道我为什么喜欢植物？
And you know why l like plants?

555
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,610
因为它们随遇而安
Because they're so mutable.

556
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,660
能适应各种环境变迁
Adaptation's a profound process.

557
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,610
这意味着...
lt means you...

558
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,230
必须要设法求生存
...figure out how to thrive in the world.

559
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,690
对，但对植物比较容易 我是说...
Yeah, but it's easier for plants. l mean...

560
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,630
它们没有记忆
...they have no memory.

561
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,880
它们过一天算一天 但人类，如今...
You know, they just move on to whatever's next. But a person, now...

562
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,670
适应环境几乎变成可耻 我是说，就好像...
...adapting's almost shameful. l mean, it's like...

563
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,280
逃避
...running away.

564
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,120
基诺！
Keener!

565
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,290
嗨，老兄
Hey, man.

566
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,740
不要勾搭工作人员 ，唐诺
Please don't hit on crew members, Donald.

567
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,810
什么，那个化妆师吗？ 是她来勾引我，老哥
What, the makeup girl? She was hitting on me, bro.

568
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,240
别丢我的脸 我必须和他们共事
Don't embarrass me. l have to work with these people.

569
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,680
不会啦，我跟你说...
l won't. Anyway, listen...

570
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,720
我一直想问你 我需要一个杀人的好点子
...l meant to ask you, l need a cool way to kill people.

571
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,490
别担心，我要写剧本
Don't worry. For my script.

572
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,820
我不写那种东西
l don't write that kind of stuff.

573
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,720
拜托啦 你比较天才嘛
Come on, man, please? You're the genius.

574
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,460
这样吧 凶手是个文学教授
Here you go: The killer's a literature professor.

575
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,500
他把受害者肢解成小块小块
He cuts off little chunks from his victim's bodies until they die.

576
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,870
他自称为 “碎刀使者”
He calls himself ''The Deconstructionist.''

577
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,480
- 这点子不错，我喜欢 - 我是开玩笑的，唐诺
- That's kind of good. l like that. - See, l was kidding, Donald.

578
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,240
是喔，对不起
Okay. Sorry.

579
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,610
你唬到我了
You got me.

580
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,850
我要用的话，你不反对吧？
Do you mind if l use it, though?

581
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,130
- 其实很不错 - 我本来想把凯西的一幕...
- lt's really good. - l tried to split the Cassie scene in half...

582
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,570
- 从头到尾分成两半 - 我看到了 ，为什么要这样呢？
- ...from the beginning to the end. - l saw that. Why did you do that?

583
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,610
我要让气氛紧张起来 然后再会合起来...
Because l wanted there to be more tension. And then you pick it up later....

584
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,270
- 你改写了...？ - 营造紧张气氛
- But are you changing...? - Keeps more tension.

585
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,040
这样观众一开始 就被上紧发条
That way the audience gets stuck early on.

586
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,280
- 你喜欢吗？ - 我喜欢
- You like it? - l really like it.

587
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,290
你今晚好诱人，宝贝
You look hot tonight, baby.

588
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,490
谢了 ，唐诺 你嘴真甜
Thanks, Donald. That's swell of you to say.

589
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,530
- 她是不是很诱人，老哥？ - 我要回家了 ，唐诺
- Don't you think she's hot, bro? - l'm heading home, Donald.

590
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,800
是吗？别扫兴
Really? Come on.

591
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,670
嘿，艾咪来了
Hey, it's Amelia.

592
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,640
嗨，艾咪！
Hey, Amelia!

593
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,410
嗨，唐诺 嗨，查理
Hey, Donald. Hey, Charlie.

594
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,610
- 嗨，两位 - 艾咪，好久没看到你了
- Hey. Hi there. - God, Amelia, we don't see you anymore.

595
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,620
- 很高兴看到你 - 这位是我女朋友，凯莲
- lt's good to see you. - This is my girlfriend, Caroline.

596
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,320
- 她是电影化妆师 - 嗨
- She's a makeup artist for the movies. - Hi.

597
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,400
嗨
Hi.

598
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,190
这位是大卫，我朋友
This is David, my friend.

599
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,230
- 嗨 - 嘿，幸会
- Hi. - Hey. Nice to meet you.

600
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,060
- 艾咪常跟我提起你 - 嗨，我是唐诺
- Amelia's talked a lot about you. - Hi, l'm Donald.

601
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,730
- 嘿 - 凯莲
- Hey. - Caroline.

602
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,500
- 相机很酷 - 近来好吗？
- Cool camera. - So how are you?

603
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,400
- 你知道的，一塌糊涂 - 查理...
- You know me, a mess. - Charlie...

604
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,010
真的很高兴看到你 工作顺利吗？
...it's really good to see you. ls the work good?

605
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,310
一塌糊涂 我不知道我在做什么
lt's a disaster. l don't know what l'm doing.

606
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,110
总之，那是我自己的问题 别让我扫你的兴
But, anyway, it's my problem. l don't want to bore you.

607
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:26,020
你有你自己的事情 我是说，我们各自有各自的事情
You have your own stuff, right? l mean, we both have our own separate stuff.

608
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,030
总之，我得回去了 我正要回家工作
Anyway, l should go. l was just heading home to do some work.

609
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,430
- 你走不走？ - 不了 ，今晚我睡凯莲家
- You coming? - No, l'm gonna stay at Caroline's tonight.

610
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,400
在树业里推呀推呀推
A little push, push in the bush.

611
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,940
唐诺，你真糗！
Donald, you're such a tard!

612
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,900
再见，查理
See you, Charlie.

613
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,270
描写花卉 编写花的故事...
To write about a flower, to dramatize a flower...

614
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,380
一定要表现出花的弧度
...I have to show the flower's arc.

615
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,710
这个弧度一直弯曲到 生命的开端
And the flower's arc stretches back to the beginning of life.

616
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,010
花究竟怎么来的？ 它有过哪些遭遇？
How did this flower get here? What was its journey?

617
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,690
因此 我必须引用类比推论法...
Therefore, I should infer from analogy...

618
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,730
英格兰，一百三十九年前

619
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,850
可能地球上所有 有机体的生长...
...that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this Earth...

620
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:12,330
都是来自同一种原生型态...
...have descended from some one primordial form...

621
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,370
衍化成第一种会呼吸的生命
...into which life was first breathed.

622
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,370
这是一种进化过程 适者生存
It is a journey of evolution. Adaptation.

623
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,670
我们都经历过的 把我们全体结合在一起的过程...
The journey we all take. A journey that unites each and every one of us.

624
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,280
达尔文认为我们都是 从同一种单细胞演化
Darwin writes that we all come from the very first single- cell organism.

625
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,180
然而我是我
Yet here I am.

626
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,980
老许是老许 还有欧琳
And there's Laroche. There's Orlean.

627
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,790
还有鬼兰 陷在各自的躯体之中...
And there's the ghost orchid. All trapped in our own bodies...

628
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,050
分别存在历史时空某一点上 就是如此
...in moments in history. That's it.

629
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,260
我所要做的 是把所有历史串联起来
That's what I need to do. Tie all of history together.

630
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,900
远从地球上生命的起端
Start right before life begins on the planet.

631
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,330
当时一切...
All is...

632
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,340
了无生息 然后，生命开始...
...lifeless. And then, like, life begins...

633
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,640
生成有机体 就是那些单细胞生物
...with organisms. Those little single- cell ones.

634
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,810
性生活还没开始 因为好像，一切都是无性的
And it's before sex, because, like, everything was asexual.

635
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,350
后来演化出较大生物 水母
From there we go to bigger things. Jellyfish.

636
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,210
后来又有长脚的鱼 爬上了陆地
Then that fish that got legs and crawled out on the land.

637
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,650
于是出现了恐龙
And then we see, you know, like, dinosaurs.

638
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,560
恐龙经历一段很长年代 然后一颗流星带来了 ：
And then they're around for a long time. Then an asteroid comes and:

639
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,930
...昆虫、哺乳类、灵长类、猿猴
...the insects, the mammals, the primates, monkeys.

640
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,560
单纯的猴子 渐渐出现新的品种
The simple monkeys. Old- fashioned monkeys giving way to the new ones.

641
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,200
诸如，猩猩出现 诸如，然后人类
Whatever. And then apes. Whatever. And man.

642
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,870
接着就是人类文明的历史 狩猎、战争、情爱...
Then we see the whole history of human civilization: hunting, war, love...

643
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,170
心痛、疾病、孤寂、科技
...heartache, disease, loneliness, technology.

644
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:31,280
最后来到苏丝欧琳 在纽约客的办公室...
And we end with Susan Orlean in her office at The New Yorker...

645
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,880
她正在写花卉报导！ 于是乎，电影开场
...writing about flowers, and bang! The movie begins.

646
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,650
这正是我期待的突破 之前未曾做到过
This is the breakthrough I've been hoping for. It's never been done.

647
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,880
马契真是天才！
McKee is a genius!

648
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,090
而且风趣，他的笑话总是引得 大家哈哈大笑
And hilarious. He just comes up with all these great jokes, and everybody laughs.

649
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,430
但他也很严谨，查理 你会喜欢他的
But he's serious too, Charles. You'd love him.

650
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,400
他的灵感新颖丰富，和你一样
He's all for originality, just like you.

651
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,470
但他说 我们必须依照类型来写...
But he says we have to realize that we all write in a genre...

652
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,770
要在类型之中寻求创意
...and we must find our originality within that genre.

653
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,570
劳勃马契的编剧研讨班

654
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,440
费里尼首创仿记录片类型之前 从来没出现过新的类型
There hasn't been a new genre since Fellini invented the mockumentary.

655
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,250
我的类型是恐怖片 ，你的呢？
My genre's thriller. What's yours?

656
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,410
我们的遗传基因相同
You and l share the same DNA.

657
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,060
还有什么比这更孤单呢？
ls there anything more lonely than that?

658
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,630
你说啥，老哥？
What'd you say, bro?

659
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,990
- 是吗？ - 嘿
- Yeah? - Hey.

660
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,900
嘿，苏丝Q
Hey, Susie- Q.

661
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,100
你有什么企图？
What you up to?

662
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:34,480
我不会太打扰你 我只想来见你， 多找些材料
l don't wanna bother you. Just thought l'd call and get some more info.

663
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,880
你为何不说些有智慧的话
I think you say some pretty smart things, John.

664
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,990
是啊，所见过最聪明的家伙？
Yeah, smartest guy l know, huh?

665
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,080
那么...
So...

666
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,060
你的苗圃究竟出了什么事？
...whatever happened to your nursery?

667
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,930
本来一切都很顺利
lt was going pretty well.

668
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,940
只是，天有不测风云 黑暗降临
But, you know, sometimes bad things happen, darkness descends.

669
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,340
九年前，北迈阿密

670
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,180
苗圃生意好吗，约翰？
Nursery business good, Johnny?

671
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,620
万事顺利，金叔
Everything's good, Uncle Jim.

672
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,220
最近这一年好得出奇
This last year's been a dream.

673
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,150
跟你说 我们终于转亏为盈了
l'm telling you. Finally pulling out of debt.

674
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,320
阿门，亲爱的 我真以你为荣...
Amen, honey. l'm so proud of you two, and- -

675
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,370
不，我真抱歉 我不知道
No, ma'am. l'm sorry, l can't answer that.

676
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,140
- 不要动 - 嘿
- Stay right there. - Hey.

677
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,490
- 等一下，是谁死了？ - 拜托你不要乱动
- Hold it. Which ones are dead? - Sir, please, don't move.

678
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,720
- 死了哪些人？ - 动身了 ！
- Which ones are dead? - Let's move it!

679
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,160
我害死我妈和叔叔
I killed my mom, you know, and my uncle.

680
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,230
门牙也是那样掉的
That's how I lost my front teeth.

681
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:12,170
我老婆昏迷了 大约三个星期
And my wife was in a coma for, like, three weeks.

682
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,740
一清醒就和我离了婚
And she divorced me soon after she regained consciousness.

683
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,890
我想，如果差点死掉的是我 我也会想要离婚
Well, l think if l almost died, l would leave my marriage too.

684
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,770
为什么呢？
Why?

685
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,600
因为我可以
Because l could.

686
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,710
就像是张免费票 没有人可以批判...
Because it's like a free pass. Nobody can judge you...

687
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,250
如果你差点死去
...if you almost died.

688
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,180
可是，我就批判了她
Well, l judged her.

689
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,580
也许我也受到了批判
Maybe l was being judged too.

690
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,120
没过一个月 安德鲁飓风来袭
It was like a month after that, Hurricane Andrew came along and just...

691
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,700
好像老天派来的密使 一扑而下
...swooped down like an angel of God...

692
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:11,530
卷走了我所剩的一切
...and just wiped out everything I had left.

693
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,060
一切所有
Everything.

694
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,800
我不忍心重新经营苗圃...
I knew it'd break my heart to start another nursery...

695
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,840
所以 当塞米诺人找上我...
...so, you know, when the Seminoles called...

696
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:27,510
他们要找个专家白人 帮忙经营苗圃 ，我就答应了
...they wanted a white guy or an expert to get their nursery going, l took the job.

697
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,590
我不是要帮他们经营 传统式一盆盆的花草
l wasn't gonna give them a conventional little potted- plant place.

698
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,490
我要给他们一些...
l was gonna give them something...

699
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,390
奇特的东西，你懂吗？
...amazing, you know?

700
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,760
我了解
Yeah, I know, John.

701
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,230
我知道
I know.

702
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,130
我准备给他们一些神奇的
''l was going to give them something amazing.''

703
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,400
兰花痴 苏丝欧琳着

704
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,640
写得真美 你的见解独到
lt's beautifully written. You have such a unique voice.

705
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,470
谢谢
Thank you very much.

706
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,840
- 我们是你的忠实书迷 - 谢谢
- We're big fans. - Thank you.

707
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,610
老许的角色真有趣
Laroche is such a fun character.

708
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,020
- 是啊 - 有趣而且新鲜
- Yeah. - lt's funny and fresh.

709
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,760
也带着点感伤
And sad in a way.

710
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,020
不知道你下一篇要写什么
So we were wondering what's next.

711
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,220
兰登屋来找我接洽过...
Well, Random House has asked me...

712
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,990
想把它扩展成书 我会忙于此事
...to expand it into a book, so l'm gonna be doing that.

713
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,160
- 而且... - 苏丝，我们想要买断
- And... - Susan, we would like to option this.

714
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,740
- 你们要改编成电影？ - 拍电影
- You wanna make it into a movie? - lnto a movie.

715
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,640
噢，天那！
Oh, God!

716
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,650
- 真的太... - 你觉得如何？
- That's really.... - How does that sound?

717
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,680
- 叫人兴奋 - 很好
- That's very exciting. - Good.

718
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,880
有点滑稽，我不曾思考过 我没有编剧过
lt's just comical. l hadn't thought of it. l've never written a screenplay before.

719
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,990
这不用你担心 我们有编剧会负责
Don't worry about that. We have screenwriters to write the screenplay.

720
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,790
嘿，超级巨星 我是马帝，超级代理人
Hey, superstar. It's Marty, super agent.

721
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,940
我只是提醒你 已经13个礼拜了...
I just wanna remind you it's been 1 3 weeks...

722
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,900
薇拉急着想看剧本
...and Valerie's anxious to see a draft.

723
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,130
请你务必在礼拜一送去给她
So if you could wrap things up and get it to her by Monday, that'd be great.

724
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,800
听到留言回我电话 拜拜，朋友
Call me when you get this. Adios, amigo.

725
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,470
兰花贼 查理考夫曼编剧

726
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:07,840
你笑什么？
What? What'd you laugh at?

727
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,060
- 你真天才 - 哪一句？
- You're a genius. - Which line?

728
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,850
你真天才 你真天才
You're a genius. You're a genius.

729
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,650
我们看到兰花大盗 奥古斯塔马加里
''We see orchid hunter Augustus Margary.

730
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,310
额头绑着一条肮脏破布 用来减轻头痛
He wears a filthy, spittle- soaked rag around his head to quell the pain.

731
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,190
裤子后面沾满排泄物...
The back of his trousers are stained greasy black from an anal leakage...

732
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,920
因为得了痢疾
...due to dysentery.

733
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:57,730
他在浓密的业林中呻吟 举步维艰
He moans with each tentative step through the overgrown jungle. ''

734
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,470
我受不了了
I'm fucked.

735
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,700
我们从老许开场 他幽默的说“我喜欢让花草变种”
We open with Laroche. He's funny. He says, ''I love to mutate plants. ''

736
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,780
他说“变种很好玩” 我们展出花卉
He says, ''Mutation is fun. '' Okay, we show flowers and.... Okay.

737
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,810
我们要用法庭的案子 我们展现老许
We have to have the court case. We show Laroche.

738
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,710
他说“我在婴儿时期就被变种了 我才会这么聪明”
He says, ''I was mutated as a baby. That's why I'm so smart. ''

739
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,610
很好笑 好吧，我们用混沌初开，不！
That's funny. Okay, we open at the beginning of time. No!

740
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,310
- 老许开车进入沼泽 - 疯狂白人！
- Laroche is driving into the swamp. - Crazy white man!

741
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,460
我不知道怎么改编它 我应该坚持用自己的素材
l don't know how to adapt this. l should have stuck with my own stuff.

742
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,730
我不知道为何 会以为我能改编它
l don't know why l thought l could write this.

743
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,100
看那女的？
See her?

744
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,440
我从后面玩过
l fucked her up the ass.

745
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,700
我说笑的
No. l'm kidding.

746
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,410
或许我能帮忙
Maybe l can help.

747
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:50,080
这是关于花卉
lt's about flowers.

748
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,750
好吧
Okay.

749
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,460
但不是只有花卉？ 其中还有个植物痴狂？
But it's not only about flowers, right? You have the crazy plant- nut guy, right?

750
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,000
他很滑稽，对吗？
He's funny. Right?

751
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,210
“他的事情根本不配写书”
''There's not nearly enough of him to fill a book.''

752
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:12,170
于是欧琳“旁敲侧击” 写了一堆废话
So Orlean ''digresses in long passages.'' Blah, blah, blah.

753
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,940
“支离破碎的拼凑” 纽约时报书评
''No narrative unites these passages.'' New York Times Book Review.

754
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,780
我无法组织它们 这种纽约客的烂类型
l can't structure this. lt's that sprawling New Yorker shit.

755
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,010
我该玩过她的后庭
Man, l'd fuck her up the ass.

756
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,490
- 抱歉 - 这本书没有剧情，毫无剧情
- Sorry. - The book has no story. There's no story.

757
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,630
好吧，那就捏造剧情
All right. Make one up.

758
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,560
我是说，城里只有你 最能写出脍炙人口的故事
l mean, nobody in this town can make up a crazy story like you.

759
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,790
- 你是个中翘楚 - 不，这回我不干
- You're the king of that. - No, l didn't want to do that this time.

760
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,370
这是别人的素材 我对苏丝要负责任的...
lt's someone else's material. l have a responsibility to Susan- -

761
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,740
总之，我要做个有长进的作家 我要写些单纯的
Anyway, l wanted to grow as a writer. l wanted to do something simple.

762
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,040
让观众理解花卉的迷人
Show people how amazing flowers are.

763
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,510
它们迷人吗？
Are they amazing?

764
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:57,340
我不知道，我想是吧
l don't know. l think they are.

765
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,860
- 你要帮我解套 - 好吧
- l need you to get me out of this. - All right.

766
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,030
查理，你已经整理好几个月了
Charlie, you've been stringing them along for months now.

767
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,830
现在还拿不出东西 恐怕不好看吧
Not to give them anything at this point would be a terrible career move.

768
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,410
嘿，我的剧本进行的很好
Hey, my script's going amazing.

769
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,810
现在 我使用一套影像系统
Right now, l'm working out an image system.

770
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,040
因为我的多重人格主题 我选了一个主题...
Because of my multiple personality theme, l've chosen a motif...

771
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,430
嘿，我的剧本进行的很好

772
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,210
现在 我使用一套影像系统
Right now, l'm working out an image system.

773
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,440
因为我的多重人格主题 我选了一个主题...
Because of my multiple personality theme, l've chosen a motif...

774
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,680
用破碎的镜子 显示主角的分裂人格
...of broken mirrors to show my protagonist's fragmented self.

775
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:38,120
包勃说话影像系统 可以增加感官的复杂美感
Bob says an image system increases the complexity of an aesthetic emotion.

776
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,450
- 包勃说... - 你听起来简直像在虔诚膜拜
- Bob says... - You sound like you're in a cult.

777
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,750
不，那只是写作的技巧
No, it's just good writing technique.

778
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,160
我把马契的十大守则印了复本
l made you a copy of McKee's 1 0 Commandments.

779
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,820
在你我书桌前各贴了一份
l posted one over both our work areas.

780
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,770
劳勃马契的十大守则

781
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,640
你不该这样做
You shouldn't have done that.

782
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,980
那真的很有帮助 查理，我加了一首歌
Because it's extremely helpful. Hey, Charles, l'm putting a song on.

783
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,450
“快乐时光”
''Happy Together.''

784
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,590
大家穿着睡衣唱歌跳舞
Like when characters sing songs in their pajamas and dance around.

785
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,490
这样可以打破紧张气氛
l thought it'd break the tension.

786
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,990
刚开始我有些犹豫 在恐怖片中穿插歌曲...
At first l was nervous about putting a song in a thriller...

787
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,760
但包勃说北非谍影 有史以来最棒的剧本...
...but Bob says that Casablanca, one of the greatest screenplays ever written...

788
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,060
就这样做过 混合类型
...did exactly that. Mixed genres.

789
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,400
我已经一星期没睡了，唐诺
l haven't slept in a week, Donald.

790

791
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,840
晚安
Good night.

792
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,580
- 什么事？ - 嗨

793
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:44,780
老许，又是我啦

794
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,980
嘿，苏丝Q
Hey, Susie- Q.

795
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,760
进行得如何？
How's it going?

796
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,160
很好啊，我在训练网路技巧
Great. l'm training myself on the lnternet.

797
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,070
真是太神奇了 我在经营色情网站
lt's fascinating. l'm doing pornography.

798
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,260
我搞不懂这些痞子 为了马子照片愿意付多少钱
lt's amazing how much these suckers will pay for photographs of chicks.

799
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,240
不管她们是肥是丑
lt doesn't matter if they're fat or ugly or what.

800
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,070
听起来不错啊
Well, that sounds good.

801
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,910
很好呢，很真实
lt's great, is what it is.

802
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,540
我实在不愿多麻烦你 可是...
Listen, John, l hate feeling like l'm being a pain to you, but l....

803
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,550
我还没见过鬼兰
l still haven't seen a ghost.

804
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:21,450
- 是吗？ - 我希望你能带我...

805
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,890

806
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,820
好，我来接你

808
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:32,140
太谢谢你了
Thank you so much.

809
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,770
噢，老许
Oh, John.

810
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,470
可恶
Damn it.

811
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,820
有太多思绪事物和人物
There are too many ideas and things and people.

812
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,890
太多可以遵循的方向
Too many directions to go.

813
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,720
我开始渐渐觉得 真的需要特别关注一些事情...
I was starting to believe the reason it matters to care about something...

814
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,190
就可以把世界缩得小一点...
...is that it whittles the world down...

815
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,000
变得容易应付些
...to a more manageable size.

816
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:08,970
真是窝心，洞悉忧愁
Such sweet, sad insights.

817
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,540
那么真实
So true.

818
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,490
我喜欢看着你
l like looking at you.

819
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,760
我也喜欢看着你，查理
I like looking at you too, Charlie.

820
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,400
我不知道怎么继续下去
l don't know how to do this.

821
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,910
我怕会让你失望
l'm afraid l'll disappoint you.

822
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:19,270
你的书写得很美
You've written a beautiful book.

823
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,040
我睡不着
l can't sleep.

824
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,680
我在掉头发 又肥，又惹人厌
l'm losing my hair. l'm fat and repulsive.

825
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,410
嘘，你不会惹人厌
Shh. You're not. You're not.

826
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,030
把它简化一点？
Just whittle it down, you know?

827
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,660
把焦点放在故事面
Focus on one thing in the story.

828
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,860
找出那一件最最...
Find that one thing...

829
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,400
让你热中喜爱的事情
...that you care passionately about...

830
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,660
把它写出来
...and then write about that.

831
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,100
我们对苏丝欧琳的了解是 雅致的，被孤独所包围...
We see Susan Orlean: delicate, haunted by loneliness...

832
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,740
娇弱，而美丽
...fragile, beautiful.

833
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,810
躺在熟睡的粗俗丈夫身边 她醒着
She lies awake next to her sleeping, insensitive husband.

834
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,180
她开始旁白：
Her voice- over begins:

835
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,520
“我想我的确有一项 不怕被人知道的热衷”
''l suppose l do have one unembarrassed passion.

836
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:07,180
“我希望能亲身体会 付出全副心神热爱某事的感觉”
l want to know how it feels to care about something passionately.''

837
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,130
- 嘿 - 早啊
- Hey. - Morning.

838
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,830
两位早，改成早起啦？
Hey, you two. Up early for a change?

839
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,530
- 你精神好多了 - 我很好，我有了新点子
- You seem chipper. - l'm good. l have some new ideas.

840
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:27,610
你们俩真是聪明过人 这里简直就是智囊工厂
God, you guys are so smart. lt's like a brain factory in here.

841
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,440
- 今早我也有了新点子 - 他的新点子真的很棒很棒
- l got some ideas too this morning. - He got really, really good ones.

842
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,020
你知道，唐诺式的
You know, in a Donald sort of way.

843
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:37,820
我要加... 嘿！什么？
l'm putting... Hey! What?

844
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,960
我要增加一段追逐的戏 杀手...
l'm putting in a chase sequence. So the killer...

845
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,530
骑马带着女孩逃走 警察骑摩托车追赶
...flees on horseback with the girl. The cop's after them on a motorcycle.

846
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,360
就像是机器和马匹的战争
And it's like a battle between motors and horses.

847
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,300
科技对自然
Like technology versus horse.

848
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,800
那他们也还都是同一个人？
And they're still all one person, right?

849
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,430
啊呀，那是最大的代价
Well, that's the big payoff.

850
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,410
- 听起来很刺激 - 谢了，老兄
- lt sounds exciting. - Thanks, man.

851
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,610

- You're my muse. You are. - l love being your muse.

853
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,010
我太高兴了
l'm so happy about that.

854
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,920
我来替考夫曼取件
l'm picking up an order for Kaufman.

855
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,050
- 薇拉 - 嗨，查理
- Valerie. - Hi, Charlie.

856
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,150
真巧啊 刚好碰到你
lt's quite a coincidence bumping into you.

857
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,940
抱歉我没有回你电话 上礼拜我不在
l'm sorry l didn't call you back. l was away last week.

858
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,090
- 没关系 - 本来要打的...
- That's okay. - l meant to because...

859
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,720
因为情况顺利多了 我想让你知道
...things are going really well now, and l wanted you to know.

860
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,020
那太好了 我很想看些成果
Well, that's great. l'm anxious to see something.

861
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,750
跟我们坐一下 我正在和苏丝吃饭
You should sit down because l'm here with Susan right now.

862
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,590
她好想见见你 碰到你真太巧了
And she's dying to meet you, so it's funny bumping into you.

863
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,100
- 来坐一下 - 苏丝欧琳也在这里？
- Have a seat. - Susan Orlean is here?

864
00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:00,170
是啊，她正来城里有事 她正在打电话
Yeah, she's here in town for a reading or something. She's just on the phone.

865
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,900
坐一下嘛 她好想见你
Sit down. Have a seat. She's dying to meet you.

866
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,310
我还是走吧...
Well, l should probably go, because....

867
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,310
其实我也很想见她
Well, l'd love to meet her too...

868
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,510
但我不想欠她情 而且...
...but l don't want to be beholden. And, well- -

869
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:17,520
一旦见过你正在描写的人
Because once you meet somebody that you've been writing about...

870
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:20,120
就会失去客观判断...
...it becomes very hard to separate. So....

871
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,950
好了，我改天再和你联络 我快写好了
Well, okay, l'll speak to you soon. And l'm almost done.

872
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,120
就快好了
l'm almost done.

873
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,270
跟苏丝说我很乐意 在以后和她见面
And tell Susan that l would love to meet with her at a future date.

874
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,020
- 只要她方便 - 好吧
- As she sees fit. - Okay.

875
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,530
我在骗谁啊？ 这又不是在写苏丝欧琳
Who am I kidding? This is not Susan Orlean's story.

876
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,270
跟她毫无瓜葛 我却不敢见她
I have no connection with her. I can't even meet her.

877
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,470
除了自乱阵脚和自我憎恨以外 我啥也不懂...
I have no understanding of anything but my own panic and self- loathing...

878
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,170
还有可悲和小家子气
...and pathetic, little existence.

879
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:46,340
我只够格写我自己 只能写自己...
The only thing I'm actually qualified to write about is myself and my own self- -

880
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,080
查理考夫曼上场
We open on Charlie Kaufman.

881
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:52,160
肥胖的秃老，面目可憎 坐在好莱坞的一家餐厅...
Fat, old, bald, repulsive, sitting in a Hollywood restaurant...

882
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,350
面对着薇拉汤玛丝 端庄美丽的执行制作
...across from Valerie Thomas, a lovely, statuesque film executive.

883
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:00,360
考夫曼想要争取一件 编剧工作...
Kaufman, trying to get a writing assignment...

884
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,560
黄汗直冒地设法博取她的好感
...wanting to impress her, sweats profusely.

885
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:12,170
秃肥的考夫曼在卧室 气急败坏的踟躇着
Fat, bald Kaufman paces furiously in his bedroom.

886
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,910
对着手提录音机 说道：
He speaks into his hand- held tape recorder, and he says:

887
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,710
查理考夫曼 肥胖的秃老，面目可憎...
''Charlie Kaufman, fat, bald, repulsive, old...

888
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,380
“和薇拉汤玛丝 坐在老莱坞一家餐厅”
...sits at a Hollywood restaurant with Valerie Thomas.''

889
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,320
考夫曼，貌不登样，滑稽...
Kaufman, repugnant, ridiculous...

890
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,720
对着苏丝的书皮照片 打着手枪...
...jerks off to the book jacket photo of Susan Or- -

891
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,650
什么事？
What do you want?

892
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,420
我的剧本写好了
l've finished my script.

893
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,700
我完工了
l'm done.

894
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,430
可以请你的经纪人看吗？
So would you show it to your agent?

895
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,000
名叫“3”
lt's called The Three.

896
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,910
谢了 也要谢谢你的点子
Thanks. l also want to thank you for your idea.

897
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,140
帮了大忙 我稍微修改了
lt was very helpful. l changed it a little.

898
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,950
改成凶手强迫受害人 吃掉从身上切下的肉
Now the killer cuts off body pieces and makes his victims eat them.

899
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,350
凯琳有个蛇的刺青 吞食着自己的尾巴...
Caroline has this great tattoo of a snake swallowing its own tail, and- -

900
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,580
- 饿伯蛇 - 我不懂它的意思
- Ourobouros. - l don't know what that means.

901
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,990
那条蛇，叫做饿伯蛇
The snake. lt's called Ourobouros.

902
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,530
我不知道 但我凶手的“工法”真酷...
l don't think so. But it's cool for my killer to have this modus operandi...

903
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,530
他强迫那女人吃她自己的肉 而那女人其实是他自己...
...because when he forces the woman who's really him to eat herself...

904
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,360
他是在自己咬死自己
...he's also eating himself to death.

905
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,870
我疯了
l'm insane.

906
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,140
- 我是饿伯蛇 - 我不懂那个字的意思
- l'm Ourobouros. - l don't know what that word means.

907
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:21,110
- 我把自己写进剧本了 - 那样有点诡异吧？
- l've written myself into my screenplay. - That's kind of weird, huh?

908
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,180
这是自我放纵，是一种自我陶醉
lt's self- indulgent. lt's narcissistic.

909
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,820
那是唯我论，那是可悲
lt's solipsistic. lt's pathetic.

910
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,950
我真可悲 我又肥又可悲
l'm pathetic. l'm fat and pathetic.

911
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,680
你一定有你的道理，查理 你是艺术家
l'm sure you had good reasons, Charles. You're an artist.

912
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,050
是因为我太窝囊 不敢面对写那本书的女人
lt's because l'm too timid to speak to the woman who wrote the book.

913
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,090
因为我可悲
Because l'm pathetic.

914
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:42,260
因为我写不出来 因为我种不出美丽的花
Because l have no idea how to write. Because l can't make flowers fascinating.

915
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,420
因为我烂
Because l suck.

916
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,570
- 嘿，有没有写我啊？ - 我要去纽约
- Hey, am l in the script? - l'm going to New York.

917
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,170
我去见她，我决定了 我必须这样做
l'll meet her. That's it. That's what l have to do.

918
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,040
你可别生气...
Don't get mad at me for saying this...

919
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,510
但这个周末 劳勃正好在纽约办讲习
...but Bob's having a seminar in New York this weekend.

920
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,510
如果你写不下去...
So if you're stuck....

921
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,220
她说“老许真是滑稽” 她说“老许真是滑稽”
And she said, ''Laroche is such a fun character.'' And she said, ''Laroche is such a fun character.''

922
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,720
不是盖的，我是滑稽角色
No shit, l'm a fun character.

923
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,150
谁来演我？
Who's gonna play me?

924
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,490
我得先写完书
Well, l've gotta write the book first, John.

925
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,490
然后他们会找人编剧
Then, you know, they get somebody to write the screenplay.

926
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,890
嘿，我觉得应该由我来演自己
Hey, l think l should play me.

927
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:19,570
多数人渴望卓越事物 渴望心灵的启发...
Most people yearn for something exceptional, something so inspiring...

928
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:24,870
愿意为热情牺牲一切 一点都不作做
...that they'd want to risk everything for that passion, but few would act on it.

929
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,210
是一种强烈的力量...
It was very powerful...

930
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,710
和这种生意昂然的人相处 简直令人陶醉
...and it's intoxicating to be around someone so alive.

931
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,820
跟着我来吧 就在不远
Come on, just follow me. They're right nearby.

932
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,680
好
Okay.

933
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,070
我可以问个私人问题吗？
Can l ask you a personal question?

934
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,970
放心，我们没有迷路
Look, we're not lost.

935
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,860
我来过千百次了
l've done this a million times.

936
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,260
凡事不顺的时候我就说 “去它的” ，然后继续努力
When everything is killing me, l just say, ''Screw it,'' and go straight ahead.

937
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,970
噢，糟了...
Oh, fuck....

938
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:39,020
日晷
Sundial.

939
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,040
我把它竖起来 等上几分钟...
l'll just set this up, we'll wait a few minutes...

940
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,350
就可以知道 太阳移动的方向
...and then we'll be able to tell which way the sun's moving.

941
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,080
我们应该向东南方走
We should be headed southeast.

942
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:56,830
你也收集东西吗？
So, you collect anything?

943
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,870
也不尽然
Not really, no.

944
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,000
是啊，你知道...
Yeah, well, you know...

945
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,900
其实不是为了收集东西
...it's not really about collecting the thing.

946
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,480
而是想要去完成...
lt's about being able....

947
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,280
就像对电脑 我所喜欢的...
The thing about computers, the thing l like...

948
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:14,980
是能沉浸其中
...is that l'm immersed in them...

949
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:19,850
而它们没有生命 不会死去或别离
...but it's not like a living thing that's gonna leave or die or something.

950
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,530
- 对不起，我只是... - 没事
- John, l'm sorry. l just... - Okay.

951
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,340
- 我不是... - 嘿，没事
- l don't... - Hey. Okay.

952
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,130
去它的日晷
Fuck the sundial.

953
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:37,300
我知道怎么走出去 我知道怎么走出去
l know how to get out of here. l know how to get out of here.

954
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,380
这个泥淖 我早就了若指掌
l know this swamp like the back of my goddamn hand.

955
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:43,140
你和别人一模一样 吸血水蛭
You're just like everybody else. Fucking leeches.

956
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,310
尽管扒在我身上 吸干我的血，再吐掉
You just attach yourself to me and suck me dry, spit me out.

957
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,720
为什么不去过你自己的日子？ 把玩你自己的喜好？
Why don't you get your own fucking life? Your own fucking interests?

958
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:53,360
养尊处优的臭婆娘
Fucking spoiled bitch.

959
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:04,230
人生似乎充满了 类似鬼兰的事物
Life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid.

960
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,840
美好的憧憬 轻易的产生感情...
Wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with...

961
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,940
但却趋于幻想...
...but a little fantastic...

962
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,910
而且稍纵即逝...
...and fleeting...

963
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,440
难以捉摸
...and out of reach.

964
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,520
三年后

965
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,930
“...但却趋于幻想 稍纵即逝，而且难以捉摸”
''...but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach.''

966
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,490
魅力

967
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,330
纽约客

968
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,560
喂？
Hello?

969
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,670
嘿，我是马帝，进行得如何？
Hey, it's Marty. How's it going?

970
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,670
和原作者谈过有帮助吗？ 她叫什么来的？
Has it been helpful talking to the writer? What's her name?

971
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,140
苏丝欧琳，很顺利
Susan Orlean. It's been okay.

972
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,770
我是说有没有什么进展？
Well, l mean, are you making headway?

973
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,970
薇拉逼得我喘不过气
Valerie's breathing down my neck.

974
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,880
- 灵感不能催逼 - 好吧好吧，算你有理
- You can't rush inspiration. - Okay. All right. Fair enough.

975
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,450
我打电话的另一理由 是关于“3”
Listen, the other reason l called was The Three.

976
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,690
简直棒极了
lt's just amazing.

977
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,920
- 我不知道那是什么 - 唐诺的剧本啊
- l don't know what that is. - Donald's script.

978
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:45,790
一部慧诘、锐利的恐怖片 是我今年读到最棒的剧本
A smart, edgy thriller. It's the best script I've read all year.

979
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,800
- 很好 - 是啊，我要卖它个好价钱
- Good. - Yeah, I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.

980
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,670
一家出两个才子
Two fucking talented guys in one family.

981
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,440
其实，何不让你老弟 在兰花上助你一臂之力
In fact, maybe you could get your brother to help you with the orchid thing.

982
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:06,350
- 马帝，别这样说，我是说... - 好吧，只是想想而已，老兄
- Marty, don't say that. l mean... - All right. It's just a thought, buddy.

983
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,110
我是说 他的组织力真是好
I mean, he's really goddamn amazing at structure.

984
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:12,590
- 我得挂断了 - 好的，别了，朋友
- l have to go. - All right. Adios, amigo.

985
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,020
赶快完成它...
Finish that- -

986
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,800
可恶！
Fuck!

987
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,890
劳勃马契 编剧讲习班

988
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,500
好，谢谢
Okay, thank you, thank you.

989
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,410
接着有漫长的三天
We have a long three days ahead.

990
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:39,070
几年后，你们将会在 华丽的酒会上沾沾自喜...
Years from now, you'll be at a posh cocktail party congratulating yourself...

991
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:44,980
庆幸有个好莱坞痞子 和你共渡了这个周末
...on how you spent a weekend with an asshole from Hollywood for your art.

992
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,480
- 我真可悲，我是失败者 - 那么...
- I am pathetic. I am a loser. - So...

993
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,990
写作的真义是什么？
...what is the substance of writing?

994
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,460
我失败了，我慌张了 我已经江郎才尽，一无是处
I have failed. I am panicked. I have sold out. I am worthless.

995
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:57,400
我...还在这里干嘛？
I... What the fuck am I doing here?

996
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,560
我在这里干嘛？真是的
What the fuck am I doing here? Fuck!

997
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:03,970
这正是我的缺点 我毫无主见的来到这里
It is my weakness, my ultimate lack of conviction that brings me here.

998
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,040
走捷径 让你能一步登天
Easy answers, rules to shortcut yourself to success.

999
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:10,440
我会来这里是因为 我介入这一行却毫无所获
And here I am because my jaunt into the abyss brought me nothing.

1000
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,710
这不是想要追求新鲜事物 都必须承担风险？
Well, isn't that just the risk one takes for attempting something new?

1001
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:17,720
我应该马上回去 我要从头做起，面对我的任务...
I should leave right now. I'll start over. I need to face this project head- on- -

1002
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:21,350
如果你要使用旁白 就只有老天爷能帮助你了
And God help you if you use voice- over in your work, my friends.

1003
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:25,090
老天保佑 那是最草率、最松散的写法
God help you. lt's flaccid, sloppy writing.

1004
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,170
哪个白痴也会使用旁白叙述 来说明角色的思想
Any idiot can write voice- over narration to explain the thoughts of the character.

1005
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,100
好吧，先讲到这里 午餐休息一小时
Okay, that's it. One hour for lunch.

1006
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:39,210
引领故事发展的主角 不能没有情欲需求
You cannot have a protagonist without desire.

1007
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,040
否则就说不出一个道理 毫无道理
It doesn't make any sense. Any fucking sense.

1008
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,680
大家了解吗？很好
You follow? Good.

1009
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,320
谁还有问题？
Anyone else?

1010
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,460
如果故事内容很少 编剧应该如何铺陈？
What if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens?

1011
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:01,960
如果人不会改变 就不会产生顿悟
Where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies.

1012
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,860
他们挣扎、挫败 却一事无成
They struggle and are frustrated, and nothing is resolved.

1013
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,200
这是真实世界的写照
More a reflection of the real world.

1014
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,570
真实世界吗？
The real world?

1015
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,300
对了，先生
Yes, sir.

1016
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,600
就是这个真实世界
The real fucking world.

1017
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,440
首先，如果你写的剧本 没有冲突和危机...
First of all, you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis...

1018
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,810
你会让观众无聊到掉泪
...you'll bore your audience to tears.

1019
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:24,680
其次，世上没有事情发生？
Secondly, nothing happens in the world?

1020
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:28,490
你是不是脑筋打铁了？
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1021
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,590
每天有人被谋杀
People are murdered every day.

1022
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,890
有种族灭绝、战争、贪污
There's genocide, war, corruption.

1023
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,690
一天又一天 在世界各个角落...
Every fucking day, somewhere in the world...

1024
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:40,270
有人牺牲生命去救别人
...somebody sacrifices his life to save somebody else.

1025
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,840
每天每天 会有神智清明的人决定...
Every fucking day, someone somewhere takes a conscious decision...

1026
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:46,480
去毁掉另一个人
...to destroy someone else.

1027
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,910
有人找到爱情，有人失恋
People find love. People lose it.

1028
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:53,680
天哪，孩子眼睁睁 看着母亲在教堂石阶被打死
Christ, a child watches a mother beaten to death on the steps of a church.

1029
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,320
有人捱饿
Someone goes hungry.

1030
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,790
有人为了女色背弃好友
Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman.

1031
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,760
如果你还找不到人生题材...
lf you can't find that stuff in life...

1032
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:05,160
那你对生命 真是一无所知
...then you, my friend, don't know crap about life!

1033
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:11,000
为什么还来浪费我的宝贵时间 讨论你的电影？
And why the fuck are you wasting my two precious hours with your movie?

1034
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,960
我对你一点帮助都没有！
l don't have any use for it!

1035
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,770
我一丁点都没有帮助！
l don't have any bloody use for it!

1036
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:20,980
好，谢谢
Okay, thanks.

1037
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,080
- 谢谢你 - 甭客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1038
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,580
不，谢谢你
No. Thank you.

1039
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:29,790
太感谢你了，马契先生
Thank you so much, Mr. McKee.

1040
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:34,980
这课程让人 重新以不同的角度看待写作
This course makes you look at writing in a whole different way.

1041
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,430
- 马契先生 - 是？
- Mr. McKee. - Yes?

1042
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,900
我是早上被你吼的人
l'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

1043
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,800
我没听懂
l need more.

1044
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:48,510
我是那个以为 人生无事的人
l'm the one who thought things didn't happen in life.

1045
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:51,300
对了，好吧
Right. Okay.

1046
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,670
- 很高兴认识你 - 我需要谈谈
- Nice to see you. - l need to talk.

1047
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:58,010
马契先生，我会站在这里 已经够吓人的
Mr. McKee, my even standing here is very scary.

1048
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,510
我通常不擅与人交往
l don't meet people well.

1049
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,240
但早上你说的话 震撼到我的骨子里
But what you said this morning shook me to the bone.

1050
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,650
你所讲的 不只是如何写作剧本而已
What you said was bigger than my screenwriting choices.

1051
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:08,120
而是有关如何做人的抉择 请和我谈
lt was about my choices as a human being. Please.

1052
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:12,650
是啊
Yeah.

1053
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,090
你知道吗...
Well, you know...

1054
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:18,030
我正好需要喝一杯
...l could sure use a drink, my friend.

1055
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:24,030
“- 有些幻想、短暂 和难以捉摸”
''...but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach.''

1056
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,110
然后呢？
Then what happens?

1057
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,910
这是书的结尾
Well, that's the end of the book.

1058
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,710
我希望以单纯方式表现...
l wanted to present it simply...

1059
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,820
不用太宣染的角色特征 或惊悚的故事布局
...without big character arcs or sensationalizing the story.

1060
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:37,080
我希望把花卉表现得 一如上帝的奇迹
l wanted to show flowers as God's miracles.

1061
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:41,190
我要明说 欧琳没有见过鬼兰开花
l wanted to show that Orlean never saw the blooming ghost orchid.

1062
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,050
那是一种失望之情
lt was about disappointment.

1063
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,600
原来如此
l see.

1064
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,720
那不是电影
That's not a movie.

1065
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:53,330
你必须从头来过，加入戏剧成分
You gotta go back, put in the drama.

1066
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:59,740
我已经不能回头，我写了一大堆 错误的开头和进展
l can't go back. l've got pages of false starts and wrong approaches.

1067
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:03,040
- 交卷限期早就过了 - 我教你一招秘诀
- l'm way past my deadline. - l'll tell you a secret.

1068
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,610
最后一幕定江山
A last act makes a film.

1069
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,640
让观众在结局时大惊失色 你就成功了
Wow them in the end, and you got a hit.

1070
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:15,490
可以有缺陷、有问题 但结尾一定要精彩...
You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end...

1071
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,990
你就成功了
...and you've got a hit.

1072
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,490
找一个结尾 但不能捏造
Find an ending. But don't cheat.

1073
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:26,030
更不可以滥用解围人物
And don't you dare bring in a deus ex machina.

1074
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,840
你的角色必须有所改变...
Your characters must change...

1075
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,740
必须是他们自己的变化
...and the change must come from them.

1076
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,210
那样做，就会很好
Do that and you'll be fine.

1077
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,780
你保证？
You promise?

1078
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,520
马契先生
Mr. McKee.

1079
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:54,360
- 你以前是不是上过我的课？ - 那是我弟弟
- Have you taken my course before? - My brother did.

1080
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:57,900
双胞胎弟弟，唐诺 是他怂恿我来的
My twin brother, Donald. He's the one who got me to come.

1081
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:00,330
- 双胞胎编剧？ - 是的
- Twin screenwriters? - Yeah.

1082
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,460
朱里士和菲利浦艾斯丁...
Well, Julius and Philip Epstein...

1083
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,410
北非谍影的编剧...
...who wrote Casablanca...

1084
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:10,510
- 就是一对双胞胎 - 你上课说过了
- ...they were twins - You mentioned that in class.

1085
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,410
有史以来最棒的编剧
Finest screenplay ever written.

1086
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,650
这里是大编剧住宅
Great writers' residence.

1087
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,310
- 唐诺 - 嘿，旅途好吗？
- Donald. - Hey, how's your trip going?

1088
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:21,120
你搭上女专栏作家了吗？ 你这色鬼
You getting it on with that lady journalist, you dog you?

1089
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,450
是啊
Yeah.

1090
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,950
我是要恭喜你的剧本
Listen, l'm just calling to say congratulations on your script.

1091
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:31,000
是不是太棒了？马帝说要帮我 争取6位数高酬，而不是5位数
Isn't that cool? Marty says he can get me high- sixes against a mil- five.

1092
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,670
真太好了，唐诺
That's great, Donald.

1093
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,310
我要谢谢你的帮忙
l want to thank you for all your help.

1094
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,100
我没帮什么忙
I wasn't any help.

1095
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,470
还说呢 你让我住你的房子
Come on, you let me stay in your place.

1096
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,740
你诚心待我 激励我努力的决心
And your integrity inspired me to even try.

1097
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,650
简直像骑脱缰野马
lt's been a wild ride.

1098
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,840
凯瑟琳说她想演凯西
Catherine says she wants to play Cassie.

1099
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,850
噢，拜托
Oh, please!

1100
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:54,010
求求你，唐诺？
Please, Donald?

1101
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,660
凯瑟琳姬娜？
Catherine Keener?

1102
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:59,660
- 凯瑟琳姬娜在我家？ - 是啊，我们在玩吹牛
- Catherine Keener's in my house? - Yeah, we're playing Boggle.

1103
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,630
她真正点 你应该和她交往，查理
She's so great. You should really hang out with her, Charles.

1104
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,360
好，听着...
Yeah. Look....

1105
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,340
我在想
l've been thinking.

1106
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:15,670
你愿意跟我在纽约待几天吗？
Maybe you'd be interested in hanging out with me for a few days in New York.

1107
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,940
好啊，愿意
Oh, my God, yes.

1108
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,280
是吗？
Yeah?

1109
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:21,680
我要让一些人看剧本...
l was gonna show my script to some people...

1110
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:25,690
你也可以看一下 如果你愿意
...and, well, maybe you could read it too, you know, if you like.

1111
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,380
当然愿意，我很荣幸
Of course. I'd be flattered.

1112
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,660
好
Okay.

1113
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,660
谢了，查理
Thanks, Charles.

1114
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:35,130
好的，再见
Okay, bye.

1115
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:50,940
要是你会怎么做？
So, like, what would you do?

1116
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,340
这剧本好像在开我玩笑？
The script kind of makes fun of me, huh?

1117
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,850
- 对不起，我在尝试一些... - 嘿，我不介意，很好笑
- l'm sorry. l was trying something... - Hey, l don't mind. lt's funny.

1118
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,180
好，好吧
Good. Okay.

1119
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,910
那你会怎么做？
So, what would you do?

1120
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:05,930
你和我很不相同，查理 我们的天份不一样
You and me are so different, Charles. We're different talents.

1121
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,590
我知道，只是好玩...
l know. Just for fun...

1122
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:09,960
伟大的唐诺会怎么写结局？
...how would the great Donald end this script?

1123
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:13,040
闭嘴， “伟大的唐诺”
Shut up. ''The great Donald.''

1124
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:17,040
我觉得你少了什么
l feel like you're missing something.

1125
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,740
- 好吧，像是啥？ - 你看
- All right. Like what? - Look.

1126
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:26,710
我在飞机上研究了一下
l did a little research on the airplane.

1127
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:32,080
有时这类故事好像另有含义...
''Sometimes this kind of story turns out to be something more...

1128
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,620
像是生命中的刹那扩张成...
...some glimpse of life that expands...

1129
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:37,630
就像把日本纸球丢进水中...
...like those Japanese paper balls you drop in water...

1130
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,390
让它张开成花 形状非常奇特...
...and they bloom into flowers and the flower is so marvelous...

1131
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:44,590
你会不知不觉 看得入神...
...you can't believe there was a time all you saw in front of you...

1132
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,740
忘怀了周遭的事物
...was a paper ball and a glass of water.''

1133
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,640
第一，这根本矛盾 她说她并不喜欢花
Well, first of all, that's inconsistent. She said she didn't care about flowers.

1134
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:54,070
- 你真是的，那只是一种比喻手法 - 好嘛，但比喻什么？
- For God's sake, it's just a metaphor. - Well, but for what?

1135
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:58,310
是什么把纸球变成了花朵？ 书里并没有说，查理
What turned that paper ball into a flower? lt's not in the book, Charles.

1136
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,880
- 我不知道，你在钻牛角尖 - 也许
- l don't know. You're reaching. - Maybe.

1137
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:05,280
但我认为其实你应该见见她 去了解这个女的
But l think you actually need to speak to this woman. To know her.

1138
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,520
我做不到
l can't.

1139
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,150
- 真的 - 那我去
- Really. - l'll go.

1140
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,090
我用你的名义去
l'll pretend l'm you.

1141
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,060
我愿意这样做，查理
l want to do it, Charles.

1142
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:19,900
我们的最终目的 是要医好你的电影，老哥
We'll get to the bottom of this. We're gonna fix your movie, bro.

1143
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:25,170
但你必须跟我完全一样
But you've gotta be exactly me.

1144
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,770
我要雇全我的名声
l have a reputation to maintain.

1145
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:30,740
你不可以耍宝 你不可以黏人
You can't be a goofball. You can't be an asshole.

1146
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,820
- 我不是黏人精啊 - 你知道我的意思
- l'm not an asshole. - You know what l mean.

1147
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:36,280
不要打情骂俏，不说低俗笑话
No flirting. No bad jokes.

1148
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,720
不要用你的傻笑
Don't laugh how you laugh.

1149
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:42,920
我没有要笑 我会让人觉得我就是你
l'm not gonna laugh. l get to have people think l'm you.

1150
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:44,690
人格保证
lt's an honor.

1151
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,160
那我要开炮了
So l guess l'll bring out the big guns now.

1152
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:54,000
你和老许保持联络吗？
Do you keep in touch with Laroche?

1153
01:15:55,170 --> 01:16:01,300
因为我觉得你在字里行间 对他很有好感，能否说明？
l felt l detected an attraction to him in the subtext. Care to comment?

1154
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:07,610
其实，我们之间 纯粹只是业务公事
Well, our relationship was strictly reporter- subject.

1155
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:13,990
的确这种关系 也会须要密切的接触
l mean, certainly an intimacy does evolve in this kind of relationship.

1156
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:18,650
我是说，我对他述说的每件事 都很感兴趣
By definition, l was so interested in everything he had to say.

1157
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:23,030
当然书写完了 这种关系也就结束了
But the relationship ends when the book ends.

1158
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,730
- 睁眼说瞎话 - 什么？
- Mendacious deceit. - What?

1159
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:31,240
没什么
Nothing.

1160
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,370
最后一个问题
l just have one more question.

1161
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:40,780
如果你能和历史人物共餐 古今皆可...
lf you could have dinner with one historical personage, living or dead...

1162
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:42,420
你最想和哪两个？
...who would it be?

1163
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,820
那我会说...
Well, l would have to say...

1164
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:49,120
爱因斯坦
...Einstein.

1165
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,590
或耶稣
Or Jesus.

1166
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,790
很好
Very good.

1167
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,430
有意思
lnteresting answer.

1168
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,270
- 她说谎 - 为什么？
- She's lying. - What do you mean?

1169
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,240
- 出了什么事？ - 没事，她全答对了
- What happened? - Nothing. She said everything right.

1170
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,140
- 太准了 - 也许她说的都是实话
- Too right. - Well, maybe because they're true.

1171
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,740
你有没有出我洋相？
Did you embarrass me?

1172
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,040
答得太过精准的人都是骗子
People who answer questions too right are liars.

1173
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:17,520
而且都会说耶稣和爱因斯坦 那是包装好的答案
And everybody says Jesus and Einstein. That's a prepackaged answer.

1174
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,960
- “耶稣和爱因斯坦” ？ - 查理，我有个主意
- ''Jesus and Einstein''? - Listen, Charles, l have an idea.

1175
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,180
你要帮我买一副望远镜
You'll need to buy me a pair of binoculars.

1176
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,950
“耶稣和爱因斯坦”是什么意思？
What's ''Jesus and Einstein''?

1177
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,630
一起来
Come on.

1178
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,660
跟我一起唱
Sing with me.

1179
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:39,870
你要望远镜做什么？
What the hell do you need binoculars for?

1180
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,650
我们快过去
Let's go, let's go.

1181
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,280
她挂了电话 有点恼
She hung up the phone. She's upset.

1182
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,510
不要再看了 别理她了
Stop watching her. Leave her alone.

1183
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,420
她哭了
She's crying.

1184
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:55,250
她在用电脑
She's at her computer.

1185
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:57,330
焦距可以调整
This is morally reprehensible.

1186
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,260
联合航空...
United...

1187
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:01,350
到迈阿密
...to Miami.

1188
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,260
11点...
Eleven...

1189
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,960
45分，明天早上
...fifty- five a.m. tomorrow.

1190
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,910
- 我以为她和老许已经结束 - 她父母是住在佛罗里达
- l thought she was done with Laroche. - Her parents live in Florida.

1191
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,600
那不是给爸妈的电话 老友
That was no parent phone call, my friend.

1192
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,180
别叫我老友
Don't say ''my friend.''

1193
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,010
有个男的进来了
A guy entering.

1194
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,850
蛮帅的
Handsome.

1195
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,350
应该是她丈夫
Must be her husband.

1196
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,690
她对他有点怪怪的对不对？
She's acting weird with him, though, right?

1197
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,660
你说呢？
Don't you think?

1198
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,960
她在遮掩什么？
What's she hiding from him?

1199
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,070
也许她是个蕾丝边 不知如何向他表白
Maybe she's a lesbian and doesn't know how to tell him.

1200
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,530
你说呢？
What do you think?

1201
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,900
你上过老许的色情网站吗？
Have you checked out Laroche's porn site?

1202
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,980
没有，我在读书
No. l'm trying to read.

1203
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,170
我倒想看看色情网站
Anyway, l'm gonna look at the porn site.

1204
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,140
研究研究
Research.

1205
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,880
- 不许你去告密 - 跟妈？
- Don't tell my old lady. - You mean Mom?

1206
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:55,640
不是，我不是说妈
No, l don't mean Mom.

1207
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,950
我还是觉得 明天应该去迈阿密
l still say we should go to Miami tomorrow.

1208
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,110
休想
Forget it.

1209
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:03,490
有些马子还不错
Some of these chicks look okay.

1210
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,860
嘿，你猜怎地 明天应该去迈阿密
Hey, guess what. We're going to Miami tomorrow.

1211
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:09,800
- 我说休想 - 我说要，宝贝，你来看
- l said, no. - l said, oh, yeah, baby. Come here.

1212
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:18,970
迈阿密海滩

1213
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:34,250
我渐渐了解改变是盲目的 不能任由选择
What I came to understand is that change is not a choice.

1214
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:38,420
花种不能，我也不能
Not for a species of plant, and not for me.

1215
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,550
改变径自发生，你就有了变化
It happens, and you are different.

1216
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:44,000
法喀哈契，三年前

1217
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,900
我和植物最大的差异...
Maybe the only distinction between the plant and me...

1218
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:49,660
是在于 我隐瞒了我的变化
...is that afterward, I lied about my change.

1219
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,330
我在书里撒了谎 我和丈夫虚情假意...
I lied in my book. I pretended with my husband...

1220
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:56,240
假装一切还是老样子
...that everything was the same.

1221
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:59,870
但那天在沼泽中 发生了一些事情
But something happened in the swamp that day.

1222
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,380
嘿，瞧吧
Hey, look.

1223
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,880
我说我会找到 法喀哈契之宝
l told you l'd find the jewel of the Fakahatchee.

1224
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:15,600
那是一朵花
lt's a flower.

1225
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,960
只是一朵花而已
Just a flower.

1226
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:22,360
也可以据为己有
Well, might as well grab it.

1227
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,370
只要我在这里
Long as l'm here.

1228
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,410
噢，真是
Oh, man.

1229
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,960
我的色情网站要发了
Boy, my porn site's gonna be big.

1230
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,330
有些事情我没有告诉你...
Look, something l didn't tell you...

1231
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:58,960
我要告诉你有关鬼兰 好吗？
...that l want to tell you about the ghost. Okay?

1232
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:02,470
可能对你会有帮助
l think it might help you.

1233
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,980
我刚开始经营苗圃时
l'd just started at the nursery.

1234
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,950
有一晚我折回去拿东西
And I went back one night to pick up something.

1235
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,370
他们用鬼兰来提炼迷幻药
They wanted the ghost just to extract the drug.

1236
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:35,840
本来是用在祭典上的...
lt had been a ceremonial thing...

1237
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:38,850
但年轻的一辈 喜欢沉溺在恍惚当中
...but the young guys, you know, they liked to get stoned.

1238
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,420
所以马邱才会...？
So Matthew...?

1239
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:42,750
- 他也在吸...？ - 当然
- He was one of the guys who...? - Sure.

1240
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,680
马邱一天到晚用它 直到断货
Matthew lived on that shit till they ran out.

1241
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:49,850
那一天他对我发痴
Because there was this one day he was fascinated by me.

1242
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:54,430
对我的头发和我的哀伤着迷
By my hair and my sadness.

1243
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,570
对了，那你就知道了 我就是要告诉你这个
Yeah, well, it does that. That's what l wanted to tell you.

1244
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:03,330
我是说，也许你会喜欢，苏丝 它会让你更加迷人
l mean, l think you'd like it, Susie. lt seems to help people be fascinated.

1245
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:06,570
我可以帮你提炼 我也会，我偷学的
You know, l can extract it for you. l know how. l watched.

1246
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:09,440
我可能是唯一懂门道的白人
l'm probably the only white guy who knows.

1247
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,240
我想要这样做，苏丝
l want to do this, Susie.

1248
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,050
我对兰花已经没兴趣了，老许
l'm done with orchids, Laroche.

1249
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,840
- 喂？ - 嗨
- Hello? - Hi.

1250
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,560
是我啦
lt's John.

1251
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,000
收到我的包裹没？
Did you get my package?

1252
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,700
约翰？
John?

1253
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:50,370
约翰！
John!

1254
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,080
约翰
Johnny.

1255
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:57,110
- 嘿，约翰？ - 怎样？
- Hey, John? - Yeah?

1256
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:05,060
我现在很快乐
Very happy now.

1257
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:07,100
我很高兴
Well, I'm glad.

1258
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,470
非常快乐
Very happy.

1259
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:18,370
你发这样个声音...？
Will you go like this...?

1260
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:30,740
要继续
No. Keep going.

1261
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:38,760
不对，不对
No. No.

1262
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:45,430
我要发生一个拨号声 你要持续发出声音
l'm trying to make a dial tone. And you have to sustain.

1263
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,160
然后我加入，一起出声...
And then l will join you, and together- -

1264
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:51,570
- 我一个人做不来 - 你要我发哪一个声音？
- See, l can't do it by myself. - Which one do you want me to do?

1265
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,070
- 对，对，对 - 好，开始
- Yes. Yes. Yes. - Okay. Here we go.

1266
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,920
- 这就对了 - 我们成功了
- That's it. - We got it.

1267
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:10,580
我们做到了，真好玩
We got it. That's fucking amazing.

1268
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:15,960
你从不会寂寞吗？约翰
Do you ever get lonely sometimes, Johnny?

1269
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,390
我是个怪孩子
Well, I was a weird kid.

1270
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:22,870
没有人喜欢
Nobody liked me.

1271
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,500
不过我在想...
But I had this idea...

1272
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:31,110
如果我等久一点 也许有人会...
...if I waited long enough, someone would...

1273
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:34,440
发现我...
...come around and just...

1274
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:38,790
了解我
...you know, understand me.

1275
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:46,460
就像我娘一般
Like my mom.

1276
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,990
但是个别人
Except someone else.

1277
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:59,710
她会静静望着我说
She'd look at me and quietly say:

1278
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,040
“好的”
''Yes. ''

1279
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:06,170
就像这样
Just like that.

1280
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:11,210
于是我就不再孤单
And I wouldn't be alone anymore.

1281
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,540
我希望自己是蚂蚁
l wish l were an ant.

1282
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,470
它们容光焕发
They're so shiny.

1283
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,640
你比任何蚂蚁更容光焕发
You're shinier than any ant, darling.

1284
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:43,320
这是我听过最甜的赞美
That's the sweetest thing anybody has ever said to me.

1285
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,710
嗯...
Well...

1286
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,260
因为我喜欢你
...l like you, that's why.

1287
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:54,490
佛罗里达，三年后

1288
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:56,160
嘿
Hey.

1289
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:38,970
我没那时间
l don't have time for that.

1290
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:54,750
我走近一点去看，你等着
l'll get a closer look. You wait here.

1291
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:04,000
等一下
No, wait!

1292
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,730
我去
l should go.

1293
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:10,800
我是说，这是我的事
l mean, it should be me, right?

1294
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,270
我是说...
l mean...

1295
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,170

1297
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,080
你行的
You're the man.

1298
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,880
撕开它
Rip them.

1299
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:25,910
撕开它
Just rip them.

1300
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:51,130
亲爱的，我不知道是怎么了
Darling, l don't know what's come over you.

1301
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:56,480
你上次热情如火 我也在的啊
You came all over me last time l was here, as l recall.

1302
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:25,160
天杀的
Goddamn!

1303
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,810
嘿！可恶
Hey! Fuck.

1304
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,410
别跑！
Get in here!

1305
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:32,570
闭嘴！ 坐下！
Shut the fuck up, now! Sit the fuck down!

1306
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,180
- 是谁呀？ - 你是什么人？
- Who is that, Johnny? - Who the fuck are you?

1307
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,010
我... 谁都不是
l just... Nobody.

1308
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:40,920
- 我，我只是... - 等一下，等一下
- l just... l'm just... - Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1309
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:44,060
他是那个编剧
He's that screenwriter.

1310
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,850
- 那个改编我们书的人？ - 对
- The guy that's adapting our book? - Yeah.

1311
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:53,490
这可玄了
Well, that's wild.

1312
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:55,540
高兴认识你
lt's nice to meet you.

1313
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,540
嘿，公子...
Hey, dude...

1314
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:03,740
- 到底谁演我啊？ - 我不知道，我应该...
- ...who's gonna play me? - l don't know that. l should- -

1315
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:06,040
我倒觉得应该由我自己来演
Well, l thought l should play me.

1316
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,480
为什么...？
Why...?

1317
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,350
- 他在跟踪我？ - 没有，当然不是，我该走了
- Did he follow me? - No, of course not. l should go.

1318
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:13,790
我是说 很高兴认识你们...
Yeah, yeah. l mean, it was nice to meet you...

1319
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,050
我把电话号码给你
...but let me give you my number.

1320
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:19,460
我吓坏了，约翰 他为什么在这里？
l'm really freaking here, Johnny. Why is he here?

1321
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:21,520
他为什么跟踪我？
Why did he follow me?

1322
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:25,130
- 他知道多少？ - 我根本什么都不知道
- What does he know? - l don't know anything about anything.

1323
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,770
- 他看见温室了 - 喔，糟糕
- He did see the greenhouse. - Oh, shit.

1324
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,340
喔，糟糕
Oh, shit.

1325
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,210
你要把这一切写进剧本吗？
Are you gonna write about this in your screenplay?

1326
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,430
我根本么不着头绪
l really don't know what ''this'' is.

1327
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:38,680
他扯谎
He's lying.

1328
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,380
- 抓住他 - 别动...
- Hold him. - Stay! Just- -

1329
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:19,090
我们必须做了他
We have to kill him.

1330
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,090
- 什么？ - 不然要怎么办？
- What? - What are we supposed to do?

1331
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,820
- 还能怎么办？ - 做好别动！
- What can we do? - Sit the fuck down!

1332
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,330
苏丝...
Susie...

1333
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,600
你要冷静下来
...you gotta calm down.

1334
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:36,000
你太激动了
Now, you're getting a little emotional.

1335
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:38,730
- 你不懂... - 我不能让他写我
- You don't know... - l can't have him writing about me.

1336
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:43,210
我不要让全世界知道我们的事...
l can't have the whole world, all the people knowing about us...

1337
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:45,310
以及这些
...and about this.

1338
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:48,850
为什么？
Why?

1339
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:51,850
- 你以我为耻吗？ - 不，不是这样
- You ashamed of me, Susie? - No, that's not it.

1340
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,150
- 你怎会这么想？ - 那是...
- No. How can you even think of that? - Well- -

1341
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,490
我是个专栏作家 而且喀药的事...
l'm a professional journalist, and the drugs and- -

1342
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,190
我们不能杀人
We can't kill anyone.

1343
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,330
好，好
Okay. Okay.

1344
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,530
那我自己来
Then l'll do it.

1345
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,370
我自己来
By myself.

1346
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:11,010
- 苏丝... - 嘿！坐下别动！
- Susan... - Hey! Come on. Fucking get down!

1347
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,730
- 我不会说出去... - 把他弄上车！
- l wouldn't tell any... - Put him in his fucking car!

1348
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:28,220
法喀哈契浅滩 州立保育区

1349
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,360
关掉引擎，下车
Turn it off. Just get out.

1350
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:33,790
跑！快走！
Run! Run! Go!

1351
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:37,820
苏丝！什么事？
Susan! What the fuck was that?

1352
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:43,330
我不知道，我看不见
- l don't know. l couldn't see. - Shit. Fuck!

1353
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:46,000
来！帮我找手电筒
Come on! Help me find the flashlight.

1354
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,090
又有一个人？
So it was a guy?

1355
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:21,760
对，很肥
Yeah. Fat.

1356
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:24,430
我只知道这么多
That's all l could tell.

1357
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,680
这太荒唐了 我们要分开来
This is ridiculous. We're gonna have to split up.

1358
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:38,150
我不要自己一个人 我不要
l can't. l can't be by myself out here. l'm not gonna do that.

1359
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:43,420
- 我们会被发现 - 不会
- They're gonna find us. - l don't think so.

1360
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:47,520
我不想死，唐诺 我虚度一生，我虚度了
l don't want to die, Donald. l've wasted my life. God, l've wasted it.

1361
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:51,530
- 你没有，也不会死 - 我虚度了
- You did not. And you're not gonna die. - l wasted it.

1362
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:53,640
我佩服你，唐诺
l admire you, Donald, you know?

1363
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,400
我一生木讷不仁 担心着别人对我的观感...
l spent my whole life paralyzed, worrying about what people think of me...

1364
01:35:57,570 --> 01:36:01,670
- 而你却毫不以为意 - 我才不是不以为意
- ...and you, you're just oblivious. - l'm not oblivious.

1365
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:06,050
你不明白，我是在称赞你
No, you don't understand. l mean that as a compliment.

1366
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:11,010
高中的时候有一次
There was this time in high school.

1367
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:14,210
我在图书馆窗外看你...
l was watching you out the library window...

1368
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:18,120
- 你正在和莎拉玛西谈话 - 我那时好爱她
- ...you were talking to Sarah Marsh. - Oh, God, l was so in love with her.

1369
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:23,460
我知道，你们正在打情骂俏 而她对你百依百顺
l know. And you were flirting with her, and she was being really sweet to you.

1370
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:27,430
- 我记得 - 后来，你走开后...
- l remember that. - And then, when you walked away...

1371
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:31,070
她开始和金姆凯涅 开起你的玩笑
...she started making fun of you with Kim Canetti.

1372
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:36,570
那就像他们在笑我自己
And it was like they were laughing at me.

1373
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:40,610
而你好像全然不知？
You didn't know at all?

1374
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,540
- 你似乎很快乐 - 其实我知道，我都听见了
- You seemed so happy. - l knew. l heard them.

1375
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,690
那你为什么还能那么快乐？
Well, how come you were so happy?

1376
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:54,290
我爱莎拉
l loved Sarah, Charles.

1377
01:36:55,770 --> 01:37:00,630
那是我的爱情
lt was mine, that love.

1378
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,330
我拥有的
l owned it.

1379
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:10,870
即使莎拉也无权否定
Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away.

1380
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,410
我可以爱我想爱的任何人
l can love whoever l want.

1381
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:20,550
但她觉得你很可悲
But she thought you were pathetic.

1382
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:27,430
那是她家的事，与我无关
That was her business, not mine.

1383
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:35,490
你是施爱的人 谁爱你并不重要
You are what you love, not what loves you.

1384
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:41,000
我早就下定这个决心
That's what l decided a long time ago.

1385
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:56,160
你怎么了？
What's up?

1386
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,130
谢谢你
Thank you.

1387
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:03,560
谢啥？
For what?

1388
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:15,140
别出声，嘘！
No, shh!

1389
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:18,140
我听到他们了
Listen. l hear them.

1390
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:21,650
我听到他们的呼吸
l hear them. l hear them breathing.

1391
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,720
查理
Charlie?

1392
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:33,490
- 查理？ - 查理！
- Charlie? - Charlie!

1393
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:36,330
- 两位？ - 查理
- Guys? - Charlie!

1394
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,260
查理！
Charlie!

1395
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,430
车在哪？
Where's the van?

1396
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:19,300
- 他们走了没？ - 不知道，也许吧
- Are they gone? - l don't know. Maybe.

1397
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,730
约翰？约翰！
John? John!

1398
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,750
可恶！
Shit!

1399
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:23,770
我竟然中枪了 这太扯了吧？
l can't believe l got shot. lsn't that fucked up?

1400
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:26,000
闭嘴，别笑
Shut up. Stop laughing.

1401
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:58,470
唐诺？没事的 会没事的
Donald? You're gonna be okay. lt's gonna be okay, Donald.

1402
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:03,210
别睡着，千万别睡 唐诺，看着我
Just don't go to sleep. Just don't go to sleep, Donald. Look at me.

1403
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:06,110
看着我，唐诺 看着我
Look at me, Donald. Keep looking at me.

1404
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,310
张开眼睛 唐诺，张开眼睛
Open your eyes. Donald, please open your eyes.

1405
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:13,150
唐诺，拜托 张开眼睛
Donald. Donald, please open your eyes, Donald.

1406
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,220
唐诺！张开眼睛
Donald! Donald, open your eyes!

1407
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,640
看着我
Look at me.

1408
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:55,250
救命！
Help!

1409
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:06,110

1410

对不起了
l'm sorry.

1412
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:13,830
我不得已
Now l have to do this too.

1413
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:17,140
我也没杀过人
l'm not a killer.

1414
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,440
怪你自己...
You put yourself in- -

1415
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:27,150
约翰！
Johnny!

1416
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:31,990
- 救命！ - 不，不！

1422
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:22,610
去你的，你只不过是个 孤单无望的可悲毒虫！
Fuck you, lady! You're just a lonely, old, desperate, pathetic drug addict!

1423
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:36,420
我的天那
Oh, my God.

1424
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:43,520
完了，一切都完了
lt's over. Everything's over.

1425
01:44:44,130 --> 01:44:46,360
全都做错了
l did everything wrong.

1426
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:52,400
我要从头重新来过

我要重新来过
l want to be new.

1430
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:39,080
喂？

1431
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:44,180
- 喂？ - 妈
- Hello? - Mom.

1432
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:49,060
查理？是你吗？
Charles? Charles, is that you?

1433
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,770
查理，出了什么事？你没事吧？
Charles, what's the matter? You okay?

1434
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:22,560
唐诺说 那是她家的事，与我无关
Donald says, ''That was her business, not mine.

1435
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:26,500
你是施爱的人 谁爱你并不重要
You are what you love, not what loves you.

1436
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:29,960
“我早就下定这个决心”
I decided that a long time ago. ''

1437
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:33,010
考夫曼开始饮泣
Kaufman starts to cry.

1438
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:37,870
他想要谢谢他弟弟 却说不出话来
He tries to thank his brother, but he can't put it into words.

1439
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,750

- So how you getting on? - l'm okay.

1440
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,520
我想念他
l miss him, you know?

1441
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:54,190
- 剧本进行得如何？ - 很顺利，快写完了
- How's the script coming? - lt's good. l'm almost finished.

你也过得好吗？
Things okay with you?

1445
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:06,770
元月份，大卫和我要去布拉格 那是个重点
And then in January, David and l went to Prague. That was a high point.

1446
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:10,040
- 太好了 - 那里的木偶戏很有名
- That sounds great. - There's amazing puppet theater there.

1447
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:12,110
我听说了，一定要去看看
Yeah, l've heard. l've gotta see that.

四万块骷髅和骨头

1450
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:25,390
我到那里时有想到你
l thought about you when l went there.

1451
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:51,180
查理，我在和别人交往 为什么还要吻我？
Charlie, l'm with someone. Why are you doing this now?

1452
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:56,860
我爱你

1453
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:07,030
我该走了，我还有事...

1457
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:55,340
我得赶快回家 我知道结局该怎么写了
I have to go right home. I know how to finish the script now.

1458
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,420
考夫曼和艾咪吃完午饭 开车回家...
It ends with Kaufman driving home after his lunch with Amelia...

1459
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:01,150
心里有了结局的点子
...thinking he knows how to finish the script.

1460
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:04,260
糟糕，这是旁白 马契最反对旁白
Shit, that's voice- over. McKee would not approve.

1461
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:07,550
还有什么方法来表现？ 天知道
How else can I show his thoughts? I don't know.

1462
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:10,890
管他马契怎么说 我自己觉得很恰当
Well, who cares what McKee says? It feels right.

1463
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:13,000
就这么决定
Conclusive.

1464
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:16,730
不知道谁会演我 希望不要太肥
I wonder who's gonna play me. Someone not too fat.

1465
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:20,310
我喜欢那个法国大鼻子 但受不了他的口音
I like that Gerard Depardieu, but can he not do the accent?

1466
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:24,810
总之，完工了 真是太好了
Anyway, it's done. And that's something.

1467
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:29,710
于是： 考夫曼和艾咪见过面 开车回家...
So: ''Kaufman drives off from his encounter with Amelia...

1468
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:33,120
第一次，心里充满了希望

1469

这个好
This is good.

1471
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:30,690
我们是一体的，警官 我终于了解到

1472
01:54:30,850 --> 01:54:33,050
如同身体里的细胞 看不到整个身体

1473
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:36,660
就像鱼看不见海洋 因此我们互相艳羡，互相憎恨

1474
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,950
彼此怨恨，真傻 心脏细胞恨着肺细胞

1475
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:42,100
...摘自 “3”的凯西

1476
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:46,600
永怀挚爱的唐诺考夫曼
