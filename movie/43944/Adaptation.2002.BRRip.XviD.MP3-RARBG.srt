Charles Darwin?
Evolution guy? Hello?

You see that nectary down there?

384
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,737
Darwin hypothesized a moth

385
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,449
with a nose 12 inches long
to pollinate it.

386
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,785
Everyone thought he was a loon.

387
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,162
Then, sure enough,
they found this moth

388
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,372
with a 12-inch proboscis.

389
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,584
"Proboscis" means nose, by the way.
I know what it means.

Hey, let's not get off the subject.
This isn't a pissing contest.

391
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,591
The point is,
what's so wonderful

392
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,803
is that all these flowers
have a specific relationship

393
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,805
with the insect
that pollinates it.

394
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,849
There's a certain orchid
looks exactly like a certain insect.

395
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,602
So the insect is drawn
to this flower,

396
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,939
its double, its soul mate,

397
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,567
and wants nothing more
than to make love to it.

398
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,278
After the insect flies off,

399
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:12,117
it spots another soul-mate flower
and makes love to it, pollinating it.

400
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,745
And neither the flower nor the insect
will ever understand

401
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,873
the significance
of their lovemaking.

402
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,752
How could they know that because
of their little dance, the world lives?

403
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,754
But it does.

Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.
Cool.

504
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,559
Okay, there's this
serial killer, right?

505
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,437
Well, no, wait.
And he's being hunted by a cop.

506
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:00,608
And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.

507
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,319
He's already holding her
hostage in his basement.

508
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,197
So the cop gets obsessed
with figuring out her identity

509
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,616
and in the process
falls in love with her.

510
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,786
Even though he's never even
met her. She becomes like...

511
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,122

Like the Holy Grail.

don't you think?

00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,876
Okay, but here's the twist.

514
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,295
We find out that the killer

515
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,423
really suffers from
multiple personality disorder. Right?

516
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,177
See, he's actually really the cop
and the girl.

517
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,556
All of them are him.
Isn't that fucked up?

518
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:37,728

that cop and criminal are
two aspects of the same person.

have somebody held
prisoner in a basement

at the same time?
