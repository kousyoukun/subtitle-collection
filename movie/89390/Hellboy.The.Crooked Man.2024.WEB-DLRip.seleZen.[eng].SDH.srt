ain't it?

667
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:55,431
That's ridiculous.

668
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:57,651
You were just a kid.
A deal with a demonic entity?

669
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:59,392
How can that possibly
be binding?

670
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:02,047
- Oh, it be binding.
- Hellboy.

671
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:05,006
Yeah, it's kind of binding.

672
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:09,054
Look, there may be some
wiggle room.

673
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:10,533
It's what I'm here for.

674
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:12,361
To renegotiate.

675
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,712
Negotiate, my ass.

676
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:19,325
Well, he do seem like
a pretty persuasive fella,
Reverend, don't he?

677
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:22,502
Men's pride and folly, all
that is.

678
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:26,941
Well, if you're gonna go, best
do it when the sun's up in
the sky.

it's dark.

Y'all stay here tonight.

We got to boogie-woogie, preach.

00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:36,211
Looks like we still
have some daylight left.

00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:37,822
You sure about that?

We've got company.

00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:16,469
A lot of witches around
these parts.

693
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:17,992
Always have been.

694
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:21,648
Used to be plenty of regular
folks, too.

695
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:25,695
Nowadays, mostly just witches.

696
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,877
Haha! Hallelujah.

697
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:37,011
And I will lead the blind
by a way they know not.

698
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:44,714
And I will make
the darkness light for them.

I think of the saddest
thing I can.

706

Let not your hearts be troubled.

Them witches. Can't set
foot on this holy ground.

Ain't no good here.

I guess we'll find out
soon enough.

You doubt the power of
prayers, son?

I just like to have some

do they run under this church?

Oh, they run everywhere.

years ago. Last time the ground

Yeah and I'm gonna give it

You gotta make me one promise.

No harm comes
to those good folks in there.
