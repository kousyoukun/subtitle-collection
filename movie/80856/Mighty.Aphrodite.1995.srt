安提歌尼的父亲, 底比斯的统治者,

00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:35,506
赎罪的渴望使自己盲目.

00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:38,914
成为受迷惑愿望的牺牲者.

9
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:41,746
詹森的太太也不走运.

10
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:46,150
只为了复仇的愤怒而献出生命.
Giving life only to reclaim it in vengeful fury.

11
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,616
为了理解心灵的方式...
For to understand the ways of the heart...

12
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:52,211
清楚地领会诸神的邪恶和无能,
is to grasp as clearly the malice or ineptitude of the gods,

13
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:55,879
他们徒劳而又笨拙的努力, 想制造出完美的替代品
who, in their vain and clumsy labors to create a flawless surrogate,

14
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,045
只给人类留下了茫然和不完美.

15
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:02,087
看看, 例如, Lenny weinrib的情形,
 Take, for instance, the case of Lenny Weinrib,

16
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:06,647
就像希腊神话和它永恒的宿命.
a tale as Greek and timeless as fate itself.

17
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,154
- Lenny, 我们要个孩子吧. - 嘿!
- Lenny, let's have a baby. - Hey!

18
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,155
孩子? 为什么? 因为她怀孕了, 你也想要个孩子?
A baby? Why? Because she's pregnant, you want to have a baby?

19
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,313
- 不. 这是个好主意. - 你可以培养自己的中量级选手.
- No. It's a great idea. - You could raise your own middleweight.

20
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,321
- 我不需要什么中量级选手. - 次轻量级选手也行.
- I don't want a middleweight. - Flyweight.

21
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:19,653
- 不, 这会很有趣. - 你有过孩子吗?
- No, it'd be fun. - Have you ever had children?

22
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:22,486
- 不, 我没有. - 为什么没有?
- No, I've never had children. - Why not?

23
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:25,389
什么意思, ''为什么没有?''  '因为我的第一个老婆不想要孩子.
What do you mean, "why not?" 'Cause my first wife didn't want to have a child.

24
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,651
- 而且我从来没有再婚, 所以-- - 噢, 说得真好.
- Then I never remarried really, so-- - Oh, that's great.

25
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:29,657
- 那我算什么, 善变的人? - 到目前为止是.
- What am I, chopped liver? - Until now.

26
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,657
- 是吗? - 我没有再婚-- 因为你没有让我离婚.
- Yeah? - I never-- You didn't let me finish.

27
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,817
- 不, 是你忘了. - 现在你改变想法了.你以前不想要孩子的.
- No, you'd forgotten. - Now you've changed your mind. You didn't want to have a child.

28
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:37,486
- 你们应该要个孩子. - 就像立体声音响. 给他一个机会.
- You should have kids. - It's like stereo. Give him a break.

29
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,822
- 你不想要孩子? - 噢, 我们--
- You don't want a kid? - Oh, we--

30
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:44,522
我们刚认识时, 她不喜欢去海滩;  她不喜欢汉普顿的人;
When we first met, she didn't like the beach; she hated the Hamptons;

31
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,925
她不想要孩子; 她喜欢东北部地区, 她不想搬家.
she didn't want to have kids; she loved the Upper East Side, she didn't want to move.

32
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:50,985
现在她突然说她想要孩子 想搬到Tribeca.
Now suddenly she's making noise about having a kid and moving to Tribeca.

33
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:54,326
- 除非画廊搬到市中心去. - 嗯, 怀孕的感觉好极了.
- Only if the gallery moves downtown. - Well, being pregnant is great.

34
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:56,487
- 是吗? - 我喜欢这样. 你会被照顾得像英国女王一样.
-  Yeah? - I love it. You get treated like the Queen of England.

35
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,495
- 当然. - 你说得好象这是个美好的事.
- Sure. - You say that like it's a good thing.

36
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,495
- 嗯, 我喜欢纵容孩子. - 她是喜欢.
- Well, I like the pampering. - She does like it.

37
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,496
- 是吗? - 是的, 感觉太棒了.
- Yeah? - Yeah, it's fantastic.

38
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:04,496
我现在没有时间.
I can't give up the time right now.

39
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:06,757
我的工作上有太多令人兴奋的事.
There are too many exciting things happening in my business.

40
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,763
- 让我问你一个问题. - 什么?
- So let me ask you a question. - What?

41
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,095
我很好奇. 如果你不怀孕 你怎么能获得成功? .
How do you plan to swing it without being pregnant? I'm curious.

42
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,155
- 问得好. 真是个好问题. - 不, 这很简单.
- Good question. Very good question. - No, it's easy.

43
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,255
- 我们可以收养. 哦, 是的. - 嗯.
- We'll adopt. Oh, well. - Mmm.

44
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,264
- 不包括我. 我可不想收养. - 说到问题上了.
- Not me. I don't want to adopt. -  There you go.

45
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,265
- 为什么不? 这是个好主意. - 不. 不行.
- Why not? That's a good idea. - No. No.

46
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,822
- 你傻啦. 要, 要我的基因? - 是吗?
- You must be nuts. With, with my genes? - Yeah?

47
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,265
- 收养? 我有获奖的基因. - 噢, 上帝.
- To adopt? I have award-winning genes. - Oh, God.

48
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,823
- 我要把它们遗传下去. - 不, 太疯狂了. 不, 这--
- I want to pass them on. - No, that's crazy. No, the--

49
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,767
我们不想租车也是因为同样的理由, 知道吗?
It's for the same reason we don't lease a car, okay?

50
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,767
- '因为这是所有权的自尊问题. - 好吧.
- 'Cause it's pride of ownership. - Okay.

51
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,824
- 我不想收养孩子. - 不. 听着, 我很抱歉, Lenny.
- And I don't want to adopt a child. - No. Look, I'm sorry, Lenny.

52
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:37,699
这太疯狂了 '这个世界上到处都是贫穷的孩子.
It's crazy 'cause the world is full of needy kids.

53
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,701
- 你知道, 她说得对. - 这是事实.
- You know, she's right. -  That's true.

54
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,702
- 我知道, 可是-- 可我-- - 不, 我就是这个意思.
- I know, but that-- You know, but I-- - No, I mean it.

55
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:45,431
为什么要使这个世界人口过剩呢 还有那么多没有父母的孩子?
Why overpopulate the world when there are thousands of parent-less kids?

56
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,766
就因为你不想有那种孕妇的晨吐反应, 对吗?
Just because you don't want to get morning sickness, right?

57
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,929
- 不, 不是这样. - 那就是你想收养孩子的理由.
- No, it's not true. - That's why you want to adopt a kid.

58
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:52,096
是因为我现在不能放弃一年的时间来做这些事.
I just can't afford to give up a year just now.

59
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,832
算了吧. 不说这个了. 我不想--
Forget it. Subject is closed. I don't wanna--

60
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:57,270
我担心我们可能会收养一个坏“种子”.
I'd be afraid that I might get a bad seed.

61
00:04:57,337 --> 00:04:59,271
- 噢, 你有妄想症吧. - 噢, 别这样.
- Oh, you're paranoid. - Oh, come on.

62
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:02,306
真的! 什么-- 你总是从小报上读这些消息.
That's right! What-- You read that in the tabloids all the time.

63
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,305
- 不会. 坏“种子”. - 是的.
- No. A bad seed. - That's right.

64
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,840
是, 我们收养一个可爱的小男孩, 到他13岁了,
Yeah, we adopt some sweet little boy, and then he turns 13,

65
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,534
我们晚上睡觉的时候, 他会用斧子劈开我们的头.
we'd go to sleep at night, he'd split our head open with an axe.

66
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:12,438
听着, 你为什么要和他说这些? 你知道Lenny的想象力很丰富的.
Listen, why'd you have to go and tell him that? You know Lenny's got a vivid imagination.

67
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:14,770
- 这是很普通的事. - 我也看到过. 你想我和他说什么呢?
- It's a common occurrence. - I read the same paper. What do you want me to tell you?

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,139
无论如何, 你们说 ''他'' 是什么意思 ? 为什么我们不能收养一个女孩 ?
Anyway, what do you mean "he"? Why can't we adopt a girl?

69
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,300
- 我们什么也不收养.不管男孩还是女孩. - 一个小女孩.
- We're not adopting anything. I want no sex. - A little girl.

70
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,842
让男人打游击或者点防守, 好吗?
Let the guy have a short stop or a point guard, will ya?

71
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,206
我们可以买单了吗? 我们-- 我们可以离开这里了吗?
Can we get a check? Can we-- Can we please get out of here?

72
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,334
我来买单. 今晚我付帐.
I'll take the check. I'm paying tonight.

73
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:29,467
- 是. - 你? 我没听错吧.
- Yes. - You? I'm stunned.

74
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:33,673
你付钱, 你打破纪录了. 你-- 再来一次 你就打破DiMaggio的纪录-- 56次连续.
You pay, you break your record. You-- One more and you break DiMaggio's record-- 56 straight.

75
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,677
这不是真的. 喂, 客气点.
That's not true. Now, be nice.

76
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:38,803
拉伊俄斯, 伟大的父亲, 请讲.
Laius, proud father, speak.

77
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:42,142
我很开心有一个孩子...
I, with joy, did have a son...

78
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:45,180
这么漂亮, 这么聪明，又这么勇敢
so fair, so clearheaded and brave,

79
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,873
因为他的到来我有无限的快乐.
that I a thousand pleasures did derive from his presence.

80
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,879
然后发生了什么事?
So what happens?

81
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:53,005
有一天他杀了我.
One day he kills me.

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,981
你不会相信, 他逃跑了, 还霸占了我的妻子.
And don't you think, he runs off and marries my wife.

83
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,947
可怜的俄狄浦斯, 底比斯的国王.
Poor Oedipus, king of Thebes.

84
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:02,541
我的儿子, 我的儿子 无情地杀死了...
My son, my son did slay unwittingly...

85
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,548
我高贵的丈夫...
my noble husband...

86
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,447
然后, 他根本没有意识到, 他是在催促我,
and did, without realizing, hasten with me,

87
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:10,450
他亲爱的母亲, 和他上床
his loving mother, to lustful bed.

88
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:12,779
一个淫乱的行业因此产生...
And a whole profession was born...

89
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:15,113
有时1个小时收取200美元,
charging sometimes 200 an hour,

90
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:17,310
而且还是以50分钟为1个小时.
and a 50-minute hour at that.

91
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:20,819
那么为什么现在孩子是一个主要话题?
And why a child now, out of left field?

92
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:23,909
人们希望它不是用来填补婚姻成长的空虚.
One hopes it's not to fill some growing void in their marriage.

93
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,918
让她去吧.
Leave her be.

94
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:28,714
一个女人想成为母亲的愿望和地球一样古老.
A woman's urge to motherhood is old as the earth.

95
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:31,413
孩子们长大了; 搬出去了.
Children grow up; they move out.

96
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:34,545
搬到辛辛纳提那样荒唐的地方...
Sometimes to ridiculous places like Cincinnati...

97
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,553
也许有时候搬到爱达荷州的博伊西.
or Boise, Idaho.

98
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,553
然后你再也见不到他们.
Then you never see them again.

99
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,985
你会认为偶尔他们会拿起电话.
You'd think once in a while they'd pick up a phone.

100
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:43,783
但是weinrib的婚姻里有成长的空虚吗?
But is there a growing void in the Weinrib's marriage?

101
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:45,788
我们并没有说它有.
We didn't say there was.

102
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:48,755
我们只是猜测所有的可能性.
We're all just speculating on possible motives.

103
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,756
孩子是一个严肃的话题.
Children are serious stuff.

104
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:54,622
看, 这儿有个人杀了他父亲...
Look, here's a man who killed his father...

105
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,623
而且和他母亲上床.
and slept with his mother.

106
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:00,125
我不愿意告诉你 哈莱姆区的人怎么叫我的儿子.
I hate to tell you what they call my son in Harlem.

107
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,191
你好.
Hello.

108
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,784
- 我们可以收养一个孩子了. - 你说真的吗?
- There's a baby we can adopt. - Are you serious?

109
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:11,055
我和Carolyn Hester谈过 她为我们找到了个孩子.
I spoke to Carolyn Hester and she's found an infant for us.

110
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,561
- 不过我们要快点决定. - 我不想要孩子.
- But we have to act quickly. - I don't want a kid.

111
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,650
好了, Lenny, 你知道这有多难得吗.
Well, Lenny, you know how hard it is.

112
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:19,388
听着, 这个孩子今天刚出生, 完全健康.
And look, the baby's one day old, totally healthy.

113
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,553
是未婚妈妈, 没有病.
Unwed mother, no diseases.

114
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:23,719
而且是个男孩. 你不是想要个男孩吗.
And it's a boy. You wanted a boy.

115
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:26,159
Amanda, 我现在不能和你谈这个.
Amanda, I can't get into this with you now.

116
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:28,525
这里不是讨论这个的地方.
This is not the place to have this discussion.

117
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:31,324
我让Carolyn帮我们留意. 她在收养方面很有经验.
I told Carolyn to be on the lookout. She's experienced with adoptions.

118
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:34,796
她知道该注意什么. 这是个男孩, 健康, 早上出生的.

Wonderful. Well, I wanted to talk to you about a special program...

235
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,584
对那些聪明学生的特殊安排.
that we have for bright students.

236
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:26,585
- 真的吗 ? 他合格吗?
- Really? And he qualifies?

237
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,642
- 哦, 对. 完全合格. - 不好意思. 我接个电话.
- Oh, yes. Absolutely. - Sorry. Excuse me.

238
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:32,017
- 没问题. - 因为-- 当你听到他的语法,
- Certainly. - Because-- when you hear his syntax,

239
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:34,019
- 喂 ? 哦, 嗨. - 太了不起了.
- Hello? Oh, hi. - it's amazing.

240
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,316
- 语言能力测试显示... - 他的词汇很好, 嗯, 他的语法--
- Verbal skills are telling. - His vocabulary is good, but his syntax is--

241
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:38,320
- 哦, 很棒. - 他说话象个大人.
- Oh, great. - He speaks like a grown-up.

242
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:40,479
- 不好意思. Lenny ? - 我们能做的就是--
- Sorry. Lenny? - What we can do is--

243
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,783
- 不好意思. 等一下. - 哦, 当然.
- Sorry. Excuse me. - Oh, certainly.

244
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:46,345
我们今晚能不能去圆形剧场 和多里安夫妇吃饭?
Can we meet the Dorians tonight for dinner at Le Cirque?

245
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,821
多里安夫妇? 不行. 因为我们 要去看Edward Albee的演出.
The Dorians? No. Because we have tickets to the Edward Albee play.

246
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:53,324
- 听着, 我不能去. - 我们一定要去. 我们已经等了这么久了.
- Listen, I can't. - We have to. We've been waiting for so long.

247
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:56,050
你不一定要去, 但我真的要去.
You don't have to go, but I really should go.

248
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:58,249
我, 嗯-- 不行.
I, uh-- No.

249
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:01,223
- 这已经是这个星期我们第二次取消去哪里了. - 和Bud一起去吧.
- This will be the second time this week we cancelled something. - Go with Bud.

250
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,815
- 哦, 好吧. - 我不想和Bud一起去. 我又不是娶了Bud.
- Oh, okay. - I don't want to go with Bud. I'm not married to Bud.

251
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:05,984
听着, 去吧. 我们现在可以不谈这个吗?
Listen, go. Can we not discuss it now?

252
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:08,525
哦, 天哪! 太尴尬了.
Oh, my God! That was embarrassing.

253
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:12,618
什么, 就因为我又不想 和世界上最无趣的一对夫妇吃饭.
Well, just because I don't want to have dinner yet again with the world's dullest couple.

254
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:14,921
对啊, 总有一天他们会 赞助我自己的画廊.
Yeah, well, someday they may sponsor me for my own gallery.

255
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,926
- 我说了我去. 我和你一起去. - 真的吗?
- I said I'd go. I'm going with you. - Yeah?

256
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,927
可是我们有演出的票. 太可惜了.
But we got tickets to a show. It's a shame.

257
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:21,757
这次尽量加入我们 别整个晚上像僵尸一样坐在那里.
This time try and join in and don't sit there like some zombie all night.

258
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,090
嘿, 上次我加入你们了, 可你却发火了.
Hey, last time I joined in, you got angry with me.

259
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,459
对啊, '因为我们在谈论I.M.Pei博物馆,  不是Muhammad Ali.
Yeah, 'cause we were discussing the l.M. Pei Museum, not Muhammad Ali.

260
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:30,861
好吧, 是我离题了. 我跟不上那些话题.
Well, my mind wandered. I can't keep on those topics.

261
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:34,728
我只是不想永远都做 Bender画廊的“马达动力”.
I just don't want to be the motor power of the Bender Gallery forever.

262
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,730
我想要自己的Amanda Sloane画廊.
I want the Amanda Sloane Gallery.

263
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:39,856
不是Amanda weinrib, '因为这会有发音问题的.
Not Amanda Weinrib, 'cause there's a euphony problem.

264
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:44,263

 Three, four, run. Three, four, and break the ball.

265
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,422

-  Play 88! - I hope they don't play like this.

266
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:48,590

- 88! Ten-hut!

267
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:50,598
怎么了? 你看起来很沮丧.
What's the matter? You seem down.

268
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:53,189
- 没什么, 我很好. - 你很好?
- No, I'm fine. - You're fine?

269
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:55,199
你肯定在想什么, Lenny.
Something's on your mind, Lenny.

270
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:59,599
听着, 昨晚我又去了那种晚餐聚会.
 Listen, last night I was at one of those dinner parties again.

271
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,032
Amanda-- 你知道, 她上星期带我去了,
Amanda-- You know, last week she took me to,

272
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,034
去圆形剧场和Dorians夫妇吃饭.
to Le Cirque with the Dorians.

273
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,968
然后昨晚又和Grossbards在派克大街吃饭.
And then last night it was with the Grossbards on Park Avenue.

274
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:11,663
之后, 我们开车回家...
And then after that, we were driving home...

275
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:13,668
我不知道该说什么.
and I don't know what to say.

276
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:17,831
那是星期六晚上, 我们停在 派克大街前的红灯前.
It was Saturday night, you know, and we stopped for a light over on Park Avenue.

277
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:21,599
我看到车窗外一个男人和一个漂亮的女生.
I looked out the window and I see some guy and this pretty girl.

278
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,433
他们正散步回家,
And, you know, they're walking home and, you know,

279
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:26,664
那个男的手里拿着星期日日报.
the guy's carrying the Sunday papers.

280
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:30,195
看起来他们在一起很开心, 你知道吗.
It looked like they were having so much fun, you know.

281
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:32,705
而且, 你知道-- 我不知道, 我--
And, you know-- I don't know, I--

282
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,968
我记得以前我和Amanda在一起感觉很棒...
I remember how great it used to be with me and Amanda...

283
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:38,529
在以前的公寓里, 你知道, 感觉非常浪漫.
in our first apartment, you know, how romantic it was.

284
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,972
在那些日子里, 我们一起散步逛街...
You know, in those days it was just a kick shopping together...

285
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,941
或者, 只是走在纽约街头.
or, you know, just walking the New York streets, you know.

286
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:48,976
然而Max来了以后, 所有事情都这么美好.
Then when Max came, everything was so great, you know.

287
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,133
我们曾有这么美妙的时光.
We had such terrific times.

288
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:55,701
我不知道, 已经很久没有这种感觉了, 我们之间曾经的激情.
I don't know, it's been so long since there's been, you know, the old passion between us.

289
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:59,141
我不知道, 可这是我第一次有这样的想法.
I don't know, but it was the first time I had any of those thoughts.

290
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,836
而且, 这让我感到很不安.
And, you know, they made me feel nervous.

291
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:07,273
你今晚不太高兴.
You weren't too pleasant this evening.

292
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,642
为什么, '因为我说不去 你老板Jerry Bender...
Why, 'cause I said no about going to your boss Jerry Bender's house...

293
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,644
- 在汉普顿的家? - 我没事.
- in the Hamptons? - I'll be fine.

294
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,803
我不喜欢汉普顿的人. 你知道的, 就像你自己以前也不喜欢海滩.
I don't like the Hamptons. You know, you used to hate the beach yourself.

295
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,970
对, 但是不包括他的生活方式. lt's private and beautiful.
Yeah, not the way he lives. It's private and beautiful.

296
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,308
你到底为什么发火 ?
What are you getting so angry about?

297
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,505
- '因为你不想去. - 上次我们去了, 结果我喝得烂醉.
- 'Cause you won't come. - Last time we went, I got a tick.

298
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:24,639
- 喝醉 ? 哦, 噢. 有什么大不了的. - 对你来说, 是没什么大不了的.
- A tick? Oh, wow. Big deal. - For you, it wasn't a big deal.

299
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:27,510
- 可是我把裤子脱了, 我两腿间有一个黑东西. - 所有人都会去.
- But I took my pants off, I had a black thing living in my leg. - Everyone will be there.

300
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,605
为了那些潜在的关系, 我可以忍受醉几次.
For the potential contacts, I can put up with a few ticks.

301
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,614
我不能-- 什么关系 ?
I don't-- What contacts?

302
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,705
你知道吗, 听起来你像一个国际间谍.
You know, it's like you're an international spy.

303
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,613
- 你的关系遍布全城. - 我只想要一个自己的画廊, 很快就会有了.
- You got contacts all over town. - I plan to have my own gallery, and soon.

304
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:39,309
太不可思议了, 这些年你变了好多.
You've changed unbelievably over the years.

305
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,316
- 哦, 是吗 ? 你知道什么啊, Lenny ? - 你过去不喜欢这些.
- Oh, yeah? You know what, Lenny? - You used to hate that.

306
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,646
- 人会成长. 他们那些人也会成长. - 这不是成长.
- People grow. They grow. Some people. - It's not growth.

307
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:46,183
你以前不喜欢海滩. 而且Jerry Bender非常迷恋你.
You used to hate the beach. And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you.

308
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:47,682
什么?
What?

309
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,684
- 那个家伙一直盯着你. - 噢, 不. 简直胡说八道.
- This guy stares at you. - Oh, no. That's nuts.

310
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,684
- 这太疯狂了. - 他用意识羞辱了你.
- That's seriously crazy. - He mentally undresses you.

311
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,684
- 他只是很平常地看我. - 一定也不平常.
- That's his normal look. - It's not his normal look.

312
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:56,185
- 如果他那样看我, 我会用砖头敲他. - 好了. 好了, 我们--
- If he looked at me that way I'd hit him with a brick. - Okay. Okay, let's--

313
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,912
- 或者也许会亲他的嘴. - 我们不讨论这个了. 好吗 ?
- Or kiss him on the lips, maybe. - Let's drop this. Please?

314
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:08,252
你什么意思, 你找不到地方?
Well, what do you mean, you couldn't find it?

315
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,480
嗯, 我很抱歉. 你知道, 这里头很黑...
Well, I'm sorry. You know, it's dark in here...

316
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:13,920
而且我-- 你知道, 我们有一段时间没有那个了.
and I-- you know, we haven't done it in a while.

317
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:16,318
- 而且你刚才对我发火了. - 我没有发火.
- And then you got so angry at me. - I wasn't angry.

318
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:19,320
我没有发火. 你到处摸索 弄得我都没有兴趣了.
I wasn't angry. You were fumbling and I was getting out of the mood.

319
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:22,755
不好意思, 我找不到地方. 这-- 我们有一段时间没有那个了.
Sorry, I couldn't find it. This-- We haven't been doing it in a while.

320
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,950
- 好了, 不要在这儿讨论这些了. - 我没有方向感了.
- Okay, let's not get into a whole discussion here. - I lost my sense of direction.

321
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,955
我累了.
I'm tired.

322
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:30,253
所有的婚姻都会经历高峰和低谷期.
Every marriage goes through valleys and peaks.

323
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:32,757
- 现在只是低谷期. - 我不在意经历低谷期.
- This is like a valley. - I don't mind going through a valley.

324
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:36,419
- 可是我不想沉到海平面以下. - Lenny, 为什么要捣乱 ?
- But I don't want to sink beneath sea level here. - Lenny, why rock the boat?

325
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:39,756
你有一个聪明美丽的太太. 还有一个你所渴望的孩子.
You got a bright, beautiful wife. You got a kid that you're crazy for.

326
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,759
我不想捣乱. 我和你说过Max吗 ?
I'm not gonna rock the boat. Did I tell you about Max?

327
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:44,589
因为他的智商很高 他们想把他安排到特别班里.
They want to put him in a special class because he's got a high IQ.

328
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,752
是啊, 有这么聪明的父母. 我的意思是, 你还期望什么呢?
Yeah, well, two bright parents. I mean, what do you expect?

329
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,090
对, 不管他们是谁. 我的意思是, 我还是不知道.
Yeah, whoever they are. I mean, I still don't know.

330
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,127
这就像不断提高的优良品种.
It's like raising thoroughbreds.

331
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:53,286
这孩子肯定来自很优秀的父母.
This kid must come from good stock.

332
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,419
他很漂亮; 智商又很高; 他的性格很讨人喜欢.
He's good-looking; he's got a high IQ; he's got a great personality.

333
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,189
而且他还很幽默.
And he's amusing.

334
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,455
这不是我的功劳. Amanda决定所有收养的事.
This is not my doing. Amanda did the whole adoption.

335
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:02,688
我只是反对. 抱怨, 像一个傻瓜.
I just resisted. I complained, like a jerk.

336
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,697
我的意思是, 一个好父亲, 一个出色的母亲 才能生出像Max一样的孩子.
I mean, a good father, a dynamite mother produces a kid like Max.

337
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:09,196
你知道吗, 我觉得那个父亲 '' 死 '' 了.
I think the father's dead, you know.

338
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,525
- 母亲?
- The mother?

339
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,197
别再查下去了!
Don't go any further!

340
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,356
我知道你想什么, Lenny, 忘了它吧.
I know what you're thinking, Lenny, and forget it.

341
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,264
我怎么能忘了它? 这个想法已经埋到脑子里了.
How can I forget it? The thought's been put into my head.

342
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:27,324
哦, 该死的天意.  有些想法最好不要被想到.
Oh, cursed fate. Certain thoughts are better left unthunk.

343
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,890
我敢打赌这个孩子有一个很出色的母亲.
I'll bet this kid has a dynamite mother.

344
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:32,696
你凭什么认为他不是 从他父亲那里继承所有这些?
What makes you think he didn't inherit everything from his father?

345
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:35,394
所有这些 ? 这不太可能. 不管怎么样我要查明真相.
Everything? That's very unlikely. But I'm gonna find out.

346
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:37,696
让睡着的狗躺下吧.
Let sleeping dogs lie.

347
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:41,362
- 我敢打赌她很棒. - 好奇心. 就是好奇心害死了我们.
- I'll bet she's great. - Curiosity. That's what kills us.

348
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:44,870
臭氧层里并不是怪人或者废话. 而是我们的心灵和精神.
Not muggers or all that bullshit about the ozone layer. It's our own hearts and minds.

349
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:49,372
- 我要查明真相. - Lenny, 别傻了.
- I'm gonna find out. - Please, Lenny, don't be a schmuck.

350
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:54,600
我对收养的事记不太清了 因为我和Amanda很熟.
I remember the adoption vaguely because I'm somewhat friendly with Amanda.

351
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,036
可是我们-- 我们收养他 这还没多久呢.
But it was not that long ago that we-- that we did it.

352
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,129
我想起来我帮她尽量加快事情的程序.
I recall trying to expedite matters for her.

353
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:04,766
我多多少少记得 那个孩子有个单亲妈妈.
I somehow think it was a single parent with no father.

354
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:08,365
对. 就是. 这样-怎么-- 能不能知道她的名字--
Right. Exactly. So-So how-- Is it possible for me to get the name--

355
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,372
如果可以, 我想知道她的名字.
I'd like the name of the mother, if I could.

356
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:12,406
我们会永远保留她的档案.
That remains forever in our files.

357
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:16,431
但是就算我有, 我也不能告诉你.  我可以问一下, 你为什么想知道呢?
Even if I have it, I can't give it to you. May I ask why you want to know?

358
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,440
是, '因为我-我-- 我很好奇...
Yes, 'cause I-I-- I'm curious about it...

359
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,975
如果可以，我想了解所有的资料.
and I'm trying to get all the information that I can.

360
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,498
- 所以-- - 不好意思. 我只能帮到这里.
- So, so-- - I'm sorry. That's all I can help you with.

361
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:26,805
有没有可能, 嗯--
There's no possibility of, uh--

362
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,639
- 不行, 我们有规矩. - 我不明白. 我现在是孩子的父亲.
- No, those are the rules. - I don't understand. I'm the father of the child.

363
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,576
- 我不能查出谁是-- - 规矩很严格. 我们从来没有这么做过.
- I can't find out who-- - They're very firm. It's never done.

364
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:36,304
- 嗯. - 那个小孩现在怎么样 ?
- Mm-hmm. - How is the little boy doing?

365
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,640
- 很好. 他很聪明. 太妙了. - 是吗 ?
- Good. He's great. He's fabulous. - Yes?

366
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,804
- 是的. - 向Amanda问好.
- Yes. - Say hello to Amanda.

367
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:45,278
- 我能不能-- - 很抱歉.
- There's no possibility that I could-- - I'm sorry.

368
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:48,541
- 我-- - 真的很抱歉. 绝对不行.
- There's-- - Really sorry. No way.

369
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:51,637
- 好吧, 谢谢. 谢谢. - 再见.
- Okay, thank you. Thank you. - Bye-bye.

370
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:09,083


371
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,819


372
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:49,156


373
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,957
你在干什么, weinrib ?
What are you doing, Weinrib?

374
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:00,582
别烦我 ! 她马上就回来了.
Don't confuse me! She's coming back in a minute.

375
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:04,023
- 你这么做是犯法的. - 犯法 ? 还有更高的法律呢.
- You are breaking the law. - Breaking the law? There's a higher law.

376
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,650
我查不出谁是我孩子的母亲.
I can find out who my son's mother is.

377
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,817
法官不会这么看的.
The judge won't see it that way.

378
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:11,257
帮我看着点, 可以吗,  看在耶稣的份上?
Keep a lookout for me, will you, for Christ's sake?

379
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:14,385
- 我? 我是合唱队的领唱. - 那又怎么样? 看着点.
- Me? I'm the leader of the Chorus. - So what? Look out.

380
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,392
让你的朋友Bud帮帮你.
Get your friend Bud to help you.

381
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,983
Bud帮不了我. 你知道, Ellie和Amanda是好朋友.
Bud can't help me. You know, Ellie and Amanda are friendly.

382
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:22,085
- Bud守不住秘密. - 为什么这是秘密? 为什么不能让Amamda知道?
- Bud can't keep a secret. - Why is it a secret? Why can't Amanda know?

383
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,287
我和你争这个干嘛 ? Amanda--
What kind of argument am I getting into with you? Amanda--

384
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,294
'因为她不会明白的.
'Cause she wouldn't understand.

385
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,419
哦, 你觉得心虚 因为你已经对你孩子的母亲...
Oh, you're guilty because you already have exaggerated notions...

386
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:30,427
有过分的念头.
about your son's mother.

387
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:33,861
这可以理解 因为事情到了Amanda那里就不顺利了.
It's understandable because things are not going smoothly with Amanda.

388
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:36,590
这就是为什么你一直 只是一个合唱团的成员.
That's why you will always be a chorus member.

389
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,925
因为你什么也不做. 我行动了.
Because you don't do anything. I act.

390
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,190
我采取行动了. 我让事情发生.
I take action. I make things happen.

00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,834
我们三点去看隔壁的房子.
You know, we could see that house next door at 3:00.

469
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:48,836
顺便说一下, 它值得买.
By the way, it's a great buy.

470
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:51,029
我可以打一个简短的电话吗 ?
Is it possible that I could just make one quick phone call?

471
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:53,036
- 当然可以. Ken ! - 是的, Jerry.
- Yeah. Ken! - Yes, Jerry.

472
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:55,366
哦, 不好意思, Ken. 你能带Lenny去打个电话吗 ?
Oh, sorry, Ken. Can you show Lenny the private phone?

473
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,528
当然可以. 走吧, Lenny. 就在那边.
Sure. Come on, Lenny. It's right over here.

474
00:25:57,603 --> 00:26:00,401
听起来那个房子不错. what are they asking again ?
The house sounds exciting. What are they asking again?

475
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,873
Amanda, 听着. 你为什么不, 嗯, 今晚留在这儿呢.
Amanda, listen. Why don't you, uh, spend the night here tonight.

476
00:26:04,937 --> 00:26:07,303
- 你说什么? 你今晚有时间吗 ? - 嗯--
- What do you say? Are you free tonight? - Uh--

477
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:09,305
我们可以坐船出去.
We could go for a sail.

478
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:12,307
你根本想不到躺在甲板上 看星星会是什么样.
You can't believe what the stars look like lying on the back of a boat.

479
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:15,307
- 是. 是想不到, 我想去. 我真的很想去. - 好, 那么就去吧.
- Yeah. No, I'd love to. I really would love to. - Well, then, do it.

480
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,240
可是我-- 不行, 他要回去.
But I-- No, he has to get back.

481
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:20,900
真的吗 ?
Really?

482
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:23,771
- 对. - 嗯.
- Yeah. - Hmm.

483
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:25,775
嗯.
Hmm.

484
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:31,235
我找到Linda Ash的片子了.
I got the skinny on Linda Ash.

485
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:34,766
她演过一些电影. 她不是个明星, 什么也不是.
She's been in a few films. She's no star or nothin'.

486
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:37,140
所以你从来没有听说过她.
That's why you never heard of her.

487
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:40,645
她用的是''Judy Cum''这个艺名
She works under the stage name "Judy Cum."

488
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:43,041
大多数时候, 她是个妓女.
Mostly, she's a hooker.

489
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,237
嗯, 我拿到她的电话了.
Uh, I got her number.

490
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:49,978
Judy Cum ?
Judy Cum?

491
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:51,978
哦, 你从来都不应该找她.
Oh, you never should have looked for her.

492
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:54,206
现在我看到一个大麻烦.
Now I see big trouble.

493
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,680
哦, 天哪. 你真是个卡珊德拉(凶事预言家).
Oh, for God's sake. You know, you're such a Cassandra.

494
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:00,579
我不是个卡珊德拉. 我就是卡珊德拉.
I'm not such a Cassandra. I am Cassandra.

495
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:03,138
- 那就是我. - 我一定要查出来.
- That's who I am. - I gotta check this thing out.

496
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:06,273
你会后悔的. 我现在告诉你, 赶紧放弃吧.
You'll be sorry. I'm telling you, quit now.

497
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:09,908
哦, 还有不要让Amanda 说服你买隔壁的房子.
Oh, and don't let Amanda talk you into buying the house next door.

498
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:13,348
- 这个地方 ? - 对 ! 我看到海滩侵蚀的大问题...
- This place? - Yes! I see big problems with beach erosion...

499
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:15,349
还有繁重的抵押.
and a heavy mortgage.

500
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:20,579
我喜欢那个房子.
Well, I love that property.

501
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,244
- 嗯. - 我们和其他人住的很近.
- Mm-hmm. - We're right near everybody.

502
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:26,547
这不代表我们要一直去看他们 可是我们可以选择.
Doesn't mean we have to see them all the time, but we have the option.

503
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,983
你-- 你不怕海滩侵蚀吗 ?
You-- You're not afraid of beach erosion, right?

504
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:32,748
海滩侵蚀 ? 哦, 别这样,  你现在真是个卡珊德拉.
Beach erosion? Oh, come on, now. You're such a Cassandra.

505
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,751
你现在要洗澡 ?
You gonna take a shower?

506
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:37,378
对. 你可以准备一下晚饭吗 ?
Yeah. Yeah, can you, uh, fix something for dinner?

507
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:39,386
好, 我来做晚饭.
Yeah, I'll make dinner.

508
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:41,579
我煮意大利面条, 可以吗 ?
I'll make the spaghetti, okay?

509
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,883
冰箱里有调味酱.
There's some sauce in the fridge.

510
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:52,288


511
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,823
喂, 请问是Linda吗 ?

00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:26,190
我想, 嗯, 可不可以...
And I wonder if, uh, it would be possible...

515
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:29,194
你明天下午有没有时间.
that you would have some time tomorrow afternoon.

516
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,854
- 你不应该这么做. - 别这样好吗 ?
- You shouldn't do this. - Would you please stop it?

517
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:34,761
- 你要背叛Amanda吗 ? - 我没有.
- You're gonna cheat on Amanda? - I'm not cheating.

518
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:36,852
-我只是想看看她什么样. -你会得病的.
-I just want to see what she looks like. -You can get a disease.

519
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:39,624
- 你不害怕艾滋病吗 ? - 我不会和她睡觉的.
- Aren't you scared of AIDS? - I'm not gonna sleep with the girl.

520
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,629
我只是想看看她什么样.
I just want to see what she looks like.

521

我想了解她. 这只是--
I want to get to know her or something. It's just--

522
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:47,492
嗯, 我们可以在旅馆见面吗 ?
Uh, is it possible that we could meet at a hotel?

523
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:50,292
你会在旅馆和一个妓女开房间 然后不和她睡觉吗 ?
You're gonna rent a hotel room with a hooker and not sleep with her?

524
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:52,422
别管我. 我想和她谈谈.
Leave me alone. I want to talk to her.

525
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,931
59号街的购物中心怎么样 ? 那--
How about the Plaza on 59th Street? Is that--

526
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:58,933
你在干什么 ? 至少应该选一个不显眼的地方.
What are you doing? At least pick an out-of-the-way spot.

527
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:00,932
哦, 天哪.
Oh, Christ.

528
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:03,694
嗯, Linda, 也许这样会更好--
Um, Linda, maybe it'd be better if I--

529
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:06,735
我去你那里 ? 那样可以吗 ?
What about your place? Would that be a possibility?

530
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,734
- 嗯. 嗯--

那个主要的弹簧来回活动, 这个主教就不停地 X 她的屁股.
As the main spring goes back and forth, the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass.

565
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:17,751

568
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:25,618
今天的水有点黄. 你要不要喝点雪碧 ?
The water today is a little bit brown. Would you like some Sprite instead?

569
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:28,156
- 我感到有点头晕. 我-- - 哦, 不 !

- Come sit down. - No, no. I don't know why.

571
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,813
知道吗, 平常我只是健康的化身.
Usually, you know, I'm just the picture of health.

00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:35,915
- 是吗 ? 好点了吗 ? - 没有-- 不够虔诚.
- Yeah? You work out? - Not-- Not religiously.

573
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,391
哦, 我也不虔诚. 我们家里人大多数是主教派教友.
Oh, I'm not religious either. Mostly, my folks were Episcopalian.

574
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:41,721
- 哦, 是吗 ? 那么-- - 是啊.

So what do you do, Lenny? Oh, no. Wait. Let me guess.

576
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:47,585
猜别人是干什么生活的 我有诀窍.
I have a great knack for guessing what people do for a living.

577
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:50,286
- 嗯-- - 嗯, 嗯-- 我会告诉你真相.

- 地毯推销员 ! - 差不多了.

I'm-- I'm a sportswriter. Because--

580
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,727

- Shit. I wasn't even in the ballpark. - Well, it was not--

Wait. Ballpark. Sportswriter. Get it?

582
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,024
- 我明白了.
-  I get it.

583
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:05,188
我曾经和一个摔跤选手那个过. 一个高大的, 多毛的家伙.
I did it with a wrestler once. A huge, hairy guy.

584
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:08,492
你一定会以为他那里会像马一样, 结果那里非常小.
You'd figure he'd be hung like a horse, but there was very little there.

585
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:10,859
等等, 我可以-- 喝一点水吗 ?
Look, could I-- could I just get a little water?

586
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:13,021
- 我不介意是不是黄的. - 哦, 不好意思.
- I don't care if it's brown. - Oh, I'm sorry.

587
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:15,928
我不介意水锈. 我只是觉得有点--
I don't mind rust. I'm just feeling a little--

588
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:19,022
告-告诉我, Linda.
T-Tell me, Linda.

589
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:21,792
嗯, 嗯, 告诉我一点你的事吧, Linda.

00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:59,482
别再管闲事了. 接受现实吧.
Don't meddle any further. Accept the truth.

711
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,451
我看到灾难. 我看到了大灾难.
I see disaster. I see catastrophe.

712
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:05,179
更糟的事, 我看到了律师.
Worse, I see lawyers.

713
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:07,685
不过等等, 信使来了.
But wait, a messenger.

714
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:11,881
我来自Lenny weinrib居住的市中心,
I come from the midtown area where Lenny Weinrib,

715
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:14,614
心底强烈的改变她的激情折磨着Lenny,
tortured by passions too overwhelming to regulate,

716
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:17,154
他确实给那个妓女打了电话...
did indeed call this little hustler on the phone...

717
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,745
真心地希望能再见到她.
in earnest attempt to see her again.

718
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,947
起先他和他的这种动机''搏斗'',
At first he wrestled with his drives,

719
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:23,955
试图控制好奇心...
trying to master a curiosity...

720
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:27,388
可好奇心并没有因为第一次见面而消除, 相反变得更加强烈.
not slaked by this initial meeting, but only whetted by it.

721
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:32,118
他想更多地了解这个女人, 这个欲望 无情地驱使他再次给她打电话.
His thirst to know this woman more did inexorably provoke him to call her.

722
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:35,453
刚开始, 他只收到电话答录机的回答, 他感到不安和烦恼.
Nervous and confused, at first he only got her answering machine.

723
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,719
然后, 在第五次尝试时, 她终于接了电话.
Then, at fifth try, she picked up the phone herself.

724
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:43,056
可是她认为他是个疯子, 再也不想见他. 这使他觉得很痛苦不安.
Painful to relate that she thought he was nuts and did not want to meet him nohow.

725
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:46,821
''别在骚扰我, 烦人的家伙,'' 说着她就挂了电话.
"Stop bothering me, creep," was her cutting declaration.

726
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,018
然后她用了一个 ''F'' 打头的词.
Then she used the "F" word.

727
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:52,618
他痛苦地再次给她打电话, 提出大量的金钱补偿...
Agonized, he called again, offering her abundant financial compensation...

728
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:54,853
以换得和她简短的交谈.
just for a brief chat.

729
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:58,088
但是她拜托他别再烦她 然后狠狠地把电话摔了.
But she bade him get off her back and slammed the phone down.

730
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,186
最后, 怀着忧郁和无限的渴望,
Finally, in doldrums mixed with much anxiety,

731
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,194
他站在她住处外面...
he stood watch outside her apartment...

732
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,697
一直等着, 直到他看到她去自助洗衣店.
and waited until such a time as he did spot her heading for the laundromat.

733
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:12,197


734
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:21,192
- 哦, 天哪! - 好了, 别紧张什么.
- Oh, my God! - Okay, don't get upset or anything.

735
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:23,288
- 我只是想我们可以一起吃饭. - 为什么和我?
- I just thought we could have lunch. - Why me?

736
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:26,025
- 我可以付钱买你的时间. 我只想和你谈谈. - 是吗!
- I'll pay for your time. I just want to speak to you. - All right!

737
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,032
你是什么东西, 他妈的变态--
What are you, some kind of fucking pervert who--

738
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:31,861
离我远点. 我不是-- 我不是那种专门杀妓女的...
Leave me alone. I'm not-- I'm not one of those psychopaths...

739
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,865
精神病患者, 我发誓.
that kills prostitutes, I promise you.

740
00:39:33,931 --> 00:39:37,264
- 你为什么要这么说我? - 开玩笑. 我开玩笑的.
- Why would you ever say something like that? - I'm joking. I'm joking.

741
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:41,462
听着, 做我这行的, 必须小心那些奇怪的人.
Listen, in my work, I have to keep an eye out for strange individuals.

742
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,626
- 哦. - 我知道有一个女孩被杀了.
- Okay. - I knew a girl that got killed.

743
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,964
是啊. 嘿, 我给你买了些花. 这儿.
All right. Hey, I got you some flowers. Here.

744
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:48,969
这些花是给你的. 我们一起吃饭吧. 我付钱.
I got you some flowers. Let's have lunch. I'll pay for it.

745
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:52,493
我会付钱买你的时间. 我只是想和你谈谈.
I'll pay for your time. I just wanna talk to you.

746
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:56,398
然后我妈妈嫁给我第三个爸爸.
So then my mother married my third father.

747
00:39:56,468 --> 00:39:58,868
我的意思是, 我不知道 她有没有嫁给他, 可是他搬了进来.
I mean, I don't know if she married him, but he moved in.

748
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:01,631
我们关系不好. 他是个令人讨厌的酒鬼.
We didn't get along. He was a disgusting drunk.

749
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:04,797
你亲爸爸怎么样? 你实际上--
 What about your hereditary father? Your actual, actual--

750
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,567
哦, 他是个毒贩子 他还是个偷车贼.
Oh, he was a drug pusher and he was also a car thief.

751
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:11,765
他偷钱包, 还入室抢劫什么的.
He picked pockets and, you know, he burgled and stuff.

752
00:40:11,837 --> 00:40:15,295
- 而且他是个癫痫患者. - 哦-嗯. 你没有遗漏些什么吧, 是吗?
- And he was an epileptic. - Uh-huh. You haven't left anything out, right?

753
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,135
- 他还是个邮件诈骗犯 ! - 哦, 邮件诈骗犯. 哦, 这样啊.
- Mail fraud! - Oh, mail fraud. Oh, okay, yeah.

754
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:20,139
- 他就是因为这个被捕的. - 哦.
- That's what they caught him on. - Uh-huh.

755
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:22,639
嘿, 你的胃口好得像伐木工人.
Hey, you got an appetite like a lumberjack.

756
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:24,640
哦. 谢谢.
Oh. Well, thank you.

757
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,641
没什么. 想吃什么就吃吧.
Oh, it's fine. Eat all you want.

758
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:30,871
事实上, 我很饿了. 嗯, 然后当我14岁时我就离家出走了.
I'm very hungry, actually. Um, so then I ran away when I was 14.

759
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,373
哦.
Mm-hmm.

760
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:35,001
然后我和一个叫Johnny的音乐家跑了.
And I went away with this musician named Johnny.

761
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:37,976
可是我们总是争论不休, Lenny.
And it was terrible because we fought all the time, Lenny.

762
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:40,306
所以后来, 他自杀了.
Finally, he committed suicide.

763
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,639
这些年来, 我一直以为是 因为我的厨艺逼死了他.
And for years I thought it was because of my cooking.

764
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:44,643
他始终很讨厌我做的蛤酱.
He always hated my clam sauce.

765
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,305
然后呢, 我就从芝加哥,  费城开始流浪.
And so then I kicked around from Chicago, Philadelphia, you know.

766
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:50,311
到处流浪. 最后到了这里.
All over the place. And I ended up here.

767
00:40:50,377 --> 00:40:52,641
你从来没想过找一份正规的工作吗?
You never thought of just getting a regular job?

768
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:54,702
哦. 当然有, 我找过. 我也做过一些.
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did. No, I did things.

769
00:40:54,778 --> 00:40:58,646
我做过餐厅服务员. 做过按摩女.  还做过电话性交.
I waited on tables. I worked in a massage parlor. I did phone sex.

770
00:40:58,712 --> 00:41:02,079
偶尔我还会设点局骗些钱.
Now and then I would, you know, turn a few tricks in order to make some dough.

771
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:05,809
然后有一天我的朋友Susie打电话给我 问我是否愿意演一部叫...
And one day my friend Susie calls me and she asks me if I want to be in a film.

772
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,576
''攫取快乐''的电影. 我说, ''当然愿意.''
Something called Snatch Happy. And I said, "Sure."

773
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:11,309
我记得当时我非常紧张...
And I remember I was very nervous...

774
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,713
因为你知道, 我从来没有 在拿着摄像机的人面前做过.
because I'd never done it in front of people with a camera before, you know.

775
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:17,841
那是我第一天, 第一场表演.
And so there I am on the first day, on the set.

776
00:41:17,915 --> 00:41:20,577
那个男人从后面 X 我, 知道吗?
And there's this guy fucking me from behind, right?

777
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:24,311
同时还有两个穿得像警察的 男人在 X 我的嘴.
And there's these two huge guys dressed like cops in my mouth at the same time.

778
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,577
我记得我当时在想,
And I remember thinking to myself,

779
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:29,482
''我喜欢演戏. 我要学习演戏.''
"I like acting. I wanna study."

780
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,747
是啊. 真是--
Yes, well. It's a-- It's a--

781
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:36,843
这是进入一个职业的一种方式.
 That's one way of getting into the profession.

782
00:41:36,918 --> 00:41:38,909
嗯, 再说说你的家庭吧.
Um, tell me about your family a little bit.

783
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:41,476
什么? 我已经说过了啊. 你现在都可以写一本书了.
What? I told you already. You could write a book by now.

784
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:43,577
可是, 有没有什么特殊的成员?
But, but were there any unusual members?

785
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:46,917
- 很聪明, 很有才能之类的. - 嗯! 对!
- Very bright ones or brilliant or talented or something. - Mmm! Yes!

786
00:41:46,986 --> 00:41:48,920
- 不好意思. 有. - 嗯.
- I'm sorry. There was. - Mmm.

787
00:41:48,987 --> 00:41:51,080
我爸爸的哥哥应该算是个天才.
My father's brother was supposed to be a genius.

788
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:53,247
我从来没有见过他, 但是 所有人都说他很聪明.
I never met him, but everybody said he was brilliant.

789
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,017
- 真的吗? 他是干什么的? - 他是个连环强奸犯. 他在监狱里度过一生.
- Really? What did he do? - He was a serial rapist. He spent his whole life in jail.

790
00:41:57,088 --> 00:42:00,023
但是如果他老老实实的话, 他应该在数学方面很有天分.
But if he had gone straight, he might have been very good in math.

791
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:02,181
- 数学天分. 那是-- - 对.
- Good in math. Well, that's-- - Yeah.

792
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:04,189
我想我的聪明都取自于他,
I think I got my intelligence from him,

793
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:06,520
因为我家里其他所有人都是懒汉和贱人.
because everybody else in the family is all slugs and lowlifes.

794
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:09,023
- 我是唯一有理想的人. - 是吗?
- I'm the only one with any ambition. - Are you?

795
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,524
那你从来-- 从来没有结婚的冲动吗?
And you never-- never had a drive to get married?

796
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,524
为什么要结婚? 他们都是混蛋.
What for? They're all assholes.

797
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,524
其中有个人常常打我.
One of them used to beat me up.

798
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,525
还有一个人当我不在的时候 和我最好的朋友那个.
Another one used to fuck my best friend when I wasn't looking.

799
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:20,991
- 真恶心. - 是啊.
- It was sickening. - Really.

800
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:23,687
那-- 那我问你.
And-- And let me ask you this.

801
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:26,818
你有没有什么时候想过, 就像,
At any point in your life did you ever think, like,

802
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:29,327
''也许我该要个孩子'' ?
"Maybe I'd like to have a child"?

803
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,628
嗯, 我有过一个孩子.
Um, I-l did have a child once.

804
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:38,184
- 是吗? - 嗯, 这是个伤心的故事.
- Did you? - Ah, it was a sad story.

805
00:42:38,261 --> 00:42:40,525
等我对你多一些了解以后 我会告诉你的.
I'll tell you some other time when I know you better.

806
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:42,858
如果我会对你多些了解的话.
If I ever know you better.

807
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,853
你今天下午有空吗?
Are you free this afternoon?

808
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:49,193
- 干嘛? - 你下午有没有时间?
- Why? - You have some free time this afternoon?

809
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:51,527
- 你终于想做了, Lenny ? - 不, 不, 不.
- Are you finally in the mood, Lenny? - No, no, no, no, no.

810
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:53,655
我想-- 我有一个任务.
I wanna-- I have an assignment.

811
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,665
但我想你可能愿意和我一起去,  '因为我觉得你会喜欢的.
But I thought you might wanna come with me, 'cause I think you'll enjoy it.

812
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:59,666


813
00:43:03,098 --> 00:43:06,534
我想下注在一匹马上, 如果它赢了, 钱归你.
I'm gonna bet on a horse, and if it wins you can keep the dough.

814
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:09,226
就这匹吧. ''卖力的海狸.''
Here's one. "Eager Beaver."

815
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:11,233
我以前演过一片''海狸出巡''...
I once did a film called Beaver Patrol...

816
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:13,927
是讲一些男巡逻员在森林里 发现了一些喝醉的女巡逻员.
about these Boy Scouts who find drunk Girl Scouts in the woods.

817
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,527
然后他们把那些女的带进小屋 然后他们翻看他们的包裹 然后他们拿出那些假阴茎.
And they take them into a cabin and they reach into their packs and they pull out these dildos.

818
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,966
- 然后-- - 好了, 好了. 我们--
- And then-- - All right, all right. Okay, we'll--

819
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:21,968
你确定你要押在''卖力的海狸''上?
Y-You're sure you want to bet on Eager Beaver?

820
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:24,195
- '因为赔率是60比1. - 哦, 对. 我觉得就是它了!
- 'Cause it's a 60-to-1. - Oh, yeah. No, I know it's the one. No!

821
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,463
- 可是赔率是60比1啊. - 这是一个预兆. 我觉得它会赢.
- But it's 60-to-1. - It's a sign. I know it's gonna work.

822
00:43:26,535 --> 00:43:28,594
好的, 好的. 希望是这样.
All right, all right. Famous last words.

823
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:30,694
- 你知道. - 我有预感.
- You know. - I got a hunch.

824
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:32,964
- 你有预感. 好吧. 那我们就押它吧. - 对.
- You got a hunch. Okay. Sure, we'll bet on it. - Yeah.

825
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:35,470
好的. 那如果它赢了, 我们会赢多少?
Okay. So if he wins, how much do I make?

826
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:38,700
60比1的赔率? 嗯... 你会赢, 嗯, 3,000美元.
At 60-to-1? Uh... you make, uh, $3,000.

827
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,967
哦, 天哪! 我可以买那件 喜欢的蓝色南美栗鼠皮大衣!
Oh, my God! I could get that blue chinchilla coat that I wanted!

828
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,971
- 你爱买什么买什么. - 我可以买一个极可意按摩浴缸.
- You could get anything you want. - I could get a Jacuzzi.

829
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,132
- 除非它赢不了. - 哦, 不, 我知道我能做什么, Lenny!
- Except he's not gonna win. - Oh, no, I know what I could do, Lenny!

830
00:43:47,205 --> 00:43:49,469
- 哦, 天哪! 太棒了. - 嗯.
- Oh, my God! This is great. - Mm-hmm.

831
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,871
好了. 我希望-- 我希望你是对的.
All right. You know, I hope-- I hope you're right.

832
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:54,965
虽然这匹马的赔率是60比1肯定有原因.  它可能有小儿麻痹症.
There's a reason the horse is 60-to-1, though. He's probably got polio.

833
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:57,633
哦, 不, 不. 这有预兆.
Oh, no, no. No. This is a sign.

834
00:43:57,706 --> 00:43:59,799
- 好吧. - 我的运气要转了.
- All right. - My luck is gonna change.

835
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:03,240
- 那Linda是你的真名吗? 那是你真名吗? - 我用了很多名字.
- So is your real name Linda? Is that your actual name? - I use a lot of names.

836
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:07,107
我出生时叫Leslie, 但我喜欢用 有美好意味的名字.
My born name is Leslie, but I like to use names that have nice meanings.

837
00:44:07,175 --> 00:44:09,109
就像Mary, 代表处女Mary.
You know, like Mary, for the Virgin Mary.

838
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:11,736
或者Angel或Linda,  在西班牙语里意思是''美丽''.
Or Angel or Linda, which means "pretty" in Spanish.

839
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:14,744
- 不过我的艺名是Judy Cum. - 嗯.
- But my screen name's Judy Cum. - Mm-hmm.

840
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,244
还好这些赛马中没有用这样的名字...
Well, lucky there's not a horse with that name in the race...

841
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,244
- '因为不然我们就会押它了. - 哦, 不, 不, 不.
- 'cause we'd bet on him. - Oh, no, no, no.

842
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,574
我的意思是, 那样 我的律师朋友会考虑告它.
I mean, my attorney friend would take that under advisement.

843
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:23,908
- 哦. - 我对这个名字有专属权.
- Mm-hmm. - I got exclusive rights to that name.

844
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:26,070
好的, 好的. 对.
All right, all right, all right. Yeah.

845
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:28,078
那我问你一个问题.
So let me ask you a question.

846
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:30,909
你有没有担心过一个男人 到你家里, 付给你钱...
Are you ever frightened that when a guy comes over your house and pays you...

847
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:33,913
然后他也许想, 比如把你绑起来杀了你?
that he's gonna maybe, like tie you up and kill you?

848
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:36,413
哦, 不. 我一般都事先收钱.
Oh, no. I always get paid in advance.

849
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,176
- 来吧.
- Come on.

850
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:41,510
- 我们买''卖力的海狸''. 他付钱. - 事先收钱? 那--
- Eager Beaver. He's paying. - Paid in advance? That's--

851
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,514
Lenny.
Lenny.

852
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,515
- 他们正在冲向终点 - 加油, 海狸!
-  They're coming down to the finish. -  Come on, Beaver!

853
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:47,742
- ''秋天的菊花''和''仇恨''领先. - 加油! 冲上去!
- It's Autumn Daisy and Enmity. - Come on! Catch up!

854
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:50,079
- ''卖力的海狸'' 一直落后. - 哦, 靠! 海狸!
- Eager Beaver continues to drop back. - Oh, shit! Oh, Beaver!

855
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:53,174
- ''秋天的菊花''和''仇恨''. 接近终点了. - 海狸! 加油, 海狸!
- Autumn Daisy and Enmity. It's close. - Beaver! Come on, Beaver!

856
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:55,648
- 哦! 海狸! - ''秋天的菊花''领先一个头获胜.
- Oh! Beaver! - It's Autumn Daisy by a head.

857
00:44:55,715 --> 00:44:57,842
- 靠! 最后一个? - ''仇恨''第二个跑到终点...
- Shit! Last? - Enmity finishing second...

858
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:00,077
- ''降旗''第三, - 该死的笨马--他妈的!
- and Lower The Flag finishing third, - Stupid horse got-- Damn it!

859
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,244
- 接下来是''马希的骄傲'', ''真正的蓝水手'', ''一流警报'', - 早知道我花了那些钱!
- followed by Marcy's Pride, True Blue Crew, Classic Alert, - I had it spent already!

860
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:05,615
- 我知道. 放松, 放松, 可以吗? - ''卖力的海狸''最后一个到达终点.
- I know. Relax, relax. Relax, will ya? - and Eager Beaver was last.

861
00:45:05,684 --> 00:45:08,653
这并不是太糟. 我说过这是个风险大的赌注.
You know, it's not so terrible. I told you it was a long shot.

862
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:10,844
- 我从来都不走运. 从来都不 ! - 好了.
- I never have any luck. Never! - All right.

863
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,387
我这一辈子从来没他妈的赢过什么!  什么也没有! 从来没有!
I never won a fucking thing in my entire life! Nothing! Never!

864
00:45:13,452 --> 00:45:16,979
你可以冷静一点吗? 你要学会做一个优雅的失败者.
Will you stay calm? You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.

865
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:20,112
如果是因为钱, 我可以把钱借给你.
If it's the money, I'll lend you the money.

866
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:22,121
- 我可以帮你. - 不, 不是因为钱, Lenny.
- I can help you. - No, it's not the money, Lenny.

867
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:25,452
我不在乎那些钱. 我只是太想赢了.
I don't care about the money. I just wanted to win so badly.

868
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,648
你为什么就想赢呢? 我们来这里玩得开开心心的.
What do you want to win for? We're just out here having a good time.

869
00:45:28,721 --> 00:45:30,985
- 你应该-- - '因为我想打动你.
- You gotta-- - 'Cause I wanted to impress you.

870
00:45:31,055 --> 00:45:34,354
打动我? 什么?  你又没有在比赛中跑.
Impress me? What? You know, you're not running in the race.

871
00:45:34,422 --> 00:45:36,686
什么-- 你不需要打动我. 我--
What-- You don't have to impress me. I'm--

872
00:45:36,756 --> 00:45:39,281
对, 可是我想证明 我可以选一个胜利者.
Yeah, but I wanted to show you I could pick a winner.

873
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:42,848
嘿. 听着, 我选的马也没有赢.
Hey. Listen, my horse didn't win either, you know.

874
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:44,858
好了, 你-- 你确实打动了我.
Come on, you-- you do impress me.

875
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:48,519
你很迷人, 你-- 你很活泼, 你充满活力.
You're attractive, you're-- you're quick, you have a lot of energy.

876
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:51,025
- 你很明显是个高水平的口交者. - 什么?
- You're obviously a state-of-the-art fellatrix. - What?

877
00:45:51,092 --> 00:45:53,856
嗯-- 没什么, 没什么. 我被打动了. --
So-- Nothing, nothing. I'm impressed. Take--

878
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,859
- Lenny, 不要说''没什么.'' - 我被打动了.
- Lenny, don't say "nothing." - I'm impressed.

879
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:58,292
- 你以为我很蠢吗? - 我不认为你很蠢, 不.
- You think I'm stupid? - I don't think you're stupid, no.

880
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:00,793
- 不? - 我觉得你这样生活很傻.
- No? - You know, I think you do a stupid thing with your life.

881
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,793
可是我已经告诉过你了.
But I told you that already.

882
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,294
我不明白这和你有什么关系呢.
Well, I don't understand why it matters so much to you.

883
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,557
嘿, 好了. 我们留下来再赌一次,  这次我为你下注.
Hey, come on. We'll stay for one more race, and this time I'll bet for you.

884
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:10,720
- 是吗? - 让我来下注. 对. 来吧.
- Yeah? - Let me make the bet. Yeah. N-No. Come on.

885
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:12,853
- 我们去窗口那里, 我来下注. - 好吧.
- We'll just go to the window and I'll make one bet. - All right.

886
00:46:12,928 --> 00:46:14,987
最好不要挑个第二名...
Please don't pick one that runs second...

887
00:46:15,062 --> 00:46:16,996
- '因为我想要胜利者, 好吗, Len ? - 好. 嘿.
- 'cause I want a winner, okay, Len? - Yeah. Hey.

888
00:46:17,062 --> 00:46:20,463
不过你知道, 他们给这些马进行 唾液测试. 我不能保证什么.
You know, they give these horses saliva tests. I can't guarantee anything.

889
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:26,793
- 我把你赢的给你了, 是吧? - 对.
- I gave you your winnings, right? - Yeah.

890
00:46:26,864 --> 00:46:30,595
这次比赛很棒. 可惜那匹马只给40美分.
That was a great race. Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.

891
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:33,633
它真是一个幸运儿, 知道吗, 我押他跑第三名呢.
Well, he was a heavy favorite, you know, and I bet him to come in third.

892
00:46:33,698 --> 00:46:36,565
- 至少这样你赢了一些. - 对.
- At least this way you get something. - Yeah.

893
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:38,565
嗯, 你要进来吗?
So, you wanna come in?

894
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:41,795
我要回家了. 我有老婆孩子. 我不能这么做.
I gotta go home. I got a wife and kid. You know, I can't.

895
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:45,893
你只谈我. 你从来不谈你自己.
You know, you only talk about me. You never talk about yourself.

896
00:46:45,966 --> 00:46:49,367
太晚了. 知道吗, 我今天很开心, 但我要走了.
It's late for me. You know, I had a great time, but I gotta go.

897
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:51,698
我觉得我欠你那个一次.
I feel I owe you a great fuck.

898
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:55,795
嘿, 帮帮忙. 上楼去吧, 休息一下, 今晚待在家里.
Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs, rest your ulcer, stay in tonight.

899
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:58,496
我不能待在家里. 我还有6个约会.
I can't stay in. I got six dates.

900
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:00,560
6个约会. 漫长的夜晚, 是吗?
Six dates. Slow night for you, right?

901
00:47:00,635 --> 00:47:04,833
我想要是我在你房里有青霉素特许权.  我会--我会发财的.
I wish I had the penicillin concession in your apartment. I'd-- I'd be wealthy.

902
00:47:04,903 --> 00:47:07,565
好吧. 那, 你会再给我打电话吗?
All right. So, you're gonna call me again?

我会再给你打电话吗? 对, 我会给你打电话. 别担心.
Am I gonna call you again? Yeah, I'll call you. Don't worry.

904
00:47:10,304 --> 00:47:12,568
- 你保证? - 我会的. 我会再给你打电话的.
- You promise? - I will. I'll call you again.

905
00:47:12,637 --> 00:47:14,832

- 恭喜你. - 35年了.
- Congratulations. - Thirty-five years.

910
00:47:33,441 --> 00:47:35,375
- 我从来没想过我们会在一起这么久. - 你和Amanda...
- I never thought we'd make it. - You and Amanda...

911
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:37,375
还有很长的路要走, 可是你们也会做到的.
have a way to go, but you'll make it.

- 你们还这么年轻, 两个都是. - 对, 你们都很年轻.
- You guys look so young, both of you. - Yeah, you do.

913
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:41,575
我们让彼此都很年轻.
Well, we've kept each other young.

914
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:44,236
你妈妈可以成为你姐姐, 你们可以成为兄妹.
Your mother could be your sister, and you could be brother and sister.

915
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:47,244
- 你可以成为我的-- 是啊. - 我不知道该说什么, 不管怎么样--
- You could be my-- yes. - I don't know where that puts me, but anyway--

916
00:47:51,177 --> 00:47:53,668
她看起来真美, 是吗, Lenny ?
She looks so beautiful, doesn't she, Lenny?

917
00:47:53,743 --> 00:47:55,836
- 对我来说, 她总是这么美. - 嗯.
- To me, she always looks beautiful. - Mmm.

918
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:57,845
-我总是觉得她很棒. 还有你--
-I just always find her great. And you--

919
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,846
以前当我说姐妹时, 我就是这个意思. 你们看起来都这么棒.
When I said sisters before, I mean it. You guys look so great.

920
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,436
太神奇了, 带着所有这些责任...
And it's a wonder, with all the responsibility...

921
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:05,844
她开了属于自己的新画廊.
she has opening her new gallery.

922
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:08,472
- 有很多事情要做. - 什么新画廊? 一个新画廊?
- It's a lot of work. - What new gallery? A new gallery?

923
00:48:08,546 --> 00:48:11,174
不, 我没有告诉你 '因为, 我不知道 要到100%确定才可以.
No, I didn't tell you 'cause, you know, I don't know until it's a hundred percent definite.

924
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:13,511
- 哦, 我说了什么不该说的吗? - 可是还没有.
- Well, did I say the wrong thing? - But it's not.

925
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:16,175
- 不, 当然不是. 不, 我只是-- - 要100%确定.
- No, sure. No, I just-- - It's a hundred percent definite.

926
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:18,272
你这么不放心. 现在成功了.
You're so insecure. It's happening.

927
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:21,840
- 嗯, 不好意思.
- Oh, excuse me.

928
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:24,349
- 这发生了什么? - 看起来好像我有资助者,
- What is the story on this? - It looks like I have the backing,

929
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,350
但还没有完全确定.
but it's not totally definite.

930
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:28,350
- 所以我才什么也没说. - 你妈妈说已经确定了.
- That's why I didn't say anything. - Your mother said it was definite.

931
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:30,509
对, 嗯. 看起来如果我确实有资助.
Yeah, well. It seems as if I do have the backing.

932
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:33,245
还有在维奇街这么合适的地方. 你知道吗?
And there is this wonderful space on Vesey Street. You know it?

933
00:48:33,317 --> 00:48:35,512
- 维奇? 对, 我知道. - 对, 在休南区.
- Vesey? Yeah, I know it. - Yeah, down in Soho.

934
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:38,985
看起来好像,  我们觉得我们可以买下来.
And it looks like, you know, we think we can get it.

935
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:41,952
Dorians夫妇投资了一些钱,  不过我--
The Dorians are putting in some money, but I--

936
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:43,952
- 你看起来不是很开心. - 我很开心!
- Well, don't look so happy about it. - I am happy!

937
00:48:44,018 --> 00:48:47,249
我为你感到开心, 可是你知道, 我刚刚才听说这些,
I'm very happy for you, but it's the first I'm hearing of it, you know.

938
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:49,753
- 而且还是你妈妈告诉我的-- - 对, 听着.
- And for your mother to tell me-- - Yeah, well, look.

939
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:52,413
我意识到暂时我会比平常更忙一些...
I realize that for a time I'm going to be busier than usual...

940
00:48:52,487 --> 00:48:54,751
我也知道这会是个难关,
and I know that's a sore point,

941

''把事情弄得一团糟 好像你--
"and mess things up generally as if you'd done--

952

''够了, 我受不了了. 太恶心了!
"Well, I can't help it. It's sickening!

- 你觉得我演得好不好? - 是, 很好.
- You think I'm any good? - Yes, it's fine.

958
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:46,996
我-- 你知道吗, 你问错人了.
I-- You know, you're asking the wrong person.

959
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:49,053
实话告诉你, 我并不是很了解演戏.
I don't know that much about acting, to tell you the truth.

960
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:51,063
哦, 我看得出来你没有太感兴趣.
Oh, I can tell you're not too impressed.

961
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:54,395
不, 不, 不. 我只是在想, 你选的是个很奇怪的角色.
No, no, no. I just thought, you know, it's a very odd part for you to choose.

962
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:57,398
- 为什么? - 嗯, '因为这个是''费城故事''.
- Why? - Well, you know, 'cause it's The Philadelphia Story.

963
00:49:57,463 --> 00:50:00,489

- But I lived in Philadelphia. - What has that got to do with it?

964
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,967
- 我知道这个城市. - 什么? 你这么挑角色--
- I know the city. - What? You pick a part like this--

965
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:08,398
你应该挑和你自己接近的. 那就不会像这样困难.
You should get something closer to yourself. It wouldn't be such a struggle.

966
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:10,558
- 嗯, 那我该选什么角色?
- You know. - Well, what part should I play?

967
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,066
我不知道--和你接近的.
You know-- I don't know. Something closer.

968
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:15,727
Clint Eastwood不会演 一个温顺的小美容师.
Clint Eastwood doesn't play a meek little hairdresser.

969

嗯, 我可以演美容师.
Well, I could play a hairdresser.

970
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:20,398
我-我过去-- 我过去经常做.
I-I used to-- I used to do it a lot.

971
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:22,401
我想成为一个美容师. 我很擅长这个.
I wanted to be one. I was very good at it.

972
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:25,061
- 那你为什么放弃了呢? - 我不知道.
- So why'd you give it up? - Well, I don't know.

973
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:27,069
事情一件接一件发生.
One thing led to another.

974
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:29,160
我阿姨在美容院干了好几年.
You know, my aunt worked in a beauty parlor for years.

975
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:31,796
她很喜欢这个.

976
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:34,804
等等. 你的意思是不当演员了?
Wait. You mean not be an actress?

977
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,668
演员是个很艰难的生活, 知道吗.
Well, an actress is a very tough life, you know.

978
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:40,534
- 可是美容师总是可以赚很多钱. - 很多钱?
- But a hairdresser could always make a buck. - A buck?

979
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,402
很多钱! 很多干净钱. 没有打人, 没有艾滋病.
A buck! An honest buck. No beatings, no AIDS.

980
00:50:43,471 --> 00:50:45,405
你可以认识一些--
You can meet somebody that you, you know--

981
00:50:45,471 --> 00:50:48,736
你可以有个家庭, 有真正的生活, 有个关心你的人.
You can get a family, have a real life, someone that cares for you.

982
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:50,739
嘿!

983
00:50:50,805 --> 00:50:53,399
你以为我不想认识某些人, 然后结婚吗...
Now, don't you think that I want to meet somebody and get married...

984
00:50:53,472 --> 00:50:55,736
离开这该死的你死我活的斗争?
and get the hell out of the rat race?

985
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:58,900
我想离开这里 好好做个母亲, 养孩子.
I would like to move away and become a mother and just raise kids.

986
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,907
我连美容师也不想做.
I don't even want to be a hairdresser.

987
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,340
如果Clint Eastwood想当美容师,  就让他去做吧.
If Clint Eastwood wants to be a hairdresser, just let him.

988
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:07,343
你误会我的意思了. Clint Eastwood 不想成为一个美容师.
You missed the point. Clint Eastwood doesn't want to be a hairdresser.

989
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:09,932
我有过一个孩子, Lenny,
I had a kid, Lenny,

990
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:12,442
我把他送人收养了.
and I gave him up for adoption.

991
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:18,446
这是我这一生做过的最遗憾的事e.
It's the sorriest thing I ever did in my entire life.

992
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,937
没有一天我不会...
There's not a day that doesn't go by that I don't...

993
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,002
因为想到他半夜醒来.
wake up thinking about him.

994
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:28,342
现在某个幸运的家庭拥有他.
Now some lucky family has him.

995
00:51:28,411 --> 00:51:31,847
我只求上帝保佑他们好好照顾他.
I just hope to God that they're taking good care of him.

996
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:36,008
为什么你放弃他呢?
Why'd you give him up?

997
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,843
我不知道. 我当时-- 我当时很困惑.
I don't know. I was-- I was all confused.

998
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:42,110
我没有钱. 我-我-- 我不知道该怎么办.
I had no dough. I-I-- I didn't know what to do.

999
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,239
我--
I--

1000
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,247
我连谁是他父亲都不知道.
I didn't even know who the father was.

1001
00:51:46,314 --> 00:51:49,010
可能是几百个男人中的任何一个.
It could've been any one of a hundred guys.

1002

欢迎来到地球, 感谢那个破掉的避孕套.
Welcome to planet Earth, thanks to a broken condom.

1016
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:42,357
和Amanda一起, 这是运气.
With Amanda, it was fate.

1017
00:52:42,422 --> 00:52:44,481
和Linda一起, 那是自以为是.
With Linda, it's hubris.

Hey, wait a minute. I don't have any interest in controlling her.

1022
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:00,417
我是为了Max才这么做的.
I'm doing this for Max's sake.

1023
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:04,155
当他长大了, 不可避免地要去找他母亲.
When the kid gets older, inevitably he's gonna trace his mother.

1024
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:06,490
然后, 知道吗, 我会更高兴...
And, you know, I'd be happier...

1025

if she was married and a-- a hairdresser, you know,

1026
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:12,862
而不是什么''诱人的女阴''的明星.

知道吗? 他很吃惊.
You know what? He was amazing.

1035

我以为他会不高兴, 可是没有, 他很兴奋, 很支持.
I thought he'd be upset, but no, he was very excited and very supportive.

00:55:01,212 --> 00:55:04,477
你需要的只是一个床垫和一些吊袜腰带. 你们又不是集团公司.
All you need is a mattress and a couple of garter belts. You're not a conglomerate.

1064
00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:06,810
Lenny, 他说他 要砍了我...
Lenny, he said he was going to cut me up...

1065
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:09,313
因为我告诉他我不想再干了.
because I told him I didn't want to work anymore.

1066
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,941
嗯, 我觉得你想退出是个好主意.
 Well, I think it's a great idea that you want to phase out.

1067
00:55:13,014 --> 00:55:15,073
- 他肯定会杀了我的. - 哦.
- He has no qualms about killing me. - Ohh.

1068
00:55:15,147 --> 00:55:17,308
听着, 我们报警. 没什么大不了的.
Listen, we'll call the police. That's not a big deal.

1069
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:19,975
以我的身份怎么能报警呢?
How can I call the police with my setup?

1070
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:22,744
我和你说过无数次...
You know, I told you a thousand times...

1071
00:55:22,814 --> 00:55:24,873
你干的是危险的工作.
you're in a hazardous business.

1072
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:27,315
你看现在怎么样. 现在, 这样-- 不要出去了.
So that's what happens. Now, so-- Don't go outside.

1073
00:55:27,382 --> 00:55:30,510
我不会出去了. 我想, 也许你可以和他谈谈.
I'm not going outside. I thought, just maybe, if you could talk to him.

1074
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,051
- 我? 什么, 你疯了吗? - 对, 因为--
- Me? What, are you nuts? - Yeah, because--

1075
00:55:33,117 --> 00:55:35,813
因为你很聪明 你说话很有技巧.
Because you're smart and bright and you got a way with words.

1076
00:55:35,883 --> 00:55:38,078
我不能和他谈. 我根本都不认识他.
I can't talk to him. I don't even know the guy.

1077
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:41,085
对, 嗯, 他知道我想退出不干 全是你的主意.
Yeah, well, he knows it was your idea that I get out of the business.

1078
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:43,210
所以他说他也要杀了你.
So he said he's gonna kill you too.

1079
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:45,981
- 他说他要杀了我? - 对, '因为这是你的主意.
- He said he was gonna kill me? - Yeah, 'cause it was your idea.

1080
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:50,011
他要划花我的脸 然后把子弹射进你的眉心.
He's gonna cut up my face and put a bullet between your eyes.

1081
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:53,612
真的吗? 他-- 他有没有说是什么口径?
Really? Did he-- Did he specify the caliber?

1082
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:57,087
听着, 我想也许 你可以说服他.
Listen, I just thought maybe you could just reason with him.

1083
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,122
不, 我不能. 我-- 听着, 我从来没有告诉你这些,
No, I can't. I-- Listen, I never told you this,

1084
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:02,748
我有-- 轻微的心杂音...
but I got a-- a slight heart murmur...

1085
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,153
现在那个杂音告诉我''躲起来.''
and right now it's murmuring "hide."

1086
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:07,156
- 我不相信你是个懦夫.
- I don't believe you're a coward.

1087
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:09,918
只有在现实中. 嗯, 这个我办不到.
Only in actuality. Um, this is not for me.

1088
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:12,753
- Lenny, 我需要你的帮助. - 你, 我不是一个暴力的人.
- Lenny, I need your help. - No, I'm not a violence person.

1089
00:56:12,822 --> 00:56:16,758
我-我写曲棍球, 拳击和橄榄球的报道.  这不是我的事.
I-I write about hockey and boxing and football. This is not my world.

1090
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:19,986
Lenny, 我真的想像你说的那样退出, 但他说他不会让我退出的!
Lenny, I do want to quit like you said, but he said he's not gonna let me!

1091
00:56:20,057 --> 00:56:22,685
- 他会伤害我们俩的. 求求你! - 放松, 放松.
- He's gonna hurt us both. Please! - Relax, relax.

1092
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:25,750
你想我做什么? 我该怎么和他谈?
What do you want me to do? How am I gonna talk to him?

1093
00:56:25,824 --> 00:56:27,758
- 嗯, 好的. 你只要-- - 我--
- Well, okay. You just-- - I--

1094
00:56:27,825 --> 00:56:31,090
你只要和他谈, 因为你比他聪明 也比他强壮.
You just talk because you're smarter than he is and stronger than he is.

1095
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:33,923
你是一个很好的人. 所以只要 在你和他谈的时候记住这些.
You're a much better man. So just remember that when you talk to him.

1096
00:56:33,992 --> 00:56:37,758
他只是吓唬人. 他秃头, 戴着个耳环.
He's a little bit intimidating. He's got a bald head and an earring.

1097
00:56:37,826 --> 00:56:40,886
- 你会赢的. 我知道你会的. - 他妈的, 我--我--
- But you'll win. I know you will. - Jesus, I-- I--

1098
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:43,088
你是个好人, Lenny. 你会赢的.
You're a good man, Lenny. You'll win.

1099
00:56:43,161 --> 00:56:45,095
听着, 万一发生了什么事,
Look, in case anything comes up,

1100
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:49,325
我想让你知道我-我是O型血 -阳性, 知道了吗 ?
I want you to know that I-l'm type O-positive, okay?

1101
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:52,421

Derek, I got the feeling you came here and obviously moved...

1102
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,430

into this whole Knick persona.

1103
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:57,090
- 不好意思.
- Did you get caught up, maybe, with a little bit of this Knick, - Excuse me.

1104
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,529

"I gotta be physical, I gotta be tough," and maybe--

1105
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:01,531
我是Gildersleeve., 嗯,  我是Lenny Gildersleeve.
I'm, uh, I'm Lenny Gildersleeve.

1106
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:04,862
我--我是Linda--Linda Ash的朋友.
I-- I'm a friend of Linda-- Linda Ash's.

1107
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:08,367
嗯, 我想也许我们可以--
And, uh, I thought that perhaps we could--

1108
00:57:08,431 --> 00:57:10,365
你看--
See--

1109
00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:12,696
我想和你谈的是...
What I want to discuss with you is that...

1110
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,792
每一个年轻女人的生活中 都会有一个时间,
there comes a time in the life of every young woman,

1111
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:17,925
不只是Linda, 而是每一个人,
not just Linda, but everyone,

1112
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:21,765
她们--她们觉得也许可以改变一下.
that they-- they want to perhaps make a change in their life.

1113
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:25,360
她们也许想安定下来 寻找另一种生活方式.
They maybe want to settle down or explore alternative lifestyles.

1114
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:29,200
我不觉得你对Linda是一个很好的影响, weinrib先生.
I don't think you've been a very good influence on Linda, Mr. Weinrib.

1115
00:57:29,268 --> 00:57:33,568
weinrib. 对. Gildersleeve是我 工作需要所用的一个名字.
Weinrib. Right. So Gildersleeve is a name I use for business purposes.

1116
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:36,035
- 我对Linda有投资. - 没有问题.
- I got an investment in Linda. - No question.

1117
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:38,627
我对此表示敬意. 不过-- 不过现在, 她可能...
I honor that. But-- But by now, she's probably...

1118
00:57:38,703 --> 00:57:40,694
已经十倍或者二十倍或者--
repaid you tenfold or twentyfold or--

1119
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,967
别他妈这么确定, '因为你不知道 他妈的数目是多少!
Don't be so fuckin' sure, 'cause you don't know what the fuckin' numbers are!

1120
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:47,029
就是这一点. 不好意思, 你--你--不好意思.
That's a point well taken. Excuse me, you're-- you're-- Excuse me.

1121
00:57:47,104 --> 00:57:49,800
我-我-我明白你的意思. 这是Pellegrino酒吗 ?
I-I-I understand what you're saying. Is that a Pellegrino?

1122
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:53,102
我可以-- 因为你揪得我的喉咙有点.
Can I-- Because you've bent my throat now a little bit.

1123
00:57:53,172 --> 00:57:56,005
嗯, 气管刚才还一直是直通的.
And, uh, the windpipe used to hang straight until this moment.

1124
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,006
他妈的尼克斯队!
The fuckin' Knicks suck!

1125
00:57:58,073 --> 00:58:00,007
他们需要很好的直传.
They need a good shootin' forward.

1126
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:02,132
对, 嗯, 会有一个三方交易.
Yes, well, there's gonna be a three-way trade.

1127
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,141
我不知道你们听说过吗.
I don't know if you guys heard anything about it.

1128
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:06,471
- 西雅图, 亚特兰大和尼克斯在讨论. - 放屁.
- Seattle, Atlanta and the Knicks are talking. - Bullshit.

1129
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,633
- 不, 不, 不. 没有开玩笑. 我知道. 还没决定. - 是吗?
- No, no, no. I kid you not. I know. It's in the air. - Yeah?

1130
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,767
- 他们在商量一个交易. - 那你觉得新泽西网队怎么样?
- They're discussing a trade. - So what do you think about the Nets?

1131
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:12,866
- 你觉得新泽西网队有机会吗? - 新泽西网队? 是, 我觉得有.
- You think the Nets got a chance? - The Nets? Yes, I do.

1132
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:15,308
如果他们没人受伤, 我想他们很有机会.
If they're injury-free, I think they have a good chance.

1133
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,741
我喜欢新泽西网队. 我想他们 有一两年出局, 就这些了.
I like the Nets. I think they're one or two years away, is all.

1134
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:19,743
我觉得应该有两三年.
I would say two or three myself.

1135
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:22,835
看到没有, 我们三个人, 我们有共同的兴趣.
You see, we have a common interest, the three of us.

1136
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,640
- 我们刚才说到哪里? - Linda, Linda Ash.
- What were we talking about? - Linda, Linda Ash.

1137
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,975
哦, 对, 对. 那个女孩哪里也不能去.
Oh, yeah, yeah. That girl's goin' no place.

1138
00:58:29,045 --> 00:58:32,640
她背叛我, 我要毁她的容 我他妈还要杀了你.
She walks on me, I'll disfigure her and I'll fuckin' kill you.

1139
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:35,976
你看, Kleinholtz博士称之为''付诸行动.''
See, that's exactly what Dr. Kleinholtz would call "acting out."

1140
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:38,139
- 别他妈的告诉我该怎么做! - 我没有!
- Don't tell me how to run my fuckin' business! - I'm not!

1141
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:40,147
我的女孩要做我让她们去做的事.
My girls do what I tell 'em to do.

1142
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:42,147
我没有要建议你该怎么做.
Far be it for me to advise you.

1143
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:44,511
很明显你有适合你需要的工作道德规范.
You obviously have a work ethic that's specific to your needs.

1144
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,640
这就是为什么你可以建立这么一个公司.
That's why you can afford an establishment like this, you know.

1145
00:58:47,714 --> 00:58:49,807
你要忍受他这么对你?
You're gonna take that from him?

1146
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:52,941
冷静点. 冷静点.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1147
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:55,778
我将在这里有个体外经历.
I'm about to have an out-of-body-experience here.

1148
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:58,282
- 展示你的力量. - 展示我的力量?
- Show strength. - Show strength?

1149
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:01,318
这个家伙会把我分成27块装在玻璃瓶里.
This guy's gonna put me into 27 separate Mason jars.

1150
00:59:01,382 --> 00:59:04,647
那个女孩说得对. 她们崇拜力量.  她们轻视懦弱.
The girl was right. They respect strength. They despise cowardice.

1151
00:59:04,716 --> 00:59:06,741
他们只知道力量. 勇敢地站起来.
Power is all they know. Stand firm.

1152
00:59:06,817 --> 00:59:08,876
- 想想勇敢的阿基里斯. - 嘿, 别--
- Remember brave Achilles. - Hey, don't get--

1153
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:12,318
阿基里斯只有阿基里斯之踵一个弱点. 而我有阿基里斯身体所有弱点.
Achilles only had an Achilles heel. I have a full Achilles body.

1154
00:59:12,384 --> 00:59:15,581
- 继续!
- Go on!

1155
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:18,119
你看, 我和你说实话.
Look, I'm gonna level with you.

1156
00:59:18,185 --> 00:59:21,086
我想谈谈Linda Ash的事 我-我--
I want to discuss this Linda Ash thing and I-I--

1157
00:59:21,153 --> 00:59:24,020
你为什么对Linda这么感兴趣, 啊?
What are you so interested in Linda for anyway, huh?

1158
00:59:24,086 --> 00:59:26,782
- 你干过她? - 不, 我们是纯柏拉图的关系.
- Are you fuckin' her? - No, we have a strictly platonic relationship.

1159
00:59:26,853 --> 00:59:28,787
- 是吗? - 很好的衬衣啊.
- Yeah? - It's a good shirt.

1160
00:59:28,853 --> 00:59:32,118
如果你是她的朋友,  别和她说什么愚蠢的想法.
Well, if you're a friend of hers, don't be putting stupid ideas in her head.

1161
00:59:32,187 --> 00:59:34,621
她会因此受伤害的. 你也是.
She's liable to get hurt. You too.

1162
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:36,781
你就让他那么对你吗?
 You're gonna let him do that to you?

1163
00:59:36,854 --> 00:59:39,288
嘿, 听着. 帮帮忙 回到雅典去?
Hey, look. Would you do me a favor and go back to Athens?

1164
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:43,621
你就让你儿子的母亲 做这个拉皮条的白人妓女吗?
You gonna let your son's mother remain a white slave to this two-bit pimp?

1165
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,624
这--开始要这么看了, 对吗?
It-- It's starting to look that way, isn't it?

1166
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,624
- 你弄到尼克斯比赛的票了吗? - 没有票.
- You get them Knicks tickets yet? - No tickets.

1167
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,624
- 我到处都试过了.
- I tried everywhere.

1168
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:52,956
- 你要尼克斯比赛的票吗? 因为我-- - 怎么样? 你知道谁?
- Do you need tickets to the Knicks game? Because I-- - Why? Who do you know?

1169
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:54,958
我? 我-我可以帮你.
Me? I-I can help you.

1170
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,288
我们要电影明星后面那排的座位.
We want seats on the floor, next to the movie stars.

1171
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:00,122
如果你愿意谈谈Linda的交易, 我可以给你球场边缘的座位票.
If you want to discuss a deal with Linda, I can get you courtside seats.

1172
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:02,456
你能拿到那些票. 没有人能拿到那些票, 因为我试过了.
You can't get 'em. Nobody can get 'em, 'cause I tried.

1173
01:00:02,526 --> 01:00:05,120
不, 我可以. 我--我是个体育新闻记者. 我可以拿到.
No, I can, though. I-- I'm a sportswriter. I can get 'em.

1174
01:00:05,193 --> 01:00:07,787
你他妈的帮我妈妈弄到球场边缘的票,
I'd fuckin' give you my mother for courtside seats,

1175
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:09,793
那个不值钱的妓女算什么.
much less this cheap little whore.

1176
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,954
太完美了, 太简洁了. 我知道你什么意思了.
That's perfectly put, succinctly put. I know what point you're making.

1177
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,689
- 如果你他妈的想推掉什么, - 冷静, 一点--
- But if you're tryin' to fuckin' pull something, - Easy. Take it--

1178
01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:18,628
我会开枪从你和她眼珠里射进去!
I will shoot you and her through the fuckin' eyeballs!

1179
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:21,789
在细节上讨价还价太无聊了.
It's silly to haggle over details.

1180
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:25,025
嗯, 我会弄到那些票的. 我保证, 我会弄到那些票的.
Well, I'll get the tickets. I'll get the tickets, I promise.

1181
01:00:25,096 --> 01:00:27,530
然后我们再来谈Linda的事.
Then we can discuss Linda.

1182
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:34,932


1183
01:00:34,997 --> 01:00:36,931
爸爸, 你很勇敢吗?
Dad, are you very brave?

1184
01:00:36,998 --> 01:00:39,933
我勇敢吗? 你问这个问题太可笑了.
Am I brave? It's funny you should ask that question.

1185
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:42,933
那你和迈克.泰森打，谁会赢?
Who'd win a fight, you versus Mike Tyson?

1186
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:45,433
什么? 什么? 谁会赢什么?
What? What? Who would win what?

1187
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:48,434
那你和迈克.泰森打，谁会赢?
Who'd win a fight, you versus Mike Tyson?

1188
01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:51,935
- 我和迈克.泰森? 你觉得谁会赢? - 你吗?
- Me versus Mike Tyson? Who do you think would win? - You?

1189
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,934
毫无疑问.
There'd be no contest, you know.

1190
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,436
前几轮他可能会赢, 但我最终会击败他.
He would probably take the early rounds, but I'd get to him eventually.

1191
01:00:57,501 --> 01:01:00,937
我会在整个拳击场追着他打. 这是我的风格. 一直都是.
I'd chase him all over the ring. It's my style. Always was.

1192
01:01:01,002 --> 01:01:03,937
大体上, 我认为这样可以.  对, 我觉得可以.
 On the whole, I think it will work. Yeah, I think it will.

1193
01:01:04,002 --> 01:01:07,438
唯一一件事就是, 我想画廊从顶部照明,
The only thing is, I want the gallery to be lit from above,

1194
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:10,437
所以我觉得天窗应该加大.
so I guess the skylight will have to be enlarged.

1195
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:12,937
- 亲爱的? 可以上床了吗? - 我还是他?
- Honey? Bed? Could you? - Me or him?

1196
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,938
他. 好吗?
Him. Please?

1197
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:23,739


1198
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,740
不, 对不起, 对不起. 我不能这么做. 我不能.
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't do this. I can't.

1199
01:01:26,806 --> 01:01:30,742
-你为什么这么抗拒呢? -'因为我结婚了, 我有家庭.
-Why are you fighting this? -'Cause I'm married and I have a family.

1200
01:01:30,806 --> 01:01:32,740
而且我爱Lenny.
A-And I love Lenny.

1201
01:01:33,974 --> 01:01:35,908
我爱他.
I love him.

1202
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:38,408
那么, 你想说服谁呢, 你还是我?
So, who are you trying to convince, you or me?

1203
01:01:44,976 --> 01:01:47,410
- 我给你买了个礼物. - 你在开玩笑吧.
- I got you a present. - You're kidding.

1204
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:50,410
真的. 因为你解决了我和Ricky之间的事.
Yeah. For fixing things up with me and Ricky.

1205
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:53,411
- 我知道他一定很粗暴. - 这完全没有必要.
- I know he can be really rough. - That was completely unnecessary.

1206
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,410
很可爱, 可是完全没有必要.
Very sweet, but completely unnecessary.

1207
01:01:55,477 --> 01:01:59,345
你不想要口交, 所以至少我可以给你买一条领带.
You didn't want a blow job, so the least I could do was get you a tie.

1208
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,344
想得对. 这--嗯!
Good thinking. That's uh-- Oh!

1209
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:03,845
- 是, 这个条领带, 是吗?
- Yes, it's a tie, isn't it?

1210
01:02:03,912 --> 01:02:07,348
- 你会穿这么鲜艳的吗? - 如果场合需要的话.
- Would you ever wear anything that bright? - If the occasion demanded.

1211
01:02:07,412 --> 01:02:11,508
就像如果我被邀请参加四月斋戒, 我会--
You know, like if I ever get invited to the Mardi Gras, I could--

1212
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:15,015
哦, 太好了. Lenny, 你要三明治吗?  我要吃个三明治.
Oh, good. Lenny, do you want a sandwich? I'm gonna have a sandwich.

1213
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,015
- 不用, 我很好. 谢谢. - 哦, 好吧.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you. - Oh, okay.

1214
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,515
- 很不错. - 太好了.
- It's great. - Good.

1215
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:22,515
你知道吗, Lenny ?
You know what, Lenny?

1216
01:02:22,581 --> 01:02:26,017
我无法忘记你孩子的照片.
I couldn't get your son's picture out of my mind.

1217
01:02:26,082 --> 01:02:29,017
- 嗯, 他很可爱. - 是啊.
- Well, he's a very cute kid, you know. - Yeah.

1218
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:31,016
Len ?
Len?

1219
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:34,018
我想我会是个好母亲.
I think I would be a good mother.

1220
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,018
我想你会是个好母亲的. 你这么有爱心.
I think you'd be a great mother. You're very affectionate.

1221
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:39,018
- 是吗? - 嗯.
- Yeah? - Mm-hmm.

1222
01:02:39,084 --> 01:02:42,520
我想重新开始. 也许要一个房子. 那会很美好.
I would like to start over again. Maybe have a house. That would be nice.

1223
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:45,519
是很好. 我觉得会很棒的.
It would be great, you know. I think it'd be fabulous.

1224
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:47,519
- 你也能做到的. - 是吗?
- And you could do it. - Yeah?

1225
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:50,520
- 是啊. 嗯. - 现在问题是, 找一个合适的男人.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. - The problem is, now, finding the right guy.

1226
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:53,520
我要找一个爱我的人.
I need to find somebody who'll love me, you know.

1227
01:02:53,586 --> 01:02:55,520
一个关心我, 尊重我的人.
Somebody who'll take care of me and respect me.

1228
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:57,520
我会帮你留意的.
Well, I'll keep my eye open.

1229
01:02:57,586 --> 01:03:00,020
也许--或者--谁知道呢?
You know, maybe-- maybe-- who knows?

1230
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:04,023
唯一一点就是, Len,  他必须和我一样聪明.
The only thing is, Len, he'd have to be as smart as me.

1231
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:07,524
我相信肯定有这样的人, 知道吗, 他会--
I'm sure there's somebody out there, you know, that can--

1232
01:03:07,588 --> 01:03:10,022
- 你会找到和你一样的. - 是吗?
- You'll find an equal somewhere. - Yeah?

1233
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:13,024
不要担心, Len. 我对你放弃了.
And don't worry, Len. I gave up on you.

1234
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,023
- 嗯-- - 我知道这不可能.
- M-- - I knew it couldn't be.

1235
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,287
我来告诉你, 像我这样的年纪, 如果和你做爱,
Let me tell you, at my age, if I made love with you,

1236
01:03:18,357 --> 01:03:20,723
我必须要一个人工呼吸器.
they would have to put me on a resuscitator.

1237
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,223
哈哈.
Ha.

1238
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:24,225
- 这是Max.
-  This is Max.

1239
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:26,225
- Max. - 这是我儿子.
- Max. - This is my kid.

1240
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,225
- 你几岁了? - 5岁.
- How old are you? - I'm five.

1241
01:03:28,292 --> 01:03:30,226
- 你5岁了? 你想成为拳击手吗? - 对.
- You're five? You gonna be a fighter? - Yeah.

1242
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:33,227
等他长大了, 他会是一个中量级选手.
 Max is gonna be a middleweight when he gets older.

1243
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:36,227
像你这么教导他, 他会成为一个重量级选手的.
He's gonna be a heavyweight, the way you're carryin' him.

1244
01:03:36,293 --> 01:03:39,854
我来教你怎么打拳, Max. 我来给你示范组合拳.
I'm gonna teach you how to box, Max. I'm gonna show you a combination punch.

1245
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:42,862
1-5, 1-5. 2, 3, 4, 你要好好学.
One-five, one-five. Two, three and four, you're gonna get.

1246
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:45,862
- 嘿, Ray. 这是我儿子Max. - 你好吗, Max ?
- Hey, Ray. This is my kid Max. - How you doin', Max?

1247
01:03:45,928 --> 01:03:48,863
Max长大后要成为中量级选手.
Max is gonna be a middleweight when he gets older.

1248
01:03:48,928 --> 01:03:52,193
- 也许是重量级? 对, 我觉得是重量级.
- Maybe a heavyweight? Yeah, I think a heavyweight.

1249
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:55,197
- 你要和我一起去练沙袋吗? - 好的.
- You wanna go hit the bag with me? - Okay.

1250
01:03:55,263 --> 01:03:57,197
- 乖孩子. - 他像个玩具.
- Nice kid. - He's a doll.

1251
01:03:57,263 --> 01:03:59,197
嗯, Sanchez的训练怎么样了?
So, what's with the Sanchez thing?

1252
01:03:59,263 --> 01:04:02,198
他能赢吗? 他在训练吗? 他没有训练吗?
Is he gonna win that? ls he training? ls he not training?

1253
01:04:02,264 --> 01:04:05,199
- 他能赢. 他现在状态最好了. - 是吗?
- He can do it. He's in the best shape of his life. - Yeah?

1254
01:04:05,264 --> 01:04:08,199
唯一一点就是, 你不知道这些家伙 在体育馆外面干什么.
The only thing is, you don't know what these guys do outside the gym.

1255
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:11,200
- 就是这个问题. 你听说所有的事了. - 他会没事的.
- Well, that's the point. You hear all these stories. - He'll be all right.

1256
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:14,701
嘿, Kevin, 过来. 我给你介绍 我的朋友Lenny weinrib.
Hey, Kevin, come here. I wanna introduce you to my friend Lenny Weinrib.

1257
01:04:14,765 --> 01:04:18,701
- 他是个体育新闻记者. 他也报道拳击. - 你好吗?
- He's a sportswriter. He writes about boxing. - How you doin'?

1258
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:22,202
- 听着, 我要热身, 知道吗? - 让我们看看你能做什么.
- Listen, I'm gonna get warmed up, all right? - Show us what you can do.

1259
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:25,202
- 我的手仍然有点疼. - 好好包扎. 你会没事的.
- My hand's still a little sore. - Wrap it up good. You'll be okay.

1260
01:04:25,268 --> 01:04:28,704
- 我不认识那个孩子. - 那孩子移动很快. 出拳也不错.
- I don't know that kid. - This kid can move. He hits good too.

1261
01:04:28,768 --> 01:04:30,702
你知道吗, 拳速也很快?
Got nice hand speed, you know?

1262
01:04:30,768 --> 01:04:34,204
唯一一点就是, 你不知道这些家伙 --有时候他们缺乏渴望.
Only thing is, you don't know about these guys-- sometimes they lack desire.

1263
01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:37,204
我见识过无数次了.  我不知道他有没有杀手的本能.
I seen it a million times. I don't know if he's got the killer instinct.

1264
01:04:37,269 --> 01:04:41,205
他一直在说要回北部 回那个洋葱农场.
Keeps talkin' about goin' back upstate where he comes from on an onion farm.

1265
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:44,706
- 他想成为一个洋葱农民. 你相信吗? - 那孩子是个农民?
- He wants to be an onion farmer. You believe it? - That kid's a farmer?

1266
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:47,204
对, 他是个洋葱农民.  我不知道他还会逗留多久.
He's an onion farmer, yeah. I don't know how long he's gonna stick around.

1267
01:04:47,271 --> 01:04:51,207
就是这个问题. 也很可惜; 他打起拳来像他妈的骡子.
That's the problem. It's a shame too; he hits like a fuckin' mule.

1268
01:04:51,272 --> 01:04:54,708
他动作很快, 可是却想放弃拳击, 回去在农场闲逛.
He's fast, but he wants to quit boxing, go back and hang out on the farm.

1269
01:04:54,772 --> 01:04:56,637
退休.
You know, retire.

1270
01:04:56,705 --> 01:05:00,141
而且最糟糕的事, 他的女朋友离开他了.
And the worst thing of all is, his girlfriend left him.

1271
01:05:00,206 --> 01:05:02,140
- 她甩了他. - 真的吗?
- She quit on him. - Really?

1272
01:05:02,206 --> 01:05:04,140
拿走了他所有东西.
Took him for everything he's got.

1273
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:08,143
他很不错, 很可爱的孩子, 可是 我只告诉你, 他脑子有点...
He's a nice, sweet kid, but between you and I, he ain't got too much upstairs.

1274
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:11,142
他们都一样. 嘿, Len, 你怎么了?
They're all alike. Hey, Len, what's the matter with you?

1275
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:14,143
看起来好像你脑子里在想什么.  我不明白.
Looks like you got somethin' on your mind. I don't understand.

1276
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:16,108
Hey, Bo!
Hey, Bo!

1277
01:05:16,175 --> 01:05:19,110
这-- 这是左, 这是右.
This-- This is the left, and this is the right.

1278
01:05:19,175 --> 01:05:22,110
- 对吗? - 对, 对, Kevin, 没错.
- Right? - Yeah, yeah, Kevin, that's right.

1279
01:05:22,176 --> 01:05:24,110
对.
Yeah.

1280
01:05:25,277 --> 01:05:27,211
[ Linda ] Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

1281
01:05:27,277 --> 01:05:30,212
- 嗨, Lenny. 很抱歉我要迟到了. - 没关系.
- Hi, Lenny. I'm so sorry I'm late. - It's okay.

1282
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:33,213
- 下雨了. - 哦, 我没有伞.
- It's starting to rain. - Oh, I don't have an umbrella.

1283
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:36,714
今天下午我认识一个男孩 我觉得对你很合适.
I met a guy this afternoon that I think would be absolutely great for you.

1284
01:05:36,778 --> 01:05:38,712
- 太完美了. - 我?
- Perfect. - For me?

1285
01:05:38,779 --> 01:05:41,714
- 是. 他很年轻, 很强壮, 很健康. - 他做什么呢?
- Yes. He's young, he's strong, he's healthy. - What does he do?

1286
01:05:41,779 --> 01:05:44,714
他-他-他是, 像, 在农业方面搞一些事情.
H-H-He's, you know, like, dicking around in agriculture.

1287
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,714
他的阴茎(和搞同音)有什么问题?
What's wrong with his dick?

1288
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,714
不, 不, 不, 他是个农民. 那个人是个农民.
No, no, no, he's a farmer. The guy's a farmer.

1289
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,715
- 你认识农民? - 对, 一个洋葱农民. 很好.
- You met a farmer? - Yeah, an onion farmer. It's great.

1290
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,715
- 在哪里? - 在体育馆.
- Where? - At the gym.

1291
01:05:53,781 --> 01:05:56,648
一个洋葱农民在体育馆里究竟能做什么?
What the hell is an onion farmer doing at the gym?

1292
01:05:56,715 --> 01:06:00,651
他是--他-结束了-嗯 -拳击手这个生产性的职业.
He's-- He's f-finishing a-a-a very productive career as a boxer.

1293
01:06:00,715 --> 01:06:02,649
拳击手? 哦, Lenny.
A boxer? Oh, Lenny.

1294

But we can fix things. What about Max? Max--

He'll be okay. Maybe it will be better for him with us apart...

我-- 我没办法谈下去.

How could you do this? How could you set me up with this stupid girl?

- 你在说什么? - 你没告诉我她是个妓女...
- What are you talking about? - You didn't tell me she was a hooker...

1563
01:21:15,427 --> 01:21:19,363
还有她演的是色情片 她和几百个男人上过床...
and that she did porno films and had sex with hundreds and hundreds of men...

1564
01:21:19,428 --> 01:21:22,363
还有女人, 妈的谁知道还有什么!

1566
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:26,362
你怎么知道的?
How did you find out?

1567
01:21:26,429 --> 01:21:29,592
我-我给我朋友打电话, 告诉他们 我找到一个女朋友我想结婚.
I-l call my friends up and I tell 'em I got this girl that I wanna marry.

1568
01:21:29,662 --> 01:21:34,190
他们让我过去喝了点酒 我的朋友Ray打开色情录像.
They have me over for a few drinks and my friend Ray puts in this sexy video.

1569
01:21:34,263 --> 01:21:36,697
你知道, 我对色情东西不是很感兴趣.
But I'm not really into pornography, you know.

1570
01:21:36,763 --> 01:21:40,529
- 我看了一眼屏幕, 女演员居然是Judy Cum.
- I look on the screen and this actress is up there: Judy Cum.

1571
01:21:40,597 --> 01:21:44,033
Kevin, 我告诉过你她喜欢演戏.
Kevin, I told you she had dramatic aspirations.

1572
01:21:44,098 --> 01:21:48,034
- 我没办法接受. - 哦, 妈的. 我还以为你很开明呢.
- I flew off the handle. - Oh, Christ. I thought you were a broad-minded guy.

- You hit her? For Christ's-- - A little bit.

1577
01:22:02,034 --> 01:22:05,470
- 上帝. - 我打电话给我妈妈. 我很难过, 她说我应该回家去.
- God. - I called my mother. I was upset, so then she says I should come home.

1578
01:22:05,535 --> 01:22:08,470
- 所以我要离开这该死的鬼地方. - 我不明白你.
- So I'm gonna get the hell outta this place, man. - I don't understand you.

1579
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:11,470
你是个开明的人. 人都会改变.  你就因为她的过去而放弃她?
You're a broad-minded guy. People change. You gonna hold her past against her?

1580
01:22:11,536 --> 01:22:14,471

1581
01:22:14,536 --> 01:22:17,471
- 你在说什么呢? - 算了吧, 伙计. 就这样了.
- What are you talking about? - Forget it, man. It's over.

1582
01:22:17,537 --> 01:22:20,472
从第一天开始我就和你说过 她不是处女.
I told you from day one the girl was not a virgin.

1583
01:22:20,537 --> 01:22:23,472
可是你没有说她有过多少次!
You didn't tell me how many times though!

1584
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,472
- 谢谢你什么都没帮上, Lenny, 伙计. - Kevin!

- 他打了我.

上帝, 很疼吗?

不, 不是很疼. 只是我的溃疡.

溃疡? 哦, 你不应该喝酒.
Your ulcer? Well, you know, you shouldn't be drinking.

1593

- 嗯. - 这糟透了-- 哦, 上帝, 你看你.
- Hmm. - That's the worst-- Oh, God, look at that.

1594

1601
01:23:23,847 --> 01:23:25,781
嗯. 不.
Mmm. No.

1602
01:23:27,147 --> 01:23:29,081


1603

她-- 她在床上很棒吗?

我只知道忽然我很想Amanda.

等等! 看谁来了!

你在这儿! 你去哪里了?

1611
01:24:49,761 --> 01:24:52,195
我一直在到处找你.
I've been looking for you all over.

1612
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:55,957
我只是出去喝了点东西 想想所有这些事.

I, uh-- I was up all night thinking how much I hurt you...

1615
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:04,964
还有我把我们都弄得多糟,
and how much I'd messed us up for good,

1616
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:07,965
还有不能和你在一起.
and the thought of not being with you.

1617
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:11,466
我爱你. 我根本不爱Jerry.
I love you. I don't love Jerry at all.

1618
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:14,966
不管要做什么, 我们应该让一切恢复正常.
We have to put things right, whatever has to be done.

1619
01:25:15,031 --> 01:25:17,465
''当你寂寞的时候''

1620
01:25:17,531 --> 01:25:20,432

1623
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:30,468
- ''当你的爱人离开的时候'' - 至于Linda,

1624
01:25:30,533 --> 01:25:33,127
她到北部的wampsville去 去求Kevin重归于好...
she drove upstate to Wampsville and pleaded with Kevin to take her back...

1625
01:25:33,201 --> 01:25:34,964
可是没有用.
but to no avail.

1626
01:25:35,034 --> 01:25:38,970
在回家的路上她都抓狂了 感觉生命没有希望了...
Anyway, on the way home she was distraught and felt life held no hope...

1627
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:42,630
这时-- 解围的人出现了--
when-- talk about a deus ex machina--

1628
01:25:42,702 --> 01:25:46,035
''像凋谢的花''

我们的退火装置有点问题 那东西有点失去平衡.
So we just had a stabilizing problem and the thing got a little off balance.

1633
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:23,043
然后无线电通信失灵, 所以我要降落找个电话.
And then the radio went glitchy, so I just need to get down and use a phone.

1634
01:26:23,108 --> 01:26:26,100
不管怎么样,  非常谢谢你, 停下来帮我.

1638
01:26:39,211 --> 01:26:42,647
他甚至拿她复杂的背景故事开玩笑.
and even laughed at wild tales of her promiscuous background.

1639
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:45,145
这样我们小小的希腊戏剧就--
And so our little Greek drama comes to--

1640
01:26:45,212 --> 01:26:47,146
等等, 等等. 还有呢.
Wait, wait, wait. There's more.

1641
01:26:47,213 --> 01:26:50,148
还有什么, Tiresias, 失明的底比斯预言家?
 What more, Tiresias, blind seer of Thebes?

1642
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:52,647
告诉他们只要叫我Tiresias, 可以吗?
Tell 'em just to call me Tiresias, will ya?

1643
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:54,613
残疾人总是有怪癖.

Iike he was Zeus and she was Aphrodite with an aphrodisiac.

1646
01:27:01,181 --> 01:27:03,115
说重点!

1647
01:27:03,181 --> 01:27:06,412
- 重点是, Linda在那个晚上就怀孕了. - 不!

但是她不想破坏他和Amanda的生活,  她从来没有告诉他.
But not wanting to complicate his life with Amanda, she never told him.

1650

她和她新丈夫一起离开了,
Instead she went off with her new husband,

1651

在她生下那个漂亮的女婴时 她丈夫始终忠心地对她.

01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:23,951
Lenny再也没有见过Linda.
Lenny never saw Linda again.

1653
01:27:24,018 --> 01:27:26,953

- ''让愉快的笑声赶走我们的烦恼'' - 他们可能在后面.

You're kidding! Where did you go? I searched every place for you.
