1
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,882
Woe unto man.

2
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:25,042
Brave Achilles,
slain in trial by blood...

3
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,042
for prize,
the bride of Menelaus.

4
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,882
And father of Antigone,
ruler of Thebes,

5
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:35,917
self-rendered sightless
by lust for expiation.

6
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:39,334
Lost victim
of bewildered desire.

7
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:42,125
Nor has Jason's wife
fared better.

8
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,500
Giving life only to reclaim it
in vengeful fury.

9
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,000
For to understand
the ways of the heart...

10
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,625
is to grasp as clearly the malice
or ineptitude of the gods,

11
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:56,292
who, in their vain and clumsy labors
to create a flawless surrogate,

12
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:59,417
have left mankind
but dazed and incomplete.

13
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Take, for instance,
the case of Lenny Weinrib,

14
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:07,084
a tale as Greek and timeless
as fate itself.

15
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:09,548
- Lenny, let's have a baby.
- Hey!

16
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,125
A baby? Why? Because she's pregnant,
you want to have a baby?

17
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,667
- No. It's a great idea.
- You could raise your own middleweight.

18
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,667
- I don't want a middleweight.
- Flyweight.

19
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:20,084
- No, it'd be fun.
- Have you ever had children?

20
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:22,875
- No, I've never had children.
- Why not?

21
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,792
What do you mean, "why not?" 'Cause my
first wife didn't want to have a child.

22
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,084
- Then I never remarried really, so-
- Oh, that's great.

23
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:30,084
- What am I, chopped liver?
- Until now.

24
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,084
- Yeah?
- I never- You didn't let me finish.

25
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,167
- No, you'd forgotten.
- Now you've changed your mind. You didn't want to have a child.

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,875
- You should have kids.
- It's like stereo. Give him a break.

27
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,215
- You don't want a kid?
- Oh, we-

28
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,924
When we first met, she didn't like
the beach; she hated the Hamptons;

29
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,334
she didn't want to have kids; she loved the
Upper East Side, she didn't want to move.

30
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,334
Now suddenly she's making noise about
having a kid and moving to Tribeca.

31
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,750
- Only if the gallery moves downtown.
- Well, being pregnant is great.

32
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,833
- Yeah?
- I love it. You get treated like the Queen of England.

33
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,833
- Sure.
- You say that like it's a good thing.

34
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,833
- Well, I like the pampering.
- She does like it.

35
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,833
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

36
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,882
I can't give up the time
right now.

37
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,125
There are too many exciting things
happening in my business.

38
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:09,125
- So let me ask you a question.
- What?

39
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,541
How do you plan to swing it without
being pregnant? I'm curious.

40
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,541
- Good question. Very good question.
- No, it's easy.

41
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,625
- We'll adopt. Oh, well.
- Mmm.

42
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,625
- Not me. I don't want to adopt.
- There you go.

43
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,625
- Why not? That's a good idea.
- No. No.

44
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,209
- You must be nuts. With, with my genes?
- Yeah?

45
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,625
- To adopt? I have award-winning genes.
- Oh, God.

46
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,209
- I want to pass them on.
- No, that's crazy. No, the-

47
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:31,125
It's for the same reason
we don't lease a car, okay?

48
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,125
- 'Cause it's pride of ownership.
- Okay.

49
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,209
- And I don't want to adopt a child.
- No. Look, I'm sorry, Lenny.

50
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:38,084
It's crazy 'cause the world
is full of needy kids.

51
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,084
- You know, she's right.
- That's true.

52
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,084
- I know, but that- You know, but I-
- No, I mean it.

53
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:45,792
Why overpopulate the world when there
are thousands of parent-less kids?

54
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,083
Just because you don't want
to get morning sickness, right?

55
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,292
- No, it's not true.
- That's why you want to adopt a kid.

56
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,500
I just can't afford
to give up a year just now.

57
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,167
Forget it. Subject is closed.
I don't wanna-

58
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,667
I'd be afraid that
I might get a bad seed.

59
00:04:57,702 --> 00:04:59,632
- Oh, you're paranoid.
- Oh, come on.

60
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,667
That's right! What- You read that
in the tabloids all the time.

61
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,667
- No. A bad seed.
- That's right.

62
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:07,167
Yeah, we adopt some sweet little boy,
and then he turns 13,

63
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:09,875
we'd go to sleep at night,
he'd split our head open with an axe.

64
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,563
Listen, why'd you have to go and tell him
that? You know Lenny's got a vivid imagination.

65
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,167
- It's a common occurrence.
- I read the same paper. What do you want me to tell you?

66
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:18,507
Anyway, what do you mean "he"?
Why can't we adopt a girl?

67
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,667
- We're not adopting anything. I want no sex.
- A little girl.

68
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,146
Let the guy have a short stop
or a point guard, will ya?

69
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:25,542
Can we get a check? Can we-
Can we please get out of here?

70
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,750
I'll take the check.
I'm paying tonight.

71
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,834
- Yes.
- You? I'm stunned.

72
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,042
You pay, you break your record. You- One more
and you break DiMaggio's record- 56 straight.

73
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,042
That's not true.
Now, be nice.

74
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,125
Laius, proud father, speak.

75
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:42,542
I, with joy,
did have a son...

76
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,542
so fair, so clearheaded
and brave,

77
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,209
that I a thousand pleasures
did derive from his presence.

78
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:51,209
So what happens?

79
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,382
One day he kills me.

80
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:56,334
And don't you think,
he runs off and marries my wife.

81
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,334
Poor Oedipus, king of Thebes.

82
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,917
My son, my son
did slay unwittingly...

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,917
my noble husband...

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,792
and did, without realizing,
hasten with me,

85
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,792
his loving mother,
to lustful bed.

86
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,126
And a whole profession
was born...

87
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,500
charging sometimes
200 an hour,

88
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,708
and a 50-minute hour
at that.

89
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,209
And why a child now, out of left field?

90
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,292
One hopes it's not to fill
some growing void in their marriage.

91
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,292
Leave her be.

92
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:29,084
A woman's urge to motherhood
is old as the earth.

93
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:31,792
Children grow up;
they move out.

94
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,875
Sometimes to ridiculous places
like Cincinnati...

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,875
or Boise, Idaho.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,875
Then you never see them again.

97
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,563
You'd think once in a while
they'd pick up a phone.

98
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:44,167
But is there a growing void
in the Weinrib's marriage?

99
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:46,132
We didn't say there was.

100
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:49,084
We're all just speculating
on possible motives.

101
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,132
Children are serious stuff.

102
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:54,959
Look, here's a man
who killed his father...

103
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,959
and slept with his mother.

104
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,459
I hate to tell you what they
call my son in Harlem.

105
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,542
Hello.

106
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,167
- There's a baby we can adopt.
- Are you serious?

107
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:11,459
I spoke to Carolyn Hester
and she's found an infant for us.

108
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,959
- But we have to act quickly.
- I don't want a kid.

109
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:17,007
Well, Lenny, you know
how hard it is.

110
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,750
And look, the baby's
one day old, totally healthy.

111
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,882
Unwed mother, no diseases.

112
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,042
And it's a boy.
You wanted a boy.

113
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,542
Amanda, I can't get
into this with you now.

114
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,882
This is not the place
to have this discussion.

115
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,021
I told Carolyn to be on the lookout.
She's experienced with adoptions.

116
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:35,126
She knows what she's doing.
It's a boy, healthy, born this morning.

117
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:37,500
No strings,
if we act quickly.

118
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,674
Le- Look, I- I gotta
put my foot down.

119
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,334
I- I- If you want to
discuss this another time, we can.

120
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:48,000
But if you gotta have a fast answer,
it's definitely "no. "

121
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,965
- Hi! Hi.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,126
- You got his head?
- He's adorable.

123
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,418
- Yes. Oh, God.

124
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,792
This is great. This kid is never
going to be a fighter, you know.

125
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:01,875
I gotta run out and get some weights
because he's really light as a feather.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,257
- Yeah, perhaps I should have him back.
- Hi.

127
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,376
Yeah. Maybe you better
hold him 'cause he's crying.

128
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,376
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's crying.

129
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,792
- Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

130
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,792
- That's a good boy.
- That's so great.

131
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,375
If there's any greatness in my hands,
let it pass into your body.

132
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,875
- Get a grip on yourself.
- This kid is gonna be a great kid!

133
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,875
- Oh, yeah.
- He's fabulous!

134
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,875
- You're okay now.
- What do you wanna call him?

135
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,875
- Oh, this is unbelievable. Yeah.
- Call him?

136
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,084
- Oh, wh- what about Eric?
- Eric? The kid's not a Viking.

137
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,959
I wanna call him, name him,
you know, for one of my heroes.

138
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:35,167
- Like what?
- I don't know. What about Groucho?

139
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,042
- Groucho? Oh, get real.
- No, I'm serious.

140
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,750
It's a great- You know.
I- I don't know. What-

141
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,251
What about Phineas?
Do you like Phineas?

142
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,251
Phineas?
Are you joking?

143
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,834
Phineas is the guy who
forecloses on the mortgage.

144
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,715
I don't want to call this kid
Phineas. He's adorable.

145
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,834
- That's so great. What-
What, uh- Let me think. - Well.

146
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,834
- What about Django?
- Django?

147
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,459
Django, yeah. After Django Reinhardt,
the great guitar player.

148
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:02,251
- Django Weinrib?
- That's the curse of the Weinrib name.

149
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,542
- It doesn't go with anything. Nothing goes with Weinrib.
- Well, okay, okay.

150
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,126
What about something simple
like, you know, Ben?

151
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,334
- You want to call him Ben Weinrib?
- Yeah.

152
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:11,709
What, he's gonna be
a- a-a gin rummy champion?

153
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:14,334
- I mean, you know.
- Yeah, well, you want to deny your heritage? Huh?

154
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:16,917
Well, you know, I-I just want
the kid to have a great name.

155
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,500
- Yeah.
- What about Sugar Ray Weinrib?

156
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,465
Holden,
after Holden Caulfield.

157
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,834
You see, Holden is one of those things
that works if we use your maiden name.

158
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:28,418
- If it's Holden Sloane, but not Holden Weinrib.
- Yeah.

159
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,709
The kid is so cute!

160
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,438
I can't believe he's-
What about Cole?

161
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,084
- Cole?
- Cole Weinrib. Harpo Weinrib.

162
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,709
- Harpo? No.
- How about Earl the Pearl Weinrib?

163
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,418
- That would be so perfect.
- Oh, God! No.

164
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,293
- Okay, what- what about Shane?
You like the name Shane? - Yeah.

165
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,293
- Shane's pretty.
- Shane would be okay.

166
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:50,500
On the other hand, you wouldn't want
a Supreme Court Justice called Shane.

167
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,914
Oh, Jesus.
I got it. I got it.

168
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:55,258
Brilliant.
This is so brilliant.

169
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:58,042
- Got it? Ready? Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:00,792
- Thelonius Weinrib.
- Max! What about Max?

171
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,840
- Max?
- Yeah, Max.

172
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,084
Max.
Oh, look how cute he is.

173
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,459
- I wanna hold him. Max is okay.
- He's so sweet. He's smiling.

174
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,959
- Dr. Max Weinrib. I like the name Max.
- Yeah, Max is good.

175
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:13,251
- It's simple.
- How about Senator Max Weinrib?

176
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:16,376
- Little tongue.
- Rabbi Max- Rabbi Max Weinrib?

177
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,959
No. Maybe we should
rethink Max for a minute.

178
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:22,376
- Oh, he's so great.
- He's happy. I think he likes us.

179
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,959
- He looks like you.
- He looks like me?

180
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,424
Yeah.

181
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,334
He looks like Broderick
Crawford a little bit.

182
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,917
- He's so smart.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,126
He picks up on everything.

184
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,917
He's got a great personality. You know, you
wake him up, he's always smiling and upbeat.

185
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:06,185
- Like me.
- You were like that when you were a baby.

186
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,418
- Yeah, he's so verbal.
- Well, he's around a writer...

187
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
and an art expert, right?

188
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,091
Listen, when are you going
to move the gallery downtown?

189
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:16,084
Yeah, Mother, we don't want to get
into that discussion 'cause, you know,

190
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,293
I think we should move and Lenny
is a devoted Upper East-sider.

191
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:23,376
Or shall I say is opposed
to change in any form?

192
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
- I don't know.
- It's unbelievable.

193
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,084
The kid is unbelievable. I got him
trains, he put 'em together himself.

194
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,168
Trains? I thought you
bought him an Erector Set.

195
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:34,834
I got him an Erector Set, yeah.
And- And I also got him this tricycle.

196
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:37,376
- Wait. And the whole plastic kitchen?
- Max, I got you a tricycle.

197
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:39,341
Lenny, you can't
buy him so much.

198
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:41,584
- Max, I got you a tricycle.
- Look at that!

199
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,584
- You can't buy him so much stuff.

200
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,841
- No, no. I also got him skates.
- Skates?

201
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:50,584
Yeah. And I got a couple more things
on the way in, you know.

202
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,876
A small truck is gonna pull up
in front of the house.

203
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,667
- What are you gonna get next year?
- Does anyone want anything to drink?

204
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,750
- Go ahead. Shoot.

205
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,715
Try again.

206
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,667
You ever think about what you want
to be when you grow up, Max?

207
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,251
Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe an interior decorator.

208
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:09,542
- What?
- Just kidding, just kidding.

209
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:12,042
Well, don't kid.
Here. Come on.

210
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:23,334
Okay, those go in the bedroom.
Okay, you follow me.

211
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:25,834
- Give me a hand with this.
- Why did we move?

212
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,174
What do you mean,
"Why did we move?" I told you.

213
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,834
We moved 'cause- 'cause, you know,
'cause your mother wanted to move.

214
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:35,334
'Cause, you know, the art gallery
she works at has moved downtown...

215
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:37,590
and, you know,
she wanted to move.

216
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,001
- Here's your football.
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy?

217
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,126
- What is the question?
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy?

218
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,091
Who is the boss?
You have to ask that?

219
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:47,293
- You don't know who the boss is between me and Mommy?
- No.

220
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm the boss, okay? Mommy-
Mommy's only the decision maker.

221
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,500
You know, there's a difference
between, uh-

222
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:58,584
You know, Mommy- Mommy says
what we do and, and, uh,

223
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,792
I have control
of the channel changer.

224
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:04,293
- Here- Here's your crayons.
- Thanks.

225
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:07,584
We're new in the neighborhood and we
want Max to be really in the best school.

226
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,293
- Oh, but this is it.
- It's 'cause he's a very, very bright kid.

227
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,293
- I mean, really bright.
- Yeah, he's really great.

228
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,792
Yes, I know. I saw his test scores
and they're wonderful.

229
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:17,133
- They are. Yeah.
- I know. And he's got a great sense of humor.

230
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:20,584
- He's a sweet kid. He's a really sweet kid.
- He's got a great personality.

231
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,876
Wonderful. Well, I wanted to talk
to you about a special program...

232
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,876
that we have
for bright students.

233
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,876
- Really? And he qualifies?

234
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,959
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

235
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,251
- Certainly.
- Because- when you hear his syntax,

236
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,341
- Hello? Oh, hi.
- it's amazing.

237
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,667
- Verbal skills are telling. - His
vocabulary is good, but his syntax is-

238
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:38,726
- Oh, great.
- He speaks like a grown-up.

239
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,751
- Sorry. Lenny?
- What we can do is-

240
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,043
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Oh, certainly.

241
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:46,667
Can we meet the Dorians tonight
for dinner at Le Cirque?

242
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:50,188
The Dorians? No. Because we have
tickets to the Edward Albee play.

243
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:53,625
- Listen, I can't.
- We have to. We've been waiting for so long.

244
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,335
You don't have to go,
but I really should go.

245
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,542
I, uh- No.

246
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,542
- This will be the second time this week we cancelled something.
- Go with Bud.

247
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:04,126
- Oh, okay.
- I don't want to go with Bud. I'm not married to Bud.

248
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,251
Listen, go.
Can we not discuss it now?

249
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,834
Oh, my God!
That was embarrassing.

250
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:12,917
Well, just because I don't want to have dinner
yet again with the world's dullest couple.

251
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:15,209
Yeah, well, someday they may
sponsor me for my own gallery.

252
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:17,209
- I said I'd go. I'm going with you.
- Yeah?

253
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,209
But we got tickets to a show.
It's a shame.

254
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:22,001
This time try and join in and don't
sit there like some zombie all night.

255
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,383
Hey, last time I joined in,
you got angry with me.

256
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:27,709
Yeah, 'cause we were discussing
the I.M. Pei Museum, not Muhammad Ali.

257
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:31,126
Well, my mind wandered.
I can't keep on those topics.

258
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,001
I just don't want to be the motor power
of the Bender Gallery forever.

259
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,001
I want the
Amanda Sloane Gallery.

260
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,084
Not Amanda Weinrib,
'cause there's a euphony problem.

261
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:43,459
Three, four, run.
Three, four, and break the ball.

262
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:46,709
- Play 88!
- I hope they don't play like this.

263
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,876
- 88! Ten-hut!

264
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,876
What's the matter?
You seem down.

265
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:53,500
- No, I'm fine.
- You're fine?

266
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,500
Something's on your mind,
Lenny.

267
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:59,876
Listen, last night I was
at one of those dinner parties again.

268
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,293
Amanda- You know,
last week she took me to,

269
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,293
to Le Cirque with the Dorians.

270
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:08,251
And then last night it was
with the Grossbards on Park Avenue.

271
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:11,959
And then after that,
we were driving home...

272
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:13,959
and I don't know
what to say.

273
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:18,168
It was Saturday night, you know, and we
stopped for a light over on Park Avenue.

274
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:21,876
I looked out the window
and I see some guy and this pretty girl.

275
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,751
And, you know,
they're walking home and, you know,

276
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:26,959
the guy's carrying
the Sunday papers.

277
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:30,460
It looked like they were
having so much fun, you know.

278
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,959
And, you know-
I don't know, I-

279
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:36,251
I remember how great it
used to be with me and Amanda...

280
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,799
in our first apartment,
you know, how romantic it was.

281
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:42,251
You know, in those days it was
just a kick shopping together...

282
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,251
or, you know, just walking
the New York streets, you know.

283
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:49,209
Then when Max came,
everything was so great, you know.

284
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,418
We had such terrific times.

285
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:56,043
I don't know, it's been so long since there's
been, you know, the old passion between us.

286
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,418
I don't know, but it was the first time
I had any of those thoughts.

287
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,126
And, you know,
they made me feel nervous.

288
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,500
You weren't too pleasant
this evening.

289
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:10,918
Why, 'cause I said no about going
to your boss Jerry Bender's house...

290
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,918
- in the Hamptons?
- I'll be fine.

291
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,084
I don't like the Hamptons. You know,
you used to hate the beach yourself.

292
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,210
Yeah, not the way he lives.
It's private and beautiful.

293
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,584
What are you getting
so angry about?

294
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:21,792
- 'Cause you won't come.
- Last time we went, I got a tick.

295
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:24,876
- A tick? Oh, wow. Big deal.
- For you, it wasn't a big deal.

296
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:27,792
- But I took my pants off, I had a black thing living in my leg.
- Everyone will be there.

297
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:29,876
For the potential contacts,
I can put up with a few ticks.

298
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,876
I don't- What contacts?

299
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:34,001
You know, it's like you're
an international spy.

300
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:36,876
- You got contacts all over town.
- I plan to have my own gallery, and soon.

301
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,584
You've changed unbelievably
over the years.

302
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,584
- Oh, yeah? You know what, Lenny?
- You used to hate that.

303
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,876
- People grow. They grow. Some people.
- It's not growth.

304
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,460
You used to hate the beach.
And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you.

305
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:47,924
What?

306
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,959
- This guy stares at you.
- Oh, no. That's nuts.

307
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,959
- That's seriously crazy.
- He mentally undresses you.

308
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:53,959
- That's his normal look.
- It's not his normal look.

309
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:56,460
- If he looked at me that way I'd hit
him with a brick. - Okay. Okay, let's-

310
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,168
- Or kiss him on the lips, maybe.
- Let's drop this. Please?

311
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,959
Well, what do you mean,
you couldn't find it?

312
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,751
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, it's dark in here...

313
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,126
and I- you know,
we haven't done it in a while.

314
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:16,542
- And then you got so angry at me.
- I wasn't angry.

315
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:19,542
I wasn't angry. You were fumbling
and I was getting out of the mood.

316
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:23,043
Sorry, I couldn't find it. This-
We haven't been doing it in a while.

317
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,251
- Okay, let's not get into a whole discussion here.
- I lost my sense of direction.

318
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,210
I'm tired.

319
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,542
Every marriage goes through
valleys and peaks.

320
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:33,043
- This is like a valley.
- I don't mind going through a valley.

321
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:36,709
- But I don't want to sink beneath sea level here.
- Lenny, why rock the boat?

322
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:40,001
You got a bright, beautiful wife.
You got a kid that you're crazy for.

323
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,001
I'm not gonna rock the boat.
Did I tell you about Max?

324
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:44,793
They want to put him in a special class
because he's got a high IQ.

325
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:47,001
Yeah, well, two bright parents.
I mean, what do you expect?

326
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:49,293
Yeah, whoever they are.
I mean, I still don't know.

327
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,459
It's like raising thoroughbreds.

328
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:53,501
This kid must come
from good stock.

329
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:56,709
He's good-looking; he's got a high IQ;
he's got a great personality.

330
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:58,418
And he's amusing.

331
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,709
This is not my doing.
Amanda did the whole adoption.

332
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,876
I just resisted.
I complained, like a jerk.

333
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:07,001
I mean, a good father, a dynamite mother
produces a kid like Max.

334
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:09,501
I think the father's dead,
you know.

335
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:14,793
- The mother?

336
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,425
Don't go any further!

337
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,584
I know what you're thinking,
Lenny, and forget it.

338
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,460
How can I forget it?
The thought's been put into my head.

339
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:27,584
Oh, cursed fate. Certain thoughts
are better left unthunk.

340
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,168
I'll bet this kid
has a dynamite mother.

341
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:32,959
What makes you think he didn't
inherit everything from his father?

342
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:35,667
Everything? That's very unlikely.
But I'm gonna find out.

343
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:37,959
Let sleeping dogs lie.

344
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:41,632
- I'll bet she's great.
- Curiosity. That's what kills us.

345
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,168
Not muggers or all that bullshit about the
ozone layer. It's our own hearts and minds.

346
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:49,632
- I'm gonna find out.
- Please, Lenny, don't be a schmuck.

347
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:54,834
I remember the adoption vaguely because
I'm somewhat friendly with Amanda.

348
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,251
But it was not that long ago
that we- that we did it.

349
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,335
I recall trying to
expedite matters for her.

350
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:05,043
I somehow think it was
a single parent with no father.

351
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:08,626
Right. Exactly. So-So how-
Is it possible for me to get the name-

352
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,626
I'd like the name
of the mother, if I could.

353
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,626
That remains forever
in our files.

354
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:16,709
Even if I have it, I can't give it
to you. May I ask why you want to know?

355
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:18,674
Yes, 'cause I-I-
I'm curious about it...

356
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:21,210
and I'm trying to get
all the information that I can.

357
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:24,709
- So, so- - I'm sorry. That's
all I can help you with.

358
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:27,001
There's no possibility
of, uh-

359
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:29,918
- No, those are the rules.
- I don't understand. I'm the father of the child.

360
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:33,793
- I can't find out who-
- They're very firm. It's never done.

361
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:36,501
- Mm-hmm.
- How is the little boy doing?

362
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,918
- Good. He's great. He's fabulous.
- Yes?

363
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:42,001
- Yes.
- Say hello to Amanda.

364
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:45,501
- There's no possibility that I could-
- I'm sorry.

365
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,793
- There's-
- Really sorry. No way.

366
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:51,876
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

367
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,175
What are you doing, Weinrib?

368
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,834
Don't confuse me!
She's coming back in a minute.

369
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:04,210
- You are breaking the law.
- Breaking the law? There's a higher law.

370
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,918
I can find out
who my son's mother is.

371
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:09,001
The judge won't see it
that way.

372
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:11,466
Keep a lookout for me,
will you, for Christ's sake?

373
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,584
- Me? I'm the leader of the Chorus.
- So what? Look out.

374
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,584
Get your friend Bud
to help you.

375
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,210
Bud can't help me. You know,
Ellie and Amanda are friendly.

376
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:22,293
- Bud can't keep a secret.
- Why is it a secret? Why can't Amanda know?

377
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:24,501
What kind of argument am I
getting into with you? Amanda-

378
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,501
'Cause she wouldn't understand.

379
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:28,709
Oh, you're guilty because you
already have exaggerated notions...

380
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:30,633
about your son's mother.

381
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:34,085
It's understandable because things
are not going smoothly with Amanda.

382
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,793
That's why you will always
be a chorus member.

383
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,126
Because you don't do anything.
I act.

384
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,377
I take action.
I make things happen.

385
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,876
Well, hurry the hell up.
I hear footsteps.

386
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:51,584
I- I forgot my- I dropped
my manila envelope. I didn't realize it.

387
00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:54,168
- Oh.
- It has an important interview in it.

388
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:56,168
With- With Roberto Duran.

389
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:02,668
You won't believe this,
but he's heading for Pennsylvania.

390
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,751
Of all the human weaknesses,

391
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:08,751
- obsession is the most dangerous.
- And the silliest.

392
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:13,460
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for a former tenant here,

393
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:15,925
- a-a-a Leslie Wright.
- Who are you?

394
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,126
I'm a friend of hers, and I believe
she lived here at one time-

395
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,126
a Leslie Wright?

396
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:22,543
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember
the girl who used to live here.

397
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,543
- You remember. The pretty one upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

398
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:27,008
She was only here for a while.
Who are you?

399
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,626
Uh, I'm just an old friend of hers
and I was trying to track her down.

400
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,709
Do you know- Do you know
where I could find her?

401
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:34,709
Leslie Wailes was her name,
not Leslie Wright. Leslie Wailes.

402
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:36,709
- Leslie Wailes?
- Wailes.

403
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:39,210
- She moved to New York.
- You sure? 'Cause I have Leslie Wright.

404
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:41,835
Leslie- Leslie-
Did she get married or-

405
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:43,918
I don't know.

406
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:47,001
You have no other information? You don't
know where I could find her or anything?

407
00:22:47,036 --> 00:22:49,501
No. She was only here
for a little while. I told you.

408
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,883
Look, let me give you
my phone number.

409
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:54,918
If anything turns up,
I would love to locate her.

410
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:01,709
- Here. Give me that. I'll take that.
- Thank you.

411
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:04,293
- Yeah. Okay.
- You're welcome.

412
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:09,377
You have a phone call. Mr. Lamont.
Says he's from Philadelphia.

413
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:11,790
- Oh.
- You gave him your number?

414
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,168
- Mm-hmm.
- Is this Lenny Weinrib?

415
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,168
- Go ahead, sir.
- Hello.

416
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:19,584
Yeah, this is Bill Lamont.
Um, that woman you were looking for-

417
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:23,258
We asked another guy who said
her name was Leslie St. James.

418
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:26,460
Said she moved to New York City,
talked about becoming an actress.

419
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,960
- Leslie St. James?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

420
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:33,841
He remembered her quite well.
Leslie St. James is the name she took.

421
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:39,377
There was a Leslie St. James who was
a member of the Screen Extras Guild.

422
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,543
- So that's that.
- So what are you telling me?

423
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:45,460
That- That she was a movie
extra or stage extra?

424
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:47,633
Yeah.
That's all I have.

425
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:49,751
So- And there's an address,
but, uh, you know,

426
00:23:49,835 --> 00:23:53,252
this book's
a few years old. So.

427
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:55,508
I'm looking for a-
it's- she-

428
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:58,335
A Leslie St. James
or maybe it's a Leslie Wailes.

429
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,835
- I don't know, but I think she lived here.
- Oh, yeah, sure. I remember.

430
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:04,335
She was a tall girl.
She changed her name to Linda Ash.

431
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:05,835
Linda Ash?

432
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:08,419
Yeah, it was a fake name.
She- She did sex movies.

433
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:11,043
- Sex movies?
- Yeah, you know, like, uh, Deep Throat.

434
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:14,419
Skin flicks.
Tall, blonde, hot.

435
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:16,419
- Very hot.
- Really? Good-looking?

436
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,918
Oh, great looking.
Tremendous body.

437
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,419
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Lenny, how are ya?

438
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,127
- Good. Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

439
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,675
- I need a favor.
- You got it. What?

440
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,210
You got friends in the, uh,
the adult film business, right?

441
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:33,258
My nephew knows them all.
Why?

442
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:38,085
I'm trying to locate
an actress named Linda Ash.

443
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,793
- You know which movies she did?
- No.

444
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:42,876
I was in the video store
trying to get a video,

445
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:45,085
but, you know, I get embarrassed
because my neighbor saw me there.

446
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,466
- And, you know-
- I hear ya.

447
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:49,584
- Well, let me get back to you on that one. All right?
- Yeah.

448
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:55,050
You know, I don't know
why we have to do this.

449
00:24:55,085 --> 00:24:57,085
I- I don't want to spend
the whole weekend at Jerry Bender's.

450
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:59,085
Oh, Lenny, please.
We've been through this.

451
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:01,793
There are lots
of important clients there.

452
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,793
I- You know,
so what is this?

453
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:07,168
Meanwhile this guy's going to stare at you
the whole weekend and mentally undress you.

454
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,168
He is not. He's not.

455
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:12,751
God, your paranoia is rivaled
in history only by Joseph Stalin.

456
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:29,543
I'm really glad you
could make it out this weekend, Amanda.

457
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:32,127
There's some people around here I think
it's very important you should meet.

458
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:35,144
Oh, thanks, Jerry.
I really appreciate it. I really do.

459
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:38,127
- God, I love your sailboat.
- Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?

460
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,043
- Yeah.
- Sorry the waves were so choppy, Lenny.

461
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:44,543
Oh, it's no problem. I don't mind
throwing up into the wind, you know.

462
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,043
You know, we could see
that house next door at 3:00.

463
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:49,043
By the way, it's a great buy.

464
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:51,210
Is it possible that I could
just make one quick phone call?

465
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:53,210
- Yeah. Ken!
- Yes, Jerry.

466
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,543
Oh, sorry, Ken.
Can you show Lenny the private phone?

467
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:57,710
Sure. Come on, Lenny.
It's right over here.

468
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:00,591
The house sounds exciting.
What are they asking again?

469
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:05,002
Amanda, listen. Why don't you,
uh, spend the night here tonight.

470
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:07,501
- What do you say? Are
you free tonight? - Uh-

471
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:09,466
We could go for a sail.

472
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,501
You can't believe what the stars
look like lying on the back of a boat.

473
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:15,501
- Yeah. No, I'd love to. I really would love to.
- Well, then, do it.

474
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:18,419
But I- No, he
has to get back.

475
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:21,085
Really?

476
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,002
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

477
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:26,002
Hmm.

478
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:31,377
I got the skinny
on Linda Ash.

479
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:35,002
She's been in a few films.
She's no star or nothin'.

480
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:37,294
That's why you
never heard of her.

481
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:40,793
She works under
the stage name "Judy Cum. "

482
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:43,168
Mostly, she's a hooker.

483
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:45,377
Uh, I got her number.

484
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:50,168
Judy Cum?

485
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:52,168
Oh, you never should
have looked for her.

486
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:54,377
Now I see big trouble.

487
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,877
Oh, for God's sake.
You know, you're such a Cassandra.

488
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,751
I'm not such a Cassandra.
I am Cassandra.

489
00:27:00,877 --> 00:27:03,335
- That's who I am.
- I gotta check this thing out.

490
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,460
You'll be sorry.
I'm telling you, quit now.

491
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,043
Oh, and don't let Amanda talk you
into buying the house next door.

492
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:13,543
- This place?
- Yes! I see big problems with beach erosion...

493
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:15,543
and a heavy mortgage.

494
00:27:17,543 --> 00:27:20,751
Well, I love that property.

495
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:23,419
- Mm-hmm.
- We're right near everybody.

496
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:26,751
Doesn't mean we have to see them
all the time, but we have the option.

497
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:29,127
You- You're not afraid
of beach erosion, right?

498
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,918
Beach erosion? Oh, come on, now.
You're such a Cassandra.

499
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,918
You gonna take a shower?

500
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:37,501
Yeah. Yeah, can you, uh,
fix something for dinner?

501
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,501
Yeah, I'll make dinner.

502
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,710
I'll make the spaghetti, okay?

503
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:44,002
There's some sauce
in the fridge.

504
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:16,002
Hello, is this Linda?

505
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:19,342
Linda, um, this is Lenny.

506
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:22,877
Uh, I- I got your number
from Charlie Biggs.

507
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,342
And I wonder if, uh,
it would be possible...

508
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:29,377
that you would have some time
tomorrow afternoon.

509
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:31,960
- You shouldn't do this.
- Would you please stop it?

510
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,925
- You're gonna cheat on Amanda?
- I'm not cheating.

511
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
- I just want to see what she looks like.
- You can get a disease.

512
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:39,751
- Aren't you scared of AIDS?
- I'm not gonna sleep with the girl.

513
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:41,751
I just want to see
what she looks like.

514
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:44,772
I want to get to know her
or something. It's just-

515
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,668
Uh, is it possible that we
could meet at a hotel?

516
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:50,461
You're gonna rent a hotel room
with a hooker and not sleep with her?

517
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:52,543
Leave me alone.
I want to talk to her.

518
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:55,043
How about the Plaza
on 59th Street? Is that-

519
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:59,043
What are you doing?
At least pick an out-of-the-way spot.

520
00:28:59,127 --> 00:29:01,043
Oh, Christ.

521
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:03,835
Um, Linda, maybe
it'd be better if I-

522
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:06,918
What about your place?
Would that be a possibility?

523
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,883
- Uh-huh. Uh-

524
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:11,918
Hold on one second.

525
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,210
3:00.

526
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:22,918
Okay.
Um, I'll be there.

527
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:24,918
And it's Lenny.

528
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:32,127
Uh, Lenny... Gildersleeve.
Okay.

529
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,585
I can't believe this.
I can't believe it.

530
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:58,085
Hi. Are you my 3:00?

531
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,085
- Linda Ash?
- Yeah, that's right.

532
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:09,960
- I'm Lenny.
- Hello, Lenny. Come on in.

533
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:13,085
- Uh, you're- you're Linda Ash, right?
- Yeah.

534
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,169
- 'Cause we spoke on the phone?
- Yeah.

535
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:17,543
Are you okay?
You look all white.

536
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:19,752
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

537
00:30:19,877 --> 00:30:22,752
- Do you want something to drink?

538
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:25,252
- Maybe- Do you have a little
Perrier or something? - What?

539
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:28,668
- Little- Just a little tap water?
- Oh, sure. I have that.

540
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:31,591
- You're definitely Linda Ash?
- Yeah.

541
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:34,252
What's the matter?
Are you a stroke victim or something?

542
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:36,626
I told you three times.
I'm Linda Ash.

543
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:38,626
Oh.

544
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,752
Oh, you have a,
a beautiful apartment.

545
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:47,419
- Oh, thank you. I did it myself.
- Oh.

546
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:50,918
Oh, let me show you
something I just got.

547
00:30:50,953 --> 00:30:53,040
- That. Isn't it a pisser?
- Ohh!

548
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:55,092
Oh, yes, it's-
it's magnificent.

549
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:57,501
Oh. Well, yeah.
I got a great sense of humor.

550
00:30:57,626 --> 00:31:00,835
That's something you're going to find out about me
- I'm funny and I can take a joke.

551
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,627
- A lot of people can't take a joke.
- Oh, no, I can.

552
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,627
- They say that about me too.
- Oh, yeah?

553
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,627
- That I have a good sense of humor.
- Oh, good!

554
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,501
Then you'll like this. Look,
I just got this. Somebody gave it to me.

555
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:14,501
As the main spring goes back and forth,
the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass.

556
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:17,918
- It's a genuine antique and it keeps perfect time.
- Oh, my goodness.

557
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,419
It's a disgusting-
Ohh.

558
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:22,377
- Lenny?

559
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:25,793
The water today is a little bit brown.
Would you like some Sprite instead?

560
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:28,294
- I'm feeling a little dizzy. I-
- Oh, no!

561
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:30,377
- Come sit down.
- No, no. I don't know why.

562
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:33,293
Usually, you know,
I'm just the picture of health.

563
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:36,050
- Yeah? You work out?
- Not- Not religiously.

564
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,461
Oh, I'm not religious either.
Mostly, my folks were Episcopalian.

565
00:31:39,585 --> 00:31:41,842
- Oh, are they? So-
- So.

566
00:31:41,877 --> 00:31:45,050
So what do you do, Lenny?
Oh, no. Wait. Let me guess.

567
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:47,668
I have a great knack for guessing
what people do for a living.

568
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,377
- Um-
- Um, uh- I'll tell you the truth.

569
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:52,461
- Rug salesman!
- You're close.

570
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,877
I'm- I'm a sportswriter.
Because-

571
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,877
- Shit. I wasn't even in the ballpark.
- Well, it was not-

572
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,877
Wait. Ballpark. Sportswriter.
Get it?

573
00:31:59,912 --> 00:32:02,169
- I get it.

574
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:05,301
I did it with a wrestler once.
A huge, hairy guy.

575
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:08,668
You'd figure he'd be hung like a horse,
but there was very little there.

576
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:10,960
Look, could I- could I
just get a little water?

577
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:13,127
- I don't care if it's brown.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

578
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:16,044
I don't mind rust.
I'm just feeling a little-

579
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:19,127
T- Tell me, Linda.

580
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:21,884
Uh, uh, tell me
about yourself, Linda.

581
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,419
Well, what do you-
what do you want to know?

582
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:27,127
Anything.
I just want to know about you.

583
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,092
- Well, basically, Lenny,
- Yes?

584
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:32,627
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

585
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,710
I like drama. I study.

586
00:32:34,835 --> 00:32:36,710
Yes? Uh, where-
where's that?

587
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:39,336
Paul Delucca.
Have you ever heard of him?

588
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,627
- Paul Delucca? No. But then, I wouldn't.
- Yeah.

589
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,002
- Oh, he's really well-known. He's
a genius. - I'm sure. I'm sure.

590
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:48,211
He says he thinks I'm gonna
make it big.

591
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:50,211
- Mmm.
- Um, I know you will.

592
00:32:50,294 --> 00:32:53,501
- Yeah. Maybe you've seen some of my movies.
- That's possible.

593
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:56,085
Did you ever see
The Enchanted Pussy?

594
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:58,919
Not yet, but I-I-
It's on my list of must-see.

595
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:00,877
Oh, they're videotapes,
so you can rent it.

596
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,793
But my real ambition is
to be on Broadway in a musical.

597
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,793
- I sing.
- Do you?

598
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,793
- Excuse me.

599
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:16,085
Hello? Busy. Some of them
are called John, all right?

600
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:22,259
- Was that- Was that your husband?
- Ha-ha. Very funny.

601
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,793
No, but I mean, you have no husband,
no family, no children...

602
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,377
or anything like that?

603
00:33:27,461 --> 00:33:30,377
'Cause some do.
You have a funny look on your face.

604
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:32,377
- Um.
- Did I say the wrong thing?

605
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:34,668
- No. Not really.
- I- I said-

606
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:36,960
No. No, listen.

607
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:39,668
- What are you in the mood for, Len?
- Me? I-I, well,

608
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,960
I would like to-
You know, we can chat for a while.

609
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:44,169
I thought I'd get into it
slowly and, you know-

610
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:46,461
You're married, aren't you?

611
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:49,461
- How can you tell that?
- 'Cause you got that look.

612
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:51,461
That look?
Wh-What look is that?

613
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:54,543
That look like it's been a long time
since you've had a great blow job.

614
00:33:54,627 --> 00:33:58,127
Oh, that look.
I- I can understand.

615
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,627
- Wh-Where are you from?
- Mm, around.

616
00:34:01,752 --> 00:34:04,044
What are you so interested
in me for?

617
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,543
- That's my fingers.
- Yes, I know.

618
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,543
- Here.
- What-

619
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:10,543
Pull, pull!
Pull the strings.

620
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:13,044
- Pull these strings?
- Yeah, pull all the strings. See? See what happens?

621
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:15,710
- I'm not so mechanical as I was.
- Oh, it's easy. Here. Pull.

622
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:18,710
- Ahh! See, it opens!
- Ohh!

623
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:21,314
That's amazing.
Science is- is-

624
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:23,794
- Yeah.
- You, you, you- I-I-

625
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,794
Oh. Really. Well.

626
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,794
Uh, you're a very attractive woman,
a very beautiful young woman.

627
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,794
Oh, thank you, Lenny.

628
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,794
Well, you're cute too.
So, what do you say?

629
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,294
- You wanna go inside, take a shower?
- A shower?

630
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:41,002
- You can study me up close and personal.
- Oh! Oh.

631
00:34:41,086 --> 00:34:43,502
No, see, I bathed already.

632
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,502
- You got lipstick on my fi-

633
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,794
- Mmm, you smell clean. Mmm.
- Thank you. Well-

634
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,342
As I say, I'm basically-
My ear.

635
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:53,877
- You're sensitive, huh?
- It's my weak spot, in my ear.

636
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:56,467
- Oh. Okay.

637
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:59,169
A little nibbling
makes me... go crazy.

638
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,550
Okay, Len.
Are you nervous?

639
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:04,668
I- No. But yes, I am nervous,
to tell you the truth.

640
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:07,481
- You do look that way. - I've never-
I- I've never done this, actually.

641
00:35:07,516 --> 00:35:10,169
- Oh, okay. That's all right.
I'll take it slow. - This is- I-I-

642
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,169
Oh. Okay. I-

643
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:14,378
Um, incidentally, Len,

644
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:17,461
I think I should tell you
ahead of time I-I get 200 dollars.

645
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:19,717
It's no problem.
No problem.

646
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:22,252
- Just a- Just a show of good faith.
- Thanks, Lenny. Wow!

647
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,252
You're really sweet, Len.

648
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:26,426
Put it down
as a religious contribution.

649
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:29,835
No, but seriously, you want to know
why I liked you right from the start?

650
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,336
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm always attracted to losers.

651
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:35,543
Losers?
You think I'm a loser?

652
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:37,752
Yeah.
You got no confidence.

653
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,752
It's sweet.
I like that in a man.

654
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:43,419
I can't stand those johns who come here
and throw down a couple of hundred...

655
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:46,127
and whip out a big dick
and wave it all over the joint.

656
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:49,919
Oh, I- I wouldn't do that
even if I wanted to because I'll just-

657
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:52,675
- Ah, shit!

658
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,710
Hello. Oh, hello,
Angela.

659
00:35:55,835 --> 00:35:59,884
Oh! Oh, wow!
Ha-ha!

660
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:03,127
Oh, God, thank you
for thinking of me.

661
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,127
Yeah, that's great.

662
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:08,919
Okay.
Yeah, well, I'll see you at 10:00.

663
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:11,002
Bye.

664
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,419
I just got a small part
in an Angela Dawson movie.

665
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:16,919
I get to do it with her!

666
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,877
I don't understand you.

667
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:23,502
If you're- If you're serious
about being a Broadway actress,

668
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:25,877
what are you wasting your time
with all this porn for?

669
00:36:26,002 --> 00:36:28,378
What's it to you?
It's good experience.

670
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:31,378
How? Making it with a woman in front
of the camera is good experience?

671
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,877
That's gonna get you closer
to be a Broadway star?

672
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:36,378
- What are you getting all mad for?
- I'm not mad.

673
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:39,461
I just think it's crazy.
You're an attractive young woman.

674
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:41,961
You know, what are you-
You don't have to live like this, Linda.

675
00:36:42,086 --> 00:36:43,961
- What are you, my pastor?
- This is crazy!

676
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:46,669
You take money from guys
and you perform all these acts.

677
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:49,378
You know, you could be-
Hey, I'm talking to you.

678
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:51,752
- You could have a family.
- Hey, let go of me!

679
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,252
- You could have a husband and a child or something.
- All right. No. Hey!

680
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,508
Stop. Stop it now! Stop!

681
00:36:57,543 --> 00:37:00,009
- Listen. I don't like possessive men.
- I'm not possessive.

682
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:02,336
You come in here, you don't want to do
anything with me. You're telling me what to do.

683
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,301
- I want to talk.
- Do you want to do it or not?

684
00:37:04,336 --> 00:37:06,669
- I want to talk. I paid you, I want to talk.
- Oh, no. Okay.

685
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:08,669
- I bought the time.
- Then you get your money back.

686
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:10,835
- I'm giving it back. Refund.
- No, keep the money.

687
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,800
- Let's go. No.
- I bought the time!

688
00:37:12,835 --> 00:37:16,127
- Hey, stop it. No, I'm giving it back and you're leaving.
- Why can't I talk?

689
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:18,127
- Get out!

690
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:31,543
Daddy, why are you
staring at me like that?

691
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:33,627
Come here.

692
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,710
You know why I'm
staring at you?

693
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:38,336
I'm staring at you
'cause I can't believe it.

694
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:40,835
Because you're so bright
and you're such a great kid.

695
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:43,919
Come on, Max.
Now it's time for bed.

696
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,919
Come on. Okay.
Time for beddums.

697
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:49,675
- Ready? The kid's getting heavy.

698
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,710
- He can walk, you know.
- Yeah. Okay. Can you walk?

699
00:37:52,794 --> 00:37:55,710
Poor Weinrib! Turn back.

700
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:59,502
Don't meddle any further.
Accept the truth.

701
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:02,502
I see disaster.
I see catastrophe.

702
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:05,189
Worse, I see lawyers.

703
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:07,794
But wait, a messenger.

704
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:11,981
I come from the midtown area
where Lenny Weinrib,

705
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:14,669
tortured by passions
too overwhelming to regulate,

706
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:17,169
did indeed call
this little hustler on the phone...

707
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,794
in earnest attempt
to see her again.

708
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:21,961
At first he wrestled
with his drives,

709
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,961
trying to master a curiosity...

710
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:27,426
not slaked by this initial meeting,
but only whetted by it.

711
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:32,169
His thirst to know this woman more
did inexorably provoke him to call her.

712
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:35,544
Nervous and confused, at first
he only got her answering machine.

713
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,752
Then, at fifth try,
she picked up the phone herself.

714
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:43,169
Painful to relate that she thought he was
nuts and did not want to meet him nohow.

715
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:46,836
"Stop bothering me, creep,"
was her cutting declaration.

716
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:49,044
Then she used the "F" word.

717
00:38:49,169 --> 00:38:52,627
Agonized, he called again, offering
her abundant financial compensation...

718
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:54,926
just for a brief chat.

719
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:58,127
But she bade him get off her back
and slammed the phone down.

720
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:02,253
Finally, in doldrums mixed
with much anxiety,

721
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:04,253
he stood watch
outside her apartment...

722
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:08,710
and waited until such a time as he did
spot her heading for the laundromat.

723
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:21,211
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, don't get upset or anything.

724
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:23,294
- I just thought we could have lunch.
- Why me?

725
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:26,128
- I'll pay for your time. I just want to speak to you.
- All right!

726
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,093
What are you, some kind
of fucking pervert who-

727
00:39:29,128 --> 00:39:31,919
Leave me alone. I'm not-
I'm not one of those psychopaths...

728
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,919
that kills prostitutes,
I promise you.

729
00:39:34,002 --> 00:39:37,294
- Why would you ever say something like that?
- I'm joking. I'm joking.

730
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:41,502
Listen, in my work, I have to keep
an eye out for strange individuals.

731
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,710
- Okay.
- I knew a girl that got killed.

732
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:46,002
All right. Hey,
I got you some flowers. Here.

733
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:49,002
I got you some flowers.
Let's have lunch. I'll pay for it.

734
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,585
I'll pay for your time.
I just wanna talk to you.

735
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:56,467
So then my mother married
my third father.

736
00:39:56,502 --> 00:39:58,877
I mean, I don't know if she
married him, but he moved in.

737
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:01,669
We didn't get along.
He was a disgusting drunk.

738
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:05,189
What about your hereditary
father? Your actual, actual-

739
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:08,585
Oh, he was a drug pusher
and he was also a car thief.

740
00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:11,752
He picked pockets and, you know,
he burgled and stuff.

741
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:15,378
- And he was an epileptic. - Uh-huh.
You haven't left anything out, right?

742
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:18,169
- Mail fraud!
- Oh, mail fraud. Oh, okay, yeah.

743
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:20,169
- That's what they caught him on.
- Uh-huh.

744
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:22,669
Hey, you got an appetite
like a lumberjack.

745
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:24,669
Oh. Well, thank you.

746
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:26,669
Oh, it's fine.
Eat all you want.

747
00:40:26,752 --> 00:40:30,961
I'm very hungry, actually.
Um, so then I ran away when I was 14.

748
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,426
Mm-hmm.

749
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:35,044
And I went away with
this musician named Johnny.

750
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:38,044
And it was terrible because
we fought all the time, Lenny.

751
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,336
Finally,
he committed suicide.

752
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,627
And for years I thought it
was because of my cooking.

753
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,717
He always hated my clam sauce.

754
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:48,336
And so then I kicked around
from Chicago, Philadelphia, you know.

755
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,336
All over the place.
And I ended up here.

756
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,711
You never thought of
just getting a regular job?

757
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,711
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.
No, I did things.

758
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:58,676
I waited on tables. I worked
in a massage parlor. I did phone sex.

759
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:02,128
Now and then I would, you know, turn a
few tricks in order to make some dough.

760
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:05,794
And one day my friend Susie calls me and
she asks me if I want to be in a film.

761
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:08,627
Something called Snatch Happy.
And I said, "Sure. "

762
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:11,294
And I remember
I was very nervous...

763
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,711
because I'd never done it in front of
people with a camera before, you know.

764
00:41:14,794 --> 00:41:17,919
And so there I am on the first day,
on the set.

765
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:20,585
And there's this guy
fucking me from behind, right?

766
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,378
And there's these two huge guys dressed
like cops in my mouth at the same time.

767
00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:26,585
And I remember
thinking to myself,

768
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:29,502
"I like acting. I wanna study. "

769
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:33,794
Yes, well.
It's a- It's a-

770
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:36,877
That's one way
of getting into the profession.

771
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,926
Um, tell me about
your family a little bit.

772
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:41,461
What? I told you already.
You could write a book by now.

773
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,585
But, but were there
any unusual members?

774
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:46,961
- Very bright ones or brilliant or talented or something.
- Mmm! Yes!

775
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:48,961
- I'm sorry. There was.
- Mmm.

776
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:51,086
My father's brother
was supposed to be a genius.

777
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:53,253
I never met him, but everybody
said he was brilliant.

778
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:57,044
- Really? What did he do?
- He was a serial rapist. He spent his whole life in jail.

779
00:41:57,169 --> 00:42:00,044
But if he had gone straight,
he might have been very good in math.

780
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:02,211
- Good in math. Well, that's-
- Yeah.

781
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:04,218
I think I got
my intelligence from him,

782
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,544
because everybody else in the family
is all slugs and lowlifes.

783
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:09,044
- I'm the only one with any ambition.
- Are you?

784
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,544
And you never- never
had a drive to get married?

785
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:13,544
What for?
They're all assholes.

786
00:42:13,627 --> 00:42:15,544
One of them used to
beat me up.

787
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:18,544
Another one used to fuck
my best friend when I wasn't looking.

788
00:42:18,627 --> 00:42:21,189
- It was sickening.
- Really.

789
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,752
And- And let me
ask you this.

790
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,836
At any point in your life
did you ever think, like,

791
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,336
"Maybe I'd like
to have a child"?

792
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:35,627
Um, I-I did have
a child once.

793
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:38,211
- Did you?
- Ah, it was a sad story.

794
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:40,502
I'll tell you some other time
when I know you better.

795
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:42,919
If I ever know you better.

796
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:46,884
Are you free this afternoon?

797
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:49,211
- Why?
- You have some free time this afternoon?

798
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:51,502
- Are you finally in the mood, Lenny?
- No, no, no, no, no.

799
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:53,676
I wanna-
I have an assignment.

800
00:42:53,711 --> 00:42:56,711
But I thought you might wanna come
with me, 'cause I think you'll enjoy it.

801
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:06,586
I'm gonna bet on a horse,
and if it wins you can keep the dough.

802
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:09,260
Here's one. "Eager Beaver. "

803
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,260
I once did a film
called Beaver Patrol...

804
00:43:11,295 --> 00:43:13,968
about these Boy Scouts who find
drunk Girl Scouts in the woods.

805
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:17,586
And they take them into a cabin and they reach
into their packs and they pull out these dildos.

806
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:19,961
- And then-
- All right, all right. Okay, we'll-

807
00:43:20,086 --> 00:43:21,961
Y- You're sure you want
to bet on Eager Beaver?

808
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:24,169
- 'Cause it's a 60-to-1.
- Oh, yeah. No, I know it's the one. No!

809
00:43:24,295 --> 00:43:26,461
- But it's 60-to-1.
- It's a sign. I know it's gonna work.

810
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:28,586
All right, all right.
Famous last words.

811
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:30,669
- You know.
- I got a hunch.

812
00:43:30,752 --> 00:43:32,961
- You got a hunch. Okay. Sure, we'll bet on it.
- Yeah.

813
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,461
Okay. So if he wins,
how much do I make?

814
00:43:35,544 --> 00:43:38,717
At 60-to-1?
Uh... you make, uh, $3,000.

815
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:41,961
Oh, my God! I could get that blue
chinchilla coat that I wanted!

816
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:43,961
- You could get anything you want.
- I could get a Jacuzzi.

817
00:43:44,044 --> 00:43:47,169
- Except he's not gonna win.
- Oh, no, I know what I could do, Lenny!

818
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:49,461
- Oh, my God! This is great.
- Mm-hmm.

819
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,836
All right. You know,
I hope- I hope you're right.

820
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:54,961
There's a reason the horse is 60-to-1,
though. He's probably got polio.

821
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:57,627
Oh, no, no. No.
This is a sign.

822
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:59,801
- All right.
- My luck is gonna change.

823
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:03,253
- So is your real name Linda? Is that your actual name?
- I use a lot of names.

824
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:07,128
My born name is Leslie, but I like
to use names that have nice meanings.

825
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,128
You know, like Mary,
for the Virgin Mary.

826
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:11,711
Or Angel or Linda,
which means "pretty" in Spanish.

827
00:44:11,836 --> 00:44:14,711
- But my screen name's Judy Cum.
- Mm-hmm.

828
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:17,211
Well, lucky there's not a horse
with that name in the race...

829
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:19,211
- 'cause we'd bet on him.
- Oh, no, no, no.

830
00:44:19,336 --> 00:44:21,627
I mean, my attorney friend
would take that under advisement.

831
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:23,919
- Mm-hmm.
- I got exclusive rights to that name.

832
00:44:24,003 --> 00:44:26,128
All right, all right,
all right. Yeah.

833
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,093
So let me ask you
a question.

834
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:30,919
Are you ever frightened that when a guy
comes over your house and pays you...

835
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:33,919
that he's gonna maybe,
like tie you up and kill you?

836
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,420
Oh, no. I always
get paid in advance.

837
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:39,211
- Come on.

838
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,502
- Eager Beaver. He's paying.
- Paid in advance? That's-

839
00:44:41,586 --> 00:44:43,502
Lenny.

840
00:44:43,586 --> 00:44:45,502
- They're coming down to the finish.
- Come on, Beaver!

841
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:47,759
- It's Autumn Daisy and Enmity.
- Come on! Catch up!

842
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:50,086
- Eager Beaver continues to drop back.
- Oh, shit! Oh, Beaver!

843
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:53,170
- Autumn Daisy and Enmity. It's close.
- Beaver! Come on, Beaver!

844
00:44:53,295 --> 00:44:55,586
- Oh! Beaver!
- It's Autumn Daisy by a head.

845
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:57,843
- Shit! Last?
- Enmity finishing second...

846
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:00,086
- and Lower The Flag finishing third,
- Stupid horse got- Damn it!

847
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,295
- followed by Marcy's Pride, True Blue Crew, Classic Alert,
- I had it spent already!

848
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,586
- I know. Relax, relax. Relax, will ya?
- and Eager Beaver was last.

849
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,669
You know, it's not so terrible.
I told you it was a long shot.

850
00:45:08,704 --> 00:45:10,878
- I never have any luck. Never!
- All right.

851
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,378
I never won a fucking thing
in my entire life! Nothing! Never!

852
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:16,961
Will you stay calm?
You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.

853
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:20,135
If it's the money,
I'll lend you the money.

854
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,135
- I can help you.
- No, it's not the money, Lenny.

855
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,462
I don't care about the money.
I just wanted to win so badly.

856
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:28,669
What do you want to win for?
We're just out here having a good time.

857
00:45:28,753 --> 00:45:30,961
- You gotta-
- 'Cause I wanted to impress you.

858
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:34,336
Impress me? What? You know,
you're not running in the race.

859
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:36,627
What- You don't
have to impress me. I'm-

860
00:45:36,753 --> 00:45:39,253
Yeah, but I wanted to show you
I could pick a winner.

861
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,836
Hey. Listen, my horse
didn't win either, you know.

862
00:45:42,919 --> 00:45:44,836
Come on, you-
you do impress me.

863
00:45:44,919 --> 00:45:48,544
You're attractive, you're-
you're quick, you have a lot of energy.

864
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:51,044
- You're obviously a
state-of-the-art fellatrix. - What?

865
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,836
So- Nothing, nothing.
I'm impressed. Take-

866
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:55,836
- Lenny, don't say "nothing. "
- I'm impressed.

867
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,301
- You think I'm stupid?
- I don't think you're stupid, no.

868
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:00,836
- No?
- You know, I think you do a stupid thing with your life.

869
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:02,801
But I told you that already.

870
00:46:02,836 --> 00:46:05,260
Well, I don't understand
why it matters so much to you.

871
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:08,502
Hey, come on. We'll stay for one more
race, and this time I'll bet for you.

872
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:10,711
- Yeah? - Let me make the
bet. Yeah. N-No. Come on.

873
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:12,794
- We'll just go to the window and I'll make one bet.
- All right.

874
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:14,968
Please don't pick one
that runs second...

875
00:46:15,003 --> 00:46:17,003
- 'cause I want a winner, okay, Len?
- Yeah. Hey.

876
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:20,502
You know, they give these horses saliva
tests. I can't guarantee anything.

877
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:26,794
- I gave you your winnings, right?
- Yeah.

878
00:46:26,878 --> 00:46:30,586
That was a great race.
Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.

879
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:33,586
Well, he was a heavy favorite, you know,
and I bet him to come in third.

880
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:36,586
- At least this way you get something.
- Yeah.

881
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:38,551
So, you wanna come in?

882
00:46:38,586 --> 00:46:41,794
I gotta go home.
I got a wife and kid. You know, I can't.

883
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:45,878
You know, you only talk about me.
You never talk about yourself.

884
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:49,378
It's late for me. You know,
I had a great time, but I gotta go.

885
00:46:49,462 --> 00:46:51,669
I feel I owe you a great fuck.

886
00:46:51,753 --> 00:46:55,753
Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs,
rest your ulcer, stay in tonight.

887
00:46:55,878 --> 00:46:58,462
I can't stay in.
I got six dates.

888
00:46:58,544 --> 00:47:00,544
Six dates.
Slow night for you, right?

889
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:04,836
I wish I had the penicillin concession
in your apartment. I'd- I'd be wealthy.

890
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:07,544
All right.
So, you're gonna call me again?

891
00:47:07,669 --> 00:47:10,253
Am I gonna call you again?
Yeah, I'll call you. Don't worry.

892
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:12,544
- You promise?
- I will. I'll call you again.

893
00:47:12,627 --> 00:47:14,836
Okay. I had a great time.

894
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:16,836
- Bye.
- Okay.

895
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:18,836
Whew.

896
00:47:31,045 --> 00:47:33,337
- Congratulations.
- Thirty-five years.

897
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,337
- I never thought we'd make it.
- You and Amanda...

898
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,337
have a way to go,
but you'll make it.

899
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,502
- You guys look so young, both of you.
- Yeah, you do.

900
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:41,502
Well, we've kept
each other young.

901
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:44,211
Your mother could be your sister,
and you could be brother and sister.

902
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,211
- You could be my- yes. - I don't
know where that puts me, but anyway-

903
00:47:51,086 --> 00:47:53,586
She looks so beautiful,
doesn't she, Lenny?

904
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:55,794
- To me, she always looks beautiful.
- Mmm.

905
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:57,794
- I just always find her great. And you-

906
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,794
When I said sisters before, I mean it.
You guys look so great.

907
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,378
And it's a wonder,
with all the responsibility...

908
00:48:03,502 --> 00:48:05,794
she has opening
her new gallery.

909
00:48:05,878 --> 00:48:08,467
- It's a lot of work.
- What new gallery? A new gallery?

910
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:11,170
No, I didn't tell you 'cause, you know, I don't
know until it's a hundred percent definite.

911
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,502
- Well, did I say the wrong thing?
- But it's not.

912
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:16,170
- No, sure. No, I just-
- It's a hundred percent definite.

913
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:18,295
You're so insecure.
It's happening.

914
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,794
- Oh, excuse me.

915
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:24,295
- What is the story on this?
- It looks like I have the backing,

916
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:26,253
but it's not totally definite.

917
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:28,253
- That's why I didn't say anything.
- Your mother said it was definite.

918
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:30,462
Yeah, well. It seems as if
I do have the backing.

919
00:48:30,586 --> 00:48:33,170
And there is this wonderful space
on Vesey Street. You know it?

920
00:48:33,253 --> 00:48:35,462
- Vesey? Yeah, I know it.
- Yeah, down in Soho.

921
00:48:35,544 --> 00:48:38,961
And it looks like, you know,
we think we can get it.

922
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:41,926
The Dorians are putting in
some money, but I-

923
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,926
- Well, don't look so happy about it.
- I am happy!

924
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:47,253
I'm very happy for you, but it's
the first I'm hearing of it, you know.

925
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:49,718
- And for your mother to tell me-
- Yeah, well, look.

926
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:52,337
I realize that for a time I'm going
to be busier than usual...

927
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,718
and I know that's
a sore point,

928
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:57,753
but, you know, it'll be only
'til it gets off the ground.

929
00:48:57,788 --> 00:49:00,218
- Hey, I'm happy for you. I re-
- You are?

930
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:02,544
- Yes. I just would have liked to have known it.
- Are you sure?

931
00:49:02,628 --> 00:49:05,420
- The Amanda Sloane Gallery. I think that it's great.
- Yeah, on Vesey Street.

932
00:49:05,544 --> 00:49:08,920
Believe me.
I haven't even told Jerry Bender yet.

933
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:12,420
"You've got a fine right, you have,
after the way you treated Mother,

934
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:14,711
"after the way you treated us all!

935
00:49:14,836 --> 00:49:18,128
"A fine right you've got to come back
in here in your best country manner...

936
00:49:18,212 --> 00:49:21,836
"and strike attitudes
and make stands...

937
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,593
"and criticize my fiance
and give orders...

938
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,920
"and mess things up generally
as if you'd done-

939
00:49:26,955 --> 00:49:28,920
"Well, I can't help it.
It's sickening!

940
00:49:29,003 --> 00:49:31,920
As if he'd done nothing at all!"

941
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Well?

942
00:49:37,003 --> 00:49:38,920
What do you think?

943
00:49:39,003 --> 00:49:41,759
- About what?
- About me.

944
00:49:41,794 --> 00:49:44,398
- You think I'm any good?
- Yes, it's fine.

945
00:49:44,433 --> 00:49:46,968
I- You know, you're asking
the wrong person.

946
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:49,003
I don't know that much about acting,
to tell you the truth.

947
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,003
Oh, I can tell
you're not too impressed.

948
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:54,378
No, no, no. I just thought, you know,
it's a very odd part for you to choose.

949
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:57,343
- Why?
- Well, you know, 'cause it's The Philadelphia Story.

950
00:49:57,378 --> 00:50:00,462
- But I lived in Philadelphia.
- What has that got to do with it?

951
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,878
- I know the city.
- What? You pick a part like this-

952
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:08,378
You should get something closer to
yourself. It wouldn't be such a struggle.

953
00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:10,462
- You know.
- Well, what part should I play?

954
00:50:10,586 --> 00:50:13,010
You know- I don't know.
Something closer.

955
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:15,669
Clint Eastwood doesn't play
a meek little hairdresser.

956
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:18,065
Well, I could play
a hairdresser.

957
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,378
I- I used to-
I used to do it a lot.

958
00:50:20,462 --> 00:50:22,337
I wanted to be one.
I was very good at it.

959
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:25,045
- So why'd you give it up?
- Well, I don't know.

960
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,010
One thing led to another.

961
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:29,170
You know, my aunt worked
in a beauty parlor for years.

962
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:31,753
She loved it.

963
00:50:31,836 --> 00:50:34,753
Wait. You mean
not be an actress?

964
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:37,593
Well, an actress
is a very tough life, you know.

965
00:50:37,628 --> 00:50:40,420
- But a hairdresser could always make a buck.
- A buck?

966
00:50:40,544 --> 00:50:43,337
A buck! An honest buck.
No beatings, no AIDS.

967
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,337
You can meet somebody
that you, you know-

968
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,711
You can get a family, have a real life,
someone that cares for you.

969
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,676
Hey!

970
00:50:50,711 --> 00:50:53,337
Now, don't you think that I want
to meet somebody and get married...

971
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,676
and get the hell
out of the rat race?

972
00:50:55,711 --> 00:50:58,836
I would like to move away
and become a mother and just raise kids.

973
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,836
I don't even want
to be a hairdresser.

974
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,260
If Clint Eastwood wants
to be a hairdresser, just let him.

975
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:07,295
You missed the point. Clint Eastwood
doesn't want to be a hairdresser.

976
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,885
I had a kid, Lenny,

977
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,420
and I gave him up
for adoption.

978
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,420
It's the sorriest thing
I ever did in my entire life.

979
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:22,878
There's not a day
that doesn't go by that I don't...

980
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:25,878
wake up thinking
about him.

981
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,295
Now some lucky family
has him.

982
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:31,795
I just hope to God that they're
taking good care of him.

983
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:35,926
Why'd you give him up?

984
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:38,795
I don't know. I was-
I was all confused.

985
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:42,087
I had no dough. I-I-
I didn't know what to do.

986
00:51:42,122 --> 00:51:44,170
I-

987
00:51:44,253 --> 00:51:46,170
I didn't even know
who the father was.

988
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:48,961
It could've been any one
of a hundred guys.

989
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:51,961
Welcome to planet Earth,
thanks to a broken condom.

990
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:58,253
Gee. That's tough.

991
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:02,045
Um.

992
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,753
What about your kid?

993
00:52:05,836 --> 00:52:08,961
Max? M-M-Ma- You know.
Max is the greatest.

994
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:11,218
- Yeah?
- Well, sure.

995
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,961
Do you have
a picture of him?

996
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:17,753
- A picture of Max?
- Yeah. I'd like to see him.

997
00:52:17,788 --> 00:52:19,718
Oh.

998
00:52:19,753 --> 00:52:22,253
Uh, yeah, I guess I-

999
00:52:29,628 --> 00:52:32,628
Oh.

1000
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:38,212
He's very sweet. He-

1001
00:52:38,337 --> 00:52:40,212
You're very lucky.

1002
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,378
With Amanda, it was fate.

1003
00:52:42,413 --> 00:52:44,420
With Linda, it's hubris.

1004
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:49,003
His drive to find out, and now,
to change her life, to control her.

1005
00:52:49,038 --> 00:52:51,003
- Yes.
- Danger.

1006
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:54,503
Wait. Wait,
I see... danger.

1007
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:58,212
Hey, wait a minute. I don't have
any interest in controlling her.

1008
00:52:58,295 --> 00:53:00,295
I'm doing this for Max's sake.

1009
00:53:00,379 --> 00:53:04,087
When the kid gets older, inevitably
he's gonna trace his mother.

1010
00:53:04,212 --> 00:53:06,379
And, you know, I'd be happier...

1011
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:09,795
if she was married and a-
a hairdresser, you know,

1012
00:53:09,878 --> 00:53:12,795
rather than the star
of The Enchanted Pussy.

1013
00:53:12,878 --> 00:53:16,843
Danger! I see horrible,
horrible danger!

1014
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:20,670
- Terrible danger!
- Hey, I can handle myself emotionally.

1015
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:24,187
Not emotional danger,
physical danger.

1016
00:53:24,222 --> 00:53:27,670
I see a bald man.
He has a lead pipe.

1017
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:30,170
He's breaking your kneecaps.

1018
00:53:36,544 --> 00:53:39,170
So, so, uh, what did, uh-
How did Jerry Bender take it...

1019
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:41,753
when you said that
the decision was final?

1020
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:43,836
You know what?
He was amazing.

1021
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:47,962
I thought he'd be upset, but no,
he was very excited and very supportive.

1022
00:53:48,045 --> 00:53:50,927
No, he's being-
He was absolutely great about it.

1023
00:53:50,962 --> 00:53:53,962
Anyway, I-I'm calling to say
I can't make dinner tonight.

1024
00:53:54,045 --> 00:53:55,927
Oh, you're kidding.
It's gonna be great.

1025
00:53:55,962 --> 00:54:00,128
Everybody in the Madison Square Garden
organization's gonna be there.

1026
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:02,128
Look, there's no way
I can get away.

1027
00:54:02,254 --> 00:54:05,254
The architects are here
and the Dorians are in town from Paris.

1028
00:54:05,337 --> 00:54:09,212
And, uh, the architects fly back
to Milan tonight. I can't.

1029
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:12,544
All right, well.
I'll tell you what.

1030
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:15,212
What I'll do is, I'll go home
and I'll put Max to sleep.

1031
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:17,337
I'll spend a little time
there and then-

1032
00:54:17,372 --> 00:54:19,628
Then- Oh.

1033
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:22,628
Uh, look, let me-
I'm gonna call you back. I got, uh-

1034
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:25,093
I'm gonna call you back.
Oh, geez.

1035
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,128
It's just against our policy-
- I understand!

1036
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,093
- If you wanna wait right here.
- Whatever.

1037
00:54:29,128 --> 00:54:31,419
- Lenny, there's someone here to see you.
- Lenny!

1038
00:54:31,454 --> 00:54:33,676
- Uh, yes. Uh, c-c-come
in. Come in. - Lenny!

1039
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:36,295
- Th-This is Miss Gildersleeve.
She's an acquaintance. - You know her?

1040
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,795
- Gildersleeve?
- Yes, Miss- Miss Gildersleeve.

1041
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,878
We're old- It's okay. It's okay.
I'll be in here.

1042
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:44,503
- You don't need anything?
- No, no! I'm fine.

1043
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:46,468
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

1044
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:49,087
- What are you doing here?
- Lenny? Lenny, I got to talk to you.

1045
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,503
Ricky threatened to- to-
to hurt me. He-

1046
00:54:51,586 --> 00:54:55,170
- Who's Ricky?
- He takes a percentage of my work.

1047
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:58,795
- He's a pimp, right?
- No, he's like a business representative.

1048
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,052
What do you need a business repre-
You- You-

1049
00:55:01,087 --> 00:55:04,379
All you need is a mattress and a couple
of garter belts. You're not a conglomerate.

1050
00:55:04,462 --> 00:55:06,670
Lenny, he said he
was going to cut me up...

1051
00:55:06,753 --> 00:55:09,170
because I told him I didn't
want to work anymore.

1052
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:12,878
Well, I think it's a great
idea that you want to phase out.

1053
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:14,962
- He has no qualms about killing me.
- Ohh.

1054
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,254
Listen, we'll call the police.
That's not a big deal.

1055
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:19,878
How can I call the police
with my setup?

1056
00:55:19,962 --> 00:55:22,670
You know, I told you
a thousand times...

1057
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,753
you're in a hazardous business.

1058
00:55:24,837 --> 00:55:27,219
So that's what happens.
Now, so- Don't go outside.

1059
00:55:27,254 --> 00:55:30,462
I'm not going outside. I thought,
just maybe, if you could talk to him.

1060
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,962
- Me? What, are you nuts?
- Yeah, because-

1061
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:35,753
Because you're smart and bright
and you got a way with words.

1062
00:55:35,788 --> 00:55:37,920
I can't talk to him.
I don't even know the guy.

1063
00:55:38,045 --> 00:55:40,920
Yeah, well, he knows it was your idea
that I get out of the business.

1064
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:43,128
So he said he's gonna
kill you too.

1065
00:55:43,254 --> 00:55:45,837
- He said he was gonna kill me?
- Yeah, 'cause it was your idea.

1066
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,920
He's gonna cut up my face
and put a bullet between your eyes.

1067
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:53,545
Really? Did he-
Did he specify the caliber?

1068
00:55:53,628 --> 00:55:57,003
Listen, I just thought maybe
you could just reason with him.

1069
00:55:57,038 --> 00:56:00,003
No, I can't.
I- Listen, I never told you this,

1070
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:02,628
but I got a- a slight
heart murmur...

1071
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:05,003
and right now
it's murmuring "hide. "

1072
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,003
- I don't believe you're a coward.

1073
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:09,795
Only in actuality.
Um, this is not for me.

1074
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,586
- Lenny, I need your help.
- No, I'm not a violence person.

1075
00:56:12,711 --> 00:56:16,586
I- I write about hockey and boxing
and football. This is not my world.

1076
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:19,878
Lenny, I do want to quit like you said,
but he said he's not gonna let me!

1077
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:22,586
- He's gonna hurt us both. Please!
- Relax, relax.

1078
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:25,586
What do you want me to do?
How am I gonna talk to him?

1079
00:56:25,711 --> 00:56:27,635
- Well, okay. You just-
- I-

1080
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,003
You just talk because you're smarter
than he is and stronger than he is.

1081
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,795
You're a much better man. So just
remember that when you talk to him.

1082
00:56:33,878 --> 00:56:37,670
He's a little bit intimidating.
He's got a bald head and an earring.

1083
00:56:37,705 --> 00:56:40,795
- But you'll win. I know you will.
- Jesus, I- I-

1084
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:42,962
You're a good man, Lenny.
You'll win.

1085
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:44,962
Look, in case anything
comes up,

1086
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:49,170
I want you to know that I-I'm
type O-positive, okay?

1087
00:56:49,254 --> 00:56:52,254
Derek, I got the feeling you
came here and obviously moved...

1088
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:54,344
into this whole Knick persona.

1089
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:56,962
- Did you get caught up, maybe, with a little bit of this Knick,
- Excuse me.

1090
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:59,462
"I gotta be physical,
I gotta be tough," and maybe-

1091
00:56:59,497 --> 00:57:01,427
I'm, uh, I'm
Lenny Gildersleeve.

1092
00:57:01,462 --> 00:57:04,753
I- I'm a friend
of Linda- Linda Ash's.

1093
00:57:04,837 --> 00:57:08,254
And, uh, I thought
that perhaps we could-

1094
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:10,254
See-

1095
00:57:10,337 --> 00:57:12,545
What I want to discuss
with you is that...

1096
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:15,628
there comes a time in the life
of every young woman,

1097
00:57:15,753 --> 00:57:17,802
not just Linda, but everyone,

1098
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:21,628
that they- they want to perhaps
make a change in their life.

1099
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:25,254
They maybe want to settle down
or explore alternative lifestyles.

1100
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:29,379
I don't think you've been a very good
influence on Linda, Mr. Weinrib.

1101
00:57:29,414 --> 00:57:33,421
Weinrib. Right. So Gildersleeve
is a name I use for business purposes.

1102
00:57:33,545 --> 00:57:35,920
- I got an investment in Linda.
- No question.

1103
00:57:36,003 --> 00:57:38,503
I honor that. But-
But by now, she's probably...

1104
00:57:38,628 --> 00:57:40,593
repaid you tenfold
or twentyfold or-

1105
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:43,795
Don't be so fuckin' sure, 'cause you
don't know what the fuckin' numbers are!

1106
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,920
That's a point well taken.
Excuse me, you're- you're- Excuse me.

1107
00:57:47,003 --> 00:57:50,003
I- I-I understand what you're saying.
Is that a Pellegrino?

1108
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:52,969
Can I- Because you've
bent my throat now a little bit.

1109
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:55,920
And, uh, the windpipe used to
hang straight until this moment.

1110
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:57,920
The fuckin' Knicks suck!

1111
00:57:58,004 --> 00:57:59,878
They need a good shootin' forward.

1112
00:58:00,004 --> 00:58:02,004
Yes, well, there's gonna
be a three-way trade.

1113
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:04,004
I don't know if you guys
heard anything about it.

1114
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:06,295
- Seattle, Atlanta and the Knicks are talking.
- Bullshit.

1115
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,503
- No, no, no. I kid you not. I know. It's in the air.
- Yeah?

1116
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:10,670
- They're discussing a trade.
- So what do you think about the Nets?

1117
00:58:10,705 --> 00:58:12,937
- You think the Nets got a chance?
- The Nets? Yes, I do.

1118
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:15,170
If they're injury-free,
I think they have a good chance.

1119
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:17,586
I like the Nets. I think they're
one or two years away, is all.

1120
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,586
I would say two or three myself.

1121
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,670
You see, we have a common interest,
the three of us.

1122
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:25,462
- What were we talking about?
- Linda, Linda Ash.

1123
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,878
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That girl's goin' no place.

1124
00:58:28,962 --> 00:58:32,462
She walks on me, I'll disfigure her
and I'll fuckin' kill you.

1125
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:35,878
See, that's exactly what
Dr. Kleinholtz would call "acting out. "

1126
00:58:35,962 --> 00:58:38,045
- Don't tell me how to run my fuckin' business!
- I'm not!

1127
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,062
My girls do
what I tell 'em to do.

1128
00:58:40,097 --> 00:58:42,010
Far be it for me to advise you.

1129
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:44,337
You obviously have a work ethic
that's specific to your needs.

1130
00:58:44,462 --> 00:58:47,545
That's why you can afford
an establishment like this, you know.

1131
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,628
You're gonna take that from him?

1132
00:58:49,753 --> 00:58:52,802
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1133
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:55,628
I'm about to have an
out-of-body-experience here.

1134
00:58:55,753 --> 00:58:58,129
- Show strength.
- Show strength?

1135
00:58:58,254 --> 00:59:01,129
This guy's gonna put me
into 27 separate Mason jars.

1136
00:59:01,254 --> 00:59:04,545
The girl was right. They respect
strength. They despise cowardice.

1137
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:06,628
Power is all they know.
Stand firm.

1138
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:08,712
- Remember brave Achilles.
- Hey, don't get-

1139
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:12,212
Achilles only had an Achilles heel.
I have a full Achilles body.

1140
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:15,421
- Go on!

1141
00:59:15,503 --> 00:59:17,969
Look, I'm gonna level
with you.

1142
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:20,920
I want to discuss
this Linda Ash thing and I-I-

1143
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:23,885
What are you so interested
in Linda for anyway, huh?

1144
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,628
- Are you fuckin' her?
- No, we have a strictly platonic relationship.

1145
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:28,628
- Yeah?
- It's a good shirt.

1146
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:32,004
Well, if you're a friend of hers, don't
be putting stupid ideas in her head.

1147
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,313
She's liable to get hurt.
You too.

1148
00:59:34,348 --> 00:59:36,587
You're gonna
let him do that to you?

1149
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:39,177
Hey, look. Would you do me a favor
and go back to Athens?

1150
00:59:39,212 --> 00:59:43,503
You gonna let your son's mother remain
a white slave to this two-bit pimp?

1151
00:59:43,587 --> 00:59:45,503
It- It's starting
to look that way, isn't it?

1152
00:59:45,587 --> 00:59:47,503
- You get them Knicks tickets yet?
- No tickets.

1153
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:49,503
- I tried everywhere.

1154
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:52,795
- Do you need tickets to the Knicks
game? Because I- - Why? Who do you know?

1155
00:59:52,878 --> 00:59:54,795
Me? I-I can help you.

1156
00:59:54,878 --> 00:59:57,135
We want seats on the floor,
next to the movie stars.

1157
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,962
If you want to discuss a deal with
Linda, I can get you courtside seats.

1158
01:00:00,087 --> 01:00:02,296
You can't get 'em.
Nobody can get 'em, 'cause I tried.

1159
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:04,962
No, I can, though.
I- I'm a sportswriter. I can get 'em.

1160
01:00:05,087 --> 01:00:07,670
I'd fuckin' give you my mother
for courtside seats,

1161
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:09,670
much less this cheap little whore.

1162
01:00:09,753 --> 01:00:12,753
That's perfectly put, succinctly put.
I know what point you're making.

1163
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:15,545
- But if you're tryin' to fuckin'
pull something, - Easy. Take it-

1164
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:18,462
I will shoot you and her
through the fuckin' eyeballs!

1165
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:21,670
It's silly to haggle over details.

1166
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:24,837
Well, I'll get the tickets.
I'll get the tickets, I promise.

1167
01:00:24,962 --> 01:00:27,337
Then we can discuss Linda.

1168
01:00:34,837 --> 01:00:36,753
Dad, are you very brave?

1169
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:39,753
Am I brave? It's funny
you should ask that question.

1170
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:42,753
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson?

1171
01:00:42,837 --> 01:00:45,302
What? What?
Who would win what?

1172
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:48,302
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson?

1173
01:00:48,337 --> 01:00:51,837
- Me versus Mike Tyson? Who do you think would win?
- You?

1174
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:53,802
There'd be no contest,
you know.

1175
01:00:53,837 --> 01:00:57,337
He would probably take the early rounds,
but I'd get to him eventually.

1176
01:00:57,372 --> 01:01:00,583
I'd chase him all over the ring.
It's my style. Always was.

1177
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:03,957
On the whole, I think it
will work. Yeah, I think it will.

1178
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:07,296
The only thing is, I want the gallery
to be lit from above,

1179
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:10,296
so I guess the skylight
will have to be enlarged.

1180
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:12,795
- Honey? Bed? Could you?
- Me or him?

1181
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,795
Him. Please?

1182
01:01:23,712 --> 01:01:26,587
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't do this. I can't.

1183
01:01:26,712 --> 01:01:30,587
- Why are you fighting this?
- 'Cause I'm married and I have a family.

1184
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,587
A- And I love Lenny.

1185
01:01:33,795 --> 01:01:35,760
I love him.

1186
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:38,296
So, who are you trying
to convince, you or me?

1187
01:01:44,753 --> 01:01:47,219
- I got you a present.
- You're kidding.

1188
01:01:47,254 --> 01:01:50,254
Yeah. For fixing things up
with me and Ricky.

1189
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:53,254
- I know he can be really rough.
- That was completely unnecessary.

1190
01:01:53,379 --> 01:01:55,254
Very sweet,
but completely unnecessary.

1191
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:59,171
You didn't want a blow job, so the least
I could do was get you a tie.

1192
01:01:59,254 --> 01:02:01,171
Good thinking.
That's uh- Oh!

1193
01:02:01,254 --> 01:02:03,670
- Yes, it's a tie, isn't it?

1194
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:07,171
- Would you ever wear anything that bright?
- If the occasion demanded.

1195
01:02:07,254 --> 01:02:11,337
You know, like if I ever get invited
to the Mardi Gras, I could-

1196
01:02:11,463 --> 01:02:14,837
Oh, good. Lenny, do you want
a sandwich? I'm gonna have a sandwich.

1197
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:17,837
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Oh, okay.

1198
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,337
- It's great.
- Good.

1199
01:02:20,421 --> 01:02:22,337
You know what, Lenny?

1200
01:02:22,421 --> 01:02:25,837
I couldn't get your son's picture
out of my mind.

1201
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,837
- Well, he's a very cute kid, you know.
- Yeah.

1202
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,837
Len?

1203
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,837
I think I would be
a good mother.

1204
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,837
I think you'd be a great mother.
You're very affectionate.

1205
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,837
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1206
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,296
I would like to start over again.
Maybe have a house. That would be nice.

1207
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:45,296
It would be great, you know.
I think it'd be fabulous.

1208
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:47,296
- And you could do it.
- Yeah?

1209
01:02:47,421 --> 01:02:50,296
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. - The problem
is, now, finding the right guy.

1210
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:53,296
I need to find somebody
who'll love me, you know.

1211
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:55,296
Somebody who'll take care
of me and respect me.

1212
01:02:55,421 --> 01:02:57,386
Well, I'll keep my eye open.

1213
01:02:57,421 --> 01:02:59,844
You know, maybe-
maybe- who knows?

1214
01:02:59,879 --> 01:03:03,629
The only thing is, Len,
he'd have to be as smart as me.

1215
01:03:03,664 --> 01:03:07,379
I'm sure there's somebody out there,
you know, that can-

1216
01:03:07,414 --> 01:03:10,146
- You'll find an equal somewhere.
- Yeah?

1217
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:12,879
And don't worry, Len.
I gave up on you.

1218
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,844
- M-
- I knew it couldn't be.

1219
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:18,087
Let me tell you, at my age,
if I made love with you,

1220
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:20,587
they would have to
put me on a resuscitator.

1221
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:22,052
Ha.

1222
01:03:22,087 --> 01:03:24,052
- This is Max.

1223
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:26,052
- Max.
- This is my kid.

1224
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:28,052
- How old are you?
- I'm five.

1225
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:30,087
- You're five? You gonna be a fighter?
- Yeah.

1226
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:33,046
Max is gonna be
a middleweight when he gets older.

1227
01:03:33,171 --> 01:03:36,046
He's gonna be a heavyweight,
the way you're carryin' him.

1228
01:03:36,171 --> 01:03:39,670
I'm gonna teach you how to box, Max.
I'm gonna show you a combination punch.

1229
01:03:39,754 --> 01:03:42,670
One-five, one-five.
Two, three and four, you're gonna get.

1230
01:03:42,754 --> 01:03:45,670
- Hey, Ray. This is my kid Max.
- How you doin', Max?

1231
01:03:45,754 --> 01:03:48,628
Max is gonna be a middleweight
when he gets older.

1232
01:03:48,754 --> 01:03:52,046
- Maybe a heavyweight?
Yeah, I think a heavyweight.

1233
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:55,046
- You wanna go hit the bag with me?
- Okay.

1234
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,011
- Nice kid.
- He's a doll.

1235
01:03:57,046 --> 01:03:59,011
So, what's with
the Sanchez thing?

1236
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:02,046
Is he gonna win that?
Is he training? Is he not training?

1237
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:05,046
- He can do it. He's in the best shape of his life.
- Yeah?

1238
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:08,046
The only thing is, you don't know
what these guys do outside the gym.

1239
01:04:08,129 --> 01:04:11,046
- Well, that's the point. You hear all these stories.
- He'll be all right.

1240
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:14,503
Hey, Kevin, come here. I wanna introduce
you to my friend Lenny Weinrib.

1241
01:04:14,629 --> 01:04:18,503
- He's a sportswriter. He writes about boxing.
- How you doin'?

1242
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:22,004
- Listen, I'm gonna get warmed up, all right?
- Show us what you can do.

1243
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:25,004
- My hand's still a little sore.
- Wrap it up good. You'll be okay.

1244
01:04:25,129 --> 01:04:28,503
- I don't know that kid.
- This kid can move. He hits good too.

1245
01:04:28,629 --> 01:04:30,503
Got nice hand speed,
you know?

1246
01:04:30,587 --> 01:04:34,004
Only thing is, you don't know about
these guys- sometimes they lack desire.

1247
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:37,004
I seen it a million times. I don't know
if he's got the killer instinct.

1248
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:41,004
Keeps talkin' about goin' back upstate
where he comes from on an onion farm.

1249
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:44,503
- He wants to be an onion farmer. You believe it?
- That kid's a farmer?

1250
01:04:44,587 --> 01:04:47,004
He's an onion farmer, yeah. I don't know
how long he's gonna stick around.

1251
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:51,004
That's the problem. It's a shame too;
he hits like a fuckin' mule.

1252
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:54,503
He's fast, but he wants to quit boxing,
go back and hang out on the farm.

1253
01:04:54,587 --> 01:04:56,428
You know, retire.

1254
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:59,962
And the worst thing of all is,
his girlfriend left him.

1255
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,927
- She quit on him.
- Really?

1256
01:05:01,962 --> 01:05:03,927
Took him for everything
he's got.

1257
01:05:03,962 --> 01:05:07,962
He's a nice, sweet kid, but between you
and I, he ain't got too much upstairs.

1258
01:05:07,997 --> 01:05:10,962
They're all alike.
Hey, Len, what's the matter with you?

1259
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:13,962
Looks like you got somethin'
on your mind. I don't understand.

1260
01:05:14,046 --> 01:05:15,927
Hey, Bo!

1261
01:05:15,962 --> 01:05:18,962
This- This is the left,
and this is the right.

1262
01:05:18,997 --> 01:05:21,962
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, Kevin, that's right.

1263
01:05:21,997 --> 01:05:23,962
Yeah.

1264
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,011
Bye-bye.

1265
01:05:27,046 --> 01:05:30,011
- Hi, Lenny. I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

1266
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:33,011
- It's starting to rain.
- Oh, I don't have an umbrella.

1267
01:05:33,046 --> 01:05:36,545
I met a guy this afternoon that I think
would be absolutely great for you.

1268
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,510
- Perfect.
- For me?

1269
01:05:38,545 --> 01:05:41,545
- Yes. He's young, he's strong, he's healthy.
- What does he do?

1270
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:44,545
H- H-He's, you know, like,
dicking around in agriculture.

1271
01:05:44,629 --> 01:05:46,545
What's wrong with his dick?

1272
01:05:46,629 --> 01:05:48,545
No, no, no, he's a farmer.
The guy's a farmer.

1273
01:05:48,629 --> 01:05:51,545
- You met a farmer?
- Yeah, an onion farmer. It's great.

1274
01:05:51,629 --> 01:05:53,503
- Where?
- At the gym.

1275
01:05:53,629 --> 01:05:56,421
What the hell is an onion farmer
doing at the gym?

1276
01:05:56,503 --> 01:06:00,421
He's- He's f-finishing a-a-a
very productive career as a boxer.

1277
01:06:00,503 --> 01:06:02,421
A boxer? Oh, Lenny.

1278
01:06:02,503 --> 01:06:05,921
No, he's- Look, he doesn't
want to be a boxer anymore.

1279
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,921
H- He's- He wants to meet
the right girl and be a farmer.

1280
01:06:10,004 --> 01:06:13,921
- Don't look at me. - He's per- His
brother has a big onion farm upstate.

1281
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,969
Just think of it.
It'd be so great.

1282
01:06:17,004 --> 01:06:21,213
A small town, and you're- y-you're
hairdressing and, and raising kids.

1283
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:23,213
What small town?

1284
01:06:23,296 --> 01:06:25,712
- Wampsville.
- Where?

1285
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:28,171
Wampsville.
It's an old Indian name.

1286
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:30,171
I- I-It's a place rich
in American heritage.

1287
01:06:30,296 --> 01:06:32,171
Are you off
your fucking rocker?

1288
01:06:32,296 --> 01:06:35,670
I'm gonna go marry an onion farmer
and do hair in Wimpsville?

1289
01:06:35,795 --> 01:06:37,670
Wampsville,
not Wimpsville.

1290
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:39,962
It's so perfect.
He's a nice, sweet guy.

1291
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,927
Oh, come on. Forget it.

1292
01:06:41,962 --> 01:06:44,962
He's perfect, though.
He's bright- You'll think he's bright.

1293
01:06:44,997 --> 01:06:47,927
- He is a fucking onion farmer.
- That's okay.

1294
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,962
He's a nice kid.
More important, he's honest and decent.

1295
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:53,962
And don't offer to give him a blow job
in the first five minutes,

1296
01:06:54,046 --> 01:06:56,962
- 'cause he thinks you're a hairdresser.
- You lied?

1297
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,962
- I-
- You shouldn't lie.

1298
01:06:59,046 --> 01:07:02,545
Just do what I'm telling you.
Just listen to me for once.

1299
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,510
I'm off the girls,
Lenny.

1300
01:07:04,545 --> 01:07:07,545
I mean, the last girl I was with
cheated me out of all my dough, man.

1301
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:10,510
I'm telling you, this is a nice kid,
Kevin. She's nice.

1302
01:07:10,545 --> 01:07:13,510
- This the hairdresser you told me about?
- This is the hairdresser.

1303
01:07:13,545 --> 01:07:17,545
I gave you a big buildup. This girl
could have her pick of any guy she wants.

1304
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:20,046
- I said good things about you.
- What'd you tell her?

1305
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:23,046
I told her you were handsome,
a good-looking guy;

1306
01:07:23,129 --> 01:07:26,046
that you're a great athlete;
that you're gifted, bright.

1307
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:29,046
- You didn't lie.
- Would I lie? Of course not.

1308
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,046
You told her I could fight?

1309
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:33,046
I told her, but
what touches her heart...

1310
01:07:33,129 --> 01:07:35,504
is that you want
to be a farmer.

1311
01:07:35,629 --> 01:07:39,004
This is a girl that has a love
of the soil, I promise you.

1312
01:07:39,129 --> 01:07:41,504
Onions. Onions.
My brother's got an onion farm.

1313
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:45,004
I wanna go back up there 'cause I
wanna get the hell outta this city.

1314
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:48,004
That's perfect! You mention onions
to Linda, she goes crazy!

1315
01:07:48,129 --> 01:07:51,004
She goes nuts, you say "onion. "

1316
01:07:51,088 --> 01:07:54,004
You say "onion" to Linda,
the girl is just-

1317
01:07:54,088 --> 01:07:57,004
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

1318
01:07:57,088 --> 01:07:59,004
That's her name?
Linda?

1319
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:03,004
Linda. It's a pretty name.
What are you so, so, so standoffish-

1320
01:08:03,088 --> 01:08:06,504
- Is that with an "E-R" or a "U-R"?
- Is what with an "E-R" or-

1321
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:09,504
- "Linder"?
- Linda. Linda with an "A." Linda.

1322
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,504
- Oh.
- She's a great kid.

1323
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,504
And she's
a substantial woman.

1324
01:08:13,587 --> 01:08:15,463
This is not a dumb girl.

1325
01:08:15,587 --> 01:08:19,463
This girl has got a PhD i-i-in...
root and follicle culture.

1326
01:08:19,587 --> 01:08:22,463
- And she's pretty, right?
- To die. She's to die.

1327
01:08:22,587 --> 01:08:24,962
'Cause that's important.
'Cause I've been stung.

1328
01:08:25,088 --> 01:08:27,962
The last girl I was with
drove me up the wall, man.

1329
01:08:28,088 --> 01:08:31,754
- She made my stomach sick to the stomach.
- Linda is church people.

1330
01:08:31,879 --> 01:08:34,254
- That's what I want. I want a church girl.
- She's great.

1331
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:38,254
I want a nice church girl; I don't want
one of these fast New York sluts.

1332
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,254
I want a nice, homely girl who likes to raise
a family and dogs and that kind of thing.

1333
01:08:42,338 --> 01:08:45,545
Can I say two words to you?
Can I say two words?

1334
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,545
Butter churn. Okay?

1335
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:50,046
Butter churn.
This is a pioneer girl.

1336
01:08:50,129 --> 01:08:53,046
This is a girl who is practically,
incidentally, a virgin.

1337
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,011
What do you mean,
"practically"?

1338
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:59,545
I wanna level with you- sh-she's slept
with one or two guys in her life.

1339
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,510
An old college professor...

1340
01:09:01,545 --> 01:09:03,545
a- a-and her childhood
sweetheart.

1341
01:09:03,629 --> 01:09:06,545
But both of them were killed
in combat for their nation.

1342
01:09:06,629 --> 01:09:09,545
- It's a sad story.
- A professor got killed in combat?

1343
01:09:09,629 --> 01:09:11,545
Humanities regiment.

1344
01:09:11,629 --> 01:09:14,921
You know, they were the first ones
to land at Anzio. I'm telling you-

1345
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:18,004
You said she was an actress?
She's been in some films?

1346
01:09:18,129 --> 01:09:22,004
- She's had a couple of good roles, yeah.
- She's ever been in anything I seen?

1347
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:25,004
Hey- You didn't see
Schindler's List?

1348
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:29,504
No, no, no- T-That was- That was-
That was the one with the Jews and, um-

1349
01:09:29,629 --> 01:09:32,504
- Who were the bad guys?
- The blond guys were the Nazis.

1350
01:09:32,587 --> 01:09:34,921
- They were tough motherfuckers.
- Yeah, all right.

1351
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,004
I'm telling you, this is a good girl.
She's wonderful.

1352
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:39,969
He's playing God.

1353
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:42,504
It would be nice
if he could bring this off.

1354
01:09:42,539 --> 01:09:43,969
It's hubris!

1355
01:09:44,004 --> 01:09:46,587
He spent a lot of time
preparing her.

1356
01:10:24,338 --> 01:10:27,255
Listen, have you, uh-

1357
01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:30,754
given any more thought
to what we discussed?

1358
01:10:30,837 --> 01:10:32,754
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1359
01:10:32,837 --> 01:10:37,754
I mean- Look, the problem is, I don't
know how I feel anymore; I'm confused.

1360
01:10:37,837 --> 01:10:40,754
- I-
- Listen, Amanda, I love you.

1361
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,754
Yeah?

1362
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:47,213
You're never gonna be able to forgive
yourself if you don't give it a try.

1363
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:00,213
Kevin.

1364
01:11:00,338 --> 01:11:03,712
This is Linda.
Linda, this is, uh-

1365
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:05,712
This is Kevin.

1366
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,712
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

1367
01:11:10,296 --> 01:11:12,213
So-

1368
01:11:14,088 --> 01:11:18,296
I'll go and- I just wanted to
bring you guys together, you know.

1369
01:11:19,712 --> 01:11:22,213
You know, you could
maybe stick around, maybe.

1370
01:11:22,248 --> 01:11:24,178
You know, we could
go out or somethin'.

1371
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:27,171
- Yeah.
- No, no. I'm completely superfluous.

1372
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:30,136
Oh, you don't feel good?

1373
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:32,636
No, I'm superfluous.
I'm completely unnecessary.

1374
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:37,171
You guys can have a great time
and I'll- I got stuff to do, you know.

1375
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:42,171
- I got these for you.
- What are these, daisies?

1376
01:11:42,206 --> 01:11:44,171
- Uh-
- That's great.

1377
01:11:44,206 --> 01:11:46,136
That's nice.

1378
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:47,636
Yeah- Ye- Yeah.

1379
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:50,171
I thought you said
that he was a farmer.

1380
01:11:50,255 --> 01:11:52,380
Well, he is- He's a farmer.

1381
01:11:52,463 --> 01:11:55,963
- I know they're not onions.
- Daisies make me sneeze, Lenny.

1382
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:59,011
Come here a minute.
Excuse us one second.

1383
01:11:59,046 --> 01:12:02,046
They're beautiful flowers. Tell him
they're beautiful and enjoy yourself.

1384
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:05,011
- I could hold the flowers.
- I know, but they just make me sneeze.

1385
01:12:05,046 --> 01:12:09,046
- She sneezes with flowers. That's good luck if you sneeze.
- I'll hold the flowers.

1386
01:12:09,081 --> 01:12:12,546
- Thanks.
- Go ahead, have fun. I'll see you guys.

1387
01:12:12,581 --> 01:12:14,563
I'm gonna go.

1388
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:16,546
Take care.

1389
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,046
So, y- you're pretty.

1390
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,546
Uh- He's...
tellin' the truth.

1391
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:28,546
- You're really...
- Oh.

1392
01:12:28,629 --> 01:12:30,546
pretty.

1393
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:34,421
- Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

1394
01:12:34,456 --> 01:12:36,938
I bet you're hung
like a horse.

1395
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:39,386
- Yeah, I can ride a horse.
- Yeah?

1396
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,886
You know, my brother's got a farm,
you know. I love animals.

1397
01:12:42,921 --> 01:12:47,921
I like animals. He's got a farm up there
with the ducks and the pigs and, um-

1398
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:49,921
Oh, yeah.
In Wisconsin.

1399
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:51,921
Wampsville.

1400
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,296
Yeah. How long
were you doin' hair?

1401
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:29,296
- That's right, 'cause you were doin' the acting, right?
- Yeah.

1402
01:14:29,422 --> 01:14:32,796
- That's right. I didn't get to see Schindler's List.
- Me neither.

1403
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:36,296
But what were some of the other films
you were in?

1404
01:14:36,422 --> 01:14:39,296
Well, I did
The Enchanted, uh-

1405
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,296
- Salad.
- The Enchanted Salad?

1406
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:45,296
What was that about?
Is it good?

1407
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,296
Yeah, it was really good.
It was about a waitress.

1408
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,796
Yeah.

1409
01:14:51,296 --> 01:14:54,296
- I had a really good time with you tonight.
- Did you?

1410
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:56,261
- Yeah.
- Really? Me too.

1411
01:14:56,296 --> 01:14:59,296
Yeah, you're really good
at arcade games, you know.

1412
01:14:59,331 --> 01:15:02,355
Well, I used to date
a pinball champ, not for nothing.

1413
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:05,345
Pinball ch- Was it, like,
a serious relationship?

1414
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,380
Well, we were getting engaged,
but then two guys strangled him.

1415
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:11,380
Oh.

1416
01:15:13,171 --> 01:15:16,345
- You know what I like in a woman?
- What?

1417
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:19,838
I like, like, um,
an old-fashioned girl, you know,

1418
01:15:19,873 --> 01:15:21,803
like my-my mom.

1419
01:15:21,838 --> 01:15:26,303
Like, a girl who likes to take care
of the house and cook and clean...

1420
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:31,338
and doesn't mind walkin' the dogs and
doin' the lawn and that kind of thing.

1421
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:34,629
You know what I mean?
That's like my mom.

1422
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:36,629
Yeah.

1423
01:15:36,754 --> 01:15:39,629
What do you like in a man?

1424
01:15:39,754 --> 01:15:42,629
I like a guy
who has a good job,

1425
01:15:42,754 --> 01:15:45,678
who treats me nice
and, um-

1426
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:48,178
Well, who's kinda
built like you.

1427
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:51,213
Doesn't have to stuff a sock
in his jock to look good.

1428
01:15:51,248 --> 01:15:52,678
Mm-hmm.

1429
01:15:52,713 --> 01:15:56,213
- You know what my dream is?
- What?

1430
01:15:58,338 --> 01:16:00,338
I'm in a field, right?

1431
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,297
And, like, this hawk comes...

1432
01:16:03,422 --> 01:16:06,297
and picks me up
in his beak, right?

1433
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:10,504
And then flies me, like, all over
the world so I see everything.

1434
01:16:10,588 --> 01:16:13,504
And then, like, he flies me
out of the country...

1435
01:16:13,588 --> 01:16:17,088
and, like, we go up to
the north pole and he drops me...

1436
01:16:17,123 --> 01:16:19,053
in the snow.

1437
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:21,588
And I'm just layin' there...

1438
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,588
naked.

1439
01:16:27,005 --> 01:16:29,005
What's your dream?

1440
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:35,880
My dream is that somebody would come
along and think that I was special,

1441
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:40,880
that, you know- that they'd wanna
come and change my life for me.

1442
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,880
That's my dream.

1443
01:16:44,088 --> 01:16:46,220
You could have that.

1444
01:16:46,255 --> 01:16:49,255
- You think?
- Yeah, I think.

1445
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,880
You could definitely have that,
a pretty girl like you.

1446
01:16:56,171 --> 01:16:58,136
So, you think, um,

1447
01:16:58,171 --> 01:17:01,171
I'm gonna get to see you
again, Linda, or what?

1448
01:17:01,206 --> 01:17:03,671
Do you want to?

1449
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:05,838
A lot.

1450
01:17:05,963 --> 01:17:07,838
I want to a lot.

1451
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:11,629
Me too.

1452
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,046
True love.
As refreshing as spring.

1453
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,046
They kissed good night.

1454
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,046
And saw each other
the very next night, and the next.

1455
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:25,095
Hold it, everybody.
Something's coming in.

1456
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,130
- A bulletin!
- Uh-oh. Here comes Miss Party Pooper.

1457
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:31,095
Tiresias, the blind seer
of Thebes.

1458
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:34,338
- I have a vision of him and Weinrib.
- Where?

1459
01:17:34,422 --> 01:17:36,338
Wait.

1460
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:38,338
The Acropolis.

1461
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:50,297
Oh, Weinrib.

1462
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,262
I saw your wife.

1463
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:54,262
- Amanda.
- You know me?

1464
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:57,796
Yeah. I saw her.
She was workin' late at the gallery.

1465
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,796
And with her was this,
uh, Jerry Bender guy.

1466
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,796
Well, that's nothing. She works
with Jerry Bender. Nothing unusual.

1467
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,796
- You didn't let me finish.
- Go on.

1468
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,796
Uh, they spoke
in intimate tones...

1469
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,297
and then, uh, Bender rose
and laid a big wet one on her.

1470
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,297
- A big we- Bender kissed Amanda?
- That's what I'm tellin' ya.

1471
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:17,796
Hey, you must've known somethin'
was going on for a while, huh?

1472
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,297
Yeah, I always thought
that Bender had eyes for her.

1473
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,297
Now he's got eyes and hands.

1474
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,845
Jesus- Well, Amanda
didn't respond, did she?

1475
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,464
No. She just opened her mouth
very wide and stuck her tongue out...

1476
01:18:28,499 --> 01:18:32,046
as far as it was
humanly possible to go.

1477
01:18:32,172 --> 01:18:34,046
Jeez-
Are you sure?

1478
01:18:34,172 --> 01:18:37,046
Well, hey- Does the Trojan horse
have a wooden dick?

1479
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:40,546
- And then she, she pushed her abdomen against his.
- All right, all right!

1480
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:43,546
I got the picture!
I knew it! I always suspected.

1481
01:18:43,671 --> 01:18:48,046
Ah, it's somethin' you don't wanna know,
but you hadda be blind not to see it.

1482
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:51,755
- Yeah. Oh, God. I'm gonna confront her.
- Oh, no, not in front of Max!

1483
01:18:51,838 --> 01:18:55,755
No, Max- Max has got a sleep-over date
at his friend's house.

1484
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:58,921
- Oh.
- No. I knew it. Down deep, I knew it.

1485
01:18:59,046 --> 01:19:02,422
Uh, thanks, Weinrib.
Thanks.

1486
01:19:02,546 --> 01:19:05,629
Ah, thank you.
God bless you.

1487
01:19:05,713 --> 01:19:08,713
Oh, my God!
It's more serious than we thought!

1488
01:19:08,838 --> 01:19:12,213
It's very serious.
Her marriage to Lenny is in crisis.

1489
01:19:12,338 --> 01:19:16,629
With the passage of time,
even the strongest bonds become fragile.

1490
01:19:16,713 --> 01:19:19,629
Great, fellas.
It sounds like a fortune cookie.

1491
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,796
O Zeus,
most potent of gods!

1492
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:24,796
We implore thee!
We need your help!

1493
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:28,796
Zeus! Great Zeus!
Hear us! Hear us!

1494
01:19:28,921 --> 01:19:30,796
We call out to thee!

1495
01:19:30,921 --> 01:19:33,796
Um, this is Zeus.
I'm not home right now.

1496
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:37,588
But you can leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

1497
01:19:37,713 --> 01:19:40,713
- Please start speaking at the tone.

1498
01:19:40,796 --> 01:19:44,297
Call us when you get in!
We need help!

1499
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:47,297
God, I think
I should move out.

1500
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:50,297
I- I-I can't understand this.
Wh-Wh- This is so radical.

1501
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:52,796
No, 'cause I can't cheat.
Jerry Bender's in love with me.

1502
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,796
This is crazy.

1503
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,796
Are you telling me you're in love with
him, you're in love with Jerry Bender?

1504
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,297
I don't know.
I gotta find out.

1505
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,255
- What do you mean, "you don't know"?
- I don't know!

1506
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,255
What do you mean?
Are you in love with him or not?

1507
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,255
Anyway, Lenny, let's face it-
things have changed between us.

1508
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,255
But we can fix things.
What about Max? Max-

1509
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:17,255
He'll be okay. Maybe it will
be better for him with us apart...

1510
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,755
- instead of together and arguing all of the time.
- That's crazy.

1511
01:20:20,838 --> 01:20:22,755
I just think that's crazy.

1512
01:20:23,963 --> 01:20:25,838
Well, I- I can't have
this conversation.

1513
01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:28,339
I- This is too crazy. I'm-

1514
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:31,339
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out. I have to think.

1515
01:20:31,464 --> 01:20:34,255
I have to get
my thoughts together.

1516
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:04,213
- I been waitin' for you, man.
- Kevin, leave me alone.

1517
01:21:04,297 --> 01:21:07,005
- I'm in a very, very bad mood.
- You're in a very bad mood?

1518
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:11,005
How could you do this? How could you
set me up with this stupid girl?

1519
01:21:11,088 --> 01:21:15,005
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't tell me she was a hooker...

1520
01:21:15,088 --> 01:21:19,005
and that she did porno films and had sex
with hundreds and hundreds of men...

1521
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:22,005
and women and who the hell
knows what else!

1522
01:21:22,088 --> 01:21:24,005
- I thought it would prejudice you.
- What?

1523
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:26,005
How did you find out?

1524
01:21:26,088 --> 01:21:29,984
I- I call my friends up and I tell 'em
I got this girl that I wanna marry.

1525
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:33,880
They have me over for a few drinks and
my friend Ray puts in this sexy video.

1526
01:21:33,915 --> 01:21:36,345
But I'm not really
into pornography, you know.

1527
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:40,172
- I look on the screen and this
actress is up there: Judy Cum.

1528
01:21:40,297 --> 01:21:43,671
Kevin, I told you she had
dramatic aspirations.

1529
01:21:43,755 --> 01:21:47,671
- I flew off the handle. - Oh, Christ.
I thought you were a broad-minded guy.

1530
01:21:47,755 --> 01:21:52,172
I came over here and she confessed to
everything, and then I- and I hit her.

1531
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:55,463
- You hit her? You hi-
- I was gonna break your neck, man!

1532
01:21:55,498 --> 01:21:58,671
- I don't believe this. You hit her?
- I don't believe this!

1533
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:01,636
- You hit her? For Christ's-
- A little bit.

1534
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:04,900
- God.
- I called my mother. I was upset, so then she says I should come home.

1535
01:22:04,935 --> 01:22:08,032
- So I'm gonna get the hell outta this place, man.
- I don't understand you.

1536
01:22:08,067 --> 01:22:11,130
You're a broad-minded guy. People change.
You gonna hold her past against her?

1537
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:14,130
- Yeah, I'm gonna- A porno star!
- You love her, she loves you!

1538
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:17,130
- What are you talking about?
- Forget it, man. It's over.

1539
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:20,130
I told you from day one
the girl was not a virgin.

1540
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:23,130
You didn't tell me
how many times though!

1541
01:22:23,255 --> 01:22:25,130
- Thanks for nothin', Lenny, man.
- Kevin!

1542
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:27,130
Nah, man!

1543
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:41,630
- He hit me.

1544
01:22:41,713 --> 01:22:44,713
I know, I- I ran into him
downstairs and he-

1545
01:22:44,796 --> 01:22:47,713
Oh, Jesus, look at you.

1546
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,713
God, does it feel terrible?

1547
01:22:49,796 --> 01:22:52,713
No, not really. Just my ulcer.

1548
01:22:52,796 --> 01:22:56,297
Your ulcer? Well, you know,
you shouldn't be drinking.

1549
01:22:56,422 --> 01:22:59,796
- Hmm. - That's the worst-
Oh, God, look at that.

1550
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,796
Boy.

1551
01:23:04,005 --> 01:23:07,505
- Remember you once said we were a couple of losers?
- Yeah.

1552
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,505
Well, I think
that's definitely true.

1553
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,505
- Why? What happened to you?

1554
01:23:15,464 --> 01:23:17,380
Amanda left me.

1555
01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:20,880
Oh. I'm sorry, Lenny.

1556
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:23,380
Would you like a drink?

1557
01:23:23,464 --> 01:23:25,380
Mmm. No.

1558
01:24:16,713 --> 01:24:20,339
What's, uh- What's-
What's the matter?

1559
01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:24,005
I- I don't know.

1560
01:24:32,922 --> 01:24:35,797
Was she great?
You can tell me.

1561
01:24:35,922 --> 01:24:37,797
Was she-
Was she great in bed?

1562
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,797
- A woman with all that experience.
- I don't know.

1563
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,797
I just know that suddenly
I really miss Amanda.

1564
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,797
But wait!
See who approaches!

1565
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,297
There you are!
Where have you been?

1566
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,797
I've been looking for you
all over.

1567
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,588
I was just out drinking
and thinking about everything.

1568
01:24:55,671 --> 01:24:57,588
Oh, Lenny, I'm sorry.

1569
01:24:57,671 --> 01:25:01,588
I, uh- I was up all night
thinking how much I hurt you...

1570
01:25:01,671 --> 01:25:04,588
and how much
I'd messed us up for good,

1571
01:25:04,671 --> 01:25:07,588
and the thought
of not being with you.

1572
01:25:07,671 --> 01:25:11,047
I love you.
I don't love Jerry at all.

1573
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:14,546
We have to put things right,
whatever has to be done.

1574
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,755
she drove upstate to Wampsville and
pleaded with Kevin to take her back...

1575
01:25:32,838 --> 01:25:34,546
but to no avail.

1576
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,546
Anyway, on the way home she was
distraught and felt life held no hope...

1577
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:42,255
when- talk about
a deus ex machina-

1578
01:26:14,713 --> 01:26:18,713
So we just had a stabilizing problem
and the thing got a little off balance.

1579
01:26:18,748 --> 01:26:22,713
And then the radio went glitchy, so I
just need to get down and use a phone.

1580
01:26:22,748 --> 01:26:25,672
And thank you very much,
by the way, for stopping.

1581
01:26:25,797 --> 01:26:28,672
My name's Don.

1582
01:26:32,089 --> 01:26:34,054
And so Linda married.

1583
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:38,797
To a wonderful man who was not uptight
and repressed and accepted her...

1584
01:26:38,832 --> 01:26:42,255
and even laughed at wild tales
of her promiscuous background.

1585
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,755
And so our little
Greek drama comes to-

1586
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:46,720
Wait, wait, wait.
There's more.

1587
01:26:46,755 --> 01:26:49,755
What more, Tiresias,
blind seer of Thebes?

1588
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,256
Tell 'em just to
call me Tiresias, will ya?

1589
01:26:52,381 --> 01:26:54,221
The handicapped
are always cranky.

1590
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:57,720
On that night,
Lenny Weinrib and Linda did make love,

1591
01:26:57,755 --> 01:27:00,755
like he was Zeus and she
was Aphrodite with an aphrodisiac.

1592
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:02,720
Get to the point!

1593
01:27:02,755 --> 01:27:06,047
- The point is, Linda did, that night, conceive a child.
- No!

1594
01:27:06,082 --> 01:27:09,464
Yes. She became pregnant
with Lenny's child.

1595
01:27:09,546 --> 01:27:13,964
But not wanting to complicate his life
with Amanda, she never told him.

1596
01:27:14,047 --> 01:27:16,922
Instead she went off
with her new husband,

1597
01:27:17,047 --> 01:27:21,546
who stood behind her loyally as she
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.

1598
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,546
Lenny never saw Linda again.

1599
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:36,005
We can look around the whole store
if you'd like.

1600
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:40,214
- Lenny!
- I don't believe this! Wh-

1601
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:42,887
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

1602
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:45,422
- I-I-
- I'm stunned! What happened to you?

1603
01:27:45,457 --> 01:27:47,387
I- I'm living in Connecticut.

1604
01:27:47,422 --> 01:27:50,387
I'm married and my husband Don
is a helicopter pilot.

1605
01:27:50,422 --> 01:27:53,887
You're kidding! Where did you go?
I searched every place for you.

1606
01:27:53,922 --> 01:27:57,880
- It's like you vanished off the face of the earth.
- Well, we had our moment.

1607
01:27:58,005 --> 01:28:01,880
- But I knew you would be back with
Amanda. - I can't b- That's super.

1608
01:28:02,005 --> 01:28:05,381
- S-So y-you're married and-
This is yours? - Yes! Look at her.

1609
01:28:05,505 --> 01:28:08,672
Oh, God, she's adorable.

1610
01:28:08,797 --> 01:28:10,880
- She's adorable. Very, very-

1611
01:28:11,005 --> 01:28:13,880
- And is- Is that Max?
- This is Max. This is Max.

1612
01:28:13,964 --> 01:28:16,381
- Hello.
- Max, say hello. This is a friend.

1613
01:28:16,464 --> 01:28:18,381
- Hi, I'm Linda.
- How do you do?

1614
01:28:18,464 --> 01:28:21,776
What a handsome boy.
Amanda must be very beautiful.

1615
01:28:21,811 --> 01:28:25,089
And she's- You've gotta have
a very handsome husband,

1616
01:28:25,124 --> 01:28:27,054
'cause she has a great face.

1617
01:28:27,089 --> 01:28:30,089
I'm stunned.
I don't know what to say. I'm, I'm-

1618
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:34,047
- Lenny, it's so great to see you.
- You too. You're okay? Everything-

1619
01:28:34,172 --> 01:28:36,547
Yeah. I'm really good.

1620
01:28:36,672 --> 01:28:38,547
Thank you for everything.

1621
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:40,547
Oh- I-I-
I'm speechless.

1622
01:28:40,672 --> 01:28:44,047
I- I- I gotta go.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late.

1623
01:28:44,172 --> 01:28:48,339
- It was great to see you.
- It was great to see you. Great.

1624
01:28:48,464 --> 01:28:51,339
- But they have each other's child.

1625
01:28:51,464 --> 01:28:53,339
And they don't know.

1626
01:28:53,464 --> 01:28:56,339
Yes. Yes. Isn't life ironic?

1627
01:28:56,374 --> 01:28:58,304
Life is unbelievable.

1628
01:28:58,339 --> 01:29:02,047
Miraculous. Sad.
Wonderful.

1629
01:29:02,131 --> 01:29:04,422
Yes, this is all true!

1630
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:06,547
And that's why we say:
