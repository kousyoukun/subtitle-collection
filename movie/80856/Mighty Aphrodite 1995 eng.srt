1
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:23,131
Woe unto man.

2
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,293
Brave Achilles,
slain in trial by blood...

3
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:29,270
for prize,
the bride of Menelaus.

4
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:33,105
And father of Antigone,
ruler of Thebes,

5
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:37,135
self-rendered sightless
by lust for expiation.

6
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:40,546
Lost victim
of bewildered desire.

7
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:43,381
Nor has Jason's wife
fared better.

8
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:47,787
Giving life only to reclaim it
in vengeful fury.

9
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:50,257
For to understand
the ways of the heart...

10
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:53,854
is to grasp as clearly the malice
or ineptitude of the gods,

11
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,525
who, in their vain and clumsy labors
to create a flawless surrogate,

12
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,694
have left mankind
but dazed and incomplete.

13
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,739
 Take, for instance,
the case of Lenny Weinrib,

14
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:08,301
a tale as Greek and timeless
as fate itself.

15
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,812
- Lenny, let's have a baby.
- Hey !

16
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,815
A baby ? Why ? Because she's pregnant,
you want to have a baby ?

17
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:15,976
- No. It's a great idea.
- You could raise your own middleweight.

18
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,986
- I don't want a middleweight.
- Flyweight.

19
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:21,319
- No, it'd be fun.
- Have you ever had children ?

20
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,155
- No, I've never had children.
- Why not ?

21
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:27,060
What do you mean, "why not ?" 'Cause my
first wife didn't want to have a child.

22
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,325
- Then I never remarried really, so--
- Oh, that's great.

23
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,333
- What am l, chopped liver ?
- Until now.

24
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:33,335
- Yeah ?
- I never-- You didn't let me finish.

25
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,496
- No, you'd forgotten.
- Now you've changed your mind.
You didn't want to have a child.

26
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:39,167
- You should have kids.
- It's like stereo. Give him a break.

27
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:41,506
- You don't want a kid ?
- Oh, we-- 

28
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:46,208
When we first met, she didn't like
the beach; she hated the Hamptons;

29
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:49,615
she didn't want to have kids;
she loved the Upper East Side,
she didn't want to move.

30
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:52,678
Now suddenly she's making noise about
having a kid and moving to Tribeca.

31
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:56,021
- Only if the gallery moves downtown.
- Well, being pregnant is great.

32
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:58,185
-  Yeah ?
- I love it. You get treated
like the Queen of England.

33
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,195
- Sure.
- You say that like it's a good thing.

34
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,197
- Well, I like the pampering.
- She does like it.

35
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:04,199
- Yeah ?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

36
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,201
I can't give up the time
right now.

37
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,464
There are too many exciting things
happening in my business.

38
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,472
- So let me ask you a question.
- What ?

39
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,805
How do you plan to swing it without
being pregnant ? I'm curious.

40
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:15,868
- Good question. Very good question.
- No, it's easy.

41
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,970
- We'll adopt. Oh, well.
- Mmm.

42
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,981
- Not me. I don't want to adopt.
-  There you go.

43
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,983
- Why not ? That's a good idea.
- No. No.

44
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,542
- You must be nuts. With, with my genes?
- Yeah ?

45
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:26,987
- To adopt ? I have award-winning genes.
- Oh, God.

46
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,547
- I want to pass them on.
- No, that's crazy. No, the--

47
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:32,493
It's for the same reason
we don't lease a car, okay ?

48
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,496
- 'Cause it's pride of ownership.
- Okay.

49
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,555
- And I don't want to adopt a child.
- No. Look, I'm sorry, Lenny.

50
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:39,431
It's crazy 'cause the world
is full of needy kids.

51
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,436
- You know, she's right.
-  That's true.

52
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,438
- I know, but that-- You know, but l--
- No, I mean it.

53
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:47,169
Why overpopulate the world when there
are thousands of parent-less kids ?

54
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,507
Just because you don't want
to get morning sickness, right ?

55
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,672
- No, it's not true.
- That's why you want to adopt a kid.

56
00:04:51,748 --> 00:04:53,841
I just can't afford
to give up a year just now.

57
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,579
Forget it. Subject is closed.
I don't wanna--

58
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:59,019
I'd be afraid that
I might get a bad seed.

59
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,022
- Oh, you're paranoid.
- Oh, come on.

60
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,059
That's right ! What-- You read that
in the tabloids all the time.

61
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,061
- No. A bad seed.
- That's right.

62
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:08,597
Yeah, we adopt some sweet little boy,
and then he turns 13,

63
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:11,293
we'd go to sleep at night,
he'd split our head open with an axe.

64
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,200
Listen, why'd you have to
go and tell him that ? You know
Lenny's got a vivid imagination.

65
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,534
- It's a common occurrence.
- I read the same paper.
What do you want me to tell you ?

66
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:19,905
Anyway, what do you mean "he" ?
Why can't we adopt a girl ?

67
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,069
- We're not adopting anything.
I want no sex.
- A little girl.

68
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:24,613
Let the guy have a shortstop
or a point guard, will ya ?

69
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,979
Can we get a check ? Can we--
Can we please get out of here ?

70
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,109
I'll take the check.
I'm paying tonight.

71
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:31,244
- Yes.
- You ? I'm stunned.

72
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:35,451
You pay, you break your record.
You-- One more and you break
DiMaggio's record-- 56 straight.

73
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:37,459
That's not true.
Now, be nice.

74
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,587
Laius, proud father, speak.

75
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:43,928
I, with joy,
did have a son...

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,969
so fair, so clearheaded
and brave,

77
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:50,665
that I a thousand pleasures
did derive from his presence.

78
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,674
So what happens ?

79
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:54,801
One day he kills me.

80
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:57,779
And don't you think,
he runs off and marries my wife.

81
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,748
Poor Oedipus, king of Thebes.

82
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:04,344
My son, my son
did slay unwittingly...

83
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,354
my noble husband...

84
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:09,255
and did, without realizing,
hasten with me,

85
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:12,260
his loving mother,
to lustful bed.

86
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,592
And a whole profession
was born...

87
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:16,928
charging sometimes
200 an hour,

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,127
and a 50-minute hour
at that.

89
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:22,638
And why a child now, out of left field ?

90
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:25,731
One hopes it's not to fill
some growing void in their marriage.

91
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,742
Leave her be.

92
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,540
A woman's urge to motherhood
is old as the earth.

93
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:33,241
Children grow up;
they move out.

94
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:36,376
Sometimes to ridiculous places
like Cincinnati...

95
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:38,386
or Boise, ldaho.

96
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:40,388
Then you never see them again.

97
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:42,822
You'd think once in a while
they'd pick up a phone.

98
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,622
But is there a growing void
in the Weinrib's marriage ?

99
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,629
We didn't say there was.

100
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:50,598
We're all just speculating
on possible motives.

101
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,601
Children are serious stuff.

102
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,469
Look, here's a man
who killed his father...

103
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,473
and slept with his mother.

104
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,977
I hate to tell you what they
call my son in Harlem.

105
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:06,047
Hello.

106
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:09,642
- There's a baby we can adopt.
- Are you serious ?

107
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:12,916
I spoke to Carolyn Hester
and she's found an infant for us.

108
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:16,425
- But we have to act quickly.
- I don't want a kid.

109
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,517
Well, Lenny, you know
how hard it is.

110
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:21,257
And look, the baby's
one day old, totally healthy.

111
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,424
Unwed mother, no diseases.

112
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,592
And it's a boy.
You wanted a boy.

113
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:28,034
Amanda, I can't get
into this with you now.

114
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,402
This is not the place
to have this discussion.

115
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:33,203
I told Carolyn to be on the lookout.
She's experienced with adoptions.

116
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:36,677
She knows what she's doing.
It's a boy, healthy, born this morning.

117
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,078
No strings,
if we act quickly.

118
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:42,208
Le-- Look, l-- I gotta
put my foot down.

119
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:45,846
I-l-- If you want to
discuss this another time, we can.

120
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:49,517
But if you gotta have a fast answer,
it's definitely "no."

121
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:51,526
- Hi ! Hi.

122
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:53,687
- You got his head ?
- He's adorable.

123
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:55,993
- Yes. Oh, God.

124
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:59,330
This is great. This kid is never
going to be a fighter, you know.

125
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:03,463
I gotta run out and get some weights
because he's really light as a feather.

126
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,803
- Yeah, perhaps I should have him back.
- Hi.

127
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,934
Yeah. Maybe you better
hold him 'cause he's crying.

128
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,945
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's crying.

129
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:12,345
- Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

130
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:14,349
- That's a good boy.
- That's so great.

131
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:17,614
If there's any greatness in my hands,
let it pass into your body.

132
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:21,453
- Get a grip on yourself.
- This kid is gonna be a great kid !

133
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:23,458
- Oh, yeah.
- He's fabulous !

134
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:25,460
- You're okay now.
- What do you wanna call him ?

135
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,462
- Oh, this is unbelievable. Yeah.
- Call him ?

136
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,624
- Oh, wh-- what about Eric ?
- Eric ? The kid's not a Viking.

137
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,567
I wanna call him, name him,
you know, for one of my heroes.

138
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:36,799
- Like what ?
- I don't know. What about Groucho ?

139
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:39,637
- Groucho ? Oh, get real.
- No, I'm serious.

140
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:42,371
It's a great-- You know.
I-- I don't know. What--

141
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:44,845
What about Phineas ?
Do you like Phineas ?

142
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:46,848
Phineas ?
Are you joking ?

143
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,476
Phineas is the guy who
forecloses on the mortgage.

144
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:52,316
I don't want to call this kid
Phineas. He's adorable.

145
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:55,482
- That's so great.
What-- What, uh-- Let me think.
- Well.

146
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,492
- What about Django ?
- Django ?

147
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,028
Django, yeah. After Django Reinhardt,
the great guitar player.

148
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:03,827
- Django Weinrib ?
- That's the curse of the Weinrib name.

149
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,164
- It doesn't go with anything.
Nothing goes with Weinrib.
- Well, okay, okay.

150
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:08,726
What about something simple
like, you know, Ben ?

151
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,932
- You want to call him Ben Weinrib ?
- Yeah.

152
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,339
What, he's gonna be
a-a-a gin rummy champion ?

153
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:15,934
- I mean, you know.
- Yeah, well, you want to deny
your heritage ? Huh ?

154
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:18,572
Well, you know, l-l just want
the kid to have a great name.

155
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:21,116
- Yeah.
- What about Sugar Ray Weinrib ?

156
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,118
Holden,
after Holden Caulfield.

157
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:26,417
You see, Holden is one of those things
that works if we use your maiden name.

158
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:30,084
- If it's Holden Sloane,
but not Holden Weinrib.
- Yeah.

159
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,389
The kid is so cute !

160
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:34,930
I can't believe he's--
What about Cole ?

161
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:37,795
- Cole ?
- Cole Weinrib. Harpo Weinrib.

162
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,358
- Harpo ? No.
- How about Earl the Pearl Weinrib ?

163
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:43,064
- That would be so perfect.
- Oh, God ! No.

164
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,972
- Okay, what-- what about Shane ?
You like the name Shane ?
- Yeah.

165
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,976
- Shane's pretty.
- Shane would be okay.

166
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:52,105
On the other hand, you wouldn't want
a Supreme Court Justice called Shane.

167
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:54,809
Oh, Jesus.
I got it. I got it.

168
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:56,909
Brilliant.
This is so brilliant.

169
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:58,920
- Got it ? Ready ? Are you ready ?
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:02,424
- Thelonius Weinrib.
- Max ! What about Max ?

171
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:04,517
- Max ?
- Yeah, Max.

172
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:06,789
Max.
Oh, look how cute he is.

173
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:09,161
- I wanna hold him. Max is okay.
- He's so sweet. He's smiling.

174
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:11,666
- Dr. Max Weinrib. I like the name Max.
- Yeah, Max is good.

175
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,999
- It's simple.
- How about Senator Max Weinrib ?

176
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:18,063
- Little tongue.
- Rabbi Max-- Rabbi Max Weinrib ?

177
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,632
No. Maybe we should
rethink Max for a minute.

178
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,077
- Oh, he's so great.
- He's happy. I think he likes us.

179
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,615
- He looks like you.
- He looks like me ?

180
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,115
Yeah.

181
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:31,051
He looks like Broderick
Crawford a little bit.

182
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:59,640
- He's so smart.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:01,876
He picks up on everything.

184
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:05,614
He's got a great personality.
You know, you wake him up,
he's always smiling and upbeat.

185
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,622
- Like me.
- You were like that
when you were a baby.

186
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,158
- Yeah, he's so verbal.
- Well, he's around a writer...

187
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:12,285
and an art expert, right ?

188
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,829
Listen, when are you going
to move the gallery downtown ?

189
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:17,832
Yeah, Mother, we don't want to get
into that discussion 'cause, you know,

190
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,030
I think we should move and Lenny
is a devoted Upper East-sider.

191
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:25,164
Or shall I say is opposed
to change in any form ?

192
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,266
-  I don't know.
- It's unbelievable.

193
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:30,835
The kid is unbelievable. I got him
trains, he put 'em together himself.

194
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:33,973
Trains ? I thought you
bought him an Erector Set.

195
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,518
I got him an Erector Set, yeah.
And-- And I also got him this tricycle.

196
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:39,111
- Wait. And the whole plastic kitchen ?
- Max, I got you a tricycle.

197
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:41,122
Lenny, you can't
buy him so much.

198
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,351
- Max, I got you a tricycle.
- Look at that !

199
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:46,361
- You can't buy him so much stuff.

200
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,624
- No, no. I also got him skates.
- Skates ?

201
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:52,395
Yeah. And I got a couple more things
on the way in, you know.

202
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:54,663
A small truck is gonna pull up
in front of the house.

203
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:57,433
- What are you gonna get next year ?
- Does anyone want anything to drink ?

204
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:00,506
- Go ahead. Shoot.

205
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:02,510
Try again.

206
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:05,479
You ever think about what you want
to be when you grow up, Max ?

207
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:09,006
Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe an interior decorator.

208
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,315
- What ?
- Just kidding, just kidding.

209
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:13,821
Well, don't kid.
Here. Come on.

210
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:25,166
Okay, those go in the bedroom.
Okay, you follow me.

211
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,668
- Give me a hand with this.
- Why did we move ?

212
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:30,001
What do you mean,
"Why did we move ?" I told you.

213
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,632
We moved 'cause-- 'cause, you know,
'cause your mother wanted to move.

214
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,111
'Cause, you know, the art gallery
she works at has moved downtown...

215
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,409
and, you know,
she wanted to move.

216
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,882
- Here's your football.
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy ?

217
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,920
- What is the question ?
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy ?

218
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:46,921
Who is the boss ?
You have to ask that ?

219
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,184
- You don't know who the boss
is between me and Mommy ?
- No.

220
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:53,354
I'm the boss, okay ? Mommy--
Mommy's only the decision maker.

221
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:56,364
You know, there's a difference
between, uh--

222
00:12:56,432 --> 00:13:00,459
You know, Mommy-- Mommy says
what we do and, and, uh,

223
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:03,699
I have control
of the channel changer.

224
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,139
- Here-- Here's your crayons.
- Thanks.

225
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,473
We're new in the neighborhood
and we want Max to be really
in the best school.

226
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,139
- Oh, but this is it.
- It's 'cause he's a very,
very bright kid.

227
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:14,148
- I mean, really bright.
- Yeah, he's really great.

228
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:16,650
Yes, I know. I saw his test scores
and they're wonderful.

229
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:19,017
- They are. Yeah.
- I know. And he's got
a great sense of humor.

230
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:22,489
- He's a sweet kid.
He's a really sweet kid.
- He's got a great personality.

231
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,753
Wonderful. Well, I wanted to talk
to you about a special program...

232
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,761
that we have
for bright students.

233
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:28,763
- Really ? And he qualifies ?

234
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:30,822
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

235
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,199
- Certainly.
- Because-- when you hear his syntax,

236
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,204
- Hello ? Oh, hi.
- it's amazing.

237
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:38,502
- Verbal skills are telling.
- His vocabulary is good,
but his syntax is--

238
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,508
- Oh, great.
- He speaks like a grown-up.

239
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,669
- Sorry. Lenny ?
- What we can do is--

240
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,975
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Oh, certainly.

241
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:48,539
Can we meet the Dorians tonight
for dinner at Le Cirque ?

242
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:52,018
The Dorians ? No. Because we have
tickets to the Edward Albee play.

243
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:55,524
- Listen, I can't.
- We have to.
We've been waiting for so long.

244
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:58,253
You don't have to go,
but I really should go.

245
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:00,454
I, uh-- No.

246
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,430
- This will be the second time
this week we cancelled something.
- Go with Bud.

247
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,024
- Oh, okay.
- I don't want to go with Bud.
I'm not married to Bud.

248
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:08,195
Listen, go.
Can we not discuss it now ?

249
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,738
Oh, my God !
That was embarrassing.

250
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:14,833
Well, just because I don't
want to have dinner yet again
with the world's dullest couple.

251
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,140
Yeah, well, someday they may
sponsor me for my own gallery.

252
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:19,147
- I said I'd go. I'm going with you.
- Yeah ?

253
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:21,149
But we got tickets to a show.
It's a shame.

254
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:23,981
This time try and join in and don't
sit there like some zombie all night.

255
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:26,317
Hey, last time I joined in,
you got angry with me.

256
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:29,688
Yeah, 'cause we were discussing
the l.M. Pei Museum, not Muhammad Ali.

257
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,092
Well, my mind wandered.
I can't keep on those topics.

258
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:36,962
I just don't want to be the motor power
of the Bender Gallery forever.

259
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,967
I want the
Amanda Sloane Gallery.

260
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:42,095
Not Amanda Weinrib,
'cause there's a euphony problem.

261
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:46,505
 Three, four, run.
Three, four, and break the ball.

262
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,668
-  Play 88 !
- I hope they don't play like this.

263
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:50,837
- 88 ! Ten-hut !

264
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,847
What's the matter ?
You seem down.

265
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,440
- No, I'm fine.
- You're fine ?

266
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,452
Something's on your mind,
Lenny.

267
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,854
 Listen, last night I was
at one of those dinner parties again.

268
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:04,290
Amanda-- You know,
last week she took me to,

269
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,294
to Le Cirque with the Dorians.

270
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:10,230
And then last night it was
with the Grossbards on Park Avenue.

271
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:13,928
And then after that,
we were driving home...

272
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,937
and I don't know
what to say.

273
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:20,101
It was Saturday night, you know, and we
stopped for a light over on Park Avenue.

274
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:23,873
I looked out the window
and I see some guy and this pretty girl.

275
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:26,710
And, you know,
they're walking home and, you know,

276
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:28,943
the guy's carrying
the Sunday papers.

277
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:32,476
It looked like they were
having so much fun, you know.

278
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,989
And, you know--
I don't know, l--

279
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:38,254
I remember how great it
used to be with me and Amanda...

280
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,818
in our first apartment,
you know, how romantic it was.

281
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:44,263
You know, in those days it was
just a kick shopping together...

282
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:48,235
or, you know, just walking
the New York streets, you know.

283
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:51,273
Then when Max came,
everything was so great, you know.

284
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,433
We had such terrific times.

285
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:58,003
I don't know, it's been so long
since there's been, you know,
the old passion between us.

286
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,447
I don't know, but it was the first time
I had any of those thoughts.

287
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:04,145
And, you know,
they made me feel nervous.

288
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,586
You weren't too pleasant
this evening.

289
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:12,957
Why, 'cause I said no about going
to your boss Jerry Bender's house...

290
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:14,962
- in the Hamptons ?
- I'll be fine.

291
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,123
I don't like the Hamptons. You know,
you used to hate the beach yourself.

292
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,292
Yeah, not the way he lives.
It's private and beautiful.

293
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,632
What are you getting
so angry about ?

294
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:23,831
- 'Cause you won't come.
- Last time we went, I got a tick.

295
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:26,966
- A tick ? Oh, wow. Big deal.
- For you, it wasn't a big deal.

296
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,840
- But I took my pants off, I had
a black thing living in my leg.
- Everyone will be there.

297
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,937
For the potential contacts,
I can put up with a few ticks.

298
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:33,948
I don't-- What contacts ?

299
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,041
You know, it's like you're
an international spy.

300
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:38,951
- You got contacts all over town.
- I plan to have my own gallery,
and soon.

301
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:41,649
You've changed unbelievably
over the years.

302
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,658
- Oh, yeah ? You know what, Lenny ?
- You used to hate that.

303
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,990
- People grow. They grow. Some people.
- It's not growth.

304
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,529
You used to hate the beach.
And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you.

305
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:50,030
What?

306
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:52,033
- This guy stares at you.
- Oh, no. That's nuts.

307
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,035
- That's seriously crazy.
- He mentally undresses you.

308
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:56,037
- That's his normal look.
- It's not his normal look.

309
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,539
- If he looked at me that way
I'd hit him with a brick.
- Okay. Okay, let's--

310
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,269
- Or kiss him on the lips, maybe.
- Let's drop this. Please ?

311
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:10,616
Well, what do you mean,
you couldn't find it ?

312
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,847
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, it's dark in here...

313
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:16,289
and l-- you know,
we haven't done it in a while.

314
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,690
- And then you got so angry at me.
- I wasn't angry.

315
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,696
I wasn't angry. You were fumbling
and I was getting out of the mood.

316
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:25,131
Sorry, I couldn't find it. This--
We haven't been doing it in a while.

317
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,329
- Okay, let's not get into
a whole discussion here.
- I lost my sense of direction.

318
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,338
I'm tired.

319
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,636
Every marriage goes through
valleys and peaks.

320
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,142
- This is like a valley.
- I don't mind going through a valley.

321
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:38,806
- But I don't want to sink
beneath sea level here.
- Lenny, why rock the boat ?

322
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:42,146
You got a bright, beautiful wife.
You got a kid that you're crazy for.

323
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,152
I'm not gonna rock the boat.
Did I tell you about Max ?

324
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,984
They want to put him in a special class
because he's got a high IQ.

325
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:49,149
Yeah, well, two bright parents.
I mean, what do you expect ?

326
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:51,489
Yeah, whoever they are.
I mean, I still don't know.

327
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,528
It's like raising thoroughbreds.

328
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:55,689
This kid must come
from good stock.

329
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:58,824
He's good-looking; he's got a high IQ;
he's got a great personality.

330
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,596
And he's amusing.

331
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,864
This is not my doing.
Amanda did the whole adoption.

332
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:05,099
I just resisted.
I complained, like a jerk.

333
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:09,110
I mean, a good father, a dynamite mother
produces a kid like Max.

334
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,612
I think the father's dead,
you know.

335
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:16,944
- The mother ?

336
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,621
Don't go any further !

337
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:22,782
I know what you're thinking,
Lenny, and forget it.

338
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:25,691
How can I forget it ?
The thought's been put into my head.

339
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:29,754
Oh, cursed fate. Certain thoughts
are better left unthunk.

340
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:32,323
I'll bet this kid
has a dynamite mother.

341
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:35,131
What makes you think he didn't
inherit everything from his father ?

342
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,832
Everything ? That's very unlikely.
But I'm gonna find out.

343
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:40,136
Let sleeping dogs lie.

344
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:43,804
- I'll bet she's great.
- Curiosity. That's what kills us.

345
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:47,315
Not muggers or all that bullshit
about the ozone layer.
It's our own hearts and minds.

346
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:51,820
- I'm gonna find out.
- Please, Lenny, don't be a schmuck.

347
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:57,052
I remember the adoption vaguely because
I'm somewhat friendly with Amanda.

348
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,492
But it was not that long ago
that we-- that we did it.

349
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:02,587
I recall trying to
expedite matters for her.

350
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:07,227
I somehow think it was
a single parent with no father.

351
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,830
Right. Exactly. So-So how--
Is it possible for me to get the name--

352
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,840
I'd like the name
of the mother, if I could.

353
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,876
That remains forever
in our files.

354
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:18,902
Even if I have it, I can't give it
to you. May I ask why you want to know ?

355
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:20,915
Yes, 'cause l-l--
I'm curious about it...

356
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:23,451
and I'm trying to get
all the information that I can.

357
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,977
- So, so--
- I'm sorry. That's all
I can help you with.

358
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:29,286
There's no possibility
of, uh--

359
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:32,122
- No, those are the rules.
- I don't understand.
I'm the father of the child.

360
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:36,062
- I can't find out who--
- They're very firm. It's never done.

361
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:38,793
- Mm-hmm.
- How is the little boy doing ?

362
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,131
- Good. He's great. He's fabulous.
- Yes ?

363
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:44,297
- Yes.
- Say hello to Amanda.

364
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,774
- There's no possibility that I could--
- I'm sorry.

365
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:51,040
- There's--
- Really sorry. No way.

366
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:54,139
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

367
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:00,515
What are you doing, Weinrib ?

368
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:03,142
Don't confuse me !
She's coming back in a minute.

369
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:06,585
- You are breaking the law.
- Breaking the law ?
There's a higher law.

370
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:09,215
I can find out
who my son's mother is.

371
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,384
The judge won't see it
that way.

372
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,826
Keep a lookout for me,
will you, for Christ's sake ?

373
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:16,956
- Me? I'm the leader of the Chorus.
- So what? Look out.

374
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:18,966
Get your friend Bud
to help you.

375
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:21,559
Bud can't help me. You know,
Ellie and Amanda are friendly.

376
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:24,663
- Bud can't keep a secret.
- Why is it a secret ?
Why can't Amanda know ?

377
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,867
What kind of argument am I
getting into with you ? Amanda--

378
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,876
'Cause she wouldn't understand.

379
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:31,003
Oh, you're guilty because you
already have exaggerated notions...

380
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,013
about your son's mother.

381
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:36,448
It's understandable because things
are not going smoothly with Amanda.

382
00:21:36,518 --> 00:21:39,180
That's why you will always
be a chorus member.

383
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:41,518
Because you don't do anything.
I act.

384
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,785
I take action.
I make things happen.

385
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:46,293
Well, hurry the hell up.
I hear footsteps.

386
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:53,999
I-l forgot my-- I dropped
my manila envelope. I didn't realize it.

387
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,537
- Oh.
- It has an important interview in it.

388
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:58,573
With-- With Roberto Duran.

389
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:05,071
You won't believe this,
but he's heading for Pennsylvania.

390
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:07,138
Of all the human weaknesses,

391
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:11,118
- obsession is the most dangerous.
-  And the silliest.

392
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:15,822
- Yeah ?
- I'm looking for a former tenant here,

393
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,325
- a-a-a Leslie Wright.
- Who are you ?

394
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:20,588
I'm a friend of hers, and I believe
she lived here at one time--

395
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:22,596
a Leslie Wright ?

396
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:24,928
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember
the girl who used to live here.

397
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,934
- You remember.
The pretty one upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

398
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:29,402
She was only here for a while.
Who are you ?

399
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:32,065
Uh, I'm just an old friend of hers
and I was trying to track her down.

400
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,165
Do you know-- Do you know
where I could find her ?

401
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:37,178
Leslie Wailes was her name,
not Leslie Wright. Leslie Wailes.

402
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:39,180
- Leslie Wailes ?
- Wailes.

403
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:41,682
- She moved to New York.
- You sure? 'Cause I have Leslie Wright.

404
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,275
Leslie-- Leslie--
Did she get married or--

405
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:46,378
I don't know.

406
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:49,424
You have no other information ?
You don't know where I could
find her or anything ?

407
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:51,925
No. She was only here
for a little while. I told you.

408
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:54,326
Look, let me give you
my phone number.

409
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:57,331
If anything turns up,
I would love to locate her.

410
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:04,195
- Here. Give me that. I'll take that.
- Thank you.

411
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,798
- Yeah. Okay.
- You're welcome.

412
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:11,810
You have a phone call. Mr. Lamont.
Says he's from Philadelphia.

413
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,814
- Oh.
- You gave him your number ?

414
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:16,646
- Mm-hmm.
-  ls this Lenny Weinrib ?

415
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,652
- Go ahead, sir.
- Hello.

416
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,053
Yeah, this is Bill Lamont.
Um, that woman you were looking for--

417
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:25,719
We asked another guy who said
her name was Leslie St. James.

418
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,922
Said she moved to New York City,
talked about becoming an actress.

419
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:31,431
- Leslie St. James ?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

420
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,301
He remembered her quite well.
Leslie St. James is the name she took.

421
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:41,832
There was a Leslie St. James who was
a member of the Screen Extras Guild.

422
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,071
- So that's that.
- So what are you telling me ?

423
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:47,912
That-- That she was a movie
extra or stage extra ?

424
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:50,110
Yeah.
That's all I have.

425
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:52,244
So-- And there's an address,
but, uh, you know,

426
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:55,757
this book's
a few years old. So.

427
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:58,019
I'm looking for a--
it's-- she--

428
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:00,891
A Leslie St. James
or maybe it's a Leslie Wailes.

429
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:03,397
- I don't know,
but I think she lived here.
- Oh, yeah, sure. I remember.

430
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:06,866
She was a tall girl.
She changed her name to Linda Ash.

431
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:08,368
Linda Ash ?

432
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:10,928
Yeah, it was a fake name.
She-- She did sex movies.

433
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:13,566
- Sex movies ?
- Yeah, you know, like, uh, Deep Throat.

434
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:16,941
Skin flicks.
Tall, blonde, hot.

435
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:18,946
- Very hot.
- Really ? Good-looking ?

436
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:21,448
Oh, great looking.
Tremendous body.

437
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:23,950
- How you doin' ?
- Hey, Lenny, how are ya ?

438
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,647
- Good. Can I talk to you a minute ?
- Yeah.

439
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:30,214
- I need a favor.
- You got it. What ?

440
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:33,750
You got friends in the, uh,
the adult film business, right ?

441
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:35,820
My nephew knows them all.
Why ?

442
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:40,664
I'm trying to locate
an actress named Linda Ash.

443
00:24:40,736 --> 00:24:43,330
- You know which movies she did ?
- No.

444
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:45,498
I was in the video store
trying to get a video,

445
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:47,667
but, you know, I get embarrassed
because my neighbor saw me there.

446
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:50,007
- And, you know--
-  I hear ya.

447
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:52,171
- Well, let me get back to you
on that one. All right ?
- Yeah.

448
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:57,610
 You know, I don't know
why we have to do this.

449
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:59,677
I-l don't want to spend
the whole weekend at Jerry Bender's.

450
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:01,655
 Oh, Lenny, please.
We've been through this.

451
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:04,385
There are lots
of important clients there.

452
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,393
I-- You know,
so what is this ?

453
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:09,794
Meanwhile this guy's going to
stare at you the whole weekend
and mentally undress you.

454
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:11,799
He is not. He's not.

455
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:15,303
God, your paranoia is rivaled
in history only by Joseph Stalin.

456
00:25:29,718 --> 00:25:32,152
 I'm really glad you
could make it out this weekend, Amanda.

457
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,711
There's some people around here I think
it's very important you should meet.

458
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,123
Oh, thanks, Jerry.
I really appreciate it. I really do.

459
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:40,718
- God, I love your sailboat.
- Yeah, it's fun, isn't it ?

460
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:43,663
- Yeah.
- Sorry the waves were so choppy, Lenny.

461
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:47,168
Oh, it's no problem. I don't mind
throwing up into the wind, you know.

462
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:49,635
You know, we could see
that house next door at 3:00.

463
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:51,639
By the way, it's a great buy.

464
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:53,834
Is it possible that I could
just make one quick phone call ?

465
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:55,843
- Yeah. Ken !
- Yes, Jerry.

466
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:58,175
Oh, sorry, Ken.
Can you show Lenny the private phone ?

467
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:00,339
Sure. Come on, Lenny.
It's right over here.

468
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:03,213
The house sounds exciting.
What are they asking again ?

469
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:07,688
Amanda, listen. Why don't you,
uh, spend the night here tonight.

470
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:10,122
- What do you say ?
Are you free tonight ?
- Uh-- 

471
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:12,126
We could go for a sail.

472
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:15,129
You can't believe what the stars
look like lying on the back of a boat.

473
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:18,132
- Yeah. No, I'd love to.
I really would love to.
- Well, then, do it.

474
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,067
But l-- No, he
has to get back.

475
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:23,730
Really ?

476
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:26,603
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

477
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:28,609
Hmm.

478
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:34,074
I got the skinny
on Linda Ash.

479
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:37,607
She's been in a few films.
She's no star or nothin'.

480
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:39,984
That's why you
never heard of her.

481
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:43,491
She works under
the stage name "Judy Cum."

482
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,890
Mostly, she's a hooker.

483
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:48,088
Uh, I got her number.

484
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:52,833
Judy Cum ?

485
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:54,835
Oh, you never should
have looked for her.

486
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:57,064
Now I see big trouble.

487
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:00,540
Oh, for God's sake.
You know, you're such a Cassandra.

488
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:03,442
I'm not such a Cassandra.
I am Cassandra.

489
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:06,003
- That's who I am.
- I gotta check this thing out.

490
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:09,141
You'll be sorry.
I'm telling you, quit now.

491
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:12,778
Oh, and don't let Amanda talk you
into buying the house next door.

492
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:16,221
- This place ?
- Yes ! I see big problems
with beach erosion...

493
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,225
and a heavy mortgage.

494
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:23,459
Well, I love that property.

495
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:26,126
- Mm-hmm.
- We're right near everybody.

496
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:29,432
Doesn't mean we have to see them
all the time, but we have the option.

497
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:31,870
You-- You're not afraid
of beach erosion, right ?

498
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,637
Beach erosion ? Oh, come on, now.
You're such a Cassandra.

499
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,644
You gonna take a shower ?

500
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:40,272
Yeah. Yeah, can you, uh,
fix something for dinner ?

501
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:42,282
Yeah, I'll make dinner.

502
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,477
I'll make the spaghetti, okay ?

503
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:46,783
There's some sauce
in the fridge.

504
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:18,750
Hello, is this Linda ?

505
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,119
Linda, um, this is Lenny.

506
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,819
Uh, l-- I got your number
from Charlie Biggs.

507
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:29,125
And I wonder if, uh,
it would be possible...

508
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:32,132
that you would have some time
tomorrow afternoon.

509
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,794
- You shouldn't do this.
- Would you please stop it ?

510
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,703
- You're gonna cheat on Amanda ?
- I'm not cheating.

511
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:39,797
-I just want to see what she looks like.
-You can get a disease.

512
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,571
- Aren't you scared of AIDS ?
- I'm not gonna sleep with the girl.

513
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:44,578
I just want to see
what she looks like.

514
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:47,206
I want to get to know her
or something. It's just--

515
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:50,445
Uh, is it possible that we
could meet at a hotel ?

516
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:53,248
You're gonna rent a hotel room
with a hooker and not sleep with her ?

517
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:55,380
Leave me alone.
I want to talk to her.

518
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:57,891
How about the Plaza
on 59th Street ? ls that--

519
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,895
What are you doing ?
At least pick an out-of-the-way spot.

520
00:29:01,963 --> 00:29:03,897
Oh, Christ.

521
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:06,661
Um, Linda, maybe
it'd be better if l--

522
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:09,704
What about your place ?
Would that be a possibility ?

523
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:12,706
- Uh-huh. Uh--

524
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:14,708
Hold on one second.

525
00:29:16,077 --> 00:29:18,011
3:00.

526
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:25,778
Okay.
Um, I'll be there.

527
00:29:25,854 --> 00:29:27,788
And it's Lenny.

528
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:34,956
Uh, Lenny... Gildersleeve.
Okay.

529
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,467
I can't believe this.
I can't believe it.

530
00:29:57,786 --> 00:30:00,914
Hi. Are you my 3:00 ?

531
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,994
- Linda Ash ?
- Yeah, that's right.

532
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:12,895
- I'm Lenny.
- Hello, Lenny. Come on in.

533
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:15,903
- Uh, you're-- you're Linda Ash, right ?
- Yeah.

534
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:18,030
- 'Cause we spoke on the phone ?
- Yeah.

535
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:20,438
Are you okay ?
You look all white.

536
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:22,635
- I'm okay.
- Yeah ?

537
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:25,680
- Do you want something to drink ?

538
00:30:25,747 --> 00:30:28,181
- Maybe-- Do you have a little
Perrier or something ?
- What ?

539
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:31,514
- Little-- Just a little tap water ?
- Oh, sure. I have that.

540
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:34,521
- You're definitely Linda Ash ?
- Yeah.

541
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:37,183
What's the matter ?
Are you a stroke victim or something ?

542
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:39,522
I told you three times.
I'm Linda Ash.

543
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:41,528
Oh.

544
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:46,698
Oh, you have a,
a beautiful apartment.

545
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:50,329
- Oh, thank you. I did it myself.
- Oh.

546
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:53,806
Oh, let me show you
something I just got.

547
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,809
- That. Isn't it a pisser ?
- Ohh !

548
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:58,004
Oh, yes, it's--
it's magnificent.

549
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,479
Oh. Well, yeah.
I got a great sense of humor.

550
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:03,711
That's something you're going
to find out about me-- I'm funny
and I can take a joke.

551
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:06,583
- A lot of people can't take a joke.
- Oh, no, I can.

552
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:08,588
- They say that about me too.
- Oh, yeah ?

553
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,590
- That I have a good sense of humor.
- Oh, good !

554
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:13,491
Then you'll like this. Look,
I just got this. Somebody gave it to me.

555
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:17,497
As the main spring goes back and forth,
the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass.

556
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:20,830
- It's a genuine antique
and it keeps perfect time.
- Oh, my goodness.

557
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:23,336
It's a disgusting--
Ohh.

558
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:25,396
- Lenny ?

559
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:28,704
The water today is a little bit brown.
Would you like some Sprite instead ?

560
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:31,245
- I'm feeling a little dizzy. I--
- Oh, no !

561
00:31:31,312 --> 00:31:33,337
- Come sit down.
- No, no. I don't know why.

562
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:35,906
Usually, you know,
I'm just the picture of health.

563
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:39,010
- Yeah ? You work out ?
- Not-- Not religiously.

564
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:42,488
Oh, I'm not religious either.
Mostly, my folks were Episcopalian.

565
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:44,821
- Oh, are they ? So--
- So.

566
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:48,021
So what do you do, Lenny ?
Oh, no. Wait. Let me guess.

567
00:31:48,096 --> 00:31:50,690
I have a great knack for guessing
what people do for a living.

568
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:53,393
- Um--
- Um, uh-- I'll tell you the truth.

569
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:55,459
- Rug salesman !
- You're close.

570
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:57,835
I'm-- I'm a sportswriter.
Because--

571
00:31:57,906 --> 00:31:59,840
- Shit. I wasn't even in the ballpark.
- Well, it was not--

572
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:02,809
Wait. Ballpark. Sportswriter.
Get it ?

573
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:05,141
-  I get it.

574
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:08,307
I did it with a wrestler once.
A huge, hairy guy.

575
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:11,614
You'd figure he'd be hung like a horse,
but there was very little there.

576
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:13,984
Look, could l-- could I
just get a little water ?

577
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:16,148
- I don't care if it's brown.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

578
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:19,057
I don't mind rust.
I'm just feeling a little--

579
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:22,153
T-Tell me, Linda.

580
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,926
Uh, uh, tell me
about yourself, Linda.

581
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:27,433
Well, what do you--
what do you want to know ?

582
00:32:27,502 --> 00:32:30,164
Anything.
I just want to know about you.

583
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:33,105
- Well, basically, Lenny,
- Yes ?

584
00:32:33,174 --> 00:32:35,665
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

585
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:37,768
I like drama. I study.

586
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:39,780
Yes ? Uh, where--
where's that ?

587
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:42,339
Paul Delucca.
Have you ever heard of him ?

588
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:44,681
- Paul Delucca ? No.
But then, I wouldn't.
- Yeah.

589
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:48,017
- Oh, he's really well-known.
He's a genius.
- I'm sure. I'm sure.

590
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:51,252
He says he thinks I'm gonna
make it big. 

591
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:53,260
- Mmm.
- Um, I know you will.

592
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:56,593
- Yeah. Maybe you've seen
some of my movies.
- That's possible.

593
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:59,132
Did you ever see
The Enchanted Pussy ?

594
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,964
Not yet, but l-l--
It's on my list of must-see.

595
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:03,970
Oh, they're videotapes,
so you can rent it.

596
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:06,802
But my real ambition is
to be on Broadway in a musical.

597
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,809
- I sing.
- Do you ?

598
00:33:08,877 --> 00:33:10,811
- Excuse me.

599
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:19,149
Hello ? Busy. Some of them
are called John, all right ?

600
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:25,321
- Was that-- Was that your husband ?
- Ha-ha. Very funny.

601
00:33:25,393 --> 00:33:27,827
No, but I mean, you have no husband,
no family, no children...

602
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:30,490
or anything like that ?

603
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:33,466
'Cause some do.
You have a funny look on your face.

604
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:35,469
- Um.
- Did I say the wrong thing ?

605
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:37,732
- No. Not really.
- I-- I said--

606
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:40,035
No. No, listen.

607
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:42,736
- What are you in the mood for, Len ?
- Me ? l-l, well,

608
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,005
I would like to--
You know, we can chat for a while.

609
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,240
I thought I'd get into it
slowly and, you know--

610
00:33:47,315 --> 00:33:49,579
You're married, aren't you ?

611
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:52,552
- How can you tell that ?
- 'Cause you got that look.

612
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,554
That look ?
Wh-What look is that ?

613
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:57,648
That look like it's been a long time
since you've had a great blow job.

614
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:01,422
Oh, that look.
I-- I can understand.

615
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:04,761
- Wh-Where are you from ?
- Mm, around.

616
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:07,130
What are you so interested
in me for ?

617
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:09,636
- That's my fingers.
- Yes, I know.

618
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:11,638
- Here.
- What--

619
00:34:11,706 --> 00:34:13,640
Pull, pull !
Pull the strings.

620
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:16,199
- Pull these strings ?
- Yeah, pull all the strings.
See ? See what happens ?

621
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:18,871
- I'm not so mechanical as I was.
- Oh, it's easy. Here. Pull.

622
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:21,882
- Ahh ! See, it opens ! 
- Ohh !

623
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,111
That's amazing.
Science is-- is--

624
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:26,915
- Yeah.
- You, you, you-- I-l--

625
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:29,980
Oh. Really. Well.

626
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:33,994
Uh, you're a very attractive woman,
a very beautiful young woman.

627
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:35,996
Oh, thank you, Lenny.

628
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,999
Well, you're cute too.
So, what do you say ?

629
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,433
- You wanna go inside, take a shower ?
- A shower ?

630
00:34:41,502 --> 00:34:44,164
-You can study me up close and personal.
-Oh ! Oh.

631
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,673
No, see, I bathed already.

632
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:48,675
- You got lipstick on my fi--

633
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:50,973
- Mmm, you smell clean. Mmm.
- Thank you. Well--

634
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:54,503
As I say, I'm basically--
 My ear.

635
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:57,016
- You're sensitive, huh ?
- It's my weak spot, in my ear.

636
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:59,610
- Oh. Okay.

637
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:02,383
A little nibbling
makes me... go crazy.

638
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:04,721
Okay, Len.
Are you nervous ?

639
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,852
I-- No. But yes, I am nervous,
to tell you the truth.

640
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:10,625
- You do look that way.
- I've never-- I-l've never
done this, actually.

641
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:13,360
- Oh, okay. That's all right.
I'll take it slow.
- This is-- I-l--

642
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:15,368
Oh. Okay. I--

643
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:17,563
Um, incidentally, Len,

644
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,631
I think I should tell you
ahead of time l-l get 200 dollars.

645
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,903
It's no problem.
No problem.

646
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:25,445
- Just a-- Just a show of good faith.
- Thanks, Lenny. Wow !

647
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:27,447
You're really sweet, Len.

648
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:29,608
Put it down
as a religious contribution.

649
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:33,085
No, but seriously, you want to know
why I liked you right from the start ?

650
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:36,590
- Why ?
- 'Cause I'm always attracted to losers.

651
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:38,785
Losers ?
You think I'm a loser ?

652
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,987
Yeah.
You got no confidence.

653
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,996
It's sweet.
I like that in a man.

654
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:46,659
I can't stand those johns who come here
and throw down a couple of hundred...

655
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:49,362
and whip out a big dick
and wave it all over the joint.

656
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:53,168
Oh, l-- I wouldn't do that
even if I wanted to because I'll just--

657
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,903
- Ah, shit !

658
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:58,946
Hello. Oh, hello,
Angela.

659
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:03,109
Oh ! Oh, wow !
Ha-ha !

660
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:06,381
Oh, God, thank you
for thinking of me.

661
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:08,388
Yeah, that's great.

662
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:12,119
Okay. 
Yeah, well, I'll see you at 10:00.

663
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:14,286
Bye.

664
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:17,627
I just got a small part
in an Angela Dawson movie.

665
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:20,133
I get to do it with her !

666
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:24,137
I don't understand you.

667
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:26,799
If you're-- If you're serious
about being a Broadway actress,

668
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:29,138
what are you wasting your time
with all this porn for ?

669
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,644
What's it to you ?
It's good experience.

670
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:34,648
How ? Making it with a woman in front
of the camera is good experience ?

671
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,150
That's gonna get you closer
to be a Broadway star ?

672
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:39,652
- What are you getting all mad for ?
- I'm not mad.

673
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,747
I just think it's crazy.
You're an attractive young woman.

674
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:45,258
You know, what are you--
You don't have to live like this, Linda.

675
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:47,260
- What are you, my pastor ?
- This is crazy !

676
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:49,990
You take money from guys
and you perform all these acts.

677
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:52,658
You know, you could be--
Hey, I'm talking to you.

678
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:55,066
- You could have a family.
- Hey, let go of me !

679
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:58,594
- You could have a husband
and a child or something.
- All right. No. Hey !

680
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:00,800
Stop. Stop it now ! Stop !

681
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:03,309
- Listen. I don't like possessive men.
- I'm not possessive.

682
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:05,608
You come in here, you don't
want to do anything with me.
You're telling me what to do.

683
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,614
- I want to talk.
- Do you want to do it or not ?

684
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:09,946
- I want to talk.
I paid you, I want to talk.
- Oh, no. Okay.

685
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,951
- I bought the time.
- Then you get your money back.

686
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:14,112
- I'm giving it back. Refund.
- No, keep the money.

687
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:16,122
- Let's go. No.
- I bought the time !

688
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,489
- Hey, stop it. No, I'm giving
it back and you're leaving.
- Why can't I talk ?

689
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,494
- Get out !

690
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:34,803
Daddy, why are you
staring at me like that ?

691
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,969
Come here.

692
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:39,035
You know why I'm
staring at you ?

693
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:41,638
I'm staring at you
'cause I can't believe it.

694
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:44,150
Because you're so bright
and you're such a great kid.

695
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:46,914
Come on, Max.
Now it's time for bed.

696
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:50,287
 Come on. Okay.
Time for beddums.

697
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:53,020
- Ready ? The kid's getting heavy.

698
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:56,086
- He can walk, you know.
- Yeah. Okay. Can you walk ?

699
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:59,065
Poor Weinrib ! Turn back.

700
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:02,899
Don't meddle any further.
Accept the truth.

701
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,871
I see disaster.
I see catastrophe.

702
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,602
Worse, I see lawyers.

703
00:38:08,676 --> 00:38:11,110
But wait, a messenger.

704
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:15,309
I come from the midtown area
where Lenny Weinrib,

705
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:18,045
tortured by passions
too overwhelming to regulate,

706
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,587
did indeed call
this little hustler on the phone...

707
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:23,180
in earnest attempt
to see her again.

708
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:25,384
At first he wrestled
with his drives,

709
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,394
trying to master a curiosity...

710
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:30,829
not slaked by this initial meeting,
but only whetted by it.

711
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:35,562
His thirst to know this woman more
did inexorably provoke him to call her.

712
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:38,901
Nervous and confused, at first
he only got her answering machine.

713
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:42,170
Then, at fifth try,
she picked up the phone herself.

714
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:46,509
Painful to relate that she
thought he was nuts and did
not want to meet him nohow.

715
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:50,278
"Stop bothering me, creep,"
was her cutting declaration.

716
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,478
Then she used the "F" word.

717
00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:56,080
Agonized, he called again, offering
her abundant financial compensation...

718
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:58,318
just for a brief chat.

719
00:38:58,392 --> 00:39:01,555
But she bade him get off her back
and slammed the phone down.

720
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:05,656
Finally, in doldrums mixed
with much anxiety,

721
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,667
he stood watch
outside her apartment...

722
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:12,172
and waited until such a time as he did
spot her heading for the laundromat.

723
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:24,679
- Oh, my God !
- Okay, don't get upset or anything.

724
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:26,777
- I just thought we could have lunch.
- Why me ?

725
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:29,516
- I'll pay for your time.
I just want to speak to you.
- All right !

726
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,525
What are you, some kind
of fucking pervert who--

727
00:39:32,593 --> 00:39:35,357
Leave me alone. I'm not--
I'm not one of those psychopaths...

728
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:37,363
that kills prostitutes,
I promise you.

729
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:40,764
- Why would you ever say
something like that ?
- I'm joking. I'm joking.

730
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:44,965
Listen, in my work, I have to keep
an eye out for strange individuals.

731
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,132
- Okay.
- I knew a girl that got killed.

732
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,472
All right. Hey,
I got you some flowers. Here.

733
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:52,479
I got you some flowers.
Let's have lunch. I'll pay for it.

734
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:56,005
I'll pay for your time.
I just wanna talk to you.

735
00:39:57,218 --> 00:39:59,914
So then my mother married
my third father.

736
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:02,387
I mean, I don't know if she
married him, but he moved in.

737
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:05,152
We didn't get along.
He was a disgusting drunk.

738
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:08,320
 What about your hereditary
father ? Your actual, actual--

739
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:12,093
Oh, he was a drug pusher
and he was also a car thief.

740
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:15,294
He picked pockets and, you know,
he burgled and stuff.

741
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:18,827
- And he was an epileptic.
- Uh-huh. You haven't left
anything out, right ?

742
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:21,670
- Mail fraud !
- Oh, mail fraud. Oh, okay, yeah.

743
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:23,676
- That's what they caught him on.
- Uh-huh.

744
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:26,178
Hey, you got an appetite
like a lumberjack.

745
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:28,181
Oh. Well, thank you.

746
00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:30,183
Oh, it's fine.
Eat all you want.

747
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:34,415
I'm very hungry, actually.
Um, so then I ran away when I was 14.

748
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:35,921
Mm-hmm.

749
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,550
And I went away with
this musician named Johnny.

750
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,527
And it was terrible because
we fought all the time, Lenny.

751
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:43,860
Finally,
he committed suicide.

752
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:46,195
And for years I thought it
was because of my cooking.

753
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,201
He always hated my clam sauce.

754
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:51,864
And so then I kicked around
from Chicago, Philadelphia, you know.

755
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:53,873
All over the place.
And I ended up here.

756
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:56,205
You never thought of
just getting a regular job ?

757
00:40:56,277 --> 00:40:58,268
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.
No, I did things.

758
00:40:58,346 --> 00:41:02,214
I waited on tables. I worked
in a massage parlor. I did phone sex.

759
00:41:02,283 --> 00:41:05,650
Now and then I would, you know, turn a
few tricks in order to make some dough.

760
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,383
And one day my friend Susie calls me and
she asks me if I want to be in a film.

761
00:41:09,457 --> 00:41:12,153
Something called Snatch Happy.
And I said, "Sure."

762
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:14,888
And I remember
I was very nervous...

763
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:18,295
because I'd never done it in front of
people with a camera before, you know.

764
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:21,426
And so there I am on the first day,
on the set.

765
00:41:21,502 --> 00:41:24,164
And there's this guy
fucking me from behind, right ?

766
00:41:24,238 --> 00:41:27,901
And there's these two huge guys dressed
like cops in my mouth at the same time.

767
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:30,170
And I remember
thinking to myself,

768
00:41:30,244 --> 00:41:33,077
"I like acting. I wanna study."

769
00:41:34,148 --> 00:41:37,345
Yes, well.
It's a-- It's a--

770
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:40,444
 That's one way
of getting into the profession.

771
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:42,512
Um, tell me about
your family a little bit.

772
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,081
What ? I told you already.
You could write a book by now.

773
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,184
But, but were there
any unusual members ?

774
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:50,526
- Very bright ones or brilliant
or talented or something.
- Mmm ! Yes !

775
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,532
- I'm sorry. There was.
- Mmm.

776
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,693
My father's brother
was supposed to be a genius.

777
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,862
I never met him, but everybody
said he was brilliant.

778
00:41:56,937 --> 00:42:00,634
- Really ? What did he do ?
- He was a serial rapist.
He spent his whole life in jail.

779
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,643
But if he had gone straight,
he might have been very good in math.

780
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,804
- Good in math. Well, that's--
- Yeah.

781
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,814
I think I got
my intelligence from him,

782
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:10,146
because everybody else in the family
is all slugs and lowlifes.

783
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:12,651
- I'm the only one with any ambition.
- Are you ?

784
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,154
And you never-- never
had a drive to get married ?

785
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:17,156
What for ?
They're all assholes.

786
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:19,158
One of them used to
beat me up.

787
00:42:19,226 --> 00:42:22,161
Another one used to fuck
my best friend when I wasn't looking.

788
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:24,629
- It was sickening.
- Really.

789
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:27,327
And-- And let me
ask you this.

790
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:30,461
At any point in your life
did you ever think, like,

791
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:32,972
"Maybe I'd like
to have a child" ?

792
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:39,279
Um, l-l did have
a child once.

793
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:41,837
- Did you ?
- Ah, it was a sad story.

794
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:44,180
I'll tell you some other time
when I know you better.

795
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:46,515
If I ever know you better.

796
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:50,513
Are you free this afternoon ?

797
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:52,855
- Why ?
- You have some free time
this afternoon ?

798
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:55,191
- Are you finally in the mood, Lenny ?
- No, no, no, no, no.

799
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,321
I wanna--
I have an assignment.

800
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:00,333
But I thought you might wanna come
with me, 'cause I think you'll enjoy it.

801
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:10,210
I'm gonna bet on a horse,
and if it wins you can keep the dough.

802
00:43:10,277 --> 00:43:12,905
Here's one. "Eager Beaver."

803
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,914
I once did a film
called Beaver Patrol...

804
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:17,610
about these Boy Scouts who find
drunk Girl Scouts in the woods.

805
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:21,212
And they take them into a cabin
and they reach into their packs
and they pull out these dildos.

806
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:23,654
- And then--
- All right, all right. Okay, we'll--

807
00:43:23,724 --> 00:43:25,658
Y-You're sure you want
to bet on Eager Beaver ?

808
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:27,887
- 'Cause it's a 60-to-1.
- Oh, yeah. No, I know it's the one. No!

809
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:30,157
- But it's 60-to-1.
- It's a sign. I know it's gonna work.

810
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:32,290
All right, all right.
Famous last words.

811
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:34,391
- You know.
- I got a hunch.

812
00:43:34,468 --> 00:43:36,663
- You got a hunch. Okay.
Sure, we'll bet on it.
- Yeah.

813
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:39,171
Okay. So if he wins,
how much do I make ?

814
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,403
At 60-to-1 ?
Uh... you make, uh, $3,000.

815
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:45,673
Oh, my God ! I could get that blue
chinchilla coat that I wanted !

816
00:43:45,746 --> 00:43:47,680
- You could get anything you want.
- I could get a Jacuzzi.

817
00:43:47,748 --> 00:43:50,842
- Except he's not gonna win.
- Oh, no, I know what I could do, Lenny!

818
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:53,182
- Oh, my God ! This is great.
- Mm-hmm.

819
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:55,586
All right. You know,
I hope-- I hope you're right.

820
00:43:55,656 --> 00:43:58,682
There's a reason the horse is 60-to-1,
though. He's probably got polio.

821
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:01,353
Oh, no, no. No.
This is a sign.

822
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:03,521
- All right.
- My luck is gonna change.

823
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:06,964
- So is your real name Linda ?
ls that your actual name ?
- I use a lot of names.

824
00:44:07,034 --> 00:44:10,834
My born name is Leslie, but I like
to use names that have nice meanings.

825
00:44:10,905 --> 00:44:12,839
You know, like Mary,
for the Virgin Mary.

826
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:15,467
Or Angel or Linda,
which means "pretty" in Spanish.

827
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:18,478
- But my screen name's Judy Cum.
- Mm-hmm.

828
00:44:18,546 --> 00:44:20,980
Well, lucky there's not a horse
with that name in the race...

829
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:22,982
- 'cause we'd bet on him.
- Oh, no, no, no.

830
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,314
I mean, my attorney friend
would take that under advisement.

831
00:44:25,386 --> 00:44:27,650
- Mm-hmm.
- I got exclusive rights to that name.

832
00:44:27,721 --> 00:44:29,814
All right, all right,
all right. Yeah.

833
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,824
So let me ask you
a question.

834
00:44:31,892 --> 00:44:34,656
Are you ever frightened that when a guy
comes over your house and pays you...

835
00:44:34,728 --> 00:44:37,663
that he's gonna maybe,
like tie you up and kill you ?

836
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:40,165
Oh, no. I always
get paid in advance.

837
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:42,930
- Come on.

838
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:45,267
- Eager Beaver. He's paying.
- Paid in advance ? That's--

839
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:47,273
Lenny.

840
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:49,275
-  They're
coming down to the finish.
-  Come on, Beaver !

841
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:51,504
- It's Autumn Daisy and Enmity.
- Come on ! Catch up !

842
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:53,843
- Eager Beaver continues to drop back.
- Oh, shit ! Oh, Beaver !

843
00:44:53,914 --> 00:44:56,940
- Autumn Daisy and Enmity. It's close.
- Beaver ! Come on, Beaver !

844
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:59,417
- Oh ! Beaver !
- It's Autumn Daisy by a head.

845
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:01,613
- Shit ! Last ?
- Enmity finishing second...

846
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:03,850
- and Lower The Flag finishing third,
- Stupid horse got-- Damn it !

847
00:45:03,924 --> 00:45:07,018
- followed by Marcy's Pride,
True Blue Crew, Classic Alert,
- I had it spent already !

848
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:09,392
- I know. Relax, relax. Relax, will ya ?
- and Eager Beaver was last.

849
00:45:09,463 --> 00:45:12,432
You know, it's not so terrible.
I told you it was a long shot.

850
00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:14,626
- I never have any luck. Never !
- All right.

851
00:45:14,702 --> 00:45:17,170
I never won a fucking thing
in my entire life ! Nothing ! Never !

852
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:20,765
Will you stay calm ?
You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.

853
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:23,901
If it's the money,
I'll lend you the money.

854
00:45:23,978 --> 00:45:25,912
- I can help you.
- No, it's not the money, Lenny.

855
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,245
I don't care about the money.
I just wanted to win so badly.

856
00:45:29,316 --> 00:45:32,444
What do you want to win for ?
We're just out here having a good time.

857
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,783
- You gotta--
- 'Cause I wanted to impress you.

858
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:38,154
Impress me ? What ? You know,
you're not running in the race.

859
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:40,489
What-- You don't
have to impress me. I'm--

860
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:43,086
Yeah, but I wanted to show you
I could pick a winner.

861
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:46,655
Hey. Listen, my horse
didn't win either, you know.

862
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:48,668
Come on, you--
you do impress me.

863
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:52,331
You're attractive, you're--
you're quick, you have a lot of energy.

864
00:45:52,406 --> 00:45:54,840
- You're obviously
a state-of-the-art fellatrix.
- What ?

865
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:57,673
So-- Nothing, nothing.
I'm impressed. Take--

866
00:45:57,745 --> 00:45:59,679
- Lenny, don't say "nothing."
- I'm impressed.

867
00:45:59,747 --> 00:46:02,113
- You think I'm stupid ?
- I don't think you're stupid, no.

868
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:04,616
- No ?
- You know, I think you do
a stupid thing with your life.

869
00:46:04,685 --> 00:46:06,619
But I told you that already.

870
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:09,121
Well, I don't understand
why it matters so much to you.

871
00:46:09,189 --> 00:46:12,386
Hey, come on. We'll stay for one more
race, and this time I'll bet for you.

872
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:14,552
- Yeah ?
- Let me make the bet.
Yeah. N-No. Come on.

873
00:46:14,628 --> 00:46:16,687
- We'll just go to the window
and I'll make one bet.
- All right.

874
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:18,823
Please don't pick one
that runs second...

875
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:20,833
- 'cause I want a winner, okay, Len ?
- Yeah. Hey.

876
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:24,302
You know, they give these horses saliva
tests. I can't guarantee anything.

877
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:30,638
- I gave you your winnings, right ?
- Yeah.

878
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:34,442
That was a great race.
Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.

879
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:37,484
Well, he was a heavy favorite, you know,
and I bet him to come in third.

880
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:40,418
- At least this way you get something.
- Yeah.

881
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,421
So, you wanna come in ?

882
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:45,652
I gotta go home.
I got a wife and kid. You know, I can't.

883
00:46:45,726 --> 00:46:49,753
You know, you only talk about me.
You never talk about yourself.

884
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,231
It's late for me. You know,
I had a great time, but I gotta go.

885
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,564
I feel I owe you a great fuck.

886
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:59,663
Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs,
rest your ulcer, stay in tonight.

887
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,368
I can't stay in.
I got six dates.

888
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:04,434
Six dates.
Slow night for you, right ?

889
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:08,709
I wish I had the penicillin concession
in your apartment. I'd-- I'd be wealthy.

890
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:11,444
All right.
So, you're gonna call me again ?

891
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:14,112
Am I gonna call you again ?
Yeah, I'll call you. Don't worry.

892
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:16,452
- You promise ?
- I will. I'll call you again.

893
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:18,718
Okay. I had a great time.

894
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:20,726
- Bye.
- Okay.

895
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,728
Whew.

896
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:37,274
- Congratulations.
- Thirty-five years.

897
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:39,278
- I never thought we'd make it.
- You and Amanda...

898
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:41,280
have a way to go,
but you'll make it.

899
00:47:41,348 --> 00:47:43,475
- You guys look so young, both of you.
- Yeah, you do.

900
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,484
Well, we've kept
each other young.

901
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:48,146
Your mother could be your sister,
and you could be brother and sister.

902
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:51,157
- You could be my-- yes.
- I don't know where that
puts me, but anyway--

903
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:57,586
She looks so beautiful,
doesn't she, Lenny ?

904
00:47:57,664 --> 00:47:59,757
- To me, she always looks beautiful.
- Mmm.

905
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,767
-I just always find her great. And you--

906
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:04,770
When I said sisters before, I mean it.
You guys look so great.

907
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:07,363
And it's a wonder,
with all the responsibility...

908
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,773
she has opening
her new gallery.

909
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:12,403
- It's a lot of work.
- What new gallery ? A new gallery ?

910
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:15,107
No, I didn't tell you 'cause,
you know, I don't know until
it's a hundred percent definite.

911
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:17,446
- Well, did I say the wrong thing ?
- But it's not.

912
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:20,112
- No, sure. No, I just--
- It's a hundred percent definite.

913
00:48:20,187 --> 00:48:22,212
You're so insecure.
It's happening.

914
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:25,781
- Oh, excuse me.

915
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,293
- What is the story on this ?
- It looks like I have the backing,

916
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:30,296
but it's not totally definite.

917
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:32,298
- That's why I didn't say anything.
- Your mother said it was definite.

918
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:34,459
Yeah, well. It seems as if
I do have the backing.

919
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:37,197
And there is this wonderful space
on Vesey Street. You know it ?

920
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,466
- Vesey ? Yeah, I know it.
- Yeah, down in Soho.

921
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,941
And it looks like, you know,
we think we can get it.

922
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,911
The Dorians are putting in
some money, but l--

923
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:47,913
- Well, don't look so happy about it.
- I am happy !

924
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:51,212
I'm very happy for you, but it's
the first I'm hearing of it, you know.

925
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:53,719
- And for your mother to tell me--
- Yeah, well, look.

926
00:48:53,787 --> 00:48:56,381
I realize that for a time I'm going
to be busier than usual...

927
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:58,721
and I know that's
a sore point,

928
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,727
but, you know, it'll be only
'til it gets off the ground.

929
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:04,229
- Hey, I'm happy for you. I re--
- You are ?

930
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,596
- Yes. I just would have
liked to have known it.
- Are you sure ?

931
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:09,465
- The Amanda Sloane Gallery.
I think that it's great.
- Yeah, on Vesey Street.

932
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:12,972
Believe me.
I haven't even told Jerry Bender yet.

933
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,476
"You've got a fine right, you have,
after the way you treated Mother,

934
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,773
"after the way you treated us all !

935
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:22,179
"A fine right you've got to come back
in here in your best country manner...

936
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:25,878
"and strike attitudes
and make stands...

937
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:28,615
"and criticize my fiance
and give orders...

938
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:30,919
"and mess things up generally
as if you'd done--

939
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:32,959
"Well, I can't help it.
It's sickening !

940
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:35,961
As if he'd done nothing at all !"

941
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:40,933
Well ?

942
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:42,935
What do you think ?

943
00:49:43,003 --> 00:49:45,801
- About what ?
- About me.

944
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:49,001
- You think I'm any good ?
- Yes, it's fine.

945
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:51,010
I-- You know, you're asking
the wrong person.

946
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:53,069
I don't know that much about acting,
to tell you the truth.

947
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:55,081
Oh, I can tell
you're not too impressed.

948
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:58,414
No, no, no. I just thought, you know,
it's a very odd part for you to choose.

949
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:01,420
- Why ?
- Well, you know, 'cause
it's The Philadelphia Story.

950
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:04,514
- But I lived in Philadelphia.
- What has that got to do with it ?

951
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:08,994
- I know the city.
- What ? You pick a part like this--

952
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:12,429
You should get something
closer to yourself.
It wouldn't be such a struggle.

953
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:14,592
- You know.
- Well, what part should I play ?

954
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:17,102
You know-- I don't know.
Something closer.

955
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,765
Clint Eastwood doesn't play
a meek little hairdresser.

956
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,104
Well, I could play
a hairdresser.

957
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:24,440
I-l used to--
I used to do it a lot.

958
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,445
I wanted to be one.
I was very good at it.

959
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:29,107
- So why'd you give it up ?
- Well, I don't know.

960
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:31,117
One thing led to another.

961
00:50:31,185 --> 00:50:33,210
You know, my aunt worked
in a beauty parlor for years.

962
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:35,847
She loved it.

963
00:50:35,923 --> 00:50:38,858
Wait. You mean
not be an actress ?

964
00:50:38,926 --> 00:50:41,724
Well, an actress
is a very tough life, you know.

965
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:44,593
- But a hairdresser
could always make a buck.
- A buck ?

966
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:47,463
A buck ! An honest buck.
No beatings, no AIDS.

967
00:50:47,534 --> 00:50:49,468
You can meet somebody
that you, you know--

968
00:50:49,536 --> 00:50:52,801
You can get a family, have a real life,
someone that cares for you.

969
00:50:52,873 --> 00:50:54,807
Hey !

970
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:57,469
Now, don't you think that I want
to meet somebody and get married...

971
00:50:57,544 --> 00:50:59,808
and get the hell
out of the rat race ?

972
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,974
I would like to move away
and become a mother and just raise kids.

973
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,984
I don't even want
to be a hairdresser.

974
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:07,418
If Clint Eastwood wants
to be a hairdresser, just let him.

975
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:11,423
You missed the point. Clint Eastwood
doesn't want to be a hairdresser.

976
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:14,016
I had a kid, Lenny,

977
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:16,528
and I gave him up
for adoption.

978
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:22,535
It's the sorriest thing
I ever did in my entire life.

979
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:27,031
There's not a day
that doesn't go by that I don't...

980
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:30,099
wake up thinking
about him.

981
00:51:30,177 --> 00:51:32,441
Now some lucky family
has him.

982
00:51:32,512 --> 00:51:35,948
I just hope to God that they're
taking good care of him.

983
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:40,113
Why'd you give him up ?

984
00:51:40,187 --> 00:51:42,951
I don't know. I was--
I was all confused.

985
00:51:43,023 --> 00:51:46,220
I had no dough. I-l--
I didn't know what to do.

986
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:48,352
I--

987
00:51:48,428 --> 00:51:50,362
I didn't even know
who the father was.

988
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,126
It could've been any one
of a hundred guys.

989
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,135
Welcome to planet Earth,
thanks to a broken condom.

990
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:02,406
Gee. That's tough.

991
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:06,245
Um.

992
00:52:07,447 --> 00:52:09,972
What about your kid ?

993
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:13,178
Max ? M-M-Ma-- You know.
Max is the greatest.

994
00:52:13,253 --> 00:52:15,414
- Yeah ?
- Well, sure.

995
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:18,151
Do you have
a picture of him ?

996
00:52:18,225 --> 00:52:21,922
- A picture of Max ?
- Yeah. I'd like to see him.

997
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:23,929
Oh.

998
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:26,431
Uh, yeah, I guess l--

999
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,832
Oh.

1000
00:52:38,912 --> 00:52:42,473
He's very sweet. He--

1001
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,483
You're very lucky.

1002
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:46,519
With Amanda, it was fate.

1003
00:52:46,586 --> 00:52:48,645
With Linda, it's hubris.

1004
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:53,216
His drive to find out, and now,
to change her life, to control her.

1005
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:55,261
-  Yes.
-  Danger.

1006
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:58,765
Wait. Wait,
I see... danger.

1007
00:52:58,832 --> 00:53:02,495
Hey, wait a minute. I don't have
any interest in controlling her.

1008
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:04,594
I'm doing this for Max's sake.

1009
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:08,334
When the kid gets older, inevitably
he's gonna trace his mother.

1010
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:10,672
And, you know, I'd be happier...

1011
00:53:10,744 --> 00:53:14,043
if she was married and a--
a hairdresser, you know,

1012
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:17,049
rather than the star
of The Enchanted Pussy.

1013
00:53:17,117 --> 00:53:21,110
Danger ! I see horrible,
horrible danger !

1014
00:53:21,188 --> 00:53:24,919
- Terrible danger !
- Hey, I can handle myself emotionally.

1015
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:28,518
Not emotional danger,
physical danger.

1016
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:31,962
I see a bald man.
He has a lead pipe.

1017
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:34,466
He's breaking your kneecaps.

1018
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:43,469
So, so, uh, what did, uh--
How did Jerry Bender take it...

1019
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:46,068
when you said that
the decision was final ?

1020
00:53:46,146 --> 00:53:48,137
You know what ?
He was amazing.

1021
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:52,276
I thought he'd be upset, but no,
he was very excited and very supportive.

1022
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:55,219
No, he's being--
He was absolutely great about it.

1023
00:53:55,288 --> 00:53:58,280
Anyway, l-l'm calling to say
I can't make dinner tonight.

1024
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:00,223
Oh, you're kidding.
It's gonna be great.

1025
00:54:00,293 --> 00:54:04,491
Everybody in the Madison Square Garden
organization's gonna be there.

1026
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:06,498
Look, there's no way
I can get away.

1027
00:54:06,566 --> 00:54:09,592
The architects are here
and the Dorians are in town from Paris.

1028
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:13,503
And, uh, the architects fly back
to Milan tonight. I can't.

1029
00:54:13,573 --> 00:54:16,838
All right, well. 
I'll tell you what.

1030
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,504
What I'll do is, I'll go home
and I'll put Max to sleep.

1031
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,604
I'll spend a little time
there and then--

1032
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:23,945
Then-- Oh.

1033
00:54:24,017 --> 00:54:26,952
Uh, look, let me--
I'm gonna call you back. I got, uh--

1034
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,420
I'm gonna call you back.
Oh, geez.

1035
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:31,423
It's just against our policy--
-  I understand !

1036
00:54:31,491 --> 00:54:33,425
- If you wanna wait right here.
- Whatever.

1037
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:35,427
-Lenny, there's someone here to see you.
-Lenny !

1038
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:38,020
-  Uh, yes.
Uh, c-c-come in. Come in.
- Lenny !

1039
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:40,623
- Th-This is Miss Gildersleeve.
She's an acquaintance.
- You know her ?

1040
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,134
- Gildersleeve ?
- Yes, Miss-- Miss Gildersleeve.

1041
00:54:43,203 --> 00:54:46,297
We're old-- It's okay. It's okay.
I'll be in here.

1042
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:48,807
- You don't need anything ?
- No, no ! I'm fine.

1043
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,809
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

1044
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:53,471
- What are you doing here ?
- Lenny ? Lenny, I got to talk to you.

1045
00:54:53,547 --> 00:54:55,879
Ricky threatened to-- to--
to hurt me. He--

1046
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:59,544
- Who's Ricky ?
- He takes a percentage of my work.

1047
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:03,180
- He's a pimp, right ?
- No, he's like
a business representative.

1048
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:05,417
What do you need a business repre--
You-- You--

1049
00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:08,757
All you need is a mattress
and a couple of garter belts.
You're not a conglomerate.

1050
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:11,093
Lenny, he said he
was going to cut me up...

1051
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:13,598
because I told him I didn't
want to work anymore.

1052
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:17,228
 Well, I think it's a great
idea that you want to phase out.

1053
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:19,363
- He has no qualms about killing me.
- Ohh.

1054
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:21,600
Listen, we'll call the police.
That's not a big deal.

1055
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:24,269
How can I call the police
with my setup ?

1056
00:55:24,344 --> 00:55:27,040
You know, I told you
a thousand times...

1057
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:29,172
you're in a hazardous business.

1058
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:31,615
So that's what happens.
Now, so-- Don't go outside.

1059
00:55:31,685 --> 00:55:34,813
I'm not going outside. I thought,
just maybe, if you could talk to him.

1060
00:55:34,888 --> 00:55:37,356
- Me ? What, are you nuts ?
- Yeah, because--

1061
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:40,120
Because you're smart and bright
and you got a way with words.

1062
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:42,388
I can't talk to him.
I don't even know the guy.

1063
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:45,397
Yeah, well, he knows it was your idea
that I get out of the business.

1064
00:55:45,465 --> 00:55:47,524
So he said he's gonna
kill you too.

1065
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:50,297
- He said he was gonna kill me ?
- Yeah, 'cause it was your idea.

1066
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:54,329
He's gonna cut up my face
and put a bullet between your eyes.

1067
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:57,934
Really ? Did he--
Did he specify the caliber ?

1068
00:55:58,011 --> 00:56:01,412
Listen, I just thought maybe
you could just reason with him.

1069
00:56:01,481 --> 00:56:04,450
No, I can't.
I-- Listen, I never told you this,

1070
00:56:04,518 --> 00:56:07,078
but I got a-- a slight
heart murmur...

1071
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:09,485
and right now
it's murmuring "hide."

1072
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:11,490
- I don't believe you're a coward.

1073
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:14,254
Only in actuality.
Um, this is not for me.

1074
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:17,091
- Lenny, I need your help.
- No, I'm not a violence person.

1075
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:21,099
I-l write about hockey and boxing
and football. This is not my world.

1076
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:24,330
Lenny, I do want to quit like you said,
but he said he's not gonna let me !

1077
00:56:24,404 --> 00:56:27,032
- He's gonna hurt us both. Please !
- Relax, relax.

1078
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:30,099
What do you want me to do ?
How am I gonna talk to him ?

1079
00:56:30,176 --> 00:56:32,110
- Well, okay. You just--
- I--

1080
00:56:32,178 --> 00:56:35,443
You just talk because you're smarter
than he is and stronger than he is.

1081
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:38,279
You're a much better man. So just
remember that when you talk to him.

1082
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:42,117
He's a little bit intimidating.
He's got a bald head and an earring.

1083
00:56:42,188 --> 00:56:45,248
- But you'll win. I know you will.
- Jesus, l-- I--

1084
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:47,452
You're a good man, Lenny.
You'll win.

1085
00:56:47,527 --> 00:56:49,461
Look, in case anything
comes up,

1086
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:53,693
I want you to know that l-l'm
type O-positive, okay ?

1087
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:56,793
Derek, I got the feeling you
came here and obviously moved...

1088
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,804
into this whole Knick persona.

1089
00:56:58,872 --> 00:57:01,466
- Did you get caught up, maybe,
with a little bit of this Knick,
- Excuse me.

1090
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:03,907
"I gotta be physical,
I gotta be tough," and maybe--

1091
00:57:03,977 --> 00:57:05,911
I'm, uh, I'm
Lenny Gildersleeve.

1092
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:09,244
I-- I'm a friend
of Linda-- Linda Ash's.

1093
00:57:09,316 --> 00:57:12,752
And, uh, I thought
that perhaps we could--

1094
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:14,753
See--

1095
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:17,085
What I want to discuss
with you is that...

1096
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:20,183
there comes a time in the life
of every young woman,

1097
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,319
not just Linda, but everyone,

1098
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:26,161
that they-- they want to perhaps
make a change in their life.

1099
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:29,759
They maybe want to settle down
or explore alternative lifestyles.

1100
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:33,602
I don't think you've been a very good
influence on Linda, Mr. Weinrib.

1101
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:37,973
Weinrib. Right. So Gildersleeve
is a name I use for business purposes.

1102
00:57:38,044 --> 00:57:40,444
- I got an investment in Linda.
- No question.

1103
00:57:40,513 --> 00:57:43,038
I honor that. But--
But by now, she's probably...

1104
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:45,107
repaid you tenfold
or twentyfold or--

1105
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:48,382
Don't be so fuckin' sure, 'cause you
don't know what the fuckin' numbers are!

1106
00:57:48,455 --> 00:57:51,447
That's a point well taken.
Excuse me, you're-- you're-- Excuse me.

1107
00:57:51,524 --> 00:57:54,220
I-l-l understand what you're saying.
Is that a Pellegrino ?

1108
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:57,525
Can l-- Because you've
bent my throat now a little bit.

1109
00:57:57,597 --> 00:58:00,430
And, uh, the windpipe used to
hang straight until this moment.

1110
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,434
The fuckin' Knicks suck !

1111
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:04,436
They need a good shootin' forward.

1112
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:06,563
Yes, well, there's gonna
be a three-way trade.

1113
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,574
I don't know if you guys
heard anything about it.

1114
00:58:08,642 --> 00:58:10,906
- Seattle, Atlanta
and the Knicks are talking.
- Bullshit.

1115
00:58:10,977 --> 00:58:13,070
- No, no, no. I kid you not.
I know. It's in the air.
- Yeah ?

1116
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,205
- They're discussing a trade.
- So what do you think about the Nets ?

1117
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:17,306
- You think the Nets got a chance ?
- The Nets ? Yes, I do.

1118
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:19,750
If they're injury-free,
I think they have a good chance.

1119
00:58:19,819 --> 00:58:22,185
I like the Nets. I think they're
one or two years away, is all.

1120
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:24,189
I would say two or three myself.

1121
00:58:24,257 --> 00:58:27,283
You see, we have a common interest,
the three of us.

1122
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,090
- What were we talking about ?
- Linda, Linda Ash.

1123
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:33,428
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That girl's goin' no place.

1124
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,095
She walks on me, I'll disfigure her
and I'll fuckin' kill you.

1125
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,435
See, that's exactly what
Dr. Kleinholtz would call "acting out."

1126
00:58:40,507 --> 00:58:42,600
- Don't tell me how to run
my fuckin' business !
- I'm not !

1127
00:58:42,676 --> 00:58:44,610
My girls do
what I tell 'em to do.

1128
00:58:44,678 --> 00:58:46,612
Far be it for me to advise you.

1129
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,978
You obviously have a work ethic
that's specific to your needs.

1130
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:52,109
That's why you can afford
an establishment like this, you know.

1131
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,278
You're gonna take that from him ?

1132
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:57,414
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1133
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,254
I'm about to have an
out-of-body-experience here.

1134
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:02,760
- Show strength.
- Show strength ?

1135
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:05,798
This guy's gonna put me
into 27 separate Mason jars.

1136
00:59:05,865 --> 00:59:09,130
The girl was right. They respect
strength. They despise cowardice.

1137
00:59:09,202 --> 00:59:11,227
Power is all they know.
Stand firm.

1138
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:13,363
- Remember brave Achilles.
- Hey, don't get--

1139
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,807
Achilles only had an Achilles heel.
I have a full Achilles body.

1140
00:59:16,876 --> 00:59:20,073
- Go on !

1141
00:59:20,146 --> 00:59:22,614
Look, I'm gonna level
with you.

1142
00:59:22,682 --> 00:59:25,583
I want to discuss
this Linda Ash thing and l-l--

1143
00:59:25,652 --> 00:59:28,519
What are you so interested
in Linda for anyway, huh ?

1144
00:59:28,588 --> 00:59:31,284
- Are you fuckin' her ?
- No, we have a strictly
platonic relationship.

1145
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:33,291
- Yeah ?
- It's a good shirt.

1146
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,624
Well, if you're a friend of hers, don't
be putting stupid ideas in her head.

1147
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:39,130
She's liable to get hurt.
You too.

1148
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,292
 You're gonna
let him do that to you ?

1149
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:43,801
Hey, look. Would you do me a favor
and go back to Athens ?

1150
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:48,136
You gonna let your son's mother remain
a white slave to this two-bit pimp ?

1151
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,142
It-- It's starting
to look that way, isn't it ?

1152
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,144
- You get them Knicks tickets yet ?
- No tickets.

1153
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:54,146
- I tried everywhere.

1154
00:59:54,214 --> 00:59:57,479
- Do you need tickets to the
Knicks game ? Because l--
- Why ? Who do you know ?

1155
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,484
Me ? l-l can help you.

1156
00:59:59,552 --> 01:00:01,816
We want seats on the floor,
next to the movie stars.

1157
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:04,652
If you want to discuss a deal with
Linda, I can get you courtside seats.

1158
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:06,988
You can't get 'em.
Nobody can get 'em, 'cause I tried.

1159
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,654
No, I can, though.
I-- I'm a sportswriter. I can get 'em.

1160
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:12,323
I'd fuckin' give you my mother
for courtside seats,

1161
01:00:12,398 --> 01:00:14,332
much less this cheap little whore.

1162
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,494
That's perfectly put, succinctly put.
I know what point you're making.

1163
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,232
- But if you're tryin'
to fuckin' pull something,
- Easy. Take it--

1164
01:00:20,306 --> 01:00:23,173
I will shoot you and her
through the fuckin' eyeballs !

1165
01:00:23,243 --> 01:00:26,337
It's silly to haggle over details.

1166
01:00:26,412 --> 01:00:29,575
Well, I'll get the tickets.
I'll get the tickets, I promise.

1167
01:00:29,649 --> 01:00:32,083
Then we can discuss Linda.

1168
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:41,493
Dad, are you very brave ?

1169
01:00:41,561 --> 01:00:44,496
Am I brave ? It's funny
you should ask that question.

1170
01:00:44,564 --> 01:00:47,499
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson ?

1171
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:50,001
What ? What ?
Who would win what ?

1172
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:53,004
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson ?

1173
01:00:53,072 --> 01:00:56,508
- Me versus Mike Tyson ?
Who do you think would win ?
- You ?

1174
01:00:56,576 --> 01:00:58,510
There'd be no contest,
you know.

1175
01:00:58,578 --> 01:01:02,014
He would probably take the early rounds,
but I'd get to him eventually.

1176
01:01:02,081 --> 01:01:05,517
I'd chase him all over the ring.
It's my style. Always was.

1177
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:08,520
 On the whole, I think it
will work. Yeah, I think it will.

1178
01:01:08,588 --> 01:01:12,024
The only thing is, I want the gallery
to be lit from above,

1179
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:15,026
so I guess the skylight
will have to be enlarged.

1180
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:17,528
- Honey ? Bed ? Could you ?
- Me or him ?

1181
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:20,532
Him. Please ?

1182
01:01:28,408 --> 01:01:31,343
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't do this. I can't.

1183
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:35,347
-Why are you fighting this ?
-'Cause I'm married and I have a family.

1184
01:01:35,415 --> 01:01:37,349
A-And I love Lenny.

1185
01:01:38,585 --> 01:01:40,519
I love him.

1186
01:01:40,587 --> 01:01:43,021
So, who are you trying
to convince, you or me ?

1187
01:01:49,596 --> 01:01:52,030
- I got you a present.
- You're kidding.

1188
01:01:52,098 --> 01:01:55,033
Yeah. For fixing things up
with me and Ricky.

1189
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:58,036
- I know he can be really rough.
- That was completely unnecessary.

1190
01:01:58,104 --> 01:02:00,038
Very sweet,
but completely unnecessary.

1191
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:03,974
You didn't want a blow job, so the least
I could do was get you a tie.

1192
01:02:04,043 --> 01:02:05,977
Good thinking.
That's uh-- Oh !

1193
01:02:06,045 --> 01:02:08,479
- Yes, it's a tie, isn't it ?

1194
01:02:08,548 --> 01:02:11,984
- Would you ever
wear anything that bright ?
- If the occasion demanded.

1195
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:16,147
You know, like if I ever get invited
to the Mardi Gras, I could--

1196
01:02:16,222 --> 01:02:19,658
Oh, good. Lenny, do you want
a sandwich ? I'm gonna have a sandwich.

1197
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:22,661
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Oh, okay.

1198
01:02:22,729 --> 01:02:25,163
- It's great.
- Good.

1199
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,165
You know what, Lenny ?

1200
01:02:27,233 --> 01:02:30,669
I couldn't get your son's picture
out of my mind.

1201
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:33,672
- Well, he's a very cute kid, you know.
- Yeah.

1202
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,674
Len ?

1203
01:02:35,742 --> 01:02:38,677
I think I would be
a good mother.

1204
01:02:38,745 --> 01:02:41,680
I think you'd be a great mother.
You're very affectionate.

1205
01:02:41,748 --> 01:02:43,682
- Yeah ?
- Mm-hmm.

1206
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:47,186
I would like to start over again.
Maybe have a house. That would be nice.

1207
01:02:47,253 --> 01:02:50,188
It would be great, you know.
I think it'd be fabulous.

1208
01:02:50,256 --> 01:02:52,190
- And you could do it.
- Yeah ?

1209
01:02:52,258 --> 01:02:55,193
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- The problem is, now,
finding the right guy.

1210
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:58,196
I need to find somebody
who'll love me, you know.

1211
01:02:58,264 --> 01:03:00,198
Somebody who'll take care
of me and respect me.

1212
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:02,200
Well, I'll keep my eye open.

1213
01:03:02,268 --> 01:03:04,702
You know, maybe--
maybe-- who knows ?

1214
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:08,707
The only thing is, Len,
he'd have to be as smart as me.

1215
01:03:08,775 --> 01:03:12,211
I'm sure there's somebody out there,
you know, that can--

1216
01:03:12,278 --> 01:03:14,712
- You'll find an equal somewhere.
- Yeah ?

1217
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:17,716
And don't worry, Len.
I gave up on you.

1218
01:03:17,784 --> 01:03:19,718
- M--
- I knew it couldn't be.

1219
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:22,983
Let me tell you, at my age,
if I made love with you,

1220
01:03:23,056 --> 01:03:25,422
they would have to
put me on a resuscitator.

1221
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:26,924
Ha.

1222
01:03:26,993 --> 01:03:28,927
-  This is Max.

1223
01:03:28,995 --> 01:03:30,929
- Max.
- This is my kid.

1224
01:03:30,997 --> 01:03:32,931
- How old are you ?
- I'm five.

1225
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:34,933
- You're five ? You gonna be a fighter ?
- Yeah.

1226
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:37,936
 Max is gonna be
a middleweight when he gets older.

1227
01:03:38,004 --> 01:03:40,939
He's gonna be a heavyweight,
the way you're carryin' him.

1228
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:44,568
I'm gonna teach you how to box, Max.
I'm gonna show you a combination punch.

1229
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:47,579
One-five, one-five.
Two, three and four, you're gonna get.

1230
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:50,582
- Hey, Ray. This is my kid Max.
- How you doin', Max ?

1231
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,585
Max is gonna be a middleweight
when he gets older.

1232
01:03:53,653 --> 01:03:56,918
- Maybe a heavyweight ?
Yeah, I think a heavyweight.

1233
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,925
- You wanna go hit the bag with me ?
- Okay.

1234
01:03:59,993 --> 01:04:01,927
- Nice kid.
- He's a doll.

1235
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:03,929
So, what's with
the Sanchez thing ?

1236
01:04:03,997 --> 01:04:06,932
Is he gonna win that ?
ls he training ? ls he not training ?

1237
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,935
- He can do it. He's in
the best shape of his life.
- Yeah ?

1238
01:04:10,003 --> 01:04:12,938
The only thing is, you don't know
what these guys do outside the gym.

1239
01:04:13,006 --> 01:04:15,941
- Well, that's the point.
You hear all these stories.
- He'll be all right.

1240
01:04:16,009 --> 01:04:19,445
Hey, Kevin, come here. I wanna introduce
you to my friend Lenny Weinrib.

1241
01:04:19,512 --> 01:04:23,448
- He's a sportswriter.
He writes about boxing.
- How you doin' ?

1242
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:26,952
- Listen, I'm gonna get
warmed up, all right ?
- Show us what you can do.

1243
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,955
- My hand's still a little sore.
- Wrap it up good. You'll be okay.

1244
01:04:30,023 --> 01:04:33,459
- I don't know that kid.
- This kid can move. He hits good too.

1245
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:35,460
Got nice hand speed,
you know ?

1246
01:04:35,528 --> 01:04:38,964
Only thing is, you don't know about
these guys-- sometimes they lack desire.

1247
01:04:39,032 --> 01:04:41,967
I seen it a million times. I don't know
if he's got the killer instinct.

1248
01:04:42,035 --> 01:04:45,971
Keeps talkin' about goin' back upstate
where he comes from on an onion farm.

1249
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:49,475
- He wants to be an onion farmer.
You believe it ?
- That kid's a farmer ?

1250
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:51,976
He's an onion farmer, yeah. I don't know
how long he's gonna stick around.

1251
01:04:52,045 --> 01:04:55,981
That's the problem. It's a shame too;
he hits like a fuckin' mule.

1252
01:04:56,049 --> 01:04:59,485
He's fast, but he wants to quit boxing,
go back and hang out on the farm.

1253
01:04:59,552 --> 01:05:01,417
You know, retire.

1254
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:04,923
And the worst thing of all is,
his girlfriend left him.

1255
01:05:04,991 --> 01:05:06,925
- She quit on him.
- Really ?

1256
01:05:06,993 --> 01:05:08,927
Took him for everything
he's got.

1257
01:05:08,995 --> 01:05:12,931
He's a nice, sweet kid, but between you
and l, he ain't got too much upstairs.

1258
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:15,934
They're all alike.
Hey, Len, what's the matter with you ?

1259
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:18,937
Looks like you got somethin'
on your mind. I don't understand.

1260
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:20,905
Hey, Bo !

1261
01:05:20,973 --> 01:05:23,908
This-- This is the left,
and this is the right.

1262
01:05:23,976 --> 01:05:26,911
- Right ?
- Yeah, yeah, Kevin, that's right.

1263
01:05:26,979 --> 01:05:28,913
Yeah.

1264
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:32,017
Bye-bye.

1265
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:35,020
- Hi, Lenny. I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

1266
01:05:35,088 --> 01:05:38,023
- It's starting to rain.
- Oh, I don't have an umbrella.

1267
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:41,527
I met a guy this afternoon that I think
would be absolutely great for you.

1268
01:05:41,594 --> 01:05:43,528
- Perfect.
- For me ?

1269
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:46,531
- Yes. He's young,
he's strong, he's healthy.
- What does he do ?

1270
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:49,534
H-H-He's, you know, like,
dicking around in agriculture.

1271
01:05:49,602 --> 01:05:51,536
What's wrong with his dick ?

1272
01:05:51,604 --> 01:05:53,538
No, no, no, he's a farmer.
The guy's a farmer.

1273
01:05:53,606 --> 01:05:56,541
- You met a farmer ?
- Yeah, an onion farmer. It's great.

1274
01:05:56,609 --> 01:05:58,543
- Where ?
- At the gym.

1275
01:05:58,611 --> 01:06:01,478
What the hell is an onion farmer
doing at the gym ?

1276
01:06:01,547 --> 01:06:05,483
He's-- He's f-finishing a-a-a
very productive career as a boxer.

1277
01:06:05,551 --> 01:06:07,485
A boxer ? Oh, Lenny.

1278
01:06:07,553 --> 01:06:10,989
No, he's-- Look, he doesn't
want to be a boxer anymore.

1279
01:06:11,057 --> 01:06:14,993
H-He's-- He wants to meet
the right girl and be a farmer.

1280
01:06:15,061 --> 01:06:18,997
- Don't look at me.
- He's per-- His brother has
a big onion farm upstate.

1281
01:06:19,065 --> 01:06:22,000
Just think of it.
It'd be so great.

1282
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:26,266
A small town, and you're-- y-you're
hairdressing and, and raising kids.

1283
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:28,273
What small town ?

1284
01:06:28,341 --> 01:06:30,775
- Wampsville.
- Where ?

1285
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:33,277
Wampsville.
It's an old lndian name.

1286
01:06:33,346 --> 01:06:35,280
I-l-lt's a place rich
in American heritage.

1287
01:06:35,348 --> 01:06:37,282
Are you off
your fucking rocker ?

1288
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:40,786
I'm gonna go marry an onion farmer
and do hair in Wimpsville ?

1289
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:42,787
Wampsville,
not Wimpsville.

1290
01:06:42,855 --> 01:06:45,016
It's so perfect.
He's a nice, sweet guy.

1291
01:06:45,091 --> 01:06:47,025
Oh, come on. Forget it.

1292
01:06:47,093 --> 01:06:50,028
He's perfect, though.
He's bright-- You'll think he's bright.

1293
01:06:50,096 --> 01:06:53,031
- He is a fucking onion farmer.
- That's okay.

1294
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:56,034
He's a nice kid.
More important, he's honest and decent.

1295
01:06:56,102 --> 01:06:59,037
And don't offer to give him a blow job
in the first five minutes,

1296
01:06:59,105 --> 01:07:02,040
- 'cause he thinks you're a hairdresser.
- You lied ?

1297
01:07:02,108 --> 01:07:04,042
- I--
- You shouldn't lie.

1298
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:07,602
Just do what I'm telling you.
Just listen to me for once.

1299
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,614
I'm off the girls,
Lenny.

1300
01:07:09,682 --> 01:07:12,617
I mean, the last girl I was with
cheated me out of all my dough, man.

1301
01:07:12,685 --> 01:07:15,620
I'm telling you, this is a nice kid,
Kevin. She's nice.

1302
01:07:15,688 --> 01:07:18,623
-This the hairdresser you told me about?
-This is the hairdresser.

1303
01:07:18,691 --> 01:07:22,627
I gave you a big buildup.
This girl could have her
pick of any guy she wants.

1304
01:07:22,695 --> 01:07:25,129
- I said good things about you.
- What'd you tell her ?

1305
01:07:25,198 --> 01:07:28,133
I told her you were handsome,
a good-looking guy;

1306
01:07:28,201 --> 01:07:31,136
that you're a great athlete;
that you're gifted, bright.

1307
01:07:31,204 --> 01:07:34,139
- You didn't lie.
- Would I lie ? Of course not.

1308
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:36,141
You told her I could fight ?

1309
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:38,143
I told her, but
what touches her heart...

1310
01:07:38,211 --> 01:07:40,645
is that you want
to be a farmer.

1311
01:07:40,713 --> 01:07:44,149
This is a girl that has a love
of the soil, I promise you.

1312
01:07:44,217 --> 01:07:46,651
Onions. Onions.
My brother's got an onion farm.

1313
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,155
I wanna go back up there 'cause I
wanna get the hell outta this city.

1314
01:07:50,223 --> 01:07:53,158
That's perfect ! You mention onions
to Linda, she goes crazy !

1315
01:07:53,226 --> 01:07:56,195
She goes nuts, you say "onion."

1316
01:07:56,262 --> 01:07:59,197
You say "onion" to Linda,
the girl is just--

1317
01:07:59,265 --> 01:08:02,132
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

1318
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:04,135
That's her name ?
Linda ?

1319
01:08:04,203 --> 01:08:08,139
Linda. It's a pretty name.
What are you so, so, so standoffish--

1320
01:08:08,207 --> 01:08:11,643
- Is that with an "E-R" or a "U-R" ?
- Is what with an "E-R" or--

1321
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:14,646
- "Linder" ?
- Linda. Linda with an "A." Linda.

1322
01:08:14,714 --> 01:08:16,648
- Oh.
- She's a great kid.

1323
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:18,650
And she's
a substantial woman.

1324
01:08:18,718 --> 01:08:20,652
This is not a dumb girl.

1325
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,656
This girl has got a PhD i-i-in...
root and follicle culture.

1326
01:08:24,724 --> 01:08:27,659
- And she's pretty, right ?
- To die. She's to die.

1327
01:08:27,727 --> 01:08:30,161
'Cause that's important.
'Cause I've been stung.

1328
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:33,164
The last girl I was with
drove me up the wall, man.

1329
01:08:33,232 --> 01:08:36,929
- She made my stomach
sick to the stomach.
- Linda is church people.

1330
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:39,437
- That's what I want.
I want a church girl.
- She's great.

1331
01:08:39,505 --> 01:08:43,441
I want a nice church girl; I don't want
one of these fast New York sluts.

1332
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:47,445
I want a nice, homely girl
who likes to raise a family
and dogs and that kind of thing.

1333
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:50,778
Can I say two words to you ?
Can I say two words ?

1334
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,784
Butter churn. Okay ?

1335
01:08:52,852 --> 01:08:55,286
Butter churn.
This is a pioneer girl.

1336
01:08:55,354 --> 01:08:58,289
This is a girl who is practically,
incidentally, a virgin.

1337
01:08:58,357 --> 01:09:00,222
What do you mean,
"practically" ?

1338
01:09:00,293 --> 01:09:04,730
I wanna level with you-- sh-she's slept
with one or two guys in her life.

1339
01:09:04,797 --> 01:09:06,731
An old college professor...

1340
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,733
a-a-and her childhood
sweetheart.

1341
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:11,736
But both of them were killed
in combat for their nation.

1342
01:09:11,804 --> 01:09:14,739
- It's a sad story.
- A professor got killed in combat ?

1343
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:16,741
Humanities regiment.

1344
01:09:16,809 --> 01:09:20,108
You know, they were the first ones
to land at Anzio. I'm telling you--

1345
01:09:20,179 --> 01:09:23,239
You said she was an actress ?
She's been in some films ?

1346
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:27,252
-She's had a couple of good roles, yeah.
-She's ever been in anything I seen ?

1347
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,255
Hey-- You didn't see
Schindler's List ?

1348
01:09:30,323 --> 01:09:34,760
No, no, no-- T-That was-- That was--
That was the one with the Jews and, um--

1349
01:09:34,827 --> 01:09:37,762
- Who were the bad guys ?
- The blond guys were the Nazis.

1350
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:40,196
- They were tough motherfuckers.
- Yeah, all right.

1351
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:43,201
I'm telling you, this is a good girl.
She's wonderful.

1352
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:45,203
He's playing God.

1353
01:09:45,271 --> 01:09:47,705
It would be nice
if he could bring this off.

1354
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:49,206
It's hubris !

1355
01:09:49,275 --> 01:09:51,869
He spent a lot of time
preparing her.

1356
01:10:29,615 --> 01:10:32,550
Listen, have you, uh--

1357
01:10:32,618 --> 01:10:36,054
given any more thought
to what we discussed ?

1358
01:10:36,122 --> 01:10:38,056
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1359
01:10:38,124 --> 01:10:43,061
I mean-- Look, the problem is, I don't
know how I feel anymore; I'm confused.

1360
01:10:43,129 --> 01:10:46,064
- I--
- Listen, Amanda, I love you.

1361
01:10:46,132 --> 01:10:48,066
Yeah ?

1362
01:10:48,134 --> 01:10:52,571
You're never gonna be able to forgive
yourself if you don't give it a try.

1363
01:11:03,649 --> 01:11:05,583
Kevin.

1364
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:09,087
This is Linda.
Linda, this is, uh--

1365
01:11:09,155 --> 01:11:11,089
This is Kevin.

1366
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:14,092
- How you doin' ?
- Hi.

1367
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:17,595
So--

1368
01:11:19,432 --> 01:11:23,630
I'll go and-- I just wanted to
bring you guys together, you know.

1369
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:27,504
You know, you could
maybe stick around, maybe.

1370
01:11:27,573 --> 01:11:29,507
You know, we could
go out or somethin'.

1371
01:11:29,575 --> 01:11:32,510
- Yeah.
- No, no. I'm completely superfluous.

1372
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:35,513
Oh, you don't feel good ?

1373
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:38,015
No, I'm superfluous.
I'm completely unnecessary.

1374
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:42,520
You guys can have a great time
and I'll-- I got stuff to do, you know.

1375
01:11:43,956 --> 01:11:47,517
- I got these for you.
- What are these, daisies ?

1376
01:11:47,593 --> 01:11:49,527
- Uh--
- That's great.

1377
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:51,529
That's nice.

1378
01:11:51,597 --> 01:11:53,030
Yeah-- Ye-- Yeah.

1379
01:11:53,098 --> 01:11:55,532
I thought you said
that he was a farmer.

1380
01:11:55,601 --> 01:11:57,762
Well, he is-- He's a farmer.

1381
01:11:57,837 --> 01:12:01,398
- I know they're not onions.
- Daisies make me sneeze, Lenny.

1382
01:12:01,474 --> 01:12:04,409
Come here a minute.
Excuse us one second.

1383
01:12:04,477 --> 01:12:07,412
They're beautiful flowers. Tell him
they're beautiful and enjoy yourself.

1384
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,415
- I could hold the flowers.
- I know, but they just make me sneeze.

1385
01:12:10,483 --> 01:12:14,419
- She sneezes with flowers.
That's good luck if you sneeze.
- I'll hold the flowers.

1386
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:17,923
- Thanks.
- Go ahead, have fun. I'll see you guys.

1387
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:19,924
I'm gonna go.

1388
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:21,926
Take care.

1389
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:29,433
So, y-- you're pretty.

1390
01:12:29,502 --> 01:12:31,936
Uh-- He's...
tellin' the truth.

1391
01:12:32,004 --> 01:12:33,938
- You're really...
- Oh.

1392
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:35,940
pretty.

1393
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:39,808
- Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

1394
01:12:39,879 --> 01:12:42,814
I bet you're hung
like a horse.

1395
01:12:42,882 --> 01:12:44,816
- Yeah, I can ride a horse.
- Yeah ?

1396
01:12:44,884 --> 01:12:48,320
You know, my brother's got a farm,
you know. I love animals.

1397
01:12:48,387 --> 01:12:53,324
I like animals. He's got a farm up there
with the ducks and the pigs and, um--

1398
01:12:53,392 --> 01:12:55,326
Oh, yeah.
In Wisconsin.

1399
01:12:55,394 --> 01:12:57,328
Wampsville.

1400
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:28,853
Yeah. How long
were you doin' hair ?

1401
01:14:31,924 --> 01:14:34,859
- That's right, 'cause you
were doin' the acting, right ?
- Yeah.

1402
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:38,363
- That's right. I didn't
get to see Schindler's List.
- Me neither.

1403
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,866
But what were some of the other films
you were in ?

1404
01:14:41,934 --> 01:14:44,869
Well, I did
The Enchanted, uh--

1405
01:14:44,937 --> 01:14:47,872
- Salad.
- The Enchanted Salad ?

1406
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,875
What was that about ?
ls it good ?

1407
01:14:50,943 --> 01:14:53,878
Yeah, it was really good.
It was about a waitress.

1408
01:14:53,946 --> 01:14:55,379
Yeah.

1409
01:14:56,882 --> 01:14:59,817
- I had a really good time
with you tonight.
- Did you ?

1410
01:14:59,885 --> 01:15:01,819
- Yeah.
- Really ? Me too.

1411
01:15:01,887 --> 01:15:04,822
Yeah, you're really good
at arcade games, you know.

1412
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,825
Well, I used to date
a pinball champ, not for nothing.

1413
01:15:07,893 --> 01:15:10,919
Pinball ch-- Was it, like,
a serious relationship ?

1414
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:14,932
Well, we were getting engaged,
but then two guys strangled him.

1415
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,934
Oh.

1416
01:15:18,704 --> 01:15:21,901
- You know what I like in a woman ?
- What ?

1417
01:15:21,974 --> 01:15:25,410
I like, like, um,
an old-fashioned girl, you know,

1418
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:27,411
Iike my-my mom.

1419
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:31,916
Like, a girl who likes to take care
of the house and cook and clean...

1420
01:15:31,984 --> 01:15:36,921
and doesn't mind walkin' the dogs and
doin' the lawn and that kind of thing.

1421
01:15:36,989 --> 01:15:40,288
You know what I mean ?
That's like my mom.

1422
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:42,293
Yeah.

1423
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:45,296
What do you like in a man ?

1424
01:15:45,364 --> 01:15:48,299
I like a guy
who has a good job,

1425
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:51,302
who treats me nice
and, um--

1426
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,804
Well, who's kinda
built like you.

1427
01:15:53,872 --> 01:15:56,807
Doesn't have to stuff a sock
in his jock to look good.

1428
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,308
Mm-hmm.

1429
01:15:58,377 --> 01:16:01,813
- You know what my dream is ?
- What ?

1430
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:05,975
I'm in a field, right ?

1431
01:16:06,051 --> 01:16:08,986
And, like, this hawk comes...

1432
01:16:09,054 --> 01:16:11,989
and picks me up
in his beak, right ?

1433
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:16,187
And then flies me, like, all over
the world so I see everything.

1434
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:19,196
And then, like, he flies me
out of the country...

1435
01:16:19,264 --> 01:16:22,700
and, like, we go up to
the north pole and he drops me...

1436
01:16:22,768 --> 01:16:24,702
in the snow.

1437
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:27,204
And I'm just layin' there...

1438
01:16:27,272 --> 01:16:29,206
naked.

1439
01:16:32,678 --> 01:16:34,612
What's your dream ?

1440
01:16:36,348 --> 01:16:41,547
My dream is that somebody would come
along and think that I was special,

1441
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:46,557
that, you know-- that they'd wanna
come and change my life for me.

1442
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:48,559
That's my dream.

1443
01:16:49,762 --> 01:16:51,923
You could have that.

1444
01:16:51,997 --> 01:16:54,989
- You think ?
- Yeah, I think.

1445
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:58,503
You could definitely have that,
a pretty girl like you.

1446
01:17:01,874 --> 01:17:03,808
So, you think, um,

1447
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:06,811
I'm gonna get to see you
again, Linda, or what ?

1448
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:09,313
Do you want to ?

1449
01:17:09,381 --> 01:17:11,576
A lot.

1450
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,584
I want to a lot.

1451
01:17:15,387 --> 01:17:17,321
Me too.

1452
01:17:19,825 --> 01:17:22,794
True love.
As refreshing as spring.

1453
01:17:22,861 --> 01:17:24,795
They kissed good night.

1454
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,798
And saw each other
the very next night, and the next.

1455
01:17:27,866 --> 01:17:30,801
 Hold it, everybody.
Something's coming in.

1456
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:33,804
- A bulletin !
- Uh-oh. Here comes Miss Party Pooper.

1457
01:17:33,872 --> 01:17:36,807
Tiresias, the blind seer
of Thebes.

1458
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:40,038
- I have a vision of him and Weinrib.
-  Where ?

1459
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:42,046
Wait.

1460
01:17:42,114 --> 01:17:44,082
The Acropolis.

1461
01:17:54,092 --> 01:17:56,026
Oh, Weinrib.

1462
01:17:56,094 --> 01:17:58,028
I saw your wife.

1463
01:17:58,096 --> 01:18:00,030
- Amanda. 
- You know me ?

1464
01:18:00,098 --> 01:18:03,534
Yeah. I saw her.
She was workin' late at the gallery.

1465
01:18:03,602 --> 01:18:06,537
And with her was this,
uh, Jerry Bender guy.

1466
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:09,540
Well, that's nothing. She works
with Jerry Bender. Nothing unusual.

1467
01:18:09,608 --> 01:18:11,542
- You didn't let me finish.
- Go on.

1468
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,544
Uh, they spoke
in intimate tones...

1469
01:18:13,612 --> 01:18:17,048
and then, uh, Bender rose
and laid a big wet one on her.

1470
01:18:17,115 --> 01:18:20,050
- A big we-- Bender kissed Amanda ?
- That's what I'm tellin' ya.

1471
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:23,554
Hey, you must've known somethin'
was going on for a while, huh ?

1472
01:18:23,622 --> 01:18:26,056
Yeah, I always thought
that Bender had eyes for her.

1473
01:18:26,124 --> 01:18:28,058
Now he's got eyes and hands.

1474
01:18:28,126 --> 01:18:30,617
Jesus-- Well, Amanda
didn't respond, did she ?

1475
01:18:30,696 --> 01:18:34,223
No. She just opened her mouth
very wide and stuck her tongue out...

1476
01:18:34,299 --> 01:18:37,860
as far as it was
humanly possible to go.

1477
01:18:37,936 --> 01:18:39,870
Jeez--
Are you sure ?

1478
01:18:39,938 --> 01:18:42,873
Well, hey-- Does the Trojan horse
have a wooden dick ?

1479
01:18:42,941 --> 01:18:46,377
- And then she, she pushed
her abdomen against his.
- All right, all right !

1480
01:18:46,445 --> 01:18:49,380
I got the picture !
I knew it ! I always suspected.

1481
01:18:49,448 --> 01:18:53,885
Ah, it's somethin' you don't wanna know,
but you hadda be blind not to see it.

1482
01:18:53,952 --> 01:18:57,581
- Yeah. Oh, God. I'm gonna confront her.
- Oh, no, not in front of Max !

1483
01:18:57,656 --> 01:19:01,524
No, Max-- Max has got a sleep-over date
at his friend's house.

1484
01:19:01,593 --> 01:19:04,790
- Oh.
- No. I knew it. Down deep, I knew it.

1485
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:08,299
Uh, thanks, Weinrib.
Thanks.

1486
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:11,427
Ah, thank you.
God bless you.

1487
01:19:11,503 --> 01:19:14,563
Oh, my God !
It's more serious than we thought !

1488
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,076
It's very serious.
Her marriage to Lenny is in crisis.

1489
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:22,477
With the passage of time,
even the strongest bonds become fragile.

1490
01:19:22,547 --> 01:19:25,482
Great, fellas.
It sounds like a fortune cookie.

1491
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,677
O Zeus,
most potent of gods !

1492
01:19:27,753 --> 01:19:30,688
We implore thee !
We need your help !

1493
01:19:30,756 --> 01:19:34,692
Zeus ! Great Zeus !
Hear us ! Hear us !

1494
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,694
We call out to thee !

1495
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:39,697
 Um, this is Zeus.
I'm not home right now.

1496
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:43,462
But you can leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

1497
01:19:43,535 --> 01:19:46,527
- Please start speaking at the tone.

1498
01:19:46,605 --> 01:19:50,132
Call us when you get in !
We need help !

1499
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:53,143
God, I think
I should move out.

1500
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:56,146
I-l-l can't understand this.
Wh-Wh-- This is so radical.

1501
01:19:56,214 --> 01:19:58,648
No, 'cause I can't cheat.
Jerry Bender's in love with me.

1502
01:19:58,717 --> 01:20:00,651
This is crazy.

1503
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,655
Are you telling me you're in love with
him, you're in love with Jerry Bender ?

1504
01:20:04,723 --> 01:20:07,157
I don't know.
I gotta find out.

1505
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:10,160
- What do you mean, "you don't know" ?
- I don't know !

1506
01:20:10,228 --> 01:20:13,163
What do you mean ?
Are you in love with him or not ?

1507
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:16,166
Anyway, Lenny, let's face it--
things have changed between us.

1508
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:19,169
But we can fix things.
What about Max ? Max--

1509
01:20:19,237 --> 01:20:23,173
He'll be okay. Maybe it will
be better for him with us apart...

1510
01:20:23,241 --> 01:20:26,677
- instead of together
and arguing all of the time.
- That's crazy.

1511
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:28,679
I just think that's crazy.

1512
01:20:29,815 --> 01:20:31,749
Well, l-- I can't have
this conversation.

1513
01:20:31,817 --> 01:20:34,251
I-- This is too crazy. I'm--

1514
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:37,254
- Where are you going ?
- I'm going out. I have to think.

1515
01:20:37,322 --> 01:20:40,189
I have to get
my thoughts together.

1516
01:21:07,019 --> 01:21:10,182
- I been waitin' for you, man.
- Kevin, leave me alone.

1517
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:12,951
- I'm in a very, very bad mood.
- You're in a very bad mood ?

1518
01:21:13,025 --> 01:21:16,961
How could you do this ? How could you
set me up with this stupid girl ?

1519
01:21:17,029 --> 01:21:20,965
- What are you talking about ?
- You didn't tell me she was a hooker...

1520
01:21:21,033 --> 01:21:24,969
and that she did porno films and had sex
with hundreds and hundreds of men...

1521
01:21:25,037 --> 01:21:27,972
and women and who the hell
knows what else !

1522
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,974
- I thought it would prejudice you.
- What ?

1523
01:21:30,042 --> 01:21:31,976
How did you find out ?

1524
01:21:32,044 --> 01:21:35,207
I-l call my friends up and I tell 'em
I got this girl that I wanna marry.

1525
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,808
They have me over for a few drinks and
my friend Ray puts in this sexy video.

1526
01:21:39,885 --> 01:21:42,319
But I'm not really
into pornography, you know.

1527
01:21:42,387 --> 01:21:46,153
- I look on the screen and this
actress is up there: Judy Cum.

1528
01:21:46,224 --> 01:21:49,660
Kevin, I told you she had
dramatic aspirations.

1529
01:21:49,728 --> 01:21:53,664
- I flew off the handle.
- Oh, Christ. I thought
you were a broad-minded guy.

1530
01:21:53,732 --> 01:21:58,169
I came over here and she confessed to
everything, and then l-- and I hit her.

1531
01:21:58,236 --> 01:22:01,103
- You hit her ? You hi--
- I was gonna break your neck, man !

1532
01:22:01,173 --> 01:22:04,609
- I don't believe this. You hit her ?
- I don't believe this !

1533
01:22:04,676 --> 01:22:07,611
- You hit her ? For Christ's--
- A little bit.

1534
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,115
- God.
- I called my mother. I was upset,
so then she says I should come home.

1535
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:14,118
- So I'm gonna get the hell
outta this place, man.
- I don't understand you.

1536
01:22:14,186 --> 01:22:17,121
You're a broad-minded guy.
People change. You gonna
hold her past against her ?

1537
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:20,124
- Yeah, I'm gonna--
 A porno star !
- You love her, she loves you !

1538
01:22:20,192 --> 01:22:23,127
- What are you talking about ?
- Forget it, man. It's over.

1539
01:22:23,195 --> 01:22:26,130
I told you from day one
the girl was not a virgin.

1540
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:29,133
You didn't tell me
how many times though !

1541
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:31,135
- Thanks for nothin', Lenny, man.
- Kevin !

1542
01:22:31,203 --> 01:22:33,137
Nah, man !

1543
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,645
- He hit me.

1544
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:50,745
I know, l-- I ran into him
downstairs and he--

1545
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:53,757
Oh, Jesus, look at you.

1546
01:22:53,825 --> 01:22:55,759
God, does it feel terrible ?

1547
01:22:55,827 --> 01:22:58,762
No, not really. Just my ulcer.

1548
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:02,322
Your ulcer ? Well, you know,
you shouldn't be drinking.

1549
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,836
- Hmm.
- That's the worst--
Oh, God, look at that.

1550
01:23:05,904 --> 01:23:07,838
Boy.

1551
01:23:10,075 --> 01:23:13,511
- Remember you once said
we were a couple of losers ?
- Yeah.

1552
01:23:13,578 --> 01:23:16,513
Well, I think
that's definitely true.

1553
01:23:16,581 --> 01:23:19,516
- Why ? What happened to you ?

1554
01:23:21,553 --> 01:23:23,487
Amanda left me.

1555
01:23:23,555 --> 01:23:26,991
Oh. I'm sorry, Lenny.

1556
01:23:27,058 --> 01:23:29,492
Would you like a drink ?

1557
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:31,495
Mmm. No.

1558
01:24:22,847 --> 01:24:26,442
 What's, uh-- What's--
What's the matter ?

1559
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:30,112
I-- I don't know.

1560
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,965
Was she great ?
You can tell me.

1561
01:24:42,033 --> 01:24:43,967
Was she--
Was she great in bed ?

1562
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:47,971
- A woman with all that experience.
- I don't know.

1563
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:50,974
I just know that suddenly
I really miss Amanda.

1564
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:52,976
 But wait !
See who approaches !

1565
01:24:53,044 --> 01:24:55,478
There you are !
Where have you been ?

1566
01:24:55,547 --> 01:24:57,981
I've been looking for you
all over.

1567
01:24:58,049 --> 01:25:01,746
I was just out drinking
and thinking about everything.

1568
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,754
Oh, Lenny, I'm sorry.

1569
01:25:03,822 --> 01:25:07,758
I, uh-- I was up all night
thinking how much I hurt you...

1570
01:25:07,826 --> 01:25:10,761
and how much
I'd messed us up for good,

1571
01:25:10,829 --> 01:25:13,764
and the thought
of not being with you.

1572
01:25:13,832 --> 01:25:17,268
I love you.
I don't love Jerry at all.

1573
01:25:17,335 --> 01:25:20,771
We have to put things right,
whatever has to be done.

1574
01:25:36,354 --> 01:25:38,948
she drove upstate to Wampsville and
pleaded with Kevin to take her back...

1575
01:25:39,024 --> 01:25:40,787
but to no avail.

1576
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:44,795
Anyway, on the way home she was
distraught and felt life held no hope...

1577
01:25:44,863 --> 01:25:48,458
when-- talk about
a deus ex machina--

1578
01:26:20,965 --> 01:26:24,901
So we just had a stabilizing problem
and the thing got a little off balance.

1579
01:26:24,969 --> 01:26:28,905
And then the radio went glitchy, so I
just need to get down and use a phone.

1580
01:26:28,973 --> 01:26:31,965
And thank you very much,
by the way, for stopping.

1581
01:26:32,043 --> 01:26:34,978
My name's Don.

1582
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:40,318
And so Linda married.

1583
01:26:40,385 --> 01:26:45,015
To a wonderful man who was not uptight
and repressed and accepted her...

1584
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:48,526
and even laughed at wild tales
of her promiscuous background.

1585
01:26:48,593 --> 01:26:51,027
And so our little
Greek drama comes to--

1586
01:26:51,096 --> 01:26:53,030
Wait, wait, wait.
There's more.

1587
01:26:53,098 --> 01:26:56,033
 What more, Tiresias,
blind seer of Thebes ?

1588
01:26:56,101 --> 01:26:58,535
Tell 'em just to
call me Tiresias, will ya ?

1589
01:26:58,603 --> 01:27:00,503
The handicapped
are always cranky.

1590
01:27:00,572 --> 01:27:04,008
 On that night,
Lenny Weinrib and Linda did make love,

1591
01:27:04,075 --> 01:27:07,010
Iike he was Zeus and she
was Aphrodite with an aphrodisiac.

1592
01:27:07,078 --> 01:27:09,012
Get to the point !

1593
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,311
- The point is, Linda did,
that night, conceive a child.
- No !

1594
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:15,751
Yes. She became pregnant
with Lenny's child.

1595
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:20,280
But not wanting to complicate his life
with Amanda, she never told him.

1596
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:23,293
Instead she went off
with her new husband,

1597
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:27,855
who stood behind her loyally as she
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.

1598
01:27:27,932 --> 01:27:29,866
Lenny never saw Linda again.

1599
01:27:38,943 --> 01:27:42,379
We can look around the whole store
if you'd like.

1600
01:27:44,449 --> 01:27:46,542
- Lenny !
- I don't believe this ! Wh--

1601
01:27:46,618 --> 01:27:49,212
-  Hi.
- What are you doing here ?

1602
01:27:49,287 --> 01:27:51,721
- I-l--
- I'm stunned ! What happened to you ?

1603
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:53,724
I-l'm living in Connecticut.

1604
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:56,727
I'm married and my husband Don
is a helicopter pilot.

1605
01:27:56,795 --> 01:28:00,231
You're kidding ! Where did you go ?
I searched every place for you.

1606
01:28:00,298 --> 01:28:04,234
- It's like you vanished
off the face of the earth.
- Well, we had our moment.

1607
01:28:04,302 --> 01:28:08,238
- But I knew you
would be back with Amanda.
- I can't b-- That's super.

1608
01:28:08,306 --> 01:28:11,798
- S-So y-you're married and--
This is yours ?
- Yes ! Look at her.

1609
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:15,073
Oh, God, she's adorable.

1610
01:28:15,146 --> 01:28:17,239
- She's adorable. Very, very--

1611
01:28:17,315 --> 01:28:20,250
- And is-- Is that Max ?
- This is Max. This is Max.

1612
01:28:20,318 --> 01:28:22,752
- Hello.
- Max, say hello. This is a friend.

1613
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:24,755
- Hi, I'm Linda.
- How do you do ?

1614
01:28:24,823 --> 01:28:27,917
What a handsome boy.
Amanda must be very beautiful.

1615
01:28:27,992 --> 01:28:31,428
And she's-- You've gotta have
a very handsome husband,

1616
01:28:31,496 --> 01:28:33,430
'cause she has a great face.

1617
01:28:33,498 --> 01:28:36,433
I'm stunned.
I don't know what to say. I'm, I'm--

1618
01:28:36,501 --> 01:28:40,437
- Lenny, it's so great to see you.
- You too. You're okay ? Everything--

1619
01:28:40,505 --> 01:28:42,939
Yeah. I'm really good.

1620
01:28:43,007 --> 01:28:44,941
Thank you for everything.

1621
01:28:45,009 --> 01:28:46,943
Oh-- I-l--
I'm speechless.

1622
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:50,447
I-l-- I gotta go.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late.

1623
01:28:50,515 --> 01:28:54,781
- It was great to see you.
- It was great to see you. Great.

1624
01:28:54,853 --> 01:28:57,788
- But they have each other's child.

1625
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,790
And they don't know.

1626
01:28:59,858 --> 01:29:02,725
Yes. Yes. Isn't life ironic ?

1627
01:29:02,794 --> 01:29:04,728
Life is unbelievable.

1628
01:29:04,796 --> 01:29:08,493
Miraculous. Sad.
Wonderful.

1629
01:29:08,566 --> 01:29:10,864
Yes, this is all true !

1630
01:29:10,935 --> 01:29:12,960
And that's why we say:
