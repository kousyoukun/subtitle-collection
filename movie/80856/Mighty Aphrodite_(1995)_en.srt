1
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,056
Woe unto man.

2
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:25,264
Brave Achilles,
slain in trial by blood...

3
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:28,264
for prize,
the bride of Menelaus.

4
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:32,056
And father of Antigone,
ruler of Thebes,

5
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:36,157
self-rendered sightless
by lust for expiation.

6
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:39,556
Lost victim
of bewildered desire.

7
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:42,348
Nor has Jason's wife
fared better.

8
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,740
Giving life only to reclaim it
in vengeful fury.

9
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,240
For to understand
the ways of the heart...

10
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:52,847
is to grasp as clearly the malice
or ineptitude of the gods,

11
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:56,532
who, in their vain and clumsy labors
to create a flawless surrogate,

12
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:59,639
have left mankind
but dazed and incomplete.

13
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,722
Take, for instance,
the case of Lenny Weinrib,

14
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:07,223
a tale as Greek and timeless
as fate itself.

15
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:09,722
- Lenny, let's have a baby.
- Hey!

16
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,722
A baby? Why? Because she's pregnant,
you want to have a baby?

17
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:14,907
- No. It's a great idea.
- You could raise your own middleweight.

18
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:16,907
- I don't want a middleweight.
- Flyweight.

19
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:20,223
- No, it'd be fun.
- Have you ever had children?

20
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:23,097
- No, I've never had children.
- Why not?

21
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,014
What do you mean, "why not?" 'Cause my
first wife didn't want to have a child.

22
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:28,223
- Then I never remarried really, so--
- Oh, that's great.

23
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,106
- What am I, chopped liver?
- Until now.

24
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:31,906
- Yeah?
- I never-- You didn't let me finish.

25
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,786
- No, you'd forgotten.
- Now you've changed your mind.

26
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,089
You didn't want to have a child.

27
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,098
- You should have kids.
- It's like stereo. Give him a break.

28
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,389
- You don't want a kid?
- Oh, we--

29
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,098
When we first met, she didn't like
the beach; she hated the Hamptons;

30
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,473
she didn't want to have kids; she loved the
Upper East Side, she didn't want to move.

31
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:51,574
Now suddenly she's making noise about
having a kid and moving to Tribeca.

32
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,889
- Only if the gallery moves downtown.
- Well, being pregnant is great.

33
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,426
Yeah?

34
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:57,088
I love it. You get treated
like the Queen of England.

35
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,074
- Sure.
- You say that like it's a good thing.

36
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,056
- Well, I like the pampering.
- She does like it.

37
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,056
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

38
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,056
I can't give up the time
right now.

39
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:07,365
There are too many exciting things
happening in my business.

40
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,348
- So let me ask you a question.
- What?

41
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,680
How do you plan to swing it without
being pregnant? I'm curious.

42
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,764
- Good question. Very good question.
- No, it's easy.

43
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:16,847
- We'll adopt. Oh, well.
- Mmm.

44
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,847
- Not me. I don't want to adopt.
- There you go.

45
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:20,847
- Why not? That's a good idea.
- No. No.

46
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,449
- You must be nuts. With, with my genes?
- Yeah?

47
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:25,847
- To adopt? I have award-winning genes.
- Oh, God.

48
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,431
- I want to pass them on.
- No, that's crazy. No, the--

49
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:31,348
It's for the same reason
we don't lease a car, okay?

50
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,348
- 'Cause it's pride of ownership.
- Okay.

51
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,431
- And I don't want to adopt a child.
- No. Look, I'm sorry, Lenny.

52
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:38,324
It's crazy 'cause the world
is full of needy kids.

53
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:40,324
- You know, she's right.
- That's true.

54
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:42,324
- I know, but that-- You know, but I--
- No, I mean it.

55
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,014
Why overpopulate the world when there
are thousands of parent-less kids?

56
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,348
Just because you don't want
to get morning sickness, right?

57
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:50,515
- No, it's not true.
- That's why you want to adopt a kid.

58
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:52,722
I just can't afford
to give up a year just now.

59
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:55,407
Forget it. Subject is closed.
I don't wanna--

60
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:57,806
I'd be afraid that
I might get a bad seed.

61
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,806
- Oh, you're paranoid.
- Oh, come on.

62
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:02,907
That's right! What-- You read that
in the tabloids all the time.

63
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,907
- No. A bad seed.
- That's right.

64
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:07,390
Yeah, we adopt some sweet little boy,
and then he turns 13,

65
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,098
we'd go to sleep at night,
he'd split our head open with an axe.

66
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,669
Listen, why'd you have to
go and tell him that?

67
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,014
You know Lenny's got
a vivid imagination.

68
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:13,696
It's a common occurrence.

69
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,390
I read the same paper.
What do you want me to tell you?

70
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,681
Anyway, what do you mean "he"?
Why can't we adopt a girl?

71
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,889
- We're not adopting anything. I want no sex.
- A little girl.

72
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,390
Let the guy have a short stop
or a point guard, will ya?

73
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,782
Can we get a check? Can we--
Can we please get out of here?

74
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:27,889
I'll take the check.
I'm paying tonight.

75
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,074
- Yes.
- You? I'm stunned.

76
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:31,504
You pay, you break your record.

77
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,264
You-- One more and you break
DiMaggio's record-- 56 straight.

78
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,264
That's not true.
Now, be nice.

79
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,365
Laius, proud father, speak.

80
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:42,764
I, with joy,
did have a son...

81
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,764
so fair, so clearheaded
and brave,

82
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:49,449
that I a thousand pleasures
did derive from his presence.

83
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,449
So what happens?

84
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,556
One day he kills me.

85
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:56,556
And don't you think,
he runs off and marries my wife.

86
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,556
Poor Oedipus, king of Thebes.

87
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:03,139
My son, my son
did slay unwittingly...

88
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,139
my noble husband...

89
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,032
and did, without realizing,
hasten with me,

90
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:11,032
his loving mother,
to lustful bed.

91
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:13,348
And a whole profession
was born...

92
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,722
charging sometimes
200 an hour,

93
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,931
and a 50-minute hour
at that.

94
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:21,431
And why a child now, out of left field?

95
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:24,515
One hopes it's not to fill
some growing void in their marriage.

96
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,515
Leave her be.

97
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,324
A woman's urge to motherhood
is old as the earth.

98
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,014
Children grow up;
they move out.

99
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:35,115
Sometimes to ridiculous places
like Cincinnati...

100
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,115
or Boise, Idaho.

101
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,098
Then you never see them again.

102
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,515
You'd think once in a while
they'd pick up a phone.

103
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:44,306
But is there a growing void
in the Weinrib's marriage?

104
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,306
We didn't say there was.

105
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:49,306
We're all just speculating
on possible motives.

106
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:51,306
Children are serious stuff.

107
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:55,199
Look, here's a man
who killed his father...

108
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:57,181
and slept with his mother.

109
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,699
I hate to tell you what they
call my son in Harlem.

110
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,782
Hello.

111
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:08,390
- There's a baby we can adopt.
- Are you serious?

112
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:11,598
I spoke to Carolyn Hester
and she's found an infant for us.

113
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,098
- But we have to act quickly.
- I don't want a kid.

114
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,181
Well, Lenny, you know
how hard it is.

115
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,973
And look, the baby's
one day old, totally healthy.

116
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,056
Unwed mother, no diseases.

117
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,265
And it's a boy.
You wanted a boy.

118
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,764
Amanda, I can't get
into this with you now.

119
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,056
This is not the place
to have this discussion.

120
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,847
I told Carolyn to be on the lookout.
She's experienced with adoptions.

121
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:35,348
She knows what she's doing.
It's a boy, healthy, born this morning.

122
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,740
No strings,
if we act quickly.

123
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:40,848
Le-- Look, I-- I gotta
put my foot down.

124
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,557
I-I-- If you want to
discuss this another time, we can.

125
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:48,139
But if you gotta have a fast answer,
it's definitely "no."

126
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,139
- Hi!
- Hi.

127
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,348
- You got his head?
- He's adorable.

128
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,639
Yes. Oh, God.

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,032
This is great. This kid is never
going to be a fighter, you know.

130
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:02,115
I gotta run out and get some weights
because he's really light as a feather.

131
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,431
- Yeah, perhaps I should have him back.
- Hi.

132
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,616
Yeah. Maybe you better
hold him 'cause he's crying.

133
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,616
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's crying.

134
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,014
Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

135
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,014
- That's a good boy.
- That's so great.

136
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:16,223
If there's any greatness in my hands,
let it pass into your body.

137
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:20,098
- Get a grip on yourself.
- This kid is gonna be a great kid!

138
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,098
- Oh, yeah.
- He's fabulous!

139
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,098
- You're okay now.
- What do you wanna call him?

140
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,098
- Oh, this is unbelievable. Yeah.
- Call him?

141
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,306
- Oh, wh-- what about Eric?
- Eric? The kid's not a Viking.

142
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:32,199
I wanna call him, name him,
you know, for one of my heroes.

143
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:35,390
- Like what?
- I don't know. What about Groucho?

144
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,282
- Groucho? Oh, get real.
- No, I'm serious.

145
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,990
It's a great-- You know.
I-- I don't know. What--

146
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,491
What about Phineas?
Do you like Phineas?

147
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:45,473
Phineas?
Are you joking?

148
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:48,074
Phineas is the guy who
forecloses on the mortgage.

149
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,889
I don't want to call this kid
Phineas. He's adorable.

150
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,218
That's so great. What--
What, uh-- Let me think.

151
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:54,098
Well.

152
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,074
- What about Django?
- Django?

153
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:58,598
Django, yeah. After Django Reinhardt,
the great guitar player.

154
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:02,273
- Django Weinrib?
- That's the curse of the Weinrib name.

155
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,074
It doesn't go with anything.
Nothing goes with Weinrib.

156
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:04,764
Well, okay, okay.

157
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:07,366
What about something simple
like, you know, Ben?

158
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:09,557
- You want to call him Ben Weinrib?
- Yeah.

159
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,949
What, he's gonna be
a-a-a gin rummy champion?

160
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:12,614
I mean, you know.

161
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:14,557
Yeah, well, you want to
deny your heritage? Huh?

162
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:17,140
Well, you know, I-I just want
the kid to have a great name.

163
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,639
- Yeah.
- What about Sugar Ray Weinrib?

164
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,639
Holden,
after Holden Caulfield.

165
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,973
You see, Holden is one of those things
that works if we use your maiden name.

166
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:27,677
If it's Holden Sloane,
but not Holden Weinrib.

167
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:28,639
Yeah.

168
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,931
The kid is so cute!

169
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:33,432
I can't believe he's--
What about Cole?

170
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,324
- Cole?
- Cole Weinrib. Harpo Weinrib.

171
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,931
- Harpo? No.
- How about Earl the Pearl Weinrib?

172
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:41,639
- That would be so perfect.
- Oh, God! No.

173
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,750
Okay, what-- what about Shane?
You like the name Shane?

174
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,515
Yeah.

175
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,515
- Shane's pretty.
- Shane would be okay.

176
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:50,639
On the other hand, you wouldn't want
a Supreme Court Justice called Shane.

177
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,306
Oh, Jesus.
I got it. I got it.

178
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:55,432
Brilliant.
This is so brilliant.

179
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,432
- Got it? Ready? Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:00,931
- Thelonius Weinrib.
- Max! What about Max?

181
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,014
- Max?
- Yeah, Max.

182
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,306
Max.
Oh, look how cute he is.

183
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,699
- I wanna hold him. Max is okay.
- He's so sweet. He's smiling.

184
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:10,223
- Dr. Max Weinrib. I like the name Max.
- Yeah, Max is good.

185
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:13,491
- It's simple.
- How about Senator Max Weinrib?

186
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:16,598
- Little tongue.
- Rabbi Max-- Rabbi Max Weinrib?

187
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,181
No. Maybe we should
rethink Max for a minute.

188
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:22,598
- Oh, he's so great.
- He's happy. I think he likes us.

189
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:25,098
- He looks like you.
- He looks like me?

190
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:26,598
Yeah.

191
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,574
He looks like Broderick
Crawford a little bit.

192
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:58,140
- He's so smart.
- Yeah.

193
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,348
He picks up on everything.

194
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:04,056
He's got a great personality. You know, you
wake him up, he's always smiling and upbeat.

195
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:06,056
- Like me.
- You were like that when you were a baby.

196
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:08,639
- Yeah, he's so verbal.
- Well, he's around a writer...

197
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,740
and an art expert, right?

198
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:13,265
Listen, when are you going
to move the gallery downtown?

199
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:16,348
Yeah, Mother, we don't want to get
into that discussion 'cause, you know,

200
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:20,533
I think we should move and Lenny
is a devoted Upper East-sider.

201
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:23,616
Or shall I say is opposed
to change in any form?

202
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,723
- I don't know.
- It's unbelievable.

203
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:29,324
The kid is unbelievable. I got him
trains, he put 'em together himself.

204
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:32,408
Trains? I thought you
bought him an Erector Set.

205
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,931
I got him an Erector Set, yeah.
And-- And I also got him this tricycle.

206
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:37,515
- Wait. And the whole plastic kitchen?
- Max, I got you a tricycle.

207
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,515
Lenny, you can't
buy him so much.

208
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,806
- Max, I got you a tricycle.
- Look at that!

209
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:44,806
You can't buy him so much stuff.

210
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,015
- No, no. I also got him skates.
- Skates?

211
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:50,806
Yeah. And I got a couple more things
on the way in, you know.

212
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,098
A small truck is gonna pull up
in front of the house.

213
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:56,199
- What are you gonna get next year?
- Does anyone want anything to drink?

214
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,889
Go ahead. Shoot.

215
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,889
Try again.

216
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,889
You ever think about what you want
to be when you grow up, Max?

217
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,390
Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe an interior decorator.

218
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,681
- What?
- Just kidding, just kidding.

219
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:12,282
Well, don't kid.
Here. Come on.

220
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:23,557
Okay, those go in the bedroom.
Okay, you follow me.

221
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:26,056
- Give me a hand with this.
- Why did we move?

222
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,348
What do you mean,
"Why did we move?" I told you.

223
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:31,056
We moved 'cause-- 'cause, you know,
'cause your mother wanted to move.

224
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:35,473
'Cause, you know, the art gallery
she works at has moved downtown...

225
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,764
and, you know,
she wanted to move.

226
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,241
- Here's your football.
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy?

227
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:43,265
- What is the question?
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy?

228
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,265
Who is the boss?
You have to ask that?

229
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,906
You don't know who the boss
is between me and Mommy?

230
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:47,548
No.

231
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,740
I'm the boss, okay? Mommy--
Mommy's only the decision maker.

232
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:54,723
You know, there's a difference
between, uh--

233
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:58,824
You know, Mommy-- Mommy says
what we do and, and, uh,

234
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:02,015
I have control
of the channel changer.

235
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:04,515
- Here-- Here's your crayons.
- Thanks.

236
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:07,825
We're new in the neighborhood and we want
Max to be really in the best school.

237
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:10,515
- Oh, but this is it.
- It's 'cause he's a very, very bright kid.

238
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:12,515
- I mean, really bright.
- Yeah, he's really great.

239
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:15,015
Yes, I know. I saw his test scores
and they're wonderful.

240
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:15,604
They are. Yeah.

241
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,307
I know. And he's got a
great sense of humor.

242
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:20,806
- He's a sweet kid. He's a really sweet kid.
- He's got a great personality.

243
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:23,098
Wonderful. Well, I wanted to talk
to you about a special program...

244
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:25,098
that we have
for bright students.

245
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:27,098
Really? And he qualifies?

246
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,199
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

247
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:32,491
- Certainly.
- Because-- when you hear his syntax,

248
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,515
- Hello? Oh, hi.
- It's amazing.

249
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:36,806
- Verbal skills are telling.
- His vocabulary is good, but his syntax is--

250
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,806
- Oh, great.
- He speaks like a grown-up.

251
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:40,991
- Sorry. Lenny?
- What we can do is--

252
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:43,283
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Oh, certainly.

253
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:46,890
Can we meet the Dorians tonight
for dinner at Le Cirque?

254
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:50,307
The Dorians? No. Because we have
tickets to the Edward Albee play.

255
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,764
- Listen, I can't.
- We have to. We've been waiting for so long.

256
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:56,575
You don't have to go,
but I really should go.

257
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,764
I, uh-- No.

258
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,967
This will be the second time
this week we cancelled something.

259
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:01,681
Go with Bud.

260
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:02,364
Oh, okay.

261
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:04,390
I don't want to go with Bud.
I'm not married to Bud.

262
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:06,474
Listen, go.
Can we not discuss it now?

263
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:09,056
Oh, my God!
That was embarrassing.

264
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,161
Well, just because I don't
want to have dinner

265
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:13,172
yet again with the
world's dullest couple.

266
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,449
Yeah, well, someday they may
sponsor me for my own gallery.

267
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:17,449
- I said I'd go. I'm going with you.
- Yeah?

268
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:19,449
But we got tickets to a show.
It's a shame.

269
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,241
This time try and join in and don't
sit there like some zombie all night.

270
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,557
Hey, last time I joined in,
you got angry with me.

271
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:27,931
Yeah, 'cause we were discussing
the I.M. Pei Museum, not Muhammad Ali.

272
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:31,348
Well, my mind wandered.
I can't keep on those topics.

273
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:35,223
I just don't want to be the motor power
of the Bender Gallery forever.

274
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:37,223
I want the
Amanda Sloane Gallery.

275
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:40,324
Not Amanda Weinrib,
'cause there's a euphony problem.

276
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:44,723
<i>Three, four, run.
Three, four, and break the ball.</i>

277
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:46,931
<i>- Play 88!</i>
- I hope they don't play like this.

278
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,116
<i>88! Ten-hut!</i>

279
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:51,116
What's the matter?
You seem down.

280
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,723
- No, I'm fine.
- You're fine?

281
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,723
Something's on your mind,
Lenny.

282
00:14:55,724 --> 00:15:00,098
Listen, last night I was
at one of those dinner parties again.

283
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,515
Amanda-- You know,
last week she took me to,

284
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:04,515
to Le Cirque with the Dorians.

285
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:08,390
And then last night it was
with the Grossbards on Park Avenue.

286
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:12,199
And then after that,
we were driving home...

287
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,199
and I don't know what to say.

288
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:18,307
It was Saturday night, you know, and we
stopped for a light over on Park Avenue.

289
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:22,098
I looked out the window
and I see some guy and this pretty girl.

290
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,890
And, you know,
they're walking home and, you know,

291
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,182
the guy's carrying
the Sunday papers.

292
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:30,681
It looked like they were
having so much fun, you know.

293
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:33,182
And, you know--
I don't know, I--

294
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,474
I remember how great it
used to be with me and Amanda...

295
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:38,973
in our first apartment,
you know, how romantic it was.

296
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:42,474
You know, in those days it was
just a kick shopping together...

297
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,474
or, you know, just walking
the New York streets, you know.

298
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:49,449
Then when Max came,
everything was so great, you know.

299
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:51,658
We had such terrific times.

300
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:56,182
I don't know, it's been so long since there's
been, you know, the old passion between us.

301
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:59,639
I don't know, but it was the first time
I had any of those thoughts.

302
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,366
And, you know,
they made me feel nervous.

303
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,740
You weren't too pleasant
this evening.

304
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,140
Why, 'cause I said no about going
to your boss Jerry Bender's house...

305
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,140
- in the Hamptons?
- I'll be fine.

306
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,223
I don't like the Hamptons. You know,
you used to hate the beach yourself.

307
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,432
Yeah, not the way he lives.
It's private and beautiful.

308
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,824
What are you getting
so angry about?

309
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,015
- 'Cause you won't come.
- Last time we went, I got a tick.

310
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:25,116
- A tick? Oh, wow. Big deal.
- For you, it wasn't a big deal.

311
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:27,088
But I took my pants off,
I had a black thing living in my leg.

312
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,015
Everyone will be there.

313
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:30,116
For the potential contacts,
I can put up with a few ticks.

314
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:32,116
I don't-- What contacts?

315
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:34,223
You know, it's like you're
an international spy.

316
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,116
- You got contacts all over town.
- I plan to have my own gallery, and soon.

317
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:39,806
You've changed unbelievably
over the years.

318
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,806
- Oh, yeah? You know what, Lenny?
- You used to hate that.

319
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,198
- People grow. They grow. Some people.
- It's not growth.

320
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,899
You used to hate the beach.
And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you.

321
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,098
What?

322
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:50,199
- This guy stares at you.
- Oh, no. That's nuts.

323
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:52,199
- That's seriously crazy.
- He mentally undresses you.

324
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,199
- That's his normal look.
- It's not his normal look.

325
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:55,884
If he looked at me that way
I'd hit him with a brick.

326
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:56,681
Okay. Okay, let's--

327
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,408
- Or kiss him on the lips, maybe.
- Let's drop this. Please?

328
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:08,681
Well, what do you mean,
you couldn't find it?

329
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:10,973
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, it's dark in here...

330
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:14,366
and I-- you know,
we haven't done it in a while.

331
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,765
- And then you got so angry at me.
- I wasn't angry.

332
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,765
I wasn't angry. You were fumbling
and I was getting out of the mood.

333
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:23,265
Sorry, I couldn't find it. This--
We haven't been doing it in a while.

334
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,141
Okay, let's not get into
a whole discussion here.

335
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,474
I lost my sense of direction.

336
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:28,450
I'm tired.

337
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,765
Every marriage goes through
valleys and peaks.

338
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,265
- This is like a valley.
- I don't mind going through a valley.

339
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,503
But I don't want to sink
beneath sea level here.

340
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:36,848
Lenny, why rock the boat?

341
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,241
You got a bright, beautiful wife.
You got a kid that you're crazy for.

342
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,241
I'm not gonna rock the boat.
Did I tell you about Max?

343
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:45,057
They want to put him in a special class
because he's got a high IQ.

344
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,241
Yeah, well, two bright parents.
I mean, what do you expect?

345
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,533
Yeah, whoever they are.
I mean, I still don't know.

346
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,557
It's like raising thoroughbreds.

347
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:53,723
This kid must come
from good stock.

348
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,932
He's good-looking; he's got a high IQ;
he's got a great personality.

349
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:58,640
And he's amusing.

350
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:00,932
This is not my doing.
Amanda did the whole adoption.

351
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:03,116
I just resisted.
I complained, like a jerk.

352
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:07,140
I mean, a good father, a dynamite mother
produces a kid like Max.

353
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,741
I think the father's dead,
you know.

354
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:15,033
The mother?

355
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:18,599
Don't go any further!

356
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,806
I know what you're thinking,
Lenny, and forget it.

357
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,700
How can I forget it?
The thought's been put into my head.

358
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:27,806
Oh, cursed fate. Certain thoughts
are better left unthunk.

359
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,390
I'll bet this kid
has a dynamite mother.

360
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:33,200
What makes you think he didn't
inherit everything from his father?

361
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,890
Everything? That's very unlikely.
But I'm gonna find out.

362
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:38,182
Let sleeping dogs lie.

363
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,806
- I'll bet she's great.
- Curiosity. That's what kills us.

364
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:45,307
Not muggers or all that bullshit about the
ozone layer. It's our own hearts and minds.

365
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:49,806
- I'm gonna find out.
- Please, Lenny, don't be a schmuck.

366
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:55,074
I remember the adoption vaguely because
I'm somewhat friendly with Amanda.

367
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,474
But it was not that long ago
that we-- that we did it.

368
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:00,557
I recall trying to
expedite matters for her.

369
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,265
I somehow think it was
a single parent with no father.

370
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:08,848
Right. Exactly. So-So how--
Is it possible for me to get the name--

371
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,848
I'd like the name
of the mother, if I could.

372
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,848
That remains forever
in our files.

373
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:16,848
Even if I have it, I can't give it
to you. May I ask why you want to know?

374
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,848
Yes, 'cause I-I--
I'm curious about it...

375
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,450
and I'm trying to get
all the information that I can.

376
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:24,932
So, so-- - I'm sorry. That's
all I can help you with.

377
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,241
There's no possibility
of, uh--

378
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,140
No, those are the rules.

379
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,057
I don't understand.
I'm the father of the child.

380
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,033
- I can't find out who--
- They're very firm. It's never done.

381
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:36,723
- Mm-hmm.
- How is the little boy doing?

382
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:39,140
- Good. He's great. He's fabulous.
- Yes?

383
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:42,224
- Yes.
- Say hello to Amanda.

384
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:45,723
- There's no possibility that I could--
- I'm sorry.

385
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:49,015
- There's--
- Really sorry. No way.

386
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:52,116
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

387
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,349
What are you doing, Weinrib?

388
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,057
Don't confuse me!
She's coming back in a minute.

389
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:04,450
- You are breaking the law.
- Breaking the law? There's a higher law.

390
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:07,057
I can find out
who my son's mother is.

391
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,241
The judge won't see it
that way.

392
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:11,640
Keep a lookout for me,
will you, for Christ's sake?

393
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:14,824
- Me? I'm the leader of the Chorus.
- So what? Look out.

394
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,824
Get your friend Bud
to help you.

395
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,432
Bud can't help me. You know,
Ellie and Amanda are friendly.

396
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:22,516
- Bud can't keep a secret.
- Why is it a secret? Why can't Amanda know?

397
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,723
What kind of argument am I
getting into with you? Amanda--

398
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,723
'Cause she wouldn't understand.

399
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:28,848
Oh, you're guilty because you
already have exaggerated notions...

400
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,807
about your son's mother.

401
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:34,307
It's understandable because things
are not going smoothly with Amanda.

402
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:37,015
That's why you will always
be a chorus member.

403
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:39,307
Because you don't do anything.
I act.

404
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:41,599
I take action.
I make things happen.

405
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,116
Well, hurry the hell up.
I hear footsteps.

406
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,807
I-I forgot my-- I dropped
my manila envelope. I didn't realize it.

407
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:54,391
- Oh.
- It has an important interview in it.

408
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:56,408
With-- With Roberto Duran.

409
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,890
You won't believe this,
but he's heading for Pennsylvania.

410
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,974
Of all the human weaknesses,

411
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:08,991
- obsession is the most dangerous.
- And the silliest.

412
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:13,599
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for a former tenant here,

413
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,099
- a-a-a Leslie Wright.
- Who are you?

414
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,366
I'm a friend of hers, and I believe
she lived here at one time--

415
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:20,366
a Leslie Wright?

416
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:22,765
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember
the girl who used to live here.

417
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,765
- You remember. The pretty one upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

418
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:27,182
She was only here for a while.
Who are you?

419
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:29,848
Uh, I'm just an old friend of hers
and I was trying to track her down.

420
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,949
Do you know-- Do you know
where I could find her?

421
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,949
Leslie Wailes was her name,
not Leslie Wright. Leslie Wailes.

422
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:36,949
- Leslie Wailes?
- Wailes.

423
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:39,450
- She moved to New York.
- You sure? 'Cause I have Leslie Wright.

424
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,057
Leslie-- Leslie--
Did she get married or--

425
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:44,140
I don't know.

426
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:47,140
You have no other information? You don't
know where I could find her or anything?

427
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,640
No. She was only here
for a little while. I told you.

428
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:52,057
Look, let me give you
my phone number.

429
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:55,158
If anything turns up,
I would love to locate her.

430
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:01,932
- Here. Give me that. I'll take that.
- Thank you.

431
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:04,533
- Yeah. Okay.
- You're welcome.

432
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:09,516
You have a phone call. Mr. Lamont.
Says he's from Philadelphia.

433
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:11,516
- Oh.
- You gave him your number?

434
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,408
- Mm-hmm.
- Is this Lenny Weinrib?

435
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:16,408
- Go ahead, sir.
- Hello.

436
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:19,807
Yeah, this is Bill Lamont.
Um, that woman you were looking for--

437
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,432
We asked another guy who said
her name was Leslie St. James.

438
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,599
Said she moved to New York City,
talked about becoming an actress.

439
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,200
- Leslie St. James?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

440
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:34,015
He remembered her quite well.
Leslie St. James is the name she took.

441
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:39,599
There was a Leslie St. James who was
a member of the Screen Extras Guild.

442
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,783
- So that's that.
- So what are you telling me?

443
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:45,599
That-- That she was a movie
extra or stage extra?

444
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,807
Yeah.
That's all I have.

445
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,974
So-- And there's an address,
but, uh, you know,

446
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:53,474
this book's
a few years old. So.

447
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,682
I'm looking for a--
it's-- she--

448
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:58,575
A Leslie St. James
or maybe it's a Leslie Wailes.

449
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,057
- I don't know, but I think she lived here.
- Oh, yeah, sure. I remember.

450
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:04,558
She was a tall girl.
She changed her name to Linda Ash.

451
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,057
Linda Ash?

452
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,659
Yeah, it was a fake name.
She-- She did sex movies.

453
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:11,266
- Sex movies?
- Yeah, you know, like, uh, Deep Throat.

454
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:14,659
Skin flicks.
Tall, blonde, hot.

455
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:16,640
- Very hot.
- Really? Good-looking?

456
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:19,140
Oh, great looking.
Tremendous body.

457
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:21,640
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Lenny, how are ya?

458
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:24,349
- Good. Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

459
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,849
- I need a favor.
- You got it. What?

460
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,432
You got friends in the, uh,
the adult film business, right?

461
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:33,432
My nephew knows them all.
Why?

462
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:38,325
I'm trying to locate
an actress named Linda Ash.

463
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,015
- You know which movies she did?
- No.

464
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:43,116
I was in the video store
trying to get a video,

465
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:45,325
but, you know, I get embarrassed
because my neighbor saw me there.

466
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,640
- And, you know--
- I hear ya.

467
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:49,563
Well, let me get back to you
on that one. All right?

468
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:50,514
Yeah.

469
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:55,224
You know, I don't know
why we have to do this.

470
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:57,307
I-I don't want to spend
the whole weekend at Jerry Bender's.

471
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:59,307
Oh, Lenny, please.
We've been through this.

472
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:02,015
There are lots
of important clients there.

473
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:04,015
I-- You know,
so what is this?

474
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:07,391
Meanwhile this guy's going to stare at you
the whole weekend and mentally undress you.

475
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:09,391
He is not. He's not.

476
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:12,991
God, your paranoia is rivaled
in history only by Joseph Stalin.

477
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:29,807
I'm really glad you
could make it out this weekend, Amanda.

478
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,266
There's some people around here I think
it's very important you should meet.

479
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:35,682
Oh, thanks, Jerry.
I really appreciate it. I really do.

480
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:38,266
- God, I love your sailboat.
- Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?

481
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:41,266
- Yeah.
- Sorry the waves were so choppy, Lenny.

482
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:44,765
Oh, it's no problem. I don't mind
throwing up into the wind, you know.

483
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,266
You know, we could see
that house next door at 3:00.

484
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,266
By the way, it's a great buy.

485
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:51,450
Is it possible that I could
just make one quick phone call?

486
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:53,450
- Yeah. Ken!
- Yes, Jerry.

487
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:55,765
Oh, sorry, Ken.
Can you show Lenny the private phone?

488
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,950
Sure. Come on, Lenny.
It's right over here.

489
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:00,765
The house sounds exciting.
What are they asking again?

490
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:05,242
Amanda, listen. Why don't you,
uh, spend the night here tonight.

491
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,640
- What do you say? Are you free tonight?
- Uh--

492
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:09,640
We could go for a sail.

493
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:12,640
You can't believe what the stars
look like lying on the back of a boat.

494
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,670
Yeah. No, I'd love to.
I really would love to.

495
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:15,724
Well, then, do it.

496
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:18,640
But I-- No, he
has to get back.

497
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:21,325
Really?

498
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,141
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

499
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:26,242
Hmm.

500
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:31,617
I got the skinny
on Linda Ash.

501
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:35,141
She's been in a few films.
She's no star or nothin'.

502
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:37,516
That's why you
never heard of her.

503
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:41,015
She works under
the stage name "Judy Cum."

504
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,408
Mostly, she's a hooker.

505
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,617
Uh, I got her number.

506
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:50,391
Judy Cum?

507
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,391
Oh, you never should
have looked for her.

508
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:54,599
Now I see big trouble.

509
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,099
Oh, for God's sake.
You know, you're such a Cassandra.

510
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,991
I'm not such a Cassandra.
I am Cassandra.

511
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:03,474
- That's who I am.
- I gotta check this thing out.

512
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:06,682
You'll be sorry.
I'm telling you, quit now.

513
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:10,283
Oh, and don't let Amanda talk you
into buying the house next door.

514
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:11,167
This place?

515
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:13,682
Yes! I see big problems
with beach erosion...

516
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:15,783
and a heavy mortgage.

517
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,974
Well, I love that property.

518
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:23,659
- Mm-hmm.
- We're right near everybody.

519
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,974
Doesn't mean we have to see them
all the time, but we have the option.

520
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:29,349
You-- You're not afraid
of beach erosion, right?

521
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,158
Beach erosion? Oh, come on, now.
You're such a Cassandra.

522
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:35,158
You gonna take a shower?

523
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:37,741
Yeah. Yeah, can you, uh,
fix something for dinner?

524
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:39,741
Yeah, I'll make dinner.

525
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,950
I'll make the spaghetti, okay?

526
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:44,242
There's some sauce
in the fridge.

527
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:16,224
Hello, is this Linda?

528
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:19,516
Linda, um, this is Lenny.

529
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:23,224
Uh, I-- I got your number
from Charlie Biggs.

530
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:26,516
And I wonder if, uh,
it would be possible...

531
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:29,600
that you would have some time
tomorrow afternoon.

532
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:32,200
- You shouldn't do this.
- Would you please stop it?

533
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:35,099
- You're gonna cheat on Amanda?
- I'm not cheating.

534
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,182
- I just want to see what she looks like.
- You can get a disease.

535
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,991
- Aren't you scared of AIDS?
- I'm not gonna sleep with the girl.

536
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,991
I just want to see
what she looks like.

537
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:44,600
I want to get to know her
or something. It's just--

538
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:47,890
Uh, is it possible that we
could meet at a hotel?

539
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:50,682
You're gonna rent a hotel room
with a hooker and not sleep with her?

540
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:52,765
Leave me alone.
I want to talk to her.

541
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:55,266
How about the Plaza
on 59th Street? Is that--

542
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:59,266
What are you doing?
At least pick an out-of-the-way spot.

543
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:01,266
Oh, Christ.

544
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:04,057
Um, Linda, maybe
it'd be better if I--

545
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:07,057
What about your place?
Would that be a possibility?

546
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:10,057
Uh-huh. Uh--

547
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:12,158
Hold on one second.

548
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,450
3:00.

549
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:23,141
Okay.
Um, I'll be there.

550
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:25,158
And it's Lenny.

551
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:32,349
Uh, Lenny... Gildersleeve.
Okay.

552
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,825
I can't believe this.
I can't believe it.

553
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:58,325
Hi. Are you my 3:00?

554
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:05,325
- Linda Ash?
- Yeah, that's right.

555
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:10,200
- I'm Lenny.
- Hello, Lenny. Come on in.

556
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,224
- Uh, you're-- you're Linda Ash, right?
- Yeah.

557
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:15,391
- 'Cause we spoke on the phone?
- Yeah.

558
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,783
Are you okay?
You look all white.

559
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,992
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

560
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:22,974
Do you want something to drink?

561
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,834
Maybe-- Do you have a
little Perrier or something?

562
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:25,475
What?

563
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:28,807
- Little-- Just a little tap water?
- Oh, sure. I have that.

564
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:31,765
- You're definitely Linda Ash?
- Yeah.

565
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:34,475
What's the matter?
Are you a stroke victim or something?

566
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:36,765
I told you three times.
I'm Linda Ash.

567
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,974
Oh, you have a,
a beautiful apartment.

568
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,659
- Oh, thank you. I did it myself.
- Oh.

569
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:51,057
Oh, let me show you
something I just got.

570
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,057
- That. Isn't it a pisser?
- Ohh!

571
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:55,266
Oh, yes, it's--
it's magnificent.

572
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,741
Oh. Well, yeah.
I got a great sense of humor.

573
00:30:57,766 --> 00:31:00,974
That's something you're going to find out
about me-- I'm funny and I can take a joke.

574
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:03,849
- A lot of people can't take a joke.
- Oh, no, I can.

575
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,849
- They say that about me too.
- Oh, yeah?

576
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,849
- That I have a good sense of humor.
- Oh, good!

577
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,766
Then you'll like this. Look,
I just got this. Somebody gave it to me.

578
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:14,724
As the main spring goes back and forth,
the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass.

579
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:17,087
It's a genuine antique
and it keeps perfect time.

580
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:18,141
Oh, my goodness.

581
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,640
It's a disgusting--
Ohh.

582
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:22,617
Lenny?

583
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:25,932
The water today is a little bit brown.
Would you like some Sprite instead?

584
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:28,516
- I'm feeling a little dizzy. I--
- Oh, no!

585
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,617
- Come sit down.
- No, no. I don't know why.

586
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:33,141
Usually, you know,
I'm just the picture of health.

587
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,224
- Yeah? You work out?
- Not-- Not religiously.

588
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:39,701
Oh, I'm not religious either.
Mostly, my folks were Episcopalian.

589
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:42,016
- Oh, are they? So--
- So.

590
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:45,224
So what do you do, Lenny?
Oh, no. Wait. Let me guess.

591
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:47,891
I have a great knack for guessing
what people do for a living.

592
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:50,600
- Um--
- Um, uh-- I'll tell you the truth.

593
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,701
- Rug salesman!
- You're close.

594
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:55,099
I'm-- I'm a sportswriter.
Because--

595
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,099
- Shit. I wasn't even in the ballpark.
- Well, it was not--

596
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,016
Wait. Ballpark. Sportswriter.
Get it?

597
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:02,391
I get it.

598
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:05,475
I did it with a wrestler once.
A huge, hairy guy.

599
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:08,807
You'd figure he'd be hung like a horse,
but there was very little there.

600
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:11,183
Look, could I-- could I
just get a little water?

601
00:32:11,184 --> 00:32:13,367
- I don't care if it's brown.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

602
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,266
I don't mind rust.
I'm just feeling a little--

603
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,367
T-Tell me, Linda.

604
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:22,058
Uh, uh, tell me
about yourself, Linda.

605
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:24,659
Well, what do you--
what do you want to know?

606
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:27,350
Anything.
I just want to know about you.

607
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:30,266
- Well, basically, Lenny,
- Yes?

608
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:32,849
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

609
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,950
I like drama. I study.

610
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:36,950
Yes? Uh, where--
where's that?

611
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:39,558
Paul Delucca.
Have you ever heard of him?

612
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,849
- Paul Delucca? No. But then, I wouldn't.
- Yeah.

613
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,141
- Oh, he's really well-known. He's a genius.
- I'm sure. I'm sure.

614
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:48,433
He says he thinks I'm gonna
make it big.

615
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,433
- Mmm.
- Um, I know you will.

616
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:53,724
- Yeah. Maybe you've seen some of my movies.
- That's possible.

617
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:56,325
Did you ever see
The Enchanted Pussy?

618
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:59,141
Not yet, but I-I--
It's on my list of must-see.

619
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,117
Oh, they're videotapes,
so you can rent it.

620
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:03,932
But my real ambition is
to be on Broadway in a musical.

621
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,932
- I sing.
- Do you?

622
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,033
Excuse me.

623
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:16,325
Hello? Busy. Some of them
are called John, all right?

624
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:22,433
- Was that-- Was that your husband?
- Ha-ha. Very funny.

625
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,932
No, but I mean, you have no husband,
no family, no children...

626
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,600
or anything like that?

627
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:30,600
'Cause some do.
You have a funny look on your face.

628
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:32,600
- Um.
- Did I say the wrong thing?

629
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,891
- No. Not really.
- I-- I said--

630
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:37,183
No. No, listen.

631
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,891
- What are you in the mood for, Len?
- Me? I-I, well,

632
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,099
I would like to--
You know, we can chat for a while.

633
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,391
I thought I'd get into it
slowly and, you know--

634
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:46,682
You're married, aren't you?

635
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:49,682
- How can you tell that?
- 'Cause you got that look.

636
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:51,682
That look?
Wh-What look is that?

637
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:54,766
That look like it's been a long time
since you've had a great blow job.

638
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:58,475
Oh, that look.
I-- I can understand.

639
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:01,867
- Wh-Where are you from?
- Mm, around.

640
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:04,266
What are you so interested
in me for?

641
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:06,766
- That's my fingers.
- Yes, I know.

642
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,766
- Here.
- What--

643
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,766
Pull, pull!
Pull the strings.

644
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:11,394
Pull these strings?

645
00:34:11,395 --> 00:34:13,266
Yeah, pull all the strings.
See? See what happens?

646
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,950
- I'm not so mechanical as I was.
- Oh, it's easy. Here. Pull.

647
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:18,950
- Ahh! See, it opens!
- Ohh!

648
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,141
That's amazing.
Science is-- is--

649
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,933
- Yeah.
- You, you, you-- I-I--

650
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:27,034
Oh. Really. Well.

651
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:31,034
Uh, you're a very attractive woman,
a very beautiful young woman.

652
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,034
Oh, thank you, Lenny.

653
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,034
Well, you're cute too.
So, what do you say?

654
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:38,534
- You wanna go inside, take a shower?
- A shower?

655
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,225
- You can study me up close and personal.
- Oh! Oh.

656
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,724
No, see, I bathed already.

657
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:45,724
You got lipstick on my fi--

658
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,016
- Mmm, you smell clean. Mmm.
- Thank you. Well--

659
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:51,516
As I say, I'm basically--
My ear.

660
00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:54,016
- You're sensitive, huh?
- It's my weak spot, in my ear.

661
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:56,641
Oh. Okay.

662
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:59,409
A little nibbling
makes me... go crazy.

663
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:01,724
Okay, Len.
Are you nervous?

664
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,708
I-- No. But yes, I am nervous,
to tell you the truth.

665
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:05,801
You do look that way.

666
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,700
I've never--
I-I've never done this, actually.

667
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:09,616
Oh, okay. That's all right.
I'll take it slow.

668
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:10,391
This is-- I-I--

669
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:12,391
Oh. Okay. I--

670
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:14,600
Um, incidentally, Len,

671
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,682
I think I should tell you
ahead of time I-I get 200 dollars.

672
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,891
It's no problem.
No problem.

673
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:22,475
- Just a-- Just a show of good faith.
- Thanks, Lenny. Wow!

674
00:35:22,476 --> 00:35:24,475
You're really sweet, Len.

675
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:26,600
Put it down
as a religious contribution.

676
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:30,075
No, but seriously, you want to know
why I liked you right from the start?

677
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,576
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm always attracted to losers.

678
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:35,766
Losers?
You think I'm a loser?

679
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,974
Yeah.
You got no confidence.

680
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:39,974
It's sweet.
I like that in a man.

681
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:43,659
I can't stand those johns who come here
and throw down a couple of hundred...

682
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,367
and whip out a big dick
and wave it all over the joint.

683
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:50,159
Oh, I-- I wouldn't do that
even if I wanted to because I'll just--

684
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:52,849
Ah, shit!

685
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,950
Hello. Oh, hello,
Angela.

686
00:35:55,975 --> 00:36:00,058
Oh! Oh, wow!
Ha-ha!

687
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:03,350
Oh, God, thank you
for thinking of me.

688
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:05,350
Yeah, that's great.

689
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:09,058
Okay.
Yeah, well, I'll see you at 10:00.

690
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,242
Bye.

691
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:14,558
I just got a small part
in an Angela Dawson movie.

692
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,159
I get to do it with her!

693
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:21,117
I don't understand you.

694
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:23,724
If you're-- If you're serious
about being a Broadway actress,

695
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,117
what are you wasting your time
with all this porn for?

696
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,618
What's it to you?
It's good experience.

697
00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:31,618
How? Making it with a woman in front
of the camera is good experience?

698
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:34,117
That's gonna get you closer
to be a Broadway star?

699
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:36,618
- What are you getting all mad for?
- I'm not mad.

700
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:39,701
I just think it's crazy.
You're an attractive young woman.

701
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:42,201
You know, what are you--
You don't have to live like this, Linda.

702
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:44,201
- What are you, my pastor?
- This is crazy!

703
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:46,891
You take money from guys
and you perform all these acts.

704
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:49,600
You know, you could be--
Hey, I'm talking to you.

705
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:51,992
- You could have a family.
- Hey, let go of me!

706
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:54,327
You could have a husband
and a child or something.

707
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:55,507
All right. No. Hey!

708
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:57,682
Stop. Stop it now! Stop!

709
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,183
- Listen. I don't like possessive men.
- I'm not possessive.

710
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,700
You come in here, you don't
want to do anything with me.

711
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:02,475
You're telling me what to do.

712
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:04,475
- I want to talk.
- Do you want to do it or not?

713
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:06,891
- I want to talk. I paid you, I want to talk.
- Oh, no. Okay.

714
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,891
- I bought the time.
- Then you get your money back.

715
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,974
- I'm giving it back. Refund.
- No, keep the money.

716
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,974
- Let's go. No.
- I bought the time!

717
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:15,365
Hey, stop it. No,
I'm giving it back and you're leaving.

718
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,382
Why can't I talk?

719
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:18,367
Get out!

720
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:31,682
Daddy, why are you
staring at me like that?

721
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,849
Come here.

722
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,950
You know why I'm
staring at you?

723
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:38,558
I'm staring at you
'cause I can't believe it.

724
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,058
Because you're so bright
and you're such a great kid.

725
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,766
Come on, Max.
Now it's time for bed.

726
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:47,141
Come on. Okay.
Time for beddums.

727
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,849
Ready? The kid's getting heavy.

728
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,933
- He can walk, you know.
- Yeah. Okay. Can you walk?

729
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:55,933
Poor Weinrib! Turn back.

730
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:59,724
Don't meddle any further.
Accept the truth.

731
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:02,724
I see disaster.
I see catastrophe.

732
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:05,433
Worse, I see lawyers.

733
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:08,034
But wait, a messenger.

734
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:12,141
I come from the midtown area
where Lenny Weinrib,

735
00:38:12,142 --> 00:38:14,909
tortured by passions
too overwhelming to regulate,

736
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:17,409
did indeed call
this little hustler on the phone...

737
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:20,016
in earnest attempt
to see her again.

738
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:22,201
At first he wrestled
with his drives,

739
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:24,201
trying to master a curiosity...

740
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:27,600
not slaked by this initial meeting,
but only whetted by it.

741
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:32,392
His thirst to know this woman more
did inexorably provoke him to call her.

742
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,683
Nervous and confused, at first
he only got her answering machine.

743
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:38,992
Then, at fifth try,
she picked up the phone herself.

744
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:43,308
Painful to relate that she thought he was
nuts and did not want to meet him nohow.

745
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:47,076
"Stop bothering me, creep,"
was her cutting declaration.

746
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:49,284
Then she used the "F" word.

747
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:52,867
Agonized, he called again, offering
her abundant financial compensation...

748
00:38:52,892 --> 00:38:55,100
just for a brief chat.

749
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:58,367
But she bade him get off her back
and slammed the phone down.

750
00:38:58,393 --> 00:39:02,475
Finally, in doldrums mixed
with much anxiety,

751
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:04,475
he stood watch
outside her apartment...

752
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:08,950
and waited until such a time as he did
spot her heading for the laundromat.

753
00:39:18,642 --> 00:39:21,451
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, don't get upset or anything.

754
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:23,534
- I just thought we could have lunch.
- Why me?

755
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,605
I'll pay for your time.
I just want to speak to you.

756
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:26,267
All right!

757
00:39:26,268 --> 00:39:29,267
What are you, some kind
of fucking pervert who--

758
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:32,141
Leave me alone. I'm not--
I'm not one of those psychopaths...

759
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:34,141
that kills prostitutes,
I promise you.

760
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:37,534
- Why would you ever say something like that?
- I'm joking. I'm joking.

761
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,724
Listen, in my work, I have to keep
an eye out for strange individuals.

762
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:43,933
- Okay.
- I knew a girl that got killed.

763
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,225
All right. Hey,
I got you some flowers. Here.

764
00:39:46,226 --> 00:39:49,225
I got you some flowers.
Let's have lunch. I'll pay for it.

765
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:52,825
I'll pay for your time.
I just wanna talk to you.

766
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:56,641
So then my mother married
my third father.

767
00:39:56,642 --> 00:39:59,100
I mean, I don't know if she
married him, but he moved in.

768
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:01,909
We didn't get along.
He was a disgusting drunk.

769
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:05,016
What about your hereditary
father? Your actual, actual--

770
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:08,808
Oh, he was a drug pusher
and he was also a car thief.

771
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:11,992
He picked pockets and, you know,
he burgled and stuff.

772
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:13,152
And he was an epileptic.

773
00:40:13,153 --> 00:40:15,600
Uh-huh. You haven't
left anything out, right?

774
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:18,392
- Mail fraud!
- Oh, mail fraud. Oh, okay, yeah.

775
00:40:18,393 --> 00:40:20,392
- That's what they caught him on.
- Uh-huh.

776
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:22,891
Hey, you got an appetite
like a lumberjack.

777
00:40:22,892 --> 00:40:24,891
Oh. Well, thank you.

778
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,891
Oh, it's fine.
Eat all you want.

779
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:31,100
I'm very hungry, actually.
Um, so then I ran away when I was 14.

780
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:32,600
Mm-hmm.

781
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:35,267
And I went away with
this musician named Johnny.

782
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:38,183
And it was terrible because
we fought all the time, Lenny.

783
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:40,559
Finally,
he committed suicide.

784
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,867
And for years I thought it
was because of my cooking.

785
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:44,891
He always hated my clam sauce.

786
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:48,559
And so then I kicked around
from Chicago, Philadelphia, you know.

787
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,559
All over the place.
And I ended up here.

788
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,850
You never thought of
just getting a regular job?

789
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,951
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.
No, I did things.

790
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:58,850
I waited on tables. I worked
in a massage parlor. I did phone sex.

791
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:02,350
Now and then I would, you know, turn a
few tricks in order to make some dough.

792
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:06,034
And one day my friend Susie calls me and
she asks me if I want to be in a film.

793
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:08,850
Something called Snatch Happy.
And I said, "Sure."

794
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:11,534
And I remember
I was very nervous...

795
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,933
because I'd never done it in front of
people with a camera before, you know.

796
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:18,141
And so there I am on the first day,
on the set.

797
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,825
And there's this guy
fucking me from behind, right?

798
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:24,517
And there's these two huge guys dressed
like cops in my mouth at the same time.

799
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:26,825
And I remember
thinking to myself,

800
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,742
"I like acting. I wanna study."

801
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:34,016
Yes, well.
It's a-- It's a--

802
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:37,100
That's one way
of getting into the profession.

803
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,100
Um, tell me about
your family a little bit.

804
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:41,701
What? I told you already.
You could write a book by now.

805
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:43,808
But, but were there
any unusual members?

806
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,292
Very bright ones or brilliant
or talented or something.

807
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:47,100
Mmm! Yes!

808
00:41:47,101 --> 00:41:49,201
- I'm sorry. There was.
- Mmm.

809
00:41:49,226 --> 00:41:51,308
My father's brother
was supposed to be a genius.

810
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,517
I never met him, but everybody
said he was brilliant.

811
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:54,525
Really? What did he do?

812
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:57,299
He was a serial rapist.
He spent his whole life in jail.

813
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:00,284
But if he had gone straight,
he might have been very good in math.

814
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,392
- Good in math. Well, that's--
- Yeah.

815
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:04,392
I think I got
my intelligence from him,

816
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:06,784
because everybody else in the family
is all slugs and lowlifes.

817
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:09,284
- I'm the only one with any ambition.
- Are you?

818
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:11,766
And you never-- never
had a drive to get married?

819
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:13,766
What for?
They're all assholes.

820
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,766
One of them used to
beat me up.

821
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,766
Another one used to fuck
my best friend when I wasn't looking.

822
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:21,183
- It was sickening.
- Really.

823
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:23,975
And-- And let me
ask you this.

824
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:27,058
At any point in your life
did you ever think, like,

825
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:29,576
"Maybe I'd like
to have a child"?

826
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,850
Um, I-I did have a child once.

827
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:38,451
- Did you?
- Ah, it was a sad story.

828
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:40,743
I'll tell you some other time
when I know you better.

829
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,159
If I ever know you better.

830
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:47,058
Are you free this afternoon?

831
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:49,434
- Why?
- You have some free time this afternoon?

832
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:51,725
- Are you finally in the mood, Lenny?
- No, no, no, no, no.

833
00:42:51,726 --> 00:42:53,850
I wanna--
I have an assignment.

834
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:57,035
But I thought you might wanna come
with me, 'cause I think you'll enjoy it.

835
00:43:03,226 --> 00:43:06,725
I'm gonna bet on a horse,
and if it wins you can keep the dough.

836
00:43:06,726 --> 00:43:09,434
Here's one. "Eager Beaver."

837
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:11,434
I once did a film
called Beaver Patrol...

838
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:14,142
about these Boy Scouts who find
drunk Girl Scouts in the woods.

839
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:16,546
And they take them into a cabin
and they reach into their packs

840
00:43:16,547 --> 00:43:17,925
and they pull out these dildos.

841
00:43:17,926 --> 00:43:20,225
- And then--
- All right, all right. Okay, we'll--

842
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:22,201
Y-You're sure you want
to bet on Eager Beaver?

843
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:24,409
- 'Cause it's a 60-to-1.
- Oh, yeah. No, I know it's the one. No!

844
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,701
- But it's 60-to-1.
- It's a sign. I know it's gonna work.

845
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:28,808
All right, all right.
Famous last words.

846
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,891
- You know.
- I got a hunch.

847
00:43:30,892 --> 00:43:32,595
You got a hunch. Okay.
Sure, we'll bet on it.

848
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:33,183
Yeah.

849
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:35,683
Okay. So if he wins,
how much do I make?

850
00:43:35,684 --> 00:43:38,891
At 60-to-1?
Uh... you make, uh, $3,000.

851
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:42,183
Oh, my God! I could get that blue
chinchilla coat that I wanted!

852
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:44,183
- You could get anything you want.
- I could get a Jacuzzi.

853
00:43:44,184 --> 00:43:47,392
- Except he's not gonna win.
- Oh, no, I know what I could do, Lenny!

854
00:43:47,393 --> 00:43:49,683
- Oh, my God! This is great.
- Mm-hmm.

855
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:52,076
All right. You know,
I hope-- I hope you're right.

856
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:55,183
There's a reason the horse is 60-to-1,
though. He's probably got polio.

857
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:57,867
Oh, no, no. No.
This is a sign.

858
00:43:57,892 --> 00:43:59,975
- All right.
- My luck is gonna change.

859
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:02,297
So is your real name Linda?
Is that your actual name?

860
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:03,475
I use a lot of names.

861
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:07,350
My born name is Leslie, but I like
to use names that have nice meanings.

862
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:09,350
You know, like Mary,
for the Virgin Mary.

863
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:11,951
Or Angel or Linda,
which means "pretty" in Spanish.

864
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:14,951
- But my screen name's Judy Cum.
- Mm-hmm.

865
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:17,451
Well, lucky there's not a horse
with that name in the race...

866
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:19,451
- 'cause we'd bet on him.
- Oh, no, no, no.

867
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:21,766
I mean, my attorney friend
would take that under advisement.

868
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:24,142
- Mm-hmm.
- I got exclusive rights to that name.

869
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:26,267
All right, all right,
all right. Yeah.

870
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:28,267
So let me ask you a question.

871
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:31,142
Are you ever frightened that when a guy
comes over your house and pays you...

872
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:34,142
that he's gonna maybe,
like tie you up and kill you?

873
00:44:34,143 --> 00:44:36,641
Oh, no. I always
get paid in advance.

874
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:39,434
Come on.

875
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:41,725
- Eager Beaver. He's paying.
- Paid in advance? That's--

876
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:43,725
Lenny.

877
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:45,725
<i>- They're coming down to the finish.</i>
- Come on, Beaver!

878
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,933
<i>- It's Autumn Daisy and Enmity.</i>
- Come on! Catch up!

879
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:50,309
<i>- Eager Beaver continues to drop back.</i>
- Oh, shit! Oh, Beaver!

880
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,410
<i>- Autumn Daisy and Enmity. It's close.</i>
- Beaver! Come on, Beaver!

881
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:55,808
- Oh! Beaver!
<i>- It's Autumn Daisy by a head.</i>

882
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:58,017
- Shit! Last?
<i>- Enmity finishing second...</i>

883
00:44:58,018 --> 00:45:00,309
<i>- and Lower The Flag finishing third,</i>
- Stupid horse got-- Damn it!

884
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,490
<i>Followed by Marcy's Pride,
True Blue Crew, Classic Alert,</i>

885
00:45:02,506 --> 00:45:03,434
I had it spent already!

886
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:05,808
- I know. Relax, relax. Relax, will ya?
- and Eager Beaver was last.

887
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:08,808
You know, it's not so terrible.
I told you it was a long shot.

888
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:11,100
- I never have any luck. Never!
- All right.

889
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:13,601
I never won a fucking thing
in my entire life! Nothing! Never!

890
00:45:13,602 --> 00:45:17,183
Will you stay calm?
You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.

891
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:20,309
If it's the money,
I'll lend you the money.

892
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,309
- I can help you.
- No, it's not the money, Lenny.

893
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,683
I don't care about the money.
I just wanted to win so badly.

894
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:28,892
What do you want to win for?
We're just out here having a good time.

895
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,183
- You gotta--
- 'Cause I wanted to impress you.

896
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:34,576
Impress me? What? You know,
you're not running in the race.

897
00:45:34,602 --> 00:45:36,867
What-- You don't
have to impress me. I'm--

898
00:45:36,893 --> 00:45:39,475
Yeah, but I wanted to show you
I could pick a winner.

899
00:45:39,476 --> 00:45:43,058
Hey. Listen, my horse
didn't win either, you know.

900
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:45,058
Come on, you--
you do impress me.

901
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:48,766
You're attractive, you're--
you're quick, you have a lot of energy.

902
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,595
You're obviously a
state-of-the-art fellatrix.

903
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:51,267
What?

904
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:54,058
So-- Nothing, nothing.
I'm impressed. Take--

905
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:56,058
- Lenny, don't say "nothing."
- I'm impressed.

906
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:58,475
- You think I'm stupid?
- I don't think you're stupid, no.

907
00:45:58,476 --> 00:45:59,116
No?

908
00:45:59,117 --> 00:46:00,975
You know, I think you do a
stupid thing with your life.

909
00:46:00,976 --> 00:46:02,975
But I told you that already.

910
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:05,434
Well, I don't understand
why it matters so much to you.

911
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:08,742
Hey, come on. We'll stay for one more
race, and this time I'll bet for you.

912
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,933
- Yeah?
- Let me make the bet. Yeah. N-No. Come on.

913
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,449
We'll just go to the window
and I'll make one bet.

914
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,049
All right.

915
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:15,142
Please don't pick one
that runs second...

916
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:17,225
- 'cause I want a winner, okay, Len?
- Yeah. Hey.

917
00:46:17,226 --> 00:46:20,742
You know, they give these horses saliva
tests. I can't guarantee anything.

918
00:46:24,226 --> 00:46:27,017
- I gave you your winnings, right?
- Yeah.

919
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:30,808
That was a great race.
Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.

920
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:33,808
Well, he was a heavy favorite, you know,
and I bet him to come in third.

921
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:36,725
- At least this way you get something.
- Yeah.

922
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:38,725
So, you wanna come in?

923
00:46:38,726 --> 00:46:42,017
I gotta go home.
I got a wife and kid. You know, I can't.

924
00:46:42,018 --> 00:46:46,100
You know, you only talk about me.
You never talk about yourself.

925
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:49,601
It's late for me. You know,
I had a great time, but I gotta go.

926
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:51,892
I feel I owe you a great fuck.

927
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,993
Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs,
rest your ulcer, stay in tonight.

928
00:46:56,018 --> 00:46:58,683
I can't stay in.
I got six dates.

929
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,784
Six dates.
Slow night for you, right?

930
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:04,975
I wish I had the penicillin concession
in your apartment. I'd-- I'd be wealthy.

931
00:47:04,976 --> 00:47:07,784
All right.
So, you're gonna call me again?

932
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:10,392
Am I gonna call you again?
Yeah, I'll call you. Don't worry.

933
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:12,766
- You promise?
- I will. I'll call you again.

934
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,975
Okay. I had a great time.

935
00:47:14,976 --> 00:47:16,975
- Bye.
- Okay.

936
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:33,559
- Congratulations.
- Thirty-five years.

937
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,559
- I never thought we'd make it.
- You and Amanda...

938
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,559
have a way to go,
but you'll make it.

939
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,742
- You guys look so young, both of you.
- Yeah, you do.

940
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:41,742
Well, we've kept
each other young.

941
00:47:41,768 --> 00:47:44,434
Your mother could be your sister,
and you could be brother and sister.

942
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:45,342
You could be my-- yes.

943
00:47:45,343 --> 00:47:47,509
I don't know where that
puts me, but anyway--

944
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:53,826
She looks so beautiful,
doesn't she, Lenny?

945
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:56,034
To me, she always looks beautiful.

946
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:58,034
I just always find her great. And you--

947
00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:01,017
When I said sisters before, I mean it.
You guys look so great.

948
00:48:01,018 --> 00:48:03,618
And it's a wonder,
with all the responsibility...

949
00:48:03,642 --> 00:48:06,017
she has opening
her new gallery.

950
00:48:06,018 --> 00:48:08,641
- It's a lot of work.
- What new gallery? A new gallery?

951
00:48:08,642 --> 00:48:09,817
No, I didn't tell you 'cause, you know,

952
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,309
I don't know until it's
a hundred percent definite.

953
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,725
- Well, did I say the wrong thing?
- But it's not.

954
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:16,309
- No, sure. No, I just--
- It's a hundred percent definite.

955
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,434
You're so insecure.
It's happening.

956
00:48:18,435 --> 00:48:22,017
Oh, excuse me.

957
00:48:22,018 --> 00:48:24,517
- What is the story on this?
- It looks like I have the backing,

958
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:26,493
but it's not totally definite.

959
00:48:26,518 --> 00:48:28,493
- That's why I didn't say anything.
- Your mother said it was definite.

960
00:48:28,518 --> 00:48:30,702
Yeah, well. It seems as if
I do have the backing.

961
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:33,392
And there is this wonderful space
on Vesey Street. You know it?

962
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:35,683
- Vesey? Yeah, I know it.
- Yeah, down in Soho.

963
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:39,184
And it looks like, you know,
we think we can get it.

964
00:48:39,185 --> 00:48:42,100
The Dorians are putting in
some money, but I--

965
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:44,100
- Well, don't look so happy about it.
- I am happy!

966
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:47,392
I'm very happy for you, but it's
the first I'm hearing of it, you know.

967
00:48:47,393 --> 00:48:49,892
- And for your mother to tell me--
- Yeah, well, look.

968
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,577
I realize that for a time I'm going
to be busier than usual...

969
00:48:52,602 --> 00:48:54,892
and I know that's
a sore point,

970
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:57,892
but, you know, it'll be only
'til it gets off the ground.

971
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,392
- Hey, I'm happy for you. I re--
- You are?

972
00:49:00,393 --> 00:49:02,065
Yes. I just would have
liked to have known it.

973
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:02,767
Are you sure?

974
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,621
The Amanda Sloane Gallery.
I think that it's great.

975
00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:05,675
Yeah, on Vesey Street.

976
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:09,160
Believe me.
I haven't even told Jerry Bender yet.

977
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:12,660
"You've got a fine right, you have,
after the way you treated Mother,

978
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,951
"after the way you treated us all!

979
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:18,351
"A fine right you've got to come back
in here in your best country manner...

980
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:22,059
"and strike attitudes
and make stands...

981
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,767
"and criticize my fiance
and give orders...

982
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:27,059
"and mess things up generally
as if you'd done--

983
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,142
"Well, I can't help it.
It's sickening!

984
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:32,160
As if he'd done nothing at all!"

985
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,142
Well?

986
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:39,142
What do you think?

987
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,933
- About what?
- About me.

988
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:45,142
- You think I'm any good?
- Yes, it's fine.

989
00:49:45,143 --> 00:49:47,142
I-- You know, you're asking
the wrong person.

990
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:49,225
I don't know that much about acting,
to tell you the truth.

991
00:49:49,226 --> 00:49:51,225
Oh, I can tell
you're not too impressed.

992
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:54,517
No, no, no. I just thought, you know,
it's a very odd part for you to choose.

993
00:49:54,518 --> 00:49:55,283
Why?

994
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,517
Well, you know, 'cause
it's The Philadelphia Story.

995
00:49:57,518 --> 00:50:00,601
- But I lived in Philadelphia.
- What has that got to do with it?

996
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:05,100
- I know the city.
- What? You pick a part like this--

997
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:08,517
You should get something closer to yourself.
It wouldn't be such a struggle.

998
00:50:08,518 --> 00:50:10,702
- You know.
- Well, what part should I play?

999
00:50:10,726 --> 00:50:13,184
You know-- I don't know.
Something closer.

1000
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:15,892
Clint Eastwood doesn't play
a meek little hairdresser.

1001
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:18,184
Well, I could play a hairdresser.

1002
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,601
I-I used to--
I used to do it a lot.

1003
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,577
I wanted to be one.
I was very good at it.

1004
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,184
- So why'd you give it up?
- Well, I don't know.

1005
00:50:25,185 --> 00:50:27,184
One thing led to another.

1006
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:29,309
You know, my aunt worked
in a beauty parlor for years.

1007
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,975
She loved it.

1008
00:50:31,976 --> 00:50:34,975
Wait. You mean
not be an actress?

1009
00:50:34,976 --> 00:50:37,767
Well, an actress
is a very tough life, you know.

1010
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,660
- But a hairdresser could always make a buck.
- A buck?

1011
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,559
A buck! An honest buck.
No beatings, no AIDS.

1012
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,559
You can meet somebody
that you, you know--

1013
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,850
You can get a family, have a real life,
someone that cares for you.

1014
00:50:48,851 --> 00:50:50,650
Hey!

1015
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:53,559
Now, don't you think that I want
to meet somebody and get married...

1016
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,850
and get the hell
out of the rat race?

1017
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:59,059
I would like to move away
and become a mother and just raise kids.

1018
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,059
I don't even want
to be a hairdresser.

1019
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,534
If Clint Eastwood wants
to be a hairdresser, just let him.

1020
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:07,434
You missed the point. Clint Eastwood
doesn't want to be a hairdresser.

1021
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:10,059
I had a kid, Lenny,

1022
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,660
and I gave him up
for adoption.

1023
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,660
It's the sorriest thing
I ever did in my entire life.

1024
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,118
There's not a day
that doesn't go by that I don't...

1025
00:51:23,143 --> 00:51:26,118
wake up thinking about him.

1026
00:51:26,143 --> 00:51:28,517
Now some lucky family
has him.

1027
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:32,035
I just hope to God that they're
taking good care of him.

1028
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:36,100
Why'd you give him up?

1029
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:39,017
I don't know. I was--
I was all confused.

1030
00:51:39,018 --> 00:51:42,226
I had no dough. I-I--
I didn't know what to do.

1031
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:44,392
I--

1032
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,392
I didn't even know
who the father was.

1033
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:49,201
It could've been any one
of a hundred guys.

1034
00:51:49,227 --> 00:51:52,201
Welcome to planet Earth,
thanks to a broken condom.

1035
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:58,493
Gee. That's tough.

1036
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,285
Um.

1037
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:05,975
What about your kid?

1038
00:52:05,976 --> 00:52:09,184
Max? M-M-Ma-- You know.
Max is the greatest.

1039
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:11,392
- Yeah?
- Well, sure.

1040
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:14,184
Do you have a picture of him?

1041
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:17,892
- A picture of Max?
- Yeah. I'd like to see him.

1042
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:22,493
Uh, yeah, I guess I--

1043
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,852
He's very sweet.

1044
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:40,452
You're very lucky.

1045
00:52:40,477 --> 00:52:42,476
<i>With Amanda, it was fate.</i>

1046
00:52:42,477 --> 00:52:44,642
With Linda, it's hybris.

1047
00:52:44,643 --> 00:52:49,142
His drive to find out, and now,
to change her life, to control her.

1048
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:51,226
- Yes.
- Danger.

1049
00:52:51,227 --> 00:52:54,725
Wait. Wait,
I see... danger.

1050
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:58,434
Hey, wait a minute. I don't have
any interest in controlling her.

1051
00:52:58,435 --> 00:53:00,518
I'm doing this for Max's sake.

1052
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,327
When the kid gets older, inevitably
he's gonna trace his mother.

1053
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:06,619
And, you know, I'd be happier...

1054
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:10,017
if she was married and a--
a hairdresser, you know,

1055
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:13,017
rather than the star
of The Enchanted Pussy.

1056
00:53:13,018 --> 00:53:17,017
Danger! I see horrible,
horrible danger!

1057
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:20,809
- Terrible danger!
- Hey, I can handle myself emotionally.

1058
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,392
Not emotional danger,
physical danger.

1059
00:53:24,393 --> 00:53:27,892
I see a bald man.
He has a lead pipe.

1060
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:30,410
He's breaking your kneecaps.

1061
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:39,392
So, so, uh, what did, uh--
How did Jerry Bender take it...

1062
00:53:39,393 --> 00:53:41,975
when you said that
the decision was final?

1063
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:44,076
You know what?
He was amazing.

1064
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:48,184
I thought he'd be upset, but no,
he was very excited and very supportive.

1065
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:51,101
No, he's being--
He was absolutely great about it.

1066
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,184
Anyway, I-I'm calling to say
I can't make dinner tonight.

1067
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:56,101
Oh, you're kidding.
It's gonna be great.

1068
00:53:56,102 --> 00:54:00,368
Everybody in the Madison Square Garden
organization's gonna be there.

1069
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:02,368
Look, there's no way
I can get away.

1070
00:54:02,394 --> 00:54:05,476
The architects are here
and the Dorians are in town from Paris.

1071
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:09,351
And, uh, the architects fly back
to Milan tonight. I can't.

1072
00:54:09,352 --> 00:54:12,767
All right, well.
I'll tell you what.

1073
00:54:12,768 --> 00:54:15,351
What I'll do is, I'll go home
and I'll put Max to sleep.

1074
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,476
I'll spend a little time
there and then--

1075
00:54:17,477 --> 00:54:19,850
Then-- Oh.

1076
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:22,850
Uh, look, let me--
I'm gonna call you back. I got, uh--

1077
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:25,267
I'm gonna call you back.
Oh, geez.

1078
00:54:25,268 --> 00:54:27,267
<i>- It's just against our policy--
- I understand!</i>

1079
00:54:27,268 --> 00:54:29,267
<i>- If you wanna wait right here.
- Whatever.</i>

1080
00:54:29,268 --> 00:54:31,226
<i>- Lenny, there's someone here to see you.
- Lenny!</i>

1081
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,850
<i>- Uh, yes. Uh, c-c-come in. Come in.
- Lenny!</i>

1082
00:54:33,851 --> 00:54:35,795
Th-This is Miss Gildersleeve.
She's an acquaintance.

1083
00:54:35,796 --> 00:54:36,550
You know her?

1084
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,035
- Gildersleeve?
- Yes, Miss-- Miss Gildersleeve.

1085
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,118
We're old-- It's okay. It's okay.
I'll be in here.

1086
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:44,642
- You don't need anything?
- No, no! I'm fine.

1087
00:54:44,643 --> 00:54:46,642
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

1088
00:54:46,643 --> 00:54:49,309
- What are you doing here?
- Lenny? Lenny, I got to talk to you.

1089
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,725
Ricky threatened to-- to--
to hurt me. He--

1090
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:55,410
- Who's Ricky?
- He takes a percentage of my work.

1091
00:54:55,435 --> 00:54:59,017
- He's a pimp, right?
- No, he's like a business representative.

1092
00:54:59,018 --> 00:55:01,226
What do you need a business repre--
You-- You--

1093
00:55:01,227 --> 00:55:04,601
All you need is a mattress and a couple of
garter belts. You're not a conglomerate.

1094
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:06,892
Lenny, he said he
was going to cut me up...

1095
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:09,393
because I told him I didn't
want to work anymore.

1096
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:13,101
Well, I think it's a great
idea that you want to phase out.

1097
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,184
- He has no qualms about killing me.
- Ohh.

1098
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:17,393
Listen, we'll call the police.
That's not a big deal.

1099
00:55:17,394 --> 00:55:20,101
How can I call the police
with my setup?

1100
00:55:20,102 --> 00:55:22,892
You know, I told you
a thousand times...

1101
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:24,976
you're in a hazardous business.

1102
00:55:24,977 --> 00:55:27,393
So that's what happens.
Now, so-- Don't go outside.

1103
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:30,601
I'm not going outside. I thought,
just maybe, if you could talk to him.

1104
00:55:30,602 --> 00:55:33,184
- Me? What, are you nuts?
- Yeah, because--

1105
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:35,892
Because you're smart and bright
and you got a way with words.

1106
00:55:35,893 --> 00:55:38,160
I can't talk to him.
I don't even know the guy.

1107
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:41,160
Yeah, well, he knows it was your idea
that I get out of the business.

1108
00:55:41,185 --> 00:55:43,368
So he said he's gonna
kill you too.

1109
00:55:43,394 --> 00:55:46,059
- He said he was gonna kill me?
- Yeah, 'cause it was your idea.

1110
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,160
He's gonna cut up my face
and put a bullet between your eyes.

1111
00:55:50,185 --> 00:55:53,767
Really? Did he--
Did he specify the caliber?

1112
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:57,142
Listen, I just thought maybe
you could just reason with him.

1113
00:55:57,143 --> 00:56:00,243
No, I can't.
I-- Listen, I never told you this,

1114
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:02,850
but I got a-- a slight
heart murmur...

1115
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:05,243
and right now
it's murmuring "hide."

1116
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:07,243
I don't believe you're a coward.

1117
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:10,035
Only in actuality.
Um, this is not for me.

1118
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,826
- Lenny, I need your help.
- No, I'm not a violence person.

1119
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:15,236
I-I write about hockey
and boxing and football.

1120
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:16,826
You know, this is not my world.

1121
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:20,118
Lenny, I do want to quit like you said,
but he said he's not gonna let me!

1122
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,826
<i>- He's gonna hurt us both. Please!
- Relax, relax.</i>

1123
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:25,826
What do you want me to do?
How am I gonna talk to him?

1124
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:27,809
- Well, okay. You just--
- I--

1125
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:31,226
You just talk because you're smarter
than he is and stronger than he is.

1126
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:34,017
You're a much better man. So just
remember that when you talk to him.

1127
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:37,809
He's a little bit intimidating.
He's got a bald head and an earring.

1128
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,017
- But you'll win. I know you will.
- Jesus, I-- I--

1129
00:56:41,018 --> 00:56:43,202
You're a good man, Lenny.
You'll win.

1130
00:56:43,227 --> 00:56:45,202
Look, in case anything
comes up,

1131
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:49,393
I want you to know that I-I'm
type O-positive, okay?

1132
00:56:49,394 --> 00:56:52,494
<i>Derek, I got the feeling you
came here and obviously moved...</i>

1133
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:54,318
<i>into this whole Knick persona.</i>

1134
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,518
<i>Did you get caught up, maybe,
with a little bit of this Knick,</i>

1135
00:56:56,534 --> 00:56:57,284
Excuse me.

1136
00:56:57,285 --> 00:56:59,601
<i>"I gotta be physical,
I gotta be tough," and maybe--</i>

1137
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:01,601
I'm, uh, I'm
Lenny Gildersleeve.

1138
00:57:01,602 --> 00:57:04,976
I-- I'm a friend of
Linda-- Linda Ash's.

1139
00:57:04,977 --> 00:57:08,476
And, uh, I thought
that perhaps we could--

1140
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:10,476
See--

1141
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,767
What I want to discuss
with you is that...

1142
00:57:12,768 --> 00:57:15,868
there comes a time in the life
of every young woman,

1143
00:57:15,893 --> 00:57:17,976
not just Linda, but everyone,

1144
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:21,868
that they-- they want to perhaps
make a change in their life.

1145
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:25,476
They maybe want to settle down
or explore alternative lifestyles.

1146
00:57:25,477 --> 00:57:29,268
I don't think you've been a very good
influence on Linda, Mr. Weinrib.

1147
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:33,661
Weinrib. Right. So Gildersleeve
is a name I use for business purposes.

1148
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:36,142
- I got an investment in Linda.
- No question.

1149
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:38,743
I honor that. But--
But by now, she's probably...

1150
00:57:38,768 --> 00:57:40,767
repaid you tenfold
or twentyfold or--

1151
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:41,815
Don't be so fuckin' sure,

1152
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:44,035
'cause you don't know
what the fuckin' numbers are!

1153
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,142
That's a point well taken.
Excuse me, you're-- you're-- Excuse me.

1154
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:49,851
I-I-I understand what you're saying.
Is that a Pellegrino?

1155
00:57:49,852 --> 00:57:53,143
Can I-- Because you've
bent my throat now a little bit.

1156
00:57:53,144 --> 00:57:56,143
And, uh, the windpipe used to
hang straight until this moment.

1157
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:58,143
The fuckin' Knicks suck!

1158
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:00,118
They need a good shootin' forward.

1159
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,226
Yes, well, there's gonna
be a three-way trade.

1160
00:58:02,227 --> 00:58:04,226
I don't know if you guys
heard anything about it.

1161
00:58:04,227 --> 00:58:05,960
Seattle, Atlanta and
the Knicks are talking.

1162
00:58:05,961 --> 00:58:06,518
Bullshit.

1163
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:08,127
No, no, no. I kid you not.
I know. It's in the air.

1164
00:58:08,128 --> 00:58:08,725
Yeah?

1165
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:10,809
- They're discussing a trade.
- So what do you think about the Nets?

1166
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,934
- You think the Nets got a chance?
- The Nets? Yes, I do.

1167
00:58:12,935 --> 00:58:15,410
If they're injury-free,
I think they have a good chance.

1168
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:17,809
I like the Nets. I think they're
one or two years away, is all.

1169
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,809
I would say two or three myself.

1170
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,910
You see, we have a common interest,
the three of us.

1171
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:25,702
- What were we talking about?
- Linda, Linda Ash.

1172
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:29,101
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That girl's goin' no place.

1173
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:32,684
She walks on me, I'll disfigure her
and I'll fuckin' kill you.

1174
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:36,101
See, that's exactly what
Dr. Kleinholtz would call "acting out."

1175
00:58:36,102 --> 00:58:37,679
Don't tell me how to run
my fuckin' business!

1176
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,184
I'm not!

1177
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:40,184
My girls do
what I tell 'em to do.

1178
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:42,184
Far be it for me to advise you.

1179
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,577
You obviously have a work ethic
that's specific to your needs.

1180
00:58:44,602 --> 00:58:47,684
That's why you can afford
an establishment like this, you know.

1181
00:58:47,685 --> 00:58:49,868
You're gonna take that from him?

1182
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,976
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1183
00:58:52,977 --> 00:58:55,868
I'm about to have an
out-of-body-experience here.

1184
00:58:55,893 --> 00:58:58,369
- Show strength.
- Show strength?

1185
00:58:58,394 --> 00:59:01,369
This guy's gonna put me
into 27 separate Mason jars.

1186
00:59:01,394 --> 00:59:02,551
The girl was right.

1187
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,767
They respect strength.
They despise cowardice.

1188
00:59:04,768 --> 00:59:06,851
Power is all they know.
Stand firm.

1189
00:59:06,852 --> 00:59:08,952
- Remember brave Achilles.
- Hey, don't get--

1190
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:12,351
Achilles only had an Achilles heel.
I have a full Achilles body.

1191
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:15,642
Go on!

1192
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:18,143
Look, I'm gonna level with you.

1193
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:21,143
I want to discuss
this Linda Ash thing and I-I--

1194
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:24,059
What are you so interested
in Linda for anyway, huh?

1195
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,838
Are you fuckin' her?

1196
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,851
No, we have a strictly
platonic relationship.

1197
00:59:26,852 --> 00:59:28,851
- Yeah?
- It's a good shirt.

1198
00:59:28,852 --> 00:59:30,305
Well, if you're a friend of hers,

1199
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:32,143
don't be putting
stupid ideas in her head.

1200
00:59:32,144 --> 00:59:33,928
She's liable to get hurt.

1201
00:59:33,944 --> 00:59:34,842
You too.

1202
00:59:34,843 --> 00:59:36,827
You're gonna
let him do that to you?

1203
00:59:36,852 --> 00:59:39,351
Hey, look. Would you do me a favor
and go back to Athens?

1204
00:59:39,352 --> 00:59:43,726
You gonna let your son's mother remain
a white slave to this two-bit pimp?

1205
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:45,726
It-- It's starting
to look that way, isn't it?

1206
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:47,726
- You get them Knicks tickets yet?
- No tickets.

1207
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:49,726
I tried everywhere.

1208
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:51,881
Do you need tickets to the Knicks game?
Because I--

1209
00:59:51,882 --> 00:59:53,017
Why? Who do you know?

1210
00:59:53,018 --> 00:59:55,017
Me? I-I can help you.

1211
00:59:55,018 --> 00:59:57,309
We want seats on the floor,
next to the movie stars.

1212
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:00,202
If you want to discuss a deal with
Linda, I can get you courtside seats.

1213
01:00:00,227 --> 01:00:02,518
You can't get 'em.
Nobody can get 'em, 'cause I tried.

1214
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:05,202
No, I can, though.
I-- I'm a sportswriter. I can get 'em.

1215
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,809
I'd fuckin' give you my mother
for courtside seats,

1216
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,892
much less this cheap little whore.

1217
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:12,993
That's perfectly put, succinctly put.
I know what point you're making.

1218
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:14,988
But if you're tryin' to
fuckin' pull something,

1219
01:00:15,004 --> 01:00:15,809
Easy. Take it--

1220
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,684
I will shoot you and her
through the fuckin' eyeballs!

1221
01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:21,892
It's silly to haggle over details.

1222
01:00:21,893 --> 01:00:25,077
Well, I'll get the tickets.
I'll get the tickets, I promise.

1223
01:00:25,102 --> 01:00:27,577
Then we can discuss Linda.

1224
01:00:34,977 --> 01:00:36,976
Dad, are you very brave?

1225
01:00:36,977 --> 01:00:39,976
Am I brave? It's funny
you should ask that question.

1226
01:00:39,977 --> 01:00:42,976
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson?

1227
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:45,476
What? What?
Who would win what?

1228
01:00:45,477 --> 01:00:48,476
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson?

1229
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:51,016
Me versus Mike Tyson?
Who do you think would win?

1230
01:00:51,017 --> 01:00:51,876
You?

1231
01:00:51,977 --> 01:00:53,976
There'd be no contest,
you know.

1232
01:00:53,977 --> 01:00:57,476
He would probably take the early rounds,
but I'd get to him eventually.

1233
01:00:57,477 --> 01:01:00,976
I'd chase him all over the ring.
It's my style. Always was.

1234
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:03,934
On the whole, I think it
will work. Yeah, I think it will.

1235
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:07,435
The only thing is, I want the gallery
to be lit from above,

1236
01:01:07,436 --> 01:01:10,435
so I guess the skylight
will have to be enlarged.

1237
01:01:10,436 --> 01:01:12,934
- Honey? Bed? Could you?
- Me or him?

1238
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:16,035
Him. Please?

1239
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:26,827
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't do this. I can't.

1240
01:01:26,852 --> 01:01:30,809
- Why are you fighting this?
- 'Cause I'm married and I have a family.

1241
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,827
A-And I love Lenny.

1242
01:01:33,935 --> 01:01:35,934
I love him.

1243
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:38,536
So, who are you trying
to convince, you or me?

1244
01:01:44,893 --> 01:01:47,393
- I got you a present.
- You're kidding.

1245
01:01:47,394 --> 01:01:50,494
Yeah. For fixing things up
with me and Ricky.

1246
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:53,494
- I know he can be really rough.
- That was completely unnecessary.

1247
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:55,494
Very sweet,
but completely unnecessary.

1248
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:59,393
You didn't want a blow job, so the least
I could do was get you a tie.

1249
01:01:59,394 --> 01:02:01,393
Good thinking.
That's uh-- Oh!

1250
01:02:01,394 --> 01:02:03,893
Yes, it's a tie, isn't it?

1251
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:07,393
- Would you ever wear anything that bright?
- If the occasion demanded.

1252
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:11,577
You know, like if I ever get invited
to the Mardi Gras, I could--

1253
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,077
Oh, good. Lenny, do you want
a sandwich? I'm gonna have a sandwich.

1254
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:18,059
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Oh, okay.

1255
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,560
- It's great.
- Good.

1256
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:22,560
You know what, Lenny?

1257
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:26,059
I couldn't get your son's picture
out of my mind.

1258
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,059
- Well, he's a very cute kid, you know.
- Yeah.

1259
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,059
Len?

1260
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,059
I think I would be
a good mother.

1261
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:37,059
I think you'd be a great mother.
You're very affectionate.

1262
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,059
Yeah?

1263
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,536
I would like to start over again.
Maybe have a house. That would be nice.

1264
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:45,536
It would be great, you know.
I think it'd be fabulous.

1265
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,536
- And you could do it.
- Yeah?

1266
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:50,536
- Yeah.
- The problem is, now, finding the right guy.

1267
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:53,536
I need to find somebody
who'll love me, you know.

1268
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,560
Somebody who'll take care
of me and respect me.

1269
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:57,560
Well, I'll keep my eye open.

1270
01:02:57,561 --> 01:03:00,018
You know, maybe--
maybe-- who knows?

1271
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:04,018
The only thing is, Len,
he'd have to be as smart as me.

1272
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:07,518
I'm sure there's somebody out there,
you know, that can--

1273
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:10,018
- You'll find an equal somewhere.
- Yeah?

1274
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:13,018
And don't worry, Len.
I gave up on you.

1275
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:15,018
- M--
- I knew it couldn't be.

1276
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:18,310
Let me tell you, at my age,
if I made love with you,

1277
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:20,726
they would have to
put me on a resuscitator.

1278
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:22,226
Ha.

1279
01:03:22,227 --> 01:03:24,226
This is Max.

1280
01:03:24,227 --> 01:03:26,226
- Max.
- This is my kid.

1281
01:03:26,227 --> 01:03:28,226
- How old are you?
- I'm five.

1282
01:03:28,227 --> 01:03:30,310
- You're five? You gonna be a fighter?
- Yeah.

1283
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:33,286
Max is gonna be
a middleweight when he gets older.

1284
01:03:33,311 --> 01:03:36,286
He's gonna be a heavyweight,
the way you're carryin' him.

1285
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:39,893
I'm gonna teach you how to box, Max.
I'm gonna show you a combination punch.

1286
01:03:39,894 --> 01:03:42,893
One-five, one-five.
Two, three and four, you're gonna get.

1287
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:45,893
- Hey, Ray. This is my kid Max.
- How you doin', Max?

1288
01:03:45,894 --> 01:03:48,868
Max is gonna be a middleweight
when he gets older.

1289
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:52,185
Maybe a heavyweight?
Yeah, I think a heavyweight.

1290
01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:55,185
- You wanna go hit the bag with me?
- Okay.

1291
01:03:55,186 --> 01:03:57,185
- Nice kid.
- He's a doll.

1292
01:03:57,186 --> 01:03:59,185
So, what's with
the Sanchez thing?

1293
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:02,268
Is he gonna win that?
Is he training? Is he not training?

1294
01:04:02,269 --> 01:04:04,472
He can do it. He's in the
best shape of his life.

1295
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,268
Yeah?

1296
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:08,268
The only thing is, you don't know
what these guys do outside the gym.

1297
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:10,280
Well, that's the point.
You hear all these stories.

1298
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:11,268
He'll be all right.

1299
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:14,743
Hey, Kevin, come here. I wanna introduce
you to my friend Lenny Weinrib.

1300
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:17,508
He's a sportswriter.
He writes about boxing.

1301
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:18,758
How you doin'?

1302
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:22,244
- Listen, I'm gonna get warmed up, all right?
- Show us what you can do.

1303
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:25,244
- My hand's still a little sore.
- Wrap it up good. You'll be okay.

1304
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:28,743
- I don't know that kid.
- This kid can move. He hits good too.

1305
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:30,726
Got nice hand speed,
you know?

1306
01:04:30,727 --> 01:04:34,226
Only thing is, you don't know about
these guys-- sometimes they lack desire.

1307
01:04:34,227 --> 01:04:37,226
I seen it a million times. I don't know
if he's got the killer instinct.

1308
01:04:37,227 --> 01:04:41,226
Keeps talkin' about goin' back upstate
where he comes from on an onion farm.

1309
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:43,488
He wants to be an onion farmer.
You believe it?

1310
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:44,726
That kid's a farmer?

1311
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:47,226
He's an onion farmer, yeah. I don't know
how long he's gonna stick around.

1312
01:04:47,227 --> 01:04:51,226
That's the problem. It's a shame too;
he hits like a fuckin' mule, he's fast!

1313
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:54,726
But he wants to quit boxing,
go back and hang out on the farm.

1314
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:56,602
You know, retire.

1315
01:04:56,603 --> 01:05:00,101
And the worst thing of all is,
his girlfriend left him.

1316
01:05:00,102 --> 01:05:02,101
- She quit on him.
- Really?

1317
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:04,101
Took him for everything
he's got.

1318
01:05:04,102 --> 01:05:06,481
He's a nice, sweet kid,
but between you and I,

1319
01:05:06,497 --> 01:05:08,101
he ain't got too much upstairs.

1320
01:05:08,102 --> 01:05:11,202
They're all alike.
Hey, Len, what's the matter with you?

1321
01:05:11,227 --> 01:05:14,185
Looks like you got somethin'
on your mind. I don't understand.

1322
01:05:14,186 --> 01:05:16,101
Hey, Bo!

1323
01:05:16,102 --> 01:05:19,101
This-- This is the left,
and this is the right.

1324
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:22,101
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, Kevin, that's right.

1325
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:24,202
Yeah.

1326
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:27,185
Bye-bye.

1327
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:30,185
- Hi, Lenny. I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

1328
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:33,185
- It's starting to rain.
- Oh, I don't have an umbrella.

1329
01:05:33,186 --> 01:05:36,684
I met a guy this afternoon that I think
would be absolutely great for you.

1330
01:05:36,685 --> 01:05:38,684
- Perfect.
- For me?

1331
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,684
- Yes. He's young, he's strong, he's healthy.
- What does he do?

1332
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:44,768
H-H-He's, you know, like,
dicking around in agriculture.

1333
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:46,768
What's wrong with his dick?

1334
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:48,768
No, no, no, he's a farmer.
The guy's a farmer.

1335
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:51,768
- You met a farmer?
- Yeah, an onion farmer. It's great.

1336
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:53,743
- Where?
- At the gym.

1337
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:56,642
What the hell is an onion farmer
doing at the gym?

1338
01:05:56,643 --> 01:06:00,642
He's-- He's f-finishing a-a-a
very productive career as a boxer.

1339
01:06:00,643 --> 01:06:02,642
A boxer? Oh, Lenny.

1340
01:06:02,643 --> 01:06:06,143
No, he's-- Look, he doesn't
want to be a boxer anymore.

1341
01:06:06,144 --> 01:06:10,143
H-He's-- He wants to meet
the right girl and be a farmer.

1342
01:06:10,144 --> 01:06:11,138
Don't look at me.

1343
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:14,143
He's per-- His brother has
a big onion farm upstate.

1344
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,085
And just think of it, you know!?

1345
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,143
It'd be so great.

1346
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:21,435
A small town, and you're-- y-you're
hairdressing and, and raising kids.

1347
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:23,435
What small town?

1348
01:06:23,436 --> 01:06:25,934
- Wampsville.
- Where?

1349
01:06:25,935 --> 01:06:28,411
Wampsville.
It's an old Indian name.

1350
01:06:28,436 --> 01:06:30,411
I-I-It's a place rich
in American heritage.

1351
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:32,511
Are you off
your fucking rocker?

1352
01:06:32,536 --> 01:06:35,910
I'm gonna go marry an onion farmer
and do hair in Wimpsville?

1353
01:06:35,935 --> 01:06:37,910
Wampsville, not Wimpsville.

1354
01:06:37,935 --> 01:06:40,101
It's so perfect.
He's a nice, sweet guy.

1355
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:42,101
Oh, come on. Forget it.

1356
01:06:42,102 --> 01:06:45,101
He's perfect, though.
He's bright-- You'll think he's bright.

1357
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:48,101
- He is a fucking onion farmer.
- That's okay.

1358
01:06:48,102 --> 01:06:51,202
He's a nice kid.
More important, he's honest and decent.

1359
01:06:51,227 --> 01:06:54,185
And don't offer to give him a blow job
in the first five minutes,

1360
01:06:54,186 --> 01:06:57,185
- 'cause he thinks you're a hairdresser.
- You lied?

1361
01:06:57,186 --> 01:06:59,185
- I--
- You shouldn't lie.

1362
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:02,684
Just do what I'm telling you.
Just listen to me for once.

1363
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,684
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm off the girls, Lenny.

1364
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:07,784
I mean, the last girl I was with
she cheated me out of all my dough, man.

1365
01:07:07,785 --> 01:07:10,684
I'm telling you, this is a nice kid,
Kevin. She's nice.

1366
01:07:10,685 --> 01:07:13,684
- This the hairdresser you told me about?
- This is the hairdresser.

1367
01:07:13,685 --> 01:07:14,967
I gave you a big buildup.

1368
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:17,684
This girl could have her pick
of any guy she wants.

1369
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:20,185
- I said good things about you.
- What'd you tell her?

1370
01:07:20,186 --> 01:07:23,268
I told her you were handsome,
a good-looking guy;

1371
01:07:23,269 --> 01:07:26,268
that you're a great athlete;
that you're gifted, bright.

1372
01:07:26,269 --> 01:07:27,729
Well, you didn't lie.

1373
01:07:27,745 --> 01:07:29,268
Would I lie? Of course not.

1374
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:31,268
You told her I could fight?

1375
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:33,268
I told her, but
what touches her heart...

1376
01:07:33,269 --> 01:07:35,744
is that you want
to be a farmer.

1377
01:07:35,769 --> 01:07:39,244
This is a girl that has a love
of the soil, I promise you.

1378
01:07:39,269 --> 01:07:41,744
Onions. Onions.
My brother's got an onion farm.

1379
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:45,244
I wanna go back up there 'cause I
wanna get the hell outta this city.

1380
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,244
That's perfect! You mention onions
to Linda, she goes crazy!

1381
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:51,227
She goes nuts, you say "onion."

1382
01:07:51,228 --> 01:07:54,227
You say "onion" to Linda,
the girl is just--

1383
01:07:54,228 --> 01:07:57,227
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

1384
01:07:57,228 --> 01:07:59,227
That's her name?
Linda?

1385
01:07:59,228 --> 01:08:03,227
Linda. It's a pretty name.
What are you so, so, so standoffish--

1386
01:08:03,228 --> 01:08:06,726
- Is that with an "E-R" or a "U-R"?
- Is what with an "E-R" or--

1387
01:08:06,727 --> 01:08:09,726
- "Linder"?
- Linda. Linda with an "A." Linda.

1388
01:08:09,727 --> 01:08:11,726
She's a great kid.

1389
01:08:11,727 --> 01:08:13,726
And she's a substantial woman.

1390
01:08:13,727 --> 01:08:15,703
This is not a dumb girl.

1391
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:19,703
This girl has got a PhD in-in-in...
root and follicle culture.

1392
01:08:19,727 --> 01:08:22,703
- And she's pretty, right?
- To die. She's to die.

1393
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:25,202
'Cause that's important.
'Cause I've been stung.

1394
01:08:25,228 --> 01:08:28,202
The last girl I was with
drove me up the wall, man.

1395
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:31,994
- She made my stomach sick to the stomach.
- Linda is church people.

1396
01:08:32,019 --> 01:08:34,494
- That's what I want. I want a church girl.
- She's great.

1397
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,916
I want a nice church girl;

1398
01:08:35,932 --> 01:08:38,494
I don't want one of these
fast New York sluts.

1399
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,638
I want a nice, homely girl

1400
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:42,477
who likes to raise a family and
dogs and all that kind of thing.

1401
01:08:42,478 --> 01:08:45,785
Can I say two words to you?
Can I say two words?

1402
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,785
Butter churn. Okay?

1403
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:50,268
Butter churn.
This is a pioneer girl.

1404
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:53,268
This is a girl who is practically,
incidentally, a virgin.

1405
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:55,185
What do you mean,
"practically"?

1406
01:08:55,186 --> 01:08:59,684
I wanna level with you-- sh-she's slept
with one or two guys in her life.

1407
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:01,684
An old college professor...

1408
01:09:01,685 --> 01:09:03,768
a-a-and her childhood
sweetheart.

1409
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:06,768
But both of them were killed
in combat for their nation.

1410
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:09,768
- It's a sad story.
- A professor got killed in combat?

1411
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:11,768
Humanities regiment.

1412
01:09:11,769 --> 01:09:15,060
You know, they were the first ones
to land at Anzio. I'm telling you--

1413
01:09:15,061 --> 01:09:18,244
You said she was an actress?
She's been in some films?

1414
01:09:18,269 --> 01:09:22,244
- She's had a couple of good roles, yeah.
- She's ever been in anything I seen?

1415
01:09:22,269 --> 01:09:25,244
Hey-- You didn't see
Schindler's List?

1416
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:29,744
No, no, no-- T-That was-- That was--
That was the one with the Jews and, um--

1417
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:32,726
- Who were the bad guys?
- The blond guys were the Nazis.

1418
01:09:32,727 --> 01:09:35,143
- They were tough motherfuckers.
- Yeah, all right.

1419
01:09:35,144 --> 01:09:38,143
I'm telling you, this is a good girl.
She's wonderful.

1420
01:09:38,144 --> 01:09:40,143
He's playing God.

1421
01:09:40,144 --> 01:09:42,643
It would be nice
if he could bring this off.

1422
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:44,143
It's hubris!

1423
01:09:44,144 --> 01:09:46,827
He spent a lot of time
preparing her.

1424
01:10:25,478 --> 01:10:27,377
Listen, have you, uh--

1425
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:30,976
given any more thought
to what we discussed?

1426
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,976
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1427
01:10:32,977 --> 01:10:37,976
I mean-- Look, the problem is, I don't
know how I feel anymore; I'm confused.

1428
01:10:37,977 --> 01:10:40,976
- I--
- Listen, Amanda, I love you.

1429
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:42,976
Yeah?

1430
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:47,453
You're never gonna be able to forgive
yourself if you don't give it a try.

1431
01:10:58,678 --> 01:10:59,953
Kevin.

1432
01:11:00,478 --> 01:11:03,735
This is Linda.
Linda, this is, uh--

1433
01:11:03,936 --> 01:11:05,952
This is Kevin.

1434
01:11:06,936 --> 01:11:08,952
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

1435
01:11:11,336 --> 01:11:13,053
So...

1436
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:18,536
I'll go and-- I just wanted to
bring you guys together, you know.

1437
01:11:20,052 --> 01:11:22,352
You know, you could
maybe stick around, maybe.

1438
01:11:22,353 --> 01:11:24,352
You know, we could
go out or somethin'.

1439
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:27,411
- Yeah.
- No, no. I'm completely superfluous.

1440
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:30,310
Oh, you don't feel good?

1441
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:32,810
No, I'm superfluous.
I'm completely unnecessary.

1442
01:11:32,811 --> 01:11:37,411
You guys can have a great time
and I'll-- I got stuff to do, you know.

1443
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:42,310
- I got these for you.
- What are these, daisies?

1444
01:11:42,711 --> 01:11:44,310
That's great.

1445
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:46,310
That's nice.

1446
01:11:46,311 --> 01:11:47,810
Yeah-- Ye-- Yeah.

1447
01:11:47,811 --> 01:11:50,394
I thought you said
that he was a farmer.

1448
01:11:50,395 --> 01:11:52,602
Well, he is-- He's a farmer.

1449
01:11:52,603 --> 01:11:54,305
I know they're not onions.
They're not onions.

1450
01:11:54,321 --> 01:11:56,185
Daisies make me sneeze, Lenny.

1451
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:59,185
Come here a minute.
Excuse us one second.

1452
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:00,173
They're beautiful flowers.

1453
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:02,385
Tell him that they're beautiful
and enjoy yourself.

1454
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:05,185
- I could hold the flowers.
- I know, but they just make me sneeze.

1455
01:12:05,186 --> 01:12:06,213
She sneezes with flowers.

1456
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:07,930
That's good luck!
It's good luck if you sneeze.

1457
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:09,185
I'll hold the flowers.

1458
01:12:09,186 --> 01:12:12,685
- Thanks.
- Go ahead, have fun. I'll see you guys.

1459
01:12:12,686 --> 01:12:14,685
I'm gonna go.

1460
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:16,786
Take care.

1461
01:12:21,686 --> 01:12:24,269
So, y-- you're pretty.

1462
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:26,768
Uh-- He's...
tellin' the truth.

1463
01:12:26,769 --> 01:12:28,768
- You're really...
- Oh.

1464
01:12:28,769 --> 01:12:30,768
Pretty.

1465
01:12:30,769 --> 01:12:34,560
- Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

1466
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:37,560
I bet you're hung
like a horse.

1467
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,560
- Yeah, I can ride a horse.
- Yeah?

1468
01:12:39,561 --> 01:12:43,060
You know, my brother's got a farm,
you know. I love animals.

1469
01:12:43,061 --> 01:12:48,060
I like animals. He's got a farm up there
with the ducks and the pigs and, um--

1470
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:50,060
Oh, yeah.
In Wisconsin.

1471
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,161
Wampsville.

1472
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:18,346
I had 16 fights and
I won them all but 12.

1473
01:14:18,661 --> 01:14:20,861
- Oh, I'm impressed.
- Yeah.

1474
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:23,636
How long were you doin' hair?

1475
01:14:24,546 --> 01:14:26,546
Well, I'm just getting started now.

1476
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,833
That's right, 'cause you were
doin' the acting, right?

1477
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:29,851
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1478
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:32,108
I didn't get to see Schindler's List.

1479
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:33,059
Me neither.

1480
01:14:33,061 --> 01:14:36,536
But what were some of the other films
you were in?

1481
01:14:36,562 --> 01:14:39,519
Well, I did
The Enchanted, uh--

1482
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,519
- Salad.
- The Enchanted Salad?

1483
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,519
What was that about?
Is it good?

1484
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,519
Yeah, it was really good.
It was about a waitress.

1485
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,036
Yeah.

1486
01:14:51,436 --> 01:14:54,435
- I had a really good time with you tonight.
- Did you?

1487
01:14:54,436 --> 01:14:56,435
- Yeah.
- Really? Me too.

1488
01:14:56,436 --> 01:14:59,435
Yeah, you're really good
at arcade games, you know.

1489
01:14:59,436 --> 01:15:02,435
Well, I used to date
a pinball champ, not for nothing.

1490
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:05,519
Pinball ch-- Was it, like,
a serious relationship?

1491
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,602
Well, we were getting engaged,
but then two guys strangled him.

1492
01:15:13,311 --> 01:15:16,519
- You know what I like in a woman?
- What?

1493
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,977
I like, like, um,
an old-fashioned girl, you know,

1494
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:21,977
like my-my mom.

1495
01:15:21,978 --> 01:15:25,255
You know, like, a girl who likes
to take care of the house

1496
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:26,577
and cook and clean, you know...

1497
01:15:26,578 --> 01:15:29,283
and doesn't mind, you know,
walkin' the dogs and, you know,

1498
01:15:29,299 --> 01:15:31,477
doin' the lawn and
that kind of thing.

1499
01:15:31,478 --> 01:15:34,869
You know what I mean?
That's like my mom.

1500
01:15:34,894 --> 01:15:36,869
Yeah.

1501
01:15:36,894 --> 01:15:39,869
What do you like in a man?

1502
01:15:39,894 --> 01:15:42,869
I like a guy
who has a good job,

1503
01:15:42,894 --> 01:15:45,852
who treats me nice
and, um--

1504
01:15:45,853 --> 01:15:48,352
Well, who's kinda
built like you.

1505
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:51,352
Doesn't have to stuff a sock
in his jock to look good.

1506
01:15:53,253 --> 01:15:56,853
- You know what my dream is?
- What?

1507
01:15:58,478 --> 01:16:00,561
I'm in a field, right?

1508
01:16:00,562 --> 01:16:03,537
And, like, this hawk comes...

1509
01:16:03,562 --> 01:16:06,537
and picks me up
in his beak, right?

1510
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:10,727
And then flies me, like, all over
the world so I see everything.

1511
01:16:10,728 --> 01:16:13,727
And then, like, he flies me
out of the country...

1512
01:16:13,728 --> 01:16:17,227
and, like, we go up to
the north pole and he drops me...

1513
01:16:17,228 --> 01:16:19,227
in the snow.

1514
01:16:19,228 --> 01:16:21,727
And I'm just layin' there...

1515
01:16:22,228 --> 01:16:23,728
naked.

1516
01:16:27,545 --> 01:16:29,645
What's your dream?

1517
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:36,102
My dream is that somebody would come
along and think that I was special,

1518
01:16:36,103 --> 01:16:41,102
that, you know-- that they'd wanna
come and change my life for me.

1519
01:16:41,103 --> 01:16:43,120
That's my dream.

1520
01:16:44,228 --> 01:16:46,394
You could have that.

1521
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:49,495
- You think?
- Yeah, I think.

1522
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,777
You could definitely
have that,

1523
01:16:51,793 --> 01:16:53,335
a pretty girl like you.

1524
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,310
So, you think, um,

1525
01:16:58,311 --> 01:17:01,310
I'm gonna get to see you
again, Linda, or what?

1526
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,810
Do you want to?

1527
01:17:03,811 --> 01:17:06,078
A lot.

1528
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:08,078
I want to a lot.

1529
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:11,869
Me too.

1530
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:17,269
True love.
As refreshing as spring.

1531
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:19,269
They kissed good night.

1532
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:22,269
And saw each other
the very next night, and the next.

1533
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,269
Hold it, everybody.
Something's coming in.

1534
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:28,269
- A bulletin!
- Uh-oh. Here comes Miss Party Pooper.

1535
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:31,269
Tiresias, the blind seer
of Thebes.

1536
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:34,561
- I have a vision of him and Weinrib.
- Where?

1537
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:36,561
Wait.

1538
01:17:36,562 --> 01:17:38,578
The Acropolis.

1539
01:17:49,237 --> 01:17:50,936
Oh, Weinrib.

1540
01:17:51,037 --> 01:17:52,436
I saw your wife.

1541
01:17:52,437 --> 01:17:54,436
- Amanda.
- You know me?

1542
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:58,019
Yeah. I saw her.
She was workin' late at the gallery.

1543
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:01,019
And with her was this,
uh, Jerry Bender guy.

1544
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,019
Well, that's nothing. She works
with Jerry Bender. Nothing unusual.

1545
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,019
- You didn't let me finish.
- Go on.

1546
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,019
Uh, they spoke in
intimate tones...

1547
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:11,519
and then, uh, Bender rose
and laid a big wet one on her.

1548
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,519
- A big we-- Bender kissed Amanda?
- That's what I'm tellin' ya.

1549
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,019
Hey, you must've known somethin'
was going on for a while, huh?

1550
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,519
Yeah, I always thought
that Bender had eyes for her.

1551
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,519
Now he's got eyes and hands.

1552
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,019
Jesus-- Well, Amanda
didn't respond, did she?

1553
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,603
No. She just opened her mouth
very wide and stuck her tongue out...

1554
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:32,286
as far as it was
humanly possible to go.

1555
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:34,286
Jeez--
Are you sure?

1556
01:18:34,312 --> 01:18:37,286
Well, hey-- Does the Trojan horse
have a wooden dick?

1557
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,547
And then she, she pushed
her abdomen against his.

1558
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,801
All right, all right!

1559
01:18:40,811 --> 01:18:43,786
I got the picture!
I knew it! I always suspected.

1560
01:18:43,811 --> 01:18:46,125
Ah, it's somethin' you
don't wanna know,

1561
01:18:46,141 --> 01:18:48,269
but you hadda be blind not to see it.

1562
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,977
- Yeah. Oh, God. I'm gonna confront her.
- Oh, no, not in front of Max!

1563
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:55,894
No, Max-- Max has got a sleep-over date
at his friend's house.

1564
01:18:55,895 --> 01:18:59,161
No. I knew it. Down deep, I knew it.

1565
01:18:59,186 --> 01:19:02,662
Uh, thanks, Weinrib.
Thanks.

1566
01:19:02,686 --> 01:19:05,852
Ah, thank you.
God bless you.

1567
01:19:05,853 --> 01:19:08,953
Oh, my God!
It's more serious than we thought!

1568
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:12,453
It's very serious.
Her marriage to Lenny is in crisis.

1569
01:19:12,478 --> 01:19:16,852
With the passage of time,
even the strongest bonds become fragile.

1570
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:19,852
Great, fellas.
It sounds like a fortune cookie.

1571
01:19:19,853 --> 01:19:22,036
O Zeus, most potent of gods!

1572
01:19:22,061 --> 01:19:25,036
We implore thee!
We need your help!

1573
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:29,036
Zeus! Great Zeus!
Hear us! Hear us!

1574
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:31,036
We call out to thee!

1575
01:19:31,061 --> 01:19:34,236
<i>Um, this is Zeus.
I'm not home right now.</i>

1576
01:19:34,261 --> 01:19:37,828
<i>But you can leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

1577
01:19:37,853 --> 01:19:40,935
<i>Please start speaking at the tone.</i>

1578
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:44,519
Call us when you get in!
We need help!

1579
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,319
God, I think I should move out.

1580
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:51,019
I-I-I can't understand this.
Wh-Wh-- This is so radical.

1581
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,411
No, 'cause I can't cheat.

1582
01:19:52,427 --> 01:19:54,719
- Jerry Bender's in love with me.
- This is crazy.

1583
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,976
And what are you telling me,
that you're in love with him,

1584
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,019
you're in love with Jerry Bender?

1585
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,519
I don't know.
I-- I gotta find out.

1586
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,603
What do you mean,
"you don't know"?

1587
01:20:03,619 --> 01:20:04,495
I don't know!

1588
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,051
What do you mean
"you don't know"?

1589
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,495
Are you in love with him or not?

1590
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,495
Anyway, Lenny, let's face it--
things have changed between us.

1591
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,129
But we can fix things.

1592
01:20:12,145 --> 01:20:13,495
And what about Max?
You know, Max--

1593
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,464
He'll be okay.

1594
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,295
Maybe it will be better
for him with us apart...

1595
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,603
instead of together and
arguing all of the time.

1596
01:20:19,604 --> 01:20:20,677
That's crazy.

1597
01:20:20,978 --> 01:20:22,995
I just think that's crazy.

1598
01:20:24,103 --> 01:20:26,078
Well, I-- I can't
have this conversation.

1599
01:20:26,103 --> 01:20:28,579
I-- This is too crazy. I'm--

1600
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:31,579
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out. I have to think.

1601
01:20:31,604 --> 01:20:34,495
I have to get
my thoughts together.

1602
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:04,436
- I been waitin' for you, man.
- Kevin, leave me alone.

1603
01:21:04,437 --> 01:21:07,245
- I'm in a very, very bad mood.
- You're in a very bad mood?

1604
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:08,514
How the hell could you do this to me?

1605
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,927
How could you set me up
with this stupid girl, man?

1606
01:21:10,928 --> 01:21:12,549
What are you talking about?
Whats wrong with you?

1607
01:21:12,565 --> 01:21:15,227
What am I talking about!? What's wrong w--
You didn't tell me she was a hooker...

1608
01:21:15,228 --> 01:21:19,227
and that she did porno films and had sex
with hundreds and hundreds of men...

1609
01:21:19,228 --> 01:21:21,727
and women and who the hell
knows what else!

1610
01:21:21,728 --> 01:21:23,627
I--you know,
I thought it would prejudice you.

1611
01:21:23,643 --> 01:21:24,427
What?

1612
01:21:24,528 --> 01:21:26,227
How did you find out?

1613
01:21:26,228 --> 01:21:28,077
I-I call my friends up and I tell 'em,
you know,

1614
01:21:28,093 --> 01:21:29,936
I got this girl that I wanna marry and,
you know,

1615
01:21:29,937 --> 01:21:32,169
They have me over for
a few drinks and a party

1616
01:21:32,185 --> 01:21:34,019
and my friend Ray
puts in this sexy video.

1617
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,519
But I'm not really
into pornography, you know.

1618
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,412
I look upon the screen and this
actress is up there: Judy Cum.

1619
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,894
Kevin, I told you she had
dramatic aspirations.

1620
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:45,015
I flew off the handle.

1621
01:21:45,016 --> 01:21:47,894
Oh, Christ. I thought you
were a broad-minded guy.

1622
01:21:47,895 --> 01:21:51,269
I came over here and she confessed
to everything, and then I--

1623
01:21:51,285 --> 01:21:52,394
and I hit her.

1624
01:21:52,395 --> 01:21:55,311
- You hit her? You hi--
- I was gonna break your neck, man!

1625
01:21:55,312 --> 01:21:57,910
- I don't believe this. You hit her?
- I don't believe this!

1626
01:21:57,911 --> 01:22:00,910
- You hit her? For Christ's--
- A little bit.

1627
01:22:01,111 --> 01:22:02,101
God.

1628
01:22:02,402 --> 01:22:03,858
I called my mother.
I was upset, you know,

1629
01:22:03,874 --> 01:22:05,111
so then she says
I should come home.

1630
01:22:05,112 --> 01:22:07,009
So I'm gonna get the hell
outta this place, man.

1631
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:07,969
I don't understand you.

1632
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:11,269
You're a broad-minded guy. People change.
You gonna hold her past against her?

1633
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:14,269
- Yeah, I'm gonna-- A porno star!
- You love her, she loves you!

1634
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:17,269
- What are you talking about?
- Forget it, man. It's over.

1635
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:19,769
I told you from day one
the girl was not a virgin.

1636
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,870
You didn't tell me
how many times though!

1637
01:22:23,095 --> 01:22:25,053
- Thanks for nothin', Lenny, man.
- Kevin!

1638
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:27,370
Nah, man!

1639
01:22:39,562 --> 01:22:41,852
He hit me.

1640
01:22:41,853 --> 01:22:44,935
I know, I-- I ran into him
downstairs and he--

1641
01:22:44,936 --> 01:22:47,935
Oh, Jesus, look at you.

1642
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,935
God, does it feel terrible?

1643
01:22:49,936 --> 01:22:52,935
No, not really. Just my ulcer.

1644
01:22:52,936 --> 01:22:56,537
Your ulcer? Well, you know,
you shouldn't be drinking.

1645
01:22:56,562 --> 01:23:00,019
That's the worst-- 
Oh, God, look at that.

1646
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:02,036
Boy.

1647
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,784
Remember you once said
we were a couple of losers?

1648
01:23:06,785 --> 01:23:07,644
Yeah.

1649
01:23:07,645 --> 01:23:10,644
Well, I think
that's definitely true.

1650
01:23:10,645 --> 01:23:13,745
Why? What happened to you?

1651
01:23:15,604 --> 01:23:17,603
Amanda left me.

1652
01:23:17,604 --> 01:23:21,102
Oh. I'm sorry, Lenny.

1653
01:23:21,103 --> 01:23:23,603
Would you like a drink?

1654
01:23:23,604 --> 01:23:25,620
No.

1655
01:24:16,853 --> 01:24:20,579
What's, uh-- What's--
What's the matter?

1656
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:24,245
I-- I don't know.

1657
01:24:33,062 --> 01:24:36,037
Was she great?
You can tell me.

1658
01:24:36,062 --> 01:24:38,019
Was she--
Was she great in bed?

1659
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,635
A woman with all that experience.

1660
01:24:40,651 --> 01:24:42,019
I don't know.

1661
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:45,019
I just know that suddenly
I really miss Amanda.

1662
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:47,019
But wait!
See who approaches!

1663
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,520
There you are!
Where have you been?

1664
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:52,019
I've been looking for you all over.

1665
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,810
I was just out drinking
and thinking about everything.

1666
01:24:55,811 --> 01:24:57,810
Oh, Lenny, I'm sorry.

1667
01:24:57,811 --> 01:25:01,810
I, uh-- I was up all night
thinking how much I hurt you...

1668
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:04,810
and how much
I'd messed us up for good,

1669
01:25:04,811 --> 01:25:07,110
and the thought
of not being with you.

1670
01:25:07,111 --> 01:25:08,291
I love you.

1671
01:25:08,407 --> 01:25:10,802
I don't love Jerry at all.

1672
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:14,786
We have to put things right,
whatever has to be done.

1673
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:29,254
<i>And as for Linda,</i>

1674
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:32,477
<i>she drove upstate to Wampsville
and pleaded with Kevin to take her back...</i>

1675
01:25:32,578 --> 01:25:34,369
<i>but to no avail.</i>

1676
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:38,369
<i>Anyway, on the way home she was
distraught and felt life held no hope...</i>

1677
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:42,495
<i>when-- talk about
a deus ex machina--</i>

1678
01:26:14,853 --> 01:26:18,852
So we just had a stabilizing problem
and the thing got a little off balance.

1679
01:26:18,853 --> 01:26:20,567
And then the radio went glitchy,

1680
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:22,852
so I just need to get down
and use a phone.

1681
01:26:22,853 --> 01:26:25,912
And thank you very much,
by the way, for stopping.

1682
01:26:25,937 --> 01:26:28,912
My name's Don.

1683
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:34,228
<i>And so Linda married.</i>

1684
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:38,936
<i>To a wonderful man who was not uptight
and repressed and accepted her...</i>

1685
01:26:38,937 --> 01:26:42,394
<i>and even laughed at wild tales
of her promiscuous background.</i>

1686
01:26:42,395 --> 01:26:44,894
<i>And so our little
Greek drama comes to--</i>

1687
01:26:44,895 --> 01:26:46,894
Wait, wait, wait.
There's more.

1688
01:26:46,895 --> 01:26:49,995
What more, Tiresias,
blind seer of Thebes?

1689
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,496
Tell 'em just to
call me Tiresias, will ya?

1690
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:54,395
The handicapped
are always cranky.

1691
01:26:54,396 --> 01:26:57,894
<i>On that night,
Lenny Weinrib and Linda did make love,</i>

1692
01:26:57,895 --> 01:27:01,194
<i>like he was Zeus and she
was Aphrodite with an aphrodisiac.</i>

1693
01:27:01,195 --> 01:27:02,894
<i>Get to the point!</i>

1694
01:27:02,895 --> 01:27:05,378
<i>The point is, Linda did,
that night, conceive a child.</i>

1695
01:27:05,379 --> 01:27:06,186
<i>No!</i>

1696
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:09,685
<i>Yes. She became pregnant
with Lenny's child.</i>

1697
01:27:09,686 --> 01:27:14,186
<i>But not wanting to complicate his life
with Amanda, she never told him.</i>

1698
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:17,162
<i>Instead she went off
with her new husband,</i>

1699
01:27:17,187 --> 01:27:21,769
<i>who stood behind her loyally as she
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.</i>

1700
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,886
<i>Lenny never saw Linda again.</i>

1701
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:27,701
<i>And then, one fall day in New York...</i>

1702
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:36,245
We can look around the whole store
if you'd like.

1703
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:40,454
- Lenny!
- I don't believe this! Wh--

1704
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:43,061
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

1705
01:27:43,062 --> 01:27:45,561
- I-I--
- I'm stunned! What happened to you?

1706
01:27:45,562 --> 01:27:47,561
I-I'm living in Connecticut.

1707
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,761
I'm married and my husband Don
is a helicopter pilot.

1708
01:27:50,762 --> 01:27:54,061
You're kidding! Where did you go?
I searched every place for you.

1709
01:27:54,062 --> 01:27:56,582
It's like you vanished
off the face of the earth.

1710
01:27:56,583 --> 01:27:58,135
Well, we had our moment.

1711
01:27:58,145 --> 01:28:00,464
But I knew you would be
back with Amanda.

1712
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,120
I can't b-- That's super.

1713
01:28:02,145 --> 01:28:04,445
S-So y-you're married and--
This is yours?

1714
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:05,621
Yes! Look at her.

1715
01:28:05,645 --> 01:28:09,312
Oh, God, she's adorable.

1716
01:28:09,337 --> 01:28:11,520
She's adorable.
Very, very--

1717
01:28:11,545 --> 01:28:12,599
And is-- Is that Max?

1718
01:28:12,615 --> 01:28:14,103
This is Max. This is Max.

1719
01:28:14,104 --> 01:28:16,603
- Hello.
- Max, say hello. This is a friend.

1720
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:18,503
- Hi, I'm Linda.
- How do you do?

1721
01:28:18,504 --> 01:28:20,114
Nice to m--
What a handsome boy.

1722
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:21,842
Amanda must be very beautiful.

1723
01:28:21,928 --> 01:28:25,228
And she's-- You've gotta have
a very handsome husband,

1724
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:27,228
'cause she has a great face.

1725
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:30,311
I'm stunned.
I don't know what to say. I'm, I'm--

1726
01:28:30,312 --> 01:28:34,287
- Lenny, it's so great to see you.
- You too. You're okay? Everything--

1727
01:28:34,312 --> 01:28:36,787
Yeah. I'm really good.

1728
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,787
Thank you for everything.

1729
01:28:38,812 --> 01:28:40,787
Oh-- I-I--
I'm speechless.

1730
01:28:40,812 --> 01:28:44,287
I-I-- I gotta go.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late.

1731
01:28:44,312 --> 01:28:48,579
- It was great to see you.
- It was great to see you. Great.

1732
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:51,579
But they have each other's child.

1733
01:28:51,604 --> 01:28:53,579
And they don't know.

1734
01:28:53,604 --> 01:28:56,478
Yes. Yes. Isn't life ironic?

1735
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:58,478
Life is unbelievable.

1736
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:02,270
Miraculous. Sad.
Wonderful.

1737
01:29:02,271 --> 01:29:04,662
Yes, this is all true!

1738
01:29:04,687 --> 01:29:06,787
And that's why we say:
