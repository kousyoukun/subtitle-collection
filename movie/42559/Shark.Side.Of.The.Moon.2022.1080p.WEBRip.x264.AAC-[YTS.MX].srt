We can’t let these monsters escape!

Once they get into the ocean,

20
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,240
it’s over, they’ll be unstoppable.

21
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:31,010
This is the only way to end it for good.

22
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,345
Ah!

23
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:34,613
What have we done?

24

I don’t know how to work this thing, do you?

28
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:13,118
Don’t you remember your Cosmonaut training?

29
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:14,386
Turn on the engines and hit the gas!

Figure it out, Sergei!

They’re about the break through!

33
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,729
Sergei, hurry up! There’s more coming!

34
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,365
Once we hit ten thousand meters, they’ll have no oxygen.

35
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,367
Hurry up, they’re almost in!

36
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,638
Nearly there!

00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,639
Sergei!

00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,040
I think I got it!

39
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,842
I can’t overload it, but I can launch it!

40
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,245
One minute starting now!

41
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:42,147
I need more time, I need more time!

42
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,650
I’ll give you more time.

43
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,486
No, Aloysha! Come back!

44
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,188

final walkthrough complete.

55
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,719
All systems running at 100 percent.

56
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,488
We have confirmed "go" for launch by all parties.

57
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,024
T-minus nine minutes and counting.

58
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,392
Roger that, mission control.

59
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,727
Engineer Gilmour, what’s our status?

60
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:38,063
Green across the board, Commander, and...

61
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,832
and...

62
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:44,136
ooh, oh, wow, I think I shouldn’t have had those tacos.

63
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,005
I told you not to trust that food truck.

64
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,007
I think it’s something else.

65
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,808
Gilmour?

66
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,244
I’ll just do a couple of tests.

67
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,049
I’m just gonna touch here.

68
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,050
Ah!

69
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:58,851
Ah, ah!

70
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,219
We got a possible appendicitis.

71
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,220
No, no, no...

72
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,688
Captain...

73
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,590
-It’s just... mm. -She’s not clear to fly.

74
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,092
Mission control, Engineer Gilmour

75
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,593
has fallen ill and needs medical attention.

76
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,128
We need to delay the launch.

77
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,763
No can do, Commander.

78
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,199
Delaying the launch would set us back six months.

79
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,433
That’s going to be a huge setback

80
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,068
that we can’t handle.

81
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,006
We will alert the alternate. He’s standing by.

82
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,240
Shit.

83
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:42,695
Commander Tress, alternate astronaut is en route.

84
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,298
Tabula Rasa, start auxiliary power units

85
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,299
and activate APUs.

86
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,735
APUs on.

87
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,705
Felt like this day would never come.

88
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,307
We are finally going to the moon.

89
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,845
As long as the alternate shows up.

90
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,585
Arming solid rocket booster

91
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,586
Sequence ready.

92
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,021
Arm and safe devices a go.

93
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,390
The alternate should be joining you in a minute.

94
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,893
SRBs and devices clear.

95
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,728
I know none of us are happy about it,

96
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,797
but he’s the best at what he does...

97
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:20,232
maybe even better than Gilmour.

98
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,668
We can’t delay this mission another six months.

99
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,672
Howdy, boss.

100
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,507
Prepped and ready to go to the moon.

101
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,911
I hear the commute is a killer.

102
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,346
Michael, for the last time,

103
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,314
I’m not your boss, I’m your commander.

104
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,116
Roger that, Commander.

105
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,285
Begin aero surface profile test.

106
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,957
Aero profile surface test activated, Commanderino.

107
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,396
Mission control, profile test complete.

108
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,764
Copy.

109
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,133
Proceed with main engine gimbal profile test.

110
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,036
Retract the gaseous vent arm.

111
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,871
Michael, please take this seriously.

112
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,407
This mission is far too important to humanity, got it?

113
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,876
You don’t have to worry about me, Commander

114
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,378
I’m here to work.

115
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,146
Commander, power status.

116
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,984
Power is running at 100 percent, no alarms.

117
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,353
Transferring communication module power from ground

118
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,788
to internal.

119
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,225
Activating launchpad sound suppression system.

120
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,796
Activating main engine burn-off in T-minus 10.

121
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,665
Copy. Guidance is internal.

122
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,066
We will begin ground launch sequencer

123
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,601
for auto sequence start.

124
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,969
We are still go.

125
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,938
T-minus 27 seconds and counting, Commander.

126
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,807
Roger that, mission control.

127
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,410
Everyone ready to go to the moon?

128
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,914
Oh shoot...

129
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,482
What is it, Michael?

130
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,184
I think I left my stove on.

131
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,456
Remind me to not leave you alone in the galley.

132
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,293
Luckily, NASA has ensured this ship

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,495
is mitigated against all excessive heat forms,

134
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,998
just so long as we don’t land in the Compton Belkovich

135
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,466
volcanic complex on the far side,

136
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,803
we should be safe, even from Liam’s cooking.

137
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,071
[chuckling]

138
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:11,510
Ten, nine, eight,

139
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,845
seven...

140
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,580
Starting main engine.

141
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,549
six, five,

142
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,918
four, three,

143
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:21,387
two, one.

144
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,123
Godspeed, Tabula Rasa.

145
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,324
Roger that, mission control.

146
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,625
Ignition.

147
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,160
Liftoff.

148
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,500
[cheering]

149
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,787
There’s the thermosphere.

150
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,494
Now for the exosphere.

151
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,437
Wow.

152
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,838
[sighs]

153
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,075
Mission Control to Tabula Rasa.

154
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,743
That is a successful launch.

155
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,079
I repeat, a successful launch.

156
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,015
Woo!

157
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,554
Current navigation track to the moon appears clear

158
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,690
and artificial gravity magnification is complete.

159
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,125
Roger that, mission control.

160
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,427
Tom, confirm navigation settings.

161
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,831
Navigation settings confirmed.

162
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:43,869
ETA to the moon, 68 hours, 42 minutes, and 15 seconds.

163
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,105
That tracks with our settings.

164
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,841
Signing off for now, but will continue to monitor.

165
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,943
Congratulations, Tabula Rasa.

166
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,046
Nice work, everyone.

167
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,114
Now the real work begins.

168
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,783
Gravity normalizers engaged.

169
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,186
All right, I’ll be in the galley making popcorn,

170
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,353
if anybody needs something.

171
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,424
-[laughing] -What? C’mon.

172
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,502
How’s it looking? Everything still on schedule?

173
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,770
Uh, sure...

174
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,606
just trying to make a renewable source of energy

175
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,242
that will support generations of thousands of people

176
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,312
living on the moon, no big deal.

177
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,048
If anyone can make this fuel work, it’s you.

178
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,317
You led the team that discovered what,

179
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,819
a thousand new uses for algae?

180
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,254
What’s one more, right?

181
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,656
Thanks, Commander, that means a lot.

182
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,031
You know, my dad keeps saying if we’re successful,

183
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,934
they’ll have towns on the moon named after us soon enough.

184
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,303
Think about it...

185
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,838
Adams City.

186
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,106
Tressburg.

187
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,042
Don’t go looking for condos just yet.

188
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,077
Go for Commander Tress.

189
00:12:58,143 --> 00:12:59,778
Go for Tress.

190
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,182
Commander, we have a bit of electromagnetic disturbance,

191
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,451
probably due to the Van Allen radiation belt.

192
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,152
It’s nothing out of the ordinary, but...

193
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,754
What does that mean?

194
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,223
We’ve been on a bit of a run, but we should be fine.

195
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,459
But we’ll have to adjust our landing by a degree.

196
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:16,061
But we should still be able to land in the West Crater.

197
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,497
Keep an eye on it.

198
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,698
Let Ellie and mission control know right away.

199
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,367
Henri and Michael as well.

200
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,469
Copy, we’re having trouble reaching out to mission control

201
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:25,905
due to the interference, but I’ll keep trying.

202
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,640
Roger that.

203
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,308
I’m about to go on my sleep shift, but don’t hesitate

204
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,577
to wake me the second anything changes.

205
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,582
Are we okay, Commander?

206
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,284
Be ready for anything.

207
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,985
I’m gonna get some shut-eye.

208
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,420
I suggest you do the same.

209
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,589
It’ll be all hands once we make our approach.

210
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,291
Sounds good, Commander.

211
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,438
Quequio satellite sighted.

212
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,809
Navigation holding steady?

213
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:08,480
Yes, current descent is only 46 feet from our initial site.

214
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,716
Final run-through at 100 percent,

215
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,987
confirmed by Michael, Henri, and yours truly.

216
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,655
Come in, Commander Tress,

217
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,758
we are ready to initiate orbital lunar descent.

218
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,694
Confirmed.

219
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,729
Tabula Rasa Crew, report to command module

220
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,297
for initial orbital lunar descent

221
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,299
in T-minus 5 minutes and counting.

222
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,372
Go back, go back!

223
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,473
Whoa...

224
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,942
Everyone, get your asses up here, now!

225
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,310
[alarm blares]

226
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,516
Status report.

227
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,852
Commander, we are reading that you are veering off-course

228
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,355
by 24.2 degrees, please advise.

229
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,960
We’re not getting back on-course.

230
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,929
Mission control, we had some interference from the Van Allen,

231
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,530
but we course-corrected.

232
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,065
There’s no way it’s causing this much interference.

233
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,568
Copy, Tabula Rasa.

234
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:03,569
We suggest, uh...

235
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,970
[static]

236
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,171
Hello?

237
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,574
Hello, mission control, do you copy?

238
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,145
Mission control, I repeat, do you copy?

239
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,346
We lost them.

240
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,781
Henri, Michael, we need a diagnostic

241
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,883
of the electrical components of the nav system.

242
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,252
-On it. -Copy, boss.

243
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,159
The hardware’s fried, the system’s completely overloaded.

244
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,629
Something’s scrambling the computer to continually reset.

245
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,865
My electromagnetic readings are off the charts.

246
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,068
Interference shouldn’t increase exponentially like this.

247
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:43,575
I’m not getting control, we need to do something, now.

248
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,576
Restart the ship.

249
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,544
What?

250
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,112
We should regain emergency control.

251
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,747
Oxygen and gravity are on separate systems,

252
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:49,782
so those should hold.

253
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,849
Captain, that’s insane.

254
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,351
But Commander, we have no time.

255
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,253
We’ll be propelled to the far side

256
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:55,687
in T-minus 95 seconds.

257
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,623
It’s either this, or we crash and explode.

258
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,224
Restart the ship.

259
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,383
She’s holding.

260
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,185
She’s holding.

261
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,857
Wait... navigation’s not course-correcting.

262
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,625
Sixty seconds till we’re flung to the far side.

263
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,461
We need to manually maneuver the ship.

264
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,931
Michael, can you slow us down by adjusting the rocket boosters?

265
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:41,567
I can keep us flying long enough to not go "kaboom."

266
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,569
We’ll be flung to the far side of the moon before then.

267
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,571
If that happens we need to get

268
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,172
as close as possible to the Von Kármán crater.

269
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,407
We can use parts from the Chang’e-4 lander

270
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,275
and Yutu-2 rover to fix the ship.

271
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,445
Michael, Henri, adjust the rockets, slow us down.

272
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,281
On it.

273
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,550
When we land, we can use the Quequio relay satellite

274
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,085
to make contact.

275
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,888
That’s the only thing on the far side that can reach Earth.

276
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,923
Assuming we land in one piece.

277
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,528
Okay.

278
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,099
Anything?

279
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,567
It’s not working.

280
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,277
That was the satellite.

281
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,979
We won’t be able to contact mission control.

282
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,214
That won’t matter if we don’t survive this landing.

283
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,183
Michael, Henri, the rockets.

284
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,352
Nothing yet, Commander.

285
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,355
Keep her as steady as possible.

286
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:37,856
Roger that, Commander.

287
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,298
It’s not working, we have to do it manually.

288
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,010
Anything?

289
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,912
It’s working.

290
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,181
[garbled transmission]

291
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,217
...right for the Chang’e 4!

292
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,885
Brace for impact!

293
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,423
[grunting]

294
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,571
Michael, Henri, are you okay?

295
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,275
All good, Commander.

296
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,555
We’re locked out of the systems.

297
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,795
We need to figure out a way to get back to Earth...

298
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,463
now.

299
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,403
Status report... is anyone hurt?

300
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,772
Negative, Commander, we’re all good here.

301
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,574
System says no hull breaches, either.

302
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,210
But that Chang’e 4 rover was our best chance

303
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,645
to communicate with mission control.

304
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,046
It doesn’t matter.

305
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,048
The satellite’s gone, and the only thing

306
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,151
on the far side of the moon that can communicate with Earth,

307
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,620
we destroyed.

308
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,389
I’ll never see my dad again.

309
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,025
We won’t see anyone again.

310
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,194
Mission control knows we crashed on the far side.

311
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,329
If they don’t hear from us in the next few hours,

312
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,565
the best they can try to do any time soon

313
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,899
will be to figure out a way to communicate.

314
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,568
But that could take days or longer,

315
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,937
especially without the Quequio satellite.

316
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,438
We’re all alive.

317
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,441
We need to assess and see what’s available, and for how long.

318
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,244
We’ll probably have to get back on our own.

319
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,679
Of course.

320
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,347
Tom, Henri, status report?

321
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,817
We’ve lost most of our power.

322
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,254
Owen, please tell me life support is still functional.

323
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,322
Okay, okay...

324
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,523
Um...

325
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,526
we should be okay on oxygen.

326
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,261
We have enough in reserve to last six months.

327
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,698
Our food source is supposed to mimic that as well.

328
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,067
We are equipped to grow vegetation,

329
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,770
so we should get some fresh food if we’re here for a while.

330
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,605
And so long as there aren’t any hull breaches

331
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,674
and no one opens any doors or windows,

332
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,343
we should be able to maintain a moderate temperature

333
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,612
inside the modules for months.

334
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,815
And if there aren’t any leaks, we’ll be fine.

335
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,084
I’ll do a walkthrough, then a moonwalk,

336
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,119
to ensure there’s no external damage.

337
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,156
See? We’re all safe.

338
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,591
How far away are we from the Yutu-2 rover?

339
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,695
Rough estimate, about a mile.

340
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,831
Is there any way to contact mission control from the Yutu-2?

341
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,801
No, the only way to reach Earth from the far side

342
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,469
was through the Quequio relay satellite.

343
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,372
Which we destroyed.

344
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,840
Exactly.

345
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,009
So, Michael, Henri, you’re coming with me

346
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,412
to retrieve whatever components we can from the Yutu-2 rover,

347
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,681
use it to get Tabula Rasa up and running,

348
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,583
at least to the near side, so we can make contact.

349
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,051
I’m coming too.

350
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,820
The Yutu-2 houses several spectrometers.

351
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,688
I could pull a whole one or scavenge it for parts.

352
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,690
No, if it’s operational, we’ll drive it back here.

353
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,691
You can get what you need from it then.

354
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,393
And what if it’s not?

355
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,496
Then we’ll be missing out on potentially life-saving tech.

356
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:07,132
Fine.

357
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,167
Ellie, I need the rest of you to take stock

358
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,402
of all the damage you can find.

359
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,737
Make sure all supplies and experiments

360
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,738
are still operational, and if possible,

361
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,506
chart a course back home.

362
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,408
We’ll need every bit of oxygen, water,

363
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,843
and sustenance accounted for.

364
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,344
We could be here for a while.

365
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,079
We’re on it, Commander.

366
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,714
And Josie, make sure the life support module

367
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,049
is fully operational.

368
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,184
If that breaks, we have no chance of going back.

369
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,253
Copy, Commander.

370
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,423
All right, team, let’s suit up.

371
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:47,706
All right, it’s at least a 20-minute hike.

372
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,375
Everyone keep an eye on your vitals.

373
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,711
-Copy that, Commander. -Copy.

374
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,846
Copy that, Commander.

375
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,114
Follow me.

376
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,187
Come on, guys, we’re the first humans

377
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,724
to set foot on the far side of the moon.

378
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,027
Guys, we’re a part of history no matter what now.

379
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,138
Stupid things!

380
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,279
Did you see that?

381
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,580
See what?

382
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,249
I don’t know, it looked Cyrillic...

383
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,751
Russian, maybe.

384
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,487
Russian? That’s odd.

385
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,622
If anything, we probably picked up

386
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,658
some Chinese characters from the Yutu-2.

387
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,760
No, no, no, it for sure wasn’t that.

388
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,762
Let me see if I can get it pulled back up.

389
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,597
We have more important things to do.

390
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,132
Come on, can we finish this walkthrough?

391
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,867
Fine.

392
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:06,551
Well, Liam, it appears to be working.

393
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,788
Aren’t you glad I came, Commander?

394
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,490
Okay, let’s take what we need and head back.

395
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,659
The less of our oxygen reserves we use out here, the better.

396
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,028
Jackpot.

397
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,166
Oh, shoot.

398
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,102
What is it, Liam?

399
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,203
Bloody nose.

400
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,305
I hit my face pretty bad during the crash.

401
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,008
Liam, have Owen check you out the second we get back.

402
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,215
Captain, I think you should see this.

403
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,359
A volcanic reaction?

404
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,860
Unlikely...

405
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,328
nothing under the moon should cause ripples like that.

406
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,998
The moon has magma, but no active volcanoes.

407
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,367
Even if we’re under a magma chamber, there’s no way.

408
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,035
Tracks?

409
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,771
From what, a giant moon snake?

410
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,207
The rover?

411
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,811
No, tire tread doesn’t match.

412
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,752
Back to the ship, leave the rover!

413
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,227
What are those?

414
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,895
Sharks?

415
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:53,491
Why are there sharks on the moon?

416
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,060
Look, it’s not moving.

417
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,295
I think someone must have set a trap.

418
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,966
Okay, but who set the trap?

419
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,304
Ah!

420
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,283
[speaks Russian]

421
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,996
How are they breathing?

422
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,298
Uh, I think they just spoke...

423
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,266
Russian?

424
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:40,572
First there were giant sharks, now there are Russians?

425
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,040
You think they’re friendly?

426
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,976
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

427
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,089
Americans...

428
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,027
Welcome to the moon!

429
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,776
For the record, this was not in the brochure.

430
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:23,381
I didn’t think it would be the Americans

431
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:27,152
who will lead my rescue operation, but how do you say...

432
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:31,256
beggars can’t be choosers.

433
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,692
A rescue mission?

434
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,193
Who are you?

435
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,295
You weren’t sent here to rescue me?

436
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,999
After 40 years on the moon,

437
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,903
I assumed somebody would want to bring me back!

438
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,372
[speaks Russian]

439
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:54,012
Papa, we’re going to get you back home.

440
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,648
Don’t give up hope.

441
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,249
What is the point?

442
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,552
I’m an old man, I’ve literally watched the world

443
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:04,389
pass me by more times than I can remember.

444
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,857
Maybe...

445
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,459
maybe it’s time to assume...

446
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:12,397
actually, to accept that no one is coming.

447
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,598
Don’t say that.

448
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,366
Yes, she’s right.

449
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,669
We’re more than happy to bring you back with us, both of you.

450
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,804
We just need to fix our ship first.

451
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,841
See, Papa? We’re going home.

452
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,889
What is up with her back?

453
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,858
Michael, stop. They just saved us.

454
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,799
I’m... I’m sorry.

455
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,470
Okay, let me officially introduce ourselves.

456
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,573
My name is Sergei, and this is Akula.

457
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,044
And she’s my daughter...

458
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,348
Adopted daughter.

459
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:06,251
I’m sorry, I...

460
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,685
No problem.

461
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,357
But hey, if you ever will try to touch my daughter again,

462
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,325
I will make the arrangement to send you back home

463
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,361
in a plastic bag, you understood?

464
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,099
Look, I’m sorry about my crewmate.

465
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,935
We can take you back to Earth with us,

466
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,738
but first we need to know who you really are,

467
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,006
and what you’re doing here.

468
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:30,341
There’s no time for it.

469
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,677
The hybrids can return any moment.

470
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:36,147
I have a rover just towards this ledge, let’s go.

471
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,450
Good, I can guide you back to my ship.

472
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,952
Are you sure it’s a good idea to have them

473
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,287
bring us to their ship?

474
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,556
We may be followed, and their ship

475
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,158
is our best bet to get off this stupid rock.

476
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,960
Mm.

477
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,895
Good looking forward.

478
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,064
Okay, change of the plans.

479
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,034
Now we go to our base and gather our supplies,

480
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,303
and when it’s safe, we return to your ship

481
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,940
and figure out how we can get back to Earth.

482
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,975
Last I checked, I was the commander here.

483
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,277
I need to get back to my ship.

484
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,480
Well, we either all go to my ship

485
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:14,319
and wipe them off your trail, or we go separate ways.

486
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,254
They will follow you, find you,

487
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,023
kill you and every member of your crew.

488
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,459
Does it still sound like a good idea to you?

489
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,197
Fine, lead the way...

490
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,432
for now.

491
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:43,548
Quickly, get on. They’re not far.

492
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,851
I’m sorry it’s a tight fit, I wasn’t expecting guests.

493
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,319
Okay, come on, guys, make some room.

494
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,454
Come on.

495
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,123
Ah!

496
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:54,959

497
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,961
Hurry! Drive, we have to save him!

498
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,129
What are you waiting for, let’s go!

499
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,431
They will lead us into a trap.

500
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,567
If they were going to kill him, they would have done so.

501
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,369
If they’re not gonna kill him, what are they doing?

502
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,205
They’re taking him hostage.

503
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,474
I have to warn my crew.

504
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,541
No, you don’t.

505
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,176
Get off me, I have to warn my crew!

506
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,311
I’m not gonna let them die!

507
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,712
If you don’t want them to die,

508
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,547
then don’t talk to them over the radio.

509
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,683
The electromagnetic waves will lead sharks

510
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,985
straight to your ship, and to your crew.

511
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,154
They won’t get a chance.

512
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,226
We have to save Henri.

513
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,328
I’m not leaving another member of my crew.

514
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,298
And we will, but going in there now, unprepared,

515
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,067
with what you’re wearing, is a suicide mission.

516
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,735
We will get supplies at our base.

517
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,247
Where’s my helmet?

518
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,748
How can I breathe down here?

I am Tzarina Selah.

522
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,692
I’m sure you have questions.

523
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,096
So do I.

524
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,675
Quickly, no time to lose.

525
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,648
Welcome to my abode.

526
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,225
It’ll take your body a minute to adjust to the oxygen

filling the ship from my algea crop.

528
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,230
You can take off your masks then.

529
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,379
So, now, we can talk.

530
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,855
Okay, I got one question.

531
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,125
How are you still alive?

532
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,664
Okay, I have some serious questions.

533
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,468
Why doesn’t she need a suit?

534
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,669
Or oxygen?

535
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,272
I knew there was something "fishy" about her.

536
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:55,773
He was right.

537
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,409
I’m one of them.

Man, this day just keeps getting weirder and weirder.

540
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:18,162
Scouting an abandoned camp for supplies, I came across her.

541
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,398
She was absolutely healthy...

542
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,900
hungry, but healthy.

543
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,070
He saved my life, raised me as his own,

544
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,572
and taught me everything he knows.

545
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,241
I grew up listening to his homeland’s music,

546
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,144
and reading the books of his people.

547
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,347
The ship had a fine audio system.

548
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,250
Thank God for Tchaikovsky,

549
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,618
"Swan Lake" was the only thing

550
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,920
that could put me to sleep as a child.

551
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,255
Have you heard of it?

552
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,656
Yes, we’ve heard of "Swan Lake."

553
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,727
It’s a classic back on Earth.

554
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,563
But I’m actually a rock and roll guy, you know?

555
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,266
But I was not able to put my hands on it.

556
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,468
I even saw Elton in Moscow, in...

557
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,403
Wait, wait, you saw... you saw Elton John?

558
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,506
Yes, this thing was the best one, eh?

559
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,608
Can we get back on topic, please?

560
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,181
Okay, as much as her music taste,

561
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,583
Akula became better than me in many respects.

562
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:17,321
She even made some devices I wasn’t able to survive without.

563
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,390
So, speaking of...

564
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:23,661
here, upgraded suits.

565
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:29,600
They were my prototype, but they still work.

566
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,403
They block body heat and electromagnetic frequencies,

567
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,639
rendering us invisible to them.

568
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,407
While keeping your own body heat

569
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,544
to protect you from the frigid moon’s temperatures.

570
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,380
They also utilize an infrared communicator,

571
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:45,683
which converts sound to be undetectable.

572
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,319
And the oxygen?

573
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,087
Same like hybrids...

574
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,822
I convert my own.

575
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,861
So, they able to have it by consume algae they harvest,

576
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,798
and I able to extract it from the containers I grow them in.

577
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,068
So, that’s why my ship is full of oxygen,

578
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:10,007
and I put some on my back, you know, in my suit.

579
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,175
Like a makeshift oxygen tank.

580
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,643
Yes.

581
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,247
Impressive, but why are there hybrid sharks on the moon

582
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,515
in the first place?

583
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:22,420
Well, I was a very young scientist,

584
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:24,822
but always dreamed to become a cosmonaut.

585
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,892
"The great gig in the sky," I always told myself.

586
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,896
But we had a better and straight goal

587
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,097
from the government...

588
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,833
we have to declare the moon Soviet property.

589
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,402
You had just left your footprint on it,

590
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,738
and we were going to build cities.

591
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:46,611
So, our government created these sharks, these hybrids,

592
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:51,015
to become Cold War weapons against the United States.

593
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,086
So, my colleague and I lured them on the rocket

594
00:35:55,152 --> 00:36:00,157
to make sure they wouldn’t invade Earth.

595
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,026
But you’re the only one here.

596
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,427
What happened to the other guy?

597
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,398
He sacrificed himself so that I could live.

598
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,070
Sergei, I’m so sorry.

599
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,607
How did you manage to survive so long?

600
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,077
Well, the ship was filled with experiments.

601
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,479
I was able to grow my own food,

602
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:23,748
collect evaporated water from plants,

603
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:28,286
and algae helped me to survive.

604
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,621
We found water, drilled underground.

605
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,990
It’s not very good, but we survive.

606
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,226
Look, I hate to break up this Q and A,

607
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,897
but a man is being tortured by giant shark people.

608
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,266
Michael’s right, every second we’re here

609
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,101
is a second we’re not saving Henri.

610
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,606
Where did they take him?

611
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,441
The hybrids developed a settlement

612
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,109
inside the largest crater in the area.

613
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,212
He’s likely being held there.

614
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,547
We need to get there now.

615
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,848
Henri’s our mechanic.

616
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,452
We can’t repair the ship without him.

617
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,820
Let’s boogie.

618
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,424
The sharks are probably off our trail by now.

619
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,563
We need to try and communicate with the ship.

620
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,565
We need to warn the crew at all costs.

621
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,768
They need to avoid using anything electromagnetic.

622
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,705
I think you’re right.

623
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,073
Don’t let them see me.

624
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,943
Hey, you saw Elton John?

625
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,246
Man, I’ve been trying, never got a chance to.

626
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,848
Ellie.

627
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,317
Ellie, if you can hear this, do not respond...

628
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,119
I repeat, do not respond.

629
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,588
The ship is in danger of being attacked.

630
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,860
Any luck restoring electricity to the ship?

631
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,129
Not yet.

632
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,299
I repeat, do not respond using anything electromagnetic.

633
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,534
It could draw them to the ship for an attack.

634
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,671
Come in... Commander? Commander Tress!

635
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,706
-It’s not safe. -Nicole!

636
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,414
What was that?

637
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,082
I don’t know.

638
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,817
What could be taking them so long?

639
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,552
It sounded like she was in trouble.

640
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,653
We have to go out after them.

641
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,188
What? No, no, no.

642
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,590
We were given explicit orders to remain on the ship.

643
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:14,992
Nicole put me in charge.

644
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,428
They should have been back by now, they’re not responding.

645
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,163
What if they’re hurt?

646
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,365
I need you to grab your medical gear and come with me.

647
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,034
-But... -No buts!

648
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,838
Josie, Tom, continue running diagnostics.

649
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:31,642
Owen, we have a crew to find.

650
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,024
Ah... I swear, I don’t know where the ship is!

651
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,093
The crash took us so far off-course, I... I...

652
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,028
I just want your ship.

653
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,931
You and your crew can have everything we leave behind.

654
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,567
Build your little colony in peace.

655
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,769
We are going home.

656
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,070
Home?

657
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,941
Yes, the mother planet to us both. Earth.

658
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,811
Wait, wait, wait... you’re from Earth?

659
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,817
Yes, I will rule there as I rule here.

660
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:16,587
Now tell me... where is your ship?

661
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,423
I... I can’t tell you.

662
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,526
That’s a shame. Scar!

663
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,368
Ah, my leg, ah!

664
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,572
Ah!

665
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,876
[screaming]

666
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:49,019
Now tell us, or die!

667
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,489
Okay. Okay. But you have to...

668
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,224
you have to promise me...

669
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,892
promise me you won’t hurt my crew.

670
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:59,763
On my honor as Tzarina, ruler of the Hybrid sharks.

671
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:08,038
Scar, prepare the guards We’re taking the ship.

672
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,673
[panting]

673
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,243
Ah!

674
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,986
Heh, if Elton John could see me now, right?

675
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,855
Yeah, you’re a rocket man now.

676
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,428
What... what are these made of?

677
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,130
Sharpened moonstone...

678
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,666
the only thing sharp enough to pierce the sharks’ hides.

679
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,869
This stone has more crystalline structure,

680
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,505
and it’s hold sharp edge for extremely long time.

681
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,910
You two really have thought of everything, haven’t you?

682
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:49,013
When the alternative is death, you do what you can.

683
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,232
Okay, from now, we’d better go forward on foot.

684
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,235
We don’t want to let them know we’re coming.

685
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,903
Akula, lead the way.

686
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,947
It’s clear. This way... stay close.

687
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,823
Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you about

688
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,459
the booby trap you set when we met.

689
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,027
What about it?

690
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,363
I couldn’t help but notice that the hybrid shark,

691
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,166
when it was on its back, it stopped moving.

692
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,834
Why is that?

693
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,469
Tonic immobility...

694
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,271
when a shark is upside-down,

695
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,572
it cannot move,

696
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,776
and it’s about the only thing what can stop them.

697
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:59,617
And how many sharks are out there, dozens, hundreds?

698
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,685
A few dozen.

699
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,387
Their leader, Tzarina Selah,

700
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,956
only allows the very strongest to hatch.

701
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:11,996
But even with her rules, automatic parthenogenesis

702
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:16,367
asexual reproduction, started to happen.

703
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,935
Nature finds a way.

704
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,116
And how do they just pick a few to survive?

705
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,585
Do they just let the weak ones die?

706
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,954
All the eggs are cryogenically frozen in the hopes

707
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,956
that they one day will have enough resources

708
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,691
to hatch them all.

709
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,892
The ones that are allowed to be born,

710
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,627
the best and the strongest,

711
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,096
are trying to protect the crater.

712
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,431
No wonder you weren’t chosen.

713
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,468
Everyone makes mistakes.

714
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:52,936
Now, quiet.

715
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,872
They can hear us.

716
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,536
Wow... they built a whole civilization.

717
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:30,708
Impressive, if they weren’t so terrifying.

718
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,076
Who would have thought sharks

719
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,311
would have colonized the moon before humans?

720
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,346
Half-shark, half-human.

721
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,381
All teeth?

722
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,615
All violence... don’t forget that.

723
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,150
Enough.

724
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,387
Akula, where do we need to go to get into the prison?

725
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,856
The other side of that large building.

726
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,891
They don’t have heavy patrols there,

727
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,526
they guard the front entrance.

728
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,896
If we go in through the back, we should have a clear shot.

729
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,632
You heard her.

730
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,034
Let’s dance.

731
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,807
[growls]

732
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,463
Follow me, and don’t get any blood on you.

733
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,040
Look what they were able to accomplish

734
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,109
in only a few decades.

735
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,510
Yeah, it’s impressive, all right.

736
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,212
Too bad they’re all bloodthirsty killers

737
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,980
who would rip your throat out if given the chance.

738
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,651
Of course, just makes me wish we had the chance

739
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,253
to actually do the mission we came here to do.

740
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,257
Well, if they could, we sure can.

741
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,160
These shark hybrids have only expansion

742
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,029
and aggressions in mind.

743
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:34,264
They never leave their guards down...

744
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,200
stay alert.

745
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,822
I don’t like this.

746
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,291
Something feels wrong.

747
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,559
We have to try.

748
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,028
These footprints are the only signs of them.

749
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,498
Nicole would do the same for us.

750
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,001
I guess.

751
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,972
It’s just spooky out here, on the far side.

752
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,676
What’s that?

753
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:20,944
What?

754
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,145
I don’t know, it looks...

755
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,481
it looks like a piece of fabric,

756
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,950
maybe from one of the spacesuits.

757
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,930
Oh, my God...

758
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,466
Liam.

759
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,604
And where’s Nicole, Michael, Henri?

760
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,174
Come in, Commander, Michael, Henri, anybody...

761
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,609
we have a casualty!

762
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,250
Back to the ship... now!

763
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,087
What do you think got Liam?

764
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,023
There’s nothing living on the moon!

765
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,625
Owen, you cut out for a second...

766
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,628
Owen?

767
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,430
Owen!

768
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,366
Owen!

769
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,044
Help!

770
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,737
[groaning]

771
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,305
[screaming]

772
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,415
All right, if I take our location

773
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:09,853
in conjunction with the moon’s rotation...

774
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,255
there, we have our way home.

775
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,858
But...

776
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,494
But? But what?

777
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,429
We have to get this bucket of bolts off the ground

778
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,698
and headed back to Earth in less than six hours.

779
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:26,470
If we don’t, it’s another four weeks till the next window.

780
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,839
See if you can get in touch with Nicole.

781
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,040
Maybe she’s with Ellie by now.

782
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,944
Commander Tress, this is Tom.

783
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,379
Come in, Commander.

784
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,247
You and the crew need to get back to the ship ASAP.

785
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,917
We only have a six-hour window to get home.

786
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,353
Commander Tress, come in.

787
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,723
Nicole?

788
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,991
Ellie?

789
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,127
Is anybody out there?

790
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,636
If we get attacked, remember one rule...

791
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:03,340
if we draw blood, we draw attention.

792
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,276
But we’ve been cutting sharks all day.

793
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,046
Exactly... out there, where there is no atmosphere.

794
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,947
But here, they can smell anything.

795
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,383
And boy, they do love smell of blood.

796
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,394
God, it’s hot in here.

797
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,796
It’s safe to take it off.

798
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:33,236
They hold prisoners at the back end of this building.

799
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,539
We have to be careful not to alert any patrols.

800
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,412
Should we take ’em down?

801
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,448
We have to avoid any conflicts.

802
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,716
We’re on hybrids territory now.

803
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:57,327
Looks like the hallway splits up ahead.

804
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,297
We’ll take the left, you guys go right.

805
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,274
Move out.

806
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,954
The sooner we can get Henri back to our ship,

807
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,590
the sooner we can get out of here for good.

808
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,129
What do I do?

809
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,098
We only have one shot at this.

810
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,399
Follow my lead and take the low road.

811
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,236
-What? -Trust me!

812
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,571
Swing!

813
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:42,873
Lunge!

814
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,280
Stop!

815
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,349
We wanna keep him alive?

816
00:50:52,415 --> 00:50:54,384
We draw blood, we draw attention, remember?

817
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,391
[speaking Russian]

818
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,303
He drew blood to alert the guards.

819
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,172
I knew we should have killed him.

820
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,706
We have to get out of here, go.

821
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,709
-Go, go, go! -Go, go, go!

822
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,713
Can’t risk it.

823
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,718
We found Henri!

824
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,825
Henri, oh, my God.

825
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,027
I’m sorry, I...

826
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,628
I tried my best, but I just...

827
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,966
The ship, it’s not safe.

828
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,936
What are you talking about?

829
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:49,973
The sharks, they’re gonna use the ship to get back to Earth.

830
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,976
They have an army of eggs that they’re gonna hatch there.

831
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,480
Earth has all the resources they need

832
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,549
to become the dominant species.

833
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,750
Why wouldn’t they just use your ship?

834
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,653
Well, my ship is barely big enough

835
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,455
just for Akula and myself.

836
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,157
We don’t have enough fuel to reach Earth,

837
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:10,794
and we operate off the Cold War time technology.

838
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,597
So, there is no way to plot a course.

839
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,932
What about your ship?

840
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,369
We have to get back, now.

841
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,605
Michael, help Henri up.

842
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,406
Let’s get outta here.

843
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,875
[grunting]

844
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,614
Come on, this way.

845
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:36,786
Hurry!

846
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,968
Quick! In here. They’re running the other way.

847
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:01,611
What are these?

848
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,752
Uh, guys?

849
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,921
These are hybrid shark eggs.

850
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,524
This must be their incubation chamber.

851
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,526
There are so many.

852
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,029
Earth would never stand a chance.

853
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,298
We should destroy them now.

854
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,999
No!

855
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,534
Those are innocent children.

856
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,303
They haven’t done anything wrong.

857
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,604
Children?

858
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:31,174
Those are monsters, killing machines.

859
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,277
From what I heard about humans, they’re not better.

860
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,480
Should we kill all the humans, too?

861
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,915
If we stop them now,

862
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,084
we can prevent an invasion from ever happening.

863
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:44,454
Those things have millions of soldiers stockpiled,

864
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,989
ready to attack at any minute.

865
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,857
If we destroy them now,

866
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,961
it’ll take them decades to recover, if they ever do.

867
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,808
They’re sounding an alarm!

868
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,476
We’ve lingered here too long.

869
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,078
We have to get out of here, now!

870
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,579
Go, hurry!

871
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:20,423
Move slowly and quietly. The sharks know we’re here now.

872
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:32,902
Magnificent. Just like you and me... sister.

873
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,171
No...

874
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,440
don’t group me in with your kind, Selah.

875
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,142
From the moment I was born,

876
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,778
it was made very clear to me that I’m not one of you.

877
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,854
Where is Akula?

878
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,057
Akula?

879
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,125
Akula!

880
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,029
They abandoned me, and you did nothing.

881
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,865
I spared your life!

882
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,402
They wanted to kill you, but I wouldn’t let them.

883
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,837
I knew the human would take you in.

884
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,306
Weak, predictable humans.

885
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,041
My human has shown me more kindness

886
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:15,044
from the very beginning than any hybrid ever has.

887
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,613
Think, Akula.

888
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,715
You are the link between human and shark.

889
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,050
I knew it then and I know it now.

890
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,086
We need you.

891
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,589
That changes nothing.

892
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,525
I know all about your plans.

893
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:32,862
We are returning home. To where we belong.

894
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,998
Not if you’re going to kill off humanity.

895
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:36,900
I won’t let you.

896
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,403
You can watch from here or you...

897
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,839
we could finally go home.

898
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:54,083
[speaking Russian]

899
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,524
Don’t scare me like that again!

900
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,026
Where have you been?

901
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,695
I heard something.

902
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,063
Could we steal one of the sharks’ rovers

903
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:07,897
outside the building?

904
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,033
Yes, we have to get out of here.

905
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:11,734
Perfect. Henri?

906
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,002
All good, Commander.

907
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:20,777
We don’t have time for this.

908
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,348
Michael!

909
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:26,883
It’s either us or them.

910
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,121
Get out! Get out!

911
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,997
Commander...

912
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,599
Commander Tress, can you hear me?

913
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,167
It’s no use, Tom.

914
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,970
We need to keep working until someone gets back.

915
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,672
I hate feeling so helpless.

916
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,442
Me too, but we have our plants,

917
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,845
Liam’s experiments, and our back-up oxygen reserves.

918
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,548
We could survive for months if we need to.

919
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:03,219
Yeah, you’re right.

920
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:04,787
Well, let’s just...

921
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,155
-[clanging] -Oh!

922
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,156
What was that?

923
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,295
-The habitation chamber, hurry! -Go, go, go.

924
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,107
Those look like shark teeth.

925
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:25,942
Sharks on the moon... that’s what that was, yeah?

926
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,677
Whatever it is, we cannot let it destroy

927
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,780
the life support systems, we’ll never make it back if they do.

928
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,920
-Ah! -Josie!

929
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,399
Which way to the rovers?

930
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:52,001
Those were children... babies.

931
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,470
I did what I had to to survive.

932
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,872
I saved our asses.

933
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,740
And it’s not like I killed all of them,

934
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,975
just a drop in the bucket.

935
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:02,378
Enough! We have to move.

936
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:04,247
They’ll be on us any second.

937
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,886
We have to stick together or die alone, got it?

938
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,090
Akula, lead the way.

939
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,637
Get in.

940
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,385
We gotta lose him.

941
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:43,786
Hold on!

942
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,563
Uh, he’s still there.

943
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,565
Take him out.

944
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,933
My pleasure.

945
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,041
Nice shot.

946
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,044
It will be back... that wasn’t a kill shot.

947
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,480
But you bought us precious time.

948
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:13,383
All we need, just keep moving.

949
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,518
That’s an infrared communication device,

950
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:16,653
same we’ve got in our suits.

951
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,155
Ellie? Tom?

952
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,424
Josie? Owen? Can anybody hear me?

953
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:24,861
This is Commander Nicole Tress.

954
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:26,229
If anyone can hear me,

955
00:59:26,295 --> 00:59:27,797
we got aggressive company coming in hot.

956
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:29,432
Do what you can to arm the ship.

957
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,767
You must keep it safe.

958
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,670
I repeat, protect the ship at all costs.

959
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,104
All right, everyone, keep an eye out...

960
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,440
we don’t want any more surprises, got it?

961
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,452
Everyone inside, hurry.

962
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,793
We’re too late.

963
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,561
Come on, we gotta help them.

964
00:59:58,628 --> 00:59:59,696
How many were inside?

965
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,097
Four.

966
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,281
Where is everyone?

967
01:00:18,347 --> 01:00:20,917
No bodies and no blood.

968
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:22,385
We need to go room to room

969
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,855
and see if we can find any of your people.

970
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,258
Akula, stay by me.

971
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,442
What happened here?

972
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,777
[gasping]

973
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,212
Oh! Nicole!

974
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:51,914
-You’re back! -Josie! Tom!

975
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:52,949
Where’s everyone else?

976
01:00:53,015 --> 01:00:54,617
They’re not with you?

977
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,054
They went looking for you hours ago, and we’ve had no word.

978
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:01,858
Liam as well.

979
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,697
We think there’s some sharks still out there,

980
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,332
just not sure where.

981
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:10,533
They are sharks, right?

982
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,002
Yes, and that’s why we need to make sure

983
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,704
we have everything armed against them.

984
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:15,872
Hold on, wait...

985
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:16,873
who are they?

986
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,941
What are you wearing,

987
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,510
And why doesn’t she have oxygen?

988
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,380
We’ll explain everything later.

989
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,015
That’s Sergei, that’s Akula,

990
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,450
and the only thing you need to know right now

991
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,752
is we need to get back to Earth now,

992
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,287
with these two as part of the crew.

993
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,556
Good, I plotted us a course home,

994
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:36,058
but we only have four hours and 15 minute window.

995
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,060
If we repair breaches in the hull,

996
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:41,230
we can use some of our spare oxygen tanks as...

997
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,800
well, as the algae-based biofuel I’ve been working on

998
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,601
to jump-start the ship.

999
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,971
Great, the sooner we get off this rock, the better.

1000
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,973
Henri, do you think you can help Tom?

1001
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,644
Oh, my God, Henri, what happened?

1002
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,579
That’s how they were able to find the ship.

1003
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,681
They tortured me.

1004
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,483
What? You did what?

1005
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,651
Stop!

1006
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:03,386
Josie, you tell Sergei what else you need.

1007
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:05,588
Akula, you come with us to the command module

1008
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,890
to help Tom and Henri.

1009
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,458
First, we need to repair the entrance.

1010
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:13,329
And I will not let Akula to be out of my sight again.

1011
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,531
If Nicole needs my help to get off the moon,

1012
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,300
then you need to let me come with her.

1013
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,436
[clanging]

1014
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,143
They’re back!

1015
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,683
How many are there?

1016
01:02:33,749 --> 01:02:36,252
Ten, 20... a lot.

1017
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,720
There are too many of them.

1018
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,622
And this... just a stupid baby.

1019
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:43,926
There is no way we can kill them fast enough with our harpoons.

1020
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,261
We need a new plan.

1021
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,168
I’ve got this.

1022
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,103
-Henri, no! -That’s too dangerous!

1023
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,905
You have plenty of capable people here

1024
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,139
that can repair the ship.

1025
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,008
Josie and Tom figured out a way home,

1026
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,544
Akula and Sergei have been stuck here for 40 years,

1027
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,813
and all I did was give up the location.

1028
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,014
Now I’m gonna fix it.

1029
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,549
What is he doing?

1030
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,619
Saving your asses... and no one’s gonna stop me.

1031
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,520
-My mind’s already made up. -Wait...

1032
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,422
I’m the commander, I should be doing this

1033
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,559
That’s exactly what you need to do, Commander... command.

1034
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,160
No, let him go.

1035
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,196
He’s the reason why we’re in this mess.

1036
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:24,400
You can barely stand on one foot.

1037
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,869
The sharks were gonna find us no matter what.

1038
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,604
No, they’re right.

1039
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,140
I’ll draw them away from the ship

1040
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:33,142
and then I’ll take care of them.

1041
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,044
Hopefully, I’ll be able to give them the slip,

1042
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:37,446
and then together, we can get home.

1043
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,823
If we return, I will make sure you receive

1044
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,393
the highest possible commendations.

1045
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,595
When we get home, Commander.

1046
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,450
All right, everyone, take cover.

1047
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,141
Ah!

1048
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,187
Die, you son of a bitch!

1049
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:05,201
All clear.

1050
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:06,736
Henri’s sacrifice won’t be forgotten.

1051
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,406
All right, team, we have work to do.

1052
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:11,574
Tom?

1053
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,144
Yeah.

1054
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,480
Seal off this section, plot us a course home.

1055
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,717
I’ll take care of the breach.

1056
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:22,718
Akula.

1057
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,156
Roger that, Commander.

1058
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,524
Follow me.

1059
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,109
Adjusting for our new weight,

1060
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:50,780
using the moon’s gravitational pull to our advantage,

1061
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,314
I think we can pull this off.

1062
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:57,753
Our flight path is clear, but...

1063
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,188
But what?

1064
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,090
We have less time than I thought.

1065
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,025
How much time we talking?

1066
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,527
Twenty-four minutes and 37 seconds.

1067
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,995
You said we had four hours!

1068
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,631
I forgot to adjust the amount of force required

1069
01:06:08,697 --> 01:06:10,366
to get us to the speed to successfully

1070
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,801
fling us to the near side.

1071
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,669
Our initial launch didn’t account for us

1072
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,704
being on the far side.

1073
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,646
I just fixed the hull breach.

1074
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:26,849
Let’s everyone be ready so we can hit that window.

1075
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:29,385
Let’s move.

1076
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,786
More sharks will be showing up any second.

1077
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,125
Oh, no.

1078
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:39,061
What? What is it?

1079
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,463
They’re here.

1080
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,139
They’re loading up the eggs!

1081
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,176
They’re boarding the ship.

1082
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,615
Who is that?

1083
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:06,155
That’s Tzarina Selah. She’s their leader.

1084
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,595
[Selah] Search the ship! Kill all who remain.

1085
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,196
We still need to seal the interior hull

1086
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:15,531
before we can take off.

1087
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:16,966
You’re not wearing protective suits.

1088
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:19,802
They can detect your electromagnetic signature.

1089
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,439
Stay near electronics... they’ll go after you first.

1090
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,574
I need to download the flight plan onto my drive.

1091
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,510
We can’t let them have it.

1092
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,545
We have to hold on to that.

1093
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,946
[banging]

1094
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,649
We can’t risk it, we need everyone alive.

1095
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,585
Find a place to hide, and attack only when necessary.

1096
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:44,360
Everyone hide, now!

1097
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:59,268
Ah!

1098
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,708
Come on, come on...

1099
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:07,409
Got it!

1100
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,714
Oh, shit.

1101
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,888
Tom...

1102
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,760
Ah!

1103
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,829
You’re a freak of nature, you know that?

1104
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,936
Do your worst.

1105
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,009
Stop!

1106
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,514
We surrender.

1107
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,552
Akula, sister.

1108
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,888
You should have taken me up on my offer.

1109
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:29,258
After all, none of this could have happened without your help.

1110
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,793
What offer? What help?

1111
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,761
How do you think we learned how to fly a ship?

1112
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,396
When you were out hunting us,

1113
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:37,099
we sent some hybrids to break into your ship

1114
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,634
and learn everything they could.

1115
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,336
I didn’t know, Papa.

1116
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,438
I had no idea.

1117
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,106
Don’t be modest.

1118
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:47,042
Now you have a chance to live among your real family

1119
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:51,146
and be a leader of our people on Earth.

1120
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:52,481
Is it true?

1121
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,017
She offered it, yes,

1122
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,487
but I never considered it, not for a moment.

1123
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:01,724
Sharks are not my family.

1124
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,326
They left me for dead.

1125
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,928
You are my family.

1126
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:09,531
Exactly why we abandoned you near his ship to begin with.

1127
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:13,702
Our plan was executed perfectly. All thanks to you.

1128
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,105
I swear, I didn’t know, Papa.

1129
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:17,106
You believe me, right?

1130
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,109
I trust you.

1131
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,045
She’s my daughter.

1132
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,448
I trust her with my life.

1133
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:33,088
Selah, it’s not too late.

1134
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:39,194
You could continue your good work here.

1135
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:42,164
We can go back to Earth and return with supplies.

1136
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:45,567
You could grow and thrive.

1137
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,936
Just let us go.

1138
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,839
Humans made you...

1139
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:52,441
we can help you.

1140
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,710
I’d rather take Earth for my own.

1141
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,546
We’re leaving... now.

1142
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,502
We need to get off this ship.

1143
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,873
Guards don’t speak English.

1144
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,876
I don’t think we can trust her anymore.

1145
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,678
What more does she have to do?

1146
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:32,014
She’s saved your ass more times today than I can count.

1147
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,950
She’s proven herself to be worth not only our trust,

1148
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,018
but our respect.

1149
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,254
I believe you.

1150
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,289
Thank you.

1151
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:41,490
I believe you, too.

1152
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:52,067
I suppose if you’re in here with us, you’re one of us.

1153
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,036
So, we’re good?

1154
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:55,237
Sure.

1155
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,975
Okay, maybe there’s a way out of here.

1156
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,177
If we can get out, maybe there’s something on your ship.

1157
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,812
No, there’s...

1158
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,885
Oh, my God, they’re gonna torture us.

1159
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:11,820
Not without a fight, they aren’t.

1160
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,829
Gotcha.

1161
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,365
[All] Henri!

1162
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:26,268
Henri!

1163
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:29,838
Ah!

1164
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,316
Tom’s USB.

1165
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,227
The flight plans!

1166
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,595
If we can get this back to your ship, Sergei,

1167
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,197
we can use this to get back

1168
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,965
and warn Earth that the sharks aren’t to be trusted.

1169
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,134
We could fight!

1170
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,675
There!

1171
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,313
Depressurizing.

1172
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:18,587
They’ll be here any second, hurry!

1173
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,489
It looks to be about 50 feet down.

1174
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:21,957
It’s only gonna get further,

1175
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:24,293
and gravity’s gonna slow you down, now, go!

1176
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,595
One at a time to be safe.

1177
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:32,768
Come on, hurry!

1178
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:35,237
I’ll go first, so I can catch you when you land.

1179
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,605
I’m not a kid anymore.

1180
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:39,274
I will not let you to be hurt.

1181
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:40,776
Wait for my command!

1182
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,721
Akula, jump!

1183
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:55,891
Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

1184
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:59,861
Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

1185
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,698
-You next. -No, you!

1186
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,866
Stop!

1187
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:07,202
-Change of plans. -Ah!

1188
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,409
[grunts]

1189
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,410
Where is Akula?

1190
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:16,445
Are you all right, boss?

1191
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:18,280
Yeah, I’m fine.

1192
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,549
[speaking Russian]

1193
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:22,618
I wish I could take credit.

1194
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,821
Scar...

1195
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:28,857
But it was a human that killed your precious bodyguard.

1196
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:38,900
It’s Akula...

1197
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,936
and something else.

1198
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,007
Akula.

1199
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,510
Is that the tzarina?

1200
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,112
It was.

1201
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,447
Pretty sure she got some brain damage, or worse.

1202
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:53,915
Guys...

1203
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,091
My ship is not far away... run!

1204
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,202
Over here!

1205
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:15,637
I’ve set up a perimeter of booby traps

1206
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,139
that will help slow them down.

1207
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:35,590
There is a way we can destroy the rest of the sharks,

1208
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,459
and maybe, if we are lucky,

1209
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,728
we can destroy their ship before it gets too far.

1210
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:40,996
Out with it!

1211
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,464
What? What is it?

1212
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:45,333
The nitrogen-enriched soil I use to grow crops

1213
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,669
can be used to make an explosion.

1214
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:51,239
I can’t believe that I didn’t think of this sooner.

1215
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,911
There is no bomb that you can make that will reach the sharks.

1216
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:57,579
Yes, but I can make the ones

1217
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:01,416
that would aggravate the magma under the moon’s surface.

1218
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,086
I can fly my rocket straight into the center.

1219
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,955
It’s the only way.

1220
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:10,425
But you’ll die!

1221
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:16,298
Anything will be wiped out on the surface within 50 miles.

1222
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:17,699
Including us.

1223
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:20,802
The geo-thermal disturbance will create tidal waves of lava

1224
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:24,206
that will spread easily over 50 miles.

1225
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:30,212
Looks like they’re flanking us, we have to move... run.

1226
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:51,767
That’s not going to hold long.

1227
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,101
She doesn’t have much,

1228
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:58,540
but controls still working, engine runs.

1229
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,376
And we just have enough fuel for one shot.

1230
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:06,181
I can do it all by myself, but I need you buy me some time.

1231
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,050
There has to be a better way.

1232
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,652
We don’t have time.

1233
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,287
They’re already here.

1234
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,922
Sergei, no!

1235
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,124
I’ll stay with you, I’ll...

1236
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,494
Akula, my sweet daughter,

1237
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:21,229
my dearest daughter,

1238
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,932
I’m finally ready to do something by myself.

1239
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:27,335
I need you to go with Nicole and Michael,

1240
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:32,707
and keep the hybrids off my back so we can destroy them.

1241
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,977
You are the best fighter I know.

1242
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,846
You can do it.

1243
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,048
Spasiba, Papa.

1244
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,155
[speaks Russian]

1245
01:18:51,726 --> 01:18:53,061
Keep it with you.

1246
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:55,664
I’ve always saved it for the long time,

1247
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,265
while we land in the sea.

1248
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,300
Keep it on you.

1249
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:00,402
When you land, it will do the job.

1250
01:19:00,468 --> 01:19:03,438
Trust me... it will do the job.

1251
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,512
Now, go.

1252
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,415
Please keep them off my back so we can break theirs.

1253
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,117
Go!

1254
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:24,693
You ready?

1255
01:19:24,759 --> 01:19:27,495
Ready?

1256
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:28,597
Who could be?

1257
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,466
Well, too bad.

1258
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,612
Ha!

1259
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:46,314
Ah!

01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,647
Okay, old lady...

1263
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,181
show me what you’ve got.

Ah!

01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,093
[speaking Russian]

1270
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:07,882
[panting]

1271
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,964
What on Earth?

1272
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,999
Exactly!

1273
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:28,736
Earth!

1274
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:30,004
We’re here!

1275
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,740
I can’t believe we’re here!

1276
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:36,878
Papa was right... we’re home, thanks to Papa.

1277
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:39,747
We’ll make sure his sacrifice is not forgotten.

1278
01:23:41,749 --> 01:23:44,319
Papa described Earth to me, and he was right.

1279
01:23:44,385 --> 01:23:48,123
He said it would eclipse all of my wildest imagination.

1280
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,258
Oh, it’s beautiful, Papa!

1281
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:52,494
It really is.

1282
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,230
I’m never gonna take it for granted again.

1283
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,034
We need to figure out how to get back.

1284
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:04,973
Maybe wait till dark, plot a detailed course with the stars.

1285
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:07,208
Oh, it hurts...

1286
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:08,576
oh, it really, really hurts, ugh!

1287
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,445
Akula! Where does it hurt?

1288
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:12,180
It’s coming in waves!

1289
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:15,383
All right, just breathe, deep breaths.

1290
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,418
[heavy breathing]

1291
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:22,891
Akula, did you maybe have any sort of...

1292
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,627
relationship with any of the shark hybrids?

1293
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:27,829
What? No!

1294
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,364
Ah!

1295
01:24:32,066 --> 01:24:33,768
Akula, I think you’re pregnant.

1296
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:34,969
What?

1297
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:36,304
How is it possible?

1298
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,640
Automatic parthenogenesis?

1299
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:41,342
Sergei mentioned it happening to the other sharks.

1300
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,515
Akula, push!

1301
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:52,420
[screams]

1302
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:05,567
It’s... it’s adorable!

1303
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:08,770
Oh, great... now we have another mouth to feed.

1304
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,306
Ah!

1305
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:13,608
Son of a bitch, these teeth are sharp!

1306
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:16,978
Nicole, I’ve got to take care of my babies!

1307
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:19,414
Akula!

1308
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,621
Akula! Akula!

1309
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:32,560
We’re so fu--
