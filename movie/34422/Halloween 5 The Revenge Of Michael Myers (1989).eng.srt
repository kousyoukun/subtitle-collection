1
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:07,968
Die ...

2
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,514
you ... son of a bitch!

3
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:24,527
Jamie ...

4
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,654
I want you to stay in the car.

5
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:39,166
Jamie!

6
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,669
Get away!
- Don't touch him, Jamie!

7
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:44,922
That's him.

8
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,382
Don't hit the girl.

9
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,093
Get down!

10
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,487
I don't get it, what happened?

11
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:13,284
He's gotta be down there!

12
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:29,592
Do it!

13
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,926
Stand back!

14
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,951
Quiet, Tuki.

15
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:40,246
Be quiet!

16
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:21,453
There's nothing out there, Tuki.

17
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:09,668
No.

18
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:15,508
No!

19
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:23,849
Come on, Jamie.
Your bath is ready.

20
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:36,445
No!

21
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:39,319
Jamie! No!

22
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,750
It's all right.

23
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,752
It's all right, darling.

24
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,963
Oh, Jamie.

25
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:44,464
Jamie ...

26
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:45,924
Jamie!

27
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:49,177
It's just another one of your nightmares, that's all!

28
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,263
Oh ...
Oh.

29
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,807
Oh, darling. Look at me, look at me.

30
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,851
Do you want me to call your mom?

31
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:57,561
Oh!

32
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:01,231
Oh, Jamie.
Jamie.

33
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,130
I'll call the doctor.

34
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:11,679
Oh, Jamie!

35
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,473
Oh, Jamie!

36
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,267
Jamie!
Doctor!

37
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:19,938
Get a gurney!

38
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,648
Somebody!

39
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:23,691
Come on!
- Okay.

40
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:24,609
Yeah. It's ready.

41
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,363
Go! ... Go!
- Jamie ...

42
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:28,364
... breathe!

43
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,032
Breathe, Jamie!

44
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,742
Jamie, breathe.

45
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:35,246
Prep e.r.! Tracheotomy. Go!
- No!

46
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:37,748
Hang on, Jamie. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

47
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,626
All right, down.
- There you go.

48
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,211
Easy, easy, easy, doc.

49
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,714
You got her up there?
- Yeah. Steady, steady.

50
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:53,222
She needs oxygen!

51
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,766
All right, unstrap her.

52
00:08:58,936 --> 00:08:59,812
All right.

53
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:11,991
No!

54
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:12,784
No!
- What are you doing?

55
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:15,287
Leave her!
- This girl is dying!

56
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:20,584
I have to open her trachea, for God's sake!
- She will stabilize.
- She's dying!

57
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:21,751
No.

58
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,511
Do you see?

59
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:32,806
I see you still want this girl dead.

60
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,352
She has something to tell us.

61
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,007
Hey there, funny face.

62
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,179
What?

63
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,142
Thank you.

64
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:22,107
Hey! Hey, open up!

65
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:23,734
Max!

66
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,194
Max!

67
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:29,031
They don't allow Max in here.
- Get in there, Max.

68
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:31,075
You know.

69
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:33,452
You know what they can do if they can't take a joke.

70
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:35,412
She doesn't even remember.

71
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,123
Is she really better?

72
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,002
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

73
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:46,549
Give me some of this action, baby.

74
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,468
What?

75
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:56,225
I wonder what Rachel's hiding
behind door number three.

76
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:12,116
It looks so good. It'll be so cute.

77
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:15,202
Billy ...

78
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,414
... is going to have to fight off a lot of boys.
- Billy is gonna freak.

79
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,417
What is going on here?

80
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,550
Gee. I'm sorry.

81
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,051
Come on, Max. Here.

82
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,929
Bye, sweetie, love you.

83
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:40,153
I'll be back in two days ... okay?

84
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,899
Mom and dad send their love.

85
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,261
How could they?

86
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,057
When are they gonna realize that she is not him?
She's just a child.

87
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:15,976
They know that Michael Myers is her uncle.

88
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,897
And that she attacked her stepmother.
That's why they fear her.

89
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,149
Especially on Halloween.

90
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,236
I never should've let my parents talk me into leaving.

91
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,071
I don't know, what I was thinking.

92
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,573
You are afraid and ..
- I am not.

93
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:33,994
You're afraid the whole thing might start ...
to happen again.

94
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,665
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

95
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,418
And I suppose there's nothing wrong
with just leaving my little stepsister here alone.

96
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,671
You can telephone her from the cabin.

97
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,465
She'll be properly looked after.

98
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,927
Then why do I still feel guilty?

99
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,973
I'm worried about Jamie.
- So, stick around.

100
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:58,185
I already promised my parents.
- Promises were made to be broken, babe. - I don't know.

101
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,440
The farm's parties always rock. Think about it.
- Okay. -  I gotta jet. Bye.
- Bye.

102
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:06,360
I'll be back with the outfits.
- See you, Tina.

103
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,028
Max!

104
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:11,073
Max, what is it?

105
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,616
Come on, Max.

106
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,202
Oh, come on.

107
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:42,688
Come on, Max!

108
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:45,441
Come on.

109
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:46,609
Yes.

110
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:02,833
Here. You want this?
- That's mine.

111
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,505
I want the green one.
- I used to like this. - Here is the red one.

112
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,972
I don't want the scissors.
- It's mine.

113
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,974
I got the hook on them.

114
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:23,401
Shut up, Max!

115
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:31,284
It's a joke.

116
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,795
Jamie?
- Max!

117
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,004
Max?

118
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:45,507
What'd she say?
- Okay.

119
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:48,177
All right!

120
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:51,514
Hold on a minute!

121
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:56,769
All right!

122
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:00,189
I'm coming!

123
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:01,899
Hello?

124
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,068
Are you all right?

125
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,112
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was just in the shower.

126
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:08,781
Is ... is Max all right?

127
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,368
Max is having fun.
He's been barking at a cat all morning.

128
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:13,536
Go and check him.

129
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:16,497
Well, why?
- Go and check him, now!

130
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:18,583
All right.

131
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,628
All right. Hold on.
I have to go downstairs.

132
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:25,047
Oh, brother.

133
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,211
Rachel?

134
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,590
<i>Dr. Loomis ...</i>

135
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,676
Max is gone.

136
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,470
Listen to me.

137
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:15,099
<i>Drop the phone, go to the nearest store.
Get out of the house.
Quickly! Now. Go on!</i>

138
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,028
Mr. Cornet!

139
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,583
Better find that out.

140
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,129
All clear. Nothing above, nothing below.

141
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,340
What about Max?

142
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,217
A dobie, right?

143
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,263
This is not happening to me.
Max!

144
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,890
Max, what have you done?

145
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,434
I'm so embarrassed.
- That's what we're here for.

146
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,646
Rescue cats. - Find dogs.
- That's our job. - And we love it.

147
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,484
Think so.

148
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,863
<i>Bye, sweetie.
I love you.</i>

149
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,573
<i>You be a good girl.</i>

150
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:11,740
<i>Bye.</i>

151
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,916
So, she was perfectly all right.

152
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,212
Come on, Billy.

153
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,716
I think Jamie needs to get some rest.

154
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,720
Jamie, are y-you okay?

155
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:34,306
Come on.

156
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,994
You sense something, don't you?

157
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:58,705
Tell me.

158
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,500
Tell me what you know!

159
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,919
Here, write. Write! Write!

160
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:08,548
Write, what you know.

161
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,510
Jamie, please!

162
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:14,763
Please.

163
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:47,796
Yeah.

164
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,356
Max?

165
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:23,255
Max?

166
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:08,884
No!

167
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:17,353
The tetanea should've taken effect by now.
Another dose might stop her heart.

168
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:20,065
She was shaking!

169
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,484
Her whole body was shaking!

170
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:26,154
Every time a little girl twitches,
I'm supposed to call out the National Guard.

171
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:29,866
How many people did he kill last year?
Have you forgotten?

172
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:34,704
Your own daughter. - I don't.
- No! Of course you don't forget!

173
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:36,706
How could you?

174
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,792
But you never looked into his face, did you?

175
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,710
You never saw his eyes.

176
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:42,337
You never saw that ...

177
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:43,713
... nothing ...

178
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:45,423
No expression.

179
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:46,758
Blank.

180
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,803
My memory goes back 12 years ...

181
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:51,596
to the night when I offered ...

182
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:53,598
I'm gonna show you.

183
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:57,018
Show you something.
Look, look. Look at this.

184
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:58,603
Look at that.

185
00:21:00,564 --> 00:21:01,940
I prayed ...

186
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:05,235
That he would burn ... in hell.

187
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:07,529
But in my heart ...

188
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:11,533
I knew that hell would not have him.

189
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,118
Sheriff?

190
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,832
They want you down at the cemetery.

191
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:30,929
Rachel?

192
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:33,974
Rachel?

193
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:44,276
Maxie!

194
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:48,947
Chill out, Max.

195
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:52,409
I'll get your water in a second.

196
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:56,997
Rachel?

197
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,584
Rachel?

198
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:03,879
Rachel? Rachel?

199
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:08,592
Rachel. I got you a present.

200
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:11,261
Rachel!

201
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:18,685
Rachel?

202
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,194
Rachel!

203
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,038
Rachel?

204
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:50,717
Gonna miss you, baby!

205
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,646
Sammy!

206
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:56,958
It's Halloween, right?
- Can you believe we have this whole house
to ourselves for the weekend?

207
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,878
But Tina, that's what you've said before, remember?

208
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:03,048
Oh, Sammy, are all your circuits on hold or what?

209
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:10,305
Tina, I thought Rachel was lurking around.

210
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:11,681
Oh, I did too ...

211
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:15,185
But I guess she decided to go up to the
country with her parents.

212
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:18,438
Oh, Max!
Shut your canine trap!

213
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:21,650
What if my mom calls and finds out ...

214
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,276
... Rachel's not here with us, huh?

215
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,904
Just joking!

216
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:52,974
Sammy, why don't you bag spitz tonight?

217
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:56,811
I couldn't do that.- Oh, sure you could.
- Oh, no, I can't.

218
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,605
Come on. Ooh, you're blushing.

219
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,399
Come on.

220
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:03,734
Come on. You can't hide anything from me.

221
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:08,030
Come on.
- This may be it.

222
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,282
"It"?

223
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,659
What are you saying?

224
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:15,204
I can't talk to you about this.
- Oh, come on.

225
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:18,875
Come on. I mean, you're planning something.
What are we talking here like ...

226
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,126
candles and ...

227
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:21,377
... and a ...

228
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:25,047
sensual massage and ...

229
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,008
leopard sheets.

230
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:28,467
Satin.

231
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:31,637
Satin sheets?
- They're Rachel's!

232
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,975
I just flipped my skirt!

233
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:38,144
What do you want me to do?
What can I do? What can I do? I mean ...

234
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:41,063
Do you wanna make up signals or something?
- Enough!

235
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:44,151
What? Come on.
You guys can have the house to yourselves.

236
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:45,611
It's cool.

237
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,572
Mikey and I like it in the car.

238
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,621
Oh, honey. Don't worry about it.
- I'm not worried.

239
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,874
I've just been in
a weird mood all day.

240
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,752
Everybody in this town is in a weird mood.

241
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:03,546
They should ban Halloween in this town.

242
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:07,092
Michael!

243
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:08,511
What?!

244
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:18,648
Hi.

245
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:22,777
Hey, you're just in time to give us a ride.

246
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,074
Come on, Sammy.
He's sorry about last weekend.

247
00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:30,576
Aren't you, Mikey?

248
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:31,619
No.

249
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:34,163
See?

250
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,791
Tina, I thought you wanted to see Jamie.

251
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,876
Look, you're killing me, babe.

252
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:41,087
Would you just get in?

253
00:26:41,337 --> 00:26:42,964
We can go later, right Mikey?

254
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:43,881
Right?

255
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:39,254
It's all right.

256
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:41,047
It's all right.

257
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:46,845
What are you doing down here?

258
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,891
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
- There you are.

259
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:54,394
We've been looking all over for you.

260
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:55,436
Come to me, baby.

261
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:56,479
Come on.

262
00:28:58,147 --> 00:28:59,148
What happened?

263
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:01,734
Was it one of your dreams again?

264
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:03,820
Okay, come on.

265
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:08,199
You gotta help me, Jamie.

266
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,994
You gotta help me to find him.

267
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,289
We both know he's alive.

268
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:17,000
But you know where he is!

269
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:18,960
Why?

270
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:21,880
Why are you protecting him?

271
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:24,507
Why?

272
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,553
What about your stepmother, Jamie?

273
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:31,973
You love her, don't you?
He made you stab her.

274
00:29:35,977 --> 00:29:39,397
You cannot hide from him.
He'll always get to you.

275
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:43,318
Jamie.
Jamie, listen.

276
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,488
Today in the cemetery ...

277
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:48,699
... somebody dug up a coffin.

278
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:53,162
It was a coffin of a nine-year-old girl.

279
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:58,000
What do you think he's going to do with that?!

280
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,506
You're nine years old ...

281
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,758
... aren't you, Jamie?

282
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:07,384
Dr. Loomis ...

283
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,595
Leave the little girl alone.

284
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,851
Tears won't get you anywhere.

285
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:19,564
Help me to find him.

286
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,609
We'll find him together!

287
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:27,448
There's a reason, why he has this power over you.

288
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:31,828
Did you ever wonder what it is?

289
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:35,790
Baby?

290
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:50,847
He's still inside.

291
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:53,307
Okay.
- Excuse me.

292
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:57,103
Where is the bus stop for Chicago?
- Let's see, are you going to the Blooming Hill?

293
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,365
Michael?

294
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,882
Have you come home ...

295
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,383
... Michael?

296
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:10,138
I know what you want from her.

297
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:37,251
Don't you like the mask just a little bit?

298
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:42,005
Yeah, maybe you don't even need to wear a mask, baby.

299
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:50,055
* Baby, I'm yours *

300
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,975
* Baby, I'm ready *

301
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,185
Bruised, but ready.

302
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:56,854
Hi.

303
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:12,286
Friends of yours?

304
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,293
So, how many cases can we get?
- Three cases.

305
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:22,337
Any more, I think old Mr. Casey
would know something's up.

306
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:24,965
But we gotta get going.
Shift changes pretty soon.

307
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,053
You gonna pull around back
or should we both get busted out front here?

308
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,557
Oh, Mike.

309
00:35:33,017 --> 00:35:34,476
Nice wax job.

310
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,937
You touch the car again and you're dead.

311
00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:37,980
Okay?

312
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:38,898
Okay.

313
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:40,191
Thank you.

314
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:44,320
You're gonna get high blood pressure, Mikey.

315
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:46,030
Pick me up at 8:00 at Rachel's, okay?

316
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:48,532
We gotta get ready for the tower farm party.

317
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:49,783
Hey Mikey ...

318
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:51,660
wanna go have your legs waxed?

319
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:10,347
All right, that's it. Now, go, go, go.
And don't drink it all before we get there, okay?

320
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:17,354
Idiot.

321
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:38,837
What the ...

322
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:43,925
Okay, asshole.

323
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:45,802
You wanna play?!

324
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:50,056
Trick or treat!

325
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:10,618
Three, two, one.

326
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,120
Can you hear me up here?

327
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:14,789
Testing: one, two, three.

328
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:23,590
Ooh, my.
Aren't you pretty?

329
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,972
These are ...
for you.

330
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,770
Aren't they beautiful?

331
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,440
We'll have to put them in water.

332
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:47,864
... yeah.
- It's great.

333
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:52,120
It ...

334
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,831
It's ... good luck.

335
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,382
First of all I'd like to thank you parents for supporting ...

336
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:09,137
... us tonight. Now, what we've all been waiting for
our annual Halloween ...

337
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:15,060
... costume pageant! Our first couple is Jenny Hogel
and Christian McGint. Give them a big hand.

338
00:38:56,104 --> 00:39:00,108
Next is Tony Larkin and Diane Lewis.
- Jamie, come on.

339
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:05,488
Tina!

340
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:08,074
Queen of room service.

341
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:16,791
Michael, open the door.

342
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:19,294
Mike!

343
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:26,342
Michael, it's cold out here!
Come on, open the door!

344
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:29,137
Mikey.

345
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:32,557
Mikey.

346
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:38,021
Thank you for being such a gentleman.

347
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,400
And now we have Billy Hill and Jamie Groder.

348
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,197
You're wearing my present.

349
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,534
I want you to know ...

350
00:39:52,911 --> 00:39:55,413
I just love barbaric men.

351
00:39:57,707 --> 00:40:01,794
Jamie as a princess. Give her a big hand.
- Jamie.

352
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:02,754
Jamie.

353
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:04,631
Jamie, come on.

354
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:07,258
Michael, don't I even get a kiss?

355
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:16,812
Well, I can't resist your new look.

356
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:20,233
Jamie, come on.

357
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,827
It feels creepy.

358
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:42,381
I think. I think she's gonna fall down!

359
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:44,466
Jamie.

360
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,430
Jamie!

361
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:53,934
Jamie!

362
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:01,024
Just great.

363
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,152
The old silent treatment, huh, Mike?

364
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:05,529
What'd I do wrong this time, huh?

365
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:08,657
Is it because I wanna see Jamie?

366
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:16,081
Nothing, Mike. That's what I get. Nothing!

367
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,377
Stop here. I want a pack of cigarettes.

368
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:26,842
I said, stop the goddamn car!
I want a pack of cigarettes!

369
00:41:30,223 --> 00:41:31,183
Come on.

370
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:42,277
Great.

371
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,738
Psycho boyfriend.

372
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:52,329
Jamie.

373
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:57,459
Tina. Is she in danger? Where is she?
- No. We gotta get her arm.
- Where is she?

374
00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:00,128
Tina. Where is she, Jamie?

375
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:07,636
Jamie.

376
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,387
You've got to help us!

377
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,806
Get Meeker on the line.

378
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:14,059
Sergeant Meeker, what's your 20?
- St ... ore!

379
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:19,064
Store!

380
00:42:20,232 --> 00:42:21,316
Store?

381
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:25,695
What kind of store?
What do they sell there?

382
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:28,532
Nie ... er.

383
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,495
Lighter.
- No!

384
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:38,542
What do they? What do they sell?
- Big ...

385
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:44,172
Wo ... - Woman.
- A big woman? A big woman who works?

386
00:42:44,256 --> 00:42:47,592
Works in the store?
- No!

387
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:50,262
What? Jamie, what?

388
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:55,809
Cookie woman!
- Cookie wo ... woman.

389
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:57,853
Cookie woman?

390
00:42:58,854 --> 00:42:59,896
Cookie woman.

391
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,107
Dale's gas station. Fifth and maine.

392
00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:26,925
Tina Williams!

393
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,636
If you are Tna Williams, stay where you are!

394
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:36,185
Check the inside!

395
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:41,398
<i>She appears unharmed.
- What the hell's going on!? I'm fine!</i>

396
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:43,650
Please, you gotta come with us to the clinic.

397
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:46,153
Is Jamie all right?

398
00:43:46,361 --> 00:43:47,446
Just get in the car.

399
00:43:52,451 --> 00:43:53,285
We're bringing her in.

400
00:43:54,828 --> 00:43:57,456
Unit 22. A-positive ...

401
00:43:58,123 --> 00:43:59,833
I don't believe this.
- Come on.

402
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:08,967
Tina!

403
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:12,012
Where's Jamie? Is something wrong?

404
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:17,059
Tina!

405
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,948
Say it again!

406
00:44:31,865 --> 00:44:33,742
T- T - Tina.

407
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:35,953
I love it!

408
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,125
Tina, don't go.
- I have to.

409
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,253
Why?
- Because!

410
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:44,338
You might not understand, but ...

411
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,051
When you're older, there are people you're gonna meet
who make you feel ...

412
00:44:49,134 --> 00:44:50,636
like, connected.

413
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:53,222
Like your heart is made of neon, and ...

414
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:55,891
When you find them, you have to be with them.

415
00:44:56,517 --> 00:44:59,770
But he was with you.
- Who?

416
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:03,816
The boogeyman.
- Oh, yeah. That's one way of describing him.

417
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,652
Tina. No!

418
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:10,698
Honey, I will come back later tonight
and I will sleep with you right here.

419
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,658
Tina!

420
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:15,202
I'll be back.
I love you.

421
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:18,539
Tina!

422
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,338
All right, buddy, let's hit the ... - All right you sto ...
- Why don't you stay the night?
- I'm sorry. I gotta run.

423
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:32,136
Tina, please. - Stay away, okay? You know.
You're really creepy filling that little girl
with all that boogeyman crap.

424
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:33,721
I believe that you're in danger.

425
00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:35,181
Jamie believes it too.

426
00:45:35,306 --> 00:45:38,475
Jamie's a nine-year-old girl.
- Be sensible!

427
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:41,438
I'm never sensible if I can help it!

428
00:45:42,147 --> 00:45:42,689
Tina!

429
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:44,065
I got these over here.

430
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:46,318
For God's sakes, stop her!

431
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,323
On whose orders?
- She hasn't done anything wrong.

432
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,367
Follow her, then!

433
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:55,286
At least you can do that!

434
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:57,038
If that girl ...

435
00:45:57,163 --> 00:46:01,250
... dies tonight ...
- All right, all right. For you, doc, anything.

436
00:46:09,886 --> 00:46:12,222
You guys supposed to be trailing me or something?

437
00:46:13,515 --> 00:46:16,100
Well, then you can give me a ride to the Tower Farm.

438
00:46:43,169 --> 00:46:45,713
Tina.
Gotta help Tina!

439
00:46:53,471 --> 00:46:57,100
Jamie's not in her room! She's nowhere in sight!

440
00:46:57,768 --> 00:47:00,437
Hey!
- Loomis!

441
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:03,107
What the hell are you doing?
- Jamie's gone.

442
00:47:14,492 --> 00:47:14,594
I'm gonna find Tina.

443
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:17,330
You ... you don't even know where sh ... she is.

444
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,624
But, I do.

445
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,126
Where?

446
00:47:20,209 --> 00:47:22,128
The Tower Farm.

447
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,135
Love your costume.
- Oh, baby!

448
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:34,642
Tina?

449
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:36,436
What?
- Where's Mike?

450
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:39,022
Ask me if I care.

451
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:43,445
What are you doing?

452
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,198
What are you doing?
- Sitting here.

453
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:58,668
What do you think?

454
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,962
Well, orders are orders.

455
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,299
That look like a life-threatening situation to you?

456
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:06,384
Nah.

457
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:09,429
Play crazy eights?

458
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,703
Spitz and I just had ...

459
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:34,164
... greatest night together.
- Yeah. What?

460
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:37,293
Let's go.

461
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:48,596
Oh, now wait. Hey, you cheated there.
- I did not cheat. - Come on

462
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:50,223
I did not cheat.

463
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:02,152
Take me, but spare my friend!

464
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:03,987
She's a virgin.

465
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:06,364
Got her phone number?

466
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:09,325
Do you think that's funny?

467
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:13,997
Hey, hey, no, man.
No. Hey, just a little Halloween prank, okay?

468
00:49:14,122 --> 00:49:16,624
Definitely not ... funny!

469
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,169
Somebody could easily be dead right now!

470
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:21,588
Fortunately, we're lousy cops.

471
00:49:22,005 --> 00:49:22,755
Sorry.

472
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,216
Hey, guys!

473
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:27,177
Hey.

474
00:49:27,552 --> 00:49:29,095
Look, what I found.

475
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:18,855
Ohh! Kittens!

476
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:21,233
Oh, look at 'em.

477
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:25,111
Hello.
Hello babies.

478
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:29,241
Hello.
Oh, they're so cute.

479
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:33,411
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
- Get 'em, Tina! Get 'em!

480
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:37,290
You, you, you, wait, wait, wait.
Thinking of getting kitten?

481
00:50:42,546 --> 00:50:44,464
Little, wee cat.

482
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:47,050
Kitten?

483
00:50:51,304 --> 00:50:52,472
Psst! Kitten.

484
00:50:53,348 --> 00:50:55,809
I'm coming to get you!

485
00:51:06,903 --> 00:51:07,696
Kitten?

486
00:51:23,466 --> 00:51:24,342
Kitten ...

487
00:51:24,467 --> 00:51:27,179
I hear you, but I don't see you.

488
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:44,613
Oh, my God.

489
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,793
What am I doing?
I hate cats.

490
00:52:01,547 --> 00:52:02,632
Sam?

491
00:52:05,468 --> 00:52:06,511
Sammy?

492
00:52:09,222 --> 00:52:10,556
Spitz?

493
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:28,910
I hate you!

494
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:32,580
Sorry. - God!
- Did you see her face?

495
00:52:32,997 --> 00:52:34,582
You guys!

496
00:52:37,836 --> 00:52:41,464
Fine, I'll just let myself out. Bye.
- I'll be right back.

497
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,264
Have fun.
- Okay.

498
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:06,114
Spitz!

499
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:12,453
What makes you think I'm gonna try and find you, huh?

500
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,379
I got you!

501
00:53:32,682 --> 00:53:35,268
I saw you.

502
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:49,659
Spitz, I'm out of here!

503
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,161
Good night!

504
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:06,718
Spitz.

505
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:10,013
Spitz!

506
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:15,060
Oh, my God!

507
00:54:16,772 --> 00:54:19,983
You son of a bitch!
You scared me half to death!

508
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,194
It wasn't funny!

509
00:56:23,152 --> 00:56:24,487
Spitz, no.

510
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:25,947
Spitz.
- Why?

511
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:26,948
Why?
- No.

512
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:29,283
What's the matter?
- Because I don't ... have anything.

513
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:43,858
You son of a bitch!

514
00:57:45,156 --> 00:57:46,616
That sounded different.

515
00:57:46,866 --> 00:57:50,620
Yeah, we never did stuff like that when we were kids.
- No, we were normal.

516
00:57:51,204 --> 00:57:53,122
Yeah, let's see what it is.

517
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:58,753
Hey, fella!

518
00:57:58,878 --> 00:58:00,004
Over here!

519
00:58:02,715 --> 00:58:06,427
Hey, come on. Enough's enough, all right?
- Somebody can get hurt with that thing.

520
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:08,679
Hey, somebody's gonna get hurt with that thing!

521
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:13,518
Unbelievable! No respect for authority anymore.

522
00:58:13,643 --> 00:58:15,853
Well, it's the parents.
- Yeah. - Hey!

523
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:19,065
All right, punk.
I'm through fooling around.

524
00:58:23,486 --> 00:58:24,821
Hey, Sarah!

525
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,703
So, you coming to the spring?
Oh, baby. You just wanna see me naked.
- I wouldn't mind.

526
00:58:33,996 --> 00:58:36,207
Come on. The hell with Mike. He ain't gonna show.

527
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:38,835
I can't leave Sam and Spitz.

528
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:42,257
Hurry, hurry!

529
00:58:47,428 --> 00:58:48,096
Hurry!

530
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:49,138
Come on!

531
00:59:08,032 --> 00:59:09,075
Sam?

532
00:59:10,535 --> 00:59:12,412
You guys?

533
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:17,043
You guys, I don't hear any noise.

534
00:59:18,003 --> 00:59:20,213
Are you sure you're doing it right?

535
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:32,100
You guys wanna come skinny-dipping?

536
00:59:36,688 --> 00:59:39,191
Maybe you guys are already naked.

537
00:59:45,864 --> 00:59:46,990
Oh, God.

538
00:59:49,534 --> 00:59:50,911
Oh, my God.

539
01:00:02,964 --> 01:00:04,049
Help me!

540
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:08,762
Help me, please! Somebody, help me! Please, help me!

541
01:00:09,387 --> 01:00:11,097
No!

542
01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:17,687
Oh, God!

543
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:20,106
Help me!
Please, help me!

544
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,734
Help me!

545
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,833
Mike.

546
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,669
Tina!

547
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:50,473
Tina!

548
01:00:57,816 --> 01:00:59,568
Leave her alone!

549
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:01,153
Help!

550
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:03,530
What do you want?!

551
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:10,537
Leave her!

552
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:14,875
No.
- Here.

553
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:16,751
Here!

554
01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:23,675
Billy!

555
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:27,596
No!

556
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:32,559
Billy, no!

557
01:01:34,352 --> 01:01:35,437
Please!

558
01:01:35,562 --> 01:01:36,855
Help!

559
01:01:36,938 --> 01:01:37,939
Please!

560
01:01:42,194 --> 01:01:43,403
Please!

561
01:01:45,155 --> 01:01:46,323
Help!

562
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:49,493
Help!

563
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:55,540
No!

564
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:56,875
Please!

565
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,377
Stay here, Billy. I'll be back.

566
01:01:59,378 --> 01:02:01,047
Leave her alone!

567
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,466
Oh, my God!

568
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:07,887
Jamie!

569
01:02:10,765 --> 01:02:13,976
Help me!
- Leave her alone!

570
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,269
Stop!

571
01:02:16,772 --> 01:02:17,731
Stop! Jamie!

572
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,071
Tina!

573
01:03:05,197 --> 01:03:06,448
Baby.

574
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,908
Tina!

575
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,785
Tina!

576
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:41,319
No!

577
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:42,820
Oh, God!

578
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:44,864
No!

579
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:51,621
No!

580
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:03,174
No!

581
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,635
Jamie!

582
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:09,138
Run!

583
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:14,519
No!

584
01:04:17,647 --> 01:04:19,899
No! No!

585
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:24,570
Come on!
- No! Tina!

586
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:27,949
No!
- Run!

587
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:29,700
Tina!

588
01:04:32,537 --> 01:04:33,746
Tina!

589
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:35,498
Come on.

590
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:39,627
No...

591
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:41,921
Tina!

592
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:44,382
Tina!

593
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,426
Tina!

594
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,313
Tin - Tina!

595
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:02,402
All right, spread out and keep in contact!

596
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:06,114
Don't shoot!
- There's two of 'em right here!

597
01:05:06,197 --> 01:05:08,199
Loomis!
- Yeah, I've got them here.

598
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:09,951
Come on. Get 'em out of here!

599
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,371
Spread out. Find the other girl!
- Where's the other one?

600
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,081
Come on, Loomis!
- Get these back here!

601
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:17,709
Tina's still missing!
- The other girl's still missing!

602
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:19,878
All right, come on ...
- Watch yourself!

603
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:23,423
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
- Jamie ...

604
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:25,383
It's gonna be all right.
- Help Tina, please!

605
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:33,892
Tina!

606
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:38,271
Tina! Tina!

607
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:47,157
All right. Put three units over at the reservoir ...,
and let me know when ...
- Now are you willing to help me?

608
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,742
<i>I wanna keep an eye on that ...</i>

609
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,535
Can you kill him?

610
01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:53,163
I think so.

611
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:56,249
Now wait a minute, Loomis. There isn't a minute to wait.

612
01:05:59,336 --> 01:06:01,171
What do you want me to do?

613
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:22,612
Michael.

614
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:27,075
It will destroy you too.

615
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:29,953
One day,

616
01:06:30,745 --> 01:06:32,080
Michael ...

617
01:06:33,248 --> 01:06:35,542
this rage ...

618
01:06:36,835 --> 01:06:38,878
which drives you.

619
01:06:39,754 --> 01:06:42,924
You think if you kill them all, it will go away?

620
01:06:44,592 --> 01:06:45,844
It won't.

621
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,347
You have to fight it ...

622
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:52,142
in the place where it's strongest.

623
01:06:54,894 --> 01:06:57,105
Where it all began!

624
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:03,153
-if you want to get rid of this ... rage.

625
01:07:05,738 --> 01:07:07,866
Michael, go home.

626
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,742
Go home!

627
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:13,204
Go to your house.

628
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:16,082
I shall be there waiting for you!

629
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,626
You'll find ...

630
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,128
her ...

631
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,589
waiting for you.

632
01:07:58,002 --> 01:07:59,420
Can he see us from the street?

633
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:01,547
Not a chance.

634
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,722
Station one, are you sure he can't see you?

635
01:08:12,892 --> 01:08:16,604
<i>Inside units, I want a report every five minutes.
- Roger.</i>

636
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,481
10 - 4.

637
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:22,151
He may not be able to see you, Sheriff ...

638
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:26,447
But we can all certainly hear you.

639
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:29,367
All right, relax, Loomis. This is my operation.

640
01:08:29,992 --> 01:08:32,578
All right, fellas. Let's keep it down on the radio chatter.

641
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:38,086
Looks like you and me are the only ones
around here keeping our cool.

642
01:08:39,504 --> 01:08:40,797
Good idea.

643
01:08:41,214 --> 01:08:43,299
You wanna practice our signals?

644
01:08:43,967 --> 01:08:44,801
All right.

645
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:52,978
You do that good and loud,
I'll be out here ...

646
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,396
in a flash.

647
01:08:59,025 --> 01:09:00,944
You're one brave little girl.

648
01:09:13,665 --> 01:09:15,208
Bi - Billy?

649
01:09:17,919 --> 01:09:19,254
Billy!

650
01:09:22,465 --> 01:09:23,675
Billy!

651
01:09:27,053 --> 01:09:28,263
Dr. Loomis!

652
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,143
Bi - Billy.
- Dr. Loomis!

653
01:09:33,643 --> 01:09:34,853
Billy!

654
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:37,939
Meeker, he's at the clinic.

655
01:09:38,398 --> 01:09:39,524
Bi - Billy.

656
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:42,569
This is car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

657
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:45,113
Car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

658
01:09:45,739 --> 01:09:47,866
We just had a distress call from the clinic.

659
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:49,367
They haven't been able to reach them again.

660
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:51,036
There were four men up there.

661
01:09:52,412 --> 01:09:54,080
All right. This is Sheriff Meeker.

662
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:55,999
All mobile units ...

663
01:09:56,082 --> 01:09:58,251
proceed immediately to the Masterson Clinic.

664
01:09:58,335 --> 01:09:59,336
Okay, let's go!

665
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:01,796
Move out! Move out!

666
01:10:06,676 --> 01:10:07,802
Come on. Get going.

667
01:10:07,928 --> 01:10:10,055
Stop dragging your ass!
Move, move, move!

668
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:15,435
All right. You stay here.
Loomis, I'm moving the girl to the police station.
She'll be safer there.

669
01:10:16,394 --> 01:10:17,479
Understood.

670
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:18,647
Move it out!

671
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:23,026
Let's go! - We're all clear.
- The girl, Charlie and Loomis are in this there.
- All right. I got it.

672
01:10:23,693 --> 01:10:24,694
Come on! Let's get out of here.

673
01:10:50,097 --> 01:10:51,890
Now you'll come.

674
01:10:52,599 --> 01:10:54,309
Won't you, Michael?

675
01:10:58,814 --> 01:11:00,774
I'd say you've done your night's work.

676
01:11:01,316 --> 01:11:04,027
Come on. My pal Eddie and I'll
give you a ride to the station.

677
01:11:04,987 --> 01:11:05,821
Let's go.

678
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,285
Dr. Loomis.

679
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:19,126
What the hell are you doing?

680
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:21,795
We aren't taking her ... anywhere.

681
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:25,257
You've got five seconds to give me that key ...

682
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:26,675
before I take it.

683
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,887
<i>Charlie.
Can you read me?</i>

684
01:11:30,345 --> 01:11:32,181
This is Charlie. What's going on?

685
01:11:33,015 --> 01:11:34,600
There's a car approaching.

686
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:35,893
<i>I'll check it out.</i>

687
01:11:39,688 --> 01:11:42,041
Looks like one of ours.
It's a code two.

688
01:11:42,109 --> 01:11:43,444
Eddie, do you read me?

689
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,910
Eddie, can you read me?

690
01:12:02,338 --> 01:12:03,547
Eddie, come in!

691
01:12:04,468 --> 01:12:05,385
Christ!

692
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:07,304
I've got to call Meeker.

693
01:12:08,848 --> 01:12:11,100
You crazy son of a bitch!

694
01:12:11,644 --> 01:12:12,770
Charlie.

695
01:12:14,647 --> 01:12:16,357
Charlie ...

696
01:12:16,482 --> 01:12:18,400
Michael Myers ...

697
01:12:18,692 --> 01:12:20,820
is outside.

698
01:12:22,655 --> 01:12:24,657
Stay with the little girl.

699
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:26,992
Please?

700
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,881
This is all right.

701
01:12:42,299 --> 01:12:43,884
Don't worry about this.

702
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:06,367
We have to get out of here.

703
01:13:24,385 --> 01:13:25,261
You ...

704
01:13:26,095 --> 01:13:28,389
You've come back to us, Michael?

705
01:13:49,913 --> 01:13:50,955
I ...

706
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,960
I know why you've come back, Michael.

707
01:13:57,629 --> 01:13:59,714
Because the little girl ...

708
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:05,011
The little girl can stop the rage inside.

709
01:14:06,221 --> 01:14:08,723
She knows how to do it, Michael.

710
01:14:08,932 --> 01:14:10,350
If you let her.

711
01:14:10,433 --> 01:14:11,851
She can s ...

712
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:14,187
stop the rage ...

713
01:14:14,938 --> 01:14:17,023
The rage inside.

714
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:20,401
Oh, she's not up there, Michael.

715
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:24,531
She's down here in the middle of the old house where ...

716
01:14:29,118 --> 01:14:31,496
Your house ... Michael.

717
01:14:32,705 --> 01:14:34,040
Your house.

718
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:36,293
Don't you remember ...

719
01:14:36,669 --> 01:14:38,337
how much better ...

720
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,256
you used to be?

721
01:14:40,298 --> 01:14:42,259
Let ... let me take you ...

722
01:14:43,135 --> 01:14:45,095
Let me take you to her.

723
01:14:45,929 --> 01:14:48,306
She'll take the rage away.

724
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:49,474
Michael ...

725
01:14:49,558 --> 01:14:50,559
you'll be ...

726
01:14:52,644 --> 01:14:54,187
better ... then.

727
01:14:55,188 --> 01:14:56,606
You don't need the ...

728
01:15:01,611 --> 01:15:02,946
You don't need that.

729
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:15,917
Hurry!

730
01:15:16,334 --> 01:15:17,460
Please!

731
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:25,218
Hurry!

732
01:15:30,474 --> 01:15:31,475
Please ...

733
01:15:46,156 --> 01:15:47,824
All right. Get on that side over there.

734
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:48,909
Step over it.

735
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:50,496
All right.

736
01:15:51,622 --> 01:15:52,956
I need you on my back.

737
01:15:53,373 --> 01:15:54,541
You just hold on.

738
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:00,964
All right.

739
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,235
All right.

740
01:16:23,153 --> 01:16:24,196
Come on.

741
01:16:48,512 --> 01:16:49,388
Come on, kids.

742
01:16:49,763 --> 01:16:50,722
No!, this side.

743
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,307
Yes, sir.
- Inside. There!

744
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:54,893
Hold it.

745
01:16:55,019 --> 01:16:57,021
Oh, God. Damn it!

746
01:16:57,689 --> 01:16:58,523
Move it. Quickly!

747
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:01,568
All right. When everybody's out.
I want a sweep of the building and grounds.

748
01:17:01,609 --> 01:17:04,612
<i>Sheriff Meeker, do you copy?
- Yeah! - Third floor's secure. Willie's on the second</i>

749
01:17:04,737 --> 01:17:05,905
All right, keep it up.

750
01:18:04,797 --> 01:18:06,424
Please don't let him get me.

751
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:07,842
Please, God.

752
01:18:29,155 --> 01:18:30,198
No ...

753
01:22:16,273 --> 01:22:17,483
Max!

754
01:22:22,196 --> 01:22:23,948
No!

755
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:26,325
Rachel!

756
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,910
No!

757
01:22:36,293 --> 01:22:37,086
Rachel?

758
01:22:39,839 --> 01:22:40,548
Help me. Help me.

759
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:16,585
Uncle?

760
01:23:19,212 --> 01:23:20,547
Boogeyman?

761
01:23:30,351 --> 01:23:31,561
Let me see.

762
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:57,629
You're just like me.

763
01:24:08,014 --> 01:24:08,890
Let me.

764
01:24:29,828 --> 01:24:30,995
Oh, God!

765
01:24:33,082 --> 01:24:34,917
You want her?

766
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:37,253
No!
- Here she is!

767
01:24:38,796 --> 01:24:40,339
She's yours!

768
01:24:40,923 --> 01:24:44,009
No!
- Your ... little girl! - No!

769
01:24:44,093 --> 01:24:45,427
Oh, no!

770
01:24:47,513 --> 01:24:50,099
No! No!
- Come and get her.

771
01:24:50,516 --> 01:24:51,600
Please!

772
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:53,102
Come and ...
- No!

773
01:24:55,312 --> 01:24:58,691
No! Please!
- Come and get your little girl. - No!

774
01:24:59,441 --> 01:25:04,572
No!
- Come take us both. - No!

775
01:25:05,573 --> 01:25:06,407
No!

776
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:07,575
Michael ...

777
01:25:08,285 --> 01:25:10,120
Let's play a game.
- No.

778
01:25:10,245 --> 01:25:13,415
Can you catch the little girl? Come catch.

779
01:25:13,498 --> 01:25:14,249
No!

780
01:25:14,332 --> 01:25:15,333
Michael.
- No.

781
01:25:17,169 --> 01:25:21,298
No!
- Get the little girl, then ... then you're home and safe.

782
01:26:07,552 --> 01:26:09,596
Die! Die!

783
01:26:09,763 --> 01:26:13,016
Die! Die, Michael!

784
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:16,645
Die!

785
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:22,484
Die! Die!

786
01:26:24,778 --> 01:26:25,403
D ...

787
01:27:01,946 --> 01:27:05,658
National Guard will take him
to a maximum security facility.

788
01:27:06,117 --> 01:27:08,452
Where he'll stay till the day he dies.

789
01:27:09,871 --> 01:27:11,372
He'll never die.

790
01:27:12,456 --> 01:27:14,167
All right. Take her back to the clinic.

791
01:27:14,834 --> 01:27:15,585
Come on.

792
01:27:27,138 --> 01:27:28,723
Ok, Tony I'll see you in the morning, huh?

793
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:29,682
Good job.
- All right. Take care. Joe's back.

794
01:27:33,811 --> 01:27:34,562
Hey Joe!

795
01:27:36,355 --> 01:27:37,148
Yeah.

796
01:27:37,773 --> 01:27:40,151
Don't forget. You said you'd cover for me tomorrow.

797
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:42,111
Yeah, I got it. Don't worry about it.

798
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,488
Take it easy.

799
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:46,032
Hey, you said you're gonna cover for me too!
- Get out of here.

800
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:11,727
Spread out!

801
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:15,147
Wait in the car.

802
01:29:51,372 --> 01:29:53,249
No.

803
01:29:54,501 --> 01:29:55,793
No!
