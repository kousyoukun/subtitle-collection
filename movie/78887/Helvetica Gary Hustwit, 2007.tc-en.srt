00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,210
Type is saying things to us all the time.
字體永遠在對我們訴說著什麼

2
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,838
Typefaces express a mood,an atmosphere,
字體總是在傳達某種情緒和氛圍

3
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,784
they give words a certain coloring.
賦予詞語某種“色彩”

4
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,020
Everywhere you look, you see typefaces.
無論你朝哪里看，你總是能看到各種字體


5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,216
But there's probably one you see more than any other one, and that's Helvetica.
但其中有一種可能是你見的最多的，那就是 Helvetica


6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,729
You know, there it is, and it just seems to come from nowhere.
它們存在著，仿佛原本就是環境的一部分

7
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,857
lt seems like air, it seems like gravity.
它們就好像是空氣，或是重力

8
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,297
lt's hard to evaluate it,
很難恰當地評價它

9
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,700
it's like being asked what you think about off-white paint,
就好像有人問你該如何評價乳白色的牆漆

10
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,931
it's just, there.
它就是那樣的...存在著

11
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:24,238
lt's hard to get your head around something that big.
你很難逃避或漠視它的存在，因為它是如此的巨大

12
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,707
Most people who use Helvetica use it because it's ubiquitous.
大部分人使用Helvetica 是因為它的無所不在

13
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,716
lt's like going to McDonalds instead of thinking about food.
就好像我們由於饑不擇食，只好去麥當勞吃東西

14
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,411
Because it's there, it's on every street corner.
因為它就在那裏，街頭巷尾到處都有

15
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,148
So let's eat crap, because it's on the corner.
所以我們就吃垃圾吧！因為街角就有

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,417
For me, Helvetica's just this beautiful, timeless thing.
對我來說，Helvetica就是這樣一個美好的、永恆的東西

17
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,960
And certain things shouldn't be messed with, you know?
這樣美好的東西是應該好好去珍惜的，對不對？

18
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,801
Graphic design is the communication framework,
平面設計是資訊溝通的“框架”

19
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,636
through which these messages, about what the world is now
它承載著各樣的資訊，諸如這個世界的現狀

20
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,903
and what we should aspire to,
我們對未來的嚮往

21
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,945
it's the way they reach us.
資訊就是通過這樣的方式傳達給我們

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,416
The designer has an enormous responsibility,
所以設計師們擔負著極其重大的責任

23
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,545
those are the people putting their wires into our heads.
他們是那些將線路接入我們大腦的人


24
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,585
Now should l talk? Should l not talk?
現在我應該說嗎？不應該說嗎？

25
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,718
You want me to say something?
你希望我說點什麼嗎？

26
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,089
Say something, say nothing?
說嗎，不說嗎？

27
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,431
The life of a designer is a life of fight:
設計師的生活是戰鬥的生活

28
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,990
fight against the ugliness.
對抗醜陋的戰鬥

29
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,801
Just like a doctor fights against disease.
就好像醫生對抗疾病一樣

30
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,500
For us, the visual disease is what we have around,
對我們而言，我們的周邊漫布著這種視覺的“疾病”

31
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,545
and what we try to do is to cure it somehow, with design.
我們所竭力要做的，就是通過設計，來治癒這種“疾病”

32
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:17,550
A good typographer always has sensitivity about the distance between the  letters.
一個好的字體排印設計師，對字母之間的距離永遠有著高度的敏感


33
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,458
We think typography is black and white.
我們以為排印設計就是黑色加白色

34
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:23,654
Typography is really white, it's not even black.
而排印實際上是白的，而不是黑的


35
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,621
lt is the space between the blacks that really makes it.
因為字體是由黑色形體之間的空間來定義的


36
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,234
ln a sense it's like music,
這有點象音樂

37
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,704
it's not the notes, it's the space you put between the notes that makes the music.
音樂不是由音符，而是由音符之間的空間來定義的

38
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:39,068
For instance, we designed the corporate identity for American Airlines.
舉個例子，我們曾經為美國航空設計過CI


39
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,113
This was done in 1966,
那是在1966年完成的

40
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,241
and the novelty at the time was the fact of making one word instead of two
我們進行了一個在當時來說比較新奇的設計，把兩個單詞合成一個

41
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,582
American Airlines by making AmericanAirlines all one word,
我們把American 和 Airlines 連接成一個單詞 AmericanAirlines（美國航空）

42
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,617
half red and half blue, just separated by the color.
一半紅色，一半藍色，僅僅用顏色來區分

43
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,824
What could me more American than red and blue? You know, so it's perfect.
還有比紅色加藍色更美國的嗎？所以，它很完美

44
00:04:56,063 --> 00:05:00,062
lt's the only airline in the last forty years that has
這是唯一的一家航空公司

45
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,930
not changed their identity.
50年來從未更改過它的視覺識別

46
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,461
All the airlines coming and going and changing... 
American Airlines is still the same. There's no need to change,
所有的航空公司都在不停的變更他們的CI。
只有美國航空屹然不動。他們根本不需要修改

47
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,442
and how can they improve it?
他們還能怎麼改進？

48
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:13,879
They got the best already: American Airlines in Helvetica.
他們已經是最好的了：使用Helvetica的"美國航空"

49
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,085
We always had a tendency to use very few typefaces.
我們總是傾向於使用極少數的幾種字體

50
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,119
lt's not that we don't believe in type.
不是我們不信任字體

51
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,853
We believe there are not that many good typefaces.
而是我們認為好的字體實在不是很多

52
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,761
lf l want to be really generous there's a dozen,
如果我說的大方一點，那大概會有一打

53
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,956
basically l use no more than three.
但基本上我使用的不會超過3種

54
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:38,731
There are people that think that type should be expressive.
有人認為，字體應該富於表現力

55
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,033
They have a different point of view than mine.
那是他們的看法，我不這麼看

56
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,172
l don't think type should be expressive at all.
我認為字體根本就不應該有表現力

57
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,338
l can write the word 'dog' with any typeface
我可以用任何字體來寫這個“狗”字

58
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,507
and it doesn't have to look like a dog.
這個字並不需要看起來象一隻狗

59
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,643
But there are people that think when they write 'dog' it should bark!
但就有人認為他們寫的那個“狗”就應該汪汪叫（笑）!

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,421
What Helvetica is: it's a typeface that was generated
Helvetica 到底是什麼？ 它是這樣的一款字體:

61
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:05,486
by a desire of having better legibility.
它的誕生是為了滿足人們對易讀性的更高期盼

62
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,903
lt is a modern type. lt is a very clear type.
它是一種現代字體，一種非常清晰的字體

63
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,296
lt's good for everything, pretty much.
它可以很好地應用於幾乎一切場合

64
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,534
You can say l love you in Helvetica.
你可以用Helvetica說“我愛你”

65
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,842
And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy.
你可以用 Helvetica 的極細體：如果你希望使你的設計非常的精緻

66
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,873
Or you can say it in Extra Bold if it's really 
intensive and passionate,
或者你可以用 Helvetica 的超黑體：如果你希望表現強烈或熱情的感覺

67
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:26,917
and it might work.
非常有效

68
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,055
You can also say l hate you.
你還可以說"我恨你"

69
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:37,188
l can write . . . l certainly can write a few letters in Helvetica saying that . . .
我可以寫...我當然還可以用 Helvetica 寫幾個字母，比如說..

70
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:44,835
to Washington D.C. in particular, if l can put it that way.
"我恨你，華盛頓！"（笑），如果我可以這麼說的話

71
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,701
When Helvetica came about, we were all ready for it.
Helvetica 的出現，是我們期待已久的

72
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,268
lt just had all the right connotations we were looking for,
它總是能正確的表達我們所期望表達的含義

73
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,008
for anything that had to spell out loud and clear: modern.
適用于一切必須明確傳達的現代資訊


74
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,752
The 1950s is an interesting period in the development of graphic design.
50年代在平面設計的發展歷程中是一個有趣的時期

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,195
ln that postwar period,
那是在戰後

76
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,699
after the horror and the cataclysm of the Second World War,
在二次世界大戰的恐怖和巨變之後

77
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,466
there's a real feeling of idealism among some designers, many perhaps,
一種理想主義的情感，在一些（也可能是很多）設計師當中產生

78
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,733
across the world, certainly in Europe,
然後蔓延至全世界，尤其是在歐洲

79
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:26,245
that design is part of that need to rebuild,to reconstruct,
他們認為設計本身也是需要重建和復興的一部分

80
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:31,045
to make things more open,
讓世界更開放

81
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,177
make them run more smoothly, be more democratic.
運行更平穩，更民主

82
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,383
There was this real sense of social responsibility among designers.
設計師們有著強烈的社會責任感

83
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:44,931
And this is the period when the early 
experiments of the high Modernist period
這一時期，也是極端現代主義者的早期試驗

84
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,891
start to be broken down, rationalized, codified,
開始解體、理性化、條理化的時期

85
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,202
you get the emergence of this so-called international typographic style
我們迎來了所謂“國際平面設計風格”

86
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,071
or Swiss style.
或者說“瑞士風格”

87
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:02,843
And it's Swiss designers in the 1950s who are really driving that along.
而50年代瑞士設計師們的推波助瀾，更是將這種風潮推向極致

88
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,006
This is where Helvetica comes in.
這就是 Helvetica 產生的時代背景

89
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,382
Helvetica emerges in that period, in 1957,
它就誕生於那一時期，1957年

90
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,854
where there's felt to be a need for rational typefaces
時代呼喚一種理性的字體

91
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,893
which can be applied to all kinds of contemporary information,
它應當適用于各種現代的資訊

92
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,728
whether it's sign systems or corporate identity
不管是用於標識系統，或是企業識別

93
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,035
and present those visual expressions of the modern world to the public
將當代世界的視覺手法呈現於公眾

94
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,801
in an intelligible, legible way.
以一種清晰、明瞭的方式

95
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,601
So, it's underpinned, is what l'm saying
所以，我要說的是，在它背後支撐著的

96
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,336
by this great feeling shared by many designers of idealism.
是眾多理想主義的設計師們所共有的這種偉大的情感


97
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,156
l'm a Modernist, you know.
我是個現代主義者，你知道的

98
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,892
l was trained in that period,
我就是在那個時代培養出來的

99
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,763
l lived in that period. l love Modernism.
我生活在那個時代，我愛現代主義

100
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,202
l go next week to London to see the exhibition of Modernism.
下一周我就要去倫敦，參觀那裏的現代主義展

101
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,740
l want it, you know.
我需要它，你知道

102
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,133
And well, that's my life.
噢，那是我的生命

103
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:44,410
l'm surrounded with furniture from that period. l can't change myself any more.
我的周圍全都是那一時期的傢俱。我已經不能改變自己了

104
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,317
But if l see today designers, they use all typefaces-one day one typeface,
但看看今天的設計師們，他們什麼字體都用，今天這種字體

105
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:54,189
the other day the other typeface, all in favor of a certain atmosphere,
明天那種字體，完全取決於當時的心情喜好

106
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,429
l'm not . . . l don't like that.
我就不是...我不喜歡這樣

107
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,502
l'm always interested in clarity.
我永遠傾向於清晰的風格

108
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,439
lt should be clear,
它應該是清楚的

109
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,341
it should be readable, it should be straightforward.
應該是可讀的，也應該是直截了當的

110
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,912
So l started using, gradually, grids for my design,
所以漸漸的我開始在我的設計中使用網格

111
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,415
for my catalogues for museums.
在我為博物館所做的一個目錄設計中

112
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,815
l invented a grid, and within the grid
我發明了一種網格，在這種網格中

113
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,149
l played my game.
我可以任意發揮

114
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,514
But always along the lines of the grid,
但從不會脫離格線

115
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,955
so that there is a certain order in it.
所以總是會有某種秩序在裏面

116
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,759
That's why l use grids,
這便是我使用網格的原因

117
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,429
that's why they call me ''Gridnik.''
所以有人叫我“網格怪人”

118
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,865
For me, it's a tool of creating order,
對我而言，這是一種創造秩序的工具

119
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,702
and creating order is typography.
而所謂字體排印，就是創造秩序

120
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,802
l started late with the computer.
我很晚才開始使用電腦

121
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,902
l think it was in 1993 that l bought my first computer
大約在1993年我買了我的第一台電腦

122
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,150
and l learned myself and l can handle it now quite well
然後我開始自學，到現在已經能很自如的操縱它了

123
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,516
but not like the young people.
但還是比不上年輕人

124
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,147
l am slow with it and l can do it.
我可能比較慢，但是一樣能完成

125
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,415
But l'm very much interested and
我覺得很有意思

126
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,461
l would have liked to have in the sixties the computer
我想如果在60年代我們有電腦就好了

127
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,928
because we can speed up our work, we can do it so much better,
因為這樣我們的工作就可以就可以完成得更快，完成得更好

128
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:11,035
and especially all the layers you can bring into your work.
特別是當你需要在作品中使用圖層的時候

129
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,842
We had the greatest problem in the sixties to bring two or three layers into the work.
在那個年代，在設計中使用2-3個圖層是一個極為麻煩的事情

130
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,836
You need to do it by photograph, you did all kinds of crazy techniques
你需要求助於攝影技術，用盡一切瘋狂的技巧

131
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,472
and working on a poster took us days.
做一張海報會花上我們好多天時間

132
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:31,015
And now within half an hour you have your ideas and you can make variations
而現在，不到一個半小時，你就可以有不同的創意，做出幾個備選設計

133
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,689
and make a good choice.
然後選出一個最好的

134
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,352
You can't do better design with a computer,
電腦不能幫你做出更好的設計

135
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,899
but you can speed up your work enormously.
但可以極大的提升你的工作效率

136
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,730
Shall l begin?
我可以開始了嗎？

137
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,064
l made these post stamps on the Stijl movement.
這是我設計的幾張關於荷蘭風格派運動的郵票

138
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,874
ln the beginning, if you see the sketches,
在開始的時候，你看看這些草圖

139
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:55,109
l tried to use typefaces from van Doesburg,
one of the artists of the Stijl movement.
我原本打算採用來自 Van Doesburg 的字體，
Van Doesburg 是荷蘭風格派運動的藝術家之一

140
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,384
Then l decided for the final designs
然而在最終稿中

141
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,616
not to use these typefaces because the
illustration is already from that period,
我決定放棄這些字體，因為插畫本身已經表明了它的時代

142
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:07,454
and l used the most neutral typeface-Helvetica.
最後我用了最中性的一款字體——Helvetica

143
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:13,729
Helvetica was a real step from the nineteenth-century typefaces.
相對於19世紀的那些字體，Helvetica 是一個非常重要的突破

144
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,324
lt was a little more machined,
稍微有一點機械的味道

145
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,739
it was doing away with these manual details in it,
沒有太多人工的痕跡

146
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:30,074
and we were impressed by that, because it was more neutral.
它給我們留下很深的印象，因為它更為“中性”

147
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,274
And neutralism was a word that we loved.
而中立主義，是我們喜愛的一個字眼

148
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,615
lt should be neutral;
它就應該是中立的

149
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,154
it shouldn't have a meaning in itself. lt should . . .
它本身不應該包含任何含義，它應該...

150
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:45,390
the meaning is in the content of the text, not in the typeface.
含義應該來自于文本的內容中，而非字體的表像

151
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,260
That's why we loved Helvetica very much.
這正是我們如此喜愛 Helvetica 的原因

152
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,748
l have to say that for a lot of my life
向人們解釋我的職業總是要費我很多的口舌

153
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:40,151
l rather dreaded the moment of having to explain to someone...
我很害怕向別人解釋我的工作

154
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,522
you know, you find yourself sitting next to some nice person on a plane
比如說，在飛機上，或是火車上，你遇到了一個很好的鄰座

155
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,582
or a train and they ask you sooner or later what you do
他們總是免不了會問及你的職業

156
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,198
and if you say type designer, they generally look completely blank.
如果你說自己是一個字體設計師，通常他們的表情是一臉茫然

157
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,968
Occasionally, someone will actually know the term
不過偶爾的，會有人能真正理解這個術語

158
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,061
but then will say, ''l thought they were all dead.''
但接著他們會說：“我以為他們都過世了。”

159
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:04,135
Since l did some work for Microsoft in the mid-nineties on screen fonts,
從90年代中期開始，我為微軟開發螢幕字體

160
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,473
particularly Verdana and Georgia,
主要是 Verdana 和 Georgia

161
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,373
l've had quite comical encounters with people who will say,
我有過好幾次很搞笑的偶遇，他們會說

162
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,914
''Oh, you work with fonts.
“噢，你是做字體工作的

163
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,554
We just got this memo round the office
saying we've all got to start using something called Verdana.
我們的辦公室到處都是那種備忘便簽，
提醒我們準備要使用一種叫做 Verdana 的東西

164
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,553
Have you ever heard of it?''
你聽說過這種東西嗎？”

165
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:25,754
Funny conversations that never would have happened to me
thirty, forty years ago.
而在三、四十年前，我就不會遇到這樣搞笑的談話

167
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:32,401
My dad was a typographer, and although he didn't push me to follow in his footsteps
我的父親是一個排版設計師，不過他並沒有逼著我子承父業

168
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:39,867
when l left school, high school in the UK, l 
had a year to fill before going to university
那時我高中畢業，在去讀大學之前我有一年的空閒

169
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,282
and l got sent as a trainee, an unpaid trainee, intern,
於是這段時間我作為一個沒有薪水的實習生

170
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,217
to a type foundry in the Netherlands,
去荷蘭一家造字廠實習

171
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,922
where l spent a year learning what turned
out to be a completely obsolete trade
在那裏，我花了整整一年的時間，
去學習一種後來證明完全被廢棄的手藝：

172
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,057
of making type by hand.
手工造字

173
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:57,085
lt was a matter of cutting letters in steel, engraving them at actual size.
每天做的就是切割鋼鐵的字模，按實際尺寸雕刻

174
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:03,265
You know, l doubt if l ever got up quite to one letter a day at that time.
我懷疑，我那時即便竭盡全力也無法在一天內完成一個字母

175
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,773
So, you know, l could say that really l've made type by practically all the means
所以我可以說，我已經親身經歷了所有的造字方式

176
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,539
it's ever been made in the fifty, fifty-one years that l've been working.
——在我幹這一行的50、51年裏所有的造字方式

177
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,075
lt's hard to generalize about the way type designers work.
很難用一兩句話說明字體設計師的工作方式

178
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,883
There isn't a generality of us.
我們的工作方法不盡相同

179
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:22,087
But l think that most type designers if they were sitting in this chair
但是我想從事這一行的大多數字體設計師

180
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,386
would essentially start in much the same way.
大體上來說都是這樣開始的

181
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,394
l'd probably start with a lowercase h.
我通常會從一個小寫的 h 開始

182
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,164
it tells me, first of all, whether this is a sans serif or a serif typeface.
它會告訴我們一些資訊，首先，這是一個“襯線”還是“無襯線”字體

183
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,534
lf it were a serif face it would look like this
如果是一個“襯線字體”，它應該是這樣的

184
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,003
here are the serifs so called, these little feet
這就是所謂的“襯線”，這些小小的“腳”

185
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,370
on the bottom and top of the principal strokes of the letter.
在字母主幹筆劃的底部和頂部

186
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,871
Are they heavy, are they light, what is the nature of the serif,
它是粗體嗎，還是一個細體，這種襯線體有什麼特性

187
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,380
is there a lot of thick-thin contrast in the letter form;
在外形上是否有著粗細的對比

188
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:55,788
what are the proportions of the overall height, the ascender, so-called of the h,
總體的高度比例如何，h 的“上升部”占多少

189
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,813
and the x-height part of it,
它的“ x-高度”占多少

190
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,993
Then because an h is a straight-sided letter,
然後由於 h 是一個直線邊的字母

191
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,485
l would then do a round letter like an o along side it.
我會做一個圓形的字母，比如說一個 o，放在它旁邊

192
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:12,101
l can get a sense of how the weight of the curved part of the o 
relates to the straight part of the h.
我就可以直觀的比較，這個 o 的曲線部分的“重量”
是否能匹配這個 h 的直線部分

193
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:17,473
And already there is a huge amount of DNA is just a couple of letterforms like that.
僅僅是這樣簡單的一對字母，就攜帶著大量決定這套字體外形的“基因”

194
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,839
l'd then probably do something like a lowercase p
然後我可能會做一個小寫的 p

195
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,343
because it's half straight and half round;
因為它一半是直邊，一半是圓形的

196
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,448
and also it has a descending stroke,
同時，它還有一個“下降筆劃”

197
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,587
which is another vertical dimension that l
would be interested in establishing.
這是我想要確立的另外一個“垂直維度”

198
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,389
Then l would then build on that.
然後我就以此為依據，接著往下做

199
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,391
lf you've got an h you've got an awful lot of information
如果你有了一個 h，你就已經擁有了極其豐富的資訊

200
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,188
about m, n, and u in the lower case.
足以建立這些小寫的 m、n、和 u 

201
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,528
lf you've got a p you've got q and b and d and so on.
如果你有了一個 p，就等於有了一個 q 和 b 還有 d，等等，依此類推


202
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,468
And then just as soon as possible l would get them into words
然後，我會儘早的把它們匹配成單詞

203
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,436
or something that looked like words
或是讓它們看起來象單詞

204
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:51,032
because for me the experience of reading
something is so critical in judging it as a typeface
因為如果要評判一款字體，它的閱讀體驗是至關重要的

205
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:56,045
because l find that is the acid test of how a typeface performs.
我認為這是評價一款字體性能表現的“酸性測試”

206
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,558
One of the most characteristic and to my
mind beautiful things about Helvetica
就我而言，Helvetica 最迷人的特質之一

207
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,257
is these horizontal terminals, you see in the lower case a and c and e and g.
就是它水準的收尾，你可以在小寫的 a、c、e 和 g 中看到

208
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,629
The whole structure is based on this horizontal slicing off of the terminals.
正是末端的這種水準切削決定了字體的整個結構走向

209
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,440
It's very hard for a designer to look at these characters and say,
一個字體設計師看到這些字元，禁不住要問自己：

210
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,676
how would l improve them? How would l make them any different?
我還能怎樣改進它們？我還能怎樣讓它們有所不同？

211
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,667
They just seem to be exactly right.
它們看上去是那樣的完美

212
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,271
l'm glad no one asked me to
我很慶倖沒人找我去...

213
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,017
second-guess Helvetica
...改進 Helvetica

214
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,485
because l wouldn't know what to do.
因為我實在不知道該怎樣做

215
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,714
This is the original type specimen of Helvetica
這是 Helvetica 最原始的樣稿

216
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,352
before it was Helvetica. lt had its original name, Die Neue Haas Grotesk.
在它成為 Helvetica 之前， 它還有一個原始名稱，Die Neue Haas Grotesk 

217
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,395
The whole story of how Helvetica came into being
Helvetica 誕生的整個故事

218
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,091
is not entirely clear, at least to me.
並不是很清晰的，至少對我而言

219
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,171
lt is said, and l think it's true,
據說，不過我確信是事實

220
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,767
that Eduard Hoffmann, who had been the boss at Haas type foundry,
Eduard Hoffmann ，Haas 鑄字廠當時的老闆

221
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:02,548
wished to make a modernized version of Akzidenz Grotesk,
他想為 Akzidenz Grotesk 這款字體做一個現代的版本

222
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,984
which was essentially a traditional nineteenth-century German sans serif,
那是一款傳統的19世紀德國無襯線字體

223
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,489
and his method of doing that was sort of to clean it up and so on.
他的想法是讓它的外形更簡煉一些...之類的

224
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,159
And it was of course Max Miedinger who made the drawings for Helvetica.
當然，最後是 Max Miedinger 動手繪製了 Helvetica 的圖樣

225
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,823
l received the impression from people l knew back in the sixties and seventies
我記得我在六、七十年代認識的一些人這麼說過

226
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:24,770
that Hoffmann's part in this was a very much more significant one
當年 Hoffmann 在其中擔負的角色其實是相當重要的

227
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,441
than you might just assume by reading in a textbook
並非象你在那些教科書中看到的那麼簡單：

228
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,807
that Max Miedinger was the designer of Helvetica.
——“Helvetica，由 Max Miedinger 設計...”

229
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:05,077
You can easily say this was a joint product
我們其實可以說這個項目...

230
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,615
of both Miedinger and my father.
...是 Miedinger 和我父親共同完成的

231
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:13,574
Miedinger couldn't produce a typeface alone;
Miedinger 無法單獨完成一個字體的設計

232
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,021
neither could my father.
我父親也不行

233
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:21,516
But when both were working hard together then something good resulted.
但如果是兩個人在一起共同努力，就能夠有所成就

234
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:33,537
Here are the first trials of Neue Haas Grotesk,
這就是當年的第一個測試版本：Neue Haas Grotesk

235
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,302
which was the first name of Helvetica.
這才是 Helvetica 的原名

236
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,881
l knew the way things worked at Haas
我熟悉Haas 鑄字廠的工作流程

237
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,341
and l had gradually picked up on the importance of Eduard Hoffman,
所以我逐漸發現了 Eduard Hoffmann 在其中發揮的重要作用

238
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,153
and his almost pathological shyness
由於他那種幾乎是病態的羞怯

239
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:58,821
and the way that he would use other people's hands.
他喜歡借助他人之手來進行工作

240
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,863
But boy could you see his mind at work on the faces
但上帝，你仍然能從這些字體工作中看出

241
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,229 
where he was deeply involved.
這裏面浸透著他的心血

242
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,473
You have here a note by Eduard Hoffmann
這是他當年的一張便條

243
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,979
indicating all the desired corrections.
顯示的都是他的修改建議

244
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,082
''The capital Y is too slim.
“大寫 Y 太過纖細”

245
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,779
The capital A is also too slim.''
“大寫 A 也是過細”


246
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:29,127
When you talk about the design of Haas Neue Grotesk or Helvetica,
當我們談論 Haas Neue Grotesk 或者說 Helvetica 的設計的時候

247
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:36,768
what it's all about is the interrelationship of the negative shape
我們實際上談論的是它們與其“負形”之間的相互關係

248
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,137
the figure-ground relationship,
實體與空間之間的關係

249
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,732
the shapes between characters and within characters,
字體內部，以及字體之間的空間形態

250
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,369
with the black if you like, with the inked surface.
以及黑色部分，如果你喜歡這樣稱呼的話；和過墨的部分

251
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,948
And the Swiss pay more attention to the background,
而瑞士人更關注於字體的負形

252
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:56,012
so that the counters and the space
between characters just hold the letters.
所以字穀與字形間的空間就把整個字母固定住了

253
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,857
l mean you can't imagine anything moving;
你看不出絲毫的“鬆動”

254
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,293
it is so firm.
它就是如此的“結實”

255
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,229
lt's not a letter that's bent to shape;
這不是一套彎曲成形的字體

256
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:11,101
it's a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of surrounding space.
每一個字母實際上是存在於一個強有力的矩陣所包圍著的空間

257
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,330
lt's . . . oh it's brilliant when it's done well.
這實在是... 太出色了，當所有的一切完成之後

258
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,578
My father had clear ideas
我父親對於這個字體應該呈現怎樣的面貌

259
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,147
how the typeface should look.
有著很清晰的想法

260
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:28,017
So my father and Miedinger sat together,
and he started drawing.
所以我父親和 Miedinger 坐在一起，然後他開始繪圖

261
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,385
Here you have a proof of an alphabet
這裏有一份字體的小樣

262
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,983
with observations by Max Miedinger.
根據 Max Miedinger 的陳述

263
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,464
When Miedinger worked for Haas he did
not work as a designer.
當 Miedinger 在Haas 工作的時候，他實際的工作其實並不是一個設計師

264
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,166
He was actually a salesman.
他實際上是一個銷售員

265
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,068
His job was to travel around Switzerland
他的工作就是周遊瑞士

266
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,332
taking orders for fonts of type.
招攬字體的訂單

267
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,399
By profession he was a graphic artist,
從專業上來說，他是一個平面設計師

268
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:53,376
but he realized that he could make more
money by selling foundry type.
但是他意識到，賣字體能讓他賺更多的錢

269
00:21:54,246 --> 00:22:04,022
But my father said, lf ever l have an idea of
a new typeface, l'm sure that you could design it.
但是我父親說過，“每當我對新字體有什麼想法的時候，
我都很確信你一定可以把它設計出來。”

270
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:09,153
l have here a type specimen book
我這裏有一份字體樣冊

271
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:13,398
of both type foundries, Stempel and Haas.
是關於兩家字體公司的， Stempel 和 Haas 

272
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:20,895
You have to know that Haas was
controlled by the German type foundry Stempel.
你要知道，Haas  是受德國字體公司 Stempel 控制的

273
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:28,479
And in turn Stempel was also controlled by Linotype.
而之後 Stempel 又被 Linotype 收購

274
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,527
Now we go down to the cellar and see in
our archives where we can find Helvetica.
下面讓我們到地下室去看看能否找到什麼關於 Helvetica 的檔案

275
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,715
Here we have number 24.
我們要找的是...24號

276
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:14,382
And there it is, the Helvetica drawings.
在這裏，Helvetica 的畫稿

277
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:20,825
The marketing director at Stempel had the
idea to give it a better name
Stempel 的市場總監希望有一個更好的名字

278
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:27,595
because Neue Haas Grotesk didn't sound very good for a
因為 Neue Haas Grotesk (意為：Haas 的新怪物)

279
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:32,403
typeface that was intended to be sold in the United States.
對於一款要銷往美國的字體，這樣一個名字聽起來並不是很好

280
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:39,280
Stempel suggested the name of Helvetia.
Stempel 建議用 Helvetia 這個名字

281
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:45,016
This is very important: Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland.
這一點非常重要：Helvetia 是瑞士的拉丁語名稱

282
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,560
My father said, That's impossible.
我父親說，這不可能

283
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,625
You cannot call a typeface after the name of a country.
你不能用一個國家的名字來稱呼一個字體

284
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,461
So he said, why don't you call it Helvetica.
所以他說，你們為什麼不叫它 Helvetica（Helvetia的形容詞）？

285
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,173
So in other words this would be the Swiss typeface.
所以，換種說法，這個字體將是“瑞士的”字體

286
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,439
And they agreed.
然後他們同意了

287
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,850
l think Helvetica was a perfect name at the time.
我認為Helvetica在當時是一個完美的名字

288
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:18,748
Swiss typography at that time also was well-known worldwide.
瑞士字體排印設計在當時也是聞名於世

290
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,959
So it was the best solution for Helvetica
所以 Helvetica 是這個字體命名的最佳方案

291
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,488
to get into the market.
它順利進入市場

292
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:28,322
Once we'd introduced Helvetica, it really ran away.
Helvetica 一經推出，便勢不可擋

293
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:33,862
lt was exactly what the designers were looking for.
它無疑是當時的設計師們期盼已久的

294
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,309
l mean, l don't think there's been such a hot thing since
我的意思是，它的成功是空前絕後的

295
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:43,270
as the figure-ground relationship properly executed
由於字體的正負形關係得到了良好的處理

296
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:49,154
and it was. . . oh, just a landslide waiting to 
go down the mountain.
它就好像...哦，一次即將爆發的山體滑坡

297
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,452
And away it went.
一發而不可收

298
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,085
l imagine there was a time when it just felt so good
我可以想像，當時這個字體給人的感覺真是太美妙了

299
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:25,853
to take something that was old and dusty
and homemade and crappy looking
將那些陳舊、邋遢、粗糙、醜陋的字體

300
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,293
and replace it with Helvetica.
全部換成 Helvetica 

301
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:34,198
lt just must have felt like you were scraping
the crud off of like filthy old things
就好像你把那些髒舊東西外面的污穢剝離掉

302
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,135
and restoring them to shining beauty. And in fact
讓它們煥然一新。實際上

303
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:41,973
corporate identity in the sixties, that's what
it sort of consisted of.
六十年代的企業識別系統，大多由那些東西構成

304
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:49,812
Clients would come in and they'd have
piles of goofy old brochures from the fifties
來找你的客戶往往帶著成堆五十年代那些土氣的企宣手冊

305
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,040
that hide like shapes on them and goofy bad photographs.
上面有各種奇怪的形狀，蠢笨難看的照片

306
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,622
They'd have some letterhead that would
say Amalgamated Widget on the top
他們有一些信頭上可能寫著 "聯合制品" 

307
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,716
in some goofy, maybe a script typeface,
above Amalgamated Widget
用著某種傻氣的字體，也可能是一個手寫體。在 "聯合制品" 之上

308
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,162
it would have an engraving showing their headquarters
會有一個描繪他們在 艾奧瓦州 Paducah 總部形象的

309
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,360
in Paducah, lowa, with smokestacks belching smoke
...版畫圖案，旁邊是冒著黑煙的煙囪

310
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:13,738
you know, and then you go to a corporate
identity consultant circa 1965, 1966,
你知道，如果在1965、1966年左右，你走進一家企業形象諮詢事務所

311
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,475
and they would take that and lay it here
and say, Here's your current stationery,
他們會把那些東西攤在那裏然後說，這是你們現在的信封信箋

312
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,278
and all it implies, and this is what we're proposing.
然後，這是我們提議的方案

313
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,475
And next to that, next to the belching smokestacks and
在它旁邊，是那冒煙的煙囪

314
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,382
the nuptial script and the ivory paper,
在婚禮字體和象牙色紙張旁邊

315
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,615
they'd have a crisp bright white piece of paper
是挺括而雪亮的紙張

316
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,459
and instead of Amalgamated Widget, founded 1 857,
再沒有那些 “聯合制品, 始於 1857”

317
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:38,463
it just would say Widgco, in Helvetica Medium
僅僅用 Helvetica 標準體寫著 Widgco

318
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,932
Can you imagine how bracing and thrilling that was?
你能想像那是多麼令人振奮和激動？

319
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,735
That must have seemed like you'd crawled through a desert
就如同你剛爬出一片沙漠

320
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,538
with your mouth just caked with filthy dust
滿嘴都是骯髒的沙塵

321
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,976
and then someone is offering you a clear,
refreshing, distilled, icy glass of water
然後這時有人給你遞上一杯清澈見底的、令人精神一振的，冰鎮的純水

322
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:57,816
to clear away all this horrible, kind of like, burden of history.
讓你把所有的不快、歷史的包袱全都拋之腦後

323
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,019
lt must have been just fantastic. And you
know it must have been fantastic
那絕對是妙極了，你知道那絕對是妙極了

324
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,011
because it was done over and over and over again.
因為這樣的事會接二連三連四的發生

325
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:11,490
So this is what l'm talking about, this is Life Magazine 1 953.
這就是我前面所說的：1953年的生活雜誌

326
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:18,898
One ad after another in here, that just kind of shows every 
single visual bad habit that was endemic in those days.
一個又一個的廣告，毫無例外的重複著那一時期特有的
視覺設計上的陋習

327
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,907
You've got zany hand lettering everywhere,
到處都是小丑般的手寫美術字

328
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,240
swash typography to signify elegance,
用花體字來顯示優雅

329
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,077
exclamation points, exclamation points,
exclamation points.

330
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,817
Cursive wedding invitation typography
down here reading,
這裏用婚禮請柬的花飾字體和版式寫著

"幾乎每個人都會賞鑒至美。”

how everything looked in the Fifties.
這就是五十年代的視覺環境，那個時代的一切東西都這個模樣

333
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:43,895

full swing - same product.
我們再看看同樣的商品，這時候 Helvetica 已經開始大顯身手

334

No people, no smiling fakery,

335
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,502
just a beautiful big glass of ice-cold Coke.

Governments and corporations love Helvetica
政府和企業喜歡 Helvetica

344
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,946
because on one hand it makes them seem neutral and efficient,
因為一方面它令他們看上去中立和有效率

345
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:17,125
but also the smoothness of the letters
makes them seem almost human.
柔和的字形也讓他們看起來更人性化

346
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,256
That is a quality they all want to convey
這一直是他們試圖傳達的質素

347
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,435
because of course they have the image they are always fighting

that they are authoritarian they're bureaucratic,

you lose yourself in them, they're oppressive.

they can come off seeming more

理應具備的形象

accountable or transparent
現在他們可以不必真的親切、可靠、透明

355
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,192
but they can look that way.

clean and official and efficient.
現代人希望顯得簡潔、正式、高效

359
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:37,968
Designers, and l think even readers, invest
so much of the surroundings in the typeface.
設計師們，我想甚至是讀者們，為這款字體賦予了種種外在的含義

360
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,577
American Apparel uses Helvetica and it looks cheeky.
美國服飾 用Helvetica 顯出隨意

而美國航空 用 Helvetica 顯出穩重

362
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,719
And it's not just a matter of the weight they
use and the letter spacing and the colors.
這不僅僅因為他們所使用的字重，字距，和顏色

363
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,883
There's something about the typeface l think 
really invites this sort of open interpretation.
還因為字體本身就支援開放性的釋讀

364
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,929
l suppose you could say the typefaces are either
我認為字體可以說分為兩種類型

365
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,521
those that are fully open to interpretation
一類支持完全開放性的解讀


366
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,355
or merely have one association attached to them.
另一類卻僅僅與一種含義相關聯

367
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,738
A typeface made of icicles or candy canes
or something just says one thing.
一款由冰柱或棒棒糖之類玩意構成的字體只表達一種意思


368
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,872
And Helvetica maybe says everything.
而 Helvetica 卻可以表達一切

369
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,806
And that's perhaps part of its appeal.
或許這就是它的魅力之一

370
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,381
Typography has this real poverty of terms to describe things.
文字設計中非常缺乏可用於描述字體特性的術語

371
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,184
Beyond x height and cap height and weight and so on.
僅有的就是 x高度，字高，字重之類

372
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,519
I find when Tobias and I work on projects together
當 Tobias 和我在一起合作項目時

373
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,647
we tend to use a lot of qualitative terms that are entirely subjective.
我們喜歡用很多很主觀的辭彙來描述字體的特性

374
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:28,159
Working on the typeface for Esquire years ago, I remember us saying,
在幾年前為 《君子雜誌》 製作字體時，我記得我們曾說

375
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,765
I remember my saying, No this has that Saturn 5 rocket early NASA quality.
我記得我說，不，這是土星5號時期美國航天局的感覺

376
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:38,870
lt needs to have that orange plastic Olivetti
typewriter, Roman Holiday espresso feeling.
它應該是那種橘色塑膠的好利獲得打字機，羅馬假日濃縮咖啡的感覺

377
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,472
I know you got exactly what I was saying. -I did. -
我知道你完全理解我所說的。對

378
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:47,912
But it's that there's really no way to describe the qualitative parts
of a typeface without resorting to things are fully outside it.
如果不借助於外在的事物，我們就很難描述字體的特性

380
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:52,050
And we're constantly saying, You know,
this has that, it feels kind of Erik Satie;
我們一直在說，“你知道，這有點 Erik Satie（19世紀法國作曲家）的感覺

381
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,384
it needs to be Debussy.
它應該是德彪西那樣的感覺

382
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,716
Or this has a kind of belt and suspenders look.
或者，這看上去有點象背帶褲

383
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,689
lt needs to be, you know, much more elegant. . . hand-lasted shoe.
它應該，嗯，更優雅一點...手工做的鞋一樣的感覺

384
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,896
l've been collecting these signs for a couple of years now
我已經收集這些標牌好些年了

385
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:14,239
and one of my favorites is these signs. l have a number of these.
我最喜歡的是這些標牌，這樣的我有好多

386
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,674
This is what the street signs in New York City used to look like.
這就是紐約城街道上的標牌以前的樣子

387
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,078
This actually functions so much more clearly
它實際上看起來更清晰

388
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,105
and so much more effectively than what we
see out on the street now.
比我們現在在街上看到的要更有效

389
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,485
The sort of classical modernist line on
現代主義的“經典理論”認為

390
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,155
how aware a reader should be of a typeface
一個讀者對待字體的方式應該是：

391
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,191
is that they shouldn't be aware of it at all.
讀者根本不應該意識到字體的存在

392
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,360
lt should be this crystal goblet
它應該像一個水晶的高腳杯

393
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,964
there to just hold and display and organize
只是放置，展示和組織資訊的一個容器

394
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:46,638
the information. But I don't think it's really quite as simple as that.
但我想實際情況並沒有那麼簡單

395
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,540
I think even if they're not consciously
我想即使他們在閱讀時沒有意識到字體的存在

396
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:55,013
aware of the typeface they're reading,
they'll certainly be affected by it.
他們還是會受到字體的影響

397
00:31:55,013 --> 00:32:00,417
The same way that an actor that's miscast
in a role will affect someone's experience
就像安排不適當的演員在劇中演出會影響觀眾的觀看體驗

398
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,855
of a movie or play that they're watching.
They'll still follow the plot,
當然他們一樣能看明白電影或戲劇的情節

399
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:08,724
but, you know, be less convinced or excited or affected.
但是，你知道，他們會更難於相信、激動、或感動

400
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,963
I think that typography is similar to that,
我認為文字設計的情形與之類似

401
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:18,732
where the designer choosing typefaces is
essentially a casting director.
設計師挑選字體實質上就像是一個導演在挑選角色

402
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,174
There's very little type in my world outside of work.
在我的世界裏，很少有不能使用的字體

403
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:28,346
Like everybody else I'm aware of fonts
being used in my environment.
和其他人一樣，我發覺字體在我們周圍無處不在

404
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,349
You know, the standing joke that graphic
designers can't see historical movies
你知道，有人嘲笑說平面設計師不能看歷史題材的影片

405
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,544
because the fonts are always wrong is certainly true.
因為裏面的字體使用經常是錯誤的，這個笑話其實是真實的

406
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,486
lt definitely makes the world outside the office very different.
外面的世界和工作室內真的很不一樣

407
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:43,895
My fiancÈ and I were trying to remember the location of a restaurant
有一次，我和未婚妻想要記住我們家附近一個飯店的位置

408
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:48,764
in our neighborhood, and she remembered it as that new place
她記的是那家飯店

409
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,469
that's just a couple blocks down from the dry cleaner.
...離乾洗店有幾個街區

410
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,105
I remembered it as that new place just a couple blocks down from
而我記的是

411
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:56,471
the place with the bad letter spacing out front.
它離那個字間距很糟糕的路牌有幾個街區

412
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,678
Nobody doesn't know what Helvetica is,
沒有人不知道 Helvetica 是什麼

413
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:04,148
I mean, at the beginning of our careers
certainly before anybody had a PC or a Mac,
我的意思是，在我職業生涯開始的時候，當然那時候連 PC 或蘋果機都還沒有出現

414
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,950
no one knew what fonts were.
沒有人知道字體是什麼

415
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,441
I think even then people might have known what Helvetica was.
但我想即使在那時人們也知道什麼是 Helvetica

416
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,657
The fact that it's been so heavily licensed
它能夠獲得如此廣泛的授權

417
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,827
and made available through these very populist technologies
以一種如此平民化的技術形式面向大眾

418
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,321
has kind of furthered the mythology that it's 
the ultimate typeface in some way.
也說明了，在某種程度上它作為終極字體的神話還將延續下去

419
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,566
And even for us professionals that's hard to escape from.
即便是在我們這些專業人士圈內，也無可避免

420
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,136
I kind of find myself buying into the idea
我發現自己開始有些相信這個說法：

421
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,205
that ''Oh, the sans serif evolved for a hundred years
“哦，無襯線字體的百年演變

422
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,474
and the ultimate expression was Helvetica.''
其終極表現就是 Helvetica。”

423
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,841
And realizing, wait a minute that's not quite true, historically
然後意識到，等一下，這好像不太對，無論從歷史上

424
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,780
or aesthetically or culturally or politically.
美學上，文化上，還是政治上都說不過去

425
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,618
But there's something about it that does have the feeling of finality to it,
但是它確實給人一種“無襯線字體的最終形式”的感覺

426
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:44,655
This is the conclusion of one line of reasoning with this typeface,
這是我對這款字體理解的一個總結

427
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:49,217
and perhaps everything after it is secondary in some way.
任何在它之後的東西，在某些意義上來說可能永遠只能是第二

428
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:35,027
I'm obviously a typomaniac, which is an incurable, if not mortal, disease.
我絕對是一個字體狂熱者，一種不治之症，如果它不是致命的


429
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,469
I can't explain it I just love, I just like looking at type,
我不能解釋這些，我只是喜歡，我就是喜歡看著這些字體

430
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,801
I just get a total kick out of it. They are my friends.
我從中獲得了太多的樂趣。它們是我的朋友

431
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:45,376
Other people look at bottles of wine or whatever, or girls' bottoms,
其他人喜歡看瓶中的美酒或女孩的臀部

432
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,707
I get kicks out of looking at type.
我從看字體中享受樂趣

433
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,076
lt's a little worrying I must admit, it's a very nerdish thing to do.
是有點煩人，我必須承認，這樣子做是很書呆子氣的

434
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,078
I'm very much a word person.
我是一個非常多話的人

435
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,952
So that's why typography for me is the obvious extension.
所以字體設計對我來說很明顯是一種延伸

436
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,715
lt just makes my words visible.
它使我的話語變得可見

437
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,492
A real typeface needs rhythm, needs contrast; it comes from handwriting.
一款真正的字體需要韻律，需要對比，字體來源於於書寫

438
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,594
That's why I can read your handwriting, and you can read mine.
這就是我可以讀懂你寫的字，你可以讀懂我的的原因

439
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,863
And I'm sure our handwriting is miles away from Helvetica
我很清楚我們的書寫與 Helvetica 

440
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,899
or anything that would be considered legible.
或其他任何可以清晰辨認的字有很大的差別

441
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,501
But we can read it because there's a rhythm to it, there's a contrast to it.
我們可以讀它是因為它富有韻律，在它其中存在著對比

442
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,936
Helvetica hasn't got any of that.
上述這些東西 Helvetica 絲毫沒有

443
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,372
|Why is it fifty years later still so popular?|
（為什麼它在五十年後仍舊如此流行？）

444
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,679
I don't know. What is bad taste ubiquitous?
我不知道。為什麼糟糕的品位無處不在？

445
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,341
No, actually, Helvetica was a good typeface at the time.
不，實際上，Helvetica在當時是一款好的字體

446
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,118
lt really answered a demand.
它確實適應了當時的需求

447
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,620
But now it's become one of those defaults that,
但是現在它成為了一種默認選擇

448
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,488
partly because of the proliferation of the 
computer, which is now twenty years,
部分是因為電腦的發展，到現在已經20年了

449
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,459
the PC I mean,
我所指的是 PC

450
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,298
it was the default on the Apple Macintosh
and then it became the default on Windows
它在蘋果機上是默認字體，然後成為 Windows 系統上的

451
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,633
which copied everything that Apple did, as you know.
Windows 拷貝了蘋果機的一切，就像你所知道的那樣

452
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:46,537
lnterface and everything else, and then they did the clone version, Arial,
從介面到其他所有的一切，然後他們製作了一個克隆版本，Arial

453
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,940
which is worse than Helvetica but
比 Helvetica 還爛

454
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,677
fills the same purpose I think. Now it's probably never going to go away
但達到了同樣的目的。現在它很可能再也不會消失了

455
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:57,341
because it's ubiquitous; it's a default. lt's air,
因為它無處不在，它是默認項，它是空氣

456
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,509
you know, it's just there. There's no choice.
你知道，它已經成為現實，讓我們別無選擇

457
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,019
You have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica.
你必須要呼吸，所以你必須要使用 Helvetica

458
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,056
lt brings style with it; every typeface does.
它有自己的風格，其他字體也是如此

459
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,191
lt has a certain,
它有某種...

460
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,294
well, it's like a person, if you are slightly heavy in the middle
就像一個人，如果你腰腹比較粗

461
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,630
you're not going to walk around in tight T-shirts. You'd look like an idiot.
你就不會穿著緊身T恤到處走。你看上去會像個白癡

462
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,966
And Helvetica is heavy in the middle. So it has a certain,
Heletica 也有它的缺陷。所以它需要某種... 

463
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,535
it needs certain space around it, needs a lot of white space;
它的周圍需要留有空間，需要很多的空白

464
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,505
it needs very carefully to be looked at the weight gradations.
在磅數的選擇上需要非常的謹慎

465
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,474
lt needs a lot of space sideways also.
它的兩邊也需要許多空間

466
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,010
Then it's very legible, but
然後它就變得能清晰易讀，但是

467
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,380
very small and very tightly done and very lightly as modern designers do,
如果給它設置很小的字型大小，或是很緊湊的間距，
或者像現代設計師把它設置得極度纖細

468
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,082
it's a nightmare, a total nightmare.
那就是一場噩夢，完全是一場噩夢

469
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,845
I wouldn't say this if I hadn't tried it.
如果我沒有嘗試過，我不會這樣說

470
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,854
Because all the letters . . . it's the whole Swiss ideology;
因為它所有的字母...完全是瑞士的理念

471
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,557
the guy who designed it tried to make all the letters look the same.
設計它的人想把每個字母設計成一模一樣

472
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,694
Hello??? You know, that's called an army. That's not people.
Hello? 你知道，那叫做軍隊。那不是人的所為

473
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,730
That's people having the same fucking helmet on.
那是一群戴著一模一樣的頭盔的人

474
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,132
lt doesn't further individualism.
它不鼓勵任何的個人主義

475
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,502
And the aim with type design always is to make it individual enough
然而字體設計的目標總是把字體變得足夠的個性化

476
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,737
so that it's interesting,
這樣它才是有趣的

477
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,407
but of course ninety-five percent of any
alphabet has to look like the other alphabet
當然任何字體 95% 的部分必須和其他字體看上去一樣

478
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,897
otherwise you wouldn't be able to read it.
否則你就沒法讀懂它

479
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,583
l've never sort of woken up with a typeface coming out,
我從未睡一覺醒來然後想出一款新的字體

480
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,386
you know, like some people . . . l've got to do this, and they go to their,
你知道，像某些人那樣...”我不得不這樣做”，然後走到他們的...

481
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,082
whatever, their easel, and these amazing brush strokes.
隨便什麼，比如畫板前，畫出那些神奇的筆劃

482
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,856
I don't have that urge.
我沒有那種衝動

483
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,983
You know, I wake up and usually I want to go back to sleep.
你知道，我醒來的時候還經常想回去睡

484
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,155
I mean, everybody puts their history into their work.
我的意思是，每個人都在作品中體現自己的個人經歷

485
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,134
I certainly know that when I draw something it has
我很清楚我在畫東西的時候

486
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,470
I'm fast, I'm loud, I'm chaotic,
我很快，我很吵，我亂來一氣

487
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,909
I'm not very rule based, even though I'm German and I love rules,
我不太按規則辦事，雖然我是德國人並且我喜愛規則

488
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:37,281
I'm a Gemini, I had my birthday yesterday, so I'm all over the place essentially.
我是一個雙子座的人，昨天剛過完我的生日，
所以本質上我是一個毫無章法的人

489
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,251
I'm always on time, but a year late, you know what I mean,
我永遠守時，但那是在一年之後，你知道我的意思

490
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,520
but then I'm on the second.
但那時我就是分秒必爭了

491
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,091
So I have this horrible thing, which comes out in my typefaces.
所以在我設計的字體裏面會出現那些可怕的東西

492
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,593
They're never perfect. They always have a little edge
它們從不會是完美的。它們總有些缺陷

493
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,255
in the sense that I leave them alone when l get bored with them.
因為當我厭倦它們的時候我就把它們丟在一邊

494
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,923
I know there's people who hate me, who
would never use one of my typefaces in a million years
我知道有些人恨我，他們再過一百萬年也不會用我的字體

495
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,737
and vice versa, people who would use any typeface I design
但反過來，有些人會用我設計的每一款字體

496
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,273
not because it's good for them or it fits the purpose,
不是因為它們很好，或者因為它們能滿足某種需求

497
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,241
simply because I did it.
僅僅因為是我設計了它們

498
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,978
I think we alI do that. Certain bands I buy every CD from them;
我認為我們都是這樣的。有一個樂隊，我買他們所有的CD

499
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,313
some of them are crap.
其中有些很爛

500
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,748
But I buy it because l've always bought their CDs
但我買它，因為我總是買他們的CD

501
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:10,781
lch habe sie immer gekauft,
我總是買它們（德語）

502
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,975
or their music.
或者他們的音樂

503
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,982
Why do people buy certain things? The brand rubs off on them.
為什麼人們固定地購買某些東西？品牌消減了人們的選擇面

504
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,590
And typefaces are a brand.
字體也是一個品牌

505
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:24,527
You're telling an audience, This is for you, 
by using a certain typographic voice.
你用一種特定的"字體排印的聲音"告訴"聽眾"，這是屬於你們的

506
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,599
You'd recognize a Marlboro brand two miles away
你在2英里之外就能認出萬寶路的看板

507
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,334
because they use a typeface that they only use
因為他們至始至終只用一種字體

508
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:34,472
You can buy it; I have it; anyone can, it's called Neo Contact. Anybody can buy it,
你可以購買它，我都有，任何人都可以買到，這個字體叫 Neo Contact

509
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,340
but Marlboro have made the typeface theirs.
萬寶路把這個字體變成了他們的專有字體

510
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,143
You can recognize any Marlboro ad from miles away
你可以在幾裏之外就可以認出任何萬寶路的廣告

511
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,168
because of that stupid typeface.
就因為那個愚蠢的字體

512
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,237
lf they'd used Helvetica. . . Hello??? lt wouldn't quite work.
但假如他們用的是Helvetica . . . 喂？？？恐怕就不太靈了

513
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,810
The way something is presented will define the way you react to it.
某樣東西的展示方式將影響人們對它的反應

514
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:27,847
So you can take the same message and present it in three different typefaces,
所以你可以用三種不同的字體來傳達同一個資訊

515
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:33,030
and the response to that, the immediate emotional response will be different.
而人們的反應——看到的那一瞬間的情感反應，也會有所不同

516
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,268
And the choice of typeface is the prime weapon,
而字體在這種傳達之中，是一種終極武器

517
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,635
if you want, in that communication.
只要你想要

518
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:48,379
And I say weapon largely because with
commercial marketing and advertising,
我說字體是商業廣告和市場中的武器，是因為

519
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:54,051
the way a message is dressed is going to
define our reaction to that message in the advertising.
廣告中資訊的傳遞方式將直接決定我們對它的反應

520
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,588
So if it says, buy these jeans, and it's a grunge font,
如果用一種垃圾風格的字體說，"買這條牛仔褲吧"

521
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:02,460
you would expect it to be some kind of ripped jeans
你一定覺得那是一條滿是劃痕和撕裂的褲子

522
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,565
or to be sold in some kind of underground clothing store.
或者是地下服飾店才會有的東西

523
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,135
lf you see that same message in Helvetica,
但如果相同的資訊用 Helvetica 表現出來

524
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,637
you know, it's probably on sale at Gap.
你會覺得，那可能是一條GAP牌的牛仔褲

525
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,731
You know it's going to be clean, that you're
going to fit in, you're not going to stand out.
你知道那褲子會很乾淨，很貼身，穿上去也不顯眼

526
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,978
All of us, I would suggest, are prompted in subliminal ways.
任何人，我認為，都是受下意識驅使的

527
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:30,521
Maybe the feeling you have when you see a particular 
typographic choices used on a piece of packaging,
也許當你看到某個包裝上的字體時，會心有所動：

528
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:34,558
is just, I like the look of that, that feels good, that's my kind of product.
我喜歡那個樣子，感覺不錯，那就是我想要的產品

529
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,654
But that's the type casting its secret spell.
但那正是字體的神秘咒語在發揮它的威力

530
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:55,141
ln a way, Helvetica is a club. lt's a mark of membership;
從某種角度說，Helvetica 就是一個俱樂部，一種會員資格的標記

531
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,315
it's a badge that says we're part of modern society,
它是一個徽章，昭示則我們是現代社會的一分子

532
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,852
we share the same ideals.
我們有著共同的理想

533
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,482
lt's well-rounded, it's not going to be damaging or dangerous.
它方圓周正，不會給人帶來破壞和危險的感覺

534
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:14,056
Helvetica has almost like a perfect balance of push and pull in its letters,
Helvetica 的字母中有著一種近乎完美的收與放的平衡

535
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:18,197
and that perfect balance sort of is saying to us,
那種完美的平衡似乎在對我們說

536
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,328
well not sort of, it is saying to us,
很明顯的，它在對我們說：

537
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:26,010
Don't worry, any of the problems you're having, or problems in the world,
別擔心，你遇到的任何問題，或者說世界上的任何問題

538 
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,979 
or problems getting through the subway or finding a bathroom,   
諸如如何穿過地鐵，如何找到洗手間之類的問題

539
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:33,050 
all those problems aren't going to spill over, they'll be contained,  
所有那些問題都沒什麼大不了的，它們終將會被解決 

540
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,542
and in fact maybe they don't exist.
或者實際上它們根本就不存在

541
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:51,458
What I like is if this very serious typeface
我喜歡的一點是，如果說有一個嚴肅的字體

542
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,940
tells you the do's and don'ts of street life,
告訴你在街道上該做什麼，不該做什麼

543
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,876
and it must be Helvetica at that moment.
那一定是 Helvetica

544
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,781
The image of Helvetica as the corporate typeface
作為公司字體的 Helvetica

545
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:14,058
made it the so-called typeface of capitalism,
給它留下了所謂"資本主義字體"的形象

546
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,860
which I would actually reject and say
我要站出來反對

547
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,920
it's the typeface of socialism
我要說，它是社會主義的字體

548
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:28,639
because it is available all over and it's 
inviting dilettantes and amateurs and
因為它到處都是，很容易得到，它歡迎業餘愛好者

549
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,444
everybody to do typography,
和所有的人，都來從事文字排印

550
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:40,714
to create their own type designs, and l think that's a good thing.
創造他們自己的字體設計，我認為這是件好事

551
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,789
And I think I'm right calling Helvetica the perfume of the city.
我想應該把 Helvetica 叫做城市的香氣

552
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:01,071
lt's just something we don't notice usually
它是某種我們平常熟視無睹的東西

553
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,842
but we would miss very much if it wouldn't be there.
但一旦它消失，會讓我們非常的懷念

554
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:10,214
I think it's quite amazing that a typeface can advance to such a status
我想一個字體能發展到那種地步實在是讓人吃驚

555
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,148
in our lives
在我們的生活中

556
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:23,884
As is always the case with any style, there's a law of diminishing returns.
任何風格的東西，都有一個審美疲勞的邊際效用律

557
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,664
The more you see it, the more the public sees it,
你看得越多，整個社會看得越多

558
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:31,568
the more the designer uses those typographic and graphic solutions,
設計師們在字體排印和平面視覺上使用得越多

559
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:36,596
the more familiar, predictable, and ultimately dull they become.
它就變得越是熟悉，平庸和極度無聊

560
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:45,215
By the time I started as a designer, it sort
of seemed there was only one trick in town,
當我開始成為一個設計師的時候，這個行業的唯一“技巧”

561
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,751
which was like, what can you use instead of Helvetica.
大概就是，除了Helvetica，你還能用什麼？

562
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,020
You know, ABH, Anything But Helvetica.
你知道，A、B、H（血型），所有的東西都在用 Helvetica

563
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,256
And you do need lot of sans serif typefaces,
其實我們需要有很多的無襯線字體

564
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:56,493
but it seemed like Helvetica had just been used so much and overused so much 
我覺得 Helvetica 被廣泛地和過度的濫用了  

565
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,697
and associated with so many big, faceless things
並且總是與如此眾多巨大的、面無表情的事物關聯在一起

566
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:04,201
that it had lost all its capacity even, to my eyes at least, to look nice.
它已經失去了那種令人賞心悅目的能力，至少對我而言

567
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,504
And by the seventies, especially in America,
在70年代，特別是美國

568
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,407
you start to get a reaction against,
人們開始採取行動反抗

569
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,411
what it seems to those designers is the conformity,
那些千篇一律的設計風格

570
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:18,649
the kind of dull blanket of sameness
那種同一化的單調乏味

571
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,518
that this way of designing is imposing on the world.
這種設計方法已經蔓布整個世界

572
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,388
So something that had come out of idealism
設計已經不再發自內心的想法

573
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:29,018
has by this time become merely routine, and there's a need for a change.
而變成了純粹的例行公事。這種情形需要有所改變

574
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,803
You come into design,
當你進入設計領域的時候

575
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,340
at the point that you start out in history,
你也進入了歷史上的一個座標點

576
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,042
without knowing that you're starting out in history,
卻不自知

577
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,775
and often you don't have a sense of what came before you and how it got there,
通常來說你並不知道之前發生的故事，也不知道為什麼發展到了那一步

578
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,182
and you certainly don't know what's going to come after.
你也必定不知道將要發生什麼

579
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:57,855
And when I walked into design as a student at Tyler School of Art,
當我作為 泰勒藝術學校的學生，進入設計領域時

580
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:04,061
what struck me was sort of two separate cultures of design.
兩種截然不同的設計文化給我很大的衝擊

581
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,764
One was the corporate culture,
一種是公司文化

582
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,734
and the corporate culture was the visual language of big corporations,
公司文化指的是大公司的視覺語言

583
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,804
and at that time they were persuasively Helvetica.
那個時候的公司文化毫無疑問地是 Helvetica

584
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,141
They looked alike, they looked a little fascistic to me.
它們看上去很相似，在我看來有點法西斯

585
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,843
They were clean, it reminded me of cleaning up your room.
它們很乾淨，乾淨得讓得我想去清理自己的房間

586
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:25,415
I felt like, this was some conspiracy of my
mother's, to make me keep the house clean,
我甚至懷疑，這是我母親的陰謀，為的是讓我保持房間整潔

587
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,943
that all my messy room adolescent rebellion was coming back at me
我所有的有關混亂房間的青春期叛逆都回來了

588
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,854
in the form of Helvetica, and I had to overthrow it.
而這次是 Helvetica 版本的。 我要把它全部推翻

589
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:38,054
Hey, I got some printouts of the stuff from last night.
嘿，我昨晚拿到了一些列印輸出的東西

590
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,498
I also was morally opposed to Helvetica,
在道義上我也要反對 Helvetica

591
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:46,203
because I viewed the big corporations that were slathered in Helvetica
因為我看到那些被 Helvetica 粉飾的大公司們

592
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,006
as sponsors of the Vietnam War.
成為了越南戰爭的資助者

593
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,475
So therefore, if you used Helvetica,
所以，如果你用 Helvetica

594
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,111
it meant that you were in favor of the Vietnam War,
那就意味著你贊同越南戰爭

595
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,942
so how could you use it?
所以你怎麼能用它呢？

596
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:04,655
What looked cool to me at that point were
record album covers, Zig-Zag rolling papers,
當時最酷的東西是唱片專輯的封套，之字形的卷桶紙

597
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,025
the accoutrements of dope life and counterculture,
麻醉生命和反文化的裝備

598
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:13,930
obviously underground newspapers and magazines, and Pushpin Studios.
顯然還有地下報紙和雜誌，還有圖釘工作室

599
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:19,703
Pushpin Studios was the height of, at the time I was in college,
我讀大學的時候，圖釘工作室是最火的

600
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:24,975
everybody's ambition. To work there, to do
work that was as inspiring as their work,
所有人的願望是，到那裏去工作，做出象他們那樣充滿靈感的作品

601
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:30,981
because it seemed fresh and alive and witty and content-laden,
他們的作品看上去是那樣的鮮活，機智，寓意豐富

602
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:36,053
aside from the fact that Seymour Chwast and Milton Glazer could really draw.
而 Seymour Chwast 和 Milton Glazer 真的很會畫畫

603
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,511
And I wanted to make work that looked like that.
我也想做出那樣的作品

604
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,261
When I was at Tyler, I wanted to be an illustrator,
當我在泰勒藝術學校讀書的時候，我想成為一個插畫家

605
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,064
and I had a teacher named Stanislaw Zagorski.
我的老師叫 Stanislaw Zagorski

606
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:52,536
And I never knew what to do with the typography on my designs.
我從來就不知道在自己的設計中如何安排字體和排版

607
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,239
We would make book covers and record covers as school projects,
學校作業是設計書籍封面和唱片封套

608
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,611
and l'd go to the local art store, l'd go to
Sam Flax, and l'd buy Helvetica as press type,
我會去當地的藝術商店，去 Sam Flax 藝術設計商店，
購買 Helvetica 的轉印字

609
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:04,848
and l'd rub it down in the corner of the album 
the way I thought it was supposed to be, kind of flush left.
我把買到的字體擦印到唱片封套的角上，左對齊

610
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,452
And of course it would never line up
properly and thing would crackle and break
當然它們從來也排不整齊，會裂開或者破損

611
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,853
and it'd be terrible.
那真是可怕

612
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:15,492
And Zagorski told me to let go of the press type,
Zagorski 老師告訴我，別用轉印字了

613
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,892
and illustrate the type.
自己畫字體上去

614
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,859
And it hadn't dawned on me that typography could have personality
我恍然大悟，原來字體排印也可以是有個性的

615
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,528
the way drawing did.
就像畫畫一樣是有個性的

616
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,472
I realized that type had spirit and could convey mood,
我意識到字體是有靈魂的，能夠傳達情緒

617
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,774
and that it could be your own medium,
它可以成為你自己獨有的媒介

618
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:41,884
that it was its own palate, a broad palate to express all kinds of things.
它有著自己的韻味，一種能表達任何東西的能力

619
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:53,221
So I painted this cover the AlGA Annual,
我畫了這期 AIGA 年報的封面

620
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,200
and the title of the AlGA Annual was
Graphic Design U.S.A.
這期 AIGA 年報的標題是《美國平面設計》

621
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,803
And I decided I would take the title literally
我決定從字面上精確地表達這個題目

622
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,640
and sort of analyze what Graphic Design U.S.A. was,
對美國平面設計做某種分析

623
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,912
so I decided what l'd do is list every state in the United States,
於是我決定把美國每一個州都列出來

624
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,648
and the percentage of people who used Helvetica.
加上人們使用 Helvetica 的百分比

625
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:17,109
And I didn't have any scientific evidence of knowing
what percentage of people in each state used Helvetica,
我沒有科學的證據證明每一個州具體有多少人在用 Helvetica

626
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:21,525
so I decided to base it on the last Reagan election.
所以我決定基於最近一次雷根總統的選舉

627
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,261
So that the states that went for Reagan
所有支持雷根的州

628
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:28,095
all had more than 50% of the people who used Helvetica.
都有超過50%的人使用 Helvetica

629
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,301
| lf Helvetica was the typeface of the Vietnam War,
如果說 Helvetica 是越南戰爭的字體

630
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,103
what's the typeface of this war? |
那這場戰爭的字體是什麼？

631
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,705
The lraqi War?
伊拉克戰爭？

632
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,730
Helvetica.

633
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,180
Same time period, I mean it is, it's the same, it repeated.
相同的歷史時期，我的意思是， 歷史重演了

634
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,411
That's why we're there. Helvetica caused it.
那就是我們為什麼在那裏，Helvetica 導致的

635
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:52,956
And so ln the Postmodern period, designers were breaking things up.
在後現代時期，設計師們打破一切規矩

636
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:57,661
They wanted to get away from the orderly, clean, smooth surface of design
他們希望遠離有序、乾淨、柔順的設計

637
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,498
the horrible slickness of it all, as they saw it
遠離他們所見的一切恐怖的匠氣的東西

638
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,490
and produce something that had vitality.
創造出具有生命活力的作品

639
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:18,582
I myself got fairly disappointed
總的來說，對於現代主義

640
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,483
with Modernism in general.
我感到相當的失望

641
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,019
lt simply became boring.
它實在無聊透頂

642
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,657
lf I see a brochure now, with lots of white space
如果我現在看見一本小冊子，有大量的留白

643
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,261
that has like six lines of Helvetica up on the top
上面有六行 Helvetica

644
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:36,600
and a little abstract logo on the bottom
下面是一個抽象的小 logo

645
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,837
and a picture of a businessman walking somewhere,
然後配一張商務人士走路的照片

646
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:46,476
the overall communication that says to me is,
整個東西在對我說

647
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:51,209
Do Not Read Me, because I will bore the shit out of you
不要讀我，因為我會讓你無聊到死

648
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,951
not just visually, but also in content
不只是在視覺上，而且在內容上

649
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:59,411
because the content will likely say the same as it says to me visually.
因為內容和視覺往往是一致的

650
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:08,459
I was in terrible rock bands when I was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
我15，16，17歲的時候參加過一些很糟糕的搖滾樂隊

651
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:15,372
and I think through that experience got close to the album cover
我想正是那段經歷讓我接觸到唱片封面設計

652
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:19,741
and essentially I went to art school because of album covers.
實際上我上藝術院校也就是因為唱片封面

653
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:26,182
I probably was the last generation who got taught doing everything by hand,
我可能是最後的一代人了，被教育要用自己的雙手做一切事情

654
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:31,283
so you know, we drew 10 pt. type with a brush.
所以你知道，我們用筆刷來畫出10磅的字體

655
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:39,262
ln general, I was always fairly bored, you know, looking at type books
總的來說，查閱字體手冊對我來說永遠是一件很無聊的事

656
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:44,634
and deciding over and over again which type to pick for a certain project.
翻來覆去的考慮，某個項目到底該選擇哪種字體

657
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:48,570
lt just didn't seem a very interesting task to do.
那實在不是一件很有趣的任務

658
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:56,847
So here and there I think with the records, with the CD covers,
所以我總是想做CD封套的設計

659
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,583
we started to do our own type
我們開始設計自己的字體

660
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:04,654
and I think there was one instance, it was
for a Lou Reed cover,
有一次，我為 Lou Reed 設計一個封套

661
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:08,750
where this hand drawn typography resonated,
後來這個手寫字體因此聲名遠揚

662
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:14,998
and numerous projects came out in that vein, in all sorts of directions.
無數的設計專案找上門來，什麼方向的都有

663
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:19,196
You know, in a more funny direction and in a more serious direction,
有些方向比較有趣，有些則很嚴肅

664
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:27,676
where one time an intern carved a hand type into my skin for a lecture poster.
有一次為了做一張講座的海報，一個實習生在我皮膚上割出了字體

665
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,983
The type in an instant, in a single image,
字體存在於一瞬間，在一幅獨立的圖像中

666
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:37,154
tells the story of its making, tells you about its process,
自述了它的誕生，它的由來

667
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,749
in a very elegant way, in a very fast way.
以一種非常優雅的方式，一種非常快速的方式

668
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:48,431
That typography strangely became so well
known, just within the design community
那件字體排印作品在設計圈內出人意料地出名了

669
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,867
of course, that some people thought that's all we do,
當然，一些人認為那就是我們的全部成就

670
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,364
which thankfully is not the case.
謝天謝地那並不是事實

671
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:14,855
Well, I always thought that approach of people 
using only three or four typefaces very suspect.
我很懷疑那些人只用三、四種字體的做法是否正確

672
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:19,095
I think this could be interesting to do for a single project
我想如果是作為設計個案，那樣做可能會很有趣

673
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:25,398
as an exercise to put up additional limitations in order to focus yourself.
作為一種設定限制的練習，讓自己集中精神

674
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:30,063
But as a strategy over a lifetime
但作為一個終身的策略

675
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,677
I think it's akin to a writer saying,
我想就好比一個作家說

676
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,513
I'm only going to write in three or four words.
我打算一輩子就用這三四個字來寫作

677
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:40,550
Yes, you could probably do it, but for one why would you,
是的，你可以那樣做，但首先，你為什麼這樣做？

678
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:48,286
and for the second would it really yield an
interesting body of work over a lifetime?
第二，一輩子這麼做是否真的會產生大量有趣的作品？

679
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,710
Designers wanted to express their subjectivity,
設計師們希望表達自己的主觀看法

680
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,845
their own feelings about the world,
他們對這個世界的親身感受

681
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,616
their sense that they had something to say through design,
他們通過設計來表達自己的感覺

682
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,642
through the design choices they made.
通過他們對設計的選擇表達出來

683
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,017
And of course this caused controversy.
當然這樣就招來了爭議

684
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:24,584
lf you take a figure like Massimo Vignelli,
who'd been one of the Sixties' high priests,
設想一下，假如是60年代設計界的教父：Massimo Vignelli 

685
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,652
with his company Unimark,
他的公司叫 Unimark

686
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:31,334
it's right there in the name, Unimark, the idea of a uniform kind of expression.
字面上的意思是"始終一致的表達"

687
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,802
When he looked at this new work,
當他面對這個新作品

688
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,774
this expressive, subjective, wayward,
這個充滿表現力的、主觀的、狂放的作品

689
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,244
to his way of thinking irrational new way of designing,
以及這種完全不講理的新設計方式，他會作何感想？

690
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,236
lt seemed like the barbarians were not only at the gate,
——“看起來那些野蠻人不只是呆在門口，

691
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,874
but they'd stormed through and they'd taken over.
他們已經如暴風般奪門而入並佔領了一切。”

692
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,785
ln the '70s, the young generation was after psychedelic type,
70年代，年輕的一代都喜歡追逐迷幻劑一樣的字體

693
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,957
and all the junk that you could find.
什麼樣的垃圾你都可以弄到

694
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:58,895
And also in the '80s, with their minds completely confused
到了80年代，他們的思想完全亂做一團

695
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:04,634
by that. . . disease that was called Postmodernism,
他們被一種叫做“後現代”的病毒感染

696
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:09,239
people were just going around like 
chickens without their heads,
人們像無頭的雞一樣四處亂竄

697
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:16,702
by using all kinds of typefaces that came around that could say ''not modern''.
使用一切所謂"不現代"的字體

698
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,943
They didn't know what they were caring for,
他們不知道他們在乎什麼

699
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,916
they only knew about what they were against.
他們只知道他們要反對什麼

700
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,147
And what they were against was Helvetica.
他們要反對的就是 Helvetica

701
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,738
I had no formal training in the field,
我並沒有受過正式的訓練

702
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,775
ln my case I never learned all the things l wasn't supposed to do.
就我而言，我從不學那些我“應該”學習的知識

703
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,676
I just did what made sense to me.
我只學我感興趣的東西

704
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,876
I was just experimenting really.
我只是在不斷的嘗試 

705
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,850
So when people started getting really upset, I didn't really understand why.
所以當人們開始感到失望時，我覺得無法理解

706
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,127
l'd say, ''What's the big deal? What are you talking about?''
我說，這有什麼大不了的？你們在說什麼？

707
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,893
And it was many years later that somebody explained to me,
很多年以後有人對我解釋了其中的原因

708
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,200
probably better than I can explain it now,
可能比我現在解釋得更明白些

709
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,372
is that basically there was this group that
spent a lot of time trying to organize things,
大體上是這樣，有一撥人花了很多時間組織起來

710
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,474
and get some kind of system going,
好不容易讓某個系統運行起來

711
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,637
and they saw me as coming in and throwing that out the window.
然後他們看著我走進來把它扔出了窗外 

712
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:25,382
Which I might have done, but it wasn't the starting point
我可能會那樣做，但這不是原因

713
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,950
and it wasn't the plan.
我並不是有意那樣做的

714
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:34,721
Only much later did I learn the terms Modernism, and this and that.
我在之後很晚才知道了“現代主義”之類的術語

715
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:38,461
Raygun Magazine was very much experimental,
Raygun 雜誌 很有實驗性質

716
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,532
it was completely experimental. Every issue we'd try a lot of things
很徹底的實驗性。每一期我們都作很多嘗試

717
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,901
and a lot of them worked,
很多嘗試很奏效

718
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,403
and a lot of them didn't work.
也有些不太靈的

719
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,006
I never saw proofs so a lot of times there were just mistakes,
我從來不看印刷樣稿，所以很多時候會有些錯誤

720
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,675
flat-out mistakes, that people would write long essays on
最低級的錯誤，人們會寫長篇大論

721
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:57,313
why I did this black type on a black boot, or something.
為什麼我把這個黑色的字，放在了一個黑色靴子或者別的什麼上面？

722
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,907
No, I never saw a proof, what are you talking about?
不，我沒見過印刷樣稿，你們在討論什麼？

723
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,986
lt's very hard to do the more subjective, interpretive stuff well.
要做好那些比較主觀的、詮釋性的作品不是那麼簡單的

724
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,091
You know, I can teach anybody off the street
你知道，我可以教大街上的任何人

725
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,961
how to design a reasonable business card or newsletter.
如何設計一個像模像樣的商業名片或簡報

726
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,965
But if I bring the same group off the street and play a CD
但是如果我把同一撥人帶去聽一張CD

727
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,902
and say, ''Okay, now let's interpret that music for a cover,
然後說，"好，現在讓我們為那段音樂設計一個封套"

728
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,105
well 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost
十個人中有九個會感到手足無措

729
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,441
and are going to do something corny and expected,
他們會做出一些毫無新意的東西

730
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,377
and one person is going to do something amazing
但會有人做出一些令人吃驚的東西

731
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:31,147
because that music spoke to them and it sent them in some direction
因為那段音樂傳達給他們一些東西，將他們引向某個方向

732
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:35,785
that nobody else could go. And that's the
area to me where it gets more interesting
每個人去的方向都不一樣，但我在乎的正是這些有意思的、

733
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,922
and exciting, and more emotional.
激動人心的、更情緒化的地方

734
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,516
And that's where the best work comes from.
最好的作品就是這樣來的

735
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,563
This is an article on the singer Bryan Ferry,
這是篇關於歌手 Bryan Ferry 的文章

736
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:51,100
and when I read the article it was very
much like so many of these others I had read,
我讀起來的時候，和我以前讀過的那麼多文章沒什麼區別

737
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,971
and I was like, oh man, how disappointing, how boring.
我就像是，哦天，那有多讓人失望，多麼的無聊啊

738
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,808
And I went through all my fonts, which at
the time would've been hundreds and hundreds,
然後我看了看我有所的字體，現在差不多有成百上千了

739
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,141
uhm, well, it still is for that matter, and
恩，好吧，仍然是那個問題

740
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:08,651
didn't find one that seemed to fit my disgust and boredom with this article.
我找不到使這篇文章的看上去不那麼噁心和乏味的字體

741
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,120
And I finally came to the bottom and there was Dingbats,
最終我在列表的最底部找到了 Dingbats

742
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,657
which of course now it's Zapf Dingbats so it's literally the last one.
現在的名字叫 Zapf Dingbats，所以按字母排序它是最後一個

743
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,491
And I was like, well it's boring and not worth reading,
然後我想，既然這篇文章如此無聊不值一讀

744
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,797
why not do it in Zapf Dingbats?
那為什麼不用Zapf Dingbats（一種裝飾符號字體）來排版？

745
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:25,301
lt's a font. So it's all set in Dingbats,
這也是一個字體啊，所以就全部用 Dingbats 好了

746
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:29,939
it is the actual font, you could highlight it 
and make it Helvetica or something
這就是現在的字體，你可以把它全選換成 Helvetica 或者別的什麼字體

747
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,641
and you'd be able to read it
然後你就可以閱讀了  

748
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,474
but it really wouldn't be worthwhile, it's not very well-written.
但是它的確不值，它寫得實在不是很好

749
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,781
Don't confuse legibility with communication.
別把易讀性和資訊傳達混為一談

750
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,918
Just because something's legible, doesn't mean it communicates
某樣東西清晰易讀，並不說明它能能傳達資訊

751
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:45,445
And more importantly doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
更重要的是，並不意味著它傳達了正確的資訊

752
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:51,094
And vice-versa, something that may be difficult to initially read
反過來說，某個東西或許開始的時候很難辨識

753
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,162
could be sending a completely different message
但它傳達了一種全然不同的資訊

754
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,099
that is valid for where it's being used,
同時又切合主題

755
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,136
and that may require a little more time or the involvement of the reader.
那麼，或許它就是需要讀者多花點時間和心思的

756
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:04,974
But it almost seems stronger the other way,
這種方式表達的效果往往要更為強烈

757
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:11,714
if something is a very important message
and it's set in a boring, non-descript way,
如果有條非常重要的資訊用一種平凡無聊的方式排出來

758
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,551
the message can be lost.
這條消息很可能就被人忽略了

759
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,042
I mean that doesn't say ''caffeinated''!
我說這一點“含咖啡因”的意思也沒有！

760
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,452
It's just like, hello?
就像說“你好”一樣沒有實際含義

761
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,351
|Why Not?|
（為什麼沒有呢？）

762
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,920
It's just sitting there! There's nothing caffeinated about it!
它就呆在那兒，完全嗅不出咖啡因的味道來

763
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,964
There's nothing ''extramarital'' about that.
這個也不帶一點“外遇 (extramatital)”的意思

764
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,001
There's no ''sunshine'' here.
這個就更沒有“陽光 (sunshine)”了

765
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,097
That's no fun, that's not a fun sandlot.
這可多沒意思，不是個有趣的地方 (sandlot 沙地)

766
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,375
Where's the explosion?
“爆炸”？在哪里？

767
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,344
This could be the first date.
這也可能是第一次約會的（“第三次約會”）

768
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:44,711
This might be close, these buses are kind of boring.
這個倒還湊合，這些灰狗巴士是挺無聊的

769
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:53,984
There's a very thin line between simple and clean and powerful,
and simple and clean and boring.
“簡潔有力”和“空洞乏味”之間的界限其實很模糊

771
00:59:55,291 --> 01:00:00,251
That was sort of the rise of what's referred to as grunge typography,
這就是所謂垃圾風格字體設計的興起

772
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:06,135
and that became an all-consuming aesthetic for two, three, four, five years
並成為了二、三、四、五年內吞噬一切的“美學”

773
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:10,239
as that trend worked its way down from the masters who originated it
這種趨勢從其發端的大師們開始

774
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,711
to anyone who sort of already had a tendency to make mistakes
一直延伸到那些時常犯錯的傢伙

775
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,580
and all of sudden found that they looked good now instead of incompetent,
他們忽然之間發現自己可以勝任了

776
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,945
which is how they looked the day before.
不再象以前那樣白癡無能

777
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:24,754
Typography was so broken by the end of the grunge period,
垃圾時代末期的字體排印設計殘破不堪

778
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,290
just lying there in a twisted heap,
就像置身於一堆混亂之中

779
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,160
all rules cast aside, no apparent way forward,
所有的規則都被拋棄了，前方看不到出路

780
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,399
that all those designers could perhaps do by the late nineties was to go back
所以這些設計師們在 90 年代末能做的就是回歸

781
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,836
to return to an earlier way of designing,
回歸到早期的設計方式

782
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:43,272
but with a new set of theories to support it.
但需要用一套新的理論來支持它

783
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,505
For us, modernism does have a more subversive side.
對我們而言，現代主義確實有著更顛覆的一面

784
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,874
I think that the whole image of modernism
我認為整個“現代主義”

785
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:22,578
as something that is primarily concerned with functionalism,
基本上就是“功能主義”加“實用主義”

786
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:26,883
utilitarianism, that is something that emerged much later,
後者是很晚才出現的

787
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,552
that is a sort of a late-modernist thing.
屬於某種後期現代主義

788
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,521
I think the early-modernist movements,
我覺得早期的現代主義運動

789
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,624
like Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism,
像達達主義、未來主義、超現實主義

790
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,994
all had their more subversive sides
都有著它們顛覆的一面

791
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,930
and their more, how do you call it,
以及……該怎麼說呢

792
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,890
dialectical sides, so they went against something.
…更辨證的一面，所以它們都有其針對的目標

793
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,142
It's not that we are against that experimentation
我們並不反對那樣的實驗

794
01:01:55,211 --> 01:02:01,946
that people like David Carson and Emigre and Fuse, that Neville Brody did.
像 David Carson、Emigre、Fuse 和 Neville Brody 所做的

795
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,588
We think what we do is a sort of an extension of that.
我覺得我們所做的其實是對他們的實驗的一種延伸

796
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:10,660
All that hunting to the next typeface every time, it took a lot of energy,
每一次都要搜尋新的字體讓我們疲憊不堪

797
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,864
and I can still remember as students that we were really disappointed
我還記得學生時代我們常常會很失望

798
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:18,925
because you wanted to use a certain
typeface and then you saw somebody else had used it,
因為你想用的某個字體被別人用了


800
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,938
and then you couldn't use it because you wanted to be original.
所以你就不能用它了，因為你想顯得有原創性

801
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:26,398
And with Helvetica this whole problem is
non-existent because everybody's using Helvetica.
用 Helvetica 就根本不存在這個問題，因為人人都在用它

802
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:33,216
A lot of people see the way a young generation of 
designers uses a typeface such as Helvetica
很多人覺得，新一代設計師們對 Helvetica 這類字體的使用方式

803
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:37,186
as a more superficial way, as a sort of appropriation of a style.
相當的膚淺，只是在照搬某種風格

804
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,089
I think we would very much disagree with that.
我想我們完全不能同意

805
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,525
I think all three of us grew up in the '70s
我們三個都是七十年代出生的

806
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:48,225
in the Netherlands which was dominated by the last moment of late Modernism.
當時的荷蘭還在後期現代主義的“最後統治”之下

807
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:52,168
For example, the city I was born in and grew up in, Rotterdam,
比如我出生和成長的城市鹿特丹

808
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:56,038
the logotype was designed by Wim Crouwel,
標誌字體是 Wim Crouwel 設計的

809
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:59,041
the stamps were designed by Crouwel,
郵票是 Crouwel 設計的

810
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,977
the telephone book was designed by Crouwel,
電話簿也是 Crouwel 設計的

811
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,112
the atlas that we used in school was designed by Crouwel.
我們學校裏用的地圖冊還是 Crouwel 設計的

812
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:08,317
So for us it is almost like a natural mother tongue,
所以對我們來說，Helvetica 就好像是我們的母語一樣

813
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,919
that's something really natural.
是非常自然的一件事

814
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,956
It's not that we ... I mean, a lot of people think you sort of study it
並非我們……我是說，很多人覺得你是從書本上看到

815
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,592
from books and then copy it or something, but
然後抄襲過來，但是

816
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:20,323
I would really say that it's almost in our blood.
我更願意認為它早已流淌在我們的血液裏

817
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,334
It's also funny because a lot of people connect Helvetica
還有一件有趣的事，很多人認為 Helvetica 有可能會導致

818
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:30,506
sometimes with the dangers of globalization and standardization.
全球化和標準化的危險

820
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,342
I'm not afraid for that quality at all
我一點不擔心這種情況

821
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,413
because I'm just know that everybody can put a twist on it.
因為人人都可以調整它來適應自己的需要

822
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:44,453
I think you can put as much nationality
in the spacing of a typeface as in the typeface itself.
我認為，在字體間距中體現出的國家個性，絲毫不亞於字體本身

824
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:48,758
And I think the way people like Crouwel
use Helvetica is typically Dutch, I think,
我認為象 Crouwel 他們對 Helvetica 的使用就是典型的荷蘭式的

825
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:54,030
and that's why I'm never really impressed with the argument
所以我向來對所謂

826
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:58,990
that Helvetica is a sort of global monster.
“Helvetica 是一個全球化怪物”這樣的觀點不以為然

827
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,442
I'm not one of those people who is a real typographer,
我並不是那種真正意義上的字體設計師

828
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,481
I don't know all the fancy words for all the letters,
不知道那些關於字母的華麗辭彙

829
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:57,386
and the sort of ligatures and ascenders
and descenders and all that kind of thing.
比如“連字”啦、“上升部”、“下降部”之類的東西

830
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,957
I just more, sort of, react to certain things,
我只是……只是對某些東西更有感覺

831
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,859
and just do what I feel is right,
只是把自己感覺對味的東西做出來

832
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:07,386
so I'm never sort of a classical type guy.
所以我從來不是那種傳統意義上的“字體設計師“

833
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,833
So I get obsessed about things, I collect things,
我為某些事物所著迷，喜歡收集一些東西，

834
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:18,641
you know, I've got so many bits and scraps
of paper, of things that you find on the street,
你看，我有這麼多零碎的紙片，來自街邊常見的事物

835
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:23,179
or wrappers. It's just making something
beautiful out of something very ordinary.
以及包裝紙。它們讓非常平常的事物變得漂亮起來

836
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,648
That's what I really enjoy, the ordinary things
這是我所喜歡的，平常的東西

837
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:30,608
that most people would just gloss over, I find really beautiful.
大多數人可能會一瞥而過，但是我覺得它們很漂亮

838
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,961
The biggest thing for me in terms of design
用設計的語言來說，我覺得最重要的是

839
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,964
is to get a sort of emotional response from a piece.
“於細微處獲得情感上的回饋”

840
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,455
That's some of the best design, I think.
我覺得這是最棒的設計

841
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:49,605
I see stuff and to me, if it makes me go,
我觀察周遭的事物，從中獲得創作靈感

842
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:53,075
I wish I'd done that, that for me is the biggest thing, you know.
我希望我做出好的作品，這對我來說是最重要的事情

843
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:59,537
Or you just get this real whooo, kind of like, oooh, that's nice.
或者讓你感到，哇，這真不錯

844
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,977
It's all about that emotional response.
這些都是情感的回饋

845
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:14,730
One of the things I've always really wanted to design is airplane signage,
我一直很想做的一件事是為飛機設計引導標識

846
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,266
an identity for an airline.
以及航空公司的視覺形象

847
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:24,407
I'd love to do the uniforms, or you know,
seats and the whole thing, the trucks and
我很想設計制服，又或者是座椅等一整套的東西

848
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:27,877
that kind of thing. I think it would be brilliant.
還有卡車之類的東西。我想一定會很棒的

849
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,881
You know, I've done these twelve-inch sleeves for so long;
你看，我做這些十二英寸的唱片封套設計都那麼久了

850
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,483
I want to go a little bit bigger scale now.
現在我想做些更“大號”的設計

851
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:39,318
It's that idea that something's designed to stand the test of time,
我希望能設計經得起時間考驗的東西

852
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:43,893
and hopefully some of the things I'm
designing will be still being used in twenty, thirty years.
最好在二三十年後還有人使用

853
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,361
I'd love to think that.
我會非常開心

854
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:55,671
I got married about three years ago. I did the wedding invites,
我三年前結的婚，當時我設計了婚禮的請柬

855
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:59,875
which believe me, is just the worst job you can ever do as a graphic designer.
相信我，這是身為一個平面設計師最糟糕的工作

856
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:03,012
I've done other people's wedding invites, and I'll never do one again.
我曾做過別人的婚禮請柬，但我永遠都不想再做了

857
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,503
It's the most stressful job I've ever had,
這是我做過壓力最大的一個工作

858
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:10,719
dealing with mother in laws is just horrific. But I did ours,
和岳母打交道真的很恐怖，但我還是做了我們自己的

859
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,322
and on the order of service
然後在婚禮儀程卡上


860
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:20,062
I did a little credit to give thanks to Max Miedinger for Helvetica.
為感謝 Helvetica，我把  Max Miedinger  寫在了致謝名單中

861
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:26,102
But my wife vetoed that; I had to take it off the invite.
但被我妻子否決了，我只好把他從名單中去掉了

862
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,434
But it was funny . . .
不過這蠻搞笑的…

863
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:40,707
I think I fell into the step of Helvetica when I was at DR.
我記得我開始用 Helvetica 是在 DR(設計共和國) 的時候

864
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,948
I always really enjoy using Helvetica
我總是很享受使用 Helvetica 的感覺

865
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:51,348
because . . .some people say they use a
different typeface because it gives a different feeling.
因為…有些人說他們要用不同的字體來表達不同的意思

866
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:56,531
And I really enjoy the challenge of making Helvetica speak in different ways.
但我卻很樂意接受挑戰，讓 Helvetica 用不同的方式說話

867
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,003
It's been around for fifty years, coming up,
它到現在已經有五十年的歷史了

868
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:07,510
and it's just as fresh as it was . . . obviously,
it wasn't intended to be this cool thing,
給人的感覺卻還跟新的一樣……當然，它不是有意設計得如此奇妙的

869
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,910
but it's just a beautiful font.
但它就是一個這麼美好的字體

870
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:21,951
Well, we are less obsessed with Helvetica
嗯，我們現在對 Helvetica 沒有

871
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,819
than we used to be.
以前那麼著迷了

872
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:31,627
Yes, we were really obsessed with Helvetica, yet not more so much.
沒錯，我們對它曾經非常著迷，但現在沒那麼厲害了

873
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:37,930
We accepted it somehow ... We came to a
point where we accepted that it's just there.
不過我們還是能接受它的存在

874
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,766
We like restrictions.
我們喜歡限制

875
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,737
We can't operate, we can do nothing without restrictions.
沒有限制我們什麼也做不了

876
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,171
The more restrictions we have, the more，happy we are.
限制越多，我們就越開心

877
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,872
When we started school,
在我們讀書的時候

878
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,311
the influences in graphic design were like Brody and Carson.
那時平面設計的潮流人物是 Brody 和 Carson 他們

879
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:30,386
It's only after that we really looked at Josef
到後來我們才真正仔細研究了 Josef Muller-Brockmann 的作品

880
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:34,254
work, and '60s Swiss Typography.
以及 60 年代的瑞士文字排印設計

881
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,559
When we started the office we really said
所以在我們剛開始這間工作室的時候說過

882
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,530
we wanted to look back,
我們希望回顧過去

883
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:46,297
to find more structured design.
找到更結構化的設計

884
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:52,705
For us it's very important to reduce the elements we use.
對我們來說，精簡我們使用的元素是很重要的

885
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,946
When it comes to type, we will only use, if possible, one typeface,
在用到字體時，我們會盡可能地只用一種字體

886
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,575
or two, and if possible we will use one size.
或兩種，而且只要可能我們會只用一種字型大小

887
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,621
We don't like humanistic typefaces for example,
比如我們不喜歡人文主義的字體

888
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,715
it must be more rational
我們選用的字體必須更具理性色彩

889
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,487
because otherwise it has too much expression.
否則就可能包含過多表達

890
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:25,303
We think that Helvetica contains somehow a design program.
我們覺得 Helvetica 暗含了某種設計的規範

891
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,677
It will lead you to a certain language also, and this is also
它會將你引至某種特定的語言

892
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:33,615
one of the secrets of the success of Helvetica
這也是Helvetica 成功的秘訣之一

893
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,719
that in itself it is already
就是它自身已經包含了

894
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,089
it has a certain style, a certain aesthetic
某種特定的風格，某種特定的美感

895
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,359
that you will just use it like that,
你就會這麼用它

896
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,695
because of the typeface, because the typeface wants it like that.
因為這個字體，它本身要求這麼做

897
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,531
You wilI do what the typeface wants you to do.
你只要聽從它的指令照做就行了

898
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,534
If you are not a good designer, or if you are not a designer,
如果你不是個好的設計師，或者你本來就不是設計師

899
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:57,494
just use Helvetica Bold in one size,
用固定字型大小的 Helvetica 粗體就是了

900
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:02,968
like for a flyer. . . it looks good.
比如用在宣傳單頁上...它就會... 很好看

901
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,770
So it may very well be that when it comes to trends,
很可能，至少在平面設計的潮流上

902
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:07,109
at least in graphic design, we've reached sort of the end of history.
我們已經抵達了歷史的終點

903
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,413
The pendulum that swings back and forth
doesn't have any more directions it can swing in.
鐘擺往復運動，不會再擺向第三個方向

904
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:19,688
The final trend may simply be the completely 
democratic distribution of the means of production
最終的潮流可能就是生產方式完全為大眾所用

905
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:23,392
to anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.
每個希望能擁有的人，每個負擔得起的人都能得到

906
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,395
You can have a music studio for a couple thousand bucks,
你花上幾千塊錢就能擁有一個音樂工作室

907
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,598
you can have a film studio for ten grand,
花上一萬美元就能有一間電影工作室

908
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:34,503
you definitely can be a designer with one or two thousand dollars,
你當然也可以花上一兩千美元來成為一個設計師

909
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:38,474
and have basically
而且基本上

910
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,577
similar tools as the people who do this for a living.
你使用的工具和那些專業的人士也不會相差太遠

911
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:45,080
If all these people have the tools to make good design,
當這些人都有了好的設計工具，他們就會

912
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,682
they realize that it ain't that easy.
意識到到事情並不那麼簡單

913
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,985
It's not just opening a template in CorelDraw or in Powerpoint.
設計不是打開一個 Corel Draw 或 PowerPoint 範本那麼簡單

914
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:54,656
It's not about having the latest version of whatever program.
擁有某個軟體的最新版本並不是設計

915
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:58,360
If you don't have the eye, if you don't a sense of design,
如果你沒有眼力，如果你沒有對設計的感覺

916
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,523
the program's not going to give it to you.
軟體也不可能賦予你

917
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:06,935
I remember, years ago, a friend of mine
who produced radio commercials
我記得幾年前，有個做電臺廣告的朋友

918
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:11,206
had five guys go out in the hallway of CBS Records
叫五個人到 CBS 唱片公司的走廊去

919
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:15,544
and sing the beginning of ''Round Round Get Around, I Get Around''
去唱 Beach Boys 的 “Round Round Get Around, I Get Around”

920
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,745
by the Beach Boys.
這首歌的開頭

921
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:20,682
And they really tried, they rehearsed for a
week to get their harmonies right,
他們確實很努力，他們花了一個星期來排練，把和聲練准

922
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,953
and they were the best vocalists who worked in that department on that floor,
而且他們是所在樓層裏唱歌唱得最好的

923
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:25,854
and they loved music.
而且他們還很熱愛音樂

924
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:26,855
And they went out and they sang it,
然後他們出來演唱了

925
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,016
and of course they were totally flat and sounded horribly...
當然他們唱得非常的糟糕....

926
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,960
terrible. But they'd rehearsed. And then
太糟糕了。但他們排練過了，然後

927
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,298
the voiceover for the commercial said,
''Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.''
這個廣告的畫外音說：“現在你該知道 Beach Boys 唱得有多好了吧。”

928
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:39,101
And it's really sort of the same thing.
這和我們現在所說的其實是一樣的

929
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:43,435
The closer you come to it, and the more you see it,
你越是接近它，對它看得越多

930
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,607
the more you appreciate it when it's terrific.
就越能夠欣賞它的優秀

931
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,510
There are more good, young type designers
現在的優秀的年輕字體設計師越來越多了，比以往的任何時候都要多

932
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:53,415
now, by young I mean probably late
twenties, early thirties, than at any time in history.
我所說的“年輕”指的是二十年多歲三十出頭的

933
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,818
So who knows what typefaces they will design
誰也不知道他們將設計出什麼樣的字體

934
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,887
in terms of style and so on. But they'll be good.
什麼樣的風格... 但他們會好起來

935
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:03,926
And to my way of thinking, that is a huge gain,
在我看來，這就是巨大的進步

936
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:09,421
a huge benefit that comes with this more
democratic, more accessible technology.
受益於這些更大眾、更普及的技術

937
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,469
There's just something about Helvetica.
Helvetica 中就是有著某種特質

938
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:19,133
Something about the fact that people keep
saying I've come up with an improvement of Helvetica.
人們不斷的說“我對 Helvetica 做了某種改進”

939
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,937
And it never is really good.
但這些改進從來不會討好

940
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:28,150
You know, I wonder whether or not somehow there's 
some whole undiscovered science of typography
我不知道字體設計中是不是還存在某些尚未發現的科學

941
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,120
that would sort of say it's not just because we're used to seeing it,
能夠解釋出，並非因為我們已經看慣了它 (Helvetica)

942
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,723
it's not just because it was associated with all these things
也並非因為它 (Helvetica) 和那些

943
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,125
that we consider authoritative,
...我們認為的“權威”聯繫在了一起

944
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:41,330
but it somehow has this kind of inherent rightness.
而是因為這個字體本身具有的一種內在的合理性

945
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:45,334
You know, the rightness of the way the lowercase a meets the curve,
比如，小寫的 a 運用曲線中的合理性

946
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,103
the rightness of the way the G has the thing that comes down,
和大寫的 G 下劃的那一豎的合理性

947
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:51,539
the rightness of the way the c strokes are like that instead of that.
還有 c 的筆劃是這樣而不是那樣

948
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:56,980
I mean, I wouldn't have believed that those
things actually could be right or wrong
我的意思是，我不認為這些合理性完全是由

949
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,314
as opposed to someone's tastes.
個人的欣賞品味所決定的

950
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:04,342
Yet we sort of have nearly fifty years of
history of the thing just sitting there
這個有著近50年歷史的東西

951
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:10,546
daring people to fix it. And it seems to be unfixable.
在那兒輕蔑地等著我們去修正它。但它看上去就是那樣的無懈可擊

952
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,930
It's always changing, time is changing,
世界永遠在變，時代在變

953
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:19,201
the appreciation of typefaces is changing very much.
對字體的欣賞也在發生很大的改變

954
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,471
Why you grab a certain typeface for a certain job
我們現在為某個專案選擇某個字體的原因

955
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:29,172
has a different meaning than we grabbed a typeface in the fifties for a certain job.
和我們在五十年代時為某個專案選擇某個字體有著完全不同的含義

956
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:35,912
You are always child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.
人永遠都是時代的孩子，無法跳出你所處的時代

957
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:48,296
What we have is a climate now in which the very idea of visual communication
我們現有的風氣是，視覺交流的觀念

958
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:51,133
and graphic design, if we still want to call it that,
和平面設計（如果我們還願意這麼叫的話）的觀念

959
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,969
is accepted by many more people.
已獲得廣泛的認可

960
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:59,408
They get it. They understand it. They're starting to see graphic communication
他們瞭解了，他們理解了，他們開始把圖形交流

961
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:02,844
as an expression of their own identity.
視為對自己身份的一種表達

962
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:08,283
And the classic case of this is the social networking programs
一個經典的例子是，那些社交網站程式

963
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:14,056
such as MySpace, where you can customize your profile.
比如 MySpace，在那你可以定制自己的個人資料

964
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,192
You can change the background, you can put pictures in,
你可以修改背景，可以加入圖片

965
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,462
you can change the typeface to anything you want,
隨心所欲的更換字體

966
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,833
and those choices, those decisions you make,
而你所做的這些選擇

967
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:29,371
become expressions of who you are. You start to care about it, in the way
就表明了你是什麼樣的人。你開始關心這個

968
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,975
you care about the clothing you're wearing as an expression of who you are,
就象跟你關心你的衣著，那也是你個人身份的表達

969
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,011
or your haircut or whatever,
又或是你的髮型之類

970
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:40,115
or how you decorate your apartment-all of those things.
還有你如何裝飾自己的房間——等等這一切

971
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:44,086
You know, we accept the idea of identity being expressed in that way,
你知道，我們接受了以這種方式表達自我的觀念

972
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,054
through these consumer choices.
通過對消費的選擇來表達自己的身份

973
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:49,458
Well, now it's happening in the sphere of visual communication
好吧，既然現在這已經在視覺交流的圈子中發生

974
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:54,930
and there's no reason as the tools become ever more sophisticated,
而且工具也在變得越來越精密

975
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,627
why this just won't go on developing, devoloping and developing.
它就沒理由不繼續發展下去，永無止境地發展下去

976
01:18:59,627 --> 01:19:09,627
