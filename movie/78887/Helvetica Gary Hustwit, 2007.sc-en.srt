Type is saying things to us all the time.
字体永远在对我们诉说着什么

2
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,838
Typefaces express a mood,an atmosphere,
字体总是在传达某种情绪和氛围

3
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,784
they give words a certain coloring.
赋予词语某种“色彩”

4
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,020
Everywhere you look, you see typefaces.
无论你朝哪里看，你总是能看到各种字体


5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,216
But there's probably one you see more than any other one, and that's Helvetica.
但其中有一种可能是你见的最多的，那就是 Helvetica


6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,729
You know, there it is, and it just seems to come from nowhere.
它们存在着，仿佛原本就是环境的一部分

7
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,857
lt seems like air, it seems like gravity.
它们就好像是空气，或是重力

8
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,297
lt's hard to evaluate it,
很难恰当地评价它

9
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,700
it's like being asked what you think about off-white paint,
就好像有人问你该如何评价乳白色的墙漆

10
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,931
it's just, there.
它就是那样的...存在着

11
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:24,238
lt's hard to get your head around something that big.
你很难逃避或漠视它的存在，因为它是如此的巨大

12
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,707
Most people who use Helvetica use it because it's ubiquitous.
大部分人使用Helvetica 是因为它的无所不在

13
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,716
lt's like going to McDonalds instead of thinking about food.
就好像我们由于饥不择食，只好去麦当劳吃东西

14
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,411
Because it's there, it's on every street corner.
因为它就在那里，街头巷尾到处都有

15
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,148
So let's eat crap, because it's on the corner.
所以我们就吃垃圾吧！因为街角就有

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,417
For me, Helvetica's just this beautiful, timeless thing.
对我来说，Helvetica就是这样一个美好的、永恒的东西

17
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,960
And certain things shouldn't be messed with, you know?
这样美好的东西是应该好好去珍惜的，对不对？

18
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,801
Graphic design is the communication framework,
平面设计是信息沟通的“框架”

19
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,636
through which these messages, about what the world is now
它承载着各样的信息，诸如这个世界的现状

20
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,903
and what we should aspire to,
我们对未来的向往

21
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,945
it's the way they reach us.
信息就是通过这样的方式传达给我们

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,416
The designer has an enormous responsibility,
所以设计师们担负着极其重大的责任

23
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,545
those are the people putting their wires into our heads.
他们是那些将线路接入我们大脑的人


24
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,585
Now should l talk? Should l not talk?
现在我应该说吗？不应该说吗？

25
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,718
You want me to say something?
你希望我说点什么吗？

26
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,089
Say something, say nothing?
说吗，不说吗？

27
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,431
The life of a designer is a life of fight:
设计师的生活是战斗的生活

28
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,990
fight against the ugliness.
对抗丑陋的战斗

29
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,801
Just like a doctor fights against disease.
就好像医生对抗疾病一样

30
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,500
For us, the visual disease is what we have around,
对我们而言，我们的周边漫布着这种视觉的“疾病”

31
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,545
and what we try to do is to cure it somehow, with design.
我们所竭力要做的，就是通过设计，来治愈这种“疾病”

32
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:17,550
A good typographer always has sensitivity about the distance between the  letters.
一个好的字体排印设计师，对字母之间的距离永远有着高度的敏感


33
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,458
We think typography is black and white.
我们以为排印设计就是黑色加白色

34
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:23,654
Typography is really white, it's not even black.
而排印实际上是白的，而不是黑的


35
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,621
lt is the space between the blacks that really makes it.
因为字体是由黑色形体之间的空间来定义的


36
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,234
ln a sense it's like music,
这有点象音乐

37
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,704
it's not the notes, it's the space you put between the notes that makes the music.
音乐不是由音符，而是由音符之间的空间来定义的

38
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:39,068
For instance, we designed the corporate identity for American Airlines.
举个例子，我们曾经为美国航空设计过CI


39
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,113
This was done in 1966,
那是在1966年完成的

40
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,241
and the novelty at the time was the fact of making one word instead of two
我们进行了一个在当时来说比较新奇的设计，把两个单词合成一个

41
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,582
American Airlines by making AmericanAirlines all one word,
我们把 American 和 Airlines 连接成一个单词 AmericanAirlines（美国航空）

42
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,617
half red and half blue, just separated by the color.
一半红色，一半蓝色，仅仅用颜色来区分

43
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,824
What could me more American than red and blue? You know, so it's perfect.
还有比红色加蓝色更美国的吗？所以，它很完美

44
00:04:56,063 --> 00:05:00,062
lt's the only airline in the last forty years that has
这是唯一的一家航空公司

45
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,930
not changed their identity.
50年来从未更改过它的视觉识别

46
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,461
All the airlines coming and going and changing... 
American Airlines is still the same. There's no need to change,
所有的航空公司都在不停的变更他们的CI。
只有美国航空屹然不动。他们根本不需要修改

47
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,442
and how can they improve it?
他们还能怎么改进？

48
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:13,879
They got the best already: American Airlines in Helvetica.
他们已经是最好的了：使用Helvetica的"美国航空"

49
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,085
We always had a tendency to use very few typefaces.
我们总是倾向于使用极少数的几种字体

50
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,119
lt's not that we don't believe in type.
不是我们不信任字体

51
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,853
We believe there are not that many good typefaces.
而是我们认为好的字体实在不是很多

52
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,761
lf l want to be really generous there's a dozen,
如果我说的大方一点，那大概会有一打

53
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,956
basically l use no more than three.
但基本上我使用的不会超过3种

54
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:38,731
There are people that think that type should be expressive.
有人认为，字体应该富于表现力

55
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,033
They have a different point of view than mine.
那是他们的看法，我不这么看

56
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,172
l don't think type should be expressive at all.
我认为字体根本就不应该有表现力

57
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,338
l can write the word 'dog' with any typeface
我可以用任何字体来写这个“狗”字

58
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,507
and it doesn't have to look like a dog.
这个字并不需要看起来象一只狗

59
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,643
But there are people that think when they write 'dog' it should bark!
但就有人认为他们写的那个“狗”就应该汪汪叫（笑）!

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,421
What Helvetica is: it's a typeface that was generated
Helvetica 到底是什么？ 它是这样的一款字体:

61
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:05,486
by a desire of having better legibility.
它的诞生是为了满足人们对易读性的更高期盼

62
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,903
lt is a modern type. lt is a very clear type.
它是一种现代字体，一种非常清晰的字体

63
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,296
lt's good for everything, pretty much.
它可以很好地应用于几乎一切场合

64
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,534
You can say l love you in Helvetica.
你可以用Helvetica说“我爱你”

65
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,842
And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy.
你可以用 Helvetica 的极细体：如果你希望使你的设计非常的精致

66
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,873
Or you can say it in Extra Bold if it's really 
intensive and passionate,
或者你可以用 Helvetica 的超黑体：如果你希望表现强烈或热情的感觉

67
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:26,917
and it might work.
非常有效

68
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,055
You can also say l hate you.
你还可以说"我恨你"

69
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:37,188
l can write . . . l certainly can write a few letters in Helvetica saying that . . .
我可以写...我当然还可以用 Helvetica 写几个字母，比如说..

70
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:44,835
to Washington D.C. in particular, if l can put it that way.
"我恨你，华盛顿！"（笑），如果我可以这么说的话

71
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,701
When Helvetica came about, we were all ready for it.
Helvetica 的出现，是我们期待已久的

72
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,268
lt just had all the right connotations we were looking for,

73
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,008
for anything that had to spell out loud and clear: modern.
适用于一切必须明确传达的现代信息


74
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,752
The 1950s is an interesting period in the development of graphic design.
50年代在平面设计的发展历程中是一个有趣的时期

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,195
ln that postwar period,

在二次世界大战的恐怖和巨变之后

77
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,466
there's a real feeling of idealism among some designers, many perhaps,
一种理想主义的情感，在一些（也可能是很多）设计师当中产生

78
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,733
across the world, certainly in Europe,
然后蔓延至全世界，尤其是在欧洲

79
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:26,245
that design is part of that need to rebuild,to reconstruct,
他们认为设计本身也是需要重建和复兴的一部分

80
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:31,045

make them run more smoothly, be more democratic.

There was this real sense of social responsibility among designers.
设计师们有着强烈的社会责任感

83
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:44,931
And this is the period when the early 
experiments of the high Modernist period
这一时期，也是极端现代主义者的早期试验

84
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,891
start to be broken down, rationalized, codified,
开始解体、理性化、条理化的时期

85
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,202
you get the emergence of this so-called international typographic style
我们迎来了所谓“国际平面设计风格”

86
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,071
or Swiss style.
或者说“瑞士风格”

87
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:02,843
And it's Swiss designers in the 1950s who are really driving that along.
而50年代瑞士设计师们的推波助澜，更是将这种风潮推向极致

88
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,006
This is where Helvetica comes in.

whether it's sign systems or corporate identity

and present those visual expressions of the modern world to the public

in an intelligible, legible way.

95
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,601
So, it's underpinned, is what l'm saying
所以，我要说的是，在它背后支撑着的

96
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,336
by this great feeling shared by many designers of idealism.
是众多理想主义的设计师们所共有的这种伟大的情感


97
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,156
l'm a Modernist, you know.
我是个现代主义者，你知道的

98
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,892
l was trained in that period,

99
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,763
l lived in that period. l love Modernism.
我生活在那个时代，我爱现代主义

100
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,202
l go next week to London to see the exhibition of Modernism.
下一周我就要去伦敦，参观那里的现代主义展

101
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,740
l want it, you know.
我需要它，你知道

102
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,133
And well, that's my life.
噢，那是我的生命

103
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:44,410
l'm surrounded with furniture from that period. l can't change myself any more.
我的周围全都是那一时期的家具。我已经不能改变自己了

104
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,317
But if l see today designers, they use all typefaces-one day one typeface,
但看看今天的设计师们，他们什么字体都用，今天这种字体

105
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:54,189
the other day the other typeface, all in favor of a certain atmosphere,
明天那种字体，完全取决于当时的心情喜好

106
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,429
l'm not . . . l don't like that.
我就不是...我不喜欢这样

107
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,502
l'm always interested in clarity.

108
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,439
lt should be clear,
它应该是清楚的

109
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,341
it should be readable, it should be straightforward.
应该是可读的，也应该是直截了当的

110
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,912
So l started using, gradually, grids for my design,
所以渐渐的我开始在我的设计中使用网格

111
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,415
for my catalogues for museums.
在我为博物馆所做的一个目录设计中

112
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,815
l invented a grid, and within the grid
我发明了一种网格，在这种网格中

113
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,149
l played my game.
我可以任意发挥

114
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,514
But always along the lines of the grid,
但从不会脱离网格线

115
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,955
so that there is a certain order in it.
所以总是会有某种秩序在里面

116
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,759
That's why l use grids,
这便是我使用网格的原因

117
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,429
that's why they call me ''Gridnik.''
所以有人叫我“网格怪人”

118
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,865
For me, it's a tool of creating order,
对我而言，这是一种创造秩序的工具

119
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,702
and creating order is typography.
而所谓字体排印，就是创造秩序

120
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,802
l started late with the computer.
我很晚才开始使用电脑

l think it was in 1993 that l bought my first computer
大约在1993年我买了我的第一台电脑

and l learned myself and l can handle it now quite well
然后我开始自学，到现在已经能很自如的操纵它了

123
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,516
but not like the young people.
但还是比不上年轻人

124
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,147
l am slow with it and l can do it.
我可能比较慢，但是一样能完成

125
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,415
But l'm very much interested and
我觉得很有意思

126
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,461
l would have liked to have in the sixties the computer
我想如果在60年代我们有电脑就好了

127
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,928
because we can speed up our work, we can do it so much better,
因为这样我们的工作就可以就可以完成得更快，完成得更好

128
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:11,035
and especially all the layers you can bring into your work.
特别是当你需要在作品中使用图层的时候

129
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,842
We had the greatest problem in the sixties to bring two or three layers into the work.
在那个年代，在设计中使用2-3个图层是一个极为麻烦的事情

130
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,836
You need to do it by photograph, you did all kinds of crazy techniques
你需要求助于摄影技术，用尽一切疯狂的技巧

131
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,472
and working on a poster took us days.
做一张海报会花上我们好多天时间

132
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:31,015
And now within half an hour you have your ideas and you can make variations
而现在，不到一个半小时，你就可以有不同的创意，做出几个备选设计

133
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,689
and make a good choice.
然后选出一个最好的

134
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,352
You can't do better design with a computer,
计算机不能帮你做出更好的设计

135
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,899
but you can speed up your work enormously.
但可以极大的提升你的工作效率

136
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,730
Shall l begin?
我可以开始了吗？

137
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,064
l made these post stamps on the Stijl movement.
这是我设计的几张关于荷兰风格派运动的邮票

138
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,874
ln the beginning, if you see the sketches,
在开始的时候，你看看这些草图

139
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:55,109
l tried to use typefaces from van Doesburg,
one of the artists of the Stijl movement.
我原本打算采用来自 Van Doesburg 的字体，
Van Doesburg 是荷兰风格派运动的艺术家之一

140
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,384
Then l decided for the final designs
然而在最终稿中

141
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,616
not to use these typefaces because the
illustration is already from that period,
我决定放弃这些字体，因为插画本身已经表明了它的时代

142
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:07,454
and l used the most neutral typeface-Helvetica.
最后我用了最中性的一款字体——Helvetica

143
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:13,729
Helvetica was a real step from the nineteenth-century typefaces.
相对于19世纪的那些字体，Helvetica 是一个非常重要的突破

144
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,324
lt was a little more machined,
稍微有一点机械的味道

145
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,739
it was doing away with these manual details in it,
没有太多人工的痕迹

146
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:30,074
and we were impressed by that, because it was more neutral.
它给我们留下很深的印象，因为它更为“中性”

147
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,274
And neutralism was a word that we loved.
而中立主义，是我们喜爱的一个字眼

148
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,615
lt should be neutral;
它就应该是中立的

149
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,154
it shouldn't have a meaning in itself. lt should . . .
它本身不应该包含任何含义，它应该...

150
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:45,390
the meaning is in the content of the text, not in the typeface.
含义应该来自于文本的内容中，而非字体的表象

151
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,260
That's why we loved Helvetica very much.
这正是我们如此喜爱 Helvetica 的原因

152
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,748
l have to say that for a lot of my life
向人们解释我的职业总是要费我很多的口舌

153
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:40,151
l rather dreaded the moment of having to explain to someone...
我很害怕向别人解释我的工作

154
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,522
you know, you find yourself sitting next to some nice person on a plane
比如说，在飞机上，或是火车上，你遇到了一个很好的邻座

155
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,582
or a train and they ask you sooner or later what you do
他们总是免不了会问及你的职业

156
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,198
and if you say type designer, they generally look completely blank.
如果你说自己是一个字体设计师，通常他们的表情是一脸茫然

157
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,968
Occasionally, someone will actually know the term
不过偶尔的，会有人能真正理解这个术语

158
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,061
but then will say, ''l thought they were all dead.''
但接着他们会说：“我以为他们都过世了。”

159
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:04,135
Since l did some work for Microsoft in the mid-nineties on screen fonts,
从90年代中期开始，我为微软开发屏幕字体

160
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,473
particularly Verdana and Georgia,
主要是 Verdana 和 Georgia

161
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,373
l've had quite comical encounters with people who will say,
我有过好几次很搞笑的偶遇，他们会说

162
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,914
''Oh, you work with fonts.
“噢，你是做字体工作的

163
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,554
We just got this memo round the office
saying we've all got to start using something called Verdana.
我们的办公室到处都是那种备忘便签，
提醒我们准备要使用一种叫做 Verdana 的东西

164
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,553
Have you ever heard of it?''
你听说过这种东西吗？”

165
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:25,754
Funny conversations that never would have happened to me
thirty, forty years ago.
而在三、四十年前，我就不会遇到这样搞笑的谈话

167
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:32,401
My dad was a typographer, and although he didn't push me to follow in his footsteps
我的父亲是一个排版设计师，不过他并没有逼着我子承父业

168
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:39,867
when l left school, high school in the UK, l 
had a year to fill before going to university
那时我高中毕业，在去读大学之前我有一年的空闲

169
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,282
and l got sent as a trainee, an unpaid trainee, intern,
于是这段时间我作为一个没有薪水的实习生

170
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,217
to a type foundry in the Netherlands,
去荷兰一家造字厂实习

171
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,922
where l spent a year learning what turned
out to be a completely obsolete trade
在那里，我花了整整一年的时间，
去学习一种后来证明完全被废弃的手艺：

172
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,057
of making type by hand.
手工造字

173
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:57,085
lt was a matter of cutting letters in steel, engraving them at actual size.
每天做的就是切割钢铁的字模，按实际尺寸雕刻

174
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:03,265
You know, l doubt if l ever got up quite to one letter a day at that time.
我怀疑，我那时即便竭尽全力也无法在一天内完成一个字母

175
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,773
So, you know, l could say that really l've made type by practically all the means
所以我可以说，我已经亲身经历了所有的造字方式

176
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,539
it's ever been made in the fifty, fifty-one years that l've been working.
——在我干这一行的50、51年里所有的造字方式

177
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,075
lt's hard to generalize about the way type designers work.
很难用一两句话说明字体设计师的工作方式

178
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,883
There isn't a generality of us.
我们的工作方法不尽相同

179
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:22,087
But l think that most type designers if they were sitting in this chair
但是我想从事这一行的大多数字体设计师

180
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,386
would essentially start in much the same way.
大体上来说都是这样开始的

181
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,394
l'd probably start with a lowercase h.
我通常会从一个小写的 h 开始

182
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,164
it tells me, first of all, whether this is a sans serif or a serif typeface.
它会告诉我们一些信息，首先，这是一个“衬线”还是“无衬线”字体

183
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,534
lf it were a serif face it would look like this
如果是一个“衬线字体”，它应该是这样的

184
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,003
here are the serifs so called, these little feet
这就是所谓的“衬线”，这些小小的“脚”

185
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,370
on the bottom and top of the principal strokes of the letter.
在字母主干笔画的底部和顶部

186
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,871
Are they heavy, are they light, what is the nature of the serif,
它是粗体吗，还是一个细体，这种衬线体有什么特性

187
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,380
is there a lot of thick-thin contrast in the letter form;
在外形上是否有着粗细的对比

188
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:55,788
what are the proportions of the overall height, the ascender, so-called of the h,
总体的高度比例如何，h 的“上升部”占多少

189
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,813
and the x-height part of it,
它的“ x-高度”占多少

190
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,993
Then because an h is a straight-sided letter,
然后由于 h 是一个直线边的字母

191
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,485
l would then do a round letter like an o along side it.
我会做一个圆形的字母，比如说一个 o，放在它旁边

192
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:12,101
l can get a sense of how the weight of the curved part of the o 
relates to the straight part of the h.
我就可以直观的比较，这个 o 的曲线部分的“重量”
是否能匹配这个 h 的直线部分

193
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:17,473
And already there is a huge amount of DNA is just a couple of letterforms like that.
仅仅是这样简单的一对字母，就携带着大量决定这套字体外形的“基因”

194
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,839
l'd then probably do something like a lowercase p
然后我可能会做一个小写的 p

195
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,343
because it's half straight and half round;
因为它一半是直边，一半是圆形的

196
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,448
and also it has a descending stroke,
同时，它还有一个“下降笔画”

197
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,587
which is another vertical dimension that l
would be interested in establishing.
这是我想要确立的另外一个“垂直维度”

198
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,389
Then l would then build on that.
然后我就以此为依据，接着往下做

199
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,391
lf you've got an h you've got an awful lot of information
如果你有了一个 h，你就已经拥有了极其丰富的信息

200
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,188
about m, n, and u in the lower case.
足以建立这些小写的 m、n、和 u 

201
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,528
lf you've got a p you've got q and b and d and so on.
如果你有了一个 p，就等于有了一个 q 和 b 还有 d，等等，依此类推


202
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,468
And then just as soon as possible l would get them into words
然后，我会尽早的把它们匹配成单词

203
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,436
or something that looked like words
或是让它们看起来象单词

204
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:51,032
because for me the experience of reading
something is so critical in judging it as a typeface
因为如果要评判一款字体，它的阅读体验是至关重要的

205
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:56,045
because l find that is the acid test of how a typeface performs.
我认为这是评价一款字体性能表现的“酸性测试”

206
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,558
One of the most characteristic and to my
mind beautiful things about Helvetica
就我而言，Helvetica 最迷人的特质之一

207
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,257
is these horizontal terminals, you see in the lower case a and c and e and g.
就是它水平的收尾，你可以在小写的 a、c、e 和 g 中看到

208
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,629
The whole structure is based on this horizontal slicing off of the terminals.
正是末端的这种水平切削决定了字体的整个结构走向

209
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,440
It's very hard for a designer to look at these characters and say,
一个字体设计师看到这些字符，禁不住要问自己：

210
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,676
how would l improve them? How would l make them any different?
我还能怎样改进它们？我还能怎样让它们有所不同？

211
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,667
They just seem to be exactly right.
它们看上去是那样的完美

212
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,271
l'm glad no one asked me to
我很庆幸没人找我去...

213
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,017
second-guess Helvetica
...改进 Helvetica

214
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,485
because l wouldn't know what to do.
因为我实在不知道该怎样做

215
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,714
This is the original type specimen of Helvetica
这是 Helvetica 最原始的样稿

216
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,352
before it was Helvetica. lt had its original name, Die Neue Haas Grotesk.
在它成为 Helvetica 之前， 它还有一个原始名称，Die Neue Haas Grotesk 

217
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,395
The whole story of how Helvetica came into being
Helvetica 诞生的整个故事

218
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,091
is not entirely clear, at least to me.
并不是很清晰的，至少对我而言

219
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,171
lt is said, and l think it's true,
据说，不过我确信是事实

220
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,767
that Eduard Hoffmann, who had been the boss at Haas type foundry,
Eduard Hoffmann ，Haas 铸字厂当时的老板

221
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:02,548
wished to make a modernized version of Akzidenz Grotesk,
他想为 Akzidenz Grotesk 这款字体做一个现代的版本

222
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,984
which was essentially a traditional nineteenth-century German sans serif,
那是一款传统的19世纪德国无衬线字体

223
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,489
and his method of doing that was sort of to clean it up and so on.
他的想法是让它的外形更简炼一些...之类的

224
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,159
And it was of course Max Miedinger who made the drawings for Helvetica.
当然，最后是 Max Miedinger 动手绘制了 Helvetica 的图样

225
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,823
l received the impression from people l knew back in the sixties and seventies
我记得我在六、七十年代认识的一些人这么说过

226
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:24,770
that Hoffmann's part in this was a very much more significant one
当年 Hoffmann 在其中担负的角色其实是相当重要的

227
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,441
than you might just assume by reading in a textbook
并非象你在那些教科书中看到的那么简单：

228
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,807
that Max Miedinger was the designer of Helvetica.
——“Helvetica，由 Max Miedinger 设计...”

229
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:05,077
You can easily say this was a joint product
我们其实可以说这个项目...

230
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,615
of both Miedinger and my father.
...是 Miedinger 和我父亲共同完成的

231
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:13,574
Miedinger couldn't produce a typeface alone;
Miedinger 无法单独完成一个字体的设计

232
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,021
neither could my father.
我父亲也不行

233
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:21,516
But when both were working hard together then something good resulted.
但如果是两个人在一起共同努力，就能够有所成就

234
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:33,537
Here are the first trials of Neue Haas Grotesk,
这就是当年的第一个测试版本：Neue Haas Grotesk

235
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,302
which was the first name of Helvetica.
这才是 Helvetica 的原名

236
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,881
l knew the way things worked at Haas
我熟悉Haas 铸字厂的工作流程

237
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,341
and l had gradually picked up on the importance of Eduard Hoffman,
所以我逐渐发现了 Eduard Hoffmann 在其中发挥的重要作用

238
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,153
and his almost pathological shyness
由于他那种几乎是病态的羞怯

239
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:58,821
and the way that he would use other people's hands.
他喜欢借助他人之手来进行工作

240
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,863
But boy could you see his mind at work on the faces
但上帝，你仍然能从这些字体工作中看出

241
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,229 
where he was deeply involved.
这里面浸透着他的心血

242
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,473
You have here a note by Eduard Hoffmann
这是他当年的一张便条

243
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,979
indicating all the desired corrections.
显示的都是他的修改建议

244
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,082
''The capital Y is too slim.
“大写 Y 太过纤细”

245
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,779
The capital A is also too slim.''
“大写 A 也是过细”


246
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:29,127
When you talk about the design of Haas Neue Grotesk or Helvetica,
当我们谈论 Haas Neue Grotesk 或者说 Helvetica 的设计的时候

247
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:36,768
what it's all about is the interrelationship of the negative shape
我们实际上谈论的是它们与其“负形”之间的相互关系

248
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,137
the figure-ground relationship,
实体与空间之间的关系

249
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,732
the shapes between characters and within characters,
字体内部，以及字体之间的空间形态

250
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,369
with the black if you like, with the inked surface.
以及黑色部分，如果你喜欢这样称呼的话；和过墨的部分

251
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,948
And the Swiss pay more attention to the background,
而瑞士人更关注于字体的负形

252
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:56,012
so that the counters and the space
between characters just hold the letters.
所以字谷与字形间的空间就把整个字母固定住了

253
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,857
l mean you can't imagine anything moving;
你看不出丝毫的“松动”

254
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,293
it is so firm.
它就是如此的“结实”

255
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,229
lt's not a letter that's bent to shape;
这不是一套弯曲成形的字体

256
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:11,101
it's a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of surrounding space.
每一个字母实际上是存在于一个强有力的矩阵所包围着的空间

257
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,330
lt's . . . oh it's brilliant when it's done well.
这实在是... 太出色了，当所有的一切完成之后

258
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,578
My father had clear ideas
我父亲对于这个字体应该呈现怎样的面貌

259
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,147
how the typeface should look.
有着很清晰的想法

260
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:28,017
So my father and Miedinger sat together,
and he started drawing.
所以我父亲和 Miedinger 坐在一起，然后他开始绘图

261
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,385
Here you have a proof of an alphabet
这里有一份字体的小样

262
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,983
with observations by Max Miedinger.
根据 Max Miedinger 的陈述

263
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,464
When Miedinger worked for Haas he did
not work as a designer.
当 Miedinger 在Haas 工作的时候，他实际的工作其实并不是一个设计师

264
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,166
He was actually a salesman.
他实际上是一个销售员

265
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,068
His job was to travel around Switzerland
他的工作就是周游瑞士

266
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,332
taking orders for fonts of type.
招揽字体的订单

267
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,399
By profession he was a graphic artist,
从专业上来说，他是一个平面设计师

268
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:53,376
but he realized that he could make more
money by selling foundry type.
但是他意识到，卖字体能让他赚更多的钱

269
00:21:54,246 --> 00:22:04,022
But my father said, lf ever l have an idea of
a new typeface, l'm sure that you could design it.
但是我父亲说过，“每当我对新字体有什么想法的时候，
我都很确信你一定可以把它设计出来。”

270
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:09,153
l have here a type specimen book
我这里有一份字体样册

271
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:13,398
of both type foundries, Stempel and Haas.
是关于两家字体公司的， Stempel 和 Haas 

272
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:20,895
You have to know that Haas was
controlled by the German type foundry Stempel.
你要知道，Haas  是受德国字体公司 Stempel 控制的

273
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:28,479
And in turn Stempel was also controlled by Linotype.
而之后 Stempel 又被 Linotype 收购

274
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,527
Now we go down to the cellar and see in
our archives where we can find Helvetica.
下面让我们到地下室去看看能否找到什么关于 Helvetica 的档案

275
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,715
Here we have number 24.
我们要找的是...24号

276
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:14,382
And there it is, the Helvetica drawings.
在这里，Helvetica 的画稿

277
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:20,825
The marketing director at Stempel had the
idea to give it a better name
Stempel 的市场总监希望有一个更好的名字

278
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:27,595
because Neue Haas Grotesk didn't sound very good for a
因为 Neue Haas Grotesk (意为：Haas 的新怪物)

279
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:32,403
typeface that was intended to be sold in the United States.
对于一款要销往美国的字体，这样一个名字听起来并不是很好

280
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:39,280
Stempel suggested the name of Helvetia.
Stempel 建议用 Helvetia 这个名字

281
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:45,016
This is very important: Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland.
这一点非常重要：Helvetia 是瑞士的拉丁语名称

282
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,560
My father said, That's impossible.
我父亲说，这不可能

283
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,625
You cannot call a typeface after the name of a country.
你不能用一个国家的名字来称呼一个字体

284
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,461
So he said, why don't you call it Helvetica.
所以他说，你们为什么不叫它 Helvetica（Helvetia的形容词）？

285
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,173
So in other words this would be the Swiss typeface.
所以，换种说法，这个字体将是“瑞士的”字体

286
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,439
And they agreed.
然后他们同意了

287
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,850
l think Helvetica was a perfect name at the time.
我认为Helvetica在当时是一个完美的名字

288
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:18,748
Swiss typography at that time also was well-known worldwide.
瑞士字体排印设计在当时也是闻名于世

290
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,959
So it was the best solution for Helvetica
所以 Helvetica 是这个字体命名的最佳方案

291
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,488
to get into the market.
它顺利进入市场

292
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:28,322
Once we'd introduced Helvetica, it really ran away.
Helvetica 一经推出，便势不可挡

293
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:33,862
lt was exactly what the designers were looking for.
它无疑是当时的设计师们期盼已久的

294
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,309
l mean, l don't think there's been such a hot thing since
我的意思是，它的成功是空前绝后的

295
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:43,270
as the figure-ground relationship properly executed
由于字体的正负形关系得到了良好的处理

296
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:49,154
and it was. . . oh, just a landslide waiting to 
go down the mountain.
它就好像...哦，一次即将爆发的山体滑坡

297
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,452
And away it went.
一发而不可收

298
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,085
l imagine there was a time when it just felt so good
我可以想像，当时这个字体给人的感觉真是太美妙了

299
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:25,853
to take something that was old and dusty
and homemade and crappy looking
将那些陈旧、邋遢、粗糙、丑陋的字体

300
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,293
and replace it with Helvetica.
全部换成 Helvetica 

301
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:34,198
lt just must have felt like you were scraping
the crud off of like filthy old things
就好像你把那些脏旧东西外面的污秽剥离掉

302
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,135
and restoring them to shining beauty. And in fact
让它们焕然一新。实际上

303
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:41,973
corporate identity in the sixties, that's what
it sort of consisted of.
六十年代的企业识别系统，大多由那些东西构成

304
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:49,812
Clients would come in and they'd have
piles of goofy old brochures from the fifties
来找你的客户往往带着成堆五十年代那些土气的企宣手册

305
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,040
that hide like shapes on them and goofy bad photographs.
上面有各种奇怪的形状，蠢笨难看的照片

306
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,622
They'd have some letterhead that would
say Amalgamated Widget on the top
他们有一些信头上可能写着 "联合制品" 

307
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,716
in some goofy, maybe a script typeface,
above Amalgamated Widget
用着某种傻气的字体，也可能是一个手写体。在 "联合制品" 之上

308
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,162
it would have an engraving showing their headquarters
会有一个描绘他们在 衣阿华州 Paducah 总部形象的

309
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,360
in Paducah, lowa, with smokestacks belching smoke
...版画图案，旁边是冒着黑烟的烟囱

310
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:13,738
you know, and then you go to a corporate
identity consultant circa 1965, 1966,
你知道，如果在1965、1966年左右，你走进一家企业形象咨询事务所

311
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,475
and they would take that and lay it here
and say, Here's your current stationery,
他们会把那些东西摊在那里然后说，这是你们现在的信封信笺

312
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,278
and all it implies, and this is what we're proposing.
然后，这是我们提议的方案

313
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,475
And next to that, next to the belching smokestacks and
在它旁边，是那冒烟的烟囱

314
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,382
the nuptial script and the ivory paper,
在婚礼字体和象牙色纸张旁边

315
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,615
they'd have a crisp bright white piece of paper
是挺括而雪亮的纸张

316
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,459
and instead of Amalgamated Widget, founded 1 857,
再没有那些 “联合制品, 始于 1857”

317
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:38,463
it just would say Widgco, in Helvetica Medium
仅仅用 Helvetica 标准体写着 Widgco

318
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,932
Can you imagine how bracing and thrilling that was?
你能想像那是多么令人振奋和激动？

319
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,735
That must have seemed like you'd crawled through a desert
就如同你刚爬出一片沙漠

320
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,538
with your mouth just caked with filthy dust
满嘴都是肮脏的沙尘

321
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,976
and then someone is offering you a clear,
refreshing, distilled, icy glass of water
然后这时有人给你递上一杯清澈见底的、令人精神一振的，冰镇的纯水

322
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:57,816
to clear away all this horrible, kind of like, burden of history.
让你把所有的不快、历史的包袱全都抛之脑后

323
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,019
lt must have been just fantastic. And you
know it must have been fantastic
那绝对是妙极了，你知道那绝对是妙极了

324
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,011
because it was done over and over and over again.
因为这样的事会接二连三连四的发生

325
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:11,490
So this is what l'm talking about, this is Life Magazine 1 953.
这就是我前面所说的：1953年的生活杂志

326
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:18,898
One ad after another in here, that just kind of shows every 
single visual bad habit that was endemic in those days.
一个又一个的广告，毫无例外的重复着那一时期特有的
视觉设计上的陋习

327
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,907
You've got zany hand lettering everywhere,
到处都是小丑般的手写美术字

328
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,240
swash typography to signify elegance,
用花体字来显示优雅

329
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,077
exclamation points, exclamation points,
exclamation points.
惊叹号、惊叹号、惊叹号

330
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,817
Cursive wedding invitation typography
down here reading,
这里用婚礼请柬的花饰字体和版式写着

331
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,183
''Almost everyone appreciates the best.''
"几乎每个人都会赏鉴至美。”

332
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,757
This was everywhere in the Fifties, this is
how everything looked in the Fifties.
这就是五十年代的视觉环境，那个时代的一切东西都这个模样

333
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:43,895

full swing - same product.
我们再看看同样的商品，这时候 Helvetica 已经开始大显身手

334

No people, no smiling fakery,

just a beautiful big glass of ice-cold Coke.

00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,528
The slogan underneath: lt's the Real Thing,

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,852
Governments and corporations love Helvetica
政府和企业喜欢 Helvetica

344
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,946
because on one hand it makes them seem neutral and efficient,
因为一方面它令他们看上去中立和有效率

345
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:17,125
but also the smoothness of the letters
makes them seem almost human.
柔和的字形也让他们看起来更人性化

346
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,256
That is a quality they all want to convey
这一直是他们试图传达的质素

347
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,435
because of course they have the image they are always fighting
因为他们一直想改变他们的形象：

348
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,638
that they are authoritarian they're bureaucratic,
独断、官僚、

349

you lose yourself in them, they're oppressive.

350

So instead, by using Helvetica

and governments are supposed to be today.

accountable or transparent
现在他们可以不必真的亲切、可靠、透明

355
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,192
but they can look that way.

现代人希望显得简洁、正式、高效

359
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:37,968
Designers, and l think even readers, invest
so much of the surroundings in the typeface.
设计师们，我想甚至是读者们，为这款字体赋予了种种外在的含义

360
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,577
American Apparel uses Helvetica and it looks cheeky.

362
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,719
And it's not just a matter of the weight they
use and the letter spacing and the colors.
这不仅仅因为他们所使用的字重，字距，和颜色

363
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,883
There's something about the typeface l think 
really invites this sort of open interpretation.
还因为字体本身就支持开放性的释读

364
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,929
l suppose you could say the typefaces are either

those that are fully open to interpretation

367
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,738
A typeface made of icicles or candy canes
or something just says one thing.
一款由冰柱或棒棒糖之类玩意构成的字体只表达一种意思


368
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,872
And Helvetica maybe says everything.
而 Helvetica 却可以表达一切

369
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,806
And that's perhaps part of its appeal.
或许这就是它的魅力之一

370
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,381
Typography has this real poverty of terms to describe things.
文字设计中非常缺乏可用于描述字体特性的术语

371
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,184
Beyond x height and cap height and weight and so on.
仅有的就是 x高度，字高，字重之类

372
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,519
I find when Tobias and I work on projects together
当 Tobias 和我在一起合作项目时

373
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,647
we tend to use a lot of qualitative terms that are entirely subjective.
我们喜欢用很多很主观的词汇来描述字体的特性

374
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:28,159
Working on the typeface for Esquire years ago, I remember us saying,
在几年前为 《君子杂志》 制作字体时，我记得我们曾说

375
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,765
I remember my saying, No this has that Saturn 5 rocket early NASA quality.
我记得我说，不，这是土星5号时期美国航天局的感觉

376
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:38,870
lt needs to have that orange plastic Olivetti
typewriter, Roman Holiday espresso feeling.
它应该是那种橘色塑料的好利获得打字机，罗马假日浓缩咖啡的感觉

377
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,472
I know you got exactly what I was saying. -I did. -
我知道你完全理解我所说的。对

378
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:47,912
But it's that there's really no way to describe the qualitative parts
of a typeface without resorting to things are fully outside it.
如果不借助于外在的事物，我们就很难描述字体的特性

380
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:52,050
And we're constantly saying, You know,
this has that, it feels kind of Erik Satie;
我们一直在说，“你知道，这有点 Erik Satie（19世纪法国作曲家）的感觉

381
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,384
it needs to be Debussy.
它应该是德彪西那样的感觉

382
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,716
Or this has a kind of belt and suspenders look.
或者，这看上去有点象背带裤

383
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,689
lt needs to be, you know, much more elegant. . . hand-lasted shoe.
它应该，嗯，更优雅一点...手工做的鞋一样的感觉

384
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,896
l've been collecting these signs for a couple of years now
我已经收集这些标牌好些年了

385
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:14,239
and one of my favorites is these signs. l have a number of these.
我最喜欢的是这些标牌，这样的我有好多

386
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,674
This is what the street signs in New York City used to look like.
这就是纽约城街道上的标牌以前的样子

387
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,078
This actually functions so much more clearly
它实际上看起来更清晰

388
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,105
and so much more effectively than what we
see out on the street now.
比我们现在在街上看到的要更有效

389
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,485
The sort of classical modernist line on
现代主义的“经典理论”认为

390
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,155
how aware a reader should be of a typeface
一个读者对待字体的方式应该是：

391
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,191
is that they shouldn't be aware of it at all.
读者根本不应该意识到字体的存在

392
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,360
lt should be this crystal goblet
它应该像一个水晶的高脚杯

393
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,964
there to just hold and display and organize
只是放置，展示和组织信息的一个容器

394
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:46,638
the information. But I don't think it's really quite as simple as that.
但我想实际情况并没有那么简单

395
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,540
I think even if they're not consciously
我想即使他们在阅读时没有意识到字体的存在

396
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:55,013
aware of the typeface they're reading,
they'll certainly be affected by it.
他们还是会受到字体的影响

397
00:31:55,013 --> 00:32:00,417
The same way that an actor that's miscast
in a role will affect someone's experience
就像安排不适当的演员在剧中演出会影响观众的观看体验

398
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,855
of a movie or play that they're watching.
They'll still follow the plot,
当然他们一样能看明白电影或戏剧的情节

399
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:08,724
but, you know, be less convinced or excited or affected.
但是，你知道，他们会更难于相信、激动、或感动

400
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,963
I think that typography is similar to that,
我认为文字设计的情形与之类似

401
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:18,732
where the designer choosing typefaces is
essentially a casting director.
设计师挑选字体实质上就像是一个导演在挑选角色

402
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,174
There's very little type in my world outside of work.
在我的世界里，很少有不能使用的字体

403
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:28,346
Like everybody else I'm aware of fonts
being used in my environment.
和其他人一样，我发觉字体在我们周围无处不在

404
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,349
You know, the standing joke that graphic
designers can't see historical movies
你知道，有人嘲笑说平面设计师不能看历史题材的影片

405
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,544
because the fonts are always wrong is certainly true.
因为里面的字体使用经常是错误的，这个笑话其实是真实的

406
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,486
lt definitely makes the world outside the office very different.
外面的世界和工作室内真的很不一样

407
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:43,895
My fiancÈ and I were trying to remember the location of a restaurant
有一次，我和未婚妻想要记住我们家附近一个饭店的位置

408
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:48,764
in our neighborhood, and she remembered it as that new place
她记的是那家饭店

409
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,469
that's just a couple blocks down from the dry cleaner.
...离干洗店有几个街区

410
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,105
I remembered it as that new place just a couple blocks down from
而我记的是

411
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:56,471
the place with the bad letter spacing out front.
它离那个字间距很糟糕的路牌有几个街区

412
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,678
Nobody doesn't know what Helvetica is,
没有人不知道 Helvetica 是什么

413
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:04,148
I mean, at the beginning of our careers
certainly before anybody had a PC or a Mac,
我的意思是，在我职业生涯开始的时候，当然那时候连 PC 或苹果机都还没有出现

414
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,950
no one knew what fonts were.
没有人知道字体是什么

415
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,441
I think even then people might have known what Helvetica was.
但我想即使在那时人们也知道什么是 Helvetica

416
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,657
The fact that it's been so heavily licensed
它能够获得如此广泛的授权

417
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,827
and made available through these very populist technologies
以一种如此平民化的技术形式面向大众

418
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,321
has kind of furthered the mythology that it's 
the ultimate typeface in some way.
也说明了，在某种程度上它作为终极字体的神话还将延续下去

419
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,566
And even for us professionals that's hard to escape from.
即便是在我们这些专业人士圈内，也无可避免

420
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,136
I kind of find myself buying into the idea
我发现自己开始有些相信这个说法：

421
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,205
that ''Oh, the sans serif evolved for a hundred years
“哦，无衬线字体的百年演变

422
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,474
and the ultimate expression was Helvetica.''
其终极表现就是 Helvetica。”

423
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,841
And realizing, wait a minute that's not quite true, historically
然后意识到，等一下，这好像不太对，无论从历史上

424
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,780
or aesthetically or culturally or politically.
美学上，文化上，还是政治上都说不过去

425
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,618
But there's something about it that does have the feeling of finality to it,
但是它确实给人一种“无衬线字体的最终形式”的感觉

426
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:44,655
This is the conclusion of one line of reasoning with this typeface,
这是我对这款字体理解的一个总结

427
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:49,217
and perhaps everything after it is secondary in some way.
任何在它之后的东西，在某些意义上来说可能永远只能是第二

428
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:35,027
I'm obviously a typomaniac, which is an incurable, if not mortal, disease.
我绝对是一个字体狂热者，一种不治之症，如果它不是致命的


429
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,469
I can't explain it I just love, I just like looking at type,
我不能解释这些，我只是喜欢，我就是喜欢看着这些字体

430
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,801
I just get a total kick out of it. They are my friends.
我从中获得了太多的乐趣。它们是我的朋友

431
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:45,376
Other people look at bottles of wine or whatever, or girls' bottoms,
其他人喜欢看瓶中的美酒或女孩的臀部

432
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,707
I get kicks out of looking at type.
我从看字体中享受乐趣

433
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,076
lt's a little worrying I must admit, it's a very nerdish thing to do.
是有点烦人，我必须承认，这样子做是很书呆子气的

434
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,078
I'm very much a word person.
我是一个非常多话的人

435
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,952
So that's why typography for me is the obvious extension.
所以字体设计对我来说很明显是一种延伸

436
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,715
lt just makes my words visible.
它使我的话语变得可见

437
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,492
A real typeface needs rhythm, needs contrast; it comes from handwriting.
一款真正的字体需要韵律，需要对比，字体来源于于书写

438
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,594
That's why I can read your handwriting, and you can read mine.
这就是我可以读懂你写的字，你可以读懂我的的原因

439
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,863
And I'm sure our handwriting is miles away from Helvetica
我很清楚我们的书写与 Helvetica 

440
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,899
or anything that would be considered legible.
或其他任何可以清晰辨认的字有很大的差别

441
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,501
But we can read it because there's a rhythm to it, there's a contrast to it.
我们可以读它是因为它富有韵律，在它其中存在着对比

442
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,936
Helvetica hasn't got any of that.
上述这些东西 Helvetica 丝毫没有

443
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,372
|Why is it fifty years later still so popular?|
（为什么它在五十年后仍旧如此流行？）

444
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,679
I don't know. What is bad taste ubiquitous?
我不知道。为什么糟糕的品位无处不在？

445
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,341
No, actually, Helvetica was a good typeface at the time.
不，实际上，Helvetica在当时是一款好的字体

446
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,118
lt really answered a demand.
它确实适应了当时的需求

447
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,620
But now it's become one of those defaults that,
但是现在它成为了一种默认选择

448
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,488
partly because of the proliferation of the 
computer, which is now twenty years,
部分是因为电脑的发展，到现在已经20年了

449
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,459
the PC I mean,
我所指的是 PC

450
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,298
it was the default on the Apple Macintosh
and then it became the default on Windows
它在苹果机上是默认字体，然后成为 Windows 系统上的

451
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,633
which copied everything that Apple did, as you know.
Windows 拷贝了苹果机的一切，就像你所知道的那样

452
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:46,537
lnterface and everything else, and then they did the clone version, Arial,
从界面到其他所有的一切，然后他们制作了一个克隆版本，Arial

453
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,940
which is worse than Helvetica but
比 Helvetica 还烂

454
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,677
fills the same purpose I think. Now it's probably never going to go away
但达到了同样的目的。现在它很可能再也不会消失了

455
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:57,341
because it's ubiquitous; it's a default. lt's air,
因为它无处不在，它是默认项，它是空气

456
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,509
you know, it's just there. There's no choice.
你知道，它已经成为现实，让我们别无选择

457
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,019
You have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica.
你必须要呼吸，所以你必须要使用 Helvetica

458
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,056
lt brings style with it; every typeface does.
它有自己的风格，其他字体也是如此

459
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,191
lt has a certain,
它有某种...

460
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,294
well, it's like a person, if you are slightly heavy in the middle
就像一个人，如果你腰腹比较粗

461
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,630
you're not going to walk around in tight T-shirts. You'd look like an idiot.
你就不会穿着紧身T恤到处走。你看上去会像个白痴

462
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,966
And Helvetica is heavy in the middle. So it has a certain,
Heletica 也有它的缺陷。所以它需要某种... 

463
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,535
it needs certain space around it, needs a lot of white space;
它的周围需要留有空间，需要很多的空白

464
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,505
it needs very carefully to be looked at the weight gradations.
在磅数的选择上需要非常的谨慎

465
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,474
lt needs a lot of space sideways also.
它的两边也需要许多空间

466
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,010
Then it's very legible, but
然后它就变得能清晰易读，但是

467
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,380
very small and very tightly done and very lightly as modern designers do,
如果给它设置很小的字号，或是很紧凑的间距，
或者像现代设计师把它设置得极度纤细

468
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,082
it's a nightmare, a total nightmare.
那就是一场噩梦，完全是一场噩梦

469
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,845
I wouldn't say this if I hadn't tried it.
如果我没有尝试过，我不会这样说

470
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,854
Because all the letters . . . it's the whole Swiss ideology;
因为它所有的字母...完全是瑞士的理念

471
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,557
the guy who designed it tried to make all the letters look the same.
设计它的人想把每个字母设计成一模一样

472
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,694
Hello??? You know, that's called an army. That's not people.
Hello? 你知道，那叫做军队。那不是人的所为

473
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,730
That's people having the same fucking helmet on.
那是一群戴着一模一样的头盔的人

474
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,132
lt doesn't further individualism.
它不鼓励任何的个人主义

475
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,502
And the aim with type design always is to make it individual enough
然而字体设计的目标总是把字体变得足够的个性化

476
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,737
so that it's interesting,
这样它才是有趣的

477
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,407
but of course ninety-five percent of any
alphabet has to look like the other alphabet
当然任何字体 95% 的部分必须和其他字体看上去一样

478
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,897
otherwise you wouldn't be able to read it.
否则你就没法读懂它

479
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,583
l've never sort of woken up with a typeface coming out,
我从未睡一觉醒来然后想出一款新的字体

480
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,386
you know, like some people . . . l've got to do this, and they go to their,
你知道，像某些人那样...”我不得不这样做”，然后走到他们的...

481
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,082
whatever, their easel, and these amazing brush strokes.
随便什么，比如画板前，画出那些神奇的笔划

482
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,856
I don't have that urge.
我没有那种冲动

483
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,983
You know, I wake up and usually I want to go back to sleep.
你知道，我醒来的时候还经常想回去睡

484
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,155
I mean, everybody puts their history into their work.
我的意思是，每个人都在作品中体现自己的个人经历

485
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,134
I certainly know that when I draw something it has
我很清楚我在画东西的时候

486
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,470
I'm fast, I'm loud, I'm chaotic,
我很快，我很吵，我乱来一气

487
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,909
I'm not very rule based, even though I'm German and I love rules,
我不太按规则办事，虽然我是德国人并且我喜爱规则

488
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:37,281
I'm a Gemini, I had my birthday yesterday, so I'm all over the place essentially.
我是一个双子座的人，昨天刚过完我的生日，
所以本质上我是一个毫无章法的人

489
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,251
I'm always on time, but a year late, you know what I mean,
我永远守时，但那是在一年之后，你知道我的意思

490
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,520
but then I'm on the second.
但那时我就是分秒必争了

491
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,091
So I have this horrible thing, which comes out in my typefaces.
所以在我设计的字体里面会出现那些可怕的东西

492
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,593
They're never perfect. They always have a little edge
它们从不会是完美的。它们总有些缺陷

493
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,255
in the sense that I leave them alone when l get bored with them.
因为当我厌倦它们的时候我就把它们丢在一边

494
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,923
I know there's people who hate me, who
would never use one of my typefaces in a million years
我知道有些人恨我，他们再过一百万年也不会用我的字体

495
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,737
and vice versa, people who would use any typeface I design
但反过来，有些人会用我设计的每一款字体

496
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,273
not because it's good for them or it fits the purpose,
不是因为它们很好，或者因为它们能满足某种需求

497
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,241
simply because I did it.
仅仅因为是我设计了它们

498
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,978
I think we alI do that. Certain bands I buy every CD from them;
我认为我们都是这样的。有一个乐队，我买他们所有的CD

499
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,313
some of them are crap.
其中有些很烂

500
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,748
But I buy it because l've always bought their CDs
但我买它，因为我总是买他们的CD

501
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:10,781
lch habe sie immer gekauft,
我总是买它们（德语）

502
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,975
or their music.
或者他们的音乐

503
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,982
Why do people buy certain things? The brand rubs off on them.
为什么人们固定地购买某些东西？品牌消减了人们的选择面

504
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,590
And typefaces are a brand.
字体也是一个品牌

505
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:24,527
You're telling an audience, This is for you, 
by using a certain typographic voice.
你用一种特定的"字体排印的声音"告诉"听众"，这是属于你们的

506
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,599
You'd recognize a Marlboro brand two miles away
你在2英里之外就能认出万宝路的广告牌

507
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,334
because they use a typeface that they only use
因为他们至始至终只用一种字体

508
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:34,472
You can buy it; I have it; anyone can, it's called Neo Contact. Anybody can buy it,
你可以购买它，我都有，任何人都可以买到，这个字体叫 Neo Contact

509
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,340
but Marlboro have made the typeface theirs.
万宝路把这个字体变成了他们的专有字体

510
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,143
You can recognize any Marlboro ad from miles away
你可以在几里之外就可以认出任何万宝路的广告

511
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,168
because of that stupid typeface.
就因为那个愚蠢的字体

512
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,237
lf they'd used Helvetica. . . Hello??? lt wouldn't quite work.
但假如他们用的是Helvetica . . . 喂？？？恐怕就不太灵了

513
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,810
The way something is presented will define the way you react to it.
某样东西的展示方式将影响人们对它的反应

514
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:27,847
So you can take the same message and present it in three different typefaces,
所以你可以用三种不同的字体来传达同一个信息

515
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:33,030
and the response to that, the immediate emotional response will be different.
而人们的反应——看到的那一瞬间的情感反应，也会有所不同

516
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,268
And the choice of typeface is the prime weapon,
而字体在这种传达之中，是一种终极武器

517
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,635
if you want, in that communication.
只要你想要

518
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:48,379
And I say weapon largely because with
commercial marketing and advertising,
我说字体是商业广告和市场中的武器，是因为

519
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:54,051
the way a message is dressed is going to
define our reaction to that message in the advertising.
广告中信息的传递方式将直接决定我们对它的反应

520
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,588
So if it says, buy these jeans, and it's a grunge font,
如果用一种垃圾风格的字体说，"买这条牛仔裤吧"

521
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:02,460
you would expect it to be some kind of ripped jeans
你一定觉得那是一条满是划痕和撕裂的裤子

522
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,565
or to be sold in some kind of underground clothing store.
或者是地下服饰店才会有的东西

523
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,135
lf you see that same message in Helvetica,
但如果相同的信息用 Helvetica 表现出来

524
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,637
you know, it's probably on sale at Gap.
你会觉得，那可能是一条GAP牌的牛仔裤

525
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,731
You know it's going to be clean, that you're
going to fit in, you're not going to stand out.
你知道那裤子会很干净，很贴身，穿上去也不显眼

526
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,978
All of us, I would suggest, are prompted in subliminal ways.
任何人，我认为，都是受下意识驱使的

527
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:30,521
Maybe the feeling you have when you see a particular 
typographic choices used on a piece of packaging,
也许当你看到某个包装上的字体时，会心有所动：

528
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:34,558
is just, I like the look of that, that feels good, that's my kind of product.
我喜欢那个样子，感觉不错，那就是我想要的产品

529
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,654
But that's the type casting its secret spell.
但那正是字体的神秘咒语在发挥它的威力

530
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:55,141
ln a way, Helvetica is a club. lt's a mark of membership;
从某种角度说，Helvetica 就是一个俱乐部，一种会员资格的标记

531
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,315
it's a badge that says we're part of modern society,
它是一个徽章，昭示则我们是现代社会的一分子

532
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,852
we share the same ideals.
我们有着共同的理想

533
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,482
lt's well-rounded, it's not going to be damaging or dangerous.
它方圆周正，不会给人带来破坏和危险的感觉

534
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:14,056
Helvetica has almost like a perfect balance of push and pull in its letters,
Helvetica 的字母中有着一种近乎完美的收与放的平衡

535
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:18,197
and that perfect balance sort of is saying to us,
那种完美的平衡似乎在对我们说

536
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,328
well not sort of, it is saying to us,
很明显的，它在对我们说：

537
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:26,010
Don't worry, any of the problems you're having, or problems in the world,
别担心，你遇到的任何问题，或者说世界上的任何问题

538 
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,979 
or problems getting through the subway or finding a bathroom,   
诸如如何穿过地铁，如何找到洗手间之类的问题

539
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:33,050 
all those problems aren't going to spill over, they'll be contained,  
所有那些问题都没什么大不了的，它们终将会被解决 

540
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,542
and in fact maybe they don't exist.
或者实际上它们根本就不存在

541
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:51,458
What I like is if this very serious typeface
我喜欢的一点是，如果说有一个严肃的字体

542
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,940
tells you the do's and don'ts of street life,
告诉你在街道上该做什么，不该做什么

543
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,876
and it must be Helvetica at that moment.
那一定是 Helvetica

544
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,781
The image of Helvetica as the corporate typeface
作为公司字体的 Helvetica

545
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:14,058
made it the so-called typeface of capitalism,
给它留下了所谓"资本主义字体"的形象

546
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,860
which I would actually reject and say
我要站出来反对

547
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,920
it's the typeface of socialism
我要说，它是社会主义的字体

548
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:28,639
because it is available all over and it's 
inviting dilettantes and amateurs and
因为它到处都是，很容易得到，它欢迎业余爱好者

549
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,444
everybody to do typography,
和所有的人，都来从事文字排印

550
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:40,714
to create their own type designs, and l think that's a good thing.
创造他们自己的字体设计，我认为这是件好事

551
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,789
And I think I'm right calling Helvetica the perfume of the city.
我想应该把 Helvetica 叫做城市的香气

552
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:01,071
lt's just something we don't notice usually
它是某种我们平常熟视无睹的东西

553
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,842
but we would miss very much if it wouldn't be there.
但一旦它消失，会让我们非常的怀念

554
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:10,214
I think it's quite amazing that a typeface can advance to such a status
我想一个字体能发展到那种地步实在是让人吃惊

555
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,148
in our lives
在我们的生活中

556
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:23,884
As is always the case with any style, there's a law of diminishing returns.
任何风格的东西，都有一个审美疲劳的边际效用律

557
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,664
The more you see it, the more the public sees it,
你看得越多，整个社会看得越多

558
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:31,568
the more the designer uses those typographic and graphic solutions,
设计师们在字体排印和平面视觉上使用得越多

559
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:36,596
the more familiar, predictable, and ultimately dull they become.
它就变得越是熟悉，平庸和极度无聊

560
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:45,215
By the time I started as a designer, it sort
of seemed there was only one trick in town,
当我开始成为一个设计师的时候，这个行业的唯一“技巧”

561
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,751
which was like, what can you use instead of Helvetica.
大概就是，除了Helvetica，你还能用什么？

562
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,020
You know, ABH, Anything But Helvetica.
你知道，A、B、H（血型），所有的东西都在用 Helvetica

563
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,256
And you do need lot of sans serif typefaces,
其实我们需要有很多的无衬线字体

564
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:56,493
but it seemed like Helvetica had just been used so much and overused so much 
我觉得 Helvetica 被广泛地和过度的滥用了  

565
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,697
and associated with so many big, faceless things
并且总是与如此众多巨大的、面无表情的事物关联在一起

566
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:04,201
that it had lost all its capacity even, to my eyes at least, to look nice.
它已经失去了那种令人赏心悦目的能力，至少对我而言

567
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,504
And by the seventies, especially in America,
在70年代，特别是美国

568
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,407
you start to get a reaction against,
人们开始采取行动反抗

569
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,411
what it seems to those designers is the conformity,
那些千篇一律的设计风格

570
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:18,649
the kind of dull blanket of sameness
那种同一化的单调乏味

571
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,518
that this way of designing is imposing on the world.
这种设计方法已经蔓布整个世界

572
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,388
So something that had come out of idealism
设计已经不再发自内心的想法

573
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:29,018
has by this time become merely routine, and there's a need for a change.
而变成了纯粹的例行公事。这种情形需要有所改变

574
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,803
You come into design,
当你进入设计领域的时候

575
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,340
at the point that you start out in history,
你也进入了历史上的一个坐标点

576
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,042
without knowing that you're starting out in history,
却不自知

577
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,775
and often you don't have a sense of what came before you and how it got there,
通常来说你并不知道之前发生的故事，也不知道为什么发展到了那一步

578
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,182
and you certainly don't know what's going to come after.
你也必定不知道将要发生什么

579
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:57,855
And when I walked into design as a student at Tyler School of Art,
当我作为 泰勒艺术学校的学生，进入设计领域时

580
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:04,061
what struck me was sort of two separate cultures of design.
两种截然不同的设计文化给我很大的冲击

581
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,764
One was the corporate culture,
一种是公司文化

582
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,734
and the corporate culture was the visual language of big corporations,
公司文化指的是大公司的视觉语言

583
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,804
and at that time they were persuasively Helvetica.
那个时候的公司文化毫无疑问地是 Helvetica

584
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,141
They looked alike, they looked a little fascistic to me.
它们看上去很相似，在我看来有点法西斯

585
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,843
They were clean, it reminded me of cleaning up your room.
它们很干净，干净得让得我想去清理自己的房间

586
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:25,415
I felt like, this was some conspiracy of my
mother's, to make me keep the house clean,
我甚至怀疑，这是我母亲的阴谋，为的是让我保持房间整洁

587
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,943
that all my messy room adolescent rebellion was coming back at me
我所有的有关混乱房间的青春期叛逆都回来了

588
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,854
in the form of Helvetica, and I had to overthrow it.
而这次是 Helvetica 版本的。 我要把它全部推翻

589
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:38,054
Hey, I got some printouts of the stuff from last night.
嘿，我昨晚拿到了一些打印输出的东西

590
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,498
I also was morally opposed to Helvetica,
在道义上我也要反对 Helvetica

591
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:46,203
because I viewed the big corporations that were slathered in Helvetica
因为我看到那些被 Helvetica 粉饰的大公司们

592
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,006
as sponsors of the Vietnam War.
成为了越南战争的资助者

593
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,475
So therefore, if you used Helvetica,
所以，如果你用 Helvetica

594
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,111
it meant that you were in favor of the Vietnam War,
那就意味着你赞同越南战争

595
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,942
so how could you use it?
所以你怎么能用它呢？

596
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:04,655
What looked cool to me at that point were
record album covers, Zig-Zag rolling papers,
当时最酷的东西是唱片专辑的封套，之字形的卷桶纸

597
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,025
the accoutrements of dope life and counterculture,
麻醉生命和反文化的装备

598
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:13,930
obviously underground newspapers and magazines, and Pushpin Studios.
显然还有地下报纸和杂志，还有图钉工作室

599
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:19,703
Pushpin Studios was the height of, at the time I was in college,
我读大学的时候，图钉工作室是最火的

600
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:24,975
everybody's ambition. To work there, to do
work that was as inspiring as their work,
所有人的愿望是，到那里去工作，做出象他们那样充满灵感的作品

601
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:30,981
because it seemed fresh and alive and witty and content-laden,
他们的作品看上去是那样的鲜活，机智，寓意丰富

602
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:36,053
aside from the fact that Seymour Chwast and Milton Glazer could really draw.
而 Seymour Chwast 和 Milton Glazer 真的很会画画

603
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,511
And I wanted to make work that looked like that.
我也想做出那样的作品

604
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,261
When I was at Tyler, I wanted to be an illustrator,
当我在泰勒艺术学校读书的时候，我想成为一个插画家

605
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,064
and I had a teacher named Stanislaw Zagorski.
我的老师叫 Stanislaw Zagorski

606
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:52,536
And I never knew what to do with the typography on my designs.
我从来就不知道在自己的设计中如何安排字体和排版

607
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,239
We would make book covers and record covers as school projects,
学校作业是设计书籍封面和唱片封套

608
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,611
and l'd go to the local art store, l'd go to
Sam Flax, and l'd buy Helvetica as press type,
我会去当地的艺术商店，去 Sam Flax 艺术设计商店，
购买 Helvetica 的转印字

609
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:04,848
and l'd rub it down in the corner of the album 
the way I thought it was supposed to be, kind of flush left.
我把买到的字体擦印到唱片封套的角上，左对齐

610
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,452
And of course it would never line up
properly and thing would crackle and break
当然它们从来也排不整齐，会裂开或者破损

611
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,853
and it'd be terrible.
那真是可怕

612
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:15,492
And Zagorski told me to let go of the press type,
Zagorski 老师告诉我，别用转印字了

613
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,892
and illustrate the type.
自己画字体上去

614
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,859
And it hadn't dawned on me that typography could have personality
我恍然大悟，原来字体排印也可以是有个性的

615
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,528
the way drawing did.
就像画画一样是有个性的

616
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,472
I realized that type had spirit and could convey mood,
我意识到字体是有灵魂的，能够传达情绪

617
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,774
and that it could be your own medium,
它可以成为你自己独有的媒介

618
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:41,884
that it was its own palate, a broad palate to express all kinds of things.
它有着自己的韵味，一种能表达任何东西的能力

619
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:53,221
So I painted this cover the AlGA Annual,
我画了这期 AIGA 年报的封面

620
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,200
and the title of the AlGA Annual was
Graphic Design U.S.A.
这期 AIGA 年报的标题是《美国平面设计》

621
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,803
And I decided I would take the title literally
我决定从字面上精确地表达这个题目

622
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,640
and sort of analyze what Graphic Design U.S.A. was,
对美国平面设计做某种分析

623
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,912
so I decided what l'd do is list every state in the United States,
于是我决定把美国每一个州都列出来

624
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,648
and the percentage of people who used Helvetica.
加上人们使用 Helvetica 的百分比

625
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:17,109
And I didn't have any scientific evidence of knowing
what percentage of people in each state used Helvetica,
我没有科学的证据证明每一个州具体有多少人在用 Helvetica

626
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:21,525
so I decided to base it on the last Reagan election.
所以我决定基于最近一次里根总统的选举

627
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,261
So that the states that went for Reagan
所有支持里根的州

628
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:28,095
all had more than 50% of the people who used Helvetica.
都有超过50%的人使用 Helvetica

629
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,301
| lf Helvetica was the typeface of the Vietnam War,
如果说 Helvetica 是越南战争的字体

630
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,103
what's the typeface of this war? |
那这场战争的字体是什么？

631
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,705
The lraqi War?
伊拉克战争？

632
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,730
Helvetica.

633
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,180
Same time period, I mean it is, it's the same, it repeated.
相同的历史时期，我的意思是， 历史重演了

634
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,411
That's why we're there. Helvetica caused it.
那就是我们为什么在那里，Helvetica 导致的

635
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:52,956
And so ln the Postmodern period, designers were breaking things up.
在后现代时期，设计师们打破一切规矩

636
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:57,661
They wanted to get away from the orderly, clean, smooth surface of design
他们希望远离有序、干净、柔顺的设计

637
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,498
the horrible slickness of it all, as they saw it
远离他们所见的一切恐怖的匠气的东西

638
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,490
and produce something that had vitality.
创造出具有生命活力的作品

639
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:18,582
I myself got fairly disappointed
总的来说，对于现代主义

640
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,483
with Modernism in general.
我感到相当的失望

641
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,019
lt simply became boring.
它实在无聊透顶

642
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,657
lf I see a brochure now, with lots of white space
如果我现在看见一本小册子，有大量的留白

643
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,261
that has like six lines of Helvetica up on the top
上面有六行 Helvetica

644
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:36,600
and a little abstract logo on the bottom
下面是一个抽象的小 logo

645
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,837
and a picture of a businessman walking somewhere,
然后配一张商务人士走路的照片

646
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:46,476
the overall communication that says to me is,
整个东西在对我说

647
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:51,209
Do Not Read Me, because I will bore the shit out of you
不要读我，因为我会让你无聊到死

648
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,951
not just visually, but also in content
不只是在视觉上，而且在内容上

649
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:59,411
because the content will likely say the same as it says to me visually.
因为内容和视觉往往是一致的

650
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:08,459
I was in terrible rock bands when I was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
我15，16，17岁的时候参加过一些很糟糕的摇滚乐队

651
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:15,372
and I think through that experience got close to the album cover
我想正是那段经历让我接触到唱片封面设计

652
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:19,741
and essentially I went to art school because of album covers.
实际上我上艺术院校也就是因为唱片封面

653
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:26,182
I probably was the last generation who got taught doing everything by hand,
我可能是最后的一代人了，被教育要用自己的双手做一切事情

654
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:31,283
so you know, we drew 10 pt. type with a brush.
所以你知道，我们用笔刷来画出10磅的字体

655
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:39,262
ln general, I was always fairly bored, you know, looking at type books
总的来说，查阅字体手册对我来说永远是一件很无聊的事

656
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:44,634
and deciding over and over again which type to pick for a certain project.
翻来覆去的考虑，某个项目到底该选择哪种字体

657
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:48,570
lt just didn't seem a very interesting task to do.
那实在不是一件很有趣的任务

658
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:56,847
So here and there I think with the records, with the CD covers,
所以我总是想做CD封套的设计

659
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,583
we started to do our own type
我们开始设计自己的字体

660
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:04,654
and I think there was one instance, it was
for a Lou Reed cover,
有一次，我为 Lou Reed 设计一个封套

661
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:08,750
where this hand drawn typography resonated,
后来这个手写字体因此声名远扬

662
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:14,998
and numerous projects came out in that vein, in all sorts of directions.
无数的设计项目找上门来，什么方向的都有

663
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:19,196
You know, in a more funny direction and in a more serious direction,
有些方向比较有趣，有些则很严肃

664
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:27,676
where one time an intern carved a hand type into my skin for a lecture poster.
有一次为了做一张讲座的海报，一个实习生在我皮肤上割出了字体

665
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,983
The type in an instant, in a single image,
字体存在于一瞬间，在一幅独立的图象中

666
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:37,154
tells the story of its making, tells you about its process,
自述了它的诞生，它的由来

667
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,749
in a very elegant way, in a very fast way.
以一种非常优雅的方式，一种非常快速的方式

668
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:48,431
That typography strangely became so well
known, just within the design community
那件字体排印作品在设计圈内出人意料地出名了

669
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,867
of course, that some people thought that's all we do,
当然，一些人认为那就是我们的全部成就

670
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,364
which thankfully is not the case.
谢天谢地那并不是事实

671
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:14,855
Well, I always thought that approach of people 
using only three or four typefaces very suspect.
我很怀疑那些人只用三、四种字体的做法是否正确

672
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:19,095
I think this could be interesting to do for a single project
我想如果是作为设计个案，那样做可能会很有趣

673
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:25,398
as an exercise to put up additional limitations in order to focus yourself.
作为一种设定限制的练习，让自己集中精神

674
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:30,063
But as a strategy over a lifetime
但作为一个终身的策略

675
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,677
I think it's akin to a writer saying,
我想就好比一个作家说

676
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,513
I'm only going to write in three or four words.
我打算一辈子就用这三四个字来写作

677
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:40,550
Yes, you could probably do it, but for one why would you,
是的，你可以那样做，但首先，你为什么这样做？

678
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:48,286
and for the second would it really yield an
interesting body of work over a lifetime?
第二，一辈子这么做是否真的会产生大量有趣的作品？

679
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,710
Designers wanted to express their subjectivity,
设计师们希望表达自己的主观看法

680
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,845
their own feelings about the world,
他们对这个世界的亲身感受

681
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,616
their sense that they had something to say through design,
他们通过设计来表达自己的感觉

682
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,642
through the design choices they made.
通过他们对设计的选择表达出来

683
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,017
And of course this caused controversy.
当然这样就招来了争议

684
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:24,584
lf you take a figure like Massimo Vignelli,
who'd been one of the Sixties' high priests,
设想一下，假如是60年代设计界的教父：Massimo Vignelli 

685
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,652
with his company Unimark,
他的公司叫 Unimark

686
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:31,334
it's right there in the name, Unimark, the idea of a uniform kind of expression.
字面上的意思是"始终一致的表达"

687
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,802
When he looked at this new work,
当他面对这个新作品

688
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,774
this expressive, subjective, wayward,
这个充满表现力的、主观的、狂放的作品

689
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,244
to his way of thinking irrational new way of designing,
以及这种完全不讲理的新设计方式，他会作何感想？

690
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,236
lt seemed like the barbarians were not only at the gate,
——“看起来那些野蛮人不只是呆在门口，

691
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,874
but they'd stormed through and they'd taken over.
他们已经如暴风般夺门而入并占领了一切。”

692
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,785
ln the '70s, the young generation was after psychedelic type,
70年代，年轻的一代都喜欢追逐迷幻剂一样的字体

693
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,957
and all the junk that you could find.
什么样的垃圾你都可以弄到

694
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:58,895
And also in the '80s, with their minds completely confused
到了80年代，他们的思想完全乱做一团

695
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:04,634
by that. . . disease that was called Postmodernism,
他们被一种叫做“后现代”的病毒感染

696
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:09,239
people were just going around like 
chickens without their heads,
人们像无头的鸡一样四处乱窜

697
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:16,702
by using all kinds of typefaces that came around that could say ''not modern''.
使用一切所谓"不现代"的字体

698
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,943
They didn't know what they were caring for,
他们不知道他们在乎什么

699
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,916
they only knew about what they were against.
他们只知道他们要反对什么

700
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,147
And what they were against was Helvetica.
他们要反对的就是 Helvetica

701
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,738
I had no formal training in the field,
我并没有受过正式的训练

702
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,775
ln my case I never learned all the things l wasn't supposed to do.
就我而言，我从不学那些我“应该”学习的知识

703
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,676
I just did what made sense to me.
我只学我感兴趣的东西

704
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,876
I was just experimenting really.
我只是在不断的尝试 

705
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,850
So when people started getting really upset, I didn't really understand why.
所以当人们开始感到失望时，我觉得无法理解

706
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,127
l'd say, ''What's the big deal? What are you talking about?''
我说，这有什么大不了的？你们在说什么？

707
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,893
And it was many years later that somebody explained to me,
很多年以后有人对我解释了其中的原因

708
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,200
probably better than I can explain it now,
可能比我现在解释得更明白些

709
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,372
is that basically there was this group that
spent a lot of time trying to organize things,
大体上是这样，有一拨人花了很多时间组织起来

710
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,474
and get some kind of system going,
好不容易让某个系统运行起来

711
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,637
and they saw me as coming in and throwing that out the window.
然后他们看着我走进来把它扔出了窗外 

712
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:25,382
Which I might have done, but it wasn't the starting point
我可能会那样做，但这不是原因

713
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,950
and it wasn't the plan.
我并不是有意那样做的

714
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:34,721
Only much later did I learn the terms Modernism, and this and that.
我在之后很晚才知道了“现代主义”之类的术语

715
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:38,461
Raygun Magazine was very much experimental,
Raygun 杂志 很有实验性质

716
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,532
it was completely experimental. Every issue we'd try a lot of things
很彻底的实验性。每一期我们都作很多尝试

717
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,901
and a lot of them worked,
很多尝试很奏效

718
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,403
and a lot of them didn't work.
也有些不太灵的

719
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,006
I never saw proofs so a lot of times there were just mistakes,
我从来不看印刷样稿，所以很多时候会有些错误

720
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,675
flat-out mistakes, that people would write long essays on
最低级的错误，人们会写长篇大论

721
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:57,313
why I did this black type on a black boot, or something.
为什么我把这个黑色的字，放在了一个黑色靴子或者别的什么上面？

722
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,907
No, I never saw a proof, what are you talking about?
不，我没见过印刷样稿，你们在讨论什么？

723
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,986
lt's very hard to do the more subjective, interpretive stuff well.
要做好那些比较主观的、诠释性的作品不是那么简单的

724
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,091
You know, I can teach anybody off the street
你知道，我可以教大街上的任何人

725
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,961
how to design a reasonable business card or newsletter.
如何设计一个像模像样的商业名片或简报

726
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,965
But if I bring the same group off the street and play a CD
但是如果我把同一拨人带去听一张CD

727
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,902
and say, ''Okay, now let's interpret that music for a cover,
然后说，"好，现在让我们为那段音乐设计一个封套"

728
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,105
well 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost
十个人中有九个会感到手足无措

729
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,441
and are going to do something corny and expected,
他们会做出一些毫无新意的东西

730
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,377
and one person is going to do something amazing
但会有人做出一些令人吃惊的东西

731
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:31,147
because that music spoke to them and it sent them in some direction
因为那段音乐传达给他们一些东西，将他们引向某个方向

732
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:35,785
that nobody else could go. And that's the
area to me where it gets more interesting
每个人去的方向都不一样，但我在乎的正是这些有意思的、

733
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,922
and exciting, and more emotional.
激动人心的、更情绪化的地方

734
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,516
And that's where the best work comes from.
最好的作品就是这样来的

735
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,563
This is an article on the singer Bryan Ferry,
这是篇关于歌手 Bryan Ferry 的文章

736
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:51,100
and when I read the article it was very
much like so many of these others I had read,
我读起来的时候，和我以前读过的那么多文章没什么区别

737
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,971
and I was like, oh man, how disappointing, how boring.
我就像是，哦天，那有多让人失望，多么的无聊啊

738
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,808
And I went through all my fonts, which at
the time would've been hundreds and hundreds,
然后我看了看我有所的字体，现在差不多有成百上千了

739
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,141
uhm, well, it still is for that matter, and
恩，好吧，仍然是那个问题

740
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:08,651
didn't find one that seemed to fit my disgust and boredom with this article.
我找不到使这篇文章的看上去不那么恶心和乏味的字体

741
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,120
And I finally came to the bottom and there was Dingbats,
最终我在列表的最底部找到了 Dingbats

742
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,657
which of course now it's Zapf Dingbats so it's literally the last one.
现在的名字叫 Zapf Dingbats，所以按字母排序它是最后一个

743
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,491
And I was like, well it's boring and not worth reading,
然后我想，既然这篇文章如此无聊不值一读

744
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,797
why not do it in Zapf Dingbats?
那为什么不用Zapf Dingbats（一种装饰符号字体）来排版？

745
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:25,301
lt's a font. So it's all set in Dingbats,
这也是一个字体啊，所以就全部用 Dingbats 好了

746
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:29,939
it is the actual font, you could highlight it 
and make it Helvetica or something
这就是现在的字体，你可以把它全选换成 Helvetica 或者别的什么字体

747
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,641
and you'd be able to read it
然后你就可以阅读了  

748
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,474
but it really wouldn't be worthwhile, it's not very well-written.
但是它的确不值，它写得实在不是很好

749
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,781
Don't confuse legibility with communication.
别把易读性和信息传达混为一谈

750
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,918
Just because something's legible, doesn't mean it communicates
某样东西清晰易读，并不说明它能能传达信息

751
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:45,445
And more importantly doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
更重要的是，并不意味着它传达了正确的信息

752
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:51,094
And vice-versa, something that may be difficult to initially read
反过来说，某个东西或许开始的时候很难辨识

753
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,162
could be sending a completely different message
但它传达了一种全然不同的信息

754
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,099
that is valid for where it's being used,
同时又切合主题

755
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,136
and that may require a little more time or the involvement of the reader.
那么，或许它就是需要读者多花点时间和心思的

756
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:04,974
But it almost seems stronger the other way,
这种方式表达的效果往往要更为强烈

757
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:11,714
if something is a very important message
and it's set in a boring, non-descript way,
如果有条非常重要的信息用一种平凡无聊的方式排出来

758
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,551
the message can be lost.
这条消息很可能就被人忽略了

759
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,042
I mean that doesn't say ''caffeinated''!
我说这一点“含咖啡因”的意思也没有！

760
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,452
It's just like, hello?
就像说“你好”一样没有实际含义

761
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,351
|Why Not?|
（为什么没有呢？）

762
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,920
It's just sitting there! There's nothing caffeinated about it!
它就呆在那儿，完全嗅不出咖啡因的味道来

763
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,964
There's nothing ''extramarital'' about that.
这个也不带一点“外遇 (extramatital)”的意思

764
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,001
There's no ''sunshine'' here.
这个就更没有“阳光 (sunshine)”了

765
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,097
That's no fun, that's not a fun sandlot.
这可多没意思，不是个有趣的地方 (sandlot 沙地)

766
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,375
Where's the explosion?
“爆炸”？在哪里？

767
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,344
This could be the first date.
这也可能是第一次约会的（“第三次约会”）

768
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:44,711
This might be close, these buses are kind of boring.
这个倒还凑合，这些灰狗巴士是挺无聊的

769
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:53,984
There's a very thin line between simple and clean and powerful,
and simple and clean and boring.
“简洁有力”和“空洞乏味”之间的界限其实很模糊

771
00:59:55,291 --> 01:00:00,251
That was sort of the rise of what's referred to as grunge typography,
这就是所谓垃圾风格字体设计的兴起

772
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:06,135
and that became an all-consuming aesthetic for two, three, four, five years
并成为了二、三、四、五年内吞噬一切的“美学”

773
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:10,239
as that trend worked its way down from the masters who originated it
这种趋势从其发端的大师们开始

774
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,711
to anyone who sort of already had a tendency to make mistakes
一直延伸到那些时常犯错的家伙

775
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,580
and all of sudden found that they looked good now instead of incompetent,
他们忽然之间发现自己可以胜任了

776
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,945
which is how they looked the day before.
不再象以前那样白痴无能

777
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:24,754
Typography was so broken by the end of the grunge period,
垃圾时代末期的字体排印设计残破不堪

778
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,290
just lying there in a twisted heap,
就像置身于一堆混乱之中

779
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,160
all rules cast aside, no apparent way forward,
所有的规则都被抛弃了，前方看不到出路

780
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,399
that all those designers could perhaps do by the late nineties was to go back
所以这些设计师们在 90 年代末能做的就是回归

781
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,836
to return to an earlier way of designing,
回归到早期的设计方式

782
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:43,272
but with a new set of theories to support it.
但需要用一套新的理论来支持它

783
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,505
For us, modernism does have a more subversive side.
对我们而言，现代主义确实有着更颠覆的一面

784
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,874
I think that the whole image of modernism
我认为整个“现代主义”

785
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:22,578
as something that is primarily concerned with functionalism,
基本上就是“功能主义”加“实用主义”

786
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:26,883
utilitarianism, that is something that emerged much later,
后者是很晚才出现的

787
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,552
that is a sort of a late-modernist thing.
属于某种后期现代主义

788
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,521
I think the early-modernist movements,
我觉得早期的现代主义运动

789
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,624
like Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism,
像达达主义、未来主义、超现实主义

790
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,994
all had their more subversive sides
都有着它们颠覆的一面

791
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,930
and their more, how do you call it,
以及……该怎么说呢

792
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,890
dialectical sides, so they went against something.
…更辨证的一面，所以它们都有其针对的目标

793
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,142
It's not that we are against that experimentation
我们并不反对那样的实验

794
01:01:55,211 --> 01:02:01,946
that people like David Carson and Emigre and Fuse, that Neville Brody did.
像 David Carson、Emigre、Fuse 和 Neville Brody 所做的

795
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,588
We think what we do is a sort of an extension of that.
我觉得我们所做的其实是对他们的实验的一种延伸

796
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:10,660
All that hunting to the next typeface every time, it took a lot of energy,
每一次都要搜寻新的字体让我们疲惫不堪

797
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,864
and I can still remember as students that we were really disappointed
我还记得学生时代我们常常会很失望

798
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:18,925
because you wanted to use a certain
typeface and then you saw somebody else had used it,
因为你想用的某个字体被别人用了


800
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,938
and then you couldn't use it because you wanted to be original.
所以你就不能用它了，因为你想显得有原创性

801
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:26,398
And with Helvetica this whole problem is
non-existent because everybody's using Helvetica.
用 Helvetica 就根本不存在这个问题，因为人人都在用它

802
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:33,216
A lot of people see the way a young generation of 
designers uses a typeface such as Helvetica
很多人觉得，新一代设计师们对 Helvetica 这类字体的使用方式

803
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:37,186
as a more superficial way, as a sort of appropriation of a style.
相当的肤浅，只是在照搬某种风格

804
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,089
I think we would very much disagree with that.
我想我们完全不能同意

805
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,525
I think all three of us grew up in the '70s
我们三个都是七十年代出生的

806
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:48,225
in the Netherlands which was dominated by the last moment of late Modernism.
当时的荷兰还在后期现代主义的“最后统治”之下

807
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:52,168
For example, the city I was born in and grew up in, Rotterdam,
比如我出生和成长的城市鹿特丹

808
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:56,038
the logotype was designed by Wim Crouwel,
标志字体是 Wim Crouwel 设计的

809
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:59,041
the stamps were designed by Crouwel,
邮票是 Crouwel 设计的

810
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,977
the telephone book was designed by Crouwel,
电话簿也是 Crouwel 设计的

811
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,112
the atlas that we used in school was designed by Crouwel.
我们学校里用的地图册还是 Crouwel 设计的

812
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:08,317
So for us it is almost like a natural mother tongue,
所以对我们来说，Helvetica 就好像是我们的母语一样

813
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,919
that's something really natural.
是非常自然的一件事

814
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,956
It's not that we ... I mean, a lot of people think you sort of study it
并非我们……我是说，很多人觉得你是从书本上看到

815
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,592
from books and then copy it or something, but
然后抄袭过来，但是

816
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:20,323
I would really say that it's almost in our blood.
我更愿意认为它早已流淌在我们的血液里

817
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,334
It's also funny because a lot of people connect Helvetica
还有一件有趣的事，很多人认为 Helvetica 有可能会导致

818
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:30,506
sometimes with the dangers of globalization and standardization.
全球化和标准化的危险

820
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,342
I'm not afraid for that quality at all
我一点不担心这种情况

821
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,413
because I'm just know that everybody can put a twist on it.
因为人人都可以调整它来适应自己的需要

822
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:44,453
I think you can put as much nationality
in the spacing of a typeface as in the typeface itself.
我认为，在字体间距中体现出的国家个性，丝毫不亚于字体本身

824
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:48,758
And I think the way people like Crouwel
use Helvetica is typically Dutch, I think,
我认为象 Crouwel 他们对 Helvetica 的使用就是典型的荷兰式的

825
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:54,030
and that's why I'm never really impressed with the argument
所以我向来对所谓

826
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:58,990
that Helvetica is a sort of global monster.
“Helvetica 是一个全球化怪物”这样的观点不以为然

827
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,442
I'm not one of those people who is a real typographer,
我并不是那种真正意义上的字体设计师

828
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,481
I don't know all the fancy words for all the letters,
不知道那些关于字母的华丽词汇

829
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:57,386
and the sort of ligatures and ascenders
and descenders and all that kind of thing.
比如“连字”啦、“上升部”、“下降部”之类的东西

830
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,957
I just more, sort of, react to certain things,
我只是……只是对某些东西更有感觉

831
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,859
and just do what I feel is right,
只是把自己感觉对味的东西做出来

832
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:07,386
so I'm never sort of a classical type guy.
所以我从来不是那种传统意义上的“字体设计师“

833
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,833
So I get obsessed about things, I collect things,
我为某些事物所着迷，喜欢收集一些东西，

834
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:18,641
you know, I've got so many bits and scraps
of paper, of things that you find on the street,
你看，我有这么多零碎的纸片，来自街边常见的事物

835
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:23,179
or wrappers. It's just making something
beautiful out of something very ordinary.
以及包装纸。它们让非常平常的事物变得漂亮起来

836
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,648
That's what I really enjoy, the ordinary things
这是我所喜欢的，平常的东西

837
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:30,608
that most people would just gloss over, I find really beautiful.
大多数人可能会一瞥而过，但是我觉得它们很漂亮

838
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,961
The biggest thing for me in terms of design
用设计的语言来说，我觉得最重要的是

839
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,964
is to get a sort of emotional response from a piece.
“于细微处获得情感上的回馈”

840
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,455
That's some of the best design, I think.
我觉得这是最棒的设计

841
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:49,605
I see stuff and to me, if it makes me go,
我观察周遭的事物，从中获得创作灵感

842
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:53,075
I wish I'd done that, that for me is the biggest thing, you know.
我希望我做出好的作品，这对我来说是最重要的事情

843
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:59,537
Or you just get this real whooo, kind of like, oooh, that's nice.
或者让你感到，哇，这真不错

844
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,977
It's all about that emotional response.
这些都是情感的回馈

845
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:14,730
One of the things I've always really wanted to design is airplane signage,
我一直很想做的一件事是为飞机设计引导标识

846
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,266
an identity for an airline.
以及航空公司的视觉形象

847
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:24,407
I'd love to do the uniforms, or you know,
seats and the whole thing, the trucks and
我很想设计制服，又或者是座椅等一整套的东西

848
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:27,877
that kind of thing. I think it would be brilliant.
还有卡车之类的东西。我想一定会很棒的

849
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,881
You know, I've done these twelve-inch sleeves for so long;
你看，我做这些十二英寸的唱片封套设计都那么久了

850
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,483
I want to go a little bit bigger scale now.
现在我想做些更“大号”的设计

851
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:39,318
It's that idea that something's designed to stand the test of time,
我希望能设计经得起时间考验的东西

852
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:43,893
and hopefully some of the things I'm
designing will be still being used in twenty, thirty years.
最好在二三十年后还有人使用

853
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,361
I'd love to think that.
我会非常开心

854
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:55,671
I got married about three years ago. I did the wedding invites,
我三年前结的婚，当时我设计了婚礼的请柬

855
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:59,875
which believe me, is just the worst job you can ever do as a graphic designer.
相信我，这是身为一个平面设计师最糟糕的工作

856
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:03,012
I've done other people's wedding invites, and I'll never do one again.
我曾做过别人的婚礼请柬，但我永远都不想再做了

857
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,503
It's the most stressful job I've ever had,
这是我做过压力最大的一个工作

858
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:10,719
dealing with mother in laws is just horrific. But I did ours,
和岳母打交道真的很恐怖，但我还是做了我们自己的

859
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,322
and on the order of service
然后在婚礼仪程卡上


860
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:20,062
I did a little credit to give thanks to Max Miedinger for Helvetica.
为感谢 Helvetica，我把  Max Miedinger  写在了致谢名单中

861
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:26,102
But my wife vetoed that; I had to take it off the invite.
但被我妻子否决了，我只好把他从名单中去掉了

862
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,434
But it was funny . . .
不过这蛮搞笑的…

863
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:40,707
I think I fell into the step of Helvetica when I was at DR.
我记得我开始用 Helvetica 是在 DR(设计共和国) 的时候

864
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,948
I always really enjoy using Helvetica
我总是很享受使用 Helvetica 的感觉

865
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:51,348
because . . .some people say they use a
different typeface because it gives a different feeling.
因为…有些人说他们要用不同的字体来表达不同的意思

866
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:56,531
And I really enjoy the challenge of making Helvetica speak in different ways.
但我却很乐意接受挑战，让 Helvetica 用不同的方式说话

867
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,003
It's been around for fifty years, coming up,
它到现在已经有五十年的历史了

868
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:07,510
and it's just as fresh as it was . . . obviously,
it wasn't intended to be this cool thing,
给人的感觉却还跟新的一样……当然，它不是有意设计得如此奇妙的

869
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,910
but it's just a beautiful font.
但它就是一个这么美好的字体

870
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:21,951
Well, we are less obsessed with Helvetica
嗯，我们现在对 Helvetica 没有

871
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,819
than we used to be.
以前那么着迷了

872
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:31,627
Yes, we were really obsessed with Helvetica, yet not more so much.
没错，我们对它曾经非常着迷，但现在没那么厉害了

873
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:37,930
We accepted it somehow ... We came to a
point where we accepted that it's just there.
不过我们还是能接受它的存在

874
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,766
We like restrictions.
我们喜欢限制

875
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,737
We can't operate, we can do nothing without restrictions.
没有限制我们什么也做不了

876
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,171
The more restrictions we have, the more，happy we are.
限制越多，我们就越开心

877
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,872
When we started school,
在我们读书的时候

878
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,311
the influences in graphic design were like Brody and Carson.
那时平面设计的潮流人物是 Brody 和 Carson 他们

879
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:30,386
It's only after that we really looked at Josef
到后来我们才真正仔细研究了 Josef Muller-Brockmann 的作品

880
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:34,254
work, and '60s Swiss Typography.
以及 60 年代的瑞士文字排印设计

881
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,559
When we started the office we really said
所以在我们刚开始这间工作室的时候说过

882
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,530
we wanted to look back,
我们希望回顾过去

883
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:46,297
to find more structured design.
找到更结构化的设计

884
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:52,705
For us it's very important to reduce the elements we use.
对我们来说，精简我们使用的元素是很重要的

885
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,946
When it comes to type, we will only use, if possible, one typeface,
在用到字体时，我们会尽可能地只用一种字体

886
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,575
or two, and if possible we will use one size.
或两种，而且只要可能我们会只用一种字号

887
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,621
We don't like humanistic typefaces for example,
比如我们不喜欢人文主义的字体

888
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,715
it must be more rational
我们选用的字体必须更具理性色彩

889
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,487
because otherwise it has too much expression.
否则就可能包含过多表达

890
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:25,303
We think that Helvetica contains somehow a design program.
我们觉得 Helvetica 暗含了某种设计的规范

891
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,677
It will lead you to a certain language also, and this is also
它会将你引至某种特定的语言

892
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:33,615
one of the secrets of the success of Helvetica
这也是Helvetica 成功的秘诀之一

893
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,719
that in itself it is already
就是它自身已经包含了

894
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,089
it has a certain style, a certain aesthetic
某种特定的风格，某种特定的美感

895
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,359
that you will just use it like that,
你就会这么用它

896
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,695
because of the typeface, because the typeface wants it like that.
因为这个字体，它本身要求这么做

897
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,531
You wilI do what the typeface wants you to do.
你只要听从它的指令照做就行了

898
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,534
If you are not a good designer, or if you are not a designer,
如果你不是个好的设计师，或者你本来就不是设计师

899
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:57,494
just use Helvetica Bold in one size,
用固定字号的 Helvetica 粗体就是了

900
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:02,968
like for a flyer. . . it looks good.
比如用在宣传单页上...它就会... 很好看

901
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,770
So it may very well be that when it comes to trends,
很可能，至少在平面设计的潮流上

902
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:07,109
at least in graphic design, we've reached sort of the end of history.
我们已经抵达了历史的终点

903
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,413
The pendulum that swings back and forth
doesn't have any more directions it can swing in.
钟摆往复运动，不会再摆向第三个方向

904
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:19,688
The final trend may simply be the completely 
democratic distribution of the means of production
最终的潮流可能就是生产方式完全为大众所用

905
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:23,392
to anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.
每个希望能拥有的人，每个负担得起的人都能得到

906
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,395
You can have a music studio for a couple thousand bucks,
你花上几千块钱就能拥有一个音乐工作室

907
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,598
you can have a film studio for ten grand,
花上一万美元就能有一间电影工作室

908
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:34,503
you definitely can be a designer with one or two thousand dollars,
你当然也可以花上一两千美元来成为一个设计师

909
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:38,474
and have basically
而且基本上

910
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,577
similar tools as the people who do this for a living.
你使用的工具和那些专业的人士也不会相差太远

911
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:45,080
If all these people have the tools to make good design,
当这些人都有了好的设计工具，他们就会

912
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,682
they realize that it ain't that easy.
意识到到事情并不那么简单

913
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,985
It's not just opening a template in CorelDraw or in Powerpoint.
设计不是打开一个 Corel Draw 或 PowerPoint 模板那么简单

914
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:54,656
It's not about having the latest version of whatever program.
拥有某个软件的最新版本并不是设计

915
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:58,360
If you don't have the eye, if you don't a sense of design,
如果你没有眼力，如果你没有对设计的感觉

916
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,523
the program's not going to give it to you.
软件也不可能赋予你

917
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:06,935
I remember, years ago, a friend of mine
who produced radio commercials
我记得几年前，有个做电台广告的朋友

918
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:11,206
had five guys go out in the hallway of CBS Records
叫五个人到 CBS 唱片公司的走廊去

919
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:15,544
and sing the beginning of ''Round Round Get Around, I Get Around''
去唱 Beach Boys 的 “Round Round Get Around, I Get Around”

920
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,745
by the Beach Boys.
这首歌的开头

921
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:20,682
And they really tried, they rehearsed for a
week to get their harmonies right,
他们确实很努力，他们花了一个星期来排练，把和声练准

922
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,953
and they were the best vocalists who worked in that department on that floor,
而且他们是所在楼层里唱歌唱得最好的

923
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:25,854
and they loved music.
而且他们还很热爱音乐

924
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:26,855
And they went out and they sang it,
然后他们出来演唱了

925
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,016
and of course they were totally flat and sounded horribly...
当然他们唱得非常的糟糕....

926
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,960
terrible. But they'd rehearsed. And then
太糟糕了。但他们排练过了，然后

927
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,298
the voiceover for the commercial said,
''Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.''
这个广告的画外音说：“现在你该知道 Beach Boys 唱得有多好了吧。”

928
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:39,101
And it's really sort of the same thing.
这和我们现在所说的其实是一样的

929
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:43,435
The closer you come to it, and the more you see it,
你越是接近它，对它看得越多

930
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,607
the more you appreciate it when it's terrific.
就越能够欣赏它的优秀

931
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,510
There are more good, young type designers
现在的优秀的年轻字体设计师越来越多了，比以往的任何时候都要多

932
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:53,415
now, by young I mean probably late
twenties, early thirties, than at any time in history.
我所说的“年轻”指的是二十年多岁三十出头的

933
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,818
So who knows what typefaces they will design
谁也不知道他们将设计出什么样的字体

934
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,887
in terms of style and so on. But they'll be good.
什么样的风格... 但他们会好起来

935
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:03,926
And to my way of thinking, that is a huge gain,
在我看来，这就是巨大的进步

936
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:09,421
a huge benefit that comes with this more
democratic, more accessible technology.
受益于这些更大众、更普及的技术

937
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,469
There's just something about Helvetica.
Helvetica 中就是有着某种特质

938
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:19,133
Something about the fact that people keep
saying I've come up with an improvement of Helvetica.
人们不断的说“我对 Helvetica 做了某种改进”

939
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,937
And it never is really good.
但这些改进从来不会讨好

940
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:28,150
You know, I wonder whether or not somehow there's 
some whole undiscovered science of typography
我不知道字体设计中是不是还存在某些尚未发现的科学

941
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,120
that would sort of say it's not just because we're used to seeing it,
能够解释出，并非因为我们已经看惯了它 (Helvetica)

942
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,723
it's not just because it was associated with all these things
也并非因为它 (Helvetica) 和那些

943
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,125
that we consider authoritative,
...我们认为的“权威”联系在了一起

944
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:41,330
but it somehow has this kind of inherent rightness.
而是因为这个字体本身具有的一种内在的合理性

945
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:45,334
You know, the rightness of the way the lowercase a meets the curve,
比如，小写的 a 运用曲线中的合理性

946
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,103
the rightness of the way the G has the thing that comes down,
和大写的 G 下划的那一竖的合理性

947
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:51,539
the rightness of the way the c strokes are like that instead of that.
还有 c 的笔画是这样而不是那样

948
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:56,980
I mean, I wouldn't have believed that those
things actually could be right or wrong
我的意思是，我不认为这些合理性完全是由

949
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,314
as opposed to someone's tastes.
个人的欣赏品味所决定的

950
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:04,342
Yet we sort of have nearly fifty years of
history of the thing just sitting there
这个有着近50年历史的东西

951
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:10,546
daring people to fix it. And it seems to be unfixable.
在那儿轻蔑地等着我们去修正它。但它看上去就是那样的无懈可击

952
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,930
It's always changing, time is changing,
世界永远在变，时代在变

953
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:19,201
the appreciation of typefaces is changing very much.
对字体的欣赏也在发生很大的改变

954
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,471
Why you grab a certain typeface for a certain job
我们现在为某个项目选择某个字体的原因

955
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:29,172
has a different meaning than we grabbed a typeface in the fifties for a certain job.
和我们在五十年代时为某个项目选择某个字体有着完全不同的含义

956
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:35,912
You are always child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.
人永远都是时代的孩子，无法跳出你所处的时代

957
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:48,296
What we have is a climate now in which the very idea of visual communication
我们现有的风气是，视觉交流的观念

958
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:51,133
and graphic design, if we still want to call it that,
和平面设计（如果我们还愿意这么叫的话）的观念

959
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,969
is accepted by many more people.
已获得广泛的认可

960
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:59,408
They get it. They understand it. They're starting to see graphic communication
他们了解了，他们理解了，他们开始把图形交流

961
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:02,844
as an expression of their own identity.
视为对自己身份的一种表达

962
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:08,283
And the classic case of this is the social networking programs
一个经典的例子是，那些社交网站程序

963
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:14,056
such as MySpace, where you can customize your profile.
比如 MySpace，在那你可以定制自己的个人资料

964
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,192
You can change the background, you can put pictures in,
你可以修改背景，可以加入图片

965
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,462
you can change the typeface to anything you want,
随心所欲的更换字体

966
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,833
and those choices, those decisions you make,
而你所做的这些选择

967
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:29,371
become expressions of who you are. You start to care about it, in the way
就表明了你是什么样的人。你开始关心这个

968
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,975
you care about the clothing you're wearing as an expression of who you are,
就象跟你关心你的衣着，那也是你个人身份的表达

969
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,011
or your haircut or whatever,
又或是你的发型之类

970
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:40,115
or how you decorate your apartment-all of those things.
还有你如何装饰自己的房间——等等这一切

971
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:44,086
You know, we accept the idea of identity being expressed in that way,
