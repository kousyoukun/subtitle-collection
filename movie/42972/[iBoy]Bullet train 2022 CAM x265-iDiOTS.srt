THE FATHER

3
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,740
The Boomslang was
stolen from the zoo last night.

4
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,590
It's extremely dangerous.

5
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,180
Father.

6
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,280
Any news on my grandson?

7
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,510
No change.

8
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,840
He hasn't woken up.

9
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,610
A father's job is to protect his family.

10
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,940
But there's no Johnny

11
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,780
When Wataru was on that roof...

12
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,180
when he was punched...

13
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,120
where was his father?

14
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,830
Wataru is lucky.

15
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,250
You never know what horrible fate...

16
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,150
your bad luck has saved you from.

17
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,670
BULLET TRAIN

18
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,510
TOKYO

19
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,770
Thank you for taking the job on such short notice

20
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,330
I am great

21
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,680
You are getting the new and improved me

22
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,750
since I think the commentary I am experiencing a comedy like never before

23
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,870
 you ever get less reactive to situations are more accepting of people's shortcomings

24
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,190
When you're uncertain about coming back to work

25
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,410
but it's like very sad

26
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,890
you put peace out in the world

27
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,230
You get peace back

28
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,690
Thank you

29
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,310
And your therapist might be forgetting what you do for a living one

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,960
ladybug

31
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,330
Waiting and you're operational there

32
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,610
You don't like it

33
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,250
You like it

34
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,980
I like it

35
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,090
You like it alright

36
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,870
Oh

37
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,150
I see what you doing

38
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,690
Lady Bug supposed to be lucky

39
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,850
You don't have bad luck

40
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:38,920
Really

41
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,540
LADYBUG

42
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,000
My bad luck is biblical

43
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm not even trying to kill people

44
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,150
someone dies

45
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,420
That's an exaggeration

46
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,180
It is my last job

47
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,490
the political blackmail photos, remember the suicidal bellboy climb to

48
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,600
the roof of his hotel and take it anymore

49
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,150
Seems more like his bad luck than yours

50
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,240
And he didn't die

51
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,210
OK

52
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,320
he drove to the hospital

53
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,380
It's good luck on how you frame it

54
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:09,870
sure

55
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,170
See

56
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,790
I like it here

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,790
I could live here like the atmosphere people are considering

58
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,710
For that guy

59
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,630
Thanks

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,630
this job gains were supposed to be carvers

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,130
but he's got some stomach thing

62
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,970
Harvard you know

63
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,170
He got new stanching grabs

64
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,110
I'm pulling for cardboard you pick these seconds

65
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,110
Carver said you wanted simple for your first job back

66
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,090
Doesn't get simpler

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,310
Shit shit

68
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,030
Security

69
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,890
523

70
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,150
Carver

71
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,910
talk about a candidate for self improvement

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,070
Calling in sick in high school

73
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,050
I can't hear that personal growth

74
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,110
I know I'm being judgmental

75
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,550
I need to

76
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,460
Work on that

77
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,060
but she just wanted to push back

78
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,640
You have the strangest requests

79
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,460
firecrackers

80
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,660
posters

81
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,300
Please tell me the sleeping powder

82
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,050
You always give the bodyguard anchorage a heart attack

83
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,280
Take the gun

84
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,170
Ticket please.

85
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,810


86
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,320
Thank you for using our train.

87
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,100
First class is that way.

88
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,270
I would assume you didn't take the gun

89
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,950
Barry says every confidence #2 is peaceful

90
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,010
And your handler says some conflicts require a gun

91
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,820
OK

92
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,660
well that's a start

93
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,170
Yes

94
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,180
OK

95
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm thinking about starting my own simple jobs all the time

96
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,060
It's a terrible business plan

97
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,470
No one sociopaths him or maniacs his quality people every citizen

98
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,640
It's time for some change I think is right

99
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,720
Mary does not know what you do for a living

100
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,240
OK

101
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,840
here we go

102
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,680
The bullet train has 16 cars

103
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,460
10 economy

104
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,060
six first class and remember only one minute stop at every station

105
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,250
Do you mind

106
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,040
Was it fucking blind or something

107
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,010
Making

108
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,010
LEMON & TANGERINE

109
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,390
Oh no

110
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,060
you're right

111
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,040
OK

112
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,530
thank you

113
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,450
Compulsion or something I have to take it if I see it

114
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,950
you talk someone serious

115
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,640
A goldfish biscuit I'm I don't

116
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,730
I don't understand it

117
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,430
OK

118
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,720
simple

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,650
Snatching and grabbing a briefcase

120
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,130
Intel says there's a train sticker on the handover owners

121
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,610
Owners are not so cool

122
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,850
and last update says the owners will be an economy class owner plural

123
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,360
why did you chose spiritual enlightenment

124
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:21,770
Please

125
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,330
I don't know

126
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:30,940
Shit

127
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,500
I think I'd draw my ticket to

128
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:34,960
Uh

129
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,630
that receipt shows I bought a ticket though

130
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:36,930
right

131
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,500
Most

132
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,610
Yep

133
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,390
Don't worry

134
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,610
God

135
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,600
Don't think bout here

136
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,740
It's nice to know

137
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,380
You found her

138
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:40,470
Lemon

139
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,350
It made my night shift

140
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,760
I can get a wet one on it or something that's not my mate

141
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,490
how it's not yours

142
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,980
Yeah

143
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,170
OHS in that case just leave your jacket open

144
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,140
Everyone have a good old look

145
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,380
Yeah

146
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,690
I want everyone you talk is fun with you all you'll cope together so no one else knows his level

147
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,000
I think they'll notice the childish code names first

148
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,990
but I forgot stick with fruit

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We're not Apple or orange

150
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,820
so we're seeing this case

151
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,880
Are we doing this

152
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,840
You know what's in the case

153
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,740
Sophisticated

154
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,060
cross appetizer on the front

155
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,020
Maybe that's all

156
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,590
You said six hours incoming state 30 passengers per car

157
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,600
guessing 2 bags per

158
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,820
See Times 2 three

159
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,230
Yeah

160
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,230
no fucking way I'm gonna find one for you

161
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:31,950
Wait

162
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,340
but Instagram man

163
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:33,960
yeah

164
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,540
holy shit box

165
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,670
I want my living because you're sour

166
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,450
Looks like lemonade

167
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,570
Let me draw a sore throat in the morning pie

168
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,780
The last time you ate a lemon meringue pie and drizzle cake

169
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm sorry he's talking about lemons

170
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,810
I have the case

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,100
Well

172
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,870
that's great

173
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,130
Yes

174
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,130

197
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,830
Everything I learned about people I know from Thomas

198
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,190

There's a story stop me

276
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,290
if you've heard where this woman found herself in the unfortunate position of owning your father a tidy sum of money

277
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,780
Now the issue was it took us some time to acquire this money

278
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,660
but she did pay it back 5 minutes late

279
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,140
didn't she

280
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,450
Fucking hell yeah

281
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,330
She had my finger for every minute

282
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,530

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,120

285
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,060
You just cut once

286
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,530
You're overthinking it

287
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,410
You're thinking it's not a word

288
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,330
it's really

289
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540

He doesn't need a reason to kill people like you

302
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,400
He needs a reason not to

303
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,770
Does he

304
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,240

Don't even bother forwarding interference

348
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,700
I do not know

349
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,230
The Japanese underworld used to be ruled by a man named Nikisha

350
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,600
Medication Islam for Roger bastard

351
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,700
but he was also beginning traditional lawyer

352
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,740
He was ordered nights ago when you were in there in you were like family treat

353
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,080
You like you were one of his own

354
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,780
Then out of the blue comes this 6 foot fucking

355
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,410
6 Gator from Russia

356
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,580
Using himself from the Russian mafia

357
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,990
there was XKB

358
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,650
No one really knows the truth

359
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,950
What is known

360
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,990
This isn't Russia

361
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,840
It's called it killed by killed

362
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,900
And very

363
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,060
very fucking quickly became one of many years

364
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,140
He's closest advisers

365
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,070
Not loyal to him

366
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,630
said

367
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,730
how was your office

368
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,930
A full ticket

369
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,350
He has to be trusted

370
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
He's dangerous

371
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,300
they said the modern plague

372
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,070
They said a white death

373
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,180
Two months

374
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,870
He made his own alliance

375
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,600
His own gang

376
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,770
And what we do

377
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,730
Stabbed him in the back

378
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,150
Coming there for the Blues

379
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,830
Fucking brains out

380
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,290
didn't he

381
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,040
He was willingly gives you off the face of the Earth and one single

382
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,240
And they are empire worthy of the word death

383
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,560
Sir

384
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,960
Let me put this bluntly

385
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:06,040
There's this solar psychotic leader with the largest criminal organization on the planet shoved right inside our fucking arse cheeks

386
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,060
Mother fucker

387
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,000
You mentioned Thomas tankers

388
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,790
You one more time

389
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,270
I'll shoot you in the fucking face

390
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,800
OK

391
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,160
Yeah

392
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,920
if you're such a bar

393
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,140
I was

394
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,980
How can we hide do random operators and start getting something yourself

395
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,500
If you actually read the briefings you've known me

396
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,240
you know wife well

397
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,900
you had a wife

398
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,300
Yes

399
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,320
she was the most important fucking thing in his life and she died

400
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,520
Drunk driving accident or some shit

401
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,050
As a compounding ain't left

402
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,930
since they say there's a lesson to be there

403
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,680
listen and he didn't hire two random operators them

404
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,010
And no

405
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,910
he asked for the best

406
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,370
He asked for the two responsible for the part of your job

407
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,130
He asked for pros who wouldn't fuck up free words

408
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,490
Lemon

409
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,650
we are fault

410
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,000
What do you want

411
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,680
People think that I'm just some young girl

412
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:03,950
This one's future wife 4

413
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,300
Future mother

414
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,690
But I'm not in someone else's story

415
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,730
Trouble

416
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,730
The fuck does that have to do with me

417
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,410
You work for the most feared boss in the city

418
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,220
White death

419
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,510
Oh deny it all you want

420
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,310
but you work for someone who works for someone else etcetera etcetera

421
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,610
and it all falls under the same person

422
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,690
He delivered a briefcase 2 days ago to one of the whitest associates

423
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:42,240
and I saw my opportunity follow the case and find the White death

424
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,840
Don't know what you're thinking

425
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,350
That was my favorite part of the story

426
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,060
You're going to kill him for me

427
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,050
The fuck am I going to kill the White death

428
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,800
Look at that

429
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,780
We are right but unsettled

430
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,480
It's about

431
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,810
We rescued this fucking song

432
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,500
We found the fucking took briefcase make things right

433
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,060
be like it never happened

434
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
You still got that based on

435
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,300
you know

436
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,960
First give you a false sense security when I guess on the neck

437
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,800
Yeah also stops you from being shot in the chest

438
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,170
but I guess you missed that episode

439
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm really most of because that's I was talking shit

440
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,310
Sure

441
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,800

443
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,910
Why dance

444
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,050
Going down

445
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,560
Nothing

446
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,780
Yes

447
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,320
No

448
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm going to

449
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,030

450
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,180

I can hear from him

454
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,830
You killed my wife

455
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,510

00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,920

Why I mean we're when you arrive there when you're on mine

461
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,210
You don't even know you

462
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,790
Wow

Really

467
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,490
The toxicity of anger

468
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,380
Why

469
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,390

to make sure we don't step foot on this train

476
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,170
You see the case

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,490

One of them is walking towards me right now

510

I think I saw the other one platform that we know who the owners of the case are

511
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,760
What I'm talking about

512
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,830
We have to have a hard discussion

513
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,060
Where are we

541
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,220
It's the choir car

542
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,650
There's a kind of underneath this table pointed right at you

543
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,330
so I can't really hear you say there's a gun

544
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,180
Just fucking wait anyway

545
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,990
It's been a long time since Johannesburg

546
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,710
Yeah

547
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,370

548
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,990
You don't Remember Me

549
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,450
You look like every white homeless man I've ever seen

550
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,570
OK

551
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,450
Well

552
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,680
I have something I believe you're looking really

553
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,510
You don't Remember Me

554
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,830
I'm sorry I'm not the giants

555
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,110
but I don't remember you alright you shot me

556
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,390
Shopping twice

557
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,040
You also have a shoe box face

558
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,420
I know your black frame glasses

559
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,760
That cheeky fucker who took our briefcase

560
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,110
Yes

561
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,480
yes I am

562
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,000
You know

563
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,290
I've done a lot of personal work since Joe Burton

564
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,630
I've forgiven

565
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,530
I've moved on

566
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,450
I've learned that with any potential conflict

567
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,070
there's an opportunity for growth

568
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,670
a path to a peaceful outcome

569
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,480
Who's that

570
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,640
Nigeria

571
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,010
How did you know that this year

572
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,210
Didn't I mention I've always been lucky

573
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,990
It was then that I took a long hard look into the mirror

574
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,490
You know what buddy

575
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,650
I didn't like what I saw

576
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,000
Until I did

577
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,330
You know

578
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,180
Between this

579
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,600
now it's a wall

580
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,380
It's illusion

581
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,150
Within every wall away to window

582
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,290
It's a door real quick

583
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,750
Everyday is fucking headache with you in it

584
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,380
right

585
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,730
You and your partner

586
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,020
I'm leaving these tangerine

587
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,510
OK then

588
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,330
like the fruit blessings

589
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,120
What's your plan here

590
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,140
Here's the plan

591
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,440
I give you back your case

592
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,440
You don't kill me

593
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,320
you give you a case to an employer he doesn't kill you

594
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,400
you're alive

595
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,070
I'm alive

596
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,980
everyone's happy win win

597
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,590
don't you think

598
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,260
Why do you know whoever holds you won't kill you for failing your job

599
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,210
Lose lose no happy man

600
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,350
I just want to get off this train

601
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,210
because she's in gardening some shit

602
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,590
you know

603
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,090
I'd like to separate from great

604
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,610
but then you wouldn't killed someone

605
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,610
didn't you

606
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,040
How did you know it was an accident

607
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,220
Tragic

608
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,740
That's cool story bro

609
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,960
But I think you had your own plans to getting out there with that case

610
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,630
Thinking about the owners

611
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,830
Hoping to watch that this is so busy cutting off our arms instead of cutting off our fingers

612
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,890
start times the Tank Engine always says simple is better

613
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,440
The kitchen

614
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,620
It's the fucking kitten

615
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,040
Think about people from Thomas everything

616
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,540
Realize how can we people are you so well and you are diesel

617
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,470
I'm not a diesel

618
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,940
The diesel is diesel diesel that I've ever seen in my life because diesels

619
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,070
bluff they go too far and I'm trying to get diesel out of my life

620
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,170
You know there was going under this table

621
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,450

622
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,210
Because I can't

623
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,410
Oh

624
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,480
alright

625
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,500
Watch over

626
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,120
Number for me

627
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,690
Patients that will only interest

628
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,940
You followed me stop

629
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,100
He's a bag of Dicks

630
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,640
Lady

631
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,500
I'm sorry

632
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,020

633
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,280

00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,190
These are your diesel

635
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,450
House

636
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,220
There's another body here

637
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:53,620
of course

638
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,060
here is about my fault

639
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:59,300
I believe it's the sign of the White death to the twins idea to treat when I said the white death

640
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,780
death

641
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,360
death

642
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:01,740
OK

643
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,700
grab my ass

644
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,970
There's someone else doing the job on this train

645
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,220
The twins we know that again

646
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,100
not twins movies but not twins

647
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,130
There for the kid

648
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,430
but

649
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,390
Somebody killed a kid

650
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,040
The guy with the knife

651
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,930
The wolf

652
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,660
Sitting thinking this happened to run into me because of course he did

653
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,230
Now get this

654
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,090
The kid was poisoned in the same way as

657
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,630

660
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,750
Don't you don't know

661
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,860
What are you doing

662
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,450

663
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,290

for a minute that Jesus Christ made a bit of a Bosch pub

667
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,240
What five stations to Chiozza get Tickety Boo

668
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,190
Describe me as someone who lives in perpetual anxiety

669
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,910

680
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,460

00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:17,310
What

688
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,670
I do love an accent

689
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:40,690
Xrays

690
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,270
Me too

691
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:43,310
Well

692
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,860
the man

693
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,460
Watching your son

694
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,800
I wonder how he'll do it

695
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,940
Maybe a pillow to the face

696
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,250
Maybe something clever

697
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,020
Like an amber ball in the Ivy

698
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:00,870
No

699
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,140
no

700
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,080
you hold on to it

701
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,000
The innocent young girl likes to really get you very far

702
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,570
If you're holding a loaded gun

703
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,130
This on speaker

704
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,190
Be honest

705
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,440
you should

706
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,130
So

707
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,350
It's so hot

708
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,600
Everything

709
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,420
I don't know man how much you get your particular

710
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:49,770
Swimming

711
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:53,920
We're not finished

712
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,550
You're going to sit here

713
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,540
and you're going to go through every combination until you open up that case

714
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:00,560
OK

715
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,020
that could take no

716
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,280
No

717
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:02,820
it won't

718
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,920
And stop winning numbers

719
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:05,720
Just a thought

720
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:07,730
Yeah

721
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:22,880
Alright

722
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,910
There you go

723
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,370
Bobby

724
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,400
I guess our best option now is bring the white death of the man who killed his son

725
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:34,600
Yeah

726
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,720
but bosses didn't do it

727
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,370
I could give a rats until you're ready

728
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,360
He's not the type mate

729
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:38,860
I tell you

730
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,140
What do you like your arms

731
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:40,670
You know

732
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:40,950
I love

733
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,250
You know someone's gotta take the blame

734
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,890
don't they

735
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,670
What's your name

736
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,540
You can welcome them seal

737
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,380
Big buck about

738
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,710
The train at the next stop with the briefcase lying on it

739
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,160
can we say

740
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,110
here's the part that killed

741
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,510
the white death wants to make sure you will be honest about

742
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,120
situation played by Sebastian

743
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,100
The applications don't have and a lot of songs that were dead

744
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,620
What you thinking

745
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:18,950
Yeah

746
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,130
You were all told to exit the train

747
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,520
yeah

748
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:07,960
One night you professional

749
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,800
I want to make sure when some of your cousin trap

750
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,310
but clearly not some fucking 80s dance off in it

751
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:16,070
Where's your twin tangerine

752
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,010
tangerine

753
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,840
Let us keep the case safe and the white death sun

754
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,180
Yeah

755
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,000
he's there

756
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,510
Wave to your fucking face Princess

757
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:33,270
He's a fucking happy chappy any but I've got on the train

758
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:33,530
you know

759
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,060
10 seconds

760
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,880
Let's let's throw off well

761
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,030
stick to the plan part of the ozone

762
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,480
Do us a favour

763
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,910
get the fuck off my back

764
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,480
will you

765
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,510
OK

766
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,450
OK

767
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:07,700
Yeah

768
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,720
so they buy it when you find that glass is twat like right to the fuck now

769
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:13,870
No

770
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:14,680
I'm gonna go up

771
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,040
You go

772
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,190
then double back when you're done

773
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,520
If you see him fucking deal with him

774
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,360
yeah

775
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,430
I'll please away

776
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:25,930
Always moving down from

777
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,200
you know

778
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,040
being careful something else is going on here

779
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:29,650
Yeah

780
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,010
yeah

781
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,040
I still feel like there's some things that were like in the middle

782
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,160
Sweating

783
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:35,320
would you know

784
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,940
Say I said I'll fucking shoot me in the face

785
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:41,540
Thomas still taught me how to see people read them for real

786
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,260
yeah and I'm never wrong

787
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,300
Am I no glasses

788
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,480
He has no guy

789
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,510
OK

790
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,710
Shoot first

791
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,550
come up with yours later

792
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:00,690
Always do

793
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,520
Lemon

794
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,060
You be careful too

795
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,000
They were just trying to rocket

796
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,120
They're coming along right

797
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,900
7 more minutes and I'm off this train

798
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,520
Are you hiding any bathroom

799
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,300
Yeah

800
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,200
have you tried these smart toilets

801
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,580
They're a pleasure to the senses

802
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,560
If I had one in the Chamber

803
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,620
I would rock this bad boy right now

804
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,720
Boundaries we need boundaries

805
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:27,860
You said that

806
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,640
What you have

807
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,690
Look at that

808
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,500
I knew my luck with rubble from you

809
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,760
What the fuck are you doing

810
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,230
I am doing the same thing that I'm doing to the gun in your hand

811
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,270
I'm just making things interesting

812
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,880
I'm hedging my bets

813
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:19,490
You could say fuck if the gun doesn't kill you

814
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,450
the case will

815
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,540
It's and now it's unless you fire it

816
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,040
but don't fire it

817
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:28,900
You know it's I mean

818
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,310
And likewise put in this briefcase here

819
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,410
This is very

820
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:36,070
Well

821
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,460
this is not an at all

822
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,070
this is

823
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:47,520
Did you know that there have been 31 attempts on the White's life from within his own organization

824
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:51,510
Each one he executed with their own weapon

825
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,560
Do you see what I'm getting at here

826
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,370
I brought you here to film

827
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,640
You push my son for roof

828
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,300
right

829
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:09,890
Bring me to this train friend me as an assassin you need to kill the white death and choose my gun

830
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,380
Very good

831
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:16,790
Very good

832
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,770
It is

833
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,280
Hey brilliant

834
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,480
What she get in this

835
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,170
Occupied

836
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,780
remember that mob surgeon that died mid heart operation

837
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,010
Yeah

838
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:38,780
he had a stroke

839
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:39,100
right

840
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:39,260
No

841
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,460
that was official cover

842
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,500
He was poisoned

843
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,500
The assassin goes by the name of the Hornet

844
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,200
Like

845
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,450
he used boomslang snake venom

846
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,130
it congeals the blood making you bleed out of every orifice

847
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,170
If the antidote isn't administered within 30 seconds

848
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:56,840
you're dead

849
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,470
Fun fact

850
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,800
the same poison that was used on

851
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,060
Sick water

852
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,360
What is the Hornet doing on this train

853
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:06,780
Well

854
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,280
whatever deal was made

855
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,000
it wasn't done through the normal channels

856
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,560
Something else going on here

857
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,910
We're still occupied

858
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,430
lady

859
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:21,620
Danielle said all the love must figure out who the Hornet is came here for revenge for his wife

860
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,750
His boss came in a whack the morning

861
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,220
Oh my God

862
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,560
did you just say whack it

863
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,680
Did I'm bringing it back

864
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,060
We need to stay where it was

865
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:33,210
If I can figure out who it is I can give him to limit intense reading so they don't whack me really

866
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,730
let me see what I did there

867
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,280
Really proud of yourself aren't you

868
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,310
Do you usually supply

869
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:41,200
So

870
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,000
That's cool

871
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,150
I know children can't give a rest

872
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,830
so where's my fucking face

873
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,150
Oh no

874
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,630
thank you

875
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,550
We're OK

876
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,800
Bottle of water

877
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:06,230
Cortana

878
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,160
What do you have

879
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:11,180
Anything sparkling bubbles

880
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,020
Don't know the guy

881
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:20,580
Oh yeah

882
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,930
Remember I gave all my money that guy to wear my glasses

883
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,320
I almost forgot about that

884
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,400
You're welcome

885
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,950
yeah

886
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,440
10 quick level mate

887
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:50,500
Turn off

888
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,230
don't wanna go until

889
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,870
You want to talk this out

890
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,450
Don't stick it in OK

891
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,080
No

892
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,020
Yeah

893
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,200
where the fuck did you do

894
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,910
Is it or is it that

895
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:57,440
Correct

896
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,300
You're gonna get that

897
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:07,890
No

898
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,670
Probably ought to get that

899
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,820
It could be important

900
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:20,980
Support

901
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,310
Yeah

902
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,250
what you are doing this is to get off the next stop holding the briefcase or he will kill everyone on the train

903
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:30,670
OK

904
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:30,950
yeah

905
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,630
I can make it

906
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,850
but lemon is a little tied up by now

907
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,280
Both of you

908
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,020
this time with the kids for everyone dies

909
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,400
Fucking paranoid this love Adam and the case on your deal Ohhh

910
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:47,970
Yeah

911
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,710
don't think I'll bring some in some anyway

912
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:51,770
Do you still got his phone

913
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,350
Do you have a gun on the other

914
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,080
Tonight

915
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,310
Well

916
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,190
For what it's worth

917
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,070
you seem like right fucking asshole

918
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,640
I'm glad you're gonna fucking die with me

919
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:06,810
That's nice

920
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,630
Securities

921
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,160
They even know what lemon looks like

922
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:15,890
wow

923
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,890
Do do look like twins

924
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,350
huh

925
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:21,760
Yeah

926
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:22,360
OK

927
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,490
I've got the case now

928
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,520
One still taking the train to kill station

929
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:28,980
OK

930
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:29,520
we can do that

931
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,740
Wonderful hey

932
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,750
Have you opened the case now

933
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,370
Of course not

934
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:34,900
You know

935
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:37,670
I never asked for the combination for me and keep me safe that way

936
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:38,920
Yeah

937
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,250
so no one gets greedy

938
01:00:58,890 --> 01:00:59,540
I know

939
01:00:59,550 --> 01:00:59,950
I know

940
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,540
I'm sorry

941
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,160
I'm sorry

942
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:07,360
I'm sorry I I had this bad luck thing and I was already holding the thing so I want the what was that

943
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:07,960
What do you want

944
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,320
This was trying to sell it

945
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,620
Well something now in the market for fucking deal

946
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,500
nose and pantyhose

947
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,450
But they were buying it

948
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,710
they were – ohhh!-

949
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,730
Smarter than everyone you have one kid

950
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:24,560
Yes

951
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:27,370
Please give

952
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:29,960
Cool man

953
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,590
Do what you want

954
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,030
just

955
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:35,680
This is my son

956
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,710
Your son

957
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,580
Do you know how easy it was to get him to follow me up onto that roof

958
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:51,770
Didn't think it would take you 3 hours to even realise your son was missing

959
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:58,640
You're terrible father and your son is going to pay for mistakes that you've made

960
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,080
You don't know anything

961
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:03,020
Don't drive

962
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,000
How hard it is

963
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:08,680
You just

964
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:10,310
To support

965
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,110
To practice their toys

966
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,580
Noises you stupid

967
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:17,660
Sorry

968
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,900
Into what was going on here

969
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,240
but you wouldn't have enough

970
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,250
Seeing a tiny white prick with a pair of glasses come to labia

971
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,770
What about a silver case where trains talk about hands or you know

972
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,500
it's not bringing any

973
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:39,060
I'm gonna have you seen a silver briefcase with the train

974
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,310
Did you say train sticker by the handle

975
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:41,770
Yeah

976
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,660
that's no

977
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,020
I haven't seen anything like that

978
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,900
I think I remember

979
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:48,920
Tomorrow

980
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,110
You're right

981
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,010
are you OK

982
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:52,480
That's

983
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:53,750
Oh yeah

984
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,340
You know

985
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:58,700
I'm just gonna keep doing that

986
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,920
No

987
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,580
it's alright

988
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,100
Part of me come on up

989
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,220
you guys take care

990
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,230
Just one thing though

991
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,130
Most people

992
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,060
most people assume suitcase

993
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:08,300
you know

994
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,250
because it's a train

995
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,390
overnight and all but you

996
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,350
You said briefcase

997
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,950
I've never said briefcase

998
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,950
I think

999
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,590
I found my diesel

1000
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,760
You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto

1001
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,970
We should just get off this train now

1002
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:36,350
If you think I'm stepping up this time without lemon order case

1003
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,420
you must be mistaken

1004
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:38,040
OK

1005
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:41,620
well the case in the first class lounge behind the bar to the trash can

1006
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,840
It's yours me getting off

1007
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,360
I'm gonna go find a temple and reevaluate my choices

1008
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,740
or something that sounds very lovely

1009
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,580
but here's the deal

1010
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,260
I still need a full guy

1011
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:56,630
No

1012
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,200
I understand I get it

1013
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,980
It's been a time for me because

1014
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,250
you know

1015
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:02,720
I'm thinking

1016
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:07,710
do I hand it back in one piece or do I chop you up into little pieces and stuff inside the fucking mum on them

1017
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,540
That's what's going through my head right now

1018
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,330
hmm

1019
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:13,780
Or I want you got a better idea

1020
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:14,100
do you

1021
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,440
You know before so it was just a wall

1022
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,540
but it's an illusion man

1023
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:22,540
It's a construct you know cause within that wall it's a window

1024
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:23,980
a window of opportunity

1025
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,010
Door

1026
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,670
it's within that wall is a door

1027
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,530
I'm finding it very hard to follow

1028
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,150
This story

1029
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,950
Point is that door is closed

1030
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,260
Now the only question is which one is the diesel

1031
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:51,340
Which one is the dock

1032
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,200
the dock

1033
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:57,700
It's the kids show Thomas the train engine close Thomas the Tank Engine

1034
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:58,560
Please Mr

1035
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:01,890
I mean

1036
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,290
he said that he's going to hold me for ransom

1037
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,750
I'm sorry I get captivated by white girl tears

1038
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,450
Bravo

1039
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,940
Common sense tells me that this old shaking keys are

1040
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,130
Here's the one in charge

1041
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:18,330
but I'm really good at reading people and something tells me you are just not fucking right

1042
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,910
So let's see here

1043
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,690
I mean I can't shoot you both

1044
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:27,710
You know

1045
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,540

1046
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:30,340
You know what

1047
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:31,060

1048
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:31,830
I'm sure you'll love this

1049
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,440
We're going to play a little game if you wanna play a game

1050
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:36,080
Put both your hands up perfect

1051
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:40,200
I knew you would like this you're gonna close yours and I'm gonna count to three

1052
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:44,960
And whichever one of you was in charge you're going to raise your hand and whichever one is that you point the one who is now

1053
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:47,220
If you both raise your hands or you both pointing each other

1054
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:50,480
I know you're both laws and the training and then I'll fucking shoot you both

1055
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,680
ready you said you couldn't get us both you could no I didn't say that did not yes

1056
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:01,430

1057
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:07,500

1063
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,100

1064

1092
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:27,400

1100
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:13,180

01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,380

1102

But he killed both of them and then he said he was going to get away with some sort of money

1191
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,720

01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,210

1199
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:13,830
He just said that I would be a good backup plan and I would pretty girl makes a good hostage

1200
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,050

1202
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,620

1204
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,390

1205
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:18,890

You're free to go yeah yeah

01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,110

01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,220
OK anyway

1210
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,310
Are you OK

1211
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:32,580
Diesel

1212
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:37,110
Bloom fucking worst little shit stirrer

1213
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:40,790
See

1214
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:42,640
Lemon

1215
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:46,470
Conversation

1216
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:48,990
Wasn't done

1217
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,350
Anyway

1218
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,130
people say they really are

1219
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,670
Right

1220
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,100
He's been diesel

1221
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:04,690
Running up and down this trying causing all sorts of fucking havoc and it was

1222
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,900
you know fucking time you dirty little diesel

1223
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:15,460
And they let me blade and then never blades

1224
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,220
Non random play

1225
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,070
Are you playing you better

1226
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,330
What

1227
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,250
You're a diesel

1228
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:57,980
Ohh

1229
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:03,280
he said that he's going to kill you and playing everything on you

1230
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,690
He also said that

1231
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:09,020
That someone waiting for us at Kyoto station

1232
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,030
Someone's scary

1233
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:12,940
It would hurt me

1234
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,000
No one's gonna hire you

1235
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:16,690
It's OK

1236
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:19,210
Get off the street

1237
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,780
We make the next stop

1238
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:30,600
We'll be fine

1239
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:51,290
Looking

1240
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,130
Come on

1241
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,560
I can't

1242
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:58,180
My backpack is leave it

1243
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:58,780
Let's go

1244
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,250
Let's go

1245
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,160
we gotta go

1246
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,640
Probably no

1247
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:04,950
Please come back

1248
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:15,910
I got it

1249
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,300
It's not your fault kid

1250
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,810
it's

1251
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:20,430
It's my life

1252
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,160
not yours

1253
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:25,480
YouTube life out of you

1254
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,820
Something to bring some peace because

1255
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:30,820
Everything else

1256
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,750
If you run into a guy named Carver's Dick

1257
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,320
you can tell him I said so

1258
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:44,670
Like

1259
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:47,040
I took this

1260
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:47,960
I didn't want to leave

1261
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,140
I thought you could probably use it to kill whoever's waiting for us at the end of the line

1262
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,190
Be honest

1263
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:01,750
We shouldn't

1264
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,380
even though

1265
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,470
Really

1266
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,530
OK

1267
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,490
so you're creeping me out

1268
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,510
so if you don't mind can you just find another seat like way

1269
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,470
way

1270
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:25,770
way down there and that way I don't have to tell you twice

1271
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,580
You won't

1272
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,210
Let's just move

1273
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,160
Was that a snake

1274
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:53,580
Yes

1275
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:16,170
Fuck

1276
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:27,160
Wow

1277
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,550
What's in everything

1278
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:41,300
The person who pushed my grandson off the department store roof

1279
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:43,760
Why your son

1280
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,100
He is going to help me kill the white dead

1281
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:51,960
like Kidjo station and that was the only way to get him on this train

1282
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:56,500
The white death

1283
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:57,580
That's fine

1284
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:00,620
but he couldn't even do that

1285
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:05,430
Just a few calls back

1286
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:07,510
Over the dead

1287
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,230
Michael Son was pushed off her roof

1288
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,310
What makes you think I would leave him unprotected

1289
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:48,280
My grandson is safe

1290
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,500
My son is not dead

1291
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,580
The only thing you know about an old man

1292
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:03,680
young lady is that he has survived much more and much worse than you

1293
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:14,950
Giving myself

1294
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,200
Are you all right there

1295
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:28,050
You know

1296
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,350
you believe this coincidence

1297
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,640
but I already got a dose of anti venom in me today

1298
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:34,630
So good

1299
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:41,040
The girl

1300
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:43,980
her intentions with you would not want her own

1301
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,060
Yeah

1302
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:48,880
a blind man could see you of the one in the dark

1303
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:51,810
Pretty convincing

1304
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,140
To do anything

1305
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,570
It will do what it wills

1306
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:03,870
Why do you laugh at the feet

1307
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:09,590
Fade for me is just another words bad luck

1308
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,740
And that

1309
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,260
Follows me around like

1310
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,490
I don't know somebody

1311
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:25,080
My handler calls me ladybug

1312
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:26,850
She's witty

1313
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,190
ladybug

1314
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,880
This is very lucky indeed

1315
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:34,310
No

1316
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,780
she's being ironic

1317
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,010
I'm going to tell you a story now

1318
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:40,520
No

1319
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:41,010
I'm good

1320
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:42,910
It's short really

1321
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:45,540
I'm fine now it's pretty quick

1322
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,000
It's a good story for you

1323
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,840
I think I'm cool

1324
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:51,880
Here we go

1325
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,190
I made a promise to myself

1326
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:03,810
And I would provide for my family no matter what it cost

1327
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:11,390
I have a reason to highly coveted position within the ministry

1328
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:17,490
Crying family man raced out to take my place and I'm from the north

1329
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,440
Ask not to trust this man

1330
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:31,610
She told me I have lost my appetite

1331
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,530
He was in Rome

1332
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:35,670
I'm sorry

1333
01:28:59,050 --> 01:28:59,650
Every time

1334
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,120
Phone

1335
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:02,920
Except

1336
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:25,280
Quick death have taken everything from me

1337
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,010
Almost

1338
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,090
I went into hiding

1339
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:47,210
Search for way to strike out the white death without endangering what I have left

1340
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:50,970
But he remained forever and love each

1341
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,390
I did not think

1342
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,160
Faith ever give me a chance to make things right

1343
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,290
What they call a ladybug in Japan

1344
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:05,920
10

1345
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:13,800
The boy was told there is a spot on his back for each of the seven sorrows of the world

1346
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:15,740
You see

1347
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:18,030
Lucky

1348
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,540
So that others may live in peace

1349
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:33,120
Everything that's ever happened to you has led you here

1350
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:35,590
Faith

1351
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:38,240
That's a shit deal

1352
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,650
Go to station

1353
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:45,240
Will arrive on this train

1354
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,170
May be allowed to make things right

1355
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,950
My son is few cars up

1356
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,750
If you could escort him off this train

1357
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,990
Yeah

1358
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,030
let's see the white Tesla and any other self destructing

1359
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:04,880
You let me worry about the waiter

1360
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,530
OK

1361
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:12,890
What's the right about

1362
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:16,570
You breathe

1363
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,170
Thank you

1364
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:36,720
Squirrel

1365
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:38,330
I thought

1366
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:44,070
Well

1367
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,750
Seemed like a decent guy

1368
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:49,280
He shot me

1369
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:51,480
Nice

1370
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:53,230
Still

1371
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:53,650
you know

1372
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:02,390
Ohhh

1373
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,110
Mondo

1374
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,710
Fuck

1375
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,160
Fucking best man

1376
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:19,000
Ohh you drink the water

1377
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:24,710
We're focused my brother

1378
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,820
You will know

1379
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:12,820
You

1380
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:19,280
you're more like Thomas

1381
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:19,720
anyway

1382
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:20,020
right

1383
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:55,320
Fellas

1384
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:57,840
we need to come up with a plan

1385
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:01,930
You killed my father

1386
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:04,900
Talk to me

1387
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:06,220
I'll shoot you in the fucking throat

1388
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,380
When we are so quick to anger

1389
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:15,240
we are slow to understand what I'm about to kick you off

1390
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,950
You point your finger at someone in blame

1391
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,810
There are four fingers pointing back at you

1392
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:26,750
3

1393
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:28,080
That's weird

1394
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,010
We

1395
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:35,440
we've got to go

1396
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:39,560
Volume does not present the hungry man

1397
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:41,960
but the farmer who planted the tree

1398
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:48,640
Presents to find to her plump plums her for her resentments now

1399
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:52,480
So how can you listen in the white death is a farm

1400
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:56,870
Where the plums with plums

1401
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:57,830
It doesn't make sense

1402
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:02,700
why you motherfuckers using metaphors cookies shut my fucking brother you shot my son

1403
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:08,030
We prepare together

1404
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:10,280
What we die alone

1405
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,830
It's always trying to say

1406
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:25,320
The white death waits for you with his army of assassins killers from all countries

1407
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,030
My son-in-law are on this train

1408
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,850
If it wills I will get my revenge

1409
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:41,020
Feedback on stop listening as I can

1410
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:45,150
I'll go to the driver car and get us the fuck out of here

1411
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:51,460
What are you going to do

1412
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:52,870
Joe Biden

1413
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:56,110
Will buy some time

1414
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:55,010
Deutsche

1415
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:57,890
and yet

1416
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:07,870
Hey fellas

1417
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,030
I'm looking for Mr Death got his case here

1418
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,070
Our people are people

1419
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,470
I came to see you

1420
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:35,800
And to make you finally see me

1421
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:43,640
This is the last CBI

1422
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,810
Predictable

1423
01:37:53,850 --> 01:37:54,580
Into you

1424
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,500
You're the solution

1425
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:05,560
You push

1426
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:06,000
you push

1427
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:08,330
People

1428
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:22,990
Do it

1429
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:27,360
I came here to kill you

1430
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:36,110
Kill me like you did all the others who tried the same

1431
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:48,510
Did it

1432
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:56,620
Fucking do it

1433
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,930
I see you boys go

1434
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:13,770
Yes

1435
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:19,790
Then you got the new address

1436
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:28,170
Phone number

1437
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,570
What about the others

1438
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,830
They're all dead

1439
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:38,390
Good news is I have your case

1440
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:42,000
With the news

1441
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:44,370
All right

1442
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:46,050
let's go

1443
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:51,810
Alright

1444
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:52,190
Tommy

1445
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:54,880
It's hard for you to shut up

1446
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:55,740
Oh shit

1447
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:59,200
if things in Japanese there is no episode in Japanese

1448
01:39:59,210 --> 01:39:59,590
What the

1449
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:14,210
I got a bad feeling about this

1450
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:16,170
You have no idea what's in this case

1451
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:17,090
What you talking about

1452
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:18,910
but why is it always going to be us

1453
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:19,990
That opens this shit

1454
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,510
Just open the God damn face

1455
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,520
I could keep my fucking arms

1456
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:25,220
Mr

1457
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:25,610
Death

1458
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:26,460
if I may

1459
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:32,680
The shadow buyer who bought their contracts got songs

1460
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:34,200
just train me

1461
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:36,680
I wanted the Tangerine Lemon

1462
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,570
That was you

1463
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:40,150
right

1464
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,190
Yes

1465
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,670
various thought I brought you on this train

1466
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:45,910
and helping you kill each other

1467
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:46,560
OK

1468
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,420
well

1469
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,350
If I could

1470
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:51,770
why

1471
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:52,770
Why didn't do much

1472
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:53,330
you know

1473
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:56,400
In the moment asking that very question

1474
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:57,720
if it's so safe

1475
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:58,970
why didn't he just open it

1476
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,540
What if it's a bomb and it blows up in our faces

1477
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:03,820
You think these stupid masks are going to protect us

1478
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:13,980
Mother

1479
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:19,000
Sorry about

1480
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:26,220
My wife was taken from me

1481
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:31,900
I heard I'm so sorry for your loss

1482
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:38,420
No no no no no

1483
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:41,400
Nothing in life is an accident

1484
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,710
It was an assassination attempt on me

1485
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:45,840
But faith

1486
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:55,040
Two Wetwork operatives friends our job in Bolivia

1487
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:59,480
My entire crew

1488
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,230
and I had to go deal with it

1489
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:04,650
and he didn't hire two random operators

1490
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,170
Lemon no

1491
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:07,610
he asked for the two responsible for the Bolivian job

1492
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:14,020
That is why it was my wife in the car that night marked me

1493
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:17,710
thanks putting my wife in the hospital

1494
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:23,030
A piece of the rib piercing heart

1495
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:30,810
Only the most skilled cardiovascular surgeon could save our life

1496
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,410
But two nights earlier

1497
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:37,470
this surgeon is poisoned

1498
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:42,660
Faint

1499
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:44,060
faint again

1500
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:45,820
Everyone

1501
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:48,750
Judgmental

1502
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,990
but if you hired the Hornet

1503
01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:53,970
you had your own kid killed I guess

1504
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:55,290
OK

1505
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:55,670
Oh yes

1506
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,390
I did a piece of shit

1507
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,490
I told her not to leave

1508
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,670
Wait for me

1509
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:11,630
She promised it was the last time we would ever bear him out of trouble

1510
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,390
It will come

1511
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:13,990
It will always go for you

1512
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:15,110
Well

1513
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,030
I suppose she was right

1514
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:25,170
If I had amputated that weakness out of my life years ago

1515
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,210
she would still be by my side and helps to process this

1516
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,650
I I have a good therapist of my life

1517
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:33,520
nothing much

1518
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:39,600
Valuable lesson if you do not control your fate

1519
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:42,360
It will control you

1520
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:46,260
So I took control

1521
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:48,640
I brought them all here to die

1522
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:55,940
But now there is only one here

1523
01:43:58,170 --> 01:44:00,020
Mr Carver

1524
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:03,270
Excuse me

1525
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,670
I'm going for Carver calling in sick fuck card

1526
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:09,330
The man who murdered my wife

1527
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:16,640
Bro

1528
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,310
just open it fine

1529
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:19,700
you're happy I'm not

1530
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:08,250
Today

1531
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:12,240
tomorrow

1532
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:21,840
When you do the best you can raise them right

1533
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:25,840
I do not know why you were here

1534
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:27,140
but move out of my way

1535
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:28,890
Are you enjoying your wife

1536
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:32,760
Our paths will distance to return to each other

1537
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:36,510
OK

1538
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,400
Fucking slow down man

1539
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:43,320
It's so far from you stopped the train

1540
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:45,940
Took the velocity of the training

1541
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:46,240
the body

1542
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:50,140
the body mass and I realized that I don't know how to fucking drive a bullet train dude

1543
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,800
All you do is talk about trains

1544
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:53,080
Thomas is a metaphor for life

1545
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:54,640
but how to actually get done

1546
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:33,070
Stop the train

1547
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,190
Got it

1548
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:39,370
We're on the road track

1549
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:55,890
Summer what

1550
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,480
I'm sorry

1551
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:00,370
I thought you

1552
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:02,230
Actually it was like twice

1553
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,250
Sorry

1554
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,390
you shot me twice

1555
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:21,640
Sorry

1556
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:22,050
I'm sorry

1557
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:45,420
Approved by society

1558
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,010
You know the one thing deep down you cannot control

1559
01:49:58,430 --> 01:49:59,580
Video play

1560
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:08,840
Hey

1561
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:10,860
I'm sorry about day three

1562
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,090
Yeah

1563
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:15,240
Please

1564
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:19,850
Growing out really

1565
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:23,920
Fuck no

1566
01:50:48,370 --> 01:50:49,760
We're all trying safe

1567
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:32,220
OK

1568
01:52:01,190 --> 01:52:01,530
Boy

1569
01:52:04,290 --> 01:52:04,760
I mean

1570
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:07,110
Let's go

1571
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:10,180
Play

1572
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:13,130
Milk tea

1573
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:05,060
hold on

1574
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:27,390
About your wife

1575
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:29,420
I had nothing to do with that

1576
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,180
It's a mistake

1577
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:32,890
I'm not Carver

1578
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,310
Not only do sex and grab jobs

1579
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,810
I like the profile that guy on the cover

1580
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:41,270

I'm just filling in

1583
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:52,480
You're filling in what it's worth

1584
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:53,630
Carver isn't Dick

1585
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:55,950
The most cunning assassin

1586
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:58,400
Maybe the laziest but

1587
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,070
Ohh

1588
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:08,740

1589
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:11,370

Did you see that

1594
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:36,270
It was there

1595
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:43,840
Dude

1596
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:46,620

1597
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,960
This plunge plumbing give up all resentment

1598
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,050
Oh my God

1599
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:10,520
it's my love that delivered

1600
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:13,810
My father's corpse and my feet

1601
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:16,030
Narcissism on this chick

1602
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:17,570
Untreatable

1603
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,230
No

1604
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:19,530
I don't wait

1605
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:20,110
Wait

1606
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:23,090
wait who's this

1607
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:24,290
I thought their family

1608
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:26,920
You need some suggested reading

1609
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:30,660
If I may surviving borderline personality disorder

1610

Did you need rescuing

1622
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,010
You came to rescue me

1623
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:22,410
Please don't make me regret it

1624
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:24,800

01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:33,560
I want you to know you were the greatest

1628
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:38,690
Most wonderful handler that I could ever have ever

1629
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,970

1630
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:45,950

Have one in the car

1633
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:51,980
Next time take the gun

1634
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:55,540
Thomas Deberry OK simple

1635
01:57:58,350 --> 01:57:59,270
Stop it

1636
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:03,480
Usually AM

1637
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,860
Maybe it is just about how we frame it

1638
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:08,890
like maybe there's some bad luck or good luck

1639
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,630
Maybe we'll just say to you it's a fake

1640
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:11,490
Ooh

1641
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:13,150

1642
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:14,160

01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:27,340
Well

1644
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:30,990
How do you know it's a bad thing

1645
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,570

Sopping

1650
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:55,990
but they did not want us to get in that car

1651
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:56,670
Wow

1653

1683
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,400
THE PRINCE

1684
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,920
You.

1685
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,340
BOLIVIA

1686
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,270
26 YEARS EARLIER

1687
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,920
I want you to be strong son.
Do you understand?

1688
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,280
Be strong.

1689
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,410
THE WOLF

1690
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,580
My heart.

1691
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,620
Find me the son of a bitch who did this.

1692
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,870
But fate made this a two for one special.

1693
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,080
My heart.

1694

00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,710
Occupied.

1696
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,720
All of Japan is in terror because
a poisonous snake was stolen.

1697
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,110
Boomslang snakes have a very strong poison.

1698
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,490
When they bite, it can
cause internal bleeding...

1699
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,290
and bleeding from holes in the body.

1700
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,960
Father.

1701
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,420

Why did you leave the hospital?

1702
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,130
Who's there with you?

1703
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,170
I found out who pushed
Wataru off that roof.

1704
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,970
Did you go to the autorities?

1705
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,970
I wanted to handle it myself.

1706
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,620
My son.

1707
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,850
You can't control what
fate has in store for us.

1708
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,970
Father

1709
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,310
I'm sorry.

1710
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,370
What happened?

1711
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,900
Are you okay?

1712
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,770
THE HORNET

1713
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,950
47 MINUTES EARLIER

1714
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,230
Who's there with you?

1715
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,870
THE ELDER

1716
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:20,010
THE WHITE DEATH

1717
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:39,040
The real me.

1718
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,580
I built myself up from
the nothing you gave me.

1719
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:48,770
All so i could be the
one in front of you today...

1720
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:51,350
my finger on the trigger.

1721
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,860
I was the one...

1722
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,970
who deserved your attention.

1723
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:04,350
Your love.

1724
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:07,940
I'm more like you than
that little fuckup was.

1725
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,670
Check the case.

1726
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,810
Clear the train.

1727
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:11,090
All these years later...

1728
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:15,710
the burden of your betrayal
still heavy upon your heads.

1729
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:21,190
Let me relieve you of both.

1730
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:48,020
THE WATER BOTTLE

1731
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:27,150
10 MINUTES EARLIER
