<font color=#f2ffc0>Any news on my grandson?</font>

Bullet Train</font></b>

15
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:54,143
<i>Thank you for taking
the job on such short notice.</i>

16
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,839
I am ready.

17
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:57,833
You are getting
the new and improved me.

18
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,465
Since I have been working with Barry,

19
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,688
I am experiencing a calm like...

20
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:02,952
never before.

21
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,148
Never.

22
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,336
Like, I am less reactive to situations,

23
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,265
I am more accepting
of people's shortcomings.

24
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:10,540
I was a little uncertain
about coming back to work,

25
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:11,845
but it's like Barry says.

26
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,283
If you put peace out in the world,

27
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,640
you get peace back.

28
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,665
<i>I think your new
therapist might be forgetting</i>

29
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,692
<i>what you do for a living little ladybug.</i>

30
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,369
Ladybug?

31
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,963
<i>Your new operational name.</i>

32
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:22,959
Ladybug?

33
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:24,407
Really?

34
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,619
<i>You don't like it?</i>
You like it?

35
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,568
<i>I like it.</i>

36
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:27,951
Well, if you like it, alright.

37
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,713
I see what you are doing.

38
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,459
Ladybugs are supposed to be lucky.

39
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,628
<i>You don't have bad luck.</i>

40
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:40,753
Really?

41
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:44,517
My bad luck is biblical.

42
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,596
I am not even trying to kill
people and someone dies.

43
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,914
<i>That's an exaggeration.</i>

44
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,664
It is? My last job?

45
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,366
The political blackmail photos?

46
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:53,491
<i>Remember the suicidal bellboy</i>

47
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:54,930
climbed to the roof of his hotel,

48
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:56,223
<i>could not take it anymore?</i>

49
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,775
<i>Seems more like
his bad luck than yours.</i>

50
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:05,903
Hang in there buddy!

51
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,229
<i>And he didn't die.</i>

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,739
<i>Ok? You drove him to the hospital.
It's good luck.</i>

53
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,420
<i>All in how you frame it.</i>
Sure.

54
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,131
Gotta say I like it here.
I could live here.

55
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,912
I like the atmosphere,

56
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,378
the people are considerate.

57
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,431
Except for that guy.

58
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,203
Why is this job paying so well?

59
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:27,189
<i>It was supposed to be Carver's,</i>

60
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,282
<i>but he has got some stomach thing.</i>
Carver?

61
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,854
<i>You know and he doesn't do
snatch and grabs.</i>

62
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,186
I am filling in for Carver?

63
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:34,136
Yo-You picked me second to Carver?

64
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,668
<i>You said you wanted simple
for your first job back.</i>

65
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:37,870
<i>Doesn't get simpler.</i>

66
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:39,582
Shit.

67
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,120
<i>Shit what?</i>
I think I must have lost

68
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:42,583
the key when that guy bumped into me.

69
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,743
What's the number again?

70
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:45,034
<i>Five twenty three.</i>

71
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,761
Carver.

72
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,558
What an ego.

73
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,550
I mean, talk about a candidate
for self improvement.

74
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:00,350
I mean, calling in sick?

75
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,699
I mean, what is that, high school?

76
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,585
<i>I can hear that personal growth.</i>

77
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,353
I know I am being judgmental.
I need to...

78
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:08,147
work on that, but Jesus...

79
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:09,559
what a douche bag.

80
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,083
<i>You have the strangest requests,</i>

81
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:12,347
<i>firecrackers?</i>

82
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,477
I am industrious.

83
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,271
<i>Please tell me you didn't
order the sleeping powder.</i>

84
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:19,358
Nope.
<i>You almost gave that bodyguard</i>

85
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:20,614
<i>in Anchorage a heart attack.</i>

86
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,360
I have worked on the dosage.

87
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,047
<i>Take the gun.</i>

88
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:34,806

89
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:36,764
<font color=#f2ffc0>Hai.</font>

90
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,459
<font color=#f2ffc0>Thank you for using our train.</font>

91
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,834
<font color=#f2ffc0>First class is that way.</font>

92
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:43,152
<font color=#f2ffc0>Hai. Domo.</font>

93
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,916
<i>I am gonna assume
you didn't take the gun?</i>

94
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,646
Barry says every conflict
is an opportunity for a peaceful...

95
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,985
what was it?

96
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,743
<i>And your handler says
some conflicts require a gun.</i>

97
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:53,557
Shit.

98
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:03,177
Ok I am on.

99
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,435
<i>Well that's a start.</i>

100
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,795
Hey, this is nice.

101
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,123
Economy?

102
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,396
You know, I am thinking
of starting my own agency.

103
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:12,164
You know, all simple jobs, all the time.

104
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:13,709
<i>That's a terrible business plan.</i>

105
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,897
No more sociopaths, no more maniacs.

106
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:17,590
Just quality people.

107
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:19,177
Barry says it's time for some change.

108
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,316
I think he is right.

109
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,209
<i>Barry does not know
what you do for a living.</i>

110
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,528
<i>Ok, here we go.</i>

111
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,087
<i>The bullet train has 16 cars.</i>

112
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,956
<i>Ten economy, six first class,</i>

113
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:29,591
<i>and remember, only one minute
stop at every station.</i>

114
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,025
Bloody fucking hell.
Do you mind?

115
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,698
What is he, fucking blind or something?

116
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,580
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

117
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,237
Oh, come on nicking.
No it's just...

118
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:47,129
You don't have to nick the biscuits man.

119

<font color=#f2ffc0>XXX</font>

120
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:49,874
Oh no. We alright.

121
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,136
Ok cool. Thank you.
Fucking asshole.

122
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,550
Why did I do that?

123
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,286
It's like I got a compulsion or something.

124
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,624
I have to take it if I see it.

125
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:58,883
Need to talk to someone.

126
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,717
Serious.
A goldfish biscuit?

127
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:02,277
I mean, I don't, I don't understand it.

128
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,160
Ok, simple snatch and grab.

129
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:06,136
What am I snatching and or grabbing?

130
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,409
<i>A briefcase.</i>

131
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:09,675
<i>Intel says there is
a train sticker on the handle.</i>

132
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,097
Briefcases have owners.
Owners are not simple.

133
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,691
<i>And last update says</i>

134
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:15,456
<i>the owners will be in economy class.</i>

135
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,749
Owners, plural?

136
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,487
Why didn't you tell me to bring that gun?
<i>I did.</i>

137
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:21,187
<i>You chose spiritual enlightenment.</i>

138
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:23,311
<i>Please.</i>

139
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:24,819
Ticket.

140
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,354
Hold on.

141
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:28,246
No, no, no.

142
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:29,175
Receipt.

143
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,382
Shit, I think I dropped my ticket too.

144
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,596
That receipt shows
I bought a ticket though, right?

145
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:42,745
One stop.

146
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:44,479
Yep.

147
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:46,643
Dōmo arigat...

148
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:51,539
I thought they bowed here.

149
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:02,693
I PUSHED HIM. FIRST CLASS, SEAT B4

150
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,514
Sorry kid. Excuse me sorry

151
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:29,909
I am looking for...

152
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,266
You found her.

153
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:42,528
Oh lemon.

154
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:43,613
Tangerine.

155
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:44,609
You are bleeding mate.

156
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,233
Oh mate shit.

157
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:47,404
Oh shit man.
Oh fuck.

158
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,322
Who the fuck did I kill?

159
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:49,679
Get a wet one on it or something.

160
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:51,234
Oh, it's not mine mate.
Oh, it's not yours?

161
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,874
Yeah I don't bleed. I don't bleed.
Oh, in that case,

162
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,962
just leave your jacket open,
let everyone have a good old look.

163
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,344
Yeah, I want everyone to see my tie.

164
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:57,492
Yeah, yeah.
Fuck is wrong with you?

165
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,563
Pull your coat together
so no one else notices lemon.

166
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:01,797
I think they will notice
the childish code names first.

167
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:04,556
But if we are gonna stick with fruit
why not apple or orange?

168
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:06,595
So, what's in this case?

169
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,806
<i>Are we doing this?</i>

170
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,398
<i>You know what's in the case.</i>

171
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:10,595
Money.

172
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,720
It's always money.

173
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:13,538
Tangerines are sophisticated.

174
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:15,350
Oh, now he is calling a fruit sophisticated.

175
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,742
Yeah, it's cross hybridized with other fruit.

176
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,047
They are adaptable.

177
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:19,668
Like me.

178
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,568
You said, six cars in economy, say...

179
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:25,167
30 passengers per car,

180
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,665
guessing two bags per, let's see...

181
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,491
times two and you carry...

182
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,160
Yeah, no fucking way.

183
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:32,496
I am gonna find one brief...

184
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:34,343
Wait.
<i>What?</i>

185
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,704
Train sticker on the handle?
<i>Yeah.</i>

186
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,473
Holy shitbox.

187
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,591
And why am I lemon?
Because you are sour.

188
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,578
No one likes lemons.
That's bollocks mate.

189
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,513
Lemonades, lemon drops.
You got a sore throat?

190
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:48,179
Lemon meringue pie.
When was the last time

191
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,593
you ate a lemon meringue pie?
Lemon drizzle cake.

192
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,178
I am sorry, are you talking about lemons?

193
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,697
I have the case.

194
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:54,762
<i>Well, that's great.</i>

195
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:55,990
Is it?
<i>Yes.</i>

196
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:57,948
What's the catch?
<i>There is no catch.</i>

197
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,347
There is always a catch.
<i>Get off the train.</i>

198
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,164
Quite like lemons, I just hate code names.

199
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,234
Oh, well look at this.

200
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,592
Sleeping beauty.

201
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,100
Wakey-wakey.

202
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:11,733
Eggs and bakey.

203
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:14,914
Where am I?

204
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:22,867
You are safe now.

205
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,318
Your father sent us.

206
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:27,429
You idiots work for my father?
Oh, easy.

207
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,581
We could deliver you back
to your pops in a box.

208
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,720
Technically we...

209
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:32,354
are outside contractors.

210
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,120
I am Tangerine.

211
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,276
He is Lemon.

212
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:36,987
Like the fruit?

213
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:42,099
You ever watch, Thomas the tank engine?

214
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:42,991
Here we go.

215
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,888
Hey, you watch something nowadays,
what is it?

216
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,527
Nothing it's twists,

217
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:48,108
violence, drama, no message.

218
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,416
What's the point?

219
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:51,728
What are we supposed to learn?

220
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,087
Everything I learned about people

221
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,633
I learned from Thomas.

222
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:57,227
Oh, yeah? And you bring
your sticker book, did you?

223
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,728
I always bring my stickers with me,
you know that.

224
00:11:58,753 --> 00:11:59,923
Take tangerine here.

225
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:02,222
He is a Gordon, this blue one.

226
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,717
And Gordon is the strongest,
the most important,

227
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:06,601
but he doesn't always listen to others.

228
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,069
What's that now?

229
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,764
I mean, some people are Edwards.

230
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,100
Wise, kind.

231
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,154
Some are Henrys.

232
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,702
Hardworking, strong.

233
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,913
Some people are Diesel.

234
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,447
Fuck me!

235
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,924
Those are trouble.

236
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,439
You though...

237
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,607
Yeah you...

238
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:26,658
seem like a Percy.

239
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,110
Young.

240
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,370
Sweet.

241
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,339
Not all there.

242
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,633
You finished both of you?

243
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:36,744
Yeah.

244
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:37,954
Alright, your daddy,

245
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:39,286
hired us to get you out of the trouble

246
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,134
you got yourself into,
didn't you naughty boy?

247
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,593
Why are you tangerine though?

248
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:43,876
Oh, it's sophisticated mate.

249
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:44,996
Oh, fucking hell.

250
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,112
It's not important, is it?

251
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:48,685
What is important are the 17 dead
bodies we left getting you back

252
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,122
from the triad that kidnapped you

253
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:51,194
with the plans to ransom you

254
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,718
to your extremely psychotic
fucked up father.

255
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:53,952
Actually it's 16.

256
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:55,820
What's that now?

257
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,178
Sixteen kills mate.
No it was 17.

258
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:00,001
It's... 16.

259
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:01,345
Lemon, you are starting to get on my tits.

260
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,112
It's 16.

261
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:03,590
I will smash my fucking head
through a brick wall.

262
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,689
That had help your memory,

263
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:05,982
because it was 16.
What the fuck is wrong with you man?

264
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:07,174
It was 17, goddamn it!

265
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:09,523
I want to fuck strangle you now.
You mind if we do this now?

266
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:10,925
We will get it sorted.
Oh, don't worry about him.

267
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,817
Could not give a shit.
Go ahead.

268
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:16,293
One.

269
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:20,175
Two and three.

270
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,176
Five guys playing poker.

271
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,091
Keep moving!

272
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,567
Big guy.
Yeah big guy.

273
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,177
Ten.

274
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:56,270
Three assholes with swords.

275
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,325
Fucking get it.

276
00:13:58,349 --> 00:13:59,187
Fuck!

277
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,267
Why do you always bring swords?

278
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:04,127
Fucking triad.
I mean you would, would not you?

279
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,648
You son of a bitch!

280
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:10,984
I like swords actually.

281
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:14,927
Looks like it's time for a Jaffa cake.

282
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,995
How about a wagon wheel?
Oh, that works.

283
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:18,784
Swing!

284
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:25,571
Fourteen, fifteen.

285
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:30,087
And the prick on the motorcycle.

286
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:38,324
So 16.

287
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:40,159
You forgot the poor
innocent civilian on the street.

288
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:40,860
Fuck you.

289
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:41,577
Hey buddy.

290
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,993
Hey, buddy.

291
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,527
You ok? Oh my...

292
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,083
Shit.

293
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,382
That was not our fault.

294
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,933
That was not our fault. No.
Was not our fault?

295
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,104
Well, what would Thomas
the tank engine say, Lemon?

296
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,193
That's really mean.

297
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:55,208
He would say,
hey take responsibility mate.

298
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:56,770
He doesn't sound like that.

299
00:14:58,085 --> 00:15:00,256
Gonna put a little distance
between me and the owners.

300
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:01,949
<i>Are you nervous?</i>
Yeah, I am nervous.

301
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:03,952
<i>You sound nervous.</i>
Because I am in fact nervous.

302
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:05,374
Hey listen,

303
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,342
I am just gonna get off at the next stop.

304
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,569
Oh, let's have a seat then.

305
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,454
Do you know what they call
your Papushka?

306
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,479
Course I fucking do.

307
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:13,638
The White Death.

308
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:14,819
Not exactly a fruit.

309
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,049
No. There you go.

310
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:17,854
There is a story...
Stop me if you have heard it...

311
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,246
Where this woman found herself
in the unfortunate position

312
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,311
of owing your father a tidy sum of money.

313
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:23,816
Now, the issue was

314
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,066
it took her some time
to acquire this money.

315
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,251
But she did pay it back
five minutes late, didn't she?

316
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,978
Yeah, what did he do?
Cut their arm off.

317
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,566
Fucking hell!
Yeah.

318
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,337
He said she owed him a finger
for every minute.

319
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:37,297
Anyway, he is not a monster.

320
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:38,649
He didn't make her sit
through it five times.

321
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:39,794
He just cut once didn't he?

322
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,627
This is too easy.
<i>You are over thinking it.</i>

323
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,422
You are under thinking it.
<i>It's not a word.</i>

324
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,430
Yes, it is.
<i>Really?</i>

325
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:49,398
I think it is.
<i>Did you Google it?</i>

326
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:50,457
Doesn't matter.

327
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,036
<i>What would Barry say?</i>

328
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,591
Barry would say,
a negative outlook

329
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,189
leads to a negative outcome.

330
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,771
<i>How much do you pay him again?</i>

331
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,573
Our job is to keep you safe,

332
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:02,347
and to recover the briefcase
with the ransom money inside.

333
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:05,229
And I plan on completing my job
and keeping...

334
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:07,001
Lemon.

335
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,527
Where is the briefcase?

336
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,879
Oh, I stashed it.

337
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,434
The case lemon.

338
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,674
Go get me the fucking case.

339
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,144
You are a liability, you know?

340
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:18,637
To my father.

341
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:24,226
He doesn't need a reason
to kill people like you.

342
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,708
He needs a reason not to.

343
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,575
Does he have one?

344
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,739
That's fucking confusing.

345
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:35,470
Hello?

346
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,015
<i>Do you have White Death's son?</i>

347
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,071
What, you mean this dickhead
with the silly face tattoos?

348
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,635
Yeah, he is sat right here.
<i>And the briefcase?</i>

349
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,791
Yes, of course,
I have got the case.

350
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,665
<i>You will both deboard at Kyoto station.</i>

351
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,064
<i>Then your business with him
will be concluded.</i>

352
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,522
It was just here.

353
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:02,788
Well, it's not anymore.

354
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,660
We need to find the person
who took that case.

355
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,769
Maybe you are right.

356
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:11,535
Maybe my luck is starting to turn.

357
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:39,614
You.

358
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:41,926
Yes.

359
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:43,895
Me.

360
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:45,719
But you...

361
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:47,001
are Yuuichi Kimura.

362
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:48,885
And you came here

363
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,174
to kill me.

364
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,017
My parents call me Malenkiy Prince.

365
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:56,343
That means little prince.

366
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,298
Obviously, they wanted a boy.

367
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,177
You are going to hear the whole story,

368
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:07,741
or you will be...

369
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:08,909
very...

370
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:10,317
Very sorry.

371
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,140
It's the hospital.

372
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:17,371
Hang on.

373
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:18,430
Hi.

374
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,695
Yes, you can see the boy now.

375
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,423
<i>Good.</i>

376
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,906
<i>If you don't hear
from me every ten minutes</i>

377
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,187
or if I don't answer this phone
when you call...

378
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,305
I want you...

379
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,609
to go in there and kill...

380
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,992
I am sorry, what's your boy's name again?

381
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:38,250
Wataru.

382
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:39,231
Right.

383
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:40,610
Right.

384
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:42,070
Kill Wataru.

385
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,149
Aren't we glad we waited?

386
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:48,771
We got his son.
That was our job.

387
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,548
Our job was to come back with his son,

388
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:52,101
and his 10 million dollars.

389
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:54,094
Three words describe
our situation right now.

390
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,051
Do you know what they are?

391
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,301
Deal. Saved his son.

392
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,815
Family is more important than money right?

393
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,211
Do you honestly not know,

394
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,500
who the White Death is?
Yeah.

395
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,360
I know the White Death.
You just told me five minutes ago.

396
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:06,176
He cuts off arms puts them...
Why do I even bother forwarding you,

397
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,113
the briefings?

398
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,123
I do not know.

399
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,322
The Japanese underworld

400
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:17,744
used to be ruled
by a man named Minegishi.

401
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:20,564
Now Minegishi,

402
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,925
was one brutal bastard.

403
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:25,041
But he was old school, you know?

404
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,234
Tradition and loyalty
was all that mattered to him.

405
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:29,859
When you were in, you were in.
You were like family.

406
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:31,570
He treated you like
you were one of his own.

407
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,910
Then out of the blue...

408
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:35,605
comes this 6 foot fucking
6 geezer from Russia.

409
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,728
Whispers that he was exiled from
the Russian mafia

410
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:40,360
or that he was ex-KGB.

411
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:43,056
No one really knows the truth.

412
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,631
But what is known...

413
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,596
is this Russian...

414
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,010
Worked his way up the ranks.

415
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,343
Bit by bit, kill by kill.

416
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,354
And very, very fucking quickly

417
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:58,716
became one of Minegishi's
closest advisors.

418
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:00,938
And those loyal to him said,

419
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,336
hold your horses.

420
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:04,383
This geezer ain't the full ticket.

421
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:05,969
He ain't to be trusted.

422
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,133
He is dangerous they said.

423
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:10,464
A modern plague they said.

424
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,610
A White Death.

425
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,477
So, sure enough they were right.

426
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,342
He made his own alliance.

427
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:21,115
His own gang.

428
00:20:28,196 --> 00:20:29,347
And what did he do?

429
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:31,188
Stabbed him in the back.

430
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:33,094
I mean metaphorically.

431
00:20:33,218 --> 00:20:34,738
Blew his fucking brains out didn't he?

432
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,503
He wiped the name Minegishi
off the face of the earth

433
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:50,063
in one single night.

434
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,840
And made an empire
worthy of the White Death.

435
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:58,078
So,

436
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,481
let me put this bluntly.

437
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:02,653
There is this soulless psychotic leader

438
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,129
with the largest criminal
organization on the planet

439
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,510
shoved right inside our fucking ass cheeks.

440
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,906
That motherfucker is definitely a Diesel,
then isn't he?

441
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,115
If you mention Thomas
the tank engine one more time,

442
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,584
I am gonna shoot you in the fucking face.

443
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,521
Ok, ok, if-if he is such a badass,

444
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,043
how come he hired two random operators

445
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,387
Instead of getting his son back himself?

446
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,517
Because if you actually read the briefings,
you would know that he had a wife.

447
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,910
What he had a wife?
Yes.

448
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:27,482
She was the most important
thing in his life,

449
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:28,427
<i>and she died.</i>

450
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:29,950
Drunk driving accident or some shit.

451
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:33,994
And now he is at the compound
and he ain't left since.

452
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,955
An unnamed locomotive
might say there is a lesson

453
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,439
to be learned.
Listen and he didn't hire

454
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,111
two random operators Lemon.

455
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,375
But no he asked for the best.

456
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,737
He asked for the two responsible
for the Bolivia job.

457
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:49,838
He asked for pros

458
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,573
who would not fuck up.

459
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,018
Three words Lemon.

460
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,346
We are...
Fucked.

461
00:21:59,338 --> 00:22:00,658
What do you want?

462
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:03,344
People think that
I am just some young girl.

463
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:07,758
Someone is future wife or...

464
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,133
Future mother.

465
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:14,384
But I am not in someone else's story.

466
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,064
You are all in mine.

467
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,073
The fuck does that have to do with me?

468
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:23,744
You work for the most
feared boss in the city.

469
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:24,970
The White Death.

470
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,211
Oh, deny it all you want.

471
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:29,582
But you work for someone

472
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:31,542
who works for someone else,
et cetera, et cetera,

473
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,552
and it all falls under the same person.

474
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,228
You delivered a briefcase two days ago

475
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:38,982
to one of the White Death's associates...

476
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:41,370
And I saw my opportunity.

477
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,631
Follow the case and find the White Death.

478
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,412
Don't know what you think
I can do for you.

479
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,637
Oh, that is my favorite part of the story.

480
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,777
You are going to kill him for me.

481
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,028
How the fuck...

482
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:57,586
am I going to kill the White Death?

483
00:22:57,946 --> 00:22:59,051
You will see.

484
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:02,606
Oh, look at that.

485
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,418
We are right on schedule.

486
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:08,707
Sit back, relax a little bit.
You look so tense.

487
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,260
We rescued his fucking son?

488
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,874
We find the fucker
who took the briefcase,

489
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:28,096
make things right,

490
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:29,760
be like it never happened.
Never happened.

491
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:38,555
You still got that vest on you?

492
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,898
Oh no, vests give you
a false sense of security.

493
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,637
You might like, get shot in the neck.

494
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:44,405
Yeah, it also stops you from
getting shot in the chest,

495
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,621
but, I guess you missed that
episode of Thomas, did you?

496
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:50,200
I really must have, because
that sounds dark as shit.

497
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:52,700
Nut up or shut up bro.

498
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:07,851
Well so,

499
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:09,407
slight change of plans.

500
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,388
First his wife, now his son?

501
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:22,678
That's a lot of white deaths.

502
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,462
<font color="#f2ffc0">I want you to be strong, son.</font>

503
00:24:33,946 --> 00:24:35,571
<font color="#f2ffc0">Do you understand?
Sí.</font>

504
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,399
<font color="#f2ffc0">Be strong.</font>

505
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:36,654
<font color="#f2ffc0">My heart.</font>

506
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,736
<font color="#f2ffc0">No!</font>

507
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:26,392
<font color="#f2ffc0">Find me the son of a bitch who did this.</font>

508
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,045
<font color="#f2ffc0">You lucky son of a bitch.</font>

509
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:29,561
You stabbed me?

510
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:32,818
You ruined my life.

511
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:34,318
I don't even know you!

512
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,588
I come here for revenge.

513
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:44,385
The assassin who killed El Saguaro.

514
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:45,726
Killed my wife.

515
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,276
<font color="#f2ffc0">But fate made this
a two for one special.</font>

516
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,142
Can we just...

517
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:00,667
take a timeout here?

518
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,142
Talk this out?

519
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:03,962
I will never stop coming for you.

520
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:04,884
What?

521
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,268
Run as far as you like.

522
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:07,752
I will find you.

523
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:08,790
Why?

524
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:11,468
And I will ruin your life
the way you ruined mine.

525
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:13,993
Dude, I don't even know you!

526
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,216
<font color="#f2ffc0">My heart.</font>

527
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,623
What the...

528
00:29:49,302 --> 00:29:50,248
Really?

529
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:56,398
Let this be a lesson in the toxicity of anger.

530
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:00,203
Venezuela,

531
00:30:00,227 --> 00:30:01,468
Uruguay,

532
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,093
Barcelona.

533
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,403
Who are you?

534
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,768
Alright mate, try these.

535
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,338
They are the Momonga glasses.

536
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,807
The fuck is a Momonga?

537
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,760
Comes on after Thomas every Thursday.
Ok.

538
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:53,869
Ok.
It's good.

539
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:55,721
Just like that.
He should look asleep, you know.

540
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,229
There, like that.
Like that? Right.

541
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,747
Wasabi.

542
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:10,180
We got to make sure he doesn't
step a foot off this train.

543
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:11,232
You see the case,

544
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:12,387
deal with whoever has it.

545
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:14,861
Alright, how do I do that?
Talk to him or like...

546
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:16,246
talk to him?

547
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,441
I don't know, why don't you tell him
about the story about

548
00:31:18,466 --> 00:31:19,645
how Gordon met Percy

549
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,176
and how Percy is now bleeding
from his fucking eye sockets!

550
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:26,469
He means kill him.

551
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:31,266
Fuck. Dammit.

552
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:42,474
Well, excuse me.

553
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,084
You are fucking excused.

554
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:47,998
Arigatou.

555
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,995
Konnichiwa.

556
00:32:07,465 --> 00:32:08,331
Joburg.

557
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,416
I am sorry buddy.

558
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:21,200
Give...

559
00:32:21,843 --> 00:32:22,697
give it!

560
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,289
Shit balls.

561
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:31,850
That was not a minute.

562
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:46,941
I missed my stop.

563
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:47,861
<i>Why?</i>

564
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:49,832
Because god hates me.
<i>No, she doesn't.</i>

565
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,816
<i>Do you still have the case?</i>
Yeah, I stashed it.

566
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:53,116
<i>Get off at the next stop.</i>

567
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:54,859
It sounds so easy when you say it.

568
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,991
Does the name El cigarillo
mean anything to you?

569
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:03,344
<i>El Saguaro?</i>

570
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:05,720
<i>The cartel boss?</i>
Yeah, why does that sound so familiar?

571
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:07,664
<i>He was in the wedding
you infiltrated in Mexico.</i>

572
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:09,563
Tequila?

573
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,133
<i>You were the cocktail server.</i>

574
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,166
The groom.

575
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:16,327
I knew I recognized that guy.

576
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:17,807
I am really good with faces.

577
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:18,832
<i>Wait, what guy?</i>

578
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:20,361
Sorry.

579
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:21,584
Be right back.

580
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:23,062
The guy who stabbed me.
I spilled wine on his suit.

581
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:24,984
He is dead now.
<i>You killed the wolf?</i>

582
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,063
It was an accident.

583
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,513
I am really gonna have to process

584
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,477
my part in the incident on Monday.

585
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:30,288
Shit.

586
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:31,803
Fuck! No.

587
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:33,763
<i>Shit, fuck, what?</i>

588
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:35,792
Remember those two wackos
from the Bolivia job?

589
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,457
Killed all those people?
<i>The twins?</i>

590
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,213
Yeah, I am not so sure they are twins.

591
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:40,989
<i>Stop it.
Everyone knows they are twins.</i>

592
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,432
Well, one of them is walking
towards me right now.

593
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,318
I think I saw the other on the platform.
<font color="#f2ffc0">Occupied!</font>

594
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:47,936
<i>Well, now we know who
the owners of the case are.</i>

595
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:49,772
See, this is exactly what I am talking about.

596
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:51,583
We have to have a hard
discussion about the caliber

597
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:52,910
of people we are surrounding ourselves with.

598
00:33:52,935 --> 00:33:54,211
<i>Why are you whispering?</i>

599
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,011
Hello.
<i>The white death would like to know</i>

600
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:03,934
<i>why you stepped off train.</i>
Wanted some fresh air.

601
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,727
<i>Your orders were to stay on the train.</i>

602
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:09,563
I didn't realize I was getting a
babysitter to come cut my bollocks.

603
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:10,998
I am a professional.

604
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:13,570
We are making sure the case
and his son are perfectly safe.

605
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:15,812
Can I please go do my job now?

606
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:17,327
<i>If something has gone wrong...</i>
Oh, very kind of you.

607
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:18,499
Thank you very much.

608
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:25,176
Fuck me!

609
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,580
Jesus Christ.

610
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:28,805
It's very rude, talking on the phone,
on the train.

611
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:29,737
In Japan.

612
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:31,706
This rude enough for you, fucking prick?

613
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,067
Shove that fucking hat up your
fucking asshole you hear me?

614
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:39,893
Fuck this job.

615
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:41,931
I knew we should have got
an upgrade, fuck all.

616
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:43,768
I beg your pardon, sorry. I...

617
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:46,830
Was not aware there was a
young lady present. Apologize.

618
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:49,097
Yeah, you didn't happen to see someone

619
00:34:49,122 --> 00:34:50,839
come by with a silver briefcase, did you?

620
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,718
There is a little train sticker
by the handle.

621
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,562
Actually, yeah.

622
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:58,288
A man with black framed glasses had it.

623
00:34:58,313 --> 00:34:59,414
He went that way.

624
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:04,220
Thank you Love.

625
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:07,569
That fucking bastard.

626
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,491
Come on.

627
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:20,568
Hi.

628
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:22,248
There is a gun under this...

629
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:24,419
This is the quiet car.

630
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:27,423
Gotta use your small
inside voice in here son.

631
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:32,031
There is a gun underneath this table

632
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:33,446
pointed right at you, so I would...

633
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,585
I can't really hear what you are saying.

634
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,664
There is a gun...

635
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,607
I am just fucking with you mate.

636
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,368
It's been a long time since Johannesburg.

637
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:45,006
Yeah.

638
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:46,751
Who the fuck are you?

639
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:47,633
Really?

640
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:49,438
You don't remember me?

641
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:53,795
You look like every white
homeless man I have ever seen.

642
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:54,841
Ok.

643
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,490
Well, I have something
I believe you are looking...

644
00:35:58,646 --> 00:35:59,771
Really? You don't remember me?

645
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:01,356
I am sorry mate.
I remember Johannesburg,

646
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,502
but I don't remember you, alright?

647
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:03,715
You shot me.

648
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:06,676
I shoot a lot of people.
You shot me twice.

649
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,285
Well, you also have a shoot able face.

650
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:13,746
I know you are black framed glasses.

651
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,062
The cheeky fucker
who took our briefcase.

652
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:18,414
Yes.

653
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,825
Yes, I am.

654
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,630
You know, I have done a lot of
personal work since Joburg.

655
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,755
I have forgiven, I have moved on.

656
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,713
I have learned that
with any potential conflict

657
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,325
there is an opportunity for growth,

658
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:32,145
a path to a peaceful outcome.

659
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:35,839
Interesting.
Who is that?

660
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,175
I have no idea.

661
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,599
How did you know that was there?

662
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:52,705
Didn't I mention?

663
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,682
I have always been lucky.

664
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:01,493
It was then, that I took a long
hard look into the mirror.

665
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,110
And you know what?

666
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:05,297
Buddy, I didn't like what I saw.

667
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:06,379
Nope.

668
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:07,467
Nada.

669
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:10,602
Until I did.

670
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,033
You know?

671
00:37:15,977 --> 00:37:18,041
Between us now, sits a wall.

672
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:20,971
But it's an illusion.

673
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:23,980
For within every wall,

674
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:25,713
awaits a window...

675
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:27,150
Oh wait it's...

676
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:28,947
it's a door.
Real quick...

677
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,210
every day is a fucking headache
with you, innit?

678
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:32,986
Right.

679
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:35,231
You and your partner...

680
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:36,536
Look, I am Lemon, he is Tangerine.

681
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,646
Ok Lemon... like the fruit?

682
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:39,732
Blessings.

683
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:42,707
What's your plan here?

684
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,876
Here is the plan.
I give you back your case,

685
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,923
you don't kill me.

686
00:37:45,948 --> 00:37:47,453
You give your case to your employer,

687
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:48,575
he doesn't kill you.

688
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,442
You are alive, I am alive,
everyone is happy.

689
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,887
Win-win, don't you think?
How do you know...

690
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:56,443
whoever hired you won't
kill you for failing your job?

691
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:58,378
Lose-lose. No happy.

692
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:00,017
Man, I just want to get off this train,

693
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:02,112
go see a zen garden
and some shit, you know?

694
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:06,087
I would like to accept your offer.

695
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:07,930
Great. But then you went
and killed someone.

696
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:08,906
Didn't you?

697
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,193
How did you know?
Was not exactly subtle.

698
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:20,705
It was an accident.
Tragic.

699
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,943
That's a...
Bizarre even.

700
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:23,871
Cool story bro, but...

701
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:26,450
I think you had your own plans of
getting out of here with that case.

702
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,182
No, no.
Pinning a body on us.

703
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:30,096
Hoping the White Death is so busy

704
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:32,018
cutting off our arms instead
of cutting off our fingers.

705
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:34,174
It's like Thomas
the Tank Engine always says.

706
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,018
Simple is better.
The kids' show?

707
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,379
Yes, the fucking kid, man...

708
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,838
I learned everything
about people from Thomas.

709
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:41,043
Everything.
Really?

710
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,441
That's how I can read people like
you so well,

711
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:43,866
and you are Diesel.

712
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,956
I am not Diesel.
You are the dieselest Diesel

713
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:48,171
that ever fucking dieseled
Not even close.

714
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,699
That I have ever seen in my life man.

715
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:51,845
Because Diesels bluff, they go too far.

716
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,963
Man, I am trying to get Diesel
out of my life, you know?

717
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,151
If there was a gun under this table yeah,

718
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,237
I would be as dead as that kid over there.

719
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:26,400
Nope.

720
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:33,383
You mother fucker.

721
00:39:37,785 --> 00:39:39,938
Have the courage to listen.

722
00:39:57,076 --> 00:39:58,366
Come on Joburg.

723
00:39:58,732 --> 00:39:59,591
No.

724
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,836
Shot number three.

725
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,986
No, no, no. I ain't got
the time or the patience,

726
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,446
let alone the interest.

727
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,095
Fucking hell.

728
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:22,241
Are you following me?

729
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,564
Stop!

730
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,306
Asshole.

731
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:52,749
I will call the conductor!

732
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:54,355
Eat a bag of dicks lady.

733
00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:55,642
I am sorry, I am sorry.

734
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:56,813
I am, I am working on it.

735
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,924
I am not a Diesel, you are a Diesel.

736
00:41:55,528 --> 00:41:56,887
There is another body here.

737
00:41:56,927 --> 00:41:57,966
<i>Of course there is.</i>

738
00:41:57,991 --> 00:42:00,495
Not my fault and I believe
it's The Son of the White Death.

739
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,302
<i>Did the twins I.D. you?</i>
Did you hear what I said?

740
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:03,996
White Death. Death. Death.

741
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:06,423
Snatch and grab my ass.

742
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:08,599
There is someone else
doing a job on this train.

743
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:10,315
<i>The twins. We know that.</i>

744
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,074
Again, not twins.

745
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,928
Loonies, but not twins.

746
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,311
They are here for the kid but...

747
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,233
somebody killed the kid.

748
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:24,576
The guy with the knife.
<i>The wolf.</i>

749
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:28,254
He said he came here for revenge.

750
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,636
He just happened to run into me,

751
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:31,371
because of course he did.

752
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,020
Now, get this.

753
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:36,426
The kid was poisoned in the same way

754
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,268
as El Sbarro was at the wedding.

755
00:42:38,424 --> 00:42:39,854
<i>It's El Saguaro.</i>

756
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,362
<i>The same killer?</i>
Yeah.

757
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:45,440
I am like MacGyver.

758
00:42:48,662 --> 00:42:49,474
Fuck!

759
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,813
All of Japan is in terror.

760
00:42:57,998 --> 00:43:00,072
Because a poisonous snake was stolen.

761
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:04,255
Boom slang snakes.
Have a very strong poison.

762
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:05,488
When they bite...

763
00:43:05,512 --> 00:43:07,145
it can cause internal bleeding...

764
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,710
and bleeding from holes in the body.

765
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:10,671
Oh shit.

766
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,870
<i>What are you doing?</i>

767
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:14,554
<i>What's wrong?</i>

768
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:16,207
Fuck this man.

769
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:18,114
Fuck Carver.

770
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:21,973
Shit.

771
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:24,856
Oh, thank god.

772
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:25,834
For a minute there...

773
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,797
Jesus Christ, you had a bit of a bosh pal.

774
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,718
Alright.

775
00:43:30,743 --> 00:43:32,244
Five stations to Kyoto.

776
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,343
Better get ticketyboo.

777
00:43:38,278 --> 00:43:40,903
Would you describe me as someone
who lives in perpetual anxiety?

778
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:42,113
<i>No, no.</i>

779
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,465
Fuck nuts.

780
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,941
<i>And if it was not clear, I meant yes.</i>

781
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:46,406
The conductor.
I don't have a ticket.

782
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,038
<i>Not sure that's your biggest concern.</i>

783
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:50,272
You don't understand,
this guy is like crissfucking angel.

784
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:51,572
He pops up everywhere.

785
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:53,506
He slows me down, Tangerine catches me,

786
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:54,773
I am dead.

787
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:55,913
Dead.

788
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:56,984
Dead...

789
00:43:58,837 --> 00:43:59,742
Hold on.

790
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,640
Hey bro.

791
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,403
Want to make an easy 200 bucks?

792
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:16,122
Is this like a...
Like a sex thing?

793
00:44:20,348 --> 00:44:21,262
Nope.

794
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:23,363
Oh, ok.
I was... I was kidding.

795
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:24,406
Yeah, what's up?

796
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:25,473
What do you need bro?

797
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,857
<i>Momomon!</i>

798
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,175
Alright, game is up big boy.

799
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:10,082
Where is the case?

800
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:12,323
Tell me and I promise,

801
00:45:12,347 --> 00:45:13,339
I will only shoot you enough...

802
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:16,409
Is-is this the sex stuff?

803
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:21,357
Twat!

804
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:22,552
Shit.

805
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,450
I-I do love an accent.

806
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:32,654
Come on.

807
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,303
Oops.

808
00:45:43,586 --> 00:45:44,858
Picture it.

809
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,632
Picture what?

810
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,015
Well the man.

811
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:49,400
Watching your son.

812
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,151
I wonder how he will do it.

813
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:53,989
Maybe...

814
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:55,815
<i>a pillow to the face.</i>

815
00:45:56,776 --> 00:45:58,440
Or maybe something clever.

816
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,040
Like an air bubble in the IV.

817
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:06,001
No, no. You hold onto it.

818
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:09,011
The innocent young girl act
doesn't really get you very far

819
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:10,546
if you are holding a loaded gun.

820
00:46:16,976 --> 00:46:18,281
Put it on speaker.

821
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:21,810
<font color="#f2ffc0">Father.
Yuuichi?</font>

822
00:46:22,053 --> 00:46:23,102
<font color="#f2ffc0">Why did you leave...</font>

823
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,694
<font color="#f2ffc0">the hospital?</font>

824
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:28,063
Be honest.

825
00:46:29,097 --> 00:46:30,247
<font color="#f2ffc0">Who is there with you?</font>

826
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:34,446
<font color="#f2ffc0">I found out who pushed Wataru...</font>

827
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:36,445
<font color="#f2ffc0">off that roof.</font>

828
00:46:37,523 --> 00:46:39,233
<font color="#f2ffc0">Did you go to the authorities?</font>

829
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:41,770
<font color="#f2ffc0">I wanted to handle it myself.</font>

830
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:46,356
<font color="#f2ffc0">My son.</font>

831
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,482
<font color="#f2ffc0">You can't control what fate,
has in store for us.</font>

832
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,545
<font color="#f2ffc0">Father.</font>

833
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:53,958
<font color="#f2ffc0">I am sorry.</font>

834
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:57,943
We are not finished.

835
00:46:58,174 --> 00:46:59,474
You are going to sit here

836
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:02,050
and you are going to go through
every combination

837
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:03,611
until you open up that case.

838
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:04,601
Kid,

839
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:05,735
that could take...

840
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,927
No, no. It won't.

841
00:47:07,487 --> 00:47:08,995
I'd start with the low numbers.

842
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:10,214
Just a thought.

843
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:12,092
You know...

844
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:27,020
Fuck me!

845
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:30,403
There he is.
He-he got by me.

846
00:47:30,785 --> 00:47:32,205
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

847
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:36,550
Well, I guess our best option now is...

848
00:47:36,574 --> 00:47:38,351
bring the White Death
the man who killed his son.

849
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:39,689
Yeah, but glasses didn't do it.

850
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:41,042
I could give a rat's ass.
No I am telling you.

851
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,467
I read him.
He is not the type mate.

852
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,057
I will tell you what, do you like your arms?

853
00:47:44,131 --> 00:47:45,210
You know I like my arms.

854
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:47,113
You know someone is got
to take the blame, don't they?

855
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:50,851
That's you or me?
You or me?

856
00:47:52,626 --> 00:47:54,781
Shit, that asshole stole my phone.

857
00:47:55,094 --> 00:47:56,319
You kidding.
And my gun, Lucille.

858
00:47:56,344 --> 00:47:57,679
Oh, come on.
That's my favorite gun.

859
00:47:57,704 --> 00:47:59,469
Son of a bitch.
Fuck about...

860
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,265
Right, what?
<i>Step off the train at the next stop</i>

861
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,735
<i>with the briefcase and the Son.</i>
Well, hang on mate,

862
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,994
didn't we say Kyoto?
<i>You will still depart at Kyoto.</i>

863
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,736
<i>The White Death wants to make sure</i>

864
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,291
<i>you are being honest about situation.</i>

865
00:48:10,316 --> 00:48:11,635
Well, this is a waste of our t...

866
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:13,862
Alright, alright.

867
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:15,582
We just have to prove
we have a case we don't have

868
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,535
and a live son instead of a dead one.

869
00:48:19,716 --> 00:48:20,847
What are you thinking?

870
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,980
The old punch and Judy.
The old punch and Judy.

871
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,204
You were all told to exit the train.

872
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:09,884
Yeah?

873
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:12,073
Well unlike you, I am a professional.

874
00:49:12,098 --> 00:49:13,976
I wanted to make sure
it were not some yakuza trap,

875
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:16,558
but clearly not it's some
fucking '80s dance off, innit?

876
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:19,069
Where is your twin?

877
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:20,227
Tangerine?

878
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:21,487
I am Tangerine.

879
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,406
Lemon is keepin' the case safe.

880
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,992
And the White Death's son?

881
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:27,125
Yeah he is there.

882
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:31,739
Wave to your fucking fans Princess.

883
00:49:33,143 --> 00:49:35,063
He is a fucking happy chappy, isn't he?

884
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:37,417
But, I have got to pop on the train,

885
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,054
you know, ten seconds left, so Tara.

886
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:42,149
We will stick to the plan, depart in Kyoto.

887
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:43,635
Do us a favor,

888
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:45,700
get the fuck off my back, will you?

889
00:49:55,562 --> 00:49:56,270
Ok.

890
00:49:58,365 --> 00:49:59,122
Ok.

891
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:04,908
Ok.

892
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:07,705
Ok.

893
00:50:09,877 --> 00:50:11,397
I mean, that could not have gone better.

894
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:12,713
Yeah, let's hope they buy it.

895
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:14,365
We need to find that glasses twat,

896
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,828
like, right to the fuck now.

897
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:20,445
I am gonna go up, you go down,
double back when you are done.

898
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,682
If you see him, fucking deal with him.

899
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:22,648
Yeah?
Yeah.

900
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:27,554
Up is...
That way.

901
00:50:27,578 --> 00:50:28,680
Towards Tokyo.
Right.

902
00:50:28,704 --> 00:50:30,073
Departing trains are always moving down.

903
00:50:30,098 --> 00:50:31,383
And look, be careful.

904
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:33,185
Something else is going on here.

905
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:33,797
Yeah?

906
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,403
Yeah, I still feel like
there is a Diesel lurking about.

907
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,333
I swear to god, what did I say?

908
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,142
What did I say?

909
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,231
I said I will fucking

910
00:50:41,256 --> 00:50:42,069
shoot you in...
Shoot me in the face.

911
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:42,935
That's right.
Yeah.

912
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,479
Thomas still taught me how
to see people, read them for real.

913
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,442
Yeah.

914
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:48,075
And I am never wrong, am I?

915
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:48,794
No.

916
00:50:48,848 --> 00:50:50,807
Glasses, he is not our guy.

917
00:50:52,105 --> 00:50:52,924
Ok.

918
00:50:56,738 --> 00:50:57,918
You shoot first...

919
00:50:58,364 --> 00:50:59,807
and come up with the answers later.

920
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:05,195
I always do.

921
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:08,966
And Lemon?

922
00:51:09,774 --> 00:51:10,742
Yeah man?

923
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:13,521
You be careful too.

924
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:20,538
Oh, man, when this train is a rock in',
don't come a knock in' right?

925
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:09,614
Seven more minutes,

926
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:11,176
and I am off this train.

927
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:12,674
<i>Are you hiding in a bathroom?</i>

928
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,954
Yeah. Have you tried these smart toilets?
They are...

929
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:18,175
a pleasure to the senses.

930
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:21,747
If I had one in the chamber, I
would rock this bad boy right now.

931
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,020
<i>Boundaries.
We need boundaries.</i>

932
00:52:31,322 --> 00:52:32,301
Holy shit.

933
00:52:36,643 --> 00:52:37,752
Holy shit.

934
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,157
Oh there.

935
00:52:48,745 --> 00:52:50,179
Oh, look at that.

936
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:52,743
I knew my luck would rub off on you.

937
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,544
Fuck.

938
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,039
What the fuck are you doing?

939
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,236
I am doing the same thing

940
00:53:10,261 --> 00:53:12,330
that I did to the gun in your hand.

941
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,565
I am just making things interesting.

942
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:20,823
I am hedging my bets, you could say.

943
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:22,003
Fuck.

944
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:24,781
If the gun doesn't kill him, the case will.

945
00:53:24,899 --> 00:53:27,268
This thing could have blown up
in my hand at any point.

946
00:53:27,816 --> 00:53:28,709
No. No.

947
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:30,941
It's inert unless you fire it.

948
00:53:31,511 --> 00:53:33,433
But don't fire it, you know what I mean?

949
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:35,367
Unlike what I...

950
00:53:35,391 --> 00:53:36,535
put in this...

951
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,745
briefcase here this is very...

952
00:53:40,254 --> 00:53:41,706
Well, this is not inert at all.

953
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:42,745
This is...

954
00:53:45,386 --> 00:53:47,028
Did you know that there have been

955
00:53:47,053 --> 00:53:50,190
31 attempts on the White Death's life

956
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:52,219
from within his own organization?

957
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,867
Each one,

958
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:56,180
he executed with their own weapon.

959
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,196
Do you see what I am getting at here?

960
00:54:01,086 --> 00:54:02,736
Kimura, I brought you here to fail.

961
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:06,013
You push my son off a roof.

962
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:08,041
Right.
Bring me to this train,

963
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:10,721
frame me as an assassin,

964
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:14,312
here to kill the White Death,
and use my gun

965
00:54:15,437 --> 00:54:17,132
that will blow up in his face?

966
00:54:17,725 --> 00:54:18,952
Very good.

967
00:54:19,794 --> 00:54:21,374
Very, very good.

968
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:23,051
It's a stupid plan.

969
00:54:24,242 --> 00:54:25,395
It is...

970
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,176
A brilliant plan.

971
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,721
Occupied.

972
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:41,138
<i>You remember that mob surgeon
that died mid heart operation?</i>

973
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,525
Yeah, he had a stroke, right?

974
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,895
<i>No, that was the official cover.</i>

975
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:46,009
<i>He was poisoned.</i>

976
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:47,736
<i>The assassin goes by the name
of the hornet.</i>

977
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:50,259
Oh, my god!

978
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:54,916
<i>He used boom slang snake venom.</i>

979
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:57,705
<i>It congeals the blood, making
you bleed out of every orifice.</i>

980
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:01,262
<i>If the antidote isn't administered
within 30 seconds, you are dead.</i>

981
00:55:02,203 --> 00:55:03,121
<i>Fun fact.</i>

982
00:55:03,145 --> 00:55:05,063
<i>The same poison that was used on...</i>

983
00:55:05,087 --> 00:55:06,137
El Sagardo.

984
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:07,250
<i>It's El...</i>

985
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,527
<i>Saguaro.</i>

986
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:10,830
What is the hornet doing on this train?

987
00:55:10,855 --> 00:55:11,463
<i>Well,</i>

988
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:12,797
<i>whatever deal was made,</i>

989
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,447
<i>it was not done through
the normal channels.</i>

990
00:55:14,472 --> 00:55:16,103
<i>There is something else going on here.</i>

991
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,971
It's still occupied, lady.

992
00:55:22,448 --> 00:55:24,566
The wolf must have figured out
who the hornet is,

993
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:26,818
came here for revenge for his wife,
his boss,

994
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,170
came here to whack the hornet.

995
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:29,748
<i>Oh, my god, did you just say whack?</i>

996
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:30,965
I did. I am bringing it back.

997
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,614
<i>No, it needs to stay where it was.</i>

998
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:34,076
If I can figure out who the hornet is,

999
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:35,966
I can give him to Lemon and Tangerine

1000
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:37,614
so they don't whack me.
<i>Really?</i>

1001
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:39,188
Se... you see what I did there?

1002
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:40,778
<i>You are really proud of yourself,
are not you?</i>

1003
00:55:41,563 --> 00:55:44,308
Geez, they are usually so polite here.

1004
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,831
Lady, I am so...

1005
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:50,738
That's cool.

1006
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:52,070
Come here...

1007
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:54,298
Bastard!

1008
00:55:57,191 --> 00:56:00,109
Come here, you you dirty fucking scum!

1009
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:05,107
You bastard.

1010
00:56:24,308 --> 00:56:25,511
Wait wait wait wait wait.

1011
00:56:25,808 --> 00:56:27,004
I know who killed the kid.

1012
00:56:27,029 --> 00:56:28,128
I could not give a rat's ass.

1013
00:56:28,153 --> 00:56:29,722
Where is my fucking case?

1014
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:43,058
<font color="#f2ffc0">Hello.</font>
Yeah.

1015
00:56:53,232 --> 00:56:55,529
<font color="#f2ffc0">Excuse me.</font>
Oh, I am so sorry. Excuse me.

1016
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:04,240
<font color="#f2ffc0">Do you want something?</font>

1017
00:57:04,265 --> 00:57:06,000
Oh no, thank you.
We are ok.

1018
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:08,502
Oh, I-I would love a bottle of water.

1019
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,996
<font color="#f2ffc0">This one we have.</font>

1020
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:13,808
You know what? Do you have...

1021
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:15,023
anything sparkling?

1022
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,319
With bubbles?
<font color="#f2ffc0">Hai.</font>

1023
00:57:20,373 --> 00:57:21,884
That's the one. Thank y...

1024
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:22,916
Dōmo arigatō.

1025
00:57:23,035 --> 00:57:24,078
<font color="#f2ffc0">You are welcome.</font>
Yeah.

1026
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:25,483
Oh, yeah.

1027
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,597
Bro, I just remembered I gave all
my money to that guy to wear my...

1028
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:30,787
hat and glasses.

1029
00:57:31,412 --> 00:57:32,358
Could you?

1030
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,180
How much for the bottle of water Love?

1031
00:57:41,547 --> 00:57:42,633
<font color="#f2ffc0">1,000 Yen.</font>

1032
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:47,068
<font color="#f2ffc0">Thank you a lot.</font>
Oh, there. No, you are welcome.

1033
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:47,661
Yeah.

1034
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,309
A thousand yen that's...

1035
00:57:49,568 --> 00:57:51,154
ten quid for that bottle of water mate.

1036
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,145
<font color="#f2ffc0">Thank you a lot.</font>
Tara.

1037
00:57:55,293 --> 00:57:56,826
<font color="#f2ffc0">Excuse me.</font>
Dōmo arigatō.

1038
00:58:03,184 --> 00:58:04,494
You sure you don't want to talk this out?

1039
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,791
Not particularly, no.

1040
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,150
Ok.

1041
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,268
You fucking bastard!

1042
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:13,382
Fucker!

1043
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,243
Come here, you little fuck!

1044
00:58:25,408 --> 00:58:27,986
I know who killed the kid.

1045
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:30,077
Yeah?
Where the fuck is he then?

1046
00:58:31,212 --> 00:58:32,476
He is on this train.

1047
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:34,202
Oh well, that narrows it down,
then don't it?

1048
00:58:39,836 --> 00:58:41,454
Let go! Get off!

1049
00:59:09,864 --> 00:59:10,918
You gonna get that?

1050
00:59:11,854 --> 00:59:12,820
No.

1051
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:15,725
You probably ought to get that.

1052
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:21,562
It could be important.

1053
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,711
Oh, ok, maybe it's important.

1054
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:27,226
Fucking hell.

1055
00:59:27,468 --> 00:59:28,468
Come here.

1056
00:59:29,726 --> 00:59:30,804
Yeah, what do you want?

1057
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:32,368
<i>The White Death
says to get off at next stop</i>

1058
00:59:32,393 --> 00:59:34,924
<i>holding the briefcase
or he will kill everyone on that train.</i>

1059
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:36,846
Ok yeah, I can make it but...

1060
00:59:36,871 --> 00:59:38,562
Lemon, he is a little tied up right now.

1061
00:59:39,432 --> 00:59:40,572
<i>Both of you this time,</i>

1062
00:59:40,638 --> 00:59:43,083
<i>with the case or everyone dies.</i>

1063
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,153
Fucking paranoid, this lot.

1064
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,146
You don't happen to have
the case on you, do you?

1065
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:50,232
No.

1066
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:54,610
Yeah, I don't think I would reach
Lemon in time anyway.

1067
00:59:55,352 --> 00:59:56,594
You still got his phone.

1068
00:59:57,065 --> 00:59:58,320
Do you have a gun on you?

1069
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,077
Don't like them.

1070
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:03,244
Well...

1071
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:05,830
Game is up mate.

1072
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:08,760
For what it's worth, you seem
like a right fucking asshole

1073
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:10,530
and I am glad you are gonna
fucking die with me.

1074
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:11,816
That's nice.

1075
01:00:14,515 --> 01:00:15,433
Just curious.

1076
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:16,517
Yeah?

1077
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,885
Do they even know what Lemon looks like?

1078
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:23,916
You two do look like twins?

1079
01:00:26,138 --> 01:00:27,153
Yeah ok.

1080
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:28,674
We got the case now what?

1081
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:31,240
You still take the train to Kyoto station.

1082
01:00:32,473 --> 01:00:33,145
Yeah.

1083
01:00:33,388 --> 01:00:34,778
Ok. We can do that.
Wonderful.

1084
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:35,628
Hey.

1085
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:39,261
Have you opened the case?
No, of course not.

1086
01:00:39,346 --> 01:00:41,124
Do you know what? I never asked
for the combination.

1087
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:42,726
You know what I mean?
Keep it safe that way.

1088
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:43,611
Yeah.

1089
01:00:44,342 --> 01:00:46,022
So no one gets greedy.

1090
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,733
Oh I know, I know.

1091
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:06,582
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.

1092
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,015
I-I have this bad luck thing and

1093
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:10,412
I hit the thing...
oh, is that what you call it?

1094
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:11,531
And it went...
So what the...

1095
01:01:11,761 --> 01:01:13,183
what was that?
Why did you even bother trying?

1096
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:14,158
I was trying to sell it.

1097
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,955
I was selling it.
Well, I don't think they were in the market

1098
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,432
for fucking dildos and pantyhose,
were they?

1099
01:01:17,457 --> 01:01:18,288
Ah but...

1100
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:19,839
They were buying it. They...

1101
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:21,691
I had them.

1102
01:01:25,046 --> 01:01:26,590
You proved you are
smarter than everyone.

1103
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,811
You have won kid.

1104
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:29,647
Please.

1105
01:01:31,626 --> 01:01:32,616
Please kid.

1106
01:01:34,094 --> 01:01:35,210
Call your man.

1107
01:01:36,233 --> 01:01:38,238
I will do what you want.
Just...

1108
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:41,502
Leave my son, alone.

1109
01:01:42,863 --> 01:01:43,910
Your son.

1110
01:01:45,262 --> 01:01:46,910
Do you know how easy it was

1111
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:48,853
to get him to follow me up onto that roof?

1112
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:53,222
Didn't think it would take you three hours

1113
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:55,310
to even realize your son...

1114
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:56,876
was missing.

1115
01:01:57,517 --> 01:01:59,120
You are a terrible father and...

1116
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,246
your son...

1117
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:03,533
is going to pay for all the
mistakes that you have made.

1118
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:05,962
You don't know anything...

1119
01:02:06,954 --> 01:02:08,087
about life.

1120
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:11,024
How hard it is.

1121
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:13,641
You are just...

1122
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:16,054
Some spoiled girl,

1123
01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:18,125
who breaks their toys,

1124
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:20,776
when mommy says she has to pick up.

1125
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:22,936
Sorry.

1126
01:02:23,022 --> 01:02:24,523
Pardon me, I don't mean to...

1127
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:25,632
interrupt what's...

1128
01:02:26,181 --> 01:02:27,357
going on here but...

1129
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:28,726
you would not happen to have seen...

1130
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:31,195
a tiny white prick with a pair of glasses
come through here, have you?

1131
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:35,427
No.

1132
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:37,333
What about a silver case
with a train sticker

1133
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:38,525
by the handle? You seen that?

1134
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:40,169
It's not ringing any...

1135
01:02:40,232 --> 01:02:41,803
Uncle Kkimura, have you seen

1136
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:43,881
a silver briefcase with the train...

1137
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,008
Did you say train sticker by the handle?

1138
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:47,443
Yeah. On the handle...
That's...

1139
01:02:47,468 --> 01:02:48,272
It had a train sticker.
Unique.

1140
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,964
No, I have not seen anything like that.

1141
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:51,090
I think I would remember.

1142
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:54,037
I am s...
Uncle Kimura?

1143
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:56,053
Yeah.
Y... right.

1144
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:57,674
Are you ok? That's...

1145
01:02:58,137 --> 01:03:00,715
Oh, yeah. Never shave on a bullet train,
you know what they say.

1146
01:03:00,937 --> 01:03:02,213
Well, could not hurt to ask, you know?

1147
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:03,300
I am just gonna keep following him.

1148
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,527
Go for it.
Yeah, no, it's alright.

1149
01:03:04,552 --> 01:03:06,040
Pardon me, uncle Kimura.

1150
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:07,280
You guys, take care.

1151
01:03:07,905 --> 01:03:09,202
Just one thing, though.

1152
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:11,091
Most people...

1153
01:03:11,334 --> 01:03:13,035
Most people assume suitcase,

1154
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,237
you know, because it's a train,

1155
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,594
overnight and all.

1156
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:17,281
But you...

1157
01:03:17,984 --> 01:03:19,430
You said briefcase.

1158
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:21,966
I never said briefcase.

1159
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:23,685
I think...

1160
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:26,830
I found my Diesel.

1161
01:03:32,068 --> 01:03:33,872
You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto.

1162
01:03:35,717 --> 01:03:37,966
We should just get off this train. Now.

1163
01:03:38,802 --> 01:03:41,305
If you think I am stepping off
this train without lemon or the case,

1164
01:03:41,329 --> 01:03:42,520
you must be mistaken.

1165
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,864
Ok. Well, the case
is in the first class lounge.

1166
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,444
It's behind the bar, it's in a trash can.

1167
01:03:46,469 --> 01:03:47,733
It's yours.

1168
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:48,855
Me,

1169
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,595
I am getting off.
I am gonna go find a...

1170
01:03:50,672 --> 01:03:52,884
temple and reevaluate
my choices or something.

1171
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:54,553
Oh that sounds very lovely
but here is the deal.

1172
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:56,243
I still need a fall guy.

1173
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,638
Shit.

1174
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:01,350
You need a fall guy.
Yeah.

1175
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,510
No, I understand.
I-I get it.

1176
01:04:05,546 --> 01:04:06,819
It's a bit of a conundrum really,

1177
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,398
because you know, I am thinking,
do I hand him back in one piece

1178
01:04:09,423 --> 01:04:10,980
or do I chop you up into little pieces

1179
01:04:11,005 --> 01:04:12,683
and stuff you inside
a fucking Momomon or not?

1180
01:04:12,887 --> 01:04:14,632
That's what's going through
my head right now.

1181
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:17,673
Or...

1182
01:04:17,698 --> 01:04:19,332
Oh what?
You got a better idea do you?

1183
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:22,296
You know, before us now is just a wall,

1184
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:24,532
but it's an illusion man.
It's a construct.

1185
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,309
You know, because within that wall...

1186
01:04:26,544 --> 01:04:27,578
sits a window.

1187
01:04:27,717 --> 01:04:29,187
A window of opportunity.

1188
01:04:29,778 --> 01:04:31,567
Dammit it's a door.
It's...

1189
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:34,387
Within that wall, is a door.

1190
01:04:34,692 --> 01:04:37,147
I am finding it very hard
to follow this story.

1191
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:39,031
My point is, that door is closing.

1192
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:55,329
Now the only question is.
Which one is the Diesel,

1193
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:57,364
which one is the Duck?
The duck?

1194
01:04:57,389 --> 01:04:58,522
It's a kids' show.

1195
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,615
Thomas the train engine.
Close.

1196
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:01,701
<i>Thomas the tank...</i>

1197
01:05:02,077 --> 01:05:02,865
<i>engine.</i>

1198
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,795
Please mister.

1199
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:05,181
This...

1200
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:06,898
this man, he kidnapped me,

1201
01:05:06,941 --> 01:05:08,184
and he said that he is going,

1202
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:09,609
to hold me for ransom.

1203
01:05:12,249 --> 01:05:14,786
I am sorry. I get captivated
by white girl tears.

1204
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,772
Bravo.
Common sense tells me

1205
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:19,162
that this old, shaky geezer here
is the one in charge,

1206
01:05:19,187 --> 01:05:20,811
but I am really good at reading people,

1207
01:05:20,836 --> 01:05:23,406
and something tells me
you are just not fucking right.

1208
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,453
So...

1209
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:28,905
let's see here.

1210
01:05:29,203 --> 01:05:30,910
I mean, I can't shoot you both.

1211
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:33,848
Then I get no answers.

1212
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:35,419
You know what,

1213
01:05:35,443 --> 01:05:36,909
how about this?
I am sure you will love this.

1214
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,171
We are gonna play a little game.

1215
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,575
If you want to play a game,
put both your hands up.

1216
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,255
Perfect. I knew you would like this.

1217
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:43,607
You are gonna close your eyes,

1218
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:45,245
and I am gonna count to three.

1219
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:48,154
And whichever one of you is in charge,
you are gonna raise your hand,

1220
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:49,805
and whichever one isn't,
you point at who is.

1221
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:52,432
Now, if you both raise your hands
or you both point at each other,

1222
01:05:52,457 --> 01:05:53,893
I know you are both liars
and the truth ain't in you,

1223
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:55,799
and then I will fucking shoot you both.
Ready?

1224
01:05:55,824 --> 01:05:57,494
You you said you could not kill us both.

1225
01:05:57,519 --> 01:05:59,065
You would get no answers.

1226
01:05:59,192 --> 01:06:00,949
I did say that, didn't I?
Yes.

1227
01:06:02,596 --> 01:06:05,217
Sometimes you got to shoot first
and come up with answers later.

1228
01:06:05,824 --> 01:06:06,965
One.

1229
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,099
<i>Or if I don't answer
this phone when you call...</i>

1230
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,881
Two.
<i>Kill Wataru.</i>

1231
01:06:11,906 --> 01:06:13,052
Three.

1232
01:06:40,804 --> 01:06:42,349
Am I dreaming?

1233
01:07:11,456 --> 01:07:12,581
Sorry mate.

1234
01:07:12,606 --> 01:07:13,940
Not your lucky day.

1235
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:23,401
I have a wire in, in my bag
and I-I think that we could...

1236
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,446
use it to-to lock the door from the outside.

1237
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,416
It was so scary.

1238
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:31,360
He said that if I didn't do what he said,

1239
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,871
or if I yelled or anything that he would...

1240
01:07:33,895 --> 01:07:35,765
do awful, awful things to me.

1241
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,792
Then why didn't you use this, then?

1242
01:07:41,837 --> 01:07:43,626
Yeah, he kidnapped you and...

1243
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:45,787
gave you his gun to hold, right?
No, no, no.

1244
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,062
Easy.
No...

1245
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:48,178
I... please.

1246
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:50,756
I don't know how to use a gun.
I don't know.

1247
01:07:50,898 --> 01:07:52,498
Please.
Fuck me. You are fucking...

1248
01:07:52,523 --> 01:07:53,670
You are really...

1249
01:07:53,889 --> 01:07:55,175
good, you sure you didn't study?

1250
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,106
I mean, you are not even afraid
and your lip's quivering.

1251
01:07:57,131 --> 01:07:57,979
That's a tear.

1252
01:07:58,003 --> 01:07:59,880
That is really authentic, mate, like...

1253
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:01,481
You are the Diesel.

1254
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:02,526
I got to kill you.

1255
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,392
Please, I am just a kid. Please.

1256
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:06,210
How do you do that?
I am not! I am not!

1257
01:08:06,235 --> 01:08:07,616
It's really unbelievable.

1258
01:08:07,641 --> 01:08:09,016
Please. Please.
You...

1259
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:12,531
You are...

1260
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:18,161
I got...

1261
01:08:19,466 --> 01:08:21,568
It's fucking...
You stay right there.

1262
01:08:22,219 --> 01:08:24,200
Did you?
What the fuck is happening?

1263
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,721
Everyone loves lemons.

1264
01:08:37,176 --> 01:08:38,712
Fucking die!

1265
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,028
I am glad you enjoyed the performance.

1266
01:08:54,568 --> 01:08:56,052
How did you do that?

1267
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:58,691
I am not sure.

1268
01:08:59,006 --> 01:09:00,582
Just lucky, I guess.

1269
01:09:02,383 --> 01:09:04,175
Tell Tangerine that...

1270
01:09:04,638 --> 01:09:05,902
Tell Tangerine...

1271
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:08,716
Tangerine...

1272
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,836
He is gone.

1273
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:12,830
Tangerine is gone.

1274
01:09:20,094 --> 01:09:21,569
Getting off this train.

1275
01:09:21,842 --> 01:09:23,647
I am getting that case and that's it.

1276
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:32,981
Hello?

1277
01:09:33,645 --> 01:09:34,512
<font color="#f2ffc0">Yuuichi,</font>

1278
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:35,715
<font color="#f2ffc0">where are you?</font>

1279
01:09:37,543 --> 01:09:39,246
It looks like Yuuichi lost his...

1280
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:41,123
phone on the bullet train.
You can pick it up

1281
01:09:41,147 --> 01:09:42,225
at Kyoto station though.

1282
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,228
<i>Kyoto...</i>
There is this find my phone app.

1283
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,221
Surprisingly accurate.

1284
01:09:47,246 --> 01:09:47,954
<i>Bye.</i>

1285
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:08,967
God, he has got a great walk.

1286
01:10:17,518 --> 01:10:18,518
Mr. Wolf.

1287
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:20,960
So you came to kill the hornet.

1288
01:10:29,495 --> 01:10:30,705
<font color="#f2ffc0">What happened?</font>

1289
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:35,594
<font color="#f2ffc0">Are you ok?</font>

1290
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,863
Fuck, that thing is hot.

1291
01:10:43,811 --> 01:10:44,873
Momomon.

1292
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:47,731
Momomon.

1293
01:10:47,755 --> 01:10:48,578
Go.

1294
01:10:48,603 --> 01:10:49,774
Mom on.
No lea...

1295
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:50,817
Momomon.

1296
01:11:05,009 --> 01:11:06,629
The pastry chef.

1297
01:11:18,559 --> 01:11:20,447
You stole my snake, bitch.

1298
01:11:22,382 --> 01:11:23,402
That was your...

1299
01:11:23,473 --> 01:11:25,809
We should really call the authorities
because someone...

1300
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:33,688
Take that punk!

1301
01:11:35,562 --> 01:11:36,516
Hey, bitch.

1302
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:39,243
One little prick from this,
you know what happens?

1303
01:11:39,532 --> 01:11:41,035
Yes.
Your blood congeals,

1304
01:11:41,275 --> 01:11:42,377
clogging your veins.

1305
01:11:42,402 --> 01:11:43,780
You bleed out of your fucking eye socket.

1306
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:45,035
I said yes!

1307
01:11:46,772 --> 01:11:48,160
Weakass bitch.

1308
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:52,013
Stop.
I am taking that case.

1309
01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:52,903
Give it!

1310
01:11:53,836 --> 01:11:55,254
I was promised my money.

1311
01:11:55,882 --> 01:11:58,294
By who?
Don't know. It was all online.

1312
01:11:58,582 --> 01:12:00,504
They said my money was in the case.

1313
01:12:01,421 --> 01:12:03,356
What? Someone paid you
to have the kid killed

1314
01:12:03,381 --> 01:12:04,585
with his own ransom?

1315
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:05,889
That's dark.

1316
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,174
That is dark as...

1317
01:12:07,385 --> 01:12:08,092
Stop!

1318
01:12:12,438 --> 01:12:14,072
The hornet stings, bitch!

1319
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,503
Lady, you can have the case.

1320
01:12:16,528 --> 01:12:18,831
Oh, but you have seen my face, bitch.

1321
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:32,734
Thirty seconds before the venom
does its thing.

1322
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:52,740
You bitch.

1323
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:54,580
Oh, shit, man.

1324
01:12:54,605 --> 01:12:55,697
Do you have a backup?

1325
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:57,546
What do you think bitch?

1326
01:13:00,569 --> 01:13:01,952
Oh shit man.

1327
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:05,453
You don't have another one?

1328
01:13:05,478 --> 01:13:07,023
You got to be better prepared.

1329
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:09,007
I am mansplaining,
I am mansplaining again.

1330
01:13:09,032 --> 01:13:10,193
I am sorry. It didn't...

1331
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:14,005
Can I get you something?

1332
01:13:20,088 --> 01:13:22,323
You don't seem like a religious person.

1333
01:13:24,323 --> 01:13:26,776
Water? Would you...
Would you like some water?

1334
01:13:27,929 --> 01:13:28,695
No?

1335
01:13:29,597 --> 01:13:31,101
You want a blanket?

1336
01:13:31,645 --> 01:13:33,429
You want me to hold your hand?

1337
01:13:44,032 --> 01:13:45,654
Karma is a bitch.

1338
01:16:01,633 --> 01:16:02,677
<i>Talk to me.</i>

1339
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:05,651
It's my bad luck.
It's bad luck on acid.

1340
01:16:05,676 --> 01:16:07,578
I-I-I-I got to get off this train.

1341
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:09,120
<i>Do you have the case?</i>

1342
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:10,846
Yes.

1343
01:16:11,805 --> 01:16:13,807
<i>Are you lying on the ground
in the fetal position?</i>

1344
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,055
I am not on the ground.

1345
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:18,712
<i>You need to get up.</i>

1346
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:20,227
How do you always know what I am doing?

1347
01:16:20,252 --> 01:16:21,787
<i>Because I know you.</i>

1348
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:23,350
I could journal.
I should journal.

1349
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:25,152
<i>Ladybug. Ladybug.</i>
Man.

1350
01:16:25,177 --> 01:16:26,028
<i>Breathe.</i>

1351
01:16:26,269 --> 01:16:27,296
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

1352
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:29,734
<i>We are almost there.
You just need to get up.</i>

1353
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:31,640
Right.

1354
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:54,363
<i>You have been lying to me, my friend.</i>

1355
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:58,207
Well, cat's out of the bag now, innit?

1356
01:16:58,485 --> 01:17:01,805
<i>You were responsible
for keeping my son safe.</i>

1357
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,432
<i>For keeping my money safe.</i>

1358
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:05,776
You know, I-I don't know a thing
or two about being a parent,

1359
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,156
but you know what I would do,

1360
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:10,131
being that it's your son and your money?

1361
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:12,701
I would stop crying about your dead wife,

1362
01:17:12,802 --> 01:17:14,804
get off your fucking lazy ass,

1363
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:16,770
come here and finish the job yourself.

1364
01:17:16,904 --> 01:17:18,749
But as we are having a bit
of a heart to heart,

1365
01:17:19,206 --> 01:17:20,514
got a couple things to tell you.

1366
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:22,851
Your son is a complete bell end
and fucking deserves

1367
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:24,411
to be bleeding out of his eye sockets.

1368
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:26,872
And as for your case,
I have not seen it since Tokyo.

1369
01:17:27,035 --> 01:17:28,553
And I hope someone is fucking found it,

1370
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:31,355
put it all on red and having
a fucking wonderful time.

1371
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,650
<i>I will meet you at Kyoto station.</i>

1372
01:17:33,675 --> 01:17:35,956
Oh, how wonderful.
I can't fucking wait.

1373
01:17:35,981 --> 01:17:37,855
<i>I want to look into your eyes</i>

1374
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,262
<i>when I kill you and your brother.</i>

1375
01:17:46,846 --> 01:17:47,981
My brother.

1376
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:59,067
<i>West Ham have taken it!</i>

1377
01:17:59,278 --> 01:18:02,229
<i>West Ham one, Chelsea nil.</i>

1378
01:18:06,587 --> 01:18:09,251
Morning rush hour is rolling in quite nicely.

1379
01:18:09,962 --> 01:18:10,812
What's your plan, mate?

1380
01:18:10,837 --> 01:18:13,047
You gonna fucking waltz up here
and blow my brains out

1381
01:18:13,072 --> 01:18:14,678
in front of the whole fucking carriage...

1382
01:18:14,966 --> 01:18:18,087
of witnesses?
<i>There is no one left on that train.</i>

1383
01:18:18,532 --> 01:18:19,713
<i>I know.</i>

1384
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:22,227
<i>I bought every ticket,</i>

1385
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:24,358
<i>until the end of the line.</i>

1386
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:28,625
Oi.

1387
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:30,305
You.

1388
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:31,906
I know you.

1389
01:18:32,702 --> 01:18:34,172
You are that girl, are not you?

1390
01:18:34,415 --> 01:18:35,616
Oh, my god.

1391
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,583
Yeah, I never forget a face me.

1392
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:39,202
I am so happy to see you.

1393
01:18:39,226 --> 01:18:40,195
Please help me.

1394
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:43,532
Oh there is this man
and he was holding me hostage.

1395
01:18:43,825 --> 01:18:45,500
He was wearing glasses and...

1396
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:47,622
he killed my uncle.

1397
01:18:47,961 --> 01:18:49,664
And he also killed this other man who,

1398
01:18:49,811 --> 01:18:51,853
I don't know, he just kept talking about,

1399
01:18:52,742 --> 01:18:54,662
Tho-Tho-Thomas the trains and...

1400
01:18:54,687 --> 01:18:55,796
Tank engine.

1401
01:18:56,318 --> 01:18:57,479
Yeah, right. Exactly.

1402
01:18:57,504 --> 01:18:58,958
But he killed both of them,

1403
01:18:58,983 --> 01:19:01,608
and then he... he said he was going
to get away with some sort of money.

1404
01:19:01,633 --> 01:19:02,662
I don't know.

1405
01:19:03,561 --> 01:19:04,561
I am sorry darling I...

1406
01:19:04,857 --> 01:19:06,947
I beg your pardon.
I don't know who the fuck you are.

1407
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:11,686
I am just a girl who was
supposed to get off at Nagoya,

1408
01:19:11,733 --> 01:19:13,702
and then this man, he...
That was fucking ages ago.

1409
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:15,707
I know, but this man, he just said

1410
01:19:15,732 --> 01:19:17,496
that I could be a good backup plan

1411
01:19:17,521 --> 01:19:19,661
and that a pretty girl makes a good hostage.

1412
01:19:19,686 --> 01:19:21,519
Yeah well, he ain't wrong there
but hey look.

1413
01:19:21,544 --> 01:19:23,239
Keep your fucking knickers on, alright?

1414
01:19:23,264 --> 01:19:25,533
Please just help me.
Alright, alright. Calm down.

1415
01:19:25,734 --> 01:19:27,626
Get off or do what the fuck
you like.

1416
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,900
You are free to go. Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

1417
01:19:28,925 --> 01:19:29,784
It's alright. Go on.
Thank you.

1418
01:19:29,809 --> 01:19:31,463
Get that way, you are doing anyway.

1419
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,410
Are you ok?

1420
01:19:37,746 --> 01:19:38,605
Diesel.

1421
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,248
The absolutely fucking worst.

1422
01:19:41,804 --> 01:19:43,215
Little shitstirrer.

1423
01:19:46,085 --> 01:19:46,770
See...

1424
01:19:47,747 --> 01:19:48,715
Lemon...

1425
01:19:51,358 --> 01:19:52,712
God rest his soul,

1426
01:19:54,128 --> 01:19:55,118
was the Don...

1427
01:19:56,497 --> 01:19:58,031
and he could read people.

1428
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:00,102
See them for who they really are.
What?

1429
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:01,842
He was right.

1430
01:20:02,936 --> 01:20:04,358
There is been a Diesel

1431
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:06,808
running up and down this train,

1432
01:20:07,162 --> 01:20:09,186
causing all sorts of fucking havoc.

1433
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:11,912
And it was you the whole fucking time,

1434
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:13,731
you dirty little Diesel!

1435
01:20:17,706 --> 01:20:19,137
You made Lemon bleed.

1436
01:20:19,888 --> 01:20:21,322
And lemon never bleeds.

1437
01:20:22,476 --> 01:20:23,633
Oh, my god mister!

1438
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:24,777
Please help me!
Ladybug.

1439
01:20:24,802 --> 01:20:25,757
Please!
Please help me!

1440
01:20:25,782 --> 01:20:27,017
Bugger.
You little shit.

1441
01:20:27,115 --> 01:20:28,999
Please! What the fuck
are you doing, you bell end?

1442
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:29,898
You...
Sir! Please!

1443
01:20:47,582 --> 01:20:48,347
What?

1444
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:50,231
Diesel!
What?

1445
01:20:50,852 --> 01:20:52,473
You fucking bell end!

1446
01:20:57,033 --> 01:20:58,486
You are a Diesel.

1447
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:01,455
What the fuck?

1448
01:21:03,981 --> 01:21:05,364
What the fuck?

1449
01:21:05,974 --> 01:21:07,677
He said that he was going to kill you

1450
01:21:07,702 --> 01:21:09,424
and blame everything on you.

1451
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:11,830
He also said that...

1452
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:15,064
there is someone waiting for us
at Kyoto station.

1453
01:21:15,635 --> 01:21:16,900
Someone scary,

1454
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:19,080
who would hurt me.

1455
01:21:20,004 --> 01:21:21,327
No one is gonna hurt you.

1456
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:22,945
It's ok.

1457
01:21:24,237 --> 01:21:25,624
We are getting off this train.

1458
01:21:34,414 --> 01:21:35,629
We make the next stop,

1459
01:21:35,832 --> 01:21:36,912
we will be fine.

1460
01:21:56,852 --> 01:21:57,969
Ok kid, come...

1461
01:21:58,151 --> 01:21:59,359
Kid, come on.

1462
01:21:59,988 --> 01:22:01,689
I can't.
My backpack is stuck.

1463
01:22:01,823 --> 01:22:02,297
What?

1464
01:22:03,594 --> 01:22:04,821
Leave it. Let's go.

1465
01:22:04,846 --> 01:22:06,836
We got to go, we got to go.
No. No, I can't.

1466
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:08,095
Right now, young lady!

1467
01:22:08,228 --> 01:22:09,544
No.
It's our last chance.

1468
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:10,971
No. No, no, no, please come back.

1469
01:22:11,313 --> 01:22:12,834
Kid, please.

1470
01:22:12,859 --> 01:22:15,615
I am scared. I don't want
to be alone, please.

1471
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,234
I got it.

1472
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,761
It's not your fault kid. It's...

1473
01:22:25,777 --> 01:22:27,437
it's my luck, not yours.

1474
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:32,269
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Make sure you...

1475
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:34,975
do something that brings
you peace because...

1476
01:22:35,756 --> 01:22:37,045
everything else is a...

1477
01:22:37,373 --> 01:22:38,529
pain in the ass.

1478
01:22:39,526 --> 01:22:41,403
And if you run into a guy named Carver,

1479
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:42,948
he is a dick.

1480
01:22:42,973 --> 01:22:44,769
You can tell him I said so.

1481
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:50,205
I...

1482
01:22:50,363 --> 01:22:51,074
I...

1483
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,174
I took this.
I didn't want to leave it.

1484
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:57,496
The man had it and I thought
you could probably use it

1485
01:22:57,521 --> 01:23:00,285
to kill whoever is waiting for us
at the end of the line.

1486
01:23:01,315 --> 01:23:03,083
You are not going to let me get hurt.

1487
01:23:03,448 --> 01:23:04,604
Be honest.

1488
01:23:06,437 --> 01:23:07,437
Be honest.

1489
01:23:07,462 --> 01:23:08,791
Who is there with you?

1490
01:23:14,759 --> 01:23:15,735
Really?

1491
01:23:16,188 --> 01:23:17,189
Right.

1492
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:19,212
Ok fella.

1493
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:20,567
You are creeping me out,

1494
01:23:20,712 --> 01:23:21,443
so...

1495
01:23:21,575 --> 01:23:24,487
if you don't mind,
could you just find another seat like...

1496
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:27,787
way, way, way down there?

1497
01:23:28,201 --> 01:23:29,492
And that way,

1498
01:23:30,155 --> 01:23:31,772
I won't have to tell you twice.

1499
01:23:32,811 --> 01:23:33,545
No.

1500
01:23:34,608 --> 01:23:35,717
You won't.

1501
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:42,522
Let's just move.

1502
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:44,142
Let me grab your bag.

1503
01:23:56,853 --> 01:23:58,103
Was that a snake?

1504
01:23:58,405 --> 01:23:59,916
Would you know where my son is?

1505
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:22,429
Oh, fuck.

1506
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:35,805
After everything.

1507
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:43,739
You are the person...

1508
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:47,638
who pushed my grandson
off the department store roof.

1509
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:49,114
Why?

1510
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:50,185
Your son.

1511
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,349
He was going to help me
kill the White Death

1512
01:24:53,374 --> 01:24:54,534
at Kyoto station.

1513
01:24:55,692 --> 01:24:58,159
And that was the only way
to get him on this train.

1514
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,719
The White Death.

1515
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:03,938
That's right.

1516
01:25:04,476 --> 01:25:07,044
But he could not even do that.

1517
01:25:08,495 --> 01:25:09,620
So he is dead.

1518
01:25:10,307 --> 01:25:11,628
Just a few cars back.

1519
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:13,878
They are both dead.

1520
01:25:21,823 --> 01:25:24,445
My grandson was pushed off a roof.

1521
01:25:25,068 --> 01:25:28,607
What makes you think
I would leave him unprotected?

1522
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:54,663
My grandson is safe.

1523
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:57,734
And my son is not dead.

1524
01:25:58,241 --> 01:25:58,975
Listen,

1525
01:25:59,241 --> 01:26:00,389
old man...

1526
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:03,554
The only thing you know
about an old man young lady,

1527
01:26:04,194 --> 01:26:06,528
is that he has survived much more,

1528
01:26:07,062 --> 01:26:08,777
and much worse,

1529
01:26:08,801 --> 01:26:10,083
than you.

1530
01:26:19,527 --> 01:26:21,205
I will fucking kill him myself.

1531
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:31,716
Are you alright?

1532
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:32,797
That?

1533
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:36,262
You are not gonna believe
this coincidence but I...

1534
01:26:36,562 --> 01:26:39,599
already got a dose of
antivenom in me today, so...

1535
01:26:40,176 --> 01:26:41,177
I am good.

1536
01:26:42,307 --> 01:26:43,341
Probably.

1537
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,333
The girl...

1538
01:26:47,419 --> 01:26:49,067
Her intentions with you,

1539
01:26:49,091 --> 01:26:51,200
were not honorable.
Yeah.

1540
01:26:51,746 --> 01:26:55,191
A blind man could see
you are the one in the dark.

1541
01:26:55,216 --> 01:26:56,731
I don't know about a blind man.

1542
01:26:56,756 --> 01:26:58,091
She was pretty convincing.

1543
01:26:58,989 --> 01:27:01,505
What did you do to her?
I did not need to do anything.

1544
01:27:02,606 --> 01:27:04,809
Fate will do what it wills.

1545
01:27:07,527 --> 01:27:08,336
Why...

1546
01:27:08,828 --> 01:27:10,332
Why do you laugh at fate?

1547
01:27:11,007 --> 01:27:12,006
Man...

1548
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:13,388
fate for me is...

1549
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,799
just another word for bad luck.

1550
01:27:17,337 --> 01:27:18,292
And that...

1551
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:21,589
That follows me around like...

1552
01:27:24,178 --> 01:27:25,914
I don't know, something witty.

1553
01:27:29,851 --> 01:27:31,555
My handler calls me Ladybug.

1554
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:33,343
She is witty.

1555
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:34,612
Ladybug?

1556
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:35,663
Yeah.

1557
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:38,257
This is very lucky, indeed.

1558
01:27:40,293 --> 01:27:42,362
No, she is being ironic.
She...

1559
01:27:43,543 --> 01:27:44,232
Never mind.

1560
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:46,239
I am going to tell you a story now.

1561
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:48,102
No I am good.
It's short.

1562
01:27:48,754 --> 01:27:50,378
Really I am fine.
No

1563
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:51,939
it's very quick.

1564
01:27:52,504 --> 01:27:53,394
No, no.

1565
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:55,910
It's a good story for you, I think.

1566
01:27:56,543 --> 01:27:57,410
I am cool.

1567
01:27:57,614 --> 01:27:58,583
Here we go.

1568
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,802
A long time ago,

1569
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:04,645
I made a promise to myself...

1570
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:08,026
that I would provide for my family

1571
01:28:08,563 --> 01:28:10,227
no matter what it cost.

1572
01:28:13,749 --> 01:28:16,227
I had risen to a highly coveted position

1573
01:28:16,507 --> 01:28:18,834
within the Minegishi crime family.

1574
01:28:19,733 --> 01:28:21,967
A man raised up to take my place.

1575
01:28:22,481 --> 01:28:24,006
A man from the north.

1576
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,461
I asked Minegishi,

1577
01:28:31,485 --> 01:28:33,308
not to trust this man.

1578
01:28:34,527 --> 01:28:35,924
Minegishi told me...

1579
01:28:36,293 --> 01:28:38,316
I had lost my appetite.

1580
01:28:38,808 --> 01:28:40,063
He was not wrong.

1581
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:42,305
But neither was I.

1582
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:06,567
I returned home

1583
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,164
and I found nothing,

1584
01:29:08,793 --> 01:29:10,817
except ash and blood.

1585
01:29:29,371 --> 01:29:31,926
The White Death had taken
everything from me.

1586
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,473
Almost.

1587
01:29:36,941 --> 01:29:37,876
Yuuichi!

1588
01:29:39,549 --> 01:29:40,353
Yuuichi.

1589
01:29:44,165 --> 01:29:45,079
Yuuichi.

1590
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:47,548
I went into hiding.

1591
01:29:48,456 --> 01:29:51,439
I searched for a way
to strike at the White Death

1592
01:29:51,467 --> 01:29:53,908
without endangering what I had left,

1593
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:57,531
but he remained forever out of reach.

1594
01:29:58,799 --> 01:30:00,229
I did not think...

1595
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:03,893
fate would ever give me
a chance to make things right.

1596
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,791
Do you know what they call
a ladybug in Japan?

1597
01:30:12,057 --> 01:30:13,236
Tentōu mushi.

1598
01:30:13,869 --> 01:30:14,814
As a boy,

1599
01:30:15,142 --> 01:30:17,861
I was told there is a spot on its back

1600
01:30:18,152 --> 01:30:20,587
for each of the seven sorrows
of the world.

1601
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:22,280
You see...

1602
01:30:22,934 --> 01:30:24,660
Tentōu mushi is not lucky.

1603
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,161
It holds all the bad luck

1604
01:30:27,294 --> 01:30:28,786
so that others...

1605
01:30:29,122 --> 01:30:30,489
may live in peace.

1606
01:30:33,245 --> 01:30:35,487
II don't want to hold the seven sorrows.

1607
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:37,972
Everything that's ever happened to you

1608
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:39,549
has led you here.

1609
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:42,443
Fate.

1610
01:30:43,206 --> 01:30:44,883
Well, that's a shit deal.

1611
01:30:46,781 --> 01:30:48,250
At Kyoto station,

1612
01:30:49,092 --> 01:30:50,183
the White Death,

1613
01:30:50,207 --> 01:30:51,851
will arrive on this train.

1614
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:55,755
I will finally be allowed
to make things right.

1615
01:30:57,684 --> 01:30:59,458
My son is a few cars up.

1616
01:30:59,794 --> 01:31:02,411
If you could escort him off this train...

1617
01:31:03,388 --> 01:31:05,833
Yeah, I don't see the White Death

1618
01:31:05,858 --> 01:31:07,727
letting any of us off this train.

1619
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,723
You let me worry about the White Death.

1620
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:15,121
Ok.

1621
01:31:18,646 --> 01:31:19,855
Mr. Ladybug?

1622
01:31:22,442 --> 01:31:23,622
Your briefcase.

1623
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:25,019
Thank you.

1624
01:31:36,818 --> 01:31:37,697
<font color="#f2ffc0">Father.</font>

1625
01:31:39,808 --> 01:31:40,666
<font color="#f2ffc0">I don't understand.</font>

1626
01:31:42,019 --> 01:31:43,499
<font color="#f2ffc0">It is fate my son.</font>

1627
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:45,429
<font color="#f2ffc0">Wataru?</font>

1628
01:31:45,772 --> 01:31:46,835
<font color="#f2ffc0">He is safe.</font>

1629
01:31:50,195 --> 01:31:50,952
Well,

1630
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:53,379
he seemed like a decent guy.

1631
01:31:54,778 --> 01:31:55,983
He shot me.

1632
01:31:56,215 --> 01:31:57,293
Me too.

1633
01:31:57,471 --> 01:31:58,348
Twice.

1634
01:31:59,352 --> 01:32:00,614
Still, he had another side to him...

1635
01:32:08,284 --> 01:32:09,432
Oh, man.

1636
01:32:10,883 --> 01:32:12,003
Am I in hell?

1637
01:32:15,555 --> 01:32:16,422
Fuck.

1638
01:32:20,765 --> 01:32:22,078
Fucking vest man.

1639
01:32:23,619 --> 01:32:25,700
Oh, you drank the water.

1640
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,497
Where the fuck is my brother?

1641
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:03,937
Man.

1642
01:33:18,769 --> 01:33:19,738
You...

1643
01:33:24,957 --> 01:33:26,941
You were more like Thomas anyway right?

1644
01:34:01,322 --> 01:34:02,197
Fellas.

1645
01:34:02,776 --> 01:34:04,564
We need to come up with a plan.

1646
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:06,478
You killed my brother.

1647
01:34:06,929 --> 01:34:09,046
You killed my brother, you piece of shit!

1648
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:11,615
Yeah, you, you, you fucking shot me!

1649
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:13,343
I will shoot you in
the fucking throat next time,

1650
01:34:13,368 --> 01:34:14,848
Hey!
And your partner Keira Knightley!

1651
01:34:14,873 --> 01:34:17,289
Hey! Hey! Fellas!
I will shoot the fuck out of her!

1652
01:34:17,535 --> 01:34:19,129
When we are so quick to anger,

1653
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,618
we are slow to understand.

1654
01:34:20,643 --> 01:34:22,353
Yeah, well, I am fast
to kick your ass though,

1655
01:34:22,378 --> 01:34:23,706
I swear to God.

1656
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:25,476
Fucking piece of shit!

1657
01:34:25,673 --> 01:34:27,508
I should have put a bullet through
your fucking ass!

1658
01:34:27,533 --> 01:34:29,680
When you point a finger
at someone in blame,

1659
01:34:29,705 --> 01:34:31,696
there are four fingers pointing back at you.

1660
01:34:32,922 --> 01:34:33,719
Three.

1661
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,342
That's weird.
Fuck it!

1662
01:34:35,367 --> 01:34:37,068
That's it!
You know what I could do!

1663
01:34:37,093 --> 01:34:38,637
We before me!
Get off! Get the fuck off me!

1664
01:34:38,662 --> 01:34:39,996
You before fucking God!

1665
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:41,216
Gentlemen!

1666
01:34:41,763 --> 01:34:42,850
Get off me!

1667
01:34:43,568 --> 01:34:46,328
A plum, does not resent the hungry man,

1668
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,635
but the farmer, who planted the tree.

1669
01:34:50,858 --> 01:34:51,882
He resents the...

1670
01:34:52,014 --> 01:34:53,168
Resents the farmer?

1671
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:55,121
So how do plum-plums have
fucking resentments now?

1672
01:34:55,146 --> 01:34:56,513
So how can it resent?
Listen.

1673
01:34:56,977 --> 01:34:59,239
The White Death is the farmer.

1674
01:35:01,068 --> 01:35:01,809
So we...

1675
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:03,614
we are the plums.
We are the plums?

1676
01:35:03,802 --> 01:35:06,091
It don't make sense. Why are you
motherfuckers using metaphors?

1677
01:35:06,116 --> 01:35:07,817
Look, he shot my fucking brother!

1678
01:35:07,842 --> 01:35:09,403
You shot my son!

1679
01:35:13,047 --> 01:35:14,840
We prepare together,

1680
01:35:15,843 --> 01:35:17,317
or we die alone.

1681
01:35:19,215 --> 01:35:20,684
That's all I was trying to say.

1682
01:35:24,626 --> 01:35:26,747
The White Death waits for you

1683
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:29,179
with his army of assassins.

1684
01:35:29,588 --> 01:35:32,426
Killers from all countries.

1685
01:35:32,926 --> 01:35:35,041
But he has no idea

1686
01:35:35,303 --> 01:35:38,041
my son and I are on this train.

1687
01:35:38,673 --> 01:35:40,056
If fate wills,

1688
01:35:40,884 --> 01:35:42,811
I will get my revenge.

1689
01:35:44,345 --> 01:35:46,133
I will head for the back

1690
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:48,122
and stop as many as I can.

1691
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:49,961
I will go to the driver car

1692
01:35:50,096 --> 01:35:52,234
and get us the fuck out of here.

1693
01:35:56,952 --> 01:35:58,324
What are you gonna do,

1694
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:59,818
Joburg?

1695
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:03,232
I am gonna buy us some time.

1696
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:02,345
<font color="#f2ffc0">Daughter.</font>

1697
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:05,342
<font color="#f2ffc0">Father.</font>

1698
01:37:13,534 --> 01:37:14,400
Hey...

1699
01:37:14,424 --> 01:37:16,620
fellas, I am looking for a Mr. Death.

1700
01:37:16,733 --> 01:37:18,144
Got his case here.

1701
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,443
Hey easy.

1702
01:37:28,456 --> 01:37:30,072
Hurt people hurt people.

1703
01:37:37,012 --> 01:37:38,480
I came to see you.

1704
01:37:40,848 --> 01:37:43,002
And to make you finally see me.

1705
01:37:44,998 --> 01:37:46,541
<font color="#f2ffc0">The real me.</font>

1706
01:37:49,511 --> 01:37:52,765
<font color="#f2ffc0">I built myself up
from the nothing you gave me.</font>

1707
01:37:53,228 --> 01:37:55,796
<font color="#f2ffc0">All so I could be
the one in front of you today...</font>

1708
01:37:57,102 --> 01:37:58,421
<font color="#f2ffc0">my finger on the trigger.</font>

1709
01:38:00,863 --> 01:38:01,926
<font color="#f2ffc0">I was the one...</font>

1710
01:38:03,548 --> 01:38:05,535
<font color="#f2ffc0">who deserved your attention.</font>

1711
01:38:09,703 --> 01:38:10,749
<font color="#f2ffc0">Your love.</font>

1712
01:38:12,075 --> 01:38:15,704
<font color="#f2ffc0">I am more like you
than that little fuck up ever was.</font>

1713
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:30,458
Do it.

1714
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,630
I came here to kill you.

1715
01:38:36,974 --> 01:38:38,219
So kill me.

1716
01:38:40,722 --> 01:38:43,470
Kill me like you did all
the others who tried the same.

1717
01:38:54,969 --> 01:38:55,828
Do it.

1718
01:39:02,309 --> 01:39:03,676
Fucking do it!

1719
01:39:07,716 --> 01:39:08,489
Pow!

1720
01:39:09,481 --> 01:39:10,252
Pow.

1721
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,103
I see you dochka.

1722
01:39:20,281 --> 01:39:22,200
<font color="#f2ffc0">I always have.</font>

1723
01:39:24,773 --> 01:39:28,273
<font color="#f2ffc0">But you have never
been part of my plan.</font>

1724
01:39:34,496 --> 01:39:35,798
We found the American!

1725
01:39:39,121 --> 01:39:40,582
What about the others?

1726
01:39:40,682 --> 01:39:41,950
They are all dead.

1727
01:39:43,089 --> 01:39:45,394
Good news is I... have your case.

1728
01:39:46,792 --> 01:39:47,845
Ay, good news,

1729
01:39:47,869 --> 01:39:49,189
good news.

1730
01:39:49,214 --> 01:39:50,873
<font color="#f2ffc0">Check the case.</font>

1731
01:39:50,925 --> 01:39:51,736
Hurry.

1732
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,427
Move. Let's go.

1733
01:39:54,923 --> 01:39:56,174
<font color="#f2ffc0">Clear the train.</font>

1734
01:39:58,565 --> 01:39:59,667
Alright Thomas.

1735
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:02,002
Time for you to start up...

1736
01:40:02,135 --> 01:40:03,994
Oh shit, everything is in Japanese.

1737
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:06,674
There is no episode in Japanese.
What the f...

1738
01:40:10,984 --> 01:40:12,323
Get on the ground!

1739
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:21,257
Man, I got a bad feeling about this.

1740
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:23,289
We have no idea what's in this case.

1741
01:40:23,314 --> 01:40:24,526
Man, what are you talking about?

1742
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:27,078
Why is it always got to be us
that opens this shit?

1743
01:40:27,103 --> 01:40:28,632
Just open the goddamn case.

1744
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:30,572
I would like to keep my fucking arms.

1745
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:33,903
Mr. Death, if I may?

1746
01:40:34,997 --> 01:40:36,692
The shadow buyer...

1747
01:40:37,437 --> 01:40:39,104
<i>who bought all our contracts,</i>

1748
01:40:39,128 --> 01:40:41,132
<i>got us all on this this train and me...</i>

1749
01:40:41,455 --> 01:40:43,678
<i>the Hornet, Tangerine, Lemon...</i>

1750
01:40:45,624 --> 01:40:47,265
That was you right?

1751
01:40:47,812 --> 01:40:49,734
Yes, very astute.

1752
01:40:50,283 --> 01:40:52,929
I brought you on this train
hoping you would kill each other.

1753
01:40:53,085 --> 01:40:54,585
Ok. Well...

1754
01:40:55,952 --> 01:40:57,500
If-if I could...

1755
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:58,801
Why?

1756
01:40:59,075 --> 01:41:00,645
Why you do what you do?

1757
01:41:01,261 --> 01:41:03,543
You know, I have been asking
that very question.

1758
01:41:04,098 --> 01:41:06,199
If it's so safe, why didn't he just open it?

1759
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,636
What if it's a bomb
and it blows up in our faces?

1760
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,142
You think these stupid masks
are gonna protect us?

1761
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:18,587
<font color="#f2ffc0">All these years later...</font>

1762
01:41:18,971 --> 01:41:20,729
<font color="#f2ffc0">the burden of your betrayal,</font>

1763
01:41:20,753 --> 01:41:23,172
<font color="#f2ffc0">still heavy upon your heads.</font>

1764
01:41:25,547 --> 01:41:27,711
<font color="#f2ffc0">Let me relieve you of both.</font>

1765
01:41:29,363 --> 01:41:30,366
My wife...

1766
01:41:31,802 --> 01:41:33,273
was taken from me.

1767
01:41:36,468 --> 01:41:39,132
I heard.
I am so sorry for your loss.

1768
01:41:39,312 --> 01:41:40,835
It was a horrible accident...

1769
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,561
Horrible.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1770
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:45,991
No.

1771
01:41:46,598 --> 01:41:48,436
Nothing in life is an accident.

1772
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:51,578
It was an assassination attempt on me.

1773
01:41:52,048 --> 01:41:53,202
But fate...

1774
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:58,202
fate put two wet work operatives,

1775
01:41:58,813 --> 01:41:59,643
twins,

1776
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:02,320
on a job in Bolivia...

1777
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:06,836
Butchering my entire crew.

1778
01:42:06,867 --> 01:42:09,450
And I had to go deal with it.

1779
01:42:09,638 --> 01:42:12,240
And he didn't hire
two random operators Lemon?

1780
01:42:12,265 --> 01:42:14,677
No, he asked for the two responsible
for the Bolivia job.

1781
01:42:14,814 --> 01:42:16,138
That is why

1782
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:18,328
it was my wife in the car,

1783
01:42:18,729 --> 01:42:19,743
that night,

1784
01:42:20,206 --> 01:42:21,308
not me.

1785
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:23,333
Fate put my wife,

1786
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:24,922
in the hospital.

1787
01:42:25,277 --> 01:42:26,170
A piece...

1788
01:42:26,444 --> 01:42:27,379
of her rib...

1789
01:42:28,355 --> 01:42:30,231
piercing her heart.

1790
01:42:32,707 --> 01:42:35,990
Only the most skilled cardiovascular surgeon

1791
01:42:36,405 --> 01:42:37,868
could save her life.

1792
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,852
But two nights earlier,

1793
01:42:41,876 --> 01:42:42,978
this surgeon...

1794
01:42:43,603 --> 01:42:44,733
was poisoned.

1795
01:42:47,047 --> 01:42:49,170
Oh, my god!

1796
01:42:49,195 --> 01:42:49,982
Fate.

1797
01:42:50,312 --> 01:42:51,412
Fate again.

1798
01:42:52,391 --> 01:42:54,202
They said my money was in the case.

1799
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,950
Don't want to sound judgmental,
but if you...

1800
01:42:56,974 --> 01:42:58,278
hired the hornet,

1801
01:42:58,504 --> 01:43:00,610
you had your own kid killed?

1802
01:43:00,689 --> 01:43:01,455
Oh, yes.

1803
01:43:01,946 --> 01:43:02,625
Ok.

1804
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:03,707
Oh yes I did.

1805
01:43:03,731 --> 01:43:04,884
The piece of shit.

1806
01:43:06,331 --> 01:43:07,238
That night,

1807
01:43:08,222 --> 01:43:09,309
I told her...

1808
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:10,770
Not to leave.

1809
01:43:11,848 --> 01:43:13,017
To wait for me.

1810
01:43:14,145 --> 01:43:15,344
But she promised,

1811
01:43:15,614 --> 01:43:17,888
it was the last time
we would ever bail him,

1812
01:43:17,912 --> 01:43:19,681
out of trouble.
I will come.

1813
01:43:19,705 --> 01:43:21,304
I will always come for you.

1814
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:22,601
Well,

1815
01:43:22,851 --> 01:43:23,977
I suppose...

1816
01:43:24,312 --> 01:43:25,445
she was right.

1817
01:43:26,306 --> 01:43:29,653
If I had amputated that weakness

1818
01:43:30,443 --> 01:43:32,419
out of my life years ago,

1819
01:43:32,613 --> 01:43:35,744
she would still be by my side!

1820
01:43:35,769 --> 01:43:37,627
Yeah, it helps to process this.

1821
01:43:37,652 --> 01:43:39,169
II-I have a good therapist.

1822
01:43:39,194 --> 01:43:40,831
I loved my wife very much.

1823
01:43:42,256 --> 01:43:44,292
She taught me a valuable lesson.

1824
01:43:44,804 --> 01:43:46,867
If you do not control your fate...

1825
01:43:48,296 --> 01:43:49,710
It will control you.

1826
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:53,403
So I took control.

1827
01:43:53,656 --> 01:43:55,778
I brought them all here to die.

1828
01:43:59,907 --> 01:44:03,543
But now there is only one left.

1829
01:44:05,475 --> 01:44:07,276
Mr. Carver.

1830
01:44:07,715 --> 01:44:08,862
Wh...

1831
01:44:08,921 --> 01:44:10,608
Excus... Excuse me?

1832
01:44:10,633 --> 01:44:12,773
I am filling in for Carver?
Calling in sick?

1833
01:44:12,954 --> 01:44:14,021
Fuck Carver.

1834
01:44:14,046 --> 01:44:16,530
The man who murdered my wife.

1835
01:44:23,202 --> 01:44:23,973
Bro.

1836
01:44:24,005 --> 01:44:25,080
Just open it!

1837
01:44:25,104 --> 01:44:26,468
Fine. You happy?

1838
01:44:26,493 --> 01:44:27,429
I am not Carver!

1839
01:44:44,384 --> 01:44:45,253
He went that way! Come...

1840
01:44:53,408 --> 01:44:54,314
Alright.

1841
01:44:54,594 --> 01:44:56,103
Oh, shit. Ok.

1842
01:44:57,732 --> 01:44:58,972
Oh, shit.
Something is happening.

1843
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:28,596
Excuse me.

1844
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:30,829
Yep.

1845
01:46:12,472 --> 01:46:13,331
<font color="#f2ffc0">Kimura.</font>

1846
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:15,855
<font color="#f2ffc0">Why are you here?</font>

1847
01:46:16,727 --> 01:46:17,800
<font color="#f2ffc0">Your daughter.</font>

1848
01:46:18,245 --> 01:46:19,815
<font color="#f2ffc0">It would seem she pushed,</font>

1849
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,266
<font color="#f2ffc0">the wrong grandson off a roof.</font>

1850
01:46:26,227 --> 01:46:27,307
Oh children!

1851
01:46:27,332 --> 01:46:29,302
You do the best you can
to raise them right.

1852
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:33,336
Cockroach, I do not know
why you are here,

1853
01:46:33,361 --> 01:46:36,202
but move out of my way
or you will join your wife.

1854
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:40,334
Our paths were destined
to return to each other.

1855
01:46:43,378 --> 01:46:44,052
Ok.

1856
01:46:44,748 --> 01:46:45,581
Right.

1857
01:46:45,606 --> 01:46:46,841
Fucking slow down mate.

1858
01:46:47,115 --> 01:46:48,009
Come on!

1859
01:46:48,034 --> 01:46:49,339
Hey, so far so good.

1860
01:46:49,364 --> 01:46:50,865
You can stop the train.

1861
01:46:51,178 --> 01:46:52,144
About that.

1862
01:46:52,168 --> 01:46:54,366
I took the velocity of the train
and divided it by the mass,

1863
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:57,029
and I realized that I don't know
how to fucking drive a bullet train!

1864
01:46:57,138 --> 01:46:59,106
Dude, all you do is talk about trains.

1865
01:46:59,131 --> 01:47:01,528
Man, Thomas is a metaphor for life,
not how to actually drive...

1866
01:47:01,552 --> 01:47:02,373
Get down!

1867
01:47:29,792 --> 01:47:30,615
Shit.

1868
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:39,149
I got this!

1869
01:47:39,524 --> 01:47:40,729
Stop the train!

1870
01:47:40,973 --> 01:47:41,901
What?

1871
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:34,694
English, English, English.

1872
01:48:35,136 --> 01:48:36,248
English, English.

1873
01:48:36,506 --> 01:48:37,229
Brakes!

1874
01:48:37,254 --> 01:48:38,777
We are good! I got it!

1875
01:48:40,721 --> 01:48:41,721
No!

1876
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:45,826
Hold on!

1877
01:48:45,851 --> 01:48:47,069
We are on the wrong track!

1878
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:03,518
Oi, Joburg!
What?

1879
01:49:06,413 --> 01:49:07,948
I am sorry I shot you!

1880
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:09,922
Actually, it was, like, twice!

1881
01:49:14,164 --> 01:49:15,122
Sorry?

1882
01:49:15,256 --> 01:49:16,880
You shot me twice!

1883
01:49:28,824 --> 01:49:30,524
Sorry I shot you twice.

1884
01:49:32,327 --> 01:49:33,358
Thanks man!

1885
01:49:34,074 --> 01:49:35,495
That shows real growth!

1886
01:49:39,519 --> 01:49:40,145
Fuck!

1887
01:49:40,692 --> 01:49:41,651
Fuck!

1888
01:49:51,681 --> 01:49:53,314
You are not ruled by strength.

1889
01:49:53,527 --> 01:49:54,995
You are ruled by fear!

1890
01:49:55,659 --> 01:49:58,777
Fear of the one thing deep down
you cannot control!

1891
01:50:06,173 --> 01:50:07,538
Fear of fate!

1892
01:50:15,852 --> 01:50:18,606
Hey and I am sorry about Tangerine.

1893
01:50:20,237 --> 01:50:21,036
Yeah.

1894
01:50:22,493 --> 01:50:23,309
Yeah.

1895
01:50:24,866 --> 01:50:26,535
But I got another brother now.

1896
01:50:26,825 --> 01:50:27,752
Really?

1897
01:50:30,741 --> 01:50:31,760
Fuck no!

1898
01:50:55,998 --> 01:50:57,530
For old times' sake.

1899
01:51:39,366 --> 01:51:40,769
Fuck it.

1900
01:52:04,438 --> 01:52:05,696
<font color="#f2ffc0">Fuck!</font>

1901
01:52:08,827 --> 01:52:09,482
Oi.

1902
01:52:11,219 --> 01:52:12,630
That will be 20.

1903
01:52:14,193 --> 01:52:15,035
Let's go.

1904
01:52:17,341 --> 01:52:18,272
Oh, mate.

1905
01:52:18,405 --> 01:52:19,140
Yeah?

1906
01:52:19,573 --> 01:52:20,941
I wanted bubble milk tea.

1907
01:52:21,075 --> 01:52:22,843
How about a wagon wheel?
Yeah.

1908
01:52:50,957 --> 01:52:51,887
<font color="#f2ffc0">Father.</font>

1909
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:53,511
<font color="#f2ffc0">A father...</font>

1910
01:52:54,192 --> 01:52:55,341
<font color="#f2ffc0">protects his family.</font>

1911
01:54:28,139 --> 01:54:30,782
Oh, fuck.

1912
01:54:34,079 --> 01:54:35,231
About your wife,

1913
01:54:35,603 --> 01:54:37,212
I had nothing to do with that.

1914
01:54:38,078 --> 01:54:39,118
It's a mistake.

1915
01:54:39,143 --> 01:54:40,811
I am not Carver.

1916
01:54:42,282 --> 01:54:44,317
I only do snatch and grab jobs.

1917
01:54:45,386 --> 01:54:47,200
The Carver, I want the Carver!

1918
01:54:47,225 --> 01:54:48,761
I hired the Carver!

1919
01:54:48,786 --> 01:54:51,325
Yeah, no, he had a stomach thing man.

1920
01:54:51,492 --> 01:54:52,957
I am just filling in.

1921
01:54:57,665 --> 01:54:58,908
You are filling in.

1922
01:54:59,299 --> 01:55:00,298
For what it's worth,

1923
01:55:00,431 --> 01:55:01,744
Carver is a dick.

1924
01:55:02,336 --> 01:55:03,968
The most cunning assassin...

1925
01:55:04,859 --> 01:55:06,476
maybe the laziest but...

1926
01:55:16,082 --> 01:55:17,129
Come on.

1927
01:55:18,247 --> 01:55:19,941
Just let it go, bro.

1928
01:55:20,154 --> 01:55:22,720
Do not call me bro!

1929
01:55:24,224 --> 01:55:25,400
Ok.

1930
01:55:41,237 --> 01:55:42,456
Dude, did you see that?

1931
01:55:43,517 --> 01:55:44,674
What was that?

1932
01:55:51,135 --> 01:55:51,834
Dude.

1933
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:55,198
<font color="#f2ffc0">It's done.</font>

1934
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,573
Hey, about this plum.

1935
01:56:09,598 --> 01:56:12,011
Shouldn't the plum give up all resentment?

1936
01:56:12,372 --> 01:56:13,209
Like...

1937
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:16,117
Oh, my god.

1938
01:56:16,142 --> 01:56:17,250
It's my luck...

1939
01:56:17,633 --> 01:56:18,770
that delivered...

1940
01:56:19,146 --> 01:56:21,849
my father's corpse at my feet.

1941
01:56:21,983 --> 01:56:23,986
The narcissism on this chick.

1942
01:56:24,585 --> 01:56:25,586
Untreatable.

1943
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:28,116
Now I am...
Ok, wait, wait.

1944
01:56:28,355 --> 01:56:29,983
Wait.
What?

1945
01:56:30,257 --> 01:56:32,460
What is with this fucked up family?

1946
01:56:33,327 --> 01:56:34,893
You need some suggested reading,

1947
01:56:34,987 --> 01:56:35,900
if I may.

1948
01:56:36,397 --> 01:56:38,561
Surviving borderline personality disorder.

1949
01:56:38,811 --> 01:56:39,480
What?

1950
01:56:39,504 --> 01:56:41,316
I highly recommend it.
Now I...

1951
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,316
I am the White dea...

1952
01:56:46,555 --> 01:56:47,689
What was that?

1953
01:56:51,369 --> 01:56:52,914
Was that kar... was that Karma?

1954
01:56:52,939 --> 01:56:53,786
Farewell.

1955
01:56:54,536 --> 01:56:55,721
Tentōu mushi.

1956
01:56:57,962 --> 01:56:58,871
Tangerine.

1957
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:18,338
Maria?

1958
01:57:18,455 --> 01:57:19,306
Take the gun.

1959
01:57:19,331 --> 01:57:20,771
Oh, my god, did you just say whack?

1960
01:57:20,796 --> 01:57:23,198
We are almost there.
You just need to get up.

1961
01:57:23,510 --> 01:57:24,978
Did you come to rescue me?

1962
01:57:26,054 --> 01:57:27,547
Did you need rescuing?

1963
01:57:27,789 --> 01:57:29,224
You came to rescue me.

1964
01:57:29,249 --> 01:57:30,785
Please don't make me regret it.

1965
01:57:32,565 --> 01:57:33,796
Ok, don't. Don't.

1966
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:35,320
What's happening to your face?

1967
01:57:35,345 --> 01:57:36,429
Are you, are you crying?

1968
01:57:36,924 --> 01:57:38,343
It's a lot to process.

1969
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:40,136
I want you to know,

1970
01:57:40,475 --> 01:57:41,880
you are the greatest,

1971
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:43,336
most wonderful,

1972
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:44,765
handler

1973
01:57:44,823 --> 01:57:45,991
that I could ever have.

1974
01:57:46,016 --> 01:57:46,756
Ever.

1975
01:57:47,105 --> 01:57:47,838
Ever.

1976
01:57:48,266 --> 01:57:49,092
Do you think...

1977
01:57:49,514 --> 01:57:51,114
maybe there was a little head trauma?

1978
01:57:51,346 --> 01:57:52,674
Maybe.
Little bit, yeah.

1979
01:57:52,807 --> 01:57:54,010
A little lightheaded.
Yeah.

1980
01:57:54,119 --> 01:57:55,059
Need a banana?

1981
01:57:55,293 --> 01:57:56,442
Potassium might be good.

1982
01:57:56,467 --> 01:57:57,568
Have one in the car.

1983
01:57:58,146 --> 01:57:58,726
Hey,

1984
01:57:59,075 --> 01:58:00,442
next time, take the gun.

1985
01:58:00,775 --> 01:58:01,848
Don't listen to Barry.

1986
01:58:02,021 --> 01:58:02,855
Ok?

1987
01:58:02,879 --> 01:58:03,755
Simple?

1988
01:58:06,477 --> 01:58:07,562
Stop it.

1989
01:58:08,562 --> 01:58:09,383
Stop.

1990
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,868
You know, I think you were
right about one thing.

1991
01:58:10,893 --> 01:58:12,234
Usually am. Come on.

1992
01:58:12,432 --> 01:58:13,576
Maybe it is,

1993
01:58:13,775 --> 01:58:15,000
just about how we frame it.

1994
01:58:15,025 --> 01:58:17,081
Like, maybe there is no bad luck
or good luck.

1995
01:58:17,106 --> 01:58:18,841
Maybe we are all just agents of fate.

1996
01:58:19,744 --> 01:58:21,166
Nice car.
Yes, it is.

1997
01:58:21,535 --> 01:58:22,824
Try not to bleed on it.

1998
01:58:29,956 --> 01:58:32,729
Holy mol...

1999
01:58:34,849 --> 01:58:35,917
Well...

2000
01:58:37,581 --> 01:58:39,488
How do you know it's a bad thing?

2001
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,757
Really?

2002
01:58:42,803 --> 01:58:43,855
See what I am doing?

2003
01:58:44,268 --> 01:58:44,926
I do.

2004
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:46,232
Turning that upside down.

2005
01:58:46,257 --> 01:58:46,943
I do.

2006
01:58:48,248 --> 01:58:49,337
This is working.

2007
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:51,020
Yeah.

2008
01:58:57,819 --> 01:58:58,906
Wasabi peas.

2009
01:58:59,569 --> 01:59:01,700
Fate obviously didn't want me
to have that banana.

2010
01:59:01,943 --> 01:59:04,244
Fate did not want us to get in that car.

2011
01:59:04,269 --> 01:59:04,991
Well,

2012
01:59:05,015 --> 01:59:06,753
maybe you have
learned something after all.

2013
01:59:07,597 --> 01:59:09,370
Fate needs me to find a smart toilet.

2014
01:59:09,464 --> 01:59:10,590
I take that back.

2015
01:59:10,792 --> 01:59:11,682
Can you hold it?

2016
01:59:11,707 --> 01:59:13,308
I am ball pointing.
Walk faster.

2017
01:59:13,488 --> 01:59:14,300
Ok. Yeah.

2018
01:59:17,457 --> 01:59:20,465

2019
01:59:40,977 --> 01:59:41,954
I am alive!

2020
01:59:41,978 --> 01:59:43,008
I am Ali...

2021
01:59:43,506 --> 01:59:44,749
Oh, fuck me.

01:59:44,882 --> 01:59:45,742
Fuck me.

Come on, you fucker.

Fuck you!

2025
02:00:01,803 --> 02:00:02,770
Tangerines?

2026
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:04,138
Fuck Diesels.
I...

2027
02:00:05,688 --> 02:00:07,389
Fuck you, Diesel bitch!
I am the white d...

2028
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:11,145
Final curtain?

2029
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:12,479
Final curtain!

2030
02:00:12,504 --> 02:00:14,073
Take a fucking bow!

2031
