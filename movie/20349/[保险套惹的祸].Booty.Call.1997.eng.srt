1
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,133
How you do it? Just throw like this?

2
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,692
Look like I won it.

3
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,204
Get your hands off my money. Please.

4
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,036
I ain't never gonna go broke.

5
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,299
Roll that shit again.

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,073
Brother, put your money in.
Can't win unless you play.

7
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,581
Throw it in there. There we go.

8
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,083
Am I right?

9
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,176
Oops. Slipped right out of my hands.

10
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,678
We got to go.

11
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,691
Seriously, his sister's
got some ill will.

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,695
This goes to a good cause.
Sorry I got to go.

13
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,891
To keep your shit,
you got to know when to quit.

14
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,263
Let's leave. Quickly.

15
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,167
Brothers, stay broke.
I mean, stay black.

16
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,206
Lucky you stopped me. I was about to
buy a condo in midtown.

17
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,036
- Lucky I stopped you?
- Hell, yeah.

18
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,103
I can tell Nikki, "We was late because
Bunz was on his knees playing dice."

19
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,206
Playing? I was the MVP.
Hear the roar of the crowd?

20
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,976
Don't want your cut?

21
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,078
I ain't saying that.

22
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,419
Get outta my shit,
know what I'm saying?

23
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,255
I don't need your tired ass!
Go back to your stank ho!

24
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,625
She called and
left her fucking number!

25
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,530
I caught your ass in the act!
Big nose, pop eyes, receding hairline.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,262
Truth is, you can't win,
motherfucker!

27
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:21,774
Let me see you rise now, motherfucker!
No, I don't think so!

28
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,435
You ain't got to take that.
Jab back.

29
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,409
Hold up one motherfucking minute!

30
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,642
When I need Howard Cosell,
I will call Howard Cosell!

31
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,879
Take your fake-dredded ass,
pick up Mighty Mouse...

32
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,921
...and skippity-doo
your rank ass home!

33
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,822
Run, man!
Got a greyhound on your back!

34
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,259
That's why I don't like
relationships.

35
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,424
I strictly deal with booty calls.
3:00 a.m., no questions asked.

36
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,933
I don't want to do this blind date.

37
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,836
You go do your thing.
I'll go back and win me some money.

38
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:57,002
You can do what you want, Bunz.
But this girl is fine.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,476
Miss Butterworth, fine.

40
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,036
It's up to you.

41
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,274
Miss Butterworth gives me gas.

42
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,251
Define "fine."
What does the girl look like?

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,312
I ain't sitting at the table
with no wildebeest.

44
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,655
I got a reputation.
You know what I'm saying?

45
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:17,093
What about that fruit bat
you left the party with?

46
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,994
I was gonna tell you about that.

47
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,829
That girl put something
in my drink, man.

48
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,994
I wouldn't go out like that.

49
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,765
The girl had a beard.

50
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,169
She did not.

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,673
Hair.

52
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,836
She did not have a beard.
She had a real thin goatee.

53
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,375
<i>If your girl ain't Chinese...</i>

54
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,644
...why the hell she live in Chinatown?

55
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:43,655
Good neighborhood, nice apartment.
Her girlfriend lives across the hall.

56
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,215
The girlfriend is Chinese.
You thought I'd be upset.

57
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,228
I don't mind Rice Krispies
on my plate.

58
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,562
- She know how to pan fry this noodle.
- She's not Chinese.

59
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,397
Then what's going on?

60
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,905
Chinese or not, she could
snuggle up on these egg rolls.

61
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,840
You know what I'm saying?
They lower in fat.

62
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,002
That's why I never take you nowhere.

63
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,545
You take me everywhere.

64
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,639
<i>If I was a girl, we'd be dating.</i>

65
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,844
Rushon's friend is cute, right?

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,853
He's cute enough.

67
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,481
No, no, no. You said he was cute.

68
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,151
I'm not asking you
to have his baby...

69
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,320
...just run a little
interference for me.

70
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,993
But he does have class though, right?

71
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,127
I do not mess with anyone
who does not have class.

72
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,197
Trust me. He is in a class
all by hisself.

73
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,042
What kind of name is "Lystie?"

74
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,672
It's short for Lysterine.

75
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,616
That's mouthwash. What's up
with these whack-ass names?

76
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,950
I went out with this girl
named Genoria.

77
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,458
She spelled it, "Gonorrhea."
I can't put that on a postcard.

78
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,459
It's Lysterine with a Y, not an I.

79
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,394
That makes all the difference
in the world.

80
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,330
The point is
you're doing this for me.

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,561
I've gone out with Nikki
for 7 weeks...

82
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,160
And you ain't hit that ass yet?

83
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,297
Hey, man, I like her.

84
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,574
Nikki, why are you taking so long?

85
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,236
I can't go out like this.

86
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,779
Like what?

87
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,077
My cleavage is hanging out.

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,913
Cleavage?

89
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,954
I don't want to send out
the wrong signal.

90
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,287
Anyone that's put up with you
for 7 weeks deserves some nay-nay.

91
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,188
Oh, really?

92
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,456
Why are you making Rushon
wait so long?

93
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,797
He seems like he's a good man.
He's got a career. He treats you nice.

94
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,563
I know.

95
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,299
I want to make sure
he's the right one.

96
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,035
Just don't leave me alone with him.

97
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,942
Then he's not the only one feeling
the seven week itch.

98
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,277
It is not even like that.

99
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,182
You better watch that smile, then.

100
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,515
Can we please go?

101
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,853
This is how I pick the situation:

102
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,119
This is how I pick the situation:

103
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,351
College got you too sensitive.

104
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,392
Sensitive?

105
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,451
You ain't got no player left in you.

106
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,396
I wouldn't let the sun rise
without tagging that ass.

107
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,630
I'd have that ass bouncing like
a low rider in a Dr. Dre video.

108
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,469
I say, "Nikki, tonight is the night.
A one-time offer."

109
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,806
She want to give it to you tomorrow,
you say, "Tomorrow's too late."

110
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,403
- It's not that simple.
- Not for somebody who's slipping.

111
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,176
Put me in the players' section.

112
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,683
I'm not slipping.

113
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,617
Like a rug.

114
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,680
Nikki and I will do our thing tonight.

115
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,953
She knows it and I know it.

116
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,358
I didn't mean to disrespect you.

117
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:41,526
But you're a gambling man. Why not put
your money where your mack is?

118
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,035
I won't bet money
on something like that.

119
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,038
Let's just make it a gentlemen's bet.

120
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,471
We're gentlemen.

121
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,037
Let this go.

122
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,807
Come on, big daddy, big player,
big pimp, big baller...

123
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,784
That's my boy. You go the fuck on.

124
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,516
He's celebrating his bar mitzvah.
He just got circumcised.

125
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,524
Go on with your food.

126
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,296
Oh, Rushon! It's so good
to see you this evening!

127
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,697
And who is your friend?

128
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:19,363
Hello. My name is Chan and
I'm here to serve you tonight.

129
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,134
We're waiting on our dinner guests.

130
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,705
I think your hair is three things:

131
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,510
Fab-u-lous!

132
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,953
I got three things for you:
Back up, Yoko Ono.

133
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,388
Nigga, please.

134
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,921
They're here.

135
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:49,764
These girls got a lot of class. So act
like you got a little bit of sense.

136
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,272
Like you got a mama and
weren't mixed up in a test tube.

137
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,206
We should move to a table
with better light.

138
00:07:56,275 --> 00:08:00,177
- What for?
- I can't get with ladies in muted light.

139
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,610
I need a good look.

140
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,844
Anybody can look good in dim light.

141
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:09,911
How many times you go to a club and in
the disco lights, the girl look good?

142
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,925
The next day you go pick her up,
all happy.

143
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,258
But it's high noon.
She comes out the house...

144
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,595
...and a sea donkey
climbs into your car.

145
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,261
A brother's got a right to know
what he's feeding...

146
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,032
Get up.

147
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,436
Lysterine, this is
Rushon's friend, Bunz.

148
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,744
Excuse us.

149
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,978
What do you think you are doing?

150
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:45,422
Did you see that tarantula-hair fool?
Motherfucker look like Predator.

151
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:50,258
It's just dinner, some egg rolls and
we out. Girl, why are you tripping?

152
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,661
She's not with my shit, man.

153
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,326
No, she's on you. She's just nervous.

154
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,234
It's a blind date. All right?

155
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,704
Everybody's got a weakness.

156
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,537
Who knows? You and Bunz
just might hit it off.

157
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,167
"Bunz?"

158
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,441
You blind date me with
a hood rat named Bunz?

159
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,106
Have you lost your mind?

160
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,014
No. I can't get with
a brother named Bunz.

161
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,145
No, it's Bunz with a Z, not an S.

162
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,990
You never can be too ready.

163
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,762
Just do this for me, please.

164
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,100
You owe me.

165
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,794
Big time. Let's roll.

166
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,008
Ladies, you look good.

167
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,274
What's up?

168
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,712
Nothing.

169
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,217
Are we ready to order?

170
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,311
I am. I want the shrimp fried rice.

171
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,821
Two, please.

172
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,484
I'll have prawns in garlic sauce.

173
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,222
And you, Miss Thang?

174
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,558
Excuse me?

175
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,565
You got her with the "Miss Thang."

176
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,100
You eating or just looking?

177
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,504
I want lobster tail
in butter-wine sauce.

178
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,269
We girls want a bottle of Moët.

179
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,173
Damn, girl...

180
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,042
...why you order
the most expensive shit?

181
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,275
Rushon, you need to check your boy.

182
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,047
That's what I'm talking about,
is the check.

183
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,216
The lobster don't even have a price.
It just says, "Seasonal."

184
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,727
You know that means
a brother got to pay $28.

185
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:33,788
If I get you lobster and some Moët,
you know what's happening after that.

186
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,800
No, what does happen?

187
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,462
I'm going deep sea diving.

188
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,964
My platinum card.

189
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,408
I could buy and sell your ashy black,
blue-collared ass.

190
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,946
Is that so?

191
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,481
Yes, it is.

192
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,345
Well, looky here.

193
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,445
What is that?

194
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,351
It's a gold gas card.

195
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,516
That means I could buy
all the gas I want...

196
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,288
...in all 50 states
and 11 foreign countries.

197
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,226
I got privileges too.

198
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,629
If you buy enough gas,
they give you coffee mugs.

199
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,533
A gas card?
You don't even got a car.

200
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,730
Why you putting me on Front Street?

201
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,969
I'll have you know I laid away
a '68 Chevy Super Sport...

202
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,944
...with a 427-cubic inch twin cam...

203
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,413
...with a Hurst gear shift.

204
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:27,578
Sounds like a man with some serious
doubts about his manhood.

205
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:31,180
Those cars are nothing but extensions
of your penis...

206
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,747
...or lack thereof.

207
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,024
You're right.
My dick is only 2 inches...

208
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,530
...from the ground.

209
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,025
Isn't he grand?

210
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,266
Can't get a brother's order straight.

211
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,596
Can't get a brother's order straight.

212
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,938
Look, I ordered shrimp fried rice.
Can I get some shrimp?

213
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,204
There is one shrimp here...

214
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,280
...and another shrimp here.

215
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:00,045
What's all the green leafy stuff.
To fool me with shrubbery?

216
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,021
Child, that's garnishment.

217
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,024
Make your food look good.

218
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,687
What'll make my food look good
is 5 extra shrimp.

219
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,430
I thought there was no smoking here.

220
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,695
I'll take care of this.

221
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,364
Sit down.

222
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,898
That's the notorious Ug Lee,
godfather of the Leuang Triad.

223
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,535
He runs Chinatown.

224
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,272
I got all his albums.

225
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,177
I'll tell him you said hi.

226
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,256
You probably thought
I was just a common hood rat.

227
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,427
I didn't know you spoke Chinese.

228
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,762
I couldn't speak it to your ass.

229
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,324
Where'd you learn?

230
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,498
My and my father always watched
kung fu movies.

231
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,006
They got subtitles.

232
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,440
Our TV didn't have a vertical hold.

233
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,877
I'd get the kung fu videos
and listen to them.

234
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,711
Bit by bit, I started understanding
the motherfuckers.

235
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,047
One time I went to a Chinese laundry...

236
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,883
...and what sounded like,
"Ping, ting, pang"...

237
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,547
...started making sense.

238
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,648
Why not just buy a new TV?

239
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,387
Everybody ain't got no platinum card.

240
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,759
There is some poor folk in the world.

241
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,432
How's your shrimp?

242
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,398
He got none.

243
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,730
Here's one, baby.

244
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,270
You can have it.

245
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,604
My goodness, you whipped.
That boy is whipped.

246
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,241
You need to pay attention and learn.

247
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,376
He only gave you a crusty-ass shrimp.

248
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,183
That hood rat's emerging again.

249
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:39,411
No fighting in restaurant. Cost you
extra to fight in restaurant.

250
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,413
Fuck me?

251
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,417
My mother?

252
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,120
You are a horse-mouth bitch
motherfucker.

253
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,991
I'll stick my elbow up your ass.

254
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,945
Hold this for me, baby. Thank you.

255
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,221
Bring it. Send it.

256
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,630
That ain't nothing but beginner's luck.

257
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,790
Right.

258
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,730
A little cleavage for mommy.

259
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,996
Cleavage? She need a whole...

260
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,072
That's why you're losing.

261
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,202
I'm losing, but I ain't lost.

262
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,897
So nice. So sweet.

263
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,024
Give it up, nigger.

264
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,534
<i>I'm in the money</i>

265
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,729
<i>What</i>
<i>We in the money</i>

266
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,396
Got more cleavage.

267
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,835
Beginner's luck?

268
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,881
Shit happens.

269
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,414
- It's a little messy in here.
- Don't even worry about it.

270
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,299
- It's a little messy in here.
- Don't even worry about it.

271
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,630
It's about to get real messy. Ready?

272
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,637
I'm gonna do my thing. Here we go.

273
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,677
Where do you two think you're going?

274
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,114
We'll put on some mood music
so we can dance.

275
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,778
You've done enough dancing for tonight.

276
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,017
You got ambiance here.
You know how we do it, girl.

277
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,117
The only reason we came up here
is to play cards.

278
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,492
After that, you two are going home.

279
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,693
What is this?

280
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,101
I'm going to kick your ass.

281
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,438
Leave Killa alone. He does live here
and you are just visiting.

282
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:08,309
If we was really in China,
I'd have his ass honey-roasted.

283
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,904
Play, Nikki.

284
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,908
Somebody's cheating.

285
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,147
Something's going on.

286
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,950
I wish something was going on.

287
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,015
Y'all are just mad 'cause you losing.

288
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,027
I heard that, Rushon.

289
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,960
You slipping again.

290
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,127
A guy with a girl for 7 weeks, don't get
no intimacy and that's funny to y'all?

291
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,534
Maybe the girl wants
a relationship...

292
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,095
...and isn't interested in casual sex.

293
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,668
Maybe she wants a deeper commitment.
Maybe she wants a soul mate.

294
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,678
She's doing some soul-searching.

295
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,683
Or she got a brother
with a 9-inch dong knocking...

296
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,910
Shut up!

297
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,419
I think it's a legitimate question.

298
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,753
If I dated a girl for 7 weeks,
know what she'd be doing?

299
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,348
Playing the meat flute.

300
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,189
Riding the baloney-pony.

301
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,424
Eating tube steak,
and working a little for the gravy.

302
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,090
Can I get some?

303
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,157
Excuse me.

304
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,760
Thanks so much
for sharing that with us.

305
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,931
I tried to share this big paloosa
with you all night...

306
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,110
Boy, am I getting tired.

307
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,200
Aren't you?

308
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,576
You know, I'm getting tired myself.

309
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,706
It is getting a little late, though.

310
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,017
It is getting late.

311
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,919
Since y'all tired,
and we're tired...

312
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,219
...y'all go ahead.
We can kick it here.

313
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,818
No, let's still play cards.
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

314
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,655
- So, Lystie...
- What?

315
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,926
Can I ask you a question?

316
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,595
Ever made a brother wait 7 weeks
to get up on that thing?

317
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,833
She ain't never made
a man wait 30 minutes.

318
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,069
Do I smell a whore?

319
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,772
No, I have full confidence
in my sexuality.

320
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,281
I don't toil over it,
unlike some prudes I know.

321
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,114
Prude?

322
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:58,020
I am nobody's prude.
I just don't want to rush into sex.

323
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,718
That may be hard for you to understand.

324
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,950
Really?

325
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,624
You might understand if you cleared away
some cobwebs from your coochie...

326
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,462
Coochie cobwebs?!

327
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,167
- Why don't we just deal?
- Don't stop them now. They'll box.

328
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,437
Let's get ready to rumble!

329
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,477
What's up? Y'all ready for another one?

330
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,049
I'd rather be shopping.

331
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,986
Where is the love in this room?

332
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,721
I got plenty of love.
I just can't seem to get to it.

333
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,063
Do you ever stop?

334
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,559
I never stop.

335
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,034
Really?

336
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,400
Really.

337
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,596
Are we playing cards, or what?

338
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,578
Girl...

339
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,979
...your feet are kind of strong,
but the softest feet in the world.

340
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,456
Damn!

341
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,993
Get those big, jungle rot,
alligator feet off mine!

342
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,962
You'd catch a salmon
with those eagle's claws!

343
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,488
Big old cheese knots
and balls all in there.

344
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,162
You been playing soccer
with a pack of wild wolves!

345
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,173
Get your feet off me.
Look like monkey hands.

346
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,063
Oh, yeah. Suck it.

347
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,433
You play with a brother's ass.

348
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,672
You the MVP.

349
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,215
A little lower.

350
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,047
Hit me on the t'ain't.

351
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,644
It t'ain't the ass
and it t'ain't the lip.

352
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,315
Man, you talk about toe jam.

353
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,555
Let me get my head together.

354
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,195
I'm about to cramp up.

355
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,727
I got a little cramp in my leg.

356
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,568
Got any napkins?

357
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,838
You know, I think I left
my gas on on my stove.

358
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,674
Know how to work a pilot?

359
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,611
Yeah.

360
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,617
Your stove's not even hooked up yet.

361
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,711
You know, speaking of remodeling...

362
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,224
...I've got some paint samples
I need to mix.

363
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,054
Can you assist me?

364
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,220
I sure the fuck could, girl.
That's my shit.

365
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,390
Hold up. Excuse me.
Where are you going?

366
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:05,402
- We'll head on out.
- You ain't even played your hand yet.

367
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,062
We just did.

368
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,663
- Ciao.
- Lystie, wait a minute...

369
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,232
- Mind your own business.
- No, wait.

370
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,258
All you got to do is tell me
how you like it.

371
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,226
No, baby, you might think I'm freaky.

372
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,058
I don't think you're freaky.

373
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,361
It really turns me on
when a man can do impressions.

374
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,422
Imitations.

375
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,229
Like, powerful men.

376
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,240
Men of authority.
Men like Jesse Jackson.

377
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,572
- Jesse Jackson?
- Yes.

378
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,439
Do Jesse.

379
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,605
Hands that picked cotton
now pick the President.

380
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,314
Oh, shit.

381
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,685
<i>The rhinoceros is not as prolific</i>
<i>as other animals...</i>

382
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,990
<i>... but nonetheless as enthusiastic.</i>

383
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,961
<i>Watch as the 4,000-pound beast</i>
<i>rises to the occasion.</i>

384
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,964
Wax that 4,000-pound ass.

385
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,857
Killa...

386
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,904
...stop that! No!

387
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,962
Oh, it's all right.

388
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,803
He's only human, right?

389
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,969
You didn't pet Killa
when Bunz was here.

390
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,740
He's a bad influence on you.

391
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,816
Just let me say that
the ass is round.

392
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,853
And you know that I'm down,
bipartisan.

393
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,152
And we can work it to the ground.

394
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:38,093
When I hit the skins, we can both join
together and say, "I am somebody."

395
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,528
I am somebody.

396
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,361
I am somebody.

397
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,130
- Somebody!
- Say it louder! I am somebody!

398
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,864
- Hallelujah.
- Somebody!

399
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,599
- Smack my ass!
- Hallelujah!

400
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,868
Do you know how sweet you are?

401
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,910
How nice you are?

402
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,843
Then your boys come around.

403
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,244
"What's up, nigga?"

404
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,139
Who you checking for? Me...

405
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,512
...or Bunz?

406
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,983
You.

407
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,852
- I'm the heavyweight boxing champ.
- Yes, Michael.

408
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,290
- I don't care what people think.
- Yes, Michael.

409
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,854
- It's ludicrous how soft your skin is.
- It's soft for you, baby.

410
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,025
- Like the leather on my first gloves.
- Work it.

411
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,036
- It makes me want to work out.
- Work it, Ty.

412
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,537
Work it, Mike.

413
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,369
- Just work it, Mike!
- I'm just so vicious!

414
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,703
Yes, work it!

415
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,588
Wait.

416
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,919
What? What?

417
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,027
Use a condom.
I don't want to die for this.

418
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,859
Yeah, I got a condom right in my coat.

419
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,365
- You want a condom?
- Yeah.

420
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,534
Got one.

421
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,368
Right here, like I said.

422
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,265
Safe sex.

423
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,243
Here we go, girl. I'll do my thing.

424
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,176
Wait. Stop. Stay

425
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,010
Come here, baby.

426
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,592
Oh, yes.

427
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:21,598
I'd like to take my time
while I'm knocking the boots.

428
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,726
Go, Bill.

429
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:31,702
I start with the breasts,
the nipples are so chocolaty...

430
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,277
...and smooth.

431
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,272
And then I work my way on down
to the love triangle.

432
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,319
You like it. I'm kissing it
and licking it...

433
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,150
...and thinking about sticking it.

434
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,658
When I get there,
it'll be smooth and creamy...

435
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,695
...just like the Jell-O pudding.

436
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,418
Give me...

437
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,432
Give me the goddamn condom,
you little...

438
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,406
There.

439
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,335
A dog's mouth is cleaner
than a human's.

440
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,976
You thought I'd use this
after it'd been in the dog's mouth?

441
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,985
I'll go ahead and get me another one.

442
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,748
Don't be kicking my dog.

443
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,147
You go, Bill.

444
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,326
Have your little something and a smile.

445
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,156
Yes, Bill. Feel it.

446
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,499
You got any condoms?

447
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,267
Star Date 2102:

448
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,105
I'm without contraceptives,
so please...

449
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,007
...leave me the fuck alone.

450
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,145
Damn.

451
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,150
She was really doing it with Bunz?

452
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,710
Sounded more like Bill Cosby
in there.

453
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,986
Lysterine always has been
a little kinky.

454
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,719
- I'll call her.
- No.

455
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,389
Come on, let the boy do what he do.

456
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,489
I'll do what I do.

457
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,329
Shit, it's throwing me off.

458
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,828
Let me listen.

459
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:06,996
<i>Longevity...</i>

460
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,971
<i>... has its place.</i>

461
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,908
I may not get to the mountaintop
with you, but I have a dream.

462
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,241
I have a dream too.

463
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,713
I have a dream that one day,
the valley shall be explored.

464
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,875
Explored.

465
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,216
Every hill and every mountain
shall be fondled.

466
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,224
<i>I have a dream that the rough places</i>
<i>will be laid smooth...</i>

467
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,260
...and all the crooked places
laid straight.

468
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,419
Lay it straight!

469
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,454
<i>And I can look down on</i>
<i>the voluptuous woman and say...</i>

470
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,556
What?

471
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,466
...I'll wax that ass!
I'll wax that ass.

472
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,972
- Lord have mercy! I'll wax that ass!
- Say it, brother!

473
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,531
I'll go bananas in that rump shaker.

474
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,236
Lystie, what are you doing over there?

475
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,348
Nikki, nothing.

476
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,849
My ass.

477
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,444
You're not having unprotected sex
with Martin Luther King.

478
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,456
<i>Unsafe sex can be deadly.</i>
<i>You know</i> that.

479
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,057
Dr. King's about to rock my world.

480
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,554
Girl, have you lost your mind?

481
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,896
You don't know where he came from.

482
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,766
Girl, you better go get you a condom.

483
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,733
You take a hard look at Bunz...

484
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,572
...and tell me you don't need a condom.

485
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,202
I ain't got nothing to do with this.

486
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,118
What the problem is?
We going to do this, or what?

487
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,317
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,623
Don't worry about it.
Let's just go get the condoms.

489
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,687
No, it is not what you think.

490
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,198
Yes, it is.

491
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,963
Nikki's about to get her groove on.

492
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,869
No, I told him he can go to the store...

493
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,169
...buy condoms and that's it.

494
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,141
Let's just do what we got to do.

495
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,972
I was doing what I had to do...

496
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,047
...I don't know about you,
but I did what I had to...

497
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,616
...to get what I needed to do... done.

498
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,844
You'll give him the keys to the car...

499
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,445
...and not let him drive that thing?

500
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,356
Why are you asking all these questions?

501
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,360
What are you gonna be doing?

502
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,658
You really want to know that?

503
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,220
No, I don't.

504
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,633
No? Since you asked, I feel I should
be at liberty to share it with you.

505
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,866
I've got some toys,
and I've got some ice.

506
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,032
Ice?

507
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,974
Yeah, girl. I love ice.

508
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,877
I'm gonna start at his toes
and get them to...

509
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:38,919
No, we close.

510
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,753
Yo, yo, man, we just want condoms.

511
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,487
No condoms for Yoyo! Yoyo, come here!

512
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,587
Damn!

513
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,937
He said, "Yo, man."
He's not calling my name.

514
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,203
No Yoyo.

515
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,540
Yo, yo. I understand.

516
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,877
Later on, I get to dip that soy sauce.

517
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,355
We got the girls waiting for us
back at the crib, man.

518
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,728
Girl. I have just what you need.

519
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,921
Very special.

520
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,590
Very rare.

521
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,260
Tiger penis.

522
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,033
Make you strong in all
the right places.

523
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,770
I'm already the king of the jungle,
know what I'm saying?

524
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,674
Give us your best condoms.

525
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,576
Fine, fine.

526
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,485
Lambskin. Very sensitive.

527
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,918
12-pack.

528
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,479
Leaves some feeling for your jimmy.

529
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,650
Only $38.

530
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,091
$38!

531
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,653
I ain't got 12 dicks to put that on.
I just need 1 or 2.

532
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,098
No can break box.
Only have 12-pack.

533
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:01,104
12 condom not much
for king of the jungle.

534
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,538
You trying to break my pockets, G.

535
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:07,442
Gi, my cousin. I am Chiu.

536
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,105
You want skins or what?

537
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,274
If you get those, you better
hit some Nikki skins.

538
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,874
What choice have we got?

539
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,318
You know, me, I just put the tip in.

540
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,151
You might not put that in there.

541
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,815
What are you saying?

542
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,817
Tonight...

543
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,761
Before the sun rises.

544
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,994
I only need one.
I wash it out and use it again.

545
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,831
Recycle, baby.

546
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,911
I'm back.

547
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,777
Champagne.

548
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,619
"Open me." I can do that.

549
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,225
At least I think I can...

550
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,164
Hi.

551
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,166
Just got a little excited.

552
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,744
Put this on ice?

553
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,336
Put it on ice.

554
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,612
Could do that too.

555
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,791
What's wrong?

556
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,623
Damn cardboard is sticking me.

557
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,220
Condoms.

558
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,787
Condoms.

559
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,458
Safe way to go.

560
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,369
What kind are these?

561
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,069
Condom condoms.

562
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,847
These are lambskin. Don't you listen
to the Surgeon General?

563
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,353
Lambskin condoms don't protect you
against the HIV virus.

564
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,947
Baby, I'm government tested
and grade A. Clear as a bell.

565
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,719
Don't even go there.

566
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,660
Rushon, just go to the store
and get some latex.

567
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,022
Okay? Please.

568
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,295
Latex?

569
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,134
La-tex.

570
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,532
Damn sheep.

571
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,171
Wimpy little woolly lamb chop-ass.

572
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:27,112
- Where you going?
- To take Killa for a walk.

573
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,677
I'll take Killa for a walk. Okay?

574
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:34,521
We supposed to be bonding.
Man's best friend, right?

575
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,186
You just stay put with your fine self.

576
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,957
What you got? I'll be back.

577
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,693
All right? Don't you go nowhere.

578
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,540
The condoms we got are no good!

579
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,906
I'm going to Mr. Chiu's.
They're lambskin!

580
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:57,909
What am I doing?

581
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,813
Have a good time.

582
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,909
We will!

583
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,510
Bye, Rushon.

584
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,727
Let me see who that is.
It might be important.

585
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,787
Hold on.

586
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,025
Hello.

587
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,793
Hey, Nik.

588
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,365
He'll be right out.

589
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,965
I'm not going anywhere, you hear me?

590
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,805
We spent $38 on those condoms.

591
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,538
I don't want to go out again.

592
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,342
I'm hot and bothered.
I might hurt somebody.

593
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,939
Not you. I don't hit women.

594
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,711
Relax.

595
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,652
I'll turn you every which way
but loose.

596
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,155
That's what I mean.

597
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,418
After you buy...

598
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,790
...a latex condom, okay?

599
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,026
- Okay.
- Good.

600
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,929
When I come back, we doing this.

601
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,264
We doing this. Do you understand?

602
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,098
No phone ringing.

603
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,934
If the Avon lady's at the door
I'll bust her ass...

604
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,771
...unless she got some condoms.
All right?

605
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,075
Why don't...

606
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,010
...we just wait for the Avon lady?

607
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,308
Go!

608
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,141
It's so dark outside.

609
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,411
Can you believe this?

610
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,686
Bet he's with Yoyo painting stripes
on that tiger penis.

611
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,250
She should hang
with this jungle snake.

612
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,592
- What are we gonna do?
- We?

613
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,259
What you gonna do?
I have mine going on.

614
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,929
And if this dog don't quit
sniffing on my boots...

615
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,666
...I'll show you true doggie style.

616
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,916
- Rushon. My God, my man main.
- Singh, my nigger.

617
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,981
- You should be on 125th Street.
- No, I'm a floater.

618
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,756
I work Harlem, Chinatown, Hunt's Point,
Coney Island, Hell's Kitchen.

619
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,763
I don't give a shit. I'm a floater.

620
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,163
No dogs allowed, my friend.

621
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,599
No, my brother,
that's a Seeing Eye dog.

622
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,604
See his nasty little rodent ass
out to the curb.

623
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,934
He's got a point.

624
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,032
You're looking at the dog's ass?

625
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,939
He's got a point too. 1 to 1.

626
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,773
What? I'm on your side.

627
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,369
You started the shit.

628
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,948
- Y'all got kerosene?
- Aisle 2.

629
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,607
- Aisle 3.
- You moved it?

630
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,312
- Tell me these things.
- I'll tell you everything.

631
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,379
- I'd like to fuck the dog.
- Way too much information.

632
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,330
Singh, I need some latex condoms.
Gotta be latex.

633
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,271
Mr. Black Man, I can't see you!
Come to the front!

634
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,174
This is the right place.
We have Ginza, Sheik, Hot Tamale.

635
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,336
Booty Call, Backdoor Man, Manhandlers.

636
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,936
Ramrod, Lube Job, In Deep.

637
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,778
Joy Trail, Buckwild,
and Goodyear Eagles.

638
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,716
Goodyear got a condom too?

639
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,048
Maxi-tread.

640
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,146
Give me the Sheik. No offense.

641
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,715
I'll get the same thing,
and also get some Backdoors.

642
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,627
- My God.
- Don't get them. They're for gay men.

643
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,426
Don't go there.

644
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,400
I don't know. You could be
a bit of a doo-doo chaser.

645
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,459
A sodomite, with hair like that.

646
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:10,405
Hell, no. I like the fuzzy stuff,
don't get me wrong.

647
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:13,238
My hair expresses my individuality.

648
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,904
- A sodomite.
- Or sodo-maybe.

649
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,947
Very good. High-two.

650
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,480
- Where are your condoms?
- Over there.

651
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,611
I'm watching you.

652
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,552
Mind your business.

653
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,036
- What's a sodomite, anyway?
- You don't want to know.

654
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,450
- What's a sodomite, anyway?
- You don't want to know.

655
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:32,622
I thought he was saying I was, like,
Dolemite's cousin or something.

656
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,561
Damn. I forgot Killa.

657
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,799
Shit.

658
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:38,960
Hold.

659
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,745
No, you must be firm with them. Heel!

660
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,040
Damn!

661
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,879
Come here!

662
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:59,855
Girl, that's right. He is out
right now taking care of Killa.

663
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:04,554
Looks like Rushon has worked
his way right on in, huh?

664
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:09,759
Honey, let me tell you, my man has
earned everything I'm about to give him.

665
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,629
Come here, you mutt!

666
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,195
I hate dogs.

667
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,974
I'll tell Nikki that Killa's with you
and Lysterine.

668
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,872
We can still get busy...

669
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,344
I will not get caught up
in your web of deception.

670
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,246
Rushon, one thing I don't do is lie.

671
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:03,844
When Nikki is crying on Lysterine's
shoulder, what you gonna do?

672
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,286
Let's get our story straight.

673
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,855
No story required. Come on, B.

674
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,102
What took you guys so long?

675
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,696
Killa was playing,
lost track of time.

676
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,038
This dog is so frisky. You hear me?

677
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,509
Is there something on his sweater?

678
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,137
No.

679
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,080
Nothing. It's a little
shadowy in here.

680
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,015
It's getting late.

681
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,677
Look at this.

682
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,915
Is that a strong dog or what?

683
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,924
Your dog is a trip, I'm telling you.

684
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,655
Will you play with him all night,
or come play with me?

685
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,859
I'll be right in there with you.
Go ahead. I'll be in there.

686
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,593
Don't take too long.

687
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,031
Make me get nothing.

688
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,373
Rushon, what's taking so long?!

689
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,586
What are you supposed to be?

690
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,758
Jurassic Park.
Getting prehistoric on you.

691
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,434
Come here, girl.

692
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,655
What are you doing?

693
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,160
Going downtown on the A-train.

694
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:55,324
That's great. But don't you think
we need some protection for that?

695
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,266
I went to the store, baby.
I got that.

696
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,930
You need dental dam to protect against
the exchange of bodily fluid.

697
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,203
Where do I get some dental dam?
I been to the store.

698
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,869
Plastic wrap in the kitchen.

699
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,206
In the kitchen.

700
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,644
- All right.
- Hurry.

701
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,248
Clears another hurdle.

702
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,912
Didn't know I was in the Olympics?

703
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,415
Don't tear up my kitchen, now!

704
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,618
Damn. Here you go.

705
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,987
Don't look like we be going downtown.
That's okay, babe.

706
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:31,159
It's not. I want you to go downtown.

707
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,999
See, if you go to the store...

708
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,771
...then when you come back...

709
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,266
...you do me...

710
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,172
...and I'll do you.

711
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,840
Yeah, but the store's a long... way...

712
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:51,385
Okay. To the store.

713
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,051
It's one thing
to go get some rubbers...

714
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,255
...but not get plastic wrap
for shit I don't even do.

715
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,993
I might hurt you. You're my friend,
but I might hurt you.

716
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,173
You poked me in the eye.
Cut that shit down.

717
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,674
The butt-plugs are back.

718
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,210
Got any plastic wrap?

719
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,339
In the back, next to the onions.

720
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,909
What's so funny?

721
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,053
<i>You got to lick it</i>

722
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,820
<i>Before you kick it</i>

723
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,554
<i>You've got to make it soft and wet</i>

724
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,425
<i>Before you stick it</i>

725
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,398
Camel cowboys...

726
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,163
We just want some wrap and we go.

727
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,396
Yeah.

728
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,567
Most people come in
to buy Glad Wrap at 2 a.m.

729
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,506
<i>You got to punch it</i>

730
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,339
<i>Before you munch it</i>

731
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,003
<i>You've got to work it</i>

732
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,945
<i>Before you jerk it</i>

733
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:57,946
See?

734
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,191
This is why I favor
immigration reform.

735
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,056
Just here and
you're fucking with people.

736
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,493
My God, take a breather.

737
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,457
Feel better?

738
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:09,829
Better.

739
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,390
I was just pulling your arm.

740
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,060
- Pulling your leg.
- Arm.

741
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,832
You don't say, "Pulling your arm."

742
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,499
- You always correct me.
- You are not in Bombay now.

743
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,735
I wish I was in Bombay.

744
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,674
- Then go to Bombay.
- I won't stay.

745
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,942
See who we get it from?
The cold part is they got a point.

746
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,210
These women are running us.

747
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,616
Do you see how expensive
this shit is?

748
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,620
Singh, you got anything cheaper?

749
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,786
Come up here.

750
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,122
Damn. Judge Peabody.

751
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,630
He's a Holy Roller
at my mother's church.

752
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,426
Hey, Judge.

753
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,968
Why are you out?

754
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,129
We just came to get a sandwich.

755
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,639
Ain't nothing out this late
but the devil...

756
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,402
...and the devil's helper.

757
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,840
Want that Glad Wrap?

758
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,712
Glad Wrap at 2 a. m?

759
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,447
Look like you plan on eating
more than a sandwich.

760
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,216
Your mother know what you do?

761
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,290
It's bad enough you plan to fornicate.

762
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,624
Don't compound the crime by lying.

763
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:16,632
Lies are the oil that grease the track.
The one way to desolation.

764
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,224
Now I know...

765
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,567
...that condoms and Glad Wrap
has its place...

766
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,970
...in the pantheon of safe sex.

767
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,566
But the only one way
to be totally safe...

768
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,510
...and that's abstinence and purity.

769
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,516
- And sexual frustration.
- I know how you all feel.

770
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,849
That furry temptress
seems like she calls your name.

771
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,357
She say "Come on, Rushon! Get some!
Put your hand on it!

772
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,290
Rub it on in there.

773
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,294
Suck it, you filthy..."

774
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,195
You know, things like that.
You know?

775
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,297
You got my nipples hard.

776
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,830
Watch how you talk to me.

777
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,631
I'm sorry?

778
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,197
I'm sorry for you.

779
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,243
I'm trying to help you.

780
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,073
You must be strong.

781
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,646
You have to take a pledge.

782
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:06,716
You say, "I swear
on the seal of this...

783
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,513
...great state of New York
that I would never...

784
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:12,419
Judge, we gonna do this or what?

785
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,620
Yes. Yes,
I'll be right out, miss.

786
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,627
I'll be right out.

787
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,864
That's what I'm talking about.

788
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,595
So remember what I said...

789
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,398
...because I said it.

790
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,065
And tell your mother I said hello.

791
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,535
You have a great evening.

792
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,873
Judge, you forgot your Goodyears.

793
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,038
I'll come back and get it.
I have to...

794
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,877
...take my clerk home.

795
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,680
Babe, you didn't have to
come in there.

796
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:48,316
I'm a little low on cash.
Got anything cheaper?

797
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:51,327
That's the 300.
The 100 is back on the shelf.

798
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,920
Hurry. We're running outta time.

799
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,761
I don't trust those boys.

800
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,633
I think that girl was
the Judges fuzzy temptress.

801
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,365
- Furry temptress.
- What is the difference?

802
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,202
- What is the difference?
- Fuzzy and furry...

803
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,208
- Put the money in the bag.
- We are talking.

804
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:10,679
- lf furry is here and fuzzy is here...
- Put the money in the bag.

805
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,305
Your customer.

806
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,850
You Pakistani piece of shit,
do what I say.

807
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,853
You crack addict, we are Punjabis.

808
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,684
I could pass for Pakistani.

809
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,850
These motherfuckers
are getting jacked.

810
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:28,264
When he shoots them,
I'll go get some groceries.

811
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,527
Ever use the left side of your brain?

812
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,931
Take these.

813
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,873
Let's clock this motherfucker.

814
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,316
Hurry. Give me the goddamn money.

815
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,849
Call me a Pakistani!

816
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,649
And you wonder why you're a floater.

817
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,656
Are you outta your fucking minds?!

818
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,485
Punk motherfucker.

819
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,222
You all right?

820
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:37,265
I think I got a pickle
stuck in my ass.

821
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,797
There we go.

822
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,506
Tonight.

823
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,338
- I ain't coming back out here.
- That's the spirit.

824
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,738
Something in here.

825
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,281
Man, relax.

826
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,884
Nikki, your man's home!

827
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,054
I don't wanna hear it!

828
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:05,060
I'm in the bathroom.
Why don't you get ready?

829
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,153
I am ready, girl.
I been ready.

830
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,497
Seven weeks, ready.
Shit.

831
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,498
This plastic ain't easy to come by.
You don't know what I been through.

832
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,236
But I finally got
this safe sex thing down pat.

833
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,402
Do you know what you're doing?

834
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,309
Do I know what I'm doing?

835
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,377
I know what I'm doing.

836
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,113
Say you want dental dam, I got some.

837
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,781
Build you a Hoover Dam,
is what I'll do.

838
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,619
I'll wax that ass tonight.

839
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,784
It's my turn to do what I do.

840
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,159
Shut up before I wrap your ass
like a hot dog.

841
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:12,320
My God!

842
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,828
Sit up so you get some air.

843
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,334
Sit up.

844
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,306
Breathe.
Let me help you.

845
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:28,834
You are supposed to put this
around my pelvic area, not your head.

846
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,140
Sorry, babe.

847
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,908
Let's do this.

848
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,210
- "Let's do this?"
- I'm fired up now.

849
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,176
You almost died.

850
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,690
My God, you are the only man
in this world...

851
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,622
...dumb enough to do this.

852
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,797
- Get him up!
- Get up.

853
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,465
Sit him up.

854
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,066
- Help me.
- What?

855
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,337
Pop it!

856
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:08,073
Was you gonna wait for me
to turn into a butterfly?

857
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,447
<i>Déjà vu.</i>

858
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,612
Would you lookit here.

859
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,285
I been looking.

860
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,326
I told him I was coming right back.

861
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:20,852
Bunz, did you think
you were gonna spoil or something?

862
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,866
I've got some aluminum foil
over in the cabinet.

863
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,960
I don't wanna hit no woman, but...

864
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,800
...I tell you right now...

865
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,533
Is this Def Comedy Jam?

866
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,972
What's so funny?

867
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,542
I'm sorry, baby.

868
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,474
"I'm sorry, baby."

869
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,743
I ain't never had to go through
this much shit to get a piece of ass.

870
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:43,513
They got you slipping,
now you got me slipping. I'm outta here.

871
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,248
I'm out. Come on.

872
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,017
Rushon, where you going?

873
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,081
I'm going home.

874
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,923
About time you handled
your business like a man.

875
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,862
I still got time
to make my booty call.

876
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,023
Now I...

877
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,301
I told you
about this blind date stuff.

878
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,361
Let's get a cab and get outta here.

879
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,373
- Smartest thing you said.
- Wait.

880
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,204
Don't look back.
Keep walking.

881
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:08,140
We almost got shot over this shit!

882
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,112
- Shot?!
- You heard him. Shot. I'm out of here.

883
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,512
Cabbie!

884
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,641
Cabbie!

885
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,844
- You okay?
- I'm still breathing, ain't I?

886
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,013
If you stay away from Glad Wrap.

887
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,580
- Lystie, come on.
- I'll be right over here.

888
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,592
Baby, I am so sorry.

889
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,255
I'll make it up to you.
We can go upstairs...

890
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,456
Damn.

891
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,759
If you's thinking about trying
to get in good with me...

892
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,533
...and kissing me, forget all that.

893
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,096
Forgotten.

894
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,539
Good.

895
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,304
Can I get a damn cab?

896
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,309
Damn!

897
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,541
What does a brother have to do
for a cab?

898
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,310
Rushon, help me out.

899
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,874
You say something?

900
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,976
I see what's going on.

901
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:54,683
You're gonna get yours a little
before sunrise and win the bet.

902
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,353
What bet?!

903
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:05,525
Can you repeat the question?
I got a bum ear.

904
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,502
It's just a figure of speech,
that's all.

905
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,972
Like, "How much you bet I'll be tapping
that ass before sunrise?"

906
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,135
That kind of figure of speech?

907
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:17,338
- Did you have a bet going on?
- No.

908
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,846
No.

909
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,349
Hell, no.
That would be degrading.

910
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,851
Completely degrading.

911
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,683
This is just a harmless challenge.

912
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,450
- Exactly.
- Challenge.

913
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:30,960
Between guys, talking about bitches
and hoes and...

914
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,188
Baby, that's all right.
I got it.

915
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,233
It's like a guy thing.
Kind of like high-fiving?

916
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,362
Right.
Like a high-five.

917
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,371
Did you hear?
It's a guy thing.

918
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,467
I heard.

919
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,372
Us girls have our thing too.

920
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,707
It's not a high-five.
It's a high-one!

921
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,747
And to you too.
Let's go.

922
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,510
Nikki, please...

923
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,517
Rushon, you bet on me.

924
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:58,850
You gonna listen to Bunz?
Nikki, he's crazy.

925
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,516
I would never do something like...

926
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,185
- Listen, please.
- I'm listening.

927
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,455
I fucked up.
I mean, a little bit.

928
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,723
Look here.

929
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,021
I'm glad you stopped.

930
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,125
You don't steal my car!

931
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,897
What's up with the gun?

932
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,105
You fucked up now.
I should bust your ass.

933
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,736
Sorry! I don't wanna cork you!

934
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:27,678
Shit!!

935
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,118
<i>I gotta get the hell out, man.</i>

936
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:36,181
Shit is too crazy. I'll go back
to Africa, to the roots.

937
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,588
Let's take a bite of the Big Apple.
The night's young.

938
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:46,431
We're going to the hospital to get you
stitched and cleaned up.

939
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,095
Then we're going home.

940
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:50,639
This is only a flesh wound. See?

941
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:56,100
Them old-school niggers could take
4 or 5 bullets to the ass...

942
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,146
...not go to the hospital.

943
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:01,911
They don't make niggers
like they used to. Rock hard.

944
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,850
I hurt my finger.
Kiss it.

945
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,588
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

946
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,253
Welcome to "Slipping-Ass Brother."

947
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,922
Carla, you're on the phone
from Alabama.

948
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,023
Does the young buck in the back...

949
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,091
...know how to fetch
and roll over, too?

950
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:22,104
'Cause he begs good as hell.

951
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,141
Rushon, straighten up for your boy.

952
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,800
What will it take for you to shut up?

953
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,248
It's funny you ask.

954
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,317
It was a bet, but it wasn't a bet.

955
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,823
Not now.

956
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:44,155
Like I said, it's a flesh wound.

957
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,491
We don't want it to get infected.

958
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,087
Like I said...

959
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,496
..."No insurance."

960
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,000
Ain't this a shame.

961
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,366
We in the richest country in the world,
the land of the brave...

962
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,428
...the home of the beautiful...

963
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,371
...and he can't get his leg sewn up?

964
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,466
This is not the time or the place.

965
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,045
It is the place.
It says, "Emergency."

966
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:07,139
It doesn't say, "Emergency unless you
ain't got no insurance card."

967
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,581
Shut up.

968
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,118
Cool. "Shut up."

969
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,314
I'll go get you a parrot
to go with your peg leg.

970
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,990
I got insurance.
I just don't have my card on me.

971
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,154
No card, no cure.

972
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,165
You don't understand the severity
of this situation.

973
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,098
This man has been shot.

974
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,864
I don't know where you received
your training...

975
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,866
I apologize for my friends.
It's been a very long night.

976
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,309
There must be a way
to verify his insurance.

977
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:39,678
All the information you need
is on the forms.

978
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,547
Like I said, little Miss Fugee...

979
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,383
...no card, no cure!

980
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:48,219
Look, bitch,
either you make the call...

981
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:52,387
...or I'll come snatch that wig
off your bald head!

982
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,829
I will stick this clipboard
so far up your...

983
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,666
Rushon Askins?

984
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,265
You Rushon?

985
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,567
Rushon Askins, right here.

986
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,504
- Rushon Askins.
- That's what I'm asking.

987
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,099
Fool, get your ass down.

988
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,078
We've already pre-admitted
this patient.

989
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,808
I have his forms.

990
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,716
We must get him to triage
because his wound's severe.

991
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,811
Yes, Dr. Zevroloski.

992
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,150
But aren't you...

993
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,316
Yes, I am.
I'm very attracted to you.

994
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,259
These beautiful eyes,
those cheek bones, that smile...

995
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,387
...and I love that little moustache.

996
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,091
But do something with the Chia Pet.

997
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:34,000
Listen. You and your mama have
to wait behind the yellow line.

998
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,563
- Mama?!
- Yes, your motherfucking mama.

999
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,332
He don't mean I look old.

1000
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,503
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1001
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:47,709
I watched "ER" all the time,
till they cut the brother's part down.

1002
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:50,378
Somebody died.
They tried to blame it on him.

1003
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,117
My patient needs assistance.

1004
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:59,389
Sure, Doctor.
Roll him over there, please.

1005
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,953
I think it's just a flesh wound.

1006
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,898
- Help me get him in the bed.
- You do look frail.

1007
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,733
Brother, get you up here.

1008
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,965
There we go.
What I wanna do is...

1009
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,132
...turn him around so you can see him.

1010
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,733
The vital signs seem to be...

1011
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,239
The forehead fever...

1012
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,110
...is, stable.

1013
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,947
I got to run.
I got a 1-Adam-12 down the hall.

1014
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,854
I'll leave you here with him.
You can handle this.

1015
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,289
Sure, Doctor...

1016
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,621
...Zevroloski?

1017
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,026
Well, Zevroloski was my first name.

1018
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:37,294
I'm part German and part Jamaican.
Ger-maican.

1019
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:44,066
Damn Caribbean medical schools.

1020
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:48,577
Dr. Moore needs help in Obstetrics.
She's having a baby.

1021
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,703
It ain't mine.

1022
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,575
No, it's her patient.

1023
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,617
Well, let's get it on.
Is she naked?

1024
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,351
Hurts good, doesn't it?

1025
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,119
I'm gonna give you something
for the pain.

1026
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:10,528
It'll help you relax.
It might make you drowsy.

1027
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,967
But you're gonna feel
a whole lot better.

1028
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:18,665
Nice.

1029
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,777
Pleasant dreams.

1030
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:31,018
What's the problem?

1031
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,682
My residency is in emergency Peds,
not Obstetrics.

1032
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:38,853
The patient is multi-gravida
with aggravated lateral distension...

1033
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,419
...with an oblique inguinal hernia...

1034
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:44,591
...impacting the epigastric artery.

1035
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,101
Ever go to Nell's on Ladies' Night?

1036
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,334
Because it's free before 10,
got a brand new DJ.

1037
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,372
Don't worry.
Let me tell you something about men.

1038
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:00,745
They good for one thing, and most
of them don't even do that right.

1039
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:05,754
Talking all that mess about how big
they are, how much stamina they got...

1040
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,346
...all that mess about...

1041
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:11,359
..."Ooh, whose is this?
Whose is this? Whose is this?"

1042
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:14,760
Know what I tell 'em?
You don't even know 'im.

1043
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:18,198
They bet on us like we
some dogs at a race track.

1044
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,098
They not human, baby.

1045
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:24,265
They may seem like it.
We both eat and breathe the same.

1046
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,798
But look at a brother like Bunz.
Does he act human?

1047
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:30,107
But you just slept with Bunz.

1048
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,976
Like I said:

1049
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:35,484
They're only good for one thing.

1050
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,312
Yes, you got it.

1051
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:42,153
I'll tell you another thing:
you gotta flip the script.

1052
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,819
Keep your frickey-dickey happening
on the DL.

1053
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:49,092
Be like, "Yeah, that's right.
But it's mine. It's mine."

1054
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,929
That's mine! Tear it up!
Give it to me!

1055
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,168
What's my name?

1056
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,932
We're in a hospital.

1057
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,438
Hospital. Chill.

1058
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,941
We're in a hospital.

1059
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,072
Tear it up.

1060
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,254
Contractions are 10 seconds apart.
Everything's great.

1061
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,846
And, you know, you looking...

1062
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,754
...you looking pretty good.

1063
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,253
What you in for, boy?

1064
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:29,165
You're lucky.
I got bad pipes.

1065
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,830
My balls is all congested.

1066
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,841
What are they gonna do?

1067
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,933
Un-congest them, I guess.

1068
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,771
It says here, "Testicular removal."

1069
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,714
"Un-congest," my ass.

1070
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:46,346
- They'll chop your balls off.
- What?

1071
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,980
Mr. Martin?

1072
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,649
Where are you?

1073
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,318
Mr. Martin...

1074
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,053
...where are you?

1075
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,758
We are ready.

1076
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,833
"Rushon."

1077
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,204
What a pretty name.

1078
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,812
Martin, here you are.

1079
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,317
<i>Adios, cojónes.</i>

1080
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,486
Great evening.
Got any more planned?

1081
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,822
- Don't even start.
- You don't want me to start, darling?

1082
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,988
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What does it mean?

1083
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,656
We're in a hospital...

1084
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,200
You don't recognize me
because I'm Dr. Zevroloski!

1085
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,668
I'm visiting from Baltimore
to do research!

1086
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:35,795
Hold it!

1087
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:40,104
Someone stole my I D.
Zevroloski. Look it up!

1088
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,404
I knew it.

1089
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,002
You come with me.

1090
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,810
We got somebody to find.

1091
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,819
They're in here somewhere.

1092
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,415
This is a mistake.

1093
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,886
Man, I swear to God.

1094
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,091
- We should just leave.
- No, we find him and then leave him.

1095
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,735
What is wrong with you?

1096
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,438
Relax.

1097
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,113
This is a mistake.

1098
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:24,380
Everyone gets nervous
about this procedure.

1099
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,114
It's easy.

1100
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:29,555
We shave you, snip you,
and it's over.

1101
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,219
There is life after castration.

1102
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,003
The plumbing works.

1103
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,840
- Get over here.
- What are you doing?

1104
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,886
Look, I gotta go.

1105
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,454
- Where's Rushon?
- I don't know.

1106
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,958
- You lost Rushon?
- I didn't lose him. I just...

1107
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,789
I don't have time for this.

1108
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:08,625
I'll go look for him.
You try to find him.

1109
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,256
Keep an eye on him.

1110
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,791
Mr. Martin, we've already
started anesthesia.

1111
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:17,464
You haven't eaten
in the last 12 hours?

1112
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,907
Relax and start counting
backwards from...

1113
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,342
Don't take my Johnson.

1114
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:24,640
Don't take...

1115
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:29,178
All right, people, he's out cold.
Let us tango.

1116
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,775
Is he in there?

1117
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,686
- Thought I looked like a mama.
- I like older women.

1118
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,189
I look old?

1119
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,124
No, I'm saying you
like a fine wine. Aged.

1120
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,222
Check in there.

1121
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,556
Chia Pet.

1122
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,237
It's mine. It's mine. Stop.

1123
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,114
All right, she's gone.
Let's go.

1124
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,785
Yeah, let's go.

1125
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,349
You ain't ready for this.

1126
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,948
No, you ain't ready for this.

1127
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,017
Here we go.

1128
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:15,689
Wait. Why hasn't
this man been prepped?

1129
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:19,292
Well, we all make mistakes.
I'll do it myself. Razor.

1130
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,974
Who's your daddy?
Come on, big girl.

1131
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,520
Bunz, wait.
Somebody's in here.

1132
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,415
That jack-o-lantern fool is
dead to the world.

1133
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,688
Girl, let's do this now.

1134
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:58,863
Come on.

1135
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:03,969
I hope you ate your corn flakes, baby,
'cause I'm gonna go all night long.

1136
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,638
'Cause I got stamina.

1137
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,847
Wait. You got a condom, right?

1138
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,614
No glove, no love.

1139
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,921
Look, I got a glove right here.

1140
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:19,688
May not be big enough to fit
on this old paloosa...

1141
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,923
...but we'll do the best we can.

1142
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,430
There we go.

1143
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,763
Are you ready?
Wait. Okay.

1144
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,359
Line it up.

1145
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,303
Don't go... too fast, now.

1146
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,686
Oh, shit.

1147
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:49,357
No, you didn't.

1148
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,087
I been holding that one a long time.

1149
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,288
That's just a flare, baby.

1150
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,128
Damn, my crippled ass...

1151
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,693
...could've done it longer than that.

1152
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,763
He's been watching us the whole time.

1153
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,604
The whole 3...

1154
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,200
...seconds.

1155
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,314
I hope I didn't wear you out, now.

1156
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:18,012
You need a cigarette
or something to bring you down?

1157
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,931
My God, what are you doing?!

1158
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,204
Removing a metastasized
testicular growth.

1159
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,245
- lf you'll excuse me...
- What?! Don't touch his growth!

1160
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,780
Get her out.

1161
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,873
There's been a mistake!
He has no insurance!

1162
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,481
Fuck!

1163
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:54,387
Get him down to County!
Goddamn stupid Admissions.

1164
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,219
I'll be on the golf course.

1165
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,089
Son-of-a-bitch!

1166
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:05,998
Hey, baby.

1167
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,433
Hi, Rushon.

1168
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,394
My leg... Shit!

1169
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,930
Everything's still there.
Almost.

1170
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,476
Almost?!

1171
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,876
Lay off the Magic Shave, brother man.

1172
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:22,646
My God, Nikki, no matter what you do,
don't tell Bunz.

1173
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:26,051
Worried about what Bunz
is gonna think.

1174
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,579
Lord forbid you get embarrassed
in front of Bunz.

1175
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,390
That's what I'm talking about, Rushon.

1176
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:37,398
Nikki, you mean everything to me,
but, come on, it's...

1177
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,661
...where a brother got
to draw the line.

1178
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,932
And there's a time
when a woman has got to draw the line.

1179
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:49,005
Rushon, sun's up.
You already lost the bet, what else?

1180
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,169
Hurry up.

1181
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,338
You know how to do that, Quick Draw.

1182
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:56,609
What's up?

1183
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,711
- That's what I been asking.
- Mind your business.

1184
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:03,155
Big Daddy-Haddy Not-No,
what's up, boy?

1185
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,785
Looking good.
They stitched you up?

1186
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:09,490
- Your boy here, don't sweat a thing.
- You took care of me.

1187
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:13,558
Now that your boy is here,
I'm sure you'll be fine.

1188
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,797
We're leaving.
Come on.

1189
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,169
Forget them tricks.
Let's roll.

1190
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,213
What can I do to prove
I don't give a fuck what Bunz thinks?!

1191
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,612
Sorry.

1192
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,150
What is this?
Kick A Brother In The Ding-Ding Day?

1193
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:32,381
The proof is in the doing,
not the saying.

1194
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,157
It's getting late.
We're going home.

1195
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,720
All right, fuck it!

1196
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:49,493
What you doing?!
I don't want to know you like this.

1197
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,473
You do look younger with your beard
all cut off and everything.

1198
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:58,671
"Not only am I a client,
I'm also the president."

1199
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,213
Looks like a shrimp, man.

1200
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,446
Is that the best you can do?
Come on.

1201
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,285
Looks like a doorstop.

1202
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:11,952
You'll tell everybody and embarrass
the hell out of me, right?

1203
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,460
I got to.

1204
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,965
If I pull that,
would you get stronger?

1205
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,626
You got a little ass so tight...

1206
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,899
...you could squeeze a piece of coal
and shit a diamond.

1207
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,030
Look at you, boy.

1208
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:31,635
- Did you see what was going on?
- You need to stop joning, Speedy.

1209
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,648
We need to really keep that
on the down low.

1210
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,686
I been going through some counseling.
I want to talk to you about it.

1211
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:41,348
You didn't give me a chance to reach
my climacticness...

1212
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,948
- You just got excited, right?
- Yeah.

1213
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,358
Step over to this side of the line.

1214
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,396
And what's over there for me?

1215
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,228
I love you, over here.

1216
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:02,276
Look what they're doing.

1217
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,806
Ready to go with me?

1218
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,213
Wanna go home?

1219
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,220
You with me?

1220
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:13,948
You sure?
Watch it, now.

1221
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,022
- Can't touch the pork chop.
- Can't touch?

1222
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,958
Can't touch it.
It'll bite you.

1223
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:25,459
That normally doesn't happen to me
but I had an accident.

1224
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:29,630
A cat jumped in my lap and scratched
the left side of my shit.

1225
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:33,197
So on the left side, I'm not functional.
I gotta hit it to the right.

1226
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,140
You could learn a lot from him.

1227
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,677
I have sports cream.

1228
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:40,010
I put it on and I'm ready to go,
you know?

1229
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:47,635
I'm glad you made me wait 7 weeks.

1230
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,283
I'm glad you made me wait 7 weeks.

1231
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:56,594
Did they use a razor or one
of those hair removal creams on you?

1232
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,292
Razor.

1233
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,294
You sure you know what you're doing?

1234
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,964
Oh, yeah!

1235
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,202
Where is Killa?

1236
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,902
He's around somewhere.

1237
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,980
See? He's not bothering us.

1238
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,243
I knew you two would hit it off
and bond together.

1239
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:18,252
Me and Killa have come
to an understanding.

1240
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,023
I read this is supposed to be bad
for your kidneys.

1241
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,252
Unless you're a professional...

1242
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:31,697
...you shouldn't go around like this.
Careful. Tendinitis.

1243
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,801
Let's get this party started.

1244
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:37,934
Be gentle.
