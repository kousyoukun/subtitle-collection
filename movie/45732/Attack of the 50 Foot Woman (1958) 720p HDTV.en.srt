1
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,001
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,502
This is KRKR-TV.

3
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,738
And now for
the latest news:

4
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:16,508
Early tonight, the captain
of a Swedish icebreaker
in the Barents sea

5
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,345
reported seeing
a strange red fireball
come out of the sky.

6
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:23,515
Says the captain,
"it hovered above my ship
for about a minute

7
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,152
and then headed south
by southwest." Unquote.

8
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,354
Radio Cairo
reports a herd of camels

9
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,356
stampeded by
a comet-like object

10
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,026
streaking southwest
across the Sahara.

11
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,029
And in Cape Town, Africa...
A Boer, no doubt...

12
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,031
Reports a similar flash
across the sky.

13
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,533
And still one more,
ladies and gentlemen:

14
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,035
A farmer
in Auckland, New Zealand,

15
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,037
reported
the strange-glowing object,

16
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,039
this time moving northeast.

17
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,141
Now, let's see...

18
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,078
Barents sea...

19
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,081
Cairo...

20
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,249
Auckland...

21
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,353
New Zealand...

22
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,491
Considering the timetable
of these reports,

23
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,992
the stranger from space

24
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,095
should be over
our California desert
in a matter of minutes.

25
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,990
Aah!

26
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,263
Aah!

27
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,677
Aah!

28
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,346
Aah!

29
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:03,983
No!

30
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,018
Aah!

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,853
Aah!

32
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,922
No!

33
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,490
Aah!

34
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,492
Somebody
help me!

35
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,494
Aah!

36
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,396
Somebody
help me!

37
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,397
Harry.

38
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:19,398
Mm-hmm?

39
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,433
Harry, what will
your wife say?

40
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,001
She'd say plenty.

41
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,002
Tonight anyhow.

42
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,004
Did you see the way
she tore out of here

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,506
in that
big car of hers?

44
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,509
She only caught us
nodding to each other.

45
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,010
She'll make up
for the all the things

46
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,345
she hasn't
caught us doing.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,513
I'm so fed up.

48
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,015
I never
should have agreed
to go back to her

49
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,517
once
we were separated.

50
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,018
Why did you?

51
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,520
You know why.

52
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,522
I couldn't pry
one nickel out of her.

53
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,025
That community property
routine only works
for women.

54
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,028
Man hasn't got a chance.

55
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:53,198
Unless the wife dies.

56
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,537
I didn't say anything.

57
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,472
You were
thinking it.

58
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,475
Not the same thing.

59
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,488
Didn't you say she was
in the nut house for a while?

60
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,479
Private sanitarium.

61
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,482
What's the difference?
She was off her rocker,
wasn't she?

62
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,517
I suppose so.

63
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,485
Well, they've got
some fancy name for it.

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,989
Mostly, she'd have
these violent headaches.

65
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,991
Then she'd get
falling down drunk.

66
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,327
Still has them
to this day.

67
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,795
What are you getting at?

68
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,497
Oh, come on, now, Harry.

69
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,999
Let's not be naive.

70
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:31,003
You've made a good start.
Now follow through.

71
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,005
She's on the brink,
and you know it.

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,506
I don't know it.

73
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,009
This Dr. Cushing
seems to be
helping her a lot.

74
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,521
She's tapering off
on the bottle, too.

75
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,013
Hardly took a drink
all evening.
You saw her.

76
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,015
All she needs
is a little help.

77
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,016
Yeah.

78
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,518
Play the husband,
right to the end.

79
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,520
Once she's in
the booby hatch,

80
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,023
throw the key away.

81
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,259
That'll put you
in the driver's seat.

82
00:04:56,563 --> 00:05:00,299
You'd make a wild driver,
Harry...

83
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,135
With 50 million bucks.

84
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,140
Harry!

85
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,476
Harry!

86
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,978
Harry, help me!

87
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:13,979
Mrs. Archer!

88
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,480
Mrs. Archer,
what's the matter?

89
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,316
Here you are.
Somebody give me a hand.

90
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,684
Take her
into the office.

91
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,818
Hey, chief!

92
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,487
Chief!

93
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:23,488
Mrs. Archer!

94
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,489
Harry.

95
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,991
Go on, folks. Go on.

96
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,494
Go on.
Nothing you can do
around here.

97
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,763
Go find Harry
while I take care
of Mrs. Archer.

98
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,165
All right,
let's break it up.

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, come on,
Mrs. Archer.

100
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,002
Come on and sit down
in the car.

101
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,504
I'll send somebody
for some black coffee.

102
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,006
Black coffee?!

103
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,342
You think I'm drunk,
don't you?

104
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,943
All of you!

105
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,011
I'm not drunk!
I'm not!

106
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,346
All right,
Mrs. Archer...

107
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,515
It was right in
the middle of the highway!
30 feet tall!

108
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,017
It lit up the sky!

109
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,185
I know that.

110
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,020
You don't believe me,
do you?

111
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,521
Any of you!

112
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,523
I'll believe you,
Mrs. Archer.

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,959
Just be calm.

114
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,462
Now come on and sit down
in the car.

115
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:07,399
Come on. Take it easy
and tell me all about it.
Slowly.

116
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,871
Hey, Mr. Archer?

117
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,872
Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,873
Mr. Archer?

119
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,776
What is it, Charlie?

120
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,480
Oh. All right.
I get the message.

121
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,749
She's over at
the sheriff's office...

122
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,751
Kind of bad shape.

123
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,985
Pretty hysterical.

124
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,487
Couldn't find me tonight,
Charlie.

125
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,988
I took a cab home.

126
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,657
Sure. Sure.
I get it, Mr. Archer.

127
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,493
Thanks a lot.

128
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,494
So...

129
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,497
So, she's tapering off,
eh?

130
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,999
Hardly took a drink
all evening.

131
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,869
Must have had a bottle
in the car. I don't know.

132
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,005
Did you find Mr. Archer?

133
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,507
He took a cab home,
chief.

134
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,509
Oh, Charlie...

135
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,843
Go get the riot gun.

136
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,312
We're taking
a ride in the desert
with Mrs. Archer.

137
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,547
Right.

138
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,518
Why the heavy artillery,
chief?

139
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,354
There's a flying satellite
and a 30-foot giant

140
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,189
a few miles out on 66.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,967
A 30-foot giant?!

142
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,036
Oh, no.

143
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,737
Hey, look!
There it is!

144
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,814
Uh, m-Mrs. Archer's car,
I mean, chief.

145
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,026
Where did you see it,
Mrs. Archer?

146
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,194
You can think
what you like.

147
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,697
It was right there
in the middle
of the road.

148
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:19,698
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,634
Come on, Charlie.
Let's look around.

150
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,708
Hey, what's up? She off
her rocker or something?

151
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,209
Don't look back,

152
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,389
but as long as she's
paying most of the taxes
around here,

153
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,846
we play along with her.

154
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,152
Uh...
Let's spread out here!

155
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,177
You see anything,
chief?

156
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,946
Ah. Come on.

157
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,686
Not a thing,
Mrs. Archer.

158
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,855
No prints
of any kind,
either.

159
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,189
Why would there be?

160
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,725
I told you,
everything happened
on the roadway.

161
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,963
I was standing right here.

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
It seemed to be reaching
for my diamond.

163
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,368
That's another thing

164
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,681
I've been wanting
to tell you,
Mrs. Archer.

165
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,171
That diamond
you're wearing...

166
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,206
Tempt the devil
himself.

167
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,208
There are
a lot of drifters
in the desert

168
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,712
who'd commit murder
for a well-cut
piece of glass.

169
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,214
In other words,
you're suggesting
that what I saw tonight

170
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,516
was some desert tramp.

171
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,017
Ah, you're saying that,
ma'am.

172
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:50,221
I'm only suggesting
that you be more careful
with that diamond.

173
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,656
I didn't run
all the way to town

174
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,592
just for a lecture,
sheriff.

175
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,229
We'll be glad
to escort you home,
Mrs. Archer.

176
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,230
No, thanks.

177
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,748
She's tearing out of here
like she was heading
for the moon!

178
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,250
Poor mixed-up
Mrs. Archer.

179
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,252
Feel kind of sorry
for her.

180
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,422
I feel a lot sorrier
for her husband
if she ever catches him

181
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,925
with that honey Parker
he's got stashed
at the hotel.

182
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,259
Ooh, what a doll!

183
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,260
Yeah.

184
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,762
Well,
come on, Charlie.

185
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,263
It's past midnight.

186
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,300
The town can't afford
to be paying us overtime.

187
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,701
Good evening,
Mrs. Archer.

188
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,252
Is there anything
I can do for you,
Mrs. Archer?

189
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,820
Yeah...

190
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,623
Beat it out of here.

191
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,763
Don't talk to Jess
like that.

192
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,365
Well, maybe
you should marry Jess

193
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,434
and hire me
for the Butler.

194
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,270
Hey...

195
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,337
I said out.

196
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,874
You can go, Jess.

197
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,910
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,783
And as far as I'm concerned,
you can go, too.

199
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,720
Go back to Tony's
and that woman
you were mooning about.

200
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,722
Oh, knock it off,
will you?

201
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,725
Now, you pulled
a boner tonight,
and you know it.

202
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,396
Why... leaving me
stranded at Tony's
without a ride.

203
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,398
I wasn't in the mood
for an argument

204
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,233
in front of
all those people.

205
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,735
And I didn't feel like
sitting there

206
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,914
and watching you
flirt all evening

207
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,739
with that red-headed wench
you call honey.

208
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,108
For heaven's sake,
Nancy.

209
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:26,311
Why, I hardly nodded
to the girl.

210
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,746
Now you listen to me,
Harry.

211
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:31,082
I won't stand
for any more
of your two-timing.

212
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,420
You keep away from that girl
and that hotel, you hear?

213
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,256
Your backdoor romance
has split us up
once already.

214
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,992
The next time,
there won't be
any reconciliation.

215
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,596
You're going
to flip your lid

216
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,664
just one time too many
with me, Nancy.

217
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,769
And you're going to make
one too many passes
at some other woman.

218
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,570
My husband.

219
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,738
Hah.

220
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,944
My<i> gigolo,</i>
that's what you are.

221
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,713
You're
a miserable parasite.

222
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,215
You're just after
my money.

223
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,718
I was
rid of you once.

224
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,220
Why did I
take you back?

225
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,221
Why?

226
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,723
Why?

227
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,762
Why did you, Nancy?

228
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:20,932
Why?

229
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,770
Because I love you,
Harry.

230
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:30,475
Why am I always
fighting with you
when I love you so?

231
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,579
Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,715
But if you'd
only show me once
that you really care,

233
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,884
I'd... I'd do anything.

234
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,822
What's wrong with us,
Harry?

235
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,026
I don't know.

236
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,761
Maybe it's me.

237
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,563
Maybe I...

238
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,268
Harry,
I've got to
tell you something,

239
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,770
only please don't
make fun of me.

240
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,506
First, listen to
the whole story.

241
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,780
Tonight while I was
driving home, I...

242
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,717
You're going to think
I'm crazy.

243
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,185
Oh, no...

244
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,987
Go on, Nancy.

245
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,626
Harry, I saw
a satellite tonight.

246
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,532
Is that all?

247
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,734
Everyone's
seeing satellites
these days.

248
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,236
Not like this.

249
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,738
It came
out of the sky

250
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:34,851
and landed
in the middle
of the highway.

251
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,609
Harry,
I almost hit it!

252
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:41,746
Then a man,
a giant of a man,
came out.

253
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,383
I could
feel his hands
at my throat.

254
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,386
I think he was
after my diamond.

255
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,387
Really?

256
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,590
I see you still have
the diamond.

257
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,592
I ran in the desert.

258
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,127
That's why
I'm such a mess.

259
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,763
I told the sheriff,
and he didn't
believe me.

260
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,198
I saw the look
on his face.

261
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,699
He thought
I was drinking.

262
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,202
Harry, you know
I wasn't drinking
tonight!

263
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:08,706
Oh, please, Harry.
You believe me,
don't you?

264
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,541
Of course I do,
sweetheart.

265
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,721
Now, you've had
a terrible night.

266
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,711
I think
you need some rest.

267
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,546
Now, it's late.
Come on.

268
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,615
I'm going
to put you to bed...

269
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,551
And we'll
go through this
tomorrow, hmm?

270
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,731
Why can't you be nice
like this all the time,
Harry?

271
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,734
There.

272
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,336
Oh, now, I...

273
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:42,740
I never meant to be
mean to you, Nancy,

274
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,042
any more than...

275
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:48,746
I wanted you to...
Stay in that sanitarium.

276
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,249
You know?

277
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,551
Well...

278
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,357
Things seem to worry you
lately.

279
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,792
You know, like before?

280
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,895
Hmm. I don't know...

281
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,165
Maybe it's my fault,
huh?

282
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,936
For not making things
easier for you.

283
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,709
Maybe it would be better
if we... separated again.

284
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:22,547
Now, I wouldn't want
to cause another breakdown
in your health.

285
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,215
Oh, Harry.

286
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,718
I couldn't
stand that.

287
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,219
I need you.

288
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,722
If you only knew
how much.

289
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,624
You're all I have,
Harry.

290
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,228
There you go.

291
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,231
That's why I've always
liked this place so.

292
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,233
We could be
so happy here,

293
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,236
just the two of us,
and no more arguments.

294
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,240
Here, Nancy.
This will make you sleep.

295
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,242
I don't
want to sleep.

296
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,578
I feel much better
with you here.

297
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,912
No more arguments.

298
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,186
Mmm. Water.

299
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,024
There you go.

300
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,525
That's the girl.

301
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,526
Mmm.

302
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,194
Mm-hmm.

303
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,696
Feel better, hmm?

304
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:12,864
Mm-hmm.

305
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,769
Don't leave me,
Harry.

306
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:32,884
Harry?

307
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,156
I need you...
All to myself.

308
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,626
Hi, Mr. Archer.

309
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:19,764
I was... I was just saying,
uh,<i> arrivederci.</i>

310
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,503
I thought you'd be
waiting for me
at your hotel.

311
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,605
You know I don't
like you hanging
around here alone.

312
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,541
You're not jealous
of that clown, are you?

313
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,977
It's too early
to go to bed.

314
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,614
Anyways, I'm sick
of that fleabag
you call a hotel.

315
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,382
I'm tired of waiting.

316
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,084
All I do is wait!

317
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,386
Wait, wait!

318
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,928
Maybe you won't have to wait
as long as you think.

319
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,630
She's cracking up again.

320
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,232
She's seeing satellites
and giants.

321
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,033
Not only
told me about it,

322
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,136
but she spread it
all over town tonight.

323
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,748
Even had the sheriff
out looking for the thing.

324
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,406
Charlie was
telling me about it.

325
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,841
This could be it.

326
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,510
When Dr. Cushing
hears about it,

327
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,445
he'll probably have her
committed right away.

328
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,614
He's in baker.
I'll call him tonight.

329
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,315
Well, that sounds
more like it.

330
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:15,920
I don't think
I could take much
more of this setup.

331
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,524
Well, any time you get
to thinking that way,

332
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,559
remember this.

333
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,628
The star of India.

334
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,664
It's the most famous
diamond in the world,

335
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,001
and you play your cards right,
and it'll all be yours.

336
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,636
Ah-ah.

337
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,337
Someday.

338
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,640
Let's call
Dr. Cushing.

339
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,551
What do you think,
Dr. Cushing?

340
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,019
She's not well, Harry.

341
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,288
She's suffering
from mental exhaustion,

342
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,157
and her drinking
doesn't help her any.

343
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,560
You did well
to send for me.

344
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,562
Oh, uh, Jess.

345
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:04,635
Now give Mrs. Archer
one of those
every 4 hours

346
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:05,636
and 2 at bedtime.

347
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,705
Keep her very quiet
and no alcohol.

348
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,442
There's not much
we can do for her until
she gets some rest.

349
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,843
Oh, you needn't
come out, Harry.

350
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,313
Jess will see me
to the car.

351
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,915
Doctor.

352
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,052
About last night...

353
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,421
Oh, that
satellite business?

354
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,523
Probably overworked
imagination.

355
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,492
You think she's having
a relapse.

356
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,294
Mentally?
Well, let's hope not.

357
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,996
I'm afraid
it would kill her

358
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,098
if she ever
had to go back
to that sanitarium.

359
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,100
She needs to be
near you, Harry.

360
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,470
She seems to get
a great deal of
consolation from you.

361
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,273
Now be patient
with her, my boy,

362
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,376
and with the right
understanding
on your part,

363
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,646
I have high hopes for
her eventual recovery.

364
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,484
Oh, I'll be in town
for a few days.

365
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,020
If you need me,
just call.

366
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,930
Well,

367
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,366
my faithful husband,
no less.

368
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,669
You finally decided
to come home.

369
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,040
What's the matter,
Harry?

370
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,342
Couldn't you stand
the suspense any longer?

371
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,944
Couldn't you wait
another minute

372
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,379
for the psychiatrist's
verdict?

373
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,215
What did he say, Harry?

374
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,218
Does he think
I'm crazy, too?

375
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:30,054
No one thinks
you're crazy, Nancy.

376
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,489
How nice.

377
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,659
Then you believe me?
You believe I saw
the satellite?

378
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,094
It's not the first time
someone has seen a satellite.

379
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,597
Right in the road,
with a giant in it?

380
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,300
Don't be so
condescending, Harry.

381
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,168
I know what
you're thinking.

382
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,871
I know why Dr. Cushing
was here, and I know
who called him.

383
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,272
All right, I called him.

384
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,740
He's here for your
own good, Nancy.

385
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,576
And I know where
you spent the night
last night.

386
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,812
You seem to have
a lot of information.

387
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,987
Well, I don't like
being tailed in my own home.

388
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:06,891
Here. Your giant friend
may come looking for this.

389
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:11,862
Harry, wait.
Where are you going?

390
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,364
Ask Jess.

391
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,553
Wouldn't you like
something to eat,
Mrs. Archer?

392
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,710
The doctor said...

393
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,945
Oh, Jess, quit mincing around
and leave me alone.

394
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,080
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,451
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is KRKR-TV.

396
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:36,587
And now more news
of high fliers.

397
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,290
Nancy Archer,
the former Nancy Fowler,

398
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,825
heiress to
the Fowler millions

399
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,227
and owner of the fabulous
star of India diamond,

400
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,596
has joined that
ever-expanding

401
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,633
international society
of satellite seers.

402
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:52,703
From the Archer's
palatial home away from home

403
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,705
comes a report
that Mrs. Archer

404
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,208
has not only been seeing
a sociable satellite,

405
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,943
but it's inhabited
as well.

406
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,412
A 30-foot giant.

407
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:05,850
Was he pink,
with big ears and tusks?

408
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,319
Well, maybe Mrs. Archer,

409
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:11,355
who has recently been
feuding with her husband
handsome Harry,

410
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,458
has finally found a man
from out of this world.

411
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,994
A man who could love her
for herself.

412
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,463
Come, come, now,
Mrs. Archer.

413
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,066
A man can ignore
one million dollars,

414
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:26,070
but 50? That's
too much to ask,

415
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,205
even from the man
in the moon.

416
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,179
What happened?

417
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,883
So I'm crazy.
I'm seeing things,
am I?

418
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,420
Jess, get the car.

419
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,622
I'm going out
into the desert
and find that thing,

420
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,057
and you're going
with me.

421
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,026
Well, don't just
stand there. Go on.

422
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,494
You're being
ridiculous, Nancy.

423
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,663
There's nothing out there.

424
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,265
You don't
believe me?

425
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,900
Well, you're wrong.

426
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,435
You're all wrong.

427
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,004
And you're drunk,
Nancy. Why don't you
try to sleep it off?

428
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,207
Not until I've proved it
to myself and to you.

429
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,810
We'll drive
on the side roads.

430
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,813
I have a strange feeling
it's out there somewhere,

431
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,548
waiting for me.

432
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,383
I'm certain of it.

433
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,884
And if it isn't?

434
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,724
Then I'm crazy
and should be committed.

435
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,961
The car's out
in front, ma'am.

436
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,767
Jess, get the revolver.

437
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,970
What's the gun for?

438
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,805
We're going hunting,
remember?

439
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,106
Let's go.

440
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,336
Nothing.

441
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,006
Just sand and space.

442
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,741
Well, seen enough?

443
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,242
Keep driving.

444
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:03,661
There!

445
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,096
Stop the car, Harry.
There it is!

446
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,165
I don't
see a thing.

447
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,834
I saw a flash
behind those hills.

448
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,004
All right, all right.
I'll turn around.

449
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,141
Hurry!

450
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:40,864
Well, now we've combed
all through these hills.

451
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,070
You saw it. There's
nothing out here.

452
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,404
Just emptiness.

453
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,878
Well, should we drive on
a little further?

454
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:58,048
I'm sorry, Harry.

455
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,017
I'm sorry.

456
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,831
That's it!

457
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,965
I did see it!

458
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,568
Oh, I told you!

459
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,737
I was right. I was right!

460
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,038
It's real. It's real!

461
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,172
Nancy!

462
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,041
Nancy,
come back here!

463
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,275
Come back here!

464
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,577
Let's get
out of here!

465
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:27,811
Nancy!

466
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,448
It's real!

467
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,716
It's real!

468
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,019
I'm not crazy!
I did see it!

469
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,153
It's a satellite!

470
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,521
Wait, come here!

471
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,623
Harry, touch it!
I did see it!

472
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,631
Aah!

473
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,832
Aah, Harry!

474
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,735
Harry! Harry!

475
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:55,506
Help me! Harry! Harry!

476
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,041
Aah!

477
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,810
Harry! Harry!

478
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,113
Harry, help me!

479
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,782
Aah!

480
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:05,983
Harry!

481
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,915
What have you done
with Mrs. Archer?

482
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,017
Get out of my way.

483
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,955
You're not
leaving this room,

484
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,057
and you tell me
what happened to her.

485
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,067
You aren't gonna
get away with it.

486
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,715
Give me the sheriff's office.

487
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,130
Get dressed
and pack, quick.

488
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,999
Huh, what's the matter?

489
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,035
No time for questions
and answers now.

490
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,470
Here. We're getting
out of here.

491
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:10,574
Oh, what did you do,
Rob the first national bank?

492
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,743
Shut up and get moving.
Come on.

493
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,646
Oh, all right. All right.

494
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,248
Nobody wants to get
out of this dump

495
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,450
worse than I do.

496
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,625
Hey.

497
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,962
Those are the only
clothes I've got.

498
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,502
You finished yet?

499
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:41,338
You just got here.

500
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,610
If you saw
what I saw,

501
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,946
you'd have jumped
out of your skin
to get moving.

502
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,514
Here, zip me.

503
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,084
Come on,
come on, come on.

504
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,419
All right, all right.

505
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:56,753
Where are we going?

506
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,322
Out of here,
but fast.

507
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,192
You going someplace?

508
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,962
Uh, miss Parker
is leaving town.

509
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,563
It's kind of sudden,
ain't it?

510
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,733
The night clerk here
didn't know anything
about it.

511
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,236
Well, well,
she... she does now.

512
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,670
No. I'm sorry,
Mr. Archer,

513
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:16,340
but sheriff Tuppett
wants to see you
in his office,

514
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,875
the both of you.

515
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,179
You're making
a mistake, Charlie.

516
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,580
Let's go.

517
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,897
Aw, let me see now.
You got 36s,

518
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,699
you got the queen of hearts,
that's a heart run,

519
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,569
so safest card
in the deck.

520
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,871
Hey, what do you want
that card for?

521
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,406
And that's a gin.

522
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,642
I don't want
to play anymore.

523
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,478
Ah, it's getting
daylight already.

524
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,782
Chief's always worrying
about the taxpayers' money.

525
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,853
Hello.

526
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,388
Oh, hi, Mary.

527
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,691
No darlin', I wasn't
dancing at Tony's club.

528
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,794
I was out picking up
a couple of guests
of the sheriff.

529
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,997
Yeah, he's out in the desert
now with a posse,
looking for the...

530
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,999
Oh, they did, huh?

531
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,368
On the pool house?

532
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,704
Hey, what do you know
about that?

533
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,972
Huh? Yeah.

534
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,840
They found Mrs. Archer.

535
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,843
Oh, I don't know
how she got there.

536
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:29,713
Hey, maybe
by a helicopter, huh?

537
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,148
Yeah, all right, Mary.

538
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,250
Look, will you take
any messages that come in?

539
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,118
Yeah, we're on our way
right now.

540
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,620
Yeah, bye, sweetie.

541
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,222
We'll take your wife's
imperial, right?

542
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,324
Yeah, right.

543
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,859
I imagine your wife
was home all the time

544
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,896
on top of the pool house,
loaded.

545
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,943
How serious is it,
Dr. Cushing?

546
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,244
Oh, it's too early
to tell,

547
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,624
but we should get her
to a hospital

548
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,125
as soon as she's strong
enough to be moved.

549
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,050
Those hours of exposure
on the roof didn't help any,

550
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,618
especially the way
she was dressed.

551
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,854
It's not the exposure
that worries me.

552
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,023
It's those scratches
on her throat.

553
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,591
That's
Mr. Archer now.

554
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,526
And honey.

555
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,662
I never would have
thought it.

556
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,732
Better let me
do the talking,
Dr. Cushing.

557
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,572
What's wrong with Nancy?

558
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,673
Doctor, what happened?

559
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,608
I'll ask the questions,
Mr. Archer.

560
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,478
Now suppose you
tell me what happened.

561
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,046
I'm in no mood
for games, sheriff.

562
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,849
I wouldn't
go up there if
I were you, Harry.

563
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,183
There's some
possibility

564
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,952
she may have been
contaminated.

565
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:45,722
There's evidence
of some kind
of radiation.

566
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,560
Of course,
we can't be sure.

567
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,934
Now you tell me what happened
out there, Mr. Archer.

568
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,036
Out where?

569
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,470
Jess told us.

570
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:04,374
You drove Mrs. Archer
out into the desert
last night with his gun.

571
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,610
You came back alone.

572
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:09,613
Now, uh, what happened
to Mrs. Archer,

573
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,049
and what happened
to the diamond
she was wearing?

574
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,316
He's lying.

575
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:14,996
I left the house alone,
right after you,
Dr. Cushing.

576
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,453
That's right.

577
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,622
Harry was with me
all evening.

578
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,557
We were just
stepping out for air

579
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,059
when your deputy
stopped us.

580
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,294
Dr. Cushing, it's time
for that injection
you ordered.

581
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,729
Thank you, nurse.
Thank you.

582
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:26,841
I wouldn't have
believed it, Harry.

583
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,332
I'm very
disappointed.

584
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,102
Well, there seems
to be a difference...

585
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,637
Careful with that,
nurse.

586
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,073
Exactly .75 cc.

587
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,908
One way or another.

588
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,177
When Mrs. Archer
regains consciousness,

589
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,845
she'll corroborate me,
sheriff Tuppett.

590
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,847
Well, where does
that leave us?

591
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,049
Nowhere.

592
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,418
Just don't try
to leave town for a while,

593
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,687
and that means you,
too, miss Parker.

594
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,056
We have
nothing to hide.

595
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,491
We'll be around.

596
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,761
Come on, honey.
I'll drive you
back into town.

597
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,963
According to Jess,

598
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:04,000
Mr. Archer drove his wife out
into the desert last night

599
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,535
and came home alone.

600
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,537
Well, there's one thing
you can be certain about.

601
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,072
Jess is absolutely
trustworthy.

602
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,041
He's been with Nancy
since she was a little girl.

603
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,976
I know he's
telling the truth.

604
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,288
What's the matter?

605
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:28,592
Our necks are way out
if Nancy comes to
and talks.

606
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,629
There is a way out,
if you've got the nerve.

607
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,064
Try me.

608
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,535
The serum that
private nurse is using
in her hypodermic needle...

609
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,404
I, um, I heard
the doctor tell her

610
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,307
that an overdose
would be fatal.

611
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:48,211
Money certainly
brings out the best
in you, doesn't it?

612
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,280
Have you got the nerve?

613
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:54,117
Read the morning papers.

614
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,655
Slide over
and drive to town.

615
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,790
I've got things to do.

616
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,241
Aah!

617
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,242
Doctor!

618
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,243
Dr. Cushing!

619
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,012
Something's happened
to Mrs. Archer!

620
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,546
Aah!

621
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,016
Aah!

622
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,419
Something's happened
to Mrs. Archer.

623
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,887
Astounding growth.

624
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,089
Aah!

625
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,392
Aah!

626
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,743
Meat hooks,

627
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,679
4 lengths of chain.

628
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:38,481
Oh, the chains
you were expecting
are here, doctor.

629
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,584
Good. I'll tell
Dr. Loeb at once.

630
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,919
Meat hooks,

631
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,021
4 lengths of chain,

632
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:48,058
40 gallons of plasma...

633
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,260
And an elephant syringe?

634
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,299
The chains are here.

635
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,634
Mm-hmm.

636
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,870
Well, Heinrich,
what do you make of it?

637
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,806
Fantastic.

638
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,841
I've made every test
in the book.

639
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,744
There's
no diagnosis.

640
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,813
Look at this slide.

641
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,050
Dermal
connective tissue.

642
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,151
Filaria?

643
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,287
If it only were
filaria,

644
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,788
we'd have something
to go on,

645
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,190
a beginning.

646
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,669
There's not even
streptococci
infection

647
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,061
to incite
inflammation of
the lymph channels.

648
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,863
What could it be?

649
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,331
I don't know.

650
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,600
I just don't know.

651
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,239
We may find our answer
when we operate.

652
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:39,409
Giantism can result
from an overactive
forward lobe

653
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,244
of the pituitary
process, you know.

654
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,614
Then you think
surgery is indicated?

655
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,183
Except for that
one thing.

656
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:52,489
The blue-green color
around the scratches
at her throat...

657
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:57,227
I would venture to say
it's some sort
of radiation

658
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:02,232
which we in medicine
have never touched upon.

659
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,435
Fortunately,
the dose she received
was not deadly.

660
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,537
Then you... you feel
there is hope.

661
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,840
With surgery, yes.

662
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:15,044
We'll have to have
the husband's permission
to operate, of course.

663
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,383
There's always hope
as long as there's
faith, Raymond.

664
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,660
I almost
gave you up, baby.

665
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,567
I've been reading
the papers.

666
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:41,604
I told you what happened
on the phone.

667
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,908
We've got problems again.

668
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,945
That new doctor, Van Loeb,
thinks he can help her.

669
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,248
Bring me a drink,
will you?

670
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,321
What's the matter?

671
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:02,292
Your conscience
bothering you, Harry?

672
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,793
You know,
the trouble with us

673
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,963
is we've both got
the same disease...

674
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,998
Money...

675
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,503
And happy ways
of spending it.

676
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,074
I missed you.

677
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:21,144
Has she talked yet?

678
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,712
She's still
in a coma.

679
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,113
They're looking
for me now

680
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,049
to give them
permission
to operate.

681
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,116
That's great.

682
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,585
That's wonderful.

683
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,589
You just hide out
and let her blow up
like a balloon.

684
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:38,127
You can pull now,
Heinrich.

685
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,765
Steady.

686
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,758
Give me a boost, Charlie.

687
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,231
Nothing.

688
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,933
Yeah, I can see that
from here,

689
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,801
uh, almost.

690
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,306
There's a ladder
over there.

691
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,783
Charlie.

692
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:35,051
Huh?

693
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,189
Wow.

694
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,891
What is it?

695
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,459
I don't know.

696
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:46,162
Whatever it is,
it wasn't made by
a Japanese gardener.

697
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:50,733
Go get Jess. Tell him
to get down here pronto.

698
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,538
Excuse me.

699
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,140
Jess.

700
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:00,310
Sheriff Tuppett
wants to see you...

701
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:01,844
Right away.

702
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,488
I thought you two
might like a cool...

703
00:43:12,524 --> 00:43:15,758
Did you
ever see anything like this
around here before, Jess?

704
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:18,194
A giant footprint.

705
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,231
Maybe Mrs. Archer
wasn't so...

706
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,801
I've been thinking
the same thing myself.

707
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:28,638
Hey, look. There's
another one over there.

708
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,076
Hey, look,
there's another one.

709
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,244
Charlie!

710
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,680
We've got to keep quiet
about this thing.

711
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:40,283
Everybody'll think
we're nuts.

712
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,452
Be dark in a half hour.

713
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:44,231
We'll follow
these things,
see where they lead.

714
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,255
We will?

715
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,723
Mrs. Archer has
a station wagon.

716
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,759
Good. Run my car into town
and get the riot gun, Charlie.

717
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,695
Bring a couple of grenades
and some tear gas
and flashlights, too.

718
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,197
Tear gas?
Grenades?

719
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,165
We'll leave as soon
as you get back.

720
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,635
You'd better plan on being up
all night tonight, Charlie.

721
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,014
We gotta have somebody
in the office

722
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:01,671
in case Jess and I
want to get in touch.

723
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:06,009
Oh, sure. You know,
I'd like to go
with you, chief.

724
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:09,078
There'll be no charge
for overtime.

725
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:16,285
Come on, Jess.
There's still
some daylight left.

726
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,521
Let's follow
these things.

727
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,256
Excuse me, chief.

728
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,262
Back it up.

729
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,970
Amazing.

730
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,307
Here.

731
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:47,009
We'd better walk
the rest of the way.

732
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,678
There's a radio phone
in the car.

733
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,113
Shouldn't we
call for help?

734
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:55,351
No use yelling
for outside interference
till we see what we got.

735
00:45:57,522 --> 00:46:01,491
Harry must have
brought her out here
and left her,

736
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:05,228
and then this...
This giant must have
taken her home

737
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,263
and put her
on the pool house roof.

738
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,432
Amazing.

739
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:10,700
Look.

740
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:15,938
My gun.

741
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:20,376
He emptied it
before he ran.

742
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,578
At what?

743
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,612
Over here.

744
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:28,004
Look.

745
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,076
The star of India.

746
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:36,612
Mrs. Archer
was right.

747
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:39,248
The thing was
after her diamond.

748
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:41,617
Diamonds everywhere,
different colors.

749
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:44,153
Must be used to power
this thing in some way.

750
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:48,157
Let's take this one
and get out of here.

751
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:04,960
Charlie. Charlie.

752
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:06,829
The radio's shot, too.

753
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,398
Might as well
start walking.

754
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:17,606
We'll come back for
all this stuff later.

755
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:20,643
It's gonna be
a long walk.

756
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:33,355
I've known Nancy
since she was born.

757
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:35,891
In those days, she was
a beautiful child...

758
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:39,628
Fresh, young,
full of the joys of life,

759
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:41,697
but in the last few years,

760
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:46,368
after her marriage,
she changed.

761
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:50,573
Her health
seemed to rise and fall
with the tide of her emotion.

762
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,308
Very sad case.

763
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:57,847
A case not infrequent
in this supersonic age
we live in.

764
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:02,685
I'm afraid I was unwise
in advising her

765
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,421
to take Harry back
after they'd separated.

766
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:09,458
Who knows, my friend?

767
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:11,961
When women reach
the age of maturity,

768
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:15,531
mother nature
sometimes overworks
their frustration

769
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:18,267
to a point
of irrationalism,

770
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,538
like the middle-aged man
of our age

771
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:26,275
who finds himself
looking longingly

772
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,812
at a girl
in her early 20s.

773
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,215
Harry!

774
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,650
What was that?

775
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,119
Harry!

776
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:39,989
Harry!

777
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:43,092
I-I'll get Dr. Cushing.

778
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,861
Harry, I want out of here.

779
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:48,864
Nancy, Nancy,
calm yourself.
Morphine.

780
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,400
Harry's asleep in his room.
He'll be right here.

781
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:52,935
Harry!

782
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,137
Call the sheriff!

783
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,375
Harry.

784
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,177
Harry!

785
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,714
Sheriff's office,
please.

786
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,683
And hurry, operator.
It's urgent.

787
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:08,817
Harry.

788
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,886
Hello? Sheriff Tuppett.

789
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:12,555
Have you found
Mr. Archer yet?

790
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,925
No, ma'am,
but I left messages
everywhere in town.

791
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,961
Oh, she did, huh?
She is?

792
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:22,031
Yes, ma'am. I know
it's an emergency.

793
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:24,066
All right,
I will right away.

794
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,440
Hi, Mary. Look,
I'm going over
to Tony's club,

795
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,853
and then I'm heading out
to the archers'.

796
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,276
If sheriff Tuppett
calls in,

797
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:35,889
tell him he better
get out there, too,
will ya?

798
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:37,880
Ok. Thank you, baby.
Bye.

799
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:07,810
Oh, no.

800
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:09,778
There's no cutting here
in Tony's club, buddy.

801
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:10,846
Uh, Mr. Archer...

802
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,715
Hey, it's the deputy.

803
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,883
What can we do for you
this time, Charlie?

804
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,830
Your house has been
trying to get you
all evening, sir.

805
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,432
Didn't the bartender
give you my message?

806
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:21,590
He did. And now you've
delivered it in person.

807
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,325
Anything else?

808
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:25,761
No. Well,
yes, there is.

809
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,197
They say it's important.
An emergency.

810
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,934
Well, thanks.

811
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,470
All right.

812
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:39,241
Listen,
where were we, huh?

813
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,476
Here.

814
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,444
Oh, yeah.

815
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,614
Never should've tried
to keep this out
of the papers.

816
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,183
The poor girl...
She's had so much
publicity all her life.

817
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:50,019
I'm afraid now
there's no alternative.

818
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,820
We'll have to notify
the authorities.

819
00:54:51,856 --> 00:54:54,423
If you hadn't succeeded
in giving her that sedative,

820
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,458
there's no telling
what would've happened.

821
00:54:56,494 --> 00:55:00,062
Well, thank heaven
we got the chains
on her arms and legs.

822
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:02,331
How long will the morphine
be effective?

823
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,300
No telling with
the size of her body,

824
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,035
but we'll
have to keep her
under sedation

825
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,369
till the state police
arrive.

826
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:10,472
I-I'll phone
the authorities
at baker.

827
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:13,743
Operator.

828
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:15,110
Aah!

829
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:18,714
Doctor!
Dr. Cushing, it's her.
She's come to again.

830
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:21,650
Dr. Cushing!
Pull yourself together.
More morphine.

831
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:24,653
Operator. Operator.

832
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:27,356
Operator. This is
Mary your operator.

833
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:29,892
What's going on there?
What's happening?

834
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,660
Hurry with that morphine.

835
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,297
Aah!

836
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,166
She's loose!

837
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:40,202
She'll tear the roof off.

838
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,106
That's it. I'm getting
out of here.

839
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,519
Operator. Operator.

840
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:59,054
Damn.

841
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:07,296
I know where
my husband is.

842
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:09,631
He's with that woman!

843
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:13,969
Aah!
I'll find him.

844
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,704
She's going.

845
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:23,412
A tank couldn't have done
a better job.

846
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:25,414
See? She's heading for town.

847
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:41,463
Hi, chief. I was
just on my way over
to the archers'.

848
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:43,265
I think miss Archer
finally came to.

849
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,235
Uh, say,
they been asking
for you over there.

850
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,504
Did you
find anything
out there?

851
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:49,905
Get moving, will you?

852
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,040
Yeah, sure, sure.
Hop in.

853
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,777
Where's
the station wagon,
chief?

854
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:16,465
Doctor!

855
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,801
Doctor, give us a hand
with the door!

856
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:20,803
Here's the sheriff's car!

857
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,377
Holy Toledo!

858
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:29,378
What happened?

859
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:30,490
Thank heaven you're here,
sheriff.

860
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:32,481
It's Mrs. Archer.
She's on a rampage.

861
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:33,649
We've got to warn
the town!

862
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:34,817
She's grown into
a giant!

863
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:35,984
Never mind.
Get in the car.

864
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,820
We'll explain
as we go along.

865
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:39,254
Drive to town!

866
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,997
Uranium. Ehh!

867
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:51,667
These are just made
to eke forth

868
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:55,370
a lot of junk
to sell to the people.

869
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:56,839
It ain't like the old days

870
00:57:56,874 --> 00:57:59,308
when we could go out
prospecting for gold

871
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:01,577
with a sluice box and water.

872
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,284
I can see it now.

873
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,461
Come on, Harry!

874
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:21,597
Come on!

875
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,880
Hey, hey, hey. Tony,
something's happened
to your lights.

876
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:40,382
I got eyes.
I can see.

877
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,884
Who needs lights?

878
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,485
Well, I need
another drink.

879
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,988
Hey, Tone. Tony...

880
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,991
Ah, you're a good
for nothing, Tony.

881
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:49,992
Attaboy, Tone.

882
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,494
He's a mellow fellow.

883
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,530
Happy birthday, honey.

884
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,701
Well, wouldn't you
know it?

885
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,272
Ha ha!

886
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:11,313
Can't you drive
any faster?

887
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:16,778
What happened?

888
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:19,514
Was it a giant woman?

889
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,682
Going toward town?

890
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:21,783
Let's hurry!

891
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:50,612
Harry!

892
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:12,501
She'll tear up
the whole town
till she finds Harry.

893
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:16,004
Yeah. And then
she'll tear up Harry.

894
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:33,021
See if you can locate him
and put him in
the police car.

895
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:35,023
We'll try and draw her off.

896
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,792
I'll call baker for help.

897
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,065
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

898
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:52,841
Let's get the sheriff.

899
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:59,047
Hey,
what's going on here?!

900
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,482
Harry!

901
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:03,485
Sounds like someone's
calling your name.

902
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,986
Harry!

903
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:06,488
Harry!

904
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:07,989
It's your wife!

905
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,502
She's wrecking the town
looking for you!

906
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:11,159
I gotta get you
out of here!

907
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,527
No! No!

908
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,996
If she sees me out there,
she'll kill me! She's crazy!

909
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,533
Come on, Mr. Archer.
We gotta get out
of here!

910
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:23,171
You're a deputy.
Do something!

911
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,507
Yeah. Yeah.

912
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,008
I can't shoot
a lady!

913
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,009
Give me the gun.

914
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,845
Give me that gun!

915
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:39,988
Aah!

916
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,556
Aah!

917
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:46,828
No! No! No,
Mrs. Archer!

918
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:48,865
No! No!

919
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:06,515
Help me with this beam,
Charlie!

920
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:10,418
She's dead!

921
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,422
No... no. Nancy,

922
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,957
Nancy!

923
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:17,926
No!

924
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,895
Nancy!

925
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:20,996
Nancy...

926
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,330
Nancy, no!

927
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:23,331
Nancy!

928
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,332
No!

929
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:25,333
Nancy, don't!

930
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:26,501
Oh, no!

931
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:28,470
Don't! Nancy!

932
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,572
You killed honey.

933
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,073
Nancy, no!
Put me down!

934
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:33,942
Honey...

935
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:34,943
Nancy...

936
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,444
No! Nancy, no!

937
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,946
No!

938
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,448
I can't breathe!

939
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,321
She's got Harry!

940
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,567
She's got Harry!

941
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,158
Why doesn't the sheriff
do something?!

942
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:54,429
Put him down,
Mrs. Archer!

943
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,440
This thing's no good!

944
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:14,816
Sheriff, you...

945
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,418
You're not going
to use that on her?!

946
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:20,422
What do you want me to do...
Put salt on her tail?!

947
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:41,943
She's down!

948
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,679
Well, let's take a look.

949
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:45,715
Come on.

950
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,565
All right. Everybody
keep back now.

951
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,333
Come on.
Stand back there.

952
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:06,601
I still
can't believe it.

953
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:21,950
She finally got Harry
all to herself.
