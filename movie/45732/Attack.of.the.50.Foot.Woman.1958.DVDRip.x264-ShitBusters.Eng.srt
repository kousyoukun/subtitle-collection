1
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,172
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:13,546
This is KRKR-TV.
And now for the latest news.

3
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,416
Early tonight the captain of
a Swedish icebreaker in the Barents Sea...

4
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:21,081
...reported seeing a strange red fireball
come out of the sky.

5
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:22,521
Says the captain:

6
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:24,821
"It hovered above my ship
for about a minute...

7
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:27,966
...and then headed south by southwest. "
Unquote.

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,496
Radio Cairo reports a herd of camels
stampeded by a comet-like object...

9
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,832
...streaking southwest
across the Sahara.

10
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:37,737
And in Cape Town, Africa,
a Boer, no doubt...

11
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,070
...reports a similar flash across the sky.

12
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:42,179
And still one more,
ladies and gentlemen.

13
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:46,078
A farmer in Auckland, New Zealand
reported the strange glowing object...

14
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,310
...this time moving northeast.

15
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:50,284
Now, let's see.

16
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,885
Barents Sea.

17
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,755
Cairo.

18
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:58,691
Auckland.

19
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,662
Considering the time table
of these reports...

20
00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:10,968
...the stranger from space should be over
our California desert in a matter of minutes.

21
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:07,954
No, no!

22
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,164
Harry! Harry help me!

23
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,172
Harry, help me!

24
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:19,935
Harry...

25
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:22,410
Harry, what will your wife say?

26
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:25,448
She'll say plenty, tonight anyhow.

27
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:28,586
Did you see the way she tore out of here
in that big car of hers?

28
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,154
She only caught us
nodding to each other.

29
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:34,588
She'll make up for all the things
she hasn't caught us doing.

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,421
I'm so fed up.

31
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:39,860
I never should have agreed
to go back to her once we were separated.

32
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,625
- Why did you?
- You know why.

33
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,564
I couldn't pry one nickel out of her.

34
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:48,399
That community-property routine
only works for women.

35
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:51,133
A man hasn't got a chance.

36
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:54,539
Unless the wife dies.

37
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:59,345
I didn't say anything.

38
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,486
You were thinking it.

39
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:03,883
Not the same thing.

40
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:06,822
Didn't you say she was
in the nut house for a while?

41
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:08,653
A private sanitarium.

42
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:11,489
What's the difference?
She was off her rocker, wasn't she?

43
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:14,826
I suppose so.
Probably got some fancy name for it.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,798
Mostly she'd have
these violent headaches.

45
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,369
And then she'd get falling-down drunk.

46
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,871
Still has them to this day.

47
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,669
What are you getting at?

48
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:28,711
Oh, come on, now, Harry.
Let's not be naive.

49
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,872
You've made a good start,
now follow through.

50
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,383
- She's on the brink and you know it.
- I don't know it.

51
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,954
This Dr. Cushing seems to be
helping her a lot.

52
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,852
She's tapering off on the bottle too.

53
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:42,118
Hardly took a drink all evening,
you saw her.

54
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:44,728
All she needs is a little help.

55
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,530
Play the husband right to the end.

56
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,726
Once she's in the booby hatch,
throw the key away.

57
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:55,306
That will put you in the driver's seat.

58
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:01,044
You'd make a wild driver, Harry.

59
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,813
With 50 million bucks.

60
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:09,886
Harry!

61
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,452
Harry!

62
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,182
Harry, help me!

63
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,350
Mrs. Archer. Mrs. Archer,
what's the matter?

64
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:19,497
Here, somebody give me a hand.
We'll take her into the office.

65
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:21,495
Hey, chief!

66
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,631
Chief.

67
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,599
- Mrs. Archer.
- Harry.

68
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,067
Go on, folks, go on.

69
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:30,333
Go on, nothing you can do around here.

70
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,703
Go find Harry
while I take care of Mrs. Archer.

71
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:35,676
- All right, let's break it up.
- Now, come on, Mrs. Archer.

72
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:38,145
Come on and sit down in the car.

73
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,511
I'll send somebody
for some black coffee.

74
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:44,143
Black coffee?
You think I'm drunk, don't you?

75
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:47,052
- All of you! I'm not drunk, I'm not!
- Now, Mrs. Archer.

76
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,817
- You've got to believe me.
- Please...

77
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,690
It was right in the middle of the highway,
30 feet tall.

78
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,831
- It lit up the sky.
- I know that.

79
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:57,457
You don't believe me, do you?
Any of you.

80
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:59,570
I'll believe you, Mrs. Archer.

81
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,968
I'll believe you, just be calm.

82
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,631
Now, come on and sit down in the car.

83
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:08,267
Come on, take it easy
and tell me all about it, slowly.

84
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:14,710
Hey, Mr. Archer.

85
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,051
Mr. Archer.

86
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,122
What is it, Charlie?

87
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,852
Oh, all right, I get the message.

88
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:26,156
She's over at the sheriff's office.
She's in kind of bad shape.

89
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,798
She's pretty hysterical.

90
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:31,561
You couldn't find me tonight, Charlie.
I took a cab home.

91
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:33,670
Sure, sure, I get it, Mr. Archer.

92
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,567
Thanks a lot.

93
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:40,041
So... So she's tapering off, eh?

94
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,236
Hardly took a drink all evening.

95
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:44,746
Must have been a bottle in the car,
I don't know.

96
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:49,352
- Did you find Mr. Archer?
- He took a cab home, chief.

97
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:52,547
Charlie, go get the riot gun.

98
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:55,056
We're taking a ride in the desert
with Mrs. Archer.

99
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,488
Right.

100
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:00,393
Why the heavy artillery, chief?

101
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:01,896
There's a flying satellite...

102
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:05,969
...and a 30-foot giant
a few miles out on 66.

103
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:16,941
A 30-foot giant?

104
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,843
Oh, no.

105
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,643
Hey, look. There it is.

106
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,058
Mrs. Archer's car, I mean, chief.

107
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:15,829
Where did you see it, Mrs. Archer?

108
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,304
You can think what you like.

109
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,602
It was right there
in the middle of the road.

110
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:23,680
Yes, ma'am.
Come on, Charlie, let's look around.

111
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:30,480
What's up?
She off her rocker or something?

112
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:34,352
Don't look back, but as long as she's
paying most of the taxes around here...

113
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,653
...we play along with her.

114
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,592
Let's spread out here.

115
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,589
You see anything, chief?

116
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,420
Come on.

117
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:17,699
Not a thing, Mrs. Archer.
No prints of any kind either.

118
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:21,999
Why would there be? I told you
everything happened on the roadway.

119
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,540
I was standing right here.

120
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:29,671
It seemed to be reaching
for my diamond.

121
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:32,908
That's another thing
I've been wanting to tell you, Mrs. Archer.

122
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:36,417
That diamond you're wearing
would tempt the devil himself.

123
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,613
There are a lot of drifters in the desert...

124
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,725
...who'd commit murder
for a well-cut piece of glass.

125
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:45,518
In other words, you're suggesting
what I saw tonight was some desert tramp.

126
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,289
You're saying that, ma'am.

127
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:50,992
I'm only suggesting that you be
more careful with that diamond.

128
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:54,900
I didn't run all the way to town
just for a lecture, sheriff.

129
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,075
We'll be glad to escort you home,
Mrs. Archer.

130
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:01,075
No, thanks.

131
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,690
Boy, she's tearing out of here
like she was heading for the moon.

132
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:21,923
Poor, mixed-up Mrs. Archer.
I feel kind of sorry for her.

133
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,295
Well, I feel a lot sorrier
for her husband...

134
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:27,927
...if she catches him with that
Honey Parker he's got stashed at the hotel.

135
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,870
- What a doll.
- Yeah.

136
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,636
Well, come on, Charlie.
It's past midnight.

137
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,780
Town can't afford
to be paying us overtime.

138
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,171
Good evening, Mrs. Archer.

139
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:28,193
Is there anything I can do for you,
Mrs. Archer?

140
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:29,594
Yeah.

141
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,694
Beat it out of here.

142
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,836
Don't talk to Jess like that.

143
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:43,447
Maybe you should marry Jess
and hire me for the butler.

144
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:48,149
Hey. I said out.

145
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,618
You can go, Jess.

146
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,347
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,592
And as far as I'm concerned,
you can go too.

148
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:03,063
Go back to Tony's
and that woman you were mooning about.

149
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,961
Knock it off, will you?

150
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:07,570
Now, you pulled a boner tonight,
and you know it.

151
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:12,642
Why, leaving me stranded at Tony's
without a ride.

152
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,211
I wasn't in the mood for an argument
in front of all those people.

153
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:19,043
I didn't feel like sitting there
and watching you flirt...

154
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,276
...with that red-headed wench
you call Honey.

155
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,943
For heaven's sake, Nancy.

156
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,116
Why, I hardly nodded to the girl.

157
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:28,919
Now, you listen to me, Harry.

158
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,994
I won't stand for any more
of your two-timing.

159
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:36,458
You keep away from that girl
in that hotel, you hear?

160
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:39,034
Your backdoor romancing
split us up once already.

161
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:42,366
The next time
there won't be any reconciliation.

162
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:47,466
You know, you're gonna flip your lid
just one time too many with me, Nancy.

163
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:51,137
And you're gonna make
one too many passes at some other woman.

164
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,307
My husband.

165
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,924
My gigolo, that's what you are.

166
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:05,256
You're a miserable parasite.
You're just after my money.

167
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,821
I was rid of you once.

168
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,990
Why did I take you back?

169
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,796
Why, why?

170
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:18,999
Why did you, Nancy?

171
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:22,604
Why?

172
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:27,447
Because I love you, Harry.

173
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:31,618
Why am I always fighting with you
when I love you so?

174
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:35,491
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,423
But if you'd only show me once
that you really cared...

176
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:41,792
...I'd do anything.

177
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,127
What's wrong with us, Harry?

178
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,898
I don't know.

179
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,067
Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm...

180
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:57,910
Harry, I've got to tell you something.

181
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:00,243
Only please don't make fun of me.

182
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:02,852
First, listen to the whole story.

183
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:10,250
Tonight while I was driving home...

184
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:14,064
You're going to think I'm crazy.

185
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:17,595
No, no. Go on, Nancy.

186
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:22,301
Harry, I saw a satellite tonight.

187
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:28,373
Oh, is that all?

188
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,878
You know,
everyone's seeing satellites these days.

189
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:32,538
Not like this.

190
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:35,618
It came out of the sky
and landed in the middle of the highway.

191
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:38,587
Harry, I almost hit it.

192
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:42,388
And a man,
a giant of a man came out of it.

193
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,763
I could feel his hands at my throat.

194
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:49,195
I think he was after my diamond.

195
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:53,197
Well, I see you still have the diamond.

196
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:56,863
I ran in the desert,
that's why I'm such a mess.

197
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:00,944
I told the sheriff and he didn't believe me.
I saw the look on his face.

198
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:04,980
He thought I was drinking.
Harry, you know I wasn't drinking tonight.

199
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:08,551
Oh, please, Harry.
You believe me, don't you?

200
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:13,080
Of course I do, sweetheart.
Now, you've had a terrible night.

201
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,554
I think you need some rest.

202
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:17,023
Now, it's late. Come on.

203
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:21,256
I'm gonna put you to bed
and we'll go through this tomorrow.

204
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:35,544
Why can't you be nice like this
all the time, Harry?

205
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,880
There.

206
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,919
Oh, now, I never meant
to be mean to you, Nancy.

207
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:50,090
Any more than I wanted you to stay
in that sanitarium...

208
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,219
...you know?

209
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,422
Well...

210
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,961
...things seem to worry you lately.

211
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:02,435
You know, like before.

212
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,232
I don't know.

213
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,642
Maybe it's my fault, huh?

214
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:13,577
For not making things easier for you.

215
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:19,211
Maybe it would be better
if we separated again.

216
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,326
Now, I wouldn't want to cause
another breakdown in your health.

217
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:27,191
Oh, Harry, I couldn't stand that.

218
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,798
I need you.

219
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,730
Oh, if you only knew how much.

220
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,568
You're all I have, Harry.

221
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:37,731
There you go.

222
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:41,167
That's why I've always liked this place.

223
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:43,242
We could be so happy here.

224
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:47,282
Just the two of us, no more arguments.

225
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:50,416
Here, Nancy. This will make you sleep.

226
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,078
I don't wanna sleep.

227
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:54,156
I feel much better with you here.

228
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,486
No more arguments.

229
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,626
Water.

230
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:06,870
There you go.

231
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:08,767
That's the girl.

232
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,698
Feel better?

233
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:19,112
Don't leave me, Harry.

234
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,728
Harry.

235
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:39,693
I need you, all to myself.

236
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:17,063
Hi, Mr. Archer. I was...

237
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:20,904
I was just saying <i>arrivederci</i>.

238
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:26,214
I thought you'd be waiting for me
at your hotel.

239
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,784
You know I don't like you
hanging around here alone.

240
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:31,717
You're not jealous of that clown,
are you?

241
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:33,982
It's too early to go to bed.

242
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:37,491
Anyways, I'm sick of that fleabag
you call a hotel.

243
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,459
And I'm tired of waiting.

244
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,361
All I do is wait, wait, wait.

245
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:51,365
Maybe you won't have to wait
as long as you think.

246
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:55,345
She's cracking up again.
She's seeing satellites and giants.

247
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:58,880
Not only told me about it,
but she spread it all over town tonight.

248
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,384
- Even had the sheriff out looking for it.
- Charlie was telling me about it.

249
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:04,849
This could be it.

250
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:08,389
When Dr. Cushing hears about it,
he'll have her committed right away.

251
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,288
He's in Baker. I'll call him tonight.

252
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:12,486
Well, that sounds more like it.

253
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:15,962
I don't think I could take
much more of this setup.

254
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,935
Well, anytime
you get to thinking that way...

255
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:22,505
...remember this.

256
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,204
The Star of India.

257
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,640
It's the most famous diamond
in the world.

258
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:30,975
And you play your cards right
and it'll all be yours.

259
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:34,444
Someday.

260
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,146
Let's call Dr. Cushing.

261
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,930
- What do you think, Dr. Cushing?
- She's not well, Harry.

262
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,193
She's suffering from mental exhaustion.

263
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:54,098
And her drinking doesn't help her any.

264
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:56,865
You did well to send for me.

265
00:19:57,975 --> 00:19:59,374
Jess.

266
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:02,778
Now, give Mrs. Archer...

267
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:06,178
...one of those every four hours,
and two at bedtime.

268
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,614
Keep her very quiet and no alcohol.

269
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:12,313
There's not much we can do for her
until she gets some rest.

270
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,290
You needn't come out, Harry.
Jess will see me to the car.

271
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:19,185
Doctor.

272
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,258
About last night...

273
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,632
Oh, that satellite business?

274
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:27,464
Probably overworked imagination.

275
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:30,232
- You think she's having a relapse?
- Mentally?

276
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:31,635
Well, let's hope not.

277
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:35,074
I'm afraid it'd kill her if she ever
had to go back to that sanitarium.

278
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:37,077
She needs to be near you, Harry.

279
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:40,581
She seems to get a great deal
of consolation from you.

280
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:43,185
Now, be patient with her, my boy.

281
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:46,323
And with the right understanding
on your part...

282
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,324
...I have high hopes
for her eventual recovery.

283
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:54,188
Oh, I'll be in town for a few days.

284
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:56,697
If you need me, just call.

285
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:09,303
Well, my faithful husband, no less.

286
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:13,215
You finally decided to come home.

287
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:16,847
What's the matter, Harry?

288
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,046
Couldn't you stand
the suspense any longer?

289
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:22,317
Couldn't you wait another minute
for the psychiatrist's verdict?

290
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,087
What did he say, Harry?

291
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,956
Does he think I'm crazy too?

292
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,964
No one thinks you're crazy, Nancy.

293
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:32,659
How nice.

294
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:35,465
Then you believe me.
You believe I saw the satellite.

295
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,039
It's not the first time
someone has seen a satellite.

296
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,734
Right in the road, with a giant in it?

297
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:43,402
Don't be so condescending, Harry.

298
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:45,242
I know what you're thinking.

299
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,941
I know why Dr. Cushing was here,
I know who called him.

300
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:50,382
I called him.
He's here for your own good, Nancy.

301
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:54,046
And I know where you spent the night
last night too.

302
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,887
You seem to have a lot of information.

303
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:03,966
Well, I don't like being tailed
in my own home.

304
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:08,503
Here, your giant friend may come
looking for this.

305
00:22:09,573 --> 00:22:11,837
Harry, wait. Where are you going?

306
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:14,974
Ask Jess.

307
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,554
Wouldn't you like something to eat?
The doctor said...

308
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:29,022
Oh, Jess, quit mincing around
and leave me alone.

309
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:30,717
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:35,029
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is KRKR-TV.</i>

311
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,764
<i>And now, more news of high fliers.</i>

312
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:40,233
<i>Nancy Archer, the former Nancy Fowler...</i>

313
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:44,841
<i>... Heiress to the Fowler millions and owner</i>
<i>of the fabulous Star of India diamond...</i>

314
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:50,379

315
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:53,948
<i>From the Archers' palatial</i>
<i>home-away-from-home comes a report...</i>

316
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:57,952
<i>... That Mrs. Archer has not only been seeing</i>
<i>a sociable satellite...</i>

317
00:22:58,122 --> 00:22:59,817
<i>... But its inhabitant as well:</i>

318
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,390
<i>A 30-foot giant.</i>

319
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,553
<i>Was he pink with big ears and tusks?</i>

320
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:08,959
<i>Well, maybe Mrs. Archer...</i>

321
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:12,261
<i>... who has recently been feuding</i>
<i>with her husband, handsome Harry...</i>

322
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:15,496
<i>... Has finally found a man</i>
<i>from out of this world.</i>

323
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,937
<i>A man who could love her for herself.</i>

324
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:20,642
<i>Come, come, now, Mrs. Archer.</i>

325
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:25,180
<i>A man can ignore $ 1 million,</i>
<i>but 50?</i>

326
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,376
<i>That's too much to ask</i>
<i>even from the man in the moon.</i>

327
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:36,149
What happened?

328
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,059
So I'm crazy? I'm seeing things, am I?

329
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:43,230
Jess, get the car.

330
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,561
I'm going out to the desert
and find that thing.

331
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:47,601
And you're going with me.

332
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:49,767
Well, don't just stand there, go on.

333
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,432
You're being ridiculous, Nancy.
There's nothing out there.

334
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:55,474
You don't believe me.

335
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:57,705
Well, you're wrong. You're all wrong.

336
00:23:57,881 --> 00:24:00,850
You're drunk, Nancy.
Why don't you try to sleep it off?

337
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:03,885
Not until I've proved it to myself
and to you.

338
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:06,522
We'll drive on the side roads.

339
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:11,557
I have a strange feeling it's out there
somewhere waiting for me.

340
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:13,458
I'm certain of it.

341
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,427
And if it isn't?

342
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:21,665
Then I'm crazy
and should be committed.

343
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:26,005
The car's out in front, ma'am.

344
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,739
Jess, get the revolver.

345
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,641
What's the gun for?

346
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:35,682
We're going hunting, remember?

347
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:37,548
Let's go.

348
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,280
Nothing.

349
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,851
Just sand and space.

350
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,544
Well, seen enough?

351
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,819
Keep driving.

352
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:06,867
There. Stop the car, Harry, there it is.

353
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:08,939
I don't see a thing.

354
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:11,581
I saw it flash behind those hills.

355
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:15,648
All right, all right, I'll turn around.

356
00:26:16,753 --> 00:26:18,584
Hurry.

357
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:42,006
Well, now we've combed
all through these hills.

358
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,806
You saw it.

359
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:46,313
There's nothing out here.

360
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:49,085
Just emptiness.

361
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:55,620
Well, shall we drive on a little further?

362
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,992
I'm sorry, Harry.

363
00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:00,824
I'm sorry.

364
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:16,713
That's it. I did see it.

365
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:18,945
I told you. I told you!

366
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:21,482
I was right. I was right. It's real.

367
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:22,983
- It's real!
- Nancy.

368
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,717
Nancy, come back here.

369
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:26,355
Come back here.

370
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:29,117
Let's get out of here. Nancy.

371
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:33,162
It's real. It's real.

372
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,890
- Nancy, get away from it.
- I'm not crazy. I did see it.

373
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,397
- It's a satellite.
- Come here.

374
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:40,435
- Harry, touch it. I did see it.
- Nancy, come here.

375
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:51,147
Hurry, Harry!

376
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:53,180
Harry, help me!

377
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,217
Harry! Help me!

378
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:00,590
Help me, Harry!

379
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:03,624
Harry, help me!

380
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:06,885
Harry!

381
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:39,161
What have you done with Mrs. Archer?

382
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:41,456
Get out of my way.

383
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:48,200
You're not leaving this room
until you tell me what happened to her.

384
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:58,773
You aren't gonna get away with it.

385
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:46,326
Give me the sheriff's office.

386
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:01,702
Get dressed and packed, quick.

387
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:03,106
What's the matter?

388
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,044
No time for questions and answers now.

389
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:08,241
Here, we're getting out of here.

390
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:11,251
What did you do?
Rob the First National Bank?

391
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:14,254
Shut up and get moving. Come on.

392
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:17,359
All right, all right.

393
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:21,190
Nobody wants to get out of this dump
worse than I do.

394
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:32,801
Hey. Those are the only clothes I've got.

395
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:39,343
You finished yet?

396
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:42,979
You just got here.

397
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:49,556
If you saw what I saw, you'd have
jumped out of your skin to get moving.

398
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:51,626
Here, zip me.

399
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:56,632
- Come on, come on, come on.
- All right, all right.

400
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,928
- Where we going?
- Out of here, but fast.

401
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:03,197
You going some place?

402
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:06,006
Miss Parker is leaving town.

403
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:07,643
It's kind of sudden, ain't it?

404
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:10,575
The night clerk here
didn't know anything about it.

405
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:13,116
Well, she... She does now.

406
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:17,117
I'm sorry, Mr. Archer, but Sheriff Dubbitt
wants to see you in his office.

407
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:19,152
The both of you.

408
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,090
You're making a mistake, Charlie.

409
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:25,054
Let's go.

410
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,573
Let me see, now. You got three sixes...

411
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:43,406
...you got the queen of hearts,
that's the heart run...

412
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,673
...so safest card in the deck.

413
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,650
Hey, what do you want that card for?

414
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:50,446
And that's a gin.

415
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,952
I don't wanna play anymore.

416
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:55,985
Getting daylight already.

417
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:00,692
The chief's always worrying
about the taxpayers' money.

418
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,927
Yeah? Oh, hi, Mary.

419
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,501
No, darling,
I wasn't dancing at Tony's Club.

420
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:11,732
I was out picking up a couple of guests
for the sheriff.

421
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:15,002
Yeah, he's out in the desert now
with a posse looking for the...

422
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:17,237
Oh, they did, huh?

423
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:19,610
On the pool house?

424
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:21,842
What do you know about that?

425
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:25,181
Yeah. They found Mrs. Archer.

426
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:27,647
I don't know how she got there.

427
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:30,418
Hey, maybe by a helicopter, huh?

428
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:34,254
Yeah, all right, Mary.
Will you take any messages that come in?

429
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:37,662
Yeah, we're on our way right now.
Yeah. Bye, sweetie.

430
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:40,098
We'll take your wife's Imperial, right?

431
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,737
Yeah, right.

432
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:46,274
Imagine your wife was home all the time
on top of the pool house, loaded.

433
00:32:58,922 --> 00:33:00,480
How serious is it, Dr. Cushing?

434
00:33:00,657 --> 00:33:04,957
Too early to tell. But we should get her to
a hospital as soon as she's strong enough.

435
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:07,824
Those hours of exposure on the roof
didn't help any.

436
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:09,590
Especially the way she was dressed.

437
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:13,497
It's not the exposure that worries me,
it's those scratches on her throat.

438
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,399
That's Mr. Archer now.

439
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:17,898
And Honey.

440
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:19,632
I never would have thought it.

441
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:22,744
Better let me do the talking, Dr. Cushing.

442
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:30,048
What's wrong with Nancy?
What happened?

443
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,984
I'll ask the questions, Mr. Archer.

444
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,782
- Now, suppose you tell me what happened.
- I'm in no mood for games, sheriff.

445
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,690
I wouldn't go up there
if I were you, Harry.

446
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:42,525
There's some possibility
she may have been contaminated.

447
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:45,634
There's evidence
of some kind of radiation.

448
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:51,098
Of course, we can't be sure.

449
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,944
Now, tell me what happened out there,
Mr. Archer.

450
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:01,083
- Out where?
- Jess told us.

451
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:05,347
You drove Mrs. Archer out
into the desert last night with his gun.

452
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:07,456
You came back alone.

453
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:10,252
Now, what happened to Mrs. Archer...

454
00:34:10,427 --> 00:34:12,827
...and what happened
to the diamond she was wearing?

455
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:15,965
He's lying. I left the house alone.
Right after you, Dr. Cushing.

456
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:19,795
That's right.
Harry was with me all evening.

457
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,564
We were stepping out for air
when your deputy stopped us.

458
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,207
Dr. Cushing, it's time
for that injection you ordered.

459
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:28,401
Thank you, nurse, thank you.
I wouldn't have believed it, Harry.

460
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:30,739
I'm very disappointed.

461
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:34,179
- There seems to be a difference...
- Be careful with that, nurse.

462
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:36,911
Exactly 0.75 cc.

463
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:38,844
One way or another.

464
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:42,788
When Mrs. Archer regains consciousness,
she'll corroborate me, Sheriff Dubbitt.

465
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,790
Well, where does that leave us?

466
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,724
Nowhere.

467
00:34:47,263 --> 00:34:50,061
Just don't try to leave town for a while.

468
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,231
And that means you too, Miss Parker.

469
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:55,530
We have nothing to hide.
We'll be around.

470
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,505
Come on, Honey.
I'll drive you back into town.

471
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,666
According to Jess...

472
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:04,837
...Mr. Archer drove his wife
out into the desert last night...

473
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:06,243
...and came home alone.

474
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,476
One thing you can be certain about,
Jess is absolutely trustworthy.

475
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:11,883
He's been with Nancy
since she was a little girl.

476
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:13,818
I know he's telling the truth.

477
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,802
What's the matter?

478
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,939
Our necks are way out
if Nancy comes to and talks.

479
00:35:30,106 --> 00:35:33,974
There is a way out
if you've got the nerve.

480
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:35,736
Try me.

481
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:40,915
The serum that private nurse is using
in her hypodermic needle, I...

482
00:35:41,084 --> 00:35:45,111
I heard the doctor tell her
that an overdose would be fatal.

483
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:48,987
Money certainly brings out
the best in you, doesn't it?

484
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,589
Have you got the nerve?

485
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:54,855
Read the morning papers.

486
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,700
Slide over and drive to town.

487
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:01,631
I've got things to do.

488
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:00,919
Doctor. Doctor Cushing.

489
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,024
Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.

490
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:11,996
- Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.
- Astounding growth.

491
00:38:32,722 --> 00:38:34,451
Meat hooks.

492
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:38,826
- Four lengths of chain.
- The chains you were expecting are here.

493
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:41,395
Good. I'll tell Dr. Loeb at once.

494
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:46,195
Meat hooks, four lengths of chain...

495
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,031
...40 gallons of plasma...

496
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,964
...and an elephant syringe?

497
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:57,470
The chains are here.

498
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:01,516
Well, Heinrich, what do you make of it?

499
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:03,714
Fantastic.

500
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:05,821
I've made every test in the book.

501
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:08,321
There's no diagnosis.

502
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,293
Look at this slide.

503
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:14,529
Dermal connective tissue.

504
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:16,025
Filaria?

505
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,566
If only it were filaria.
We'd have something to go on.

506
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:20,930
A beginning.

507
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:23,072
There's not even
streptococcal infection...

508
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,901
...to incite the inflammation
of the lymph channels.

509
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:27,838
What could it be?

510
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:29,740
I don't know.

511
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:32,279
I just don't know.

512
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:37,151
We may find our answer
when we operate.

513
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,948
Giantism can result
from an overactive forward lobe...

514
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:42,057
...of the pituitary fossa, as you know.

515
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,989
Then you think surgery is indicated?

516
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,927
Except for that one thing.

517
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:53,159
The blue-green color
around the scratches at her throat.

518
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:55,566
I would venture to say...

519
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:58,901
...it is some sort of radiation...

520
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:02,077
...which we in medicine
have never touched upon.

521
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:06,477
Fortunately, the dose she received
was not deadly.

522
00:40:06,649 --> 00:40:08,310
Then you... You feel there is hope.

523
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:11,283
With surgery? Yes.

524
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:15,789
We'll have to have the husband's
permission to operate, of course.

525
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,926
There is always hope
as long as there is faith, Raymond.

526
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:31,873
I almost gave you up, baby.

527
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:38,603
I've been reading the papers.

528
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:41,306
I told you what happened on the phone.

529
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:46,684
We've got problems again.

530
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:50,420
That new doctor, Von Loeb,
thinks he can help her.

531
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:54,254
Bring me a drink, will you?

532
00:40:58,034 --> 00:41:02,471
What's the matter?
Your conscience bothering you, Harry?

533
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,472
You know, the trouble with us is
we've both got the same disease.

534
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:10,378
Money.

535
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:15,073
And happy ways of spending it.

536
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:19,387
I've missed you.

537
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,117
Has she talked yet?

538
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,815
She's still in a coma.

539
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:26,826
They're looking for me now
to give them permission to operate.

540
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:29,294
That's great. That's wonderful.

541
00:41:29,465 --> 00:41:33,663
You just hide out
and let her blow up like a balloon.

542
00:41:36,572 --> 00:41:39,040
You can pull now, Heinrich.

543
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,407
Steady.

544
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,597
Give me a boost, Charlie.

545
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:18,371
- Nothing.
- Yeah, I could see that from here.

546
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:20,277
Almost.

547
00:42:21,684 --> 00:42:24,016
There's a ladder over there.

548
00:42:34,163 --> 00:42:35,892
Charlie.

549
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,237
- What is it?
- I don't know.

550
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:47,103
But whatever it is,
it wasn't made by a Japanese gardener.

551
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,268
Go get Jess.
Tell him to get down here pronto.

552
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,279
Excuse me.

553
00:42:56,919 --> 00:43:01,015
Jess. Sheriff Dubbitt wants to see you.

554
00:43:01,357 --> 00:43:03,154
Right away.

555
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:12,694
I thought you two might like a cool...

556
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:16,938
Did you ever see anything like this
around here before, Jess?

557
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:18,971
A giant footprint.

558
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:23,107
Maybe Mrs. Archer wasn't so...

559
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:25,611
I've been thinking the same thing myself.

560
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:28,113
Hey, look.
There's another one over there.

561
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,457
- Hey, look. There's another one.
- Charlie.

562
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:40,855
We've got to keep quiet about this thing
or everybody will think we're nuts.

563
00:43:41,697 --> 00:43:44,894
Be dark in a half-hour.
We'll follow these, see where they lead.

564
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:47,035
- We will?
- Mrs. Archer has a station wagon.

565
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:50,366
Good. Run my car into town
and get the riot gun, Charlie.

566
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,566
Bring a couple of grenades
and some tear gas and flashlights too.

567
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:56,837
- Tear gas? Grenades?
- We'll leave as soon as you get back.

568
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:59,345
You better plan
on being up all night tonight.

569
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:03,110
We've gotta have somebody in the office
in case Jess and I wanna get in touch.

570
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:06,346
Sure. You know,
I'd like to go with you, chief.

571
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,054
There will be no charge for overtime.

572
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,828
Come on, Jess.
There's still some daylight left.

573
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:19,194
Let's follow these things.

574
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,700
Excuse me, chief.

575
00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:59,970
Bring it up.

576
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:42,379
Amazing.

577
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:45,615
Here.

578
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:48,086
We'd better walk the rest of the way.

579
00:45:48,257 --> 00:45:51,055
There's a radio phone in the car.
Shouldn't we call for help?

580
00:45:51,227 --> 00:45:55,220
No use yelling for outside interference
until we see what we got.

581
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:01,761
Harry must have brought her out here
and left her.

582
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:03,965
And then this...

583
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,837
This giant must have taken her home
and put her on the pool-house roof.

584
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,875
Amazing.

585
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:11,912
Look.

586
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:17,381
My gun.

587
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:20,989
He emptied it before he ran.

588
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:23,321
At what?

589
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:04,325
Over here.

590
00:48:28,884 --> 00:48:30,374
Look.

591
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:36,316
The Star of India.

592
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:38,585
Mrs. Archer was right.

593
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:40,888
The thing was after her diamond.

594
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:43,531
Diamonds everywhere. Different colors.

595
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:45,929
Must be used to power this thing
in some way.

596
00:48:46,101 --> 00:48:49,070
Let's take this one and get out of here.

597
00:51:03,505 --> 00:51:05,996
Charlie. Charlie.

598
00:51:06,175 --> 00:51:07,767
The radio's shot too.

599
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:10,173
We might as well start walking.

600
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,612
We'll come back for all this stuff later.

601
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,050
It's gonna be a long walk.

602
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:34,194
I've known Nancy since she was born.

603
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,497
In those days, she was a beautiful child.

604
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:40,768
Fresh, young, full of the joys of life.

605
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:46,108
But in the last few years, after her marriage,
she changed.

606
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:51,408
Her health seemed to rise and fall
with the tide of her emotions.

607
00:51:51,587 --> 00:51:53,487
A very sad case.

608
00:51:53,656 --> 00:51:58,059
A case not infrequent
in this supersonic age we live in.

609
00:52:00,863 --> 00:52:07,200
I'm afraid I was unwise in advising her
to take Harry back after they'd separated.

610
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:09,764
Who knows, my friend?

611
00:52:10,406 --> 00:52:12,806
When women reach the age of maturity...

612
00:52:12,975 --> 00:52:16,172
...Mother Nature sometimes
overworks their frustration...

613
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:19,212
...to a point of irrationalism.

614
00:52:19,381 --> 00:52:23,442
Like the middle-aged man of our age...

615
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:27,487
...who finds himself looking longingly...

616
00:52:28,123 --> 00:52:30,614
...at a girl in her early 20s.

617
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:33,993
Harry!

618
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,327
What was that?

619
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:38,591
Harry!

620
00:52:39,668 --> 00:52:41,499
Harry.

621
00:52:42,104 --> 00:52:43,628
I'll get Dr. Cushing.

622
00:52:43,806 --> 00:52:46,707
Harry. I want him here.

623
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,776
Nancy, Nancy, calm yourself. Morphine.

624
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:52,106
Harry's asleep in his room.
He'll be right here.

625
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:55,842
- Harry!
- Call the sheriff.

626
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,354
Harry.

627
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:02,547
Harry!

628
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:06,483
Sheriff's office, please.

629
00:53:06,662 --> 00:53:08,459
And hurry, operator, it's urgent.

630
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,690
- Harry.
- Hello. Sheriff Dubbitt.

631
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:13,391
Have you found Mr. Archer yet?

632
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:16,663
No, ma'am,
but I left messages everywhere in town.

633
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:18,397
Oh, she did, huh?

634
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,007
She is?

635
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:22,939
Yes, ma'am, I know it's an emergency.

636
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:25,273
All right, I will, right away.

637
00:53:29,384 --> 00:53:33,582
Hi, Mary. I'm going over to Tony's Club
and then I'm heading out to the Archers'.

638
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:36,884
If Sheriff Dubbitt calls in,
tell him he'd better get out there too.

639
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:39,186
Thank you, baby. Bye.

640
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:10,457
No, there's no cutting in here
at Tony's Club, buddy.

641
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:13,652
- Mr. Archer.
- Why, it's the deputy.

642
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:15,421
What can we do for you this time?

643
00:54:15,597 --> 00:54:17,861
Your house has been trying
to get you all evening.

644
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:20,365
- Didn't the bartender give you my message?
- He did.

645
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:24,063
And now you've delivered it in person.
Anything else?

646
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:25,365
No...

647
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:29,534
Well, yes, there is.
They say it's important. An emergency.

648
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:33,408
Well, thanks.

649
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:35,878
All right.

650
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:39,616
Let's see, now. Where were we, huh?

651
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:43,253
- Here.
- Oh, yeah.

652
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:46,152
Never should have kept this
out of the papers.

653
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:48,888
The poor girl, she's had
so much publicity all her life.

654
00:54:49,064 --> 00:54:52,625
I'm afraid now there's no alternative.
We'll have to notify the authorities.

655
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:56,737
If you hadn't given her that sedative, there's
no telling what would have happened.

656
00:54:56,905 --> 00:55:00,739
Well, thank heaven
we got the chains on her arms and legs.

657
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:04,902
- How long will the morphine be effective?
- No telling, with the size of her body.

658
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,413
But we'll have to keep her under sedation
until the state police arrive.

659
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:11,553
I'll phone the authorities at Baker.

660
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,418
Operator.

661
00:55:16,058 --> 00:55:18,925
Doctor! Dr. Cushing, it's her.
She's come to again.

662
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:23,121
- Dr. Cushing!
- Hither, nurse. More morphine.

663
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:28,201
<i>Operator. Operator. Operator.</i>
<i>This is Mary, your operator.</i>

664
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,668
<i>What's going on there?</i>
<i>What's happening?</i>

665
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:33,774
Hurry with that morphine, Cushing.

666
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,509
She's loose.

667
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:40,975
She'll tear the roof off.

668
00:55:55,931 --> 00:55:58,058
Operator. Operator.

669
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:00,030
It's dead.

670
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:08,069
I know where my husband is.

671
00:56:08,243 --> 00:56:10,939
He's with that woman.

672
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,780
I'll find him.

673
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,941
She's loose.

674
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,215
A tank couldn't have done a better job.

675
00:56:24,393 --> 00:56:26,156
She... She's heading for town.

676
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:41,941
Hi, chief. I was just on my way over
to the Archers'.

677
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,772
I think Mrs. Archer finally came to.

678
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:47,142
Say, they've been
asking for you over there.

679
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:50,251
- Did you find anything out there?
- Get moving, will you?

680
00:56:50,419 --> 00:56:53,047
Yeah, sure, sure, hop in.

681
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:55,985
Say, where's the station wagon, chief?

682
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:19,672
Doctor. Doctor,
give us a hand with the door.

683
00:57:19,848 --> 00:57:22,408
Here's the sheriff's car.

684
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:30,223
Holy Toledo. What happened?

685
00:57:30,392 --> 00:57:33,293
Thank heaven you're here.
It's Mrs. Archer. She's on a rampage.

686
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:35,987
- We've got to warn the town.
- She's grown into a giant.

687
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,860
Never mind. Get into the car.
We'll explain as we go along.

688
00:57:39,034 --> 00:57:40,934
Drive to town.

689
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:50,276
Uranium.

690
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:55,582
This is just make-believe.
A lot of junk to sell to the people.

691
00:57:56,752 --> 00:58:00,051
It ain't like the old days when
we could go out prospecting for gold...

692
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:03,453
...with a sluice box and water.

693
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:10,957
I can see it now.

694
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:23,107
Come on, Hazel. Come on.

695
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:39,121
Hey, hey, hey, Tony.
Something's happened to your lights.

696
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:41,023
I got eyes. I can see.

697
00:58:41,196 --> 00:58:44,654
- Who needs lights?
- Well, I need another drink.

698
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:49,827
- Hey, Ton. Tony.
- Oh, you're a good fellow, Tony.

699
00:58:50,005 --> 00:58:52,166
Attaboy, Ton.

700
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,071
- Mellow, mellow...
- Happy birthday, Honey.

701
00:58:59,214 --> 00:59:01,341
Well, wouldn't you know it.

702
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:12,385
Can't you drive any faster?

703
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:18,482
What happened?

704
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,525
Was it a giant woman?

705
01:00:20,695 --> 01:00:23,664
- Going toward town?
- Let's hurry.

706
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:51,416
Harry.

707
01:01:11,313 --> 01:01:13,713
She'll tear up the whole town
until she finds Harry.

708
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:16,407
Yeah, then she'll tear up Harry.

709
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,460
See if you can locate him
and put him in the police car.

710
01:01:34,636 --> 01:01:38,037
We'll try and draw her off.
I'll call Baker for help.

711
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,239
Come on, let's get out of here.

712
01:01:52,053 --> 01:01:54,180
Let's get the sheriff.

713
01:01:58,793 --> 01:02:02,126
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Harry!

714
01:02:02,297 --> 01:02:04,595
It sounds like someone's
calling your name.

715
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:06,393
Harry!

716
01:02:06,568 --> 01:02:08,297
Harry!

717
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:11,064
It's your wife.
She's wrecking the town looking for you.

718
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:13,434
- Come on, I gotta get you out of here.
- No.

719
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:17,066
If she sees me out there, she'll kill me.
She's crazy.

720
01:02:17,245 --> 01:02:20,271
Come on, Mr. Archer,
we gotta get out of here.

721
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:25,618
You're a deputy. Do something.

722
01:02:26,988 --> 01:02:28,421
I can't shoot a lady.

723
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:31,582
Give me the gun. Give me that gun.

724
01:02:46,107 --> 01:02:48,075
No. No, no, Mrs. Archer.

725
01:03:05,593 --> 01:03:08,391
Help me move this beam, Charlie.

726
01:03:10,398 --> 01:03:12,423
She's dead.

727
01:03:14,102 --> 01:03:16,764
No. No, Nancy. Nancy.

728
01:03:17,205 --> 01:03:20,663
No! Nancy.

729
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:22,803
Nancy. Nancy, no.

730
01:03:22,977 --> 01:03:25,070
Nancy, no.

731
01:03:25,246 --> 01:03:26,611
Nancy, don't.

732
01:03:26,781 --> 01:03:28,271
Oh, no.

733
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:31,385
- Don't, Nancy. You killed Honey.
- No.

734
01:03:31,553 --> 01:03:33,885
Nancy, no. Put me down.

735
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:36,615
You killed Honey. Nancy, no.

736
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:38,258
Nancy, no. No.

737
01:03:38,426 --> 01:03:41,520
You're crushing me. I can't breathe.

738
01:03:44,399 --> 01:03:45,696
Hurry. Hurry.

739
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:48,392
She's got Harry. She's got Harry.

740
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:52,001
- Why doesn't the sheriff do something?
- She's squeezing him to death.

741
01:03:52,674 --> 01:03:55,199
Put him down, Mrs. Archer.

742
01:04:14,929 --> 01:04:17,397
Sheriff, you're not gonna
use that on her.

743
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:20,762
What do you want me to do?
Put salt on her tail?

744
01:04:42,023 --> 01:04:43,422
She's down.

745
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:45,422
Let's take a look.

746
01:04:45,593 --> 01:04:47,288
Let's go.

747
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:07,078
All right, everybody keep back now.
Come on. Stand back there.

748
01:05:19,527 --> 01:05:22,963
She finally got Harry all to herself.
