00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,084
            COME ON,
            COME ON, COME ON.

527
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,419
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

528
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:56,753
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

529
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,322
            OUT OF HERE,
            BUT FAST.

530
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,192
            YOU GOING SOMEPLACE?

531
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,962
UH, MISS PARKER
IS LEAVING TOWN.

532
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,563
            IT'S KIND OF SUDDEN,
            AIN'T IT?

533
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,733
            THE NIGHT CLERK HERE
            DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
            ABOUT IT.

534
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,236
WELL, WELL,
SHE--SHE DOES NOW.

535
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,670
            NO. I'M SORRY,
            MR. ARCHER,

536
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:16,340
            BUT SHERIFF TUPPETT
            WANTS TO SEE YOU
            IN HIS OFFICE,

537
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,875
            THE BOTH OF YOU.

538
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,179
YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE, CHARLIE.

539
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,580
            LET'S GO.

540
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,897
AW, LET ME SEE NOW.
YOU GOT 3 6s,

541
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,699
YOU GOT THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,
THAT'S A HEART RUN,

542
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,569
SO SAFEST CARD
IN THE DECK.

543
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,871
HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT
THAT CARD FOR?

544
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,406
            AND THAT'S A GIN.

545
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,642
I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY ANYMORE.

546
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,478
AH, IT'S GETTING
DAYLIGHT ALREADY.

547
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,782
CHIEF'S ALWAYS WORRYING
ABOUT THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY.

548
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,817
            [RING]

549
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,853
HELLO.

550
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,388
OH, HI, MARY.

551
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,691
NO DARLIN', I WASN'T
DANCING AT TONY'S CLUB.

552
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,794
I WAS OUT PICKING UP
A COUPLE OF GUESTS
OF THE SHERIFF.

553
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,997
YEAH, HE'S OUT IN THE DESERT
NOW WITH A POSSE,
LOOKING FOR THE--

554
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,999
OH, THEY DID, HUH?

555
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,368
ON THE POOL HOUSE?

556
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,704
HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

557
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,972
HUH? YEAH.

558
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,840
THEY FOUND MRS. ARCHER.

559
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,843
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE GOT THERE.

560
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:29,713
HEY, MAYBE
BY A HELICOPTER, HUH?

561
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,148
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, MARY.

562
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,250
LOOK, WILL YOU TAKE
ANY MESSAGES THAT COME IN?

563
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,118
YEAH, WE'RE ON OUR WAY
RIGHT NOW.

564
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,620
YEAH, BYE, SWEETIE.

565
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,222
WE'LL TAKE YOUR WIFE'S
IMPERIAL, RIGHT?

566
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,324
YEAH, RIGHT.

567
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,859
I IMAGINE YOUR WIFE
WAS HOME ALL THE TIME

568
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,896
ON TOP OF THE POOL HOUSE,
LOADED.

569
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,943
HOW SERIOUS IS IT,
DR. CUSHING?

570
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,244
        OH, IT'S TOO EARLY
        TO TELL,

571
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,612
        BUT WE SHOULD GET HER
        TO A HOSPITAL

572
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,114
        AS SOON AS SHE'S STRONG
        ENOUGH TO BE MOVED.

573
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,050
THOSE HOURS OF EXPOSURE
ON THE ROOF DIDN'T HELP ANY,

574
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,618
ESPECIALLY THE WAY
SHE WAS DRESSED.

575
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,854
        IT'S NOT THE EXPOSURE
        THAT WORRIES ME.

576
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,023
        IT'S THOSE SCRATCHES
        ON HER THROAT.

577
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,591
                Jess: THAT'S
                MR. ARCHER NOW.

578
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,526
AND HONEY.

579
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,662
            I NEVER WOULD HAVE
            THOUGHT IT.

580
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,732
BETTER LET ME
DO THE TALKING,
DR. CUSHING.

581
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,334
                [DOOR OPENS]

582
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,572
        WHAT'S WRONG WITH NANCY?

583
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,673
        DOCTOR, WHAT HAPPENED?

584
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,608
I'LL ASK THE QUESTIONS,
MR. ARCHER.

585
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,478
NOW SUPPOSE YOU
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

586
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,046
        I'M IN NO MOOD
        FOR GAMES, SHERIFF.

587
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,849
            I WOULDN'T
            GO UP THERE IF
            I WERE YOU, HARRY.

588
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,183
            THERE'S SOME
            POSSIBILITY

589
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,952
            SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
            CONTAMINATED.

590
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:45,722
            THERE'S EVIDENCE
            OF SOME KIND
            OF RADIATION.

591
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,560
            OF COURSE,
            WE CAN'T BE SURE.

592
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,934
NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
OUT THERE, MR. ARCHER.

593
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,036
        OUT WHERE?

594
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,470
JESS TOLD US.

595
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:04,374
YOU DROVE MRS. ARCHER
OUT INTO THE DESERT
LAST NIGHT WITH HIS GUN.

596
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,610
YOU CAME BACK ALONE.

597
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:09,613
NOW, UH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO MRS. ARCHER,

598
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,049
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE DIAMOND
SHE WAS WEARING?

599
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,316
        HE'S LYING.

600
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:14,985
        I LEFT THE HOUSE ALONE,
        RIGHT AFTER YOU,
        DR. CUSHING.

601
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,453
            THAT'S RIGHT.

602
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,622
            HARRY WAS WITH ME
            ALL EVENING.

603
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,557
            WE WERE JUST
            STEPPING OUT FOR AIR

604
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,059
            WHEN YOUR DEPUTY
            STOPPED US.

605
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,294
        DR. CUSHING, IT'S TIME
        FOR THAT INJECTION
        YOU ORDERED.

606
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,729
            THANK YOU, NURSE.
            THANK YOU.

607
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:26,830
            I WOULDN'T HAVE
            BELIEVED IT, HARRY.

608
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,332
            I'M VERY
            DISAPPOINTED.

609
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,102
Sheriff Tuppett:
WELL, THERE SEEMS
TO BE A DIFFERENCE...

610
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,637
    CAREFUL WITH THAT,
    NURSE.

611
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,073
    EXACTLY .75 CC.

612
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,908
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

613
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,177
        WHEN MRS. ARCHER
        REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS,

614
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,845
        SHE'LL CORROBORATE ME,
        SHERIFF TUPPETT.

615
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,847
    WELL, WHERE DOES
    THAT LEAVE US?

616
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,049
NOWHERE.

617
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,418
JUST DON'T TRY
TO LEAVE TOWN FOR A WHILE,

618
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,687
AND THAT MEANS YOU,
TOO, MISS PARKER.

619
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,056
        Harry: WE HAVE
        NOTHING TO HIDE.

620
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,491
                WE'LL BE AROUND.

621
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,761
        COME ON, HONEY.
        I'LL DRIVE YOU
        BACK INTO TOWN.

622
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,963
ACCORDING TO JESS,

623
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:04,000
MR. ARCHER DROVE HIS WIFE OUT
INTO THE DESERT LAST NIGHT

624
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,535
AND CAME HOME ALONE.

625
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,537
    WELL, THERE'S ONE THING
    YOU CAN BE CERTAIN ABOUT.

626
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,072
    JESS IS ABSOLUTELY
    TRUSTWORTHY.

627
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,041
    HE'S BEEN WITH NANCY
    SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

628
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,976
    I KNOW HE'S
    TELLING THE TRUTH.

629
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,288
Honey: WHAT'S THE MATTER?

630
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:28,592
        OUR NECKS ARE WAY OUT
        IF NANCY COMES TO
        AND TALKS.

631
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,629
THERE IS A WAY OUT,
IF YOU'VE GOT THE NERVE.

632
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,064
            TRY ME.

633
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,535
THE SERUM THAT
PRIVATE NURSE IS USING
IN HER HYPODERMIC NEEDLE--

634
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,404
I, UM, I HEARD
THE DOCTOR TELL HER

635
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,307
THAT AN OVERDOSE
WOULD BE FATAL.

636
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:48,211
            MONEY CERTAINLY
            BRINGS OUT THE BEST
            IN YOU, DOESN'T IT?

637
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,280
HAVE YOU GOT THE NERVE?

638
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:54,117
        READ THE MORNING PAPERS.

639
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,655
        SLIDE OVER
        AND DRIVE TO TOWN.

640
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,790
        I'VE GOT THINGS TO DO.

641
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,241
            AAH!

642
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,242
            DOCTOR!

643
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,243
        DR. CUSHING!

644
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,012
        SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
        TO MRS. ARCHER!

645
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,546
            AAH!

646
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,016
            AAH!

647
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,418
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
TO MRS. ARCHER.

648
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,887
            Dr. Cushing:
            ASTOUNDING GROWTH.

649
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,089
    AAH!

650
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,392
    AAH!

651
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,743
MEAT HOOKS,

652
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,679
4 LENGTHS OF CHAIN.

653
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:38,481
            OH, THE CHAINS
            YOU WERE EXPECTING
            ARE HERE, DOCTOR.

654
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,584
        GOOD. I'LL TELL
        DR. LOEB AT ONCE.

655
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,919
MEAT HOOKS,

656
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,021
4 LENGTHS OF CHAIN,

657
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:48,058
40 GALLONS OF PLASMA...

658
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,260
AND AN ELEPHANT SYRINGE?

659
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,299
THE CHAINS ARE HERE.

660
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,634
