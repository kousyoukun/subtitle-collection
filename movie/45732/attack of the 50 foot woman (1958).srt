1
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,172
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:05,546
This is KRKR-TV.
And now for the latest news.

3
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,416
Early tonight the captain of
a Swedish icebreaker in the Barents Sea...

4
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:13,081
...reported seeing a strange red fireball
come out of the sky.

5
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:14,521
Says the captain:

6
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,821
"It hovered above my ship
for about a minute...

7
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:19,966
...and then headed south by southwest. "
Unquote.

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,496
Radio Cairo reports a herd of camels
stampeded by a comet-like object...

9
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:26,832
...streaking southwest
across the Sahara.

10
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,737
And in Cape Town, Africa,
a Boer, no doubt...

11
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,070
...reports a similar flash across the sky.

12
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,179
And still one more,
ladies and gentlemen.

13
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:38,078
A farmer in Auckland, New Zealand
reported the strange glowing object...

14
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:40,310
...this time moving northeast.

15
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:42,284
Now, let's see.

16
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:46,885
Barents Sea.

17
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,755
Cairo.

18
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:50,691
Auckland.

19
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,662
Considering the time table
of these reports...

20
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:02,968
...the stranger from space should be over
our California desert in a matter of minutes.

21
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:59,954
No, no!

22
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,164
Harry! Harry help me!

23
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,172
Harry, help me!

24
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:11,935
Harry...

25
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:14,410
Harry, what will your wife say?

26
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:17,448
She'll say plenty, tonight anyhow.

27
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:20,586
Did you see the way she tore out of here
in that big car of hers?

28
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:23,154
She only caught us
nodding to each other.

29
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:26,588
She'll make up for all the things
she hasn't caught us doing.

30
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,421
I'm so fed up.

31
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,860
I never should have agreed
to go back to her once we were separated.

32
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:34,625
- Why did you?
- You know why.

33
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,564
I couldn't pry one nickel out of her.

34
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:40,399
That community-property routine
only works for women.

35
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:43,133
A man hasn't got a chance.

36
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:46,539
Unless the wife dies.

37
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,345
I didn't say anything.

38
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,486
You were thinking it.

39
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,883
Not the same thing.

40
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:58,822
Didn't you say she was
in the nut house for a while?

41
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,653
A private sanitarium.

42
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:03,489
What's the difference?
She was off her rocker, wasn't she?

43
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,826
I suppose so.
Probably got some fancy name for it.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,798
Mostly she'd have
these violent headaches.

45
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,369
And then she'd get falling-down drunk.

46
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,871
Still has them to this day.

47
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:16,669
What are you getting at?

48
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:20,711
Oh, come on, now, Harry.
Let's not be naive.

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,872
You've made a good start,
now follow through.

50
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,383
- She's on the brink and you know it.
- I don't know it.

51
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:29,954
This Dr. Cushing seems to be
helping her a lot.

52
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:31,852
She's tapering off on the bottle too.

53
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:34,118
Hardly took a drink all evening,
you saw her.

54
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,728
All she needs is a little help.

55
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,530
Play the husband right to the end.

56
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,726
Once she's in the booby hatch,
throw the key away.

57
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:47,306
That will put you in the driver's seat.

58
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:53,044
You'd make a wild driver, Harry.

59
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,813
With 50 million bucks.

60
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,886
Harry!

61
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,452
Harry!

62
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:06,182
Harry, help me!

63
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,350
Mrs. Archer. Mrs. Archer,
what's the matter?

64
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:11,497
Here, somebody give me a hand.
We'll take her into the office.

65
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:13,495
Hey, chief!

66
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,631
Chief.

67
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:17,599
- Mrs. Archer.
- Harry.

68
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,067
Go on, folks, go on.

69
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,333
Go on, nothing you can do around here.

70
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:24,703
Go find Harry
while I take care of Mrs. Archer.

71
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:27,676
- All right, let's break it up.
- Now, come on, Mrs. Archer.

72
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,145
Come on and sit down in the car.

73
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:32,511
I'll send somebody
for some black coffee.

74
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:36,143
Black coffee?
You think I'm drunk, don't you?

75
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:39,052
- All of you! I'm not drunk, I'm not!
- Now, Mrs. Archer.

76
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:40,817
- You've got to believe me.
- Please...

77
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:43,690
It was right in the middle of the highway,
30 feet tall.

78
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:45,831
- It lit up the sky.
- I know that.

79
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,457
You don't believe me, do you?
Any of you.

80
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:51,570
I'll believe you, Mrs. Archer.

81
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:53,968
I'll believe you, just be calm.

82
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,631
Now, come on and sit down in the car.

83
00:05:56,809 --> 00:06:00,267
Come on, take it easy
and tell me all about it, slowly.

84
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,710
Hey, Mr. Archer.

85
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,051
Mr. Archer.

86
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:11,122
What is it, Charlie?

87
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,852
Oh, all right, I get the message.

88
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:18,156
She's over at the sheriff's office.
She's in kind of bad shape.

89
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,798
She's pretty hysterical.

90
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:23,561
You couldn't find me tonight, Charlie.
I took a cab home.

91
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:25,670
Sure, sure, I get it, Mr. Archer.

92
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:27,567
Thanks a lot.

93
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:32,041
So... So she's tapering off, eh?

94
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,236
Hardly took a drink all evening.

95
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,746
Must have been a bottle in the car,
I don't know.

96
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:41,352
- Did you find Mr. Archer?
- He took a cab home, chief.

97
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:44,547
Charlie, go get the riot gun.

98
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:47,056
We're taking a ride in the desert
with Mrs. Archer.

99
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:48,488
Right.

100
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:52,393
Why the heavy artillery, chief?

101
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:53,896
There's a flying satellite...

102
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:57,969
...and a 30-foot giant
a few miles out on 66.

103
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:08,941
A 30-foot giant?

104
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:10,843
Oh, no.

105
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,643
Hey, look. There it is.

106
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,058
Mrs. Archer's car, I mean, chief.

107
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,829
Where did you see it, Mrs. Archer?

108
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,304
You can think what you like.

109
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,602
It was right there
in the middle of the road.

110
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:15,680
Yes, ma'am.
Come on, Charlie, let's look around.

111
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,480
What's up?
She off her rocker or something?

112
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:26,352
Don't look back, but as long as she's
paying most of the taxes around here...

113
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:28,653
...we play along with her.

114
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:34,592
Let's spread out here.

115
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:59,589
You see anything, chief?

116
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,420
Come on.

117
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:09,699
Not a thing, Mrs. Archer.
No prints of any kind either.

118
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:13,999
Why would there be? I told you
everything happened on the roadway.

119
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:18,540
I was standing right here.

120
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:21,671
It seemed to be reaching
for my diamond.

121
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:24,908
That's another thing
I've been wanting to tell you, Mrs. Archer.

122
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:28,417
That diamond you're wearing
would tempt the devil himself.

123
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:30,613
There are a lot of drifters in the desert...

124
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,725
...who'd commit murder
for a well-cut piece of glass.

125
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:37,518
In other words, you're suggesting
what I saw tonight was some desert tramp.

126
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:39,289
You're saying that, ma'am.

127
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:42,992
I'm only suggesting that you be
more careful with that diamond.

128
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,900
I didn't run all the way to town
just for a lecture, sheriff.

129
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:51,075
We'll be glad to escort you home,
Mrs. Archer.

130
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:53,075
No, thanks.

131
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,690
Boy, she's tearing out of here
like she was heading for the moon.

132
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:13,923
Poor, mixed-up Mrs. Archer.
I feel kind of sorry for her.

133
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,295
Well, I feel a lot sorrier
for her husband...

134
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:19,927
...if she catches him with that
Honey Parker he's got stashed at the hotel.

135
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:22,870
- What a doll.
- Yeah.

136
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,636
Well, come on, Charlie.
It's past midnight.

137
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:28,780
Town can't afford
to be paying us overtime.

138
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,171
Good evening, Mrs. Archer.

139
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:20,193
Is there anything I can do for you,
Mrs. Archer?

140
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,594
Yeah.

141
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:25,694
Beat it out of here.

142
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,836
Don't talk to Jess like that.

143
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,447
Maybe you should marry Jess
and hire me for the butler.

144
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:40,149
Hey. I said out.

145
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,618
You can go, Jess.

146
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:45,347
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,592
And as far as I'm concerned,
you can go too.

148
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:55,063
Go back to Tony's
and that woman you were mooning about.

149
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:56,961
Knock it off, will you?

150
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:59,570
Now, you pulled a boner tonight,
and you know it.

151
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:04,642
Why, leaving me stranded at Tony's
without a ride.

152
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,211
I wasn't in the mood for an argument
in front of all those people.

153
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:11,043
I didn't feel like sitting there
and watching you flirt...

154
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:13,276
...with that red-headed wench
you call Honey.

155
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,943
For heaven's sake, Nancy.

156
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,116
Why, I hardly nodded to the girl.

157
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,919
Now, you listen to me, Harry.

158
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,994
I won't stand for any more
of your two-timing.

159
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:28,458
You keep away from that girl
in that hotel, you hear?

160
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:31,034
Your backdoor romancing
split us up once already.

161
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:34,366
The next time
there won't be any reconciliation.

162
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:39,466
You know, you're gonna flip your lid
just one time too many with me, Nancy.

163
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:43,137
And you're gonna make
one too many passes at some other woman.

164
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:45,307
My husband.

165
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,924
My gigolo, that's what you are.

166
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:57,256
You're a miserable parasite.
You're just after my money.

167
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,821
I was rid of you once.

168
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,990
Why did I take you back?

169
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:04,796
Why, why?

170
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,999
Why did you, Nancy?

171
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,604
Why?

172
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,447
Because I love you, Harry.

173
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:23,618
Why am I always fighting with you
when I love you so?

174
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:27,491
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,423
But if you'd only show me once
that you really cared...

176
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:33,792
...I'd do anything.

177
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,127
What's wrong with us, Harry?

178
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:40,898
I don't know.

179
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,067
Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm...

180
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,910
Harry, I've got to tell you something.

181
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:52,243
Only please don't make fun of me.

182
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:54,852
First, listen to the whole story.

183
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:02,250
Tonight while I was driving home...

184
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:06,064
You're going to think I'm crazy.

185
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,595
No, no. Go on, Nancy.

186
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:14,301
Harry, I saw a satellite tonight.

187
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:20,373
Oh, is that all?

188
00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:22,878
You know,
everyone's seeing satellites these days.

189
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,538
Not like this.

190
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:27,618
It came out of the sky
and landed in the middle of the highway.

191
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,587
Harry, I almost hit it.

192
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:34,388
And a man,
a giant of a man came out of it.

193
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,763
I could feel his hands at my throat.

194
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:41,195
I think he was after my diamond.

195
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:45,197
Well, I see you still have the diamond.

196
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:48,863
I ran in the desert,
that's why I'm such a mess.

197
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,944
I told the sheriff and he didn't believe me.
I saw the look on his face.

198
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:56,980
He thought I was drinking.
Harry, you know I wasn't drinking tonight.

199
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:00,551
Oh, please, Harry.
You believe me, don't you?

200
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:05,080
Of course I do, sweetheart.
Now, you've had a terrible night.

201
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:06,554
I think you need some rest.

202
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:09,023
Now, it's late. Come on.

203
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:13,256
I'm gonna put you to bed
and we'll go through this tomorrow.

204
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:27,544
Why can't you be nice like this
all the time, Harry?

205
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:29,880
There.

206
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:35,919
Oh, now, I never meant
to be mean to you, Nancy.

207
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:42,090
Any more than I wanted you to stay
in that sanitarium...

208
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:44,219
...you know?

209
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:46,422
Well...

210
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,961
...things seem to worry you lately.

211
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,435
You know, like before.

212
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:57,232
I don't know.

213
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:00,642
Maybe it's my fault, huh?

214
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:05,577
For not making things easier for you.

215
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:11,211
Maybe it would be better
if we separated again.

216
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,326
Now, I wouldn't want to cause
another breakdown in your health.

217
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:19,191
Oh, Harry, I couldn't stand that.

218
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:20,798
I need you.

219
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,730
Oh, if you only knew how much.

220
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:26,568
You're all I have, Harry.

221
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:29,731
There you go.

222
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:33,167
That's why I've always liked this place.

223
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,242
We could be so happy here.

224
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:39,282
Just the two of us, no more arguments.

225
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:42,416
Here, Nancy. This will make you sleep.

226
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,078
I don't wanna sleep.

227
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,156
I feel much better with you here.

228
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:48,486
No more arguments.

229
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,626
Water.

230
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:58,870
There you go.

231
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:00,767
That's the girl.

232
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,698
Feel better?

233
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:11,112
Don't leave me, Harry.

234
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:26,728
Harry.

235
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,693
I need you, all to myself.

236
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,063
Hi, Mr. Archer. I was...

237
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:12,904
<i>I was just saying arrivederci.</i>

238
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:18,214
I thought you'd be waiting for me
at your hotel.

239
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:20,784
You know I don't like you
hanging around here alone.

240
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:23,717
You're not jealous of that clown,
are you?

241
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:25,982
It's too early to go to bed.

242
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:29,491
Anyways, I'm sick of that fleabag
you call a hotel.

243
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:31,459
And I'm tired of waiting.

244
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,361
All I do is wait, wait, wait.

245
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,365
Maybe you won't have to wait
as long as you think.

246
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:47,345
She's cracking up again.
She's seeing satellites and giants.

247
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:50,880
Not only told me about it,
but she spread it all over town tonight.

248
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,384
- Even had the sheriff out looking for it.
- Charlie was telling me about it.

249
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:56,849
This could be it.

250
00:18:57,022 --> 00:19:00,389
When Dr. Cushing hears about it,
he'll have her committed right away.

251
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,288
He's in Baker. I'll call him tonight.

252
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:04,486
Well, that sounds more like it.

253
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:07,962
I don't think I could take
much more of this setup.

254
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:11,935
Well, anytime
you get to thinking that way...

255
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,505
...remember this.

256
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,204
The Star of India.

257
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:19,640
It's the most famous diamond
in the world.

258
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:22,975
And you play your cards right
and it'll all be yours.

259
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:26,444
Someday.

260
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,146
Let's call Dr. Cushing.

261
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,930
- What do you think, Dr. Cushing?
- She's not well, Harry.

262
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,193
She's suffering from mental exhaustion.

263
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:46,098
And her drinking doesn't help her any.

264
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:48,865
You did well to send for me.

265
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:51,374
Jess.

266
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:54,778
Now, give Mrs. Archer...

267
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:58,178
...one of those every four hours,
and two at bedtime.

268
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,614
Keep her very quiet and no alcohol.

269
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:04,313
There's not much we can do for her
until she gets some rest.

270
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,290
You needn't come out, Harry.
Jess will see me to the car.

271
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,185
Doctor.

272
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:14,258
About last night...

273
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,632
Oh, that satellite business?

274
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:19,464
Probably overworked imagination.

275
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:22,232
- You think she's having a relapse?
- Mentally?

276
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:23,635
Well, let's hope not.

277
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,074
I'm afraid it'd kill her if she ever
had to go back to that sanitarium.

278
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:29,077
She needs to be near you, Harry.

279
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:32,581
She seems to get a great deal
of consolation from you.

280
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:35,185
Now, be patient with her, my boy.

281
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:38,323
And with the right understanding
on your part...

282
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,324
...I have high hopes
for her eventual recovery.

283
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:46,188
Oh, I'll be in town for a few days.

284
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,697
If you need me, just call.

285
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:01,303
Well, my faithful husband, no less.

286
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:05,215
You finally decided to come home.

287
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,847
What's the matter, Harry?

288
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:11,046
Couldn't you stand
the suspense any longer?

289
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:14,317
Couldn't you wait another minute
for the psychiatrist's verdict?

290
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,087
What did he say, Harry?

291
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:19,956
Does he think I'm crazy too?

292
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:22,964
No one thinks you're crazy, Nancy.

293
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:24,659
How nice.

294
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:27,465
Then you believe me.
You believe I saw the satellite.

295
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:30,039
It's not the first time
someone has seen a satellite.

296
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,734
Right in the road, with a giant in it?

297
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:35,402
Don't be so condescending, Harry.

298
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,242
I know what you're thinking.

299
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,941
I know why Dr. Cushing was here,
I know who called him.

300
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:42,382
I called him.
He's here for your own good, Nancy.

301
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:46,046
And I know where you spent the night
last night too.

302
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,887
You seem to have a lot of information.

303
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:55,966
Well, I don't like being tailed
in my own home.

304
00:21:56,134 --> 00:22:00,503
Here, your giant friend may come
looking for this.

305
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:03,837
Harry, wait. Where are you going?

306
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:06,974
Ask Jess.

307
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:18,554
Wouldn't you like something to eat?
The doctor said...

308
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:21,022
Oh, Jess, quit mincing around
and leave me alone.

309
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:22,717
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:27,029
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is KRKR-TV.</i>

311
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:29,764
<i>And now, more news of high fliers.</i>

312
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:32,233
<i>Nancy Archer, the former Nancy Fowler...</i>

313
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:36,841
<i>... Heiress to the Fowler millions and owner
of the fabulous Star of India diamond...</i>

314
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:42,379
<i>... Has joined that ever-expanding
international society of satellite-seers.</i>

315
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:45,948
<i>From the Archers' palatial
home-away-from-home comes a report...</i>

316
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:49,952
<i>... That Mrs. Archer has not only been seeing
a sociable satellite...</i>

317
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:51,817
<i>... But its inhabitant as well:</i>

318
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,390
<i>A 30-foot giant.</i>

319
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,553
<i>Was he pink with big ears and tusks?</i>

320
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:00,959
<i>Well, maybe Mrs. Archer...</i>

321
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:04,261
<i>... who has recently been feuding
with her husband, handsome Harry...</i>

322
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:07,496
<i>... Has finally found a man
from out of this world.</i>

323
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:09,937
<i>A man who could love her for herself.</i>

324
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:12,642
<i>Come, come, now, Mrs. Archer.</i>

325
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:17,180
<i>A man can ignore $ 1 million,
but 50?</i>

326
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:21,376
<i>That's too much to ask
even from the man in the moon.</i>

327
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:28,149
What happened?

328
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,059
So I'm crazy? I'm seeing things, am I?

329
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:35,230
Jess, get the car.

330
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,561
I'm going out to the desert
and find that thing.

331
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:39,601
And you're going with me.

332
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:41,767
Well, don't just stand there, go on.

333
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,432
You're being ridiculous, Nancy.
There's nothing out there.

334
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:47,474
You don't believe me.

335
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:49,705
Well, you're wrong. You're all wrong.

336
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,850
You're drunk, Nancy.
Why don't you try to sleep it off?

337
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:55,885
Not until I've proved it to myself
and to you.

338
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:58,522
We'll drive on the side roads.

339
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:03,557
I have a strange feeling it's out there
somewhere waiting for me.

340
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:05,458
I'm certain of it.

341
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,427
And if it isn't?

342
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:13,665
Then I'm crazy
and should be committed.

343
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:18,005
The car's out in front, ma'am.

344
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:23,739
Jess, get the revolver.

345
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,641
What's the gun for?

346
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:27,682
We're going hunting, remember?

347
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:29,548
Let's go.

348
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:32,280
Nothing.

349
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:34,851
Just sand and space.

350
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,544
Well, seen enough?

351
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,819
Keep driving.

352
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:58,867
There. Stop the car, Harry, there it is.

353
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:00,939
I don't see a thing.

354
00:26:01,113 --> 00:26:03,581
I saw it flash behind those hills.

355
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:07,648
All right, all right, I'll turn around.

356
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:10,584
Hurry.

357
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:34,006
Well, now we've combed
all through these hills.

358
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:35,806
You saw it.

359
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:38,313
There's nothing out here.

360
00:26:39,117 --> 00:26:41,085
Just emptiness.

361
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:47,620
Well, shall we drive on a little further?

362
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,992
I'm sorry, Harry.

363
00:26:51,163 --> 00:26:52,824
I'm sorry.

364
00:27:05,744 --> 00:27:08,713
That's it. I did see it.

365
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:10,945
I told you. I told you!

366
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:13,482
I was right. I was right. It's real.

367
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:14,983
- It's real!
- Nancy.

368
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,717
Nancy, come back here.

369
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:18,355
Come back here.

370
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:21,117
Let's get out of here. Nancy.

371
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:25,162
It's real. It's real.

372
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,890
- Nancy, get away from it.
- I'm not crazy. I did see it.

373
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:29,397
- It's a satellite.
- Come here.

374
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:32,435
- Harry, touch it. I did see it.
- Nancy, come here.

375
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:43,147
Hurry, Harry!

376
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:45,180
Harry, help me!

377
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,217
Harry! Help me!

378
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:52,590
Help me, Harry!

379
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:55,624
Harry, help me!

380
00:27:57,896 --> 00:27:58,885
Harry!

381
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,161
What have you done with Mrs. Archer?

382
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,456
Get out of my way.

383
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:40,200
You're not leaving this room
until you tell me what happened to her.

384
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,773
You aren't gonna get away with it.

385
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:38,326
Give me the sheriff's office.

386
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:53,702
Get dressed and packed, quick.

387
00:29:53,878 --> 00:29:55,106
What's the matter?

388
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,044
No time for questions and answers now.

389
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:00,241
Here, we're getting out of here.

390
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:03,251
What did you do?
Rob the First National Bank?

391
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:06,254
Shut up and get moving. Come on.

392
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:09,359
All right, all right.

393
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:13,190
Nobody wants to get out of this dump
worse than I do.

394
00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:24,801
Hey. Those are the only clothes I've got.

395
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:31,343
You finished yet?

396
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:34,979
You just got here.

397
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:41,556
If you saw what I saw, you'd have
jumped out of your skin to get moving.

398
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:43,626
Here, zip me.

399
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:48,632
- Come on, come on, come on.
- All right, all right.

400
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,928
- Where we going?
- Out of here, but fast.

401
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,197
You going some place?

402
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:58,006
Miss Parker is leaving town.

403
00:30:58,176 --> 00:30:59,643
It's kind of sudden, ain't it?

404
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:02,575
The night clerk here
didn't know anything about it.

405
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:05,116
Well, she... She does now.

406
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:09,117
I'm sorry, Mr. Archer, but Sheriff Dubbitt
wants to see you in his office.

407
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:11,152
The both of you.

408
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,090
You're making a mistake, Charlie.

409
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:17,054
Let's go.

410
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,573
Let me see, now. You got three sixes...

411
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:35,406
...you got the queen of hearts,
that's the heart run...

412
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,673
...so safest card in the deck.

413
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,650
Hey, what do you want that card for?

414
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,446
And that's a gin.

415
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,952
I don't wanna play anymore.

416
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:47,985
Getting daylight already.

417
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:52,692
The chief's always worrying
about the taxpayers' money.

418
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,927
Yeah? Oh, hi, Mary.

419
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,501
No, darling,
I wasn't dancing at Tony's Club.

420
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:03,732
I was out picking up a couple of guests
for the sheriff.

421
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:07,002
Yeah, he's out in the desert now
with a posse looking for the...

422
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:09,237
Oh, they did, huh?

423
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:11,610
On the pool house?

424
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:13,842
What do you know about that?

425
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:17,181
Yeah. They found Mrs. Archer.

426
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:19,647
I don't know how she got there.

427
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:22,418
Hey, maybe by a helicopter, huh?

428
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:26,254
Yeah, all right, Mary.
Will you take any messages that come in?

429
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:29,662
Yeah, we're on our way right now.
Yeah. Bye, sweetie.

430
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:32,098
We'll take your wife's Imperial, right?

431
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,737
Yeah, right.

432
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:38,274
Imagine your wife was home all the time
on top of the pool house, loaded.

433
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,480
How serious is it, Dr. Cushing?

434
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:56,957
Too early to tell. But we should get her to
a hospital as soon as she's strong enough.

435
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:59,824
Those hours of exposure on the roof
didn't help any.

436
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,590
Especially the way she was dressed.

437
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:05,497
It's not the exposure that worries me,
it's those scratches on her throat.

438
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,399
That's Mr. Archer now.

439
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:09,898
And Honey.

440
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:11,632
I never would have thought it.

441
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:14,744
Better let me do the talking, Dr. Cushing.

442
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:22,048
What's wrong with Nancy?
What happened?

443
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,984
I'll ask the questions, Mr. Archer.

444
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,782
- Now, suppose you tell me what happened.
- I'm in no mood for games, sheriff.

445
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,690
I wouldn't go up there
if I were you, Harry.

446
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:34,525
There's some possibility
she may have been contaminated.

447
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:37,634
There's evidence
of some kind of radiation.

448
00:33:41,005 --> 00:33:43,098
Of course, we can't be sure.

449
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,944
Now, tell me what happened out there,
Mr. Archer.

450
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:53,083
- Out where?
- Jess told us.

451
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:57,347
You drove Mrs. Archer out
into the desert last night with his gun.

452
00:33:57,522 --> 00:33:59,456
You came back alone.

453
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:02,252
Now, what happened to Mrs. Archer...

454
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:04,827
...and what happened
to the diamond she was wearing?

455
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:07,965
He's lying. I left the house alone.
Right after you, Dr. Cushing.

456
00:34:08,132 --> 00:34:11,795
That's right.
Harry was with me all evening.

457
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,564
We were stepping out for air
when your deputy stopped us.

458
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,207
Dr. Cushing, it's time
for that injection you ordered.

459
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:20,401
Thank you, nurse, thank you.
I wouldn't have believed it, Harry.

460
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:22,739
I'm very disappointed.

461
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:26,179
- There seems to be a difference...
- Be careful with that, nurse.

462
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:28,911
Exactly 0.75 cc.

463
00:34:29,354 --> 00:34:30,844
One way or another.

464
00:34:31,022 --> 00:34:34,788
When Mrs. Archer regains consciousness,
she'll corroborate me, Sheriff Dubbitt.

465
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,790
Well, where does that leave us?

466
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:38,724
Nowhere.

467
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:42,061
Just don't try to leave town for a while.

468
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,231
And that means you too, Miss Parker.

469
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:47,530
We have nothing to hide.
We'll be around.

470
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,505
Come on, Honey.
I'll drive you back into town.

471
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:53,666
According to Jess...

472
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:56,837
...Mr. Archer drove his wife
out into the desert last night...

473
00:34:57,015 --> 00:34:58,243
...and came home alone.

474
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:01,476
One thing you can be certain about,
Jess is absolutely trustworthy.

475
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:03,883
He's been with Nancy
since she was a little girl.

476
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:05,818
I know he's telling the truth.

477
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:18,802
What's the matter?

478
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,939
Our necks are way out
if Nancy comes to and talks.

479
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:25,974
There is a way out
if you've got the nerve.

480
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:27,736
Try me.

481
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:32,915
The serum that private nurse is using
in her hypodermic needle, I...

482
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:37,111
I heard the doctor tell her
that an overdose would be fatal.

483
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:40,987
Money certainly brings out
the best in you, doesn't it?

484
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,589
Have you got the nerve?

485
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:46,855
Read the morning papers.

486
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,700
Slide over and drive to town.

487
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,631
I've got things to do.

488
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:52,919
Doctor. Doctor Cushing.

489
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,024
Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.

490
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:03,996
- Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.
- Astounding growth.

491
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:26,451
Meat hooks.

492
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:30,826
- Four lengths of chain.
- The chains you were expecting are here.

493
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:33,395
Good. I'll tell Dr. Loeb at once.

494
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:38,195
Meat hooks, four lengths of chain...

495
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:41,031
...40 gallons of plasma...

496
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,964
...and an elephant syringe?

497
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:49,470
The chains are here.

498
00:38:50,615 --> 00:38:53,516
Well, Heinrich, what do you make of it?

499
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:55,714
Fantastic.

500
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,821
I've made every test in the book.

501
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:00,321
There's no diagnosis.

502
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,293
Look at this slide.

503
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:06,529
Dermal connective tissue.

504
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:08,025
Filaria?

505
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:11,566
If only it were filaria.
We'd have something to go on.

506
00:39:11,736 --> 00:39:12,930
A beginning.

507
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:15,072
There's not even
streptococcal infection...

508
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,901
...to incite the inflammation
of the lymph channels.

509
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:19,838
What could it be?

510
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:21,740
I don't know.

511
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:24,279
I just don't know.

512
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:29,151
We may find our answer
when we operate.

513
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,948
Giantism can result
from an overactive forward lobe...

514
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:34,057
...of the pituitary fossa, as you know.

515
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:36,989
Then you think surgery is indicated?

516
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:39,927
Except for that one thing.

517
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:45,159
The blue-green color
around the scratches at her throat.

518
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:47,566
I would venture to say...

519
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:50,901
...it is some sort of radiation...

520
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,077
...which we in medicine
have never touched upon.

521
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:58,477
Fortunately, the dose she received
was not deadly.

522
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:00,310
Then you... You feel there is hope.

523
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:03,283
With surgery? Yes.

524
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:07,789
We'll have to have the husband's
permission to operate, of course.

525
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,926
There is always hope
as long as there is faith, Raymond.

526
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:23,873
I almost gave you up, baby.

527
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:30,603
I've been reading the papers.

528
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:33,306
I told you what happened on the phone.

529
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:38,684
We've got problems again.

530
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:42,420
That new doctor, Von Loeb,
thinks he can help her.

531
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:46,254
Bring me a drink, will you?

532
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:54,471
What's the matter?
Your conscience bothering you, Harry?

533
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:00,472
You know, the trouble with us is
we've both got the same disease.

534
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:02,378
Money.

535
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:07,073
And happy ways of spending it.

536
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:11,387
I've missed you.

537
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,117
Has she talked yet?

538
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,815
She's still in a coma.

539
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:18,826
They're looking for me now
to give them permission to operate.

540
00:41:18,996 --> 00:41:21,294
That's great. That's wonderful.

541
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:25,663
You just hide out
and let her blow up like a balloon.

542
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:31,040
You can pull now, Heinrich.

543
00:41:34,712 --> 00:41:36,407
Steady.

544
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,597
Give me a boost, Charlie.

545
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,371
- Nothing.
- Yeah, I could see that from here.

546
00:42:10,548 --> 00:42:12,277
Almost.

547
00:42:13,684 --> 00:42:16,016
There's a ladder over there.

548
00:42:26,163 --> 00:42:27,892
Charlie.

549
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,237
- What is it?
- I don't know.

550
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:39,103
But whatever it is,
it wasn't made by a Japanese gardener.

551
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:42,268
Go get Jess.
Tell him to get down here pronto.

552
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,279
Excuse me.

553
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:53,015
Jess. Sheriff Dubbitt wants to see you.

554
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:55,154
Right away.

555
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:04,694
I thought you two might like a cool...

556
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:08,938
Did you ever see anything like this
around here before, Jess?

557
00:43:09,106 --> 00:43:10,971
A giant footprint.

558
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:15,107
Maybe Mrs. Archer wasn't so...

559
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:17,611
I've been thinking the same thing myself.

560
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:20,113
Hey, look.
There's another one over there.

561
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:27,457
- Hey, look. There's another one.
- Charlie.

562
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:32,855
We've got to keep quiet about this thing
or everybody will think we're nuts.

563
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:36,894
Be dark in a half-hour.
We'll follow these, see where they lead.

564
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:39,035
- We will?
- Mrs. Archer has a station wagon.

565
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:42,366
Good. Run my car into town
and get the riot gun, Charlie.

566
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,566
Bring a couple of grenades
and some tear gas and flashlights too.

567
00:43:45,743 --> 00:43:48,837
- Tear gas? Grenades?
- We'll leave as soon as you get back.

568
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:51,345
You better plan
on being up all night tonight.

569
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:55,110
We've gotta have somebody in the office
in case Jess and I wanna get in touch.

570
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:58,346
Sure. You know,
I'd like to go with you, chief.

571
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,054
There will be no charge for overtime.

572
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,828
Come on, Jess.
There's still some daylight left.

573
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:11,194
Let's follow these things.

574
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:13,700
Excuse me, chief.

575
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:51,970
Bring it up.

576
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:34,379
Amazing.

577
00:45:36,387 --> 00:45:37,615
Here.

578
00:45:37,788 --> 00:45:40,086
We'd better walk the rest of the way.

579
00:45:40,257 --> 00:45:43,055
There's a radio phone in the car.
Shouldn't we call for help?

580
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:47,220
No use yelling for outside interference
until we see what we got.

581
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:53,761
Harry must have brought her out here
and left her.

582
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:55,965
And then this...

583
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,837
This giant must have taken her home
and put her on the pool-house roof.

584
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,875
Amazing.

585
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:03,912
Look.

586
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:09,381
My gun.

587
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:12,989
He emptied it before he ran.

588
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:15,321
At what?

589
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:56,325
Over here.

590
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:22,374
Look.

591
00:48:25,756 --> 00:48:28,316
The Star of India.

592
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:30,585
Mrs. Archer was right.

593
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:32,888
The thing was after her diamond.

594
00:48:33,063 --> 00:48:35,531
Diamonds everywhere. Different colors.

595
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,929
Must be used to power this thing
in some way.

596
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:41,070
Let's take this one and get out of here.

597
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:57,996
Charlie. Charlie.

598
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,767
The radio's shot too.

599
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:02,173
We might as well start walking.

600
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,612
We'll come back for all this stuff later.

601
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,050
It's gonna be a long walk.

602
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:26,194
I've known Nancy since she was born.

603
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,497
In those days, she was a beautiful child.

604
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:32,768
Fresh, young, full of the joys of life.

605
00:51:32,943 --> 00:51:38,108
But in the last few years, after her marriage,
she changed.

606
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:43,408
Her health seemed to rise and fall
with the tide of her emotions.

607
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:45,487
A very sad case.

608
00:51:45,656 --> 00:51:50,059
A case not infrequent
in this supersonic age we live in.

609
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:59,200
I'm afraid I was unwise in advising her
to take Harry back after they'd separated.

610
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:01,764
Who knows, my friend?

611
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:04,806
When women reach the age of maturity...

612
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:08,172
...Mother Nature sometimes
overworks their frustration...

613
00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:11,212
...to a point of irrationalism.

614
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:15,442
Like the middle-aged man of our age...

615
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:19,487
...who finds himself looking longingly...

616
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:22,614
...at a girl in her early 20s.

617
00:52:24,594 --> 00:52:25,993
Harry!

618
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,327
What was that?

619
00:52:28,498 --> 00:52:30,591
Harry!

620
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:33,499
Harry.

621
00:52:34,104 --> 00:52:35,628
I'll get Dr. Cushing.

622
00:52:35,806 --> 00:52:38,707
Harry. I want him here.

623
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,776
Nancy, Nancy, calm yourself. Morphine.

624
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:44,106
Harry's asleep in his room.
He'll be right here.

625
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:47,842
- Harry!
- Call the sheriff.

626
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,354
Harry.

627
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:54,547
Harry!

628
00:52:56,993 --> 00:52:58,483
Sheriff's office, please.

629
00:52:58,662 --> 00:53:00,459
And hurry, operator, it's urgent.

630
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,690
- Harry.
- Hello. Sheriff Dubbitt.

631
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:05,391
Have you found Mr. Archer yet?

632
00:53:05,569 --> 00:53:08,663
No, ma'am,
but I left messages everywhere in town.

633
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:10,397
Oh, she did, huh?

634
00:53:10,574 --> 00:53:12,007
She is?

635
00:53:12,175 --> 00:53:14,939
Yes, ma'am, I know it's an emergency.

636
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:17,273
All right, I will, right away.

637
00:53:21,384 --> 00:53:25,582
Hi, Mary. I'm going over to Tony's Club
and then I'm heading out to the Archers'.

638
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:28,884
If Sheriff Dubbitt calls in,
tell him he'd better get out there too.

639
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:31,186
Thank you, baby. Bye.

640
00:54:00,023 --> 00:54:02,457
No, there's no cutting in here
at Tony's Club, buddy.

641
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:05,652
- Mr. Archer.
- Why, it's the deputy.

642
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:07,421
What can we do for you this time?

643
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:09,861
Your house has been trying
to get you all evening.

644
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:12,365
- Didn't the bartender give you my message?
- He did.

645
00:54:12,536 --> 00:54:16,063
And now you've delivered it in person.
Anything else?

646
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:17,365
No...

647
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:21,534
Well, yes, there is.
They say it's important. An emergency.

648
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:25,408
Well, thanks.

649
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:27,878
All right.

650
00:54:29,352 --> 00:54:31,616
Let's see, now. Where were we, huh?

651
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:35,253
- Here.
- Oh, yeah.

652
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:38,152
Never should have kept this
out of the papers.

653
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:40,888
The poor girl, she's had
so much publicity all her life.

654
00:54:41,064 --> 00:54:44,625
I'm afraid now there's no alternative.
We'll have to notify the authorities.

655
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:48,737
If you hadn't given her that sedative, there's
no telling what would have happened.

656
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:52,739
Well, thank heaven
we got the chains on her arms and legs.

657
00:54:52,909 --> 00:54:56,902
- How long will the morphine be effective?
- No telling, with the size of her body.

658
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,413
But we'll have to keep her under sedation
until the state police arrive.

659
00:55:00,584 --> 00:55:03,553
I'll phone the authorities at Baker.

660
00:55:05,689 --> 00:55:07,418
Operator.

661
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:10,925
Doctor! Dr. Cushing, it's her.
She's come to again.

662
00:55:11,094 --> 00:55:15,121
- Dr. Cushing!
- Hither, nurse. More morphine.

663
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:20,201
<i>Operator. Operator. Operator.
This is Mary, your operator.</i>

664
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,668
<i>What's going on there?
What's happening?</i>

665
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:25,774
Hurry with that morphine, Cushing.

666
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:30,509
She's loose.

667
00:55:31,314 --> 00:55:32,975
She'll tear the roof off.

668
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,058
Operator. Operator.

669
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:52,030
It's dead.

670
00:55:57,908 --> 00:56:00,069
I know where my husband is.

671
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:02,939
He's with that woman.

672
00:56:04,915 --> 00:56:06,780
I'll find him.

673
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,941
She's loose.

674
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,215
A tank couldn't have done a better job.

675
00:56:16,393 --> 00:56:18,156
She... She's heading for town.

676
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,941
Hi, chief. I was just on my way over
to the Archers'.

677
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,772
I think Mrs. Archer finally came to.

678
00:56:36,947 --> 00:56:39,142
Say, they've been
asking for you over there.

679
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:42,251
- Did you find anything out there?
- Get moving, will you?

680
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:45,047
Yeah, sure, sure, hop in.

681
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:47,985
Say, where's the station wagon, chief?

682
00:57:09,112 --> 00:57:11,672
Doctor. Doctor,
give us a hand with the door.

683
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:14,408
Here's the sheriff's car.

684
00:57:19,823 --> 00:57:22,223
Holy Toledo. What happened?

685
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:25,293
Thank heaven you're here.
It's Mrs. Archer. She's on a rampage.

686
00:57:25,462 --> 00:57:27,987
- We've got to warn the town.
- She's grown into a giant.

687
00:57:28,164 --> 00:57:30,860
Never mind. Get into the car.
We'll explain as we go along.

688
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:32,934
Drive to town.

689
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:42,276
Uranium.

690
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:47,582
This is just make-believe.
A lot of junk to sell to the people.

691
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:52,051
It ain't like the old days when
we could go out prospecting for gold...

692
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:55,453
...with a sluice box and water.

693
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:02,957
I can see it now.

694
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:15,107
Come on, Hazel. Come on.

695
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:31,121
Hey, hey, hey, Tony.
Something's happened to your lights.

696
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:33,023
I got eyes. I can see.

697
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:36,654
- Who needs lights?
- Well, I need another drink.

698
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:41,827
- Hey, Ton. Tony.
- Oh, you're a good fellow, Tony.

699
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:44,166
Attaboy, Ton.

700
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:48,071
- Mellow, mellow...
- Happy birthday, Honey.

701
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:53,341
Well, wouldn't you know it.

702
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,385
Can't you drive any faster?

703
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:10,482
What happened?

704
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,525
Was it a giant woman?

705
01:00:12,695 --> 01:00:15,664
- Going toward town?
- Let's hurry.

706
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,416
Harry.

707
01:01:03,313 --> 01:01:05,713
She'll tear up the whole town
until she finds Harry.

708
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:08,407
Yeah, then she'll tear up Harry.

709
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,460
See if you can locate him
and put him in the police car.

710
01:01:26,636 --> 01:01:30,037
We'll try and draw her off.
I'll call Baker for help.

711
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,239
Come on, let's get out of here.

712
01:01:44,053 --> 01:01:46,180
Let's get the sheriff.

713
01:01:50,793 --> 01:01:54,126
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Harry!

714
01:01:54,297 --> 01:01:56,595
It sounds like someone's
calling your name.

715
01:01:56,766 --> 01:01:58,393
Harry!

716
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:00,297
Harry!

717
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,064
It's your wife.
She's wrecking the town looking for you.

718
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:05,434
- Come on, I gotta get you out of here.
- No.

719
01:02:05,608 --> 01:02:09,066
If she sees me out there, she'll kill me.
She's crazy.

720
01:02:09,245 --> 01:02:12,271
Come on, Mr. Archer,
we gotta get out of here.

721
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:17,618
You're a deputy. Do something.

722
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:20,421
I can't shoot a lady.

723
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:23,582
Give me the gun. Give me that gun.

724
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:40,075
No. No, no, Mrs. Archer.

725
01:02:57,593 --> 01:03:00,391
Help me move this beam, Charlie.

726
01:03:02,398 --> 01:03:04,423
She's dead.

727
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:08,764
No. No, Nancy. Nancy.

728
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:12,663
No! Nancy.

729
01:03:13,176 --> 01:03:14,803
Nancy. Nancy, no.

730
01:03:14,977 --> 01:03:17,070
Nancy, no.

731
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:18,611
Nancy, don't.

732
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:20,271
Oh, no.

733
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:23,385
- Don't, Nancy. You killed Honey.
- No.

734
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:25,885
Nancy, no. Put me down.

735
01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:28,615
You killed Honey. Nancy, no.

736
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:30,258
Nancy, no. No.

737
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:33,520
You're crushing me. I can't breathe.

738
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:37,696
Hurry. Hurry.

739
01:03:37,867 --> 01:03:40,392
She's got Harry. She's got Harry.

740
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:44,001
- Why doesn't the sheriff do something?
- She's squeezing him to death.

741
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:47,199
Put him down, Mrs. Archer.

742
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:09,397
Sheriff, you're not gonna
use that on her.

743
01:04:09,565 --> 01:04:12,762
What do you want me to do?
Put salt on her tail?

744
01:04:34,023 --> 01:04:35,422
She's down.

745
01:04:35,591 --> 01:04:37,422
Let's take a look.

746
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:39,288
Let's go.

747
01:04:55,278 --> 01:04:59,078
All right, everybody keep back now.
Come on. Stand back there.

748
01:05:11,527 --> 01:05:14,963
She finally got Harry all to herself.
