1
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:22,220
<i>? Through early morning fog I see</i>

2
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:26,632
<i>? Visions of the things to be</i>

3
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:30,807
<i>? The pains that are withheld for me</i>

4
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:37,695
<i>? I realise and I can see</i>

5
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:41,314
<i>? That suicide is painless</i>

6
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:45,866
<i>? It brings on many changes</i>

7
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:53,164
<i>? And I can take or leave it if I please</i>

8
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:58,671
<i>? The game of life is hard to play</i>

9
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:03,093
<i>? I'm gonna lose it anyway</i>

10
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:06,846
<i>? The losing card I'll someday lay</i>

11
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:14,686
<i>? So this is all I have to say</i>

12
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:18,110
<i>? Suicide is painless</i>

13
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:19,276
<i>? Suicide</i>

14
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,737
<i>? It brings on many changes</i>

15
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:22,905
<i>? Changes</i>

16
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:31,417
<i>? And I can take or leave it if I please</i>

17
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:35,417
<i>? The sword of time will pierce our skins</i>

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,673
<i>? It doesn't hurt when it begins</i>

19
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:43,927
<i>? But as it works its way on in</i>

20
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:51,643
<i>? The pain grows stronger, watch it grin</i>

21
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:54,401
<i>? Suicide is painless</i>

22
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:58,485
<i>? It brings on many changes</i>

23
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:07,783
<i>? And I can take or leave it if I please</i>

24
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:11,871
<i>? A brave man once requested me</i>

25
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:15,911
<i>? To answer questions that are key</i>

26
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:20,625
<i>? Is it to be or not to be?</i>

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,135
<i>? And I replied "Oh, why ask me?"</i>

28
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,933
<i>? Suicide is painless</i>

29
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:35,149
<i>? It brings on many changes</i>

30
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:42,943
<i>? And I can take or leave it if I please</i>

31
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:50,531
<i>? And you can do the same thing</i>

32
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:56,879
<i>? If you please</i>

33
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:09,098
- Radar!
- Yes, sir.

34
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,263
- Call Major Burns.
- I'll call Major Burns.

35
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,559
Tell him we need to hold
two surgeons over from the day shift.

36
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,151
- I'll call General Hammond.
- Tell Hammond we need two new surgeons.

37
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:21,275
I hope he sends us those
two new surgeons. We sure need 'em.

38
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,739
- What, sir?
- I gave everything to Radar.

39
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,286
What?

40
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,781
- What the hell d'you think you're doing?
- What? I'm...

41
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:50,910
Just because you're a captain,
don't think you run the joint.

42
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,662
I run it.

43
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:55,541
- I'm supposed to...
- I know what you're supposed to do.

44
00:04:55,631 --> 00:05:00,009
Your driver will be with you shortly.
He's having his coffee now.

45
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:08,510
- Racist.
- <i>Attention.</i>

46
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:12,138
<i>The following men</i>
<i>report to the departure area:</i>

47
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:18,650
<i>Carey, Michael S.</i>
<i>Phelps, Robert A. Colbert.</i>

48
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:23,068
<i>Cleaver, Herschell B.</i>
<i>Roosevelt, Charles B.</i>

49
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,782
- Goodbye, ladies. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

50
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:31,793
<i>Govowska, Theodore G.</i>
<i>Miller...</i>

51
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:35,412
- 4077th MASH?
- This is the jeep here.

52
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:38,458
All right.

53
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,129
OK, let's go, boy.

54
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,216
Get my other bag.

55
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,760
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

56
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:16,579
Schermerhorn! Get that son of a bitch!
He just stole my jeep.

57
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:20,336
Hey! Watch what
the hell you're doin', will ya?

58
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:24,486
There you are, sir. The officers' mess.
Perhaps you would like to take a small <i>repas.</i>

59
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,994
I couldn't eat after that ride you gave me.
You want any of this?

60
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,454
No, thank you, but I could do with my lunch.

61
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:34,126
Well, why don't you come on in
with me and get a sandwich?

62
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,289
I'll follow you anywhere, sir.

63
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:47,508
Oh! How about that piece of scenery,
Yankee, huh?

64
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,678
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,581
Who are those men?
Friends of yours, Murrhardt?

66
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:13,451
- No, sir. First time I've seen them.
- Maybe those are the replacements.

67
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:17,591
Oh, don't be silly.
We're expecting some really sharp surgeons.

68
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:22,717
I guess they just got separated from their unit
and are looking for something to eat.

69
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:26,590
They've got a hell of a nerve
coming in here eating our food.

70
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,145
Pardon me. Would you move over
just a little bit. Thank you. Ooh!

71
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,693
Be careful with that.

72
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:39,028
- But she's got to use Phisohex...
- I think I'm in love.

73
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:43,741
...that Phisohex soap on her face.
She really has a bad complexion.

74
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:47,113
- But when she's got a bad complexion...
- She won't use soap.

75
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:51,074
Well, the truth is, Lieutenant,
I don't have anything to do tonight.

76
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:57,088
I just got into town and, well, I thought
maybe you could show me around.

77
00:08:57,175 --> 00:09:03,011
Captain, if you'll notice the lieutenant's
beautiful hand, she is definitely married.

78
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:06,383
I'm the commanding officer
and I'll get to the bottom of this.

79
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:10,141
Boy, Bandini, they're eating here
because they <i>want</i> to.

80
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:18,438
- You men just passing through?
- I was just enjoying that lovely dish there.

81
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,860
Captain, you are speaking about
a lieutenant in the United States Army.

82
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:24,909
I'm Colonel Blake.

83
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:28,945
Oh, Colonel.
I'm Duke Forrest, your new cutter.

84
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,660
- That's my driver over here.
- Captain Hawkeye Pierce.

85
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:34,713
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

86
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:37,751
- Good afternoon, Lieutenant Dish.
- Captain Hawkeye.

87
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:42,718
Captain Hawkeye Pierce, I had a TWX about
you. Seems you stole ajeep at headquarters.

88
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:46,222
No, no, sir. No, I didn't steal ajeep.
No, it's right outside.

89
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,053
Oh, so it is.

90
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:54,432
Captain, when you report to your new duty
station, you go to your commanding officer.

91
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,815
Captain... Pierce, is it?

92
00:09:56,904 --> 00:10:02,325
- Captain Pierce and me have been boozing...
- Good. Been working close to the front.

93
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:07,202
We have slack periods, but when the action
starts you'll get more work in 12 hours...

94
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:09,662
- How many nurses on the base, sir?
- 17.

95
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,410
- How many on my...
- Four.

96
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:14,705
...than a civilian surgeon in a month.
- I'd like her as my nurse.

97
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,668
- It could be arranged.
- And the young girl, the blonde.

98
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,088
Father Mulcahy. I'd like you to meet
Captain Pierce, our new surgeon.

99
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,181
This is the Catholic chaplain.
Here's Captain Forrest.

100
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,642
- Dago Red.
- Dago Red!

101
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,095
- Captain Waldowski, our dental officer.
- Known as Painless Pole.

102
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:33,640
- Captain Black, our anaesthesiologist.
- I'm the dentist.

103
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,854
- John Black. I'll be passing gas for you.
- Duke? Welcome.

104
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:41,157
- Captain Bandini here.
- Thank you. How are you?

105
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:45,654
- If you boys have any problems, my tent...
- Bandini here. Duke, glad to meet you.

106
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,747
I was saying if you have any problems,
my tent is...

107
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,581
- Radar! Oh.
- I'm Corporal O'Reilly. They call me Radar.

108
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,122
- You'll stay in Major Burns' tent.
- Take them to Major Burns' tent.

109
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:58,504
And I'll change the numbers on the jeep.

110
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:00,716
Oh, and change the numbers on thatjeep.

111
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:15,479
Corporal O'Reilly, you're not billeting these
enlisted men in the officers' area, are you?

112
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,154
Oh, excuse me.

113
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:26,613
I'm working for my blind brother
who can't afford the trip to Korea.

114
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:30,655
- Unhand me, sir.
- Hey, Duke Forrest.

115
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,462
Now, that one's mine.

116
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:51,351
- Hi, fellas.
- Who? That one?

117
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,765
- Yeah.
- Who told you that?

118
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:57,524
- How do you know that?
- "Though I walk through the valley

119
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:00,567
of the shadow of death,

120
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:04,952
I will fear no evil: For thoo art with me."

121
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:07,113
<i>Thou.</i> Thou art with me.

122
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:09,282
- Jesus Christ.
- What's that about?

123
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,044
That's Major Burns, sir. Excuse me.

124
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,587
- New personnel, Major.
- Good.

125
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:20,925
- Hiya. Hawkeye Pierce.
- How do you do?

126
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:23,384
- Duke Forrest.
- Frank Burns.

127
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:25,964
- How are you?
- Go ahead, Ho-Jon.

128
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:31,186
"My cup runneth over."

129
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:35,899
"Surely goodness and mercy

130
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:39,194
- shall follow..."
- What's this here?

131
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:43,065
Ho-Jon, one of our mess-hall boys.
I'm teaching him how to read.

132
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,071
Is that right?
Reading the Bible, huh? That's nice.

133
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:51,285
Listen, I got a book here
that's got a lot of pictures in it.

134
00:12:51,377 --> 00:12:56,882
I think it's easier to learn how to read
when you look at pictures. A little adventure.

135
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:59,753
- May I leave now, Major?
- Sure, Ho-Jon.

136
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:02,095
You have fun.

137
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:09,053
There it is. Suture, Mary.

138
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:14,598
- What sutures are these?
- I can't see what the hell I'm doing.

139
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,561
- Scorch, I need some more sponge clamps.
- OK. Just a minute, Les.

140
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:22,274
Give me some big hunks of sponge,
for cryin' out loud.

141
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,412
- Also some big sponges. Use these.
- That's bleedin'. That's gotta come out.

142
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:29,617
I can't stop that bleedin' down there.

143
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,166
- What's so funny?
- Nothing, sir. Not a thing.

144
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:38,004
- Is that true what I hear about you?
- Duke, back to the kidney. Come on.

145
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:40,085
- Oh, yeah.
- He's cute.

146
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,467
Give me a clamp. Give me a clamp.

147
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:47,177
- Here we go.
- Captain Pierce, did you call me?

148
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,510
No, and my name's Hawkeye.
Give me the saw.

149
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:53,353
I can't really see.
It's like the Mississippi River down there.

150
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:56,941
Doesn't feel like it's in one piece.
I think it's gotta come out.

151
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:59,771
Get in. Get in there.

152
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:03,068
And give me some more
of that gauze wrapped up there.

153
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:13,868
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

154
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,165
Nurse, you got a clamp, please?

155
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,553
Scratch my nose. Just on the tip.

156
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,261
There. A little harder, please.

157
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:28,428
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

158
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,182
<i>All noncommissioned... Attention. Attention.</i>

159
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:37,736
<i>All noncommissioned officers</i>
<i>will report for short-arm inspection at 0400.</i>

160
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:39,897
<i>That is all.</i>

161
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:45,204
- What's that?
- That's a martini, Frank.

162
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:50,163
Finest kind. We're trainin' Ho-Jon to be
a bartender. Would you care to imbibe, sir?

163
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,828
I don't drink.

164
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,078
Jesus Christ, I think he means it.

165
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:57,256
- I think we've been had, Hawkeye.
- I think you're right.

166
00:14:57,342 --> 00:15:01,007
I don't think it's right to involve a boy
who's not 17 years old yet.

167
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,468
- You go to sleep now?
- Yeah.

168
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:05,430
- I go wash clothes.
- OK.

169
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:10,262
You make a mean martini there, Ho-Jon.
You keep it up, you hear?

170
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:21,485
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

171
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:24,778
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

172
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:31,454
- You ever catch this syndrome before, babe?
- Not with anyone beyond the age of eight.

173
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:35,209
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

174
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:40,126
For thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

175
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,963
- Amen.
- Amen.

176
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:49,269
God, protect our men on the field of battle,
that they may return home to their dear ones.

177
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:53,222
And, dear God, protect
our supreme commander on the field

178
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:56,021
and our commander in chief
in Washington DC.

179
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:59,943
Frank, were you on this religious kick
at home or did you crack up over here?

180
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:02,949
Frank, how long does this show go on?

181
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:09,070
It gets longer all the time. Now I have
your soul to pray for and Captain Pierce's.

182
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,998
<i>?</i> Onward, Christian soldiers

183
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:16,587
<i>?</i> Marching as to war

184
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:20,542

194
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,422
- Yeah?
- What's the line-up?

195
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:06,887
Four waiting for surgery, two for the IV
and two for the antibiotics to take over.

196
00:17:06,977 --> 00:17:10,642
We can probably handle that
if there's no more choppers. Pickup.

197
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:15,059
Scissors.

198
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:20,903
- You can't go in the colonel's office.
- That's who we're lookin' for.

199
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:24,989
Henry, you gotta do something.
We have stuck it out for a week. Pretty girl.

200
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,404
Yeah, she kinda grows on you.

201
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:32,456
- What is it, men?
- That sky pilot. Get him out of our tent.

202
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,751
- Your tent?
- Yeah. Get that nurse in there.

203
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,674
She won't keep us awake all night praying.

204
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,884
I've been here a long time. I know what you're
trying to pull, but you won't push me around.

205
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:47,551
Not for the world would I push you around,
but, look, there is one more thing.

206
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:52,436
- We need a chest cutter.
- We need a good one, or there'll be trouble.

207
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:55,727
No MASH unit has a chest surgeon.
We won't get one.

208
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:59,568
Sir, they're behind in the OR
and the pre-op ward is jammed up.

209
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:02,611
<i>The helicopters and ambulances</i>
<i>are coming in full.</i>

210
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,777
<i>You have to work early today.</i>

211
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,497
<i>And add overtime to a 12-hour day?</i>
<i>The union'll raise Cain with you.</i>

212
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:14,826
<i>With those hours, you need rest.</i>
<i>You can't get it with Burns jabbering to God.</i>

213
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:16,832
<i>Burns will go in 24 hours.</i>

214
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:20,294
<i>Tell them Captain Pierce</i>
<i>and Captain Forrest are on the way.</i>

215
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:24,799
- <i>Henry, there's one more thing.</i>
- <i>I told you Major Burns will go in 24 hours.</i>

216
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:26,967
- <i>The chest cutter.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

217
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:30,517
<i>I'll try. You can't ask more than that.</i>

218
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:48,575
My operation was fine.
It's the head wound that did him in.

219
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,165
Dish, get over here and hold this retractor.

220
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:54,958
Dish, let me have a long needle holder.

221
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,888
Dago!

222
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,217
Amen.

223
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:07,637
- Pull it back, Duke.
- Hell, I can't.

224
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:12,140
- Get hold of the other one.
- Dago, I want you to hold this retractor. Now.

225
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:15,479
- Please, come on. Now.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

226
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:18,404
- Hi, Dago.
- Hold on. Don't wiggle it. Just hold on.

227
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,565
Clamp.

228
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:26,078
Sorry, Dago, but this man's still alive
and that other man is dead, and that's a fact.

229
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:29,912
Can you hold it with two fingers, Dago?
Hell, did you see it?

230
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:38,503
- Where's Hawkeye?
- You mean Captain Pierce?

231
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:42,176
- No, I'd have to look at the duty roster.
- They're in there.

232
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,095
- Oh, man.
- Hawkeye, you gotta remember, I'm married.

233
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:51,638
I'm married. I love my wife.
If she was here, I would be with her.

234
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:56,109
There is no question of loving anybody.
It is a question only of helping...

235
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,650
You see, I made a vow to myself

236
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,235
that while I was gone
I was gonna be faithful to my husband.

237
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,872
Those are vows you make
when you're with somebody.

238
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,034
Hawkeye?

239
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,290
- Ho-Jon?
- Duke say you better haul ass home quick.

240
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,217
- We got new chest cutter in our tent.
- OK.

241
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:27,681
<i>This is Radio Tokyo bringing you</i>
<i>musical interlude for your enjoyment.</i>

242
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:10,271
- That's him.
- Hiya. I'm Hawkeye Pierce.

243
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:15,318
Yeah. See? All I can get out of him
is he's from "Bahston"

244
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:17,691
and he's been in the army two months.

245
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,271
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And that's all.

246
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:41,095
Well, listen... where were you
when you were drafted?

247
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,504
I was just curious.

248
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:48,676
Back home. I told you before.

249
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,978
No, I mean, what were you doin'? Were you
like a resident or on staff some place?

250
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:58,608
Where?

251
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:00,606
Hospital.

252
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,775
Which hospital?

253
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,528
Back home.

254
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,193
Some reason
I shouldn't know which hospital?

255
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,366
I don't know. I will ask.

256
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,705
Is there some reason my friend
should not know the name of the hospital?

257
00:22:15,923 --> 00:22:19,968
There doesn't appear to be any reason.
I've seen you somewhere before.

258
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:23,801
I don't know your name, stranger,
but your face is familiar.

259
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,057
Have you always had that moustache?

260
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:32,144
Are you a beer drinker,
or would you like to share a martini?

261
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:37,819
- Martini. That would be... I'd love a martini.
- Ho-Jon, give the gentleman a martini.

262
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:42,483
I think you will find these accommodating.
They're quite dry.

263
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:48,622
- Don't you use olives?
- Olives? Where the hell d'you think you are?

264
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:52,788
We do have to make concessions to the war.
We're three miles from the front line.

265
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:58,086
Yes, but a man can't really savour his martini
without an olive, you know.

266
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,177
Otherwise, you see, itjust...

267
00:23:02,972 --> 00:23:05,677
doesn't quite make it.

268
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:12,021
<i>Attention. The Evangelical United</i>
<i>Brethren Church has donated 34 hymnals</i>

269

270

<i>These hymnals are located in the camp library</i>

<i>That is all.</i>

Listen, am I gonna get paid
for giving you guys lessons? Rib cutter.

273
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:32,661
Small bones, huh?

274
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:37,588
- I need a retractor also, nurse.
- Let's get her, baby.

275
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:40,213
What do you think? Can I tie this for you?

276
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:45,389
- You need some suction?
- Yeah, that's fine.

277
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:48,093
Pickups for me, please.

278
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:52,523
- How's he doing, John?
- He's doing well.

279
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:56,522
- A suture.
- Looks like that's it. Looks like that's it.

280
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:01,366
What did you do with our thread?
We're all out.

281
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,023
- More thread and larger needles.
- Let me?

282
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,413
- Let me have another suture.
- You surgeons are all alike.

283
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,916
If this guy knew the clowns
who are operating on him, he'd faint.

284
00:24:13,004 --> 00:24:15,080
- I think he has!
- Nurse, I need a suture.

285
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:17,296
- Coming.
- Keep ahead of him, babe.

286
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:21,713
- We need a couple more stitches in there.
- That's fine, yeah. Thank you.

287
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:26,425
It's a good thing you have a nice body, nurse,
or we'd get rid of you.

288
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:29,009
- Don't stick me.
- Keep it clean.

289
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:33,182
I can tie that for you.

290
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:36,810
Let's have the big stitches
for holding up the chest.

291
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:40,070
- Larger needles, Knocko.
- Now sutures.

292
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:44,359
Start wrapping up. I could use another one.

293
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:47,490
Anybody know if he's an officer
or an enlisted man?

294
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:50,499
- He's an enlisted man.
- Make the stitches big.

295
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:53,954
<i>Attention. Captain Bandi... Captain Bandini...</i>

296
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,376
<i>Attention. Attention. Captain Bandini</i>

<i>poplit, a pop...</i>

298

<i>A palmaral P-O-P-L-l-T-E-R-A-L</i>

299
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:11,013
<i>and possible graft.</i>

300
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:16,230
<i>The following memo has just come through.</i>

301
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,112
<i>Please remove all pictures, postcards,</i>
<i>nude calendars, et cetera from the walls</i>

302
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,447
<i>so that our rooms may look</i>
<i>clean and orderly. That is all.</i>

303
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:30,959
It's you! Did I tell you how Androscoggin
College beat Dartmouth in a blizzard 6-0

304
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,083
- cos I intercepted a pass?
- Yeah.

305
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:37,003
They had this great passer,
and we held 'em 0-0 till the last 20 seconds.

306
00:25:37,091 --> 00:25:41,041
And then snow and all he let one go,
and it went sailing, boom!

307
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:44,720
Lucky your mouth wasn't open
or it would've got stuck in your throat.

308
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:49,766
- How is Trapper John?
- I thought you'd never remember!

309
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:51,931
John Mclntyre, Trapper John.

310
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:55,891
Only man ever found fulfilment in
a Boston Maine Railway in the ladies' can.

311
00:25:55,986 --> 00:26:00,198
Conductor opened the door, the girl
looked out and yelled "He trapped me!"

312
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:03,900
- How are ya?
- I'm great. What's goin' on over there?

313
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:08,075
Well, well, well. Must be
Painless Polish Day in the shower tent.

314
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:09,825
Painless Polish Day?

315
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:13,832
- Walt Waldowski, the dentist.
- Those guys waiting to scrub his back?

316
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:18,085
No. He's what you might call
the best-equipped dentist in the army.

317
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,252
You may call it that.

318
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:27,887
Once in med school, I did an autopsy
on a guy. He would have been drowned.

319
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:30,303
- You an authority on that?
- I heard that one.

320
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:32,970
Extraordinary. A friend had a...

321
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:36,901
Boy, man, I'd surely love to see that angry!

322
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:51,478
Nurse!

323
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:57,320
Boone, get me a cc of adrenaline
and a cardiac needle.

324
00:27:57,404 --> 00:28:00,322
- I'm sorry. A c...?
- Just get it!

325
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:05,028
Pinch a bit?

326
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,374
And you can cut me about a four-inch piece
of wire and about an inch and a half of tape.

327
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:20,629
- Hi.
- Who is it?

328
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,840
It's Trapper. Let's get some of this stuff off.

329
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:26,637
You idiot! I said a cardiac needle.

330
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,848
- You want me to get a nurse?
- It's too late, Boone. You killed him.

331
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:07,092
At ease. This is Major O'Houlihan,
our new chief nurse.

332
00:29:07,185 --> 00:29:09,225
This is where we do the dirty work.

333
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:11,388
- Captain Murrhardt.
- Sponge.

334
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:13,023
- Hi.
- Hi, Captain.

335
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:17,604
Dennis. Don't you remember?
I helped carry your luggage from the airfield.

336
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,614
- Oh, yes. Hello, Dennis.
- Hi.

337
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:23,700
- This is Captain Black.
- Hello, Captain Black.

338
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:27,736
- Hi, I'm Ugly John, your gas passer.
- Oh... Ugly John.

339
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,952
Oh, it's only you, Judson. Captain Sacks.

340
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:35,504
- Captain Sacks. How's the operation going?
- Are you kiddin'?

341
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,666
Scissors.

342
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:43,296
- Oh, and this is Captain Knocko McCarthy.
- Major! Oh, right!

343
00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:47,174
Now I'll show you the rest of the operation,
if you'll excuse the pun.

344
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:53,724
This is the pre-op ward.

345
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:58,775
I'll take these things -
this is the post-op ward - if you don't mind.

346
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:01,533
Oh, Vollmer, take care of these, will you?

347
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,655
- Finished work for the day?
- Yes. Why?

348
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:09,123
Good. Good. I just wanted to make sure
you had time to sleep this off.

349
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:16,714
- Son of a bitch!
- Trapper! Captain Mclntyre! What the hell...?

350
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,635
- That's a captain?
- What's going on? Who started this?

351
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,554
I hit him! He's an ignoramus,
that knucklehead!

352
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:26,090
He wouldn't have touched me
if I'd had my guard up.

353
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:29,351
Let us settle this, Colonel,
between ourselves. Alone!

354
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,679
Think this is an English boarding school?

355
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:35,142
Mclntyre, you're under arrest.
Confine yourself to quarters.

356
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:39,103
- Henry, are you kidding?
- I deeply regret this unfortunate incident.

357
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:41,867
We try to remember
we're a military organisation.

358
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,192
I should certainly hope so.

359
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:48,415
Vollmer, that man is under arrest.
Confine him to his quarters.

360
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:54,621
- Captain Mclntyre, you are officially...
- Come on. Cut it out, Vollmer.

361
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:04,304
<i>Attention, camp compound. Urine specimens</i>
<i>will be required from all pers...</i>

362
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,467
<i>Disregard last transmission.</i>

363
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,477
- Sorry, Colonel.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

364
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:11,223
- Want some coffee?
- Please.

365
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:13,770
- Ho-Jon, some coffee.
- What's wrong with you?

366
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:18,153
I don't know. I must have lost my punch.
I never expected the son of a bitch to get up!

367
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:20,990
- That's no kind of an answer.
- You know why he did it.

368
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:24,491
I can't have my junior officers
striking each other.

369
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:27,496
Dammit, Henry. Frank Burns is a menace!

370
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:32,577
Every time a patient croaks on him he says
it's God's will or somebody else's fault.

371
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,335
This time he blamed it on some kid
who was stupid enough to believe him.

372
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:40,718
I'm tired of you trying to run this outfit.
There's going to be disciplinary action.

373
00:31:40,803 --> 00:31:46,011
- What are you gonna do, Henry?
- I'd planned to name Trapper chief surgeon

374
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:50,051
- to consult on your shift and Frank's.
- That's damn good thinking.

375
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:52,685
But now I can't do it for at least a week.

376
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:58,149
If I announced it now after what our new
chief nurse saw, she'd yell to Washington.

377
00:31:58,238 --> 00:32:00,564
Don't you have any sugar in this place?

378
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:05,367
<i>Good morning. Today's musical</i>
<i>selections will be rendered by</i>

379
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:09,238
<i>Achi Takamura Seamuchiwa Bobcats.</i>

380
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:14,624
Colonel Blake, General Hammond did not
answer the phone. He was at a football game.

381
00:32:14,714 --> 00:32:18,213
- Those generals have all the fun!
- Yes, sir.

382
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:53,418
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>
<i>May I have the camp's attention?</i>

383
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,297
<i>This week's movie will be</i>
<i>"When Willie Comes Marching Home".</i>

384
00:32:58,384 --> 00:33:03,212
<i>The biggest parade</i>
<i>of laughs of World War II.</i>

385
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:08,514
<i>All the loves, laughs and escapades</i>
<i>of the Willies who came marching home.</i>

386
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:13,396
<i>This film stars Dan Dailey,</i>
<i>Corinne Calvet and Colleen Townsend.</i>

387
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,563
Captain Pierce, may I join you?

388
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:21,948
You've already joined me, gorgeous.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

389
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:24,656
Where do you come from?

390
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:27,497
Well, I like to think of the army as my home.

391
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:29,491
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

392
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:33,078
Ho-Jon, bring me some ketchup.

393
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:36,337
- I've been observing the nurses on your shift.
- I know.

394
00:33:36,424 --> 00:33:40,089
<i>Naturally, your own opinion</i>
<i>is more informed than mine.</i>

395
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:43,962
<i>You want to know what I think</i>
<i>of the nurses on my team. I'll tell you.</i>

396
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:48,185
<i>I think they're fine, just great.</i>
<i>I'm totally satisfied with them.</i>

397
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:53,599
- Oh, no, that's the second time this week.
- Of course, what do you expect?

398
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:04,152
Welcome, gentlemen.

399
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:09,492
<i>?</i> When the lights go on again

400
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,205
<i>?</i> All over the world

401
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,371
You got enough room?

402
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,809
- Is he all right, Hawkeye?
- Is he all right, Dago?

403
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:29,265
Yes, you mean is he gonna live?

404
00:34:29,354 --> 00:34:31,762
He'll live.

405
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:36,186
I hope somebody's gonna be around
tomorrow morning when he wakes up

406
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:40,525
to tell him that he hasn't got
anything between his legs any more.

407
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:42,276
Syngman Rhee paid the light bill.

408
00:34:42,368 --> 00:34:46,068
- Major Burns is far from satisfied.
- That doesn't surprise me.

409
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:50,031
Frank Burns does not know
his way around an operating theatre.

410
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:52,202
He does not know his way around a body.

411
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:56,921
And if you'll have observed anything, you'll
have observed that Frank Burns is an idiot.

412
00:34:57,008 --> 00:35:00,591
He has flipped his wig, he is out
of his head, he's a lousy surgeon.

413
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:07,476
On the contrary, I have observed that Major
Burns is not only a good technical surgeon,

414
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:10,811
- he is a good military surgeon.
- You finished?

415
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:15,939
I have also noticed that nurses as well as
enlisted men address you as "Hawkeye".

416
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:18,020
Because that's my name. Hawkeye.

417
00:35:18,113 --> 00:35:21,778
That kind of informality is
inconsistent with maximum efficiency.

418
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:24,358
Oh, come off it, Major!

419
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:29,367
You've put me off my fried lobster.
Do you realise that?

420
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:33,836
I'm gonna go back to my bed, I'm gonna
put away the best part of a bottle of Scotch

421
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:38,215
and under normal circumstances,
you being normally what I'd call attractive,

422
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:43,640
I would have invited you back to share my
little bed with me and you might have come.

423
00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:50,177
But you really put me off. I mean,
you're what we call a regular army clown.

424
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,941
I wonder how such a degenerate

425
00:35:56,028 --> 00:36:00,072
could have reached a position
of responsibility in the army.

426
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,320
He was drafted.

427
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,502
- Radar!
- Your briefcase, sir.

428
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,093
- You're going to see Hammond.
- I'm spending the day with Hammond.

429
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,182
- Major Burns is in charge.
- Major Burns is in charge.

430
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,593
- Good luck.
- See you in the morning.

431
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:33,851
- Any last-minute instructions for the men?
- Radar has all the information.

432
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,018
But who's gonna be on CQ tonight?

433
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,318
Wait a minute. What about the...?

434
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,691
- Oh, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:46,410
I have some shirts with the buttons missing.
Ask Satsumi to sew them on, please.

436
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:48,905
- I'd be glad to do them.
- You don't have to.

437
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,958
- It's nothing. Nice jacket. Is it new?
- Oh, yeah. My... It was sent to me.

438
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,454
- You don't have to do that.
- Take care.

439
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:01,547
<i>?</i> Hail to the chief,
he's the best of all the surgeons

440
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:05,505
<i>?</i> He needs a queen to satisfy his urgin's

441
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,728
<i>?</i> Hail to the chief,
he's the best of all the trappers

442
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:15,318
<i>?</i> He needs a queen to sit upon his lappers

443
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:19,270
<i>?</i> Hail to the chief,
he's the best of all the cutters

444
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:23,576
<i>?</i> He needs a queen
with a bigger pair of udders

445
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:24,989
<i>?</i> Hail to the chief...

446
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,080
Blake's gone out of his mind.
Is that gonna go on all night?

447
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:33,041
<i>?</i> He took his orders
and shoved them up his rectum

448
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:35,086
No, no. No food. No food.

449
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:39,467
- Sex. I want sex. Bring me some sex.
- Scorch, come forth.

450
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:43,131
- No, no, bring me that one.
- He's chosen you!

451
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:47,267
That one. The sultry bitch with
the fire in her eyes. Take her clothes off.

452
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:50,021
I want that one! Yes! Yes!

453
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:53,854
Take her clothes off and bring her
to me now! I want her now!

454
00:37:56,236 --> 00:38:00,104
Doctor! Doctor!
You forgot your shingle, Doctor.

455
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,996
This letter

456
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:19,090
has been written

457
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:22,301
in the interest

458
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:23,847
of...

459
00:38:23,932 --> 00:38:26,008
Army morale.

460
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,602
Good. Army morale.

461
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:42,406
Wait a second.
Radar's gonna sing us our verse.

462
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:48,116
"This letter has been written
in the interest of army morale."

463
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:52,501
"We feel it is our duty to bring this
unwholesome situation to your attention."

464
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:57,830
"We write this jointly to assure you no one's
personal feeling has influenced this report."

465
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,417
"Respectfully,
Margaret J Houlihan, Major Burns."

466
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:03,299
- That's perfect.
- I think it's a marvellous letter.

467
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:06,640
- We make a good team, don't we?
- We think the same way.

468
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:08,802
Of course we do.

469
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:11,806
It's almost suppertime.

470
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:15,858
- You're not hungry, are you?
- Ravenous. How about you?

471
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,147
For you, Margaret.

472
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:43,678
Now, the sooner this reaches him, the sooner
we can turn this into a tight military outfit.

473
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:56,895
<i>Attention, camp compound. Corporal Judson</i>
<i>has informed the colonel's office</i>

474
00:39:56,987 --> 00:40:01,067
<i>that three cases of amphetamine sulphate</i>
<i>are unaccounted for again.</i>

475
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:04,194
<i>This is the third occurrence</i>
<i>of this type in the last month.</i>

476
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:10,206
<i>It must stop, by order of</i>
<i>Colonel Blake's office, 4077th MASH unit.</i>

477
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:13,709
I only wish I could
deliver that letter personally.

478
00:40:13,796 --> 00:40:16,750
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Margaret.

479
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:20,839
- I'll stop by later on to see if you're all right.
- That won't be necessary.

480
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:23,217
No, I don't mind.

481
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:25,382
I'll leave the door unlocked.

482
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:32,223
<i>Attention. Captain Mclntyre will give</i>
<i>a lecture on blood and fluid replacement</i>

483
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:39,528
<i>in the mess hall at 0800... Correction.</i>
<i>At 021... At nine o'clock this evening.</i>

484
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:43,693
Take your hat off, Radar.

485
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:46,028
You're before the king... queen.

486
00:40:46,122 --> 00:40:48,198
Don't get nervous, Radar.

487
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:55,544
<i>?</i> Long live the chief,
the colonel... the colonel

488
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:59,542
<i>?</i> Long live the chief,
the colonel did elect him...

489
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:26,696
You all right?

490
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:28,782
Fine.

491
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:31,330
Godless buffoons, all of them.

492
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:36,626
It's the disrespect for you, Frank.
That... that's what I can't forgive.

493
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:39,002
I'm used to it.

494
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:43,630
- Liquorice?
- No, thank you.

495
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:49,220
What makes me sore
is how they behave towards you.

496
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:52,679
They oughta be grateful to have you.

497
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,937
I certainly am.

498
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:02,940
I'm grateful to have you, Frank.

499
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,917
We've grown very close in a short time.

500
00:42:14,255 --> 00:42:16,924
It isn'tjust chance.

501
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:19,084
I'm sure of that.

502
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:23,795
God meant us to find each other.

503
00:42:25,225 --> 00:42:27,930
- His will be done!
- Darling!

504
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:31,178
Oh, Frank! Oh, Frank!

505
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:39,232
I'll help you. Oh, yes.

506
00:42:41,784 --> 00:42:44,072
Oh! Wait, wait. Get my robe.

507
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:47,738
Get my zipper. My zipper.

508
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,908
Oh, God!

509
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,296
Get the searchlight on.

510
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,893
Put the light out before it opens.

511
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:13,606
Hi. What's going on? May I join you?

512
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:17,521
A little radio show from home.

513
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:22,732
<i>Oh, yes. Oh, Frank.</i>

514
00:43:24,995 --> 00:43:29,325
- <i>Oh, Frank. Oh, yes.</i>
- Is this the Bickersons? I love them.

515
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:32,868
- Who?
- <i>The Battling Bickersons.</i> I love it.

516
00:43:35,256 --> 00:43:37,545
<i>Oh, Frank.</i>

517
00:43:39,594 --> 00:43:41,800
<i>Hard. Oh, Frank.</i>

518
00:43:41,888 --> 00:43:43,964
<i>Harder, harder.</i>

519
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:51,345
No, I... I forgot. I...

520
00:43:57,196 --> 00:44:00,362
- You're shining that thing in my eyes.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

521
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:02,651
<i>Darling...</i>

522
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:06,527
Oh, he is such a sweet man.

523
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:09,493
<i>Oh, Frank! Oh, Frank, my lips are hot.</i>

524
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,205
<i>Oh! Kiss my hot lips!</i>

525
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:16,791
<i>- Yes, they are hot.</i>
- Lips? Hot... hot lips?

526
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:20,503
We have got to share this
with the rest of the camp.

527
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:24,047
- Switch it over.
- OK.

528
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,676
<i>Oh, Frank. Yes!</i>

529
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:30,141
- <i>Darling...</i>
- <i>Oh, oh, Frank.</i>

530
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,935
<i>Oh, Frank, strangle me hard.</i>

531
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:36,310
- <i>Frank! Oh!</i>
- What the hell is that?

532
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:39,606
<i>Oh! Oh, yes. Oh!</i>

533
00:44:39,698 --> 00:44:43,862
Dr Frank Burns is doing
a bit of dilatation and curettage.

534
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:51,542
- Sounds like the major's having a dream.
- She's plugged in.

535
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:53,751
<i>Oh, Major.</i>

536
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:56,415
Oh, Frank.

537
00:44:56,924 --> 00:44:59,462
Frank. Wait a second.

538
00:44:59,552 --> 00:45:02,755
- What is it?
- Turn the light off!

539
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,765
No! Let go! Turn the light off!

540
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,181
Get your clothes on! Get your pants on!

541
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:12,015
Don't shout at me.

542
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:14,183
Don't shove me.

543
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:34,377
Too bad Henry wasn't here. He'd have
thought it was a real radio programme.

544
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:36,622
I thought it <i>was</i> a radio programme.

545
00:45:36,716 --> 00:45:40,500
We should send a letter of commendation
to the Armed Forces Radio Network.

546
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:45,720
Ah, wonderful. Yes. It was the most
uplifting programme I have ever heard.

547
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,264
It was climactic.

548
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,727
Morning, ladies.

549
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,696
Well, hiya, Hot Lips.

550
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:13,129
Oh. Oh, my goodness, over my...
I'm so sorry to touch you, but I...

551
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:18,755
- What's up with her today?
- I think it's one of those ladies' things.

552
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,761
- It's not like her to act like this.
- She's made a...

553
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:24,420
Bitch. Look at my new flannel sweater.

554
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:29,510
- She's gonna have a nervous breakdown.
- She can't even get outta the door.

555
00:46:33,942 --> 00:46:35,816
Morning, Frank.

556
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:40,067
Heard from your wife?

557
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,286
- Colonel, you forgot your briefcase.
- I left it in the jeep.

558
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:49,745
- You left it there.
- Oh, yes. I forgot it.

559
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:53,250
Morning, Captain. I hope
you didn't have to... Take care of this.

560
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:57,287
I hope you didn't have to bother
with those shirts. It wasn't necessary.

561
00:46:57,383 --> 00:47:01,464
- Too late, sir. It's a done thing.
- Well, thank you. Morning, Padre.

562
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:03,630
You know, I really got...

563
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:11,017
- Colonel, sir. How was your visit, sir?
- Great. The general wasn't there.

564
00:47:13,316 --> 00:47:17,777
Listen, about last night, sir,
there was nothing I could do about it, sir.

565
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:19,737
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

566
00:47:19,823 --> 00:47:23,773
- Well, it couldn't have been helped.
- Thank you, sir.

567
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:25,778
Oh, what's that?

568
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:28,789
Frank Burns and Hawkeye Pierce.
Very encouraging.

569
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:35,172
A bunch of the boys asked me to ask you
what Hot Lips was like in the sack. Was she...

570
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:40,132
- Mind your own business.
- No, Frank. Is she better than self-abuse?

571
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,005
What's that all about?
He gonna get some pointers or somethin'?

572
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,891
No, Hawkeye's gonna sign him up to make
a personal appearance tour in all the camps.

573
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:50,639
Is that a fact?

574
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,937
Can you make out what they're saying?

575
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:59,443
Does that big ass of hers move around a lot,
Frank, or does it sort of lie there flaccid?

576
00:48:00,783 --> 00:48:04,234
Hawkeye's questioning
the major on a point of anatomy.

577
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:06,404
Very professional.

578
00:48:06,497 --> 00:48:10,577
Would you say that
she was a moaner, Frank?

579
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:14,251
- What is Burns saying?
- Major Burns isn't saying much of anything.

580
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:16,212
He's formulating the answer.

581
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:19,466
Seriously, Frank. Does she go...

582
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:22,470
Or does she lie there quiet
and not do anything at all?

583
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:26,055
- Keep your filthy mouth to yourself.
- Or does she go...

584
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:30,810
Get him off me!

585
00:48:30,897 --> 00:48:34,183
- Get him off me!
- Frank, is that lesson one?

586
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:36,608
Frank Burns has gone nuts!

587
00:48:41,575 --> 00:48:43,817
I'm wearing glasses, for God's sake!

588
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:49,285
Watch out for your goodies. He's a sex
maniac. I don't think Hot Lips satisfied him.

589
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:52,953
Don't let him kiss you, Hawkeye.

590
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:01,586
<i>? The time has come for us</i>

591
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,298
<i>? To say sayonara</i>

592
00:49:07,936 --> 00:49:10,807
<i>? My heart will always</i>

593
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:15,394
<i>? Be yours for eternity</i>

594
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:25,407
<i>? I knew sometime</i>
<i>we'd have to say sayonara...</i>

595
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:35,417
Colonel, fair's fair. If I nail Hot Lips
and punch Hawkeye, can I go home?

596
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:42,257
<i>? I'll remember our romance</i>

597
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:47,139
<i>? Until the day that I die</i>

598
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:50,428
<i>? I'll see your face</i>

599
00:49:50,522 --> 00:49:55,350
<i>? In the moon and stars in the sky</i>

600
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,648
- Hawkeye!
- Be there in a minute.

601
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:01,610
- Hawkeye!
- Oh, shit.

602
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,279
OK. Seidman, get another guy. We gotta take
this into the ORjust on the stretcher.

603
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:08,779
Hold on, you're gonna be just fine, fella.

604
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:10,950
OK. I can't move my hand. Come on.

605
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:15,786
Have you got the cutdowns?

606
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:18,171
You're gonna go to sleep. You'll be fine.

607
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:23,467
- Hot Lips, let me have a sterile knife.
- I'm gonna need two vascular clamps

608
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:25,216
and an arterial suture.

609
00:50:25,308 --> 00:50:30,266
As soon as you give me the clamp I want you
to gown and glove me. All right? Ready?

610
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:33,060
OK. Here we go. It's gonna spurt a bit. OK.

611
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,270
- You got it?
- Ah, yeah, you baby.

612
00:50:37,613 --> 00:50:39,689
- Clamp.
- Yeah.

613
00:50:43,661 --> 00:50:45,737
OK, gown.

614
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:50,330
- Gloves. You got an arterial suture ready?
- Yeah.

615
00:50:50,418 --> 00:50:53,787
OK. Ugly, move out of the way
cos I'm working over there.

616
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,506
Baby, we're gonna see some stitching
like you never saw before!

617
00:50:58,593 --> 00:51:02,211
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>
<i>This is Colonel Blake's office.</i>

618
00:51:02,305 --> 00:51:06,848
<i>The American Medical Association has</i>
<i>just declared marijuana a dangerous drug.</i>

619
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:11,229
<i>Despite earlier claims by physicians</i>
<i>that it is no more harmful than alcohol,</i>

620
00:51:11,314 --> 00:51:14,351
<i>this is now found to be the case. That is all.</i>

621
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:18,735
When did you get them? Let me try it on you.

622
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,898
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

623
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:24,360
Hey, Dago Reddo! Hi.
You're just in time for cocktails.

624
00:51:24,453 --> 00:51:27,240
- Come on in.
- No, thank you. I can't, really.

625
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,953
- Hawkeye. Hawkeye.
- OK, Red.

626
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:32,118
- Could I speak to you?
- Yeah, sure.

627
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:34,370
No, outside.

628
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:37,168
- What?
- I have to talk to you outside.

629
00:51:41,221 --> 00:51:43,462
Hiya, Pup-Pup.

630
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:46,641
- Sorry to drag you away from the gang, but...
- What?

631
00:51:46,726 --> 00:51:51,187
This'll only take a moment.
There's a problem with Walt Waldowski.

632
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:53,680
Painless? You got a toothache? He's good.

633
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:57,939
No, no, it's not my problem.
See, it's his problem.

634
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,778
- What do you mean? What is it?
- Well, what is it... That's...

635
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:07,621
It's difficult to talk about, you see, because
I learned about his problem in confession.

636
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:10,624
- Oh, and you can't...
- I can't divulge.

637
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,786
Can you give me a hint?

638
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,506
- Just an idea?
- Well, no.

639
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:21,424
But I can tell you how serious it is.

640
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,589
He and the boys were playing poker

641
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:29,471
and one of the boys turned to him and
asked him for a ruling on one of the hands.

642
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:36,230
And Walt said, he said
"What does it matter? It's only a game."

643
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:41,028
Painless said "What does it matter?
It's only a game"? Poker, only a game?

644
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,192
Yeah.

645
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:48,410
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
- I guess I better go see a man about a tooth.

646
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,373
Thank you.

647
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:54,327
- See, I didn't know what to... do.
- Pup-Pup.

648
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,830
You see, there are some...

649
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,757
There are some things that absolution just...

650
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,304
Well...

651
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:07,015
Seven, eight, jack. Three on a low.

652
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:11,230
Four, three... Hawkeye, there's
an empty chair here looking for a player.

653
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:14,150
Baby, I've got a toothache
like you can't believe.

654
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:18,896
Why do you bring that dog in here?
Last time you did I lost $30.

655
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:21,776
Why do you have to sit behind me?
It makes me nervous.

656
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:27,158
- It brings me a lot of luck. Sit there, Boone.
- Come on. Let's play, men. Deuce. Ace.

657
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:30,122
- Can I take some Scotch?
- Sure.

658
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:32,285
- You want some?
- No.

659
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,871
- How you feelin'?
- No, don't touch me.

660
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:40,583
Look, if a...

661
00:53:40,678 --> 00:53:44,427
If a man isn't a man any more,

662
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:49,802
what's he got left
that he should be living for?

663
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,932
OK, tell me about it. What's the story?

664
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:58,818
Well, you know that little nurse that was
through here last night with the 325th?

665
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:02,275
- The little one with the big... boobs.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

666
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:04,859
Well, anyway, I...

667
00:54:04,954 --> 00:54:08,489
I wasn't gonna fool around out here
because I got these...

668
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:12,165
I got these three girls
that I'm engaged to back home.

669
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:15,954
And you wanted to be faithful.
Baby, you are 7,000 miles from home.

670
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:21,209
Well, anyway, I took her out last night
and I... I failed.

671
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:26,381
- You mean she wouldn't put out?
- She wanted to, but it was me. I couldn't...

672
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:30,806
- Oh, you couldn't... It wouldn't...
- Yeah, nothing happened. Not at all.

673
00:54:30,897 --> 00:54:34,480
That happens to everybody.
It's happened to me four or five times...

674
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:37,652
Yeah, well, it's never happened to me before.

675
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,781
Come on. You're the best-equipped
dentist in the army.

676
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:45,865
- You're the dental Don Juan of Detroit.
- That's just a cover-up.

677
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:49,705
- What's a cover-up?
- Don Juanism.

678
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:54,454
- I've been reading about it. It's a cover-up.
- It's a cover-up for what?

679
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:57,589
Well...

680
00:54:59,886 --> 00:55:02,459
I'm a fairy.

681
00:55:02,555 --> 00:55:05,556
A victim of latent homosexuality.

682
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:08,133
I've turned into a fairy.

683
00:55:16,194 --> 00:55:21,022
- Have you... have you done anything?
- No, but it's only a matter of time.

684
00:55:21,116 --> 00:55:23,192
I just can't face it.

685
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:28,832
Look, Hawkeye, suppose that
you found out that you were one, huh?

686
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:33,455
- One...?
- Yeah. You wouldn't like telling your wife.

687
00:55:33,546 --> 00:55:39,335
- No, I can see that that would be a problem.
- I got the same problem, only multiplied.

688
00:55:40,345 --> 00:55:43,050
Well, you know, Man o'War,

689
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:49,178
after they retired him from racing,
they put him out to stud.

690
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:55,890
And he had an average of about 120,

691
00:55:55,986 --> 00:56:00,778
130 foals every year.

692
00:56:00,866 --> 00:56:03,322
And he lived to be 36.

693
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:08,405
And then when he died they did an autopsy
and found out that he was a raving queen.

694
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:13,455
No, that's a little-known fact, but it's the truth.

695
00:56:13,546 --> 00:56:18,255
- Painless has a couple of years left in him.
- Maybe more. He hasn't started raving yet.

696
00:56:18,343 --> 00:56:22,423
Painless is a dentist, and a dentist
shouldn't read. That's his problem.

697
00:56:22,514 --> 00:56:25,515
His problem is that he believes it.
He is convinced.

698
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,468
It's an obsession and it is a vital force.

699
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:34,389
- Here he comes! The jawbreaker.
- He's not gonna break anything.

700
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:36,561
Just act natural.

701
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:48,207
All right, Painless? How's she goin'?

702
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:51,542
Something in a marshmallow?

703
00:56:52,378 --> 00:56:56,590
No, it's OK, fellas. I know
you've been talking about me, and...

704
00:56:58,176 --> 00:57:04,510
Well, I came over to tell you that I've decided
that I'm... going to commit suicide.

705
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:11,180
Well, if you're really gonna
go ahead and do it,

706
00:57:11,273 --> 00:57:14,523
do you think you could
leave me your record player?

707
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:17,314
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

708
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:22,360
Gonna miss you, Painless. How do you
plan to do it? A.45 between the eyes?

709
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:25,620
- That's awful sloppy.
- It's reliable though.

710
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:28,659
Well, that's another thing I wanted to ask you.

711
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:31,916
I'm sort of new at this game and...

712
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:34,838
Do you have any particular
method you'd recommend?

713
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:38,754
I don't know. I think my colleagues and I
could come up with something

714
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:42,259
- to relinquish the vital forces of their...
- Black capsule.

715
00:57:42,347 --> 00:57:45,467
- Black capsule.
- Of course. That's neat.

716
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:48,180
What's a black capsule?
You have any? Does it work?

717
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:51,935
It worked for Hitler and Eva Braun.
It should work for you.

718
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:56,943
Hawkeye, I really must... I should
check with the military vicar's office.

719
00:57:57,029 --> 00:58:02,569
I cannot give absolution to a man who is
about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.

720
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,242
Look, Dago, he is not
committing suicide, only intending to.

721
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,367
So you're not dealing with an act,
but with an intention.

722
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:14,998
If it works, he will not commit suicide, so
therefore you're preventing a mortal sin. OK?

723
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:17,046
Well, I should check.

724
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:19,838
- Well, you check on it.
- Well, there's...

725
00:59:04,825 --> 00:59:06,735
All right, where you at?

726
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,904
There you go.

727
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:15,367
Now, then, you've all come here
to say your final farewell to ol' Walt here.

728
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:17,834
- Farewell, Walt.
- Dear ol' Walt.

729
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:23,427
You know, I got an idea that maybe
it's not such a final farewell after all.

730
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:30,594
I think maybe ol' Walt's goin' on into the
unknown to do a little recon work for us all.

731
00:59:30,686 --> 00:59:33,971
- Huh?
- I just wanna say one thing.

732
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:38,607
Nobody ordered Walt to go on this mission.
He volunteered for certain death.

733
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:41,944
- That's true.
- It's what we award our highest medals for.

734
00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:45,566
- That's beautiful.
- That's what being a soldier is all about.

735
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,115
- Oh, yeah. Hear! Hear!
- Yes. Yes.

736
00:59:48,204 --> 00:59:53,329
Gentlemen, I think there's only one person
who has anything to add to that.

737
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:57,629
- And that's Dago Red.
- Oh, the padre. Let's hear it for the padre.

738
01:00:04,596 --> 01:00:07,514
Walt, here's... here's your black capsule.

739
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:13,973
Look, this thing works pretty fast, doesn't it?

740
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:16,555
I think I better go lie down over there.

741
01:00:18,694 --> 01:00:21,363
Walt, that'll help you.

742
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:29,280
<i>?</i> Through early morning fog I see

743
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:34,700
<i>?</i> Visions of the things to be

744
01:00:34,794 --> 01:00:40,299
<i>?</i> The pains that are withheld for me

745
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:43,005
<i>?</i> I realise

746
01:00:43,094 --> 01:00:49,347
<i>?</i> And I can see

747
01:00:49,434 --> 01:00:53,563
<i>?</i> That suicide is painless

748
01:00:54,356 --> 01:00:58,686
<i>?</i> It brings on many changes

749
01:00:58,777 --> 01:01:08,031
<i>?</i> And I can take or leave it if I please

750
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,450
<i>?</i> The game of life is hard to play

751
01:01:12,542 --> 01:01:16,492
<i>?</i> I'm going to lose it anyway

752
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:21,002
<i>?</i> The losing card I'll someday lay

753
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:27,462
<i>?</i> So this is all I have to say

754
01:01:27,974 --> 01:01:31,807
- <i>?</i> That suicide is painless
- Wherever you go, take this. Good luck.

755
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:36,184
- <i>?</i> It brings on many changes
- It's out there.

756
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:44,983
- <i>?</i> And I can take or leave it if I please
- I'll always remember you just like this.

757
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,908
<i>?</i> The only way to win is cheat

758
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:53,290
<i>?</i> And lay it down before I'm beat

759
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,421
<i>?</i> And to another give my seat

760
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:02,417
<i>?</i> For that's the only painless feat

761
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,799
Painless.

762
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:08,339
<i>?</i> Suicide is painless

763
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:13,015
- <i>?</i> It brings on many changes
- Nice party. Thanks for asking me.

764
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:18,396
- <i>?</i> And I can take or leave it if I please
- Thing is...

765
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:21,190
you're throwing your whole education away.

766
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:28,488
- <i>?</i> And you can do
- Good night, Jawbreaker.

767
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:32,031
<i>?</i> The same thing

768
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:38,377
<i>?</i> If you please

769
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:02,605
Hi, baby.

770
01:03:02,698 --> 01:03:04,774
- Hi.
- I'm glad you could come.

771
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,701
Sorry it was so late.

772
01:03:07,787 --> 01:03:11,571
That's OK. I really couldn't
sleep anyway. I'm so nervous.

773
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:20,874
You leavin' tomorrow?

774
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:26,215
Yeah. I'll be on my way in less than 12 hours.

775
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:32,637
I suppose who it's going to be really
roughest on though is your husband.

776
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:37,226
Why are you all of a sudden
so concerned with him?

777
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,904
A man would be more considerate to his wife.
He wouldn't go home a nervous wreck.

778
01:03:43,616 --> 01:03:48,657
- Stop using logic cos you're just proving...
- It could be an impersonal thing.

779
01:03:48,746 --> 01:03:51,071
...why I shouldn't go to bed with you.

780
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,284
I didn't mean me.

781
01:03:57,714 --> 01:04:03,799
You have the rare privilege that happens
to chief executives of states or nations.

782
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:08,134
You have the privilege
of restoring a human being's life

783
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:10,431
by a tender act of mercy.

784
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:15,261
What is this? Oh, Hawkeye, is he dead?

785
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:18,522
No, no.

786
01:04:18,611 --> 01:04:20,687
He's not dead. Not yet.

787
01:04:22,031 --> 01:04:26,360
Painless has a psychological problem,
and you're the only person who can help him.

788
01:04:26,452 --> 01:04:30,117
Oh, no, Hawkeye. Oh, no. Come on.

789
01:04:30,206 --> 01:04:35,627
No, Maria. You've gotta look on this as a
nurse. Painless needs it for therapeutic value.

790
01:04:35,712 --> 01:04:40,173
It will help him, and it wouldn't do you
any harm either to think about it for a bit.

791
01:04:40,258 --> 01:04:44,885
If you think that your virtue is more important
than Painless's life, that's fine.

792
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:49,680
I just want you to stay here
and be with him for a minute.

793
01:04:49,768 --> 01:04:51,974
Just look at him.

794
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:56,938
- Just stay close to the whole man...
- Oh, Hawkeye!

795
01:04:58,235 --> 01:05:00,311
And look at him.

796
01:05:04,992 --> 01:05:06,866
Hawkeye!

797
01:05:08,996 --> 01:05:11,072
Oh, this is ridiculous.

798
01:05:48,162 --> 01:05:52,326
You forgot your hat! You wouldn't
wanna leave without a souvenir.

799
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:54,493
Have a good trip.

800
01:05:55,837 --> 01:05:59,420
Lieutenant Schneider,
you forgot your travelling orders. Wait.

801
01:05:59,507 --> 01:06:03,505
You're supposed to pick...
These are your travelling orders.

802
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:11,261
- Morning, Painless.
- Oh, hi, Hawkeye.

803
01:06:11,353 --> 01:06:13,227
How's she goin'?

804
01:06:13,313 --> 01:06:15,555
Slept like a doll last night.

805
01:06:15,649 --> 01:06:20,477
Well, can't waste time. Big day.
Got two jaws to rebuild. Come on, Seidman.

806
01:06:21,864 --> 01:06:23,940
Have a good day.

807
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:48,555
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

808
01:06:48,642 --> 01:06:53,351
<i>Religious services for Yom Kippur</i>
<i>will be held... will not be held this Friday,</i>

809
01:06:53,438 --> 01:06:55,562
<i>due to mitigating circumstances.</i>

810
01:06:55,649 --> 01:07:00,691
<i>For those who wish to observe said holiday,</i>
<i>Sunday has been reserved. That is all.</i>

811
01:07:00,779 --> 01:07:03,567
Trapper, this one's for you, babe.

812
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:09,280
- That man is a prisoner of war, Doctor.
- So are you, but you don't know it.

813
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:13,370
- It's in pretty deep.
- I think that was my finger.

814
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:16,663
I need your help, Hawkeye.
It's hit more than a lung.

815
01:07:16,754 --> 01:07:19,709
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

816
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:21,424
- Hey, Radar.
- Yes.

817
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:24,345
Has that A negative come in from Seoul?

818
01:07:24,429 --> 01:07:28,130
- We keep ordering it, but it never arrives.
- How'd the kid take the induction, Ugly?

819
01:07:28,475 --> 01:07:30,384
Good. He's ready.

820
01:07:30,477 --> 01:07:32,636
Pickups and irrigation, please.

821
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,399
Give me some gel foam.

822
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,898
Not now, honey. Go back to sleep.

823
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:50,953
Scissors.

824
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,531
- Sponge.
- More sponges.

825
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:58,039
- Let's have the suction up here. Thank you.
- Rib spreader.

826
01:07:58,131 --> 01:08:02,840
- Clamp.
- Let's give him a sexy scar, huh? Fantastic.

827
01:08:02,928 --> 01:08:04,801
- Lot of blood.
- Sponge.

828
01:08:04,888 --> 01:08:08,423
- Scissors. Watch it.
- Give me something to stuff it in with.

829
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,924
- Pickups for me.
- How's he tolerating this?

830
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:13,855
- Good. He's young.
- Things get slippery.

831
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:17,723
- You're a backhanded guy.
- Let me have the forceps and a sponge stick.

832
01:08:17,818 --> 01:08:21,567
Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass,
but you're a damn good nurse.

833
01:08:21,655 --> 01:08:24,906
- Thanks, Trapper.
- Put enough blood in him, John.

834
01:08:24,992 --> 01:08:28,492
There's a clot on the cava above the atrium.
Must be the point of entry.

835
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:30,453
Clamp.

836
01:08:33,126 --> 01:08:36,162
I feel a fragment right underneath the clot.

837
01:08:36,254 --> 01:08:38,377
- You control the cava.
- OK.

838
01:08:38,465 --> 01:08:41,169
- We gotta stop that spurting.
- Clamp.

839
01:08:41,259 --> 01:08:43,715
- Do what?
- Stop the spurting.

840
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:46,045
That's a very good technical term.

841
01:08:46,807 --> 01:08:50,935
Christ. It's not in the cava.
It's in the pulmonary artery on the left side.

842
01:08:51,019 --> 01:08:55,681
- OK. Let me close him up and sit on it for...
- We can't sit on it. What if we're jammed up?

843
01:08:55,774 --> 01:08:59,938
We don't have the blood!
If you cut again, you'll lose him.

844
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:04,027
Look, Hawkeye, the artery can erode.

845
01:09:04,116 --> 01:09:06,607
Now's the time to take our shot.

846
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:09,739
- A negative.
- You said you didn't have any blood.

847
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:11,076
I found a donor.

848
01:09:11,165 --> 01:09:16,041
Up close, all crumpled up like that,
they don't look like much, you know.

849
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:18,454
Was he loaded or empty when he crashed?

850
01:09:18,548 --> 01:09:21,217
He was loaded, but it didn't matter much.

851
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:24,800
You see, the two guys
he was carrying were dead already.

852
01:09:24,888 --> 01:09:26,762
What about the pilot?

853
01:09:26,848 --> 01:09:31,392
Pilot's fine. Took off a kneecap and he lost
the function in his right hand, but he's great.

854
01:09:31,478 --> 01:09:34,894
I didn't hear. What colour was her hair?

855
01:09:34,982 --> 01:09:37,651
Black, shiny. Shiny, black hair.

856
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:42,978
Black? You like black?
I... I'm kind of partial to blonde myself.

857
01:09:43,407 --> 01:09:48,200
I knew it. I knew you had
an attraction for Hot Lips Houlihan.

858
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:50,363
- Hear! Hear!
- Go to hell, Captain Pierce.

859
01:09:50,456 --> 01:09:56,080
You know I damn near puke every time I look
at her. 'Sides, I'll bet she's not a real blonde.

860
01:09:56,171 --> 01:10:01,129
How dare you say that about
an officer of the United States Army, sir?

861
01:10:01,217 --> 01:10:05,465
I'll not only say it,
but I'll back it with 20 bucks. How's that?

862
01:10:05,555 --> 01:10:08,473
You have yourself a bet, sir.
You're my witness.

863
01:10:08,558 --> 01:10:11,394
OK, but who's gonna be
the poor schmuck who finds out?

864
01:10:11,478 --> 01:10:15,974
Well, I could, if no one else wants... I...

865
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:21,309
No, no. We...
We gotta all see it together somehow.

866
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:39,168
It's five minutes after the time
the nurses shower. Where are they?

867
01:10:39,257 --> 01:10:41,333
They will be here.

868
01:10:42,177 --> 01:10:44,253
Finest kind, Ho-Jon.

869
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,506
- What's happening?
- Radar...

870
01:10:48,392 --> 01:10:49,886
- See the papers?
- What?

871
01:10:49,977 --> 01:10:52,728
You don't know about
the papers the colonel left?

872
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:56,016
- Why didn't you tell me about the papers?
- I tried to.

873
01:10:58,402 --> 01:11:01,023
Here you go, here you go. They're comin'.

874
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:12,489
- Evelyn, could you give me a hand?
- Sure.

875
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:16,166
Hey, Frankie, could you
take a look at my corns, please?

876
01:11:17,255 --> 01:11:20,838
Knocko, the pictures of my kids have come.

877
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:23,843
- Hot Lips, would you like to see them?
- I'm not interested.

878
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:26,005
Hey, Scorch.

879
01:12:40,925 --> 01:12:42,799
Bravo!

880
01:12:43,803 --> 01:12:46,805
Bravo! Bravo!

881
01:12:49,142 --> 01:12:52,262
Bravo! Author! Bravo!

882
01:12:54,898 --> 01:12:57,899
Bravo! Author! Author!

883
01:12:57,985 --> 01:13:00,191
20 bucks, huh?

884
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:01,939
You win the bet.

885
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:04,154
Oh! That's it!

886
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,959
- Major, what went on?
- Where's Blake?

887
01:13:18,047 --> 01:13:21,713
- You can't see Colonel Blake.
- You shut up, you twerp!

888
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,135
This isn't a hospital! It's an insane asylum!

889
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:36,808
And it's your fault because
you don't do anything to discourage them!

890
01:13:37,443 --> 01:13:40,479
- What do you want me to do?
- Put them under arrest!

891
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:45,529
See what a court-martial thinks
of their drunken hooliganism!

892
01:13:45,618 --> 01:13:50,280
First they called me Hot Lips,
and you let them get away with it!

893
01:13:50,373 --> 01:13:54,453
And then you let them
get away with everything!

894
01:13:54,544 --> 01:14:01,294
And if you don't turn them over
to the MP this minute,

895
01:14:01,384 --> 01:14:06,046
I... I'm gonna resign my commission!

896
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:10,348
Goddammit, Hot Lips,
resign your goddamn commission.

897
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,766
My commission!

898
01:14:18,068 --> 01:14:20,144
My commission!

899
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:23,063
My commission!

900
01:14:23,157 --> 01:14:25,114
A little more wine, my dear?

901
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:27,277
Yes, please.

902
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:33,784
Is that right?

903
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:42,501
Come on, baby.

904
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:47,389
Come on. You all right? Keep it straight, eh?

905
01:14:47,474 --> 01:14:51,638
- First the present, then dinner, then a movie.
- You mean all three of you?

906
01:14:51,728 --> 01:14:54,979
- Where I go, Warren goes.
- You don't want me to go with you?

907
01:14:55,065 --> 01:14:56,939
Well, Boone...

908
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:06,739
He's Syngman Rhee's son,
and he goes right in.

909
01:15:17,672 --> 01:15:19,748
Hey, soldier!

910
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:25,301
- Me?
- Yeah, you. Where you from?

911
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:29,137
- A MASH outfit at the front line.
- No, I mean your hometown.

912
01:15:29,226 --> 01:15:31,468
It's on the East Coast.

913
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:33,887
Have you been wounded yet?

914
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,187
Yeah, a little... a slight...

915
01:15:39,278 --> 01:15:43,857
- Would you like to say hello to your mother?
- Well, my mother's dead actually.

916
01:15:43,949 --> 01:15:46,785
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

917
01:15:46,869 --> 01:15:50,488
- I'd like to say hello to my father, if I could.
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

918
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,956
Hi, Dad.

919
01:16:19,862 --> 01:16:24,654
Excuse me. I am making
an examination of this young man

920
01:16:24,742 --> 01:16:27,529
to find out if he would be
a soldier in our army.

921
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:30,491
Yeah, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon.
How's she goin', boy?

922
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:33,828
His heartbeat is much too fast

923
01:16:33,918 --> 01:16:37,453
and his blood pressure is dangerously high.

924
01:16:37,547 --> 01:16:39,421
Oh, yeah?

925
01:16:41,092 --> 01:16:43,762
I guess you think he's unfit for the army, eh?

926
01:16:43,845 --> 01:16:48,922
Yes, at first. But when I saw on his paper
he worked in an American hospital

927
01:16:49,017 --> 01:16:53,181
where there are many drugs
and he could have taken some by mistake.

928
01:16:53,272 --> 01:16:56,356
- What would he do a thing like that for?
- Who knows?

929
01:16:56,442 --> 01:16:59,811
To find the truth I will keep him here
for a couple of days.

930
01:16:59,904 --> 01:17:03,189
By tomorrow his fast heart
and high blood pressure may be gone.

931
01:17:03,282 --> 01:17:06,651
- Look...
- So I suggest you say goodbye to him now.

932
01:17:06,744 --> 01:17:10,991
- Doctor, I've...
- It was a nice try. Come on, Ho-Jon.

933
01:17:15,545 --> 01:17:17,953
Oh, man!

934
01:17:18,506 --> 01:17:21,211

939
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,008
Idiot! He knocked me down the hill!
He broke my umbrella!

940
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:17,230
I wish they wouldn't land these things
when we're playing golf.

941
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:24,023
- That's him on the right. Wait! Wait!
- Captain Mclntyre.

942
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,904
The lieutenant's come from Seoul to see you.

943
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:29,568
- You're Captain Mclntyre?
- Yes, I'm Captain...

944
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:34,622
Lieutenant, you look terrible. Captain,
look at his eyes. Let me see your tongue.

945
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:38,459
Oh, no, no. Take your shirt off
and tell me where it hurts.

946
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:42,083
I haven't seen a case like this
since I was in school. My goodness.

947
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:45,213
Listen, Vollmer, tell them
to prepare the major surgery.

948
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:47,974
This is one case in five. I think I can save you.

949
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:50,845
You're to proceed to
Kokura, Japan, immediately.

950
01:18:50,936 --> 01:18:52,929
Kokura, Japan! What's this about?

951
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:57,315
There's a congressman. Grenade went off
in practice. There's a piece in his heart.

952
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,974
- What?
- GI's dad's a congressman.

953
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,740
Grenade went off in practice.
Piece in his heart.

954
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:05,528
- That the X-rays?
- Yeah.

955
01:19:05,618 --> 01:19:09,616
Apparently some big heart surgeon
in Boston told the congressman

956
01:19:09,705 --> 01:19:15,459
the only man to take care of his son
is Captain John Mclntyre.

957
01:19:15,545 --> 01:19:20,254
Of course, I suppose there could be
two Captain John Mclntyres.

958
01:19:20,342 --> 01:19:22,548
No, no, I'm the only John Mclntyre.

959
01:19:22,636 --> 01:19:26,336
Look, Hammond says I can take
someone to assist me. Wanna come?

960
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:28,590
Yeah.

961
01:19:28,684 --> 01:19:32,349
Lieutenant, I think I can save you.
Take one of these every half-hour.

962
01:19:32,437 --> 01:19:38,025
Now, get into your helicopter and button up
your shirt! You're in the military army!

963
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:41,147
- It isn't even close to his heart.
- I know, it's nothing.

964
01:19:41,238 --> 01:19:44,524
But how many times do you get to go
to Japan with your golf clubs?

965
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:46,693
Come on, Shirley.

966
01:20:17,735 --> 01:20:19,193
Goddamn army.

967
01:20:29,497 --> 01:20:31,573
Goddamn army!

968
01:20:39,215 --> 01:20:41,208
Goddamn army jeep!

969
01:20:45,847 --> 01:20:48,932
Excuse me, could you tell me
where the congressman's son is?

970
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:51,389
- Ward six.
- Darling, would you register us?

971
01:20:51,478 --> 01:20:56,057
Just a moment!
You can't go in there. Who are you?

972
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:58,771
- Who am I? The pro from...
- I don't believe you.

973
01:20:58,861 --> 01:21:01,352
You can't go in till I call Captain Peterson.

974
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:06,524
Wait a second. If this soldier wants to enforce
her orders, I'll take her on single-handedly.

975
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:09,822
- Get away!
- You open this.

976
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:12,832
- He's won two Purple Hearts.
- You can't come in!

977
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:16,369
- I'll ravage your body.
- I'll call the police. You can't come in!

978
01:21:16,462 --> 01:21:21,255
- You have not seen such a beast!
- I'm gonna call Captain Peterson. Stay away!

979
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:29,931
- Captain Peterson, please.
- Captain Peterson!

980
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:40,147
- What are you two hoodlums doing here?
- Ma'am, we are surgeons here to operate.

981
01:21:40,237 --> 01:21:44,781
You can't go near a patient until Colonel
Merrill says it's OK. And he's still at lunch.

982
01:21:44,867 --> 01:21:48,402
Mother, I wanna go to work in one hour.
We are the pros from Dover

983
01:21:48,496 --> 01:21:52,541
and we figure to crack this kid's chest
and go play golf before it gets dark.

984
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:55,875
So find the gas passer,
have him premedicate the patient,

985
01:21:55,962 --> 01:21:59,830
then bring me the latest pictures on him.
The ones we saw were old.

986
01:21:59,924 --> 01:22:04,551
Then tell the kitchen to rustle us up lunch.
Ham would be fine. Steak would be better.

987
01:22:04,638 --> 01:22:09,134
Then get one nurse who knows how to work
in close without getting her tits in my way.

988
01:22:10,978 --> 01:22:13,054
Oh, you fool.

989
01:22:15,107 --> 01:22:17,598
How do you want your steak cooked?

990
01:22:22,907 --> 01:22:24,781
Towel.

991
01:22:29,956 --> 01:22:33,788
Say the magic words,
you make a hundred dollars.

992
01:22:36,462 --> 01:22:39,629
All right! I demand an explanation.

993
01:22:39,716 --> 01:22:42,124
Somebody get that dirty old man out.

994
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:44,377
Dirty old ma...

995
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:45,930
I'm Colonel Merrill.

996
01:22:46,014 --> 01:22:49,466
I don't care if you're Jack Armstrong,
the All-American Boy.

997
01:22:49,559 --> 01:22:53,392
If this chest gets infected,
I will tell the congressman who did it.

998
01:22:53,856 --> 01:22:56,940
- Scissors, please.
- Will you let me have a skin suture?

999
01:22:57,026 --> 01:22:58,686
Old pickups.

1000
01:22:59,778 --> 01:23:02,352
- Who was that?
- That's Colonel Merrill.

1001
01:23:02,448 --> 01:23:05,782
- This is his little store here.
- Oh, yeah?

1002
01:23:05,868 --> 01:23:07,742
Who are you?

1003
01:23:07,828 --> 01:23:11,032
I'm Dr Jekyll actually.
This is my friend Mr Hyde.

1004
01:23:13,626 --> 01:23:18,834
Why don't you save your rapierlike wit
for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye?

1005
01:23:23,595 --> 01:23:27,723
Did I ever tell you about my friend,
Me Lay Marston?

1006
01:23:27,808 --> 01:23:32,055
Oh, yeah. Your friend who would go
around saying "Me lay, you lay" to the girls.

1007
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:36,642
He'd score once out of 50 times.
Yeah, you told me about him.

1008
01:23:36,734 --> 01:23:39,438
He's passing gas for
the congressman's son here.

1009
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:42,529
Oh, really? When he's not passing gas,
does he play golf?

1010
01:23:42,615 --> 01:23:44,358
I don't know.

1011
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:47,368
- D'you play golf?
- No. I have no time for golf.

1012
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:51,949
I'm moonlighting down at Dr Yamachi's
New Era Hospital and Whorehouse.

1013
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,915
This old guy I met when I came over.

1014
01:23:54,002 --> 01:23:59,043
He has a crude hospital for kids and finances
it with a whorehouse all in the same building.

1015
01:23:59,132 --> 01:24:02,916
It's the NEHWH. Come on down
and we'll get something going for you.

1016
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:06,510
- I've got an in in Kokura!
- Here, soldier, take these.

1017
01:24:06,598 --> 01:24:11,011
Take our golf carts, but don't drop anything
cos we're gonna play golf later.

1018
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:13,012
Goodbye, pimp.

1019
01:24:13,105 --> 01:24:14,848
- Ladies.
- Girls.

1020
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:17,229
Gentlemen. Be careful with that...

1021
01:24:18,402 --> 01:24:20,478
Military police.

1022
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:41,673
All right, fellas, the game's over.

1023
01:24:43,762 --> 01:24:45,838
Finally caught up with us, huh?

1024
01:24:47,891 --> 01:24:49,765
Where did we fail?

1025
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:54,846
I don't know. I think it was the woman.
Something tells me I've seen her before.

1026
01:24:55,441 --> 01:24:57,517
She was the one in Tangiers.

1027
01:24:58,444 --> 01:25:02,821
You can wait in the colonel's office.
He'll be back in a few minutes.

1028
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:14,868
We don't blame you.

1029
01:25:17,922 --> 01:25:19,333
You're only doing yourjob.

1030
01:25:19,424 --> 01:25:23,718
<i>United Press International</i>
<i>today voted the Korean War</i>

1031
01:25:23,803 --> 01:25:28,549
- <i>the top news story of 1951.</i>
- We're in the middle of putting.

1032
01:25:28,642 --> 01:25:30,718
My God.

1033
01:25:31,937 --> 01:25:34,428
All right. You men are under arrest.

1034
01:25:35,524 --> 01:25:38,608
- I'll have you court-martialled!
- Come off it, Colonel.

1035
01:25:38,694 --> 01:25:41,185
You don't have us. We have you.

1036
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,072
Your boys blew this case
and we bailed you out.

1037
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:51,952
Now we are gonna stay here for one more day
and check out the congressman's kid,

1038
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:56,502
and... get in some golf for ourselves.

1039
01:25:56,588 --> 01:25:59,375
If that's OK with you, then we got a deal.

1040
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:02,719
And if it isn't, we can always call Washington

1041
01:26:02,802 --> 01:26:06,966
and you tell them your story and
we'll tell them ours. It's as simple as that.

1042
01:26:07,057 --> 01:26:11,849
In the meantime we'll be at the pro shop
where we are gonna shower and shave.

1043
01:26:11,937 --> 01:26:15,887
If you wanna get in touch with us,
that is where we will be.

1044
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,356
Is that a client?

1045
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:42,710
Excuse me.

1046
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:52,637
Oh, you try one.

1047
01:26:53,063 --> 01:26:55,139
- Good?
- Oh, it's terrible.

1048
01:27:00,613 --> 01:27:03,733
Listen, I hate to do this to you fellas,

1049
01:27:03,824 --> 01:27:06,861
but do you think
you could look at a kid for me?

1050
01:27:06,953 --> 01:27:08,198
- Now?
- A kid?

1051
01:27:08,287 --> 01:27:10,494
We had a little carelessness here,

1052
01:27:10,581 --> 01:27:16,086
and the other day one of our girls presented
us with an 8lb American-Japanese boy.

1053
01:27:18,131 --> 01:27:23,126
Whenever we feed him, it either comes
right back up or he coughs and he turns blue.

1054
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:27,846
We don't have to see him. Just tell that
half-assed hospital to get some Lipiodol

1055
01:27:27,933 --> 01:27:29,807
and we'll take some X-rays.

1056
01:27:29,893 --> 01:27:31,969
We can't get near that place.

1057
01:27:32,062 --> 01:27:36,190
With a civilian, the colonel has a big thing
about it, especially a "native".

1058
01:27:36,275 --> 01:27:40,403
Then don't tell him any more than necessary.
Tell him the pros have an emergency.

1059
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:46,241
Tell him to get the OR ready and Trapper
and I'll fix his tracheo-oesophageal fistula.

1060
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:51,451
OK, Me Lay, put him down in here.

1061
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:54,079
Get him to sleep
as quick as you can, will you?

1062
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:56,660
- Where did this baby come from?
- Watch him.

1063
01:27:56,754 --> 01:27:59,043
- Is this what you got us up for?
- Yeah.

1064
01:27:59,132 --> 01:28:03,046
We stumbled on him. We don't want him,
but we can't back away from him.

1065
01:28:03,553 --> 01:28:06,009
This time I will not be intimidated.

1066
01:28:06,098 --> 01:28:10,012
I command that this illegal use
of army facilities cease immediately!

1067
01:28:10,102 --> 01:28:13,222
On this point I stand as firm as
the Rock of Gibraltar.

1068
01:28:13,313 --> 01:28:16,065
And furthermore I... You can't do this...

1069
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:26,532
- This one is for West Point.
- What the Sam Hill's going on here?

1070
01:28:26,619 --> 01:28:30,533
That's what they all say.
What a filthy, disgusting, despicable...

1071
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,377
There's no competition to the Painless Pole,
but it's pretty healthy.

1072
01:28:36,462 --> 01:28:42,466

01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:56,379
No, I mean he's going to be all right, isn't he?

Oh, ask around.

Hey, Duke. Come on. Open up, man.

Who is it?

1099
01:30:29,372 --> 01:30:33,370
- What the hell you doing back here?
- We've been working for hours. Open up.

1100
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:35,867
Wait a minute. I'll be right with you.

1101
01:30:46,056 --> 01:30:47,716
- Hi, Hot Lips.
- You miss us?

1102
01:30:51,728 --> 01:30:53,805
Shame, shame on you.

1103
01:30:56,942 --> 01:30:57,973
Well...

1104
01:31:01,864 --> 01:31:03,940
- Radar.
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:31:05,368 --> 01:31:07,444
Hold this, please.

1106
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:15,206
- Colonel Blake.
- Henry? Yeah. Charlie here. Yeah.

1107
01:31:15,295 --> 01:31:20,040
I've got news for you. You were so concerned
about the battle for Old Baldy.

1108
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:24,427
- <i>Well, it's all over.</i>
- Oh, that's great news, General. Who won?

1109
01:31:24,513 --> 01:31:31,180
Oh, by the way, I have a report here, Henry,
from your chief nurse Major O'Houlihan.

1110
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:35,638
<i>She makes some accusations, Henry,</i>
<i>I find pretty hard to believe.</i>

1111
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:38,354
Don't believe 'em then. Thank you, goodbye.

1112
01:31:38,444 --> 01:31:39,986
Yeah... What?

1113
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:42,988
- Thank you, Radar.
- You're welcome, sir.

I'll be with Colonel Blake. Check this place
out. See what the nurses are like, huh?

1121
01:32:14,732 --> 01:32:16,808
Right, sir.

1122
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:20,438
- 4077th Mobile Army Surgi...
- Yeah, yeah.

1123
01:32:20,613 --> 01:32:23,068
- Sir, d'you know...
- Yes, I know where he is.

1124
01:32:23,157 --> 01:32:24,402
Oh. All right.

1125
01:32:25,034 --> 01:32:27,110
All right.

1126
01:32:27,912 --> 01:32:30,154
- Thank you.
- Look, Charlie,

1127
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:34,917
you can't blame Henry because
Hot Lips Houlihan can't stand her name!

1128
01:32:35,003 --> 01:32:38,169
You know, she's just a lady though.
What the hell?

1129
01:32:38,256 --> 01:32:43,167
Come on, for crying out loud. She's
regular army. She's a fanatic about ritual.

1130
01:32:43,261 --> 01:32:45,468
She won't even let us play football.

1131
01:32:45,555 --> 01:32:48,640
- Football?
- General, she's all lined up, Charlie.

1132
01:32:48,725 --> 01:32:51,643
Yeah. I didn't know you had a football team.

1133
01:32:51,728 --> 01:32:54,433
It's pretty much in the planning stage.

1134
01:32:54,523 --> 01:32:56,848
No, no, we have a very fine football team.

1135
01:32:56,942 --> 01:33:01,485
Yeah? Well, we had a team
back with the 325th Evac last year.

1136
01:33:01,572 --> 01:33:05,949
- And what a team that was.
- Yeah. I coached the boys myself.

1137
01:33:06,452 --> 01:33:09,239
- He's the finest coach in the Far East.
- Yeah.

1138
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:13,494
We're trying to work out a schedule
of the outfits we're gonna play this year.

1139
01:33:13,584 --> 01:33:18,294
Of course, we, you know, throw
a little money into a pot and make bets.

1140
01:33:18,381 --> 01:33:21,631
How much... how much money
do you put into your pot?

1141
01:33:21,718 --> 01:33:25,419
- Five thousand, six thousand.
- Five thousand dollars!

1142
01:33:25,972 --> 01:33:29,092
Look, I don't think we're in
the sort of league you're in.

1143
01:33:29,184 --> 01:33:32,933
Well, I'm sure we can find a date
when we can play your team.

1144
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:37,102
- It can be arranged.
- Yeah. I think I'll talk this over with Henry.

1145
01:33:37,192 --> 01:33:39,232
Thanks, boys. Thanks for the drink.

1146
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,190
- Thank you.
- What the hell you...?

1147
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:47,323
Sir, ever since the dark days before Pearl
Harbor, I've been proud to wear this uniform.

1148
01:33:47,411 --> 01:33:49,488
- What the hell is this?
- A helicopter.

1149
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:52,914
That man has five times
the manpower to draw on than we do.

1150
01:33:53,001 --> 01:33:56,037
Sure, so we get ourselves a ringer, right?

1151
01:33:56,129 --> 01:34:00,921
We get Henry to apply, make
a specific application for a neurosurgeon.

1152
01:34:01,009 --> 01:34:04,627
He asks for Dr Oliver Harmon Jones.

1153
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:09,383
- Dr Oliver Harmon Jones?
- Oh, he's... Who is Oliver Harmon Jones?

1154
01:34:09,476 --> 01:34:13,972
He is better known as Spearchucker Jones.

1155
01:34:14,064 --> 01:34:18,109
- He's a good ballplayer.
- Yes! That Negro boy, played with the 49ers.

1156
01:34:18,193 --> 01:34:20,519
- Sure.
- Sure, I remember. He's good.

1157
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:26,200
Henry, if we had closer relations, we wouldn't
have this misunderstanding, right?

1158
01:34:26,285 --> 01:34:30,449
Now, that's where a football game
would help between your outfit and mine.

1159
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,998
A football game?

1160
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:35,997
We put up a few bets,
five thousand maybe, and have a little fun.

1161
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:39,503
Special Services in Tokyo
says it's one of our best gimmicks

1162
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:42,129
to keep the American
way of life going in Asia.

1163
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,840
- Betting?
- No! Football.

1164
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,088
But what about Major O'Houlihan?

1165
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:50,017
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her!

1166
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:53,222
- It's a helicopter, General.
- I know it's a helicopter!

1167
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,941
I just wondered
about the social problem, you know.

1168
01:34:57,026 --> 01:35:01,403
I mean, he's the only Negro officer
in the whole camp, you know.

1169
01:35:01,489 --> 01:35:04,822
We got a problem,
we'll stick him in with us, baby boy.

1170
01:35:06,786 --> 01:35:09,906
- You're serious, ain't you?
- Sure, I'm serious.

1171
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:16,997
It's enough for me to have to put up with
you two Yankees, but I'm, you know, that's...

1172
01:35:19,049 --> 01:35:22,252
Because of his wife,
or was it a religious problem?

1173
01:35:22,344 --> 01:35:25,547
- It was a conditioning problem.
- Why you called Spearchucker?

1174
01:35:25,639 --> 01:35:27,797
I used to throw the javelin.

1175
01:35:34,356 --> 01:35:37,725
Right, we're not here to sell lemonade,
we're here to practise.

1176
01:35:37,818 --> 01:35:41,686
But first let's welcome Spearchucker.
Is it all right to call you that?

1177
01:35:41,781 --> 01:35:43,239
Call me whatever you want.

1178
01:35:43,324 --> 01:35:48,319
I want you to know we're all the same here
on the playing field, officers and men alike.

1179
01:35:48,412 --> 01:35:52,078
Now, we're going to begin
with the three basic principles:

1180
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:55,333
Organisation, discipline and teamwork. Now...

1181
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:59,998
- Pardon me. Mind if we limber up first?
- That's a good idea. You organise that.

1182
01:36:02,761 --> 01:36:07,174
<i>?</i> Move that line, hey!
Hold that line, hey!

1183
01:36:07,265 --> 01:36:11,429
All right, Seidman, keep 'em pushin'
that whatever you call it.

1184
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,565
That's good. All right, Hot Lips,
keep their arms and limbs moving.

1185
01:36:17,901 --> 01:36:22,231
Radar, you're a coach.
You're not a corporal, you're a coach,

1186
01:36:22,323 --> 01:36:25,941
so keep them going through there.
Good, Hot Lips.

1187
01:36:26,035 --> 01:36:28,193
All right, Seidman, give 'em five.

1188
01:36:28,287 --> 01:36:31,324
All right, men, take five. Spearchucker.

1189
01:36:36,671 --> 01:36:38,747
We look pretty lousy, don't we?

1190
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,968
For college players that have been
out of training for seven years, yeah, you do.

1191
01:36:43,053 --> 01:36:45,211
I got an idea how we can make some money.

1192
01:36:45,305 --> 01:36:50,263
We leave him out of the first half. We bet half
our money. They roll up some points, OK?

1193
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:53,104
Second half we stick him in.
We get odds from them.

1194
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:55,347
We bet the other half. We clean up.

1195
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:58,228
- Good thinking, Captain.
- Sounds good to me.

1196
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:01,688
Oh, and I had another idea.
I think we should have some plays.

1197
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:04,698
Usually in football you have organised plays.

1198
01:37:04,784 --> 01:37:08,200
- Well, if you don't mind, I took the liberty.
- Oh, you have.

1199
01:37:08,287 --> 01:37:11,039
- I drew up seven or eight plays.
- Oh, these are good.

1200
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:17,661
- I think that's all this bunch can handle.
- Oh, very good. Yes. Oh, very, very good.

1201
01:37:17,755 --> 01:37:19,547
What are these little arrows?

1202
01:37:57,172 --> 01:37:59,081
Right into his hands!

1203
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:18,569
- Well, it's only six points.
- Six points!

1204
01:38:26,494 --> 01:38:28,118
- It's only one point.
- One point!

1205
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:30,695
Who's that number one? We can't stop him.

1206
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:34,040
They call him Super Bug.
He had one year with the Rams.

1207
01:38:34,127 --> 01:38:37,875
- We can't do anything with him in there.
- You gotta come in. We can't wait.

1208
01:38:37,964 --> 01:38:42,044
No, we stick to our strategy,
but you gotta get him out of the ball game.

1209
01:38:42,135 --> 01:38:44,626
Hey, Davidson! Here!

1210
01:38:44,721 --> 01:38:48,589
Let's ease up just a little bit.
We don't want the score too lopsided.

1211
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:57,397
He caught it!

1212
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:12,868
- Who's he giving it to?
- Isn't that Corporal Judson?

1213
01:39:12,959 --> 01:39:15,664
Judson's a lineman! Judson can't run!

1214
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:24,886
For crying out loud, Judson,
what're you doin'?

1215
01:39:24,971 --> 01:39:30,974
- Duke, you threw me that ball!
- You had the field open! Why'd you fall?

1216
01:39:31,061 --> 01:39:33,766
I'm no goddamn runner, I'm a lineman.

1217
01:39:35,691 --> 01:39:37,814
We're gonna really clean up today.

1218
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:53,325
- Ah, it's only two points.
- Two points.

1219
01:39:53,418 --> 01:39:57,001
- What d'you think you are, a cannon?
- What kind of a snap was that?

1220
01:39:57,088 --> 01:40:00,089
We got a lot of money on this game.
This is embarrassing!

1221
01:40:08,809 --> 01:40:12,509
Let's go! Yeah!

1222
01:40:12,604 --> 01:40:15,226
- What happens now?
- We get a free kick.

1223
01:40:15,315 --> 01:40:17,641
A free kick! Girls!

1224
01:40:17,735 --> 01:40:22,313
<i>?</i> Hit that ball! Kick that ball!

1225
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:50,132
- Another six points.
- Another six points.

1226
01:40:54,231 --> 01:40:56,639
Look. Look. He's hurt.

1227
01:40:56,734 --> 01:40:58,726
He's leaving the game!

1228
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:02,437
<i>?</i> He's hurt! He's hurt!
He's leaving the game! He's hurt!

1229
01:41:02,656 --> 01:41:06,441
<i>?</i> He's hurt! He's hurt!
He's leaving the game! He's hurt!

1230
01:41:06,535 --> 01:41:09,109
What the hell's the matter with you? Smith!

1231
01:41:09,205 --> 01:41:13,155
- Those damn bastards pulled something.
- Coach, did I break my 400?

1232
01:41:13,251 --> 01:41:18,127
400! This is not a track meet. This is a football
game. What d'you think I pay you for?

1233
01:41:18,214 --> 01:41:20,836
Get him up. Walk him around. Do something.

1234
01:41:20,925 --> 01:41:25,635
- I think I won the 440.
- 440! This is a football game, goddammit!

1235
01:41:32,437 --> 01:41:35,308
All right, you guys, get in there and kill 'em!

1236
01:41:47,411 --> 01:41:50,745
All right, bub, your fuckin' head
is comin' right off.

1237
01:42:00,592 --> 01:42:02,631
- I'm ready, Coach.
- Ready for what?

1238
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,384
- I'm in the broad jump, Coach.
- Get him back on the bench. Broad jump!

1239
01:42:06,765 --> 01:42:09,968
- Still 16 to nothing.
- 16 to nothing.

1240
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:13,511
Well, that's not bad.
16 to nothing in the first half.

1241
01:42:13,605 --> 01:42:16,013
I have to give them the old Knute Rockne.

1242
01:42:16,108 --> 01:42:18,646
- About time for the gun.
- Right.

1243
01:42:24,492 --> 01:42:29,996
Men, ever since the dark days before Pearl
Harbor, I've been proud to wear this uniform.

1244
01:42:30,081 --> 01:42:32,572
- Got a towel?
- Henry, have you pressed the bets?

1245
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:35,668
- Today we are wearing...
- Have you pressed the bets?

1246
01:42:35,753 --> 01:42:39,169
Oh, the bets! Finish the half-time speech.

1247
01:42:40,216 --> 01:42:43,383
<i>?</i> Hit 'em with a mortar!
Kick 'em off the hill!

1248
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:46,886
<i>?</i> Mash 'em! Smash 'em!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

1249
01:42:46,973 --> 01:42:50,592
Hot Lips! There's a time
and a place for everything, dammit!

1250
01:42:50,686 --> 01:42:52,892
Oh! Right. Bo-bo.

1251
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:54,225
<i>?</i> Bo! Bo!

1252
01:42:54,314 --> 01:42:56,603
Come on, Smitty. Come on, boy.

1253
01:42:59,153 --> 01:43:03,779
- What's the matter with him?
- You oughta know. You pulled something.

1254
01:43:03,866 --> 01:43:07,318
- I guess you don't wanna double the bet.
- The hell I don't.

1255
01:43:07,411 --> 01:43:10,247
We beat you without him,
and we'll go on beating you.

1256
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:14,744
- Are you prepared to back that up with odds?
- Damn right. Three to one. Double the bet.

1257
01:43:28,183 --> 01:43:30,092
Player 24, who is he?

1258
01:43:32,646 --> 01:43:34,057
Stop him!

1259
01:43:35,816 --> 01:43:40,277
Stop him! Stop him! Who is that guy?
He wasn't in the game in the first half.

1260
01:43:40,362 --> 01:43:42,438
Stop him!

1261
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:54,406
- That's Spearchucker Jones.
- Who?

1262
01:43:54,502 --> 01:43:58,915
He played with San Francisco before he
got drafted. He's gonna be tough to stop, too.

1263
01:43:59,007 --> 01:44:01,462
Henry, you brought in a ringer, did you?

1264
01:44:01,551 --> 01:44:06,593
- Radar, what's the general trying to say?
- Didn't bring him in in the first half!

1265
01:44:06,681 --> 01:44:10,845
He's just been informed
as to the identity of our Spearchucker.

1266
01:44:10,936 --> 01:44:15,681
- His ringer's spotted our ringer.
- How do you like them apples, Charlie?

1267
01:44:15,774 --> 01:44:20,353
- You can't trust anybody.
- Now watch him make the extra point.

1268
01:44:26,285 --> 01:44:27,530
Isn't that illegal?

1269
01:45:13,042 --> 01:45:17,503
What kind of team is it?
They're falling all around like dead flies!

1270
01:45:26,723 --> 01:45:30,092
Look! A red flag! We've got a red flag!

1271
01:45:30,185 --> 01:45:32,261
Hot Lips!

1272
01:45:33,397 --> 01:45:35,271
It's a penalty, you idiot.

1273
01:45:42,782 --> 01:45:46,910
Judson, get off of him.
You'll be thrown out of the game.

1274
01:45:46,994 --> 01:45:48,868
Judson, kill him!

1275
01:45:56,004 --> 01:45:59,918
What's wrong with you?
We're here to play football, not fight!

1276
01:46:02,677 --> 01:46:05,168
Bastard 88 called me a coon.

1277
01:46:05,263 --> 01:46:07,589
Called you a what?

1278
01:46:07,683 --> 01:46:09,841
Coon.

1279
01:46:09,935 --> 01:46:13,636
OK, that's an old pro trick
to get you thrown out of the ball game.

1280
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:17,396
- Why don't you do the same thing to him?
- What, call him a coon?

1281
01:46:17,484 --> 01:46:21,814
No, the boys in camp used to talk about
his sister. Her name was Gladys. Use it!

1282
01:46:23,866 --> 01:46:26,108
- Yeah.
- All right, all right.

1283
01:46:44,805 --> 01:46:47,971
What the hell are you doing, for God's sake?

1284
01:46:48,058 --> 01:46:50,134
What's the matter here?

1285
01:46:50,561 --> 01:46:52,637
They're takin' him out.

1286
01:46:59,236 --> 01:47:01,312
<i>?</i> 69 is divine!

1287
01:47:01,697 --> 01:47:04,105
<i>?</i> 69 is divine!

1288
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:09,028
There you go, Charlie. Another
side of beef for your butcher shop.

1289
01:47:09,122 --> 01:47:11,245
<i>?</i> Let's get the ball and really go

1290
01:47:11,332 --> 01:47:12,992
<i>?</i> Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

1291
01:47:13,084 --> 01:47:16,204
- Who's the brunette? She new?
- Yeah, I had her shipped in.

1292
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:19,499
Yeah. Not bad.
Kill 'em! Kill 'em, goddammit!

1293
01:47:23,762 --> 01:47:26,335
My God! They've shot him!

1294
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:30,299
Hot Lips, you incredible nincompoop,
it's the end of the quarter.

1295
01:47:30,394 --> 01:47:33,810
What did I make you a major for?
For a team like that?

1296
01:47:33,897 --> 01:47:36,815
I did the best I could.
I didn't know they'd get a ringer.

1297
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:40,566
- I ought to put you in and let 'em kill you.
- What about my knee?

1298
01:47:40,654 --> 01:47:44,735
You better get on your goddamn knee
and start prayin'. Trick knee, my ass.

1299
01:48:16,942 --> 01:48:18,436
My God!

1300
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:30,489
- How's that?
- Did you see that?

1301
01:48:30,581 --> 01:48:33,618
Get the hell back there. Get back there.

1302
01:48:57,443 --> 01:49:01,275
Well, looks like we may make it.
Seconds to go.

1303
01:49:01,363 --> 01:49:04,483
OK, fellows,
we don't have very much time left.

1304
01:49:04,575 --> 01:49:07,493
I got a special play I wanna run,
a semi-eligible play.

1305
01:49:07,578 --> 01:49:11,078
Line up with everybody to the right
of the centre except Hawkeye,

1306
01:49:11,165 --> 01:49:14,001
who drops back one yard
before the snap of the ball.

1307
01:49:14,085 --> 01:49:19,127
That makes you the semi-eligible. Just take
the ball from Trapper between your legs

1308
01:49:19,215 --> 01:49:25,171
and hide it under your belly and walk
toward their goal. Right? Now, Trapper...

1309
01:49:25,263 --> 01:49:27,671
All right. Come on.

1310
01:49:27,766 --> 01:49:32,309
- This is only one time. $5,000.
- Worth a try.

1311
01:49:32,396 --> 01:49:36,773
- It'd be a miracle.

- Two dollars
- Two dollars.

1317
01:51:34,732 --> 01:51:36,808
Four dollars.

1318
01:51:37,276 --> 01:51:39,352
Out. I fold.

1319
01:51:41,155 --> 01:51:43,231
Raise you two.

1320

Raise it another two?

1321
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:49,953
- I have an Oklahoma.
- Oh, God!

1322
01:51:53,042 --> 01:51:56,328
- What is that?
- Two eights, a ten of spades, a deuce, a five.

1323
01:51:56,421 --> 01:51:59,173
- You win!
- What do you have?

1324
01:51:59,257 --> 01:52:04,252
<i>Tokyo. The United States</i>
<i>Armed Forces Radio is on the air.</i>

Duke? You busy?

1326
01:52:41,885 --> 01:52:46,049
- What is it?
- Henry's got our orders. We can go home.

1327
01:52:58,152 --> 01:53:01,852
- Right now?
- Any time. Whenever we want.

1328
01:53:02,323 --> 01:53:05,407
D'you mind if we get out
of this guy's brain first?

1329
01:53:09,789 --> 01:53:13,205
Can't you sew this thing up?
You got that vessel under control.

1330
01:53:13,293 --> 01:53:16,993
- I just...
- Haven't you?

1331
01:53:17,088 --> 01:53:22,213
- I wanna make sure the oozing is checked.
- Damn perfectionist.

1332
01:53:24,054 --> 01:53:26,130
Yeah, well, I'm...

1333
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,839
I'll see you.

1334
01:53:33,438 --> 01:53:38,184
Five goddamn months and they don't even
give a guy time off for good behaviour.

1335
01:53:38,277 --> 01:53:41,361
Hey, see you around.

1336
01:53:41,447 --> 01:53:43,523
It's possible.

1337
01:53:43,616 --> 01:53:45,692
Take care of the squirrels.

1338
01:53:51,749 --> 01:53:53,825
So long, Pup-Pup.

1339
01:53:56,296 --> 01:54:00,590
Will you go, for Christ's sakes? Go before
they change their minds. Get outta here!

1340
01:54:00,675 --> 01:54:06,630
Oh, God, listen favourably to our prayers
and with your right hand bless this jeep.

1341
01:54:06,723 --> 01:54:11,848
Send your holy angels so that all who ride
in it may be delivered from every danger.

1342
01:54:11,937 --> 01:54:16,398
And as you granted faith and grace by your
deacon Philip to the man from Ethiopia,

1343
01:54:16,483 --> 01:54:19,687
who was sitting in his chariot
reading holy scripture,

1344
01:54:19,778 --> 01:54:22,400
show the way of salvation to your servants,

1345
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:26,190
so that, helped by your grace
and always intent on doing good works,

1346
01:54:26,285 --> 01:54:30,117
they may, after all the trials
of their pilgrimage and life on earth,

1347
01:54:30,206 --> 01:54:34,785
attain to everlasting joys
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

1348
01:54:36,171 --> 01:54:40,465
- Captain Pierce, your driver'll be here soon.
- He's here.

1349
