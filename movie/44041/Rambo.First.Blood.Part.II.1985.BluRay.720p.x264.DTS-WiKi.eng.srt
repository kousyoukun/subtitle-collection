1
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,333
Let's keep those hammers working.

2
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:02,589
Rambo!

3
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:06,409
Let's go.

4
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,941
How are you, Johnny?

5
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:32,351
Good.

6
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,049
That's all.

7
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,610
John, I'm sorry they sent
you to such a hellhole.

8
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:43,934
I've seen worse.

9
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:45,361
Yeah, you have, haven't you...

10
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:49,349
John, I told you that
I'd help you when I could.

11
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:51,737
Are you interested?

12
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:58,604
You can't possibly wanna
stay here for another five years.

13
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:08,299
In here at least, I know where I stand.

14
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,624
Just hear me out first.

15
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:14,774
A covert operation is being
geared up in the Far East.

16
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:16,638
Your name was dug
out of computer as one of

17
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,671
three most able to complete the mission.

18
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:21,961
Mission?

19
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:24,091
Recon for POWs in Nam.

20
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:31,170
Why now? Why me?

21
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,214
The prison camp you escaped
from in '71 is the target area.

22
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:38,809
Nobody knows that
terrain better than you do.

23
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,218
The risk factor is very high.

24
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,480
You'd be temporarily
reinstated in the Forces,

25
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,202
and if the mission's successful,

26
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:47,377
there may be a presidential pardon.

27
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,801
You interested?

28
00:02:58,632 --> 00:02:59,563
Yeah.

29
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:04,463
Good...good. I'll get
the necessary clearance.

30
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,241
The next time we meet,
it will be in Thailand

31
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:09,860
with the Special Ops designate
who runs the operation.

32
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,230
Yes, Sir.

33
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,451
- All clear?
- Yes.

34
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:17,063
John, I want you to know that I did
what I could to keep you outta here.

35
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:18,346
I know.

36
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:20,850
Yeah.

37
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:21,899
Sir?

38
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,342
Do we get to win this time?

39
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,104
This time, it's up to you...

40
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:44,777
That'll be all.

41
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,451
How you doin', Rambo? I'm Ericson.

42
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,962
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

43
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,153
You're the chosen one, huh?

44
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:59,242
You made a helluva rep'
for yourself in Nam!

45
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,960
Anyway, I'm glad to be workin' with you.

46
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:06,712
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint!

47
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,400
He's here.

48
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:18,528
- Morning, John.
- Sir.

49
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,347
This is Marshal Murdock. He's in charge
of Special Operations from Wahington.

50
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:23,254
Thank you, Colonel.

51
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:25,417
Rambo, been looking
forward to meeting you.

52
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,979
How was your trip? No problems?

53
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,807
No.

54
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,590
Except for the damned heat, right?

55
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,126
Never felt anything like it!

56
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,405
Come on in, let's get down to business!

57
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,178
I was glancing over your files.

58
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:41,936
Makes some pretty interesting reading!

59
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:50,595
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47,

60
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,918
Bowie, Arizona, of
Indian-German descent.

61
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,932
That's a helluva combination!

62
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,154
Joined the army 8.6.64,

63
00:06:57,402 --> 00:07:00,315
accepted special forces,
specialization: light weapons.

64
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,469
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

65
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:07,484
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver
stars, 4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

66
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:10,147
distinguished service cross,
and Medal of Honor.

67
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:12,775
You got around, didn't ya?

68
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,340
Incredible!

69
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:19,122
Rambo, you're probably aware
that there's almost 2.500 Americans

70
00:07:19,174 --> 00:07:21,293
still Missing In Action
in South-East Asia.

71
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,073
Most of these boys are presumed killed,

72
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,920
but to the legal families,
Congress and lots of Americans,

73
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:28,139
it's still a very emotional issue.

74
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,008
Gimme something cold, please!

75
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:34,850
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

76
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:39,648
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.

77
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,770
I lost a lot of good men, so I know
what you and every vet feels now.

78
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,114
Maybe the government didn't care,

79
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:48,107
maybe certain segments of
the population didn't care,

80
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,321
but my committee cares.

81
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:51,505
So what his commitee needs is

82
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:53,836
exclusive proof that
Americans are being held.

83
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,746
Once done, rest sure we'll get 'em back.

84
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,859
Now, if there's any of our
men at this POW target camp,

85
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,454
you'll confirm their presence
by taking photographs.

86
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:03,836
Photographs?

87
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:04,730
Just photographs.

88
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:08,020
Under no circumstances are
you to engage the enemy.

89
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm supposed to leave'em there?

90
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,760
I repeat: do not engage the enemy.

91
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,355
Phase 2, Delta Force assault
team led by Colonel Trautman

92
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:18,556
will handle the extraction.

93
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,059
Okay?

94
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:27,981
Anyway, I'd just like to say that
I feel with your participation,

95
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:30,640
this mission has a
better than average chance

96
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,528
to succeed where others have failed.

97
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,097
I'll meet you both in the
operations center in one hour.

98
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,471
From Thailand, across Laos, into the
mountains of Vietnam, to the drop zone.

99
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,645
You'll be flying a ceiling of
250 feet when you bail out.

100
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,069
- Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.

101
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,142
Since you're going in solo,

102
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:09,219
you'll have to rely on more
equipment than you ever used before.

103
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:10,793
And use it!

104
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:13,713
What I'm sayin' is don't try
the blood-and-guts routine.

105
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:16,275
Let technology do most of the work.

106
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,888
John, I want you to
try to forget the war.

107
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:20,420
Remember the mission.

108
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,193
The old Vietnam's dead.

109
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:25,611
Sir, I'm alive, it's
still alive, ain't it?

110
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:40,729
You may find this hard to
believe, but all this is for you!

111
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,325
Impressed?

112
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,307
Besides modern computer
devices you can see here,

113
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:46,375
you'll be issued every
other modern piece

114
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:48,716
of equipment we have
to ensure your safety.

115
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:51,291
Rambo, you can feel totally
safe because we have the

116
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,035
most advanced weapons in
the world available to us.

117
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,016
I've always believed that
the mind's the best weapon.

118
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,571
Times change.

119
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,628
For some people.

120
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:04,347
Don't let me interrupt you, Colonel.

121
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:07,252
Upon insertion, call in
to base camp on Transat.

122
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,052
Then proceed to Point Hawk September
to rendezvous with the ground contact:

123
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,791
indigenous agent Co Bao.

124
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:14,669
Is he listening?

125
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,060
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

126
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,405
Colonel!

127
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:30,997
Are you sure he's still not
unbalanced from the war?

128
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,297
We can't afford to have him
involved in this mission,

129
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,933
he might crack under
the pressure in that hell!

130
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,394
Pressure?

131
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,963
Let me just say that Rambo is the
best combat vet I've ever seen.

132
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:44,247
A pure fighting machine with only a
desire to win a war that someone else lost.

133
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,987
If winning means he has to
die, he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

134
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:52,786
And...one more thing:

135
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:57,875
What you choose to call
"Hell", he calls home!

136
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,853
Stand by!
Start A.P.U.!

137
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,590
D minus 20.

138
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,213
D minus 5.

139
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:21,435
You got 36 hours to
get the hell in and out.

140
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,259
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

141
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:24,303
Yeah.

142
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:26,740
If you run into any
trouble, try to get to the

143
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:29,266
hilltop extraction site
marked on your map.

144
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,671
Ready to roll, Colonel.

145
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,664
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

146
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:39,968
Let's go!

147
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:44,678
Remember Murdock said he'd
been with the 2nd Battalion,

148
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,400
third Marines in Kon Tum in '66?

149
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:48,757
Yeah.

150
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,136
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

151
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,914
You're the only one I trust.

152
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,699
- Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

153
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:42,855
But there's people to satisfy,

154
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,825
questions that have to be answered.

155
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:48,443
You don't sound too
emotional about it...

156
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,104
It wasn't my war, Colonel.

157
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,738
I'm just here to clean up the mess!

158
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,049
AWACS two-five has acquired.

159
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,124
They're holding timeline.

160
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,466
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

161
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:19,685
Back in the badlands, my man!

162
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:22,508
Stand by your position!

163
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,557
- Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!

164
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,044
Five seconds!

165
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,192
Four...

166
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:42,131
Three...

167
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,175
Two...

168
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,324
Jumper away.

169
00:15:58,454 --> 00:15:59,495
Shit, what's happening?

170
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,278
A turbulence! He's hung up!

171
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:04,906
He'll be torn apart!

172
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,931
Condition Red! He's hung up!

173
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,977
- What do you mean he's hung up?
- What's happening?

174
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,449
He's being dragged!

175
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:14,787
Lifer cut him loose!

176
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,222
I can't free him!

177
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,061
Ericson, abort the mission! Pull out.

178
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,046
That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

179
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,296
He's cutting away his equipment.

180
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,643
He's out!

181
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,176
Come in here, this is Dragonfly
one. Do you read me, over?

182
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,480
Dragonfly one, come in, I read you.

183
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:08,715
- Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.

184
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,962
Maybe the smartest thing
to do is to abort the mission

185
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:20,180
right now before there's
any more complications.

186
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:22,162
I mean who could've
survived something like that?

187
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,946
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

188
00:17:24,403 --> 00:17:26,581
He's got 36 hours to
complete the mission,

189
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,655
and reach the extraction point.

190
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,600
- We owe him that.
- Of course, we do!

191
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,891
But understand something
now: in 36 hours, we pull out!

192
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:23,539
Rambo!

193
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:40,059
You did not expect a woman, no?

194
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:44,567
We'd better go.

195
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:50,579
We go to river. How come you so late?

196
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:53,512
Got hung up.

197
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:02,951
I have arranged boat to take
us down river. Old ways not safe.

198
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:07,226
You come a long way,
Rambo, to see empty camp.

199
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,649
You're using pirates?

200
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:06,207
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

201
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:29,839
What about patrol boats?

202
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,151
Russian.

203
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,688
Rambo!

204
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:23,613
Want to eat?

205
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,057
Maybe later.

206
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:38,103
How you get into this?

207
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,995
- It's a long story.
- Long ride.

208
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:50,474
Well...after I left the
Special Forces, I...

209
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:55,039
...moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?

210
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:57,118
I...

211
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:00,726
...came back to the States,

212
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:03,507
and found another war going on.

213
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:07,369
What war?

214
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,109
Kind of like a quiet war.

215
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:16,633
A war against...all
the soldiers returning.

216
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:18,225
It's the kind of war you don't win.

217
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:23,500
It's...

218
00:24:24,336 --> 00:24:25,796
It's my problem.

219
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,091
How about you? How did you get into it?

220
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:31,857
My father worked for intelligence agency.

221
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,900
He killed, and I take his place.

222
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:39,624
There's too much death here.

223
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,824
Death everywhere.

224
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,135
I just want to live, Rambo.

225
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:54,106
Maybe go America! Live the quiet life.

226
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:00,586
What you want?

227
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,691
To win...to survive...

228
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:11,234
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

229
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,738
To survive a war, you gotta become war.

230
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,203
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

231
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:23,333
Nah...

232
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:26,238
I am expendable.

233
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,116
Expendable?

234
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,181
What mean "expendable"?

235
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:34,543
It's like...

236
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:40,560
...someone invites you to
a party and you don't show up,

237
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:42,905
it doesn't really matter.

238
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,852
What's this?

239
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:54,568
It bring me good luck.

240
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,722
What bring you good luck?

241
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,205
I guess this.

242
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:16,673
No further report.

243
00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:18,374
I want to go up with the
extraction team at dawn.

244
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:20,825
- Denied.
- Denied?

245
00:26:21,282 --> 00:26:23,981
- It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

246
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:26,288
For Who?! We don't even
know if Rambo's alive!

247
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,512
The odds are against it.

248
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,085
You said we'd go through as planned.

249
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:35,564
Okay, if you want to go
through with it, we will.

250
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:38,304
The Colonel's gonna be
joining the extraction team.

251
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,284
You're a damned good man, Trautman!

252
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:43,185
See? Camp empty.

253
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:46,298
We move closer.

254
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:32,247
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

255
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:38,935
Come on!

256
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:57,718
- What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

257
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,931
You not going in there.

258
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,923
But I thought you're
supposed only to take pictures!

259
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,106
What about orders?

260
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:13,554
No more orders, Co.

261
00:32:57,383 --> 00:32:58,835
I've come to get you out.

262
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,156
Don't talk.

263
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:32,952
- There are others.
- I'll be back.

264
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:15,200
Fine?

265
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,524
Let's go!

266
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,747
You have clearance.

267
00:35:52,474 --> 00:35:54,029
Minus one hour to extraction.

268
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:58,078
I hope for his sake we're
not just wasting fuel...

269
00:35:58,577 --> 00:35:59,943
Let's get moving!

270
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,041
A good thing you came when you did.

271
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:26,034
Why is that?

272
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,629
They move us around a
lot, to harvest crops.

273
00:36:29,735 --> 00:36:31,059
Only been there a week.

274
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:33,253
When was the last time
you were in that camp?

275
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:34,742
A year...yeah.

276
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:37,141
What year is it, anyway?

277
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:38,736
1985.

278
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:44,711
Camp supposed to be empty.

279
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:47,724
Yeah, supposed to be...

280
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:48,664
Come on!

281
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:23,129
L.Z. two klicks up river.

282
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,746
- What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

283
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,611
You bastard!

284
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:07,691
All right, jump!

285
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:09,465
I fight!

286
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:11,499
Jump! Go on!

287
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:08,700
The gunboat!

288
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,672
Jump!

289
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,034
You made it, Rambo!

290
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:51,499
C'mon!

291
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,772
You take this. We go on from here.

292
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:22,673
- It better I stay to end.
- This is the end.

293
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:25,373
Go on, let's go!

294
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:27,697
Rambo!

295
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:31,225
You not expendable.

296
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,836
Colonel, 3 minutes.

297
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:10,726
That's Rambo!

298
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:18,739
Christ, he's found one!

299
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:51,408
Relay the command.
Rambo's found one of ours!

300
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:53,832
Mr Murdock, Dragonfly
reports that ground crew

301
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,802
has what appears to be an
American POW with them.

302
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,161
- What did you say???
- They've got one of ours!

303
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,100
Hey! Yeah! Yeah!

304
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:05,230
This station is now on Condition Bravo.
Harrison, Meyers, Goodell, out!

305
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,361
Everybody out!

306
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:08,447
Come on, move!

307
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,124
Go to your COMINT priority
frequency! Gimme the mike!

308
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:15,540
Dragonfly, this is Coach 1.

309
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:17,866
This is an Alpha-Kilo-Victor
command priority.

310
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,085
Come on!

311
00:44:24,614 --> 00:44:26,433
I want you to abort the
mission immediately!

312
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:29,050
I say again, this is a
recall. Confirm. Over.

313
00:44:29,156 --> 00:44:31,838
Say it again, coach 1, say it again.

314
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,872
I'm tellin' you to abort!

315
00:44:33,976 --> 00:44:35,019
Colonel!

316
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,191
I've been ordered to
abort before pick-up!

317
00:44:37,192 --> 00:44:39,601
Murdock, Murdock, for Christ
sake, we've got 'em in sight!

318
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:40,947
Murdock, do you read?

319
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:44,910
Come on!

320
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:47,420
- We're going down!
- You're not going anywhere.

321
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,548
You goddamned mercenaries!

322
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:55,541
There's men down there! OUR men!

323
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:58,856
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

324
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:07,993
Colonel!

325
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,986
Don't leave!

326
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,314
What are you doing? Do you
know what the hell you've done?

327
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:56,257
Don't act so innocent, Colonel!

328
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:58,901
You had your suspicions,
and if you suspected then,

329
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:00,622
you're sort of an accessory, aren't you?

330
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:02,733
Don't ever count me
with you and your scum!

331
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,431
It was a lie, wasn't it?

332
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,246
Juste like the whole
damn war. It was a lie!

333
00:46:08,452 --> 00:46:09,912
What are you talking about?

334
00:46:10,278 --> 00:46:12,989
That camp was supposed to be empty.

335
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:16,204
Rambo goes in, a decorated Vet,

336
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:19,124
he finds no POWs, the
Congress buys it, case closed.

337
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:21,790
And if he happens to get caught,
no one knows he's alive except

338
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:24,919
you and your computers, and you
can reprogram that, can't you?

339
00:46:25,057 --> 00:46:27,560
Who the hell do you think
you're talkin' to, Trautman?

340
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:30,674
A stinking bureaucrat
who's tryin' to cover his ass.

341
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:34,427
No, not just mine, Trautman!
We're talkin' about the nation's!

342
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,420
Besides, it was your hero's fault.
Now if your warrior had gone in,

343
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,504
and done what the hell
he was supposed to do,

344
00:46:39,585 --> 00:46:41,567
we'd be out of this clean and simple!

345
00:46:42,401 --> 00:46:44,382
He was just supposed to take pictures.

346
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:46,255
And if those pictures showed something,

347
00:46:46,256 --> 00:46:48,550
they would have been...
lost, wouldn't they?

348
00:46:49,278 --> 00:46:52,355
Oh, Trautman, I still don't think
you understand what this is all about.

349
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:54,146
The same as it always is: money.

350
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:58,573
In '72, we were supposed to pay the
Cong 4.5 billion in war reparations.

351
00:46:58,742 --> 00:47:01,349
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

352
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:04,380
And you're doing the
same thing all over again.

353
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:06,616
What the hell would you do, Trautman?

354
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:09,099
Pay blackmail money
to ransom our own men,

355
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,862
and finance the war
effort against our allies?

356
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:15,040
What if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

357
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:16,066
What you wanna do?

358
00:47:16,172 --> 00:47:18,413
Start the war all over again,
you wanna bomb Hanoi,

359
00:47:18,448 --> 00:47:20,795
wanna everybody screaming
for armed invasion?

360
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:23,663
You think civilians are gonna get up on
the floor of the United States Senate,

361
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:27,083
and ask for billions of dollars
for a couple of forgotten ghosts?

362
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:30,140
Men, goddamn it! Men who
fought for their country!

363
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:31,496
That's enough!

364
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:33,306
Trautman...

365
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:36,853
I'm gonna forget this
conversation ever took place.

366
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:40,115
You bastard!

367
00:47:40,742 --> 00:47:41,785
And if I were you,

368
00:47:41,956 --> 00:47:44,824
I'd never make the mistake of
bringing this subject up again!

369
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:46,961
You're the one who's making the mistake.

370
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:48,397
Yeah? What mistake?

371
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:51,116
Rambo.

372
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:52,750
Damned Russian bastards!

373
00:49:18,512 --> 00:49:20,025
He's dead now.

374
00:49:30,571 --> 00:49:32,127
Bring him up!

375
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:52,841
The knife!

376
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,368
These people are so
vulgar in their methods.

377
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:59,106
They lack compassion.

378
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,623
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

379
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:10,276
I do not know who you are yet,

380
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:12,184
but I will!

381
00:50:13,016 --> 00:50:14,594
Take him and clean him up.

382
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:50,771
That's all.

383
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:54,108
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

384
00:50:59,779 --> 00:51:01,702
I see you are no stranger to pain.

385
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:06,625
Perhaps you have been among
my Vietnamese comrades before?

386
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:11,277
No answer?

387
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:14,325
Do you wish to give your name?

388
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:17,643
What possible harm can that cause?

389
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:24,394
Pride is a poor
substitute for intelligence.

390
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,670
What you must understand is
that we have to interrogate you.

391
00:51:31,327 --> 00:51:32,505
To Sergeant Yushin here,

392
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,249
you're piece of meat,
a laboratory experiment.

393
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:39,505
But to me, you are a
comrade, similar to myself,

394
00:51:39,691 --> 00:51:42,949
just opposed by an act of fate.

395
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:48,896
I know you were trying to facilitate
the release of war criminals held

396
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:51,709
by this Republic. I can appreciate this.

397
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:56,606
But this incident, your capture, is...

398
00:51:58,599 --> 00:51:59,845
...embarrassing.

399
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:02,335
We must have explanation.

400
00:52:03,522 --> 00:52:06,029
First of all, I wish you to
radio your headquarters,

401
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:11,041
and say that you have been captured
and condemned for espionage activities,

402
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:16,133
and that no such criminal agression
should be attempted in the future!

403
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:20,493
Or they will meet with
the same fate as yours.

404
00:52:30,252 --> 00:52:31,600
Fuck you!

405
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:38,932
You wish to test your
strength...Good. Good!

406
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:43,719
Yushin!

407
00:53:43,995 --> 00:53:49,598
Comrade, here is something
that might be of interest to you:

408
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,738
a transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

409
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:57,444
and his commander we intercepted.

410
00:53:58,897 --> 00:54:03,256
"Dragonfly"... "Wolf's
Den"...colorful names!

411
00:54:04,168 --> 00:54:05,561
Here we are:

412
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,877
"We have them in sight".

413
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:12,867
And the reply: "Abort the
operation immediately."

414
00:54:14,173 --> 00:54:18,574
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over. "

415
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:22,883
It seems you were
abandoned by direct command.

416
00:54:24,363 --> 00:54:27,808
And these are the people
you protect...with your pain!

417
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:36,443
You may scream. There is no shame.

418
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:09,880
You are strong...Very strong!

419
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:12,476
The strongest so far.

420
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:16,356
But you're nearly dead! Poor waif.

421
00:55:16,936 --> 00:55:18,651
Make the radio call.

422
00:55:44,915 --> 00:55:48,154
To talk, to obey would
be so much easier.

423
00:56:02,264 --> 00:56:05,710
Yushin has a memento
for you of this occasion!

424
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:30,306
Put it in his eye.

425
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:41,933
If your own life means nothing
to you, then perhaps his does.

426
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:46,083
- Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.

427
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:57,040
Yes?

428
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,027
Don't do it!

429
00:57:36,414 --> 00:57:37,826
Do it!

430
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:39,527
Now!

431
00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:11,929
Two-two-O-five-six...

432
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:15,041
Lone Wolf, receive.

433
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,111
This is Lone Wolf, two-two-O-five-six

434
00:58:19,982 --> 00:58:22,057
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.

435
00:58:22,058 --> 00:58:24,030
Transmit location and status. Over.

436
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:25,282
What is it?

437
00:58:25,716 --> 00:58:27,140
It's Rambo, Sir.

438
00:58:28,783 --> 00:58:31,291
We read you, Lone Wolf.
What is your position? Over.

439
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:36,297
I say again: What is
your position? Over.

440
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:41,568
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

441
00:58:43,164 --> 00:58:44,928
Johnny, this is Trautman.
Where the hell are you?

442
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,487
John, come in!

443
00:59:00,475 --> 00:59:01,429
Murdock?

444
00:59:02,924 --> 00:59:04,460
He's here.

445
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:11,308
Rambo, this is Murdock,
we're glad you're alive!

446
00:59:12,055 --> 00:59:13,088
Where are you?

447
00:59:14,236 --> 00:59:16,414
Give us your position, and
we'll come to pick you up.

448
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:26,336
Murdock...

449
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:31,233
I'm comin' to get you!

450
01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:55,631
Duck!

451
01:03:00,802 --> 01:03:02,215
This way.

452
01:03:40,322 --> 01:03:42,104
We safe for now.

453
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,780
- You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.

454
01:03:51,859 --> 01:03:54,018
Maybe need this.

455
01:03:56,509 --> 01:03:59,580
- You hurt bad.
- It's alright.

456
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,882
Listen...

457
01:04:08,795 --> 01:04:11,867
What you did back there...

458
01:04:12,407 --> 01:04:14,689
...I won't forget it.

459
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,388
Thanks.

460
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:21,728
What you do now?

461
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:24,008
Try to get across to Thailand?

462
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,772
Yeah.

463
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:27,545
Then go America?

464
01:04:27,858 --> 01:04:28,810
Yeah.

465
01:04:34,866 --> 01:04:36,419
You take me with you?

466
01:04:48,148 --> 01:04:49,644
You take me?

467
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:53,380
Yeah.

468
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,029
I think you make good choice.

469
01:04:58,864 --> 01:04:59,802
Yeah.

470
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,950
- We go?
- Let's go.

471
01:05:40,162 --> 01:05:41,781
You alright?

472
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:58,595
Rambo...You...not...forget...me.

473
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:00,130
No.

474
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:02,113
No.

475
01:06:02,322 --> 01:06:03,260
No.

476
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:20,593
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

477
01:06:20,594 --> 01:06:21,742
You're risking your career,

478
01:06:21,743 --> 01:06:23,619
your reputation, and even
your family's security!

479
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:26,402
Do you honestly think any
one man's worth all that?

480
01:06:26,403 --> 01:06:27,237
Yes, I do.

481
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,830
I'm getting you a direct order
to withdraw from this project.

482
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:31,968
Do I get the rescue team
or do I go over your head?

483
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:33,894
You don't seem to understand something:

484
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:37,199
I'm in charge here. You're just a tool.

485
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:39,705
We're the machine.

486
01:06:40,932 --> 01:06:43,570
I want him placed under arrest.
He's not to leave the base.

487
01:06:48,302 --> 01:06:49,313
He never had a chance, did he?

488
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:52,202
Like you said, Colonel: he went home.

489
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:01,331
Yeah! Over here!

490
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:09,160
Get back!

491
01:21:13,929 --> 01:21:16,015
C'mon! Go to the chopper! Move, move!

492
01:21:18,046 --> 01:21:20,209
Go to the chopper!
Go to the chopper!

493
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:22,575
Move!

494
01:21:23,306 --> 01:21:24,349
Go to the chopper!

495
01:21:25,186 --> 01:21:26,229
That's it!

496
01:21:26,438 --> 01:21:27,481
Move, move, move!

497
01:21:29,569 --> 01:21:30,612
Hold on!

498
01:21:37,009 --> 01:21:38,468
C'mon! Move it, move it!

499
01:21:42,854 --> 01:21:44,209
Move, move, move, move!

500
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:54,649
A man at the gun!

501
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,811
Yeah, Yeah!

502
01:22:11,377 --> 01:22:12,629
You guys made it!

503
01:22:50,522 --> 01:22:51,773
Chopper on our tail!

504
01:22:54,656 --> 01:22:55,594
Hang on!

505
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:26,212
Hold on!

506
01:24:32,825 --> 01:24:34,389
Fire in the tail!

507
01:26:38,895 --> 01:26:40,772
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

508
01:26:42,466 --> 01:26:44,342
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

509
01:26:46,346 --> 01:26:49,058
Wolf's Den, this is
Lone wolf, do you read?

510
01:26:50,173 --> 01:26:51,946
Wolf's den, this is Lone Wolf, over.

511
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:53,823
Yes, we hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

512
01:26:54,734 --> 01:26:56,715
Prepare for emergency landing.

513
01:26:57,237 --> 01:26:59,323
Arriving with American POWs.

514
01:27:11,334 --> 01:27:12,168
You heard!

515
01:27:12,586 --> 01:27:14,463
Prepare for arriving POWs! Let's move!

516
01:28:32,322 --> 01:28:33,365
Glad you made it!

517
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,051
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

518
01:29:49,057 --> 01:29:51,039
I take'em, just like you.

519
01:29:55,345 --> 01:29:59,516
I swear to God I didn't know it
was supposed to happen like this.

520
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:02,268
It was just supposed to
be another assignment.

521
01:30:09,957 --> 01:30:11,000
Mission...

522
01:30:12,879 --> 01:30:13,922
...accomplished!

523
01:30:21,455 --> 01:30:23,540
You know there's more men out there.

524
01:30:24,527 --> 01:30:26,091
You know where they are.

525
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:30,409
Find'em...

526
01:30:30,723 --> 01:30:32,287
...or I'll find you!

527
01:30:55,403 --> 01:30:56,341
John!

528
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:58,740
Where are you going?

529
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,630
I don't know.

530
01:31:03,237 --> 01:31:05,322
You'll get a second
Medal of Honor for this.

531
01:31:13,883 --> 01:31:15,447
They should give it to them.

532
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,368
They deserve it more.

533
01:31:19,819 --> 01:31:22,530
You can't keep running,
John. You're free now.

534
01:31:23,804 --> 01:31:24,846
Come back with us.

535
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:28,168
Back to what?

536
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:31,491
My friends died here...

537
01:31:33,684 --> 01:31:35,143
Part of me died here...

538
01:31:37,173 --> 01:31:39,571
The war, everything that happened
here may have been wrong,

539
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:41,655
but dammit, don't
hate your country for it!

540
01:31:43,646 --> 01:31:44,584
Hate?

541
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:47,090
I'd die for it!

542
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:50,752
Then what is it you want?

543
01:31:56,515 --> 01:31:57,557
I want...

544
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:01,941
...what they want,

545
01:32:02,777 --> 01:32:06,010
and every other guy who came over here,

546
01:32:06,726 --> 01:32:11,523
and spilt his guts and gave
everything he had, wants...

547
01:32:12,995 --> 01:32:14,871
...for our country to love us...

548
01:32:15,858 --> 01:32:18,258
...as much as WE love it.

549
01:32:20,633 --> 01:32:22,093
That's what I want.

550
01:32:29,018 --> 01:32:30,582
How will you live, John?

551
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,250
Day by day.

552
01:32:32,251 --> 01:32:40,251
