2
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:52,604
Alexis.

3
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,953
One of the girls said
you were going soon.

4
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:13,325
Didn't think you'd
still be here.

5
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,629
Why don't you get comfortable?

6
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,870
Find yourself a
sugar daddy, did you?

7
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:26,571
No.

8
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,545
There's something better.

9
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:37,382
Keep going.

10
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:44,957
Mm.

11
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,927
Come closer.

12
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,902
What's wrong?

13
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:56,936
Nothing.

14
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,639
I'm just gonna miss this.

15
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,943
You don't have to go.

16
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,978
I've got a place. It's
small, but we can-

17
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:09,749
- Shh.

18
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,519
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

19
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:52,158
There's no shame in
coming back, you know.

20
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,793
Things change.

21
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,062
And you gotta roll with it.

22
00:03:57,797 --> 00:04:00,099
You thought you
wanted one thing, but,

23
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,901
actually, you wanted
something else.

24
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:03,936
It happens.

25
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,740
That's not for anyone
else to understand.

26
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,344
You make the change
work for you.

27
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:14,947
The girls miss you.

28
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:17,783
You know, Maura, she
can't shut up about you.

29
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,519
See?

30
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,989
You'll be fine.

31
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:23,890
With the girls.

32
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,994
You could be here if
you wanna be here.

33
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,030
Maybe you shouldn't think
too much about, you know,

34
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,033
why you left, and focus on

35
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,534
why you came back.

36
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,072
He didn't care about you

37
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,041
like I do.

38
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,044
He didn't, did he?

39
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:47,445
Say it.

40
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
He didn't care
about me like you.

41
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,554
That's all this is, Carly.

42
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,623
I'm just trying to
get you what you need.

43
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:02,061
You don't need to
hide around me.

44
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,030
No, I don't give a shit.

45
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:06,464
Be whoever the
fuck you wanna be,

46
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,100
as long as it doesn't
affect my cut.

47
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:12,204
That reminds me. It's still
400 a month for the room.

48
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:15,174
150 for bills, food,
water, the normal shit.

49
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,245
With that being said,
we've gotta take 20 pounds

50
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,047
on whatever you earn,
that's for protection.

51
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,181
No, don't look at me.

52
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:25,751
We all answer to
someone, you know?

53
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,657
It's for your
benefit, to be honest.

54
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,126
A lot of girls out there
are worse off than you lot.

55
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,528
Some girls don't get a choice.

56
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,565
Unless you want me to sell
you to some fuckin' sheik

57
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:41,566
with five chins.

58
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:45,671
Key cutter already thinks
I'm into human trafficking,

59
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:46,571
for fuck sake.

60
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:48,140
It's a joke.

61
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:51,243
Wait, it's a joke. Hey, come on.

62
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:53,679
Come on. I've
forgotten somethin'-

63
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,648
- Yeah, well it's
not fucking funny.

64
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,149
I know.

65
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,218
It was dumb. I did like
a ton of coke last night.

66
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,720
It scrambled my
eggs pretty badly.

67
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,021
We both know that's not it.

68
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,292
Yeah. Of course.

69
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:12,098
It was stupid.

70
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:14,033
I'm an arsehole.

71
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:20,706
What did you forget?

72
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:25,878
I've already got one.

73
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:27,747
It's a trade.

74
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:30,582
I get it.

75
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,218
He might call, you
might not answer.

76
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,820
It's not about business.

77
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:36,856
I like you.

78
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,859
You'll do well here.

79
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,127
No one's gonna judge you.

80
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,030
Will you just do us a favor?

81
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,266
Can you try and not
piss off Val, okay?

82
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:50,870
I'm not a fan of hearing
her whine about someone

83
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,072
turning the heating
off or some petty shit.

84
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,110
This isn't gonna
be like last time.

85
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:02,815
I'm not gonna tell
you what you can't do.

86
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:07,585
That's not what this
is. Like you say.

87
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,247
Oh, Val, just fuck off!

88
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,083
I can see your shadow
through the fucking door!

89
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,118
Val, just fuck off or
I'm calling the police!

90
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,152
Simone?

91
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,287
It's Carly.

92
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:43,889
Carly!

93
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,659
You should've said
something, babe!

94
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,728
Oh, sorry.

95
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,069
Your old room's
free, if you want it.

96
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,241
And Val's fixed the shower, too.

97
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,211
Nice.

98
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,367
It's a bit early
for that, init?

99
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,236
At least let me get
the washing done.

100
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,208
Oh, no, no, no.

101
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:37,676
Oh.

102
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,345
Cheeky little trollop!

103
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:45,151
Oh, are you all right?

104
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,452
Fucking' taste your underwear.

105
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,220
I said sorry, mate.

106
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,299
You know, I didn't think
you were coming back.

107
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,336
- I thought that-
- Shh.

108
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,005
Don't shush me, Carly. Jesus.

109
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:08,874
You don't even want me here.

110
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:10,276
Well, does that surprise you?

111
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:13,078
Why are you even back?

112
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:15,181
I'm just doing
what I need to do.

113
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,250
And what Dean? I
thought you were happy.

114
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:21,420
Yeah, well,

115
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:27,193
not everything works out
the way we think it will.

116
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,128
You've gotta roll
with the changes and

117
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:31,363
make them work for you.

118
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,333
So you said I can have my room?

119
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,304
Sound like Jimmy
what you just said.

120
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,438
Is he talking for you now?

121
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,275
Or have you got something
else going on, huh?

122
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,381
Fuck off.

123
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:10,456
Oh.

124
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,425
Carly.

125
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,227
Shit.

126
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,462
Jesus, Carly.

127
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,431
Oh, god, I missed ya!

128
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,569
You all right?

129
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,604
Yeah, I'm fine.

130
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:26,472
Maura?

131
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,108
Oh, uh...

132
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,911
It's all right. You should go.

133
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:34,480
Sorry,
we'll speak later.

134
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:42,020
Fancy taking over?

135
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:50,162
As long as you're up for
marginal disappointment.

136
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:53,198
Marginal?

137
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,333
Go on.

138
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,167
Yeah.

139
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,137
All right, go inside
'cause I'm wearing heels.

140
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:24,963
I'm sorry.

141
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,934
I know you only say
shit because you care.

142
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,337
Look.

143
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:35,374
If you're in trouble or
if you need anything...

144
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:40,647
Sorry, I don't... I know
I'm being hypocritical.

145
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,414
I know I can't say shit, but...

146
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:47,019
I thought you was done.

147
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:49,521
Seems not.

148
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,426
I'm okay, though.

149
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:56,395
I promise.

150
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:58,430
Look, I get it.

151
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,501
That feeling of something
gnawing at you inside.

152
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:06,673
Eatin' at ya, like
it's your fault.

153
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,176
That, that guilt you feel.

154
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:15,214
You've gotta fight through it.

155
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,120
What happened?

156
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,462
Tuesday happened.

157
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:33,532
Then Wednesday and
Thursday and fucking Friday

158
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,467
and shit's gonna
happen every day.

159
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,574
Oh. New song.

160
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,010
New mood, eh?

161
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:48,715
You know, Maura missed ya.

162
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,784
She got into some of the
makeup you left behind.

163
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:54,754
Did that look that you
used to do before you left.

164
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,656
- What, with the glitter?
- Mm-hm.

165
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,323
- Oh, my god.
- Mm-hm.

166
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:01,460
I looked
like a fucking bath mop.

167
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:04,797
Oh, uh-huh, so
did she.

168
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:08,467
She is like the one-person Carly
fan club. She knows it all.

169
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,570
Like, the clubs you've
been to, restaurants,

170
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,505
the new labels you're wearing.

171
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,508
- How?
- Facebook.

172
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,478
Yeah, she would spend
hours leafin' at pics of

173
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,713
you and what's his name,

174
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,715
sayin' how she'd get
her shit together.

175
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,050
Like you.

176
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,787
Is that supposed
to make me feel bad?

177
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:30,255
No.

178
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,695
Good.

179
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:38,497
Because what I do has nothing
to do with you, or Maura,

180
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,431
or fucking anyone.

181
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:44,637
Well...

182
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,540
Dean seemed perfect for ya.

183
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,376
We're all just faking it.

184
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,712
One day at a time.

185
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,583
He didn't...

186
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:58,450
Hit you?

187
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,792
We all think we've
only got one problem.

188
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:11,363
And if we solve that,
it'll fix everything.

189
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,770
There's no escape.

190
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,473
And that's the fucking truth.

191
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:37,984
No client out of the site.

192
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,251
Your rule.

193
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:43,723
Well, I guess I can say
when we can break it, can't I?

194
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:48,560
He's a friend of mine.

195
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,596
There's nothin' to worry about.

196
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:58,537
He just has a couple
of peculiarities.

197
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,775
Oh, yeah?

198
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,780
My advice is
just to go with it.

199
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,551
Bet it fucking is.

200
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,825
You want to look?

201
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:26,498
That's been ringing ever
since you gave it to me.

202
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:34,239
What do you reckon?

203
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,380
You need to get your
head in the game.

204
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:45,517
This is a big one, you hear me?

205
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:51,456
Bet he says that
to all the girls.

206
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,324
That's funny.

207
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,694
That was very funny.

208
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:58,898
You wanna get out.

209
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,435
And this guy, he
can get you there.

210
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:06,873
If he likes ya.

211
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:12,879
All of the juice.

212
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:14,847
None of the squeeze.

213
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,386
What a life that would be.

214
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:27,994
Ask for Alexis.

215
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:36,334
Hey.

216
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,673
Be safe.

217
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:57,690
You for Alexis?

218
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:00,425
Is that you?

219
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:05,397
Can take you to her, though.

220
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:07,967
If you want.

221
00:20:30,957 --> 00:20:32,024
There she is.

222
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:36,896
Alexis.

223
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,000
She's beautiful, isn't she?

224
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,439
You want to leave?

225
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,080
No.

226
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:57,917
I used to hate them.

227
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:00,953
Made my skin crawl, but,

228
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:03,455
she's special.

229
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,001
Cast a spell on me.

230
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:22,842
She'll do the same to you
if you're not careful.

231
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:31,984
She's beautiful.

232
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,088
You got any more?

233
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:37,990
Just her.

234
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:57,777
Do you like to dance?

235
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,980
What do you think
of instruction?

236
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:35,613
Is it crass?

237
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,191
- It depends.
- On what?

238
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:49,128
Intention.

239
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,096
What's mine?

240
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,300
Control.

241
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,134
Freedom.

242
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:11,083
Tell me.

243
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:17,790
How's that?

244
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:19,692
Tell me.

245
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:23,129
Go higher.

246
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,201
Shows connection.

247
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:31,637
Trust.

248
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:37,309
The willingness to find
ecstasy in the moment.

249
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:39,879
Your partner is like a tool.

250
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:49,755
Use me.

251
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,225
Use me to get what you want.

252
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:55,194
Use me.

253
00:26:00,252 --> 00:26:03,155
Listen, I know you
don't wanna hear it,

254
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:05,324
but this is what happens
when you trust people.

255
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:08,260
Right, Simone?

256
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,063
Are you listening?

257
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:12,331
It's not worth calling
scum like that people,

258
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,166
if you ask me.

259
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,234
Oh, morning, Carly.

260
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:19,138
I was just saying this
is why we have the rules.

261
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:21,173
So you girls don't
bear the brunt of it.

262
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,753
Carly.

263
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:52,805
These girls look up to you.

264
00:26:57,276 --> 00:27:00,779
Oh, love.

265
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:02,381
Go sort yourself out.

266
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,310
Why's she back?

267
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:34,079
Has she said anything?

268
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:36,448
Why does anyone come back?

269
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:09,448
I'll go.

270
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,889
She can't bring that
shit here. Not again.

271
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:32,838
You okay?

272
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,545
Can I come in?

273
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:42,348
No, just give me a sec.

274
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:49,955
All right, I'll be
here whenever you need.

275
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:01,533
Oh, babe.

276
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,909
You can't keep
doing this, Carly.

277
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,411
No, it's not that.

278
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,314
I just feel sick.

279
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:27,593
I know I said he hurt
me earlier but...

280
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:31,029
He didn't.

281
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,534
Dean's a good man.

282
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:38,270
Why?

283
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,142
It's easier than
admitting the truth.

284
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,444
And what is the truth?

285
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:50,916
Carly, you need to
talk to someone.

286
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:56,588
I've got it under control.

287
00:29:56,622 --> 00:29:57,956
Yeah, by what definition?

288
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,995
You know, this isn't
your only option.

289
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:05,097
There are other
places you can go.

290
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,666
Yeah and how do you know that?

291
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,273
Could you get me
a towel, please?

292
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,944
Yeah.

293
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:55,300
Carly, Carly, Carly.

294
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:56,134
Work?

295
00:32:57,704 --> 00:32:59,605
Carly, we good, yeah?

296
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:02,875
I wanna introduce
you to someone.

297
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:03,743
Carly.

298
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,259
Hi.

299
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:54,894
Um...

300
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,532
Jimmy said you was into that.

301
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,371
You can go to the bathroom to
sort yourself out if you want.

302
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:07,907
No, I'm fine.

303
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:12,745
Or the light?

304
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:18,651
If you've got a headache.

305
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:20,687
Lindsey used to get
headaches all the time.

306
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,826
She used to sit in a dark
room till they passed.

307
00:34:30,562 --> 00:34:31,363
Prick.

308
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:33,833
He'll tell ya.

309
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:37,469
I caught her with her boss.

310
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:39,739
Jesus.

311
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:43,776
I just need...

312
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,347
I just need to forget, you know?

313
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,420
Are you okay?

314
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:57,890
I'm fine.

315
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:03,328
That was a nice thing you did.

316
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:06,465
It's no bother.

317
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:10,036
No.

318
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:11,971
That was really lovely.

319
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,541
What are friends for, eh?

320
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:25,417
Your boss, Jim, he-

321
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,585
- He's not my boss.

322
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:31,389
He said it was

323
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:33,760
gonna be 100?

324
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:46,438
What did you come here for?

325
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,843
Because I'm pretty sure it
wasn't to talk about business.

326
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:54,847
No.

327
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:57,482
You're right.

328
00:36:01,486 --> 00:36:02,655
Good answer.

329
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:08,895
Uh, do we...

330
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:11,964
How does this work?

331
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,971
Any way that you want.

332
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:32,051
You should look
after your body more.

333
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:35,420
But men, they don't.

334
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,558
I just don't

335
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,494
think about it.

336
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:49,501
Oh, I...

337
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,037
I think...

338
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:54,640
You're right.

339
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,143
Jesus.

340
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:32,678
Shit.

341
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,914
Problem?

342
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:40,653
No, it was just...

343
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:41,888
It was just a bit sharp.

344
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,028
What is it?

345
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,397
Why are you scared?

346
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,741
Look at me.

347
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,944
I am.

348
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:22,061
You're, you're beautiful.

349
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,207
Well, you deserve a
beautiful woman like me.

350
00:38:37,575 --> 00:38:38,744
I deserve...

351
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,881
A woman like you.

352
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,513
Carly?

353
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:38,037
What's going on?

354
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,644
Will somebody talk to me?
What is going on here?

355
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:52,284
Look, I'm really sorry, mate.

356
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,327
I'll give you your
money back, all right?

357
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,728
That's sorted.

358
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:07,166
It's all right, it's all right.

359
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:15,134
What?

360
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:18,971
You need to check your attitude.

361
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:22,141
Need to slow down and
listen for a minute.

362
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:26,679
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you better fucking be.

363
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:28,114
Nearly scared that
poor guy half to death.

364
00:41:28,147 --> 00:41:30,015
Thought he was
gonna turn you in.

365
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:32,218
I'm sorry.

366
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:39,191
What did he say happened?

367
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:41,626
That I grabbed him?

368
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:44,196
Look, I know
it's been a while,

369
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:48,200
but we don't play
games here, Carly.

370
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:49,034
All right, love?

371
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,010
You're a nice girl, but
you're going through some shit

372
00:41:58,043 --> 00:41:59,178
that I can't help you with.

373
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,815
And Jimmy certainly can't.

374
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:09,255
We're all a bit messed up
here, if you hadn't noticed.

375
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:14,226
Yeah. You're going
through some tough times.

376
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:16,962
I'll fix this, Val.

377
00:43:36,842 --> 00:43:38,410
Hail, Medusa.

378
00:43:46,385 --> 00:43:50,489
You want her to find
out who she is, don't you?

379
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,459
Yes.

380
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:57,329
It's time.

381
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:11,410
You can feel it.

382
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,478
Yes.

383
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:51,510
Hello?

384
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:59,218
We need to talk about
the other night.

385
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,327
He's been expecting you.

386
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:11,163
Is he here?

387
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:13,599
He was.

388
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:17,436
Well, how long's he gonna be?

389
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:28,947
Where's Alexis?

390
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:31,316
The snake.

391
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,519
She's around, I'm sure.

392
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,388
Doin' her thang.

393
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:51,069
Are you some kind
of witch or something?

394
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:57,009
Some people deserve
a second chance.

395
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:00,680
Don't you think?

396
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,388
You should drink this.

397
00:47:12,558 --> 00:47:13,660
It's a snake in the grass.

398
00:47:15,695 --> 00:47:16,995
I thought appropriate.

399
00:47:21,668 --> 00:47:23,670
You think he gave you something.

400
00:47:27,573 --> 00:47:28,641
How are you feeling?

401
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,044
I'm fine.

402
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,014
But you're
experiencing changes.

403
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:38,517
Senses.

404
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:40,252
Movements.

405
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:42,387
Needs.

406
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:46,659
My advice?

407
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:49,595
Go with it.

408
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,637
Not for you, or just don't
like being told what to do?

409
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:02,742
Are you and your boyfriend
part of some cult or something?

410
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:05,511
He's
not my boyfriend.

411
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:09,481
He was chosen, but for
a different purpose.

412
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,322
Men like him and Jimmy,

413
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,491
they mean nothing.

414
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,061
- Do you know him?
- Jimmy?

415
00:48:25,665 --> 00:48:27,667
Only insofar as his
relation to you.

416
00:48:33,572 --> 00:48:35,073
And how he'll be your first.

417
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:40,647
My first?

418
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:47,486
You should see it.

419
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,204
He understood the steps
that needed to be taken.

420
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,507
What it took to find

421
00:49:43,475 --> 00:49:44,309
the queen.

422
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,113
He knew.

423
00:50:18,678 --> 00:50:21,346
That's not what I'm looking for.

424
00:50:22,347 --> 00:50:23,816
We're equal, though.

425
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,822
Could be anywhere.

426
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:13,866
You don't leave the site.

427
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,334
That's the deal.

428
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:18,738
You're the one that
fuckin' brought me here.

429
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,604
Not now.

430
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:22,975
Not at bloody lunchtime.

431
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:27,680
What'd you come here for?
Afternoon fuckin' tea?

432
00:51:28,815 --> 00:51:29,749
I'll get the bus.

433
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:33,585
I'm not fuckin' around, Carly!

434
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:35,520
I don't know if you can
see the vein throbbing

435
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,456
in my fucking neck, but
I'm not happy right now.

436
00:51:37,489 --> 00:51:38,557
Get in the car.

437
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,395
You're gonna have to speak
to me with a bit more respect,

438
00:51:43,428 --> 00:51:45,497
if I'm gonna do anything.

439
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:47,800
Okay, Carly.

440
00:51:48,668 --> 00:51:49,669
I think...

441
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:54,506
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

442
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,341
It's calm.

443
00:52:03,315 --> 00:52:03,950
Apologize.

444
00:52:06,052 --> 00:52:06,886
I'm sorry.

445
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:10,455
We're friends, I'm...

446
00:52:11,623 --> 00:52:12,925
I shouldn't jump
on you like that.

447
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:15,527
It's just that you being
here without me, it's,

448
00:52:16,896 --> 00:52:19,866
it's not the sort of
place that a girl like you

449
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,636
should be alone.

450
00:52:23,669 --> 00:52:25,805
You suddenly give
a shit about me.

451
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:26,672
Suddenly?

452
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:28,875
I care for you.

453
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:34,546
You were the one who
rang me, remember?

454
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:35,982
Yeah, to get my next fix.

455
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:40,485
And I was there.

456
00:52:42,822 --> 00:52:43,990
He was trying to help me.

457
00:52:45,725 --> 00:52:46,558
Who, him?

458
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:49,962
Ah.

459
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:50,797
Him.

460
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:56,736
In my experience, if
someone wants something,

461
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:58,971
I mean really craves it,

462
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:01,573
they're gonna do whatever
they can to get it.

463
00:53:01,606 --> 00:53:03,976
Even if that means putting
themselves in the firing line,

464
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:04,844
so to speak.

465
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:06,979
Now, come on.

466
00:53:08,014 --> 00:53:09,816
Let's get you back to the site.

467
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:11,117
I've spoken to Val.
She's worried about you.

468
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,921
Look, we all are. But it's
okay, no one's judging.

469
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:16,956
We're here for you.
Whatever you need.

470
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:20,893
I get why you're feeling

471
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:23,029
alone and all.

472
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:28,333
I'm here.

473
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:31,003
The girls, like I said.

474
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:34,807
We can figure this thing out.

475
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:42,648
Okay.

476
00:53:42,682 --> 00:53:44,083
Okay?

477
00:53:44,116 --> 00:53:44,951
Okay, good.

478
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:49,755
Your carriage, madam.

479
00:53:58,563 --> 00:54:01,968
You came to me, remember?

480
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:02,902
That means you listen.

481
00:54:06,172 --> 00:54:07,006
You obey.

482
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:11,110
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

483
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:14,747
You don't wanna wake the birds.

484
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:18,951
Jimmy, please.

485
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:20,887
"Please."

486
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,754
"Please."

487
00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:25,024
Please yourself, you daft twat.

488
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:33,498
You don't have to do this.

489
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:37,069
You don't have to do this.

490
00:54:37,103 --> 00:54:39,005
I do.

491
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:47,013
I bet you're not as tight
as you were last time.

492
00:54:49,649 --> 00:54:51,951
Carly, Carly, Carly,
Carly, my fallen angel.

493
00:54:52,885 --> 00:54:54,486
Let's give you back those wings.

494
00:54:55,688 --> 00:54:57,223
And maybe...

495
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:59,926
Maybe you'll find your way back
to fuckin' heaven won't you?

496
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:04,897
You filthy cunt.

497
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:08,701
Carly.

498
00:55:20,578 --> 00:55:21,213
Carly.

499
00:57:47,827 --> 00:57:49,228
Carly?

500
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:52,932
Look, I've been trying to get
a hold of you. Where are ya?

501
00:57:52,965 --> 00:57:54,233
Carly, it's me.

502
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:58,671
What you avoidin'?

503
00:57:59,705 --> 00:58:00,272
He wants ya.

504
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,842
Wants to support ya.

505
00:58:03,776 --> 00:58:05,111
I'm not avoiding anything.

506
00:58:05,144 --> 00:58:06,178
Yeah.

507
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:07,913
Sure.

508
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:11,050
Whatever.

509
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,855
You know, I don't get it.

510
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:19,859
- When you left.
- Yeah, I know, I was happy.

511
00:58:22,394 --> 00:58:24,096
I didn't know what that meant.

512
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:26,165
Clearly.

513
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,034
So this is it?

514
00:58:31,837 --> 00:58:33,005
This is your life now?

515
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:38,944
No.

516
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:42,781
Now I'm something better.

517
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:02,334
You know, you can't hide this.

518
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:06,405
Believe me.

519
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:16,348
I tried.

520
00:59:20,386 --> 00:59:21,921
You know that shame?

521
00:59:24,957 --> 00:59:26,358
That you're feeling?

522
00:59:28,427 --> 00:59:30,462
It just shows your
willingness to change.

523
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,338
I could introduce
you to someone.

524
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,410
Give you an alternative
to all of this

525
00:59:45,511 --> 00:59:46,345
hiding.

526
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:56,155
I'm not like you.

527
01:00:02,194 --> 01:00:03,028
Sure.

528
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:47,806
Oh! You smell nice.

529
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,309
It's Carcon. Ian bought it me.

530
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:53,545
Oh, lucky.

531
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:55,347
Nah, he buys it all the girls.

532
01:00:56,348 --> 01:00:57,883
No, don't say that.

533
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:02,855
Probably 'cause he
wanted to impress you.

534
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:06,392
You're the type of
girl worth impressing.

535
01:01:06,425 --> 01:01:07,993
Carl.

536
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:09,028
Sweet of ya.

537
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:13,399
You're so beautiful, Maura.

538
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:17,336
Your hair and your,

539
01:01:18,203 --> 01:01:19,405
your skin and...

540
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:23,142
Your smile.

541
01:01:27,046 --> 01:01:28,347
What? Am I embarrassing you?

542
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:35,454
No.

543
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:38,290
A little bit.

544
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:43,529
Well, you shouldn't
be embarrassed.

545
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,231
I'm just stating facts.

546
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:01,246
We don't deserve
you here, Maura.

547
01:02:03,982 --> 01:02:05,284
Are you all right, Carl?

548
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,255
Since you got here, you've
just been different.

549
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:14,259
No, I'm fine.

550
01:02:18,297 --> 01:02:20,366
You sound like
Alexis, you know.

551
01:02:20,399 --> 01:02:23,202
This girl that stayed
here for a bit.

552
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:24,637
Only a month, if that.

553
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,242
Yeah, she actually
stayed in your van.

554
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,647
She'd ask about ya.

555
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:39,551
It's like she knew ya.

556
01:02:42,388 --> 01:02:44,923
- About me?
- Well, like she wanted to.

557
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:58,270
Look.

558
01:03:14,453 --> 01:03:15,521
You know her?

559
01:03:20,058 --> 01:03:20,693
No.

560
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:30,335
Well, like I said, she
didn't stay very long, so...

561
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,138
Why you here, Maura?

562
01:03:35,307 --> 01:03:37,644
How's it make you feel
when someone hits you?

563
01:03:41,313 --> 01:03:42,581
I don't know.

564
01:03:45,017 --> 01:03:45,652
Not good.

565
01:03:49,354 --> 01:03:50,355
Worthless?

566
01:03:52,558 --> 01:03:56,261
The fact that someone
could just use me.

567
01:03:59,331 --> 01:04:00,199
And then...

568
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:11,678
Well, at least we've
learned a lesson.

569
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:17,382
You can't trust anyone.

570
01:04:22,454 --> 01:04:24,757
There are snakes in the grass.

571
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:31,463
What would you do

572
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:35,601
if you could do anything
to the guy who hurt you?

573
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,223
You may.

574
01:05:33,693 --> 01:05:36,194
Where is she? The other one.

575
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:38,665
What?

576
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:42,669
Just, she, uh...

577
01:05:42,702 --> 01:05:43,836
Owes me, is all.

578
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,104
Come on.

579
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:51,243
Let me make you comfortable.

580
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:02,487
So, I feel like
you're into instruction.

581
01:06:04,323 --> 01:06:06,124
Telling things what to do.

582
01:06:07,827 --> 01:06:11,664
Guess you're into that.

583
01:06:11,698 --> 01:06:14,701
Lie down and take
your clothes off.

584
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:16,736
It's a guess.

585
01:06:16,769 --> 01:06:20,572
Not that I'm doing it.

586
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:21,440
Sit.

587
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:32,785
Oh?

588
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:38,190
Maura told me all about you.

589
01:06:40,927 --> 01:06:41,861
How strong you are.

590
01:06:43,763 --> 01:06:45,364
How in control.

591
01:06:46,565 --> 01:06:48,266
I knew that bitch
was into that.

592
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:52,537
She said she'd
never been so wet.

593
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,643
You fucking hoes are
all the same, aren't ya?

594
01:07:02,214 --> 01:07:04,684
Oh. Sorry.

595
01:07:04,717 --> 01:07:06,284
Did I go a bit hard?

596
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:07,519
Yeah, just a bit.

597
01:07:07,552 --> 01:07:10,823
Sometimes I just get
carried away.

598
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:13,158
It's okay.

599
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:16,328
Relax.

600
01:07:19,732 --> 01:07:20,565
Enjoy it.

601
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:28,206
Does that feel good, baby?

602
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:47,660
- Get off!
- What's that?

603
01:07:48,995 --> 01:07:49,829
Fuck!

604
01:07:54,266 --> 01:07:57,269
Hey, I thought you'd
invite me 'cause you needed it.

605
01:07:57,302 --> 01:07:58,671
- You don't know what I need.
- Oh, yeah?

606
01:07:59,604 --> 01:08:01,573
Fucking bitch!

607
01:08:06,813 --> 01:08:10,717
Oh, fuck.

608
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,584
It's funny, isn't it?

609
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:15,320
How you become a victim
of your own routine.

610
01:08:15,353 --> 01:08:16,254
Fuck you.

611
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,223
How eloquent.

612
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:23,730
Do you feel strong, baby?

613
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:27,834
You feel special, baby?

614
01:08:32,071 --> 01:08:33,605
Do you feel wet?

615
01:08:58,064 --> 01:09:00,767
You still wanna see
strength, little girl?

616
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:14,312
Love?

617
01:09:14,346 --> 01:09:15,681
Can you hear me?

618
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:19,018
Do you think we should
call an ambulance?

619
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:19,952
What?

620
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:22,420
No. Don't be so fucking stupid.

621
01:09:25,858 --> 01:09:26,893
Carl.

622
01:09:29,896 --> 01:09:31,864
Jesus Christ, Carly.

623
01:09:32,999 --> 01:09:35,034
What happened to you?

624
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:37,837
Where is he?

625
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:40,973
He left before I realized
anything was wrong.

626
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:42,474
What?

627
01:09:42,507 --> 01:09:43,341
What?

628
01:09:45,544 --> 01:09:46,846
I thought this was a break-in.

629
01:09:50,016 --> 01:09:51,483
You invited him?

630
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:52,551
It was my idea.

631
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,788
What do you mean
it was your idea?

632
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:59,759
These scumbags have
to be taught a lesson.

633
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:00,927
Well, it seems the only person

634
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,328
who's got taught
something tonight was you!

635
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:06,132
Now, I need to go
and find Jimmy,

636
01:10:06,165 --> 01:10:09,401
so he can find that psycho
before he finishes you off!

637
01:10:11,436 --> 01:10:13,039
What the fuck did he do to ya?

638
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:20,980
I think you took it a
bit far this time, Carl.

639
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:28,020
Well, deal with your own
fucking shit next time.

640
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:06,618
Carl!

641
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:07,787
Carly.

642
01:12:26,739 --> 01:12:28,841
Carly, are you all right?

643
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:05,177
Carl, I can't help you if you
don't tell me what's wrong.

644
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:08,546
Carl.

645
01:13:32,604 --> 01:13:33,839
Carl.

646
01:13:33,873 --> 01:13:34,840
Carl!

647
01:13:34,874 --> 01:13:37,309
I said
leave it, Maura!

648
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:58,224
Hey, baby.

649
01:15:00,192 --> 01:15:01,260
You got nowhere to be?

650
01:15:02,128 --> 01:15:04,396
Hey, hey, where you
goin'? Hey, hey, hey.

651
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:10,336
See, I knew you wanted to play.

652
01:15:16,342 --> 01:15:17,676
Show me your face.

653
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,815
Oh, you fucking crazy bitch.

654
01:15:56,448 --> 01:15:57,283
Carly?

655
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:01,053
Carly, what the fuck?

656
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:04,056
Carly, where the fuck you been?

657
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:09,228
But I, I thought you were hurt.

658
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:15,301
Where's Jimmy?

659
01:16:17,236 --> 01:16:19,104
I've got something
to show you.

660
01:16:45,864 --> 01:16:46,832
People like that...

661
01:16:53,372 --> 01:16:54,406
They're nothing.

662
01:16:57,309 --> 01:16:59,044
They use you.

663
01:16:59,078 --> 01:17:00,379
They make money.

664
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:02,481
Then that's it.

665
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:09,321
They're don't give
a shit about you.

666
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:13,325
You're not special or important.

667
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:16,462
You're disposable.

668
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:21,233
They do whatever
the fuck they want.

669
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:34,346
They'll eat you alive, Maura.

670
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:38,450
Do you understand?

671
01:17:40,853 --> 01:17:42,354
What the fuck have you done?

672
01:17:44,023 --> 01:17:45,190
Well, do you wanna be
a part of this world?

673
01:18:04,376 --> 01:18:05,210
I can't.

674
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:08,147
I've gotta go.

675
01:18:26,332 --> 01:18:27,466
They found Jimmy's body.

676
01:18:34,073 --> 01:18:35,642
What did you do, Carly?

677
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,943
Figured my life out, Val.

678
01:18:37,976 --> 01:18:41,313
It doesn't matter
what he did or didn't do.

679
01:18:41,347 --> 01:18:43,148
No one deserves that.

680
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:44,383
"Deserves"?

681
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:48,487
And you're the judge of that?

682
01:18:50,356 --> 01:18:52,324
All the police have
been asking questions.

683
01:18:52,358 --> 01:18:54,426
They're gonna be
watching this place.

684
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,294
Will they?

685
01:19:02,568 --> 01:19:04,403
I'm just thinking
about us girls.

686
01:19:06,438 --> 01:19:08,140
All the shit that
you promised us.

687
01:19:10,476 --> 01:19:13,312
What you talkin' about, hm?

688
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:19,418
How many old men's
dicks did we have to suck?

689
01:19:24,724 --> 01:19:25,557
Don't.

690
01:19:27,493 --> 01:19:28,527
I'll go.

691
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,635
Carly!

692
01:19:36,535 --> 01:19:38,003
Carly!

693
01:19:38,036 --> 01:19:39,405
Carly, open this...

694
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:40,973
Don't be stupid!

695
01:19:47,212 --> 01:19:48,046
Carly.

696
01:19:49,982 --> 01:19:51,350
Carly, what's happening?

697
01:19:51,383 --> 01:19:52,951
I don't understand.

698
01:19:54,386 --> 01:19:55,621
No, don't! Don't!

699
01:19:55,655 --> 01:19:56,488
Or?

700
01:19:58,725 --> 01:19:59,558
Don't.

701
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,228
Did you do that to him?

702
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:08,600
He had it coming.

703
01:20:10,068 --> 01:20:10,969
Bullshit.

704
01:20:13,071 --> 01:20:14,573
I won't try to convince you.

705
01:20:15,742 --> 01:20:17,710
You're the one pointing
the knife at me.

706
01:20:22,614 --> 01:20:23,582
I had a weakness.

707
01:20:26,385 --> 01:20:27,519
Then I found something new.

708
01:20:30,189 --> 01:20:31,423
Please don't make me.

709
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:35,695
Make you?

710
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:40,700
Oh, you are sick in
the fucking head, Carly.

711
01:20:42,067 --> 01:20:45,571
Do you remember
when we used to talk?

712
01:20:45,604 --> 01:20:49,676
About what we'd do when
we found the perfect man?

713
01:20:54,246 --> 01:20:55,748
Do you remember that?

714
01:21:00,586 --> 01:21:02,087
Do you believe it?

715
01:21:03,656 --> 01:21:07,226
'Cause I've finally taken
responsibility over my own life.

716
01:21:07,259 --> 01:21:09,662
You have no idea
what that even means.

717
01:21:15,802 --> 01:21:19,672
I don't think anyone
knows what they want.

718
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:24,510
And sometimes your hand
just has to be forced.

719
01:21:26,144 --> 01:21:26,779
No.

720
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:31,149
Carly!

721
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:34,119
I've got venom
inside me, Simone.

722
01:21:37,589 --> 01:21:39,558
And I want you to feel it.

723
01:21:43,295 --> 01:21:44,129
Fuck!

724
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:25,504
I see you've been shedding.

725
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,776
The power's always
been within you.

726
01:22:34,346 --> 01:22:35,648
You came.

727
01:22:37,382 --> 01:22:40,118
For my sister,
I'd do anything.

728
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:42,621
And so would they.

729
01:23:00,372 --> 01:23:02,341
Carly, this is insane.

730
01:23:09,682 --> 01:23:10,515
I do.

731
01:23:13,418 --> 01:23:15,520
And she knows the
spirit that fuels her?

732
01:23:16,555 --> 01:23:17,389
She will.

733
01:23:18,725 --> 01:23:20,626
Come.

734
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,795
Your final challenge
is in front of you.

735
01:23:25,497 --> 01:23:26,331
Carly.

736
01:23:27,532 --> 01:23:28,668
Please let us go.

737
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,707
You can go.

738
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,757
I don't know why
you're surprised, Val.

739
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:53,926
You made me like this.

740
01:24:05,638 --> 01:24:09,274
I don't wanna hurt you.

741
01:24:09,307 --> 01:24:09,942
Trust me.

742
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,749
You've returned, sister.

743
01:24:50,983 --> 01:24:52,584
Our mortal queen.

744
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:15,775
Rise, Medusa!

745
01:25:16,876 --> 01:25:18,577
Our serpent queen.

746
01:25:55,890 --> 01:26:00,890
