1
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,592
Call me lshmael.

2
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,588
Some years ago,
having little or no money,

3
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,132
l thought l would sail about

4
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,065
And see the oceans of the world.

5
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:39,535
Whenever l get grim and spleenful,

6
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:43,608
Whenever l feel like
knocking people's hats off in the street.

7
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:46,644
Whenever it's a damp,
drizzly November in my soul,

8
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,782
l know it's high time
to get to sea again.

9
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,680
Choose any path you please,

10
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,549
And 10-to-1
it carries you down to water.

11
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:58,919
There's a magic in water
That draws all men away from the land,

12
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,184
Leads them over the hills

13
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,697
Down creeks and streams
and rivers to the sea.

14
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:10,394
The sea where each man as in a mirror

15
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,562
Finds himself.

16
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:15,934
And so it was

17
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,270
l duly arrived at the town
of New Bedford

18
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:24,941
On a stormy Saturday late
in the year 1841 .

19
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:18,196
Rum.
Rum it is. What mark?

20
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,534
To this, a penny.
To that, another penny.

21
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,606
The cape horn measure,

22
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,243
Which you may drink down
for a full shilling.

23
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:28,814
The penny mark...
Nay. A full shilling.

24
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,883
You'll be wanting a room tonight.

25
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:33,110
You hain't no objections

26
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:36,119
To sharing a harpooneer's bed, have you?

27
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,519
You going whaling?
That is my intention.

28
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,091
You need permission.

29
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,319
You weren't born in New Bedford,
were you?

30
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:46,226
No. l'm a stranger here.
Then you'll have to have permission.

31
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,959
Aye. From us, the men of New Bedford.

32
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,466
The sea is ours.

33
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,332
Other seamen only have
a right of way through it,

34
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:55,201
And the whale is ours alone.

35
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:59,709
No one else may hunt it down
and kill it unless we say so.

36
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,780
Do you dispute that?

37
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,816
l do not.
Good.

38
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:09,046
Then you have our permission
to sail our sea.

39
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:12,282
Drink to this boy, eh, mates?

40
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,950
Aye, aye!

41
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:20,122
Big whales to you, mate!

42
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:24,334
Can whales do that?
Whales can do anything!

43
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:26,597
A whale can jump up like an earthquake

44
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:29,231
And come down on you like a mountain

45
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,709
Somehow put to sea.
A whale can stave in the ribs of a ship,

46
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,906
Swallow whole crews,
pick its teeth with the oars.

47
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,450
lf god wanted to be a fish,
he'd be a whale.

48
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,616
Believe that, he'd be a whale.

49
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:54,523
Ahab.

50
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,293
Who's Ahab?

51
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,495
Captain Ahab to you.

52
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:02,801
Who's Captain Ahab?
Aye.

53
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:05,968
Ahab's Ahab.

54
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,343
Music.

55
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:12,508
Music!

56
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,064
A-roving, a-roving

57
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,671
Sing!
Since roving's been my ruin

58
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,937
l'll go no more a-roving with you,
fair maid

59
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,080
Her cheeks were red,
her eyes were brown

60
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:43,238
Mark ye well what l do say

61
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,509
Her cheeks were red, her eyes were brown

62
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:47,812
Her curly hair was hanging down

63
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:51,923
l'll go no more a-roving with you,
fair maid

64
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,923
A-roving, a-roving

65
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,085
Since roving's been my ruin

66
00:06:56,262 --> 00:07:00,426
l'll go no more a-roving with you,
fair maid

67
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,263
Which is the harpooneer
l'm to sleep with tonight?

68
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:06,098
Oh, he ain't among them.

69
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,298
He's what you might call
a dark complexioned chap.

70
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:14,004
He'll be along as soon as
he finishes selling his head.

71
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,842
His what?
Selling his head.

72
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:19,576
He may have some difficulty
in getting rid of it.

73
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,449
New Bedford's overstocked.

74
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:25,216
With what?
Heads, of course.

75
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:29,828
Come on, lad!
l kissed her once, l kissed her twice...

76
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:28,944
Wait. Hold on.
Who the devil are you?

77
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:30,173
Who doth speak?

78
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,716
l kill you!
Landlord!

79
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:35,616
Peter Coffin! Coffin, save me!

80
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:37,517
Now, now, now, now.

81
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,887
What is all this about?

82
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,824
Why didn't you tell me
l was sleeping with a cannibal?

83
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:45,362
l thought you knowed.

84
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:48,591
Didn't l tell you
he was around selling heads?

85
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:51,669
Landlord, tell him
to stash that tomahawk

86
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:57,834
Or pipe or whatever you call it.

87
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:07,609
Well, pleasant dreams.

88
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,524
Oh, well.

89
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:22,828
Better a sober cannibal
Than a drunken Christian.

90
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,867
ln this same New Bedford,

91
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:27,029
There stands a whaleman's chapel,

92
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,400
And few are the fishermen

93
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:31,600
Shortly bound for
the lndian Ocean or Pacific

94
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:36,772
Who fail to visit there.

95
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,793
Amen

96
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:45,375
''And god prepared a great fish

97
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:49,379
To swallow up Jonah.''

98
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,642
Shipmates,

99
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,649
The sin of Jonah

100
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,152
Was in his disobedience
of the command of god.

101
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,916
He found it a hard command.

102
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,582
And it was, shipmates,

103
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,093
For all the things that god
would have us do are hard.

104
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:07,790
lf we would obey god,
we must disobey ourselves.

105
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,561
But Jonah still further flouts at god

106
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,170
By seeking to flee from him.

107
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,502
Jonah thinks that a ship made by man

108
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:20,908
Will carry him into countries
Where god does not reign.

109
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,207
He prowls among the shipping

110
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:27,580
Like a vile burglar
hastening to cross the seas,

111
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:33,123
And as he comes aboard,
the sailors mock him.

112
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,783
The ship puts out,

113
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,793
But soon the sea rebels.

114
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:40,330
lt will not bear the wicked burden.

115
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,230
A dreadful storm comes up.
The ship breaks.

116
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:45,563
The boatswain calls
all hands to lighten her.

117
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:49,299
Boxes, bales, and jars
are clattering overboard.

118
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:52,410
The wind is shrieking.
The men are yelling.

119
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,739
''l fear the lord, cries Jonah,

120
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:57,212
''The god of heaven who hath made the sea

121
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:01,376
And the dry land.''

122
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:05,689
Again, the sailors mock him.

123
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:08,383
But wretched Jonah cries out to him

124
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,290
To cast him overboard,

125
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,795
For he knew that for his sake

126
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,593
This great tempest was upon them.

127
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:17,827
Now behold Jonah.

128
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:23,499
Taken up as an anchor
and dropped into the sea,

129
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:28,074
lnto the dreadful jaws awaiting him.

130
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:32,547
And the great whale shoots
to all his ivory teeth,

131
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:38,918
Like so many white bolts
upon his prison.

132
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:42,356
And Jonah cries unto the lord,

133
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:46,259
Out of the vicious belly.

134
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:49,333
But observe his prayer, shipmates.

135
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:51,197
He doesn't weep and wail.

136
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,429
He feels his punishment is just.

137
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:56,439
He leaves deliverance to god.

138
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:59,476
And even out of the belly of hell,

139
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:03,911
Grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones,

140
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,075
God heard him when he cried.

141
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:10,416
And god spake unto the whale.

142
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,117
And from the shuddering cold
and blackness of the deep,

143
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,955
The whale breached into the sun

144
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:22,465
And vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

145
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,694
And Jonah...

146
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,805
Bruised and beaten...

147
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:31,535
His ears like two sea shells

148
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:37,047
Still multitudinously
murmuring of the ocean,

149
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,480
Jonah did the almighty's bidding.

150
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:42,450
And what was that, shipmates?

151
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:46,991
To preach the truth
in the face of falsehood.

152
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,093
No, shipmates,

153
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,127
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil
on the troubled waters

154
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,232
When god has brewed them into a gale.

155
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,894
Yea, woe to him who,
as the pilot Paul has it,

156
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:05,067
While preaching to others is himself a castaway.

157
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:10,839
Or delight is to him

158
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:17,283
Who against the proud gods
and commodores of this earth

159
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:21,517
Stands forth his own inexorable self,

160
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,787
Who destroys all sin,

161
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:27,626
Though he pluck it out
from under the robes of senators

162
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,792
And judges.

163
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,199
And eternal delight shall be his

164
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:40,311
Who, coming to lay him down, can say,

165
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,777
''O father...

166
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:45,974
''Mortal or immortal...

167
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:49,144
''Here l die.

168
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:53,584
''l've striven to be thine,

169
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,887
''More than to be this world's

170
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,554
''Or mine own.

171
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,530
''Yet this is nothing.

172
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:06,604
''l leave eternity to thee...

173
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,900
''For what is man

174
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:16,572
That he should live out
the lifetime of his god?''

175
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:34,088
And 50.

176
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:37,929
3 time l count 50.

177
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:41,039
Many pages, many.

178
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:42,902
A big book.

179
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,235
You know words?

180
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,071
Yeah.

181
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:49,510
l know picture. This whale.

182
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,650
You speak words.

183
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:54,285
''The heart of a whale
is larger than the pipe

184
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,614
''Of the waterworks at London Bridge.

185
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,589
''The water in that pipe
is not so thick or fast

186
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,092
As the blood pumping
from the heart of a whale.''

187
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:07,255
True, true. Thank you.

188
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,560
Queequeg...

189
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:13,102
Who are you? Where are you from?

190
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:16,332
My father king. l chief.

191
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:19,535
My uncle a high priest in islands

192
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,340
West south far away.

193
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:24,449
Ship come by island.

194
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:28,053
l take canoe, l sail, l swim,

195
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,018
l climb a rope, l hide.

196
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,623
Ship take me far.

197
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,282
Many years.

198
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,190
See all world.

199
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,228
Odd. Many is the Christian

200
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:43,357
Wishes he was a dark man
on a cannibal island.

201
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:44,696
What next, Queequeg?

202
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,565
Sail ship. You?

203
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:49,299
Tomorrow l'll sign aboard
any ship in search of whales.

204
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:52,308
l sign, too. Your boat, my boat.

205
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:56,073
l eat same food. We sail on same waters.

206
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:58,443
We kill same whale.

207
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:00,209
We friends.

208
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,650
Same blood, same head,

209
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:05,814
All same.

210
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:09,156
Well, which shall it be, Queequeg?

211
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:12,695
The tit-bit?
Not a bad ship.

212
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:15,527
What do you say to the devil-dam?

213
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:18,693
Pequod.

214
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:21,930
Well, now...

215
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,405
Look at the ivory she's wearing.

216
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,978
All tricked out
in the bones of her victims.

217
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,809
Those cleats made from whale's teeth,

218
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,348
And the tiller, Queequeg,

219
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:38,514
lt's carved from a whale's jaw.

220
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:43,389
Ahoy there.

221
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,120
Someone aboard?

222
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,527
ls this the captain of the Pequod?

223
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,430
What does thee want of the captain?

224
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:54,095
We were thinking of shipping.
Oh, thee art thinking of shipping.

225
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,571
l art...l mean, l does.

226
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,175
Making sport of me, lad?

227
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:01,245
No. l just fell into
that manner of speech.

228
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:02,846
lf l weren't a quaker
and a man of peace,

229
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:08,009
l'd clout thee on the head
just to make sure.

230
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:10,451
l see thee art no New Bedford man.

231
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,251
Doest know nothing at all
about whaling, eh?

232
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,416
l've had several voyages
in the merchant service.

233
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:17,789
Merchant service?
Flukes, man.

234
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:21,729
What takes thee whaling?
Sir, l want to see what whaling is like.

235
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,495
Have you seen Ahab, the ship's captain?

236
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,433
lf you want to know what whaling is,

237
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:29,540
You'll know by clapping
an eye on Captain Ahab.

238
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,643
You'll see a man torn
apart from crown to heel

239
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,006
And spliced together with
Sperm whalebone

240
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,909
ln place of what's missing.

241
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:39,312
His looks tell more than
any church sermon

242
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:42,181
About the mortality of man.

243
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:44,254
And a whale did that?

244
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:48,450
A whale as big as an island.

245
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:51,152
You'd pitch a harpoon down
a whale's throat

246
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,525
And jump after it?
l would, sir,

247
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:57,226
lf it should be positively
indispensable to do so.

248
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:01,396
Come along, then.

249
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:04,201
Bildad, stir yourself.

250
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:06,367
This young man says he wants to ship.

251
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,240
Hast ever been a pirate?

252
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:09,540
Never.

253
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,979
lt's not murder
that last kept you at sea?

254
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,312
lndeed not.

255
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,011
He'll do.
What pay shall we give him?

256
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,282
The 777th part.

257
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,618
That's too much.

258
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,727
For this strapping lad, not half enough.

259
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,988
The captain has a generous heart.

260
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:28,691
We must consider our duty
to the other owners of this ship,

261
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:30,528
Widows and orphans, many of them.

262
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,263
lf we too abundantly
reward this man's labor,

263
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,805
We'll be taking bread from their mouths.

264
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,569
He'll get the 300th part of the profit.

265
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,609
300th part, l say.

266
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,043
Lay not up for yourself
treasures upon earth

267
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,183
Where moth and rust do corrupt.

268
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:49,219
My last pay was...
The 777th part seems fair enough to me.

269
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,515
The 300th. Don't thank me, lad.

270
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,684
l only do thee justice.

271
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:01,626
What holds thee? Sign.

272
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,734
Well, sir, it's...
lt's Captain Ahab.

273
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,460
What about him?

274
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,664
Was not Ahab of old a very wicked king?

275
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:11,241
When slain, did the dogs
not lick his blood?

276
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,742
Look, lad, Captain Ahab
did not name himself.

277
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:15,311
Sign the paper and wrong him not

278
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:20,976
Because he happens to
have a wicked name.

279
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,816
Now for that son of darkness
that is thy friend.

280
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:30,121
Queequeg, step forward.

281
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:34,732
What say you, Bildad?
l suspect thee art not a Christian.

282
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,494
Dost thee attend church on Sundays?

283
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:43,666
Dost thee obey the 10 commandments?

284
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:56,118
God, man.
Take the pen. Make thy mark.

285
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:58,813
Sign now for the 60th
part of our profit.

286
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,983
Quick!

287
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:23,181
Lantern kegs--1 5,

288
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:27,284
Rubber pipes--10.

289
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:45,298
Avast there!

290
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,029
You going aboard, shipmate?

291
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:50,539
Yup.
You signed to sail on that ship?

292
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,700
Have you signed to sail the Pequod?

293
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,278
Was there anything down
about signing away your souls?

294
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,711
What?
Perhaps you haven't got any.

295
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:59,475
Have you met old Ahab?

296
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:01,516
What are you jabbering about?

297
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:05,282
His mother gave him
his evil name and died,

298
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,448
And god's lightning
struck down and branded him.

299
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,618
He spat in the holy goblet in church.

300
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,889
Did they tell you about his last voyage?

301
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:16,831
l know all about him
being crippled by a whale.

302
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:19,232
You sure you do? Sure?

303
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:21,497
The whale marked him inside and out

304
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:23,300
And worked mischief on his soul.

305
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:26,603
Who'd know? Not many, l guess.

306
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:30,773
You can't fool us.
Looks like you've got a great secret.

307
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:32,507
l have.

308
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,117
At sea one day,

309
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:36,914
You'll smell land
where there'll be no land.

310
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,455
On that day, Ahab will go to his grave

311
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,616
But rise again within the hour.

312
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,455
He will rise and beckon.

313
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:49,295
Then all, all, save one, shall follow.

314
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,163
Morning, shipmates.

315
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,531
Morning.

316
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:57,436
May the heavens bless you.

317
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,634
Hey, you.

318
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:03,680
What's your name?
Elijah.

319
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:07,842
My name is Elijah.

320
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:20,630
Bible?
No, thank you.

321
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,293
Bible?
Thank you, ma'am.

322
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:31,299
Bible?

323
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,476
Don't whale it too much
on the lord's day,

324
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,646
But don't lose a fair chance either.

325
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,084
Climb, you sons of bachelors!

326
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:49,125
Jump, green pants!

327
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,455
You, Scotchcap!
Yes?

328
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:59,127
Spring! See we pack 3"% more
this year than the last.

329
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:26,020
Hoist the yards!

330
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,234
Go down, you blood red roses

331
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:36,272
Go down,and it's mighty drafty
round the cape of storms

332
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,342
Go down, you blood red roses

333
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:43,504
Go down,all you binks and boatswains

334
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,344
Go down, you blood red roses

335
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:48,213
Go down...

336
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:50,719
Take care of the butter.
20 cents a pound, it is.

337
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:52,516
Bildad, stop.

338
00:26:52,691 --> 00:26:55,125
Three years is a long while going.

339
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:57,956
God have you in his holy keeping.

340
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,563
Whales been found

341
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:02,564
Go down, you blood red roses

342
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,726
Go down.Avast! Heave it!

343
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:09,704
Heave it there.

344
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,708
Heave away.

345
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:15,403
They're glory bound for New York town

346
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,105
And dozens is bound for France

347
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:20,410
Heave away

348
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,246
My Johnny

349
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:25,413
Heave away

350
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:31,630
And some as dark as the Bengal bay...

351
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,125
And away

352
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:38,201
Me Johnny boy, we're all bound to go

353
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,771
Come all, you harbor sailors

354
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,602
Around the cape of storms

355
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:46,710
Heave away

356
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,675
My Johnny

357
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:51,839
Heave away...

358
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:57,949
You'll wish you'd never been born

359
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,351
And away

360
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:05,520
My Johnny boy,we're all bound to go

361
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:05,946
Up helm. Up helm!

362
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,923
Around the world!

363
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:14,395
Around the world!

364
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:16,431
Around the world!

365
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,594
Around the world!

366
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:29,740
The Pequod beat an easterly course

367
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:32,850
Toward the whaling
grounds off the Azores.

368
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,452
The crew came from
all the isles of the sea,

369
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,212
All the ends of the earth--

370
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,118
From Greenland to Mombasa,

371
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,317
From Clyde to Cocoboco.

372
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:44,189
Flask, the third mate,

373
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:46,353
Bullied everybody bigger than himself,

374
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:50,160
Particularly whales,
With whom he carried on a one-sided feud

375
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:52,132
As though the great leviathans

376
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:54,829
Had mortally insulted him
and his forebears,

377
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:56,997
And there was black little pip,

378
00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:59,234
The cabin boy from Alabama.

379
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,504
Second in command was Starbuck,

380
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,240
Whose Quaker stock
had furnished many a whaleboat

381
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:07,579
With its champion.
No crew sailor after pearls,

382
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,982
His courage was one of the great staples

383
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:12,453
Of the ship, like beef or flour--

384
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:16,822
There when required
And not to be foolishly wasted.

385
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:20,226
Ship's carpenter..
He fixed everything from stove boats

386
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:22,730
To broken arms and legs.

387
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,232
Perth, the blacksmith,

388
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:26,267
Lived amidst thick, hovering,

389
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:29,430
Flights of sparks.
He breathed them in and out.

390
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,371
The nested in his ears,

391
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,535
But Perth cared not because, as he said,

392
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:36,408
He was scorched all over,

393
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:39,607
And you cannot scorch a scar.

394
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,752
Queequeg was our first harpooneer.

395
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,251
Next, was Tashtego,

396
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:45,981
The lndian from a great
warrior race of red men,

397
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:48,718
Come to hunt whale instead of buffalo.

398
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:51,328
Then Daggoo, who got his boldness

399
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:55,364
And majesty and grace
From having killed a lion single-handed

400
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,729
And partaken of its flesh.

401
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:59,530
Stubb, the second mate--

402
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:01,604
Stubb, who'd have tied a bowline

403
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:04,173
ln the devil's tale for a joke--

404
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:10,303
Carefree, foolish, laughing, wise Stubb.

405
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,916
Of our supreme lord and dictator,

406
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,745
There was no sign.

407
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,447
Ahab stayed silent
behind his locked door

408
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:23,617
All the daylight hours.

409
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,413
lt's him again.

410
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,947
lt's Ahab.

411
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,449
Ahab come out in moonlight.

412
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,612
Strange.

413
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,849
Only at night.

414
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:34,522
Every night, all alone,
walking the deck.

415
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:48,312
Sand it. Olystone it, they say.

416
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,209
And when you're done, what happens?

417
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:53,112
Start o'er again, they say.

418
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:56,049
Clean it up. Sand it down.

419
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:57,882
Buff it off.

420
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,752
Keeps you busy, Lad.
No time for mischief.

421
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:04,918
Ah! Here we go.

422
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:22,677
Looming straight up and over us,

423
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:24,405
Like a solid-iron figurehead

424
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,641
Suddenly thrust into our vision,

425
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,015
Stood Captain Ahab.

426
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:31,519
His whole, high, broad form

427
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,284
Weighed down upon a barbaric white leg

428
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,950
Carved from the jawbone of a whale.

429
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:41,292
He did not feel the wind
or smell the salt air.

430
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:44,993
He only stood staring at the horizon

431
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,503
With the marks of some
inner crucifixion and woe

432
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:52,666
Deep in his face.

433
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:55,103
Mr. Starbuck.

434
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,774
Sir?
Call everybody aft.

435
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:03,177
All hands aft!

436
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:08,315
Down, mastheads!

437
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:21,229
What do you do
when you see a whale, men?

438
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:29,079
Sing out for him!
Aye! Aye! Aye!

439
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:32,944
Good. What do you do next?
Lower away after him!

440
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:35,586
And what tune is it you pull to, men?

441
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:39,087
A dead whale or a stove boat!

442
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:42,317
All you mastheaders...

443
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:45,486
Now hear me.

444
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:48,031
You're to look...

445
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,794
For a white whale.

446
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:58,466
A whale as white and big
as a mountain of snow.

447
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:05,974
You see this Spanish gold ounce?

448
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:13,348
Carpenter, hand me your top-maul.

449
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:20,520
Whosoever of ye finds me
that white whale,

450
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:28,127
Ye shall have this Spanish
gold ounce, my boys.

451
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:40,448
lt's a white whale, l say.

452
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:43,348
Skin your eyes for him.

453
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:45,148
Could it be the one

454
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:48,224
That fantails a little curious
before he go down?

455
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:51,794
Has he a curious spout..
All busy and mighty quick and high, sir?

456
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,487
And irons in his hide,

457
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:56,361
Many irons,
All twist around?

458
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,764
Aye, like corkscrews,

459
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:01,701
He's struck full of harpoons, men,

460
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:03,397
And his spout is a big one

461
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,304
Like a whole shock of wheat.

462
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:09,709
He fantails like
a broken jib in a storm.

463
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:13,840
Death, men, you've seen him.

464
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:16,043
lt's Moby Dick.

465
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:17,654
Captain Ahab,

466
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:23,818
Was it not Moby Dick took off thy leg?

467
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,994
Aye.

468
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:32,102
lt was Moby Dick

469
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,568
That tore my soul and body

470
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,142
Until they bled into each other.

471
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,642
Aye.

472
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:44,714
l'll follow him around the horn

473
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:47,977
And around the Norway maelstrom

474
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:51,280
And around perdition's flames

475
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:55,449
Before l give him up.

476
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:59,923
This is what you've shipped for, men.

477
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:04,762
To chase that white whale
on both sides of land

478
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:08,133
And over all sides of earth

479
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:13,505
Until he spouts black blood
and rolls dead out.

480
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:16,340
What say ye?

481
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:20,109
l think you do look brave.

482
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:22,446
Will you splice hands on it?

483
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,920
Aye, aye!
Steward, go draw great measure of grog.

484
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:29,218
Harpooneers, get your weapons.

485
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:32,693
Mates, your lances.

486
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:36,129
Ye mariners,
Now, ring me in,

487
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:39,065
That l may revive a noble custom

488
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:44,140
Of my fisherman fathers.

489
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:48,712
The measure. Drink and pass.

490
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,145
Round, round.
Quick drafts, long swallows, men.

491
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:54,877
lt's hot as Satan's hoof.

492
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:58,022
That way it went, this way it comes,

493
00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:01,488
lt spiralizes in ye.

494
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:04,025
Here. Hand it to me.

495
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:07,187
Well done. Almost drained.

496
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:10,357
Lance mates.

497
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:21,501
Cross your lances.

498
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:34,782
Now, let me touch the axis.

499
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:38,562
Do you feel it?

500
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,961
That same lightning which struck me

501
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:46,229
l now strike to this iron.

502
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:49,601
Does it burn, men?

503
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:52,766
Does it burn?

504
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:56,910
Harpooners, break your weapons.

505
00:38:57,081 --> 00:39:01,074
Turn up the sockets.

506
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,152
Now drink here, harpooneers,

507
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:11,784
Drink and swear.

508
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:14,523
God hunt us all

509
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:17,361
lf we do not hunt Moby Dick

510
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:20,527
To his death.

511
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:26,509
Death to Moby Dick!

512
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:29,044
Death to Moby Dick!

513
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:35,209
Yeah! Yeah! Death to Moby Dick!

514
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,893
Moby Dick.

515
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,129
Do they name certain whales, then?

516
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:57,832
Aye.
Special people-murdering whales

517
00:39:58,009 --> 00:39:59,271
With long histories.

518
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:03,005
Whales that have killed
10 times 100 men.

519
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:04,910
Whales like Timor Tim,

520
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,448
New Zealand Tom,

521
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:09,518
Or Morquan, king of the Japan seas.

522
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:13,145
Whales have big names
to go with big doings.

523
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,918
The biggest of them all is Moby Dick.

524
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:18,756
A white whale, Ahab said.

525
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,330
Can a whale be white?
He's white,

526
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:24,696
Whiter than all the snow that ever fell.

527
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:28,305
Like a great marble tombstone,
he is, afloat.

528
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:32,409
Wherever he swims,
white sky birds wheel above him.

529
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:35,171
Birds white as the angels.

530
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:37,780
Which oceans does he swim in?
All oceans.

531
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,850
He's been spied in different seas
1 ,000 mile apart

532
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:42,451
On the same day at the same hour.

533
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,417
Maybe he's a whole breed.

534
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:47,786
Maybe Moby Dick's 100 whales.

535
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:52,123
Then they all have crooked jaws
and wrinkled brows

536
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:56,027
And a dozen irons
stuck in their white humps.

537
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,035
Aye, many have lowered for
Moby Dick and struck him,

538
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,366
Only to know his vengeance.

539
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,600
Some have boasted they killed him,

540
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:08,974
But always he comes gliding back,

541
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:11,672
Huge and white

542
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:13,578
And secret-like,

543
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,446
lmmortal, they say.

544
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,020
You ain't trying to scare us, Manxman?

545
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:20,384
l say what l say.

546
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:22,583
There she blows!

547
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,387
Stern way to starboard!

548
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:27,053
There she blows!

549
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:28,789
There go flukes!

550
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,593
Flukes! Come down!

551
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:33,999
Starboard! Starboard!

552
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:38,165
Stow a line, Stubb!

553
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:41,034
Stow up the mainsail!

554
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:45,205
Sail away, boats!

555
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,917
Bet you a dollar we strike first!

556
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:54,081
Right, Stubb. A dollar you don't.

557
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:58,495
That's it, boys.

558
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:01,029
Pull, my men.

559
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,632
Why in the name of
gudgeons and ginger-cakes

560
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,598
Can't ye pull and start your eyes out?

561
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,136
Why don't you break
your backbones, boys?

562
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:14,302
Pull, then. Do pull, will you, please?

563
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:20,413
Pull, boys!

564
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:22,246
Pull!

565
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,685
Pull, blast ya! Take the oars off!

566
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:28,792
Take them off!

567
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:36,957
Pull, me good boys.

568
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:39,465
That's fine.

569
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:42,629
Pull.

570
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:46,836
Pull.

571
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:49,172
Pull, me good boys.

572
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:51,645
Pull it strong, boys.

573
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:55,650
Pull till you burst
all your livers and lungs!

574
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,152
Stop snoring, you sleepers!

575
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:00,552
Pull, can't ye? Pull!

576
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:03,717
There we are!

577
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,395
Fine.

578
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:10,557
That's fine.

579
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:12,560
Come on, men.

580
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:14,329
Pull ahead.

581
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:16,564
Pull long. That's it. Pull!

582
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:20,734
Pull, can't ye? Pull!

583
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:16,957
Man overboard!

584
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:20,894
Cut him loose!

585
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:27,201
Queequeg, my fine friend, Does this
sort of thing happen often?

586
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:30,363
True, true.

587
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:51,151
Heave away, boys!

588
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:17,652
And so we stripped our first whale

589
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:21,019
And boiled the blubber down
to a fine, pure oil

590
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:23,888
That would keep lamps
burning in 1 ,000 homes,

591
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:26,689
The clocks ticking
on their mantelpieces,

592
00:46:26,864 --> 00:46:32,166
And, perhaps, anoint the head of a king.

593
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,896
And when at last
we cast the whale's bared bones

594
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:36,767
lnto the sea,

595
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:42,937
We were in no way sad at its funeral.

596
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:11,672
Uhh!

597
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:13,503
Turn it off.

598
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:16,111
Oh! Captain.

599
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,272
Uh...

600
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:21,345
Starbuck?

601
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:23,282
Aye, captain.

602
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:26,048
lt's late. You should turn in.

603
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:28,487
Mmm.

604
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:31,093
Sleep?

605
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,457
That bed is a coffin,

606
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,158
And those are winding sheets.

607
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:41,327
l do not sleep. l die.

608
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:45,639
The prize furnished
85 barrels of oil, sir.

609
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,106
They're all capped and stored.

610
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:49,405
How is the wind?
North by east and steady.

611
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,710
Make the most of it.
l do not wish to linger here.

612
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:57,251
We're bound for the Pacific,
Starbuck, straightaway.

613
00:47:57,421 --> 00:48:00,322
You will plot
a course south by east to the line

614
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,426
And southeast to pick up
the guinea current.

615
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:05,755
Aye, aye, sir.

616
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,364
Mr. Starbuck...

617
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:10,796
Did you ever ponder
the movements of whales

618
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:13,198
Around the four oceans?

619
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,531
l only know that they appear
At certain feeding grounds

620
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:19,699
ln certain seasons.

621
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,703
Look here.

622
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:28,078
Log books from the time
New Bedford men first went a-whaling

623
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:32,018
Helped me draw this chart.

624
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:33,781
lt divides the oceans into areas

625
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:38,588
Of 5 degrees of latitude
by 5 of longitude.

626
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:41,322
Here are the months of the years,

627
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:43,295
The ships that passed,

628
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:45,230
How long they lingered,

629
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:47,267
The whales they saw--

630
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:51,966
What size, what color,
how many, where heading.

631
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:53,200
l never saw the like.

632
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:55,572
This way, the humpbacks go--

633
00:48:55,746 --> 00:48:57,179
The blue...

634
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,681
The right. The spermaceti--

635
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:03,012
Sea mile by sea mile.

636
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:04,381
l know their hidden journeys

637
00:49:04,555 --> 00:49:07,046
As l know the veins in my arm.

638
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:10,022
You mean their journeys can be foretold?

639
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:13,163
Aye, like the blood pumping in my veins

640
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,127
From heart to hand.

641
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:18,132
lf this be so,
We can follow along with the herds,

642
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:21,100
Killing as we go,
And fill our hold in record time.

643
00:49:21,272 --> 00:49:24,469
So we shall, Mr. Starbuck. So we shall...

644
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:30,137
Once we've attended to
our bigger business.

645
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,877
What is that business, captain?

646
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,111
Him, Mr. Starbuck.

647
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:40,314
Him.
What's true of the herds

648
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:44,154
Holds largely for the great
solitaries and hermits.

649
00:49:44,328 --> 00:49:48,822
lf these sources tell the truth
And my calk, not faulty,

650
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:51,832
He now swims the waters off good hope,

651
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:55,130
And all the lndian Ocean
lies before him.

652
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:58,207
Next month, he cruises the Bengal Bay,

653
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,935
March, the Sulu Sea,

654
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:02,544
Running eastward

655
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:06,080
To the gateway of the Pacific.

656
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,447
l shall be waiting for him...

657
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,349
Here...

658
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:15,515
At new moon in April.

659
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:25,527
Mr. Starbuck...
l must give the helmsman our course.

660
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:29,639
Come about, sir.

661
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:34,009
Why are you wearing that long face?

662
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:37,614
Are you not game for Moby Dick?

663
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:40,375
l am game for any kind of death

664
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:42,576
lf it comes in the way
Of the business we follow.

665
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:44,311
That be known,

666
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:48,185
But l came here to hunt whales,
Not my commander's vengeance.

667
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,157
How much sperm oil
will thy vengeance yield?

668
00:50:51,328 --> 00:50:53,592
What will it fetch on the market?

669
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:56,426
Money's not the measure, man.

670
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,797
lt will fetch me a great premium...

671
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,835
Here.

672
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:04,200
To be enraged with a dumb brute

673
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,741
That acted out of blind instinct...

674
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,538
ls blasphemous.

675
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:12,511
Speak not to me of blasphemy, man.

676
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:18,679
l'd strike the sun if it insulted me.

677
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,684
Look here, Starbuck,

678
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:27,661
All visible objects are
but as pasteboard masks--

679
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:30,265
Some inscrutable yet reasoning thing

680
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:33,267
Puts forth the molding
of their features.

681
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:37,430
The white whale tasks me.

682
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:40,600
He heaps me,

683
00:51:40,978 --> 00:51:43,378
Yet he is but a mask.

684
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:48,280
'Tis the thing behind
the mask l chiefly hate,

685
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:52,388
The malignant thing that
has plagued and frightened man

686
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:55,218
Since time began,

687
00:51:55,392 --> 00:51:59,351
The thing that mauls
and mutilates our race,

688
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,555
Not killing us outright,

689
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:03,723
But letting us live on

690
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:08,497
With half a heart and half a lung.

691
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:13,666
God keep us, keep us all.

692
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:18,814
The crew stands with me, Mr. Starbuck.

693
00:52:18,982 --> 00:52:22,975
You heard them swear.

694
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:26,816
Now...

695
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,982
What say ye?

696
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:34,025
Surely the best lance
out of all New Bedford

697
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:39,693
Will not hold back
from the greatest hunt of all.

698
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:41,802
l say calmly back to thee, sir,

699
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:44,202
l am against thee,

700
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:47,275
But thee needn't fear Starbuck.

701
00:52:47,444 --> 00:52:50,811
Let Ahab beware Ahab.

702
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:56,977
Beware thyself, my captain.

703
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:09,857
We left the winter seas behind

704
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:12,797
And sailed under the hot sun south,

705
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,770
South past the unseen sprawl of Africa,

706
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,601
Until we rounded the cape of storms

707
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:21,676
And steered a bold course
east and northeast

708
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:27,784
For the lndian Ocean and beyond.

709
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,183
You there, lad, go aloft.

710
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:33,346
Aye, aye, sir.

711
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:30,477
And so l served
my first watch in the masthead,

712
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,514
Held in a great gliding rhythm,

713
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:36,152
No life in me except that life imparted

714
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,312
By a gently rolling ship,

715
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:45,985
Remote from all the cares
of the people of the land.

716
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:57,705
There she blows!

717
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:00,968
There she blows!

718
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:02,668
Where away? How many?

719
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:04,211
Starboard, Mr. Stubb!

720
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:08,340
Ah. Two! No, four of them!

721
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:12,249
What's that again?
Six, seven of them!

722
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:14,913
There's three dozen more of them!

723
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:18,357
Look, look, Mr. Stubb, 100!

724
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:21,326
Come down from there!
The sun has baked your brains!

725
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:23,489
ln the name of god,

726
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:27,603
100, 200 whales!

727
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,978
Ahoy there!

728
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:32,951
Captain boomer knocking at your door.

729
00:58:33,123 --> 00:58:38,618
May he come in, sir?
Come aboard.

730
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:44,029
Captain boomer's my name, sir.

731
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:46,567
Ship's Samuel Enderby of London.
18 months at sea.

732
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,903
Ahab, will you look out there?

733
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:52,598
What a circus.
Did ever you see such a run?

734
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:54,573
Go it, boys! Go it!

735
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:58,544
Kill three for Captain Ahab
and three for me!

736
00:58:58,715 --> 00:59:00,876
Never fear. l'll not scuttle your ship.

737
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:02,313
She's a beauty, eh, captain?

738
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:06,353
Like mine so much l might have me
other arm cut off.

739
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:08,787
The very thing for
driving marlin spikes,

740
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:11,018
Knocking sense into
green seaman's heads,

741
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:14,925
And particularly good
for tapping kegs of rum,

742
00:59:15,098 --> 00:59:18,067
lf you get my meaning, captain.

743
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:22,228
Pip, fetch rum.

744
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:27,403
l see you're wearing
a bit of ivory yourself, sir.

745
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:30,273
Lubbers with four limbs
Don't know what they're missing.

746
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:33,712
When l got this ivory jib,
All spanking new and scientific,

747
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:37,718
Why, l could've thanked that whale.

748
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:40,254
Aye, a whale took me on
for his breakfast.

749
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:43,483
Devilish big he was--
Pushed a tidal wave ahead with his nose,

750
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,255
And typhoons jumped off his flukes
when they banged the water.

751
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,831
Old he was, and scarred
like Jerusalem's hills.

752
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:54,528
Captain Boomer, what was his color?

753
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:58,105
He was white, sir.
lt's a fact. He was snowy white.

754
00:59:58,275 --> 01:00:00,140
Had another chance at him a month ago.

755
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,642
You didn't kill him?

756
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:05,007
Oh, bless you, no. Went his merry way.

757
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:06,705
''Good riddance,'' said l.

758
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:09,477
Where did you last see the white whale?

759
01:00:09,653 --> 01:00:11,245
Off the cape of Good Hope.

760
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:17,917
He was heading northeast
towards Madagascar.

761
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:21,891
Starbuck! Starbuck!

762
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:24,158
Hear, hear!

763
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:27,770
The white whale
last month off Good Hope!

764
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:31,169
My chart is right and true!

765
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:34,970
He'll be off bikini
when the April moon is new.

766
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:37,010
Stop the hunt!

767
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,614
Pick up our boats. We're setting sail!

768
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:41,842
But, captain, those fine, big whales.

769
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:43,645
You men up there, get aloft.

770
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,152
l'll not sail with you, sir.

771
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:47,915
Bring my boat alongside.

772
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:50,389
Mr. Starbuck, cut loose that carcass.

773
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,120
Pip, signal the men to return to ship.

774
01:00:53,296 --> 01:00:54,593
What ails thee, sir?

775
01:00:54,764 --> 01:00:56,254
Are ye stove and sunk?

776
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:59,994
Captain Ahab, think what you're doing.
l beg thee. Think.

777
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,228
Set the mainsail!

778
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,395
No, sir, no!

779
01:01:03,573 --> 01:01:05,370
Mr. Starbuck, are you opposing me?

780
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:06,600
lf so, l'll have you know there is

781
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:09,176
One god that is lord over the earth.

782
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:12,543
And one captain over the Pequod.

783
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:16,710
Away now! Cut loose!

784
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:21,246
Flask, what do you make of that?

785
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,691
Return to ship.

786
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:27,489
You're not blind. Something's up.

787
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:29,894
That's my whale you're cutting loose!

788
01:01:30,066 --> 01:01:33,058
Hey!

789
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:39,472
Come aboard! We're setting sail!

790
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:43,874
Did you not see the pennant
or hear my command?

791
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:45,480
Yes, sir, we did!

792
01:01:45,648 --> 01:01:46,876
Then why don't you obey?

793
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:50,952
We will, as soon as it sinks in.
it bowled us over.

794
01:01:51,121 --> 01:01:54,113
This ship ain't sinking.
No one's lost overboard.

795
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,723
We've got a fine harvest here.

796
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:57,325
Don't see no reason to leave.

797
01:01:57,494 --> 01:02:00,395
l do not give reasons. l give orders.

798
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:02,190
Now, captain, we're good men.

799
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:04,833
We've been killing.

800
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:06,298
A hard thing to stop killing

801
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:10,565
When you've been killing steady, sir.
We've been killing so fast

802
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,641
We wouldn't have heard the last trumpet.

803
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,835
Then hear me now.

804
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:19,004
Come aboard.

805
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,249
All right, wake up!

806
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:25,411
Bestir yourselves.

807
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:41,927
This is an evil voyage, l tell you.

808
01:02:42,105 --> 01:02:44,699
lf Ahab has his way,

809
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:47,741
Thee nor me nor any member
of this ship's company

810
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:49,742
Will ever see home again.

811
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:51,471
Ah, come now, Mr. Starbuck.

812
01:02:51,648 --> 01:02:53,639
You're just plain gloomy.

813
01:02:53,817 --> 01:02:55,409
Moby Dick may be big,

814
01:02:55,585 --> 01:03:00,352
But he ain't that big.
l do not fear Moby Dick.

815
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:02,320
l fear the wrath of God.

816
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:04,983
The wrath of God?

817
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:08,289
lt is our task in life to kill whales

818
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:12,060
And furnish up their oil
For the lamps of the world.

819
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:15,102
lf we perform that task
well and faithfully,

820
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:18,638
We do a service to mankind
that pleases almighty God.

821
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:21,106
Aye.

822
01:03:21,277 --> 01:03:24,303
Ahab would deny all that.

823
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:26,847
He has taken us from the rich
harvest we were reaping

824
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:29,780
To satisfy his lust for vengeance.

825
01:03:29,953 --> 01:03:32,717
He is twisting that which is holy

826
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:36,052
lnto something dark and purposeless.

827
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:39,821
He is a champion of darkness.

828
01:03:39,996 --> 01:03:44,899
Ahab's red flag challenges the heavens.

829
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:46,660
Well, now, sir, if it's like that,

830
01:03:46,836 --> 01:03:48,827
l don't wonder at you, a religious man,

831
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:50,666
Lying a mite downcast.

832
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:55,539
On the other hand,
Don't much see what you can do about it.

833
01:03:55,712 --> 01:03:59,705
Listen to this.

834
01:04:07,857 --> 01:04:09,791
''A captain, who from private motives

835
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:11,688
''Employs his vessel to another purpose

836
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,557
''Than that intended by the owners

837
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:17,962
''ls answerable to
the charge of usurpation,

838
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:20,602
''And his crew is morally
and legally entitled

839
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,465
''To employ forceful means

840
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:28,373
ln wresting his command from him.''

841
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:31,946
Well, that's a mouthful. l swear.

842
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:34,049
Wrest his command from him?

843
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:35,912
Does that mean take over?

844
01:04:36,085 --> 01:04:38,883
lt does, Mr. Flask.

845
01:04:39,055 --> 01:04:45,551
Well, you ain't proposing
we do any such thing?

846
01:04:45,895 --> 01:04:48,386
You're in dangerous waters,
Mr. Starbuck.

847
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:50,692
Helm hard over. Come about.

848
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:53,995
Do thee not see that by serving Ahab,

849
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,604
We share in his blasphemy?

850
01:04:56,773 --> 01:04:58,741
Will thee risk that

851
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:02,036
Or stand with me and invoke the law?

852
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:07,775
Now, pardon me, sir, this is my watch.

853
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:09,475
Captains can't break the law.

854
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:13,679
They is the law as far as l'm concerned.

855
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:16,381
Aye, and Ahab's
a real fine captain, too.

856
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,993
Why, there ain't a man aboard,
except you maybe,

857
01:05:19,162 --> 01:05:20,857
Wouldn't rather be kicked by him

858
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:24,090
Than be knighted
by the queen of England.

859
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:25,859
l'm done, then.

860
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:27,798
You'll write thy last
will and testament.

861
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:33,967
Aye, and do it laughing, sir.

862
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:41,707
A laugh's the best answer
to all that's strange in life.

863
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:44,876
Ha ha ha!

864
01:05:57,367 --> 01:05:59,096
As we steered out toward bikini,

865
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:03,069
Ahab kept to his cabin
and was rarely seen.

866
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:06,936
The mastheads were
empty against the sky.

867
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:10,079
No cry of ''there she blows''
was to entice us

868
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:13,079
From his single purpose,

869
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:15,479
So, in April with a new moon,

870
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:17,882
We entered those waters where Ahab

871
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:24,050
Hoped to find the white whale.

872
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:34,469
Lookouts! Bestir yourselves!

873
01:06:34,637 --> 01:06:37,629
Lookouts up!

874
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:42,176
Look alive, lads! That gold belongs to

875
01:06:42,345 --> 01:06:43,471
Him with the sharpest eye!

876
01:06:43,646 --> 01:06:45,511
That coin's worth $16!

877
01:06:45,682 --> 01:06:47,775
l'll be first to sight the white whale!

878
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,918
Rum for me if l win the coin,

879
01:06:50,086 --> 01:06:54,523
Enough to dive into
and never reach bottom.

880
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:57,683
Aah!

881
01:06:58,061 --> 01:07:00,291
Man overboard! Man overboard!

882
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:03,398
Man overboard!

883
01:07:04,133 --> 01:07:07,125
Man overboard!

884
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:48,943
Not a sign of him.

885
01:07:49,112 --> 01:07:53,549
Yeah. Sea just swallowed him up.

886
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:56,708
Queer.

887
01:08:55,711 --> 01:08:59,044
April 1 9, 1842.

888
01:08:59,215 --> 01:09:02,844
Ahab's chart shows Moby Dick
and the new moon rising together,

889
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:05,715
But the moon's lost his horns,

890
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:12,384
And there ain't no sign
of the white whale yet.

891
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:19,629
Seven days and seven nights on watch.

892
01:09:19,802 --> 01:09:22,066
Ain't gone below, eats on deck,

893
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,035
Sleeps standing up.

894
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:30,203
How much longer can he hold?

895
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:03,406
Nothing moves.

896
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,047
Nothing.

897
01:10:06,215 --> 01:10:08,649
Since the lookout fell into the sea,

898
01:10:08,818 --> 01:10:12,777
The wind don't move,
The tide don't move.

899
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:15,185
Nothing.

900
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:18,191
Even the sun's nailed to the sky

901
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:24,857
Like that gold doubloon's
nailed to the mast.

902
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:29,601
You, lad,

903
01:10:29,772 --> 01:10:31,933
Pull that gold coin off the mast.

904
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:35,805
Throw it o'er the side.
Pay the sea a ransom.

905
01:10:35,978 --> 01:10:38,572
Maybe it'll come back
to life and bring us a wind.

906
01:10:38,748 --> 01:10:41,615
Manxman, stop!

907
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:43,843
A cool wind.

908
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:48,514
A cool wind.
You, Manxman, stop!

909
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:07,006
Queequeg, what are you doing?

910
01:11:07,176 --> 01:11:08,837
See tomorrow here.

911
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:13,004
Bones tell everything.

912
01:11:22,358 --> 01:11:25,691
Queequeg, what's the matter?

913
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:27,260
What do you see?

914
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,421
Get carpenter.

915
01:11:29,599 --> 01:11:35,367
What do you want the carpenter for?

916
01:11:35,538 --> 01:11:37,802
Carpenter!

917
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:42,468
Carpenter!
Here!

918
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:48,382
What can l do for you?

919
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:50,951
How much you build coffin for?

920
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,884
Coffin?

921
01:11:54,056 --> 01:11:56,388
Uh, $2.00 will do nicely.

922
01:11:56,559 --> 01:11:58,493
Hold on.
Build coffin.

923
01:11:58,661 --> 01:12:00,754
6 feet, 7 inch.

924
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,329
Clean wood.

925
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:06,025
Make like best boat.
Caulk and tar seams.

926
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:07,669
No water come in.

927
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:12,137
Carve chief's feather on lid.

928
01:12:12,308 --> 01:12:13,775
6 feet, 7, it'll be.

929
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:15,638
Queequeg, what's all this about?

930
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:17,438
Money yours.

931
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:23,279
Sea chest yours. My harpoon yours.

932
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:26,444
Goodbye.

933
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:32,888
What?

934
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:35,553
Queequeg, what are you talking about?

935
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,426
Queequeg!

936
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,397
Queequeg!

937
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:41,763
Queequeg, listen to me!

938
01:12:41,937 --> 01:12:44,929
Say something.

939
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:50,070
What are we going to do?
There's only one thing to do..

940
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:54,239
Build him his coffin.

941
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:31,142
Queequeg...

942
01:13:31,387 --> 01:13:35,380
You got to eat.

943
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:39,684
Drink water then.

944
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,290
Queequeg, if you go on like this,

945
01:13:42,465 --> 01:13:46,458
l shall be very angry.

946
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:53,031
Queequeg, l absolutely
forbid you to die.

947
01:13:57,546 --> 01:14:01,983
Queequeg...
Such behavior simply isn't Christian.

948
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:08,547
ln fact, it's--
lt's downright pagan and heathenish.

949
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:11,617
Queequeg...

950
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:13,421
Remember our oath?

951
01:14:13,596 --> 01:14:16,429
You promised to go where l go,
Eat what l eat,

952
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:18,965
Ship on my ship.

953
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:22,434
l hold you to your promise, Queequeg.

954
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:26,974
l've seen this before, lad.

955
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:29,475
One day, for no reason,

956
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:31,806
They know that death is near.

957
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:33,278
They give away all their belongings

958
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:36,247
And say goodbye,

959
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:39,512
Then they sit down to wait...

960
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:42,748
And they just die.

961
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:48,921
Mr. Starbuck, sir, captain wants you.

962
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:12,110
Sir?

963
01:15:13,522 --> 01:15:17,515
Starbuck, new orders.

964
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:24,323
We remain here
until eight bells tonight,

965
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:29,034
At which time we'll lower whaleboats,

966
01:15:29,205 --> 01:15:32,834
Head the ship north...

967
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:36,171
And row out of these waters.

968
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:42,341
Aye, aye, sir. At eight bells.

969
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:50,882
l'm beatin' a march to you, Queequeg.
Get along.

970
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:09,104
Get along quiet now, Queequeg.
You follow the tide.

971
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:13,271
lt knows where to go.

972
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,750
You get along with it.
lt'll take you, Queequeg.

973
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:23,915
Get along.

974
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:28,696
Get ready today.

975
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:31,856
Any day now.

976
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:38,029
He won't listen.

977
01:16:38,908 --> 01:16:44,403
Queequeg's going away.
Know where he's going?

978
01:16:45,514 --> 01:16:50,508
Way, way off to Cocoboco.

979
01:16:53,822 --> 01:16:59,818
Back to Cocoboco, where he came from.

980
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,975
Queequeg, don't!

981
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:31,551
There she blows!
Queequeg, listen to me! Don't!

982
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,450
There she blows!

983
01:18:34,623 --> 01:18:37,387
There she blows!

984
01:18:37,559 --> 01:18:41,120
There she blows!

985
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:43,821
Off the starboard beam!

986
01:18:43,999 --> 01:18:47,992
There she blows!

987
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:54,134
lt's him.

988
01:18:54,309 --> 01:18:58,302
l know it's him.

989
01:19:00,315 --> 01:19:02,681
ls it real?

990
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:04,216
Do you see it, too?

991
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:06,718
Aye, we all see it.

992
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:09,949
But that don't mean it's real,
necessarily.

993
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,990
Clear away the boats.

994
01:19:12,161 --> 01:19:14,391
Lower for him now, sir? At night?

995
01:19:14,563 --> 01:19:17,088
Lower away.

996
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:20,258
Away boats.

997
01:20:04,646 --> 01:20:07,638
He sounded.

998
01:20:09,651 --> 01:20:12,643
Ship oars.

999
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:12,241
He's near.

1000
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:15,815
He's very near.

1001
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:19,977
Be ready for him.

1002
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,392
He breaches!

1003
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:47,443
The birds, they go.

1004
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:49,345
God, l'll lose him.

1005
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:55,514
Without a wind, we'll lose him!

1006
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:05,600
That ain't no whale.
That a great white god.

1007
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:08,269
About!
Back to the ship!

1008
01:22:08,437 --> 01:22:14,433
We'll tie on and row for a wind.

1009
01:22:16,245 --> 01:22:18,145
Long days and nights

1010
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:20,543
We strained at the oars,

1011
01:22:20,716 --> 01:22:23,583
While the white whale swam freely on,

1012
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:26,516
Widening the waters between himself

1013
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:30,681
And Ahab's vengeance.

1014
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:38,722
A cloud...

1015
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,892
On starboard beam.

1016
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:44,038
Steer for the cloud, men.

1017
01:22:44,206 --> 01:22:46,197
Bring her around...

1018
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:47,740
Toward the cloud!

1019
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:50,901
Starboard!

1020
01:22:57,886 --> 01:22:59,717
Pull! Quick!

1021
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:01,856
Pull us into it, boys!

1022
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:05,016
Quick!

1023
01:23:07,663 --> 01:23:10,154
Pull!

1024
01:23:10,332 --> 01:23:12,823
That's it!

1025
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:15,469
There!

1026
01:23:15,637 --> 01:23:18,629
There!

1027
01:23:43,332 --> 01:23:46,324
You raised the white whale first.

1028
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:49,095
The gold doubloon is yours.

1029
01:23:49,271 --> 01:23:54,265
Go on. Take it, sailor.

1030
01:23:57,746 --> 01:24:00,613
Wait now. Listen.

1031
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:05,345
This man has his Spanish gold ounce.

1032
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,353
You shall have yours.

1033
01:24:08,523 --> 01:24:11,253
When Moby Dick is struck and killed,

1034
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:15,385
On that day, You shall have my share--

1035
01:24:15,564 --> 01:24:18,226
My 10"% of the profits

1036
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,460
Of this entire voyage.

1037
01:24:21,636 --> 01:24:25,470
Aye!
Gold will pour out of Moby Dick's wounds

1038
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,267
lnto your hands.

1039
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:30,536
Every drop of his blood--

1040
01:24:30,712 --> 01:24:33,146
Another Spanish doubloon!

1041
01:24:33,315 --> 01:24:36,876
What say you to that, men?

1042
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:38,849
Sing out!

1043
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,250
They're all dumfounded, sir,

1044
01:24:41,423 --> 01:24:45,917
And so am l.
Hooray for captain Ahab!

1045
01:24:50,432 --> 01:24:52,297
Pip, grog all around.

1046
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:58,463
A sail, sir, to starboard.

1047
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:01,166
The rachel out of New Bedford.

1048
01:25:01,343 --> 01:25:07,839
Captain Gardiner's ship.
She's coming around.

1049
01:25:09,451 --> 01:25:13,182
Captain Ahab!
Have you seen a whale boat adrift?

1050
01:25:13,355 --> 01:25:15,516
l've seen nothing!

1051
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:17,681
Have you seen the white whale?

1052
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:19,258
We have found him

1053
01:25:19,428 --> 01:25:21,692
Not 10 miles from this spot!

1054
01:25:21,863 --> 01:25:23,558
Not dead.

1055
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:25,893
You didn't...Kill him?

1056
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:30,595
No! We lost a boat
towed out of sight by him!

1057
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:32,967
Three days and nights we've searched!

1058
01:25:33,141 --> 01:25:35,336
My boy was in it! My own son!

1059
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,502
12 years old!

1060
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:42,015
Captain Ahab, will you help me search?

1061
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,152
We are Christians.
We cannot refuse this mate.

1062
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:47,618
You will! l know you will help!

1063
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:49,723
You must! Oh, you must,

1064
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:55,887
And you shall do this thing for me!

1065
01:25:57,365 --> 01:25:59,333
lf thee say no,
we'll be in black disgrace.

1066
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:02,197
At home, they'll spit
at the mention of the Pequod's name.

1067
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:05,339
Captain Ahab! Answer me!

1068
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:07,702
Captain Gardiner...

1069
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:10,572
l seek the white whale!

1070
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:14,806
Your own son's murderer!

1071
01:26:14,983 --> 01:26:17,349
l am losing time.

1072
01:26:17,519 --> 01:26:20,886
Time? l've lost my whole world!

1073
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:25,550
l will not go!
l will follow till you say ''aye'' to me.

1074
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:28,525
Come, men! Stand by to lower!

1075
01:26:28,697 --> 01:26:30,494
l am coming over, captain!

1076
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:32,997
Avast! Touch not a rope!

1077
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:34,760
l must go!

1078
01:26:34,936 --> 01:26:38,303
Goodbye, l say, And fare thee well.

1079
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:42,000
God help you, Captain Gardiner!

1080
01:26:42,177 --> 01:26:44,372
God forgive you...

1081
01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:47,538
Captain Ahab.

1082
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:01,891
Stoke up the triworks.

1083
01:27:02,063 --> 01:27:05,555
We shall run forward laden with fire

1084
01:27:05,734 --> 01:27:07,998
To render the white whale's flesh

1085
01:27:08,169 --> 01:27:10,034
lnto one holy oil.

1086
01:27:10,205 --> 01:27:13,106
Blacksmith...

1087
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:17,268
l set ye a task.

1088
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:24,281
Take these harpoons and lances,

1089
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:27,615
Melt them down. Forge me new weapons

1090
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:31,520
That will strike deep and hold fast.

1091
01:27:31,693 --> 01:27:34,218
But do not douse them in water.

1092
01:27:34,396 --> 01:27:37,832
They must have a proper Baptism.

1093
01:27:37,999 --> 01:27:40,524
What say ye, all ye men?

1094
01:27:40,702 --> 01:27:42,294
Will you give as much blood

1095
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:45,564
As shall be needed to temper the steel?

1096
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:50,234
Aye! Aye! Aye!
To my anchor, now add your own.

1097
01:27:51,546 --> 01:27:55,209
You be the cogs that fit my wheel...

1098
01:27:55,383 --> 01:28:00,286
The gunpowder that takes my torch.

1099
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:02,047
Pledge yourselves

1100
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:04,817
Heart...

1101
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:07,894
Soul...

1102
01:28:08,063 --> 01:28:11,055
Body...

1103
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:12,756
Life and love...

1104
01:28:12,934 --> 01:28:14,697
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

1105
01:28:14,869 --> 01:28:18,862
As l pledge myself.

1106
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,508
Death...

1107
01:28:21,676 --> 01:28:24,201
To Moby Dick.

1108
01:28:24,379 --> 01:28:27,371
Death. Death.

1109
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,315
Up helm!

1110
01:29:05,487 --> 01:29:09,480
And the wind aft!

1111
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:26,430
Hold it!

1112
01:29:28,109 --> 01:29:30,441
Sir, shall l shorten sail?

1113
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:35,606
No. She runs well enough.

1114
01:29:39,821 --> 01:29:42,517
Weather main-brace!

1115
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:45,683
Clear the yards!

1116
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:47,851
Clear the yards!

1117
01:29:48,029 --> 01:29:52,022
Clear the yards!

1118
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:55,531
The braces, men!

1119
01:29:55,704 --> 01:29:58,696
Haul away!

1120
01:30:17,559 --> 01:30:21,325
Haul away! Lay on your backs and haul!

1121
01:30:21,496 --> 01:30:25,489
Earn your salt!

1122
01:30:25,834 --> 01:30:27,631
By all, let's hurry, captain!

1123
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:29,929
We'll lose every inch of canvas

1124
01:30:30,105 --> 01:30:32,130
lf we don't leave the ship!

1125
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:33,706
Mr. Starbuck,

1126
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:36,673
We're three days behind Moby Dick!

1127
01:30:36,845 --> 01:30:39,541
This wind is heaven-sent!

1128
01:30:39,714 --> 01:30:45,710
Heaven-sent to destroy us.

1129
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:49,488
Tear away those rags!

1130
01:30:49,657 --> 01:30:53,093
Get new canvas aloft!

1131
01:30:53,261 --> 01:30:54,421
All hands...

1132
01:30:54,596 --> 01:30:56,530
Tend sails!

1133
01:30:56,698 --> 01:30:59,758
Aye, aye, sir.
Get aloft.

1134
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:01,595
Get aloft!

1135
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:05,763
They'll trammel under!

1136
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:11,208
Aloft with ye!

1137
01:31:11,379 --> 01:31:14,371
Aloft!

1138
01:31:16,217 --> 01:31:17,377
Get up there!

1139
01:31:17,552 --> 01:31:20,544
Get aloft!

1140
01:32:07,068 --> 01:32:09,263
Captain, we cannot get more canvas up

1141
01:32:09,437 --> 01:32:13,931
ln this wind!
We must!

1142
01:32:19,047 --> 01:32:23,040
She won't come up!

1143
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:36,661
The masts!

1144
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:38,765
Cut them away!

1145
01:32:38,933 --> 01:32:41,163
Cut! lt's away with the masts,

1146
01:32:41,336 --> 01:32:44,328
Or we capsize!

1147
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:54,404
The masts! Cut the masts!

1148
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:59,409
Cut the mast!

1149
01:33:22,911 --> 01:33:25,903
Starbuck!

1150
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:39,883
That's all.

1151
01:33:40,461 --> 01:33:43,396
That's all, l say.

1152
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:47,557
l'll run you through.

1153
01:34:08,389 --> 01:34:11,552
St. Elmo's fires!

1154
01:34:11,726 --> 01:34:14,524
Have mercy on us!

1155
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:16,630
Aye...

1156
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:19,767
Men!

1157
01:34:19,934 --> 01:34:22,903
Mark it well!

1158
01:34:23,071 --> 01:34:29,067
lt lights our way to the white whale!

1159
01:34:41,055 --> 01:34:42,613
Thus...

1160
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:44,985
l put out...

1161
01:34:45,159 --> 01:34:46,922
The last...

1162
01:34:47,095 --> 01:34:50,087
Fear!

1163
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:03,169
Clear away! Raise new sail!

1164
01:35:03,344 --> 01:35:06,370
We're running on! Jump, my hearties!

1165
01:35:06,547 --> 01:35:09,539
Jump now!

1166
01:35:12,587 --> 01:35:15,647
Where are the crew of the Pequod?

1167
01:35:15,823 --> 01:35:19,589
There is not one face l know among 30.

1168
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:22,559
He has snatched their souls.

1169
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:25,290
Look at them.
They are gloves.

1170
01:35:25,466 --> 01:35:28,094
Ahab fills them. Ahab moves them.

1171
01:35:28,269 --> 01:35:29,930
You must admit, Mr. Starbuck.

1172
01:35:30,104 --> 01:35:32,197
He called that typhoon's bluff.

1173
01:35:32,373 --> 01:35:34,603
Stood toe-to-toe with the bully,

1174
01:35:34,776 --> 01:35:37,768
Traded blows with it
till it hollered ''help!''

1175
01:35:37,945 --> 01:35:40,140
Did you see how he
grabbed St. Elmo's fire

1176
01:35:40,314 --> 01:35:44,375
By the tail?
Only Ahab would do that.

1177
01:35:44,552 --> 01:35:48,886
l see a madman beget more madmen.

1178
01:35:49,057 --> 01:35:52,424
Yet could l cure their madness now?

1179
01:35:52,593 --> 01:35:55,562
Great god, where art thou?

1180
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:59,029
Shall l? Shall l?

1181
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:02,135
Heave up!

1182
01:36:02,637 --> 01:36:05,629
Avast!

1183
01:36:28,663 --> 01:36:31,325
lt's a mild, mild day, Starbuck.

1184
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:35,492
Mild-looking sky.

1185
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:38,672
On such a day, l struck my first whale.

1186
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,799
A boy harpooneer. 40, 40, aye.

1187
01:36:42,977 --> 01:36:48,973
40 years and a thousand lowerings ago.

1188
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:51,945
Why this madness of the chase,

1189
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,612
This boiling blood and smoking brow?

1190
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:58,054
Why pulls he the arm of the oar,

1191
01:36:58,226 --> 01:37:03,163
The iron and the lance?

1192
01:37:04,132 --> 01:37:06,862
l feel old, Starbuck,

1193
01:37:07,034 --> 01:37:09,594
And bowed,

1194
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:12,000
As though l were Adam...

1195
01:37:12,173 --> 01:37:15,836
Staggering under the piled centuries

1196
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:20,003
Since paradise.

1197
01:37:22,383 --> 01:37:24,544
Stand close, Starbuck.

1198
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:29,213
Close to me.
Let me look into a human eye.

1199
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:34,952
lt is better
Than to gaze into sea or sky.

1200
01:37:42,403 --> 01:37:44,598
Captain, now for the last time,
l ask thee.

1201
01:37:44,772 --> 01:37:47,673
l implore thee.
Let us fly these deadly waters.

1202
01:37:47,842 --> 01:37:49,707
Let us home.

1203
01:37:49,877 --> 01:37:52,710
Have they not such
mild blue days even as this

1204
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,873
ln old New Bedford?

1205
01:37:57,952 --> 01:38:00,944
What is it?

1206
01:38:01,122 --> 01:38:03,283
That nameless...

1207
01:38:03,457 --> 01:38:06,893
lnscrutable, unearthly thing...

1208
01:38:07,061 --> 01:38:08,585
Commands me against

1209
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:12,563
All human lovings and longings...

1210
01:38:12,733 --> 01:38:14,360
To keep pushing and crowding

1211
01:38:14,535 --> 01:38:17,732
And jamming myself on all the time,

1212
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:21,272
Making me do
What in my own natural heart

1213
01:38:21,442 --> 01:38:24,377
l dare not dream of doing?

1214
01:38:24,545 --> 01:38:27,139
ls Ahab Ahab?

1215
01:38:27,315 --> 01:38:28,942
ls it l,

1216
01:38:29,116 --> 01:38:31,050
God, or who

1217
01:38:31,219 --> 01:38:34,313
That lifts this arm?

1218
01:38:34,488 --> 01:38:37,116
What if the great sun cannot move

1219
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:41,284
Except by God's invisible power?

1220
01:38:41,462 --> 01:38:44,226
How can my small heart beat,

1221
01:38:44,398 --> 01:38:47,026
My brain think thoughts

1222
01:38:47,201 --> 01:38:49,362
Unless God does that beating,

1223
01:38:49,537 --> 01:38:53,064
Does that thinking.Does that living,

1224
01:38:53,241 --> 01:38:56,233
And not l?

1225
01:38:58,179 --> 01:39:01,114
By heavens, man,

1226
01:39:01,282 --> 01:39:04,877
We are turned round and round

1227
01:39:05,052 --> 01:39:06,542
ln this world.

1228
01:39:06,721 --> 01:39:08,951
Like yonder windlass,

1229
01:39:09,123 --> 01:39:10,249
And fate

1230
01:39:10,424 --> 01:39:13,325
ls the handspike.

1231
01:39:13,494 --> 01:39:18,488
And all the time, that smiling sky...

1232
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:22,568
And this unsounded sea...

1233
01:39:22,737 --> 01:39:25,365
Look ye into its deeps

1234
01:39:25,539 --> 01:39:27,564
And see the everlasting slaughter

1235
01:39:27,742 --> 01:39:31,075
That goes on.
Who put it into its creatures

1236
01:39:31,245 --> 01:39:34,180
To chase and fang one another?

1237
01:39:34,348 --> 01:39:37,613
Where do murderers go, man?

1238
01:39:37,785 --> 01:39:40,379
Who is to doom when the judge himself

1239
01:39:40,554 --> 01:39:45,355
ls dragged before the bar?

1240
01:39:45,526 --> 01:39:48,654
But it is a mild, mild day

1241
01:39:48,829 --> 01:39:53,823
And a mild-looking sky.

1242
01:39:56,871 --> 01:40:01,240
What ails you, Starbuck?

1243
01:40:01,409 --> 01:40:04,537
Why do you tremble so?

1244
01:40:04,712 --> 01:40:07,078
Because l do not have
the bowels to slaughter thee

1245
01:40:07,248 --> 01:40:08,715
And save the whole ship's company

1246
01:40:08,883 --> 01:40:12,717
From being dragged to doom.

1247
01:40:12,887 --> 01:40:15,947
Oh, l plainly exceed my miserable office

1248
01:40:16,123 --> 01:40:18,956
To obey rebelling.

1249
01:40:19,126 --> 01:40:23,620
We're still to help thee
to thine impious end.

1250
01:40:23,798 --> 01:40:27,632
Starbuck, ye are tied to me.

1251
01:40:27,802 --> 01:40:30,862
This act is immutably decreed.

1252
01:40:31,038 --> 01:40:34,201
lt was rehearsed by ye and me

1253
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:35,501
A billion years

1254
01:40:35,676 --> 01:40:40,670
Before this ocean rolled.

1255
01:40:46,721 --> 01:40:49,246
Air.

1256
01:40:49,423 --> 01:40:51,755
Air.

1257
01:40:51,926 --> 01:40:57,421
Do you smell it, lads,
What the wind carries?

1258
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,799
Sm-smells like land.

1259
01:41:00,968 --> 01:41:02,697
Like an island.
Aye.

1260
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:05,566
A coral reef, green moss, shells,

1261
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:07,765
Bits and pieces from all the oceans

1262
01:41:07,942 --> 01:41:09,273
He ever swam through.

1263
01:41:09,443 --> 01:41:13,436
An island to himself is the white whale.

1264
01:41:13,614 --> 01:41:16,606
Elijah.

1265
01:41:17,084 --> 01:41:18,949
What say you, lad?

1266
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,246
The day we sailed,

1267
01:41:20,421 --> 01:41:24,221
A man s--
Elijah, his name was.

1268
01:41:24,392 --> 01:41:27,293
Well?
He said...

1269
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:29,929
He said a day will come at sea

1270
01:41:30,097 --> 01:41:33,191
When you smell land
where there be no land.

1271
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:34,527
And on that day,

1272
01:41:34,702 --> 01:41:37,762
Ahab will go to his grave.

1273
01:41:37,938 --> 01:41:40,668
But...He will rise again

1274
01:41:40,841 --> 01:41:43,503
And beckon.

1275
01:41:43,677 --> 01:41:46,168
And then all...

1276
01:41:46,347 --> 01:41:49,339
All...

1277
01:41:49,517 --> 01:41:55,513
All, save one, shall follow.

1278
01:41:55,956 --> 01:41:57,651
There she blows!

1279
01:41:57,825 --> 01:42:01,761
There she blows!

1280
01:42:08,536 --> 01:42:11,528
Look.

1281
01:42:13,107 --> 01:42:14,335
Mastheaders,

1282
01:42:14,508 --> 01:42:16,476
The birds mark the place.

1283
01:42:16,644 --> 01:42:19,078
Watch the birds!

1284
01:42:19,246 --> 01:42:22,238
Helmsman, lock the point.

1285
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:25,908
Stand by the boats! Down together!

1286
01:42:26,086 --> 01:42:27,485
Same old bit, sir?

1287
01:42:27,655 --> 01:42:30,647
Aye.

1288
01:42:37,231 --> 01:42:39,062
No, pip. Stay on board.

1289
01:42:39,233 --> 01:42:40,564
You'll be captain in my absence.

1290
01:42:40,734 --> 01:42:48,231
Stand ye there on the deck in my place.
Lower away!

1291
01:42:50,511 --> 01:42:52,877
l'm captain pip.

1292
01:42:53,047 --> 01:42:55,242
Oh, did you see him, men?

1293
01:42:55,416 --> 01:42:59,750
Did you see his hump?
Like a great snow hill.

1294
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,912
Did you see the way he slides along?

1295
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:05,558
Oh, there's majesty for you.

1296
01:43:05,726 --> 01:43:07,785
Don't look.

1297
01:43:07,962 --> 01:43:11,955
l'll look for you.

1298
01:43:12,867 --> 01:43:15,859
Did you see the lances in his back?

1299
01:43:16,036 --> 01:43:18,027
My lances.

1300
01:43:18,205 --> 01:43:19,502
Mine.

1301
01:43:19,673 --> 01:43:23,666
Strucken in years ago.

1302
01:43:25,212 --> 01:43:27,146
Heads, my lads.

1303
01:43:27,314 --> 01:43:29,248
Wrack the oars off.

1304
01:43:29,416 --> 01:43:33,182
Lay into it. Pull there, boys!

1305
01:43:33,354 --> 01:43:38,291
Pull, you green-faced posies!

1306
01:43:38,459 --> 01:43:40,518
Long and strong, men.

1307
01:43:40,694 --> 01:43:43,094
Shake your bones, men.

1308
01:43:43,264 --> 01:43:45,232
Break in twos.

1309
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:48,334
Ah, Moby Dick, blow your trump.

1310
01:43:48,502 --> 01:43:50,299
Blister your lungs.

1311
01:43:50,471 --> 01:43:55,465
We'll dam off your blood.

1312
01:44:12,493 --> 01:44:15,485
Pull soft now.

1313
01:44:23,871 --> 01:44:26,863
He sounded.

1314
01:44:28,175 --> 01:44:31,144
Ship oars.

1315
01:45:35,075 --> 01:45:37,270
Rise now, ye white whale.

1316
01:45:37,444 --> 01:45:40,845
Show us your crooked jaw.

1317
01:45:41,015 --> 01:45:45,418
Show us your wrinkled brow.

1318
01:45:45,586 --> 01:45:48,578
Rise.

1319
01:45:49,957 --> 01:45:52,084
The birds.

1320
01:45:52,259 --> 01:45:54,193
The birds!

1321
01:45:54,361 --> 01:45:57,353
He rises!

1322
01:46:01,502 --> 01:46:03,231
ln!

1323
01:46:03,404 --> 01:46:07,397
ln and after him!

1324
01:46:13,247 --> 01:46:16,239
Ride!

1325
01:46:40,541 --> 01:46:42,304
Pull in!

1326
01:46:42,476 --> 01:46:45,468
Pull in!

1327
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:57,079
Let the men go!

1328
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:02,255
Pull in, men! Closer!

1329
01:47:02,429 --> 01:47:05,592
He'll not escape!

1330
01:47:05,766 --> 01:47:11,762
Thunder and hell! What's wrong with ye?

1331
01:47:17,778 --> 01:47:20,770
Damn ye!

1332
01:47:24,618 --> 01:47:29,112
Oh, ye whale!
Ye damned whale!

1333
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,277
Ahab!

1334
01:48:00,454 --> 01:48:03,446
Ahab!

1335
01:48:40,227 --> 01:48:42,855
From hell's heart,

1336
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:44,930
l stab at thee!

1337
01:48:45,098 --> 01:48:47,692
For hate's sake,

1338
01:48:47,868 --> 01:48:53,363
l spit my last breath at thee!

1339
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:57,533
Oh, damned whale!

1340
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:30,367
All right. No more of this.
Back to the Pequod. No more of this.

1341
01:49:40,687 --> 01:49:44,623
You see? Do you see?

1342
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:46,622
Ahab beckons.

1343
01:49:46,793 --> 01:49:51,093
He's dead, but he beckons.

1344
01:49:51,265 --> 01:49:55,201
Head after him!

1345
01:49:55,369 --> 01:49:56,631
After him!

1346
01:49:56,803 --> 01:50:00,466
After that devil?
Moby Dick's no devil! He's a whale!

1347
01:50:00,641 --> 01:50:03,610
A monstrous big whale, aye,
but a whale, no more.

1348
01:50:03,777 --> 01:50:05,608
And we're whaling men, no less.

1349
01:50:05,779 --> 01:50:08,475
We do not turn from whales.
We kill them.

1350
01:50:08,649 --> 01:50:11,015
We'll kill Moby Dick!

1351
01:50:11,184 --> 01:50:14,119
Pull!

1352
01:50:14,288 --> 01:50:17,416
Well, ye heard Mr. Starbuck, didn't ye?

1353
01:50:17,591 --> 01:50:19,559
Didn't ye?

1354
01:50:19,726 --> 01:50:22,024
Be ye whaling men or no?

1355
01:50:22,195 --> 01:50:23,753
Pull, ye sheepheads.

1356
01:50:23,931 --> 01:50:26,923
Pull!

1357
01:50:35,809 --> 01:50:38,403
You should not have come back,
ye grinning whale.

1358
01:50:38,578 --> 01:50:44,574
We'll cut new mouths in ye to grin with.

1359
01:51:12,179 --> 01:51:13,976
Aah! Aah!

1360
01:51:14,147 --> 01:51:17,139
Aah! Aah!

1361
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:20,943
Aah! Aah!

1362
01:51:25,092 --> 01:51:28,084
Aah!

1363
01:51:54,755 --> 01:51:57,747
Aah!

1364
01:53:47,334 --> 01:53:49,165
The coffin.

1365
01:53:49,336 --> 01:53:51,361
Drowned Queequeg's coffin

1366
01:53:51,538 --> 01:53:53,301
Was my life buoy.

1367
01:53:53,473 --> 01:53:56,340
For one whole day and night,
lt sustained me

1368
01:53:56,510 --> 01:54:00,002
On that soft and dirge-like main.

1369
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:02,273
Then a sail appeared.

1370
01:54:02,449 --> 01:54:04,883
lt was the Rachel.

1371
01:54:05,051 --> 01:54:07,918
The Rachel,
Who in her long melancholy search

1372
01:54:08,088 --> 01:54:11,216
For her missing children....

1373
01:54:11,391 --> 01:54:15,122
Found another orphan.

1374
01:54:15,295 --> 01:54:17,354
The drama's done.

1375
01:54:17,531 --> 01:54:20,398
All are departed away.

1376
01:54:20,567 --> 01:54:22,330
The great shroud of the sea

1377
01:54:22,502 --> 01:54:26,370
Rolls over the Pequod, her crew...

1378
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:28,906
And Moby Dick.

1379
01:54:29,075 --> 01:54:31,100
l only am escaped,

1380
01:54:31,278 --> 01:54:32,404
Alone,

1381
01:54:32,579 --> 01:54:35,548
To tell thee.
