1
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,790
Call me Ishmael.

2
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,314
Some years ago,
having little or no money...

3
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,597
I thought I would sail about
and see the oceans of the world.

4
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,989
Whenever I get grim and spleenful...

5
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,516
whenever I feel like
knocking people's hats off in the street...

6
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,751
whenever it's a damp,
drizzly November in my soul...

7
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,832
I know that it's high time
to get to sea again.

8
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,480
Choose any path you please...

9
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,120
and ten to one,
it carries you down to water.

10
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,716
There's a magic in water
that draws all men away from the land...

11
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,078
Leads them over the hills down creeks,
and streams, and rivers to the sea.

12
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,189
The sea...

13
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,875
where each man, as in a mirror,
finds himself.

14
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,197
And so it was
I duly arrived at the town of New Bedford...

15
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,199
on a stormy Saturday late in the year 1841.

16
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,110
- Rum.
- Rum it is. What mark?

17
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,590
To this a penny, to that another penny,
and so on to the top of the glass.

18
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,717
The Cape Horn measure, which
you may drink down for a full shilling.

19
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,189
The penny mark. Nay, the full shilling.

20
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,031
You'll be wanting a room tonight.

21
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,793
You ain't no objections to sharing
a harpooneer's bed with him, have you?

22
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,189
- You going whaling?
- That is my intention.

23
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,636
You need permission. You weren't born
and bred in New Bedford, were you?

24
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,994
No, I'm a stranger here.

25
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,435
- Then you'll have to have permission.
- Permission?

26
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,274
Aye. From us, the men of New Bedford.
The sea is ours.

27
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,590
Other seamen only have
a right of way through it.

28
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,069
And the whale is ours. Ours alone.

29
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,675
No one else may hunt it down and kill it,
unless we say so.

30
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,318
Do you dispute that?

31
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,192
- I do not.
- Good.

32
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,674
Then you have our permission
to sail our sea.

33
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,516
Drink to this boy, mates?

34
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,718
Big whales to you, mate!

35
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,834
Can whales do that?

36
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,036
Why, bless me, whales can do anything!

37
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,429
A whale can jump up like an earthquake...

38
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,354
and come down on you like
a mountain that's somehow put to sea.

39
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,193
A whale can stave in the ribs
of the biggest ships...

40
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,158
swallow whole crews,
pick its teeth with the oars.

41
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,471
Mind, lad, if God ever wanted to be a fish,
he'd be a whale.

42
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,710
Believe that, he'd be a whale.

43
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,515
Ahab.

44
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,399
Who's Ahab?

45
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,518
Captain Ahab to you.

46
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,995
- Who's Captain Ahab?
- Aye.

47
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,712
Ahab's Ahab.

48
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,714
Music.

49
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,960
In Amsterdam there lived a maid

50
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,838
And she was mistress of her trade

51
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,516
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

52
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,874
A-roving, a-roving

53
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,029
Sing!

54
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,917
Since roving's been my ruin

55
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,551
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

56
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,915
Her cheeks were red, her eyes were brown

57
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,956
Mark well what I do say

58
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,996
Her cheeks were red, her eyes were brown

59
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,150
Her curly hair was hanging down

60
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,153
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

61
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,316
A-roving, a-roving

62
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,311
Since roving's been my ruin

63
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,313
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

64
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,915
Landlord, which is the harpooneer
I'm to sleep with tonight?

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,592
He ain't among them.

66
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,638
He's what you might call
a dark-complexioned chap.

67
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,871
He'll be along
as soon as he finishes selling his head.

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,470
- His what?
- Selling his head.

69
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,554
Though he may have some difficulty
in getting rid of it.

70
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,596
New Bedford's overstocked.

71
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,550
- With what?
- Heads, of course!

72
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,075
Come on, lad.

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,718
Mark well what I do say

74
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,631
I kissed her once, I kissed her twice

75
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,312
And found she was as cold as ice

76
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,551
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

77
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,278
A-roving, a-roving

78
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,078
Since roving's been my ruin

79
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,277
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

80
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,557
Now, the young maid was fancy-free
Mark well what I do say

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,110
The young maid was fancy-free
If I could take her home with me

82
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,078
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

83
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,991
A-roving, a-roving

84
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,798
Since roving's been my ruin

85
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,872
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid

86
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,469
- Wait. Hold on.
- Who the devil are you?

87
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,915
Who no speak? I kill you!

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,115
Landlord!

89
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,033
Peter Coffin! Coffin, save me!

90
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,712
Now, now, now.

91
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,751
What is all this about?

92
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,879
Why didn't you tell me
I was sleeping with a cannibal?

93
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,359
I thought you knowed.

94
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,432
Didn't I tell you
he was around the town selling heads?

95
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,951
Landlord, tell him to stash that tomahawk,
or pipe, or whatever you call it.

96
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,750
Well, pleasant dreams.

97
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,073
Better a sober cannibal
than a drunken Christian.

98
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,149
In this same New Bedford,
there stands a Whaleman's Chapel...

99
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,678
and few are the fishermen shortly bound
for the Indian Ocean or Pacific...

100
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,717
who fail to visit there.

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,597
The will of God I did deny

102
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,671
And so my sacred duty fled

103
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,553
Oh, my Lord's awful penalty

104
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,590
Is not to die and yet be dead

105
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,237
The ribs and terrors in the whale

106
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,557
Arched over me a dismal gloom

107
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,792
While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by

108
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,797
And lift me deepening down to doom

109
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,517
I saw the opening maw of hell

110
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,591
With endless pains and sorrows there

111
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,712
Which none but they that feel can tell

112
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,757
Oh, I was plunging to despair

113
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,477
In black distress, I called my God

114
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,037
When I could scarce believe him mine

115
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,472
He bowed his ear to my complaints

116
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,514
No more the whale

117
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,628
Did me confine

118
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,790
Amen

119
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,478
"And God had prepared a great fish...

120
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,991
"to swallow up Jonah."

121
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,234
Shipmates...

122
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,792
the sin of Jonah...

123
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,474
was in his disobedience
of the command of God.

124
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,437
He found it a hard command.

125
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,399
And it was, shipmates...

126
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,392
for all the things that
God would have us do are hard.

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,436
If we would obey God,
we must disobey ourselves.

128
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,156
But Jonah still further flouts at God
by seeking to flee from him.

129
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,837
Jonah thinks that a ship made by men...

130
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,230
will carry him into countries
where God does not reign.

131
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,435
He prowls among the shipping...

132
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,115
Like a vile burglar,
hastening to cross the seas.

133
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,075
And as he comes aboard,
the sailors mark him.

134
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,472
The ship puts out...

135
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,274
but soon the sea rebels.
It will not bear the wicked burden.

136
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,513
A dreadful storm comes up.
The ship is like to break.

137
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,716
The boatswain calls
all hands to lighten her.

138
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,349
Boxes, bales, and jars
are clattering overboard.

139
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,193
The wind is shrieking. The men are yelling.

140
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,630
"I fear the Lord," cries Jonah...

141
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,599
"the God of heaven,
who hath made the sea and the dry land."

142
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,828
Again, the sailors mark him.

143
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,198
But wretched Jonah cries out to them
to cast him overboard...

144
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,553
for he knew that for his sake
this great tempest was upon them.

145
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,238
Now behold Jonah...

146
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,759
taken up as an anchor
and dropped into the sea...

147
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,357
into the dreadful jaws awaiting him.

148
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,309
And the great whale shoots
to all his ivory teeth...

149
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,278
Like so many white bolts upon his prison.

150
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,152
And Jonah cries unto the Lord...

151
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,471
out of the fish's belly.

152
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,230
Nut observe his prayer, shipmates.

153
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,718
He doesn't weep and wail.

154
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,918
He feels his punishment is just.
He leaves deliverance to God.

155
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,030
And even out of the belly of hell...

156
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,190
grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones...

157
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,036
God heard him when he cried.

158
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,031
And God spake unto the whale.

159
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,397
And from the shuddering cold
and blackness of the deep...

160
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,074
the whale breached into the sun...

161
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,758
and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

162
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,959
And Jonah...

163
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,718
bruised and beaten...

164
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,077
his ears like two seashells...

165
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,759
still multitudinously murmuring
of the ocean...

166
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,910
Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,831
And what was that, shipmates?

168
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,599
To preach the truth
in the face of falsehood!

169
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,915
No, shipmates. Woe to him who seeks
to pour oil on the troubled waters...

170
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,468
when God has brewed them into a gale.

171
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,154
Yea, woe to him who,
as the pilot Paul has it...

172
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,237
while preaching to others
is himself a castaway.

173
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,998
Delight is to him...

174
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,552
who, against the proud gods
and commodores of this earth...

175
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,279
stands forth his own inexorable self...

176
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,671
who destroys all sin
though he pluck it out...

177
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,469
from under the robes
of senators and judges!

178
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,314
And eternal delight shall be his...

179
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,829
who, coming to lay him down, can say:

180
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,753
"O Father...

181
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,711
"mortal or immortal...

182
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,148
"here I die.

183
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,991
"I have striven to be thine...

184
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,190
"more than to be this world's...

185
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,679
"or mine own.

186
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,353
"Yet this is nothing.

187
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,990
"I leave eternity to thee.

188
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,392
"For what is man...

189
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,837
"that he should live out
the lifetime of his God?"

190
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,508
And 50.

191
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,116
Three time I count 50.

192
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,278
Many pages, many.

193
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,834
A big book.

194
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,073
You know words?

195
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,080
I know picture. This whale.

196
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,233
You speak words.

197
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,636
"The heart of the whale is larger...

198
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,439
"than the pipe of the waterworks
at London Bridge.

199
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,956
"The water in that pipe
is not so thick or fast...

200
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,795
"as the blood pumping
from the heart of the whale."

201
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,030
True. Thank you.

202
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,074
Queequeg...

203
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,548
who are you? Where are you from?

204
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,795
My father king. I chief.

205
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,675
My uncle a high priest in islands...

206
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,671
west south far away.

207
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,912
Ship come by island.

208
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,432
I take canoe, I sail, I swim...

209
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,751
I climb rope, I hide.

210
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,233
Ship take me far. Many years.

211
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,597
See all world.

212
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,832
Odd. Many is the Christian wishes
he was a dark man on a cannibal isle.

213
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,239
- What next, Queequeg?
- Sail ship. You?

214
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,073
Tomorrow I hope to sign aboard any ship
in search of whales.

215
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,833
I sign, too. Your boat, my boat.

216
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,311
I eat same food. We sail on same waters.

217
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,471
We kill same whale.

218
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,359
We friends.

219
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,916
Same blood, same head, all same.

220
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,836
Well, which will it be, Queequeg?

221
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,430
The Tit-bit? Not a bad ship.

222
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,675
What do you say to the Devil-dam?

223
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,395
Pequod.

224
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,912
Well, now.

225
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,677
Look at the ivory she's wearing.

226
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,194
She's all tricked out
in the bones of her victims.

227
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,794
Those cleats made from whale's teeth.

228
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,356
And the tiller, Queequeg,
it's carved from a whale's jaw.

229
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,995
Ahoy there! Someone aboard?

230
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,676
Is this the captain of the Pequod?

231
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,355
What doest thee want of the captain?

232
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,193
We were thinking of shipping.

233
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,111
Thee art thinking of shipping.

234
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,555
I art.... I mean, I doest.

235
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,792
- Making sport of me, lad?
- No. I just fell into that manner of speech.

236
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,837
If I weren't a Quaker and a man of peace...

237
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,754
I'd fetch thee clout on the side of thy head,
my lad, just to make sure.

238
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,910
I see thee art no New Bedford man.

239
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,548
Doest know nothing at all about whaling,
I daresay.

240
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,710
I've had several voyages
in the merchant service.

241
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,756
Merchant service? Flukes, man.

242
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,635
- What takes thee whaling?
- Sir, I want to see what whaling is like.

243
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,155
Have you seen Ahab,
the captain of this ship?

244
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,832
If you want to know what whaling is...

245
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,673
then you'll know by clapping an eye
on Captain Ahab.

246
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,232
You'll see a man torn apart
from crown to heel...

247
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,955
and spliced together with
sperm whalebone in place of what's missing.

248
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,672
His looks tell more than any church-had
sermon about the mortality of man.

249
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,759
And a whale did that?

250
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,595
A whale as big as an island.

251
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,676
Art thee the man to pitch a harpoon
down a whale's throat and jump after it?

252
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,239
I am, sir...

253
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,756
if it should be positively indispensable
to do so.

254
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,472
Come along, then.

255
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,556
Bildad, stir yourself.
This young man says he wants to ship.

256
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,359
- Hast ever been a pirate, hast thee?
- Never.

257
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,468
- Didst not murder thy last captain at sea?
- Indeed not.

258
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,394
He'll do.

259
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,836
- What pay shall we give him?
- The 777th part.

260
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,117
- Would not be too much?
- For this strapping lad? Not half enough.

261
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,350
Captain Peleg, thee hast a generous heart.

262
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,035
But thee must consider the duty thee owest
to the other owners of this ship...

263
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,758
widows and orphans, many of them.

264
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,718
If we too abundantly reward
the labors of this young man...

265
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,438
we'll be taking bread from their mouths.

266
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,353
I'm putting him down
for the 300th part of the profit.

267
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,556
You hear, Bildad? The 300th part, I say.

268
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,790
"Lay not up for yourself
treasures upon earth...

269
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,757
"where moth and rust do corrupt."

270
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,719
- My last pay was--
- The 777th part seems fair enough to me.

271
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,475
- The 300th.
- Don't thank me, lad. I only do thee justice.

272
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,592
What holds thee? Sign.

273
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,552
- Sir, it's Captain Ahab.
- What about him?

274
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,914
Was not Ahab of old a very wicked king?

275
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,840
And when he was slain,
did the dogs not lick his blood?

276
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,229
Look, lad,
Captain Ahab did not name himself.

277
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,438
Sign the paper now, and wrong him not
because he happens to have a wicked name.

278
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,833
Now for that son of darkness
that is thy friend.

279
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,751
Queequeg, step forward.

280
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,512
What say you, Bildad?

281
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,149
I suspect thee art not a Christian.

282
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,795
Doest thee attend church on Sundays?

283
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,873
Doest thee know and obey
the Ten Commandments?

284
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,033
God, man.

285
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,272
Take the pen. Make thy mark.
Sign now for a 60th part of our profit.

286
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,999
Put there, quick.

287
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,072
Lantern kegs: 15.

288
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,631
Rubber pipes: 10.

289
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,193
Avast, there!

290
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,156
Are you going aboard, shipmate?

291
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,754
Have you signed to sail on that ship?

292
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,910
Have you signed to sail the Pequod, I say?

293
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,560
Was there anything down
about signing away your souls?

294
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,835
- What?
- Perhaps you haven't got any.

295
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,230
- Have you met old Ahab yet?
- What are you jabbering about?

296
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,949
Did they say how his mother birthed him,
gave him his evil name, and died?

297
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,349
How God's lightning struck down
and branded him?

298
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,318
How he spat in the holy goblet
in church of Valparaiso?

299
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,436
Did they tell you about his last voyage?

300
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,193
I know all about him being crippled
by a whale. Come on.

301
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,238
All about it? You're sure you do? Sure?

302
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,788
Did they say how the whale marked him
inside and out...

303
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,997
and a mischief was worked on his soul?
No, I don't think they did.

304
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,719
- Who'd know? Not many, I guess.
- You can't fool us.

305
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,598
It's very easy for a man to look like
he's got a great secret.

306
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,113
I have, lad.

307
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,274
At sea one day,
you'll smell land where there be no land.

308
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,878
On that day, Ahab will go to his grave,
but he'll rise again within the hour.

309
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,837
He will rise and beckon.

310
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,469
Then all, all save one, shall follow.

311
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,954
Morning, shipmates. Morning.

312
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,317
May the heavens bless you.

313
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,554
Hey, you.

314
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,630
- What's your name?
- Elijah.

315
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,792
My name is Elijah.

316
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,870
- Bible?
- No, thank you, Aunt Charity, I have mine.

317
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,949
Bible?

318
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,996
- Thank you, ma'am.
- God bless you.

319
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,631
Don't whale it too much on the Lord's day.
But don't lose a fair chance, either.

320
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,914
Spring, you sons of bachelors!
Jump, spring, there, green pants!

321
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,392
You, Scotchcap!

322
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,198
- Yes?
- Spring!

323
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,477
Good white cedar plank is 3% more this year
than the last.

324
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,077
Hoist the yards!

325
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,596
Our boots and clothes are all in pawn

326
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,356
Go down, you blood red roses, go down

327
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,030
And it's mighty drafty
round the Cape of Storms

328
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,398
Go down, you blood red roses, go down

329
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,914
Oh, you pinks and posies

330
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,278
Go down, you blood red roses, go down

331
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,789
Take care of the butter.
20 cents a pound, it is.

332
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,552
Bildad, stop palavering away.

333
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,915
Three years is a long while going.

334
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,951
God have you in his holy keeping.

335
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,315
For that is where them whalefish blow

336
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,233
Go down, you blood red roses

337
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,595
Avast! Heave it!

338
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,713
Heave it there!

339
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,353
Heave away, forward.

340
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,274
There's some that's bound
for New York town

341
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,193
And others is bound for France

342
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,955
Heave away, my Johnny

343
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,153
Heave away

344
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,949
And some that's bound for the Bengal Bay

345
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,190
To teach them whales to dance

346
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,272
And away, my Johnny boy

347
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,511
We're all bound to go

348
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,876
Come all you hard-weathered sailors

349
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,599
Who round the Cape of Storms

350
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,275
Heave away, my Johnny

351
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,552
Heave away

352
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,837
Be sure your boots and oilskins on

353
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,229
Or you'll wish you'd never been born

354
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,238
And away, my Johnny boy

355
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,630
We're all bound to go

356
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,555
Set the topsails!

357
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,510
Up helm.

358
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,279
And around the world!

359
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,792
The Pequod beat an easterly course
toward the whaling grounds off the Azores.

360
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,518
The crew came from all the isles of the sea,
all the ends of the earth:

361
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,431
from Greenland to Mombasa...

362
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,954
from Clyde to Kokovoko.

363
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,154
Flask, the third mate,
bullied everybody bigger than himself...

364
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,994
particularly whales,
with whom he carried on a one-sided feud...

365
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,993
as though the great leviathans
had mortally insulted him and his forebears.

366
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,279
And there was Pip, black little Pip,
the cabin boy from Alabama.

367
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,870
Second in command was Starbuck...

368
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,589
whose Quaker stock had furnished
many a whaleboat with its champion.

369
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,671
No crusader after perils...

370
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,276
his courage was one of the great staples
of the ship, like beef or flour:

371
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,710
there when required,
and not to be foolishly wasted.

372
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,634
Ship's carpenter:

373
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,315
he fixed everything
from stove boats to broken arms and legs.

374
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,751
Perth, the blacksmith, lived amidst
thick, hovering flights of sparks.

375
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,317
He breathed them in and out.
They nested in his ears.

376
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,512
But Perth cared not because, as he said...

377
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,275
he was scorched all over,
and you cannot scorch a scar.

378
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,356
Queequeg was our first harpooneer.

379
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,439
Next was Tashtego, the Indian
from a great warrior race of red men...

380
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,750
come to hunt whale instead of buffalo.

381
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,079
Then Daggoo, who got his boldness
and majesty and grace...

382
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,119
from having killed a lion single-handed
and partaken of its flesh.

383
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,358
Stubb, the second mate.

384
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,479
Stubb, who'd have tied a bowline
in the devil's tail for a joke.

385
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,908
Carefree, foolish, laughing, wise Stubb.

386
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,549
Of our supreme lord and dictator,
there was no sign.

387
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,510
Ahab stayed silent
behind his locked door...

388
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,397
all the daylight hours.

389
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,108
It's him again. It's Ahab.

390
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,194
Ahab come out in moonlight.

391
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,468
Strange.

392
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,273
Only at night.

393
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,999
Every night, all alone, walking the deck.

394
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,000
"Sand it, holystone it," they say.

395
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,870
And when you're done, what happens?

396
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,871
"Start over again," they say.

397
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,308
"Clean it up, sand it down, buff it off."

398
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,631
Keeps you busy, lad. No time for mischief.
Here we go.

399
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,750
Looming straight up and over us...

400
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,515
Like a solid iron figurehead
suddenly thrust into our vision...

401
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,398
stood Captain Ahab.

402
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,309
His whole, high, broad form...

403
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,712
weighed down upon a barbaric white leg
carved from the jawbone of a whale.

404
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,037
He did not feel the wind
or smell the salt air.

405
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,917
He only stood staring at the horizon...

406
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,756
with the marks of some inner crucifixion
and woe deep in his face.

407
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,671
- Mr. Starbuck.
- Sir?

408
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,672
Call everybody aft.

409
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,033
All hands aft!

410
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,192
Down, mastheads!

411
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,358
What do you do
when you see a whale, men?

412
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,119
- Sing out for him!
- Aye!

413
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,955
- Good. What do you do next?
- Lower away, and after him!

414
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,628
And what tune is it you pull to, men?

415
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,995
A dead whale or a stove boat!

416
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,951
All you mastheaders...

417
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,838
now hear me.

418
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,993
You're to look...

419
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,240
for a white whale.

420
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,829
A whale as white and as big
as a mountain of snow.

421
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,480
You see this Spanish gold ounce?

422
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,156
Carpenter, hand me your top maul.

423
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,190
Whosoever of ye...

424
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,392
finds me that white whale...

425
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,629
ye shall have this Spanish gold ounce,
my boys.

426
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,840
It's a white whale, I say.

427
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,878
Skin your eyes for him.

428
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,715
Captain, sir, could it be the one that fantails
a little curious before he go down?

429
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,759
Has he a curious spout,
all bushy and mighty quick and high, sir?

430
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,197
And irons in his hide, many irons,
all twist around?

431
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,157
Aye, like corkscrews.

432
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,078
He's struck full of harpoons, men.

433
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,675
And his spout is a big one,
like a whole shock of wheat.

434
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,116
And he fantails like a broken jib in a storm.

435
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,116
Death, men, you've seen him.

436
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,758
It's Moby Dick.

437
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,433
Captain Ahab...

438
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,996
was it not Moby Dick took off thy leg?

439
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,474
Aye.

440
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,152
It was Moby Dick...

441
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,275
that tore my soul and body
until they bled into each other.

442
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,399
I'll follow him around the Horn...

443
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,557
and around the Norway Maelstrom...

444
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,752
and around perdition's flames...

445
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,831
before I give him up.

446
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,120
This is what you've shipped for, men.

447
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,112
To chase that white whale
on both sides of land...

448
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,109
and over all sides of earth...

449
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,799
until he spouts black blood
and rolls dead out.

450
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,633
What say ye?

451
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,309
I think you do look brave.

452
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,916
- Will you splice hands on it?
- Aye!

453
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,958
Steward,
go draw the great measure of grog.

454
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,272
Harpooneers, get your weapons.
Mates, your lances.

455
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,512
Ye mariners, now ring me in...

456
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,431
that I may revive a noble custom
of my fisherman fathers.

457
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,153
The measure. Drink and pass.

458
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,718
Round with it, round.

459
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,268
Quick draughts, long swallows, men.

460
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,430
It's hot as Satan's hoof.

461
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,832
That way it went, this way it comes.

462
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,878
It spiralizes in ye.

463
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,832
Here, hand it me.

464
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,676
Well done. Almost drained.

465
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,153
Advance, mates.

466
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,191
Cross your lances.

467
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,391
Now, let me touch the axis.

468
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,988
Do you feel it?

469
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,518
That same lightning which struck me...

470
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,839
I now strike to this iron.

471
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,149
Does it burn, men?

472
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,796
Harpooneers, break your weapons.

473
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,992
Turn up the sockets.

474
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,596
Drink here, harpooneers...

475
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,429
drink and swear.

476
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,191
God hunt us all...

477
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,392
if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death.

478
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,076
Death to Moby Dick!

479
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,668
Moby Dick.

480
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,196
Do they name certain whales, then?

481
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,796
Aye. Special, people-murdering whales
with long histories.

482
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,192
Whales that have killed 10 times 100 men.

483
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,792
Whales like Timor Tim,
New Zealand Tom...

484
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,354
or Morquan, King of the Japan Seas.

485
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,758
Whales have big names
to go with big doings.

486
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,829
The biggest of them all is Moby Dick.

487
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,151
A white whale, Ahab said.

488
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,913
Can a whale be white?

489
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,232
He's white,
whiter than all the snow that ever fell.

490
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,717
Like a great marble tombstone,
he is, afloat.

491
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,636
Wherever he swims,
white sky birds wheel above him.

492
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,070
- Birds white as the angels.
- Which oceans does he swim in, Manxman?

493
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,994
All oceans. He's been spied
in different seas 1,000 mile apart...

494
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,356
- on the same day at the same hour.
- Maybe it just ain't one whale...

495
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,477
but a whole breed.
Maybe Moby Dick's 100 whales.

496
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,792
Then they all have crooked jaws
and wrinkled brows...

497
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,838
and a dozen irons stuck
in their white humps.

498
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,110
Aye, many have lowered for Moby Dick
and struck him...

499
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,356
only to know his vengeance.

500
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,836
Some have boasted they killed him...

501
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,798
but always he comes gliding back...

502
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,835
huge and white and secret-like.

503
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,032
Immortal, he is, they say.

504
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,475
You ain't trying to scare us, Manxman?

505
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,397
I say what I say.

506
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,278
There she blows!

507
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,549
Sperm whale to starboard!
There she blows!

508
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,873
There go flukes!

509
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,468
- Flukes gone down!
- Larboard!

510
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,633
Stow all line tubs!

511
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,272
Fill up the mainsail!

512
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,278
Bear away, boats!

513
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,313
- Bet you a dollar we strike first!
- Right, Stubb. A dollar you don't.

514
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,312
That's it, boys.

515
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,353
Pull, my men.

516
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,510
Why in the name of gudgeons
and ginger cakes...

517
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,068
can't ye pull and start your eyes out?

518
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,313
Why don't you break your backbones, boys?
Pull, then.

519
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,392
Do pull, will you, please? So, so now.

520
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,314
Pull, boys! Pull!

521
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,838
Pull, blast you!

522
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,717
Take the oars off!

523
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,237
Pull, my good boys.

524
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,193
That's fine.

525
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,949
Pull.

526
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,636
Pull, my good boys.

527
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,711
Long and strong, boys.

528
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,836
Pull and burst all your livers and lungs!

529
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,670
Stop snoring, you sleepers!

530
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,398
Pull, can't ye? Pull!

531
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,159
Merrily, hearts!

532
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,189
Fine.

533
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,834
That's fine.

534
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,115
Come on, men. Pull ahead.

535
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,039
Pull, can't ye?

536
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,196
Man overboard!

537
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,359
Cut him loose.

538
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,554
Queequeg, my fine friend,
does this sort of thing happen very often?

539
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,959
True, true.

540
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,117
Heave away, boys!

541
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,429
And so we stripped our first whale...

542
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,037
and boiled the blubber down
to a fine, pure oil...

543
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,918
that would keep the lamps burning
in a thousand homes...

544
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,434
the clocks ticking on their mantelpieces...

545
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,831
and perhaps anoint the head of a king.

546
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,554
And when at last we cast
the whale's bared bones into the sea...

547
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,834
we were in no way sad at its funeral.

548
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,069
Captain.

549
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,269
- Starbuck?
- Aye, Captain.

550
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,155
It's late. You should turn in.

551
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,234
Sleep?

552
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,317
That bed is a coffin...

553
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,910
and those are winding sheets.

554
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,794
I do not sleep. I die.

555
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,631
The prize furnished 85 barrels of oil, sir.
They're all capped and stored.

556
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,075
- How is the wind?
- North, northeast and steady.

557
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,948
Make the most of it. I do not wish
to linger on this Cape Verde ground.

558
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,232
We're bound for the Pacific,
Mr. Starbuck, straightaway.

559
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,392
You will plot a course
south by east to the line...

560
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,074
and so southeast
to pick up the Guinea current.

561
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,873
Aye, aye, sir.

562
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,113
Mr. Starbuck...

563
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,233
did you ever ponder the movements
of whales around the four oceans?

564
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,038
I only know that they appear at
certain feeding grounds in certain seasons.

565
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,233
Look here.

566
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,156
Logbooks from the time
New Bedford men first went a-whaling...

567
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,231
helped me draw this chart.

568
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,391
It divides the oceans into areas of
five degrees of latitude by five of longitude.

569
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,597
Here are the months of the years,
the ships that passed...

570
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,269
how long they lingered,
the whales they saw:

571
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,553
what size, what color,
how many, where heading.

572
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,156
- I never saw the like.
- This way, the humpbacks go...

573
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,879
the blue, the right...

574
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,238
the spermaceti.

575
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,390
Sea mile by sea mile.

576
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,995
I know their hidden journeys
as I know the veins in my arm.

577
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,239
You mean to say that
their journeys can be foretold?

578
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,598
Aye, like the blood pumping in my veins
from heart to hand.

579
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,079
If this be so, we can follow along
with the herds, killing as we go...

580
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,037
and fill our hold in record time.

581
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,680
So we shall, Mr. Starbuck. So we shall...

582
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,232
once we've attended to
our bigger business.

583
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,791
What is that business, Captain?

584
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,960
Him, Mr. Starbuck. Him.

585
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,233
What's true of the herds holds largely
for the great solitaries and hermits.

586
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,595
If these sources tell the truth,
and my calculations are not faulty...

587
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,313
he now swims the waters off Good Hope...

588
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,960
and all the Indian Ocean lies before him.

589
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,430
Next month, he cruises the Bengal Bay,
March, the Sulu Sea...

590
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,710
running eastward
to the gateway of the Pacific.

591
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,470
I shall be waiting for him...

592
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,594
here...

593
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,549
at new moon in April.

594
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:33,759
Mr. Starbuck.

595
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:37,207
- I must give the helmsman our course.
- Come about, sir.

596
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:46,003
Why are you wearing that long face?
Are you not game for Moby Dick?

597
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:50,090
Captain Ahab,
I am game for any kind of death...

598
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:53,447
if it comes in the way
of the business we follow. That be known.

599
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:57,048
But I came here to hunt whales,
not my commander's vengeance.

600
00:48:57,651 --> 00:49:00,324
How many barrels of sperm oil
will thy vengeance yield?

601
00:49:00,411 --> 00:49:02,561
What will it fetch
on the New Bedford market?

602
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,687
Money is not the measurer, man.

603
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:08,005
It will fetch me a great premium...

604
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:09,846
here.

605
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:14,803
To be enraged with a dumb brute
that acted out of blind instinct...

606
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:16,844
is blasphemous.

607
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:20,803
Speak not to me of blasphemy, man.

608
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:24,167
I'd strike the sun if it insulted me.

609
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,649
Look ye, Starbuck...

610
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:34,690
all visible objects
are but as pasteboard masks.

611
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:37,880
Some inscrutable yet reasoning thing...

612
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:40,724
puts forth the molding of their features.

613
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,361
The white whale tasks me.

614
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:46,962
He heaps me.

615
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:50,127
Yet he is but a mask.

616
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:54,730
It is the thing behind the mask
I chiefly hate.

617
00:49:55,131 --> 00:49:59,124
The malignant thing
that has plagued and frightened man...

618
00:49:59,211 --> 00:50:01,441
since time began.

619
00:50:01,851 --> 00:50:05,730
The thing that mauls
and mutilates our race...

620
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:09,925
not killing us outright,
but letting us live on...

621
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:13,640
with half a heart and half a lung.

622
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:16,288
God keep us, keep us all.

623
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:23,529
The crew stands with me, Mr. Starbuck.

624
00:50:24,451 --> 00:50:26,362
You heard them swear.

625
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:30,486
Now...

626
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,127
what say ye?

627
00:50:36,211 --> 00:50:39,203
Surely the best lance
out of all New Bedford...

628
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:43,523
will not hold back
from the greatest hunt of all?

629
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:47,603
I say calmly back to thee, sir,
I am against thee.

630
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:50,801
Nut thee needn't fear Starbuck.

631
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:54,040
Let Ahab beware Ahab.

632
00:50:55,091 --> 00:50:57,559
Beware thyself, my captain.

633
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,327
We left the winter seas behind...

634
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:16,005
and sailed under the hot sun south.

635
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:19,289
South, past the unseen sprawl of Africa...

636
00:51:20,131 --> 00:51:24,761
until we rounded the Cape of Storms and
steered a bold course east and northeast...

637
00:51:24,851 --> 00:51:26,967
for the Indian Ocean and beyond.

638
00:51:31,451 --> 00:51:34,124
- You there, lad, go aloft.
- Aye, aye, sir.

639
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:30,321
And so I served my first watch
in the masthead...

640
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,331
held in a great, gliding rhythm.

641
00:52:33,571 --> 00:52:36,244
No life in me except that life imparted...

642
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:38,606
by a gently rolling ship...

643
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:43,039
remote from all the cares
of the people of the land.

644
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:56,249
There she blows!

645
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:01,609
Where away? How many?

646
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:03,443
Starboard bow, Mr. Stubb!

647
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:08,043
- Two! No, four of them!
- What's that boy yelling?

648
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:10,361
Six, seven of them!

649
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:13,200
There's three dozen more of them!

650
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:16,568
Look, Mr. Stubb! 100!

651
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,404
Come down from there!
The sun has baked your brains!

652
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:21,527
In the name of God, Mr. Stubb!

653
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:24,728
A hundred, two hundred whales!

654
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:38,367
Blast me dead, Mr. Flask.

655
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:40,921
All hands, prepare to lower!

656
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:41,806
Another 40 barrels, sir.

657
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:23,683
Ahoy, there!
Captain Boomer knocking at your door.

658
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:26,205
- May he come in, sir?
- Come aboard.

659
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:34,325
Captain Boomer's my name, sir.

660
00:56:34,411 --> 00:56:36,971
Ship's Samuel Enderby of London.
Eighteen months at sea.

661
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:39,804
- Ahab.
- Captain Ahab, will you look out there?

662
00:56:39,891 --> 00:56:42,451
What a circus.
Did ever you see such a run?

663
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:44,089
Do it, boys! Do it!

664
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:47,163
Kill three for Captain Ahab
and three for me!

665
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,121
Never fear. I'll not scuttle your ship.

666
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:53,009
She's a beauty, eh, Captain?
Better than flesh and blood.

667
00:56:53,091 --> 00:56:55,605
Like her so much
I've a mind to have me other arm cut off.

668
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:57,886
The very thing for driving marlinspikes...

669
00:56:57,971 --> 00:57:00,121
knocking sense
into green seamen's heads...

670
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:03,169
and particularly good
for tapping kegs of rum...

671
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:05,881
if you get my meaning, Captain.

672
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:08,966
Pip, fetch rum.

673
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:15,725
I see you're wearing
a bit of ivory yourself, sir.

674
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:18,405
Lubbers with four limbs
don't know what they're missing.

675
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:21,801
When I got this ivory jib,
all spanking new and scientific...

676
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:24,280
why, I could've thanked that whale.

677
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:29,286
Aye, a whale took me arm for his breakfast.
Devilish big, he was.

678
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:31,202
Pushed a tidal wave ahead with his nose...

679
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:34,647
and typhoons jumped off his flukes
when they banged the water.

680
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:38,121
Old, he was,
and scarred like Jerusalem's hills.

681
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:41,521
Captain Boomer, what was his color?

682
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:45,200
He was white, sir. Think me crazy,
it's a fact. He was snowy white.

683
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:47,088
Had another chance at him a month ago.

684
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:49,241
You didn't kill him?

685
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:53,404
Bless you, no. Went his merry way.
"Good riddance," said I, and meant it.

686
00:57:53,491 --> 00:57:55,925
Where did you last see the white whale?

687
00:57:56,131 --> 00:57:57,803
Off the Cape of Good Hope.

688
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,689
He was heading northeast
towards Madagascar.

689
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,325
Do you hear?

690
00:58:10,331 --> 00:58:13,607
A white whale last month off Good Hope.

691
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:16,603
My chart is right and true!

692
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:19,968
He'll be off Bikini
when the April moon is new.

693
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:24,764
Stop the hunt!
Pick up our boats. We're setting sail.

694
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:27,081
But, Captain, those fine, big whales.

695
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,082
You men up there, get aloft!

696
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:32,720
I'll not sail with you, sir!
Bring my boat alongside.

697
00:58:32,811 --> 00:58:35,325
Mr. Starbuck, cut loose that carcass.

698
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,879
Pip, signal the men to return to ship.

699
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:40,849
What ails ye, sir? Are ye stove-in drunk?

700
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:44,287
Captain Ahab, think what you're doing.
I beg thee, think.

701
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:47,165
- Set the mainsail!
- No, sir, no!

702
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,761
Mr. Starbuck, are you opposing me?

703
00:58:49,851 --> 00:58:53,526
If so, I'll have you know
there is one God that is lord over the earth...

704
00:58:53,611 --> 00:58:55,966
and one captain over the Pequod.

705
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:58,960
Away now! Cut loose!

706
00:59:01,891 --> 00:59:04,246
Flask, what do you make of that?

707
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,085
Return to ship.

708
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,162
They're crazy, or I'm going blind.

709
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:10,446
You're not blind. Something's up.

710
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:13,603
Ye idiot, that's my whale
you're cutting loose!

711
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:20,006
Come aboard. We're setting sail.

712
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:26,524
Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, Did you not see
the pennant or hear my command?

713
00:59:26,611 --> 00:59:28,169
Yes, sir, we did.

714
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:29,650
Then why don't you obey?

715
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:33,326
We will, sir, as soon as it sinks in.
Sort of bowled us over, Captain.

716
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:36,369
Weather's good, ship ain't sinking!
No one's lost overboard!

717
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:39,488
Got a fine harvest here.
Don't see no reason to leave.

718
00:59:39,571 --> 00:59:42,210
I do not give reasons, Mr. Stubb.
I give orders.

719
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:45,408
Now, Captain, we're good men.
Our blood's up, that's all.

720
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:46,606
We've been killing!

721
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:49,683
A hard thing to stop killing
when you've been killing steady, sir.

722
00:59:49,771 --> 00:59:52,331
We've been killing so fast,
our blood's so high...

723
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:54,845
we wouldn't have heard the last trump.

724
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:57,082
Then hear me now:

725
00:59:57,331 --> 00:59:58,650
Come aboard.

726
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,809
All right, my hearties. Wake up!
Bestir yourselves.

727
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:21,130
This is an evil voyage, I tell you.

728
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,367
If Ahab has his way...

729
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:27,842
thee, nor me, nor any member
of this ship's company...

730
01:00:27,931 --> 01:00:29,683
will ever see home again.

731
01:00:29,771 --> 01:00:33,081
Come now, Mr. Starbuck.
You're just plain gloomy.

732
01:00:33,531 --> 01:00:36,762
Moby Dick may be big,
but he ain't that big.

733
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:38,807
I do not fear Moby Dick.

734
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:41,768
I fear the wrath of God.

735
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:43,404
The wrath of God?

736
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:47,124
It is our task in life to kill whales...

737
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:50,563
and furnish up their oil
for the lamps of the world.

738
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:54,124
If we perform that task well
and faithfully...

739
01:00:54,211 --> 01:00:57,487
we do a service to mankind
that pleases Almighty God.

740
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,640
Aye.

741
01:00:59,851 --> 01:01:01,842
Ahab would deny all that.

742
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:05,764
He has taken us from the rich harvest
we were reaping...

743
01:01:05,851 --> 01:01:08,206
to satisfy his lust for vengeance.

744
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:10,759
He is twisting that which is holy...

745
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:13,684
into something dark and purposeless.

746
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:16,367
He is a champion of darkness.

747
01:01:17,971 --> 01:01:21,441
Ahab's red flag challenges the heavens.

748
01:01:22,771 --> 01:01:26,559
Now, sir, if it's like that,
I don't wonder at you, a religious man...

749
01:01:26,651 --> 01:01:28,289
being a mite downcast.

750
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:31,920
On the other hand,
don't much see what you can do about it.

751
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:34,205
Listen to this.

752
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:46,641
"A captain who, from private motives...

753
01:01:46,731 --> 01:01:50,770
"employs his vessel to another purpose
than that intended by the owners...

754
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,044
"is answerable to the charge
of usurpation...

755
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:56,999
"and his crew is morally
and legally entitled...

756
01:01:57,091 --> 01:02:00,640
"to employ forceful means
in wresting his command from him."

757
01:02:04,451 --> 01:02:07,170
That's a mouthful. I swear.

758
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,768
"Wrest his command from him"?

759
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,843
- Does that mean take over?
- It does, Mr. Flask.

760
01:02:14,491 --> 01:02:17,210
You ain't proposing we do any such thing?

761
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:25,562
You're in dangerous waters, Mr. Starbuck.
Helm hard over. Come about.

762
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:27,489
Do thee not see...

763
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:30,848
that by serving Ahab
we share in his blasphemy?

764
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:33,362
Will thee risk that...

765
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:36,119
or stand with me and invoke the law?

766
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:39,206
Pardon me, sir, this is my watch.

767
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:46,370
Captains can't break the law.
They is the law, as far as I'm concerned.

768
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:50,450
Aye, and Ahab's a real fine captain, too.

769
01:02:50,531 --> 01:02:52,999
Why, there ain't a man aboard,
except you maybe...

770
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:57,369
wouldn't rather be kicked by him
than be knighted by the Queen of England.

771
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:59,130
I'm done, then.

772
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:01,327
Go write thy last will and testament.

773
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,971
Aye, and do it laughing, sir.

774
01:03:09,851 --> 01:03:13,321
A laugh's the best answer
to all that's strange in life.

775
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:31,402
As we steered out toward Bikini...

776
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:34,847
Ahab kept to his cabin
and was rarely seen.

777
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:38,010
The mastheads were empty
against the sky.

778
01:03:39,051 --> 01:03:42,043
No cry of "There she blows!"
was to entice us...

779
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:44,048
from his single purpose.

780
01:03:44,891 --> 01:03:46,961
So, in April, with a new moon...

781
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:48,564
we entered those waters...

782
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:51,802
where Ahab hoped to find the white whale.

783
01:04:01,331 --> 01:04:04,562
Lookouts, bestir yourselves!

784
01:04:05,411 --> 01:04:07,163
Lookouts up!

785
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:11,724
Look alive, lads!

786
01:04:11,811 --> 01:04:13,961
That gold belongs
to him with the sharpest eye.

787
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:18,124
That coin's worth $16.
I'll be first to sight the white whale.

788
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:22,682
Rum for me if I win the coin,
enough to dive into and never reach bottom.

789
01:04:27,491 --> 01:04:28,844
Man overboard!

790
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:31,964
Off the main yard.

791
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:35,409
Sea boat's crew away.

792
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,163
Not a sign of him.

793
01:05:16,251 --> 01:05:19,004
Yeah. Sea just swallowed him up.

794
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:22,040
Queer.

795
01:06:20,451 --> 01:06:22,726
April 19, 1842.

796
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:27,765
Ahab's chart shows Moby Dick
and the new moon rising together.

797
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:29,967
Nut the moon's lost his horns...

798
01:06:30,211 --> 01:06:33,089
and there ain't no sign
of the white whale yet.

799
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:43,160
Seven days and seven nights on watch.

800
01:06:43,851 --> 01:06:47,241
He ain't gone below, eats on deck,
sleeps standing up.

801
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:50,206
How much longer can he hold?

802
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:24,450
Nothing moves.

803
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:26,799
Nothing.

804
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:30,680
Since the lookout fell into the sea...

805
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:33,569
the wind don't move, the tide don't move.

806
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:35,965
Nothing.

807
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:39,811
Even the sun's nailed to the sky...

808
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:42,928
Like that gold doubloon's
nailed to the mast.

809
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:53,041
You, lad, pull that gold coin off the mast.

810
01:07:53,131 --> 01:07:56,806
Throw it over the side.
Pay the sea a ransom.

811
01:07:56,931 --> 01:07:59,399
Maybe it'll come back to life
and bring us a wind.

812
01:07:59,491 --> 01:08:01,083
Manxman, stop.

813
01:08:02,331 --> 01:08:03,764
A cool wind.

814
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:08,007
You, Manxman, stop!

815
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:25,567
Queequeg, what are you doing?

816
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:29,888
See tomorrow here. Bones tell everything.

817
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:43,322
Queequeg, what's the matter?

818
01:08:44,651 --> 01:08:46,130
What do you see?

819
01:08:46,211 --> 01:08:47,724
Get carpenter.

820
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,521
What do you want the carpenter for?

821
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:55,324
Carpenter.

822
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:58,519
Here.

823
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:08,287
- What can I do for you?
- How much you build coffin for?

824
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:10,085
Coffin?

825
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:13,603
$2 would do nicely.

826
01:09:14,171 --> 01:09:17,607
- Hold on.
- Build coffin. 6 feet, 7 inch.

827
01:09:18,251 --> 01:09:19,650
Clean wood.

828
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:23,207
Make like best boat. Caulk and tar seams.

829
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:25,009
No water come in.

830
01:09:25,091 --> 01:09:27,651
Carve chief's feather on lid.

831
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:32,527
- 6 feet 7 inches, it'll be.
- Queequeg, what's all this about?

832
01:09:32,611 --> 01:09:35,603
Money yours. Sea chest yours.

833
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:37,841
My harpoon yours.

834
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:41,199
Goodbye.

835
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,360
What?

836
01:09:49,171 --> 01:09:51,605
Queequeg, what are you talking about?

837
01:09:55,411 --> 01:09:57,208
Queequeg, listen to me!

838
01:09:57,811 --> 01:09:59,324
Say something.

839
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:04,446
- What are we going to do?
- There's only one thing to do:

840
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:07,409
build him his coffin.

841
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:46,729
You've got to eat.

842
01:10:49,131 --> 01:10:50,803
A drink of water, then.

843
01:10:54,491 --> 01:10:57,881
Queequeg, if you go on like this,
I shall be very angry.

844
01:11:00,531 --> 01:11:02,999
Queequeg, I absolutely forbid you to die.

845
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:14,285
Such behavior simply isn't Christian.

846
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,802
In fact, it's downright pagan
and heathenish.

847
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:25,243
Remember our oath?

848
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:28,449
You promised to go where I go,
eat what I eat...

849
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:30,123
ship on my ship.

850
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:33,365
I hold you to your promise, Queequeg.

851
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:36,088
I've seen this before, lad.

852
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:42,365
One day, for no reason,
they know that death is near.

853
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:46,521
They give away all their belongings
and say goodbye.

854
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:49,362
Then they sit down to wait...

855
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:52,123
and they just die.

856
01:11:52,931 --> 01:11:55,240
Mr. Starbuck, sir, Captain wants you.

857
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:19,966
Sir?

858
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:25,366
Mr. Starbuck, new orders.

859
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:31,644
We remain here until eight bells tonight...

860
01:12:33,691 --> 01:12:36,330
at which time we'll lower whaleboats...

861
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,961
kedge the ship north...

862
01:12:41,571 --> 01:12:43,880
and row out of these waters.

863
01:12:44,811 --> 01:12:46,642
Aye, aye, sir. At eight bells.

864
01:12:51,491 --> 01:12:54,722
I'm beating a march to you, Queequeg.
Get along.

865
01:13:13,651 --> 01:13:15,448
Get along quiet now, Queequeg.

866
01:13:15,531 --> 01:13:18,204
You follow the tide. It knows where to go.

867
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:28,681
You get along with it.
It'll take you, Queequeg. Get along.

868
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:33,964
Rig-a-dig.

869
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:36,480
Rig-a-dig.

870
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:41,489
He won't listen.

871
01:13:44,651 --> 01:13:47,449
Queequeg's going away.
Know where he's going?

872
01:13:51,251 --> 01:13:53,207
Way, way up to Kokovoko.

873
01:13:59,171 --> 01:14:01,844
Back to Kokovoko, where he came from.

874
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,770
Queequeg, don't.

875
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:33,004
- There she blows!
- Queequeg, listen to me. Don't.

876
01:15:42,211 --> 01:15:44,361
Off the starboard beam!

877
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:53,765
It's him.

878
01:15:54,731 --> 01:15:56,164
I know it's him.

879
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:01,610
Is it real?

880
01:16:02,931 --> 01:16:04,364
Do you see it, too?

881
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:06,169
Aye, we all see it.

882
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:09,405
But that don't mean it's real, necessarily.

883
01:16:09,891 --> 01:16:11,802
Clear away the boats.

884
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:14,126
Lower for him now, sir? At night?

885
01:16:14,211 --> 01:16:15,530
Lower away.

886
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:18,090
Away boat's crews.

887
01:17:02,371 --> 01:17:03,599
He's sounded.

888
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:07,719
Ship oars.

889
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:05,766
He's near.

890
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:08,684
He's very near.

891
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:12,409
Be ready for him.

892
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:27,646
He breaches!

893
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:40,604
The birds, they go.

894
01:18:40,771 --> 01:18:42,682
God, I'll lose him.

895
01:18:42,811 --> 01:18:45,245
Without a wind, we'll lose him!

896
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:55,809
That ain't no whale.
That a great white god.

897
01:18:58,331 --> 01:19:00,606
About! Back to the ship!

898
01:19:00,971 --> 01:19:03,769
We'll tie on and row for a wind.

899
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:11,801
Long days and nights
we strained at the oars...

900
01:19:12,611 --> 01:19:15,250
while the white whale swam freely on...

901
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:19,883
widening the waters between himself
and Ahab's vengeance.

902
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:31,807
A cloud on the starboard beam.

903
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:36,522
Steer for the cloud, men. Bring her around.

904
01:19:37,411 --> 01:19:39,879
For the cloud! Starboard!

905
01:19:48,331 --> 01:19:50,083
Pull quick!

906
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:53,004
Pull us into it, boys. Quick.

907
01:19:57,771 --> 01:19:58,999
Pull!

908
01:20:00,371 --> 01:20:01,565
That's it!

909
01:20:31,971 --> 01:20:34,280
You raised the white whale first.

910
01:20:35,051 --> 01:20:36,928
The gold doubloon is yours.

911
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:39,442
Go on. Take it, sailor.

912
01:20:45,611 --> 01:20:47,727
Wait now. Listen.

913
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:51,364
This man has his Spanish gold ounce.

914
01:20:53,331 --> 01:20:55,128
You shall have yours.

915
01:20:56,171 --> 01:20:58,810
When Moby Dick is struck and killed...

916
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:02,281
on that day, you shall have my share.

917
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:05,319
My 10% of the profits...

918
01:21:05,651 --> 01:21:07,801
of this entire voyage.

919
01:21:08,651 --> 01:21:09,720
Aye!

920
01:21:10,091 --> 01:21:13,720
Gold will pour out of Moby Dick's wounds
into your hands.

921
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,851
Every drop of his blood...

922
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:19,441
another Spanish doubloon!

923
01:21:19,931 --> 01:21:21,967
What say you to that, men?

924
01:21:23,571 --> 01:21:24,799
Sing out!

925
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:28,846
They're all dumfounded, sir, and so am I.

926
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,762
Hooray for Captain Ahab!

927
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,009
Pip, grog all around.

928
01:21:38,091 --> 01:21:40,207
A sail, sir, to starboard.

929
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:46,763
The Rachel, out of New Bedford.

930
01:21:46,851 --> 01:21:49,240
Captain Gardiner's ship.
She's coming around.

931
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:58,280
Captain Ahab,
have you seen a whaleboat adrift?

932
01:21:58,371 --> 01:21:59,963
I've seen nothing.

933
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:02,607
You've seen the white whale?

934
01:22:02,691 --> 01:22:06,206
We harpooned him
not 10 miles from this spot.

935
01:22:06,411 --> 01:22:07,810
Not dead.

936
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:11,124
- You didn't kill him?
- No.

937
01:22:11,211 --> 01:22:14,920
We lost a boat, towed out of sight by him.
To ruin.

938
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:18,162
Three days and nights we've searched.
My boy was in it.

939
01:22:18,251 --> 01:22:20,970
My own son. Twelve years old.

940
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:25,610
Captain Ahab, will you help me search?

941
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:27,966
As we are Christians,
we cannot refuse this man.

942
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:30,519
You will. I know you will help!

943
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:32,445
You must!

944
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:35,364
You must,
and you shall do this thing for me!

945
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:42,440
If thee say no, we'll be in black disgrace.

946
01:22:42,531 --> 01:22:45,329
At home, they'll spit
at the mention of the Pequod's name.

947
01:22:45,411 --> 01:22:47,800
Captain Ahab, answer me!

948
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:49,963
Captain Gardiner...

949
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:53,039
I seek the white whale!

950
01:22:53,411 --> 01:22:55,641
Your own son's murderer!

951
01:22:57,531 --> 01:22:59,647
I am losing time.

952
01:22:59,931 --> 01:23:02,843
Time? I've lost my whole world!

953
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:06,840
I will not go.
I will follow till you say aye to me.

954
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,761
Run, men. Stand by to lower.

955
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:12,368
I am coming over, Captain.

956
01:23:12,451 --> 01:23:16,000
Avast! Touch not a rope! I must go.

957
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:19,688
Goodbye, I say, and fare thee well.

958
01:23:19,971 --> 01:23:22,849
God help you, Captain Gardiner!

959
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:27,126
God forgive you, Captain Ahab.

960
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:41,247
Stoke up the tryworks.

961
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,325
We shall run forward laden with fire...

962
01:23:46,011 --> 01:23:50,050
to render the white whale's flesh
into unholy oil.

963
01:23:50,251 --> 01:23:51,650
Blacksmith...

964
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:55,640
I set ye a task.

965
01:24:01,771 --> 01:24:05,320
Take these harpoons and lances.
Melt them down.

966
01:24:05,571 --> 01:24:07,050
Forge me new weapons...

967
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:10,487
that will strike deep and hold fast.

968
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:13,001
Nut do not douse them in water.

969
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:16,131
They must have a proper baptism.

970
01:24:17,091 --> 01:24:19,286
What say ye, all ye men?

971
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:24,087
Will you give as much blood
as shall be needed to temper the steel?

972
01:24:24,171 --> 01:24:25,570
Aye!

973
01:24:25,651 --> 01:24:28,165
To my anger, now add your own.

974
01:24:29,811 --> 01:24:32,564
You be the cogs that fit my wheel...

975
01:24:33,731 --> 01:24:36,882
the gunpowder that takes my torch.

976
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,170
Pledge yourselves heart...

977
01:24:43,051 --> 01:24:44,450
soul...

978
01:24:45,971 --> 01:24:47,245
body...

979
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:51,280
- life and lung--
- Aye, sir.

980
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:54,844
...as I pledge myself.

981
01:24:57,451 --> 01:25:00,443
Death to Moby Dick.

982
01:25:01,491 --> 01:25:03,482
Death.

983
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:39,885
Up helm!

984
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:42,847
Bring the wind aft!

985
01:25:57,971 --> 01:25:59,165
Hold it!

986
01:26:02,731 --> 01:26:05,245
Sir, shall I shorten sail?

987
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:07,720
No. She runs well enough.

988
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:15,962
Weather main brace!

989
01:26:16,531 --> 01:26:18,601
Weather yards!

990
01:26:27,211 --> 01:26:30,760
The braces, men! Haul away!

991
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:53,442
Haul away! Lay on your backs and haul!

992
01:26:53,731 --> 01:26:55,608
Earn your salt!

993
01:26:57,851 --> 01:26:59,887
By all that's holy, Captain!

994
01:26:59,971 --> 01:27:03,850
We'll lose every inch of canvas
if we don't ease the ship!

995
01:27:03,931 --> 01:27:05,250
Mr. Starbuck...

996
01:27:05,651 --> 01:27:08,290
we're three days behind Moby Dick!

997
01:27:08,611 --> 01:27:10,886
This wind is heaven-sent.

998
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:13,606
Heaven-sent to destroy us.

999
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:20,362
Cut away those rags!

1000
01:27:21,011 --> 01:27:23,366
Get new canvas aloft!

1001
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:27,322
All hands, tend sails!

1002
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:28,969
Aye, aye, sir.

1003
01:27:29,251 --> 01:27:30,570
Get aloft.

1004
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:34,089
They'll trammel under!

1005
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:43,010
Aloft with ye! Aloft!

1006
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,725
Get up there! Get aloft!

1007
01:28:35,011 --> 01:28:38,560
Captain, we cannot get more canvas up
in this wind!

1008
01:28:38,651 --> 01:28:39,800
We must!

1009
01:28:46,491 --> 01:28:48,447
She won't come up!

1010
01:29:01,811 --> 01:29:03,130
The masts!

1011
01:29:03,651 --> 01:29:06,290
Cut them away! Cut!

1012
01:29:06,371 --> 01:29:09,329
It's away with the masts, or we capsize!

1013
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:18,530
The masts! Cut the masts!

1014
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:02,684
Let fall.

1015
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:06,601
Let fall, I say.

1016
01:30:07,371 --> 01:30:10,090
I'll run you through.

1017
01:30:31,491 --> 01:30:33,402
St. Elmo's fire!

1018
01:30:34,611 --> 01:30:36,283
Have mercy on us!

1019
01:30:37,451 --> 01:30:40,329
Aye, men!

1020
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:44,282
Mark it well.

1021
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:49,410
It lights our way to the white whale!

1022
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:05,962
Thus I put out...

1023
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:09,484
the last fear.

1024
01:31:20,531 --> 01:31:21,884
Clear away!

1025
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:25,601
Raise new sail! We're running on!

1026
01:31:25,691 --> 01:31:28,285
Jump, my hearties! Jump now!

1027
01:31:33,051 --> 01:31:35,519
Where are the crew of the Pequod?

1028
01:31:36,131 --> 01:31:39,203
There is not one face I know among 30.

1029
01:31:39,811 --> 01:31:41,881
He has snatched their souls.

1030
01:31:42,611 --> 01:31:45,079
Look at them. They are gloves.

1031
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,646
Ahab fills them. Ahab moves them.

1032
01:31:48,011 --> 01:31:51,799
You must admit, Mr. Starbuck,
he called that typhoon's bluff.

1033
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:56,841
Stood toe-to-toe with the bully,
traded blows with it till it hollered, "Help!"

1034
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,401
Aye, man. And did you see
how he grabbed St. Elmo's fire by the tail?

1035
01:32:00,491 --> 01:32:02,402
Only Ahab would do that.

1036
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:06,802
I see how madmen beget more madmen.

1037
01:32:07,891 --> 01:32:10,610
Yet could I cure their madness now?

1038
01:32:11,491 --> 01:32:13,243
Great God, where art thou?

1039
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:14,765
Shall I?

1040
01:32:17,891 --> 01:32:19,563
Heave up!

1041
01:32:21,051 --> 01:32:22,370
Avast!

1042
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:48,490
It's a mild day, Starbuck.

1043
01:32:48,571 --> 01:32:50,527
Mild-looking sky.

1044
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:55,330
On such a day, I struck my first whale.

1045
01:32:55,771 --> 01:32:58,843
A boy harpooneer. Forty, aye.

1046
01:32:59,811 --> 01:33:03,486
Forty years and a thousand lowerings ago.

1047
01:33:05,731 --> 01:33:08,370
Why this madness of the chase...

1048
01:33:08,451 --> 01:33:11,443
this boiling blood and smoking brow?

1049
01:33:11,931 --> 01:33:15,970
Why palsy the arm at the oar,
the iron, and the lance?

1050
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:23,645
I feel old, Starbuck, and bowed.

1051
01:33:25,451 --> 01:33:27,169
As though I were Adam...

1052
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:30,803
staggering under the piled centuries...

1053
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:32,967
since paradise.

1054
01:33:37,531 --> 01:33:40,728
Stand close, Starbuck. Close to me.

1055
01:33:40,811 --> 01:33:43,245
Let me look into a human eye.

1056
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:48,441
It is better than to gaze into sea or sky.

1057
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:59,966
Captain, now for the last time, I ask thee,
I implore thee...

1058
01:34:00,331 --> 01:34:03,004
Iet us fly these deadly waters.
Let us home.

1059
01:34:03,891 --> 01:34:07,725
Have they not such mild blue days
even as this in old New Bedford?

1060
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:13,083
What is it?

1061
01:34:14,611 --> 01:34:18,889
What nameless, inscrutable,
unearthly thing...

1062
01:34:20,451 --> 01:34:24,763
commands me against all human lovings
and longings...

1063
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:29,930
to keep pushing and crowding
and jamming myself on all the time...

1064
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:33,962
making me do
what in my own natural heart...

1065
01:34:34,051 --> 01:34:36,087
I dare not dream of doing?

1066
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:39,287
Is Ahab, Ahab?

1067
01:34:39,851 --> 01:34:43,480
Is it I, God, or who...

1068
01:34:43,571 --> 01:34:45,368
that lifts this arm?

1069
01:34:46,691 --> 01:34:49,251
But if the great sun cannot move...

1070
01:34:49,371 --> 01:34:51,646
except by God's invisible power...

1071
01:34:53,251 --> 01:34:55,367
how can my small heart beat...

1072
01:34:56,211 --> 01:34:58,327
my brain think thoughts...

1073
01:34:58,931 --> 01:35:02,606
unless God does that beating,
does that thinking...

1074
01:35:02,731 --> 01:35:04,130
does that living...

1075
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:06,522
and not I?

1076
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:11,288
By heavens, man...

1077
01:35:12,371 --> 01:35:16,000
we are turned round and round
in this world...

1078
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:19,960
Like yonder windlass...

1079
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:22,889
and fate is the handspike.

1080
01:35:23,971 --> 01:35:27,441
And all the time, that smiling sky...

1081
01:35:28,971 --> 01:35:31,690
and this unsounded sea.

1082
01:35:32,931 --> 01:35:35,320
Look ye into its deeps...

1083
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:39,081
and see the everlasting slaughter
that goes on.

1084
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:43,403
Who put it into its creatures
to chase and fang one another?

1085
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:46,321
Where do murderers go, man?

1086
01:35:47,331 --> 01:35:48,605
Who's to doom...

1087
01:35:48,691 --> 01:35:52,127
when the judge himself
is dragged before the bar?

1088
01:35:54,731 --> 01:35:57,086
But it is a mild day...

1089
01:35:57,811 --> 01:35:59,927
and a mild-looking sky.

1090
01:36:05,571 --> 01:36:07,163
What ails you, Starbuck?

1091
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:11,722
Why do you tremble so?

1092
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:15,685
Because I do not have the bowels
to slaughter thee...

1093
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:19,320
and save the whole ship's company
from being dragged to doom.

1094
01:36:20,971 --> 01:36:23,644
I plainly see my miserable office:

1095
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:25,729
to obey, rebelling.

1096
01:36:27,011 --> 01:36:29,969
Worse still, to help thee
to thine impious end.

1097
01:36:31,451 --> 01:36:34,363
Starbuck, ye are tied to me.

1098
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,561
This act is immutably decreed.

1099
01:36:38,451 --> 01:36:40,806
It was rehearsed by ye and me...

1100
01:36:41,851 --> 01:36:44,649
a billion years before this ocean rolled.

1101
01:36:53,651 --> 01:36:54,845
The air.

1102
01:36:58,371 --> 01:37:01,283
Do you smell it, lads,
what the wind carries?

1103
01:37:05,651 --> 01:37:07,084
It smells like land.

1104
01:37:07,171 --> 01:37:08,729
- Like an island.
- Aye.

1105
01:37:08,811 --> 01:37:11,644
A coral reef, green moss, shells...

1106
01:37:11,771 --> 01:37:15,127
bits and pieces
from all the oceans he ever swam through.

1107
01:37:15,211 --> 01:37:17,884
An island to himself is the white whale.

1108
01:37:19,171 --> 01:37:20,240
Elijah.

1109
01:37:22,411 --> 01:37:23,969
What say you, lad?

1110
01:37:24,531 --> 01:37:26,806
The day we sailed, a man....

1111
01:37:27,571 --> 01:37:29,129
Elijah, his name was.

1112
01:37:29,571 --> 01:37:31,482
- Well?
- He said....

1113
01:37:32,611 --> 01:37:34,761
He said, "A day will come at sea...

1114
01:37:34,851 --> 01:37:37,524
"when you smell land
where there be no land.

1115
01:37:38,211 --> 01:37:41,089
"And on that day,
Ahab will go to his grave.

1116
01:37:42,531 --> 01:37:46,046
"But he will rise again and beckon.

1117
01:37:47,491 --> 01:37:48,890
"And then all...

1118
01:37:53,651 --> 01:37:55,767
"all, save one, shall follow."

1119
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:01,603
There she blows!

1120
01:38:11,651 --> 01:38:12,925
Look.

1121
01:38:16,371 --> 01:38:19,283
Mastheaders, the birds mark the place.

1122
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:21,283
Watch the birds!

1123
01:38:22,131 --> 01:38:24,008
Helmsman, luff a point.

1124
01:38:25,371 --> 01:38:26,804
Stand by the boats!

1125
01:38:26,931 --> 01:38:28,683
Down topgallants!

1126
01:38:28,771 --> 01:38:31,126
- Same old bet, Stubb?
- Aye.

1127
01:38:39,131 --> 01:38:40,849
No, Pip. Stay on board.

1128
01:38:40,931 --> 01:38:44,241
You be captain in my absence.
Stand ye there on the deck in my place.

1129
01:38:44,331 --> 01:38:45,889
Lower away!

1130
01:38:51,491 --> 01:38:52,924
I'm Captain Pip.

1131
01:38:54,411 --> 01:38:56,561
Did you see him, men?

1132
01:38:56,771 --> 01:39:00,605
Did you see his hump?
Like a great snow hill.

1133
01:39:01,091 --> 01:39:03,525
Did you see the way he slides along?

1134
01:39:04,131 --> 01:39:06,645
There's majesty for you.

1135
01:39:06,851 --> 01:39:08,250
Don't look.

1136
01:39:08,891 --> 01:39:10,961
I'll look for you.

1137
01:39:13,731 --> 01:39:16,120
Did you see the lances in his back?

1138
01:39:16,891 --> 01:39:18,210
My lances.

1139
01:39:18,851 --> 01:39:20,045
Mine.

1140
01:39:20,131 --> 01:39:22,122
Struck in him years ago.

1141
01:39:25,571 --> 01:39:27,129
That's my lads.

1142
01:39:27,451 --> 01:39:29,248
Wrack the oars off.

1143
01:39:29,531 --> 01:39:31,089
Lay into it.

1144
01:39:31,331 --> 01:39:33,003
Pull there, boys!

1145
01:39:33,331 --> 01:39:35,799
Pull, you green-faced posies!

1146
01:39:38,211 --> 01:39:40,202
Long and strong, men.

1147
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:42,486
Shake your bones, men.

1148
01:39:42,651 --> 01:39:44,164
Break in two.

1149
01:39:44,931 --> 01:39:47,399
Moby Dick, show your trump.

1150
01:39:47,771 --> 01:39:49,489
Blister your lungs!

1151
01:39:49,731 --> 01:39:51,767
We'll dam off your blood for ye!

1152
01:40:10,971 --> 01:40:12,450
Pull soft now.

1153
01:40:21,731 --> 01:40:23,130
He's sounded.

1154
01:40:25,851 --> 01:40:27,045
Ship oars.

1155
01:41:29,891 --> 01:41:31,802
Rise now, ye white whale.

1156
01:41:32,331 --> 01:41:34,526
Show us your crooked jaw.

1157
01:41:35,691 --> 01:41:38,205
Show us your wrinkled brow.

1158
01:41:40,131 --> 01:41:41,359
Rise.

1159
01:41:44,251 --> 01:41:45,684
Those birds.

1160
01:41:48,531 --> 01:41:50,044
He rises!

1161
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:56,606
In!

1162
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:59,765
In and after him!

1163
01:42:06,611 --> 01:42:07,760
Ride!

1164
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:33,886
Pull in!

1165
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:46,603
Let the men go!

1166
01:42:51,451 --> 01:42:53,567
Pull in, men! Closer!

1167
01:42:53,651 --> 01:42:55,084
He'll not escape!

1168
01:42:56,931 --> 01:43:00,287
Thunder in hell! What's wrong with ye?

1169
01:43:08,011 --> 01:43:09,683
Damn ye!

1170
01:43:14,851 --> 01:43:18,526
Ye whale! Ye damned whale!

1171
01:44:27,491 --> 01:44:31,803
From hell's heart I stab at thee!

1172
01:44:32,131 --> 01:44:33,883
For hate's sake...

1173
01:44:34,691 --> 01:44:39,321
I spit my last breath at thee...

1174
01:44:39,491 --> 01:44:42,244
thou damned whale!

1175
01:45:08,331 --> 01:45:11,926
Away, no more of this.
Back to the Pequod. No more of this.

1176
01:45:25,691 --> 01:45:27,488
You see? Do you see?

1177
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:30,970
Ahab beckons.

1178
01:45:31,411 --> 01:45:33,481
He's dead, but he beckons.

1179
01:45:35,651 --> 01:45:37,687
In after him!

1180
01:45:39,651 --> 01:45:40,970
After him!

1181
01:45:41,051 --> 01:45:42,245
After that devil?

1182
01:45:42,371 --> 01:45:44,566
Moby Dick's no devil. He's a whale.

1183
01:45:44,651 --> 01:45:47,643
A monstrous big whale, aye,
but a whale, no more.

1184
01:45:47,731 --> 01:45:49,562
And we're whaling men, no less.

1185
01:45:49,651 --> 01:45:52,245
We do not turn from whales. We kill them.

1186
01:45:52,331 --> 01:45:54,162
We'll kill Moby Dick!

1187
01:45:54,811 --> 01:45:56,005
Pull!

1188
01:45:57,731 --> 01:46:00,325
Ye heard Mr. Starbuck, didn't ye?

1189
01:46:01,051 --> 01:46:02,370
Didn't ye?

1190
01:46:03,091 --> 01:46:05,047
Be ye whaling men or no?

1191
01:46:05,451 --> 01:46:07,681
Pull, ye sheep-heads. Pull!

1192
01:46:18,371 --> 01:46:21,010
Ye should not have come back,
ye grinning whale.

1193
01:46:21,091 --> 01:46:23,685
We're cutting new mouths
in ye to grin with.

1194
01:49:21,851 --> 01:49:23,170
The coffin.

1195
01:49:24,011 --> 01:49:27,447
Drowned Queequeg's coffin
was my life buoy.

1196
01:49:27,971 --> 01:49:29,802
For one whole day and night...

1197
01:49:29,891 --> 01:49:33,566
it sustained me
on that soft and dirge-like main.

1198
01:49:34,371 --> 01:49:36,043
Then a sail appeared.

1199
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:38,163
It was the Rachel.

1200
01:49:39,011 --> 01:49:41,889
The Rachel,
who in her long melancholy search...

1201
01:49:41,971 --> 01:49:44,405
for her missing children found...

1202
01:49:45,091 --> 01:49:46,604
another orphan.

1203
01:49:48,891 --> 01:49:50,529
The drama's done.

1204
01:49:51,091 --> 01:49:52,968
All are departed away.

1205
01:49:53,931 --> 01:49:56,001
The great shroud of the sea...

1206
01:49:56,091 --> 01:49:58,924
rolls over the Pequod, her crew...

1207
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:01,084
and Moby Dick.

1208
01:50:02,171 --> 01:50:05,208
I only am escaped, alone...

1209
01:50:05,571 --> 01:50:07,129
to tell thee.
