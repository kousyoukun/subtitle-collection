1
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
What do you want?

2
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,110
Beer.

3
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,030
All I got is piss-warm Chango.

4
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,660
That's my brand.

5
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,340
This is damn good.

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,475
I'd say this is the best beer
I've ever had.

7
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,270
Actually...

8
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,770
Need anything there?

9
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,270
I'm just glad to be alive right now.

10
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,070
I was up a few towns away.
You know Saragosa?

11
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,030
I was at a bar there.
Not unlike this one, they serve beer.

12
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,075
Not as good as this, but close.

13
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,500
And I saw something
you wouldn't believe.

14
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:06,959
I'm sitting there by myself.

15
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,585
Now, this bar...

16
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,421
...was full of lowlifes.

17
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,636
I mean,
not like this place here.

18
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,388
No, I mean bad.

19
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:21,390
Like they were up to no good.

20
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:25,602
I'm all by myself.
I like it that way.

21
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,564
Meanwhile, things are going on.

22
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,943
Under-the-table kinds of things.
Not too obvious...

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,028
...but not too secret either.

24
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,240
So...

25
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:40,075
...I'm sitting...

26
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:45,372
...and in walks...

27
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:48,917
<i>... the biggest Mexican</i>
<i>I have ever seen...</i>

28
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,003
<i>... like he owns the place.</i>

29
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:54,214
<i>Nobody knew what</i>
<i>to make of him or think of him.</i>

30
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:57,217
<i>But there he was, and in he walked.</i>

31
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,469
He was dark too.

32
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,181
I don't mean dark-skinned.

33
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,142
This was different.

34
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:07,936
It was as if he was always
walking in a shadow.

35
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,606
<i>Every step he took</i>
<i>towards the light...</i>

36
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:14,526
<i>... just when you thought his face</i>
<i>would be revealed, it wasn't.</i>

37
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,279
It was as if the lights dimmed...

38
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:18,405
...just for him.

39
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,416
So this guy...

40
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,794
<i>... takes a seat at the bar...</i>

41
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,339
<i>... orders a soda, sits back,</i>
<i>says nothing.</i>

42
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,882
He ordered a soda pop?

43
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:39,509
I wasn't interested in his drink.

44
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:42,221
I was interested in what he carried.

45
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:46,475
<i>Some sort of a suitcase,</i>
<i>kind of heavy.</i>

46
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,770
<i>And he sat that thing beside him</i>
<i>as if it were his girl.</i>

47
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,900
Then, all of a sudden,
the bastard spoke.

48
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,488
You know he was talking business
because he upset the bartender.

49
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,782
Especially when he mentioned...

50
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,493
He said something like :

51
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:08,080
"Bitch" or...

52
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,831
..."Bucho."

53
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:17,881
That's what it was.

54
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,424
Bucho!

55
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,596
<i>He pissed off the bartender plenty.</i>

56
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,349
<i>Some of those unsavory characters...</i>

57
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,478
...not like these boys, but real scum,
they got pissed too.

58
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:35,399
Started pulling guns and knives.
Starting some shit.

59
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,276
<i>Now, the stranger...</i>

60
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,111
...he bolts off of the barstool.

61
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,822
He dives into the middle of the room
with his case.

62
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,864
Dives right in.

63
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:46,702
I don't know what he does there, but in
two shakes the suitcase is open...

64
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:51,081
...and he's pulled out the biggest hand
cannon I've ever fucking seen.

65
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,187
That was just the beginning.

66
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:19,151
You just stood there?
You didn't run for cover or join in?

67
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:21,570
I was frozen stiff.

68
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,156
All I could do was watch this...

69
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,162
...thing tear the place apart.

70
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,580
<i>It was amazing.</i>

71
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,004
Cutthroat scumbags were coming forward
and dying much-deserved deaths.

72
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:43,175
Don't get me wrong, this was no
class-act group like you got here.

73
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,718
Not at all.

74
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,429
No, these guys were world-class turds.

75
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,307
I'm sorry, but they got
what they deserved.

76
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,351
It was Judgment Night in that place.

77
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,106
<i>He grabs one of these guys...</i>

78
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,067
...the only guy still breathing.

79
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,527
<i>He starts getting</i>
<i>information out of him.</i>

80
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,404
<i>And I knew by the whispering...</i>

81
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,865
<i>... this guy was giving up the goods.</i>

82
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,785
Spilling his guts.
Confessing the world.

83
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:11,912
He told that stranger everything.

84
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,665
Everything?

85
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,091
Can I get a cleaner mug?
This one's dirty.

86
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:27,094
Fuck you.

87
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,264
It's the cleanest one I got.

88
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:40,274
So anyway...

89
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,359
...without warning...

90
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,444
...without any hint or preview...

91
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,613
...the stranger whips around...

92
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:48,031
...and he sees...

93
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:49,616
<i>... me.</i>

94
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,702
You saw his face?

95
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,704
His face?

96
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,038
No.

97
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,958
His eyes.

98
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,270
<i>And he didn't do anything to you?</i>

99
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,023
<i>Not really. He turned</i>
<i>to the guy on the floor.</i>

100
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,402
<i>Stranger shot him...</i>

101
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,990
<i>... walked over to the bartender,</i>
<i>paid and left.</i>

102
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:32,367
The bartender lived?

103
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,374
The bartender never gets killed.

104
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,835
But...

105
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:44,880
...as he neared the door...

106
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:54,890
No, man, the bartender got it
worse than anybody.

107
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,938
Here.

108
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,481
It's on the house...

109
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,817
...if you remember his face.

110
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,404
Thanks, but no thanks.

111
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:11,990
I'm clearing out of here.

112
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,700
Because I think...

113
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,036
...he's headed this way.

114
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:19,331
Thank you, boys!

115
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,084
Y'all take care!

116
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:04,228
Get back.

117
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,773
Stay back.

118
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,521
Who is it?

119
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,107
It's your only friend.

120
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:23,825
Don't you think you're being
a little too cautious?

121
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,711
One day you'll lay too hard on that
and blow your brains out.

122
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,091
What do you want?

123
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,013
He's there.

124
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:50,018
I mentioned his name
and they freaked.

125
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,187
Bucho's there?

126
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,108
One second they weren't
listening to a word I said...

127
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,193
...but when I mentioned him...

128
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,361
...they listened.

129
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,908
And suddenly they got very interested
in who you were.

130
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,454
So I laid the story down
nice and thick.

131
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,415
How thick?

132
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,958
Pretty thick.

133
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,294
You were the biggest Mexican
I'd ever seen.

134
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,503
Wonderful.

135
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,964
I exaggerated, but they bought it.

136
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,425
They're shitting bricks right now,
I promise.

137
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,718
Where do I go?

138
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,557
Tarasco Bar's a good start.

139
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:31,810
Don't turn it into a bloodbath
like last time.

140
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,896
That wasn't my fault.

141
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:34,980
Of course not.

142
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,231
They started it.

143
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,400
Whatever. Just remember...

144
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,945
...Bucho has plenty of thugs,
but without them, he's dead.

145
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:43,947
Save your bullets.

146
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,282
Suddenly...

147
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,035
...you're my big brother.

148
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,747
I do feel some responsibility for you.

149
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,210
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

150
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,295
What happens when he's dead?

151
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,799
When Bucho's dead...

152
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:07,721
...it's over.

153
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,558
He's the last one.

154
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,145
End of payback. Eye for an eye.

155
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,689
You finally going to be satisfied?

156
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,150
I think so.

157
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,486
I hope so.

158
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,368
I don't have the stomach
for this anymore.

159
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,412
You never did.

160
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,666
Neither did you.

161
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,018
I just called the Oro Verde Bar in
Saragosa.

162
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,147
There was no answer.

163
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,026
Let me know if you hear anything.

164
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,951
I want a close lookout
on all operations.

165
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,955
That means double and triple checking,
even our regular customers.

166
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,414
I'll handle it.

167
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:43,418
Where's my car? Is it finished?
How long must I wait?

168
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,003
I sent it back.

169
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,257
Again? I could have built the thing
myself by now.

170
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,592
- And what's this?
- It's my sister's nephew.

171
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:54,263
He needs work, so he wanted to
show you his fighting abilities.

172
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,141
You call this an audition,
fighting against Pipon?

173
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,521
If he can't beat Cristos, I'm not
interested. Get in there.

174
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,565
Get out!

175
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,752
He doesn't look special so far.

176
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:28,672
Kick his ass!

177
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,711
That's more like it.

178
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,593
He'll never dance again.

179
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,689
- So much for Cristos.
- Told you.

180
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,734
Listen. This is what I want you to do.

181
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,696
Take extra men and place them
around the Tarasco and La Azteca.

182
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,699
These Colombians wonder
if I can handle the extra volume.

183
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,993
They're watching us enough as it is.

184
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,745
- Hey.
- What?

185
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:42,955
And him?

186
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,294
Cast that leg up.
And welcome to the family.

187
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,007
I have a house payment.

188
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,853
Excuse me.

189
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,438
But...

190
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,357
...I used to work in a bar...

191
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,235
...so I know what it's like
to wait on people.

192
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,571
And I want to tell you
that the service here...

193
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,366
...needs immediate improvement.

194
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,035
What do you mean?

195
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,745
What do I mean?

196
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,914
Our waiter...

197
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,333
...where is he?

198
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,088
Don't tell me
he's still in the bathroom.

199
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,176
He never came back to see if we
wanted anything else.

200
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,512
He never brought us our check.

201
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,432
We wanted our check so we could
get the hell out of here.

202
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,395
Here.

203
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,480
This should be sufficient.

204
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,024
And don't be expecting a tip.

205
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,362
If you don't treat me good,
I won't ask you out.

206
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,615
And your beer tastes like piss.

207
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,451
- We know!
- Because we piss in it!

208
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,579
That's not all!

209
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,624
Bad beer, bad service.

210
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,376
Don't they know not to come in?

211
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,470
<i>2 cervezas.</i>

212
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,473
These are for you.

213
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,776
Just a minute.

214
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,253
I wanted to see the guitar.

215
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,591
Do you play?

216
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,843
Yes, do you?

217
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,679
A little bit.

218
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,056
Play something.

219
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,809
Not right now.

220
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,229
This is my father's,
but he doesn't play anymore.

221
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,647
No?

222
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,485
There's not much work for a mariachi.
Now he just watches TV.

223
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,447
I'm sorry to hear that.

224
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,866
He was never that good anyway.

225
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,578
Not as good as I'll be. Listen.

226
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,253
Loosen your fingers a bit.

227
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,677
Like this.

228
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,476
You know what I mean?

229
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,770
Loosen them up.

230
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,024
How do you do that?

231
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,817
All right.

232
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,528
Give me this.

233
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,538
Forget this hand, okay?
You want to get faster.

234
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,874
Here's the secret.

235
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,130
Got it?

236
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,757
Good.

237
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,468
Practice this...

238
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,679
...every day.

239
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,184
All day.

240
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,103
Next time...

241
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,815
...I'll show you how to play a tune...

242
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,859
...using what you've learned.

243
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,906
Practice.

244
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,308
This reminds me of a joke.

245
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,521
This guy comes into a bar...

246
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,856
...walks to the bartender and says...

247
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,484
..." Bartender, I got a bet for you.

248
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,445
I'll bet you $300 that I can piss...

249
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,656
...into that glass over there...

250
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,324
...and not spill a drop."

251
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,912
The bartender looks at the glass.
It's 10 feet away.

252
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,163
He says...

253
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,666
..."You're telling me
you'll bet me $300...

254
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,877
...that you can piss,
standing here...

255
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,255
...into that glass,
and not spill a single drop?"

256
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,258
Customer looks up and says :

257
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,218
"That's right."

258
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,804
Bartender says, "You've got a bet."

259
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,307
The guy goes, "Okay, here we go."

260
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,726
Pulls out his thing.

261
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,811
He's thinking about the glass.

262
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,522
He's thinking about the glass.
Thinking about his dick.

263
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,568
Dick, glass, dick, glass,
dick, glass, dick, glass.

264
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,987
Then he lets it rip.

265
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,407
He pisses all over the place.

266
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,200
He pisses on the bar.

267
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,662
He pisses on the stools,
on the floor, the phone.

268
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,831
On the bartender!

269
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,127
He's pissing everywhere
except the fucking glass!

270
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,175
Bartender's laughing.
He's $300 richer. He's like...

271
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,552
Piss dripping off his face.

272
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,013
He says, "You fucking idiot, man!

273
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,016
You got it in everything
except the glass!

274
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,728
You owe me $300, <i>puta."</i>

275
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,857
Guy goes, " Excuse me
just one little second."

276
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,609
Goes in the back of the bar.

277
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,528
There's a couple of guys
playing pool.

278
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,030
He walks over to them.

279
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,324
Comes back to the bar.

280
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,035
Goes, "Here you go. $300."

281
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,246
The bartender's like...

282
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,624
"Why are you so happy?
You just lost $300, idiot!"

283
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,460
The guy says,
"See those guys there?

284
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,256
I just bet them $500 apiece...

285
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,467
...that I could piss on your bar...

286
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,929
...your floor, your phone,
and piss on you...

287
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,183
...and not only would you not
be mad about it...

288
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,143
...you'd be happy."

289
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,237
That's funny shit, huh?

290
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,574
"You'd be happy about it!"

291
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,997
Guess what?

292
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,752
He didn't check out.

293
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:52,880
You...

294
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,800
...you checked out just fine.

295
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,847
Well, I knew I would because...

296
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,348
...me and Bucco...

297
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,892
...we go way back.
- Bucho.

298
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,560
Him too.

299
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,398
And this guy...

300
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,192
- I just met him today.
- Go on in.

301
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,861
Good work, by the way.

302
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,279
- Good work.
- Go in.

303
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,157
It's nice to see you cross the I's
and dot the T's here.

304
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,200
It's cool, <i>ese,</i> cool.

305
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,660
Lead the way.

306
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,039
In there?

307
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,501
Fucking disgusting.

308
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,857
What do you want?

309
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,028
I'm just looking for work.

310
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,072
There's no work here.

311
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,366
I see.

312
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,374
Is there something to drink?

313
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,376
Is there something in the case?

314
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,878
Yeah.

315
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,337
What?

316
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,089
My guitar.

317
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,014
Sure you don't want to hear me play
before you say there's no work?

318
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,183
We just want to see
what's in the case.

319
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,935
If it's like you say...

320
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,770
...drink all you want.

321
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,443
But I told you already.

322
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,987
I'm a musician.
This is my guitar.

323
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,280
Don't touch it!

324
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,198
Get him away!

325
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,374
Hurry.

326
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:36,793
How you doing?

327
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,714
What is it?

328
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,507
It's a guitar.

329
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,138
It's a guitar.

330
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,184
We heard about a case full of guns.

331
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,310
I know.

332
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,938
Just had to make sure.

333
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,105
I understand.

334
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,903
It's him!

335
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,281
Well, yes.

336
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,491
It's me.

337
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,203
I'm not against you, so keep it down.

338
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,496
Keep it down.

339
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,333
I'm just looking for a man who calls...

340
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,003
Not yet.

341
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,493
What the fuck's going on?!

342
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,622
Is that going on now?

343
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,290
Watch him!

344
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,083
What the fuck's going on?

345
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,053
Friends of yours?

346
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,058
I swear I have no fucking idea
what the hell's going on!

347
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,614
Shit!

348
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,328
You missed me!

349
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,858
Get up.

350
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,486
Come here.

351
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,827
I'm looking for a man who
calls himself "Bucho."

352
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,371
That's all.

353
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,125
But you had to do it the hard way.

354
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,799
Listen to me.

355
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,636
I don't want to kill you.

356
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,723
I just want you to take me to him.
Understand?

357
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,070
Tried to shoot me in the back, huh?!

358
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,955
Fucker!

359
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,741
If you want to go...

360
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,243
...go.

361
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,788
If you're going to stay...

362
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,416
...relax.

363
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,476
Fuck you!

364
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,845
The money's still in back.

365
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,472
So's the pickup.

366
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:54,434
Pick-up Guy's lying on the floor
with 3 bullets in his head.

367
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,187
- Tavo must have shot him.
- Where's Tavo?

368
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,855
Tavo's outside.

369
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:00,857
Where?

370
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,234
2 blocks up.

371
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,861
Tell him to get his ass over here!

372
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,656
- I want to know what happened!
- He's dead.

373
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,026
I'll tell you, boss...

374
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,696
...whoever it was didn't
come for the money.

375
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,033
They came for me.

376
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,706
You've heard stories of the man
with a guitar case full of weapons.

377
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,127
Those are stories.
That's all they are, stories.

378
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:04,546
I cannot believe it.

379
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,888
Can't you see we are fucking closed?!

380
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:17,267
We need to find him.

381
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,686
You said the Colombians are watching.

382
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,521
So we move quickly.

383
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:23,607
He's probably left town.

384
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,984
He knows I'm here now.

385
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,278
He's not going anywhere.

386
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,250
Where am I?

387
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,252
Bookstore.

388
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,712
Bookstore-cafe.

389
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,345
What the hell did you give me?

390
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,013
Painkillers.

391
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,348
I'm operating.

392
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,898
Where is everybody?

393
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,568
I closed early
so no one would come around.

394
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,904
No one would come around anyway.

395
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:13,323
Why?

396
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,075
Nobody reads.

397
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,501
Is it yours? All those...

398
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,919
...books?

399
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,255
It's mine.

400
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,507
My parents passed away.

401
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:33,427
They left me the building
and some money.

402
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,178
I have an apartment upstairs.

403
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:40,475
Why a bookstore?

404
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:43,020
This town never had a bookstore.

405
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,315
So I get this bright idea.

406
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,778
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

407
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,491
Why a bookstore, huh?

408
00:42:57,326 --> 00:42:59,620
All right. Isn't there a hospital?

409
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:03,165
Trust me. You don't want
to go to a hospital here.

410
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,629
You'll never find work in this town.

411
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:10,547
What?

412
00:43:11,215 --> 00:43:12,466
The guitar.

413
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,593
Nobody hires musicians around here.

414
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,596
I know.

415
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,934
I use it to pick up girls.

416
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,942
Oh, come on!

417
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:39,826
- You see this?
- I see it.

418
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:43,121
That one had your name on it.

419
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,043
You don't even know my name.

420
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,253
That's right.

421
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,755
I don't know your name.

422
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:54,633
You smoke?

423
00:43:57,219 --> 00:43:58,220
Nope.

424
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,229
Thanks.

425
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:10,440
It's the least I can do for you,
after saving my life.

426
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,318
Have a couple more.

427
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,571
- What is it?
- Painkillers.

428
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,450
Hot water.

429
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:22,786
Shit!

430
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:24,621
What're you doing?!

431
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,123
- Sorry.
- You're crazy.

432
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:29,042
Relax. Here, this is the cold water.

433
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:36,508
Better?

434
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,219
Let's stitch you up.

435
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:08,916
Get out of here!

436
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:26,702
I know you.

437
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:29,037
Really?

438
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:33,876
You're that guy you always
hear stories about.

439
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,087
You kill drug dealers.

440
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,131
Do you know Bucho?

441
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:43,677
I hope you don't think
you can take Bucho alone.

442
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:44,761
You know him?

443
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,054
Yeah.

444
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:50,058
I have a few friends I can call.

445
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:51,393
They owe me a favor.

446
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:54,563
Don't complain.

447
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:58,567
That would be straight if you hadn't
been moving so much.

448
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:00,569
That one's worse.

449
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,154
Who did that one?

450
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,531
I did, a long time ago.

451
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:14,208
I don't want to know what that is.

452
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:21,506
Saved my life more than once.

453
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:24,218
You can have it.

454
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,345
No, thanks.

455
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,514
No, I'm okay.

456
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,061
Will you help me?

457
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:40,859
I don't think I can help you.

458
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:45,155
I must leave my things here
for a few minutes.

459
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:48,158
Okay.

460
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:49,785
I can trust you, right?

461
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:50,869
Yeah.

462
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:51,787
Really?

463
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:54,957
All right.

464
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:56,625
Where're you going?

465
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,877
I have to go to church.

466
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:00,546
What for?

467
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:02,548
Confess my sins.

468
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,299
I'm a sinner.

469
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:05,676
I know.

470
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,642
Did I thank you?

471
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,727
No, you didn't.

472
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,815
I will.

473
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,001
What do you think?

474
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,838
Bulletproof windows...

475
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,423
...sidings...

476
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:45,757
...the hood.

477
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,052
Just what you asked for.

478
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:53,515
Listen...

479
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:57,644
...there are no more pickups today,
except one in Hidalgo.

480
00:48:57,895 --> 00:48:59,146
Stay away from there.

481
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:03,150
The rest of the town is game.
Take this car and find him!

482
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,401
I'll take my truck.

483
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:06,653
Take the car. That's why I got it.

484
00:49:06,904 --> 00:49:08,614
If you see a stranger...

485
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,783
...kill him. I can't take
any more chances.

486
00:49:16,914 --> 00:49:18,415
The sunroof's bulletproof.

487
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:21,543
Works as a shield
when shooting out the top.

488
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,212
Look at this guy.

489
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,803
It works.
Now go and get him.

490
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:38,518
I want you to take her.
You'll need all the help you can get.

491
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:54,368
You too.

492
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:26,858
Bless me, Father, for I have
just killed quite a few men.

493
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:28,569
No shit.

494
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:32,656
From what I hear, you cleaned out
the entire Tarasco Bar.

495
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:36,410
Nice job. Every hit man
in Coahuila's looking for you.

496
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,120
Things got out of hand.

497
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:40,539
I said no more bloodbaths.

498
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:43,750
I told you. Bucho's the last one.

499
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,961
Then I'm finished.

500
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:49,631
No, I'm finished.
They killed the woman you loved.

501
00:50:49,882 --> 00:50:51,675
Then they shot through your hand.

502
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,927
Two points. Wake up!

503
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:56,638
There is no payback for that.

504
00:50:58,098 --> 00:50:59,016
Walk away.

505
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:01,476
Trust me...

506
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:05,522
...this is one you won't
want to see through to the end.

507
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,817
What do you mean?

508
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:13,322
I've done some checking, and Bucho
is not someone to mess with.

509
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:14,615
Trust me.

510
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,451
I cannot leave without Bucho.

511
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:20,621
You don't expect to live much longer?
Fine. I do.

512
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:22,331
If you need any more help...

513
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:23,665
...don't call me.

514
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:26,376
Call Campa and Quino.
They're crazy.

515
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:28,879
I should be able to count on you!

516
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:30,839
Those days are gone.

517
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:33,258
Just wait! Come on!

518
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:35,719
Good luck. Don't get shot.

519
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,348
Did you want confession?

520
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:45,938
Maybe later, Father.
Because where I am going...

521
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:48,315
...I'd just have to come right back.

522
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:16,802
Look...

523
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:21,056
...I didn't call about it before
because...

524
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,141
...I could handle it.

525
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,813
Yes, he's got no place to go.

526
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,566
I got my men on him right now.

527
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:33,986
You brought someone in?!

528
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:36,113
How long has he been here?

529
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:38,282
Who is he?

530
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:42,786
What are you talking about?
We can handle it.

531
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:45,831
Someone like that will
just tear the place up...

532
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:48,083
...will make a lot of noise.

533
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,171
What does your guy look like?

534
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:59,303
I've got to know, or the wrong people
might get killed.

535
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:03,932
Next time I'll call sooner,
but I knew I could handle this...

536
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:06,852
Shit!

537
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:13,150
What's the number
to the phone in my car?

538
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,946
Fuckheads, what's the number
to my car phone?!

539
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,448
Number!

540
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:24,369
It's in your car, boss.

541
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:46,934
What's the fucking number
to the phone in my car?

542
00:53:52,356 --> 00:53:53,273
Fuck.

543
00:53:56,443 --> 00:54:00,197
- What are you doing? Get away.
- You can't go away like this.

544
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,198
I need you.

545
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,535
I dreamt about her again.

546
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:06,954
So what!

547
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:10,624
Listen to me!

548
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,628
You are right.

549
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:17,130
You are right.

550
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:20,592
Maybe I should quit.

551
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:24,763
Now you're talking some sense,
because let me tell you...

552
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:27,891
...you keep this up
and it'll be over real quick.

553
00:55:07,097 --> 00:55:08,015
Get in!

554
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:16,315
Watch it!

555
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,285
Where is he? We got to kill him.

556
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:21,129
It's me again.

557
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,424
The man you sent in...
What does he look like?

558
00:56:25,926 --> 00:56:29,137
Just so that I know.
So my people don't get confused.

559
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:32,808
Dark hair, dark skin.
I figured that.

560
00:56:33,183 --> 00:56:34,977
Can I have a few more details?

561
00:56:35,811 --> 00:56:37,145
Tattoo on his chest.

562
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:41,692
Tattoo of a woman on his chest.

563
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,694
What else?

564
00:56:44,236 --> 00:56:45,320
Any weapons?

565
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:47,239
Throwing knives.

566
00:56:49,116 --> 00:56:50,117
And?

567
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:55,330
And pay-phone money so he can
call you with progress reports.

568
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:57,833
Yes, okay.

569
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,835
That should do it, thanks.

570
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,089
We'll stay out of his way.

571
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:05,924
Yeah, thank you.

572
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:10,929
Fuck!

573
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:15,309
This is what I was talking about.
Our own people are watching us.

574
00:57:15,517 --> 00:57:18,061
He's been here since this morning,
checking on us.

575
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,105
Bastards!

576
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:21,982
Go find him!

577
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:23,150
Go and find who?

578
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:24,735
There's no one else!

579
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:29,031
He is claimed as a Colombian.
They won't admit they're after you.

580
00:57:29,573 --> 00:57:33,660
There's someone else out there.
And I want to find him now!

581
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:35,162
Who else is there?

582
00:57:35,537 --> 00:57:36,872
The guitar player?

583
00:57:37,122 --> 00:57:38,540
The guy is a myth.

584
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:41,877
- A myth.
- You are not a believer.

585
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:44,213
That will be your downfall.

586
00:57:44,463 --> 00:57:47,299
I'm going with you.
I can't leave this up to you.

587
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:50,928
Now my ass is on the line.

588
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:09,112
<i>Manito!</i>

589
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:11,448
Why aren't you practicing?

590
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:14,660
I told you, man.
Every day, all day.

591
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,162
I can't play this guitar.

592
00:58:18,872 --> 00:58:19,957
Come on.

593
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:21,458
Where are you going?

594
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:23,669
I'm going to get my guitar.

595
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:25,420
I'll wait here.

596
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:27,339
It's right over there.

597
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,591
What's over there?

598
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,928
My guitar. I want to show you
I've been practicing.

599
00:58:42,938 --> 00:58:44,189
Stupid kid.

600
00:59:12,843 --> 00:59:15,721
Stay there.
No one else is supposed to be here.

601
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:22,978
See? Here it comes.

602
00:59:39,578 --> 00:59:41,955
See? Now this one I can play.

603
00:59:52,424 --> 00:59:53,926
Don't even think about it.

604
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:56,845
Give me the guitar.

605
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:58,847
The guitar!

606
01:00:02,351 --> 01:00:03,101
Go away.

607
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,778
Shit.

608
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:25,165
This your father's guitar?

609
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:29,169
Is this why he doesn't work now?

610
01:00:29,378 --> 01:00:31,380
They switch guitars every few days.

611
01:00:31,588 --> 01:00:32,839
What do you get?

612
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:36,593
My father doesn't have to work.
He watches TV.

613
01:00:36,843 --> 01:00:38,303
He says they hide it all over.

614
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:41,306
Ladies with baby carriages,
the church...

615
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:43,642
...bookstores. Ask Carolina.

616
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,685
She'll tell you.

617
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:46,144
She does the same thing.

618
01:01:03,996 --> 01:01:04,705
What? Jesus.

619
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:05,455
What? Jesus.

620
01:01:05,706 --> 01:01:07,583
- What did you tell him?!
- Who?

621
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:10,627
- You work for him, right?
- I work for nobody.

622
01:01:10,878 --> 01:01:12,713
I want to know what you said!

623
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:14,381
- Nothing.
- Nothing?!

624
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:16,466
What are you talking about?!

625
01:01:16,717 --> 01:01:17,634
You said I was at church!

626
01:01:17,885 --> 01:01:20,804
- I haven't said anything to anybody!
- Look at me now!

627
01:01:21,054 --> 01:01:22,389
You're protecting him!

628
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:23,599
- I'm not!
- You are!

629
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:26,810
If I was, I would've
told him you were here!

630
01:01:27,102 --> 01:01:27,853
You don't want him dead!

631
01:01:28,103 --> 01:01:31,773
I want no one dead!
Killing him is not the answer.

632
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:32,900
See?!

633
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,234
You know what I see?

634
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:36,695
I see you are no better than he is.

635
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,073
The same shit!

636
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,332
Anybody can be bought.

637
01:01:48,624 --> 01:01:50,000
Not anybody.

638
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,501
You're so good, huh?

639
01:01:51,793 --> 01:01:54,087
You see this bookstore? It's mine.

640
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:56,673
Somebody comes
and drops something off.

641
01:01:56,924 --> 01:01:58,759
- A couple of days later...
- How much?

642
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:00,594
...somebody else comes to
pick it up.

643
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:01,803
I rent space!

644
01:02:02,012 --> 01:02:03,805
- That's all I do.
- How much?!

645
01:02:04,014 --> 01:02:04,932
The back room.

646
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:07,017
How much does he pay you?

647
01:02:11,355 --> 01:02:12,773
$50,000 a year.

648
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:15,067
$50,000.

649
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:18,987
Cash.

650
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:31,917
Look at you. You're a mess again.
Come here.

651
01:02:41,802 --> 01:02:42,886
On the counter.

652
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:51,645
I didn't open this place
just to see it fail.

653
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:54,606
It wasn't making any money.
I would've had to close.

654
01:02:54,815 --> 01:02:58,485
One day, Bucho walks in
with a suitcase full of money...

655
01:02:58,735 --> 01:03:01,196
...and says to me,
"Carolina, take this...

656
01:03:01,446 --> 01:03:03,198
...and go about your business...

657
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:06,451
...and I will give you $50,000 a year."

658
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,083
They've done it with
a lot of people here.

659
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:15,711
They use our business as fronts.

660
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:19,381
I used some of the money
to keep this place open.

661
01:03:19,631 --> 01:03:21,842
And I stashed the rest, thinking...

662
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:23,635
...if some day...

663
01:03:23,886 --> 01:03:26,346
...things got really bad here...

664
01:03:26,597 --> 01:03:28,640
...I'd have the money to leave.

665
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,018
But I can't leave.

666
01:03:31,977 --> 01:03:34,646
Because once you're in,
you can't get out.

667
01:03:34,938 --> 01:03:37,566
The closest thing I had to a brother...

668
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:39,735
...was just killed.

669
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:43,322
I cannot stop what it is I have to do.

670
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:45,282
I cannot.

671
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:48,452
Damn it!

672
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:59,588
Do you need some help?

673
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:02,132
No. I was trying to move my...

674
01:04:02,716 --> 01:04:04,218
...my cash register.

675
01:04:05,135 --> 01:04:06,803
I needed a new one anyway.

676
01:04:16,313 --> 01:04:17,731
So...

677
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,816
...what brings you here?

678
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:22,903
I don't come around much anymore,
do I?

679
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:26,240
No.

680
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:29,076
How've you been?

681
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:30,827
Been okay.

682
01:04:31,245 --> 01:04:32,412
Business?

683
01:04:32,663 --> 01:04:34,331
Business is good.

684
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,126
About as good as it can be.

685
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:41,296
I told you...

686
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,297
...bookstores...

687
01:04:44,633 --> 01:04:46,093
Not in this town.

688
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:48,303
And you?

689
01:04:52,975 --> 01:04:56,895
I'm looking for someone
that's threatening our business.

690
01:04:57,104 --> 01:04:59,481
You may have heard
about the bar today.

691
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,234
Oh, yeah. There was a shooting.

692
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:05,737
Have you seen anyone around
that may look...

693
01:05:05,988 --> 01:05:06,697
Suspicious?

694
01:05:13,495 --> 01:05:14,663
No.

695
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:19,418
Fuck.

696
01:05:19,668 --> 01:05:23,422
The guy I'm looking for
is obviously dangerous...

697
01:05:26,008 --> 01:05:28,719
...so I'm not asking you
to confront him...

698
01:05:29,845 --> 01:05:30,846
...but...

699
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:32,014
...if you see him...

700
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:36,059
...will you call me?

701
01:05:37,144 --> 01:05:38,228
Sure.

702
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:42,858
I mean...

703
01:05:51,825 --> 01:05:54,494
...we can't have any more shootings.

704
01:06:04,254 --> 01:06:05,923
But I haven't seen him.

705
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:14,014
You...

706
01:06:14,264 --> 01:06:15,807
...wouldn't lie to me...

707
01:06:16,058 --> 01:06:17,142
...would you?

708
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:24,858
No.

709
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,657
That's some mess you've got.

710
01:06:32,366 --> 01:06:33,283
Yeah.

711
01:06:37,996 --> 01:06:39,248
I better clean it up.

712
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:43,418
Thank you for the coffee.
Call me.

713
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:45,045
Yes...

714
01:06:46,129 --> 01:06:47,798
...if I see him...

715
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:50,384
...I'll be sure to call you.

716
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,138
Call me.

717
01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:02,354
Was that him?

718
01:07:02,604 --> 01:07:05,941
You're not doing anything to him here
or we'll both be killed.

719
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:08,318
And I don't want to die over this.

720
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:11,738
Stay away from the window.

721
01:08:06,585 --> 01:08:08,462
This one's not so bad.

722
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:15,302
Actually, it's almost straight.

723
01:08:17,763 --> 01:08:19,473
Why didn't you tell him...

724
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:21,183
...I was here?

725
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:24,770
I don't know.

726
01:08:26,897 --> 01:08:29,608
I know you think
he's a terrible person.

727
01:08:31,318 --> 01:08:32,861
Honey, he is.

728
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:36,198
He is.

729
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:39,243
Not really.

730
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:41,578
He's got a good side to him.

731
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:44,498
And that's the only thing
that can save him.

732
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:51,630
What is this?

733
01:08:52,422 --> 01:08:54,091
That was for you.

734
01:08:54,424 --> 01:08:56,134
It was for me?

735
01:08:56,385 --> 01:08:58,178
It's not for me anymore?

736
01:08:59,346 --> 01:09:01,098
Okay, you can have it.

737
01:09:05,185 --> 01:09:08,438
I didn't get you a case,
since you already have one.

738
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:10,649
It's beautiful. Thank you.

739
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:12,401
And I was thinking maybe...

740
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:16,572
...you can clear out the guns
and put this in instead.

741
01:09:18,115 --> 01:09:19,199
Maybe.

742
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:21,535
Play something.

743
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:22,661
No.

744
01:09:22,953 --> 01:09:24,830
Come on, let me help you.

745
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:29,793
- I'm sorry.
- Be careful.

746
01:09:30,335 --> 01:09:31,420
It's okay.

747
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,298
No, I can't play anymore.

748
01:09:34,882 --> 01:09:35,632
Why?

749
01:09:35,924 --> 01:09:37,968
Well, look at my hand. It's...

750
01:09:39,511 --> 01:09:40,429
I can't.

751
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,431
We can improvise.

752
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:44,141
Improvise?

753
01:09:47,102 --> 01:09:48,186
Do you play?

754
01:09:50,397 --> 01:09:51,648
A little.

755
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,484
All right.

756
01:09:59,406 --> 01:10:01,283
That's not even a note.

757
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,911
Let me show you.

758
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:06,246
Put these fingers over here.

759
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,748
Like this?

760
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,375
Good. That's nice.

761
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:11,793
Let me see.

762
01:10:27,309 --> 01:10:28,227
All right.

763
01:12:30,891 --> 01:12:31,892
Memo...

764
01:12:32,434 --> 01:12:33,936
...he's in the bookstore.

765
01:12:34,519 --> 01:12:35,979
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

766
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:41,944
Check it out anyway. If he's in there,
and she's hiding him...

767
01:12:42,194 --> 01:12:43,445
...kill them both.

768
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,739
Make it look like an accident.

769
01:12:47,032 --> 01:12:48,784
It's a bookstore.

770
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:50,535
Burn it down.

771
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,255
Move!

772
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,550
Come on!

773
01:15:10,217 --> 01:15:11,051
Hurry!

774
01:15:11,635 --> 01:15:12,386
Take this!

775
01:15:12,761 --> 01:15:13,845
Do what?

776
01:15:17,808 --> 01:15:18,809
Come on!

777
01:15:19,059 --> 01:15:19,810
What!

778
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,228
I must get my purse!

779
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,521
Fuck it!

780
01:15:25,148 --> 01:15:25,816
Wait!

781
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:27,401
Wait!

782
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:28,735
Here.

783
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:34,032
You look great.

784
01:15:35,325 --> 01:15:36,410
Thank you.

785
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:39,246
Where're we going?

786
01:15:39,538 --> 01:15:40,998
Downstairs, out the front.

787
01:15:41,206 --> 01:15:42,207
Take this.

788
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:51,091
Jesus Christ!

789
01:15:54,094 --> 01:15:55,345
What are you doing?!

790
01:15:57,931 --> 01:15:59,433
Get out of here!

791
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:10,944
Let's go!

792
01:16:44,019 --> 01:16:45,854
Go! Go! Go!

793
01:17:09,419 --> 01:17:10,504
You okay?

794
01:17:42,452 --> 01:17:44,371
I'm sorry, Carolina.

795
01:17:46,164 --> 01:17:47,416
I'm sorry.

796
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:57,885
That's him.

797
01:17:58,176 --> 01:17:59,011
What?

798
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:02,681
That's Bucho?

799
01:18:15,652 --> 01:18:17,863
I can shoot him from here.

800
01:18:21,074 --> 01:18:22,159
Motherfucker.

801
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:47,434
What?

802
01:18:53,774 --> 01:18:55,525
What are you doing?

803
01:18:55,734 --> 01:18:56,652
Shoot him.

804
01:18:56,902 --> 01:18:57,611
Shoot him!

805
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:01,907
My whole life was in there.

806
01:19:06,536 --> 01:19:07,996
Can't you see?

807
01:19:08,247 --> 01:19:10,707
Can't you see?
He's going to kill me.

808
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:12,000
Come on!

809
01:19:13,585 --> 01:19:14,294
Damn!

810
01:19:20,842 --> 01:19:23,637
What's wrong?
You had the perfect chance!

811
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:27,307
What's the matter?
Why didn't you shoot him?

812
01:19:34,982 --> 01:19:35,983
Come on.

813
01:19:36,483 --> 01:19:37,484
Come on.

814
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:40,112
Come on!

815
01:19:51,415 --> 01:19:52,916
Wait a minute!

816
01:20:03,343 --> 01:20:04,678
It's one thing...

817
01:20:04,887 --> 01:20:08,181
...if you can't find someone
running around the city...

818
01:20:08,807 --> 01:20:10,893
...hiding anyplace he chooses.

819
01:20:11,518 --> 01:20:13,270
I can understand that.

820
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,064
Now what I can't understand is...

821
01:20:16,398 --> 01:20:20,068
...how can you let him get away
when you knew where he was?

822
01:20:20,944 --> 01:20:22,613
You drive around town...

823
01:20:22,821 --> 01:20:24,865
...you see someone you don't know,
shoot them.

824
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:26,617
How hard is that?

825
01:20:38,337 --> 01:20:39,588
Look over there.

826
01:20:42,633 --> 01:20:43,634
I don't know him.

827
01:20:44,885 --> 01:20:46,553
Never seen him before.

828
01:20:47,387 --> 01:20:48,138
A gun!

829
01:20:49,431 --> 01:20:51,058
It must be him.

830
01:20:54,394 --> 01:20:56,271
Now, how hard is that?

831
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:00,984
It's that easy.

832
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,284
Look!

833
01:21:09,493 --> 01:21:10,994
Who are those guys?

834
01:21:11,245 --> 01:21:12,913
I've never seen them.

835
01:21:20,003 --> 01:21:21,588
Now, how hard is that?

836
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,134
Bang!

837
01:21:26,718 --> 01:21:29,680
Can you handle that?
Or I got to do everything myself?

838
01:21:29,888 --> 01:21:31,056
I'll handle it.

839
01:21:32,683 --> 01:21:34,393
Bet your ass you will.

840
01:21:34,768 --> 01:21:37,646
Take my car!
That's what I bought it for!

841
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:40,649
Stay here.

842
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:43,443
I need someone competent
guarding this place!

843
01:21:46,029 --> 01:21:47,114
Hurry up!

844
01:22:17,644 --> 01:22:19,938
I wasn't always like this.

845
01:22:21,106 --> 01:22:22,733
I can see that.

846
01:22:32,492 --> 01:22:33,493
I was a musician.

847
01:22:34,745 --> 01:22:36,079
Were you any good?

848
01:22:36,663 --> 01:22:38,081
I was okay.

849
01:22:42,085 --> 01:22:43,837
They shot my hand.

850
01:22:45,923 --> 01:22:47,007
You know...

851
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,595
...it's easier to pull the trigger
than play guitar.

852
01:22:53,805 --> 01:22:56,475
Easier to destroy than to create.

853
01:23:01,313 --> 01:23:03,357
They killed the woman I loved.

854
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:09,071
They ruined my life.

855
01:23:13,242 --> 01:23:15,786
Bucho's men were responsible for it.

856
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:27,881
Why didn't you kill Bucho?

857
01:23:28,549 --> 01:23:29,633
All right...

858
01:23:31,718 --> 01:23:33,178
...here's the plan :

859
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:38,934
You can still get away
without me having to kill him.

860
01:23:40,435 --> 01:23:41,520
You have money.

861
01:23:41,812 --> 01:23:43,230
There is no money.

862
01:23:44,314 --> 01:23:45,232
What?

863
01:23:45,524 --> 01:23:46,608
It's gone.

864
01:23:46,858 --> 01:23:49,236
I had it hidden in the books.

865
01:23:49,695 --> 01:23:50,779
It burned.

866
01:23:51,196 --> 01:23:52,656
Oh, shit.

867
01:23:53,907 --> 01:23:56,451
I have nothing. Nothing.

868
01:23:56,702 --> 01:23:57,869
Oh, great.

869
01:23:58,287 --> 01:23:59,454
Shit!

870
01:24:05,919 --> 01:24:08,046
What about calling your friends?

871
01:24:09,965 --> 01:24:11,133
Campa.

872
01:24:12,759 --> 01:24:13,844
Quino.

873
01:24:15,596 --> 01:24:17,139
They'd destroy the city.

874
01:24:17,347 --> 01:24:20,058
Bucho would still get away.
Forget it.

875
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:35,282
It may not matter to you...

876
01:24:37,075 --> 01:24:40,412
...but he'll follow me everywhere I go
until I'm dead.

877
01:24:41,288 --> 01:24:42,748
It does matter to me.

878
01:25:06,855 --> 01:25:07,940
Campa?

879
01:25:09,483 --> 01:25:10,943
Is Quino there?

880
01:25:13,779 --> 01:25:16,865
How fast can the two of you
get to Santa Cecilia?

881
01:25:17,115 --> 01:25:18,533
I'll be looking for you.

882
01:25:19,284 --> 01:25:20,285
Thanks.

883
01:25:22,454 --> 01:25:23,455
Campa...

884
01:25:24,873 --> 01:25:26,375
...bring your guitars.

885
01:25:59,992 --> 01:26:01,660
Give me the strength...

886
01:26:02,077 --> 01:26:03,745
...to be what I was.

887
01:26:05,831 --> 01:26:07,958
And forgive me for what I am.

888
01:27:33,752 --> 01:27:35,504
Back together again, eh?

889
01:27:39,841 --> 01:27:41,009
Let's play.

890
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:40,981
Cover yourself!

891
01:30:45,736 --> 01:30:46,445
Fuck!

892
01:32:40,058 --> 01:32:42,436
I'm not sure this is the place.

893
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,771
This is the place.

894
01:32:53,405 --> 01:32:54,990
I'm going with you.

895
01:33:26,521 --> 01:33:27,522
<i>Manito.</i>

896
01:33:30,108 --> 01:33:32,110
What are you doing here?

897
01:33:33,862 --> 01:33:36,949
I thought I was looking for
the devil himself.

898
01:33:39,201 --> 01:33:42,704
And all this time
it was my own brother.

899
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:49,002
I didn't know it was you.

900
01:33:49,545 --> 01:33:51,755
I only found out this morning.

901
01:34:00,973 --> 01:34:03,433
I ought to kill you right now.

902
01:34:04,059 --> 01:34:05,644
You disgraced me.

903
01:34:05,894 --> 01:34:08,272
We always knew you were up to no good.

904
01:34:08,605 --> 01:34:10,023
Never thought you'd go this far.

905
01:34:10,274 --> 01:34:12,568
So my little brother comes here...

906
01:34:12,776 --> 01:34:14,027
...to teach me a lesson.

907
01:34:14,278 --> 01:34:16,488
Show me what's right from wrong.

908
01:34:17,489 --> 01:34:19,283
You are a guitar player.

909
01:34:19,575 --> 01:34:23,161
What are you doing killing my men,
ruining my business?!

910
01:34:23,412 --> 01:34:25,247
They killed the woman I loved.

911
01:34:25,497 --> 01:34:27,791
You killed them!
What do you want?

912
01:34:28,292 --> 01:34:30,419
I don't set out to kill innocent people.

913
01:34:30,669 --> 01:34:32,462
You just buy innocent people.

914
01:34:33,005 --> 01:34:34,339
You don't kill them...

915
01:34:34,548 --> 01:34:36,425
...until you have no use for them.

916
01:34:38,552 --> 01:34:40,512
Isn't she the woman you love now?

917
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:42,639
When we take away something...

918
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:44,516
...we replace it.

919
01:34:44,975 --> 01:34:47,102
She's a real piece of work.

920
01:34:47,352 --> 01:34:49,104
Trust me. I know.

921
01:34:49,313 --> 01:34:50,564
Sorry about the bookstore.

922
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:52,858
I always said
it would go up in smoke.

923
01:34:53,525 --> 01:34:57,654
Had I known it was my brother you were
fucking, I'd have acted differently.

924
01:34:57,863 --> 01:34:58,780
Cesar...

925
01:35:00,157 --> 01:35:02,534
...I've learned to read the eyes of men.

926
01:35:02,784 --> 01:35:04,578
What do you read in mine?

927
01:35:05,329 --> 01:35:07,164
Defeat, brother.

928
01:35:07,998 --> 01:35:08,916
Defeat?

929
01:35:09,374 --> 01:35:10,751
Look at you.

930
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,462
You came here to kill me.

931
01:35:13,837 --> 01:35:15,964
Papa wouldn't be proud of you anymore.

932
01:35:16,298 --> 01:35:18,508
You were his little <i>guitarrista.</i>

933
01:35:18,759 --> 01:35:20,177
His little mariachi.

934
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:22,179
And now...

935
01:35:22,429 --> 01:35:24,723
...just a piece of shit like me!

936
01:35:26,433 --> 01:35:27,935
You want to kill me?

937
01:35:28,185 --> 01:35:29,561
Let me tell you something.

938
01:35:29,811 --> 01:35:31,605
You have already killed me!

939
01:35:32,689 --> 01:35:34,608
Put your hands up, <i>manito.</i>

940
01:35:37,152 --> 01:35:38,070
Let's go.

941
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,404
Put them up!

942
01:35:42,491 --> 01:35:43,408
I'm sorry.

943
01:35:44,034 --> 01:35:47,454
But I can't have you acting heroic
when I punish Carolina...

944
01:35:47,746 --> 01:35:48,914
...for betraying me.

945
01:35:49,164 --> 01:35:51,375
But let me do this
and we'll be even.

946
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:53,627
Clean slate.

947
01:35:54,086 --> 01:35:56,129
You killed my men. Okay.

948
01:35:56,338 --> 01:35:57,506
What's done is done.

949
01:35:58,006 --> 01:35:59,675
I'm finished anyway.

950
01:35:59,925 --> 01:36:01,176
But now...

951
01:36:02,177 --> 01:36:03,554
...I kill Carolina.

952
01:36:05,514 --> 01:36:07,558
And you get to watch.

953
01:36:17,317 --> 01:36:18,569
Goodbye, Carolina.

954
01:36:27,744 --> 01:36:29,162
<i>Everyone I've killed...</i>

955
01:36:31,248 --> 01:36:33,125
...was someone's father...

956
01:36:34,418 --> 01:36:36,169
...someone's son...

957
01:36:39,006 --> 01:36:40,757
...someone's brother.

958
01:36:53,979 --> 01:36:54,980
Practice.

959
01:37:12,372 --> 01:37:13,707
Where are you going?

960
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,380
I don't know.

961
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,350
Carolina?

962
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,690
Did I thank you?

963
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:43,820
No.

964
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:48,115
I will.

965
01:38:30,325 --> 01:38:31,575
So...

966
01:38:32,035 --> 01:38:34,410
I want you to thank me right now.

967
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,685
Thank you.

968
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:25,800
Just in case.

969
01:39:27,425 --> 01:39:29,800
It's a long ride to the next town.
