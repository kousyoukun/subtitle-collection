1
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,970
Earth. Birth place of the human race.

2
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,810
A species much like our own.

3
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,670
Capable of great compassion...

4
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,920
and great violence.

5
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,150
For in our quest to protect the humans,

6
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,420
a deeper revelation dawns.

7
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,170
Our worlds have met before.

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,600
Here, here.

9
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,690
Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen

10
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,980
Breaking news at Shanghai.

11
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,380
There's been a major toxic spill on the Shanghai Central District.

12
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,430
- Citizens today...  - For today,

13
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,420
our topic that's a developing story for you, 

14
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,380
we will bring you any new information

15
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,480
as we get it...

16
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,370
- What's the status?  - C-hawks approaching target.

17
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,180
Three minutes until evacuation's complete, sir.

18
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,310
Chinese airspace has been locked and sealed.

19
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,760
One mile radius.

20
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,540
Alright, give NEST team the go.

21
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,300
Black Hawks, clear to land.

22
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,790
Ding-a-ling, come out and get your ice cream.

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,300
Any bad robot out there better get ready for ass-whooping.

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,940
For the last two years, an advanced team of new Autobots

25
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,700
has taken refuge here under my command.

26
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,930
Arcees, get ready to launch.

27
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,640
We're locked and loaded.

28
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,200
Together, we form an alliance with the humans.

29
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,150
A secret, a brave squad of soldiers.

30
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,160
Alright, that's enough.

31
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,260
Time discovered story in this one is toxic spill.

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,460
They had to evac the area for search and rescue.

33
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,120
This makes six enemy contacts in eight months.

34
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,530
We gotta make sure this one does not get out the public axe

35
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,470
so keep it tight.

36
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,360
A classified strike team called NEST.

37
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,310
We hunt for what remains of our Decepticon foes, 

38
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,380
hiding in different countries around the globe.

39
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Rolling Alpha through Echo now.

40
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,910
Alright, Ironhide.

41
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,020
We got Echo's. Vamos.

42
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,460
To the stacks. Two o'clock.

43
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,870
He's here.

44
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,660
I smell him.

45
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,850
It's close. It's heading closer.

46
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,920
Oh, no.

47
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
How are ya?

48
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,020
It's three ripple.

49
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,540
Alright, everybody, be steady.

50
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,820
We're right on top of it.

51
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,800
Ease on fire.

52
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,380
Hand to one. Requesting fire mission now!

53
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,770
Gunships on station. Rolling hot.

54
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,850
We intersected a Decepticon.

55
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,800
Arcee twins, target coming your way.

56
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,780
Watch out!

57
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,150
I screwed that up. I'm okay, I'm alright.

58
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,260
This is kinda bad, man. What's wrong with you?

59
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,660
Three insides white.

60
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,060
Clear and fast.

61
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,770
Damn, I'm good.

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,250
Air support, we need Big Booter delivered and dropped now.

63
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,410
Code 9-A...

64
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,420
Dropping in five, four, three, two, one.

65
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,390
Autobots, I'm in pursuit.

66
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,570
Pull over.

67
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,480
Punk-ass Decepticon, 

68
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,250
any last words?

69
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,570
This is not your planet to rule.

70
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,710
The Fallen shall rise again.

71
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,510
That doesn't sound good.

72
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,290
Not today.

73
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,120
Come on, let's go. All hands on deck.

74
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,840
Frankie, Mojo, out.

75
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,560
Come on, kiddo, 

76
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,970
- we're on a schedule here.  - Slow down, Dad.

77
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,640
Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of me, huh?

78
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,890
Did you rent the room out?

79
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
No, I got other ideas for your room

80
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,370
and it rhymes with home theater.

81
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,510
Look what I found. It's your little baby booties.

82
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,530
Oh, Ma...

83
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,260
Oh my little baby, booty boy, you can't go.

84
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,650
You see this?

85
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,770
That's how you're supposed to react

86
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,920
when you free your loins does not uncool the world to pep for himself, okay?

87
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,310
Yeah, my heart... Please treat it about college, bummer.

88
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,330
You have to come home every holiday, 

89
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,550
not just big ones.

90
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,720
You have to come home for Halloween.

91
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,230
I can't come home for Halloween, Mom.

92
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,160
- We'll come to you.  - No, we're not going anywhere.

93
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,720
- You dress up, we'll be in costumes.  - You... You can't do that.

94
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,710
Would you let the kid breathe, for crying out loud?

95
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,820
Come on, go, pack!

96
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,370
There's no way you're packed

97
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,690
for a month long trip. Come on!

98
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,810
Time-chop. Let's go!

99
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,330
March, young lady.

100
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,520
- Oh, oh, Dad!  - I love you when you call me

101
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,360
young lady, you dirty, old man.

102
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,610
Nah, you ain't seen nothing yet.

103
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,760
- Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!  - What?

104
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,770
I'm watching what you're doing, Dad.

105
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,720
It's not a rap video.

106
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,720
Just like a coach thing, you know.

107
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,510
That's a really creepy move just now, Dad.

108
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,060
Look, you're the hero, uh...

109
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,590
Your mother and me are really, really proud of you.

110
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,090
You're the first Witwiky ever to go to college.

111
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,890
Now I'm crying again. This sucks!

112
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,370
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

113
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,360
Now this is going to be, uh...

114
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,980
You know, hard for her to...

115
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,660
accept that her boy's all grown up, you know.

116
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,440
Going out to handle the world on its own.

117
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,490
- You okay, Pop?  - Yeah.

118
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,690
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

119
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,590
Get the hell of the couch, ya filthy beasts!

120
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,140
Wow.

121
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,330
You see a lot of that in college too.

122
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,990
What are you talking about, Dad?

123
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
There's gonna be a lot of women there.

124
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,620
Yeah, well, I'm the one-woman kind of guy.

125
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,230
Look, Mikaela is the greatest, 

126
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,890
but you gotta give each other room to grow, okay?

127
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,020
You're no different than any other couple your age.

128
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,960
Till we discovered an alien race together.

129
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,100
How long are you gonna be riding that scooter?

130
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,590
Dad, listen, I know what the odds are.

131
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,930
We're the exception, okay?

132
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,060
Wait a second...

133
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,440
- Oh, who could that be?  - Two weeks, it could be Muffy.

134
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,080
Hey, beautiful.

135
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,610
- I'm breaking up with you, Sam.  - Really?

136
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,120
You sure? I hear a lot of conviction.

137
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,540
Well, I am, okay?

138
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,800
So there's no reason for me to come say goodbye to you.

139
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Wow, you almost sounded serious that time.

140
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,360
Guess what?

141
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,620
I made you a long-distance relationship kit.

142
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,580
Yeah, I got you a webcam so we can chat 24/7.

143
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,970
All Witwicky all the time.

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,350
I got you a couple of souveniers

145
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,320
that you bet that cannot be mentioned on cellphone.

146
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,020
Some mixes and candles and stuff...

147
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,430
Sounds cute, I can't wait.

148
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,430
Oh, hey!

149
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,250
You want the infamous D-Day shirt?

150
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,700
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

151
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,020
Yeah, of course I kept it, Mikaela.

152
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,180
It's like my Superbowl jersey. I bled in this thing.

153
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,780
Wow, you're pretty confident, huh?

154
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,020
No, it's not that.

155
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,500
It's just that my low self-esteem's at an all-time high.

156
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,480
Do you think your little box of souveniers

157
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,960
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

158
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,320
You really should come with me, 

159
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,130
they got cheap apartments in campus.

160
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,060
Well, that's not gonna happen

161
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,260
until I get my man child father rushed out of prison, 

162
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,450
back on his feet.

163
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,680
I heard that.

164
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,960
Where did you put the clutch covers?

165
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,210
Next to the cam shafts.

166
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,600
I love it when you say cam shafts. Whisper it to me.

167
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,770
Cam shafts.

168
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,310
God, I hate you.

169
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,330
It's my Witwicky charm.

170
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,620
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

171
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,280
I guess we're not breaking up.

172
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,810
I'll be over in 20.

173
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,740
Mikaela...

174
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,540
I think this little bit Cube got stuck on my shirt.

175
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,760
Sam?

176
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,160
Oh God! It's a fire!

177
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,490
Dad, we got a fire!

178
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,800
Fire!

179
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,830
Ron, did you know it was gonna be

180
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,850
- this hard?  - C-Can you just stop?

181
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,480
- Yeah, okay, I'll stop.  - Just wait...

182
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,000
- You carry this shit.  - I'll... I'll...

183
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,170
- Wow!  - You know what?

184
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,800
I don't wanna go anywhere with you.

185
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,810
I don't wanna go to France with you.

186
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,530
I don't wanna go around the corner with you.

187
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,880
- Alright, fine.  - I'm just going back inside.

188
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,170
I'll call you from Paris.

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,440
What is all the racket?

190
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,470
- Whoa.  - Sam?

191
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,530
- Whoa, whoa.  - Dad...

192
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,760
- What was that?  - It's the whole kitchen!

193
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,290
Help me... Oh my...

194
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,680
Bumblebee!

195
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,670
Oh, jeez!

196
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,730
Phone 9-1-1.

197
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,120
Bumblebee! Get in the garage.

198
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,740
What the frick is happening?

199
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,040
What happened to restraint, man?

200
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,860
Just go in the garage, quietly please?

201
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,050
Holy mother!

202
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,080
Oh, my God!

203
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,710
I... In the garage, now!

204
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,010
Power's out! Get the cops out!

205
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,970
Come on, you guys. What are you waiting for?

206
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,690
My house is on fire!

207
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,890
- What happened?  - Come here.

208
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,040
Listen, I need you to take the Cube sliver.

209
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
Put it in your purse, right now.

210
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,050
- Sam Witwicky...  - Yes, Mom.

211
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,300
- A word with you.  - Yeah.

212
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,130
- Hi, Mikaela.  - Hi.

213
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,250
- I have a bald spot.  - Oh.

214
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,720
- An old furnace, I think.  - Become a waffle iron.

215
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,040
When you go, he goes.

216
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,610
I cannot live with this psychotic alien in my garage.

217
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,630
Judy, shh.

218
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,320
National security.

219
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,610
Look, if we stay quiet, they're gonna take care of everything.

220
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,940
Just consider this the official start of a remodel, okay?

221
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,520
Fine. If the government's paying, I want a pool...

222
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,740
- and a hot tub.  - Fine. Okay.

223
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,490
And I'm gonna skinny-dip and you can't say shit about it!

224
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,060
Yeah, you know you're a tool.

225
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,560
- He's having voice problems.  - He's playing it up.

226
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,220
Bee, I want to talk to you about the college thing, okay?

227
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,900
I'm so excited!

228
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,910
Hey.

229
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,580
I'm not taking you with me.

230
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,400
I wanna wait outside, okay?

231
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,300
I wanted to tell you about this earlier.

232
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,910
It's just that... You know, 

233
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,700
Here's the thing.

234
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,160
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

235
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,950
I know, and if it was up to me, I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

236
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
Look, you're an Autobot.

237
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,050
You shouldn't be living in my dad's garage.

238
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,630
I mean, you're suffocating in here.

239
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,430
You deserve better than this.

240
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,420
This is hard enough, man, 

241
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,280
don't make it harder. Can you just look at me, please?

242
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,890
Come on, big guy.

243
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,660
Look, the guardian thing is done, okay? You did your job.

244
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,070
Look, I'm safe now.

245
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,620
You need to go be with Optimus Prime and the others.

246
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,120
I just want to be normal, Bee.

247
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,570
That's why I'm going to college.

248
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,640
I can't do that with you.

249
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,490
It's not the last time I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.

250
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,680
Come on, don't do that. Bee. You're killing me, Bee.

251
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,390
But you'll always be my first car.

252
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,300
Love you, Bee.

253
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,830
Between state farm and the taxpayers, we're all taken care of.

254
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,860
- You got dirt all over you.  - Stop, stop.

255
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,450
- What?  - It's...I'm okay.

256
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,340
Well, look.

257
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,330
So you think you can make it

258
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,170
through those East Coast winners without me?

259
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,940
You're like the best thing that ever happened to me.

260
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,490
And?

261
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,410
- And I'll do anything for you.  - And?

262
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,330
- I think Sam's about to say the L word.  - Let's go, kiddo.

263
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,860
Nice timing, Dad.

264
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,170
I... adore you.

265
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,290
That's not the word that I wanna hear really now.

266
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,940
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,930
It's the same word as the other word.

268
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,980
- It's not the same word.  - Look, if I said the other word now, 

269
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,390
you forced me to say won't mean anything.

270
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,370
Plus, you haven't said it either.

271
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,950
So don't get mad at me for not saying it.

272
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,640
Yeah, but I haven't said it

273
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,440
because guys always run when you say it first.

274
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,490
Yeah, well, so do girls.

275
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,270
Especially, girls like you with options.

276
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,360
So this is all part of your elaborate plan

277
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,530
to keep me interested?

278
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,080
Can be.

279
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,290
Ain't those working?

280
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,130
Have a kiss.

281
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,290
We'll make it work, I promise.

282
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,900
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

283
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,540
Retrieve it.

284
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,020
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

285
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,760
Excuse me, excuse me.

286
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,430
Hello. What a night. Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

287
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,460
Yes, oh, yeah. Look here. Come on, let me call right here.

288
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,600
Time to get my sexy on.

289
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,430
Green, I know,

290
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,930
Green is mine, I call green

291
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,860
Be my body

292
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,060
- I got the green.  - That hurt, man.

293
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,850
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass kicking.

294
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,630
Director Galloway, what an honor.

295
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,450
Let me show you around

296
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,130
but you gotta be in the classified access list.

297
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,820
I am now.

298
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,270
Presidential order, Major.

299
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,510
I got a message for your classified space buddies.

300
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,310
You guys made a mess at Shanghai.

301
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,780
Alright, so this is where we communicate with the JCS.

302
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,520
And this area serves as the Autobots' hangar.

303
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,700
Secured line to JCS is up, Major.

304
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,630
Secured line to the Pentagon now.

305
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,990
Saw the Shanghai op. It was a rough day.

306
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,820
Yes, sir.

307
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,060
We have intel that I believe warns an immediate debrief.

308
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,510
Now with your permission, I can't let you see him

309
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,810
but I would like you to hear from the leader of the Autobots.

310
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,790
Proceed.

311
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,490
You gotta wonder.

312
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,840
God made us in his image. Who made him?

313
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,640
General, our alliance has countermanded 6 Decepticon incursions this year.

314
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,240
Each on a different continent.

315
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,170
They're clearly searching around the world for something.

316
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,600
But last night's encounter came with a warning:

317
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,510
The Fallen shall rise again.

318
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,710
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

319
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,710
Origin: Unknown.

320
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,520
They only recorded

321
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,020
history of our race was contained within the All-Spark, 

322
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,950
lost with its destruction.

323
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,970
Excuse me!

324
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,170
If this so-called "All-Spark", now destroyed, 

325
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,190
why hasn't the enemy left the planet

326
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,550
like you thought they would?

327
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,980
Director Galloway, our national security advisor

328
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,860
the President just appointed him liasion.

329
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,270
- It's too, uh...  - Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

330
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,560
Forgive the interruption, General. Excuse me, coming through.

331
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,530
Excuse me, excuse me...

332
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,410
After all the damage in Shanghai, 

333
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,750
the President is, uh...

334
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,080
hard-pressed to say the job's getting done.

335
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:34,010
Now under the classified Alien Autobot Cooperation Act, 

336
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,170
you are agreeing to share your intel with us, 

337
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,480
but not your advancements in weaponry.

338
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,140
We've witnessed your human capacity for war.

339
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,010
It would absolutely bring more harm than good.

340
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,090
But who are you to judge what's best for us?

341
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,260
With all due respect, we've been fighting side-by-side

342
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,790
in the field for two years.

343
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,950
We've shared blood, sweat and precious metal together.

344
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,010
Soldier, you're paid to shoot; not talk.

345
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,300
Don't tell me.

346
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,490
And the, uh...

347
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,060
- The newest members of your team...  - Easy...

348
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,740
I understand they arrived here after you sent a message into space.

349
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,760
An open invitation to come to Earth, 

350
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,460
embedded by no one at the White House.

351
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,630
Let me stop you right there, Mr. Galloway.

352
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,180
It was bedded right here.

353
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,240
And in my experience, the judgement of both Major Lennox and his team, 

354
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,300
has always been above reproach.

355
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,150
Well be that as it may, General, it is the position of the President

356
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,220
that when our national security is at stake, 

357
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
no one is above reproach.

358
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,020
Now, what do we know so far?

359
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,630
We know that the enemy leader, 

360
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,420
classified NBE-1, AKA Megatron, 

361
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,130
is resting in peace

362
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,170
at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss, 

363
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,380
surrounded by societs detection nets

364
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,790
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

365
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,890
We also know that

366
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,230
the only remaining piece of your alien All-Spark

367
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,310
is locked in an electromagnetic vault, 

368
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,890
here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world.

369
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,830
And since no one...

370
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,080
can seem to tell me what the enemy is now after, 

371
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,270
well, there...there's only one clear conclusion:

372
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,520
You.The Autobots.

373
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,450
They're here to hunt you.

374
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,410
What's there to hunt for on Earth besides that?

375
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,060
"The Fallen... shall rise again"?

376
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,880
Sounds to me like something's coming.

377
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,630
So let me ask if we ultimately conclude

378
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,510
that our national security is best served

379
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,470
by denying you further asylum on our planet, 

380
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,030
will you leave peacefully?

381
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,840
Freedom is your right.

382
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,050
If you make that request, we will honor it.

383
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,530
But before your president decides, please ask him this.

384
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,530
What if we leave and you're wrong?

385
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,210
That's a good question.

386
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,300
Oh, my God, 

387
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,640
just look at this place!

388
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,980
I feel smarter already.

389
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,170
Ron, can you smell it?

390
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,760
Yes, smells like $40, 000 a year.

391
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,970
Okay, cheapo.

392
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,360
Go ahead, we'll, uh... We'll get your stuff.

393
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,730
Just go ahead and check out your room.

394
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,840
- Hey.  - Hey.

395
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,870
You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo.

396
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,570
Hey.

397
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,740
Uh, sorry, I already set up the crib. Do you want this side or that side?

398
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,360
- That side.  - I already chose that side.

399
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,020
You know what this is? This is the awkward moment.

400
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,700
Yeah, so you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.

401
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,820
I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy, 

402
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,550
balanced and medicated enough for another coral space.

403
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,000
Good personal hygiene won't stab me in my sleep.

404
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,160
Good criminal record won't steal anything.

405
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,650
- Including girlfriends.  - Especially girlfriends.

406
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,700
- You got a girlfriend?  - I do.

407
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,040
- You?  - No, not a chance.

408
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,200
You're a techie?

409
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,070
Sweet.

410
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,930
- Sharsky, Fassbiner, where we at?  - Server's almost online, Leo.

411
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,220
It works up and running.

412
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,600
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.

413
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,160
- That's Sharsky, that's Spastik  - Hey, dude.

414
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,640
my I.T. gurus.

415
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,840
Welcome to my empire, bro. TheRealEffinDeal.com.

416
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,940
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.

417
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,650
- No, I haven't.  - Well, that sucks.

418
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,440
- What is all this for?  - See, look...

419
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,190
Call me gross, I wanna be a baby billionaire.

420
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,370
Kitten calendars.

421
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,740
It's where it started. Look at me now.

422
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,180
Got our dreams, bro.

423
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,130
Leo, we got some bad news in Shanghai.

424
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,090
Post it, baby. Go, go, go! FTJ, FTJ!

425
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,930
- It's clean.  - What's FTJ?

426
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,520
- Fuel the Jet, Fuel the Jet.  - FTJ, FTJ.

427
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,820
- This is it. Did you see that?  - Wow. Okay, this half of Shanghai

428
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,290
gets rigged when China says gas leak.

429
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,630
Don't believe the hype, bro.

430
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,020
Just like the alien robots in LA two years ago that everyone covered up.

431
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,370
Yeah, I saw these robots and they did this, like, 

432
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,760
firing thing and they came down and twisted this woman

433
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,120
- and she was like...  - Looks fake to me.

434
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,190
Dude, it's not fake. The Internet's pure true.

435
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,240
- Neither does it lie.  - It looks fake.

436
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,320
No, man, I've seen them. They are like these, uh, robots...

437
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,030
Look, look, look, it's fake. Anybody can do on any computer, okay?

438
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,670
And I wasn't, uh... there.

439
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,580
So I can't comment or speculate.

440
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,550
- Oh, no.  - "Comment and speculate"?

441
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,900
We're supposed to go habitate?

442
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,910
No, listen, okay. Don't be sucking the sack, bro.

443
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,640
- Whose sack?  - Look, the ball sack.

444
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,890
- Dude, what kind of tool are you?  - Mainstream media sack.

445
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,280
They're lying to us, alright.

446
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,430
- It's aliens, man.  - Okay, okay.

447
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,620
Follow me.

448
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,300
Uh-oh. Uh, Leo. Bad news, we just got scooped.

449
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,710
The video's already up on GeoBoard.

450
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,160
Damn... No!

451
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,720
Robo-Warrior has a main competition, our conspiracy step.

452
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,660
Effing was my effing idea. He stole it.

453
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,200
He's been looking to my site and thieving hits for ever!

454
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,500
By the way, I read your file.

455
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,060
I'll pour, you'll pour... We're gonna fix that, alright?

456
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,230
You work for me, now.

457
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,710
I work for you now?

458
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,410
That's incredible. It's first day of college, 

459
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,480
I got a career, a dinky internet firm, 

460
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,570
with a boss who is made up of just pure champion stuff.

461
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,610
You're mocking my life's work, Samuel? Huh?

462
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,080
That's your one warning patrolling, dude.

463
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,120
Don't make me that fast.... 'cause I'll do it.

464
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,560
Hey alright, listen. It's getting a little intense in my room.

465
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,690
- Can I switch now?  - Oh, sad face, 3-12.

466
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,570
No switching, no treating. Let's turn that upside-down, okay?

467
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,330
- Oh, here we go.  - Hey, hi.

468
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,450
It's just like Hogwarts. Hi!

469
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,280
Is this co-ed? This is a co-ed dorm.

470
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,770
Do you guys want to meet my roommates?

471
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,320
- Yeah.  - 'Cause they're real swell guys.

472
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,430
- Here is Leo.  - We're the Witwicky.

473
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,890
- I'm Leo.  - I'm Judy.

474
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,790
Hey, you have a great son. You really do.

475
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,280
Oh, well aren't you the sweetest thing?

476
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,560
He's real sweet, Ma.

477
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,730
What is that in your hand, by the way?

478
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,470
Oh, I got this at the bake sale for the environment

479
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,890
that those boys were having.

480
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,380
You know, you don't often see white boys

481
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,770
with the dreadlocks.

482
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,980
- Mom.  - Yeah, it's a 100 percent pure Hawaiian

483
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,410
- green for the environment.  - Jud... Can you please drop it?

484
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,820
Yeah, then they baked it with reefer in it.

485
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,240
- No, it's canna... Hey!  - Please give me.

486
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,200
Hey! It's my cheap day. I can eat whatever I want.

487
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,290
Please God, I'm gonna freak out. Please do something right now, Dad.

488
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,200
- Please do something right now.  - Okay, okay.

489
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,740
Out of my way, you wild hair!

490
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,660
I can eat all the freaking brownies I want!

491
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,320
Sorry, fellas.

492
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,110
I'm sorry and you're welcome.

493
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,970
We call it the Hot Freshmen 55.

494
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,000
Sharsky hacked campus house and stacked the dorm with pretty beddies.

495
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,800
Oh, my God. It's her.

496
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,820
She's coming. She sees me, she sees me.

497
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,740
She's tight for me on one on my to-do list.

498
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,470
Do not bird-dog my credit, you hear me?

499
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,010
Pretty girls.

500
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,040
Hey, you. My son lives in this dorm.

501
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,160
You should go make friends with him, 

502
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,430
- he's bad.  - Bless she ain't my mama.

503
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,690
And he recently had his cherry popped.

504
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,550
He didn't know I was in the house.

505
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,870
- I heard it all.  - Hey, hey, hey.

506
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,770
There he is!

507
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,700
Oh, will you give him my closet?

508
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,220
Hey, and his car is a talking robot!

509
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,370
No, like a... like a GPS, All-Star.

510
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,330
- Okay.  - All-Star.

511
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,380
Frisbee. Whoo!

512
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,070
No, Dad.

513
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,000
Dad, you're just gonna let her run around school.

514
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,640
- Are you alright?  - Whoa.

515
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,550
Give me.

516
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,290
Are you crazy?

517
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,930
Judy, Judy. Just... Just put it. Just put it.

518
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,430
You gotta control your mother.

519
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,430
I wasn't doing this.

520
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Hey, Professor. I'd do anything for an A.

521
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,070
Alright, Grace...

522
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,660
Looks like we got some snacks in the car. Let's go.

523
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,010
- Whoo!  - Did you gt the booties?

524
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,370
Yes, Dad, I got the booties!

525
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,030
- Alright, alright.  - Oh my God, I'm upside-down!

526
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,750
Black Light in X-Trait. This is Black Light in Tango.

527
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,840
Breach in B-14.

528
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,460
Go, go, go, go, go!

529
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,890
The Shard is gone.

530
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,350
Take him down!

531
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,200
- Open fire.  - Get down!

532
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,180
The first frat party's the game change of boys, 

533
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,680
we're hunting in the wild now, so get your game faces on.

534
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,910
I can't stay long, I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

535
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,690
- That's so cool.  - No, it's not.

536
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,320
While he's making up with his MacBook, 

537
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,510
I'm gonna be dating my spitzy, freaky freak on.

538
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,370
- Let's roll.  - She's hot.

539
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,410
We're, uh... We're hunting.

540
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,730
- See you, darling.  - Bye, Dad.

541
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,700
Okay.

542
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,740
This is our first live chat date. Never done it before.

543
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,690
I'm kind of nervous.

544
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,880
- Are you okay?  - No, uh...

545
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,370
I was getting a napkin for my drink.

546
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,600
Thanks. Cheers!

547
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,600
- You're Sam, right?  - Yeah.

548
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,270
I wanna dance.

549
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,630
Like... Like dancing?

550
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,580
Like a pairing? Like a duo, like a coupling?

551
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,050
'Cause I'm in a permanently, semi...

552
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,140
- I'm in a relationship, kind of.  - Oh, relax.

553
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,780
I just want to have some fun.

554
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,210
Oh, just some fun? Oh yeah, okay.

555
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,260
Let's play some checkers. You can sit over there, and, uh...

556
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,050
- Oh my God.  - So how about tonight, 

557
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,980
you pretend I'm your girlfriend and I pretend that you're my boyfriend.

558
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,390
Hey! Who broke the frickin' yellow Camaro?

559
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,360
Huh? There's a car on the run.

560
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,350
What are you doing?

561
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,140
Houston, we have a problem.

562
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,580
- What is it?  -  Freshman!

563
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,150
- Yeah.  - Is that your car on our bushes?

564
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,560
No, there's a friend of mine who just went to a...

565
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,020
who went to get you a tighter shirt.

566
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,460
There isn't a tighter shirt. We checked.

567
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,610
Now how about I park my foot in your ass?

568
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,610
What size shoe do you wear?

569
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,340
- Yeah, oh, you ain't...  - Hold on, hold... Whoa!

570
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,400
Are you... Are you trying?

571
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:28,970
I'm gonna back it up right now.

572
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,180
Get it out of here.

573
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,890
You have a ride?

574
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,090
Bro, why you holding onto us?

575
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,360
I've only known you 17 hours.

576
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,740
This is gonna really change our lives.

577
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,660
You have no idea.

578
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,860
I love Camaros.

579
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,270
- I can't do this right now, okay?  - Don't be a wimp.

580
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,170
Oh, God.

581
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,960
- My first car was my Dad's money 2Z-28.  - Yeah?

582
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,070
Fuel-injected.

583
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,870
The roar of the engine. It just, tickles me.

584
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,990
We shouldn't, uh, stare... I mean, share stories...

585
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,490
to each other at all.

586
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,270
What're you becoming, Sam? Just one ride...

587
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,800
Don't. Don't.

588
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,880
Is your radio broke?

589
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,430
- No, my car's iteration is.  - We're not cheating.

590
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,870
Not yet.

591
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,600
Something wrong here?

592
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,050
Ow! Oh, God! You okay?

593
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,720
I really don't know what to tell you, 

594
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,110
this car... It just has a lot of problems.

595
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,250
A lot of prob...

596
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,730
Oh, God. Oh, it's in my mouth. Oh...

597
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,850
Are you okay?

598
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,280
I got wetnaps. I got wetnaps for your face.

599
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,240
Hold on.

600
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,670
I'm so sorry!

601
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,320
What are you doing?

602
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,590
You won't give me a day, huh?

603
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,120
- You won't give me one day in college.  - I'm sorry, Sam.

604
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,580
But the last fragment of the All-Spark was stolen.

605
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,170
Like what? Like Decepticon-stolen?

606
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,180
We placed it under human protection at your government's request.

607
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,120
But I'm here for your help, Sam.

608
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,270
Because your leaders believed we brought vengeance upon your planet.

609
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,540
Perhaps, they are right.

610
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,990
That is why they must be reminded by another human

611
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,800
of the trust we share.

612
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,870
- This isn't my war.  - Not yet.

613
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,040
But I fear it soon will be.

614
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,050
Your world must not share the same fate as Cybertron.

615
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,690
Whole generations lost.

616
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,370
I know and I... I want to help you. I do.

617
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,860
But I'm not some alien ambassador.

618
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,560
You know, I'm a normal kid with normal problems.

619
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,040
I am where I'm supposed to be.

620
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,500
I'm sorry, I...

621
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,810
I really am.

622
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,830
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing.

623
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,410
You're Optimus Prime. You don't need me.

624
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,620
We do... more than you know.

625
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,350
New contact, bearing 214 and possible hostile

626
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,520
confirmed for Project Beat Six drop-point.

627
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,370
- What you got?  - Sue, pull five contacts.

628
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,300
5,000 feet. Diving fast.

629
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,640
There's something. They dive that deep, that fast.

630
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,760
- Man battle stations.  - Sealer One, man battle stations.

631
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,780
Hell, not pull the rudder or head two-thirds.

632
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,750
Dive, Cookie.

633
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,600
The NEST protecting NBE-1 are screening, sir.

634
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,730
That is 9,300 fathoms down.

635
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,240
- And no confirmed DSRVs on sight?  - None, sir.

636
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,120
Then, people, we've got a problem.

637
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,990
Need parts.

638
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,450
Kill such little one.

639
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,660
Sea shard, make Energon.

640
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,850
Prime sonar now holds six contacts and they're coming up fast.

641
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,080
Man collisional arm...

642
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,760
...are 500 feet.

643
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,530
Let's get out of here.

644
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,580
Angel Six, 

645
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,280
we got six hostiles coming down.

646
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,000
- Collision imminent. Portside...  - 100 feet.

647
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,470
Brace for impact.

648
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Starscream, I'm home.

649
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,700
Behold, Megatron, I was so relieved

650
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,020
to hear of your... resurrection.

651
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,960
You left me to die, you pathetic insect!

652
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,410
Only to help spawn our new army, 

653
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,520
the Fallen decreased it, after all, in your absence, 

654
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,970
someone had to take command.

655
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:55,890
You...

656
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,500
are so disappointing.

657
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,260
Even in death, there's no command but mine.

658
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,730
My master, I failed you on Earth.

659
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,300
The All-Spark is destroyed, 

660
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,610
and without it, our race will perish.

661
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,240
You have much to learn, my disciple.

662
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,870
The Cube is merely a vessel.

663
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,620
It's power, it's knowledge can never be destroyed.

664
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,660
It can only transform.

665
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,020
- How is that possible?  - It has been absorbed

666
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,950
by the human child.

667
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:43,110
The key to saving our race now lies within his mind.

668
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,860
Well then, let me strip the very flesh from his body.

669
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,840
And you will, my apprentice.

670
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,860
In time. For millenia, I have dreamed of my return

671
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,760
to that wretched planet, where I too was once betrayed, 

672
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:02,720
by the Primes I call my brothers.

673
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:10,250
Only a Prime can defeat me, and now only one remains.

674
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,960
Optimus. He protects the boy.

675
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,400
Then the boy will lead us to him

676
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,930
- and revenge will be ours.  - Yes.

677
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,940
The boy will not escape us. We have him in our sights.

678
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,210
Without more Energon, hatchlings will keep dying.

679
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,310
Space, time, gravity.

680
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,040
- Thank you.  - Finish that for me.

681
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,810
We're going on a journey together, you and I, today.

682
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,690
All you, eager nubile young minds on the very cusp of adulthood.

683
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,310
And I shall be your consort, your guide, 

684
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,760
your chaperone, into the heart of darkness.

685
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,100
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

686
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,520
For what do we know about the stars?

687
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,600
Virgo... the virgin.

688
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,370
Orion, the great hunter.

689
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,560
These are no mere twinkling diamonds

690
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,050
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

691
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,400
No, they are diamond, filled with a throbbing, 

692
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,220
savage and hemped-up energy.

693
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,900
Behold the work of Albert Einstein, 

694
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,620
a professor once, like moi, 

695
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
- energy, in its mass temp...  - What are you doing?

696
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Put your hand down, put your hand down.

697
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,480
Young man, there are no questions

698
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,580
until I've reached the climax of my lecture.

699
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,920
I've just finished your book. There's only one problem.

700
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:49,950
Einstein's wrong.

701
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,540
Energy doesn't go mass times velocity light square

702
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,850
in this dimension. What about the other 17

703
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,310
while we're impossible to give 17?

704
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:58,860
A clear example:

705
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,550
Come on, guys, I can't be the only one in class...

706
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,220
Young man, I will not be punked in front of the dean.

707
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,650
No, this is my universe here. Do you understand?

708
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,310
I am the Alpha and the Omega.

709
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,680
- Get out of my class.  - Yes, sir.

710
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,300
Any one else care to have some sort of mental breakdown?

711
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,840
Hi, Bones. Hi!

712
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,730
Hi! Oh yes, that's a good boy.

713
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,940
Oh, what a good boy, you are.

714
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,880
Hey, Bones.

715
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,730
You hungry?

716
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:14,880
Here you go.

717
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,300
- Yes, Samuel.  - Hello? Mikaela.

718
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,170
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up on our first web chat date.

719
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,460
Something just happened to me, okay?

720
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,470
- Wait, you finally hit puberty?  - No, no, no, 

721
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,490
Stop laughing. This is serious.

722
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,400
Okay, remember I was telling you about

723
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,420
my great-great-grandfather, Archibald Witwicky?

724
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,260
Do you remember?

725
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,600
Watch where you're supposed to go!

726
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,990
Okay, remember I was telling you about, okay...

727
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,880
Can you stop... Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

728
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,930
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather went to this Arctic mission, right?

729
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,790
And he saw Megatron, Megatron zapped him

730
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,700
and he started seeing these crazy symbols, okay.

731
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,150
Well, now I'm seeing them too. Excuse me.

732
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,790
I just wrote a 903-page Astronomy book at 32.6 seconds

733
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,290
and had a meltdown in the middle of my class.

734
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,360
I am seeing symbols ever since I...

735
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,550
- Since what?  - Ever since I touched the Cube sliver.

736
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,650
Do you have it?

737
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,330
No, how about it's in the shop safe? It's fine.

738
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,500
Mi... Mikaela, do not touch it, okay? Don't touch it.

739
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,550
I'm not gonna touch it, 

740
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,370
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away, no one knows where it is.

741
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:13,910
But I do.

742
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,690
You're hot, but you're ain't too bright.

743
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,430
There we go.

744
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,620
Oh, big son of a bitch!

745
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,330
What are you looking at, Slobberpuss?

746
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,670
Ah, what the...

747
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,380
This is a fricking House of Horrors.

748
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Hold on.

749
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,040
Is that the best you got, huh?

750
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,390
Is that the best you can do?

751
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,740
What are you doing here, you little freak?

752
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,720
Ow, that's my eye, you crazy bitch!

753
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,210
You gotta talk now?

754
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,430
I... I seek knowledge of the Cube. The Fallen demands me.

755
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,240
What knowledge?

756
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,250
You got the shot, I need the shot, give me the shot, I need the shot.

757
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,130
Give me the shot, they're gonna whack me, 

758
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,450
I'm gonna be dead without that shot.

759
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,590
Easy Warrior Goddess, I'm just a little salvage scrap drone.

760
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,480
Then I'm your worst nightmare.

761
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,670
Hey, hey!

762
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,440
- What the hell was that?  - I'll tell you later, 

763
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,010
just not on open phone line, okay?

764
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,080
I'm gonna get on a plane right now. I'll be there later this afternoon.

765
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,260
Just be careful, Sam.

766
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,310
And have any stranger giving you anything suspicious to carry on today?

767
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,770
Yeah, a large box!

768
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,510
- No.  - Good.

769
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,790
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots.

770
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,570
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion. Vicinity eastern United States, sir.

771
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,510
- Hansvin, how many?  - Unclear, sir.

772
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,390
Well, get clear.

773
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,890
Autobots on the move. Splitting them into two teams, sir.

774
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,570
Unarching their course, somewhere heading to New York and Philadelphia.

775
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:23,180
Full weapons deployment. Wheels up in 20 minutes!

776
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,180
Flight Chairman throughout West Beverly Hills.

777
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,010
M'amor (my lover), can I interest you in Mayteam Zookeeper's Special?

778
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,430
Extra large supertees with every known animal as a topping.

779
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,460
Basic lengths. Only 18 inches of meat.

780
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,610
Oh, so you're a vegetarian. Alright, it's cool. I am too.

781
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,250
Is Sam home?

782
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,530
Sam... I think he died but, why don't we check?

783
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,490
- Here we are.  - Hey.

784
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,190
Have you had a song stuck in yours?

785
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,600
It's like the worst song ever, but you can't help

786
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,210
whistle it or sing it. It's like, repeats itself, 

787
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,410
repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself, 

788
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,440
repeats itself... Kitten calendar, kitten calendar, 

789
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:04,500
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,  - Dude, 

790
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:05,730
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,  - What the F?

791
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,850
I know you're freaking out. Don't freak out, don't freak out.

792
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,770
Easy fix. Puzzle, code, in my head. Now it's on the walls.

793
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:11,550
Everything is good.

794
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,470
This is the part that...

795
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,410
Okay, what were you saying?

796
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,850
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this. Let's go.

797
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,410
- Get out.  - What?

798
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,550
Wait, wait, wait. C-Can I just sit and watch?

799
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,110
I-I'll eat my pizza quietly.

800
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,680
Sam, I knew there were something special about you.

801
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,320
Really?

802
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,370
And I know you know what happens

803
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,680
when two people in the room get together...

804
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:42,460
they're genuinely amazing... in bed.

805
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,210
- Thank you.  - No problem.

806
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,060
Alright, listen, hold on. Boundaries. Flight on the plane.

807
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,400
Okay, I'm very ticklish.

808
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,030
- You have the need, Sam. Relax!  - Why?

809
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,390
Oh, jeez!

810
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,590
Uh, what about this economy? It's crazy, isn't it?

811
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,820
- You are very aggressive.  - Just relax.

812
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,270
You want some jerky meatloaf?

813
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,030
Sam?

814
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,780
Mikaela.

815
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,290
Is that your girlfriend?

816
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,570
Ex.

817
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:26,500
Mikaela, wait... I can explain every...

818
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,580
Sam, your bed-buddy, Alice.

819
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,120
What...

820
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,220
- It's coming!  - This is an alien robot.

821
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,840
- You gotta move. Just run.  - They're real?

822
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,310
Oh my God, I can't believe I once had sex with her in my dream.

823
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,950
I can tell that you really missed me a lot, Sam.

824
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,040
Look, it's not my fault, okay?

825
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,200
Listen, listen. I'm a victim.

826
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,550
Oh, you were a victim? Of what?

827
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,670
- Of what? A little 80-pound girl...  - Of...Of...

828
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,430
It's like getting humped in the neck by a mountain ox.

829
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,830
You didn't have to put your tongue in her mouth.

830
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,830
- I didn't.  - You did.

831
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,290
Look, you ever had your stomach tounged by a mountain ox with a 5-foot tong?

832
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,960
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela.

833
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,650
And it smelled like... like diesel. Like a diesel he dinged to it.

834
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,140
You're such a little girl.

835
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,220
You have ten seconds of silence, right now.

836
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,490
I'm not talking to you for ten seconds.

837
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,290
No, you can't give me the silence. You know what?

838
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,920
I'm not talking to you for ten seconds. You have three seconds left.

839
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,320
You know, what? You can give me the silence you want, 

840
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,050
all you want but you can't give me the talking...

841
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,200
W-What were you gonna say?

842
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,700
I hope you had a lot of fun because this...

843
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,940
This is over!

844
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,220
Did she finally led you to orbits?

845
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,830
You threw a broom? She did it, she went in it?

846
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,110
...gestating in that inside of you. You're going right now, bro.

847
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,740
You need to vomit right now. Yak it, yak it.

848
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,840
- Right now!  - Who are you?

849
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,170
I am the only one who everybody can spit, okay?

850
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,030
I'm the key to this.

851
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,780
Aliens; they want me because of my site.

852
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:25,950
Run!

853
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,530
Mikaela!

854
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,500
Watch out. We get in.

855
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,630
It's a bomb!

856
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,810
We gotta get that box.

857
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,330
This way.

858
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,530
Hey, let me out, let me out!

859
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,470
Oh my God, you know to hot-wire a car?

860
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,250
- That's so hot.  - Drive, drive, drive.

861
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,490
She went there, she went there!

862
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,080
W-wait!

863
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,260
They can....

864
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,620
Cut, cut, cut.

865
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,590
Oh God!

866
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,870
Kiss this, bitch.

867
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,700
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive.

868
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,660
Okay, so what else's going right now, alright, 

869
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,200
did you guys just mess with the minor details?

870
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,830
Thing you saw back there. That was a little babe.

871
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,760
Whoa! Oh my God! Oh my God!

872
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:13,900
Sam!

873
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,600
- Sam!  - Hold on!

874
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,800
Hold on.

875
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,290
Sam!

876
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,730
I don't want to die! We're going to die! Oh my God!

877
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,720
Oh, Jesus! Oh, jeez!

878
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,080
Come here, boy.

879
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,700
Closer.

880
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:11,620
Okay.

881
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,260
- You remember me, don't you?  - I did what you said, okay?

882
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,970
- Just don't hurt us.  - Shut up!

883
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,770
Sam!

884
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,700
It feels good to grab your first.

885
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,940
I am going to kill you, slowly, painfully.

886
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:44,540
But first, we have some delicate work to do.

887
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,370
I could snap your ribs off.

888
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:54,540
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

889
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,640
Sick of your face now.

890
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,630
Go that way.

891
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,080
A wormy that's crabby...

892
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:46,410
- Oh, there they are.  - That's what I'm seeing in my head.

893
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,400
These symbols can lead us to the Energon source.

894
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,940
We must tear the brain!()

895
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:58,280
Brain? What does he mean by my brain?

896
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,400
Well, you have something on your mind.

897
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,780
- Something I need.  - Hold on. I know you're pissed.

898
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,480
I know you're pissed.

899
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,410
Because I tried to kill you and it's completely understandable.

900
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,990
Somebody tried to kill me, I'd be upset too.

901
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,520
I think that we have an opportunity here

902
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,570
to start a new and... and develop our relationship, 

903
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,160
and... and, see where it leads us, okay?

904
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,400
So you just call doctor inspection, 

905
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,080
I'll let you talk in five seconds.

906
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,040
W-Wait...

907
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,600
Go, go.

908
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,760
Go, go, go.

909
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,730
Sam!

910
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,110
Go, go, go, go!

911
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,180
Here he comes!

912
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,620
Hide, Sam! Hide.

913
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,520
Weak.

914
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:42,880
Puny.

915
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,360
Voiced-up.

916
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,360
Junkyard drone.

917
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,120
Decepticons!

918
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,510
Come here, boy.

919
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,900
There is another source of Energon hidden on this planet.

920
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,020
The boy can lead us to it.

921
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,960
Optimus!

922
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:05,760
Is the future of our race not worth a single human life?

923
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,910
Op, get up!

924
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,370
You'll never stop at one.

925
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,610
I'll take you all alive.

926
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:56,190
Sam, where are you?

927
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,400
You are so weak.

928
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:32,020
At last, Prime is dead.

929
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,540
Sam, run.

930
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:56,730
Autobots, attack!

931
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,100
Bumblebee, get them out of here.

932
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,090
This is Lennox.

933
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,370
That went well.

934
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,770
Lost the boy, Master.

935
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,230
The Autobots must be shielding the signals.

936
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,020
- I can't even rely on you.  - Sorry. No.

937
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,210
What a simple insect!

938
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,410
- What insect amongst severed billion...  - Shut up.

939
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,690
It could be anywhere.

940
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:53,870
Then we will force them to find him for us.

941
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,150
It's time for the world to know of our presence.

942
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:00,680
No more disguises, no mercy!

943
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,600
Time has come for my master's arrival.

944
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,960
Decepticons, mobilise.

945
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,970
It is time.

946
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,080
Oh, that single's good!

947
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,600
Speaking French is so exciting.

948
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,450
Oh God, who is this?

949
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,410
Hello... I mean, uh, bon...bonswa(good afternoon)!

950
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,560
What? Who is this?

951
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,430
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

952
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,500
I'm not impressed with your perverted mouth breathing.

953
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,800
New York City

954
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:30,890
Oh, jeez.

955
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,680
You are invading my space. I'm gonna have to drop you.

956
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,860
Would you get out of here?

957
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:36,860
Might freak me out.

958
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,790
We're gonna try new things.

959
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,410
Looks like Candian goosepoop.

960
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:43,970
It's nasty.

961
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:50,710
That's fine, 1-2-5.

962
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:59,870
Revenge is mine.

963
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,380
...port accident for a terrorist attack, or worse.

964
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,500
Negative. NORAD confirmed

965
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,020
project came from beyond our atmosphere

966
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,240
inbound at 30, 000 knot.

967
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:52,420
Citizens of the human hive, 

968
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,380
your leaders have withheld the truth.

969
01:07:56,470 --> 01:08:00,430
You are not alone in this universe.

970
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:03,640
We have lived among you, hidden...

971
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:06,980
but no more.

972
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,240
As you've seen, 

973
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:12,380
we can destroy your cities at will.

974
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,850
Unless you turn over this boy.

975
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,570
If you resist us, 

976
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:29,250
we will destroy the world, as you know it.

977
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:31,360
What we're hearing from the German government is that

978
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:34,230
the world broadcast is a satellite hacking.

979
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:35,640
- NEST Team, New Jersey  - The military has just told us

980
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,780
they have assumed Condition Delta, 

981
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:40,580
which is the highest level we've been at since 9/11.

982
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,640
President Obama is being flown to a bunker, 

983
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,340
somewhere in the middle of the United States.

984
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,150
in the phase of the worst simultaneous attacks ever

985
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,390
around the globe.

986
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,450
The aircraft carrier, USS Roosevelt, goes down off the East Coast

987
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,040
all hands lost.

988
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,670
Worldwide casualties are in the neighbourhood of 7,000,

989
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,300
but that number could implode.

990
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,560
It's still too early to tell.

991
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,810
What we need to ask now, is who and why.

992
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,800
The FBI is still trying to locate the boy, Sam Witwicky.

993
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,640
Within deep, they have information about this.

994
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,090
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

995
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:14,260
are all seeking the cooperation of worldwide law enforcements.

996
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,480
Hey bro, you need to listen to this, man.

997
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,440
- You gotta check this out.  - Once they have a traffic camera

998
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:19,390
- spotting a Sam Witwicky.  - They have a picture of me, man.

999
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:23,100
We're dead, bro. FBI, CIA, we're wanted fugitives now.

1000
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,830
I just need you to focus just one minute, man.

1001
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,630
This thing is blowing to a whole another level, alright.

1002
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,120
- You know one thing...  - Remove this thing.

1003
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,200
They can track us. Do you see this?

1004
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:29,940
What?

1005
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,540
They can track us?

1006
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,290
Like satellite-track us?

1007
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, I'm not even with you guys.

1008
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:40,110
Technically, I'm like a hostage. This is kidnapping. Enough...

1009
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,400
Yo, Leo!

1010
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,830
This thing's gonna give me a heart attack, I swear.

1011
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:45,860
- That's 'cause you was a wuss.  - You did force me into the car, right?

1012
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,230
- So...  - Oh, I think you scared.

1013
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,200
Hey, Mudflap.

1014
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,820
What are we going to do with this shrimp taco?

1015
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,440
Just pop a cap in his ass, throw him in the trunk

1016
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,760
and nobody gonna know nothing, y'know I mean?

1017
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,770
- Wait, now my trunk...  - Yo, bumper cars, 

1018
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,450
Check it out. I'm hearing you, okay?

1019
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,250
I'm right here and I can hear you.

1020
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,850
No one's popping any caps in any asses, okay?

1021
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:02,310
I've had a hell of a day.

1022
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,730
Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?

1023
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,860
Go whine to your boyfriend.

1024
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,570
Listen Sam, I know what I'm gonna do, man.

1025
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,690
Look, I'm just going to go to the authorities

1026
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,230
and tell them the truth. Like I had nothing to do with this, 

1027
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,080
- I'm an accomplice.  - Hey, hey!

1028
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,720
You wanted this, right? You wanted the real deal?

1029
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,860
'Cause that's what this is. Wake up! You're in the middle of it.

1030
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,860
You wanna run, go ahead, no one's stopping you.

1031
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,370
Stop complaining.

1032
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,460
What is the meaning of this?

1033
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,890
You dare point your gun at me?

1034
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:04,720
You want a piece of me? I will tear you apart!

1035
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,880
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

1036
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,620
- Tell them to lower the weapons.  - Tell them first.

1037
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:12,760
- Tell them to lower the weapons!  - Major, there's nothing I can do.

1038
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,580
Talk to him.

1039
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,730
US teams deactivated, Major.

1040
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,870
You are decease anti-Decepticon operations, 

1041
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,280
and return to Diego Garcia. Any further orders?

1042
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,530
No. We take our orders direct from Chairman Morshower.

1043
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,740
Well, I'll see your chairman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1044
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,100
but I will raise you a President of the United States.

1045
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,780
I have operational command now.

1046
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:32,140
An alien blood feud has been brought to our shores

1047
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,870
for which our soldiers are paying the price.

1048
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,340
The secret is out. This is our war now.

1049
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,210
And we will win it as we always have, 

1050
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,490
with a coordinated military strategy.

1051
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,170
This fool is terribly misinformed.

1052
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,920
You're gonna get every assets that you've got.

1053
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,660
What we need is to draw our battle plans.

1054
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,040
What we explore every possible, diplomatic solution.

1055
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,450
Like what: Handing over the kid?

1056
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,530
All options are being considered.

1057
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,290
Whatever the Decepticons are after, 

1058
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:59,110
this is just the start.

1059
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,860
Wait, there is no negotiating with them.

1060
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,530
I'm ordering you to stand down.

1061
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:03,960
You won't be needing this any more.

1062
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,370
Get your assets back to base.

1063
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,490
Take that scrap metal back to Diego Garcia.

1064
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,700
Let's go.

1065
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,110
I really don't like that dude.

1066
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,570
He's a asshole.

1067
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,240
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

1068
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:23,070
Ironhide, we should leave this planet.

1069
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,630
That's not what Optimus would want.

1070
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,560
There's nothing that you could have done.

1071
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,460
- You okay?  - Yeah.

1072
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,450
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.

1073
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,470
I messed up.

1074
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,880
I'm sorry.

1075
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:16,630
- Young fella, you are...  - ...person I care about most in my life.

1076
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:19,470
- If there's anything you need...  - I won't be far away.

1077
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,120
He's dead because of me.

1078
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,610
He came in to protect me instead.

1079
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,640
There's some things you just can't change.

1080
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,150
So this sacrifice was...

1081
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,880
will not have been in vain, hallelujah!

1082
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,180
We make it right when we turn myself in.

1083
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,400
But we, we've got to stick together.

1084
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,790
You're not gonna do that.

1085
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,060
Yes, I am.

1086
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,870
Everything we worked for will be wiped out.

1087
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,100
In one day.

1088
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,250
- You two.  - Huh?

1089
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,980
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1090
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,530
The symbols that have been rattling around in my head.

1091
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,120
That's old school, yo.

1092
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,290
That's like... That's Cybertonian.

1093
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:09,900
Oh, that's some serious stuff in there.

1094
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,560
They gotta mean something, like a message...

1095
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,940
or, like a... like a map!

1096
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,520
Like a map to an Energon source.

1097
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,290
Can you read this?

1098
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:17,120
- Read? Nah.  - You see that?

1099
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,710
No, we... we don't really do much reading.

1100
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,000
- Not so much.  - Well if you can't read it, 

1101
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:21,940
we gotta find somebody who can.

1102
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,020
Oh, look, who came stashing and back.

1103
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,710
Hair grown like a chip, there, look it.

1104
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,890
I had a bit of a mild panic attack earlier, alright?

1105
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,850
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

1106
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,890
I think I'm allowed that considering what I've been through

1107
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,450
and... I heard you have a problem.

1108
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,100
I think I know someone who can help.

1109
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,690
- Who?  - Robo-Warrior.

1110
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:41,730
This guy, Robo-Warrior...

1111
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:44,320
Everything about anything alien, he's supposed to know.

1112
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,720
One time we hacked this site

1113
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:50,400
and maybe, I saw some of your, uh... alien drawings or whatever.

1114
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,760
This is it.

1115
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,100
Yep, deli. Good front.

1116
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,970
Alright, wait here. I'll give you the go/no go, alright?

1117
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:15,140
Number 42, we got your... Right here...

1118
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,930
Cash only. Who's next?

1119
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,690
I told you put the salmon in the salt and then smoke.

1120
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,850
Ma, you want me to cut my handle off or what?

1121
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:24,930
- You order a terrible piece of fishing.  - I'm like a ninja, with a blade.

1122
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,010
Get out of here!

1123
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:28,430
Hey, Sam! Watch your reach, huh?

1124
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,930
Take a number, young man.

1125
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:31,680
Robo-Warrior.

1126
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,390
Know him?

1127
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,890
I never heard of him.

1128
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,180
You never heard of TheRealEffingDeal.com?

1129
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:41,010
You must be talking about that amateur blog operation

1130
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,220
with GameBoy level security.

1131
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,430
Robo-Warrior.

1132
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,260
It's him. It's him! That's the guy right there.

1133
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,220
That's him.

1134
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,260
No.

1135
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,300
You gotta be kidding me.

1136
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,800
Alright, meat store's closed. Everybody out!

1137
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,920
Go, right now!

1138
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:59,090
Wait a minute, you know this guy?

1139
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,590
- We're old friends.  - Whoa, friend, 

1140
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,300
you are the case that shut down Sector 7.

1141
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,840
Got the tie-bash disbandment, 

1142
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,170
no more security clearance, no retirement, no nothing.

1143
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:11,300
All 'cause of you, and your little criminal girlfriend.

1144
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,840
Look at her now, so mature.

1145
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,670
Moron, where's the wifresh?

1146
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,590
Don't catch me with the thing.

1147
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,000
- Yakov!  - What?

1148
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,250
You don't get Christmas bonus just standing around.

1149
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:23,210
You want those new teeth you saw in SkyMall?

1150
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,340
- It's my dream.  - Help around.

1151
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:28,000
- You live with your momma?  - No, my momma lives with me, 

1152
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:28,630
it's a big difference.

1153
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,630
They got your face all over the news, alien boy.

1154
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,750
- Yeah, I know.  - And NBE-1, still kicking, huh?

1155
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,080
How did that happen?

1156
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,380
Don't answer. I don't know what you're hiding, 

1157
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,670
but I don't want anything to do with it

1158
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,040
so, goodbye, you never saw me. I got bagels to schmidt.

1159
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:41,750
Well, give me 5 seconds.

1160
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,250
Look, hold on, I need your help.

1161
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:45,710
Really, you need my help?

1162
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,580
I need...

1163
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,170
Look, I am slowly losing my mind, okay?

1164
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,040
I had a little Crabbot, placed the device

1165
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,620
deep into the soft tissues of my brain, 

1166
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,330
and started projecting little alien symbols

1167
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:55,330
like a whole freaking movie

1168
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,120
and on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.

1169
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,290
So you think you got it rough?

1170
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:00,500
You said it projected images of your brain?

1171
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,290
Right.

1172
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,250
Meat locker, now!

1173
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,120
- Dead pigs.  - Yuck.

1174
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,080
What you're about to see is top secret.

1175
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,960
Do not tell my mother.

1176
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,210
Dead pigs, swine flu.

1177
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,210
- Not good.  - Now you know.

1178
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,120
Next time, you eat a goat or a pig.

1179
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,370
There's a story behind this.

1180
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,750
Yeah, there's a story.

1181
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,000
...you're saying you believe in aliens?

1182
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,370
Okay, files, files.

1183
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,160
We're talking about symbols.

1184
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,240
Hey! Still radioactive. Hands off.

1185
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,790
Okay, Cube-brain.

1186
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,910
Any of these look like the symbols you saw?

1187
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,120
Where did you get these?

1188
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,160
Before I got fired.

1189
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,700
I coached S-7's scrawny, drooly...

1190
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:42,780
75 years of alien research which points to one inescapable fact:

1191
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:47,410
The Transformers; they've been here a long, long time.

1192
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,070
How do I know?

1193
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,450
Archaeologists found these unexplained markings

1194
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,910
and ancient runes all over the world.

1195
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,280
China, Egypt, Greece.

1196
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:58,530
Shot at 1932.

1197
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:00,530
These the symbols you're seeing in your head?

1198
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:03,030
- Yeah.  - Same ones over here, right?

1199
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:07,860
So, tell me, how did they end up all drawing the same thing?

1200
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,450
Aliens.

1201
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,410
And I think some of them stayed.

1202
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:13,320
Check this out.

1203
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,400
Project Black Knife.

1204
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,450
Robots, in disguise. Hiding here.

1205
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,400
All along.

1206
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,530
We detected radioactive signatures all across the country.

1207
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:27,240
I pleaded on my knees with S-7 to investigate it

1208
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,860
but they said the readings were infantesimal.

1209
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,530
That I was obsessed!

1210
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,150
Me, can you imagine that?

1211
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:38,570
Megatron said that there was another Energon source here.

1212
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,360
- On Earth? On another source?  - On Earth.

1213
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,610
Okay, and that these symbols, 

1214
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,190
the maps in my head would lead him there.

1215
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,230
Should you talk to your Autobot friends?

1216
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,440
No, no, no, the source is before.

1217
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,110
Whatever the Energon source is, it predates them. It's before them.

1218
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,900
- So it comes before that.  - Correct.

1219
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:52,820
Well then, report...

1220
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:54,860
Unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1221
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,520
I mean, I'm not on speed terms or whatever...

1222
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,020
Actually, I am.

1223
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:04,610
Let me out!

1224
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,310
- It could be a little bit sad.  - Open it.

1225
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,770
I'm gonna so many Decepticons on your butt!

1226
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,900
Behave.

1227
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,440
- What is it, a Decepticon?  - Yeah.

1228
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,560
- Can you train him?  - Tried to.

1229
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,980
I spent my whole adult life, coming a plan of aliens.

1230
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,520
- You're very furious...  - And you're carrying it around

1231
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,310
what are you supposed to make a little chihuahua.

1232
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:26,350
Wanna throw it down, you pubic fro-head?

1233
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:29,350
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry about your eye.

1234
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,230
You know, but if you're a good boy, 

1235
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,270
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1236
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,600
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1237
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,640
Just tell me what these symbols are.

1238
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:37,730
Please.

1239
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,020
Okay.

1240
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:44,310
Oh, I know that. That's the language of the Primes.

1241
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,680
I don't read it, but uh, these guys...

1242
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,890
Where the frick did you find photos of these guys?

1243
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,100
- Is this them?  - Yeah.

1244
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,810
Sakers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1245
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,520
Oh, they've been here for thousands of years, 

1246
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,770
looking for something.

1247
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,600
I don't know what, nobody tells me nothing.

1248
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,810
Oh, they'll translate those symbols for ya.

1249
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:03,470
And I know where to find them.

1250
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:04,260
Show us.

1251
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,220
Closest one's in Washington.

1252
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,680
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.

1253
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,010
Land of dreams in there.

1254
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,550
All I ever want to be was an astronaut.

1255
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,970
- Hold those.  - What is that?

1256
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:26,890
What?

1257
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,390
I wear them when I'm in the funk.

1258
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:32,550
So does Jeamby, Cheater. It's a baseball thing.

1259
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:35,630
Okay. Once you synchronize, shop-mind and empty bladder

1260
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,680
you get caught, demand an attorney and don't ever say my name.

1261
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,720
Here, take one of these pills.

1262
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,470
Slip it under your tongue, 

1263
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:42,930
it's a high-concentrate polymer they put in Oreo cookies.

1264
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:44,760
Fools the polygraph, everytime.

1265
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,720
Okay, now let's get this show on the road.

1266
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,130
Whoa, no, listen. I can't do this.

1267
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,340
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, alright?

1268
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,720
'cause I'm not gonna do this. Guards have guns, 

1269
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,380
- I don't want to die.  - Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1270
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,510
You compromise this mission, you are dead to me.

1271
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:59,760
Now look into my eyes, and tighten up that spare tank.

1272
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,800
The museum is now closing.

1273
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,590
Papa, bad news, bro.

1274
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,590
Ran out of toilet paper, you got any out here?

1275
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,800
- Please tell me you...  - Sir, I suggest you get in there.

1276
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,300
The museum is closed.

1277
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,960
Listen man, I understand that, but as you can see, this is important.

1278
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,800
Dumper-dumper. I gotta go, alright?

1279
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,460
Sir, you are a grown naked man around showing...

1280
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:19,420
- Pull your pants up and exit...  - I'm not going anywhere.

1281
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,630
You got that paper, right, sir?

1282
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,960
You should be embarassed.

1283
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,670
This a family museum, sir.

1284
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,920
What is going on here?

1285
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,870
How many times can you get tased in the nuts?

1286
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:53,420
So you covered the gates, huh, you know.

1287
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,880
You're an amateur man, a rank amateur.

1288
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,370
There's now five guards. Five guards.

1289
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,040
- You get this stuff and get out of here.  - Give me a second.

1290
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:04,620
I gotta get the tracker, alright.

1291
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,540
- Be good.  - I'm claustrophobic.

1292
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,700
Look, look. Follow him, follow him.

1293
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:27,540
He knows where he's going.

1294
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,660
- He knows something.  - What?

1295
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,910
He knows something!

1296
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,370
- You got what I got?  - Yeah.

1297
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:44,280
Blackbird.

1298
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,120
There he is.

1299
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:52,990
This guy's a legend, like... like the Chairman of the Board.

1300
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,780
Yo, freshman, put the shard.

1301
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,360
And watch the magic happen.

1302
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,490
Oh shit, it's a Decepticon!

1303
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,530
- Decepticon?  - What is it?

1304
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,490
Find the main tail!

1305
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:25,940
What sort of hideous mosalleem is this?

1306
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:30,780
Semi pulls and days, show yourselves!

1307
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,030
Or suffer my infinite wrath!

1308
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,190
W-wait, old spinal called based organisms.

1309
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,230
Bugger!

1310
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,730
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1311
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,300
Prepare for a systems' override.

1312
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,800
I tell you, this guy did not age well.

1313
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,670
- He either heard it.  - Command these doors to open.

1314
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:52,970
Fire!

1315
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:55,840
Oh, I said, fire!

1316
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,210
Bollocks.

1317
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:00,340
Break that, these worthless...

1318
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,710
Wait a second.

1319
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,590
Itching, wretching, rust in my arse.

1320
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:08,920
Oh, the museum's gonna be very angry.

1321
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,250
Very angry. We gotta catch that plane!

1322
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,160
I'm on a mission.

1323
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,330
- W-wait, wait!  - Wait, wait, wait.

1324
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,330
- Hey!  - What do you want?

1325
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:21,000
Look, we just want to talk!

1326
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,870
I've no time to talk, I'm on a mission!

1327
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:24,740
I'm a mercenary goon-bringer.

1328
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:26,830
- What planet am I on?  - Earth.

1329
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,870
Earth? Terrible name for a planet, 

1330
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,870
might as well call it "dirt".

1331
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,830
Planet dirt.

1332
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:35,780
Tell me, is that robot civil war still going on?

1333
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:37,910
- Who's winning?  - The Decepticons.

1334
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,160
Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.

1335
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,580
What do you mean, "changed sides"?

1336
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:43,580
It's a choice.

1337
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:47,950
It's intensely personal decision. So much negativity.

1338
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:50,070
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1339
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,200
Meaning you don't have to work for those

1340
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,700
miserable, freaking Decepticons?

1341
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:56,120
If they set on their way, they destroy the whole Universe.

1342
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,910
I'm changing sides, I'm changing sides, Warrior Goddess!

1343
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,570
- Who's your little Autobot?  - Oh you cutes.

1344
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:02,360
Name's Wheelie.

1345
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:04,530
Say my name, say my name!

1346
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:06,820
What are you allowing to happen to your foot just now?

1347
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,070
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1348
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:10,740
Yeah, well, he's faithful, and he's nude and he's perverted.

1349
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:13,780
Can you just... Can you stop?

1350
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:16,070
- Hey, what are you doing?  - ...I don't wanna argue it.

1351
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:16,780
What were you saying?

1352
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,530
I told you my name was Jetfire!

1353
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,280
Wow, someone shit in the bed this morning?

1354
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:26,070
Pretty stout with my mother.

1355
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:28,690
My ancestors have been here for centuries.

1356
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:31,570
My father, one was a wheel! The first wheel!

1357
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:33,610
- Do you know what he transformed into?  - No.

1358
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:38,820
Nothing! But he did so with honor, dignity and...

1359
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,280
My boosters are fried.

1360
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,360
I thought we could help each other.

1361
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,860
You know things I don't know. I know things you don't know.

1362
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,360
- I do.  - I don't think he knows anything.

1363
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,520
Honestly, I don't know.

1364
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,110
These vivid symbols,

1365
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,810
they're symbols but they are in my mind.

1366
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,150
You see, all this is in my mind.

1367
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,190
And Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1368
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:08,480
Him and someone called the Fallen.

1369
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,020
The Fallen? I know him. He left me here to rust.

1370
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,440
The original Decepticon.

1371
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,940
He's terrible to work for. He's always apocalypse, chaos...

1372
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:19,810
His suspects, they were a part of my mission

1373
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:21,600
the Fall and Search, I remember now.

1374
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:24,190
Of a dagger's tip and the key!

1375
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,310
Slow down. The dagger's tip, the key, 

1376
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:27,770
- what are you talking about?  - No time to explain.

1377
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:29,350
Hold on, everybody!

1378
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,680
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1379
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:00,560
I was overseeing the wrong planet.

1380
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,560
Hey, that frickin' hurt!

1381
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:14,220
Oh, God!

1382
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:21,720
Oh, my God! You beautiful face, this will be a perfect moment.

1383
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,800
Except you landed on my testicles.

1384
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:25,640
Please get off!

1385
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:29,510
My balls!

1386
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:32,050
Sam!

1387
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:36,260
- Where are we? Simmons!  - Hey! Yeah!

1388
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,380
Oh, my God.

1389
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,220
What is this? It's Vegas!

1390
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,920
- You guys okay?  - Yeah!

1391
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:45,840
Hey! I think we're in Vegas!

1392
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,340
That really, really hurts.

1393
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,590
You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt.

1394
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:52,170
People could've gotten killed, okay? And if I would have gotten hurt, 

1395
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,340
- you would have heard from...  - Oh, shut up!

1396
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,130
I told you I was opening the space bridge.

1397
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,420
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1398
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,920
What did you tell us? You didn't tell us anything!

1399
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,510
You didn't tell us anything. Why are we in Egypt?

1400
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:06,170
Don't you dare slip in with me, fleshwing.

1401
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:09,090
- You would do the informed.  - Can you just stop for a second?

1402
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:11,050
Can you focus? Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1403
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:13,750
so we can all have a little bit assemblance and peace of mind?

1404
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:17,050
This planet was visited by our race once before

1405
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,960
by our earliest ancestors a millenium ago.

1406
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
They were on an exploratory mission to harvest Energon, 

1407
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,630
the life blood of our race.

1408
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:28,590
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize and rust, 

1409
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:29,590
let my wretched self.

1410
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:34,790
Do you have any idea what is like a slowly fall of parton die?

1411
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:37,670
Let's not get episodic, okay? Old-timer.

1412
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:43,540
Beginning, middle, end. Facts, details, condense, plot, tell it.

1413
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:48,540
Somewhere buried in this desert, our ancestors built a great machine.

1414
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,790
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1415
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,670
- Destroy suns?  - You mean blow them up?

1416
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:58,330
Yes. You see, in the beginning, there were seven Primes, 

1417
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:00,000
our original leaders.

1418
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:04,040
And they set out in the Universe seeking distant suns to harvest.

1419
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,910
The Primes set out with one rule:

1420
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:10,080
Never destroy a planet with life.

1421
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,160
Until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1422
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,410
And his name, for ever more, was the Fallen.

1423
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,450
He despised the human race.

1424
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:26,700
And he wanted to kill you all by turning on that machine.

1425
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:31,120
The only way to activate it is with a legendary key

1426
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,240
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1427
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:44,990
A great battle took place over possession of the Matrix.

1428
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:51,990
The Fallen who was stronger at his will did, 

1429
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:58,110
surrendered no choice, but to steal and hide it from him.

1430
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:03,450
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave their lives to seal the Matrix away

1431
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:06,780
in a tomb made of their very own bodies.

1432
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:10,360
A tomb we cannot find.

1433
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,610
Somewhere, buried in this desert, 

1434
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:17,240
that deadly machine remains.

1435
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,450
The Fallen knows where it is.

1436
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:25,360
And if he finds the Tomb of the Primes, your world will be no more.

1437
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:27,110
Okay so how do we stop it?

1438
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,320
Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen.

1439
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:30,900
Optimus Prime?

1440
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,820
So you met a Prime?

1441
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,980
You must have met a great descendant.

1442
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:39,940
Is he alive?

1443
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,520
Here? On this planet?

1444
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:45,070
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1445
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,070
So he's dead.

1446
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:49,110
Without a Prime, it's impossible.

1447
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,520
No one else could stop the Fallen.

1448
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:54,690
So the same energy that's going to be used to reactivate the machine...

1449
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,400
Could that energy somehow be used to reactivate Optimus

1450
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,400
and bring him back to life?

1451
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,440
It was never designed for that purpose, 

1452
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,190
but it's an energy, like no other.

1453
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,310
So then how do you get us to the Matrix before the Decepticons get to me?

1454
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:11,650
Follow your mind, your map, your symbols, 

1455
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:14,270
what you got in the sand, it's your bloom.

1456
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:16,560
When dawn alights the Dagger's tip, 

1457
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,400
three kings will reveal the doorway.

1458
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,520
Find the doorway!

1459
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,060
Go now, go!

1460
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:26,310
That was my mission. It's your mission now.

1461
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:28,850
Go before the Decepticons find me

1462
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:30,850
and find you.

1463
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:38,560
That was my CIA contact.

1464
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,020
Says Ancient Sumerian used to call the Gulf of Aqaba

1465
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:43,270
- the Dagger's Tip.  - That's the dagger's tip.

1466
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:44,430
- It's part of the Red Sea.  - Got it.

1467
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,680
It divides Egypt and Jordan like the tip of a blade.

1468
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:49,390
29 and a half degrees north 35 east.

1469
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:50,600
There it is.

1470
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:53,020
Okay, first thing we gotta do is get Optimus to Dagger's Tip.

1471
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,640
How are you gonna get him halfway around the world?

1472
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:56,350
We're gonna make a call.

1473
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:00,600
We got the cops.

1474
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,720
I can't go to prison, guys!

1475
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:14,850
Sam, you gotta get off this road and lay low.

1476
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:27,340
Man, they'll pick up.

1477
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,630
This is just called blending in like a ninja.

1478
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,510
How about I'll lay my piss in your face?

1479
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:33,260
They're gone.

1480
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:34,970
Wait another time.

1481
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,300
How are you gonna make the call to Lennox?

1482
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,800
You are in the worldwide. What, they're gonna tranquil in one base?

1483
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,260
They'll track you here in seconds.

1484
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,220
CIA is all over this place.

1485
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,220
You're gonna call?

1486
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:50,470
Okay, that's... that's a good idea.

1487
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:52,130
- Alright?  - I mean I just was...

1488
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:53,670
My mind in other things.

1489
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,340
Like why don't you get being chipped in prison.

1490
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:57,550


1491
01:32:57,590 --> 01:33:00,210
This departure: 2100 hours.

1492
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,130
So we're shipped in back to base.

1493
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,380
This is central at stake.

1494
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,000
Major Lennox, phone call.

1495
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,630
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid, you know?

1496
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:16,920
One with the attitude break?

1497
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,460
I need the truck. The truck.

1498
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,210
We got a possible resurrection going on over here.

1499
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,380
You're not gonna believe where we are.

1500
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:25,500
Code Tot, as in King Tutankhamen, 

1501
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:27,210
back of a $1 bill.

1502
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:32,460
Coordinates for air-drop, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1503
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,750
Get it. Write it down, write it.

1504
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:35,130
Oh, my God.

1505
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:36,670
I gotta go, okay. I hate the cops.

1506
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:37,880
W-Wait, who are you?

1507
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:42,000
Wait, it's me. Leo, me, Leo, Leo. Leo.

1508
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,420
The cops are coming right now. We need to go.

1509
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:50,040
Coordinates 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1510
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,460
Tip of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aqaba.

1511
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:53,790
Egypt.

1512
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,540
Are you serious?

1513
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,580
Sir.

1514
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:05,160
Even if we could figure out a way to get big man over there.

1515
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,790
How is this little kid's supposed to bring him back to life?

1516
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,540
I don't know.

1517
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,540
But we gotta trust him.

1518
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,950
Okay, let's go over it again.

1519
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:17,410
- When the dawn arise...  - When the dawn arise the dagger's tip, 

1520
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:19,540
- the three kings...  - ...will reveal the doorway.

1521
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:21,290
That's what he said. You know what that means?

1522
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:23,200
- No, what does it mean?  - I have no idea.

1523
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,080
Oh my God, oh my God. Checkpoint, checkpoint.

1524
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,160
I don't have my passport.

1525
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:32,950
Passport. Idiota!

1526
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:38,620
They have cams at top.

1527
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:42,530
He's the one that they want.

1528
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,370
Alright, chill. Let's be nice to them.

1529
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,660
I can handle it. These are my people.

1530
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,700
- Yeah.  - I'm 136.

1531
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,820
Oh great, a frickin' munchkin.

1532
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,240
Oh, little people are mean. Tell him he's tall.

1533
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:05,280
- What do you want?  - I want to go to...

1534
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,200
The Dagger's Tip, right?

1535
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,820
Egypt, Jordan. We wanna go there.

1536
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,860
Me and my family. This is my family.

1537
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:14,900
- This is my son, my other son.  - Hi there.

1538
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:15,650
My daughter.

1539
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,940
We're tourists from New York.

1540
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,650
- New York?  - Yes. Yes.

1541
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,110
50 kilometres.

1542
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:22,570
We're going to get one of your falafels, thank you!

1543
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:23,530
Yeah, thank you very much.

1544
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:25,570
- New York.  - I know, I know you from somewhere.

1545
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:27,610
No, we do not work for the CIA.

1546
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:35,610
Decepticons, voice location.

1547
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:36,770
Detected.

1548
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:40,780


1549
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:48,610
Undercover, yo, you gotta blend in with your surrounding.

1550
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:50,860
You know, you gotta be part of the landscape.

1551
01:35:59,150 --> 01:35:59,860
Awesome.

1552
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:02,150
I think aliens built that.

1553
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:04,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1554
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:05,690
Go, move it! Move it.

1555
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,190
- What?  - Hey, guard us.

1556
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,730
Low-profile, don't make a scene, okay?

1557
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,190
Yeah, some of us got work to do!

1558
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,770
Dumb Autobots.

1559
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:18,590
Estimated time of detachment NEST, 0600 AM

1560
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,430
Being my girlfriend is hazardous to your health.

1561
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:41,590
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.

1562
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:43,380
- Really?  - Yeah.

1563
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,880
Why don't you say it?

1564
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:49,710
Ladies first.

1565
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,760
Okay, so tonight, you're gonna be a gentleman.

1566
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,630
You're really chivalrous.

1567
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:56,960
Why are you mad at me?

1568
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,590
You know what? Baby, I'm not...

1569
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,460
I'm not mad.

1570
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:06,550
You realise that I just flew 3,000 miles to keep you from getting killed.

1571
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:07,500
I know.

1572
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:13,000
Who else could be your girlfriend too?

1573
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,000
Look at the things that go through with me.

1574
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,670
And now we're underneath the moon and the stars

1575
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:22,000
and the three most beautiful pyramids on the planet

1576
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:24,090
and you still can't even tell me that you love me.

1577
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:28,750
- What?  - Wait.

1578
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:31,380
- Why do boys always change the subject?  - The moon and the stars...

1579
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,210
- Sam...  - Come with me really quick.

1580
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,120
Simmons, Leo, wake up!

1581
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,710
Listen, Astronomy class, page 47, you remember the class?

1582
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:51,330
No, no, I was only in college for two days, you remember that?

1583
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:53,330
- Yeah, well, get up. Up, up.  - What are you talking about?

1584
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,080
Can you see those three stars?

1585
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,830
You see how the last one touches the horizon?

1586
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,210
That's Orion's belt.

1587
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,790
It's also called the Three Kings and the reason for that is

1588
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:08,580
the three Egyptian kings who built the pyramids in Giza built them

1589
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,750
to mear those stars.

1590
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:11,580
So it's like an aerial staring straight in the face.

1591
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,370
They all point due east towards Jordan.

1592
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,040
The mountains of Petra.

1593
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:32,240
We got a seatbelt malfunction. We gotta have to divert...

1594
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,870
Flight in lower, prepare for bail-out.

1595
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,200
Bail-out, bail-out, bail-out, bail-out?

1596
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,410
Alright, team, grab your shoots.

1597
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,200
Bail-out?

1598
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,410
Familiar with the standard MC-4?

1599
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:46,450
Of course not. I've never jumped out of a publicly good airplane before.

1600
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,030
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1601
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:48,450
Yeah.

1602
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:52,570
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1603
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:54,450
You're behind this, aren't you?

1604
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:55,610
What are you talking about?

1605
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:57,740
You heard the pilot. These guys don't mess around.

1606
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:01,950
This is standard procedure. I'm just following orders to the letter.

1607
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:03,200
Do you know what you said?

1608
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,610
You, just find the captain and your career...

1609
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:13,400
Wait, what was that? What's that?

1610
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:14,610
That's not good.

1611
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:17,400
Come on. Right this way, right this way!

1612
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,150
I can't jump out of an airplane.

1613
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:25,820
Come here. Come here.

1614
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:27,030
Why don't you get your chute?

1615
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:29,860
Because I have to secure the VIPs first.

1616
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:32,190
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully.

1617
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:34,030
- Remember as everything that I say.  - OK.

1618
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,880
East to the GPS trackers, so you can be found by search and rescue.

1619
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:43,110
- Look, are you listening?  - I can't.

1620
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,070
- Alright, alright.  - Alright.

1621
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:47,980
When the plane that shoot inflates into the air, 

1622
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:50,110
pull the pin and open some air, 

1623
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,360
red is for your back up, blue's your primary.

1624
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:53,860
I want you to pull the blue.

1625
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,730
I need you to pull it really hard.

1626
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,110
Not right now. We're on the plane, you dumbass!

1627
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,480
Did he say goodbye?

1628
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,230
No, he didn't even say goodbye.

1629
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:07,400
General, we're loaded and ready.

1630
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:10,480
You give us the go, and we'll be ready to press in five minutes.

1631
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:11,770
- Excellent.  - Sir, 

1632
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:13,560
you need to see this. Now.

1633
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,810
Have we checked these coordinates?

1634
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:19,270
Egypt, sir. They're air-dropping in.

1635
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:20,560
You gotta be kidding me.

1636
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,350
He knows something.

1637
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,350
We need to be ready to back him up, if this thing goes hot.

1638
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:26,980
Copy that.

1639
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,640
CIA just got a hit on the boy.

1640
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,770
Hundred miles from the location on that little map there.

1641
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:33,560
It's getting hotter.

1642
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:40,680
It's gotta be... around here somewhere.

1643
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:22,590
It's here somewhere, guys.

1644
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,590
Oh yeah, why?

1645
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:25,630
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1646
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,050
who doesn't even know what planet he's on.

1647
01:41:27,090 --> 01:41:29,590
On his defense, this is the biggest doorway

1648
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,300
I've ever seen in my entire life.

1649
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:34,720
Okay. Well, that's great. Let me do a quick search, alright?

1650
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:36,090
Nope.

1651
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:38,840
Ever questioned mind, guys, that archaeologists have been here before.

1652
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,800
There's nothing here.

1653
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,170
You realise it's heart-break, despair, kid.

1654
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:44,550
Sometimes, you get to the end of the rainbow

1655
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,760
and the leprechauns went and booby-trapped it.

1656
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,470
I'm listening to you; you live with your mother.

1657
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:52,550
- It's not over.  - It is over. It's done.

1658
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:54,210
Why are we still listening to your little punk-ass?

1659
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:56,340
I mean, what kind of dumbfucks accept ding my rim?

1660
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,380
Kill Megatron. How about that?

1661
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,050
Well, he doesn't get the job done, you know, I mean, 

1662
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:01,960
- 'cause he's zapped, man.  - You scared?

1663
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,840
Well, scared? Scared of your ugly face.

1664
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:06,710
I'm ugly? Well, we twins, you stupid genius.

1665
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:15,550
Guys! Oh, hey!

1666
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:17,290
You like the way that feels?

1667
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,960
- That ain't hurt.  - You got that, don't you?

1668
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:19,750
I'm getting up...

1669
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:29,960
Now that's rude.

1670
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:43,620
Oh, my God! The symbols.

1671
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,370
Bee! Shoot it.

1672
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,730
Check this.

1673
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:17,450
Wow!

1674
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,240
This is the part which they found silicon.

1675
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:22,080
The Tomb of the Primes.

1676
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,570
The Matrix.

1677
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:03,460
No

1678
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,030
Thousands of years turned to dust.

1679
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:10,360
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

1680
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,950
Hear that?

1681
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,190
US Air Force. C-17s.

1682
01:44:20,490 --> 01:44:22,980
You can't bring it back, Sam, there's nothing left.

1683
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,240
Look, look around you.

1684
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:28,150
We didn't just go through everything we went through for no reason at all.

1685
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:29,610
They just haven't end like this.

1686
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:31,440
There is a reason that we're here.

1687
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,900
The voices and the symbols in my head led us here...

1688
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,110
for a purpose.

1689
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:43,110
Everyone's after me because of what I know.

1690
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,480
And what I know, is that this is going to work.

1691
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,810
How do you know it's going to work?

1692
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:52,360
Because I believe it.

1693
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:04,900
Best put me out of this plane.

1694
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,270
He's dropping the big one. Sam!

1695
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:27,980
You think you can bring him back to life with that pixie dust?

1696
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,730
Absolutely. Let's go!

1697
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,220
Go!

1698
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:42,520
Move it!

1699
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,560
Remember your friendly!

1700
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:56,140
Cover Optimus!

1701
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:01,470
Secure the village. Get those cases down here.

1702
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:03,550
Get snipers and Stingers up high.

1703
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:06,350
So he just dropped off ten tonnes of dead robot

1704
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,390
in the middle of nowhere.

1705
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,760
Hope this little kid know what he's doing.

1706
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,760
Yeah, me too.

1707
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:20,140
Got a visual! Yellow tee, four klicks.

1708
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,430
Hot-flare!

1709
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:28,800
That's them right there. You see the flare?

1710
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,880
Right over there! See it?

1711
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:39,870
No.

1712
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:41,550
Sam!

1713
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:55,590
Oh God, please God, 

1714
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,750
- please!  - Leo, stop freaking out.

1715
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,090
- Just stop freaking out!  - Just drop this guy off, huh?

1716
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:00,750
- Please let me live, just let me live.  - Stop freaking out!

1717
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:02,630
Just stop screaming right now. That's it.

1718
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,170
Can't take that guy anymore.

1719
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:30,330
We gotta split up.

1720
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:33,250
Bumblebee, you are the decoy. You lead the Decepticons away, alright?

1721
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:34,620
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1722
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,670
I'll help throw their fire away.

1723
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,540
You get to those soldiers.

1724
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:41,750
I hope that dust works, kid.

1725
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,120
Thank you.

1726
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,120
It's turning around.

1727
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,460
It's coming back, it's coming back.

1728
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:52,460
It's up to me.

1729
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:55,540
One man, alone, betrayed by the country he loves, 

1730
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:58,040
now its last hope in the final hour of need.

1731
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,620
The pants are to be driven like never before.

1732
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,750
Under my skin.

1733
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:03,740
Hey, hey, hey! Don't go nowhere.

1734
01:48:03,790 --> 01:48:05,830
- Drive!  - You will never make it, kid.

1735
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:07,500
Bravery will only get you so far.

1736
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:10,160
You tased me, okay? You owe me.

1737
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,200
- I'm go.  - Okay, okay.

1738
01:48:11,410 --> 01:48:12,700
That was a test. You passed, alright?

1739
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,620
Thing's got alien tattoos all over.

1740
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:24,280
That ain't Air Force.

1741
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:29,370
What the hell was that?

1742
01:48:29,410 --> 01:48:31,160
- Eddy-1, copy.  - Anyone there?

1743
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:31,870
Who's up?

1744
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:33,320
- Copy.  - Radio's down.

1745
01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:34,780
It's dead. Counter that.

1746
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:35,870
EMP-burst.

1747
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:39,490
Let's see how this day is going in this godforsaken desert.

1748
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:42,280
Yes, sir.

1749
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,490
Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.

1750
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:45,070
I know, sir.

1751
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,780
W... Which, what country am I in right now?

1752
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:49,110
United States.

1753
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:53,320
No, no, not the United States. I'm from the United States, 

1754
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,450
I'm in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by goats.

1755
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,900
Well, that was our good friend, Galloway.

1756
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,780
He's less than pleased.

1757
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:03,740
How is it that we can't reach our men, 

1758
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:09,530
but he can reach me from some random Egyptian desert?

1759
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:13,940
Nothing.

1760
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:17,860
Mike, put an SOS, let the eye in the sky know we need some help.

1761
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:18,530
Yes, sir. Prepare the gas can.

1762
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,900
Pop some more flares so that the kid can find us.

1763
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:32,190
There he is. We got a couple of miles.

1764
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:37,110
Lennox's team has the latest in quantum crypto gear.

1765
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:43,110
Can somebody tell me why we can't establish simple radio contact?

1766
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:45,480
We're hailing them on every frequency and mode in the book, sir.

1767
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,230
Our satellites in the area have gone blind.

1768
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:48,230
We're working it, sir.

1769
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,400
Dammit.

1770
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:52,150
Something's not right, it doesn't add up.

1771
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:55,480
Contact the Jordanians, see what their assets they've got in the area.

1772
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,850
And get Egypt's General Salaam, 

1773
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:01,980
ask him to clear some US V over-flights in Egyptian airspace.

1774
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:05,020
We need an assist in confirming visuals now.

1775
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:06,690
Scramble predators now.

1776
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:08,480
B-1, rotate.

1777
01:50:20,390 --> 01:50:21,560
East on the mile that way.

1778
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:28,560
Come here.

1779
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:32,970
This way.

1780
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:41,970
- One man... alone...  - Stop saying that.

1781
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,930
- betrayed by the country he loves.  - Oh my goodness, 

1782
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:45,850
I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1783
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:48,060
Just relax, you're looking nice well.

1784
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,890
I... I don't think he's still following us.

1785
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:01,510
That's what you think.

1786
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:22,720
Master, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, 

1787
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:25,720
but the soldiers brought the body of Prime.

1788
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:28,300
The boy must have the Matrix.

1789
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,260
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1790
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,630
Decepticons!

1791
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:35,590
Begin our assault!

1792
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:37,840
We got incoming!

1793
01:51:54,090 --> 01:51:56,250
We got a whole load of flight coming our way!

1794
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:58,920
- How many?  - We got 13 to count.

1795
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,960
This ain't good. This ain't good.

1796
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,290
We 'bout to get our asses whooped.

1797
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:17,830
Alright, those Decepticons are searching for Sam.

1798
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,380
Whatever he has, he thinks it'll bring Optimus back to life.

1799
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:25,500
So our mission is to find him and get him to Optimus.

1800
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:27,420
Alright, we're gonna draw fire from the left flag.

1801
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,460
I need a scout team.

1802
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:31,370
We'll walk through the middle with Arcee and Ironhide.

1803
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:33,500
Alright, when you see the precious cargo, 

1804
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,460
I want you to pop green smoke and come back to those pillars.

1805
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,710
We'll have the ambush set.

1806
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,460
Alright, let's go, move out!

1807
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:40,080
- Move out!  - Move out!

1808
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:51,040
Did you see that film Gunfire Aero-Kay Karao?

1809
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:56,210
- Casting Kirk Douglas.  - No, why?

1810
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,660
Looks like we're right in the middle of it.

1811
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:01,910
Is that good?

1812
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:05,750
Lot of people died.

1813
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,910
- Oh, oh, oh...  - Hide!

1814
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,370
Oh my God!

1815
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:51,610
Sam, Sam.

1816
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:56,490
Get down, get down.

1817
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:02,440
Once, it's clear, we'll run for Optimus

1818
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:03,860
as fast we can, okay?

1819
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:06,900
And what if it doesn't work?

1820
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:08,950
This will work.

1821
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:11,400
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't?  - It's gonna work.

1822
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:12,940
It'll work.

1823
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:49,760
Go Go...

1824
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:01,720
Radio shell.

1825
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:22,300
We got a half a mile.

1826
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:23,930
I don't think the soldiers know we're here.

1827
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:27,380
Fall back!

1828
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:29,550
Ironhide, up for middle.

1829
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,050
Ironhide, move it.

1830
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,840
Go! Go, go!

1831
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:46,670
There's no way to go. We're gonna die!

1832
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:49,050
Listen, we're going out. We're going out like men, understand?

1833
01:56:51,070 --> 01:56:53,540
We're gonna die!

1834
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:20,830
- Oh.  - Look at this motherf...

1835
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,420
Mean robots suck!

1836
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:35,400
Hang on

1837
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:36,790
Get back!

1838
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:43,210
Grab it! Don't let go.

1839
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:44,830
Hang in, man, I got this.

1840
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:51,000
I don't wanna die.

1841
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:55,200
Careful grip, boy. Careful grip.

1842
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:56,940
You can't eat me... no no no.

1843
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:03,370
He did. He got so waste.

1844
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:04,910
Who's your daddy now, huh?

1845
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:06,080
He got all these...

1846
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:08,370
Well, the safe place is right under it.

1847
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:10,990
Run it. Run for his feet!

1848
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:22,870
You're never eating me. I'm gonna bust your face up.

1849
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:33,860
Nobody's tested me. In your face!

1850
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:36,200
Take five, Mudflap.

1851
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:38,450
Oh my God!

1852
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,200
Nobody messes with the twins.

1853
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,240
I got you.

1854
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:57,150
Ow, man, you shot me in the face!

1855
01:58:57,610 --> 01:58:59,860
- Stay under it!  - Yeah, stay under it.

1856
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:21,730
Judy!

1857
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:29,110
- Sam!  - What?

1858
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:29,900
Sam!

1859
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:32,230
Sam! Sam!

1860
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:37,940
Sam!

1861
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,360
- Sam.  - Dad!

1862
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,940
Wait! Wait!

1863
01:59:50,270 --> 01:59:51,020
Please listen...

1864
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:53,810
I want you to run! Run!

1865
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:54,810
- Dad, just stop!  - Get out of here.

1866
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:56,150
- They don't want you, they want me.  - Just run!

1867
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,810
Oh God, wait!

1868
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:00,650
- Samuel Witwicky.  - Wait.

1869
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:03,940
This is what you want. You don't want 'em.

1870
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,400
- Go! Go!  - Please, stop! Stop!

1871
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,350
- Why don't you...  - Just get out of here!

1872
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,350
Just don't move.

1873
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:11,560
I know you.

1874
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:13,520
Just go! Just go!

1875
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,980
And I know what, you need me.

1876
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:17,020
Because I know about the Matrix.

1877
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:19,480
- Don't do it. Sam, listen to me.  - Please, Dad.

1878
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:20,480
They're gonna kill us all anyway.

1879
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,930
Hey, hey. Look.

1880
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:23,310
This is what you want. I'm here.

1881
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:25,230
Bumblebee!

1882
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:30,100
Help!

1883
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:40,060
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

1884
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:20,550
Come on, get in.

1885
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:36,670
- Bee?  - Yeah.

1886
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,050
Hey! I don't know what's going on, but we gotta move.

1887
02:01:46,710 --> 02:01:48,420
- Run!  - There's gotta be a way out of here.

1888
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,710
Buckle up, buckle up! Get in here.

1889
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:00,130
Bee! Bumblebee!

1890
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,710
You get them somewhere safe, alright?

1891
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:06,500
You gotta get in the car. You can be safe.

1892
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,340
No, listen to my discussion.

1893
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:09,790
- You're my son, alright?  - I know!

1894
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:11,710
You're my son! We'll all go together.

1895
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:13,170
- Listen.  - We're all going together.

1896
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:15,290
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.

1897
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:17,380
He's gonna get you to safety. You don't, you run.

1898
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:19,630
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run. You hear what I'm saying?

1899
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,500
Okay? I'll find you when you're safe.

1900
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:23,000
- No.  - You gotta let me go, Dad.

1901
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,380
You'll have to let me go.

1902
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,500
- You have to.  - Ron.

1903
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,620
Ron, Ron! Let him go.

1904
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:34,660
Just come back!

1905
02:02:35,370 --> 02:02:36,670
- Come on!  - Come on!

1906
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:37,870
Mikaela, Mikaela!

1907
02:02:37,870 --> 02:02:39,620
- Go with my parents.  - I'm not gonna go with them.

1908
02:02:57,700 --> 02:03:00,450
- We got Jordanians!  - We got help!

1909
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:07,730
Get dowm

1910
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:25,530
You okay, soldier?

1911
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,570
We're gonna help you, soldier.

1912
02:03:27,870 --> 02:03:29,660
Let's get being moon and clear the birds!

1913
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,240
Stay still, stay still. Don't move.

1914
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:32,820
You alright, young man?

1915
02:03:33,070 --> 02:03:34,200
- You have a radio?  - Yes.

1916
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:37,700
Hey kid, it's been nice knowing you.

1917
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:39,780
Remember what I did for my country.

1918
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:42,700
This is my moment.

1919
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:45,110
You're crazy!

1920
02:03:47,110 --> 02:03:48,950
ETA to station, two minutes.

1921
02:03:48,990 --> 02:03:50,860
- Put it on the main screen.  - Sir, yes, sir.

1922
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:52,150
Predator's air-one.

1923
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:04,070
Oh shit, it's a trick.

1924
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:06,570
Commence Operation Firestorm. Send everyone.

1925
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:09,440
- Get those boys out of the ground.  - This is 101 in strike packages.

1926
02:04:09,490 --> 02:04:11,110
Fast course river. Execute lightly.

1927
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,520
- Spotted Sam.  - Hurry, don't slow up!

1928
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:35,810
Ironhide!

1929
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:38,770
Follow us to the pillars. We'll take you to Optimus.

1930
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:39,400
Look out!

1931
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:44,730
Sam, get to the pillars!

1932
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:46,730
Let's go.

1933
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:54,100
Oh God, this is it. The pyramids built right over the machine.

1934
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:55,600
They turn that machine on...

1935
02:04:57,310 --> 02:04:58,350
no more Sun.

1936
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:02,390
Not on my watch.

1937
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:05,560
Not on my watch.

1938
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:19,270
- USS Stennis, identify.  - Hey, where the hell are you?

1939
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:20,310
What, you're on a weather channel?

1940
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:22,390
Sports center, high-dreaming TV or something?

1941
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:24,100
We get a pretty hundred satellites up there.

1942
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:26,600
Where the hell are all our men?

1943
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:28,390
Identify yourself.

1944
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:29,970
What is your name, sailor?

1945
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:35,600
Wilder, Captain of the USS John C. Stennis Aircraft Carrier.

1946
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:38,270
Okay, Captain Wilder, 

1947
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:40,760
this is Agent Seymour Simmons, head of the Sector Seven.

1948
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:43,260
There is a mother of all non-biologicals

1949
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:45,100
getting ready to blow up our Sun.

1950
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:46,970
You want to have fooled down about my lack of clearance, 

1951
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:49,260
or you want to help save a gazillion lives?

1952
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:52,260
Alright, Agent Simmons. I'm listening.

1953
02:05:59,470 --> 02:06:00,800
Five klicks.

1954
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:02,260
West of the gulf.

1955
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:05,220
We got ourselves a dalion remodelling a pyramid.

1956
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:08,720
I want hopes of prototype weapon pull a rail gun.

1957
02:06:10,050 --> 02:06:11,340
That's classified.

1958
02:06:11,590 --> 02:06:15,470
Don't talk to me about classified, alright?

1959
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:17,220
Now if you've got a battleship in the gulf, you'll do.

1960
02:06:18,130 --> 02:06:21,050
you tell him to ready that weapon!

1961
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:24,470
Contact Destroyer, USS Kit.

1962
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,550
This way! Move it!

1963
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:32,300
- What you need is there?  - Form attack.

1964
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,470
Let's go! Go!

1965
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:39,800
Give me your talk. Come on.

1966
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:40,460
Epps!

1967
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:46,670
Right now, we need air support.

1968
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,130
That ship's in contact. 20 miles...

1969
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:51,750
Grid on contact. Proceed 88, Alpha Sierra.

1970
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:58,840
USS Stenin 0-9-0, you are approved to drop a 2,000...

1971
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,290
- What you got?  - A detonator, sir.

1972
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:10,330
They're 600 minutes away and they're heading right for the pillars.

1973
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:11,040
Alright.

1974
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:13,170
Precious cargo's coming.

1975
02:07:13,460 --> 02:07:14,250
Move!

1976
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:41,750
Sam!

1977
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:43,210
Spotted Sam.

1978
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:15,870
Come on!

1979
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:18,700
2-2, covering fire. Two civilians, twelve o'clock.

1980
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:27,990
Cover for us.

1981
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:38,030
Okay, air strike. We'll rescue the civilians.

1982
02:08:57,570 --> 02:08:59,440
Come on. Get up!

1983
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:00,360
Come on!

1984
02:09:01,650 --> 02:09:02,360
Get in here.

1985
02:09:03,190 --> 02:09:04,360
Oh look who showed up.

1986
02:09:04,610 --> 02:09:06,690
You better have a good reason for us to be here.

1987
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:07,650
Where's Optimus?

1988
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:09,690
He's right over there, across the courtyard.

1989
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:11,690
I got to get to him right now.

1990
02:09:11,730 --> 02:09:13,150
No, we got an air strike coming.

1991
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:14,650
I have to get to him right now.

1992
02:09:16,730 --> 02:09:18,190
Come here, b-back.

1993
02:09:28,230 --> 02:09:29,820
Incoming!

1994
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:36,770
Behold to the only Jetfire!

1995
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:41,600
Now let me show you how we brought them pain in my day.

1996
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,980
Too old for this crap.

1997
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:04,060
Keep going.

1998
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:05,390
15 minutes of fighting.

1999
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:29,390
I am directly below the enemy's scrotum.

2000
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:32,350
25.7 metres above sea level, 

2001
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:33,560
29.32 north.

2002
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:35,760
- Field track, 5-2, 0500 o'clock.  - Target acquired.

2003
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:36,970
Killing track two.

2004
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:38,970
Lock. Fire.

2005
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:55,930
Yeah! Yeah!

2006
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:57,890
B-1, stand on my target. 30 seconds...

2007
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:01,890
We're gonna make a break for the beast on my command, okay?

2008
02:11:01,930 --> 02:11:03,800
You guys stick with me, you understand?

2009
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,090
You stay on my ass.

2010
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,550
Hope these F-16s got good aim.

2011
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:09,470
Yeah, why is that?

2012
02:11:09,890 --> 02:11:11,510
I told them to hit the orange smoke.

2013
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:14,510
You mean that orange smoke?

2014
02:11:15,010 --> 02:11:16,760
It wasn't my best toss, okay?

2015
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:20,010
- Run!  - Run!

2016
02:11:28,470 --> 02:11:30,010
Incoming!

2017
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:33,710
Come on.

2018
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:08,750
Die!

2019
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:17,080
Sam!

2020
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,000
Hold your fire!

2021
02:12:37,210 --> 02:12:37,830
Sam!

2022
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:42,250
Get out! Get me an EVAC.

2023
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:46,410
Can't you do something?

2024
02:13:21,530 --> 02:13:23,570
- Sam! Sam...  - Sam!

2025
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:32,780
Come on, we got to move. We got to move! Come on!

2026
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:38,860
Sammy!

2027
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:46,150
Clear! Take a shot. Clear! Take a shot.

2028
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:47,400
One, two, three.

2029
02:13:50,530 --> 02:13:51,150
Do it again.

2030
02:13:57,290 --> 02:13:59,120
Sam!

2031
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:06,120
Okay, listen to my voice. I love you and I need you.

2032
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:12,280
Please, please come back to me. Sam, please! I love you!

2033
02:14:24,170 --> 02:14:26,010
Am I dead?

2034
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:31,090
We have been watching you. A long, long time.

2035
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:35,420
You have fought for Optimus, 

2036
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:40,090
our last descendant, with courage and with sacrifice.

2037
02:14:40,130 --> 02:14:42,760
The virtues of a leader.

2038
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:46,340
A leader worthy of our secret.

2039
02:14:46,630 --> 02:14:49,550
The Matrix of Leadership is not found.

2040
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:51,500
It is earned.

2041
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:54,880
Return now to Optimus, 

2042
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:57,750
merge the Matrix with his Spark.

2043
02:14:58,420 --> 02:15:03,130
It is, and always has been, your destiny.

2044
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:08,920
Sam.

2045
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:16,620
I love you.

2046
02:15:55,490 --> 02:15:58,410
Boy, you returned for me.

2047
02:15:59,870 --> 02:16:01,870
A living Prime!

2048
02:16:03,410 --> 02:16:05,830
I don't believe it.

2049
02:16:16,030 --> 02:16:18,410
My Matrix.

2050
02:16:23,910 --> 02:16:25,200
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

2051
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:27,700
Get up, Prime!

2052
02:16:29,490 --> 02:16:32,990
- Oh, no.  - He's turned on the machine.

2053
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:35,490
You gotta stop him. Get up!

2054
02:16:35,820 --> 02:16:37,360
Optimus!

2055
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:41,950
Fallen, my master.

2056
02:16:42,110 --> 02:16:46,450
My brothers could not stop me from this.

2057
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:52,030
- Yes.  - Now I claim your sun.

2058
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:56,570
Enemy target, top of pyramid.

2059
02:16:56,570 --> 02:16:58,690
Engage, engage, engage.

2060
02:17:04,070 --> 02:17:06,980
In moments, we'll be at siren strength.

2061
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:27,270
I never did a thing worth doing until now.

2062
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:30,730
Optimus, take my parts.

2063
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:33,860
And you'll have a power you've never known.

2064
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:36,940
Fulfill your destiny.

2065
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:45,230
Jolt, electrify!

2066
02:18:05,810 --> 02:18:07,480
Let's roll.

2067
02:18:09,930 --> 02:18:11,810
Fire. Take it off to the pyramid!

2068
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:27,520
This planet will be dark forever.

2069
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:52,100
Die like your brother.

2070
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:55,010
They were your brothers too.

2071
02:19:23,670 --> 02:19:25,970
First gra...

2072
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:40,920
You picked the wrong planet!

2073
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:45,840
Give me your face.

2074
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:58,460
I rise. You fall.

2075
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:03,750
No. No.

2076
02:20:05,250 --> 02:20:09,960
Not to call you a coward, Master, but sometimes, 

2077
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:13,710
cowards do survive.

2078
02:20:14,250 --> 02:20:16,170
This isn't over.

2079
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:46,450
You took all of this for you to tell me that you love me.

2080
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,660
You said it first.

2081
02:21:41,070 --> 02:21:43,490
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.

2082
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:45,530
You're welcome.

2083
02:21:46,990 --> 02:21:48,740
Thank you for believing in me.

2084
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:58,110
Our races united by a history long forgotten.

2085
02:21:58,110 --> 02:22:01,400
And a future we shall face together.

2086
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:06,400
I am Optimus Prime, and I send this message

2087
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:09,650
so that our past will always be remembered.

2088
02:22:09,650 --> 02:22:13,730
For in those memories, we live on.

2089
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:39,520
So glad you can join us, Professoer Einstein.

2090
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:41,530
Yeah, I was kind of busy.

2091
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:45,540
OK.
