00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,080
嗨 美眉
Hey, beautiful.

139
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,610
- 我们分手吧 山姆
- 真的吗?
- I'm breaking up with you, Sam. - Really?

140
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,120
你确定吗? 我觉得你没下狠心啊
You sure? I hear a lot of conviction.

141
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,540
我下狠心了 行吧?
Well, I am, okay?

142
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,800
所以这一次我就不用来送你了
So there's no reason for me to come say goodbye to you.

143
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
哇啊 你这回是来真的
Wow, you almost sounded serious that time.

144
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,360
知道吗?
Guess what?

145
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,620
我要送你一套异地恋爱装备
I made you a long-distance relationship kit.

146
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,580
对 有个摄像头 我们随时都可以聊天
Yeah, I got you a webcam so we can chat 24/7.

147
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,970
爱你无处不在
All Witwicky all the time.

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,350
还有些上次战斗的纪念品
I got you a couple of souveniers

149
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,320
你说在电话里不能说的
that you bet that cannot be mentioned on cellphone.

150
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,020
还有唱片啊 蜡烛什么的...
Some mixes and candles and stuff...

151
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,430
真可爱 我等不及了
Sounds cute, I can't wait.

152
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,430
哦 嘿!
Oh, hey!

153
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,250
我那次穿过的T恤要吗?
You want the infamous D-Day shirt?

154
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,700
那件破衣服还留着呢?
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

155
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,020
是啊 当然得留着 米卡拉
Yeah, of course I kept it, Mikaela.

156
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,180
这可是我的战袍 浸透着鲜血啊
It's like my Superbowl jersey. I bled in this thing.

157
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,780
哇啊 你口气不小呀 嗯?
Wow, you're pretty confident, huh?

158
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,020
不 不是那样的
No, it's not that.

159
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,500
我向来没什么自信 刚才只是一个小高潮罢了
It's just that my low self-esteem's at an all-time high.

160
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,480
你以为那些个小纪念品
Do you think your little box of souveniers

161
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,960
就能留住我的心了
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

162
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,320
你真该和我一起走
You really should come with me,

163
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,130
学校旁边房子很便宜
they got cheap apartments in campus.

164
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,060
呃 这个现在不太可能
Well, that's not gonna happen

165
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,260
除非我那不省心的老爸走上正道
until I get my man child father rushed out of prison,

166
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,450
能养活自己了才行
back on his feet.

167
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,680
我可听着呢
I heard that.

168
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,960
离合器盖子在哪儿?
Where did you put the clutch covers?

169
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,210
凸轮轴旁边
Next to the cam shafts.

170
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,600
我就喜欢你说这术语 再说一遍
I love it when you say cam shafts. Whisper it to me.

171
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,770
凸轮轴
Cam shafts.

172
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,110
天 我对你恨不起来
God, I hate you.

173
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,130
这是家传的魅力
It's my Witwicky charm.

174
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,420
喂 别挂 稍等一下
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

175
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,080
我觉得我们不会分手
I guess we're not breaking up.

176
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,610
二十分钟后见
I'll be over in 20.

177
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,540
米卡拉...
Mikaela...

178
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,340
我衬衫里有块方块的碎片
I think this little bit Cube got stuck on my shirt.

179
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,560

我哪儿都不跟你去
I don't wanna go anywhere with you.

189
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,810
我没心情跟你去法国

我连遛弯都懒得跟你去
I don't wanna go around the corner with you.

- Alright, fine. - I'm just going back inside.

I know, and if it was up to me, I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

240

我很难受 兄弟
This is hard enough, man,

245
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,280
别让我更难受了 你就看着我 好吗?

246
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,890
别这样 伙计

你应该回去找同伴们

It's not the last time I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.

254
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,680
得了 别这样 伙计 别逼我行吗 大黄蜂
Come on, don't do that. Bee. You're killing me, Bee.

255
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,390
但你永远是我的第一辆车
But you'll always be my first car.

256

你觉得没我
So you think you can make it

262
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,170
也可以度过大学几年 是吧?
through those East Coast winners without me?

263
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,940
你的地位无人能及
You're like the best thing that ever happened to me.

264
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,490
然后呢?
And?

265
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,410

That's not the word that I wanna hear really now.

270
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,940
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

271
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,930
意思还不都一样
It's the same word as the other word.

272
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,980
- 当然不一样
- 听着 我现在即便说了
- It's not the same word. - Look, if I said the other word now,

273
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,390
也是你逼我说的
you forced me to say won't mean anything.

274
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,370
你也从没说过那个字
Plus, you haven't said it either.

275
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,950
所以不许冲我发火
So don't get mad at me for not saying it.

276
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,640
对 我是没说
Yeah, but I haven't said it

277
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,440
因为男生只想逃避责任
because guys always run when you say it first.

278
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,490
对 女生也一样啊
Yeah, well, so do girls.

279
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,270
而且你又不怕没人追
Especially, girls like you with options.

280
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,360
你为了不让我离开
So this is all part of your elaborate plan

281
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,530
才故意不表白 是吧?
to keep me interested?

282
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,080
算是吧
Can be.

283
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,290
不是挺有效的吗?
Ain't those working?

284
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,130
吻一下
Have a kiss.

285
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,290
我们可以的 我保证
We'll make it work, I promise.

286
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,900
那女人有方块碎片

287
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,900
全体霸天虎注意 跟着她
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

288
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,540
夺回碎片
Retrieve it.

289
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,620
"巢穴"部队: 迭戈·加西亚岛军事基地

290
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,020
汽车人双胞胎到三号机库报到
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

291
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,300
破冰淇淋车过来啦

292
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,760
借过 过一下
Excuse me, excuse me.

293
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,430
嗨 这晚上过的 是 宝贝 该升级了
Hello. What a night. Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

294
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,460
对 哦 对 看这儿 快点 就这儿
Yes, oh, yeah. Look here. Come on, let me call right here.

295
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,600
这不是我的老相好嘛
Time to get my sexy on.

296
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,430
绿的 我就知道
Green, I know,

297
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,930
绿的是我的 我要绿的
Green is mine, I call green.

298
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,860
做我的身体吧
Be my body

299
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,060
- 我要绿色
- 疼死我了
- I got the green. - That hurt, man.

300
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,850
当然疼啦 踹的就是你
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass kicking.

301
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,160
(全体立正)

302
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,630
盖洛威顾问 幸会
Director Galloway, what an honor.

303
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,450
我本想带你转转
Let me show you around

304
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,130
但你无权进入绝密区
but you gotta be in the classified access list.

305
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,820
现在可以了
I am now.

306
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,270
总统亲自授权的 少校
Presidential order, Major.

307
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,510
我奉命带话给你那些神秘的外星朋友
I got a message for your classified space buddies.

308
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,310
你们在上海的行动搞砸了
You guys made a mess at Shanghai.

309
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,780
对吧 所以上边用来连线参谋长联席会议
Alright, so this is where we communicate with the JCS.

310
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,520
而这片区域是汽车人的车库
And this area serves as the Autobots' hangar.

311
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,700
与参谋长专线接通 少校
Secured line to JCS is up, Major.

312
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,090
美军军用卫星

313
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,630
现在是五角大楼安全专钱
Secured line to the Pentagon now.

314
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,990
看了上海的行动 是艰难的一天啊
Saw the Shanghai op. It was a rough day.

315
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,820
是 长官
Yes, sir.

316
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,060
我有情报需要直接进行汇报
We have intel that I believe warns an immediate debrief.

317
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,510
你既然同意 我不能让你看到他
Now with your permission, I can't let you see him

318
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,810
但我可以向你转播擎天柱的声音
but I would like you to hear from the leader of the Autobots.

319
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,790
开始吧
Proceed.

320
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,490
你肯定在想
You gotta wonder.

321
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,840
如果说上帝造了人 谁造了它?
God made us in his image. Who made him?

322
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,640
将军 我们的联军今年已打退霸天虎的六次入侵
General, our alliance has countermanded 6 Decepticon incursions this year.

323
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,240
在每个大洲都有交手
Each on a different continent.

324
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,170
他们肯定是在找寻什么
They're clearly searching around the world for something.

325
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,600
但昨晚我们消灭的霸天虎留了这么一句狠话：
But last night's encounter came with a warning:

326
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,510
"堕落金刚还会东山再起的"
The Fallen shall rise again.

327
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,710
"堕落金刚" 什么意思?
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

328
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,710
来源: 不清楚
Origin: Unknown.

329
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,520
所有的历史
They only recorded

330
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,020
我们变形金刚所有的历史只记载于火种源之中
history of our race was contained within the All-Spark,

331
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,950
也随之一同毁灭
lost with its destruction.

332
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,970
我插一句!
Excuse me!

333
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,170
既然你所说的那个火种源现在毁灭了
If this so-called "All-Spark", now destroyed,

334
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,190
那敌人为何没按你预想
why hasn't the enemy left the planet

335
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,550
离开地球呢?
like you thought they would?

336
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,980
盖洛威先生 是美国国家安全顾问
Director Galloway, our national security advisor

337
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,860
总统派他负责联络
the President just appointed him liasion.

338
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,270
- 这太 呃...
- 呃 我怎么没有得到通知
- It's too, uh... - Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

339
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,560
很抱歉打断你 将军 借过 让一下
Forgive the interruption, General. Excuse me, coming through.

340
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,530
借过 借过...
Excuse me, excuse me...

341
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,410
上海的那次行动造成很大损失
After all the damage in Shanghai,

342
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,750
总统 呃...
the President is, uh...

343
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,080
勉强宣布行动成功
hard-pressed to say the job's getting done.

344
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:34,010
如今 我们有"外星汽车人合作秘密法案"定下合作框架
Now under the classified Alien Autobot Cooperation Act,

345
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,170
你们虽然同意与我们共享情报
you are agreeing to share your intel with us,

346
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,480
但从不共享先进武器
but not your advancements in weaponry.

347
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,140
我们已目睹你们人类的好战本性
We've witnessed your human capacity for war.

348
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,010
给你们的话 结果必将会弊大于利
It would absolutely bring more harm than good.

349
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,090
什么时候轮到你替我们考虑了?
But who are you to judge what's best for us?

350
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,260
原谅我插一句 我们和汽车人
With all due respect, we've been fighting side-by-side

351
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,790
并肩作战有两年了
in the field for two years.

352
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,950
我们出生入死 一同流血流汗
We've shared blood, sweat and precious metal together.

353
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,010
士兵 打你的仗去; 少插嘴
Soldier, you're paid to shoot; not talk.

354
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,300
你别惹我
Don't tell me.

355
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,490
而且 呃...
And the, uh...

356
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,060
- 汽车人又来一拨
- 放松...
- The newest members of your team... - Easy...

357
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,740
我知道你们是向太空中的汽车人发送了讯息
I understand they arrived here after you sent a message into space.

358
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,760
公开邀请他们来到地球
An open invitation to come to Earth,

359
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,460
但从未让政府审核过
embedded by no one at the White House.

360
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,630
我先打断你一下 盖洛威先生
Let me stop you right there, Mr. Galloway.

361
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,180
审核就在此进行
It was bedded right here.

362
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,240
而据我所知 伦诺克少校和战友们作出的判断
And in my experience, the judgement of both Major Lennox and his team,

363
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,300
总是准确的
has always been above reproach.

364
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,150
好 即便如此 将军 总统认为
Well be that as it may, General, it is the position of the President

365
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,220
眼下国家安全形势严峻
that when our national security is at stake,

366
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
没有人能保证做到完美
no one is above reproach.

367
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,020
我们不妨先回顾一下?
Now, what do we know so far?

368
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,630
我们知道霸天虎的头领
We know that the enemy leader,

369
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,420
代号NBE-1 又被称作威震天
classified NBE-1, AKA Megatron,

370
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,130
早就锈成了废铁
is resting in peace

371
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,170
埋于劳伦森海沟深处
at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss,

372
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,380
处于声纳监听系统和潜水艇
surrounded by societs detection nets

373
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,790
全天候的重重监控
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

374
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,890
我们还知道
We also know that

375
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,230
火种源的唯一残片
the only remaining piece of your alien All-Spark

376
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,310
正保存在电磁保险库里
is locked in an electromagnetic vault,

377
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,890
而这个保险库在全世界最安全的海军基地里
here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world.

378
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,830
而虽然没人...
And since no one...

379
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,080
能告诉我 敌人现在究竟在找什么
can seem to tell me what the enemy is now after,

380
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,270
但我... 至少能猜出大概
well, there...there's only one clear conclusion:

381
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,520
就是你们 汽车人
You. The Autobots.

382
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,450
他们是来追杀你们的
They're here to hunt you.

383
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,410
不然他们来地球还能为了什么?
What's there to hunt for on Earth besides that?

384
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,060
"堕落金刚... 要东山再起"?
"The Fallen... shall rise again"?

385
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,880
听上去确实要出大事
Sounds to me like something's coming.

386
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,630
那么我想问一下如果我们最终认定
So let me ask if we ultimately conclude

387
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,510
你们只有离开地球避难
that our national security is best served

388
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,470
才能确保地球的安全
by denying you further asylum on our planet,

389
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,030
你们会和平地离开吗?
will you leave peacefully?

390
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,840
你们应享有自由
Freedom is your right.

391
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,050
你们如果那样要求 我们会尊重你们的要求
If you make that request, we will honor it.

392
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,530
不过 在你们总统下决定前 请你问问他
But before your president decides, please ask him this.

393
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,530
如果你们错了 有后悔药吃吗?
What if we leave and you're wrong?

394
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,210
问得好
That's a good question.

395
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,300
哦 我的天啊
Oh, my God,

396
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,640
你看看这地方!
just look at this place!

397
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,980
感觉自己已经变聪明了
I feel smarter already.

398
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,170
罗恩 你闻到了吗?
Ron, can you smell it?

399
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,760
对 每年四万块的学费
Yes, smells like $40, 000 a year.

400
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,970
好吧 真抠门
Okay, cheapo.

401
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,360
你先去吧 我们 呃... 我们来搬
Go ahead, we'll, uh... We'll get your stuff.

402
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,730
你去看看宿舍就行
Just go ahead and check out your room.

403
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,840
- 嘿
- 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

404
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,870
你是山姆吧? 我是里奥
You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo.

405
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,570
你好
Hey.

406

我真不知道该怎么跟你说

608

00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,280
我有纸巾 纸巾擦擦脸

613
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,240
等等

614
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,670
真对不起!
I'm so sorry!

615
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,320
你想怎样?
What are you doing?

616
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,590
一天都不让我安宁 嗯?
You won't give me a day, huh?

617
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,120
- 这可是我第一天入学
- 非常抱歉 山姆
- You won't give me one day in college. - I'm sorry, Sam.

618
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,580
但火种源最后一块残片还是被偷了
But the last fragment of the All-Spark was stolen.

619
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,170
什么? 霸天虎干的吗?
Like what? Like Decepticon-stolen?

620
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,180
我们按照要求将残片交给人类的政府保管
We placed it under human protection at your government's request.

621
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,120
但我在这儿是帮助你的 山姆
But I'm here for your help, Sam.

622
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,270
因为你们的领导者认为我们把仇恨转嫁到了地球上
Because your leaders believed we brought vengeance upon your planet.

623
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,540
或许 他们是对的
Perhaps, they are right.

624
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,990
但必须要有一个双方都信任的人
That is why they must be reminded by another human

625
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,800
来时常提醒他们
of the trust we share.

626
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,870
- 这不是我的战争
- 还不是
- This isn't my war. - Not yet.

627
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,040
但我恐怖很快就会是了
But I fear it soon will be.

628
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,050
地球一定不能像塞伯坦星球那样
Your world must not share the same fate as Cybertron.

629
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,690
致使万物流离失所
Whole generations lost.

630
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,370
我知道我... 我想帮助你 真的
I know and I... I want to help you. I do.

631
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,860
但我不是你们驻地球的大使
But I'm not some alien ambassador.

632
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,560
你知道 我只是一个普通人
You know, I'm a normal kid with normal problems.

633
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,040
我做我该做的事
I am where I'm supposed to be.

634
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,500
对不起 我...
I'm sorry, I...

635
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,810
我真的很抱歉
I really am.

636
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,830
山姆 我们不能指望天意来改变自己的命运
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing.

637
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,410
你是无敌的擎天柱 你不需要我
You're Optimus Prime. You don't need me.

638
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,620
需要... 只是你不知道而已

- 没有 长官
- And no confirmed DSRVs on sight? - None, sir.

神速... 我就放心了
to hear of your... resurrection.

667
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,960
你竟然把我扔在这个垃圾星球上见死不救
You left me to die, you pathetic insect!

668
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,410
我是在扩充新的队伍
Only to help spawn our new army,

669
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,520
堕落金刚也很生气 毕竟 你不在
the Fallen decreased it, after all, in your absence,

670
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,970
总得有人来统领大局吧
someone had to take command.

671
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:55,890
你...
You...

672
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,500
太让我失望了
are so disappointing.

673
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,260
即便我死了 也轮不到别人发号施令
Even in death, there's no command but mine.

674
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,730
我的主人 此行我辜负了你
My master, I failed you on Earth.

675
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,300
火种源被摧毁了
The All-Spark is destroyed,

676
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,610
没有它 我们的种族迟早灭亡
and without it, our race will perish.

677
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,240
你还有很多要学 我的傻徒弟
You have much to learn, my disciple.

678
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,870
方块只不过是个容器
The Cube is merely a vessel.

679
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,620
它的能量和真谛永不会被摧毁
It's power, it's knowledge can never be destroyed.

680
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,660
只不过变换了形态
It can only transform.

681
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,020
- 这是怎么回事?
- 方块的能量
- How is that possible? - It has been absorbed

682
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,950
已被那男孩吸收
by the human child.

683
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:43,110
拯救我们的关键就在他的大脑里
The key to saving our race now lies within his mind.

684
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,860
那就让我把他的大脑生生给拿出来
Well then, let me strip the very flesh from his body.

685
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,840
你会的 我的徒弟 迟早会的
And you will, my apprentice.

686
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,860
千年以来 我一直梦想能回到那个毁灭的星球
In time. For millenia, I have dreamed of my return

687
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,760
那时我与汽车人还情同手足
to that wretched planet, where I too was once betrayed,

688
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:02,720
可他们竟然背叛了我
by the Primes I call my brothers.

689
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:10,250
只有超级战士才能打败我 但是现在只剩一个超级战士
Only a Prime can defeat me, and now only one remains.

690
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,960
擎天柱 是他在保护那个男孩
Optimus. He protects the boy.

691
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,400
那么这个男孩就可以带我们找到他
Then the boy will lead us to him

692
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,930
- 这个仇我一定要报
- 是的
- and revenge will be ours. - Yes.

693
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,940
那男孩跑不掉的 他一直在我们的监视下
The boy will not escape us. We have him in our sights.

694
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,210
但是不补充能量的话 这些新生儿就会死掉
Without more Energon, hatchlings will keep dying.

695
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,310
空间 时间 引力
Space, time, gravity.

696
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,040
- 谢谢
- 帮我吃完吧
- Thank you. - Finish that for me.

697
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,810
今天我和你们将要开始一段旅程
We're going on a journey together, you and I, today.

698
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,690
你们正值青春年少 难怪精力过剩
All you, eager nubile young minds on the very cusp of adulthood.

699
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,310
我是你们的伙伴 是向导 是灵魂伴侣
And I shall be your consort, your guide,

700
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,760
我能发掘你们的阴暗面
your chaperone, into the heart of darkness.

701
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,100
欢迎听我的天文课
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

702
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,520
我们对星星的了解有多少?
For what do we know about the stars?

703
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,600
处女... 处女座
Virgo... the virgin.

704
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,370
猎户座 也就是射手座
Orion, the great hunter.

705
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,560
可它们没有闪耀的钻石
These are no mere twinkling diamonds

706
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,050
供纯情少女们日思夜想
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

707
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,400
它们产生的能量规模大的惊人
No, they are diamond, filled with a throbbing,

708
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,220
随时要喷薄爆发出能量
savage and hemped-up energy.

709
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,900
来看看阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦
Behold the work of Albert Einstein,

710
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,620
那位曾和我一样的老教授的理论
a professor once, like moi,

711
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
- 能量等于质量乘以...
- 你在干什么?
- energy, in its mass temp... - What are you doing?

712
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
把手放下 把手放下
Put your hand down, put your hand down.

713
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,480
年轻人 我的课
Young man, there are no questions

714
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,580
到课堂高潮的时候再提问
until I've reached the climax of my lecture.

715
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,920
我看完了你的书 只有一个问题
I've just finished your book. There's only one problem.

716
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:49,950
爱因斯坦错了
Einstein's wrong.

717
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,540
一维空间中能量是等于质量乘以速度的平方
Energy doesn't go mass times velocity light square

718
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,850
那其它十七维空间呢
in this dimension. What about the other 17

719
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,310
没人讨论这些?
while we're impossible to give 17?

720
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:58,860
举例来说:
A clear example:

721
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,650
如果将能量晶体分解 并假定一个常量的衰减速率

722
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,850
通过反射那些领导者反射的信号

723
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,620
就能为交互空间能量发生得出一个公式

724
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,920
质量和光速不可能如此解释...

725
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,550
大家都说说 没有人同意我吗...
Come on, guys, I can't be the only one in class...

726
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,220
小伙子 你不能当着系主任的面羞辱我
Young man, I will not be punked in front of the dean.

727
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,650
听好 这里我说了算 知道吗?
No, this is my universe here. Do you understand?

728
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,310
我就是一切 我就是神灵
I am the Alpha and the Omega.

729
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,680
- 立刻给我出去
- 是 先生
- Get out of my class. - Yes, sir.

730
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,300
各位 还有谁还打算当堂精神崩溃?
Any one else care to have some sort of mental breakdown?

731
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,840
嗨 大骨头 嗨!
Hi, Bones. Hi!

732
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,730
嗨! 哦 好 真是个乖孩子
Hi! Oh yes, that's a good boy.

733
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,940
哦 你今天真乖 太乖了
Oh, what a good boy, you are.

734
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,880
嘿 大骨头
Hey, Bones.

735
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,730
你饿吗?
You hungry?

736
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:14,880
快吃吧
Here you go.

737
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,300
- 好 萨姆尔
- 喂? 米卡拉
- Yes, Samuel. - Hello? Mikaela.

738
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,170
第一次视频约会你就放我鸽子
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up on our first web chat date.

739
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,460
出状况了 知道吗?
Something just happened to me, okay?

740
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,470
- 怎么 碰到美女啦?
- 不 不 不
- Wait, you finally hit puberty? - No, no, no,

741
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,490
不不 别开玩笑 说真的
Stop laughing. This is serious.

742
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,400
好啦 记得我提到过
Okay, remember I was telling you about

743
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,420
我曾曾曾祖父吗 阿奇巴德·维基?
my great-great-grandfather, Archibald Witwicky?

744
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,260
记得吗?
Do you remember?

745
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,600
看着点你走哪儿去了!
Watch where you're supposed to go!

746
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,990
好的 我当时不是说吗 好...
Okay, remember I was telling you about, okay...

747
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,880
你不能停下吗... 给我看着点! 别踩着!
Can you stop... Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

748
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,930
米卡啦 好 曾曾曾祖父去了北极 对吧?
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather went to this Arctic mission, right?

749
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,790
然后他看到了威震天 威震天电了他
And he saw Megatron, Megatron zapped him

750
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,700
然后他就开始看到些疯狂的符号 对吧
and he started seeing these crazy symbols, okay.

751
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,150
呃 现在我也看到了 对不起
Well, now I'm seeing them too. Excuse me.

752
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,790
我用32.6秒看完903页天文学课本
I just wrote a 903-page Astronomy book at 32.6 seconds

753
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,290
我在课堂上精神失常得一塌糊涂
and had a meltdown in the middle of my class.

754
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,360
我看到符号了自从我...
I am seeing symbols ever since I...

755
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,550
- 自从什么?
- 自从接触方块碎片
- Since what? - Ever since I touched the Cube sliver.

756
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,650
你带着吗?
Do you have it?

757
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,330
没 我放在店里保险箱里呢? 它很安全
No, how about it's in the shop safe? It's fine.

758
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,500
米... 卡拉 不要碰它 好吗? 别碰它
Mi... Mikaela, do not touch it, okay? Don't touch it.

759
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,550
我不会碰它
I'm not gonna touch it,

760
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,370
山姆 它很好 锁着呢 没人知道位置
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away, no one knows where it is.

761
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:13,910
但我知道
But I do.

762
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,690
你性感 但你很笨
You're hot, but you're ain't too bright.

763
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,430
开工了
There we go.

764
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,620
哦 真他妈可恶!
Oh, big son of a bitch!

765
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,330
看什么看 呆瓜?
What are you looking at, Slobberpuss?

766
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,670
啊 怎么...
Ah, what the...

767
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,380
这地方简直太可怕了
This is a fricking House of Horrors.

768
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
等等
Hold on.

769
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,910
就快找到了

770
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,040
你就这么点能耐吗 嗯?
Is that the best you got, huh?

771
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,390
你就这么点能耐吗?
Is that the best you can do?

772
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,740
你想干什么 小畜生?
What are you doing here, you little freak?

773
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,720
哦 那是我的眼睛 疯女人!
Ow, that's my eye, you crazy bitch!

774
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,210
还不快交代?
You gotta talk now?

775
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,430
我... 堕落金刚叫我找方块里的真谛
I... I seek knowledge of the Cube. The Fallen demands me.

776
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,240
什么真谛?
What knowledge?

777
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,250
你有碎片 我需要它 把它给我 给我碎片
You got the shot, I need the shot, give me the shot, I need the shot.

778
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,130
把它给我 他们会宰了我的
Give me the shot, they're gonna whack me,

779
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,450
我拿不到碎片他们会杀了我
I'm gonna be dead without that shot.

780
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,590
轻点 美女小战士 我只是替人卖命的小角色
Easy Warrior Goddess, I'm just a little salvage scrap drone.

781
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,480
那就做你的噩梦吧
Then I'm your worst nightmare.

782
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,670
嘿 嘿!
Hey, hey!

783
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,440
- 那是什么东西?
- 回头再说
- What the hell was that? - I'll tell you later,

784
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,010
电话里不方便 知道吗?
just not on open phone line, okay?

785
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,080
我现在就去机场 今天下午就能到了
I'm gonna get on a plane right now. I'll be there later this afternoon.

786
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,260
小心点 山姆
Just be careful, Sam.

787
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,310
今天有没有陌生人让你带可疑物品?
And have any stranger giving you anything suspicious to carry on today?

788
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,770
对 一个大盒子!
Yeah, a large box!

789
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,510
- 没有
- 很好
- No. - Good.

790
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,980
符号 那些符号

791
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,790
少校 汽车人发来求救信号
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots.

792
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,570
多个霸天虎开始行动 正在接近美国东部 长官
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion. Vicinity eastern United States, sir.

793
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,510
- 哈斯文 他们有多少?
- 还不清楚 长官
- Hansvin, how many? - Unclear, sir.

794
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,390
那 快点弄清楚
Well, get clear.

795
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,890
汽车人出动了 他们分成两个小分队 长官
Autobots on the move. Splitting them into two teams, sir.

796
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,570
它们不回应呼叫 在向纽约和费城开进
Unarching their course, somewhere heading to New York and Philadelphia.

797
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:23,180
好的 全副武装 二十分钟后起飞!

It's like getting humped in the neck by a mountain ox.

851

你不该把舌头放她嘴里
You didn't have to put your tongue in her mouth.

852

听着 是她把五尺长舌头伸进我胃里了?
Look, you ever had your stomach tounged by a mountain ox with a 5-foot tong?

It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela.

你真是个小女孩
You're such a little girl.

857

我们俩先沉默十秒钟 现在

咱们一刀两断!
This is over!

866
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,220
她把脏舌头伸你嘴里了?
Did she finally led you to orbits?

867
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,830
进去了? 她真做了 真进去了?
You threw a broom? She did it, she went in it?

I am the only one who everybody can spit, okay?

872
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,030
我可是关键
I'm the key to this.

873
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,780
外星人; 他们找来是因为我的网站
Aliens; they want me because of my site.

但首先我们有些细致的工作要做

我怎么能把你的胳膊掰断

医生 来检查一下这个外星物种

去那边
Go that way.

915

这些符号能指引我们找到能量源
These symbols can lead us to the Energon source.

918
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,940

我知道你生气
I know you're pissed.

923
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,410
你生气是因为我想杀你 这是误会
Because I tried to kill you and it's completely understandable.

924
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,990
有人想杀我的话 我也会郁闷的
Somebody tried to kill me, I'd be upset too.

925
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,520

1064
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,620
- 叫他们放下枪
- 叫汽车人先放
- Tell them to lower the weapons. - Tell them first.

1065
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:12,760
- 让他们放下武器!
- 少校 我也无能为力
- Tell them to lower the weapons! - Major, there's nothing I can do.

1066
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,580
你自己和他说吧
Talk to him.

1067
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,730
你的队伍解散了 少校
US teams deactivated, Major.

1068
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,870
停止对霸天虎的一切对抗行为
You are decease anti-Decepticon operations,

1069
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,280
返回迭戈·加西亚基地 还有别的指示吗?
and return to Diego Garcia. Any further orders?

1070
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,530
不 我们直接听从墨邵尔将军的命令
No. We take our orders direct from Chairman Morshower.

1071
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,740
好吧 我会见你的领导和参谋首长
Well, I'll see your chairman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1072
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,100
我有总统的手令 你别无选择
but I will raise you a President of the United States.

1073
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,780
你现在必须听我的命令
I have operational command now.

1074
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:32,140
外星人跑到我们星球复仇
An alien blood feud has been brought to our shores

1075
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,870
却要我们的战士遭殃
for which our soldiers are paying the price.

1076
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,340
真相大白了 我们也参战了
The secret is out. This is our war now.

1077
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,210
我们会再次赢得胜利
And we will win it as we always have,

1078
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,490
靠的是全面的军事策略
with a coordinated military strategy.

1079
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,170
这个蠢货完全想歪了
This fool is terribly misinformed.

1080
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,920
这些战士你全都需要
You're gonna get every assets that you've got.

1081
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,660
我需要的是作战计划
What we need is to draw our battle plans.

1082
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,040
尽一切可能的外交解决途径
What we explore every possible, diplomatic solution.

1083
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,450
比如什么: 交出那个孩子吗?
Like what: Handing over the kid?

1084
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,530
这也不是没有可能
All options are being considered.

1085
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,290
毕竟霸天虎都跟来了
Whatever the Decepticons are after,

1086
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:59,110
这只是个开始
this is just the start.

1087
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,860
等等 绝不能和他们谈判
Wait, there is no negotiating with them.

1088
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,530
你被解职了
I'm ordering you to stand down.

1089
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:03,960
不再需要这个了
You won't be needing this any more.

1090
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,370
带着你的宝贝们
Get your assets back to base.

1091
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,490
和那堆废铜烂铁回基地去
Take that scrap metal back to Diego Garcia.

1092
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:12,150
我们走
Let's go.

1093
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,110
我真的不喜欢那哥们
I really don't like that dude.

1094
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,570
他是个疯子
He's a asshole.

1095
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,240
汽车人 请到机库报到
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

1096
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:23,070
铁皮 我们该离开这个星球
Ironhide, we should leave this planet.

1097
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,630
但擎天柱并不希望这样
That's not what Optimus would want.

1098
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,560
你已经尽力了
There's nothing that you could have done.

1099
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,460
- 你还好吗?
- 还好
- You okay? - Yeah.

1100
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,450
伙计 我能理解 如果你恨我
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.

1101
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,470
我弄砸了
I messed up.

1102
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,880
对不起
I'm sorry.

1103
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:16,630
- 年轻人 你是...
- ...我这辈子最在意的人
- Young fella, you are... - ...person I care about most in my life.

1104
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:19,470
- 只要你需要我...
- 我不会离你很远的
- If there's anything you need... - I won't be far away.

1105
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,120
他是因为我才死的
He's dead because of me.

1106
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,610
他保护了我 可他却死了
He came in to protect me instead.

1107
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,640
有些事情你无法改变
There's some things you just can't change.

1108
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,150
这样他的牺牲...
So this sacrifice was...

1109
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,880
才不会失去意义!
will not have been in vain, hallelujah!

1110
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,180
这一回我决不退缩
We make it right when we turn myself in.

1111
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,400
但我们 我们要团结在一起
But we, we've got to stick together.

1112
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,790
你不会来真的吧?
You're not gonna do that.

1113
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,060
是的 我会的
Yes, I am.

1114
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,870
不然我们的努力全白费了
Everything we worked for will be wiped out.

1115
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,100
一天内
In one day.

1116
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,250
- 你们俩
- 嗯?
- You two. - Huh?

1117
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,980
嘿 认得吗?
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1118
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,530
这些是我脑子里的符号
The symbols that have been rattling around in my head.

1119
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,120
那是古老符号 嘿
That's old school, yo.

1120
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,290
应该是... 古塞伯坦语
That's like... That's Cybertonian.

1121
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:09,900
哦 这肯定有什么重要的含义
Oh, that's some serious stuff in there.

1122
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,560
他们肯定有什么意思 比如信息...
They gotta mean something, like a message...

1123
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,940
或者 也可能是... 是地图!
or, like a... like a map!

1124
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,520
能找到能量源的地图
Like a map to an Energon source.

1125
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,290
能读懂吗?
Can you read this?

1126
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:17,120
- 读? 不会
- 你看到吗?
- Read? Nah. - You see that?

1127
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,710
不 我们... 我们不怎么会读
No, we... we don't really do much reading.

1128
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,000
- 不太会
- 那你们如果不懂
- Not so much. - Well if you can't read it,

1129
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:21,940
那就找懂的人去
we gotta find somebody who can.

1130
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,020
哦 看 胆小鬼又回来了
Oh, look, who came stashing and back.

1131
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,710
看他发型多搞笑呀 那儿 看
Hair grown like a chip, there, look it.

1132
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,890
伙计 我刚才是被吓坏了 行了吧?
I had a bit of a mild panic attack earlier, alright?

1133
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,850
那是因为你跟女人似的
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

1134
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,890
我跟你们一路过来
I think I'm allowed that considering what I've been through

1135
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,450
而且... 听说有问题
and... I heard you have a problem.

1136
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,100
我想我能找人帮忙
I think I know someone who can help.

1137
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,690
- 谁?
- 机器战士网站
- Who? - Robo-Warrior.

1138
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:41,730
这人 机器战士...
This guy, Robo-Warrior...

1139
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:44,320
一切跟外星人有关的 他都知道
Everything about anything alien, he's supposed to know.

1140
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,720
有一次我黑他网站时
One time we hacked this site

1141
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:50,400
好像 看见过 呃...
这种汽车外星人的符号之类的
and maybe, I saw some of your, uh... alien drawings or whatever.

1142
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,760
就这儿了
This is it.

1143
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,100
嗯 便利店 很好的掩护所
Yep, deli. Good front.

1144
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,970

Alright, wait here. I'll give you the go/no go, alright?

1145

三角肉包套餐好了... 给...

只收现金 下一位?
Cash only. Who's next?

1147
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,690
我说过鲑鱼先用盐水泡再烟熏
I told you put the salmon in the salt and then smoke.

1148
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,850
妈 你想折磨死我啊?
Ma, you want me to cut my handle off or what?

1149
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:24,930
- 你要了块非常差劲的鱼
- 我的刀功很棒 就跟忍者一样
- You order a terrible piece of fishing. - I'm like a ninja, with a blade.

1150
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,010
给我闪开!
Get out of here!

1151
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:28,430
嘿 山姆! 规矩点 嗯?
Hey, Sam! Watch your reach, huh?

1152

拿个号 小伙子
Take a number, young man.

1153

Know him?

1155
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,890
没听说过
I never heard of him.

1156
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,180
听说过真实的世界.com吧?
You never heard of TheRealEffingDeal. com?

1157
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:41,010
是那个超级白痴的博客网站
You must be talking about that amateur blog operation

1158
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,220
它的防火墙形同虚设
with GameBoy level security.

1159
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,430
机器战士
Robo-Warrior.

That's him.

1162
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,260
不是吧
No.

1163
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,300
开玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

1164
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,800
各位 本店打烊了 全部出去!

- 我们是老相识了
- 哇啊 老相识
- We're old friends. - Whoa, friend,

1168
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,300
就因为你 第七区撤消了编制

1169
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,840
全员遣散回老家
Got the tie-bash disbandment,

1170

没有风光的工作 没有退休金 一无所有
no more security clearance, no retirement, no nothing.

1171
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:11,300
全都因为你和你相好的女少年犯
All 'cause of you, and your little criminal girlfriend.

1172
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,840
看看她 辣妹一个
Look at her now, so mature.

1173
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,670
白痴 鳟鱼在哪儿?
Moron, where's the wifresh?

1174
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,590
别让我碰到那些肉
Don't catch me with the thing.

1175
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,000
- 亚科夫!
- 干嘛?
- Yakov! - What?

1176
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,250
再傻站着年终奖金取消
You don't get Christmas bonus just standing around.

1177
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:23,210
你还想攒钱镶新牙吗?
You want those new teeth you saw in SkyMall?

1178
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,340
- 当然了
- 那去帮帮她
- It's my dream. - Help around.

1179
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:28,000
- 你和妈妈一起住吗?
- 妈妈和我住
- You live with your momma? - No, my momma lives with me,

1180
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:28,630
这是两回事
it's a big difference.

1181
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,630
电视上全是你的照片 外星仔
They got your face all over the news, alien boy.

1182
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,750
- 好 我知道
- 那威震天还活着啊?
- Yeah, I know. - And NBE-1, still kicking, huh?

1183
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,080
这是怎么回事?
How did that happen?

1184
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,380
别回答 我不知道你的秘密
Don't answer. I don't know what you're hiding,

1185
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,670
但也不想有任何瓜葛
but I don't want anything to do with it

1186
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,040
那么 再见 只当你没见过我 我还要做事 赶紧消失
so, goodbye, you never saw me. I got bagels to schmidt.

1187
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:41,750
给我五秒钟时间
Well, give me 5 seconds.

1188
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,250
听着 等等 我要你帮忙

1189
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:45,710
真的 你要我帮忙?
Really, you need my help?

1190
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,580
我要...
I need...

1191
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,170
好吧 我差点掉了脑袋 明白吗?
Look, I am slowly losing my mind, okay?

1192
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,040
那机器人医生把设备
I had a little Crabbot, placed the device

1193
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,620
植入我大脑软组织
deep into the soft tissues of my brain,

1194
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,330
像家庭影院一样
and started projecting little alien symbols

1195
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:55,330
放映出外星语符号
like a whole freaking movie

1196
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,120
而且我还是个逃犯
and on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.

1197
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,290
你能理解吗?
So you think you got it rough?

1198
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:00,500
你脑子里的图像被投射出来?
You said it projected images of your brain?

1199
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,290
对
Right.

1200
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,250
冷冻室 快!
Meat locker, now!

1201
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,120
- 速冻肉
- 真恶心
- Dead pigs. - Yuck.

1202
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,080
你们将看到的是最高机密
What you're about to see is top secret.

1203
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,960
千万别告诉我妈
Do not tell my mother.

1204
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,210
速冻肉 会得病的
Dead pigs, swine flu.

1205
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,210
- 不好
- 现在你知道了
- Not good. - Now you know.

1206
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,120
下次吃肉的时候
Next time, you eat a goat or a pig.

1207
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,370
想想背后的故事
There's a story behind this.

1208
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,750
对 有故事
Yeah, there's a story.

1209
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,000
...你说你相信有外星人?
...you're saying you believe in aliens?

1210
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,370
好的 资料 资料
Okay, files, files.

1211
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,160
我们谈的是符号
We're talking about symbols.

1212
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,240
嘿! 还有放射性 别碰
Hey! Still radioactive. Hands off.

1213
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,790
好了 小脑瓜
Okay, Cube-brain.

1214
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,910
你看到的是这些符号吗?
Any of these look like the symbols you saw?

1215
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,120
你哪儿弄的?
Where did you get these?

1216
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,160
我被解雇之前
Before I got fired.

1217
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,700
从第七区弄到的独家资料...
I coached S-7's scrawny, drooly...

1218
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:42,780
历时七十五年的外星人研究指出了一个不容回避的事实:
75 years of alien research which points to one inescapable fact:

1219
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:47,410
变形金刚; 很久以前就来过地球
The Transformers; they've been here a long, long time.

1220
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,070
要证据吗?
How do I know?

1221
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,450
考古学家在世界各地的名胜古迹中
Archaeologists found these unexplained markings

1222
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,910
发现了这些标记
and ancient runes all over the world.

1223
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,280
中国 埃及 希腊
China, Egypt, Greece.

1224
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:58,530
1932年拍的
Shot at 1932.

1225
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:00,530
这些符号见过吗?
These the symbols you're seeing in your head?

1226
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:03,030
- 对
- 一模一样 是吧?
- Yeah. - Same ones over here, right?

1227
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:07,860
那么 告诉我 谁会留下一样的图案呢?
So, tell me, how did they end up all drawing the same thing?

1228
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,450
外星人
Aliens.

1229
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,410
而且我觉得有些人就没离开过
And I think some of them stayed.

1230
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:13,320
看看这个
Check this out.

1231
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,400
黑刀的计划
Project Black Knife.

1232
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,450
伪装的机器人一直潜伏在地球
Robots, in disguise. Hiding here.

1233
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,400
一直以来
All along.

1234
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,530
我们在全国范围内均检测到放射性物质
We detected radioactive signatures all across the country.

1235
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:27,240
我甚至下跪求第七区对此调查
I pleaded on my knees with S-7 to investigate it

1236
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,860
但他们说读数少得可以忽略
but they said the readings were infantesimal.

1237
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,530
还说我是在做梦!
That I was obsessed!

1238
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,150
我 你能相信吗?
Me, can you imagine that?

1239
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:38,570
威震天说这儿还有个能量源
Megatron said that there was another Energon source here.

1240
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,360
- 地球上? 另一个能量源?
- 地球上
- On Earth? On another source? - On Earth.

1241
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,610
好的 还有个能量源
Okay, and that these symbols,

1242
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,190
而且我这里的符号地图能够指路
the maps in my head would lead him there.

1243
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,230
你和汽车人说了吗?
Should you talk to your Autobot friends?

1244
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,440
没有 没有 没有 他们是后来的
No, no, no, the source is before.

1245
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,110
不管能量源是什么 他们比汽车人早
Whatever the Energon source is, it predates them. It's before them.

1246
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,900
- 所以比他们更早
- 对
- So it comes before that. - Correct.

1247
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:52,820
那么 报告...
Well then, report...

1248
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:54,860
除非问一问霸天虎
Unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1249
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,520
我是说 你不用跟它客气...
I mean, I'm not on speed terms or whatever...

1250
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,020
其实 我是
Actually, I am.

1251
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:04,610
让我出去!
Let me out!

1252
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,310
- 让它吃点苦头
- 打开
- It could be a little bit sad. - Open it.

1253
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,770
我找一帮霸天虎踹死你!
I'm gonna so many Decepticons on your butt!

1254
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,900

1256
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,560

- 我试试
- Can you train him? - Tried to.

1257
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,980
我花了毕生的精力寻找外星人
I spent my whole adult life, coming a plan of aliens.

1258
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,520
- 你非常愤怒...
- 而你带个外星人
- You're very furious... - And you're carrying it around

1259
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,310
却像遛狗一样

想打架吗 你这个卷毛?
Wanna throw it down, you pubic fro-head?

01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:52,990
这人是个奇迹 就像... 就像领导一样
This guy's a legend, like... like the Chairman of the Board.

1328
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,780
对 年轻人 把碎片放上去
Yo, freshman, put the shard.

1329
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,360
看看会发生什么
And watch the magic happen.

1330
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,490
哦 坏了 这是霸天虎!
Oh shit, it's a Decepticon!

1331
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,530
- 霸天虎?
- 这是什么?
- Decepticon? - What is it?

1332
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,490
快躲那边去!
Find the main tail!

1333
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:25,940
这什么陵园啊?
What sort of hideous mosalleem is this?

1334
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:30,780
回答我 你们这帮虾兵蟹将!
Semi pulls and days, show yourselves!

1335
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,030
快亮身份不然死无葬身之地!
Or suffer my infinite wrath!

1336
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,190
等-等 你们这些直立行走动物
W-wait, old spinal called based organisms.

1337
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,230
闪开!
Bugger!

1338
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,730
记住我天火的永恒光辉!
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1339
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,900
启动远程系统自控
Prepare for a systems' override.

1340
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,400
告诉你 这家伙还挺新潮
I tell you, this guy did not age well.

1341
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,270
- 他也听不到
- 我命令打开这些门
- He either heard it. - Command these doors to open.

1342
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:52,570
开火!
Fire!

1343
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,440
哦 我说了 开火!
Oh, I said, fire!

1344
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,810
蠢货
Bollocks.

1345
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:59,940
打开它 这些没用的东西...
Break that, these worthless...

1346
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,310
等一下
Wait a second.

1347
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:05,190
我屁股又痒得要命
Itching, wretching, rust in my arse.

1348
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:08,520
哦 这一回博物馆会非常生气
Oh, the museum's gonna be very angry.

1349
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,850
非常生气 我们得上飞机!
Very angry. We gotta catch that plane!

1350
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,060
我在执行任务
I'm on a mission.

1351
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:18,230
- 等-等 等等! -
等一下 等等 等等
- W-wait, wait! - Wait, wait, wait.

1352
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,230
- 嘿!
- 你们要干什么?
- Hey! - What do you want?

1353
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,400
听着 我们只想谈谈!
Look, we just want to talk!

1354
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,270
我没时间谈 我在执行任务!
I've no time to talk, I'm on a mission!

1355
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:24,140
我这样的人见人怕
I'm a mercenary goon-bringer.

1356
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,230
- 这是哪个星球?
- 地球
- What planet am I on? - Earth.

1357
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,270
地球? 真是太难听了
Earth? Terrible name for a planet,

1358
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:30,270
还不如叫"土球"
might as well call it "dirt".

1359
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:32,230
土的星球
Planet dirt.

1360
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:35,180
告诉我 机器人还在打内战吗?
Tell me, is that robot civil war still going on?

1361
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,310
- 谁赢了?
- 霸天虎
- Who's winning? - The Decepticons.

1362
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:40,560
那 我转投汽车人那边了
Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.

1363
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,980
什么意思 "转投"?
What do you mean, "changed sides"?

1364
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,980
这是个选择
It's a choice.

1365
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:47,350
这是经过激烈思想斗争的选择 消极因素太多
It's intensely personal decision. So much negativity.

1366
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,470
光靠仇恨怎么活啊?
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1367
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,600
你是说不想再跟着
Meaning you don't have to work for those

1368
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,100
那些霸天虎混了?
miserable, freaking Decepticons?

1369
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,520
霸天虎要是胜利了 将毁灭整个宇宙
If they set on their way, they destroy the whole Universe.

1370
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:58,310
我也转投汽车人了 我也转投了 我的女神雅典娜!
I'm changing sides, I'm changing sides, Warrior Goddess!

1371
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,970
- 你的小机器人呢?
- 哦 你真可爱
- Who's your little Autobot? - Oh you cutes.

1372
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:01,760
我叫小威
Name's Wheelie.

1373
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,930
来叫我名字 叫我名字!
Say my name, say my name!

1374
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:06,220
它这么乱来你都能忍?
What are you allowing to happen to your foot just now?

1375
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,470
它至少专一 山姆
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1376
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:10,140
好 它不仅是专一 还没脸没皮
Yeah, well, he's faithful, and he's nude and he's perverted.

1377
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,180
你消停会... 行吗?
Can you just... Can you stop?

1378
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:15,470
- 嘿 你在干什么?
- ...我不想多啰嗦
- Hey, what are you doing? - ...I don't wanna argue it.

1379
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,180
你在说什么?
What were you saying?

1380
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,930
我在告诉你我叫天火!
I told you my name was Jetfire!

1381
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,680
哇哦 有些人一大早心情就不好呀?
Wow, someone shit in the bed this morning?

1382
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:26,470
我情绪问题是我妈遗传的
Pretty stout with my mother.

1383
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:29,090
我的祖先来这已经几个世纪了
My ancestors have been here for centuries.

1384
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,970
我父亲他是第一代转轮! 第一代转轮!
My father, one was a wheel! The first wheel!

1385
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:34,010
- 知道他变形成什么吗?
- 不知道
- Do you know what he transformed into? - No.

1386
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:39,220
什么也变次了! 但是他死得光荣 死得其所...
Nothing! But he did so with honor, dignity and...

1387
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,680
我的助推器坏了
My boosters are fried.

1388
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,760
我觉得我们应该互相帮助
I thought we could help each other.

1389
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,260
你懂的我不懂 我懂的你不懂
You know things I don't know. I know things you don't know.

1390
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,760
- 真的
- 我觉得他什么都不懂
- I do. - I don't think he knows anything.

1391
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,920
说实话 我不知道
Honestly, I don't know.

1392
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:02,510
这些生动的符号
These vivid symbols,

1393
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,210
虽说是符号但我都记在我脑子里
they're symbols but they are in my mind.

1394
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,550
看 都在我脑子里
You see, all this is in my mind.

1395
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:07,590
威震天逼我记下来
And Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1396
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:08,880
他和一个叫堕落金刚的干的
Him and someone called the Fallen.

1397
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,420
堕落金刚? 我知道他 是他让我在这儿生锈的
The Fallen? I know him. He left me here to rust.

1398
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,840
那个霸天虎
The original Decepticon.

1399
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,340
它可不好惹 满脑子都是毁灭 混乱 危机...
He's terrible to work for. He's always apocalypse, chaos...

1400
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:20,210
他的怀疑 也是我任务的一部分
His suspects, they were a part of my mission

1401
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,000
堕落金刚要找 想起来了
the Fall and Search, I remember now.

1402
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,590
要找匕首之尖和一把钥匙
Of a dagger's tip and the key!

1403
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,710
慢点 匕首之尖 钥匙
Slow down. The dagger's tip, the key,

1404
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,170
- 你在说什么?
- 没时间说啦
- what are you talking about? - No time to explain.

1405
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,750
抓紧了 大家
Hold on, everybody!

1406
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,080
哦 那也没太糟糕
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1407
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:00,960
我看错了个星球
I was overseeing the wrong planet.

1408
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,960
嘿 太疼了!
Hey, that frickin' hurt!

1409
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:14,620
哦 天哪!
Oh, God!

1410
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:22,120
哦 我的天! 你那美丽的脸庞
这会是完美的一刻
Oh, my God! You beautiful face, this will be a perfect moment.

1411
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,200
只是你降落在了我的睾丸上
Except you landed on my testicles.

1412
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,040
拜托你下来!
Please get off!

1413
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:29,910
我的蛋!
My balls!

1414
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:32,450
山姆!
Sam!

1415
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:36,660
- 我们在哪儿? 西姆!
- 嘿! 好!
- Where are we? Simmons! - Hey! Yeah!

1416
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,780
哦 我的天
Oh, my God.

1417
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,620
这是什么? 是维加斯!
What is this? It's Vegas!

1418
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,320
- 都还好吗?
- 都好!
- You guys okay? - Yeah!

1419
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,240
嘿! 到拉斯维加斯了!
Hey! I think we're in Vegas!

1420
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,740
确实很疼
That really, really hurts.

1421
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:49,990
你很走运 我没伤着
You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt.

1422
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:52,570
这样是要死人的 知道吗? 我要是伤着了
People could've gotten killed, okay? And if I would have gotten hurt,

1423
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,740
- 我老妈会问候你...
- 哦 闭嘴!
- you would have heard from... - Oh, shut up!

1424
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:56,530
我说了要架个时空桥梁
I told you I was opening the space bridge.

1425
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:58,820
这样到埃及
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1426
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:01,320
你在说什么? 你什么都没跟我们讲!
What did you tell us? You didn't tell us anything!

1427
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,910
你什么都不说 还来埃及干吗?
You didn't tell us anything. Why are we in Egypt?

1428
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:06,570
你还敢对我那么没礼貌 小混蛋
Don't you dare slip in with me, fleshwing.

1429
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:09,490
- 我原来告诉你了
- 能听我说两句吗?
- You would do the informed. - Can you just stop for a second?

1430
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:11,450
听得清吧? 你说说为什么来埃及
Can you focus? Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1431
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:14,150
至少得让我们都有点心理准备吧?
so we can all have a little bit assemblance and peace of mind?

1432
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:17,450
这个星球我们机器人以前就来过
This planet was visited by our race once before

1433
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:20,360
第一代祖先百万年前就来过
by our earliest ancestors a millenium ago.

1434
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,400
他们的使命是收集能量块
They were on an exploratory mission to harvest Energon,

1435
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,030
那是机器人的生命之源
the life blood of our race.

1436
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:28,990
没有它我们会腐烂 氧化 生锈
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize and rust,

1437
01:28:28,990 --> 01:28:29,990
就像我这身架子
let my wretched self.

1438
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:35,190
你们知道慢慢腐朽而死有多痛苦啊?
Do you have any idea what is like a slowly fall of parton die?

1439
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:38,070
你别总跑题行吗? 老先生
Let's not get episodic, okay? Old-timer.

1440
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:43,940
从头到尾简单说出事实和细节 把来龙去脉说清楚
Beginning, middle, end. Facts, details, condense, plot, tell it.

1441
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:48,940
在沙漠的某一处地方 我们的祖先建了个巨型机器
Somewhere buried in this desert, our ancestors built a great machine.

1442
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:53,190
通过摧毁恒星来获得能量块
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1443
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,070
- 摧毁恒星?
- 把太阳炸掉?
- Destroy suns? - You mean blow them up?

1444
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:58,730
对 你看 开始的时候 曾经有七位超级领袖
Yes. You see, in the beginning, there were seven Primes,

1445
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,400
都是第一批领袖
our original leaders.

1446
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:04,440
他们进入宇宙寻找其它星系的恒星
And they set out in the Universe seeking distant suns to harvest.

1447
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,310
这些超级领袖有一个原则:
The Primes set out with one rule:

1448
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:10,480
决不摧毁有生命的星球
Never destroy a planet with life.

1449
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,560
但后来有一位违背了这项原则
Until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1450
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,810
他的名字就叫 堕落金刚
And his name, for ever more, was the Fallen.

1451
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,850
他不顾人类死活
He despised the human race.

1452
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:27,100
想启动那个机器来消灭人类
And he wanted to kill you all by turning on that machine.

1453
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:31,520
而激活它的唯一途径就是传说中的钥匙
The only way to activate it is with a legendary key

1454
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,640
也就是我们所说的原能矩阵
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1455
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:45,390
原能矩阵的归属问题引发了一场鏖战
A great battle took place over possession of the Matrix.

1456
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:52,390
堕落金刚比其他超级领袖更强大
The Fallen who was stronger at his will did,

1457
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:58,510
其他超级领袖只能偷出原能矩阵藏起来
surrendered no choice, but to steal and hide it from him.

1458
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:03,850
他们做了最后的牺牲 以生命为代价将原能矩阵封藏
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave their lives to seal the Matrix away

1459
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:07,180
藏于用他们遗体铸成的坟墓里
in a tomb made of their very own bodies.

1460
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,760
这座墓没有人知道在哪儿
A tomb we cannot find.

1461
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,010
就在这沙漠某处
Somewhere, buried in this desert,

1462
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:17,640
埋藏着那台特别的机器
that deadly machine remains.

1463
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,850
堕落金刚知道位置
The Fallen knows where it is.

1464
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:25,760
如果他找到了超级领袖的墓 你们的世界将不复存在
And if he finds the Tomb of the Primes, your world will be no more.

1465
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:27,510
那怎么阻止他?
Okay so how do we stop it?

1466
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,720
只有超级领袖能打败堕落金刚
Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen.

1467
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,300
比如擎天柱?
Optimus Prime?

1468
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:36,220
你遇到过超级领袖吗?
So you met a Prime?

1469
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,380
你遇到的肯定是超级领袖的后代
You must have met a great descendant.

1470
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:40,340
他还活着吗?
Is he alive?

1471
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:42,920
在这个星球上吗?
Here? On this planet?

1472
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,470
他为了救我牺牲了自己
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1473
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,470
那么他死了
So he's dead.

1474
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:49,510
没有超级领袖 就不可能了
Without a Prime, it's impossible.

1475
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,920
没人能阻止堕落金刚
No one else could stop the Fallen.

1476
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:55,090
这个能量若能重启那台机器...
So the same energy that's going to be used to reactivate the machine...

1477
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,800
那它能用来激活擎天柱
Could that energy somehow be used to reactivate Optimus

1478
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,800
让他重获新生吗?
and bring him back to life?

1479
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
设计之初并没这么考虑
It was never designed for that purpose,

1480
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,590
这种力量非比寻常
but it's an energy, like no other.

1481
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,710
在霸天虎抓到我之前你怎么带我们找到原能矩阵?
So then how do you get us to the Matrix before the Decepticons get to me?

1482
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,050
用你的脑子 地图 符号
Follow your mind, your map, your symbols,

1483
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,670
你在地上写的 都是线索
what you got in the sand, it's your bloom.

1484
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,960
曙光照耀在匕首之尖的时候
When dawn alights the Dagger's tip,

1485
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,800
三位国王将打开入口
three kings will reveal the doorway.

1486
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,920
找到那入口!
Find the doorway!

1487
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,460
快去!
Go now, go!

1488
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:26,710
这曾是我的使命 现在是你的使命了
That was my mission. It's your mission now.

1489
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:29,250
要在霸天虎找到你我之前
Go before the Decepticons find me

1490
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:31,250
先找到入口
and find you.

1491
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,960
中情局有线人
That was my CIA contact.

1492
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,420
说古代苏美尔人称亚喀巴海湾
Says Ancient Sumerian used to call the Gulf of Aqaba

1493
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:43,670

- 明白
- It's part of the Red Sea. - Got it.

1495
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:47,080
一刀为二分出埃及和约旦
It divides Egypt and Jordan like the tip of a blade.

1496
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:49,790
北纬29.5度 东经35度
29 and a half degrees north 35 east.

1497
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:51,000
就是这儿
There it is.

1498
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,420
好的 首先得把擎天柱给弄过来
Okay, first thing we gotta do is get Optimus to Dagger's Tip.

1499
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,040
怎么把它绕过大半个地球?
How are you gonna get him halfway around the world?

1500
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:56,750
我打个电话

1501

我不想进监狱 哥们!
I can't go to prison, guys!

1503
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:15,250
山姆 你得离开这条路 避一避
Sam, you gotta get off this road and lay low.

1504
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:27,740
兄弟 他们会发现的
Man, they'll pick up.

1505
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:30,030
这不就是忍者的伪装术嘛
This is just called blending in like a ninja.

1506
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,910
我赏你一巴掌怎么样?

It's also called the Three Kings and the reason for that is

1616

等等 等一下
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1631
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:54,650
是你在背后操纵 是吧?
You're behind this, aren't you?

1632
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:55,810
说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

1633
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,940
按广播说的办 这些人可不会胡闹
You heard the pilot. These guys don't mess around.

而且在每个降落伞边上有条带子

1648
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:41,040
用带子把扣拉开就能打开主背囊

1649

没有 没来得及说
No, he didn't even say goodbye.

He knows something.

1667

Why are we still listening to your little punk-ass?

They just haven't end like this.

1719
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:31,640
重要的是我们来这里的原因
There is a reason that we're here.

1720
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,100
我大脑里的声音和符号指引了...
The voices and the symbols in my head led us here...

1721
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:35,310
目标
for a purpose.

1722
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,310
大家跟着我 是因为我有线索
Everyone's after me because of what I know.

1723
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,680
而我所知的 就是这个管用
And what I know, is that this is going to work.

1724
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,010
你怎么知道会管用?
How do you know it's going to work?

1725
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,560
因为我相信它
Because I believe it.

1726
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:05,100
你们最好让我离开这架飞机
Best put me out of this plane.

1727
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:18,470
在放大家伙了 山姆!
He's dropping the big one. Sam!

1728
01:45:26,050 --> 01:45:28,180
你用这些黑沙子就能救擎天柱?
You think you can bring him back to life with that pixie dust?

1729
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,930
当然可以 走吧!
Absolutely. Let's go!

1730
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,420
走!
Go!

1731
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:42,720
快点!
Move it!

1732
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:44,760
记住 他们是朋友!
Remember your friendly!

1733
01:45:55,170 --> 01:45:56,340
把擎天柱隐蔽起来!
Cover Optimus!

1734
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:01,670
全村警戒 把弹药放到这来
Secure the village. Get those cases down here.

1735
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:03,750
布置狙击手和导弹
Get snipers and Stingers up high.

1736
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:06,550
我们把这十吨重的机器人
So he just dropped off ten tonnes of dead robot

1737
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:07,590
运到这不毛之地
in the middle of nowhere.

1738
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:09,960
希望这孩子心里有数
Hope this little kid know what he's doing.

1739
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,960
对 我也这么想
Yeah, me too.

1740
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,340
发现目标! 大黄蜂 四公里
Got a visual! Yellow tee, four klicks.

1741
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,630
发信号弹!
Hot-flare!

1742
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:29,000
他们在哪儿 看到吗?
That's them right there. You see the flare?

1743
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,080
就在那儿! 看到吗?
Right over there! See it?

1744
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:33,460
男孩已找到

1745
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:40,070
不
No.

1746
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:41,750
山姆!
Sam!

1747
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:55,790
哦 上帝 求求你 上帝
Oh God, please God,

1748
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:56,950
- 拜托!
- 里奥 别说了!

1749
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,290
- 不要再叫了!
- 把这家伙扔下去吧 嗯?
- Just stop freaking out! - Just drop this guy off, huh?

1750
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,950
- 求你了 让我活着 别让我死
- 闭嘴!
- Please let me live, just let me live. - Stop freaking out!

1751
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,830
马上停止尖叫 就是这样
Just stop screaming right now. That's it.

1752
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:07,370
受不了这家伙了
Can't take that guy anymore.

1753
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:21,980
用灰尘作掩护

1754
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,530
我们得分开
We gotta split up.

1755
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:33,450
大黄蜂 你上去 引开霸天虎 好吗?
Bumblebee, you are the decoy. You lead the Decepticons away, alright?

1756
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,820
我去找擎天柱
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1757
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:36,870
我和双胞胎车去把他们引开
I'll help throw their fire away.

1758
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,740
你找那些士兵去
You get to those soldiers.

1759
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:41,950
希望你能成功 孩子
I hope that dust works, kid.

1760
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:43,320
谢谢
Thank you.

1761
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,320
他转回来了
It's turning around.

1762
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,660
他回来了 他回来了
It's coming back, it's coming back.

1763
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:52,660
交给我了
It's up to me.

1764
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:55,740
一个老光棍 爱国却被抛弃
One man, alone, betrayed by the country he loves,

1765
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:58,240
可在危难时刻又成为最后的希望
now its last hope in the final hour of need.

1766
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,820
准备由一代宗师驾驶你吧
The pants are to be driven like never before.

1767
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,950
大师风范
Under my skin.

1768
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:03,940
嘿 嘿 嘿! 哪儿也别去
Hey, hey, hey! Don't go nowhere.

1769
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:06,030
- 开车! 你干不了这个 孩子
- Drive! - You will never make it, kid.

1770
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:07,700
光靠勇敢是不够的
Bravery will only get you so far.

1771
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:10,360
你电晕过我 对吗? 你欠我的
You tased me, okay? You owe me.

1772
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,400
- 我要去
- 好吧 好吧
- I'm go. - Okay, okay.

1773
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:12,900
我是考验你的 你过关了 好吗?
That was a test. You passed, alright?

1774
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,820
那东西带着霸天虎的标志
Thing's got alien tattoos all over.

1775
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:24,480
不是空军
That ain't Air Force.

1776
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:29,570
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

1777
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:31,360
- Eddy-1 收到
- 有人收到吗?
- Eddy-1, copy. - Anyone there?

1778
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,070
有人吗?
Who's up?

1779
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:33,520
- 收到
- 通信中断
- Copy. - Radio's down.

1780
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:34,980
不起作用了
It's dead. Counter that.

1781
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:36,070
电磁脉冲干扰
EMP-burst.

1782
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:39,690
看看今天在这鬼地方会发生什么
Let's see how this day is going in this godforsaken desert.

1783
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:42,480
你好 长官
Yes, sir.

1784
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,690
伦诺克少校叫我把电话转给你
Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.

1785
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:45,270
我知道 长官
I know, sir.

1786
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,980
我... 我现在在哪个国家?
W... Which, what country am I in right now?

1787
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:49,310
美利坚
United States.

1788
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:53,520
不 不 不是美国 我就是从美国来的
No, no, not the United States. I'm from the United States,

1789
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,650
鬼知道是什么地方 四周都是驴
I'm in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by goats.

1790
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:59,100
呃 那是我们的好朋友 盖洛威
Well, that was our good friend, Galloway.

1791
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:00,980
看来他有点不高兴
He's less than pleased.

1792
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:03,940
真是怪了 我们联系不到伦诺克
How is it that we can't reach our men,

1793
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:09,730
他怎么能在那寸草不生的埃及沙漠里联系到我们?
but he can reach me from some random Egyptian desert?

1794
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,140
没有
Nothing.

1795
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:18,060
发求救信号 告诉卫星我们需要帮助
Mike, put an SOS, let the eye in the sky know we need some help.

1796
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:18,730
是 长官 准备气罐
Yes, sir. Prepare the gas can.

1797
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,100
多放点烟 好让那个孩子找到我们
Pop some more flares so that the kid can find us.

1798
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,390
就是那儿 到了
There he is. We got a couple of miles.

1799
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:37,310
伦诺克的队伍拥有最先进的量子通讯器材
Lennox's team has the latest in quantum crypto gear.

1800
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:43,310
谁能告诉我为什么我们连简单的通信连接都不能够建立?
Can somebody tell me why we can't establish simple radio contact?

1801
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,680
我们正在尝试所有可用的频段和模式 长官
We're hailing them on every frequency and mode in the book, sir.

1802
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,430
那个区域的卫星已经不能工作了
Our satellites in the area have gone blind.

1803
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:48,430
我们正在努力 长官
We're working it, sir.

1804
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,600
见鬼
Dammit.

1805
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,350
想想别的方法 联系友军
Something's not right, it doesn't add up.

1806
01:49:52,350 --> 01:49:55,680
看看能否派空军前去
Contact the Jordanians, see what their assets they've got in the area.

1807
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:58,050
还有联络萨勒姆将军
And get Egypt's General Salaam,

1808
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:02,180
让他派出无人侦察机飞越那片领空
ask him to clear some US V over-flights in Egyptian airspace.

1809
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:05,220
我们现在需要各方帮助确认地点
We need an assist in confirming visuals now.

1810
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:06,890
无人机起飞
Scramble predators now.

1811
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,680
B-1号 起飞
B-1, rotate.

1812
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:21,760
还有一英里
East on the mile that way.

1813
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:28,760
来这里
Come here.

1814
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:33,170
这边
This way.

1815
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:42,170
- 一个...老光棍...
- 别再说了
- One man... alone... - Stop saying that.

1816
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,130
- 爱国却被祖国抛弃
- 哦 我的天啊
- betrayed by the country he loves. - Oh my goodness,

1817
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:46,050
我还在车里呢 好吧? 你不是一个人
I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1818
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:48,260
放松 我可是大师
Just relax, you're looking nice well.

1819
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,090
我... 我觉得他们已经被甩掉了
I... I don't think he's still following us.

1820
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:01,710
那是你觉得
That's what you think.

1821
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,920
主人 很遗憾地告诉你个坏消息
Master, sorry to be the bearer of bad news,

1822
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:25,920
他们把擎天柱运来了
but the soldiers brought the body of Prime.

1823
01:51:26,210 --> 01:51:28,500
那男孩肯定找到原能矩阵了
The boy must have the Matrix.

1824
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,460
不能让他接近擎天柱
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1825
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,830
霸天虎们!
Decepticons!

1826
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,790
我们开始攻击!
Begin our assault!

1829
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:59,120
- 有多少?
- 大概十三个
- How many? - We got 13 to count.

1830
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:02,160
不吉利 真不吉利
This ain't good. This ain't good.

1831
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:12,490
我们这回可惨了
We 'bout to get our asses whooped.

1832
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:18,030
那些霸天虎正在寻找山姆
Alright, those Decepticons are searching for Sam.

1833
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:22,580
不管怎么样 他肯定能够救活擎天柱
Whatever he has, he thinks it'll bring Optimus back to life.

1834
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:25,700
我们任务就是找到他 帮他救活擎天柱
So our mission is to find him and get him to Optimus.

1835
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,620
好 我们由左翼吸引火力 我需要侦察队
Alright, we're gonna draw fire from the left flag.

1836
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:28,660
我带队
I need a scout team.

1837
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:31,570
阿尔茜和铁皮从中路上
We'll walk through the middle with Arcee and Ironhide.

1838
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,700
当你们看到有绿色的烟雾时
Alright, when you see the precious cargo,

1839
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:36,660
就穿过那些柱子回来
I want you to pop green smoke and come back to those pillars.

1840
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,910
我们打个伏击战
We'll have the ambush set.

1841
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:39,660
好的 出发 出动!

- 出动!

- Move out! - Move out!

1843
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:51,240
看过五七年那部伯特·兰凯斯特的经典枪战片吗?
Did you see that film Gunfire Aero-Kay Karao?

1844
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,410
- 科克· 道格拉斯演的
- 没有 怎么了?
- Casting Kirk Douglas. - No, why?

1845
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:00,860
我们和他们处境一样
Looks like we're right in the middle of it.

1846
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,110
结果好吗?
Is that good?

1847
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:05,950
很多人都死了
Lot of people died.

1848
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,110
- 哦 哦 哦...
- 隐蔽起来!
- Oh, oh, oh... - Hide!

1849
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,570
我的天!
Oh my God!

1850
01:53:50,730 --> 01:53:51,810
山姆 山姆
Sam, Sam.

1851
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:56,690
蹲下 蹲下
Get down, get down.

1852
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:02,640
好 听着 我们现在以最快速度
