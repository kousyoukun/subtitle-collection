1
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,516
This is the best job I've ever had.

2
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:29,319
It better be, it's the last color.

3
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:32,000
You see, I got fired from
The Red Cab Company

4
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:35,891
and The Checkerboard Cab Company
and The Green Cab Company.

5
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,175
But this one's different, I can feel it,

6
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:45,466
even though I've only been here for about
seven days, nine hours and 37 minutes.

7
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:49,451
Oh, don't worry about him,
he's unflappable.

8
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:54,310
126, voucher pick-up, apartment 17...

9
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,860
Birds never play into the accidents,
anyway. It's usually the radio.

10
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,929
- Steve, this guy on Savannah and 29th...
- Radio is...

11
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:03,264
...keeps calling, you got problems?
- It's the radio.

12
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:06,034
Yeah. 23rd into Davenport.
You got him on the 2-4...

13
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:09,152
See? 87 last checked in at 4th and Wall,

14
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:10,805
which puts him a good 13 minutes away,

15
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,308
while 223 and 41 are both
south of the interstate,

16
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,677
which makes them much, much closer
to Division and Trent.

17
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,012
And then there's Dave
who checked in less than 10 minutes ago,

18
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:20,582
and I'm sure that he stopped
at the Starbucks on Stevens and Trent,

19
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:22,383
which just makes him
right around the corner.

20
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:25,320
I see the deployment of the entire fleet
in my mind,

21
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:28,811
and the big trouble is, I just...
I can't not see it.

22
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:49,010
- Did you see that?
- Was anyone hurt?

23
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,661
What the hell is this?

24
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,715
What is this? What's the matter
with you? You crazy or something?

25
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,483
Look at this. Look at all the...

26
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:59,120
Well, who's gonna pay for all this, huh?
I am talking to you.

27
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:02,657
- This is coming out of you, pal.
- We gotta get you home before group.

28
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,693
Yeah. Hey, don't walk away.
Come back here. You...

29
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:06,843
Oh, shoot.

30
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:11,947
I got your name now, pal.

31
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,591
Hey... Where are you...

32
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,654
Hey, where you going?
Hey, where you going?

33
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,167
You can't leave us right here.
Hey, you can't leave us here.

34
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:24,696
Hey, taxi.

35
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,641
Hi, Donald.

36
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,896
- You're late.
- Yeah, sorry I'm late, you guys.

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,033
You said that last time
and the last five times.

38
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,287
You're late to your own group.

39
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:51,852
Hey! Whoa, no.

40
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:56,960
Green!

41
00:03:57,035 --> 00:04:00,715
I got a raise at the university,
you know, 34 cents an hour.

42
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,206
Nobody cares.

43
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:04,986
Of course, it's not
technically a monsoon,

44
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,655
but 14 inches of rain in 36 hours
is nothing to sneeze at,

45
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,790
even in Sri Lanka because...

46
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:12,794
They said my writing was interesting, per
se, but it didn't fit their present needs,

47
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,062
whatever that's supposed to mean.

48
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:16,231
The Los Angeles Dodgers
have had only 16 home games

49
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,032
rained out in 41 years of baseball.

50
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:20,401
Nearly half of those rain games occurred
during the month of April,

51
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:24,072
and none have occurred
during the months of June or July.

52
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,807
I'll call my parents on the phone.

53
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,742
They're picking me up
at the bulletin board.

54
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:31,279
There's no bulletin board at the park.
You're screwed.

55
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,328
They'll never find you, ever.

56
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,318
Okay, you guys,
we're gonna leave in 10 minutes

57
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:39,587
if we're gonna make it to the park
on time to meet the others.

58
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,341
It's the 17 bus transfer to the 301.

59
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:44,939
Who needs tokens? Come get them.

60
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,384
They'll never find me, ever.

61
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,065
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time, that's just the way it is.

62
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,489
Hey, Gracie, can I see you a minute?

63
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:06,202
They'll never find me, ever.

64
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:10,218
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time, that's just the way it is.

65
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,607
We'll buy you a cab.

66
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:15,490
I got a raise at the university,
you know, 34 cents an hour.

67
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,674
Yes?

68
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:22,597
Gracie, I'm gonna run the meeting
a little differently today.

69
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:25,089
I think that when we get to the park,

70
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:30,558
I want you to gather all the women,
and I'll gather all the guys,

71
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,961
and we'll go to the bleachers...

72
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:36,177
48 is interesting, 'cause when
you add the four and the eight together,

73
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,259
you get 12.

74
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,714
And then, if you flip the four
and eight around, you get 84,

75
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,851
and then subtract the 48, you get 36, all
of which are exact multiples of the 12.

76
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,853
And 36 is interesting,
because when you add

77
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,288
the three and the six
together, you get nine,

78
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,825
and if you flip it around, you get 63,
and then minus the 36, is 27,

79
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,728
all of which are exact
multiples of the nine.

80
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:57,819
- Now, 144, if you add one...
- Why do I gather all the women?

81
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:00,851
I want...

82
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,871
I want everybody to practice
telling personal stories,

83
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:07,408
and I think that people will be less shy
without the opposite sex around, you think?

84
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:10,595
- I can tell them about my raise.
- Bad idea.

85
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:13,014
Your raise is incredibly boring.

86
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,917
As a story, it lacks dramatic tension
and narrative drive.

87
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,286
You won't hear it, you're not a girl.

88
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,211
I am, and I'm already bored.

89
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:25,240
Hey, somebody new signed up,
Isabelle Sørensen.

90
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,363
Hey, Gracie, maybe it'd be nice
if you let her start,

91
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,321
that way everybody can get to know her.
Yeah.

92
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

93
00:06:57,582 --> 00:06:58,810
I'm new.

94
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:06,986
I don't really know what to say.

95
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,727
Okay, help me out, ask me a question.

96
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,526
The candy bar Baby Ruth

97
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:22,470
was named after the daughter
of President Grover Cleveland.

98
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:27,236
He once worked as a hangman,
in Buffalo, New York.

99
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,538
No.

100
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:33,060
Don't distract me with a lot of weird-ball
stuff, 'cause I get completely lost.

101
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:36,631
He was one of the presidents
who had illegitimate children,

102
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:40,557
together with Thomas Jefferson
and Warren G. Harding.

103
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:48,660
I don't get that.

104
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:54,535
How did three guys have children together?
They didn't even live in the same century.

105
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,646
I do that. I...

106
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:08,108
I take things sort of literally.

107
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:11,833
In fact, I remember when I was a kid,

108
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:15,088
and my parents were watching
the Olympics on TV,

109
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,294
and this athlete broke a record.

110
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,529
And everybody was really excited.

111
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,778
And I thought, well, if that's all it
took to impress them, I can do that.

112
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,167
So I did.

113
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:28,015
The neighborhood kids
saw what I was doing,

114
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,053
and they started making the loud noises
that they knew I hated.

115
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,807
Monster! Monster! Monster!

116
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,372
So, I started barking
like a dog, because

117
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,246
I can do that.

118
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,690
Animals are different.
You can't teach them cruelty.

119
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,675
I don't know.
What else do you want me to say?

120
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:59,566
It's always good, you guys, to start a
story somewhere near the beginning.

121
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,633
I grew up in a nice house.

122
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:13,314
By the time I was two years old,
my parents basically got the drill.

123
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,951
I wasn't exactly what they
were looking for in a child.

124
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,148
I wasn't normal.

125
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:24,386
Quick, what's 5,589 times 3,972
divided by 17?

126
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,027
1,305,853.411,

127
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,230
et cetera.

128
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,532
See? I told you.

129
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:37,785
You know, when McDonald's says,
"13 billion served," it's not that much,

130
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:40,300
only 43 visits per person per year,

131
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:45,447
which is once every 8.49 days.

132
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:48,312
It turns out you can't control people

133
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:51,246
or even predict them.

134
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:56,257
Numbers are different.
As I used to say, you can count on them.

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,200
People with Asperger's want contact
with other people very much.

136
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,673
We're just pathetically clueless at it,
that's all.

137
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:14,436
When I was 14, I was on my own,

138
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,980
so I used to hitchhike to get around.

139
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,261
One day, this guy pulled over
in a pickup truck,

140
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:22,913
and he said that I had a pretty smile.

141
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,986
So, I got in,

142
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,957
and he raped me
before we got to the next town.

143
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,896
You see, I thought that
if I had sex with men,

144
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,278
they would want me to be around them.

145
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,270
Why would you want that?

146
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,084
Because I've had sex with women, sugar,

147
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,736
and it's so dumb. There's no dick!

148
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:51,245
- Oh, that's disgusting!
- Anybody else have a...

149
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:58,352
- Donald! Donald!
- Excuse me, guys.

150
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,187
Hey! Why are you laughing?

151
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,564
I just told you I was raped.

152
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:13,536
Keep laughing, ladies.
I don't care what my shrink says.

153
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:16,534
- I'm out of here.
- Excuse me.

154
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:19,075
Is there some sort of confusion here?

155
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:23,157
No, this is no damn confusion,
this is a fight!

156
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,205
Okay.

157
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,260
Hi, I'm Donald Morton, we haven't met.

158
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:28,596
Can you tell the difference
between confusion and a fight,

159
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,214
or are you just as dingy as they are?

160
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,300
Some of us are higher functioning
than others,

161
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,969
but that's no reason to
call anyone "dingy."

162
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:39,930
Don't condescend to these women,
they're no crazier than I am.

163
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:43,456
- Yes, we are!
- I'm weird, but I'm not strange!

164
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:48,382
You're right, this is no matter of
confusion, it's a matter of discord.

165
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:49,998
That's a nice sweater.

166
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,177
Look, this is my first time
in your little fish tank,

167
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:02,663
and I'm just giving these women
a lesson from my heart,

168
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,621
which they sorely need.

169
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,367
So then it's all about self-esteem!

170
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:09,391
You can kiss my self-esteem butt,
Donald Duck.

171
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:13,191
Why tell your life story
and tell only the good parts?

172
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,443
- It's Donald Morton.
- You're missing my point!

173
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,334
No, I'm not! I just
never know what to say.

174
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,054
Neither do I.

175
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,092
We're quite the pair, huh?

176
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,401
What's the point?

177
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:00,001
Not being alone.

178
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:04,411
Considering who we are,
what the hell is so great about that?

179
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,715
Her name is Isabelle Sørensen.

180
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,370
She has eight letters in each of her
names. I have six in each of mine.

181
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,225
This must be good luck.

182
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:56,564
I don't know why I got so angry.

183
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,935
I guess I just do that.

184
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:03,971
He yelled right back at me,
which was pretty cool, don't you think?

185
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,645
It's 3:22, that's another good sign.

186
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:14,983
That's the number of days
she is older than me, times three,

187
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,956
which makes her 966 days older than me.

188
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:25,720
He said that he never knows what to say.

189
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,798
You ever hear a guy actually admit that?

190
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:34,796
Means we were both born on Thursday,
only not the same Thursday.

191
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:41,339
Then again, he is autistic.
Did I tell you that he's tall?

192
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:44,546
Hey, Bongo.

193
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:49,684
It's nice to obsess on something
beautiful for a change.

194
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,907
Hello. Hello?

195
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,271
Hello?

196
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:22,484
First time, better to get a machine,
don't you think?

197
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,234
I was the first one to join
after Donald started the group.

198
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,602
He has Asperger's, you know.

199
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:32,106
Somebody told me that
he's good with numbers, is that true?

200
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,797
Yeah, he's very good, but his numbers...

201
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:38,445
- Really? What do you do?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a writer.

202
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,130
- You write?
- Yeah.

203
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:43,250
But you shouldn't read my oeuvre
because it repels women.

204
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,986
- Unless you count 1924...
- They describe it as puerile,

205
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,690
- sexually adolescent and perverse.
...when the record keeping was suspect,

206
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:51,272
to say the least.

207
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:08,409
On the humidity front, the only item of note
was in Hyderabad in the south of India.

208
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,027
Have you ever had real sex, Gregory?

209
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:15,667
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

210
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:26,180
...which, considering the seasons,
is something of an attention-grabber.

211
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,467
Say, Roger,
what would the weather have been like

212
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:34,902
at the second McKinley inaugural?

213
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:37,918
- That would've been...
- March 4, 1901, A.D.

214
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:41,295
Big snow! High temperature, 17 degrees,

215
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,233
3.4 inches, low temperature
of -5 degrees.

216
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,781
Then, in 1998,
another strong El Nino episode,

217
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:49,283
produced the wettest
February of all time...

218
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,707
- What'd you say to her?
...in downtown Los Angeles.

219
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:56,290
I said I was a writer, but she shouldn't
read my oeuvre because it repels women.

220
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:58,441
And then, what did she say?

221
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,077
"Try me."

222
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,547
Figures.

223
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,890
She's coming to the Halloween party
with me.

224
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,757
That's great, tell me about it.

225
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,069
I'm gonna go as Batman.

226
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,349
A whimsical commentary
on today's decaying popular culture.

227
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:25,307
- Oh, yeah? What's she going as?
- Who cares?

228
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,903
- I do.
- Ask her.

229
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,859
- Ask her what she's going as.
- Ask her if she'll come with me.

230
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,544
I was seized by terror.

231
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,430
I don't know if I can do that.

232
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,698
You both have Asperger's.

233
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,967
You both share the same language
of emotional dysfunction,

234
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:43,237
whereas I, on the other hand,
just irritate the shit out of everyone,

235
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:46,461
- even you.
- She likes you, though. She laughed.

236
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:51,131
Everybody laughs at me, it doesn't
commit them to a Halloween party.

237
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:55,215
Richard M. Nixon was
President in 1968...

238
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,365
Please.

239
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:58,566
He had a distinctive...

240
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:01,510
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other day.

241
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:03,557
I have a distinctive...

242
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:05,208
That looks nice.

243
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:10,397
My cookie! Don't eat my cookie,
that's my cookie!

244
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:12,399
- Hey! You can't do that!
- He ate my cookie! My cookie!

245
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:15,402
- No, that's not okay.
- That's my cookie! No! No! No!

246
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:18,554
- I want it back.
- Stop, stop. No, stop! Stop!

247
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:21,291
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

248
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,214
All right, I'm sorry,
but you can't do that.

249
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:31,685
I'm going to call my parents now. They'll
pick me up from the bulletin board.

250
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,443
Save that for later. Yeah.

251
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:41,847
I'll call my parents on the phone. They're
picking me up at the bulletin board.

252
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,985
Hi, Donald.

253
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,486
- You remember me?
- Yes.

254
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,422
Good.

255
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:00,114
You know what Gregory told me about you?

256
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,867
I'm good with numbers.

257
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:06,499
- You spoiled my surprise.
- I take things literally.

258
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:07,839
Me, too.

259
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:20,033
One time when I was seven years old,
my dad took me to a diner

260
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:24,671
for breakfast, and he said, "Hominy grits,"
and I thought that he said "How many,"

261
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,573
and I was supposed to count
how many there were.

262
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:30,197
- How many were there?
- Four hundred and thirty-seven.

263
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,172
That was a joke.

264
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:39,773
It's not that I remember anything
as stupid as how many hominy grits.

265
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,680
I have to go now. I
gotta feed my animals.

266
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:47,284
I have six birds myself.

267
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:03,896
Isabelle, there's something I need to
talk to you about that's important.

268
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,132
- Are you free for lunch tomorrow?
- Yes.

269
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:12,969
Good.

270
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,309
- Bye. Bye!
- Bye.

271
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:28,915
Hi, Isabelle.

272
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,165
Hi, Isabelle. Hi.

273
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,262
Hi. Hi, Isabelle. Isabelle, hello.

274
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:02,224
Izzy, I don't think he likes that.

275
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,224
Yes!

276
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:13,868
Isn't that funny?

277
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:17,763
Yes.

278
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:24,914
He's smiling. He's smiling.

279
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,580
And see this? This is
a friendly gesture.

280
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:32,084
See? Show me yours. Come on.

281
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,978
You know, a mandrill spends
two hours a day eating breakfast,

282
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:50,069
so when you think about it, that's
2,628,000 seconds a year eating breakfast,

283
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,678
which only leaves him

284
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:58,010
28,908,000 seconds a year
not to eat breakfast.

285
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,601
You know how... I don't have to do numbers
all the time. I can control myself.

286
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,819
Don't stop.

287
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,260
Don't ever stop. I love it.

288
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:17,731
- Well, that's good, 'cause I can't.
- I know that, neither can I.

289
00:22:17,802 --> 00:22:19,326
We're autistic.

290
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:22,582
Like, I can't stand
the sound of clanging metal.

291
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:25,200
If I hear it, I completely freak out.

292
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:30,069
I learned a long time ago
that I can't keep from shocking people,

293
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,411
so I just make it work for me,

294
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,151
sometimes.

295
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:38,920
I always say what I think,

296
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:43,437
not because it's good,
it's just that I can't censor it.

297
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:48,528
Like, the women in the park the other
day, I think I really freaked them out.

298
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,411
I hope that they'll forgive me sometime.

299
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:53,902
Isabelle, what you said about rape...

300
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,406
Rape is a very bad thing.
It's never funny.

301
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:02,306
Not ever.

302
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,369
That took guts, you
speaking up just now.

303
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,299
Not really.

304
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:33,972
No, it did. It did. It did,

305
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:36,905
because you're attracted to me,

306
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:40,949
and you wanna make a good impression,

307
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:44,751
and guts makes a really good impression.

308
00:23:53,697 --> 00:23:57,431
- This is how the birds are in my apartment.
- Mine, too.

309
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:02,336
They're trying to evict me,
some kind of phobia about animal shit.

310
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,164
That's too bad.

311
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:09,055
I think that tonight,
we should sneak back in here

312
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:12,813
and set all the animals free,
except for the polar bears,

313
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:15,281
it's too warm. That was a joke.

314
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:21,622
It's time.
You have something to tell me, remember?

315
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:32,633
My friend Gregory wants to take
you to the Halloween party.

316
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,038
Is that it?

317
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,577
I don't go to the Halloween
party, ever. So...

318
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:49,282
My friends dress up on Halloween
to hide who they really are,

319
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,650
- and...
- That's sad, but credible.

320
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:58,190
I have a costume, too, at home,

321
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,361
but it reveals who I really am,
and nobody knows.

322
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,408
You take me to the party.
Wear your costume.

323
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:15,972
I would be so honored.

324
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:21,781
In fact, let's not go to the party.
Just meet me at the mall.

325
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:25,486
Everyone's in costume.
They won't even notice us.

326
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:29,749
That's what I love about Halloween.

327
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,897
Hi, Isabelle, hi.

328
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:40,101
Hoy-hoy. Hello.

329
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,131
Hello, Isabelle.

330
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:48,270
Hello, Isabelle. Isabelle.

331
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:01,289
I'm nine hours and 37 minutes early,

332
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:04,558
which is a good sign,
because that's 577 minutes.

333
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:07,458
Prime number.

334
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,202
So, what's up, Isabelle?

335
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:42,361
I'm late, which is ironic, because I started
out nine hours and 23 minutes early.

336
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:16,123
You know what?

337
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,067
At this point, probably better
not to go at all, you think?

338
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:22,498
Yeah.

339
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:26,273
I mean, she probably left already,

340
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,177
and if she didn't, she'd just be
really irritated when I show up.

341
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:33,775
I wouldn't know what to say.

342
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:36,496
You know how I get
when I don't know what to say.

343
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,250
Yeah. Probably better not to go at all.

344
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:47,086
That's our doorbell.

345
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:49,899
I'll be right back.

346
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,236
Nice whale costume.

347
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,170
- Dr. Mozart, I presume?
- Mozart wasn't a doctor.

348
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:19,760
Symphony 40, G Minor. It's about anger,
passion and transcendence.

349
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,798
- Like you.
- Thanks.

350
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:26,413
I'm sorry I'm 63 minutes late.
I really was gonna come, I just...

351
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:29,873
That's okay, I just figured
you screwed up. Come on.

352
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:36,940
So, I was gonna take the 303 bus
instead of the 809,

353
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:41,917
and then I was thinking about
how 303 squared is 91,809,

354
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:47,200
and the last three digits are the same as 809,
so I just forgot which one I was gonna take.

355
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:49,703
- Then I was thinking that...
- Like I said,

356
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,752
I figured you screwed up.

357
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:54,996
Come on, we're going this way.

358
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:57,725
Yeah.

359
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:01,199
- So, this is who you really are?
- Yeah.

360
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:03,933
- This is so hot.
- Yeah.

361
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:06,436
- Are you in there?
- Yeah.

362
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,171
Mr. Jonah!

363
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:14,214
What are you laughing at, toots?
At least my boyfriend's a vegetarian!

364
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:16,482
You have a boyfriend?

365
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,723
No, it was a joke.

366
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,093
You're the vegetarian,
because you're a whale.

367
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,475
Whales aren't vegetarians.
They eat krill.

368
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:31,444
- So why is that?
- Because they're tiny shrimp.

369
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,299
That you're a whale?

370
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:37,330
- Well, there's lots of reasons.
- Name six.

371
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:42,267
- Well, for one, they're very big.
- Really?

372
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,937
- Yeah.
- And?

373
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:46,605
Oh,

374
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,963
all my life I've kind of felt like
I was on the sidelines,

375
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,046
watching the parade go by.

376
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,257
But when you're a whale,
you are the parade.

377
00:29:57,528 --> 00:30:00,361
- I bet you know all about whales.
- Yes.

378
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:01,993
Well, tell me.

379
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:05,000
Well, it's a very long story.

380
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:09,095
Well, the last bus
isn't for another two hours,

381
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,100
47 minutes and three...
No, two, one... One second.

382
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,805
Quick, Donald, tell me!

383
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:35,120
- Well, the bus is coming.
- Yup.

384
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,804
So, Donald, this is our first kiss.

385
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:45,705
No tongue.

386
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:49,534
Yeah.

387
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,416
Why don't you take this thing off?
You don't need it anymore.

388
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:58,965
I'm not quite so sure
what I'm wearing underneath.

389
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:01,253
Well, what the hell?

390
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:05,293
Let's lift it up.

391
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:10,692
Mr. Whale, you can go just there.

392
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:14,631
This is nice.

393
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,606
That was a mix-up at the Laundromat.

394
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:25,078
On second thought,
maybe we should have some tongue.

395
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:35,386
- Oh.
- Call me!

396
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,189
When?

397
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:48,436
When should I call you?

398
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,582
Hey, move it.

399
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,722
Okay, move. Hey!

400
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:47,291
Sit on your own.

401
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:49,154
No?

402
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:51,492
All right, just don't bite me.

403
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:53,925
Boo?

404
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,033
Honey, scoot.

405
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:01,804
Long messages are cheerfully ignored.
Get it over with.

406
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,940
This is Donald Morton.

407
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:07,627
This is my eighth message.

408
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:08,640
At least.

409
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:11,431
Hey, I'm sorry I called so many times,

410
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:13,933
but you didn't say when to call, so I...

411
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:16,069
Well, listen, I won't
bother you anymore.

412
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:17,537
That's what you said the last time.

413
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:21,207
I just wanted to say again,
I had a whale of a time last night,

414
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:24,325
and I... I understand.

415
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,162
I really do.

416
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:31,199
And I'm always gonna remember you,

417
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:33,674
the times that we had, and...

418
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:35,337
Donald Duck?

419
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:38,608
Oh, you're home.

420
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:42,040
Hi.

421
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,720
I didn't call 'cause I didn't
really know what to say to you.

422
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:51,692
Donald, I don't know
where you and I could ever go.

423
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:54,296
We could go to the amusement park.

424
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,448
Donald, you can see everything
from up here!

425
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:03,649
- Oh, jeez.
- Look at the sky.

426
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,785
It's the same color as my jacket!

427
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,186
I'm sure it's amazing.

428
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,203
It is, especially to the east
where the sun's setting!

429
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:15,061
Actually, the sun sets in the west.

430
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:18,998
Will you stop making conversation,
Donald? This is somewhat disappointing.

431
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:21,183
Just open your eyes. It's great.

432
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,466
It's kind of like in the arcade,

433
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,914
when I wanna factor a number, I just...

434
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:37,372
It just... I visualize it

435
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:39,832
going across my eyes.

436
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,772
Pick a number.

437
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:43,645
589.

438
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:46,359
Okay, so then I shoot
prime numbers at it.

439
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:49,295
So, three won't go into it,
and five won't go into it.

440
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,097
It won't even have a chance,
'cause it's not...

441
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,166
It doesn't end in a five or a zero.

442
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,318
And then, you know, seven, 11...

443
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:59,422
19, when I shoot 19,

444
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:01,828
it breaks into two, 19 and 31.

445
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:07,162
Your process is very sexual.

446
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:13,304
- Primes are hot.
- I like you!

447
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:17,241
You're so smart! You're so cool!

448
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:21,114
And you wanna know the secret
to this one? It's good.

449
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:24,853
See, you just... You just...

450
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,235
You throw them all at the same time.
Just...

451
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,385
No, don't.

452
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,639
Stop it!

453
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:49,702
Stop it!

454
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:18,099
Excuse me. Hey.

455
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,074
It's okay. It's okay.

456
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:26,058
We won the panda. We got four rings on.

457
00:36:26,082 --> 00:36:29,245
- Can we go home now?
- Yeah.

458
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,287
Don't freak out.

459
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:35,368
It's okay, I'm better, now.

460
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:37,326
I was talking to them.

461
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,824
Oh, hello.

462
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,054
Come on, sweet baby.

463
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:46,068
Oh. Don't worry, I'm
just talking to him.

464
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:49,270
- That's Cockatiel Dundee.
- Hey, Dundee.

465
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:53,242
- That's Ricky and that's Lucy.
- Hi.

466
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:56,712
And that's Piyachi, Chicken Boo.

467
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,780
And this is Don Juan de Marco.

468
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:03,081
Let's have a look
around the house, guys.

469
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:10,691
Oh, I save things,
because you never know.

470
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,749
You know?

471
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:15,259
You said your mom died.
You did bury her?

472
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:17,732
- Yeah.
- Just checking.

473
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,293
Let's sit down, huh?

474
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:25,101
Okay, guys.

475
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,141
Come on. That's it.

476
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,541
Come on.

477
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,407
All right. You can sit here.

478
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:38,210
You don't wanna sit here? Come on.
There you go.

479
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:42,781
You can get off, too, now.
That's it, you go here.

480
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:44,559
There you are.

481
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:47,495
- Oh.
- You want something to eat?

482
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:53,279
- You got any old food in the fridge?
- Yeah. Yeah. I got lots of old food.

483
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:56,739
- You like old food?
- Oh. Donald!

484
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,867
This is about sex.

485
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,206
I'm sorry, was that a little abrupt?

486
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,882
I just haven't had any

487
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:17,651
in a long, long time.

488
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:21,786
Yeah.

489
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,195
I had an instinct there.

490
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:31,899
But sex is gonna be terrific.

491
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:40,459
It's the most fun you can have
with your clothes off.

492
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:44,180
Hey, I'm sure you've been with
more attractive men.

493
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:47,789
Are you kidding me? You are so hot.

494
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,621
Anyway, attraction is a whole package,

495
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:58,496
and I've never been
with anyone like you.

496
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:01,700
You mean the hygiene?

497
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:09,541
You know how many guys would take me
home after that show at the ring toss?

498
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:10,601
Plenty.

499
00:39:13,883 --> 00:39:16,817
Well, they wouldn't be
there in the morning.

500
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:20,720
I'll be there in the morning.
I live here.

501
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:25,560
Is there a pathway to your bedroom?

502
00:39:27,163 --> 00:39:28,323
Yeah.

503
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:33,458
Wanna go?

504
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:36,728
Now?

505
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:40,231
Yeah.

506
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,598
You know how in the jungle
they say that some elephants

507
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:56,156
have longer trunks
and some of them have shorter ones?

508
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:01,586
Yeah.

509
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:03,020
Well,

510
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:07,826
I don't care how long
an elephant's trunk is,

511
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,464
as long as his dick's okay.

512
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:19,379
Sweetie, you can't disappoint me,

513
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:27,286
'cause whatever you are,
is exactly what I want.

514
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,919
Isabelle!

515
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:46,966
You know, at first I was upset
that she didn't even leave a note!

516
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,841
Then I realized it was a kindness.

517
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,507
She's a sweet person.

518
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:58,508
I mean, why hurt my feelings, you know?

519
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:01,442
The less said the better, you think?

520
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,507
Yeah.

521
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:07,546
So, we just can tuck it away, you know,
just leave it.

522
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:12,092
And she said a lot of beautiful things.

523
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,709
The fact that she didn't mean them
only makes her nicer.

524
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:20,067
What was she gonna say,
"Thanks for the lousy sex"?

525
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:23,329
Are you talking about me?

526
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:26,574
I just had to go home
and feed my animals.

527
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:33,311
You know what I think
we should do today?

528
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:36,616
- Buy you a nice suit.
- Sure.

529
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:40,282
This is my best friend, Bongo. Hello.

530
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:43,758
- I'm just doing the dishes.
- Cool.

531
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:49,057
Yeah, cool.

532
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:54,393
Here they are.

533
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:57,264
Yeah. He's coming. He's coming.

534
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,474
Where have you been?

535
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:08,681
I felt our friends deserve to
know the truth of your treachery.

536
00:43:09,052 --> 00:43:12,319
- I believe in the truth.
- You believe in gossip.

537
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:15,834
- Are you sleeping with him?
- Sure.

538
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:18,192
Janice, that's a personal question.

539
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:21,663
Sure. Is that okay with you?

540
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:26,466
Don't you hate all his numbers?
Does he change his socks?

541
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,935
Is his penis big enough?

542
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:31,405
No, no, and yes.

543
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:37,523
Would you take me to the movies
on Sunday at 5:00?

544
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:40,345
Janice, Sundays I'm with Isabelle.
Sorry.

545
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:46,281
This is a classic vicious betrayal,
very common in literature.

546
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:48,819
And life.

547
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,590
Hey. Nice to see you again, Gregory.

548
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,495
It's very nice to smell you.

549
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:05,531
As you all know,

550
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:10,710
Isabelle and I have been seeing
each other since Halloween.

551
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:12,891
And maybe we should talk
about how you feel about this.

552
00:44:12,915 --> 00:44:15,349
It's sexual harassment!

553
00:44:16,352 --> 00:44:17,863
That's a very serious accusation...

554
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:20,466
You used your position
to extort sexual favors.

555
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,390
You should be replaced.

556
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:24,203
My sister's a lawyer.

557
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:27,539
Gregory, Donald and I
are just getting to know each other.

558
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:30,943
- So you can still date me?
- Right now, I just wanna see Donald.

559
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:33,868
So when you're sick of him,
you can date me?

560
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,306
Skeets, let's hear from you.

561
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:40,786
Do you have any questions
about me and Isabelle?

562
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:45,210
There are 200 to 300 million sperm cells
in an average ejaculation.

563
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:52,350
Penguins mate only once a year,

564
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:54,583
and it lasts three minutes.

565
00:44:55,825 --> 00:44:58,157
I think they're extremely sexy.

566
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:00,357
You wanna know why?

567
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,308
I'm only gonna tell
you, if you wanna know.

568
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:06,278
- I wanna know.
- I don't, and that's for sure.

569
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:07,291
Skeets?

570
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:12,051
When penguins are reunited
after a long separation,

571
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:14,202
they stand breast to breast.

572
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,454
Their heads are thrown back,

573
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:16,889
and their little flippers are trembling,

574
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:21,313
and they sing, Skeets, because
they're so happy to find each other.

575
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,588
Gracie, how do you feel?

576
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:29,718
I feel sad.

577
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:33,693
About me and Isabelle?

578
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:37,826
Bronwin's daddy has blood cancer.

579
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:44,616
Regular people get sick, too,
not just autistic people,

580
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,665
that's just the way it is.

581
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:57,796
Yeah, but these days, lots of people
get better from chemotherapy, and...

582
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,887
I have to go now. My parents are
meeting me at the bulletin...

583
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:09,374
The meeting just started.

584
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:11,343
Maybe your parents will be there
in a little while...

585
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,597
Would you like me to go with you?

586
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:17,270
We could call your parents,
and we could wait together

587
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,372
by the bulletin board.

588
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:26,210
I'd like to do that.

589
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:39,094
I'll go, too.

590
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:41,293
Not today.

591
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:48,299
Can I go to the funeral?

592
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:50,896
I'm not going, and that's for sure.

593
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:52,635
Donald!

594
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:32,574
All right, just for
one day, nobody shit.

595
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:17,884
Yuck!

596
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:20,322
That is so gross.

597
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:23,755
Izzy, I'm home!

598
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:23,414
Oh, no.

599
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,860
What'd you do?

600
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:40,204
Where's my stuff?
Do you hear what I'm saying?

601
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:43,076
Everything's here. It's just organized.

602
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:48,440
I thought you'd like it.

603
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:53,832
Well, now I know where everything is,
so you better be nice to me

604
00:49:53,856 --> 00:49:55,968
or I'll take the secret to my grave.

605
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,290
Where's my shower curtain, huh?

606
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:00,552
I threw it out.

607
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:03,961
What? Damn it!

608
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:07,012
Well, I called the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta,

609
00:50:07,036 --> 00:50:08,981
but it was more than they could handle.

610
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,769
It was mine. This is all my stuff!

611
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:16,008
- You had no right to do this!
- I thought you'd like it.

612
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,778
You stole my life.

613
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:41,496
28, 54, 10.

614
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,061
Drop the two, 85, 410.

615
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,153
That's two times three squared,
times five, times 13, times 73.

616
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:49,166
Okay.

617
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:14,000
- You trying to get yourself killed?
- Maybe later.

618
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:20,105
- "H-Lime"? What's that supposed to mean?
- Harry Lime.

619
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:23,477
Orson Welles, The Third Man.

620
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,747
It's a movie.

621
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:28,707
Your plate's better.

622
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:32,030
If you take the letters for
Roman numerals, it's 215.

623
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:35,254
If you add the one, that's 216.
That's six cubed.

624
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:37,451
Twenty-seven is three cubed.

625
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:43,196
I'm doing all the numbers
in the parking lot.

626
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:45,595
Helps calm me down.

627
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:49,035
- You lose your job?
- No, my woman,

628
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:52,738
and my shower curtain.

629
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,335
What's your Social Security number?

630
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:06,145
Stop calling!

631
00:52:06,622 --> 00:52:09,386
Hi. This is my 14th message.

632
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:14,072
Well, listen, I respectfully think
that you should change your greeting,

633
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:16,621
in case you get called by your boss.

634
00:52:17,266 --> 00:52:19,757
Seriously, I'm fine now,

635
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:24,699
and I'm sorry I spoiled our evening.

636
00:52:24,773 --> 00:52:26,832
I am really, really sorry.

637
00:52:27,209 --> 00:52:29,643
It could never, ever happen again.

638
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:32,445
I mean, to hell with the shower curtain.

639
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:31,328
Hey.

640
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,344
I'm sorry.

641
00:53:51,994 --> 00:53:55,760
Everyone, this is my boyfriend.

642
00:54:00,302 --> 00:54:01,963
Donald Morton.

643
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:05,806
Oh. The shower curtain.

644
00:54:05,874 --> 00:54:07,341
Mac Farraday.

645
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:09,667
Brenda Mackey.

646
00:54:10,078 --> 00:54:12,376
Wanda, my mentor.

647
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:17,045
I bought him this suit. It was on sale.

648
00:54:17,419 --> 00:54:18,408
Hey.

649
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,449
Hi.

650
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:14,273
One of the reasons
that I cleaned your apartment...

651
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:16,067
Oh, boy, it's great!

652
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:19,212
The cleaner the better,
that's what I say.

653
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:22,248
It's so we can have our
friends over, Donald!

654
00:55:23,185 --> 00:55:25,930
Izzy, we don't have friends
who come over, ever.

655
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:28,422
Yeah. Wanna guess why?

656
00:55:30,692 --> 00:55:32,125
Not really.

657
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:37,830
- Donald?
- Izzy?

658
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,358
This is the most peaceful,

659
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,937
- the most beautiful place that I know.
- Yeah.

660
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:50,008
And the world doesn't want it anymore,
so they left it to me, to us.

661
00:55:50,546 --> 00:55:55,006
This is a special place
that's just for us.

662
00:55:56,618 --> 00:55:58,518
You know what we need?

663
00:55:59,988 --> 00:56:03,935
We need a little house with a yard,
so that we can plant flowers

664
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:07,895
and sit in the shade
and kiss under the stars.

665
00:56:08,163 --> 00:56:09,152
Yeah.

666
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:12,292
The heavens are very important to me.

667
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:16,167
So, I found this tiny place,

668
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:21,486
and the rent isn't gonna cost any more
than what we're already paying

669
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,887
with our two apartments.

670
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:24,811
Izzy, I got fired, remember?

671
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,880
Dr. Jeffries is the woman at the
university who diagnosed me,

672
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:33,853
and I was telling her
about how you organized

673
00:56:33,922 --> 00:56:37,589
this group of lonely people
that everybody else ignores.

674
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:41,294
I only did that because
I was lonely, too.

675
00:56:44,499 --> 00:56:47,696
And I was telling her
how much you care for them

676
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:50,237
and how much they love you,

677
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:54,986
because this is the real work of your
life, Donald, only nobody pays you.

678
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,755
So I asked her if she could
find you a job at the university

679
00:56:57,779 --> 00:57:00,491
that would enable you to continue
this invaluable work.

680
00:57:00,515 --> 00:57:03,649
- You did what?
- And she said, "Yes, yes, yes."

681
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:09,021
Izzy, they don't have cabs
at the University Medical Center.

682
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:15,086
Donald Duck, it comes down to this.

683
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:19,092
Do you wanna make me happy?

684
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:31,055
For one thing, I understand
you're a mathematical genius.

685
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:32,444
Who said that?

686
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:36,114
Dr. Jeffries recommended that I call
Isabelle Sørensen.

687
00:57:38,787 --> 00:57:40,755
I hope that was all right.

688
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:44,156
Yeah, it's her fault I'm
here in the first place.

689
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:49,374
Well, after everything she told me,

690
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:52,856
and checking on your excellent record
in college,

691
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:57,836
I'm wondering why you choose to drive
a taxi for a living.

692
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:03,308
At my interview with IBM,
after I graduated college,

693
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,824
they asked me what my plans were,

694
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:09,627
and I said, "Probably go to McDonald's
for a 12-piece McNugget

695
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:12,597
"and two cheeseburgers,
and then do my laundry."

696
00:58:12,621 --> 00:58:17,288
- Did they laugh, at least?
- They smiled and they said they'd call me.

697
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:21,094
They didn't.

698
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:28,502
Mr. Morton, I run Administrative
Services for the Medical Center.

699
00:58:29,037 --> 00:58:30,314
Your profile is a plus,

700
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:34,719
because we want to give opportunities
to people with special needs.

701
00:58:34,743 --> 00:58:37,337
You can say autistic, I already know.

702
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:39,612
Touché.

703
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,527
Your job would be looking at
statistical runs,

704
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:44,314
finding inconsistencies,

705
00:58:44,386 --> 00:58:47,598
telling me where the computer got it
wrong. You can do that, can't you?

706
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:48,646
Oh, sure.

707
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:52,458
Well, I can't and neither can
anybody else I've ever met,

708
00:58:54,596 --> 00:58:56,689
so I'm blessed to have you.

709
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:17,150
Where do you want me to put him?

710
01:00:15,143 --> 01:00:16,667
- Donald!
- What?

711
01:00:16,745 --> 01:00:18,440
Prepare to die!

712
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:22,813
- Okay. You ready?
- No.

713
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:24,328
- Yes, you are.
- No.

714
01:00:24,352 --> 01:00:26,286
It's gonna be fine. Okay?

715
01:00:26,354 --> 01:00:29,289
Scissors. First some water. Ready?

716
01:00:29,724 --> 01:00:33,785
- One, two, three. Water.
- Oh, no, no.

717
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:36,227
Donald. Sit down.

718
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:37,589
- Come...
- No.

719
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:40,266
Come on, it's gonna be fine. Come here.

720
01:00:40,368 --> 01:00:41,528
- Hello.
- Hi.

721
01:00:41,603 --> 01:00:43,264
- Nice day, huh?
- Hey.

722
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:46,696
Hi.

723
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:49,242
I think they're the neighbors.

724
01:00:51,947 --> 01:00:55,014
It's too expensive, Dundee.
It's too expensive.

725
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:04,055
All right.

726
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,891
Have a good day.

727
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:08,585
Bye.

728
01:01:14,603 --> 01:01:17,448
Isabelle, there's something
I need to talk to you about,

729
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:20,635
that sometimes you
find kind of enraging.

730
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:22,138
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

731
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:24,670
- Try me.
- Oh.

732
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:32,518
Tonight, when my boss comes here
for dinner,

733
01:01:32,554 --> 01:01:34,681
I just want everything to be

734
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:39,560
really nice. You know?

735
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:44,431
He's a really good person,
and I really like my job.

736
01:01:45,734 --> 01:01:48,401
- I just want everything...
- To be nice.

737
01:01:48,536 --> 01:01:50,470
- Yeah.
- Okay.

738
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:56,834
Have a nice day at work.

739
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,112
You, too.

740
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:09,715
Bye!

741
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:19,459
Izzy, we're home!

742
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:25,738
Can you shut the door?

743
01:02:27,475 --> 01:02:30,288
Well, I told her to put everybody
in his or her or their cages

744
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:32,780
respectively, but she didn't, and...

745
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:35,006
Come on, you guys. Come on.

746
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:38,284
Come on, you guys. Stay. Stay. Get down.

747
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:45,825
Here she is.

748
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:48,655
Izzy.

749
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:52,529
- All the birds were out.
- Yeah.

750
01:02:53,635 --> 01:02:55,603
Hank Wallace, Isabelle.

751
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:59,070
- Nice to put a face with the voice.
- That's right.

752
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:03,874
We talked about what a genius
Mr. Morton is, not to mention a saint.

753
01:03:05,613 --> 01:03:06,924
Why, only this morning,

754
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:09,660
he advised me to be on my very tippy-toe
best behavior tonight,

755
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:11,811
so I didn't weird you out.

756
01:03:11,886 --> 01:03:16,286
So, feel free to advise me
if I deviate from normality at any time.

757
01:03:17,392 --> 01:03:19,637
Sense of humor, we're working on it.

758
01:03:19,661 --> 01:03:22,661
- Do you like vegetable lasagna, Hank?
- Sure.

759
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:25,527
How about a beer? See you inside.

760
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:28,930
It's great vegetable lasagna.

761
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:34,919
I don't pretend to be an expert, but...

762
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:39,175
Oh, that's great,
'cause I hate it when people do that.

763
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:44,249
- But your paintings are impressive.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

764
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:46,731
Most people want me to paint
something else,

765
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:50,953
you know, with fewer eyes,
less violent, less insane.

766
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,572
I used to tell Donald that I wanted him
to hear my paintings

767
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:55,790
and see my music,

768
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:58,442
'cause I wanted him to understand them
like other people couldn't.

769
01:03:58,466 --> 01:04:02,197
She doesn't understand
that I can, and I do.

770
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:05,898
And most people do, it's pretty normal.

771
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:15,649
I'm basically a failure, Hank,
in the material world.

772
01:04:16,184 --> 01:04:19,030
- I used to be a piano tuner.
- She has perfect pitch.

773
01:04:19,054 --> 01:04:21,532
I made good money, it's a valued trade,

774
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:22,967
but half the clients hit on me,

775
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:25,202
and the other half would say something
stupid enough

776
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:27,854
to where I'd blurt out something rude.

777
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:32,861
I say things as I think them, you know?

778
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:34,412
Out loud, most of the time.

779
01:04:34,436 --> 01:04:37,633
Can't hold my temper,
I'm arrogant, impatient,

780
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:39,696
and I don't suffer fools.

781
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:46,023
I have a good heart, believe it or not,
but that doesn't pay so good, so...

782
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:50,313
I'm lucky that I have a wonderful guy,
who's also very generous.

783
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:53,853
He tell you about our
plans for the house?

784
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:59,470
Well, they're not exactly plans
that we plan to implement...

785
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:00,984
Maybe ideas, more.

786
01:05:01,062 --> 01:05:04,742
We're gonna put this big sandbox
right here in the living room,

787
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:08,224
so people and animals
can play, whatever,

788
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:12,637
and then outside,
we're gonna put this big aviary

789
01:05:12,707 --> 01:05:14,919
so the birds and lizards
and Bongo can hang out.

790
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:16,987
- Have you met Bongo?
- No, not officially.

791
01:05:17,011 --> 01:05:21,392
Have you noticed that the winters
are coming later and later every year?

792
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,526
- I like that.
- Have you?

793
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,197
And it was actually Donald's idea
that we put a piano in the yard,

794
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:28,399
so all the local animals
can listen to me play.

795
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:30,448
It must be global warming.

796
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:36,173
Interrupting is not the way to become
the focus of attention, Donald.

797
01:05:36,197 --> 01:05:37,926
It's very autistic.

798
01:05:40,468 --> 01:05:42,002
Where was I? The walls.

799
01:05:42,036 --> 01:05:44,815
So, I'm gonna paint them
these one-of-a-kind savage colors,

800
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:48,752
and then get fabrics to put all over
the carpet and stuff, that scream

801
01:05:48,776 --> 01:05:50,107
"jungle," you know?

802
01:05:50,178 --> 01:05:52,256
And then right up there,
above the doorway,

803
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,860
I wanna put this whale-shaped thing
that you have to walk through,

804
01:05:55,884 --> 01:06:00,131
and then, eventually, full-size aquarium,
because obviously we love birds,

805
01:06:00,155 --> 01:06:04,022
- but we also love fish.
- How am I gonna pay for all this?

806
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:10,007
My boss is gonna think that we're crazy.

807
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:11,976
Who got you that job in the first place?

808
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,912
You only got it for me
so that I could get you this house

809
01:06:14,936 --> 01:06:16,046
and these luxuries.

810
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,782
Well, it's obvious
we don't share the same dreams.

811
01:06:18,806 --> 01:06:20,151
That job was for you,

812
01:06:20,175 --> 01:06:22,419
and I pushed, and I
sweet-talked you into it,

813
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:25,589
because I knew that you would never go
down there by yourself.

814
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:29,515
But it was all for you,
so you could be proud of yourself!

815
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,832
I have put up with an array of shit
from you that no one should tolerate,

816
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:37,568
because I thought
that you would do the same for me.

817
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:41,585
But you made me feel like a freak!
Behave for your boss?

818
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:46,197
I mean, this is coming from who?
Mr. Whale Costume, Mr. Toxic Toilet.

819
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:47,978
What about the show
that you put on in there?

820
01:06:48,002 --> 01:06:52,402
Did you do one thing the entire night
that was even halfway normal?

821
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,299
No,

822
01:06:57,145 --> 01:07:00,558
because I was mad, and, sadly,
I was just being myself.

823
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:03,142
Oh, that's yourself? That's yourself?

824
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,376
That's the whole point, Donald Duck.

825
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:11,956
You're just one more guy who sees
who I really am and can't handle it.

826
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:15,172
It broke my heart
to see how scared you were.

827
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:16,674
- Scared?
- Bringing home your boss

828
01:07:16,698 --> 01:07:20,411
to prove that you were normal, by showing
off your smart, pretty little wife?

829
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:22,980
Only, he saw that she was
just as crazy as you are.

830
01:07:23,004 --> 01:07:24,232
Crazier.

831
01:07:30,411 --> 01:07:31,639
Crazier.

832
01:07:34,515 --> 01:07:37,348
There's one difference
between us, Donald.

833
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,583
You wanna be normal.

834
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:42,712
You crave it.

835
01:07:43,925 --> 01:07:46,120
And that is what broke us up.

836
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:50,989
I'm leaving now!

837
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:53,811
I don't want you here when I get back.

838
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:57,169
I don't want you here, ever,
or you will regret it!

839
01:08:41,015 --> 01:08:44,628
So, I got an unlisted number,
but there was no other way.

840
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:46,764
I can picture you
still calling every three minutes,

841
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:49,279
hoping for some electronic miracle.

842
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:53,686
I'm not mad anymore, Donald.

843
01:08:54,095 --> 01:08:57,495
I'm okay. So, don't obsess
on all that stuff I said.

844
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:00,611
Does she have any idea
who she's talking to?

845
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:02,780
I've never been able to stay
with any guy for very long,

846
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,602
so I knew I'd end up
breaking your heart.

847
01:09:06,274 --> 01:09:07,741
A piece of advice.

848
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:10,287
Set a limit on how many
times you play this,

849
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:12,256
like 20, and then erase it, okay?

850
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,147
- That's 32 times that I've heard.
- Doesn't cost anything.

851
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:19,984
Don't worry, I won't go out with her.

852
01:09:22,223 --> 01:09:24,418
I could never do that to you.

853
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,148
Who'd go whale watching?

854
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:53,050
It's a wholesome activity,
and the weather should be ideal.

855
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:55,933
Barring unforeseen conditions
to the contrary,

856
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:57,634
since there's a low-pressure front

857
01:09:57,658 --> 01:10:01,219
which could really have the boat
rocking and rolling.

858
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:03,924
The ocean's five hours away.

859
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:09,730
Yeah, but whales are
Donald's favorite thing

860
01:10:10,004 --> 01:10:13,083
and would cheer him up
from Isabelle dumping him.

861
01:10:13,107 --> 01:10:15,598
I'm not going, and that's for sure.

862
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:19,690
But you could be the cruise lecturer.

863
01:10:19,714 --> 01:10:22,114
It's a very prestigious position.

864
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,828
Or perhaps contrast the administrations

865
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:28,452
of Chester A. Arthur and
Millard Fillmore, or whatever.

866
01:10:28,723 --> 01:10:31,790
That's seven.
Just two more for the group rate.

867
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:36,853
Let's watch a whale. It's on Sunday.

868
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:41,665
Sunday I see my daddy in the hospital,
that's just the way it is.

869
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:45,728
I could call Isabelle.
She doesn't hate me.

870
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:03,921
I have a list of friends,
some of them are women.

871
01:11:33,788 --> 01:11:37,788
I know why you like living with me.
I'm neater than Isabelle.

872
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:41,271
You're neater than me, tied with Blume,
and that's it.

873
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:43,786
I file my food. Nobody does that.

874
01:11:43,865 --> 01:11:47,494
- Can I give you some advice?
- Can I humanly stop you?

875
01:11:47,602 --> 01:11:49,433
Stick with the group.

876
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,697
Compared to us, you're a god.

877
01:11:51,772 --> 01:11:55,264
And next to Isabelle,
which you will never be again,

878
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:57,801
you don't come off so hot.

879
01:11:58,346 --> 01:12:00,473
We can't hear you!

880
01:12:41,322 --> 01:12:43,017
You got a message.

881
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:46,122
You got 17 of them.

882
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:48,923
Actually, they're not for me.

883
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:57,195
Donald. Donald, please be there, please.

884
01:12:58,205 --> 01:13:00,435
God damn it, he's dead, Donald.

885
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:04,405
- Oh, Donald, Bongo died.
- That's her rabbit.

886
01:13:04,478 --> 01:13:06,002
Where are you?

887
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,391
I'm so glad you came.

888
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:25,863
I don't know why I went over the edge.

889
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,393
I've lost pets all my life.

890
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:36,031
What?

891
01:13:38,312 --> 01:13:39,779
I missed you.

892
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:48,486
You never came for the
birds or the whale.

893
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,085
God, you must have missed them.

894
01:13:55,196 --> 01:13:58,730
If I took them away,
this wouldn't be my home anymore.

895
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:02,432
Be my friend, Donald.

896
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:07,705
Be my best friend, please,
because I really need you.

897
01:14:09,076 --> 01:14:12,823
And I always felt like you wanted us
to get married or something.

898
01:14:12,847 --> 01:14:14,558
- Did I ever say that?
- Not in words.

899
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:17,982
But instead of that,
do you wanna just be my friend?

900
01:14:18,352 --> 01:14:21,219
- Without the sex?
- Without the pressure.

901
01:14:24,258 --> 01:14:29,025
My friendship is all I have to give.
Do you want it?

902
01:14:31,999 --> 01:14:33,364
Of course.

903
01:14:41,475 --> 01:14:43,340
That makes me so happy.

904
01:14:51,919 --> 01:14:54,831
Yeah, but how do you know
that she knows what she wants?

905
01:14:54,855 --> 01:14:57,000
I mean, you didn't see the way
that she was looking at me.

906
01:14:57,024 --> 01:14:59,288
That's because I wasn't there.

907
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:06,328
- Yeah, but she was talking about marriage.
- To tell you that she didn't want to.

908
01:15:06,634 --> 01:15:09,212
Yeah, but I didn't bring it up, she did,

909
01:15:09,236 --> 01:15:11,548
and when I brought up sex,
she didn't exactly say no.

910
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:14,507
When women want sex,
they usually say, "Yes!"

911
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,145
- Why are you saying this?
- Donald. Donald.

912
01:15:23,217 --> 01:15:27,916
Donald, if there's one thing I know,
it's chicks.

913
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:32,755
That was a good load.

914
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:35,761
Good dryer, good pace.

915
01:15:42,903 --> 01:15:44,302
Yeah, but...

916
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,004
Did you fix your tie?

917
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:50,600
Your table is ready. Right this way.

918
01:15:51,846 --> 01:15:53,905
This is so pretty, Donald.

919
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:06,460
Look. There's a little fish.
There's three.

920
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,687
Hello.

921
01:16:11,332 --> 01:16:12,909
- Your chair, miss.
- Thank you.

922
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:14,924
And may I take your coat?

923
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:19,664
- Yes. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

924
01:16:23,477 --> 01:16:25,811
- And here's your menu.
- Thank you.

925
01:16:28,015 --> 01:16:29,414
Sir.

926
01:16:31,051 --> 01:16:33,230
- Your waiter will be with you soon.
- Thank you.

927
01:16:33,254 --> 01:16:36,280
- And have a wonderful evening.
- Thanks.

928
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:40,256
Well, this is completely irrational.
I am very impressed.

929
01:16:41,495 --> 01:16:43,292
- Izzy.
- Oh, my God!

930
01:16:44,665 --> 01:16:47,310
- This is gonna cost you a fortune.
- Yeah.

931
01:16:47,334 --> 01:16:50,113
Hank told me this is
the best food in town.

932
01:16:50,137 --> 01:16:53,334
I wanted the place to
be special, because

933
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:57,771
I have something special to talk about.

934
01:16:58,078 --> 01:16:59,602
Is it a surprise?

935
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,147
Good evening.

936
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:03,472
Huh?

937
01:17:03,984 --> 01:17:06,680
What is it? What is it?

938
01:17:07,555 --> 01:17:08,749
Donald?

939
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:12,669
- Anything from the bar?
- Go away. What? What is it?

940
01:17:12,693 --> 01:17:13,804
- Take your time.
- Tell me. Tell me.

941
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:15,438
I'll come back to let
you know the specials.

942
01:17:15,462 --> 01:17:16,827
What is it?

943
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:22,357
Izzy.

944
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:27,567
I don't think you know what you want.

945
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:32,441
You got us a house, and
you got me the job.

946
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:38,077
And we keep fighting, and...

947
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:41,731
But you keep
bringing me back into your life.

948
01:17:41,755 --> 01:17:42,744
And...

949
01:17:43,724 --> 01:17:47,204
And today you brought up marriage,
and I think that you want that.

950
01:17:47,228 --> 01:17:52,228
And I want that, too, because you're
my only chance, and I want that chance.

951
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:58,268
That's very fucking flattering.

952
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,842
Well, you're my only chance,
because I love you,

953
01:18:04,945 --> 01:18:08,279
and I'm your only chance,
because you love me, too.

954
01:18:14,088 --> 01:18:15,817
Marry me, Isabelle.

955
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,646
- Thanks for taking the pressure off!
- Isabelle, don't freak out!

956
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:33,350
- No. You're just like all the others.
- No, I'm not like all the others!

957
01:18:33,374 --> 01:18:35,501
I don't want you to save me!

958
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,303
I just wanna be left alone!

959
01:19:18,619 --> 01:19:21,520
185. Why did I have to
ask her to marry me?

960
01:19:27,461 --> 01:19:28,792
Fuck.

961
01:19:41,008 --> 01:19:43,272
Okay. Okay.

962
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,469
47, 48.

963
01:19:49,149 --> 01:19:53,677
No. I gotta go home,
and I gotta tell her not to marry me.

964
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,801
Izzy, we gotta talk!

965
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:13,068
Izzy, where are you?

966
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:40,431
Donald? I'm Dr. Jeffries,
Isabelle's psychiatrist.

967
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:42,078
- Are you okay?
- Is she okay?

968
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:44,436
I signed her release, and she left.

969
01:20:44,505 --> 01:20:48,151
- Is that safe?
- She's gonna be fine. She'll be in therapy.

970
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:49,886
She doesn't need therapy.
She's not crazy.

971
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:52,845
Donald, she needs someone
to listen to her.

972
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:57,347
I'll go home and I'll listen.
I'm an excellent listener.

973
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,710
I'll improve.

974
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:06,151
No, I won't.

975
01:21:06,226 --> 01:21:09,093
Well, Asperger's is a funny animal.

976
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:14,528
Can I go home now?

977
01:21:17,638 --> 01:21:18,798
Donald.

978
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:23,473
I don't want you to see her,
I don't want you to call her,

979
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:27,377
and neither does she, okay?

980
01:21:37,424 --> 01:21:38,568
Look at it this way,

981
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:41,037
she tried to kill herself
because you wouldn't stop calling her.

982
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:43,339
No, she tried to kill herself
because I wanted to marry her.

983
01:21:43,363 --> 01:21:46,309
- It's completely different.
- If I were you, I would ask me for advice.

984
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,777
Don't play her little game.

985
01:21:47,801 --> 01:21:50,380
Write a story about how
she was eaten by Peruvian fire ants,

986
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:52,849
and then run over by a car,
and then fax it to her.

987
01:21:52,873 --> 01:21:54,617
She's expecting me to call!

988
01:21:54,641 --> 01:21:59,441
If I don't, she's gonna go crazy
and think that I don't love her anymore.

989
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:04,694
I'm gonna find another phone.
I know the number.

990
01:22:04,718 --> 01:22:08,415
Is it as good as a number as, say, 2809?

991
01:22:09,022 --> 01:22:11,734
2809 is 53 squared,
and five plus three is eight.

992
01:22:11,758 --> 01:22:13,736
The cubed root of eight is two,
which is her dress size.

993
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,505
I bought her this beautiful little dress
the other day

994
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:18,174
- that has these little flowers on it.
- Six.

995
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:21,845
It's not a richly textured number,
but it is her shoe size.

996
01:22:21,869 --> 01:22:25,181
She has beautiful feet. You guys,
I know her better than anybody.

997
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:26,616
I know that she needs me to call.

998
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:30,542
Or the doctor is right,
and you call and she kills herself!

999
01:22:33,046 --> 01:22:36,246
And then you regret it
for the rest of your life.

1000
01:22:46,627 --> 01:22:48,720
How am I gonna stop myself?

1001
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:56,501
What do you wear when you stop smoking?

1002
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,497
A nicotine patch.

1003
01:23:00,974 --> 01:23:01,963
Huh?

1004
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:15,817
9660.

1005
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:44,008
No, no, I can't.

1006
01:24:04,972 --> 01:24:05,961
No.

1007
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:06,830
- Loan me your laptop, will ya?
- I can't. I have to take it with me.

1008
01:26:07,294 --> 01:26:09,872
Excuse me,
do you know when the next bus 217 runs?

1009
01:26:09,896 --> 01:26:10,885
Sorry.

1010
01:26:10,964 --> 01:26:13,364
- I'm chasing someone.
- By bus?

1011
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:14,977
Well, it's important.

1012
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:17,802
- Important enough to take the bus.
- Yeah.

1013
01:26:19,873 --> 01:26:21,918
My girlfriend left me
because I wanted to get married

1014
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:24,502
and she wanted to stay just friends.

1015
01:26:25,278 --> 01:26:28,412
- Ah. The slower this chase, the better.
- Yeah.

1016
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:04,640
Stop the bus!

1017
01:27:41,054 --> 01:27:43,488
All this time, and you didn't call.

1018
01:27:44,357 --> 01:27:47,190
- I was gonna call.
- You were?

1019
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:51,707
Well, just to tell you that I wasn't gonna
call, so that you wouldn't be aggravated,

1020
01:27:51,731 --> 01:27:53,643
sitting around waiting
and wondering when I was...

1021
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:56,135
- Gonna call?
- Yeah.

1022
01:27:58,472 --> 01:28:00,440
But in the end I figured

1023
01:28:02,008 --> 01:28:05,808
that forcing myself into your life
was probably not right.

1024
01:28:06,813 --> 01:28:08,713
I would always do that.

1025
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:14,250
So, the only nice thing I had left
to give was just not to call.

1026
01:28:17,724 --> 01:28:19,591
I hated you for not calling,

1027
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:24,426
'cause you were always gonna be there,
and when you weren't, it was as if

1028
01:28:24,965 --> 01:28:27,058
you didn't love me anymore.

1029
01:28:30,203 --> 01:28:32,262
So go home, I'll call you.

1030
01:28:39,346 --> 01:28:42,280
I can't promise you the
future, Donald Duck.

1031
01:28:43,683 --> 01:28:46,883
I don't know if this is for two days
or 20 years.

1032
01:28:54,461 --> 01:28:57,328
Finally, something about
us that's normal.

1033
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,017
I missed you so much.

1034
01:29:39,673 --> 01:29:41,374
Look what Donald made.

1035
01:29:42,108 --> 01:29:44,872
- I'm hungry.
- Delicious.

1036
01:29:45,312 --> 01:29:46,779
Thanksgiving.

1037
01:29:47,147 --> 01:29:51,083
- Stop that.
- Blume, no, no. Blume.

1038
01:29:53,086 --> 01:29:57,286
All right, so I wanna thank Donald,
who made this amazing lunch,

1039
01:29:57,557 --> 01:30:00,958
and I just wanted
to thank you all for coming,

1040
01:30:01,027 --> 01:30:04,758
because you are our family,

1041
01:30:06,032 --> 01:30:08,728
and I... Well, we love you.

1042
01:30:11,638 --> 01:30:12,764
Here, here.

1043
01:30:12,872 --> 01:30:13,998
Wait, wait.

1044
01:30:14,074 --> 01:30:17,373
This is to Donald Morton,

1045
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:20,206
my husband.

1046
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,542
Cheers.

1047
01:30:31,124 --> 01:30:32,489
I love you!

1048
01:30:58,518 --> 01:31:00,418
Anyone want gravy?
