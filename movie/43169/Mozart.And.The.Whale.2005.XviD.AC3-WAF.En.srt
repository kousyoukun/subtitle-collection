1
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:23,883
This is the best job I've ever had.

2
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,470
It’d better be.
It’s the last color.

3
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:31,516
You see, I got fired from
the Red Cab company and the...

4
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,310
Checkered Boat Cab company,
and the Green Cab company.

5
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,107
But this was different.
I can feel it.

6
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:43,820
Even though I've been here for about
7 days, 9 hours and 37 minutes.

7
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:48,992
Don't worry about him.
He's unflappable.

8
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,500
Birds never play into the accidents,
anyway. It’s usually the radio.

9
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,462
The radio is...

10
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,839
"...you got a problem?
-It’s the radio."

11
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:08,303
See? 87 last checked in
at 4th and Wall...

12
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,180
which puts in a good
13 minutes away...

13
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,223
while 223 and 41 are both
south the Interstate...

14
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,392
which makes them much,
much closer to Division and Trent.

15
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:17,228
And then there's Dave, who checked
in last 10 minutes ago and I'm sure...

16
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,481
that he stopped at the Starbucks
at Stevens and Trackwood...

17
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,191
which just makes him
right around the corner.

18
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:24,152
I see the deployment
of the entire fleet in my mind.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,238
And the big trouble is I just,
I can't not see it.

20
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,176
-Did you see that?
-Is anyone hurt?

21
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,262
What the hell is this?
What’s the matter with you?

22
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,556
Are you crazy or something?
Look at this!

23
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:56,017
Look at all...!
Who's gonna pay for all this?

24
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,687
I am talking to you.
This is coming out of you, pal.

25
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,065
We're gonna get you home
before group.

26
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:05,026
Don't walk away.
Come back here! You...!

27
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,486
Shoot!

28
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,740
I'll track your name down, pal.

29
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:17,580
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, where are you going?

30
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,250
You can't leave us right here.

31
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,460
You can't leave us here.

32
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,711
Hey, taxi!

33
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,933
Hi, Donald.

34
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,854
-You're late.
-Sorry I'm late, you guys.

35
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:44,023
You said that the last time
and the last five times.

36
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:46,568
You're late to your own group.

37
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,947
Hey! No!

38
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,035
Green!

39
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,581
I got a raise at the university,
you know. 34 cents an hour.

40
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,249
Nobody cares.

41
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,877
0f course it’s not technically
a monsoon, but...

42
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,504
14 inches of rain in 36 hours
is nothing to sneeze at...

43
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,714
even in Sri Lanka,
because...

44
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,340
They said my writing
was interesting per se...

45
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,178
but it doesn't meet their present needs
whatever that’s supposed to mean.

46
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,472
The Los Angeles Dodgers had
only 16 home games rained out...

47
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,765
in 41 years of baseball.

48
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,350
Nearly half of those rain games
occurred in the month of April...

49
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,227
and none have occurred
during the months of June...

50
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:23,104
or July.

51
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:24,981
I called by parents on the phone.

52
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,733
They're picking me up
at the bulletin board.

53
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:29,736
There's no bulletin board
at the park. You're screwed!

54
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:32,113
They'll never find you. Ever.

55
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,285
0kay, guys, we leave in 10 minutes
if we're going to make it to the park...

56
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,955
on time to meet the others.
It’s the 17 bus transfer to the 301.

57
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:43,208
Who needs tokens?

58
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:44,417
Come and get them.

59
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,461
They'll never find me. Ever.

60
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,839
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time. That’s just the way it is.

61
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,550
Gracie, can I see you
for a minute?

62
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:05,188
They'll never find me.
Ever.

63
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,067
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time. That’s just the way it is.

64
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,485
We'll buy you a cab.

65
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,364
I got a raise at the university,
you know. 34 cents an hour.

66
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,949
Yes?

67
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,829
Gracie, I'm gonna run the meeting
a little differently today.

68
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,873
I think that when
we get to the park...

69
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,836
I want you to gather
all the women...

70
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:32,257
and I'll gather all the guys
and go to the bleachers.

71
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:35,885
48 is interesting, because we add
the 4 and the 8 together you get 12.

72
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:39,764
If you flip 4 and 8 around, you get
84, and you subtract from 48...

73
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,309
you get 36, all of which
are exact multiplies of 12.

74
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:46,187
And 36 is interesting because
we add 3 and 6, we get 9...

75
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:49,816
and if you flip it around, you
get 63 and then, minus 36 is 27...

76
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,694
all of which are
exact multiplies of the 9.

77
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:56,322
-And now 144...
-Why will I gather all the women?

78
00:05:58,783 --> 00:05:59,826
I want...

79
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,787
I want everybody to practice
telling personal stories.

80
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,248
And I think that people will be less
shy without the opposite sex...

81
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:08,418
...around. Do you think?
-I can tell them about my raise.

82
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,546
Bad idea.
Your raise is incredibly boring.

83
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,924
As a story, it lacks dramatic
tension and narrative drive.

84
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,260
You won't hear it.
You're not a girl.

85
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:20,138
I am, and I'm already bored!

86
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:24,350
Hey, somebody new signed up.
Isabelle Sorensen.

87
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,228
Gracie, maybe it’d be nice
if you let her start.

88
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:29,230
That way,
everybody can get to know her.

89
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,715
-Hi.
-Hi.

90
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,675
I'm new.

91
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,683
I don't really know what to say.

92
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,902
0kay, help me out.
Ask me a question.

93
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:19,030
The candy bar Baby Ruth
was named after the daughter...

94
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:21,032
of President Glover Cleveland.

95
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:26,079
He once worked as a hangman
in Buffalo, New York.

96
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,960
No. Don't distract with a lot of weird
ball stuff 'cause I get completely lost.

97
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,547
He was one of the presidents
who had illegitimate children...

98
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,467
together with Thomas Jefferson
and Warren G. Harding.

99
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:49,894
I don't get that. How do 3 guys
have children together?

100
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,772
They didn't even live
in the same century.

101
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,824
I do that.

102
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,078
I take things sort of literally.

103
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:12,000
"In fact, I remember when
I was a kid and my parents..."

104
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:16,212
"were watching the Olympics on TV
and this athlete broke a record."

105
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:18,673
<i>And everybody was really excited.</i>

106
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:22,635
"And I thought: “Well, if that's all that
took to impress them, I can do that"."

107
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,429
<i>So I did.</i>

108
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,015
"The neighborhood kids saw
what I was doing..."

109
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,893
"and they started making
the loud noises that they knew."

110
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,311
<i>I hated.</i>

111
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,855
Monster! Monster! Monster!

112
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:37,901
"So I started barking
like a dog because..."

113
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,360
<i>I can do that!</i>

114
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,494
Animals are different.
You can't teach them cruelty.

115
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,500
I don't know.
What else do you want me to say?

116
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:58,171
It’s always good, you guys, to start
a story somewhere near the beginning.

117
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,176
I grew up...

118
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,387
in a nice house.

119
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:11,476
By the time I was 2 years-old,
my parents basically got the drill.

120
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:15,522
I wasn't exactly what
they were looking for in a child.

121
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,108
I wasn't normal.

122
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:23,446
Quick. What’s 5,589
times 3,972 divided by 17?

123
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:30,829
1,305,853 point 411 etc.

124
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,372
See?
I told you.

125
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:35,583
You know, when McDonald’s
says 13 billion served...

126
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:39,212
it’s not that much. 0nly 43 visits
per person, per year...

127
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:44,676
which is once every 8,49... days.

128
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,429
It turns out
you can't control people...

129
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:50,181
or even predict them.

130
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:54,227
But numbers are different. As I use
to say, you can count on them.

131
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,987
People with Asperger's want contact
with other people very much.

132
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,783
We're just pathetically
clueless at it, that’s all.

133
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,538
When I was 14, I was on my own.

134
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,374
"So I used to hitchhike
to get around."

135
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,918
"One day, this guy pulled over
In a pick-up truck..."

136
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,963
"and he said
that I had a pretty smile."

137
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:24,132
<i>So, I got in.</i>

138
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,386
"And he raped me before
we got to the next town."

139
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,059
You see, I thought that,
if I had sex with men...

140
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,643
they would want me
to be around them.

141
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,896
Why would you want that?

142
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,775
Because I've had sex
with women, sugar.

143
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,986
And it’s so dumb.
There's no thing!

144
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,948
0h, that’s disgusting!

145
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,784
Does anybody else have a...

146
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,497
Donald!

147
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:57,916
-Donald!
-Excuse me, guys.

148
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,463
Hey, why are you laughing?

149
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:06,925
I just told you I was raped.

150
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,762
Keep laughing, ladies.

151
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,557
I don't care what my shrink says.
I'm out of here!

152
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:18,144
Excuse me. Is there some kind
of confusion here?

153
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,148
This is no damn confusion,
this is a fight.

154
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,151
Hi, I'm Donald Morton.
We haven't met.

155
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,529
Can you tell the difference
between confusion and a fight...

156
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,739
or are you just as dingy
as they are?

157
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,117
Some of us aren't as functional
as the others...

158
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,952
but that’s no reason
to call anyone “dingy?

159
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,996
Don't... Don't condescend
to this women.

160
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:38,832
They're no crazier than I am.

161
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,375
Yes, we are!

162
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,710
I'm weird,
but I'm not strange!

163
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,588
You're right. This is no matter of
confusion. It’s a matter of discord.

164
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:48,883
That’s a nice sweater.

165
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:58,059
Look, this is my first time
in your little fish tank...

166
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:01,646
and I'm just giving these women
a lesson from my heart...

167
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,648
which they sorely need.

168
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,233
So that’s all about self-esteem.

169
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,777
You can kiss my self-esteem butt,
Donald Duck!

170
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,655
Why tell your life story...

171
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,158
...and tell only the good parts?
-It’s Donald Morton.

172
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,451
You're missing my point!

173
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,703
No, I'm not.
I just never know what to say.

174
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,014
Neither do I.

175
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:44,355
We're quite the pair, huh?

176
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,284
What’s the point?

177
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,870
Not being alone.

178
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,999
Considering who we are,
what the hell is so great about that?

179
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,457
Her name's Isabelle Sorensen.

180
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,626
She's 8 letters
on each of her names.

181
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:50,422
I have 6 on each of mine.
So it must be good luck.

182
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,760
I don't know why I got so angry.

183
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,887
I guess I just do that.

184
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,891
He yelled right back at me, which
was pretty cool. Don't you think?

185
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,732
322. That’s another good sign.

186
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:14,028
That’s the number of days
she's older than me, times 3.

187
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:20,577
Which makes her 966 days
older than me.

188
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:24,998
He said that
he never knows what to say.

189
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,876
You ever knew a guy
who actually admit that?

190
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:32,088
It means we were both born
on Thursday.

191
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,132
0nly not the same Thursday.

192
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:40,305
Then again, he is autistic.
Did I tell you that he's tall?

193
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,516
Hey, Bongo.

194
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,979
It’s nice to obsess on something
beautiful, for a change.

195
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,919
<i>Hello. Hello?</i>

196
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,678
First I'd better get a machine,
don't you think?

197
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:26,309
I was the first one to join
after Donald formed the group.

198
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:27,769
He has Asperger's, you know.

199
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:31,106
Somebody told me that he's good
with numbers. Is that true?

200
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,900
Yes, he's very good.
But his numbers are...

201
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:37,404
-Really? What do you do?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm a writer.

202
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:39,322
-You write?
-Yeah.

203
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,200
But you shouldn’t read my writing
because it repels women.

204
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,203
...unless you count 19... 24...

205
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,248
with no record keeping a suspect.

206
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,807
0n the humidity front,
the only item on the note was in...

207
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,559
Hyderabad,
in the South of India.

208
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,978
Have you ever had real sex,
Gregory?

209
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,774
Excuse me.

210
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:23,032
Considering the season,
it’s something...

211
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:24,868
of attention, really.

212
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:33,752
What was weather like at the
second McKinley inaugural?

213
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,046
-That would’ve been...
-March 4th, 1901 A.D.

214
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:41,426
Big snow. High temperature's
17 degrees. 3.4 inches...

215
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,970
low temperature's minus 5 degrees.

216
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,851
What did you say to her?

217
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:53,897
I said I was a writer,
but she shouldn’t read my oeuvre...

218
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:55,398
as it repels women.

219
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,484
And then, what did she say?

220
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,320
Try me.

221
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:02,822
It figures.

222
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,743
She's coming
to the Halloween party with me.

223
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,794
That’s great.
Tell me about it.

224
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,670
I'm gonna go as Batman.

225
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,299
A whimsical commentary
on today's decaying popular culture.

226
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,511
-0h, yeah? What’s she going as?
-Who cares?

227
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:27,305
-I do.
-Ask her.

228
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:30,809
-Ask her what she's going...
-Ask her if she'll come with me.

229
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:35,397
-I was seized by terror.
-I don't know if I can do that.

230
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,816
You both have Asperger's,
you both share the language...

231
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,984
of emotional dysfunction,
whereas I, on the other hand...

232
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:43,029
just irritate the shit out of everyone!
Even you.

233
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,490
She likes you though.
She laughed.

234
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:49,536
Everybody laughs at me. It doesn't
commit them to a Halloween party.

235
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,458
Please.

236
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,422
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other day.

237
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,300
That looks nice.

238
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:09,431
My cookie!
Can't eat my cookie!

239
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,433
-You can't do that!
-It’s my cookie!

240
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,435
That’s not okay!

241
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,937
It’s mine!

242
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:17,647
Stop! Stop!

243
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,524
It’s okay.
It’s okay.

244
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,276
It’s okay.

245
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,114
All right, I'm sorry.
But you can't do that.

246
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,032
I'm gonna call my parents now.

247
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,702
They'll pick me up
for the bulletin board.

248
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,579
Save it for later. Yeah.

249
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:37,500
I'll call my parents on the phone...

250
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,211
to pick me up at the bulletin board.

251
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:42,547
Hi, Donald.

252
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,428
You remember me?

253
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,263
Yes.

254
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:52,599
Good.

255
00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:59,189
You know what Gregory
told me about you?

256
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:01,191
I'm good with numbers.

257
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,818
You spoiled my surprise.

258
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,738
-I take things literally.
-Me too.

259
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:19,042
0ne time, when I was 7 years old,
my dad took me to a diner...

260
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,212
for breakfast
and he said “Hominy grits?..

261
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,755
and I thought that
he said “how many?..

262
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,590
and I was supposed to count
how many there were.

263
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,258
-How many were there?
-437.

264
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,433
That was a joke. It’s not that
I remember anything stupid...

265
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,477
as how many hominy grits.

266
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:43,400
I have to go now.
I gotta feed my animals.

267
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:46,027
I have six birds myself.

268
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,459
Isabelle, there's something I need to
talk to you about that’s important.

269
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,965
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?

270
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:08,842
Yes.

271
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:12,137
Good.

272
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:17,517
Bye.

273
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,728
-Bye!
-Bye.

274
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,278
Hi, Isabelle.

275
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:37,537
Hi, Isabelle. Hi.

276
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:42,375
Hi, Isabelle.
Isabelle, hello.

277
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,644
Izzy, I don't think he likes that.

278
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,364
Isn't that funny?

279
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:23,792
He's smiling.
He's smiling.

280
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,755
And see this?
This is a friendly gesture.

281
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,091
Show me yours, come on.

282
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:43,937
You know, a mandrill spends
two hours a day eating breakfast.

283
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:45,605
So, when you think about it,
that’s...

284
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:49,734
2,628,000 seconds
a year eating breakfast...

285
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:51,736
which only leaves him...

286
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:57,742
28 million... 908 thousand seconds
a year not to eat breakfast.

287
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:06,292
You know, I don't have to do numbers
all the time. I can control myself.

288
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:08,420
Don't stop.

289
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:11,506
Don't ever stop.
I love it.

290
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,842
That’s good, because I can't.

291
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:16,469
I know that. Neither can I.

292
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:18,346
We're autistic.

293
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,474
Like I can't stand the sound
of clanging metal.

294
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:24,185
If I hear it,
I completely freak out.

295
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:27,814
I learned a long time ago that I...
I can't...

296
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:31,985
keep from shocking people,
so I just make it work for me.

297
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,862
Sometimes.

298
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,450
I always say what I think.

299
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:42,120
Not because it’s good.
It’s just that I can't censor it.

300
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:46,833
The women at the park the other day,
I think I really freaked them out.

301
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,336
I hope that
they'll forgive me sometime.

302
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:52,714
Isabelle,
what you said about rape...

303
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:57,260
Rape is a very bad thing,
it’s never funny.

304
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:01,931
Not ever.

305
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,498
That’s your guts
speaking out just now.

306
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,708
Not really.

307
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:30,335
No, it did.

308
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:33,046
It did. It did.

309
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:36,466
Because you are attracted to me.

310
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,969
And you want to make
a good impression.

311
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:44,557
And guts makes
a really good impression.

312
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,859
This is how the birds are
in my apartment.

313
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:56,736
Mine too.

314
00:23:56,945 --> 00:24:00,532
They're trying to evict me. Some
kind of phobia about animal poop.

315
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:03,243
That’s too bad.

316
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,206
I think that tonight we should
sneak back in here...

317
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:11,876
and set all the animals free,
except for the polar bears.

318
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:15,338
It’s too warm.
That was a joke.

319
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,091
So, it’s time!

320
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:20,927
You have something to tell me,
remember?

321
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:31,062
My friend Gregory wants to take you
to the Halloween party.

322
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,401
Is that it?

323
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:41,156
I don't go to the
Halloween party ever, so...

324
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,703
My friends dress up
on Halloween...

325
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:49,831
to hide who they really are.
And...

326
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:52,959
That’s sad, but credible.

327
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,962
I've a costume too.

328
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,756
At home.

329
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:02,802
But it reveals who I really am,
and nobody knows.

330
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:11,478
You take me to the party.
Wear your costume.

331
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:15,398
I would be so honored.

332
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:20,487
In fact, let’s not go to the party.
Just meet me at the mall.

333
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:23,615
Everyone is in costume,
they won't even notice us.

334
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:28,703
That’s what I love
about Halloween.

335
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,918
Hi, Isabelle. Hi.

336
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:39,339
Hoy, Hoy. Hello.

337
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:43,134
Hello, Isabelle.

338
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:47,806
Hello, Isabelle.
Isabelle.

339
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,235
I'm 9 hours and 37 minutes early.

340
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:03,321
Which is a good sign,
because that’s 577 minutes.

341
00:26:05,156 --> 00:26:06,866
Prime number.

342
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:12,497
So, what’s up, Isabelle?

343
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,230
I'm late.

344
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:40,692
Which is ironic, because I started
out 9 hours and 23 minutes early.

345
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:15,643
You know what?
At this point...

346
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:17,437
probably better not to go at all,
you think?

347
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:25,236
I mean, she probably left already.

348
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,199
And if she didn't, she'll just be
really irritated when I show up.

349
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:32,911
And I wouldn’t know what to say.

350
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,580
You know how I get when
I don't know what to say.

351
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:39,292
Probably better not to go at all.

352
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:46,508
That’s our doorbell.

353
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:49,260
I'll be right back.

354
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:56,601
Nice whale costume.

355
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:03,191
-Dr. Mozart, I presume.
-Mozart wasn't a doctor.

356
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:15,870
Symphony 40, G Minor.

357
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,331
It’s about anger, passion,
and transcendence.

358
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:21,835
-Like you.
-Thanks.

359
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:25,505
I'm sorry I'm 63 minutes late.
I really was gonna come, I just...

360
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:29,092
That’s okay, I just figured
you screwed up. Come on.

361
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:36,141
So, I was going to take
the 303 bus instead of the 809.

362
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:41,020
And then I was thinking about
how 303 square is 91,809...

363
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:44,107
and the last 3 digits
are the same as 809, so...

364
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,776
I just forgot which one I was
gonna take. Then I thought...

365
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:50,905
Like I said!
I figured you screwed up.

366
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:54,325
Come on, we're going this way.

367
00:28:57,495 --> 00:29:00,123
-So this is who you really are?
-Yeah.

368
00:29:00,415 --> 00:29:02,125
This is so hot!

369
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:05,211
Are you in there?

370
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:07,547
Mr. Jonah!

371
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,510
What are you laughing at, toots?
At least my boyfriend is a vegetarian!

372
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,346
You have a boyfriend?

373
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,810
No, it’s a joke.

374
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,689
You are the vegetarian
because you're a whale.

375
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:27,525
Whales aren't vegetarians.
They eat krill.

376
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:30,153
-So why is that?
-Because they're tiny shrimp.

377
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:32,489
That you're a whale?

378
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:34,824
For lots of reasons.

379
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:36,951
Name six.

380
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,414
-For one, they're very big.
-Really?

381
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,249
-Yeah.
-And...?

382
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,880
All my life I kind of felt
I was on the sidewise...

383
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,882
like watching the parade go by.

384
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,761
When you are a whale,
you are the parade.

385
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:58,765
I bet you know all about whales.

386
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:01,017
-Yes.
-Well, tell me.

387
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:04,104
Well, it’s a very long story.

388
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,483
Well, the last bus isn't
for another two hours...

389
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,568
47 minutes and three...

390
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:12,987
No, two, one.
0ne second.

391
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:15,365
Quick, Donald, tell me!

392
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:32,799
Well, the bus is coming.

393
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,801
Yep.

394
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:42,225
So, Donald, this is our first kiss.

395
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:44,811
No tongue.

396
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,070
Why don't you take this thing off?
You don't need it anymore.

397
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:58,074
I'm not quite so sure
what I'm wearing underneath.

398
00:30:58,283 --> 00:31:00,034
Well, what the hell?

399
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:04,581
Let’s lift it up.

400
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:09,294
0kay, Mr. Whale, you can go.
Just there.

401
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:13,923
That’s nice.

402
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:17,343
That was a mix up
at the laundromat.

403
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:23,892
0n second thought, maybe
we should have some tongue.

404
00:31:33,443 --> 00:31:34,527
Call me!

405
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,203
When?

406
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:47,707
When should I call you?

407
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,720
Hey, move.

408
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,555
0kay, move.

409
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:46,516
Sit down.

410
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:50,103
All right, just don't bite me.

411
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:55,400
Honey, scoot.

412
00:32:57,152 --> 00:33:01,072
"Long messages are cheerfully
ignored. Get it over with."

413
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,619
"This is Donald Morton.
This is my eighth message."

414
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:08,663
At least.

415
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,832
"Hey, I'm sorry I called
so many times, but..."

416
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,834
<i>you didn’t say when to call, so I...</i>

417
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:15,044
"Well, listen,
I won't bother you anymore."

418
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:16,421
That’s what you said the last time.

419
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:19,132
"I just wanted to say again
I had a whale a time last night..."

420
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:21,760
<i>and I...</i>

421
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,513
"I understand.
I really do."

422
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:29,642
"And I'm always gonna
remember you..."

423
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:31,811
<i>and the times we had...</i>

424
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,021
<i>and...</i>

425
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:34,689
Donald Duck!

426
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:38,526
<i>You're home.</i>

427
00:33:42,614 --> 00:33:45,700
I didn't call because I didn't
really know what to say to you.

428
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:50,371
Donald, I don't know where
you and I could ever go.

429
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:53,208
<i>We can go to the amusement park.</i>

430
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:01,841
Donald, you can see everything
from up here!

431
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,511
Look at the sky.
It’s the same color as my jacket!

432
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:08,890
-I'm sure it’s amazing.
-It is. Especially to the East...

433
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,101
where the sun's setting.

434
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,897
-Actually, the sun sets on the West.
-Will stop making conversation?

435
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:20,443
This is somewhat disappointing.
Just open your eyes, it’s great!

436
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:32,997
It’s kind of like in the arcade.
When I want to factor a number...

437
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:36,251
I just...
I visualize it...

438
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:38,837
going across my eyes.

439
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:41,047
Pick a number.

440
00:34:41,256 --> 00:34:42,924
589.

441
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:45,343
0kay. So then I shoot
prime numbers at it, so...

442
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:48,388
3 won't go into it and
5 won't go in it.

443
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:51,683
It won't even have a chance
because it doesn't end in a 5 or a 0.

444
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,353
And then...
You know, 7, 11.

445
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:59,441
19. When I shoot 19,
it breaks into two...

446
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,484
19 and 31.

447
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:06,406
Your process if very sexual.

448
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,493
Primes are hot.

449
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,787
I like you.

450
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:16,249
You're so smart!
So cool!

451
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,419
You wanna know the secret
to this one? It’s good.

452
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:24,007
You see, you just...

453
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:28,094
you throw them all
at the same time, just...

454
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,180
No, don't...

455
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,237
Stop it!

456
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,656
Stop it!

457
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:16,684
Excuse me.

458
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,187
Hey, it’s okay.

459
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:20,980
It’s okay.

460
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:25,026
We won a panda.
We got 4 rings on them.

461
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:27,070
Can we go home now?

462
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,409
Don't freak out!

463
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,202
It’s okay, I'm better now.

464
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:36,121
I was talking to them.

465
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:40,959
Hello!
Come on, sweet baby.

466
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:45,547
Don't worry,
I'm just talking to him.

467
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:48,341
-That’s Cockatoo Dundee.
-Hey, Dundee.

468
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,845
That’s Ricky, and that’s Lucy.

469
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:55,098
That’s Piyachi, Chicken Boo.

470
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:57,642
And this is Don Juan de Marco.

471
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:02,063
Let's have a look
around the house, guys.

472
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:10,572
I save things because
you never know. You know?

473
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:13,908
You said your mom died.
You did bury her?

474
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:16,995
-Yeah.
-Just checking.

475
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:19,914
Let’s sit down, huh?

476
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,586
0kay, guys.

477
00:37:24,794 --> 00:37:26,087
Come on.

478
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:27,756
That’s it.

479
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:29,883
Come on.

480
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:33,470
All right.
You can sit here.

481
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:35,472
You want to sit here?

482
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,601
Come on. There you go.
You can get off too now.

483
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:42,771
See, you can go here.
There you are.

484
00:37:45,023 --> 00:37:46,983
You want something to eat?

485
00:37:47,942 --> 00:37:49,778
You got any old food in the fridge?

486
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:53,490
I got lots of old food.
You like old food?

487
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:56,159
Donald.

488
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,828
This is about sex.

489
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:06,294
I'm sorry.
Was that a little abrupt?

490
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:11,716
It’s just that I haven't had any...

491
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:16,471
in a long, long time.

492
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:21,017
Yeah.

493
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:24,687
I had an instinct there.

494
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:31,569
But sex is gonna be terrific.

495
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,785
It’s the most fun you can have
with your clothes off.

496
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:43,331
I'm sure you've been
with more attractive men.

497
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,709
Are you kidding me?
You are so hot.

498
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:52,465
Anyway, attraction
is a whole package.

499
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:57,554
And I've never been
with anyone like you.

500
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,765
You mean the hygiene?

501
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:05,311
You know how many guys
would take me home...

502
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,188
after that show at the ring toss?

503
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:10,108
Plenty.

504
00:39:12,861 --> 00:39:15,530
Well, they wouldn’t be there
in the morning.

505
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,950
I'll be there in the morning.
I live here.

506
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:24,372
Is there a pathway
to your bedroom?

507
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:33,089
You want to go?

508
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:36,051
Now?

509
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:39,512
Yeah.

510
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:50,899
You know how
in the jungle they say that...

511
00:39:51,107 --> 00:39:54,611
some elephants have longer trunks
and some of them have shorter ones?

512
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:07,040
Well, I don't care how long
the elephant 's trunk is...

513
00:40:07,332 --> 00:40:09,626
as long as his thing's okay.

514
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:18,510
Sweetie, you can't disappoint me.

515
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:23,973
'Cause whatever you are...

516
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:27,102
is exactly what I want.

517
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:36,504
Isabelle!

518
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:46,181
You know, at first, I was upset
that she didn't even leave a note!

519
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,770
Then I realized that was a kindness.

520
00:41:52,604 --> 00:41:54,397
She's a sweet person.

521
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:57,358
Why hurt my feelings, you know?

522
00:41:57,817 --> 00:42:00,236
The less said, the better,
you think?

523
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:06,367
So we just tuck it away, you know.
Just leave it.

524
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:10,663
She said a lot of beautiful things.

525
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:15,251
The fact that she didn't mean it
only makes it nicer.

526
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:19,756
I mean, what was she gonna say?
“Thanks for the lousy sex?

527
00:42:20,298 --> 00:42:22,258
Are you talking about me?

528
00:42:22,842 --> 00:42:25,261
I just had to go home
and feed my animals.

529
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,185
You know what I think
we should do today?

530
00:42:32,685 --> 00:42:34,729
Buy you a nice suit.

531
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:36,231
Sure.

532
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:39,150
This is my best friend, Bongo.
“Hello!

533
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,862
-I'm just doing the dishes.
-Cool.

534
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,699
Yeah...

535
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,785
cool.

536
00:42:51,746 --> 00:42:53,415
Here they are.

537
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:56,751
Yeah. He's coming.
He is coming.

538
00:43:01,798 --> 00:43:03,508
Where have you been?

539
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:07,095
I thought our friends deserved to
know the truth of your treachery.

540
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:10,557
-I believe in the truth.
-You believe in gossip.

541
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:14,269
Are you sleeping with him?

542
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:17,105
Janice, that’s a personal question.

543
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:21,192
Sure, is that okay with you?

544
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,113
Don't you hate all his numbers?
Does he change his socks?

545
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,866
Is his penis big enough?

546
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:30,243
No, no, and yes.

547
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:36,207
Would you take me to the movies
on Sunday at 5?

548
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:39,669
Janice, Sundays
I'm with Isabelle. Sorry.

549
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:45,175
This is a classic vicious betrayal,
very common in literature!

550
00:43:46,593 --> 00:43:48,178
And life.

551
00:43:54,017 --> 00:43:56,478
Hey.
Nice to see you again, Gregory.

552
00:43:57,353 --> 00:43:59,856
It’s very nice to smell you.

553
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,778
As you all know...

554
00:44:05,862 --> 00:44:09,157
Isabelle and I have been seeing
each other since Halloween.

555
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,826
And maybe we should talk
about how you feel about this.

556
00:44:12,035 --> 00:44:13,912
It’s sexual harassment!

557
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:16,831
That’s a very serious accusation!

558
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,835
You used your position to extort
sexual favors, you should be replaced.

559
00:44:22,003 --> 00:44:23,004
My sister's a lawyer.

560
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:26,424
Gregory, Donald and I are just
getting to know each other.

561
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:29,886
-So, you can still date me?
-Right now, I just wanna see Donald.

562
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:32,722
So, when you're sick of him,
you can date me?

563
00:44:34,265 --> 00:44:36,101
Skeets, let’s hear from you.

564
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:39,771
Do you have any questions
about me and Isabelle?

565
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:43,858
There are 200 to 300 million sperm
cells in the average ejaculation.

566
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,408
Penguins mate only once a year...

567
00:44:51,616 --> 00:44:53,910
and it lasts 3 minutes.

568
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:58,915
I think they're extremely sexy.
You wanna know why?

569
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:02,085
I'm only gonna tell you
if you wanna know.

570
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,088
-I wanna know.
-I don't, and that’s for sure.

571
00:45:05,296 --> 00:45:06,881
Skeets?

572
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:10,969
When penguins are reunited after
a long separation...

573
00:45:11,177 --> 00:45:14,597
they stand breast to breast
their heads are thrown back...

574
00:45:14,806 --> 00:45:18,017
and their little flippers are trembling
and they sing, Skeets...

575
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:20,770
because they're so happy
to find each other.

576
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:25,066
Gracie, how do you feel?

577
00:45:27,026 --> 00:45:29,404
I feel sad.

578
00:45:30,822 --> 00:45:32,449
About me and Isabelle?

579
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:36,745
Bronwin's daddy has blood cancer.

580
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:43,501
Regular people get sick too,
not just autistic people...

581
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,628
that’s just the way it is.

582
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:56,514
Yeah, but these days lots of people
get better from chemotherapy and...

583
00:45:56,723 --> 00:46:00,268
I have to go now. My parents are
meeting me at the bulletin...

584
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,194
The meeting just started.
Maybe your parents will be there...

585
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:12,072
...in a little while.
-Would you like me to go with you?

586
00:46:12,697 --> 00:46:15,658
We could call your parents
and we could wait together...

587
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:18,453
by the bulletin board.

588
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,627
I'd like to do that.

589
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:38,223
I'll go too.

590
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,642
Not today.

591
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:49,984
-Can I go to the funeral?
-I'm not going, and that’s for sure.

592
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:51,903
Donald!

593
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:31,943
All right.
Just for one day, nobody shit.

594
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:17,155
Yuck!

595
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:19,532
That is so gross!

596
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:22,452
Izzy, I'm home!

597
00:49:21,386 --> 00:49:22,554
0h, no.

598
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,899
What did you do?

599
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,986
Where's my stuff?

600
00:49:38,194 --> 00:49:39,612
Did you hear, Izzy?

601
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:42,073
Everything's here.
It’s just organized.

602
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:47,704
I thought you'd like it.

603
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:52,542
Well, now I know where everything
is, so you'd better be nice to me...

604
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:55,044
or I'll take the secret
to my grave.

605
00:49:55,253 --> 00:49:57,714
Where's my shower curtain, huh?

606
00:49:57,922 --> 00:49:59,215
I threw it out.

607
00:50:01,217 --> 00:50:02,802
What? God!

608
00:50:03,053 --> 00:50:05,930
Well, I called the Center
for Disease Control in Atlanta...

609
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,932
but it was more
than they could handle.

610
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:11,019
It was mine!
This is all my stuff!

611
00:50:11,227 --> 00:50:13,396
You had no right to do this!

612
00:50:13,605 --> 00:50:15,774
I thought you'd like it.

613
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:20,153
You stole my life.

614
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,259
285410.
Got the 2,85.

615
00:51:09,577 --> 00:51:12,247
-Trying to get yourself killed?
-Maybe later.

616
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:17,335
H-Lime.
What’s that supposed to mean?

617
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:22,298
Harry Lime. 0rson Welles.
“The Third Man?

618
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:24,759
It’s a movie.

619
00:51:26,136 --> 00:51:28,012
Your plate’s better.

620
00:51:28,638 --> 00:51:31,015
You can trade the letters for
Roman numerals, that’s 215.

621
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:33,768
If you add the one, that’s 216.
That’s 6 cubed.

622
00:51:34,185 --> 00:51:36,354
27 is 3 cubed.

623
00:51:39,149 --> 00:51:41,901
I'm doing all the numbers
in the parking lot.

624
00:51:42,777 --> 00:51:44,404
It helps calming me down.

625
00:51:45,113 --> 00:51:47,991
-Did you lose your job?
-No, my woman.

626
00:51:49,743 --> 00:51:51,453
And my shower curtain.

627
00:51:53,705 --> 00:51:56,166
What’s your social security number?

628
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:05,425
Stop calling!

629
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:08,636
<i>Hi. This is my 14th message.</i>

630
00:52:09,012 --> 00:52:12,849
"Listen, I respectfully think
you should change your greeting..."

631
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:15,185
"in case you get called
by your boss."

632
00:52:16,144 --> 00:52:18,897
<i>Seriously, I'm fine now.</i>

633
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:25,695
"And I'm sorry I spoiled our evening.
I am really, really sorry."

634
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:28,406
<i>It could never ever happen again.</i>

635
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,325
"I mean, to hell
with the shower curtain."

636
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,677
Hey.

637
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,435
Sorry.

638
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:52,532
Everyone...

639
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:54,951
this is my boyfriend.

640
00:53:59,247 --> 00:54:00,999
Donald Morton.

641
00:54:03,626 --> 00:54:04,753
0h, the shower curtain.

642
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:06,713
Mac Farraday.

643
00:54:07,046 --> 00:54:08,757
Brenda Mackey.

644
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:10,425
Wanda...

645
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,135
my mentor.

646
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:14,971
I bought him this suit.

647
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,307
It was on sale. Hey.

648
00:55:09,943 --> 00:55:13,405
0ne of the reasons
that I cleaned your apartment...

649
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:15,365
0h, boy, it’s great.

650
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:18,201
The cleaner the better,
that’s what I say.

651
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:21,704
It’s so that we can have
our friends over, Donald!

652
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,749
Izzy, we don't have friends
who come over. Ever.

653
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:27,210
Yeah. Want to guess why?

654
00:55:29,712 --> 00:55:31,089
Not really.

655
00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:35,927
Donald?

656
00:55:36,136 --> 00:55:37,220
Izzy.

657
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:40,014
This is the most peaceful...

658
00:55:40,932 --> 00:55:43,643
the most beautiful place
that I know.

659
00:55:44,644 --> 00:55:48,022
And the world doesn't want it
anymore, so they left it to me.

660
00:55:48,273 --> 00:55:49,607
To us.

661
00:55:49,816 --> 00:55:54,237
This is a special place
that’s just for us.

662
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:57,657
You know what we need?

663
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,286
We need a little house
with a yard...

664
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:04,706
so that we can plant flowers
and sit in the shade...

665
00:56:04,914 --> 00:56:07,292
and kiss under the stars.

666
00:56:08,752 --> 00:56:12,881
The heavens are very
important to me. So...

667
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:16,259
I found this tiny place...

668
00:56:16,468 --> 00:56:19,721
and the rent isn't gonna cost any
more than what we're already paying...

669
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:21,890
with our two apartments.

670
00:56:22,098 --> 00:56:23,808
Izzy, I got fired, remember?

671
00:56:24,017 --> 00:56:30,315
Dr. Jeffries is the woman at the
university who diagnosed me. And...

672
00:56:30,523 --> 00:56:33,485
I was telling her about how
you organized this group...

673
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:36,446
of lonely people
that everybody else ignores.

674
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:40,366
I only did that because
I was lonely too.

675
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:46,998
I was telling her how much
you care for them...

676
00:56:47,165 --> 00:56:49,334
and how much
they love you...

677
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,836
because this is the real work
of your life, Donald...

678
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:54,005
only nobody pays you.

679
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:56,132
So I asked her
if she could find you a job...

680
00:56:56,341 --> 00:56:58,593
at the university that would enable
you to continue...

681
00:56:58,802 --> 00:57:00,220
...this invaluable...
-You did what?

682
00:57:00,428 --> 00:57:02,889
And she said yes, yes, yes!

683
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:08,144
Izzy, they don't have cabs
at the University Medical Center.

684
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:14,067
Donald Duck,
it comes down to this:

685
00:57:15,985 --> 00:57:17,987
do you want to make me happy?

686
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:29,499
For one thing, I understand
you're a mathematical genius.

687
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:31,251
Who said that?

688
00:57:31,459 --> 00:57:33,837
Dr. Jeffries recommended
that I called...

689
00:57:34,045 --> 00:57:36,131
Isabelle Sorensen.

690
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:39,968
I hope that was all right.

691
00:57:40,176 --> 00:57:42,846
It’s her fault
that I'm here in the first pace.

692
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:50,770
And after everything she told me and
checking on your excellent record...

693
00:57:50,979 --> 00:57:56,401
in college I'm wondering why you
choose to drive a taxi for a living.

694
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:02,574
At my interview with IBM
after I graduated college...

695
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:06,244
they asked me what
my plans were and I said:

696
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:08,621
“Probably go to McDonald’s
for a12-piece McNugget...

697
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:11,541
and 2 cheeseburgers
and then do my laundry?

698
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,084
Did they laugh at least?

699
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,004
They smiled and
they said they'd call me.

700
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:20,049
They didn't.

701
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:27,891
Mr. Morton, I run Administrative
Services for the Medical Center.

702
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:32,437
Your profile is a plus because
we want to give opportunities to...

703
00:58:32,604 --> 00:58:33,605
people with special needs.

704
00:58:33,813 --> 00:58:36,191
You can say “autistic?
I already know.

705
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:38,526
“Touché”.

706
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:43,198
The job would be looking at statistical
runs finding inconsistencies.

707
00:58:43,573 --> 00:58:46,451
Telling me where the computer got it
wrong. You can do that, can't you?

708
00:58:46,618 --> 00:58:47,619
Well, sure.

709
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:51,414
Well, I can't, and neither can
anybody else I've ever met. So...

710
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,376
I'm blessed to have you.

711
00:59:14,229 --> 00:59:16,147
Where do you want me to put him?

712
01:00:14,205 --> 01:00:15,707
-Donald!
-What?

713
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:17,834
Prepare to die!

714
01:00:19,669 --> 01:00:21,588
0kay. Ready?

715
01:00:21,796 --> 01:00:23,089
-No.
-Yes, you are.

716
01:00:23,298 --> 01:00:25,383
-No.
-It’s gonna be fine

717
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:28,553
0kay. Scissors.
First, water. Ready?

718
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:31,056
0ne, two, three.

719
01:00:31,222 --> 01:00:33,183
-Water.
-No, no, no.

720
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:35,518
-Donald, chill!
-No.

721
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:38,772
Come on, it’s gonna be fine.
Come here.

722
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:40,523
-Hello!
-Hi.

723
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:42,567
Nice day, huh?

724
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:48,156
I think they're the neighbors.

725
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:54,204
It’s too expensive, Dundee.
It’s too expensive.

726
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:02,921
All right.

727
01:01:04,172 --> 01:01:05,757
Have a good day.

728
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:07,717
Bye.

729
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:16,434
Isabelle, there's something
I need to talk to you about that...

730
01:01:16,643 --> 01:01:18,311
sometimes you find...

731
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,938
kind of enraging.

732
01:01:20,146 --> 01:01:21,439
-0h, yeah?
-Yeah.

733
01:01:21,689 --> 01:01:22,816
Try me.

734
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,574
Tonight, when my boss
comes here for dinner...

735
01:01:31,783 --> 01:01:33,910
I just want everything to be...

736
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,871
really nice.

737
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:39,416
You know?

738
01:01:39,624 --> 01:01:43,670
He's a really good person,
and I really like my job.

739
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,923
-I just want everything...
-To be nice.

740
01:01:47,757 --> 01:01:49,759
-Yeah.
-0kay.

741
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:56,266
Have a nice day at work.

742
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:02,647
You too.

743
01:02:07,736 --> 01:02:08,987
Bye!

744
01:02:16,828 --> 01:02:18,288
Izzy, we're home!

745
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:25,044
Can you shut the door?

746
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:30,425
I told her to put everybody in his
or her cages respectively, but...

747
01:02:30,633 --> 01:02:31,718
she didn't, and...

748
01:02:32,093 --> 01:02:35,263
Come on, you guys. Come on.
Come on, you guys.

749
01:02:35,472 --> 01:02:37,974
Stay, stay. Come on.

750
01:02:43,688 --> 01:02:45,148
There she is.

751
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:47,734
Izzy!

752
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:51,529
All the birds were out.

753
01:02:52,822 --> 01:02:56,367
Hank Wallace, Isabelle.
Nice to put a face with the voice.

754
01:02:56,576 --> 01:03:00,622
That’s right. We talked about
what a genius Mr. Morton is.

755
01:03:00,872 --> 01:03:02,707
Not to mention a saint.

756
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:05,585
Well, only this morning...

757
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:08,671
he advised me to be on my very
tippy-toed best behavior tonight...

758
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:10,799
so I don't weird you out.

759
01:03:11,007 --> 01:03:13,760
So feel free to advise me
if I deviate from normality...

760
01:03:13,968 --> 01:03:15,804
at anytime.

761
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:18,640
Sense of humor.
We're working on it.

762
01:03:18,848 --> 01:03:21,518
-Do you like vegetable lasagna?
-Sure.

763
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,729
How about a beer?
See you inside!

764
01:03:25,814 --> 01:03:28,108
It’s great vegetable lasagna.

765
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:34,948
I don't pretend to be
an expert, but...

766
01:03:35,198 --> 01:03:38,076
That’s great! 'Cause I hate it
when people do that.

767
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:40,870
But your paintings are impressive.

768
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:42,414
0h, yeah.

769
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:43,832
Thank you.

770
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,917
Most people want me to paint
something else, you know...

771
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:49,879
with fewer eyes,
Less violent, less insane.

772
01:03:50,547 --> 01:03:53,383
I used to tell Donald that
I wanted him to hear my paintings...

773
01:03:53,591 --> 01:03:55,552
and see my music
'cause I wanted him...

774
01:03:55,802 --> 01:03:57,429
to understand them
like other people couldn’t.

775
01:03:57,637 --> 01:04:01,266
She doesn't understand that I can.
And I do.

776
01:04:01,808 --> 01:04:03,810
And most people do.
It’s pretty normal.

777
01:04:11,025 --> 01:04:13,445
I'm basically a failure, Hank.

778
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:16,448
In the material world
I used to be a piano tuner.

779
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:18,867
-She's perfect pitch.
-I made good money.

780
01:04:19,075 --> 01:04:22,787
It’s a valued trade, but half the clients
hit on me, and the other half...

781
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:26,958
would say something stupid enough
to where I'd blurt out something rude.

782
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:31,880
I say things as I think them,
you know?

783
01:04:32,088 --> 01:04:33,506
0ut loud, most of the times.

784
01:04:33,715 --> 01:04:38,595
Can't hold my temper and, arrogant,
impatient, and I don't suffer fools.

785
01:04:40,513 --> 01:04:42,891
I have a good heart,
believe it or not...

786
01:04:43,099 --> 01:04:44,976
but it doesn't pay so good, so...

787
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:49,064
I'm lucky that I have a wonderful
guy who's also very generous.

788
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:52,734
Did he tell you about
our plans for the house?

789
01:04:55,153 --> 01:04:58,323
Well, they're not exactly plans
that we plan to implement...

790
01:04:58,531 --> 01:05:00,241
Just maybe ideas, more...

791
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,703
We're going to put this big sandbox
right here in the living room...

792
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:07,165
so people and animals can play...
Whatever!

793
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:11,669
And then, outside we're going
to put this big aviary...

794
01:05:11,878 --> 01:05:13,880
so birds and lizards and Bongo
can hang out.

795
01:05:14,047 --> 01:05:16,049
-Have you met Bongo?
-No, not officially.

796
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:19,094
Have you noticed that winters are
coming later and later every year?

797
01:05:20,553 --> 01:05:21,596
-I like that.
-Have you?

798
01:05:21,805 --> 01:05:23,973
And it was actually
Donald’s idea that we put...

799
01:05:24,182 --> 01:05:27,435
a piano in the yard so that all the
local animals can listen to me play.

800
01:05:27,685 --> 01:05:29,562
It must be global warming.

801
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:34,859
Interrupting is not the way
to become the focus of attention...

802
01:05:35,068 --> 01:05:36,861
it’s very autistic.

803
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:41,074
Where was I?
The walls.

804
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:43,868
So I'm gonna paint them in this
one-of-a-kind savage colors...

805
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:46,955
and get fabrics to put
all over the carpet and stuff...

806
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:49,541
that scream jungle, you know?
And then...

807
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:53,795
right up there, by the doorway,
I wanna put this whale-shaped thing...

808
01:05:54,003 --> 01:05:56,339
that you have to walk through,
and then eventually...

809
01:05:56,673 --> 01:06:00,593
a full-size aquarium because obviously
we love birds, but we also love fish.

810
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,804
How are we gonna pay for all this?

811
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:09,060
My boss is going
to think that we're crazy.

812
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:11,062
Who got you that job
in the first place?

813
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:13,857
You only got it for me
so I could get you this house...

814
01:06:14,065 --> 01:06:15,150
and these luxuries.

815
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:17,736
Well, it’s obvious we don't share
the same dreams.

816
01:06:17,944 --> 01:06:21,573
That job was for you. And I pushed,
and I sweet-talked you into it...

817
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:24,576
because I knew that you would never
go down there by yourself.

818
01:06:24,784 --> 01:06:28,163
But it was all for you,
so you could be proud of yourself!

819
01:06:30,081 --> 01:06:33,960
I have put up with an array of stuff
from you that no one should tolerate...

820
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:36,629
because I thought that
you would do the same for me.

821
01:06:36,963 --> 01:06:40,508
But you made me feel like a freak.
Behave for your boss?

822
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:45,263
Suddenly this is coming from who,
Mr. Whale Costume? Mr. Toxic Toilet!

823
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:47,057
What about the show
that you put on in there?

824
01:06:47,265 --> 01:06:50,393
Did you do one thing the entire night
that was even halfway normal?

825
01:06:54,439 --> 01:06:59,611
No. Because I was mad and,
sadly, I was just being myself.

826
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,113
0h, that’s yourself?
That’s yourself?

827
01:07:02,822 --> 01:07:04,824
That’s the whole point,
Donald Duck.

828
01:07:06,451 --> 01:07:10,580
You're just one more guy who sees
who I really am and can't handle it.

829
01:07:11,748 --> 01:07:14,042
It broke my heart to see
how scared you were.

830
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,877
-Scared?
-Bringing home your boss to prove...

831
01:07:16,086 --> 01:07:18,713
that you're normal by showing off
your smart pretty little wife?

832
01:07:19,756 --> 01:07:21,966
0nly he saw that she was
just as crazy as you are.

833
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:23,510
Crazier!

834
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:30,433
Crazier!

835
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:35,772
There's one difference
between us, Donald.

836
01:07:37,857 --> 01:07:39,818
You want to be normal.

837
01:07:40,276 --> 01:07:41,611
You crave it.

838
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:45,198
And that is what broke us up.

839
01:07:48,535 --> 01:07:49,994
I'm leaving now.

840
01:07:50,954 --> 01:07:53,206
I don't want you here
when I get back.

841
01:07:53,415 --> 01:07:56,626
I don't want you here ever,
or you will regret it!

842
01:08:40,128 --> 01:08:43,757
"So I got an unlisted number,
but there was no other way."

843
01:08:43,965 --> 01:08:45,925
"I can picture you still calling
every three minutes..."

844
01:08:46,134 --> 01:08:48,720
<i>hoping for some electronic miracle.</i>

845
01:08:48,928 --> 01:08:52,265
"I'm...
I'm not mad anymore, Donald."

846
01:08:53,141 --> 01:08:54,392
<i>I'm okay.</i>

847
01:08:54,601 --> 01:08:56,936
"So don't obsess
on all that stuff I said."

848
01:08:57,145 --> 01:08:59,606
Does she have any idea
who she's talking to?

849
01:08:59,856 --> 01:09:02,317
"I've never been able to stay
with any guy for very long..."

850
01:09:02,525 --> 01:09:05,195
"so I knew I'd end up
breaking your heart."

851
01:09:05,403 --> 01:09:07,906
"A piece of advice:
set a limit on..."

852
01:09:08,114 --> 01:09:10,158
"how many times you play this.
Like 20."

853
01:09:10,366 --> 01:09:13,411
"-And then erase it, okay?
-That’s 32 times that I've heard."

854
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:15,538
It doesn't cost anything.

855
01:09:16,206 --> 01:09:19,042
Don't worry.
I won't go out with her.

856
01:09:21,169 --> 01:09:23,463
I could never do that to you.

857
01:09:45,068 --> 01:09:47,320
Who would go whale-watching?

858
01:09:47,987 --> 01:09:51,616
It’s a wholesome activity,
and the weather should be ideal.

859
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:55,078
But I'm foreseeing conditions
to the contrary, such as a...

860
01:09:55,286 --> 01:09:58,206
Low pressure front which
could really have the boat...

861
01:09:58,415 --> 01:10:00,625
rocking and rolling.

862
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:03,211
The ocean is five hours away.

863
01:10:05,672 --> 01:10:08,758
Yeah, but whales
are Donald’s favorite thing.

864
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,177
And it would cheer him up
from Isabelle dumping him.

865
01:10:12,137 --> 01:10:14,556
I'm not going, and that’s for sure.

866
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:19,310
But you could be
the cruise lecturer.

867
01:10:19,519 --> 01:10:21,479
It’s a very prestigious position.

868
01:10:21,688 --> 01:10:23,898
0r perhaps contrast
the administrations of...

869
01:10:24,107 --> 01:10:26,609
Chester A. Arthur and
Millard Filmore or whatever!

870
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:30,822
Seven. Just two more
for the group rate.

871
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:36,119
Let’s watch a whale.
It’s on Sunday.

872
01:10:36,369 --> 01:10:39,706
Sunday I see my daddy in the hospital.
That’s just the way it is.

873
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:45,003
I could call Isabelle.
She doesn't hate me.

874
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:03,229
I have a list of friends.
Some of them are women.

875
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:35,261
I know why you like living with me.

876
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:37,430
I'm neater than Isabelle.

877
01:11:37,806 --> 01:11:40,433
You're neater than me,
tied up in Bloom and that’s it.

878
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:42,685
I file my food.
Nobody does that.

879
01:11:42,936 --> 01:11:44,979
Can I give you some advice?

880
01:11:45,188 --> 01:11:46,940
Can I humanly stop you?

881
01:11:47,107 --> 01:11:50,527
Stick with the group.
Compared to us, you're a god.

882
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:54,906
And next to Isabelle,
which you will never meet again...

883
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:56,783
you don't come off so hot.

884
01:11:57,534 --> 01:11:59,411
We can't hear you!

885
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,911
You got a message.

886
01:12:43,371 --> 01:12:46,374
-You got 17 of them.
-Actually...

887
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,918
they're not for me.

888
01:12:52,714 --> 01:12:56,593
"Donald.
Donald, please be there, please."

889
01:12:57,427 --> 01:12:59,679
<i>Goddamnit, he's dead, Donald.</i>

890
01:13:00,305 --> 01:13:01,890
<i>Donald, Bongo died.</i>

891
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:05,185
"-That’s her rabbit.
-Where are you?"

892
01:13:18,573 --> 01:13:20,325
I'm so glad you came.

893
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,246
I don't know why I went
over the edge.

894
01:13:25,455 --> 01:13:27,582
I lost pets all my life.

895
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,423
What?

896
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:39,094
I missed you.

897
01:13:44,808 --> 01:13:47,394
You never came for the birds
or the whale.

898
01:13:48,937 --> 01:13:51,022
God, you must have missed them.

899
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:56,945
If I took them away,
this wouldn’t be my home anymore.

900
01:13:59,697 --> 01:14:01,408
Be my friend, Donald.

901
01:14:03,284 --> 01:14:06,538
Be my best friend, please,
because I really need you.

902
01:14:08,248 --> 01:14:11,835
And I always felt you wanted us
to get married or something.

903
01:14:12,085 --> 01:14:13,628
-Did I ever say that?
-Not in words.

904
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,131
But instead of that,
do you want to just be my friend?

905
01:14:17,382 --> 01:14:20,343
-Without the sex?
-Without the pressure.

906
01:14:23,263 --> 01:14:26,099
My friendship is all I have to give.

907
01:14:27,183 --> 01:14:28,476
Do you want it?

908
01:14:31,187 --> 01:14:32,522
0f course.

909
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:42,949
That makes me so happy.

910
01:14:51,082 --> 01:14:54,085
Yeah, but how do you know
that she knows what she wants?

911
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:56,171
I mean, you didn't see the way
that she was looking at me.

912
01:14:56,379 --> 01:14:58,298
That’s because I wasn't there.

913
01:15:00,049 --> 01:15:01,760
Yeah, but she was talking
about marriage.

914
01:15:01,968 --> 01:15:03,928
To tell you that she didn't want to.

915
01:15:05,638 --> 01:15:08,308
Yeah, but I didn't bring it up.
She did.

916
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:10,685
And when I brought up sex,
she didn't exactly say no.

917
01:15:10,894 --> 01:15:13,146
When women want sex,
they usually say yes!

918
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:21,404
-Why are you saying this?
-Donald!

919
01:15:21,613 --> 01:15:23,698
Donald! Donald!

920
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:26,951
If there's one thing I know
it’s chicks.

921
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,998
That was a good load.

922
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,918
Good drier, good pace.

923
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:43,468
Yeah, but...

924
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:47,347
Did you fix your tie?

925
01:15:47,555 --> 01:15:49,933
Your table is ready.
Right this way.

926
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:53,478
This is so pretty, Donald.

927
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:06,324
Look, there's a little fish.
There's three. Hello!

928
01:16:10,328 --> 01:16:14,165
Your chair, miss.
And may I take your coat?

929
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:19,003
-Yes, thank you.
-You're welcome.

930
01:16:22,465 --> 01:16:24,926
-And here's your menu.
-Thank you.

931
01:16:30,098 --> 01:16:32,308
The waiter will be with you soon.

932
01:16:32,517 --> 01:16:35,395
-And have a wonderful evening.
-Thanks.

933
01:16:35,603 --> 01:16:39,524
This is completely irrational.
I'm very impressed.

934
01:16:40,567 --> 01:16:42,318
-Izzy!
-0h, my gosh!

935
01:16:43,778 --> 01:16:45,447
This is gonna cost you a fortune.

936
01:16:45,697 --> 01:16:48,575
He told me this is
the best food in town.

937
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:52,912
I wanted the place
to be special because...

938
01:16:54,122 --> 01:16:56,499
I have something special
to talk about.

939
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:59,669
-Is it a surprise?
-Good evening.

940
01:17:03,173 --> 01:17:04,466
What is it?

941
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:06,301
What is it?

942
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:08,053
Donald?

943
01:17:08,428 --> 01:17:11,389
-Anything from the bar?
-Go away! What?

944
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:13,558
-What is it? Tell me! Tell me!
-Take your time. I'll come back to...

945
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:15,977
...talk about the specials.
-What is it?

946
01:17:20,315 --> 01:17:21,316
Izzy...

947
01:17:23,943 --> 01:17:26,196
I don't think you know
what you want.

948
01:17:28,323 --> 01:17:31,826
You got us a house,
and you got me the job.

949
01:17:35,121 --> 01:17:36,956
And we keep fighting...

950
01:17:37,957 --> 01:17:40,794
but you keep bringing me back
into your life.

951
01:17:42,837 --> 01:17:46,341
And today you brought up marriage,
and I think that you want that.

952
01:17:46,549 --> 01:17:47,801
And I want that too, because...

953
01:17:48,009 --> 01:17:51,096
you're my only chance,
and I want that chance.

954
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,893
That’s very freaking flattering.

955
01:17:59,771 --> 01:18:02,440
You are my only chance
because I love you.

956
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,945
And I'm your only chance
because you love me too.

957
01:18:13,076 --> 01:18:15,036
Marry me, Isabelle.

958
01:18:25,964 --> 01:18:28,716
-Thanks for taking the pressure off!
-Isabelle, don't freak out!

959
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:32,470
-No. You're just like all the others.
-No, I'm not like all the others.

960
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:34,264
I don't want you to save me!

961
01:18:35,223 --> 01:18:37,600
I just want to be left alone!

962
01:19:17,724 --> 01:19:21,186
185. Why did I have
to ask her to marry me?

963
01:19:40,121 --> 01:19:41,456
0kay.

964
01:19:41,873 --> 01:19:43,041
0kay.

965
01:19:43,249 --> 01:19:44,584
47, 48.

966
01:19:48,254 --> 01:19:52,884
No, I got to go home.
I got to tell her not to marry me.

967
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:06,981
Izzy, we got to talk!

968
01:20:10,485 --> 01:20:12,278
Izzy, where are you?

969
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,764
Donald? I'm Dr. Jeffries,
Isabelle's psychiatrist.

970
01:20:40,014 --> 01:20:41,307
-Are you okay?
-Is she okay?

971
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:43,643
I signed the release, and she left.

972
01:20:43,852 --> 01:20:45,812
-Is that safe?
-She's going to be fine.

973
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,397
She'll be in therapy.

974
01:20:47,605 --> 01:20:49,149
She doesn't need therapy.
She's not crazy.

975
01:20:49,357 --> 01:20:52,193
Donald, she needs someone
to listen to her.

976
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:56,698
I'll go home and I'll listen.
I'm an excellent listener.

977
01:20:59,325 --> 01:21:00,744
I'll improve.

978
01:21:04,122 --> 01:21:05,290
No, I won't.

979
01:21:05,498 --> 01:21:08,668
Well, Asperger's is a funny animal.

980
01:21:11,963 --> 01:21:13,465
Can I go home now?

981
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,053
Donald.

982
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,140
I don't want you to see her,
I don't want you to call her.

983
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:26,436
And neither does she. 0kay?

984
01:21:36,738 --> 01:21:37,822
Look at it this way.

985
01:21:38,031 --> 01:21:40,033
She tried to kill herself because
he wouldn’t stop calling her.

986
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,868
No. She tried to kill herself
because I wanted to marry her.

987
01:21:42,077 --> 01:21:42,952
It’s completely different!

988
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:44,746
If I were you,
I would ask me for advice.

989
01:21:45,371 --> 01:21:47,040
Don't play her little game.

990
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:49,417
Write a story about how she was
eaten by Peruvian fire ants...

991
01:21:49,626 --> 01:21:51,961
and then run over by a car,
and then fax it to her.

992
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:55,173
She's expecting me to call.
If I don't, she's gonna go crazy...

993
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:58,134
and think that
I don't love her anymore!

994
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:03,807
I'm gonna find another phone.
I know the number.

995
01:22:04,015 --> 01:22:06,976
Is it as good as the number,
say, 2-8-0-9?

996
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:10,814
2809 is 53 squared
and 5 + 3 is 8.

997
01:22:11,022 --> 01:22:12,816
The cubed root of 8 is 2,
which is her dress size.

998
01:22:13,108 --> 01:22:15,402
I bought her this beautiful dress
the other day that has flowers on it.

999
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,903
6.

1000
01:22:17,153 --> 01:22:18,405
It’s not a richly textured number...

1001
01:22:18,613 --> 01:22:21,908
but it is her shoe size.
She has beautiful feet.

1002
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:24,035
You guys, I know her
better than anybody!

1003
01:22:24,244 --> 01:22:25,787
I know that she needs me to call.

1004
01:22:25,995 --> 01:22:29,082
What if the doctor is right,
and you call and she kills herself?

1005
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:34,921
And then you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1006
01:22:45,724 --> 01:22:47,892
How am I going to stop myself?

1007
01:22:53,022 --> 01:22:55,066
What do you wear
when you stop smoking?

1008
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,944
A nicotine patch.

1009
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:14,961
9-6-6-0.

1010
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,364
No, I can't!

1011
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,095
No!

1012
01:26:06,216 --> 01:26:08,676
Excuse me, do you know
when the next bus 217 runs?

1013
01:26:08,885 --> 01:26:11,262
-Sorry.
-I'm chasing someone.

1014
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,848
-By bus?
-Well, it’s important.

1015
01:26:14,057 --> 01:26:16,684
Important enough to take the bus.

1016
01:26:18,853 --> 01:26:20,355
My girlfriend left me because...

1017
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:23,525
I wanted to get married and
she wanted to stay just friends.

1018
01:26:24,067 --> 01:26:26,653
The slower this chase, the better.

1019
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:03,857
Stop the bus!

1020
01:27:40,185 --> 01:27:42,729
All this time, and you didn't call.

1021
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,898
I was going to call.

1022
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:46,649
You were?

1023
01:27:46,858 --> 01:27:49,444
Well, just to tell you that I wasn't
going to call so you wouldn’t...

1024
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:52,572
be aggravated, sitting around
and wondering when I was...

1025
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:54,449
Going to call?

1026
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:55,867
Yeah.

1027
01:27:57,619 --> 01:27:59,245
But in the end I figured that...

1028
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:03,875
forcing myself into your life
was probably not right.

1029
01:28:05,919 --> 01:28:07,670
I don't always do that.

1030
01:28:09,005 --> 01:28:13,051
So the only nice thing I had left
to give was just not to call.

1031
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:18,765
I hated you for not calling...

1032
01:28:18,973 --> 01:28:20,683
'cause you were always going to
be there and when you weren't...

1033
01:28:20,892 --> 01:28:22,602
it was as if...

1034
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:26,022
you didn't love me anymore.

1035
01:28:29,275 --> 01:28:31,486
So go home.
I'll call you.

1036
01:28:38,493 --> 01:28:41,121
I can't promise you the future,
Donald Duck.

1037
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:46,292
I don't know if this is
for 2 days or 20 years.

1038
01:28:53,675 --> 01:28:56,261
Finally, there's something
about us that’s normal.

1039
01:29:19,242 --> 01:29:21,327
I missed you so much.

1040
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:41,264
All right, look at what Donald made.

1041
01:29:41,473 --> 01:29:43,016
I'm hungry!

1042
01:29:43,308 --> 01:29:46,144
-Delicious.
-Thanksgiving.

1043
01:29:46,394 --> 01:29:49,773
-Stop it!
-Blume, don't, don't. Blume...

1044
01:29:52,233 --> 01:29:54,194
All right, so I wanted
to thank Donald...

1045
01:29:54,444 --> 01:29:57,447
who made this amazing lunch and...

1046
01:29:58,281 --> 01:30:01,701
I just wanted to thank you all
for coming, because...

1047
01:30:02,452 --> 01:30:04,829
you are our family.

1048
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,957
And I...
Well, we love you.

1049
01:30:10,877 --> 01:30:12,003
Hear, hear!

1050
01:30:12,212 --> 01:30:15,090
Wait, wait. This is to...

1051
01:30:15,548 --> 01:30:17,258
Donald Morton...

1052
01:30:17,592 --> 01:30:19,260
my husband.

1053
01:30:19,469 --> 01:30:20,804
Cheers!

1054
01:30:30,188 --> 01:30:31,689
I love you!

1055
01:30:57,799 --> 01:30:59,759
Anyone want gravy?
