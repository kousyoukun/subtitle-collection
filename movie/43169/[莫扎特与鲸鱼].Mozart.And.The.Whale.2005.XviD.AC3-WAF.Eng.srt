1
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:24,223
This is the best job I've ever had.

2
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,823
It would better be.
It's the last color.

3
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,835
You see, I got fired from
the Red Cab company and the...

4
00:01:32,037 --> 00:01:34,631
Checkered Boat Cab company,
and the Green Cab company.

5
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,441
But this was different.
I can feel it.

6
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:44,172
Even though I've been here for about
7 days, 9 hours and 37 minutes.

7
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,346
Don't worry about him.
He's unflappable.

8
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,822
Birds never play into the accidents,
anyway. It's usually the radio.

9
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,794
The radio is...

10
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:03,161
<i>...you got a problem?
-It's the radio.</i>

11
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,634
See? 87 last checked in
at 4th and Wall...

12
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:10,502
which puts in a good
13 minutes away...

13
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,575
while 223 and 41 are both
south the Interstate...

14
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:14,712
which makes them much,
much closer to Division and Trent.

15
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:17,549
And then there's Dave, who checked
in last 10 minutes ago and I'm sure...

16
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,809
that he stopped at the Starbucks
at Stevens and Trackwood...

17
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:21,543
which just makes him
right around the corner.

18
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:24,479
I see the deployment
of the entire fleet in my mind.

19
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,591
And the big trouble is I just,
I can't not see it.

20
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:48,510
-Did you see that?
-Is anyone hurt?

21
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:51,582
What the hell is this?
What’s the matter with you?

22
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,912
Are you crazy or something?
Look at this!

23
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,351
Look at all...!
Who's gonna pay for all this?

24
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,019
I am talking to you.
This is coming out of you, pal.

25
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,420
We're gonna get you home
before group.

26
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,359
Don't walk away.
Come back here! You...!

27
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:06,827
Shoot!

28
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:11,098
I'll track your name down, pal.

29
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,935
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, where are you going?

30
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,580
You can't leave us right here.

31
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,812
You can't leave us here.

32
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,040
Hey, taxi!

33
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,291
Hi, Donald.

34
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,192
-You're late.
-Sorry I'm late, you guys.

35
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:44,370
You said that the last time
and the last five times.

36
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:46,904
You're late to your own group.

37
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:51,302
Hey! No!

38
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:56,375
Green!

39
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,917
I got a raise at the university,
you know. 34 cents an hour.

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,587
Nobody cares.

41
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,222
0f course It's not technically
a monsoon, but...

42
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,858
14 inches of rain in 36 hours
is nothing to sneeze at...

43
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,050
even in Sri Lanka,
because...

44
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:09,695
They said my writing
was interesting per se...

45
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:13,526
but it doesn't meet their present needs
whatever that’s supposed to mean.

46
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,828
The Los Angeles Dodgers had
only 16 home games rained out...

47
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:17,095
in 41 years of baseball.

48
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:19,704
Nearly half of those rain games
occurred in the month of April...

49
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:21,568
and none have occurred
during the months of June...

50
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:23,432
or July.

51
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,340
I called by parents on the phone.

52
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,070
They're picking me up
at the bulletin board.

53
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:30,080
There's no bulletin board
at the park. You're screwed!

54
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:32,450
They'll never find you. Ever.

55
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,616
0kay, guys, we leave in 10 minutes
if we're going to make it to the park...

56
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:41,284
on time to meet the others.
It's the 17 bus transfer to the 301.

57
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,528
Who needs tokens?

58
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:44,756
Come and get them.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,797
They'll never find me. Ever.

60
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:50,165
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time. That’s just the way it is.

61
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,896
Gracie, can I see you
for a minute?

62
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,517
They'll never find me.
Ever.

63
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:09,425
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time. That’s just the way it is.

64
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,819
We'll buy you a cab.

65
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,722
I got a raise at the university,
you know. 34 cents an hour.

66
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,294
Yes?

67
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:21,163
Gracie, I'm gonna run the meeting
a little differently today.

68
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:24,201
I think that when
we get to the park...

69
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,168
I want you to gather
all the women...

70
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,608
and I'll gather all the guys
and go to the bleachers.

71
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:36,213
48 is interesting, because we add
the 4 and the 8 together you get 12.

72
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,116
If you flip 4 and 8 around, you get
84, and you subtract from 48...

73
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:43,656
you get 36, all of which
are exact multiplies of 12.

74
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,521
And 36 is interesting because
we add 3 and 6, we get 9...

75
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,164
and if you flip it around, you
get 63 and then, minus 36 is 27...

76
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:53,028
all of which are
exact multiplies of the 9.

77
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:56,670
-And now 144...
-Why will I gather all the women?

78
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,166
I want...

79
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,138
I want everybody to practice
telling personal stories.

80
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:05,576
And I think that people will be less
shy without the opposite sex...

81
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,751
...around. Do you think?
-I can tell them about my raise.

82
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,887
Bad idea.
Your raise is incredibly boring.

83
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:15,247
As a story, it lacks dramatic
tension and narrative drive.

84
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,585
You won't hear it.
You're not a girl.

85
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,490
I am, and I'm already bored!

86
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,695
Hey, somebody new signed up.
Isabelle Sorensen.

87
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:27,568
Gracie, maybe It would be nice
if you let her start.

88
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,568
That way,
everybody can get to know her.

89
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:56,055
-Hi.
-Hi.

90
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,027
I'm new.

91
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,042
I don't really know what to say.

92
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,250
0kay, help me out.
Ask me a question.

93
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:19,354
The candy bar Baby Ruth
was named after the daughter...

94
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:21,353
of President Glover Cleveland.

95
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:26,419
He once worked as a hangman
in Buffalo, New York.

96
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:32,300
No. Don't distract with a lot of weird
ball stuff 'cause I get completely lost.

97
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:35,904
He was one of the presidents
who had illegitimate children...

98
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:39,804
together with Thomas Jefferson
and Warren G. Harding.

99
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:50,219
I don't get that. How do 3 guys
have children together?

100
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:53,117
They didn't even live
in the same century.

101
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,158
I do that.

102
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:07,436
I take things sort of literally.

103
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:12,337
<i>In fact, I remember when
I was a kid and my parents...</i>

104
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:16,538
<i>were watching the Olympics on TV
and this athlete broke a record.</i>

105
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:19,012
<i>And everybody was really excited.</i>

106
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:22,984
<i>And I thought: “Well, if that's all that
took to impress them, I can do that".</i>

107
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:24,779
<i>So I did.</i>

108
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:27,352
<i>The neighborhood kids saw
what I was doing...</i>

109
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:30,221
<i>and they started making
the loud noises that they knew.</i>

110
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,656
<i>I hated.</i>

111
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:34,195
Monster! Monster! Monster!

112
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,234
<i>So I started barking
like a dog because...</i>

113
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:39,702
<i>I can do that!</i>

114
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,842
Animals are different.
You can't teach them cruelty.

115
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,845
I don't know.
What else do you want me to say?

116
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:58,513
It's always good, you guys, to start
a story somewhere near the beginning.

117
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,520
I grew up...

118
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:05,726
in a nice house.

119
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:11,798
By the time I was 2 years-old,
my parents basically got the drill.

120
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:15,866
I wasn't exactly what
they were looking for in a child.

121
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,435
I wasn't normal.

122
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:23,774
Quick. What’s 5,589
times 3,972 divided by 17?

123
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:31,150
1,305,853 point 411 etc.

124
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:32,718
See?
I told you.

125
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,928
You know, when McDonald’s
says 13 billion served...

126
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:39,565
It's not that much. 0nly 43 visits
per person, per year...

127
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:45,033
which is once every 8,49... days.

128
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,763
It turns out
you can't control people...

129
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:50,534
or even predict them.

130
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:54,574
But numbers are different. As I use
to say, you can count on them.

131
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:04,323
People with Asperger's want contact
with other people very much.

132
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:09,118
We're just pathetically
clueless at it, that’s all.

133
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:13,860
When I was 14, I was on my own.

134
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:16,730
<i>So I used to hitchhike
to get around.</i>

135
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:19,270
<i>One day, this guy pulled over
In a pick-up truck...</i>

136
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,304
<i>and he said
that I had a pretty smile.</i>

137
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,478
<i>So, I got in.</i>

138
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:28,738
<i>And he raped me before
we got to the next town.</i>

139
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:34,384
You see, I thought that,
if I had sex with men...

140
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,988
they would want me
to be around them.

141
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:38,247
Why would you want that?

142
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:42,119
Because I've had sex
with women, sugar.

143
00:10:42,597 --> 00:10:45,327
And It's so dumb.
There's no thing!

144
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,302
0h, that’s disgusting!

145
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,129
Does anybody else have a...

146
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,843
Donald!

147
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,274
-Donald!
-Excuse me, guys.

148
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,808
Hey, why are you laughing?

149
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,249
I just told you I was raped.

150
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:11,118
Keep laughing, ladies.

151
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,886
I don't care what my shrink says.
I'm out of here!

152
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,465
Excuse me. Is there some kind
of confusion here?

153
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,502
This is no damn confusion,
this is a fight.

154
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:25,502
Hi, I'm Donald Morton.
We haven't met.

155
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:27,868
Can you tell the difference
between confusion and a fight...

156
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:30,100
or are you just as dingy
as they are?

157
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:32,439
Some of us aren't as functional
as the others...

158
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:34,309
but that’s no reason
to call anyone “dingy?

159
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:37,349
Don't... Don't condescend
to this women.

160
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:39,180
They're no crazier than I am.

161
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:40,719
Yes, we are!

162
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:43,050
I'm weird,
but I'm not strange!

163
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,921
You're right. This is no matter of
confusion. It's a matter of discord.

164
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:49,230
That’s a nice sweater.

165
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:58,400
Look, this is my first time
in your little fish tank...

166
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:02,005
and I'm just giving these women
a lesson from my heart...

167
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:04,009
which they sorely need.

168
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:05,579
So that’s all about self-esteem.

169
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:08,114
You can kiss my self-esteem butt,
Donald Duck!

170
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:11,011
Why tell your life story...

171
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:13,518
...and tell only the good parts?
-It's Donald Morton.

172
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:14,781
You're missing my point!

173
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,050
No, I'm not.
I just never know what to say.

174
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:36,340
Neither do I.

175
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,710
We're quite the pair, huh?

176
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,631
What’s the point?

177
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,202
Not being alone.

178
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:03,332
Considering who we are,
what the hell is so great about that?

179
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,811
Her name's Isabelle Sorensen.

180
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:46,983
She's 8 letters
on each of her names.

181
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:50,745
I have 6 on each of mine.
So it must be good luck.

182
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,117
I don't know why I got so angry.

183
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:58,225
I guess I just do that.

184
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,231
He yelled right back at me, which
was pretty cool. Don't you think?

185
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:09,064
322. That’s another good sign.

186
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,369
That’s the number of days
she's older than me, times 3.

187
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:20,913
Which makes her 966 days
older than me.

188
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:25,351
He said that
he never knows what to say.

189
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:28,221
You ever knew a guy
who actually admit that?

190
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:32,419
It means we were both born
on Thursday.

191
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:34,460
0nly not the same Thursday.

192
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:40,666
Then again, he is autistic.
Did I tell you that he's tall?

193
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,839
Hey, Bongo.

194
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,304
It's nice to obsess on something
beautiful, for a change.

195
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:11,265
<i>Hello. Hello?</i>

196
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,039
First I'd better get a machine,
don't you think?

197
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,645
I was the first one to join
after Donald formed the group.

198
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:28,114
He has Asperger's, you know.

199
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,449
Somebody told me that he's good
with numbers. Is that true?

200
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:34,251
Yes, he's very good.
But his numbers are...

201
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,759
-Really? What do you do?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm a writer.

202
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,658
-You write?
-Yeah.

203
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,561
But you shouldn’t read my writing
because it repels women.

204
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:45,566
...unless you count 19... 24...

205
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:48,604
with no record keeping a suspect.

206
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:06,150
0n the humidity front,
the only item on the note was in...

207
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,883
Hyderabad,
in the South of India.

208
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:10,324
Have you ever had real sex,
Gregory?

209
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,132
Excuse me.

210
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,366
Considering the season,
It's something...

211
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:25,204
of attention, really.

212
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:34,114
What was weather like at the
second McKinley inaugural?

213
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:37,382
-That would’ve been...
-March 4th, 1901 A.D.

214
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:41,756
Big snow. High temperature's
17 degrees. 3.4 inches...

215
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,295
low temperature's minus 5 degrees.

216
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:50,195
What did you say to her?

217
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:54,234
I said I was a writer,
but she shouldn’t read my oeuvre...

218
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:55,739
as it repels women.

219
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:57,807
And then, what did she say?

220
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:00,646
Try me.

221
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,182
It figures.

222
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:07,080
She's coming
to the Halloween party with me.

223
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,122
That’s great.
Tell me about it.

224
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:18,026
I'm gonna go as Batman.

225
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:21,631
A whimsical commentary
on today's decaying popular culture.

226
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:24,862
-0h, yeah? What’s she going as?
-Who cares?

227
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:27,631
-I do.
-Ask her.

228
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:31,136
-Ask her what she's going...
-Ask her if she'll come with me.

229
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:35,749
-I was seized by terror.
-I don't know if I can do that.

230
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,145
You both have Asperger's,
you both share the language...

231
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:40,320
of emotional dysfunction,
whereas I, on the other hand...

232
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:43,389
just irritate the shit out of everyone!
Even you.

233
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,823
She likes you though.
She laughed.

234
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:49,862
Everybody laughs at me. It doesn't
commit them to a Halloween party.

235
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:55,800
Please.

236
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:00,768
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other day.

237
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:04,640
That looks nice.

238
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:09,774
My cookie!
Can't eat my cookie!

239
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:11,782
-You can't do that!
-It's my cookie!

240
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,784
That’s not okay!

241
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,290
It's mine!

242
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:17,981
Stop! Stop!

243
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,888
It's okay.
It's okay.

244
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,619
It's okay.

245
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,463
All right, I'm sorry.
But you can't do that.

246
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:28,363
I'm gonna call my parents now.

247
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:31,062
They'll pick me up
for the bulletin board.

248
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:32,934
Save it for later. Yeah.

249
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:37,841
I'll call my parents on the phone...

250
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,571
to pick me up at the bulletin board.

251
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:42,873
Hi, Donald.

252
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,780
You remember me?

253
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:50,589
Yes.

254
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
Good.

255
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,532
You know what Gregory
told me about you?

256
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:01,533
I'm good with numbers.

257
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,170
You spoiled my surprise.

258
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,102
-I take things literally.
-Me too.

259
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:19,381
0ne time, when I was 7 years old,
my dad took me to a diner...

260
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:22,558
for breakfast
and he said “Hominy grits?..

261
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,090
and I thought that
he said “how many?..

262
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,920
and I was supposed to count
how many there were.

263
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,620
-How many were there?
-437.

264
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,763
That was a joke. It's not that
I remember anything stupid...

265
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,804
as how many hominy grits.

266
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:43,741
I have to go now.
I gotta feed my animals.

267
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:46,378
I have six birds myself.

268
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:01,794
Isabelle, there's something I need to
talk to you about that’s important.

269
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:07,296
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?

270
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,170
Yes.

271
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:12,472
Good.

272
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,878
Bye.

273
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:20,079
-Bye!
-Bye.

274
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,615
Hi, Isabelle.

275
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,862
Hi, Isabelle. Hi.

276
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:42,731
Hi, Isabelle.
Isabelle, hello.

277
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,985
Izzy, I don't think he likes that.

278
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,730
Isn't that funny?

279
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,144
He's smiling.
He's smiling.

280
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,117
And see this?
This is a friendly gesture.

281
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:31,446
Show me yours, come on.

282
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,291
You know, a mandrill spends
two hours a day eating breakfast.

283
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:45,936
So, when you think about it,
that’s...

284
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:50,073
2,628,000 seconds
a year eating breakfast...

285
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,098
which only leaves him...

286
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:58,079
28 million... 908 thousand seconds
a year not to eat breakfast.

287
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:06,618
You know, I don't have to do numbers
all the time. I can control myself.

288
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,754
Don't stop.

289
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,857
Don't ever stop.
I love it.

290
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,188
That’s good, because I can't.

291
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,831
I know that. Neither can I.

292
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,694
We're autistic.

293
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,831
Like I can't stand the sound
of clanging metal.

294
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,532
If I hear it,
I completely freak out.

295
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,175
I learned a long time ago that I...
I can't...

296
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:32,317
keep from shocking people,
so I just make it work for me.

297
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,218
Sometimes.

298
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,786
I always say what I think.

299
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,452
Not because It's good.
It's just that I can't censor it.

300
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:47,191
The women at the park the other day,
I think I really freaked them out.

301
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:50,667
I hope that
they'll forgive me sometime.

302
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,066
Isabelle,
what you said about rape...

303
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:57,603
Rape is a very bad thing,
It's never funny.

304
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,277
Not ever.

305
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,838
That’s your guts
speaking out just now.

306
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,065
Not really.

307
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,671
No, it did.

308
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,377
It did. It did.

309
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:36,816
Because you are attracted to me.

310
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:40,319
And you want to make
a good impression.

311
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:44,890
And guts makes
a really good impression.

312
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,195
This is how the birds are
in my apartment.

313
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,064
Mine too.

314
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,867
They're trying to evict me. Some
kind of phobia about animal poop.

315
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:03,604
That’s too bad.

316
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,539
I think that tonight we should
sneak back in here...

317
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,242
and set all the animals free,
except for the polar bears.

318
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:15,685
It's too warm.
That was a joke.

319
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,423
So, It's time!

320
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,260
You have something to tell me,
remember?

321
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,403
My friend Gregory wants to take you
to the Halloween party.

322
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:36,738
Is that it?

323
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,507
I don't go to the
Halloween party ever, so...

324
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:47,044
My friends dress up
on Halloween...

325
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:50,190
to hide who they really are.
And...

326
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,287
That’s sad, but credible.

327
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,289
I've a costume too.

328
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:58,096
At home.

329
00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:03,129
But it reveals who I really am,
and nobody knows.

330
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:11,804
You take me to the party.
Wear your costume.

331
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:15,743
I would be so honored.

332
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:20,820
In fact, let’s not go to the party.
Just meet me at the mall.

333
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:23,956
Everyone is in costume,
they won't even notice us.

334
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:29,064
That’s what I love
about Halloween.

335
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,270
Hi, Isabelle. Hi.

336
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:39,666
Hoy, Hoy. Hello.

337
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:43,468
Hello, Isabelle.

338
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:48,142
Hello, Isabelle.
Isabelle.

339
00:25:58,294 --> 00:26:00,592
I'm 9 hours and 37 minutes early.

340
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:03,664
Which is a good sign,
because that’s 577 minutes.

341
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:07,197
Prime number.

342
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:12,838
So, what’s up, Isabelle?

343
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,562
I'm late.

344
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:41,032
Which is ironic, because I started
out 9 hours and 23 minutes early.

345
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,006
You know what?
At this point...

346
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:17,798
probably better not to go at all,
you think?

347
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:25,581
I mean, she probably left already.

348
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:29,551
And if she didn't, she'll just be
really irritated when I show up.

349
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:33,253
And I wouldn’t know what to say.

350
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,926
You know how I get when
I don't know what to say.

351
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:39,620
Probably better not to go at all.

352
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:46,837
That’s our doorbell.

353
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:49,604
I'll be right back.

354
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:56,942
Nice whale costume.

355
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:03,543
-Dr. Mozart, I presume.
-Mozart wasn't a doctor.

356
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,234
Symphony 40, G Minor.

357
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,665
It's about anger, passion,
and transcendence.

358
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:22,199
-Like you.
-Thanks.

359
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:25,839
I'm sorry I'm 63 minutes late.
I really was gonna come, I just...

360
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:29,446
That’s okay, I just figured
you screwed up. Come on.

361
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:36,484
So, I was going to take
the 303 bus instead of the 809.

362
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:41,389
And then I was thinking about
how 303 square is 91,809...

363
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,461
and the last 3 digits
are the same as 809, so...

364
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,131
I just forgot which one I was
gonna take. Then I thought...

365
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:51,269
Like I said!
I figured you screwed up.

366
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,666
Come on, we're going this way.

367
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:00,471
-So this is who you really are?
-Yeah.

368
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:02,475
This is so hot!

369
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,547
Are you in there?

370
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,911
Mr. Jonah!

371
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:12,858
What are you laughing at, toots?
At least my boyfriend is a vegetarian!

372
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:15,688
You have a boyfriend?

373
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,166
No, It's a joke.

374
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:25,030
You are the vegetarian
because you're a whale.

375
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:27,871
Whales aren't vegetarians.
They eat krill.

376
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:30,508
-So why is that?
-Because they're tiny shrimp.

377
00:29:30,877 --> 00:29:32,845
That you're a whale?

378
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,180
For lots of reasons.

379
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,316
Name six.

380
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,750
-For one, they're very big.
-Really?

381
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:43,616
-Yeah.
-And...?

382
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:49,218
All my life I kind of felt
I was on the sidewise...

383
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:51,227
like watching the parade go by.

384
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,098
When you are a whale,
you are the parade.

385
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,135
I bet you know all about whales.

386
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,365
-Yes.
-Well, tell me.

387
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:04,434
Well, It's a very long story.

388
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:08,843
Well, the last bus isn't
for another two hours...

389
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,915
47 minutes and three...

390
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:13,348
No, two, one.
0ne second.

391
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:15,715
Quick, Donald, tell me!

392
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,132
Well, the bus is coming.

393
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:35,170
Yep.

394
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,582
So, Donald, this is our first kiss.

395
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,142
No tongue.

396
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:54,422
Why don't you take this thing off?
You don't need it anymore.

397
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:58,425
I'm not quite so sure
what I'm wearing underneath.

398
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,395
Well, what the hell?

399
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:04,932
Let’s lift it up.

400
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:09,637
0kay, Mr. Whale, you can go.
Just there.

401
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:14,281
That’s nice.

402
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,677
That was a mix up
at the laundromat.

403
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,252
0n second thought, maybe
we should have some tongue.

404
00:31:33,802 --> 00:31:34,860
Call me!

405
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:43,535
When?

406
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,044
When should I call you?

407
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:42,063
Hey, move.

408
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:43,896
0kay, move.

409
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:46,872
Sit down.

410
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:50,442
All right, just don't bite me.

411
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,742
Honey, scoot.

412
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:01,423
<i>Long messages are cheerfully
ignored. Get it over with.</i>

413
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:06,954
<i>This is Donald Morton.
This is my eighth message.</i>

414
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:08,994
At least.

415
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,190
<i>Hey, I'm sorry I called
so many times, but...</i>

416
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:13,198
<i>you didn’t say when to call, so I...</i>

417
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,394
<i>Well, listen,
I won't bother you anymore.</i>

418
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:16,766
That’s what you said the last time.

419
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:19,499
<i>I just wanted to say again
I had a whale a time last night...</i>

420
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:22,110
<i>and I...</i>

421
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:25,844
<i>I understand.
I really do.</i>

422
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:30,012
<i>And I'm always gonna
remember you...</i>

423
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:32,179
<i>and the times we had...</i>

424
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:33,378
<i>and...</i>

425
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,024
Donald Duck!

426
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:38,892
<i>You're home.</i>

427
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:46,061
I didn't call because I didn't
really know what to say to you.

428
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:50,734
Donald, I don't know where
you and I could ever go.

429
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:53,542
<i>We can go to the amusement park.</i>

430
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:02,182
Donald, you can see everything
from up here!

431
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,878
Look at the sky.
It's the same color as my jacket!

432
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:09,253
-I'm sure It's amazing.
-It is. Especially to the East...

433
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:11,451
where the sun's setting.

434
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:16,259
-Actually, the sun sets on the West.
-Will stop making conversation?

435
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:20,801
This is somewhat disappointing.
Just open your eyes, It's great!

436
00:34:29,582 --> 00:34:33,347
It's kind of like in the arcade.
When I want to factor a number...

437
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,612
I just...
I visualize it...

438
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:39,180
going across my eyes.

439
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,382
Pick a number.

440
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:43,255
589.

441
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:45,692
0kay. So then I shoot
prime numbers at it, so...

442
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,730
3 won't go into it and
5 won't go in it.

443
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:52,027
It won't even have a chance
because it doesn't end in a 5 or a 0.

444
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,702
And then...
You know, 7, 11.

445
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:59,809
19. When I shoot 19,
it breaks into two...

446
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:01,842
19 and 31.

447
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,750
Your process if very sexual.

448
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:10,854
Primes are hot.

449
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:13,118
I like you.

450
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:16,589
You're so smart!
So cool!

451
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:19,762
You wanna know the secret
to this one? It's good.

452
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:24,359
You see, you just...

453
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:28,436
you throw them all
at the same time, just...

454
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,541
No, don't...

455
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:46,589
Stop it!

456
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,021
Stop it!

457
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:17,045
Excuse me.

458
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,525
Hey, It's okay.

459
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,352
It's okay.

460
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:25,396
We won a panda.
We got 4 rings on them.

461
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,430
Can we go home now?

462
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:32,771
Don't freak out!

463
00:36:33,006 --> 00:36:34,565
It's okay, I'm better now.

464
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:36,470
I was talking to them.

465
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:41,313
Hello!
Come on, sweet baby.

466
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,910
Don't worry,
I'm just talking to him.

467
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,713
-That’s Cockatoo Dundee.
-Hey, Dundee.

468
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:52,217
That’s Ricky, and that’s Lucy.

469
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:55,460
That’s Piyachi, Chicken Boo.

470
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:57,997
And this is Don Juan de Marco.

471
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,396
Let's have a look
around the house, guys.

472
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:10,941
I save things because
you never know. You know?

473
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:14,248
You said your mom died.
You did bury her?

474
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,343
-Yeah.
-Just checking.

475
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:20,282
Let’s sit down, huh?

476
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,917
0kay, guys.

477
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,458
Come on.

478
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,094
That’s it.

479
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,254
Come on.

480
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,827
All right.
You can sit here.

481
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:35,832
You want to sit here?

482
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:39,939
Come on. There you go.
You can get off too now.

483
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:43,134
See, you can go here.
There you are.

484
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,314
You want something to eat?

485
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:50,148
You got any old food in the fridge?

486
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,844
I got lots of old food.
You like old food?

487
00:37:55,223 --> 00:37:56,520
Donald.

488
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,186
This is about sex.

489
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,662
I'm sorry.
Was that a little abrupt?

490
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:12,071
It's just that I haven't had any...

491
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:16,812
in a long, long time.

492
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:21,377
Yeah.

493
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:25,044
I had an instinct there.

494
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:31,923
But sex is gonna be terrific.

495
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:39,130
It's the most fun you can have
with your clothes off.

496
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:43,670
I'm sure you've been
with more attractive men.

497
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:47,071
Are you kidding me?
You are so hot.

498
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:52,804
Anyway, attraction
is a whole package.

499
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,917
And I've never been
with anyone like you.

500
00:38:59,189 --> 00:39:01,122
You mean the hygiene?

501
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,660
You know how many guys
would take me home...

502
00:39:05,862 --> 00:39:07,557
after that show at the ring toss?

503
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:10,462
Plenty.

504
00:39:13,203 --> 00:39:15,898
Well, they wouldn’t be there
in the morning.

505
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,298
I'll be there in the morning.
I live here.

506
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:24,740
Is there a pathway
to your bedroom?

507
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,447
You want to go?

508
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:36,389
Now?

509
00:39:38,662 --> 00:39:39,856
Yeah.

510
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:51,236
You know how
in the jungle they say that...

511
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:54,968
some elephants have longer trunks
and some of them have shorter ones?

512
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,386
Well, I don't care how long
the elephant 's trunk is...

513
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:09,989
as long as his thing's okay.

514
00:40:16,334 --> 00:40:18,858
Sweetie, you can't disappoint me.

515
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:24,332
'Cause whatever you are...

516
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:27,442
is exactly what I want.

517
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:36,842
Isabelle!

518
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:46,547
You know, at first, I was upset
that she didn't even leave a note!

519
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:52,129
Then I realized that was a kindness.

520
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:54,762
She's a sweet person.

521
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,694
Why hurt my feelings, you know?

522
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,570
The less said, the better,
you think?

523
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:06,741
So we just tuck it away, you know.
Just leave it.

524
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:11,012
She said a lot of beautiful things.

525
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:15,616
The fact that she didn't mean it
only makes it nicer.

526
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:20,116
I mean, what was she gonna say?
“Thanks for the lousy sex??

527
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,593
Are you talking about me?

528
00:42:23,196 --> 00:42:25,595
I just had to go home
and feed my animals.

529
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:32,528
You know what I think
we should do today?

530
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:35,064
Buy you a nice suit.

531
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:36,602
Sure.

532
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,504
This is my best friend, Bongo.
“Hello!?

533
00:42:40,713 --> 00:42:43,204
-I'm just doing the dishes.
-Cool.

534
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:47,046
Yeah...

535
00:42:47,821 --> 00:42:49,152
cool.

536
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:53,787
Here they are.

537
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,086
Yeah. He's coming.
He is coming.

538
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:03,863
Where have you been?

539
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,437
I thought our friends deserved to
know the truth of your treachery.

540
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:10,901
-I believe in the truth.
-You believe in gossip.

541
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:14,643
Are you sleeping with him?

542
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:17,475
Janice, that’s a personal question.

543
00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:21,553
Sure, is that okay with you?

544
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:25,481
Don't you hate all his numbers?
Does he change his socks?

545
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,224
Is his penis big enough?

546
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:30,589
No, no, and yes.

547
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:36,564
Would you take me to the movies
on Sunday at 5?

548
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,035
Janice, Sundays
I'm with Isabelle. Sorry.

549
00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:45,538
This is a classic vicious betrayal,
very common in literature!

550
00:43:46,947 --> 00:43:48,539
And life.

551
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:56,847
Hey.
Nice to see you again, Gregory.

552
00:43:57,726 --> 00:44:00,194
It's very nice to smell you.

553
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:05,128
As you all know...

554
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:09,532
Isabelle and I have been seeing
each other since Halloween.

555
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,164
And maybe we should talk
about how you feel about this.

556
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,271
It's sexual harassment!

557
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,201
That’s a very serious accusation!

558
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:21,177
You used your position to extort
sexual favors, you should be replaced.

559
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,339
My sister's a lawyer.

560
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:26,783
Gregory, Donald and I are just
getting to know each other.

561
00:44:26,988 --> 00:44:30,253
-So, you can still date me?
-Right now, I just wanna see Donald.

562
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:33,086
So, when you're sick of him,
you can date me?

563
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,460
Skeets, let’s hear from you.

564
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,126
Do you have any questions
about me and Isabelle?

565
00:44:40,335 --> 00:44:44,204
There are 200 to 300 million sperm
cells in the average ejaculation.

566
00:44:49,378 --> 00:44:51,777
Penguins mate only once a year...

567
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,244
and it lasts 3 minutes.

568
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:59,281
I think they're extremely sexy.
You wanna know why?

569
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:02,452
I'm only gonna tell you
if you wanna know.

570
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:05,455
-I wanna know.
-I don't, and that’s for sure.

571
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,253
Skeets?

572
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,329
When penguins are reunited after
a long separation...

573
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:14,970
they stand breast to breast
their heads are thrown back...

574
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,368
and their little flippers are trembling
and they sing, Skeets...

575
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:21,133
because they're so happy
to find each other.

576
00:45:23,913 --> 00:45:25,437
Gracie, how do you feel?

577
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:29,749
I feel sad.

578
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,814
About me and Isabelle?

579
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:37,086
Bronwin's daddy has blood cancer.

580
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,858
Regular people get sick too,
not just autistic people...

581
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:46,000
that’s just the way it is.

582
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:56,868
Yeah, but these days lots of people
get better from chemotherapy and...

583
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:00,607
I have to go now. My parents are
meeting me at the bulletin...

584
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:09,550
The meeting just started.
Maybe your parents will be there...

585
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:12,422
...in a little while.
-Would you like me to go with you?

586
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:16,031
We could call your parents
and we could wait together...

587
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,824
by the bulletin board.

588
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:25,969
I'd like to do that.

589
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,581
I'll go too.

590
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:40,986
Not today.

591
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:50,360
-Can I go to the funeral?
-I'm not going, and that’s for sure.

592
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:52,262
Donald!

593
00:47:28,272 --> 00:47:32,299
All right.
Just for one day, nobody shit.

594
00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:17,517
Yuck!

595
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:19,887
That is so gross!

596
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:22,787
Izzy, I'm home!

597
00:49:21,754 --> 00:49:22,914
0h, no.

598
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:35,257
What did you do?

599
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:38,362
Where's my stuff?

600
00:49:38,572 --> 00:49:39,970
Did you hear, Izzy?

601
00:49:40,173 --> 00:49:42,437
Everything's here.
It's just organized.

602
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:48,044
I thought you'd like it.

603
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:52,882
Well, now I know where everything
is, so you'd better be nice to me...

604
00:49:53,086 --> 00:49:55,419
or I'll take the secret
to my grave.

605
00:49:55,622 --> 00:49:58,057
Where's my shower curtain, huh?

606
00:49:58,292 --> 00:49:59,589
I threw it out.

607
00:50:01,595 --> 00:50:03,153
What? God!

608
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,297
Well, I called the Center
for Disease Control in Atlanta...

609
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,296
but it was more
than they could handle.

610
00:50:08,502 --> 00:50:11,369
It was mine!
This is all my stuff!

611
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:13,733
You had no right to do this!

612
00:50:13,974 --> 00:50:16,135
I thought you'd like it.

613
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:20,509
You stole my life.

614
00:50:39,234 --> 00:50:43,603
285410.
Got the 2,85.

615
00:51:09,931 --> 00:51:12,593
-Trying to get yourself killed?
-Maybe later.

616
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:17,704
H-Lime.
What’s that supposed to mean?

617
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:22,672
Harry Lime. 0rson Welles.
“The Third Man?

618
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,136
It's a movie.

619
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:28,381
Your plate’s better.

620
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:31,384
You can trade the letters for
Roman numerals, that’s 215.

621
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:34,111
If you add the one, that’s 216.
That’s 6 cubed.

622
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:36,718
27 is 3 cubed.

623
00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:42,259
I'm doing all the numbers
in the parking lot.

624
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:44,758
It helps calming me down.

625
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:48,369
-Did you lose your job?
-No, my woman.

626
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,801
And my shower curtain.

627
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:56,510
What’s your social security number?

628
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:05,785
Stop calling!

629
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,991
<i>Hi. This is my 14th message.</i>

630
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,192
<i>Listen, I respectfully think
you should change your greeting...</i>

631
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,524
<i>in case you get called
by your boss.</i>

632
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:19,264
<i>Seriously, I'm fine now.</i>

633
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:26,040
<i>And I'm sorry I spoiled our evening.
I am really, really sorry.</i>

634
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:28,770
<i>It could never ever happen again.</i>

635
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,670
<i>I mean, to hell
with the shower curtain.</i>

636
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,038
Hey.

637
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:38,813
Sorry.

638
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:52,886
Everyone...

639
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,322
this is my boyfriend.

640
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,368
Donald Morton.

641
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:05,102
0h, the shower curtain.

642
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,072
Mac Farraday.

643
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,107
Brenda Mackey.

644
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,779
Wanda...

645
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,472
my mentor.

646
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,344
I bought him this suit.

647
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:17,646
It was on sale. Hey.

648
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:13,746
0ne of the reasons
that I cleaned your apartment...

649
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:15,743
0h, boy, It's great.

650
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:18,577
The cleaner the better,
that’s what I say.

651
00:55:18,817 --> 00:55:22,082
It's so that we can have
our friends over, Donald!

652
00:55:22,454 --> 00:55:25,116
Izzy, we don't have friends
who come over. Ever.

653
00:55:25,357 --> 00:55:27,588
Yeah. Want to guess why?

654
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:31,461
Not really.

655
00:55:34,868 --> 00:55:36,301
Donald?

656
00:55:36,502 --> 00:55:37,560
Izzy.

657
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:40,364
This is the most peaceful...

658
00:55:41,274 --> 00:55:44,004
the most beautiful place
that I know.

659
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,378
And the world doesn't want it
anymore, so they left it to me.

660
00:55:48,648 --> 00:55:49,979
To us.

661
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:54,586
This is a special place
that’s just for us.

662
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:58,024
You know what we need?

663
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:01,657
We need a little house
with a yard...

664
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:05,059
so that we can plant flowers
and sit in the shade...

665
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:07,666
and kiss under the stars.

666
00:56:09,102 --> 00:56:13,233
The heavens are very
important to me. So...

667
00:56:14,073 --> 00:56:16,634
I found this tiny place...

668
00:56:16,844 --> 00:56:20,075
and the rent isn't gonna cost any
more than what we're already paying...

669
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,249
with our two apartments.

670
00:56:22,448 --> 00:56:24,178
Izzy, I got fired, remember?

671
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:30,688
Dr. Jeffries is the woman at the
university who diagnosed me. And...

672
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:33,826
I was telling her about how
you organized this group...

673
00:56:34,027 --> 00:56:36,792
of lonely people
that everybody else ignores.

674
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:40,732
I only did that because
I was lonely too.

675
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:47,338
I was telling her how much
you care for them...

676
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,702
and how much
they love you...

677
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,205
because this is the real work
of your life, Donald...

678
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:54,380
only nobody pays you.

679
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,481
So I asked her
if she could find you a job...

680
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,947
at the university that would enable
you to continue...

681
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:00,586
...this invaluable...
-You did what?

682
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,256
And she said yes, yes, yes!

683
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:08,519
Izzy, they don't have cabs
at the University Medical Center.

684
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,424
Donald Duck,
it comes down to this:

685
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:18,328
do you want to make me happy?

686
00:57:26,648 --> 00:57:29,845
For one thing, I understand
you're a mathematical genius.

687
00:57:30,317 --> 00:57:31,615
Who said that?

688
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,186
Dr. Jeffries recommended
that I called...

689
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:36,482
Isabelle Sorensen.

690
00:57:38,126 --> 00:57:40,321
I hope that was all right.

691
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:43,191
It's her fault
that I'm here in the first pace.

692
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:51,128
And after everything she told me and
checking on your excellent record...

693
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:56,743
in college I'm wondering why you
choose to drive a taxi for a living.

694
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:02,942
At my interview with IBM
after I graduated college...

695
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:06,586
they asked me what
my plans were and I said:

696
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,983
“Probably go to McDonald’s
for a12-piece McNugget...

697
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:11,887
and 2 cheeseburgers
and then do my laundry?

698
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,460
Did they laugh at least?

699
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,354
They smiled and
they said they'd call me.

700
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:20,399
They didn't.

701
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:28,240
Mr. Morton, I run Administrative
Services for the Medical Center.

702
00:58:28,444 --> 00:58:32,778
Your profile is a plus because
we want to give opportunities to...

703
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:33,971
people with special needs.

704
00:58:34,183 --> 00:58:36,549
You can say “autistic?
I already know.

705
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:38,884
“Touché”.

706
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:43,557
The job would be looking at statistical
runs finding inconsistencies.

707
00:58:43,926 --> 00:58:46,793
Telling me where the computer got it
wrong. You can do that, can't you?

708
00:58:46,996 --> 00:58:47,985
Well, sure.

709
00:58:48,197 --> 00:58:51,792
Well, I can't, and neither can
anybody else I've ever met. So...

710
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,734
I'm blessed to have you.

711
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,491
Where do you want me to put him?

712
01:00:14,586 --> 01:00:16,053
-Donald!
-What?

713
01:00:16,253 --> 01:00:18,187
Prepare to die!

714
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:21,958
0kay. Ready?

715
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,457
-No.
-Yes, you are.

716
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,753
-No.
-It's gonna be fine

717
01:00:25,964 --> 01:00:28,899
0kay. Scissors.
First, water. Ready?

718
01:00:29,133 --> 01:00:31,397
0ne, two, three.

719
01:00:31,603 --> 01:00:33,537
-Water.
-No, no, no.

720
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:35,899
-Donald, chill!
-No.

721
01:00:36,274 --> 01:00:39,141
Come on, It's gonna be fine.
Come here.

722
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:40,902
-Hello!
-Hi.

723
01:00:41,113 --> 01:00:42,944
Nice day, huh?

724
01:00:46,951 --> 01:00:48,510
I think they're the neighbors.

725
01:00:51,556 --> 01:00:54,548
It's too expensive, Dundee.
It's too expensive.

726
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,292
All right.

727
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,127
Have a good day.

728
01:01:06,972 --> 01:01:08,098
Bye.

729
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:16,810
Isabelle, there's something
I need to talk to you about that...

730
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:18,677
sometimes you find...

731
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,317
kind of enraging.

732
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,781
-0h, yeah?
-Yeah.

733
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:23,180
Try me.

734
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:31,926
Tonight, when my boss
comes here for dinner...

735
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:34,258
I just want everything to be...

736
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:37,230
really nice.

737
01:01:38,637 --> 01:01:39,763
You know?

738
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:44,032
He's a really good person,
and I really like my job.

739
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:47,270
-I just want everything...
-To be nice.

740
01:01:48,113 --> 01:01:50,138
-Yeah.
-0kay.

741
01:01:54,487 --> 01:01:56,647
Have a nice day at work.

742
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,019
You too.

743
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,329
Bye!

744
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:18,667
Izzy, we're home!

745
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,409
Can you shut the door?

746
01:02:26,886 --> 01:02:30,788
I told her to put everybody in his
or her cages respectively, but...

747
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:32,083
she didn't, and...

748
01:02:32,459 --> 01:02:35,623
Come on, you guys. Come on.
Come on, you guys.

749
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:38,320
Stay, stay. Come on.

750
01:02:44,037 --> 01:02:45,505
There she is.

751
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,101
Izzy!

752
01:02:49,676 --> 01:02:51,907
All the birds were out.

753
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,741
Hank Wallace, Isabelle.
Nice to put a face with the voice.

754
01:02:56,950 --> 01:03:00,977
That’s right. We talked about
what a genius Mr. Morton is.

755
01:03:01,221 --> 01:03:03,087
Not to mention a saint.

756
01:03:04,925 --> 01:03:05,949
Well, only this morning...

757
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:09,021
he advised me to be on my very
tippy-toed best behavior tonight...

758
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:11,163
so I don't weird you out.

759
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:14,129
So feel free to advise me
if I deviate from normality...

760
01:03:14,335 --> 01:03:16,166
at anytime.

761
01:03:16,637 --> 01:03:19,003
Sense of humor.
We're working on it.

762
01:03:19,206 --> 01:03:21,868
-Do you like vegetable lasagna?
-Sure.

763
01:03:22,176 --> 01:03:25,111
How about a beer?
See you inside!

764
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,478
It's great vegetable lasagna.

765
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:35,321
I don't pretend to be
an expert, but...

766
01:03:35,556 --> 01:03:38,458
That’s great! 'Cause I hate it
when people do that.

767
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:41,250
But your paintings are impressive.

768
01:03:41,462 --> 01:03:42,759
0h, yeah.

769
01:03:42,963 --> 01:03:44,192
Thank you.

770
01:03:44,398 --> 01:03:46,298
Most people want me to paint
something else, you know...

771
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,231
with fewer eyes,
Less violent, less insane.

772
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:53,739
I used to tell Donald that
I wanted him to hear my paintings...

773
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:55,933
and see my music
'cause I wanted him...

774
01:03:56,143 --> 01:03:57,771
to understand them
like other people couldn’t.

775
01:03:58,013 --> 01:04:01,608
She doesn't understand that I can.
And I do.

776
01:04:02,149 --> 01:04:04,174
And most people do.
It's pretty normal.

777
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:13,793
I'm basically a failure, Hank.

778
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:16,827
In the material world
I used to be a piano tuner.

779
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:19,227
-She's perfect pitch.
-I made good money.

780
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:23,131
It's a valued trade, but half the clients
hit on me, and the other half...

781
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:27,331
would say something stupid enough
to where I'd blurt out something rude.

782
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:32,241
I say things as I think them,
you know?

783
01:04:32,448 --> 01:04:33,880
0ut loud, most of the times.

784
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:38,951
Can't hold my temper and, arrogant,
impatient, and I don't suffer fools.

785
01:04:40,889 --> 01:04:43,255
I have a good heart,
believe it or not...

786
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:45,359
but it doesn't pay so good, so...

787
01:04:45,561 --> 01:04:49,428
I'm lucky that I have a wonderful
guy who's also very generous.

788
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:53,090
Did he tell you about
our plans for the house?

789
01:04:55,505 --> 01:04:58,702
Well, they're not exactly plans
that we plan to implement...

790
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:00,603
Just maybe ideas, more...

791
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:04,075
We're going to put this big sandbox
right here in the living room...

792
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,545
so people and animals can play...
Whatever!

793
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:12,050
And then, outside we're going
to put this big aviary...

794
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:14,223
so birds and lizards and Bongo
can hang out.

795
01:05:14,423 --> 01:05:16,391
-Have you met Bongo?
-No, not officially.

796
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:19,460
Have you noticed that winters are
coming later and later every year?

797
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:21,954
-I like that.
-Have you?

798
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:24,326
And it was actually
Donald’s idea that we put...

799
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:27,799
a piano in the yard so that all the
local animals can listen to me play.

800
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:29,938
It must be global warming.

801
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:35,206
Interrupting is not the way
to become the focus of attention...

802
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:37,209
It's very autistic.

803
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,441
Where was I?
The walls.

804
01:05:41,652 --> 01:05:44,212
So I'm gonna paint them in this
one-of-a-kind savage colors...

805
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:47,322
and get fabrics to put
all over the carpet and stuff...

806
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:49,890
that scream jungle, you know?
And then...

807
01:05:50,092 --> 01:05:54,154
right up there, by the doorway,
I wanna put this whale-shaped thing...

808
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:56,696
that you have to walk through,
and then eventually...

809
01:05:57,034 --> 01:06:00,936
a full-size aquarium because obviously
we love birds, but we also love fish.

810
01:06:01,138 --> 01:06:03,163
How are we gonna pay for all this?

811
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:09,404
My boss is going
to think that we're crazy.

812
01:06:09,613 --> 01:06:11,410
Who got you that job
in the first place?

813
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:14,209
You only got it for me
so I could get you this house...

814
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:15,510
and these luxuries.

815
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:18,085
Well, It's obvious we don't share
the same dreams.

816
01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:21,917
That job was for you. And I pushed,
and I sweet-talked you into it...

817
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:24,959
because I knew that you would never
go down there by yourself.

818
01:06:25,162 --> 01:06:28,529
But it was all for you,
so you could be proud of yourself!

819
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:34,303
I have put up with an array of stuff
from you that no one should tolerate...

820
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:36,973
because I thought that
you would do the same for me.

821
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:40,869
But you made me feel like a freak.
Behave for your boss?

822
01:06:41,078 --> 01:06:45,607
Suddenly this is coming from who,
Mr. Whale Costume? Mr. Toxic Toilet!

823
01:06:46,016 --> 01:06:47,416
What about the show
that you put on in there?

824
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:50,747
Did you do one thing the entire night
that was even halfway normal?

825
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:59,991
No. Because I was mad and,
sadly, I was just being myself.

826
01:07:00,198 --> 01:07:02,496
0h, that’s yourself?
That’s yourself?

827
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:05,192
That’s the whole point,
Donald Duck.

828
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:10,934
You're just one more guy who sees
who I really am and can't handle it.

829
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:14,409
It broke my heart to see
how scared you were.

830
01:07:14,612 --> 01:07:16,240
-Scared?
-Bringing home your boss to prove...

831
01:07:16,447 --> 01:07:19,076
that you're normal by showing off
your smart pretty little wife?

832
01:07:20,118 --> 01:07:22,348
0nly he saw that she was
just as crazy as you are.

833
01:07:22,553 --> 01:07:23,885
Crazier!

834
01:07:29,762 --> 01:07:30,785
Crazier!

835
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:36,126
There's one difference
between us, Donald.

836
01:07:38,202 --> 01:07:40,194
You want to be normal.

837
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:41,970
You crave it.

838
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:45,570
And that is what broke us up.

839
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:50,348
I'm leaving now.

840
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,581
I don't want you here
when I get back.

841
01:07:53,786 --> 01:07:56,983
I don't want you here ever,
or you will regret it!

842
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:44,129
<i>So I got an unlisted number,
but there was no other way.</i>

843
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:46,271
<i>I can picture you still calling
every three minutes...</i>

844
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:49,066
<i>hoping for some electronic miracle.</i>

845
01:08:49,275 --> 01:08:52,642
<i>I'm...
I'm not mad anymore, Donald.</i>

846
01:08:53,512 --> 01:08:54,741
<i>I'm okay.</i>

847
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:57,314
<i>So don't obsess
on all that stuff I said.</i>

848
01:08:57,517 --> 01:08:59,985
Does she have any idea
who she's talking to?

849
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,688
<i>I've never been able to stay
with any guy for very long...</i>

850
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,551
<i>so I knew I'd end up
breaking your heart.</i>

851
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,285
<i>A piece of advice:
set a limit on...</i>

852
01:09:08,495 --> 01:09:10,520
<i>how many times you play this.
Like 20.</i>

853
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,790
<i>-And then erase it, okay?
-That’s 32 times that I've heard.</i>

854
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:15,895
It doesn't cost anything.

855
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,402
Don't worry.
I won't go out with her.

856
01:09:21,542 --> 01:09:23,840
I could never do that to you.

857
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:47,697
Who would go whale-watching?

858
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:51,964
It's a wholesome activity,
and the weather should be ideal.

859
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,436
But I'm foreseeing conditions
to the contrary, such as a...

860
01:09:55,643 --> 01:09:58,578
Low pressure front which
could really have the boat...

861
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,974
rocking and rolling.

862
01:10:01,182 --> 01:10:03,582
The ocean is five hours away.

863
01:10:06,053 --> 01:10:09,114
Yeah, but whales
are Donald’s favorite thing.

864
01:10:09,423 --> 01:10:11,550
And it would cheer him up
from Isabelle dumping him.

865
01:10:12,493 --> 01:10:14,928
I'm not going, and that’s for sure.

866
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:19,660
But you could be
the cruise lecturer.

867
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,836
It's a very prestigious position.

868
01:10:22,037 --> 01:10:24,266
0r perhaps contrast
the administrations of...

869
01:10:24,473 --> 01:10:26,964
Chester A. Arthur and
Millard Filmore or whatever!

870
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:31,201
Seven. Just two more
for the group rate.

871
01:10:33,915 --> 01:10:36,474
Let’s watch a whale.
It's on Sunday.

872
01:10:36,751 --> 01:10:40,083
Sunday I see my daddy in the hospital.
That’s just the way it is.

873
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:45,384
I could call Isabelle.
She doesn't hate me.

874
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:03,601
I have a list of friends.
Some of them are women.

875
01:11:33,275 --> 01:11:35,641
I know why you like living with me.

876
01:11:35,845 --> 01:11:37,779
I'm neater than Isabelle.

877
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:40,808
You're neater than me,
tied up in Bloom and that’s it.

878
01:11:41,017 --> 01:11:43,041
I file my food.
Nobody does that.

879
01:11:43,285 --> 01:11:45,345
Can I give you some advice?

880
01:11:45,555 --> 01:11:47,284
Can I humanly stop you?

881
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,891
Stick with the group.
Compared to us, you're a god.

882
01:11:51,127 --> 01:11:55,291
And next to Isabelle,
which you will never meet again...

883
01:11:55,498 --> 01:11:57,159
you don't come off so hot.

884
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,766
We can't hear you!

885
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:42,267
You got a message.

886
01:12:43,747 --> 01:12:46,739
-You got 17 of them.
-Actually...

887
01:12:47,484 --> 01:12:49,281
they're not for me.

888
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:56,959
<i>Donald.
Donald, please be there, please.</i>

889
01:12:57,794 --> 01:13:00,059
<i>Goddamnit, he's dead, Donald.</i>

890
01:13:00,664 --> 01:13:02,257
<i>Donald, Bongo died.</i>

891
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:05,532
<i>-That’s her rabbit.
-Where are you?</i>

892
01:13:18,949 --> 01:13:20,678
I'm so glad you came.

893
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,613
I don't know why I went
over the edge.

894
01:13:25,823 --> 01:13:27,950
I lost pets all my life.

895
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:35,796
What?

896
01:13:37,869 --> 01:13:39,461
I missed you.

897
01:13:45,176 --> 01:13:47,770
You never came for the birds
or the whale.

898
01:13:49,313 --> 01:13:51,406
God, you must have missed them.

899
01:13:54,652 --> 01:13:57,314
If I took them away,
this wouldn’t be my home anymore.

900
01:14:00,059 --> 01:14:01,787
Be my friend, Donald.

901
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:06,893
Be my best friend, please,
because I really need you.

902
01:14:08,599 --> 01:14:12,195
And I always felt you wanted us
to get married or something.

903
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:13,996
-Did I ever say that?
-Not in words.

904
01:14:14,273 --> 01:14:16,502
But instead of that,
do you want to just be my friend?

905
01:14:17,743 --> 01:14:20,712
-Without the sex?
-Without the pressure.

906
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:26,482
My friendship is all I have to give.

907
01:14:27,553 --> 01:14:28,850
Do you want it?

908
01:14:31,557 --> 01:14:32,887
0f course.

909
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,327
That makes me so happy.

910
01:14:51,444 --> 01:14:54,435
Yeah, but how do you know
that she knows what she wants?

911
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:56,547
I mean, you didn't see the way
that she was looking at me.

912
01:14:56,749 --> 01:14:58,650
That’s because I wasn't there.

913
01:15:00,419 --> 01:15:02,115
Yeah, but she was talking
about marriage.

914
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:04,313
To tell you that she didn't want to.

915
01:15:05,992 --> 01:15:08,654
Yeah, but I didn't bring it up.
She did.

916
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:11,057
And when I brought up sex,
she didn't exactly say no.

917
01:15:11,264 --> 01:15:13,494
When women want sex,
they usually say yes!

918
01:15:19,205 --> 01:15:21,765
-Why are you saying this?
-Donald!

919
01:15:21,974 --> 01:15:24,068
Donald! Donald!

920
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:27,303
If there's one thing I know
It's chicks.

921
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:32,384
That was a good load.

922
01:15:33,286 --> 01:15:35,277
Good drier, good pace.

923
01:15:42,395 --> 01:15:43,829
Yeah, but...

924
01:15:45,765 --> 01:15:47,699
Did you fix your tie?

925
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:50,301
Your table is ready.
Right this way.

926
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:53,838
This is so pretty, Donald.

927
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:06,685
Look, there's a little fish.
There's three. Hello!

928
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,525
Your chair, miss.
And may I take your coat?

929
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:19,358
-Yes, thank you.
-You're welcome.

930
01:16:22,837 --> 01:16:25,305
-And here's your menu.
-Thank you.

931
01:16:30,477 --> 01:16:32,673
The waiter will be with you soon.

932
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,781
-And have a wonderful evening.
-Thanks.

933
01:16:35,983 --> 01:16:39,885
This is completely irrational.
I'm very impressed.

934
01:16:40,955 --> 01:16:42,685
-Izzy!
-0h, my gosh!

935
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:45,819
This is gonna cost you a fortune.

936
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,928
He told me this is
the best food in town.

937
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:53,259
I wanted the place
to be special because...

938
01:16:54,502 --> 01:16:56,868
I have something special
to talk about.

939
01:16:57,472 --> 01:17:00,031
-Is it a surprise?
-Good evening.

940
01:17:03,544 --> 01:17:04,841
What is it?

941
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:06,679
What is it?

942
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,404
Donald?

943
01:17:08,783 --> 01:17:11,774
-Anything from the bar?
-Go away! What?

944
01:17:11,987 --> 01:17:13,920
-What is it? Tell me! Tell me!
-Take your time. I'll come back to...

945
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:16,352
...talk about the specials.
-What is it?

946
01:17:20,695 --> 01:17:21,684
Izzy...

947
01:17:24,299 --> 01:17:26,563
I don't think you know
what you want.

948
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:32,195
You got us a house,
and you got me the job.

949
01:17:35,477 --> 01:17:37,342
And we keep fighting...

950
01:17:38,346 --> 01:17:41,145
but you keep bringing me back
into your life.

951
01:17:43,219 --> 01:17:46,711
And today you brought up marriage,
and I think that you want that.

952
01:17:46,922 --> 01:17:48,184
And I want that too, because...

953
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:51,451
you're my only chance,
and I want that chance.

954
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,261
That’s very freaking flattering.

955
01:18:00,136 --> 01:18:02,798
You are my only chance
because I love you.

956
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:07,299
And I'm your only chance
because you love me too.

957
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:15,417
Marry me, Isabelle.

958
01:18:26,329 --> 01:18:29,093
-Thanks for taking the pressure off!
-Isabelle, don't freak out!

959
01:18:29,332 --> 01:18:32,824
-No. You're just like all the others.
-No, I'm not like all the others.

960
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:34,628
I don't want you to save me!

961
01:18:35,571 --> 01:18:37,972
I just want to be left alone!

962
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:21,573
185. Why did I have
to ask her to marry me?

963
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:41,836
0kay.

964
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:43,399
0kay.

965
01:19:43,608 --> 01:19:44,938
47, 48.

966
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:53,242
No, I got to go home.
I got to tell her not to marry me.

967
01:20:05,496 --> 01:20:07,361
Izzy, we got to talk!

968
01:20:10,835 --> 01:20:12,632
Izzy, where are you?

969
01:20:36,127 --> 01:20:40,121
Donald? I'm Dr. Jeffries,
Isabelle's psychiatrist.

970
01:20:40,365 --> 01:20:41,695
-Are you okay?
-Is she okay?

971
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,027
I signed the release, and she left.

972
01:20:44,235 --> 01:20:46,169
-Is that safe?
-She's going to be fine.

973
01:20:46,371 --> 01:20:47,770
She'll be in therapy.

974
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:49,531
She doesn't need therapy.
She's not crazy.

975
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:52,574
Donald, she needs someone
to listen to her.

976
01:20:53,212 --> 01:20:57,079
I'll go home and I'll listen.
I'm an excellent listener.

977
01:20:59,685 --> 01:21:01,118
I'll improve.

978
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:05,649
No, I won't.

979
01:21:05,858 --> 01:21:09,021
Well, Asperger's is a funny animal.

980
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:13,821
Can I go home now?

981
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:18,433
Donald.

982
01:21:19,071 --> 01:21:22,529
I don't want you to see her,
I don't want you to call her.

983
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:26,807
And neither does she. 0kay?

984
01:21:37,123 --> 01:21:38,180
Look at it this way.

985
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:40,416
She tried to kill herself because
he wouldn’t stop calling her.

986
01:21:40,626 --> 01:21:42,219
No. She tried to kill herself
because I wanted to marry her.

987
01:21:42,427 --> 01:21:43,326
It's completely different!

988
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:45,121
If I were you,
I would ask me for advice.

989
01:21:45,731 --> 01:21:47,393
Don't play her little game.

990
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,795
Write a story about how she was
eaten by Peruvian fire ants...

991
01:21:50,002 --> 01:21:52,335
and then run over by a car,
and then fax it to her.

992
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:55,531
She's expecting me to call.
If I don't, she's gonna go crazy...

993
01:21:55,742 --> 01:21:58,506
and think that
I don't love her anymore!

994
01:22:01,814 --> 01:22:04,180
I'm gonna find another phone.
I know the number.

995
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:07,353
Is it as good as the number,
say, 2-8-0-9?

996
01:22:08,454 --> 01:22:11,184
2809 is 53 squared
and 5 + 3 is 8.

997
01:22:11,391 --> 01:22:13,188
The cubed root of 8 is 2,
which is her dress size.

998
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:15,791
I bought her this beautiful dress
the other day that has flowers on it.

999
01:22:15,995 --> 01:22:17,292
6.

1000
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,758
It's not a richly textured number...

1001
01:22:18,965 --> 01:22:22,264
but it is her shoe size.
She has beautiful feet.

1002
01:22:22,468 --> 01:22:24,403
You guys, I know her
better than anybody!

1003
01:22:24,604 --> 01:22:26,163
I know that she needs me to call.

1004
01:22:26,372 --> 01:22:29,433
What if the doctor is right,
and you call and she kills herself?

1005
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:35,312
And then you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1006
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:48,254
How am I going to stop myself?

1007
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,425
What do you wear
when you stop smoking?

1008
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:58,295
A nicotine patch.

1009
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:15,313
9-6-6-0.

1010
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,745
No, I can't!

1011
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,464
No!

1012
01:26:06,596 --> 01:26:09,064
Excuse me, do you know
when the next bus 217 runs?

1013
01:26:09,267 --> 01:26:11,632
-Sorry.
-I'm chasing someone.

1014
01:26:12,035 --> 01:26:14,230
-By bus?
-Well, It's important.

1015
01:26:14,438 --> 01:26:17,066
Important enough to take the bus.

1016
01:26:19,242 --> 01:26:20,709
My girlfriend left me because...

1017
01:26:20,912 --> 01:26:23,903
I wanted to get married and
she wanted to stay just friends.

1018
01:26:24,449 --> 01:26:27,008
The slower this chase, the better.

1019
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,212
Stop the bus!

1020
01:27:40,558 --> 01:27:43,119
All this time, and you didn't call.

1021
01:27:43,862 --> 01:27:45,261
I was going to call.

1022
01:27:45,964 --> 01:27:47,022
You were?

1023
01:27:47,232 --> 01:27:49,826
Well, just to tell you that I wasn't
going to call so you wouldn’t...

1024
01:27:50,435 --> 01:27:52,961
be aggravated, sitting around
and wondering when I was...

1025
01:27:53,171 --> 01:27:54,832
Going to call?

1026
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,233
Yeah.

1027
01:27:57,976 --> 01:27:59,637
But in the end I figured that...

1028
01:28:01,414 --> 01:28:04,246
forcing myself into your life
was probably not right.

1029
01:28:06,285 --> 01:28:08,049
I don't always do that.

1030
01:28:09,389 --> 01:28:13,415
So the only nice thing I had left
to give was just not to call.

1031
01:28:17,095 --> 01:28:19,120
I hated you for not calling...

1032
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:21,061
'cause you were always going to
be there and when you weren't...

1033
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:22,962
it was as if...

1034
01:28:24,237 --> 01:28:26,397
you didn't love me anymore.

1035
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:31,872
So go home.
I'll call you.

1036
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:41,479
I can't promise you the future,
Donald Duck.

1037
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:46,681
I don't know if this is
for 2 days or 20 years.

1038
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:56,628
Finally, there's something
about us that’s normal.

1039
01:29:19,627 --> 01:29:21,685
I missed you so much.

1040
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:41,647
All right, look at what Donald made.

1041
01:29:41,849 --> 01:29:43,373
I'm hungry!

1042
01:29:43,684 --> 01:29:46,518
-Delicious.
-Thanksgiving.

1043
01:29:46,788 --> 01:29:50,155
-Stop it!
-Blume, don't, don't. Blume...

1044
01:29:52,593 --> 01:29:54,584
All right, so I wanted
to thank Donald...

1045
01:29:54,796 --> 01:29:57,822
who made this amazing lunch and...

1046
01:29:58,633 --> 01:30:02,069
I just wanted to thank you all
for coming, because...

1047
01:30:02,804 --> 01:30:05,203
you are our family.

1048
01:30:05,472 --> 01:30:08,340
And I...
Well, we love you.

1049
01:30:11,246 --> 01:30:12,372
Hear, hear!

1050
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:15,447
Wait, wait. This is to...

1051
01:30:15,917 --> 01:30:17,611
Donald Morton...

1052
01:30:17,951 --> 01:30:19,612
my husband.

1053
01:30:19,821 --> 01:30:21,186
Cheers!

1054
01:30:30,565 --> 01:30:32,055
I love you!

1055
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,150
Anyone want gravy?
