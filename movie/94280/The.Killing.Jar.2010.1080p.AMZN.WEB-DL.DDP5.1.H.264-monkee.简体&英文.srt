
3
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,461
真哒 那好
Oh, really? Okay, okay.

4
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,593
为啥不呢
Yeah, why not?

5
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,094
那不是米娅吗
Hey, isn't that Mia?

6
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,049
抱歉 我一定是滑了
I'm so sorry, I-I must have slipped.

7
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:01,964
游得还尽兴吗
Did you have a nice swim there?

8
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,470
别碰我
Don't touch me.

9
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:06,501
天啦
Oh, my God!

10
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,390
真的是意外
It was an accident, I swear.

11
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:16,286
姐们 你妹真逊
Dude, your sister is so lame.

12
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:19,280
她不是我妹
She's not my sister.

13
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,017
走吧
Come on.

14
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:21,054
我们走
Let's go.

15
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,504
天啦
Oh, my God!

16
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:29,817
好一条鲁蛇
Such a loser!

17
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:49,777
她怎么全湿了 天哪
Why is she all wet? I swear!

18
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:52,370
很不好意思
I'm sorry about that.

19
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,568
明天见吧
But we are going to see you tomorrow, right?

20
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,441
对 明天
Yeah. Tomorrow.

21
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,746
好 再见
Okay. Bye.

22
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,906
我保证超好玩
It's going to be amazing! I promise!

23
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,761
超好 别忘带比基尼
Amazing! Bring your bikini!

24
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,524
说说怎么回事?
Do you want to tell me what happened?

25
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:19,920
开车就好
You should just drive.

26
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,836
<i>墨西哥 尤卡坦半岛</i>

27
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:45,750

Hey!

29
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,702
你穿外套游泳的吗
Whoa, did you go for a swim in your clothes?

30
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:51,747
闭嘴 本
Shut up, Ben!

31
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,567
米米
Hey, Mimi!

32
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,490
别这么叫我
Don't call me that!

33
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,726
你怎么湿透了
Why are you all wet?

34
00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:59,056
她为什么湿了
Why is she all wet?

35
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,629
我得和她谈谈 宝贝
I have to talk to her, babe.

36
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:06,135
怎么了 什么情况
What happened? Hey! What happened?

37
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,947
学校有人推她下游泳池
Somebody pushed her in the pool at school.

38
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,045
没什么的
No big deal.

39
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,417
没人喜欢她 但那不是我错
It's not my fault that nobody likes her.

40
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,478
你这么说很不好
You know, that's a real nasty thing to say.

41
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,912
抱歉
Sorry.

42
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,145
萨莎
Sasha!

43
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:24,555
搬到这儿来 是很难
Look, I know it's tough moving here,

44
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,749
但你俩得互相照应 好吗
but you two got to look out for each other, okay?

45
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:29,466
好
Okay.

46
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:30,666
谢了
Thanks.

47
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,703
你们搬完了没
You guys about done?

好 谢谢
Alright, thanks.

54
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,046
我能进来吗
Mind if I come in?

55
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,024
怎么回事
What's going on?

56
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:12,709
我讨厌这里
I hate it here.

57
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,928
米娅 你其实坚强得多
Mia, you're so much stronger than you think you are.

58
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:23,134
如果你妈在 她会为你骄傲的
And if your Mom were here, she'd be really proud of you.

59
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,609
但她不在
Well, she's not here, is she?

60
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,116
能叫你一声女儿 我很自豪的
Well, I'm proud to call you my daughter.

61
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:38,083
你和萨莎 时常不对眼 但我们是一家人
Look, I know you and Sasha have a hard time sometimes, but we're family.

62
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,157
她不是我姐
She's not my sister.

63
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:55,513
很好味
It's very good.

64
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:56,514
棒
It's great.

65
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,505
差点忘了 看我今早找到的
Hey, I almost forgot to show you guys what I found this morning.

66
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,431
来看
Look at this.

67
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,163
那是鲨鱼牙
That's a shark tooth.

68
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,166
对
Yeah.

69
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:12,814
是大白鲨的吗
Is it a great white?

70
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:13,844
应该是
I think so.

71
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:15,338
你哪找的
Where did you find it?

72
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,460
我们发现了通往海底古城新区域的通道
We uncovered a passageway that leads to a new part of the city.

73
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,259
好
Nice.

74
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,744
但鲨鱼是怎么进去的
But how did the shark get in there?

75
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,841
我不知道
I don't know.

76
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,179
也许它从海里游来 猎杀海豹来的
Maybe he swam in from the sea, chasing a seal,

77
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,310
几百年前 迷失于海底通道群
Got lost in the tunnels hundreds of years ago.

78
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,136
真不错
That's so cool!

79
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:36,532
东西你留着
You can keep it.

80
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,834
那玩意儿 令我浮想联翩
That kind of brings me around to something else.

81
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:41,426
姑娘们 我说过周末要陪你们的
Girls, I know I said I was going to hang with you this weekend,

82
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,776
但发现新通道后
But opening this new passageway,

83
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:46,019
考古队一定会来的
It means that there's this team of archaeologists.

84
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:47,860
他们下周从欧洲飞来 -很好 爸爸
They fly in from Europe next week. - It's fine, Dad.

85
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,559
所以我得测绘完洞穴 布置照明
So I got to finish mapping the caves, laying the lights...

86
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:51,843
你不必解释
You don't have to explain.

87
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,750
但你父亲有特别安排给你俩
But your father planned something very special for the two of you.

88
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:58,763
什么
What?

89
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:01,259
鲨鱼牙就是提示
Well, the shark tooth is a clue.

90
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:04,723
女士们 来看 你帮传递下
Girls, come on. Here, show them.

91
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,205
给你
There you go.

92
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:12,507
玻底船之旅
A glass bottomed boat ride

93
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,257
去看自然栖息地的大白鲨?
To see great white sharks in their natural habitat?

94
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:17,569
很好玩的样子
Sounds fun to me.

95
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:18,863
不 这是给游客的
No. This is for tourists.

96
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:20,495
我们就是游客
Well, we're kind of tourists.

97
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,865
姑娘们 会很赞的
Girls, it's going to be awesome.

98
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,945
可以去看大白鲨进食
They take you out to where the great whites feed.

99
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:28,623
通过船底玻璃来观看鲨鱼
You get to watch them through this viewing gallery in the bottom of the ship.

100
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:29,317
很赞的
It's awesome.

101
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,292
不行 我明天有安排
No. I have plans for tomorrow.

102
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,715
你重新安排一下就好
Well, you'll just have to rearrange your plans.

103
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,008
再说 你们俩正好趁机相处
And besides, I think this is a wonderful way for the two of you

104
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:38,081
共度美好的时光 -对
To spend quality time together. - Yeah.

105
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,076
你去哪
Where are you going?

106
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:47,046
去告诉雅丽莎和妮可 我明天去不了了
To let Alexa and Nicole know that I can't hang out tomorrow.

107
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:48,178
可以吗
Is that okay?

108
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:50,105
注意说话
Watch your tone.

109
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:56,465
明天的事我很抱歉 但鲨鱼很不错
Well, I am sorry about tomorrow, but the sharks are going to be really cool.

110
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:59,720
下周我们可以去潜水
And maybe next week you and I can go scuba diving.

111
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,754
你以前超爱和我一起潜水的
Remember how much you used to like diving with me?

112
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,760
对 当时我10岁 爸爸
Yeah, I was, like, ten years old, Dad.

113
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,668
十岁 我见过的最年轻的潜水者
Ten years old. The youngest person I'd ever seen scuba dive.

114
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:07,923
你开玩笑吧
Come on. Are you kidding me?

115
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:08,843
也是最可爱的潜水者
And the cutest.

116
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:11,721
你游起泳来就像海猴子
Yeah, you were like a little sea monkey.

117
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:29,344
各位今天谁想看鲨鱼
Alright, guys. Who's ready to see some sharks today?

118
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,918
我回家顺道来接你 好吗
I'll pick you up on the way home. Okay?

119
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:38,687
好
Alright.

120
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:43,856
米米 别被鲨鱼吃掉
Hey, Mimi, don't get eaten by a shark!

121
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:44,476

I'll save you!

125
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,140

Look!

126
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,658
真不敢相信她来了
I can't believe she's here.

127
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,828
天哪
Oh, my gosh!

128
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,635
你们来干什么
What the hell are you guys doing here?

129
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:17,950

我说了没法去
I told you, I can't.

131
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,295
姐们 我带你去个地方
Dude, I am going to take you to a place that

132
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:24,179
100万年之内没有游客会去的
no tourists would ever find in a million years.

133
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:26,212
一生一次的机会
Chance of a lifetime.

134
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:28,458
或者你宁愿去坐玻底船
Or would you rather stay on this stupid boat instead?

135
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,517
是啊
Yeah.

136
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,886
你想去就去
I mean stay. Stay if you want to.

137
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:35,680
也许你可以和凯瑟琳交个朋友
Hey, maybe you can become friends with Catherine.

138
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,235
聊她有多漂亮
Talk about how beautiful she is!

She is beautiful though.

140
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:40,919
姐们 闭嘴
Dude, shut up!

141
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,017
你自己决定
It's up to you.

142
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,978
来吧 -等一下
Come on! - One second.

143
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:51,110
你真想和那些妞在玻底船上待一天吗
You really want to spend all day on a boat with those girls?

144
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:54,736
来吧
Come on.

145
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,294
她好怕
She's so scared.

146
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:00,588
你怎么看
What do you think?

147
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:01,435
我不知道
I don't know.

148
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,336
别让那些妞搞你
Don't let those girls get to you.

149
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,603
凯瑟琳
Catherine.

150
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,484
快
Come on.

151
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:13,678
拜 凯瑟琳
Goodbye, Catherine.

152
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:16,062
走吧 快
Let's go. Come on.

153
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:02,997
注意脚下
Okay, watch your step.

154
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,218
我们就快到了
Guys, come on! We're almost there.

155
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,505
你一直这么说
You keep saying that.

156
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,790
这次是真心话
This time I mean it.

157
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,566
天哪
Oh, my God!

158
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:48,791
你怎么知道这里的
I mean, how did you even find out about this place?

159
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,994
本带我来过
Ben took me here.

160
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,466
本 就是我继父的助手吗
Ben? Like my stepdad's assistant Ben?

161
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,691
她...别说了 天哪
Oh, she... stop with that. Oh, my God!

162
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,968
怎么下去呢
Okay, so how do we get down there?

163
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:02,625
那边绕路下去
So there's a path that'll take us around and down.

164
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:07,725
走水路也行
Or you could go that way.

165
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,896
你们还在等什么
What are you waiting for?

166
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,335
好神奇的
It's amazing!

167
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:15,687
我不知道 我
I don't know, I...

168
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,770
我们该步行下去
We should take the path.

169
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,347
超好玩
That was amazing!

170
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,877
步什么行啊
Screw the path.

171
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:49,803
太酷了
That's so cool.

172
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:51,343
看这些装备
Look at all this stuff.

173
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:00,459
超多潜水装备
That's a lot of scuba gear.

174
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:03,018
你的继父和本 一直有搬运设备
This is all the equipment that your stepdad and Ben have been storing

175
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,346
给下周的考古队用
for the archaeologist team that's coming next week.

176
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,845
这是古城的入口吗
Is this the entrance to the City?

177
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,692
如果被我爸发现 他会杀了我们
Guys, if my Dad finds us, he's going to kill us.

178
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,712
安啦 我和本说过了
Chill. I talked to Ben.

179
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:15,731
你爸在另一边 测绘新通道呢
Your Dad is on the other side, mapping out the new tunnel they found.

180
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,676
他们不可能知道我们在这边
They will never know we were here.

181
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,803
我觉得根本不像古城
Doesn't look like much of a city to me.

182
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,222
是玛雅人古城
It's Mayan.

183
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:24,772
这是地下城 底下还有他们的墓地
It was built underground, out of their burial sites,

184
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:27,918
为了躲避入侵者而建造的
to hide from the Conquistadors when they invaded.

185
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,988
后来海平面上升 淹没了大部分古城
Rising sea levels put most of it underwater.

186
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,887
多谢了 教授
Thank you, Professor.

187
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,596
本带你潜入过古城吗
Did Ben ever take you diving into the city?

188
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:37,920
去过一次
Yeah, once.

189
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:39,922
是什么样子
What's it like?

190
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,326
太疯狂了
It's pretty insane down there.

191
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:45,436
我们只去了第一洞穴
I mean, we only went as far as the first cave.

192
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:47,876
那个洞穴是个入口
It was built as an entrance to

193
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:52,182
通往西巴尔巴? -西巴尔巴 对
...is it Xibalba? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Xibalba! Yeah!

194
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:54,689
吓人的地方 -嗯
Place of fear. - Yeah.

195
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:57,178
就像我说的 玛雅地下世界
Like I was saying, the Mayan underworld.

196
00:17:57,963 --> 00:17:59,274
葬穴
Burial caves.

197
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,219
好吓人 但真的很酷
Yeah, it's pretty scary, but it's really cool.

198
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:06,970
有很多古老雕像 祭坛等等
They have all these old statues, and altars, and stuff.

199
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,293
那还等什么
So what are we waiting for?

200
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,423
拜托 只是第一洞穴
Come on. Just the first cave.

201
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:16,458
但我爸 -他远着呢
But my Dad... - Is miles away!

202
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,192
但他们有别的通道入内
Yeah, they have a different way in.

203
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,479
看 万事齐备
Here, look. Everything we need.

204
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:24,409
但没有脚蹼 所以
I mean, there's no fins, so...

205
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:27,513
拜托 就去第一洞穴 又没让你游览全城
Come on! It's the first cave. We're not swimming the whole city.

206
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:30,110
各位 洞穴潜水很危险
Guys, cave diving is dangerous.

207
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:31,220
洞穴潜水是危险的
Cave diving is dangerous!

208
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,950
不 米娅是对的 妮可
No. Mia is right, Nicole.

209
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,623
我真的不太懂
I don't really know about this.

210
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:38,505
我们大老远过来 都不看圣殿的吗
Look, we've come all this way and we don't even see the temple? Really?

211
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:41,504
这绝对与众不同 -对啊
It's unlike anything you ever seen before. - Yeah.

212
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,022
我们入内后 绕第一洞穴一圈就出来
We should just go in, go once around the first cave, and then out.

213
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,089
来吧
Yeah. Come on.

214
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,624
你上次潜水是什么时候
When was the last time you went diving?

215
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:50,429
若干年前
Years ago.

216
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,824
我过去常和爸爸一起潜水 -完美
I used to go all the time with Dad, - Perfect.

217
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,781
但我没潜过洞穴
but I've never been in caves before.

218
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:59,082
就像骑单车吧 我是说...
It's like riding a bike, right? I mean...

219
00:18:59,272 --> 00:18:59,858
来吧 米娅
Come on, Mia!

220
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:00,431
米米
Mimi!

221
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:03,442
她会去的 我们走 太好了
Yeah, she's going to do it! Let's go! Let's go, that's great!

222
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:06,614
去吧 米娅 -来吧 出发
Let's go, Mia! Yes! - Come on! We're doing it, let's go!

223
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,197
会很好玩的
Hey, it's going to be fun, okay?

224
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,302
记住 动作轻巧 幅度要小
Just remember, keep your movements nice and small.

225
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,328
绝对不要踢到淤泥
Last thing you want to do is kick up silt down there.

226
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:18,873
不然伸手不见五指
You won't be able to see your own hands.

227
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,911
好 你们准备好了吗
Okay. You guys ready?

228
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,086
我打头阵 你们全程跟我
I'm going to lead. Keep behind me at all times.

229
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,319
第一洞穴 绕一圈 就返回
One circuit around the first cave, and back.

230
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,171
是 老师
Yes, teacher.

231
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:29,255
妮可 我是认真的 要么照我说的做 要么...
Nicole, I'm serious. Either you do as I say, or...

232
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,891
行 我听见了
Yeah, I hear you.

233
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:36,041
可别这样
we don't do it at all.

234
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:50,343
走吧 女士们 快点
Let's go, ladies. Get a move on.

235
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:53,489
大家都还好吗 萨莎 你好吗
Everyone okay? Sasha, are you good?

236
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:54,831
很好
Yeah.

237
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:55,961
米娅
Mia?

238
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:57,358
我很好
Yeah, I'm good.

239
00:19:57,657 --> 00:20:00,636
各自检查气压计 必须保证气量充足
Everybody check your air gauges. You should all have a full tank.

240
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,942
我的是100%
Mine's on 100 percent.

241
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,451
我也是
Me too.

242
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:10,222
快点吧 我都变老了
Come on, I'm getting old already!

243
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,312
好 打开你的灯
Okay. Turn your lights on.

244
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,262
跟我来 入口就在台阶底
Follow me. The entrance is just at the bottom of the steps.

245
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,179
我们走
Let's go.

246
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:03,895
下面有惊喜 吓死你们
You guys are going to freak out. It's insane down there.

247
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:16,638
快
Come on!

248
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:19,602
天哪 你确定吗
Oh, my God. Are you sure about this?

249
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:21,390
嗯 信我啦
Yeah, trust me.

250
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:55,295
天哪 果然有惊喜
Oh, my God! This is so crazy!

251
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:03,844
我们真的来了
I can't believe we're doing this.

252
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:13,205
看啊
Look at that.

253
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:20,403
气瓶用完后 洞穴上方留存的空气还能救命
Run out of air in a cave, and your last chance is sucking the air from those.

254
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:21,485
不会吧
Seriously?

255
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:23,760
当然 要不你试试
For sure. You want to try it?

256
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:27,470
此处变窄 依次进入
The corridor gets narrow up here, so single file.

257
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:36,989
穿此处过
Just through here.

258
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:39,897
你们都好吗
You all okay?

259
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:40,930
很好
Yup. - Yeah.

260
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,243
我很好
Yeah, I'm good.

261
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,811
萨莎 你那大屁屁 卡住了吧
Sasha, you could barely get your ass through there.

262
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:07,659
闭嘴 妮可 起码我还有屁屁
Shut up, Nicole. At least I have an ass.

263
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:23,144
没事吧 米娅
All okay? Mia?

264
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:24,423
没事 -萨莎?
Yeah. - Sasha?

265
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,971
没事 -妮可?
Nicole?

266
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:27,456
没事 老师
Yes, teacher!

267
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,175
都准备好了吗
You guys ready for this?

268
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:47,763
你...
Holy...

269
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:48,678
大爷
...crap!

270
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,445
酷啊
That's so cool!

271
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:53,253
我说的吧
I told you guys.

272
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:55,957
西巴尔巴
Xibalba.

273
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:58,467
这地儿不错吧
This place is insane, right?

274
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:00,924
妮可 不
Hey. Nicole! No!

275
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:02,232
呆我身后 大家一起
Keep behind me and keep together.

276
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:04,766
好 好 好
Okay. Okay. Okay.

277
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:08,682
绕祭坛一圈 然后我们回去吧
One lap around the altar, and then we head back, right?

278
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:09,684
行
Right.

279
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:13,362
我们走
Let's go.

280
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:23,401
天哪
Oh, my God!

281
00:25:21,072 --> 00:25:23,486
他们在这里献祭活人
They made human sacrifices here.

282
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:25,310
恐怖
Creepy.

283
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:38,428
大家看见没有
Guys, did you see that?

284
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:40,165
我感觉有动静
I think I saw something move.

285
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,267
这里啥都没有 妮可
There's nothing down here, Nicole.

286
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:48,745
那里有动静
There was something there.

287
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:50,674
拜托 妮可
Oh, come on, Nicole.

288
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,088
也许是美人鱼
Maybe it was a mermaid.

289
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:55,230
闭嘴 萨莎 我是认真的
Shut up, Sasha. I'm serious.

290
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,677
得了 妮可 别瞎闹
Come on, Nicole. Stop messing around.

291
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:00,903
也许是我爸
Maybe it was my Dad.

292
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:03,701
你爸在古城的另一边
Your Dad's on the other side of the city.

293
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:05,919
那里什么都没有 妮可大白痴
There's nothing there. Nicole's just being an idiot.

294
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,634
我听到了 雅丽莎
I heard that, Alexa.

295
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,462
来 我们回去
Come on, let's just go back.

296
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:12,123
说好了进来就直奔回程的
We said we would come in, and then head straight back out, right?

297
00:26:16,195 --> 00:26:17,117
妮可
Nicole!

298
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:26,234
妮可
Nicole?

299
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,370
妮可 少白痴了
Nicole, stop being an idiot.

300
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,074
来看 看
Come, look, look!

301
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:55,613
看
Look!

302
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:57,098
天哪
Oh, my God!

303
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:00,715
它的眼睛呢
Where are its eyes?

304
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:02,510
它没有眼睛
It doesn't have any.

305
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,262
是墨西哥盲...瞎眼洞穴鱼
It's a Mexican tetra... a blind cave fish.

306
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:08,386
等等 我听说过
Wait, I heard about these.

307
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,666
此处没有光线 所以它们无需颜色或眼睛
No light down here, so they don't need color or eyes.

308
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:13,595
是进化的结果
They evolved without.

309
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:17,263
它怎么知道要去哪
How does it know where it's going?

310
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,372
它有增强感官
Heightened senses.

311
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:21,276
它们居然有这么大
I didn't know they got this big.

312
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:23,636
也许它从未见过人
It's probably never known a human.

313
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,576
它在躲着我们
It's hiding from us.

314
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:29,485
谁说它在躲的是我们
Well, who says it's us it's hiding from?

315
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:30,884
得了
Stop!

316
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:33,722
过来 小鱼 幸会 -不 妮可 我才不会
Here, fishy fishy! Nice to meet... - No, Nicole. I wouldn't.

317
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:36,325
不
No!

318
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:41,579
不 柱子别倒
No, stop it from falling!

319
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:44,385
不
No!

320
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,212
姐妹们
Guys? Guys?

321
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:01,454
我听不见
I can't hear you!

322
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:03,470
谁都别动
Nobody move!

323
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,294
有人吗 妮可 萨莎 你们在哪
Anyone? Nicole? Sasha, where are you?

324
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:14,437
姐妹们 我看不见你们 你们在哪
Guys? I can't see you guys, where are you?

325
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:25,988
萨莎 我听不见 姐妹们在哪
Sasha... I can't hear you, guys, where are you?

326
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,247
萨莎
Sasha!

327
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:33,331
我谁都看不见
I can't see anyone.

328
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:42,053
萨莎
Sasha!

329
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:54,647
萨莎
Sasha!

330
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:58,735
雅丽莎 我看不见
Alexa, I can't see!

331
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:00,509
米娅
Mia!

332
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:02,955
米娅 你怎么在这里
Mia! What are you doing here?

333
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:05,434
天哪 抱歉 抱歉
Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

334
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:07,328
我们之前在湖边
We were at the lake and... - Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

335
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,721
冷静 没事的 -太傻了 对不起
Calm down, alright? It's okay. - It was really stupid, I'm sorry.

336
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:13,842
我猜猜 雅丽莎说服你下来的
Let me guess. Alexa persuaded you to come down here, huh?

337
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,331
后来我们撞倒了石柱
And then we knocked over a stone column,

338
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:18,880
一片灰我什么都看不见
and I got totally lost in the silt.

339
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,745
这里有救生索
You didn't think to come down here with a guideline?

340
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,220
米娅 米娅 谢天谢地
Mia! Mia! Thank God!

341
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:25,032
早就该猜到
Oh, man, I should've known.

342
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:27,191
你是想尝试洞穴潜水
So you thought you'd try a little bit of cave diving, huh?

343
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:28,901
我 我很抱歉
I'm... I'm so sorry.

344
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:32,094
说实话 我们本打算进来就走的
Honestly, we were supposed to just go in and then straight back out again.

345
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,813
以后不带你去我的秘密地点了
That's the last time I'm showing you any of my secret spots.

346
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,498
萨莎和妮可就在附近
I take it Sasha and Nicole are close by?

347
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:39,316
她们在出口处等
They're waiting by the exit.

348
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:40,873
那可太好了
Yeah? What a surprise.

349
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:44,351
在被你爸发现之前 我们先出去
Let's just get you guys the hell out of here before your Dad finds out.

350
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,725
你不会告诉他吧
You're not going to tell him, are you?

351
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:47,019
你耍我么
Are you kidding me?

352
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,228
雅丽莎 其他人呢
Alexa, where are the others?

353
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:04,594
她们在哪 萨莎 妮可 萨莎
Where are they? Sasha? Nicole? Sasha?

354
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,126
米娅 你在哪
Mia! Where are you?

355
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,898
萨莎 看 她们来了
Sasha! Look they're here, they're here!

356
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:10,913
姐妹们 有条鲨鱼
Guys, there's a shark.

357
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:12,209
米娅 那是什么
Mia, what is it?

358
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:14,110
真的有条鲨鱼
There's a shark. I'm serious.

359
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:15,536
它杀了本
It killed Ben.

360
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:16,362
什么
What?

361
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:19,536
我们必须马上离开
We have to go. We have to go now.

362
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,550
你真的把我吓坏了
You're really freaking me out right now.

363
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:24,252
姐妹们 如果这是玩笑 根本不好笑
Guys, if this is some kind of joke, it's not funny.

364
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:25,291
萨莎 注意你后面
Sasha, behind you!

365
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:30,123
鲨鱼
Shark!

366
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,906
快点游
Swim! Swim! Go on!

367
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:51,095
大家快走
Guys, come on, move! Move!

368
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:58,974
通道要崩塌了 赶紧
The tunnel is starting to collapse. We need to hurry.

369
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,533
快点继续前进
Keep going, come on, go, go!

370
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:14,437
雅丽莎
Alexa!

371
00:31:27,123 --> 00:31:29,723
我该怎么办 雅丽莎 我该怎么办
What do I do, Alexa, what do I do?

372
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,923
推 帮我推 快
Push. Help me push. Come on.

373
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:36,645
推
Push.

374
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,976
帮我弄开石头
Help me move these rocks.

375
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,696
推
Push.

376
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,593
我们被困住了
We're trapped.

377
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,527
一定有出路
There has to be a way out.

378
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,353
拜托
Come on.

379
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:52,078
这样没有用 雅丽莎 雅丽莎
You guys, it's pointless. It's pointless. Alexa! Alexa!

380
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:57,555
雅丽莎 看着我
Alexa! Look at me.

381
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:00,909
你说本和我爸 另有出口
You said Ben and my Dad went through a different entrance.

382
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:05,047
萨莎 这里是迷宫 我不可能找到他
Sasha, this place is a maze. I would never be able to find him.

383
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:09,056
大家看这里有条绳索
Guys! Guys, there's a line.

384
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,601
本 本 他带着救生索
Ben... Ben, he had the guideline with him.

385
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:15,210
绳索通往他们工作的地方
It leads back to where they were working.

386
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,462
鲨鱼怎么办
What about the shark?

387
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,798
看起来也是瞎的 就像脂鲤
It looked blind. Like the tetra fish.

388
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:21,630
它必然也是在这里进化的
It must have evolved down here.

389
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:25,267
我爸爸打开新洞穴入口后 鲨鱼放过了他
When my dad opened up the new cave, it must have let him through.

390
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:27,203
米娅 是不是一条大白鲨
Mia, was that a great white?

391
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,765
应该是的
Yeah, I think so.

392
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,566
所有人检查气量
Everybody check your air.

393
00:32:33,997 --> 00:32:35,747
我还剩40%
I have about forty percent left.

394
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,406
你们呢
What about you guys?

395
00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:40,884
我40%
I have forty.

396
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:42,649
38%
Thirty eight.

397
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:43,982
35%
Thirty five.

398
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:48,441
据我所知 我们没太多选择
Okay, we don't have much of a choice, as far as I can see.

399
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:51,413
所有人靠拢
Everyone needs to stay close, okay?

400
00:32:51,945 --> 00:32:53,332
那鲨鱼怎么办
But what about the shark?

401
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:57,042
我们能行 雅丽莎 不会有事的
We can do this, Alexa. It's going to be okay.

402
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,650
好 来吧 我们走
Okay, come on. Let's go.

403
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:11,402
救生索
The guideline.

404
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:12,595
我能看见它
I can see it.

405
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,384
靠拢了
Stay close.

406
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,853
跟着绳索 就能找到格兰特
If we follow the line, it will take us to Grant.

407
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,630
对 我们走
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

408
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,271
绳索通向下方
The line leads down here.

409
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,303
这边
This way.

410
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:43,692
你没事吧 米娅
Are you okay, Mia?

411
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:44,694
没事
Yeah.

412
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:19,442
天哪 这是什么地方
Oh, my God! What is this place?

413
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:28,020
地下墓穴 古城是建造在墓室之上的
Catacombs. This city was built out of their burial chambers.

414
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:32,085
绳索被勾住了
The line's caught on something.

415
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:41,420
快 萨莎 我们得前进
Come on. Sasha, we need to move.

416
00:37:47,062 --> 00:37:47,983
姐妹们
Guys.

417
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:54,495
我们该怎么办
What are we going to do?

418
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,978
继续前进
We need to keep going.

419
00:37:57,798 --> 00:37:59,313
我们会死在这里
We're going to die down here.

420
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:03,929
不 快接近格兰特了
No. Grant has to be close.

421
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,298
现在不能放弃
We can't give up.

422
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:04,056
不不 死路 必须返回
No, no, it's a dead end. We have to go back.

423
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:06,399
没别的路了 我们能返回哪
There's no other way. Where are we going to go back to?

424
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,294
空气耗尽 我们就会窒息
We're going to run out of air. We're going to drown.

425
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:10,705
我们会窒息的
We're going to drown!

426
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:11,949
等等
Wait! Wait!

427
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:28,484
他们在哪 萨莎 爸爸在哪
Where are they? Sasha, where's Dad?

428
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:31,471
他一定在附近 格兰特

爸爸 你在哪 -格兰特

431
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:37,108
爸 -格兰特 你能听到我们吗
Dad! - Grant, can you hear us?

432
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:38,548
一定还有别的路
There's another way through.

433
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,237
下沉
Get down!

434
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:15,227
关掉
Turn it off!

435
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:26,538
这边
This way.

436
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,244
继续
Keep going.

437
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,686

440
00:41:54,488 --> 00:41:55,573
这边
This way!

441
00:41:59,846 --> 00:42:01,010
快

00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:06,411
快点 快
Hurry! Come on!

444
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,221
鲨鱼还跟着我们吗
Did the shark follow us?

445
00:42:27,766 --> 00:42:29,052
这里应该很安全
I think we're safe here.

446
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:32,195
很窄 鲨鱼进不来
It's too narrow for the shark to follow.

447
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:36,250
你没事吧 -我很好
Are you okay? - I'm fine.

448
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:45,687
姐妹们 空气很臭
Guys, the air tastes bad.

449
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:49,346
这里是气室 存在有一段时间了
It's an air pocket. It's been here a while.

450
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:51,010
没太多空气的
We can't breathe it for long.

451
00:42:51,222 --> 00:42:52,144
现在怎么办
So what do we do?

452
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,829
看不到任何出路
I can't see any way out of here.

453
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:04,820
你还剩多少空气
How much air do you have left?

454
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:08,434
我还有22%
I've got twenty two percent.

455
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,536
我20% -19%
I'm on twenty. - Nineteen.

456
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:12,036
21%
Twenty one.

457
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,258
你们听到吗
Do you hear that?

458
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:18,160
嘘 听 听
Shhh. Listen. Listen.

459
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:21,733
好像是音乐
I think it's music.

460
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,476
不可能 -对
That's impossible. - Yeah.

461
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:27,394
从这边传过来的
It's coming from over here.

462
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,391
一定是我爸
It has to be my Dad.

463
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,066
这是死路
It's a dead end.

464
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:48,860
米娅
Mia!

465
00:44:03,866 --> 00:44:05,510
米娅 米娅 你没事吧

There's a gap. - Okay?

467

我能通过 -好
Yeah. I can get through. - Okay.

468
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:10,201
我过去以后会通知你们
I'll let you know when I'm on the other side.

469
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:11,784
不 我们该在一起
No. We should stay together.

470
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,685
在一起是浪费空气
There's no point in all of us using our air.

471
00:44:14,602 --> 00:44:15,818
你确定能行吗
Are you sure you can do this?

472
00:44:15,934 --> 00:44:17,163
能行 -请小心

486
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,168
这是紧急警报
It's an emergency alarm.

487
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,750
用于寻找洞穴潜水员的
Designed to help locate a diver in a cave.

488
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:55,633

她没有回应 我们得去帮她
She's not responding. We have to go help her.

506
00:50:24,736 --> 00:50:26,185
万一她被鲨鱼咬了
What if the shark got her?

507
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,219
姐妹们 我迷路了 我听不见你们

She's back there with Alexa and Nicole, but I can't hear them any more.

517
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,893
因为无线电信号受影响
It's because these columns are breaking up the radio signal.

00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:13,021
你们看
Girls! Girls! Look!

576
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:17,756
鲨鱼走了
They're gone.

577
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:28,100
鲨鱼去哪儿了
Where did they go?

578
00:58:31,316 --> 00:58:32,502
它们害怕声音
They're scared of it.

579
00:58:33,397 --> 00:58:34,709
鲨鱼 进化成瞎子
The sharks... they've evolved blind,

580
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,642
同时它们听觉增强
and they have a heightened sense of hearing.

581
00:58:36,982 --> 00:58:38,671
必然和频率有关
It must be the frequency.

582
00:58:38,803 --> 00:58:41,136
也许用警报能把它们吓走
Maybe we can use the alarm to scare them away.

583
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,414
如果我们今晚不回去的话
I mean, someone's going to come looking

584
00:58:42,529 --> 00:58:44,342
有人会来找我们的 对吗
for us when we don't come back tonight, right?

585
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:46,693
唯一知道我们去处的人 都在这里
The only people that know where we are, are right here.

586
00:58:46,897 --> 00:58:48,303
这洞穴的入口 是我新发现的
I just found the entrance to this cave.

587
00:58:48,383 --> 00:58:50,326
只有我知道坐标
I'm the only one who knows where it is.

588
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,767
没有攀登器 我们上不去
And there's no way we can get back up without the ascender.

589
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,445
现在怎么办
What are we going to do?

590
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:01,379
往回游 没别的办法
We got to go back down. There's no other way now.

591
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:02,434
什么 -什么
What? - What?

592
00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:05,304
听好了 这个洞穴通往大海
Listen, this cave goes out to the sea.

593
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,276
一路下去能进入大海
If we follow it, we'll come out in the ocean.

594
00:59:07,937 --> 00:59:10,949
会有强大的水流 把我们吸下去
There'll be strong currents there that are going to try and suck us down.

595
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:12,695
所以我们必须靠拢
So we're going to have to keep together.

596
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,606
不行 会死在下面的
No. We're going to die down there.

597
00:59:13,686 --> 00:59:15,372
留在这里也是死路
If we stay here, we'll die.

598
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:17,774
我们要相互照应
We're going to watch each other's backs.

599
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,331
这样才能活
And we can survive this.

600
00:59:20,253 --> 00:59:22,053
姑娘们 我相信你们
Okay? Girls, I believe in you.

601
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:30,672
爸
Dad!

602
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:32,646
爸 爸
Dad! Dad!

604
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:39,425
不
No!

605
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:41,603
米娅 回来 米娅 回来
Mia, get back! Mia, get back!

606
00:59:41,718 --> 00:59:43,253
拉响警报
Sound the alarm!

607
00:59:47,132 --> 00:59:48,053
它们走了吗
Are they gone?

608
00:59:52,995 --> 00:59:55,550
走了吗 能看见鲨鱼吗
Are they gone? Can you see it?

609
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:57,491
我看不到
I don't see it. I don't see it.

610
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,426
现在怎么办
What are we going to do?

611
01:00:07,177 --> 01:00:08,363
就按他说的做
We have to do what he said.

612
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,345
不 -我们得下潜返回
No! - Yes, we have to go back down.

613
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:14,356
我做不到 我做不到
I can't. I can't do this. I can't. I can't.

614
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,640
米娅 我们必须得走 按他说的
Mia, we have to go. We have to do what he said.

615
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:17,512
我们必须潜回
We have to go back down.

616
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,356
他不希望你现在放弃 好吗
He wouldn't want you to give up now, okay?

617
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,548
氧气够不够
Do we even have enough air?

618
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:24,964
没别的选择了
We have no choice.

619
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:26,940
万一错了呢
What if we're wrong?

620
01:00:27,133 --> 01:00:30,409
万一鲨鱼不怕警报声呢
What if the alarm has nothing to do with why the sharks are gone?

621
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:31,517
怎么样也得试试
We got to try.

622
01:00:35,209 --> 01:00:36,131
准备?
You ready?

623
01:01:57,736 --> 01:01:59,700
看不见鲨鱼 哪儿去了
I can't see them. Where did they go?

624
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:02,855
等等 有水流
Wait. Current!

625
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,640
萨莎 把手给我
Sasha! Give me your hand!

626
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,251
不
No!

627
01:02:43,684 --> 01:02:44,655

628
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,741

629
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:48,792
手给我 来 我抓到你了
Give me your hand! Come on, I got you.

630
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:50,117

Help!

631
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,497
来 我抓到你了 快
Come on, I got you. Come on.

632
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:01,970
我坚持不了
I can't hold on!

633
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:03,578
水流太强了
The current is too strong!

634
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:06,161
坚持 把手给我
Come on! Hold on! Give me your hand!

635
01:03:06,277 --> 01:03:08,366
我坚持不了了 -米娅 救命 我在往下
I can't hold on! - Mia, help! I'm falling!

636
01:03:13,424 --> 01:03:15,144
米娅 我滑了
Mia! I'm slipping!

637
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,864
稳住 萨莎 快
Hold on, Sasha, come on.

638
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:28,205
不 不
No! No!

639
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:29,126

01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:36,536

Sasha!

643
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:48,895
萨莎
Sasha!

644
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:08,058
不 萨莎
No! Sasha!

645
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:11,917
米娅 米娅 她死了 没办法了
Mia! Mia, she's dead. There's nothing you can do.

646
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,494
不 这不一定
No, you don't know that.

647
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:14,559
米娅 看着我
Mia, look at me.

648
01:04:15,332 --> 01:04:16,644
我要去
I'm going.

649
01:04:16,864 --> 01:04:18,015
米娅 看着我
Mia, look at me.

650
01:04:18,477 --> 01:04:21,365
我们得继续 否则会死在这里
We have to keep going, or we are going to die down here.

651
01:04:21,687 --> 01:04:23,062
你懂我意思吗
Do you understand me?

652
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:24,370
不
No!

653
01:04:31,509 --> 01:04:34,033
看那边
Look. Over there.

654
01:04:34,656 --> 01:04:35,701
是出路
That's the way out.

655
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:38,954
水流会下拖我们
The current is going to drag us down.

656
01:04:43,709 --> 01:04:45,855
我们沿着边就没事
We'll be okay if we stick to the side.

657
01:04:46,209 --> 01:04:48,128
这是我们唯一的机会
It's our only chance. Okay?

658
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,980
我不会放开你的
Okay? I won't leave you.

659
01:04:50,229 --> 01:04:52,068
抓住我的手 走
Grab my hand. Let's go.

660
01:05:32,203 --> 01:05:33,224
你怎么样
You okay?

661
01:05:49,882 --> 01:05:50,804
继续爬
Keep moving.

662
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:55,408
快到了
Almost there.

663
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:59,159
米娅 手给我
Mia! Give me your hand!

664
01:05:59,274 --> 01:06:00,879
雅丽莎 -手给我
Alexa! - Give me your hand!

665
01:06:00,995 --> 01:06:02,854
我来了 我来了
I'm coming. I'm coming.

666
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:05,039
抓住我的手 抓住
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

667
01:06:08,133 --> 01:06:10,009
我抓住你了
I got you! I got you!

668
01:06:16,725 --> 01:06:17,647
你还好吧
Are you okay?

669
01:06:38,569 --> 01:06:40,471
米娅 这是出路
Mia, this has to be the way out.

670
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:41,624
快到了
We're almost there.

671
01:06:42,681 --> 01:06:44,116
出口不太远了
The exit can't be far.

672
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:48,772
雅丽莎
Alexa!

673
01:08:01,517 --> 01:08:03,006
我的天 你还活着
Oh, my God, you're alive!

674
01:08:05,184 --> 01:08:06,407
你还活着
You're alive!

675
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:07,775
我们被困住了 米娅
We're trapped, Mia!

676
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,836
米娅 我们会死的 没路了
Mia, we're going to die. There's no way out.

677
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:18,424
抱歉 我很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

678
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,257
别说了
Don't be.

679
01:08:19,372 --> 01:08:22,893
不 是我的错 是我害你来的
No, no! it's my fault. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be here.

680
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:25,313
不要说了 好吗
Stop! You stop it, okay?

681
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:28,812
现在还不能放弃
We can't give up now.

682
01:08:30,076 --> 01:08:33,183
我们可以轮流吸氧 我氧气比你多一点
We can share air. I have a little more than you.

683
01:08:34,024 --> 01:08:35,247
5%
Five percent.

684
01:08:35,692 --> 01:08:37,349
我们不会死在洞穴里
We're not going to die down here.

685
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,302
看 -你要去哪 米娅
Look! - Where are you going? Mia?

686
01:08:59,559 --> 01:09:00,646
萨莎 过来
Sasha, come here.

687
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,758
看 那里也许有路
Look. Maybe there's a way through.

688
01:09:08,905 --> 01:09:11,434
水流太强 会下拖我们
The current is too strong, it'll drag us down.

689
01:09:12,605 --> 01:09:13,727
得试一试
We have to try.

690
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:42,657
死路
It's a dead end.

691
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:45,441
不 不可能
No, it can't be.

692
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,424
那里 快吧
There! Come on!

693
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:14,857
貌似有阳光
I think I can see the sunlight.

694
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,202
太窄了 过不去
It's too narrow to climb through.

695
01:11:18,372 --> 01:11:19,864
还有别的路
There must be another way.

696
01:11:34,764 --> 01:11:37,969
它在绕圈 天哪 米娅
It's circling. Oh, my God! Mia!

697
01:11:38,226 --> 01:11:40,445
米娅 我被卡住了
Mia! I'm stuck!

698
01:11:43,376 --> 01:11:44,796
米娅 它来了
Mia! It's coming!

699
01:11:54,762 --> 01:11:56,679
我被卡住了 我被卡住了
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

700
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:16,459
继续 我们会成功的
Keep going. We can do it. We can make it.

701
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,223
继续 就快到了
Just keep going. We're almost there.

702
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:24,510
快点 米娅
Come on, Mia!

703
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:32,571
快 米娅 继续前进
Come on, Mia! Keep going!

704
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,856
快 米娅
Come on, Mia.

705
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:44,180
我看到光了
I see light.

706
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:54,885
快 还差一点
Come on. We're so close.

707
01:12:56,821 --> 01:12:57,871
米娅 我被卡住了
Mia, I'm stuck.

708
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,331
还差一点
We're so close.

709
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,083
我要脱掉装备
I have to take my pack off.

710
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,434
快
Come on.

711
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:25,806
屏住呼吸
Hold your breath.

712
01:13:45,885 --> 01:13:46,808
救命
Help!

713
01:13:49,268 --> 01:13:50,191
救命
Help!

714
01:14:31,023 --> 01:14:34,398
天哪 米娅 米娅
Oh, my God! Mia! Mia!

715
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:38,772
米娅 我们出来了 我们出来了
Mia! We made it! We did it!

716
01:15:00,771 --> 01:15:02,049
肯定能上去
There has to be a way up.

717
01:15:04,818 --> 01:15:06,914
也许我们可以爬上去
Maybe, maybe we could climb it.

718
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:08,922
米娅 米娅
Mia! Mia!

719
