1
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,327
Oh my God!

2
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,535
Oh my God!

3
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,875
No! No!

4
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,226
Whoo. Sure is hot out tonight.

5
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,565
Hot.

6
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,468
Hotter than nine naked women
in a Volkswagen.

7
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,708
Stinking hot.

8
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,614
Hey, Jimmy.

9
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:18,190
Can we turn up the AC?
I'm about to fry out here.

10
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,362
It seems all right to me.

11
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,396
Cheapskate.

12
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,297
Than man wouldn't know air conditioning
if it was drop kicked up his ass.

13
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,706
He ain't never turned it on in here.

14
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,364
She going to be fine.

15
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,003
She's going to be all alone.

16
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,377
Starr, we talked about this.
You said you were ready.

17
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,847
I know.

18
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,951
It was talk.

19
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:19,983
This is real.

20
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,848
Hell yeah, it's real, baby.

21
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,286
We're halfway out of town,
the car is packed.

22
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,619
We can't go back now.

23
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,052
- Stop.
- What?

24
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,357
Stop!

25
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,659
We said we were going to film this.

26
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,428
We agreed.

27
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,501
The whole trip.

28
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,299
Come on, People love this shit.

29
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,068
Not now, Billy, please.

30
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,641
Fuck it.

31
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,283
Do you want to stay
in this shithole forever?

32
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,475
Not me.

33
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,710
I'm not going to end up
like my father...

34
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,414
...working my fingers to the bone in
a fucking mill for the rest of my life.

35
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,616
I'm getting out of here.

36
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,458
If we don't leave right now, we may
never have another chance.

37
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,360
I know.

38
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,799
Give me some love.

39
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,404
How's your mama doing, Erlene?

40
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,980
Oh, I don't go by Erlene anymore.
I changed it to Starr.

41
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,776
Two "R's".

42
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,113
Oh, well, tell her I said 'hey'.

43
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,118
Hey, Noreen.

44
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,450
Pretty hot for an old broad.

45
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,921
I'm thirty two.

46
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,624
Don't mind him.
He's an asshole.

47
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,701
What'd I say?

48
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,134
What?

49
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,052
Noreen, get to work!

50
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,386
Jimmy, I have been on my feet all day.
I'm tired.

51
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,718
You know what?

52
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,416
I'm gonna fire you.

53
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,085
Haven't you fired me enough this month?

54
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,220
I'm not kidding this time, Noreen.

55
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:12,660
Right.

56
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,859
And who are you going to get
to work in this dump, huh?

57
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,368
There's plenty of girls
who want to work here.

58
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,041
Jimmy you are full of bullshit
a Christmas turkey.

59
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,238
I'm not kidding you.

60
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,902
I am not kidding you.

61
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,491
Excuse me.

62
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:50,258
You have a pay phone inside here?
The one outside is busted.

63
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,234
Yeah, there's one in the back.

64
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,934
Yeah.

65
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,281
What's the matter?

66
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,945
I've got a headache.

67
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,947
Bad?

68
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,786
I'll be all right.

69
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,822
Hey, Noreen.

70
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,722
Can I get a piece of that lemon
meringue pie?

71
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,262
Yep.

72
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,899
Yeah, I know.
No, it was a tough call.

73
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:38,542
I had to do a bit of a tap dance on
this one, but I closed the sale.

74
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,851
Okay.

75
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,907
How's it going tonight?

76
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,949
Can't complain.

77
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,313
What can I get you?

78
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,478
A cup of coffee would be great.

79
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,787
I got to warn you.
It's pretty strong.

80
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,085
Really?

81
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:20,920
How strong?

82
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,755
You could pull a pistol in it.

83
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,294
Uh, sounds good.

84
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,920
I got a long drive.

85
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,089
The kitchen's about to close...

86
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,928
...so if you want to order something
you'd better do it now.

87
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,729
Oh, no.
Thanks.

88
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,770
How about a slice of pecan pie?

89
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,999
We make the best pecan pie
this side of the Mason Dixon Line.

90
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,576
That's a bold claim, young lady.

91
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,678
Can you back that up?

92
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,712
Well you can just ask anybody
in Silver Lake.

93
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,576
Since I don't know anybody
in Silver Lake...

94
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,946
I guess I'm just going to have to take
your word for it, huh.

95
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,575
You trustworthy?

96
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,382
I swear on a stack of bibles.

97
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,627
You know, maybe later.
Just-just coffee.

98
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,160
Suit yourself.

99
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,894
You're not from around here, are you.
You just passing through?

100
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,728
Yeah.

101
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,301
Where to?

102
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,863
Oh, I'm sorry.

103
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,701
Where are you headed to?

104
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,975
New York.

105
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,342
- New York? Oh.
- Yes.

106
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,108
You live there?

107
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,682
Brooklyn.

108
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,150
God, Brooklyn.

109
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,585
I have always wanted
to see New York City.

110
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,521
And you live there.
Oh, you are so lucky.

111
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,184
You obviously have never been
to Brooklyn.

112
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,819
No, I haven't been much of nowhere.

113
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,922
Well, you should go.

114
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,100
Oh, I wish I could.
But, I don't think

115
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,262
I'll be leaving Silver Lake
any time soon.

116
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,705
- Sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

117
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,144
It's not such a bad little town,
really.

118
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,974
It used to be this big vacation
spot, you know.

119
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,242
Lots of boating and swimming.

120
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,978
People came from miles
and miles around.

121
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,451
What happened?

122
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,489
The lake dried up a few years back.

123
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,787
Nothing but a great big hole
in the ground now.

124
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,753
Let me get this straight.

125
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,333
There's not actually a lake
in Silver Lake.

126
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,563
No.

127
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,398
Wow.

128
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,870
Wow.

129
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,440
You still have that pie.

130
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,102
Yes, we do.
I'm Noreen, by the way.

131
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,838
Oh, hey, Noreen.

132
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,675
John Dixon.

133
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,715
- Nice to meet you, John.
- You too.

134
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,283
Likewise.

135
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,618
So, hey, is there a restroom?

136
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,193
- Oh, in the back, by the phones.
- Okay.

137
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:41,733
Hey, you should flush it twice.
The handle gets stuck.

138
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,664
I'll keep that in mind.

139
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,138
And that's Lord of the Ball.

140
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,609
It's 101.
Your Hip Country WTKJ FM.

141
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,580
Next up, news headlines, including
a grizzly multiple homicide

142
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,207
in Union County.

143
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,115
Plus the start of the Lincoln County
Fair this weekend...

144
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,953
and a road widening for the proposed
shopping center on 501 has hit a snag.

145
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,085
But first, WTKJ news is sponsored by...

146
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,890
- What's the matter?
- Shh. Be quiet.

147
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,261
What's wrong?

148
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,392
Some murders over in Union County.

149
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,100
Murders?

150
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:23,106
Four murders are being investigated
by the Union County Sheriff's Department.

151
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,643
The execution style slayings occurred
in the town of Aberdeen.

152
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,872
The bodies of Tom Carter,
age forty four...

153
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,448
...his wife, Lucille, age forty one...

154
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,984
...and their two children, ages six
and nine...

155
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,588
...were discovered dead in their
home this evening.

156
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,212
Gosh.
Police Chief Ronny Gayle said

157
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,654
they were shot in the head...

158
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,625
...with a twenty two caliber weapon
after being tied up

159
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,787
and wrapped in plastic.

160
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,898
Authorities are on the lookout
for a male...

161
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,967
possibly driving a late model black
pickup truck in connection

162
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,536
with the murders.
In other... local news, Union...

163
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,531
Jesus Christ.

164
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,574
What the hell is the world
coming to?

165
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,335
It's crazy.

166
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,411
This shit is just crazy.

167
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,650
Suspect, black pickup truck should
be easy to pick up.

168
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,414
What kind of person kills a child?

169
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,386
A sick bastard, that's who.

170
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,220
Something's wrong.

171
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,595
Well, let's get back to work.

172
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,851
You okay?

173
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,392
There were some murders tonight.

174
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,426
Really?

175
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,690
Yeah. A whole family.

176
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,364
Wow.

177
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,267
A husband, wife, two little kids.

178
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,601
Did you know them?

179
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:05,039
No, no, I didn't,
but little kids, you know?

180
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,473
You have kids?

181
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,672
No, no, no.

182
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,749
The Lord didn't see it fit to
bless us with any.

183
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,352
It's probably for the best, though.

184
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,956
How about you?
Is there a Mrs. John?

185
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,129
There was.

186
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,364
She... she passed away
two years ago.

187
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,067
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

188
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,074
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

189
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,580
She was... she was a good woman.

190
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,710
You know what?
I think I will have something to eat.

191
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,071
It gives me the heebie jeebies.

192
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,035
What's that?

193
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,970
There's some crazy lunatic out
there somewhere.

194
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,577
There ain't no lunatics out here.

195
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,704
How's Frank these days?

196
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,079
- Oh, he's Frank.
- Got a job yet?

197
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,778
Yeah, he's employed full time
by the television.

198
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,684
I'm sure he'll find something.

199
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,813
If he'd get off his butt.

200
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,017
You could kick his ass out.

201
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,222
I married him for better or worse.

202
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,765
This is just the worse part, I guess.

203
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,762
You could always leave him.

204
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,170
Yeah, where would I go?

205
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,706
What would I do?
I'm just some damn waitress.

206
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,642
I don't know.
You could always...

207
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,908
run away with me.

208
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,513
Now what would Bobbie Sue
have to say about that one?

209
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,782
Bobbie Sue.

210
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,414
She likes you better
than she likes me anyhow.

211
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,362
Speaking of which, I think I should
get home to the missus.

212
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,758
How much do I owe?

213
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,763
Uh, five ninety one.

214
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,959
- Is that right?
- Yeah, let me see.

215
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,997
Two twenty for the burgers,
seventy five cents for the fries...

216
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,436
A buck sixty five for the pies...

217
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:19,601
Ninety five cents for the ice tea...
That's five fifty five... plus tax.

218
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,212
Yeah, it's five ninety one.

219
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,974
Well damn, girl.

220
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,174
See you're not some dumb waitress.

221
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,046
Hell, you can count.

222
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,644
Oh great, I can count.

223
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:29,913
Well, you know that
and a nickel can get...

224
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,522
me a cup of coffee.

225
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,753
Cheer up, Noreen,
it's gonna get better.

226
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,127
I guess it can't rain forever.

227
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,861
Sorry, Mister, the kitchen's closed.

228
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,736
Where's the nearest town?

229
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,304
Silver Lake.

230
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,740
But everything's probably closed
by now.

231
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,371
Silver Lake, huh.

232
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,449
What's after that?

233
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,575
Nothing but cows
and cornfields for hours.

234
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,715
Can I interest you in a piece of pie
or a cup of coffee?

235
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,661
I'll think about that
for a little while.

236
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,506
Can I get you something?

237
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,977
Yeah, get me a... get me a steak.

238
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,558
Kitchen's closed.
Can I interest you in some pie?

239
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,060
No.

240
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,061
We got the best pecan this side
of the Mason Dixon.

241
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,722
When the fuck did I ask you for pie?

242
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,798
Give me some coffee.

243
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,565
- Sure thing.
- Can you?

244
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,110
Hey! Hey!
We got a problem out there?

245
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,914
Evidentially you can't hear.
The lady said the kitchen's closed.

246
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,021
That means I'm not making squat
for anybody.

247
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,957
If you don't like it, there's the door!

248
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:04,362
Hey Noreen... sweetie...
I should get my change... and...

249
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,970
Meet me in the back.

250
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,670
What's that?

251
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm just going to get some coffee
in the back.

252
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:44,939
Oh, uh... It's late, Hank.

253
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,478
I'm gonna hit the head
before I head out.

254
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,619
Hey. What's going on?

255
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,655
That man.

256
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,193
What man?

257
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:11,428
The one thatjust came in.
I've got a bad feeling about him.

258
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,060
Why?

259
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,736
Maybe that's him.

260
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,801
Him?

261
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,539
The one that killed that family.

262
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,842
Oh, Noreen.

263
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,245
He doesn't look like
the serial killer type to me.

264
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,948
I'm a police officer.

265
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,355
Just because you watch America's
Most Wanted every night,

266
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,859
don't make you an expert
on serial killers.

267
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:37,859
Whoa. Whoa.

268
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,930
Let's just stop right there.

269
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,589
For your information, America's Most...

270
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,497
Wanted plays a... critical part
in the apprehension

271
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,763
of many fugitives in this country.

272
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,202
It's important.

273
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,001
Lonnie...

274
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,045
- Noreen, you're justjumpy, that's all.
- I am not.

275
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:01,516
Look, even if he was the killer,
which clearly he is not...

276
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,087
He wouldn't stop in here for a
cup of coffee.

277
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,383
If he had a lick of sense,
he'd be a million miles away...

278
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,050
and he certainly wouldn't be
in this county.

279
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,129
All right.
And what if you're wrong?

280
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,692
I can'tjust go question a man
because you think he's weird.

281
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,235
You're the cop.
Go talk to him.

282
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:19,928
Talk to who?

283
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,131
Oh my God, you scared the
shit out of me!

284
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,836
Jees.
We was... we was just talking.

285
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,445
What can I get for you?

286
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,104
Some more coffee.

287
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,681
Yeah, sure.

288
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,409
He just wanted more coffee, see?

289
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,952
He wanted more coffee, that's all.

290
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,871
Sorry.

291
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,664
You okay?

292
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,860
You look like you saw a ghost.

293
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,741
Hey.

294
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,337
You all right?

295
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:40,215
That guy's got her spooked.

296
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,080
Maybe you ought to go say something.

297
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,059
Who?

298
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,820
Me?

299
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,294
You're the one with the badge.
Go do yourjob.

300
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,738
Excuse me.

301
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,107
Pardon me, mister.

302
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,222
It's probably none of my business,

303
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,892
but I was just wondering
what brings you here?

304
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,598
Here?

305
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:37,800
Oh, just our little slice of heaven here.
What brings you out this way?

306
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,174
It's none of your business.

307
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,475
Oh, well
we're a little friendly around here.

308
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,673
We just...

309
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:49,446
We like to get to know strangers.
I just want to know, that's all.

310
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,249
Is that a fact.

311
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,289
Yeah.

312
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,086
I just want to be left alone.

313
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,219
Well I can appreciate that.
I can appreciate that.

314
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,263
Where are you heading?

315
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,161
That's none of your fucking business.

316
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,202
May I remind you that you're a
talking to an officer of the law.

317
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,398
When you're asked some questions,
I'd like your name, sir.

318
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,941
Is that what you are,
an officer of the law?

319
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,009
That's right.
You want to just take it

320
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,076
down a notch, friend?

321
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,804
I'm just asking you a few questions.

322
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,415
You're more like a deputy, aren't you?

323
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,017
I am in fact a deputy.

324
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:20,617
Now listen.

325
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,481
I'm just here to ask you
a few questions.

326
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,452
That's all.
I'm not here to start any trouble.

327
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,283
Are you looking for trouble?

328
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,913
'Cause if you're looking for trouble,
I'm here.

329
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,117
I'm just looking to be left alone,
like I told you.

330
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,025
I'll leave you alone as soon as you
answer a few questions.

331
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,755
Fuck you.

332
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,831
God damn this!

333
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,957
I've had just about enough of
your mouth.

334
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,229
All right, you walk in here using
that kind of language,

335
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,599
I won't tolerate it.

336
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,038
Now, I need you to answer
some questions.

337
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,971
This conversation is over.

338
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:52,847
This conversation is not over.

339
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:57,011
God damn it, I'm an officer of the law,
you will tell me what I want to know!

340
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:00,056
Hi, mister... I'm talking to you!

341
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,055
Oh yeah?

342
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,057
How's this?
This might get your attention.

343
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,560
How's that? Huh?

344
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,666
Now you tell me right now what
you're driving.

345
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,233
Are you going to shoot me, officer?

346
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,235
I know what to do with this.
You don't worry about that.

347
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,363
You just answer my questions.

348
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,342
You know if you take that thing out,
you better be ready to use it.

349
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,946
I don't want to have
to ask you again, buddy.

350
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,975
You answer my questions right now.

351
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,550
Mister!

352
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,678
God damn it.
How's that, huh?

353
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:31,584
Lonnie.

354
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:32,382
How's that?

355
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,582
Lonnie.

356
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,593
Did I get your attention now,
huh, tough guy?

357
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,564
Did I get your attention now?
Take another step.

358
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,965
You tell me what you drive.

359
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,199
You tell me what kind
of car you're driving!

360
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,568
I'm driving a truck.

361
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,403
A truck. A truck.

362
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,942
They said it was a black truck.

363
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,740
I know. I know.

364
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,212
What color is your truck?

365
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,907
It's right out there.

366
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,110
Why don't you step
outside and see for yourself?

367
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,313
It's dark.

368
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,892
I mean, it looks black from here.

369
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,722
It's red.

370
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,490
Would you help me out here, Hank?
Huh?

371
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,430
All right.

372
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,102
It's red, so you say.

373
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,229
We'll see about that.

374
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,911
This is awesome.

375
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,655
It's red.

376
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,960
Red?

377
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:54,904
You sure?

378
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,735
Well, I'm no Martha Stewart,
but I'm pretty sure...

379
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,605
I can still tell the difference
between red and black.

380
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,974
The truck's red.

381
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,808
It's red.

382
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,880
It's red.

383
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,594
I'm sorry, mister.

384
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,030
I'm real sorry.
I mean...

385
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,793
This has been
a real bad misunderstanding.

386
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,271
You see, we're looking for a fella
in a truck.

387
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,276
It was... There was a police report
on the radio.

388
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,609
They're looking for a man in a
black truck.

389
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,550
What did this man in a black
truck do anyway?

390
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,252
He killed some folks.

391
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,194
Oh my gosh.

392
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,946
Well, I think that's about enough
excitement for one night.

393
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,712
- Check, please.
- Yeah.

394
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,518
I'll be right back.

395
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,696
I should come by here more often.

396
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,469
I didn't know you guys had late
night entertainment.

397
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,237
Are you okay?

398
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,472
- Yeah?
- I'm still shaking.

399
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,786
It's going to be okay.

400
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:28,188
I don't think he'll be coming back
here any time soon.

401
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,951
Oh my god!

402
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,735
Please.

403
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,151
Sit down.

404
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,088
Come here.

405
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,270
I want everybody's keys.

406
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,380
Your wallets, your cell phones...

407
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,475
Put them on the table
right over there.

408
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,712
Everybody.
Right now.

409
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:58,137
- You... Bring them over here.
- What?

410
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:58,765
Me?

411
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,808
Yeah.

412
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:00,535
Everything.

413
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,908
Pick it up and
bring it over here.

414
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,455
Take everything out
and put it right here.

415
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,005
Is that it?

416
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,680
You sure that's it?

417
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,116
Okay. Go back and sit down.

418
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,627
Hey!

419
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,268
Oh my god.

420
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,496
Are we having a problem over there?

421
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,764
Jesus.

422
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,672
I said.
Are we having a problem over there?

423
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,538
No. No problem.

424
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,148
Then sit the fuck down.

425
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,913
I thought you said you
gave me everything.

426
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,153
Don't fuck with me, honey.

427
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,231
Yes, sir.

428
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,938
Go back and sit down.

429
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,138
Hey.

430
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,438
Jack in the box.

431
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,840
Why don't you just walk on
over here right now?

432
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,050
That guy on the floor over there?

433
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,553
You drag him out.

434
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,690
Get it out where?

435
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,625
Wherever you want him.

436
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,924
Just do it.

437
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,128
You're crazy.
I ain't touching that thing.

438
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,859
Do what I say!

439
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,096
I'll put a fucking hole
in you right now.

440
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,377
I can't do this, mister.
I'm going to be sick.

441
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,044
Then be sick.

442
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,620
Drag him out, like I told you.

443
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:11,795
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

444
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,269
- It's going to be okay.
- We're gonna die.

445
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,169
- I'm so scared.
- Shh.

446
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,503
Don't say anything.
Don't move.

447
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,140
Oh shit.

448
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,587
Do you think he's going to kill us?

449
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,150
I don't know.

450
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,922
I'm really scared.

451
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,962
That's okay.
Me too.

452
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,059
I wish we could do something.

453
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,433
Do you live close?

454
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,663
Yeah.

455
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:48,794
Your husband.

456
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,135
Is he going to miss you,
you know.

457
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,004
Call the cops?

458
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,009
No.

459
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,020
Look, I figure he's got maybe
eight bullets in that handgun.

460
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,647
Maybe seven shells in the shotgun.

461
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,350
How do you know that?

462
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,625
Lonnie carries a 1911.

463
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,664
Standard eight rounds.

464
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,430
Are you a gun expert?

465
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,968
Sort of.

466
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,173
What are you saying?

467
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,906
I say we rush him.

468
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,404
Are you crazy?

469
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,446
No, I ain't crazy.

470
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,447
There's five of us.
There's one of him.

471
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,018
Odds are he can't shoot us all.

472
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,678
Odds are he's going to shoot
some of us.

473
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,715
He's going to kill us anyway.

474
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,489
At least if we rush him,
we got us a chance.

475
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,656
We don't know what he wants.

476
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,892
Jesus Christ.

477
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,503
I won't sit around here
to wait to find out.

478
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,629
Are you with me?

479
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,400
Why not?

480
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,605
Look, I'm a salesman.
I'm not a superhero.

481
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,013
What do you suggest we do then?

482
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,476
Wait?

483
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,815
Wait for what?
To die?

484
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,684
Fuck that.

485
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,291
Will you shut that yakking over there!

486
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,915
Mister?

487
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,383
What?

488
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,081
I know you're scared.

489
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,819
Of what?

490
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,316
It's not too late.

491
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,326
Too late for what?

492
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,029
To stop all this before it gets worse.

493
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,997
Please.

494
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,729
Please.

495
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,460
You guys just sit over there
and play dumb.

496
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,483
Whoa.

497
00:39:55,626 --> 00:40:00,495
Hey. Hey, it's me.
It's Greene.

498
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,065
You must be Mr. Smith.

499
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,065
You're the man with the gun.

500
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,466
Whoo. Boy hey...

501
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,972
Nash told me you were one cold
hearted son of a bitch, but my god...

502
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,598
I had no idea.

503
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,607
Hey, would you mind
not pointing that at me?

504
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,769
I... I don't like guns.

505
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:20,584
Hey!

506
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,515
Oh, okay.

507
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,678
Not the friendly type.

508
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:25,516
I get it.

509
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,315
You're working.

510
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,085
You're busy.
No problema.

511
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,684
Yeah. Well, since you're busy...

512
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,364
I'll get right down to business.
Is it done?

513
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,227
Is what done?

514
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,031
Yeah, the job.
Is it done?

515
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,606
What do you think?

516
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,008
Well, okay.

517
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,078
Then this, my friend, is all yours.

518
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,116
It's all there.

519
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,289
You can count it
if you don't believe me.

520
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:18,397
Yeah. So, I guess we're square.

521
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,703
Well, it's been nice doing business
with you...

522
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,473
...Mr. Smith and I doubt I'll need your
services anytime in the future.

523
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,913
But I will highly recommend you.

524
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,282
Oh, and I hate to overstate
the obvious, but uh...

525
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,581
these people have seen my face,

526
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,486
so you are going to
take care of them, right?

527
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,956
Oh yeah.

528
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,486
Okay.

529
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,892
Well, I would love to stick around
and watch you do your work...

530
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,998
but I got a date, so good night.

531
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,429
Hey!

532
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,897
Sit down.

533
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,264
Why?

534
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,201
Because I said so.

535
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,964
What for?

536
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:51,665
Sit down!

537
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,539
I don't understand where you're
coming from here, buddy.

538
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,373
Sit down!

539
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,345
Look, is this some kind of scam?
Is that it?

540
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,972
Are you wanting more money
out of me?

541
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:00,879
I got your money.

542
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,986
No, because I don't have
any more money.

543
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,714
See, I was told you were a lot
more professional than this.

544
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,984
Yeah, and I don't know what the hell
you got going on in here.

545
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,220
But you can damn well believe
that I'm calling Nash,

546
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,796
and I'm gonna tell her.

547
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,262
We got a big problem.

548
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,424
A problem?
What?

549
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,465
What problem?

550
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,932
I ain't Smith.

551
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:23,628
All right, so... you're... you're not Smith.

552
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:29,028
And, uh you're not a cop, either.

553
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,233
Well, there was a cop in his earlier,
but he's dead now.

554
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,334
'Cause I shot him.

555
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,946
Okay.

556
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:41,782
You must want something.

557
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,716
All right.
I mean, right? Am I right?

558
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,482
- Everybody wants something, right?
- Sure.

559
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,283
Okay. Okay.

560
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,085
We're getting somewhere.
We're getting somewhere.

561
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,593
So... what do you want?

562
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,356
The truth.

563
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,296
Okay. I'll tell you whatever
you want to hear.

564
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,596
Who is Smith?

565
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:01,796
- Smith.
- Yeah.

566
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:07,536
Smith. Smith. Yeah, he, uh...
I don't know.

567
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,943
You don't know,
or you're not going to tell me.

568
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,707
Which is it?

569
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,578
Could you just untie me?
Let me go.

570
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:14,877
I'll pay ya.

571
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,850
I already got your money!

572
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,318
I'll pay you more.

573
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,320
You said you didn't have any more!

574
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,448
Now you're nothing but a liar,
Mr. Greene.

575
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,685
No, no, no, no, no, no.

576
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,421
I'm not.
I'm-I'm... I'll look-what do you do...

577
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,495
I'll tell you anything you
want to hear.

578
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,361
I'll tell you...
what you want to hear.

579
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:33,927
The money in the case.
Who's is it?

580
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,732
Where did it come from?

581
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,437
It was... that was a business deal.

582
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,012
- A business deal, huh.
- Yeah.

583
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,174
What kind of business deal?

584
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,649
I don't think I can do that.

585
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,621
I think you can.

586
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,589
I can't.

587
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,485
That's the wrong answer.

588
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:09,038
Oh, no. Come on! Come on,
let's talk about this.

589
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,868
Let's talk about it.

590
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,374
I'm ready, I swear.
I'll pay you, man.

591
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,070
You know, I'm good for it.

592
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,805
Oh my god.

593
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,368
I shouldn't be here.

594
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,494
I just should not be here.

595
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,572
This is not right!

596
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,971
The stupid convention.

597
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,771
I didn't want to go in the first place
and my boss makes me.

598
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,277
Really.

599
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,115
I should have driven straight
home the hundred miles.

600
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,210
But I had to stop in this particular
diner on this particular night.

601
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,482
Just dumb luck.

602
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,020
I'm going to die
in this god forsaken diner.

603
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,025
In the middle of nowhere.

604
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,096
For nothing!

605
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,629
Jesus!

606
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,130
I'm sorry.

607
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,201
I'm so sorry.

608
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,806
I'm sorry.

609
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:52,806
Listen to me.

610
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,242
I'm sorry.

611
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,280
It's not your fault.

612
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,883
I've had bad luck my whole life.

613
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:10,226
For what it's worth,
I'm glad you did stop.

614
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:23,538
Who's Smith?

615
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,733
And where did that money come from?

616
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:33,247
I... I... I can't tell you.

617
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,782
Oh, I think you can.

618
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,977
Ask me how come I know it.

619
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,722
Say, "How do you know it?"

620
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:50,260
How do you know I'm going to tell
you the answer to the question.

621
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,891
'Cause I've seen it before.
Been there before.

622
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,801
Hundreds of times.

623
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,872
Sooner or later you're going
to say everything.

624
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,269
Everyone always does.

625
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,467
You got to ask yourself
a question though.

626
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,379
How much pain can you endure?

627
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:06,277
How much pain can you endure,
Mr. Greene?

628
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,488
I think you need a little bit
more incentive.

629
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,196
No! No! Okay!

630
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:28,827
Tell me what I want
to know now, damn it!

631
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:29,768
No, no, please.

632
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,772
No, I'll tell you!
- Now say it!

633
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,968
Okay, I'll tell you,
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

634
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,511
Don't hold anything back.

635
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,547
Okay.
I'll tell you.

636
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:39,478
Okay.

637
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,550
What do you want me... to tell you?

638
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,711
Everything. Everything.

639
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,755
Uh, where do you want me to start?

640
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,051
Well, the beginning
is always a good place.

641
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,684
- Try that.
- Okay.

642
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,967
I... I... I'm a businessman.
This is all business right?

643
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,467
- Yeah.
- I own...

644
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,803
some family land over
in Anson County.

645
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,068
A couple of hundred acres.

646
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,302
We're building a shopping mall there.
I'm donating the land...

647
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,811
the land, my partners put up the money.

648
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,917
Pretty sweet deal you know.

649
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:17,782
It's perfect.
I could start printing the money... now.

650
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,481
I just needed to sell one
more piece of land.

651
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:27,228
One more big chunk of land right
where the parking lot needed to be.

652
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,355
But the owner,

653
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,598
he decided he didn't want to sell.

654
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:39,971
So I offered him double,
triple what it was worth.

655
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,404
He still said no.

656
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,478
He wanted to be a farmer.

657
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,549
You know, cows, chickens and shit.

658
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:51,450
I mean, who the hell wants to be
a farmer anymore?

659
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:57,857
Anyway... without that land,
I'm screwed.

660
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,425
The deal is stalled.

661
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,459
And I can't tell my partners,

662
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,263
'cause they'll kill me.

663
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:11,966
The guys are loan sharks.
They're screaming for money.

664
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,872
And when they get sick
of screaming for money,

665
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,809
they start asking for fingers... and toes.

666
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:21,816
Look, I'm just a businessman.
I made a business choice.

667
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,750
I had to do something fast,
so I called an associate.

668
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,822
He put me in touch with a name.

669
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,891
Mr. Smith.

670
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,891
Smith.

671
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,957
Who is this Smith anyway?

672
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,655
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

673
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,390
I don't know.

674
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,625
I don't even have a number.

675
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,963
He calls me.

676
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,195
What's he look like?

677
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:41,929
I don't know.

678
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,232
How the fuck should I know?

679
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,364
I talk to him on the phone.

680
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,067
This Smith.

681
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,842
What exactly is
he going to do for you?

682
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:58,251
He's going to persuade
the farmer to sell his land.

683
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,082
How's he going to do that?

684
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:11,332
I... I... don't know.
I don't know his operation.

685
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,929
You don't know?

686
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:15,728
What did he do to the farmer?

687
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,533
What-what does it matter anyway?

688
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,768
Nothing to me, buddy.
What did he do to the farmer?

689
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,377
He killed the farmer.

690
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,751
What else?

691
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,319
His wife.

692
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,757
Is that it?

693
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,329
His kids.

694
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,809
There's no heirs.

695
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:08,315
The land goes to the bank.
And I get a better deal.

696
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,468
That's the way hit went, huh?

697
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,305
Yeah.

698
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,007
You have no idea
what's going to happen to you next,

699
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,306
but you got it coming.

700
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,642
Wait!

701
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:39,119
What are you going to do?
Hey, what are you going to do?

702
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:44,956
No! please... please don't shoot...

703
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,211
What?

704
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,585
We got a big quandary here.

705
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,351
What are you talking about?

706
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,087
I'm talking about that bag of money
on the counter over there.

707
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:24,565
- So what?
- So what? That belongs to Smith.

708
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,497
What do you mean?

709
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,503
That means one of you is Smith.

710
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,372
One of us?

711
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:36,010
He got here before I did.
That means it's one of you.

712
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,977
You god dammed idiot.

713
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,173
Do I look like a professional
killer to you?

714
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,683
I don't know.
Maybe you are.

715
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,421
You fucking nutbag.

716
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,716
How about you?
You a killer?

717
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:51,088
Yeah, if you count the wildlife
I've run over with my car.

718
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,254
How can you be so sure?
Maybe he never showed up.

719
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,797
Nobody's going to leave a bag
of money like that behind okay?

720
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,161
Nobody.

721
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,097
How about these two?

722
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,930
How about you, college boy?

723
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,269
I'm no killer.

724
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,967
I'm an artist.

725
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,006
I ought to gun you first.

726
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,643
Why don't you decide for me?

727
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:17,775
I got a couple of maybes here.

728
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,411
Maybe?

729
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,046
Maybe.

730
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,718
Which one is the man.
Who's Smith?

731
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:26,726
Neither.

732
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,694
How do you know?

733
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,723
Hank's in here a couple
of times a month.

734
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,334
It can't be him.

735
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,336
A couple of times a month, huh.
And because of that you think

736
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,372
you know him that well.

737
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,610
Not that well, but he's not a killer.

738
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,714
How about him?

739
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,245
He isn't either.

740
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,682
What if I make you guess?

741
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:53,983
What if I give you
three seconds on the clock?

742
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,853
I can't.

743
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,654
Who is it?

744
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,960
- I can't.
- Three.

745
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,089
- I can't!
- Two.

746
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,667
- Please.
- One.

747
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,996
Oh my god.

748
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:12,006
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

749
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,607
I'll talk.

750
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,414
I'll talk to you.

751
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,544
Hell, no.
He volunteered. Take him.

752
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,681
I don't care what he did.
I want to talk to you first.

753
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:32,758
Let's go.

754
00:56:58,715 --> 00:56:59,909
I just want to go home.

755
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:04,076
I know. I know. Shh.

756
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,224
Okay. Okay.

757
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,525
It's going to be okay,
I promise.

758
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:40,488
- Look.
- What?

759
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,790
He made a mistake.
He didn't handcuff him.

760
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,353
So?

761
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:56,035
So he's getting sloppy.
I have an idea.

762
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,032
I have to get his gun.

763
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,333
How are you going to do that?

764
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,378
I got to get close to him.

765
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:04,741
I don't understand.

766
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,543
Look, you see what's going on, right?

767
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,447
He's going to kill that hillbilly
and he's going to put me

768
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:10,678
in that chair next.

769
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,344
What for?

770
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,424
So I need you to distract him.

771
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,356
Get him to turn his back,
just for a second. Okay?

772
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,554
How am I going to do that?

773
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,289
Okay. When I come get you,
I want you to scream

774
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,491
as loud as you can, okay?

775
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:25,965
Get him to turn his back.

776
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,434
Then I'm going to go for the gun.

777
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,232
Can you do that?

778
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,612
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

779
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:41,111
Good.

780
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,183
You might as well hold your breath.
I ain't no killer.

781
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,061
Says you.

782
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,228
So how is this going to go?

783
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,670
I'm going to ask you questions.
And then you can answer me.

784
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,096
Questions about what?

785
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,468
Questions about you.

786
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,473
Ain't nothing special about me.

787
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,544
Everybody's special.

788
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:15,007
Each and every one of us
is a beautiful, unique snowflake.

789
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,178
That is the stupidest shit I ever heard.

790
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,084
You saying I'm stupid?

791
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,222
Are you saying I'm stupid?
Is that it?

792
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,352
No sir.

793
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:28,159
You're a soldier, aren't you?

794
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:29,654
I was.

795
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,528
You see any action?

796
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:33,732
Gulf War.

797
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,770
Desert Shield.

798
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,338
I was in the shit.

799
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,407
What were you?

800
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,537
Gun bunny.

801
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,601
Pretty good view of the action.

802
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,873
The action I saw was a bit different.

803
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,607
What was that, sir?

804
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,241
Well, you can say that I was kind
of a people person.

805
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:51,216
What about Iraq?

806
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,254
Did you make it over there?

807
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,414
Got out before that cluster.

808
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:56,823
Good for you.

809
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,757
What do you do now?

810
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,863
I drive a truck.

811
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,828
You married?

812
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,194
Yes sir.

813
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,699
How long?

814
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,462
Eleven years.

815
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,595
Eleven years married.

816
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,708
What's your wife's name?

817
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,173
Her name is Mabel.

818
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,040
Mabel.

819
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,341
What a sweet name.

820
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,615
She must be a good woman.

821
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:23,741
The best.

822
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:25,319
The best.

823
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,719
Do you love her?

824
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,420
What?

825
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,961
I say, do you love her, soldier boy?

826
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,257
Of course I love her.

827
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,797
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

828
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,491
I told you I did.

829
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,727
You're a liar!

830
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,770
Look, Mister, I don't appreciate you
calling me a goddamned liar.

831
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,668
You ain't lying?

832
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,607
What's that?

833
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,881
What is that?

834
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,886
It's your wallet, right?

835
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,026
What are you doing with that in there?

836
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,361
Carrying around someone else's condom.
Is that it?

837
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:20,533
Does it belong to somebody else?
Is it yours or not?

838
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,443
Yes.

839
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,437
Well all right.

840
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,475
What do you do with that damn thing?

841
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,377
You having sex with other people
besides Mabel?

842
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,218
You got what you want.
Can I go now?

843
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:37,316
Hell no, you can't go.

844
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,119
Why?

845
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,354
I done told you
everything you want.

846
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,589
'Cause I'm not through with you yet!

847
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,459
I want to know who these people are.
That you've been having sex with.

848
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,095
Other than your wife of eleven years.

849
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,465
This shit ain't none of your business.

850
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,509
I'm making it my business.

851
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,046
I'm done talking.

852
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:18,193
Who is it?
Huh? Who is it?

853
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,902
I don't know.
I don't know.

854
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,338
You don't know
or you're not going to say.

855
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:27,966
Which is it?

856
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,475
I don't know their names.

857
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,978
There's more than one, huh?

858
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,675
Who are they?
Prostitutes?

859
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,346
Some.

860
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,250
Where do you meet them?

861
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,420
Truck stops.

862
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,427
Gas stations.
Bathrooms mostly.

863
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,428
You having sex with men?

864
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,864
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Why?

865
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,028
Because I like it!

866
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,867
Exciting, huh?

867
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,737
- Yeah.
- Better than with your wife, huh?

868
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,639
Yeah.

869
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,908
Are you Smith?

870
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,852
Look, I'll be anybody
you want me to be.

871
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,582
Just don't shoot me again.

872
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,817
Please don't shoot me again.

873
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,061
Are you Smith?

874
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,187
Yeah. Yes, I'm Smith.

875
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,629
- You ain't Smith.
- No!

876
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,518
You killed an innocent man.

877
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:29,927
That's the trouble with
aggressive interrogation methods.

878
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:35,000
Sometimes you only end up hearing
what you want instead of the truth.

879
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,071
He didn't deserve to die.

880
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,232
That's debatable.
He did serve a purpose.

881
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,866
As far as I'm concerned.

882
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:46,011
His purpose?
What was that?

883
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,875
Why are you doing this?

884
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:54,551
Is this some kind of game to you?
Playing with people's lives like this?

885
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:59,785
You got to separate the wheat
from the chaff.

886
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,228
What the hell does that mean?

887
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,526
I read it in a book somewhere.

888
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,363
For people who don't understand
the situation that they're in.

889
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,835
And what is my situation?

890
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,572
You're a good person.

891
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,508
You're just at the wrong place

892
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,277
at the wrong time, basically.

893
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,079
You could change it.

894
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,626
No, I can't.

895
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,829
You have the power to change it.

896
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,765
No. Can't do it.

897
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,796
You can.

898
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:49,133
Please do the right thing,
and just walk away, right now.

899
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,007
I've got a job.

900
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,078
It's a job I'm going to finish.

901
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,342
That's the way it is.

902
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,281
A job?

903
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,185
A job?

904
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:05,460
You call torturing
and killing people a job?

905
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,830
Why are you doing this?

906
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,134
What difference does it make?

907
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,837
It does.
It helps to know.

908
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,502
Listen.
If you want to know the truth,

909
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,745
I'm telling you honey.
I just came in here

910
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,940
to get something to eat.

911
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,842
Yeah.

912
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,151
Then what happened
all hell broke loose.

913
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,087
That's what happened.
That's the way it is.

914
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,561
What am I going to do now?
I can't turn back.

915
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,360
You, John.
Get up.

916
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,027
No.

917
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,031
- Get up.
- It's not him.

918
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,505
Get the fuck out of that booth.

919
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,337
Hey, it's okay.

920
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,578
Get up.

921
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:04,249
Over there.
Sit down.

922
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,854
Come on, get up.

923
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,855
Go ahead.

924
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,995
Stop right there.

925
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,568
I'm not taking any chances with you.

926
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,092
Baby.

927
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,296
I'm going to die.

928
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:54,733
Don't say that.

929
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,861
We're going to fucking die.

930
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,465
We're going to die.

931
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,389
Get up.

932
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,568
Are you Smith?

933
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,206
I am not Smith.

934
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,312
My name is Dixon.

935
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,437
Dixon.

936
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,407
Sure you are.

937
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,108
Listen.

938
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:45,186
I'm in sales.

939
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,118
Really, I'm in sales.

940
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,349
- Sales.
- Yeah.

941
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,460
I'm mean really, seriously.
Come on.

942
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,027
Do I look like a killer to you?

943
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:54,993
I mean, do I?

944
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,530
What makes you think I'm a killer?

945
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:57,689
Huh?

946
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,893
You're the only one left.
It ain't her, that's for sure.

947
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,971
Please. Please, I am not Smith.

948
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:06,700
If you're not Smith,
you're no good to me.

949
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,605
Please, Mister, stop!

950
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:11,440
Can't you see
he doesn't know anything!

951
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,218
Wait.

952
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,193
Sorry.

953
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,663
Are you Smith or not?

954
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,107
You know, I can tell you
I'm the Easter Bunny.

955
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,811
But it wouldn't mean shit.

956
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,872
But you're Smith.

957
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,645
Yes. I am Smith.

958
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:55,316
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Yes we are.

959
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,452
You kill that whole family?

960
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:59,561
Yes.

961
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:08,632
- Professional killer?
- Independent contractor.

962
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,102
Who do you work for?

963
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,230
Not your business.

964
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,604
I can make it my business.
And I can make you tell me.

965
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,210
I don't think so.

966
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,142
I'm very good at my job.

967
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,874
I'm sure you are.

968
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,677
It doesn't matter.

969
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,843
I can tell you that.

970
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,547
Certainly by now you know
I'm trained to do this.

971
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,022
Yeah, you were
talking about it all night.

972
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,456
Ex-military, right.

973
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:32,526
Yeah.

974
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,526
- You're an interrogator, right?
- Yeah.

975
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,221
I know your type.

976
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,265
Professional.

977
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,368
Sadistic fuck.

978
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,029
Yeah.

979
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:45,629
And you work for the government, right?

980
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:47,173
It fucking figures.

981
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:51,268
Human resource exploitation.
Scored real high on that one.

982
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:54,940
Yeah. Sick mind for a sick job.

983
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,746
That's what the government said right
before they shit canned me.

984
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,547
They dumped you.

985
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,986
Personality disorders.

986
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,952
Said I was mentally unfit for service.

987
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,858
Fifteen years
of doing their dirty work.

988
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:11,160
And that brass just hung me out
to twist in the wind.

989
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,392
Too bad.

990
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,593
Had two fucking years in prison,
that's what happened to me.

991
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,399
No gold watches, pension plans.

992
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,804
Fuck all I got.

993
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,201
That's a fucking shame.

994
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:28,981
Sorry to disappoint you, you know.
But... still not going to tell you

995
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,745
what you want to know.

996
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,353
I can make you tell me anything
I want.

997
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,217
I'm very good at what I do.

998
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,017
You know what I think?

999
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,126
I think you'll get tired of trying.

1000
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,285
Then you'll just kill me, so

1001
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,863
let's just cut
the bullshit all right?

1002
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,590
I'll tell you this.

1003
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,428
People I work for?

1004
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,663
Family.

1005
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,068
Very powerful family.

1006
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,072
With connections everywhere.

1007
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:58,578
Kill me and you open up a whole
world of shit, my friend.

1008
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,705
You and I... we're very much alike,
you know that?

1009
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:04,979
No sir disappoint you again,
but you and I are nothing alike.

1010
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,747
I kill for money.

1011
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,720
It's a job.
Nothing more.

1012
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:09,585
Nothing less.

1013
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:13,957
You kill because, you know...
you're looney tunes.

1014
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,292
Look, you're gonna kill me, right?

1015
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:18,866
Let's just get on with it.

1016
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,970
Really, I can't take much more
of this talking.

1017
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,071
You're not afraid to die.

1018
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,968
No. I'm not.

1019
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,507
I am afraid you're gonna
keep talking, though.

1020
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,472
What?
Something wrong?

1021
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,417
If I take... If I don't kill you,
you'll take the money.

1022
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:38,611
Then what's going to happen?

1023
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:41,245
People are going to hunt me down
and kill me.

1024
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,982
If I don't kill you,
I take the money

1025
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,353
and you're going to come
after me, right?

1026
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:45,687
Yeah.

1027
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,591
That sounds about right.

1028
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:48,758
You know what?

1029
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:52,298
You could, you could
just give me the money.

1030
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:53,833
And go.

1031
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:55,561
And you'd forget all about me?

1032
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,137
No.

1033
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,433
But you'd have a big head start.

1034
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:04,444
It's a big country.
I might never find you.

1035
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:08,206
How about splitting the money.
Why don't we split it?

1036
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:11,210
- Honestly.
- Yeah.

1037
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,844
I'd still hunt you down and kill you.

1038
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,718
Why not cut your losses
and take half the money,

1039
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,849
and then you'll live to spend it.

1040
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,784
'Cause I'd only be half happy.

1041
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,160
But you'd have your health.

1042
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:30,835
You know... I don't expect you
to understand this cause...

1043
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,907
you know, you're a homicidal
lunatic...

1044
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,566
But it's the principal of the thing.

1045
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:36,769
I did a job.

1046
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,277
I earned my money.

1047
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,814
I expect to get paid.

1048
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,814
All of it.

1049
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,010
It's a tough choice.

1050
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:50,614
Yeah, it's a pickle.
I do not envy you.

1051
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,520
What would you do?
If you were me?

1052
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:57,932
- What? If I were in your position?
- Yeah. What would you do?

1053
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,335
I wouldn't be in your position.

1054
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,201
Not that your position
is so much better.

1055
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,035
I guess it's a matter of opinion.

1056
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,973
Is that what you think?

1057
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,976
You know what I'm thinking?

1058
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,811
I'm going to tell you something.

1059
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,474
Here's what I'm thinking.

1060
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,446
I'm thinking you're
having a very bad day.

1061
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:22,216
In what's probably a very bad life.

1062
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,222
You walk in here
and get your ass handed to you

1063
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,485
by Barney fucking Fife...

1064
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,994
And then you know, you snap.
You start killing people.

1065
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:29,597
Why?

1066
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:30,789
I don't know.

1067
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,026
I'm not a psychiatrist.

1068
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:37,127
But, you're in too deep now.

1069
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,239
You're in over your head.

1070
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,809
You're screwed and you know it,
so you're thinking about the money.

1071
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:43,775
Maybe I can take the money
and go to Mexico.

1072
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,812
Leave all this behind me, you know.

1073
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:48,917
Live on the beach, sip tequila shots,
and watch the sun set.

1074
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:53,954
But the truth of the matter is,
your troubles are just beginning.

1075
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,520
You can kill me.

1076
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,588
But my people
are like a fucking Hydra.

1077
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,628
You cut one head
& two more will pop up.

1078
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,196
You will never stop running.

1079
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:05,790
You will never hide.

1080
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:07,424
They will find you.

1081
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:13,633
And they will slowly
but surely kill you.

1082
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,336
I mean, that's what I think.

1083
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,445
I calls them likes I sees them.

1084
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,478
I can't have you talking to the cops.

1085
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,482
Or talking to your friends.

1086
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,252
Kill everybody.

1087
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,550
Nobody will know I was ever here.

1088
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,775
I thought you called
yourself a professional.

1089
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,980
You're a fucking amateur.

1090
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:43,315
You okay?

1091
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:45,492
Yeah.

1092
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,662
Thank God.

1093
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,694
I killed him.

1094
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:58,101
You didn't have a choice.

1095
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,806
Is he really dead?

1096
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,183
Yeah.

1097
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,187
I can't believe I killed him.

1098
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,187
It was him or you.

1099
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,786
It's okay.

1100
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:26,361
Hey. These are starting to hurt.

1101
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:32,334
You going to unlock them?
Keys are over there.

1102
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,653
You got that key?

1103
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:01,665
No.

1104
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,429
What?

1105
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,008
I can't.

1106
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:11,509
You can't what?

1107
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,911
I can't let you go.

1108
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,478
Noreen.

1109
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:20,052
I know who you are.

1110
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:24,488
I'd never hurt you.

1111
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,651
I promise.

1112
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,355
You're going to kill me
the first chance you get.

1113
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,197
All right.

1114
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,239
Okay.

1115
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,274
Okay, so don't help me.

1116
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:44,207
What are you
going to do... turn me in?

1117
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:46,746
Make a citizen's arrest?

1118
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,577
Yes.

1119
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,151
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1120
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,086
Why not?

1121
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,847
You think the cops can protect you?

1122
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:00,251
You will never be safe.

1123
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,827
Don't move.

1124
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:08,865
I'm not going to jail.

1125
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,130
Hold it! Right there!

1126
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,401
What?
You're going to shoot me?

1127
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:19,844
Don't make me.

1128
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,608
I don't think you will.

1129
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,274
Oh, I will.

1130
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:25,879
I don't believe you.

1131
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,778
And how do you know?

1132
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,187
Mostly because of the way
you're holding that gun.

1133
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,021
I will. I swear it.

1134
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:36,062
I don't think you have it
in you, Noreen.

1135
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,931
To intentionally kill another person?

1136
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,466
A human being?

1137
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:45,198
You're not the kind of person
who stands up for herself.

1138
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,705
You know.

1139
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:50,141
You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.

1140
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:53,372
Well, I know enough about you.

1141
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,415
I know you've been stuck
in this dead end marriage,

1142
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,417
what... five or ten years...
and you don't have the guts to leave.

1143
01:20:58,553 --> 01:20:59,884
Shut up.

1144
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:03,115
Right? And you've been working
in this god forsaken place...

1145
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:07,888
for I don't know how long,
serving rednecks, making slave wages.

1146
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,088
No job satisfaction.

1147
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,925
Retirement?
And you still

1148
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,060
don't have the guts to go, do you?

1149
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,672
Shut up!

1150
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:23,608
So no, I don't think you have
the guts to pull the trigger.

1151
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,303
Stop.

1152
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:30,315
I will shoot you

1153
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:32,681
Put the gun down, Noreen.

1154
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,755
Don't come any closer.

1155
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,687
Put the gun down.

1156
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:40,659
- I will shoot!
- Goddammit, put the gun down, Noreen!

1157
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:47,735
Stop!

1158
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:50,537
Stop.

1159
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:51,639
Stop.

1160
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:52,364
I mean it.

1161
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,498
No, I mean it, really.

1162
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,668
Shut up.

1163
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,607
You know what?

1164
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:06,084
I don't actually think you have
any bullets in that thing.

1165
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,620
What?

1166
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:11,691
I mean, I think you're holding
an empty gun.

1167
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:13,418
No, I'm not.

1168
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,458
Okay, let's see.

1169
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,896
Let's think about it, okay?
You and me, we'll just think about it.

1170
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,434
How many shots were fired?
Seven?

1171
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,798
Eight?

1172
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,136
Wow, I don't know...
in all the confusion,

1173
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,741
I kind of lost count.

1174
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:28,672
And I'm a professional.

1175
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,608
You're just a fucking,
stupid waitress!

1176
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,908
You know what?

1177
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:35,448
You know what?

1178
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:40,646
You're right.
I am just a stupid waitress.

1179
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:45,852
I have a crappy, pathetic life.

1180
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:50,795
I'm terrified of change.
I stay when I should go.

1181
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,433
I'm not very smart.

1182
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:59,937
And I'll probably
never be truly happy.

1183
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:04,703
But I know one thing that you don't.

1184
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:05,835
Oh yeah?

1185
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,846
What's that?

1186
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,318
I can count.

1187
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,255
Huh?

1188
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,086
One for the tall man.

1189
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,196
Two for Hank.

1190
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,791
Three for the kids.

1191
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,428
One for the ceiling.

1192
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,731
Seven bullets.

1193
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,307
And there's one for you.
