1
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:32,327
Oh my God!

2
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:42,535
Oh my God!

3
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,875
No! No!

4
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:55,226
Whoo. Sure is hot out tonight.

5
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:58,565
Hot.

6
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:02,468
Hotter than nine naked women
in a Volkswagen.

7
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:12,708
Stinking hot.

8
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,614
Hey, Jimmy.

9
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:19,190
Can we turn up the AC?
I'm about to fry out here.

10
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,362
It seems all right to me.

11
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,396
Cheapskate.

12
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:37,297
Than man wouldn't know air conditioning
if it was drop kicked up his ass.

13
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:39,706
He ain't never turned it on in here.

14
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,364
She going to be fine.

15
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:13,003
She's going to be all alone.

16
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:17,377
Starr, we talked about this.
You said you were ready.

17
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,847
I know.

18
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:19,951
It was talk.

19
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:20,983
This is real.

20
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,848
Hell yeah, it's real, baby.

21
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,286
We're halfway out of town,
the car is packed.

22
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,619
We can't go back now.

23
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,052
- Stop.
- What?

24
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,357
Stop!

25
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:35,659
We said we were going to film this.

26
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,428
We agreed.

27
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:38,501
The whole trip.

28
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,299
Come on, People love this shit.

29
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,068
Not now, Billy, please.

30
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,641
Fuck it.

31
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:52,283
Do you want to stay
in this shithole forever?

32
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,475
Not me.

33
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:54,710
I'm not going to end up
like my father...

34
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:58,414
...working my fingers to the bone in
a fucking mill for the rest of my life.

35
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,616
I'm getting out of here.

36
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,458
If we don't leave right now, we may
never have another chance.

37
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,360
I know.

38
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,799
Give me some love.

39
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,404
How's your mama doing, Erlene?

40
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:22,980
Oh, I don't go by Erlene anymore.
I changed it to Starr.

41
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,776
Two "R's".

42
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,113
Oh, well, tell her I said 'hey'.

43
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,118
Hey, Noreen.

44
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,450
Pretty hot for an old broad.

45
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,921
I'm thirty two.

46
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,624
Don't mind him.
He's an asshole.

47
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:45,701
What'd I say?

48
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,134
What?

49
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:01,052
Noreen, get to work!

50
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:05,386
Jimmy, I have been on my feet all day.
I'm tired.

51
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,718
You know what?

52
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,416
I'm gonna fire you.

53
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,085
Haven't you fired me enough this month?

54
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,220
I'm not kidding this time, Noreen.

55
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,859
Right, and who are you gonna get
to work in this dump, huh?

56
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,068
There's plenty of girls
who wanna work here.

57
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:24,041
Jimmy you are full of bullshit
a Christmas turkey.

58
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,338
I'm not kidding you.

59
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:27,902
I am not kidding you.

60
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,491
Excuse me.

61
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:51,258
You have a pay phone inside here?
The one outside is busted.

62
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,234
Yeah, there's one in the back.

63
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,934
Yeah.

64
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,281
What's the matter?

65
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,945
I've got a headache.

66
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:12,947
Bad?

67
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,786
I'll be all right.

68
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,822
Hey, Noreen.

69
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,722
Can I get a piece of that lemon
meringue pie?

70
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:31,399
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
No, it was a tough call.

71
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:39,542
I had to do a bit of a tap dance
on this one, but I closed the sale.

72
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:41,851
Okay.

73
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,907
How's it going tonight?

74
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:13,949
Can't complain.

75
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,313
What can I get you?

76
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,478
A cup of coffee would be great.

77
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,787
I got to warn you.
It's pretty strong.

78
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,085
Really?

79
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,755
- How strong?
- You could pull a pistol in it.

80
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,294
Uh, sounds good.

81
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,920
I got a long drive.

82
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:28,089
The kitchen's about to close...

83
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,928
...so if you want to order something
you'd better do it now.

84
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,729
Oh, no.
Thanks.

85
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,770
How about a slice of pecan pie?

86
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,999
We make the best pecan pie
this side of the Mason Dixon Line.

87
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:39,576
That's a bold claim, young lady.

88
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:40,678
Can you back that up?

89
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,712
Well you can just ask anybody
in Silver Lake.

90
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,576
Since I don't know anybody
in Silver Lake...

91
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,946
I guess I'm just gonna have to take
your word for it, huh.

92
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,575
You trustworthy?

93
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,382
I swear on a stack of bibles.

94
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:56,627
You know, maybe later.
Just... just coffee.

95
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,160
Suit yourself.

96
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,894
You're not from around here, are you.
You just passing through?

97
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,728
Yeah.

98
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,301
Where to?

99
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,863
Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,701
Where are you headed to?

101
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:11,975
New York.

102
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,342
- New York? Oh.
- Yes.

103
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:18,108
You live there?

104
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:19,682
Brooklyn.

105
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,150
God, Brooklyn.

106
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,585
I have always wanted
to see New York City.

107
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,521
And you live there.
Oh, you are so lucky.

108
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,184
You obviously have never been
to Brooklyn.

109
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:32,819
No, I haven't been much of nowhere.

110
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,922
Well, you should go.

111
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,100
Oh, I wish I could.
But, I don't think

112
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,262
I'll be leaving Silver Lake
any time soon.

113
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:44,705
- Sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

114
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,144
It's not such a bad little town,
really.

115
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,974
It used to be this big vacation
spot, you know.

116
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,242
Lots of boating and swimming.

117
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,978
People came from miles
and miles around.

118
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,451
What happened?

119
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:59,489
The lake dried up a few years back.

120
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:02,787
Nothing but a great big hole
in the ground now.

121
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:05,753
Let me get this straight.

122
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:09,333
There's not actually a lake
in Silver Lake.

123
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,563
No.

124
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:13,398
Wow.

125
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,870
Wow.

126
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,440
You still have that pie.

127
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:21,102
Yes, we do.
I'm Noreen, by the way.

128
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:22,838
Oh, hey, Noreen.

129
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,775
John Dixon.

130
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,715
- Nice to meet you, John.
- You too.

131
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,283
Likewise.

132
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:32,618
So, hey, is there a restroom?

133
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:36,193
- Oh, in the back, by the phones.
- Okay.

134
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:42,733
Hey, you should flush it twice.
The handle gets stuck.

135
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,664
I'll keep that in mind.

136
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,138
And that's Lord of the Ball.

137
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:54,609
It's 101.
Your Hip Country WTKJ FM.

138
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:58,580
Next up, news headlines, including
a grizzly multiple homicide

139
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,207
in Union County.

140
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:03,115
Plus the start of the Lincoln County
Fair this weekend...

141
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:07,953
and a road widening for the proposed
shopping center on 501 has hit a snag.

142
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:11,085
But first, WTKJ news is sponsored by...

143
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,890
- What's the matter?
- Shh. Be quiet.

144
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,261
What's wrong?

145
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,392
Some murders over in Union County.

146
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,000
Murders?

147
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:24,106
Four murders are being investigated
by the Union County Sheriff's Department.

148
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:27,643
The execution style slayings occurred
in the town of Aberdeen.

149
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,872
The bodies of Tom Carter,
age forty four...

150
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,448
his wife, Lucille, age forty one...

151
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,984
and their two children, ages six
and nine...

152
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,588
were discovered dead in their
home this evening.

153
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,212
Gosh.
Police Chief Ronny Gayle said

154
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,654
they were shot in the head...

155
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,625
with a twenty two caliber weapon
after being tied up

156
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,787
and wrapped in plastic.

157
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,898
Authorities are on the lookout
for a male...

158
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:50,967
possibly driving a late model black
pickup truck in connection

159
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,536
with the murders.
In other... local news, Union...

160
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,531
Jesus Christ.

161
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,474
What the hell is the world
coming to?

162
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,435
It's crazy.

163
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,311
This shit is just crazy.

164
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:07,650
Suspect, black pickup truck should
be easy to pick up.

165
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,414
What kind of person kills a child?

166
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:13,386
A sick bastard, that's who.

167
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,220
Something's wrong.

168
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:21,595
Well, let's get back to work.

169
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:47,851
You okay?

170
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:50,392
There were some murders tonight.

171
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:51,426
Really?

172
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,690
Yeah. A whole family.

173
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,364
Wow.

174
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,267
A husband, wife, two little kids.

175
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,701
Did you know them?

176
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:06,039
No, no, I didn't,
but little kids, you know?

177
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:09,473
You have kids?

178
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:10,672
No, no, no.

179
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,749
The Lord didn't see it fit to
bless us with any.

180
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,352
It's probably for the best, though.

181
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,956
How about you?
Is there a Mrs. John?

182
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,129
There was.

183
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:34,364
She... she passed away
two years ago.

184
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,067
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

185
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,074
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

186
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:44,580
She was... she was a good woman.

187
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:49,710
You know what?
I think I will have something to eat.

188
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:07,071
It gives me the heebie jeebies.

189
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,035
What's that?

190
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,970
There's some crazy lunatic out
there somewhere.

191
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,577
There ain't no lunatics out here.

192
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:16,704
How's Frank these days?

193
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:20,079
- Oh, he's Frank.
- Got a job yet?

194
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:22,778
Yeah, he's employed full time
by the television.

195
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,684
I'm sure he'll find something.

196
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:26,813
If he'd get off his butt.

197
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,017
You could kick his ass out.

198
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,222
I married him for better or worse.

199
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,765
This is just the worse part, I guess.

200
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,762
You could always leave him.

201
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,170
Yeah, where would I go?

202
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:43,706
What would I do?
I'm just some damn waitress.

203
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,642
I don't know.
You could always...

204
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,908
run away with me.

205
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:53,513
Now what would Bobbie Sue
have to say about that one?

206
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:56,782
Bobbie Sue.

207
00:15:57,388 --> 00:16:00,414
She likes you better
than she likes me anyhow.

208
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,362
Speaking of which, I think I should
get home to the missus.

209
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:06,758
How much do I owe?

210
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,763
Uh, five ninety one.

211
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,959
- Is that right?
- Yeah, let me see.

212
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,997
Two twenty for the burgers,
seventy five cents for the fries...

213
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,436
A buck sixty five for the pies...

214
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:20,601
Ninety five cents for the ice tea...
That's five fifty five... plus tax.

215
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,212
Yeah, it's five ninety one.

216
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:23,974
Well damn, girl.

217
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,174
See you're not some dumb waitress.

218
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,046
Hell, you can count.

219
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,644
Oh great, I can count.

220
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:30,913
Well, you know that
and a nickel can get...

221
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,522
me a cup of coffee.

222
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:38,753
Cheer up, Noreen,
it's gonna get better.

223
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:42,127
I guess it can't rain forever.

224
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,861
Sorry, Mister, the kitchen's closed.

225
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:20,736
Where's the nearest town?

226
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,304
Silver Lake.

227
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,740
But everything's probably closed
by now.

228
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,371
Silver Lake, huh.

229
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,449
What's after that?

230
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,575
Nothing but cows
and cornfields for hours.

231
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:39,715
Can I interest you in a piece of pie
or a cup of coffee?

232
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:46,661
I'll think about that
for a little while.

233
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,506
Can I get you something?

234
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:10,977
Yeah, get me a... get me a steak.

235
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:14,558
Kitchen's closed.
Can I interest you in some pie?

236
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,060
No.

237
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:19,061
We got the best pecan this side
of the Mason Dixon.

238
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,722
When the fuck did I ask you for pie?

239
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,798
Give me some coffee.

240
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,565
- Sure thing.
- Can you?

241
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:35,110
Hey! Hey!
We got a problem out there?

242
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,914
Evidentially you can't hear.
The lady said the kitchen's closed.

243
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:44,021
That means I'm not making squat
for anybody.

244
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,957
If you don't like it, there's the door!

245
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:05,362
Hey Noreen... sweetie...
I should get my change... and...

246
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:14,970
Meet me in the back.

247
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,670
What's that?

248
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm just going to get some coffee
in the back.

249
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:45,939
Oh, uh... It's late, Hank.

250
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:49,478
I'm gonna hit the head
before I head out.

251
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:01,619
Hey. What's going on?

252
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,655
That man.

253
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,193
What man?

254
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:12,428
The one thatjust came in.
I've got a bad feeling about him.

255
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,060
Why?

256
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:17,736
Maybe that's him.

257
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:20,801
Him?

258
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,539
The one that killed that family.

259
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,842
Oh, Noreen.

260
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:32,245
He doesn't look like
the serial killer type to me.

261
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,948
I'm a police officer.

262
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,355
Just because you watch America's
Most Wanted every night,

263
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:37,859
don't make you an expert
on serial killers.

264
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:38,959
Whoa. Whoa.

265
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,930
Let's just stop right there.

266
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,589
For your information, America's Most...

267
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,497
Wanted plays a... critical part
in the apprehension

268
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,763
of many fugitives in this country.

269
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,202
It's important.

270
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,001
Lonnie...

271
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:55,045
- Noreen, you're justjumpy, that's all.
- I am not.

272
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:02,516
Look, even if he was the killer,
which clearly he is not...

273
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,087
He wouldn't stop in here for a
cup of coffee.

274
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:07,383
If he had a lick of sense,
he'd be a million miles away...

275
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:10,050
and he certainly wouldn't be
in this county.

276
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:13,129
All right.
And what if you're wrong?

277
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:17,692
I can'tjust go question a man
because you think he's weird.

278
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:20,235
You're the cop.
Go talk to him.

279
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,831
- Talk to who?
- Oh my God,

280
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,273
you scared the shit
outta me!

281
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:27,736
Jees.
We was... we was just talking.

282
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:29,445
What can I get for you?

283
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,104
Some more coffee.

284
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:32,681
Yeah, sure.

285
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,409
He just wanted more coffee, see?

286
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:36,952
He wanted more coffee, that's all.

287
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:57,871
Sorry.

288
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,664
You okay?

289
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:26,860
You look like you saw a ghost.

290
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:31,741
Hey.

291
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,337
You all right?

292
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:41,215
That guy's got her spooked.

293
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:45,080
Maybe you ought to go say something.

294
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:49,059
Who?

295
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:50,820
Me?

296
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,294
You're the one with the badge.
Go do yourjob.

297
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:04,738
Excuse me.

298
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:09,107
Pardon me, mister.

299
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:28,222
It's probably none of my business,

300
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:31,892
but I was just wondering
what brings you here?

301
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,736
Here?

302
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:38,800
Oh, just our little slice of heaven here.
What brings you out this way?

303
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,174
It's none of your business.

304
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:44,475
Oh, well
we're a little friendly around here.

305
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:45,673
We just...

306
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:50,446
We like to get to know strangers.
I just want to know, that's all.

307
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,249
Is that a fact.

308
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,289
Yeah.

309
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:56,086
I just want to be left alone.

310
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:59,219
Well I can appreciate that.
I can appreciate that.

311
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,263
Where are you heading?

312
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:03,161
That's none of your fucking business.

313
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,202
May I remind you that you're a
talking to an officer of the law.

314
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:10,398
When you're asked some questions,
I'd like your name, sir.

315
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,941
Is that what you are,
an officer of the law?

316
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,009
That's right.
You want to just take it

317
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:15,076
down a notch, friend?

318
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,804
I'm just asking you a few questions.

319
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:19,415
You're more like a deputy, aren't you?

320
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,017
I am in fact a deputy.

321
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,481
Now listen. I'm just here
to ask you a few questions.

322
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,722
That's all.
I'm not here to start any trouble.

323
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:28,057
Are you looking for trouble? 'Cause
if you're looking for trouble, I'm here.

324
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:30,117
I'm just looking to be left alone,
like I told you.

325
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:33,025
I'll leave you alone as soon as you
answer a few questions.

326
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,755
Fuck you.

327
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:35,831
God damn this!

328
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,957
I've had just about enough
of your mouth.

329
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:40,229
All right, you walk in here
using that kinda language,

330
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,599
I won't tolerate it.

331
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:45,038
Now, I need you to answer
some questions.

332
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:47,971
This conversation is over.

333
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:54,683
This conversation is not over,
god damn it.

334
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:57,911
I'm an officer of the law,
you will tell me what I wanna know!

335
00:25:58,155 --> 00:26:00,856
Hey, mister...
I'm talking to you!

336
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:02,155
Oh yeah?

337
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:04,057
How's this?
This might get your attention.

338
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,560
How's that? Huh?

339
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:09,666
Now you tell me right now what
you're driving.

340
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,233
Are you gonna shoot me, officer?

341
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,235
I know what to do with this.
You don't worry about that.

342
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:17,363
You just answer my questions.

343
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:21,342
You know if you take that thing out,
you better be ready to use it.

344
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:23,946
I don't wanna have to
ask you again, buddy.

345
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:26,775
You answer my questions,
right now.

346
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:28,550
Mister!

347
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:31,678
God damn it.
How's that, huh?

348
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,382
- Lonnie.
- How's that?

349
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:34,582
Lonnie.

350
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:40,593
Did I get your attention now,
huh, tough guy?

351
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:43,564
Did I get your attention now?
Take another step.

352
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,965
You tell me what you drive.

353
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:49,199
You tell me what kind
of car you're driving!

354
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,568
I'm driving a truck.

355
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,403
A truck. A truck.

356
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:53,942
They said it was a black truck.

357
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:56,740
I know. I know.

358
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,212
What color is your truck?

359
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,010
It's right out there. Why don't you
step outside and see for yourself?

360
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:07,313
It's dark.

361
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,892
I mean, it looks black from here.

362
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,722
It's red.

363
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:14,490
Would you help me out here, Hank?
Huh?

364
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,430
All right.

365
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:21,102
It's red, so you say.

366
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:23,229
We'll see about that.

367
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:35,911
This is awesome.

368
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,655
It's red.

369
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,960
Red?

370
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:55,904
You sure?

371
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,735
Well, I'm no Martha Stewart,
but I'm pretty sure...

372
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,605
I can still tell the difference
between red and black.

373
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,974
The truck's red.

374
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:04,808
It's red.

375
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:13,880
It's red.

376
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,594
I'm sorry, mister.

377
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,030
I'm real sorry.
I mean...

378
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,793
This has been
a real bad misunderstanding.

379
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:32,271
You see, we're looking for a fella
in a truck.

380
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,276
It was... There was a police report
on the radio.

381
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:38,609
They're looking for a man in a
black truck.

382
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:41,550
What did this man in a black
truck do anyway?

383
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:46,252
He killed some folks.

384
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:30,194
Oh my gosh.

385
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:44,946
Well, I think that's about enough
excitement for one night.

386
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:47,712
- Check, please.
- Yeah.

387
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,518
I'll be right back.

388
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:10,696
I should come by here more often.

389
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,469
I didn't know you guys had late
night entertainment.

390
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,237
Are you okay?

391
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:19,472
- Yeah?
- I'm still shaking.

392
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:25,786
It's going to be okay.

393
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:29,188
I don't think he'll be coming back
here any time soon.

394
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,951
Oh my god!

395
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:15,735
Please.

396
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,151
Sit down.

397
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,088
Come here.

398
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:29,270
I want everybody's keys.

399
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:33,380
Your wallets, your cell phones...

400
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,475
Put them on the table
right over there.

401
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:37,712
Everybody.
Right now.

402
00:32:54,404 --> 00:32:59,137
- You... Bring them over here.
- What?

403
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,808
- Me?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,408
Everything. Pick it up
and bring it over here.

405
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:14,455
Take everything out
and put it right here.

406
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,005
Is that it?

407
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:42,680
You sure that's it?

408
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:50,116
Okay. Go back and sit down.

409
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:56,627
Hey!

410
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,268
Oh my god.

411
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:01,496
Are we having a problem over there?

412
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:02,764
Jesus.

413
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:06,672
I said.
Are we having a problem over there?

414
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:10,538
No. No problem.

415
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,148
Then sit the fuck down.

416
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,913
I thought you said you
gave me everything.

417
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:27,153
Don't fuck with me, honey.

418
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:30,231
Yes, sir.

419
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,938
Go back and sit down.

420
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:40,238
Hey.

421
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,738
Jack in the box.

422
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,840
Why don't you just walk on
over here right now?

423
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:52,050
That guy on the floor over there?

424
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:54,553
You drag him out.

425
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,690
Get it out where?

426
00:34:57,828 --> 00:34:59,625
Wherever you want him.

427
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,924
Just do it.

428
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:04,128
You're crazy.
I ain't touching that thing.

429
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:05,859
Do what I say!

430
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,096
I'll put a fucking hole
in you right now.

431
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:23,377
I can't do this, mister.
I'm going to be sick.

432
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,044
Then be sick.

433
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:28,620
Drag him out, like I told you.

434
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:12,795
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

435
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:16,269
- It's going to be okay.
- We're gonna die.

436
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:18,169
- I'm so scared.
- Shh.

437
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:20,503
Don't say anything.
Don't move.

438
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,140
Oh shit.

439
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:33,587
Do you think he's going to kill us?

440
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:36,150
I don't know.

441
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:38,922
I'm really scared.

442
00:36:39,062 --> 00:36:40,962
That's okay.
Me too.

443
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:45,059
I wish we could do something.

444
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,433
Do you live close?

445
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:48,663
Yeah.

446
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:49,794
Your husband.

447
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,135
Is he going to miss you,
you know.

448
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,004
Call the cops?

449
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,009
No.

450
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:06,020
Look, I figure he's got maybe
eight bullets in that handgun.

451
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,647
Maybe seven shells in the shotgun.

452
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,350
How do you know that?

453
00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:14,625
Lonnie carries a 1911.

454
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:16,664
Standard eight rounds.

455
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,430
Are you a gun expert?

456
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:20,968
Sort of.

457
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,173
What are you saying?

458
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:29,906
I say we rush him.

459
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,404
Are you crazy?

460
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:32,446
No, I ain't crazy.

461
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:34,447
There's five of us.
There's one of him.

462
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:37,018
Odds are he can't shoot us all.

463
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:39,678
Odds are he's going to shoot
some of us.

464
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:43,715
He's going to kill us anyway.

465
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,489
At least if we rush him,
we got us a chance.

466
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:49,656
We don't know what he wants.

467
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:51,892
Jesus Christ.

468
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,503
I won't sit around here
to wait to find out.

469
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:56,629
Are you with me?

470
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:02,400
Why not?

471
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:05,605
Look, I'm a salesman.
I'm not a superhero.

472
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,013
What do you suggest we do then?

473
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,476
Wait?

474
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,815
Wait for what?
To die?

475
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:13,822
Fuck that.

476
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:16,291
Will you shut that yakking over there!

477
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:39,915
Mister?

478
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,383
What?

479
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,081
I know you're scared.

480
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,819
Of what?

481
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:51,316
It's not too late.

482
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,326
Too late for what?

483
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:58,029
To stop all this before it gets worse.

484
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,997
Please.

485
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:02,729
Please.

486
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:25,460
You guys just sit over there
and play dumb.

487
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:56,483
Whoa.

488
00:39:56,626 --> 00:40:01,495
Hey. Hey, it's me.
It's Greene.

489
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:04,065
You must be Mr. Smith.

490
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,065
You're the man with the gun.

491
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,466
Whoo. Boy hey...

492
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:11,972
Nash told me you were one cold
hearted son of a bitch, but my god...

493
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:13,598
I had no idea.

494
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:14,907
Hey, would you mind
not pointing that at me?

495
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:16,269
I... I don't like guns.

496
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:21,584
Hey!

497
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:23,515
Oh, okay.

498
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,678
Not the friendly type.

499
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,315
I get it.
You're working.

500
00:40:27,457 --> 00:40:30,085
You're busy.
No problema.

501
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:33,684
Yeah. Well, since you're busy...

502
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:37,364
I'll get right down to business.
Is it done?

503
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:39,227
Is what done?

504
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,031
Yeah, the job.
Is it done?

505
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:44,606
What do you think?

506
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:47,008
Well, okay.

507
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:50,078
Then this, my friend, is all yours.

508
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:55,116
It's all there.

509
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,289
You can count it
if you don't believe me.

510
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:19,397
Yeah. So, I guess we're square.

511
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:21,703
Well, it's been nice doing business
with you...

512
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:24,473
...Mr. Smith and I doubt I'll need your
services anytime in the future.

513
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:27,913
But I will highly recommend you.

514
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:31,282
Oh, and I hate to overstate
the obvious, but uh...

515
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,581
these people have seen my face,

516
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,486
so you are going to
take care of them, right?

517
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,956
Oh yeah.

518
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:38,627
Okay.

519
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,892
Well, I would love to stick around
and watch you do your work...

520
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,998
but I got a date, so good night.

521
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,429
Hey!

522
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:46,897
Sit down.

523
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:48,264
Why?

524
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:50,201
Because I said so.

525
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,864
What for?

526
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:52,808
Sit down!

527
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:55,539
I don't understand where you're
coming from here, buddy.

528
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:57,373
Sit down!

529
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,345
Look, is this some kind of scam?
Is that it?

530
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:00,972
Are you wanting more money
out of me?

531
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,017
I got your money.

532
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:03,986
No, because I don't have
any more money.

533
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,714
See, I was told you were a lot
more professional than this.

534
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:09,984
Yeah, and I don't know what the hell
you got going on in here.

535
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:13,220
But you can damn well believe
that I'm calling Nash,

536
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:14,796
and I'm gonna tell her.

537
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,262
We got a big problem.

538
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:18,424
A problem?
What?

539
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:21,465
What problem?

540
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,932
I ain't Smith.

541
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:24,628
All right, so... you're... you're not Smith.

542
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:30,028
And, uh you're not a cop, either.

543
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:33,233
Well, there was a cop in his earlier,
but he's dead now.

544
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:35,334
'Cause I shot him.

545
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:38,946
Okay.

546
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:42,782
You must want something.

547
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,716
All right.
I mean, right? Am I right?

548
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:47,482
- Everybody wants something, right?
- Sure.

549
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,423
Okay. Okay.

550
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:50,085
We're getting somewhere.
We're getting somewhere.

551
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:53,593
So, uh...
what do you want?

552
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:56,356
The truth.

553
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,296
Okay. I'll tell you whatever
you want to hear.

554
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:01,596
Who is Smith?

555
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:02,796
- Smith.
- Yeah.

556
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:08,536
Smith. Smith. Yeah, he, uh...
I don't know.

557
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,943
You don't know,
or you're not going to tell me.

558
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,707
Which is it?

559
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:14,578
Could you just untie me?
Let me go.

560
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:15,877
I'll pay ya.

561
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,850
I already got your money!

562
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:19,318
I'll pay you more.

563
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:21,320
You said you didn't have any more!

564
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:23,448
Now you're nothing but a liar,
Mr. Greene.

565
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:24,685
No, no, no, no, no, no.

566
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:27,421
I'm not.
I'm-I'm... I'll look-what do you do...

567
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:28,495
I'll tell you anything you
want to hear.

568
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:31,361
I'll tell you...
what you want to hear.

569
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:34,927
The money in the case.
Who's is it?

570
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:36,732
Where did it come from?

571
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:40,437
It was... that was a business deal.

572
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,012
- A business deal, huh.
- Yeah.

573
00:44:46,149 --> 00:44:48,174
What kind of business deal?

574
00:44:50,987 --> 00:44:53,649
I don't think I can do that.

575
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,621
I think you can.

576
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:57,589
I can't.

577
00:44:58,494 --> 00:45:00,485
That's the wrong answer.

578
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:10,038
Oh, no. Come on! Come on,
let's talk about this.

579
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:11,868
Let's talk about it.

580
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:14,374
I'm ready, I swear.
I'll pay you, man.

581
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,070
You know, I'm good for it.

582
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,805
Oh my god.

583
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,368
I shouldn't be here.

584
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,494
I just should not be here.

585
00:46:15,638 --> 00:46:17,572
This is not right!

586
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:19,971
The stupid convention.

587
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:22,771
I didn't want to go in the first place
and my boss makes me.

588
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:24,277
Really.

589
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:27,115
I should have driven straight
home the hundred miles.

590
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,210
But I had to stop in this particular
diner on this particular night.

591
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:34,482
Just dumb luck.

592
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:38,020
I'm going to die
in this god forsaken diner.

593
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:39,161
In the middle of nowhere.

594
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:40,496
For nothing!

595
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,629
Jesus!

596
00:46:42,765 --> 00:46:44,130
I'm sorry.

597
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:46,201
I'm so sorry.

598
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:52,806
I'm sorry.

599
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:53,806
Listen to me.

600
00:46:53,943 --> 00:46:57,242
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

601
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,280
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

602
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:01,183
I've had bad luck my whole life.

603
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:11,226
For what it's worth,
I'm glad you did stop.

604
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:24,538
Who's Smith?

605
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:26,733
And where did that money come from?

606
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:34,247
I... I... I can't tell you.

607
00:47:34,383 --> 00:47:35,782
Oh, I think you can.

608
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:37,977
Ask me how come I know it.

609
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:40,722
Say, "How do you know it?"

610
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:51,260
How do you know I'm going to tell
you the answer to the question.

611
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,891
'Cause I've seen it before.
Been there before.

612
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,801
Hundreds of times.

613
00:47:55,938 --> 00:47:57,872
Sooner or later you're going
to say everything.

614
00:47:58,007 --> 00:47:59,269
Everyone always does.

615
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:01,467
You got to ask yourself
a question though.

616
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:04,379
How much pain can you endure?

617
00:48:04,513 --> 00:48:07,277
How much pain can you endure,
Mr. Greene?

618
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:19,488
I think you need a little bit
more incentive.

619
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:28,196
No! No! Okay!

620
00:48:28,337 --> 00:48:29,827
Tell me what I want
to know now, damn it!

621
00:48:29,972 --> 00:48:30,906
No, no, please.

622
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,772
- No, I'll tell you!
- Now say it!

623
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,968
Okay, I'll tell you, I'll tell you,
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

624
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:37,511
Don't hold anything back.

625
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:39,547
Okay.
I'll tell you.

626
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:40,578
Okay.

627
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:42,550
What do you want me... to tell you?

628
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:45,711
Everything. Everything.

629
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:47,755
Uh, where do you want me to start?

630
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,051
Well, the beginning
is always a good place.

631
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:53,684
- Try that.
- Okay.

632
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:58,967
I... I... I'm a businessman.
This is all business right?

633
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:01,467
- Yeah.
- I own...

634
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:05,803
some family land over
in Anson County.

635
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,068
A couple of hundred acres.

636
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:09,302
We're building a shopping mall there.
I'm donating the land...

637
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:11,811
the land, my partners put up the money.

638
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,917
Pretty sweet deal you know.

639
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:18,782
It's perfect.
I could start printing the money... now.

640
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:21,481
I just needed to sell one
more piece of land.

641
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:28,228
One more big chunk of land right
where the parking lot needed to be.

642
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:30,355
But the owner,

643
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,598
he decided he didn't want to sell.

644
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:40,971
So I offered him double,
triple what it was worth.

645
00:49:41,777 --> 00:49:43,404
He still said no.

646
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,478
He wanted to be a farmer.

647
00:49:46,615 --> 00:49:48,549
You know, cows, chickens and shit.

648
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:52,450
I mean, who the hell wants to be
a farmer anymore?

649
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:58,857
Anyway... without that land,
I'm screwed.

650
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:01,425
The deal is stalled.

651
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,459
And I can't tell my partners,

652
00:50:06,602 --> 00:50:08,263
'cause they'll kill me.

653
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:12,966
The guys are loan sharks.
They're screaming for money.

654
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:14,872
And when they get sick
of screaming for money,

655
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,809
they start asking for fingers... and toes.

656
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:22,816
Look, I'm just a businessman.
I made a business choice.

657
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:25,750
I had to do something fast,
so I called an associate.

658
00:50:25,888 --> 00:50:27,822
He put me in touch with a name.

659
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:29,891
Mr. Smith.

660
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,891
Smith.

661
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:34,957
Who is this Smith anyway?

662
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:36,655
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

663
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,825
I don't know.
I... I don't even have a number.

664
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:40,963
He... he calls me.

665
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:42,195
What's he look like?

666
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,332
I don't know.
How the fuck should I know?

667
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:46,364
I talk to him on the phone.

668
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:48,067
This Smith.

669
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,842
What exactly is
he going to do for you?

670
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:59,251
He's going to persuade
the farmer to sell his land.

671
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:04,082
How's he going to do that?

672
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:12,332
I... I... don't know.
I don't know his operation.

673
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:14,929
You don't know?

674
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:16,728
What did he do to the farmer?

675
00:51:16,872 --> 00:51:18,533
What-what does it matter anyway?

676
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:21,768
Nothing to me, buddy.
What did he do to the farmer?

677
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,377
He killed the farmer.

678
00:51:30,352 --> 00:51:31,751
What else?

679
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:35,319
His wife.

680
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:40,757
Is that it?

681
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:47,329
His kids.

682
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:01,809
There's no heirs.

683
00:52:03,786 --> 00:52:09,315
The land goes to the bank.
And I get a better deal.

684
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:23,468
That's the way hit went, huh?

685
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:25,305
Yeah.

686
00:52:27,176 --> 00:52:29,007
You have no idea
what's going to happen to you next,

687
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,306
but you got it coming.

688
00:52:32,414 --> 00:52:33,642
Wait!

689
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:40,119
What are you going to do?
Hey, what are you going to do?

690
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:45,956
No! please... please don't shoot...

691
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:13,211
What?

692
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:15,585
We got a big quandary here.

693
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:17,351
What are you talking about?

694
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:20,087
I'm talking about that bag of money
on the counter over there.

695
00:53:20,229 --> 00:53:25,565
- So what?
- So what? That belongs to Smith.

696
00:53:26,235 --> 00:53:27,497
What do you mean?

697
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:30,503
That means one of you is Smith.

698
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:33,372
One of us?

699
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:37,010
He got here before I did.
That means it's one of you.

700
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:38,977
You god dammed idiot.

701
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:41,173
Do I look like a professional
killer to you?

702
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:43,683
I don't know.
Maybe you are.

703
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:46,421
You fucking nutbag.

704
00:53:46,555 --> 00:53:48,716
How about you?
You a killer?

705
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:52,088
Yeah, if you count the wildlife
I've run over with my car.

706
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:55,254
How can you be so sure?
Maybe he never showed up.

707
00:53:55,397 --> 00:53:57,797
Nobody's going to leave a bag
of money like that behind okay?

708
00:53:57,933 --> 00:53:59,161
Nobody.

709
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:02,097
How about these two?

710
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:04,930
How about you, college boy?

711
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:07,269
I'm no killer.

712
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:08,967
I'm an artist.

713
00:54:10,913 --> 00:54:13,006
I ought to gun you first.

714
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:17,643
Why don't you decide for me?

715
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:18,775
I got a couple of maybes here.

716
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:20,411
Maybe?

717
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:22,046
Maybe.

718
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:26,718
Which one is the man.
Who's Smith?

719
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:27,826
Neither.

720
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:29,694
How do you know?

721
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:31,723
Hank's in here a couple
of times a month.

722
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,334
It can't be him.

723
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:36,336
A couple of times a month, huh.
And because of that you think

724
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:38,372
you know him that well.

725
00:54:40,743 --> 00:54:43,610
Not that well, but he's not a killer.

726
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:45,714
How about him?

727
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:48,245
He isn't either.

728
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,682
What if I make you guess?

729
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:54,983
What if I give you
three seconds on the clock?

730
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:57,853
I can't.

731
00:54:57,993 --> 00:54:59,654
Who is it?

732
00:55:00,162 --> 00:55:02,960
- I can't.
- Three.

733
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:05,089
- I can't!
- Two.

734
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:06,667
- Please.
- One.

735
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:07,996
Oh my god.

736
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:13,006
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

737
00:55:15,878 --> 00:55:17,607
I'll talk.

738
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:22,414
I'll talk to you.

739
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,544
Hell, no.
He volunteered. Take him.

740
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:29,681
I don't care what he did.
I want to talk to you first.

741
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:33,758
Let's go.

742
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:00,909
I just want to go home.

743
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:05,076
I know. I know. Shh.

744
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:09,224
Okay. Okay.

745
00:57:09,591 --> 00:57:11,525
It's going to be okay,
I promise.

746
00:57:38,587 --> 00:57:41,488
- Look.
- What?

747
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,790
He made a mistake.
He didn't handcuff him.

748
00:57:47,863 --> 00:57:49,353
So?

749
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:57,035
So he's getting sloppy.
I have an idea.

750
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,032
I have to get his gun.

751
00:58:00,843 --> 00:58:02,333
How are you going to do that?

752
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:04,378
I got to get close to him.

753
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:05,741
I don't understand.

754
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:08,543
Look, you see what's going on, right?

755
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:10,447
He's going to kill that hillbilly
and he's going to put me

756
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:11,678
in that chair next.

757
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,344
What for?

758
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:16,424
So I need you to distract him.

759
00:58:16,558 --> 00:58:19,356
Get him to turn his back,
just for a second. Okay?

760
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:21,554
How am I going to do that?

761
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:24,289
Okay. When I come get you,
I want you to scream

762
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:25,491
as loud as you can, okay?

763
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:26,965
Get him to turn his back.

764
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:29,434
Then I'm going to go for the gun.

765
00:58:32,674 --> 00:58:34,232
Can you do that?

766
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:39,612
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

767
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:42,111
Good.

768
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:53,183
You might as well hold your breath.
I ain't no killer.

769
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:55,061
Says you.

770
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:59,228
So how is this going to go?

771
00:58:59,735 --> 00:59:02,670
I'm going to ask you questions.
And then you can answer me.

772
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:05,096
Questions about what?

773
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,468
Questions about you.

774
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:08,473
Ain't nothing special about me.

775
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,544
Everybody's special.

776
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:16,007
Each and every one of us
is a beautiful, unique snowflake.

777
00:59:17,085 --> 00:59:19,178
That is the stupidest shit I ever heard.

778
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,084
You saying I'm stupid?

779
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,222
Are you saying I'm stupid?
Is that it?

780
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,352
No sir.

781
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,159
You're a soldier, aren't you?

782
00:59:29,665 --> 00:59:30,654
I was.

783
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,528
You see any action?

784
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:34,832
Gulf War.

785
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,770
Desert Shield.

786
00:59:36,905 --> 00:59:38,338
I was in the shit.

787
00:59:38,473 --> 00:59:40,407
What were you?

788
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:42,537
Gun bunny.

789
00:59:43,111 --> 00:59:44,601
Pretty good view of the action.

790
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:46,873
The action I saw was a bit different.

791
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:48,607
What was that, sir?

792
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,241
Well, you can say that I was kind
of a people person.

793
00:59:51,386 --> 00:59:52,316
What about Iraq?

794
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:54,254
Did you make it over there?

795
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:56,414
Got out before that cluster.

796
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:57,923
Good for you.

797
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,757
What do you do now?

798
00:59:59,895 --> 01:00:01,863
I drive a truck.

799
01:00:01,997 --> 01:00:03,828
You married?

800
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:05,194
Yes sir.

801
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:06,699
How long?

802
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:08,462
Eleven years.

803
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:10,595
Eleven years married.

804
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,708
What's your wife's name?

805
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:17,173
Her name is Mabel.

806
01:00:17,312 --> 01:00:18,279
Mabel.

807
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,941
What a sweet name.

808
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,615
She must be a good woman.

809
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:24,741
The best.

810
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:26,319
The best.

811
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:28,719
Do you love her?

812
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:31,620
What?

813
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,361
I say, do you love her, soldier boy?

814
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:36,257
Of course I love her.

815
01:00:36,398 --> 01:00:37,797
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

816
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:39,491
I told you I did.

817
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:40,727
You're a liar!

818
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:43,770
Look, Mister, I don't appreciate you
calling me a goddamned liar.

819
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:45,668
You ain't lying?

820
01:00:50,912 --> 01:00:52,607
What's that?

821
01:00:57,152 --> 01:00:58,881
What is that?

822
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:00,886
It's your wallet, right?

823
01:01:13,035 --> 01:01:15,026
What are you doing with that in there?

824
01:01:15,871 --> 01:01:17,361
Carrying around someone else's condom.
Is that it?

825
01:01:17,506 --> 01:01:21,533
Does it belong to somebody else?
Is it yours or not?

826
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:23,443
Yes.

827
01:01:23,845 --> 01:01:25,437
Well all right.

828
01:01:27,382 --> 01:01:29,475
What do you do with that damn thing?

829
01:01:30,852 --> 01:01:33,377
You having sex with other people
besides Mabel?

830
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:36,218
You got what you want.
Can I go now?

831
01:01:36,758 --> 01:01:38,316
Hell no, you can't go.

832
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,260
Why?

833
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:41,154
I done told you
everything you want.

834
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:43,589
'Cause I'm not through with you yet!

835
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:49,459
I want to know who these people are.
That you've been having sex with.

836
01:01:49,604 --> 01:01:52,095
Other than your wife of eleven years.

837
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:54,465
This shit ain't none of your business.

838
01:01:54,609 --> 01:01:56,509
I'm making it my business.

839
01:01:58,146 --> 01:02:00,046
I'm done talking.

840
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:19,193
Who is it?
Huh? Who is it?

841
01:02:24,139 --> 01:02:25,902
I don't know.
I don't know.

842
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,338
You don't know
or you're not going to say.

843
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:28,966
Which is it?

844
01:02:30,178 --> 01:02:31,475
I don't know their names.

845
01:02:31,613 --> 01:02:32,978
There's more than one, huh?

846
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:35,675
Who are they?
Prostitutes?

847
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:38,346
Some.

848
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,250
Where do you meet them?

849
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:44,420
Truck stops.

850
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:48,427
Gas stations.
Bathrooms mostly.

851
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:50,428
You having sex with men?

852
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:54,864
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Why?

853
01:02:55,003 --> 01:02:57,028
Because I like it!

854
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,867
Exciting, huh?

855
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:01,737
- Yeah.
- Better than with your wife, huh?

856
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:05,639
Yeah.

857
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,908
Are you Smith?

858
01:03:09,985 --> 01:03:12,852
Look, I'll be anybody
you want me to be.

859
01:03:12,988 --> 01:03:15,582
Just don't shoot me again.

860
01:03:15,724 --> 01:03:17,817
Please don't shoot me again.

861
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:20,061
Are you Smith?

862
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:23,187
Yeah. Yes, I'm Smith.

863
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:25,629
- You ain't Smith.
- No!

864
01:04:25,493 --> 01:04:27,518
You killed an innocent man.

865
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:30,927
That's the trouble with
aggressive interrogation methods.

866
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:36,000
Sometimes you only end up hearing
what you want instead of the truth.

867
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:38,071
He didn't deserve to die.

868
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:41,232
That's debatable.
He did serve a purpose.

869
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:42,866
As far as I'm concerned.

870
01:04:43,678 --> 01:04:47,011
His purpose?
What was that?

871
01:04:47,782 --> 01:04:49,875
Why are you doing this?

872
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:55,551
Is this some kind of game to you?
Playing with people's lives like this?

873
01:04:56,291 --> 01:05:00,785
You got to separate the wheat
from the chaff.

874
01:05:02,397 --> 01:05:04,228
What the hell does that mean?

875
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:05,526
I read it in a book somewhere.

876
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:08,363
For people who don't understand
the situation that they're in.

877
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:10,835
And what is my situation?

878
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:16,572
You're a good person.

879
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:21,508
You're just at the wrong place

880
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,277
at the wrong time, basically.

881
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:29,079
You could change it.

882
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:34,626
No, I can't.

883
01:05:36,531 --> 01:05:38,829
You have the power to change it.

884
01:05:40,535 --> 01:05:42,765
No. Can't do it.

885
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:44,796
You can.

886
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:50,133
Please do the right thing,
and just walk away, right now.

887
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:52,007
I've got a job.

888
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,078
It's a job I'm going to finish.

889
01:05:54,215 --> 01:05:56,342
That's the way it is.

890
01:05:56,484 --> 01:05:58,281
A job?

891
01:05:59,354 --> 01:06:01,185
A job?

892
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:06,460
You call torturing
and killing people a job?

893
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:11,830
Why are you doing this?

894
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:17,134
What difference does it make?

895
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:19,837
It does.
It helps to know.

896
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:24,502
Listen.
If you want to know the truth,

897
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,745
I'm telling you honey.
I just came in here

898
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:28,940
to get something to eat.

899
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:31,842
Yeah.

900
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,151
Then what happened
all hell broke loose.

901
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,087
That's what happened.
That's the way it is.

902
01:06:41,229 --> 01:06:43,561
What am I going to do now?
I can't turn back.

903
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:48,360
You, John.
Get up.

904
01:06:48,503 --> 01:06:50,027
No.

905
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:53,031
- Get up.
- It's not him.

906
01:06:53,174 --> 01:06:54,505
Get the fuck out of that booth.

907
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:56,337
Hey, it's okay.

908
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,578
Get up.

909
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:05,386
Over there.
Sit down.

910
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:06,854
Come on, get up.

911
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:10,555
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

912
01:07:14,095 --> 01:07:15,995
Stop right there.

913
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:25,568
I'm not taking any chances with you.

914
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,092
Baby.

915
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:54,296
I'm going to die.

916
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:55,733
Don't say that.

917
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,861
We're going to fucking die.

918
01:07:58,907 --> 01:08:00,465
We're going to die.

919
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:17,389
Get up.

920
01:08:29,237 --> 01:08:30,568
Are you Smith?

921
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:36,206
I am not Smith.

922
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:38,312
My name is Dixon.

923
01:08:38,446 --> 01:08:40,437
Dixon.

924
01:08:40,815 --> 01:08:42,407
Sure you are.

925
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,108
Listen.

926
01:08:44,252 --> 01:08:46,186
I'm in sales.

927
01:08:46,321 --> 01:08:48,118
Really, I'm in sales.

928
01:08:48,256 --> 01:08:50,349
- Sales.
- Yeah.

929
01:08:50,492 --> 01:08:52,460
I'm mean really, seriously.
Come on.

930
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:54,027
Do I look like a killer to you?

931
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:55,993
I mean, do I?

932
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:57,530
What makes you think I'm a killer?

933
01:08:57,665 --> 01:08:58,689
Huh?

934
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:01,893
You're the only one left.
It ain't her, that's for sure.

935
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:04,971
Please. Please, I am not Smith.

936
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:07,700
If you're not Smith,
you're no good to me.

937
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:09,605
Please, Mister, stop!

938
01:09:09,744 --> 01:09:12,440
Can't you see
he doesn't know anything!

939
01:09:18,853 --> 01:09:20,218
Wait.

940
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:26,193
Sorry.

941
01:09:35,036 --> 01:09:36,663
Are you Smith or not?

942
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:42,107
You know, I can tell you
I'm the Easter Bunny.

943
01:09:42,911 --> 01:09:44,811
But it wouldn't mean shit.

944
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:47,872
But you're Smith.

945
01:09:48,016 --> 01:09:51,645
Yes. I am Smith.

946
01:09:52,687 --> 01:09:56,316
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Yes we are.

947
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:58,452
You kill that whole family?

948
01:09:58,593 --> 01:10:00,561
Yes.

949
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:09,632
- Professional killer?
- Independent contractor.

950
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:11,102
Who do you work for?

951
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,230
Not your business.

952
01:10:13,374 --> 01:10:15,604
I can make it my business.
And I can make you tell me.

953
01:10:15,743 --> 01:10:17,210
I don't think so.

954
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:19,142
I'm very good at my job.

955
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,874
I'm sure you are.

956
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:23,677
It doesn't matter.

957
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:25,843
I can tell you that.

958
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:28,547
Certainly by now you know
I'm trained to do this.

959
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,022
Yeah, you were
talking about it all night.

960
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:32,456
Ex-military, right.

961
01:10:32,594 --> 01:10:33,526
Yeah.

962
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:35,526
- You're an interrogator, right?
- Yeah.

963
01:10:35,663 --> 01:10:37,221
I know your type.

964
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:39,265
Professional.

965
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,368
Sadistic fuck.

966
01:10:41,869 --> 01:10:43,029
Yeah.

967
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:46,629
And you work for the government, right?

968
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:48,173
It fucking figures.

969
01:10:48,309 --> 01:10:52,268
Human resource exploitation.
Scored real high on that one.

970
01:10:52,413 --> 01:10:55,940
Yeah. Sick mind for a sick job.

971
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:58,746
That's what the government said right
before they shit canned me.

972
01:10:58,886 --> 01:11:00,547
They dumped you.

973
01:11:00,688 --> 01:11:02,986
Personality disorders.

974
01:11:03,858 --> 01:11:06,952
Said I was mentally unfit for service.

975
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,858
Fifteen years
of doing their dirty work.

976
01:11:08,997 --> 01:11:12,160
And that brass just hung me out
to twist in the wind.

977
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,392
Too bad.

978
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:15,593
Had two fucking years in prison,
that's what happened to me.

979
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:18,399
No gold watches, pension plans.

980
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:20,804
Fuck all I got.

981
01:11:22,176 --> 01:11:24,201
That's a fucking shame.

982
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:29,981
Sorry to disappoint you, you know.
But... still not going to tell you

983
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:31,745
what you want to know.

984
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:33,353
I can make you tell me anything
I want.

985
01:11:33,488 --> 01:11:35,217
I'm very good at what I do.

986
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:37,017
You know what I think?

987
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:39,126
I think you'll get tired of trying.

988
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,285
Then you'll just kill me, so

989
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:43,863
let's just cut
the bullshit all right?

990
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:45,590
I'll tell you this.

991
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,428
People I work for?

992
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:49,663
Family.

993
01:11:50,338 --> 01:11:53,068
Very powerful family.

994
01:11:53,207 --> 01:11:55,072
With connections everywhere.

995
01:11:55,209 --> 01:11:59,578
Kill me and you open up a whole
world of shit, my friend.

996
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:01,705
You and I... we're very much alike,
you know that?

997
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:05,979
No sir disappoint you again,
but you and I are nothing alike.

998
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,747
I kill for money.

999
01:12:07,889 --> 01:12:09,720
It's a job.
Nothing more.

1000
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:10,724
Nothing less.

1001
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:14,657
You kill because, you know...
you're looney tunes.

1002
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:18,292
Look, you're gonna kill me, right?

1003
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:19,866
Let's just get on with it.

1004
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:22,970
Really, I can't take much more
of this talking.

1005
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:24,071
You're not afraid to die.

1006
01:12:24,205 --> 01:12:25,968
No. I'm not.

1007
01:12:26,107 --> 01:12:28,507
I am afraid you're gonna
keep talking, though.

1008
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:35,472
What?
Something wrong?

1009
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:38,417
If I take... If I don't kill you,
you'll take the money.

1010
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:39,611
Then what's going to happen?

1011
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:42,245
People are going to hunt me down
and kill me.

1012
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,982
If I don't kill you,
I take the money

1013
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,353
and you're going to come
after me, right?

1014
01:12:45,493 --> 01:12:46,687
Yeah.

1015
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,591
That sounds about right.

1016
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:49,858
You know what?

1017
01:12:49,897 --> 01:12:53,298
You could, you could
just give me the money.

1018
01:12:53,434 --> 01:12:54,833
And go.

1019
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:56,561
And you'd forget all about me?

1020
01:12:56,704 --> 01:12:58,137
No.

1021
01:12:58,272 --> 01:13:00,433
But you'd have a big head start.

1022
01:13:00,575 --> 01:13:05,444
It's a big country.
I might never find you.

1023
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:09,206
How about splitting the money.
Why don't we split it?

1024
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:12,210
- Honestly.
- Yeah.

1025
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,844
I'd still hunt you down and kill you.

1026
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:16,718
Why not cut your losses
and take half the money,

1027
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:18,849
and then you'll live to spend it.

1028
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:21,784
'Cause I'd only be half happy.

1029
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:25,160
But you'd have your health.

1030
01:13:28,035 --> 01:13:31,835
You know... I don't expect you
to understand this cause...

1031
01:13:31,973 --> 01:13:33,907
you know, you're a homicidal
lunatic...

1032
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:36,566
But it's the principal of the thing.

1033
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:37,769
I did a job.

1034
01:13:37,912 --> 01:13:39,277
I earned my money.

1035
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:41,814
I expect to get paid.

1036
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:43,814
All of it.

1037
01:13:47,021 --> 01:13:48,010
It's a tough choice.

1038
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:51,614
Yeah, it's a pickle.
I do not envy you.

1039
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,520
What would you do?
If you were me?

1040
01:13:55,963 --> 01:13:58,932
- What? If I were in your position?
- Yeah. What would you do?

1041
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:02,335
I wouldn't be in your position.

1042
01:14:03,471 --> 01:14:06,201
Not that your position
is so much better.

1043
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,035
I guess it's a matter of opinion.

1044
01:14:08,176 --> 01:14:09,973
Is that what you think?

1045
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:11,976
You know what I'm thinking?

1046
01:14:14,549 --> 01:14:15,811
I'm going to tell you something.

1047
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:17,474
Here's what I'm thinking.

1048
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,446
I'm thinking you're
having a very bad day.

1049
01:14:20,588 --> 01:14:23,216
In what's probably a very bad life.

1050
01:14:23,357 --> 01:14:25,222
You walk in here
and get your ass handed to you

1051
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:26,485
by Barney fucking Fife...

1052
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:29,994
And then you know, you snap.
You start killing people.

1053
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:31,789
Why?
I don't know.

1054
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:34,026
I'm not a psychiatrist.

1055
01:14:34,168 --> 01:14:38,127
But, you're in too deep now.

1056
01:14:38,272 --> 01:14:39,239
You're in over your head.

1057
01:14:39,373 --> 01:14:42,809
You're screwed and you know it,
so you're thinking about the money.

1058
01:14:42,944 --> 01:14:44,775
Maybe I can take the money
and go to Mexico.

1059
01:14:44,912 --> 01:14:46,812
Leave all this behind me, you know.

1060
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:49,917
Live on the beach, sip tequila shots,
and watch the sun set.

1061
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:54,954
But the truth of the matter is,
your troubles are just beginning.

1062
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:57,520
You can kill me.

1063
01:14:57,859 --> 01:14:59,588
But my people
are like a fucking Hydra.

1064
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:02,628
You cut one head
& two more will pop up.

1065
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:05,196
You will never stop running.

1066
01:15:05,766 --> 01:15:06,790
You will never hide.

1067
01:15:06,934 --> 01:15:08,424
They will find you.

1068
01:15:08,569 --> 01:15:14,633
And they will slowly
but surely kill you.

1069
01:15:16,744 --> 01:15:18,336
I mean, that's what I think.

1070
01:15:24,352 --> 01:15:26,445
I calls them likes I sees them.

1071
01:15:54,715 --> 01:15:56,478
I can't have you talking to the cops.

1072
01:15:56,617 --> 01:15:58,482
Or talking to your friends.

1073
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:01,252
Kill everybody.

1074
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:03,550
Nobody will know I was ever here.

1075
01:16:24,545 --> 01:16:26,775
I thought you called
yourself a professional.

1076
01:16:30,217 --> 01:16:31,980
You're a fucking amateur.

1077
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:44,315
You okay?

1078
01:17:45,059 --> 01:17:46,492
Yeah.

1079
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:51,662
Thank God.

1080
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:56,694
I killed him.

1081
01:17:57,304 --> 01:17:59,101
You didn't have a choice.

1082
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:03,806
Is he really dead?

1083
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,183
Yeah.

1084
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:14,187
I can't believe I killed him.

1085
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:17,187
It was him or you.

1086
01:18:21,262 --> 01:18:22,786
It's okay.

1087
01:18:24,665 --> 01:18:27,361
Hey. These are starting to hurt.

1088
01:18:29,136 --> 01:18:33,334
You going to unlock them?
Keys are over there.

1089
01:18:52,026 --> 01:18:53,653
You got that key?

1090
01:19:01,368 --> 01:19:02,665
No.

1091
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:06,429
What?

1092
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:09,008
I can't.

1093
01:19:10,644 --> 01:19:12,509
You can't what?

1094
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,911
I can't let you go.

1095
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:17,478
Noreen.

1096
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:21,052
I know who you are.

1097
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:25,488
I'd never hurt you.

1098
01:19:25,626 --> 01:19:27,651
I promise.

1099
01:19:27,795 --> 01:19:30,355
You're going to kill me
the first chance you get.

1100
01:19:37,037 --> 01:19:38,197
All right.

1101
01:19:38,806 --> 01:19:40,239
Okay.

1102
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:42,274
Okay, so don't help me.

1103
01:19:42,409 --> 01:19:45,207
What are you
going to do... turn me in?

1104
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:47,746
Make a citizen's arrest?

1105
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:49,577
Yes.

1106
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:52,151
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1107
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:54,086
Why not?

1108
01:19:55,322 --> 01:19:57,847
You think the cops can protect you?

1109
01:19:59,226 --> 01:20:01,251
You will never be safe.

1110
01:20:04,632 --> 01:20:06,827
Don't move.

1111
01:20:08,102 --> 01:20:09,865
I'm not going to jail.

1112
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:13,130
Hold it! Right there!

1113
01:20:14,308 --> 01:20:16,401
What?
You're going to shoot me?

1114
01:20:19,547 --> 01:20:20,844
Don't make me.

1115
01:20:20,981 --> 01:20:22,608
I don't think you will.

1116
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,274
Oh, I will.

1117
01:20:25,252 --> 01:20:26,879
I don't believe you.

1118
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:28,778
And how do you know?

1119
01:20:28,923 --> 01:20:31,187
Mostly because of the way
you're holding that gun.

1120
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:34,021
I will. I swear it.

1121
01:20:34,628 --> 01:20:37,062
I don't think you have it
in you, Noreen.

1122
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:39,931
To intentionally kill another person?

1123
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:41,466
A human being?

1124
01:20:41,602 --> 01:20:46,198
You're not the kind of person
who stands up for herself.

1125
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,705
You know.

1126
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:51,141
You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.

1127
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:54,372
Well, I know enough about you.

1128
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:56,415
I know you've been stuck
in this dead end marriage,

1129
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:59,417
what... five or ten years...
and you don't have the guts to leave.

1130
01:20:59,553 --> 01:21:00,884
Shut up.

1131
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:04,115
Right? And you've been working
in this god forsaken place...

1132
01:21:04,258 --> 01:21:08,888
for I don't know how long,
serving rednecks, making slave wages.

1133
01:21:09,029 --> 01:21:11,088
No job satisfaction.

1134
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:14,925
Retirement?
And you still

1135
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:17,060
don't have the guts to go, do you?

1136
01:21:17,204 --> 01:21:19,672
Shut up!

1137
01:21:20,274 --> 01:21:24,608
So no, I don't think you have
the guts to pull the trigger.

1138
01:21:24,745 --> 01:21:26,303
Stop.

1139
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:31,315
I will shoot you

1140
01:21:31,952 --> 01:21:33,681
Put the gun down, Noreen.

1141
01:21:33,821 --> 01:21:35,755
Don't come any closer.

1142
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,687
Put the gun down.

1143
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:41,659
- I will shoot!
- Goddammit, put the gun down, Noreen!

1144
01:21:47,268 --> 01:21:48,735
Stop!

1145
01:21:50,104 --> 01:21:51,537
Stop.

1146
01:21:51,672 --> 01:21:52,639
Stop.

1147
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:54,698
- I mean it.
- No, I mean it, really.

1148
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,968
- I mean it.
- Shut up.

1149
01:21:58,946 --> 01:22:00,607
You know what?

1150
01:22:03,717 --> 01:22:07,084
I don't actually think you have
any bullets in that thing.

1151
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:08,620
What?

1152
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:12,691
I mean, I think you're holding
an empty gun.

1153
01:22:12,826 --> 01:22:14,418
No, I'm not.

1154
01:22:16,664 --> 01:22:17,597
Okay, let's see.

1155
01:22:17,598 --> 01:22:19,896
Let's think about it, okay?
You and me, we'll just think about it.

1156
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:22,434
How many shots were fired?
Seven?

1157
01:22:23,103 --> 01:22:24,798
Eight?

1158
01:22:25,339 --> 01:22:27,136
Wow, I don't know...
in all the confusion,

1159
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:28,741
I kind of lost count.

1160
01:22:28,876 --> 01:22:29,809
And I'm a professional.

1161
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:32,308
You're just a fucking,
stupid waitress!

1162
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:34,908
You know what?

1163
01:22:35,049 --> 01:22:36,448
You know what?

1164
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:41,646
You're right.
I am just a stupid waitress.

1165
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:46,852
I have a crappy, pathetic life.

1166
01:22:46,994 --> 01:22:51,795
I'm terrified of change.
I stay when I should go.

1167
01:22:54,101 --> 01:22:56,433
I'm not very smart.

1168
01:22:57,604 --> 01:23:00,937
And I'll probably
never be truly happy.

1169
01:23:02,142 --> 01:23:05,703
But I know one thing that you don't.

1170
01:23:05,846 --> 01:23:06,835
Oh yeah?

1171
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:08,846
What's that?

1172
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:11,318
I can count.

1173
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:18,255
Huh?

1174
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:21,086
One for the tall man.

1175
01:23:21,228 --> 01:23:23,196
Two for Hank.

1176
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,791
Three for the kids.

1177
01:23:27,267 --> 01:23:29,428
One for the ceiling.

1178
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:31,731
Seven bullets.

1179
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:34,307
And there's one for you.
