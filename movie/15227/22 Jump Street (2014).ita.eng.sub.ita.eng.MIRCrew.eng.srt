1
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,692
You're a fucking nerd.

2
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,652
Boy, you lucky you even graduating.

3
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,903
Fuck!

4
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,989
- You're good at this, huh?
- Yeah.

5
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,866
- You're really good at this.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,325
Hey, you want to be friends?

7
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,163
Yours isn't loaded, right?

8
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,000
- Just touch it.
- I'm scared.

9
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,003
- Just touch it.
- Seriously. All right, all right, all right.

10
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,131
You took a bullet for me, man.

11
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,841
You shot me in the dick!

12
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,927
Boom, motherfuckers!

13
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,638
You two sons of bitches are going to college!

14
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:49,609
Yin is characterised as slow, soft, passive
and is associated with water and femininity.

15
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:54,405
<i>While, yang, by contrast,</i>
<i>is fast and solid and...</i>

16
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,202
Man, this is BS. I thought we were going to
actual college, not online college.

17
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,454
Listening for coded messages in lectures.

18
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,873
What are you talking about? Look around.

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,708
This is our city.

20
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,960
- What do we want to be in college for?
- You're right.

21
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,629
Partners for life.

22
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:15,176
<i>At Metro City Port, the tide comes in</i>
<i>at 10:30 a.m. Then it will return to the sea.</i>

23
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,637
Metro Port. One hour.

24
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,557
Let's do this.

25
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,652
Surprise. There's two more arms.

26
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,631
- Shit! That's the Ghost.
- The Ghost?

27
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,093
Jöste Nillsen, biggest trafficker
of illegal goods in Metro City.

28
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,388
He teamed up with a Mexican cartel and
they're running all this shit through the port.

29
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,889
What the hell are we supposed to be buying?

30
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:02,974
I don't know.

31
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,018
What are you doing?

32
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,731
I got a new identity that's gonna be killer.
I'll be throwing it to you to make it legit.

33
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,191
Okay.

34
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm gonna need you to improvise. Okay?

35
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,029
- I don't want to improvise.
- I'm gonna need you to improvise.

36
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,781
I suck at improvising. I don't want to do it.

37
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,367
I need absolute silence
while I fall into character.

38
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,787
I need absolute silence
while I fall into character.

39
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,458
- Can you give me a head start on...
- I need absolute... I need absolute silence.

40
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,336
- Can you please...
- Absolute silence.

41
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,229
Are you fucking serious right now?

42
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,483
All right. I hate people who are late.

43
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,614
We're trying to see that product.

44
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,990
Shit!

45
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,659
Yo, Sleepy! What's up, homie?

46
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,411
You know my cousin, Sad Boy.

47
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,371
I think you got the wrong guy, homes.

48
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,749
That's bullshit, man! You Sleepy!

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,086
Everyone say in the barrio, "Sleepy,
he like the Mexican Wolverine" and shit.

50
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,172
Hey, my partner here,
he want to see the product.

51
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,715
Why ain't he talking?

52
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,553
My name is Jeff.

53
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,014
That's Jeffe, man.

54
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,767
Tell 'em about Mousie's quinceañera, man.

55
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,312
Tell 'em about that crazy adventure
you guys had.

56
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,357
I don't know what you're talking about.

57
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,903
Man, when you were telling the story
last night, you had so much detail!

58
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,614
The detail was so rich! It was rich detail!

59
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,868
Go into incredibly descriptive details
of the story, so we all know.

60
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,204
Oh, yes.

61
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,958
It was Dora and Diego

62
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,376
and Swiper.

63
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,752
Swiper?

64
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,673
Who was that you choked out, man?
He had it coming! Who was that?

65
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,509
Boots.

66
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,804
No, man, that wasn't Boots!
Boots isn't a real name!

67
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,138
You got to tell them the real story, man.

68
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,057
Start over from the top.

69
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,267
That's a made-up name.

70
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,314
I can't believe the punks
I have to deal with these days.

71
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,863
It really makes me miss the '90s,

72
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,866
when we had professionals around.

73
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,121
You want to check out the goods?

74
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,999
Check it out.

75
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,419
And shut up. Right?

76
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,337
Where'd you find this gringo, man?

77
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,632
At the fucking Mumford & Sons concert
and shit?

78
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,436
What is it? Guns? Drugs?

79
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,439
No! No!

80
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,524
- Dude!
- It's gross!

81
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,985
It's inking in my mouth!

82
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,029
I'll get it off.

83
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,115
Its tentacle is eating me!

84
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,451
It's so strong! It's really on there, man.

85
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,785
It's biting my face!

86
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,664
Shit!

87
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,500
Black market exotic animals,
just like we expected to be in there.

88
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,210
The accents are gone?

89
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,047
Take them out, guys. They're cops.

90
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,849
- What was that?
- I don't know! I think we're moving.

91
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,518
We're definitely moving!

92
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,563
There's fucking birds and shit in here!
There's actual shit!

93
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,023
What the fuck?

94
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,484
There's a fucking dragon in here!

95
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,777
Shit!

96
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,822
What was that?

97
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,120
Dude, that was our car.
We shared so much in that car!

98
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,124
I'm going to shoot them in the face for that!
That was our fucking car!

99
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,876
What are you doing?

100
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,254
Don't Teen Wolf on the truck!
Don't leave me here alone!

101
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,465
- Then get up here!
- I can't do that!

102
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,301
Then fucking climb around.
Come on, climb around.

103
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,178
Let's go. Come on, buddy. You got it.

104
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,763
This is so scary!

105
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,847
Shoot him!

106
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,182
Don't leave me out here!

107
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,017
- I'm all out.
- You stupid moron!

108
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,560
That's it. Come on.

109
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,314
- Fucking get up here. Come on.
- Fuck!

110
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,524
- All right, you good?
- Yeah!

111
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,400
- All you got to do is walk now, okay?
- Okay.

112
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,029
Shit!

113
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,658
What the fuck are you doing? Get up here!

114
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,076
I can't!

115
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,161
All right, fine, I guess I'll just drag you.

116
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,246
I'm gonna die!

117
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,915
You're not gonna die.
Just get the fuck up here!

118
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,463
Pull yourself up here.

119
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,715
Use your core!

120
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,469
You got it, you got it. Come on, come on.
Yeah!

121
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,679
All right.
Think you can stand on your own now?

122
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,847
Yes!

123
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:53,931
I think we lost them.

124
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,350
Shit!

125
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,310
He's the fucking Terminator!

126
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,229
That's fucking dangerous!

127
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,526
You are under arrest!

128
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,194
Pull the truck over!

129
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,197
I said pull the fucking truck over
right fucking now!

130
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,160
You owe me a car, and it'd better be
a fucking Lamborghini, you bitch!

131
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,244
I did it!

132
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,579
You have the right to remain silent.

133
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,414
Shit!

134
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,298
Holy Moses!

135
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,716
Shit.

136
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,678
- What happened?
- I think they got away.

137
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,558
Is that a hickey?

138
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,605
This was actually
an octopus-related incident.

139
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,527
I'd opened a crate
and the octopus had leapt onto my face.

140
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,322
Apparently, they have many, many arms.

141
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,408
- They have eight tentacles.
- Yes, and...

142
00:08:54,492 --> 00:09:00,080
Look, ladies, nobody gave a shit about the
Jump Street reboot when you first came on.

143
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:05,419
Anyone with half a brain, myself included,
thought it was destined to fail spectacularly.

144
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,046
But you got lucky.

145
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,714
So now this department has invested

146
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,718
a lot of money to make sure
Jump Street keeps going.

147
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,054
We've doubled their budget.

148
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,140
As if spending twice the money
guaranteed twice the profit.

149
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,935
Like that's going to work.

150
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:25,439
Yeah. Well, the commissioner's convinced
this debacle happened

151
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,567
because you weren't doing
the same undercover student thing

152
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,693
you did the first time.

153
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,489
She doesn't get that
it's always worse the second time around.

154
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:38,494
You settle into worn-out roles.
One gets possessive, the other runs away.

155
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:43,165
You begin a slow, painful unravelling,
as all the good things that came before

156
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,253
begin to be crushed
by the trash compactor of sadness.

157
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,047
That doesn't sound like us. I mean...

158
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,007
I'm getting a divorce.

159
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,178
We don't want to do the same thing.

160
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,305
We want to burst through our ceiling.

161
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,433
And you're gonna find another ceiling
and you got to bust through that one,

162
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,559
and you just got to keep hammering ceilings.

163
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,644
Okay, okay, okay.

164
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,772
What if we actually went
into the Secret Service

165
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,190
and, like, tried to protect the White House?

166
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,317
- I think...
- I don't think that would work.

167
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,152
I'm going to ask you to stop talking.

168
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,487
I thought it was a pretty good idea.

169
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:17,825
Do the same thing as last time,
everyone's happy.

170
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,163
I can't believe
the Koreans bought their church back.

171
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,625
Yeah. Good thing there was an even bigger
abandoned church directly across the street.

172
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,337
- Yeah. That's convenient.
- Yes, it is convenient.

173
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,215
Next year, we'll probably just be
right back across the street. Just next door.

174
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,467
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

175
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,678
We're not ahead of ourselves.
We're right next to each other.

176
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,268
This is awesome.
Like, way more expensive for no reason.

177
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,939
Look at Dickson's office.
Looks like a giant cube of ice.

178
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,858
How you bitches like Jump Street now?

179
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,192
Hey!

180
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,570
Y'all see this shit?

181
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,573
22 Jump Street is the lick.

182
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,243
And I got a big-ass raise
to babysit you two fuckers again.

183
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,871
Designed it myself. We got an espresso bar.

184
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,249
- I'm thinking about a shark tank over there.
- I like sharks.

185
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,836
Fuck a 21 Jump Street,
and fuck a Korean Jesus.

186
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,921
Cap, come on, Korean Jesus is right there.

187
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,550
That's Vietnamese Jesus.
See, this a Vietnamese church.

188
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,720
You racist, sacrilegious sack of shit.

189
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:24,558
Look at that.
Vietnamese Jesus just dripping swagoo.

190
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,393
And we got some new dumb-ass interns.

191
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,853
Hey, hey! Look alive!

192
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,938
- Boys.
- Yo, Jenko.

193
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,235
Hey, Schmidt!

194
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,782
Don't do that.

195
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,910
So, they want the same shit, so here we go.

196
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,371
Same identities.

197
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,790
Same assignment.

198
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,416
We're going back to high school?

199
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,001
Your ass look like you about 50.

200
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,421
- You're going to MC State.
- We're going to college for real?

201
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,758
Somebody's out there,
they're cooking up a new drug.

202
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,178
It's Adderall mixed with Ecstasy
mixed with God knows what else.

203
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,597
"Wipey"?

204
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,599
No, you dumb motherfucker. "WhyPhy."

205
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,395
Stands for "Work Hard? Yes.
Play Hard? Yes."

206
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,938
Now, these kids take this shit,

207
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,858
and they get laser-focused
for about four hours of studying,

208
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,320
and then they party like it's goddamn 1999.

209
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,988
Who's this?

210
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,573
That's Cynthia Watson.

211
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,617
She was a student at MC State.

212
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,868
She took some WhyPhy,

213
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,746
got locked out of her dorm,
ended up falling off the roof.

214
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,456
And now she's dead.

215
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,088
That's her buying drugs on campus.
And that's the dealer.

216
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,966
Find him and we find the supplier.

217
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,427
Sir, can I just say,

218
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,139
it is so refreshing
to have a case with a black victim.

219
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,933
I mean, we care so much more
because she's black.

220
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:53,021
I think what he's really trying to say
is that we care equally.

221
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,024
It's a tie, really, how much we care.

222
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,528
No, we're not.
If it was a white person, I wouldn't even care.

223
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,530
One less cracker-ass cracker to worry about.

224
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,951
Why every time you speak
I want to throw the fuck up?

225
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,329
Infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier.

226
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,841
You all right?

227
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,843
Yeah.

228
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,636
It's just...

229
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,850
I'm the first person in my family
to pretend to go to college.

230
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,227
Best part is we get to do it together.

231
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,147
What's up, college?

232
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,440
- What's up, bro?
- We're 322.

233
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,649
Fuck high school, right?

234
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,901
Fuck high school.

235
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,986
So tight!

236
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,238
This is so baller!

237
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,616
Beds... Shit.

238
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,826
Dope. That looks like cum.

239
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,411
That's cum. Okay. All right.

240
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,288
Already got cum on the mattress, dawg.

241
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,666
- Welcome to college.
- Fuck, yeah.

242
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,510
Hilarious shirt that signals we drink alcohol.

243
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,805
Some bacon machine that my mom got me.

244
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,849
I do not understand how it works.

245
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,609
It's true.

246
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,569
Super high-tech police gear.

247
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,240
Carte blanche with the budget, motherfucker.

248
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,412
I'm going to veto that poster.
It's a touch childish.

249
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,999
Okay. What do Lambos
have to do with touching children?

250
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,626
Lambos are lame.

251
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,712
I get one choice.
I get one thing that I'm not...

252
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,548
We have to agree. You know what I mean?

253
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,466
What up, fellas?
We're your across-the-hall neighbours.

254
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,218
- Hey, there's two of you.
- You're twins.

255
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,344
What's up, man?

256
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,888
We're the Yangs, man.
Kenny Yang. What's up?

257
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:50,973
Keith Yang.

258
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,391
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

259
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,433
Did you say the Yangs?

260
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,187
- Yeah, Dad's Chinese, man.
- Our mom's not Chinese. She's black.

261
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
She's like real black.

262
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,315
- Like Wesley Snipes black.
- Exactly.

263
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,650
We're brothers, too.

264
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,862
- No. He's not kidding. He's serious.
- Really?

265
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,656
- What?
- Like, one of y'all older?

266
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,243
Yeah, 'cause you got crow's feet
under your eyes, man. You specifically.

267
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,996
We're actually just normal college age.

268
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,039
I mean, even if you're a little older,
that's cool, man,

269
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,583
because, you know,
girls here love older dudes.

270
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,709
That's true.

271
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,460
Plus, there's mad fuckable girls here.

272
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,462
- Mad fuckable.
- Especially during spring break.

273
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,715
I love spring break. But I do have to say,

274
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,426
I've fucked a thousand girls by now
and I don't know, at the end of the day,

275
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,761
you just kind of want something
that's just a little deeper really.

276
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,098
Yeah, balls deeper. Jinx. Buy me a Coke.

277
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,893
Snap, we're still saying the same thing.
This is amazing!

278
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,646
Carrots. Pumpernickels. Glow sticks. Twins!

279
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,398
- That's dope, dude.
- That's so sick.

280
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,860
That's crazy.
We have that brother connection, too.

281
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,612
- You ready?
- Yeah.

282
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,196
- Pirates! Baby feet!
- Paper clips! Bananas!

283
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
- Sun! Anger!
- I don't know! Words!

284
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,533
- Quicksand!
- Shoes!

285
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,328
- That's hip-hop, man.
- Awesome.

286
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,662
That's great.

287
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,249
It's gonna be super fun.
All right? Same as last time.

288
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,710
Dude, if it's like last time,

289
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,670
you're gonna have an awesome time,
and it's gonna suck for me.

290
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,882
No. You're gonna have an awesome time,
too, because I'm gonna make sure of it.

291
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,216
You took a bullet for me.

292
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,719
That's right, I did, and it sucked,
but I'd do it again.

293
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,055
No way. It's my turn. I owe you a life debt.

294
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,431
Co-ed bathrooms.

295
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,475
What? Shit.

296
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,895
I'm not gonna take a shit
the entire time I'm here.

297
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,271
I know.

298
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,857
- Hey.
- How you doing?

299
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,567
Hey.

300
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,694
- What's up?
- 'Sup?

301
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:33,241
Just exhausted from inventing Facebook
or whatever website people our age use.

302
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,665
They still have books? I thought
they just put the books inside the computers.

303
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,292
Yeah, I guess the kids just use
the stacks to hide and have sex.

304
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,796
So we'll go to all Cynthia's classes
and activities, ask around about the drug

305
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,506
and find out who the dealer is.

306
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,759
- Yeah, it's just like last time.
- Exactly like last time.

307
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,927
Dude, in Human Sexuality,

308
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,263
do you get to fuck
or do you just get to watch people fuck?

309
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,057
Neither.

310
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,768
What the fuck am I taking it for, then?

311
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,815
Now, obviously,
we've all heard this statement before,

312
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,066
"First impressions are important."

313
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,610
I've got a first impression for you.

314
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,073
Oh, y'all like psychology?

315
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,574
Tracy Morgan.

316
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,287
Nobody?

317
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,833
Work hard, play hard, am I right?

318
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,672
You looking for some WhyPhy?

319
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,756
Yeah, man, that'd be sick.

320
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,216
Go to the police station,

321
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,176
walk in and ask your captain
to see the evidence room

322
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,344
'cause you're a fucking narc.

323
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,930
I think you're mistaken.

324
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,057
You're literally wearing your badge.

325
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,268
Did you really just check to see
if you were wearing your badge?

326
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,394
This guy's a fucking cop.

327
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,187
I didn't look down.

328
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,943
"Wait, Professor Jacobs, doesn't history
happen a long time ago?"

329
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,862
Well, history happens...

330
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,489
This class is such a gut.

331
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,074
Hey, you guys play football?

332
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,993
No, this is actually my laptop.

333
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,327
Yeah, I'm taking notes right now.

334
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,372
I'm kidding. It's a football.

335
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,457
Mr McQuaid?

336
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,751
Covalent bonds.

337
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,715
What has been the result
of the War on Drugs?

338
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,801
Why would you ask me? I'm not a cop.

339
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,097
Because this is a college seminar,
and that's how college seminars work.

340
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,143
Professor gets into a lively conversation
with the student.

341
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,188
Friction creates fire,
and that leads to lessons learned.

342
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,316
Well, it's definitely harder to get drugs.
I can personally tell you that.

343
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,945
The average price of cocaine
has dropped 70% in the last 30 years.

344
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,406
Then your dealer's probably selling you
some pretty stepped-on shit.

345
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,827
Mr McQuaid, college is a wonderful place.

346
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,623
This is where you get to decide
who you actually are,

347
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,209
instead of the person that
you're clearly pretending to be right now,

348
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,669
which everyone sees through, by the way.

349
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,590
You got to decide,
"Do I just keep doing the same thing,

350
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,761
"or am I gonna choose a different path
and question my convictions?"

351
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,889
I don't have any prior convictions.

352
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,393
Why are you saying this stuff?

353
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,315
That's exactly the answer I wanted,
Mr McQuaid!

354
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,651
I want you to question what I'm saying.

355
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,613
This is the basis of this whole course,
and that's the beauty of college.

356
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,031
You can say whatever you want.

357
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,699
You can be whatever you want.

358
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,619
I mean, I have tenure.
I can really say whatever I want.

359
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,120
George Washington was a black lesbian.

360
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,997
The Eiffel Tower is made of dildos.

361
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,416
They can't fire me. I'm indestructible.

362
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,878
I'm sleeping with two of my students.
Her and her. I actually am.

363
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,880
Now, just like you did before,

364
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:37,551
I want you right now
to say whatever you want.

365
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,511
Say whatever you want.

366
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,762
Fieto.

367
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,432
"Fieto," not a word, but I'm gonna accept it.

368
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,853
You can do whatever you want
with your life, Mr McQuaid.

369
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:52,649
The only way you can fail this class
is by not becoming who you truly are.

370
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,026
Please respond to my text.

371
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,240
Okay, we got time
forjust one more improv game.

372
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,659
For this one,
we need a ton of different suggestions.

373
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,162
So, we just need you guys to fill in the blank
in a sentence that we're gonna set up.

374
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,082
So it'll go like this.
I'm so hungry, I wish I had a...

375
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,167
- Tampon!
- Okay, but we want...

376
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,753
We want it to be actual food
so that it, like, makes sense with the game.

377
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,798
It's more fun that way.
So, let's try it one more time.

378
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,175
I've got to get home so I can feed my...

379
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,260
Boner!

380
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,511
You know what?
Let's just play the game, okay?

381
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,972
All right, so what would you...

382
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,473
Hey, that girl's in my psych class.

383
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,142
Damn, she's hot. Go talk to her.

384
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,310
You come talk to her with me.

385
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,229
Stop being a pussy and go talk to her. Go.

386
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,731
<i>All right, all right.</i>

387
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,025
<i>Coming to the stage, we got...</i>

388
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,737
<i>J. Bohnes, aka...</i>

389
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,572
- Hey.
- Hi.

390
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,616
I think we're in the same psych class.

391
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,826
Yeah. Hi.

392
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,328
Yeah.

393
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,749
<i>"Pills! Pills! Bills! Pills!</i>

394
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,586
<i>"Bills! A sign of the times that rhymes</i>

395
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,171
<i>"Amanda Bynes</i>

396
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,965
<i>"Drop that Raggedy Andy circus</i>

397
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,467
<i>"Circle jerkus..."</i>

398
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,719
- You guys are the improv guys, right?
- Yeah.

399
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,931
- That's cool.
- You're the guy with the terrible suggestions.

400
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,183
- Yeah, yeah. You're welcome, man.
- Yeah.

401
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,686
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>
<i>Lady J is gonna be up next for you.</i>

402
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,857
Cynthia, that girl who died,
she used to come here all the time, right?

403
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,486
This piece is called Areolas.

404
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,446
Did you know her?

405
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,990
Yeah, she lived across the hall from me.

406
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,951
- Yeah?
- So why do you care so much?

407
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,411
I'm... I'm writing a...

408
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,205
<i>"Greedy man hands!"</i>

409
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,707
...a slam poem in her honour.

410
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,376
Early stages, very early stages.

411
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:35,961
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

412
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,128
Wouldn't it be better

413
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,090
just to, like, plan the stuff out ahead of time,
make sure it's funny,

414
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,384
and then not say it in front of people
and embarrass yourself?

415
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,971
That's a thing that people do.
That's stand-up comedy.

416
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,473
That's probably what you should do,
because that stuff's funny.

417
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:52,519
<i>"My brown nipple will produce white milk</i>
<i>during lactation..."</i>

418
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:53,937
What do you think of this?

419
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,231
I actually think it's really powerful.

420
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,026
That's cool that you said that, 'cause
I actually thought it was really powerful, too,

421
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,946
when the one girl
was talking about her nips and shit.

422
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:08,368
<i>Okay, does anybody</i>
<i>have anything they want to share?</i>

423
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,452
Let's see what you got.

424
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,037
<i>Any more poets in the audience?</i>

425
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,455
- I...
- I mean, do you really do poetry?

426
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,666
I do, and I will.

427
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,750
- I got somebody.
- What?

428
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,545
<i>Okay, we got somebody.</i>
<i>All right, give it up, guys.</i>

429
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,005
- Yeah!
- Okay.

430
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,464
- Just go up there.
- All right, okay.

431
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,632
- Okay.
- No pressure.

432
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:23,758
- You'll see, it's good.
- Yeah!

I do. I hear you can get WhyPhy on campus
anywhere 24/7.

455
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,101
Do you think they mean WhyPhy the drug
or Wi-Fi like the Internet?

456
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,020
What...

457

Fuck you, brain.

458
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,110
How did we find the dealers so easy
the first time?

459
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,903
Well, his number was literally on a sticker.

460
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,196
Well, let's go find this guy's sticker.

461
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,989
I don't think this guy does stickers.

462
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,326
Well, we need help.
We need to consult an expert.

463
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,078
Yo, dude, you shot him in the dick, dude.

464
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,871
- I got him in the dick.
- Yep.

465
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,415
"Shot him in the dick."

466
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,255
If it isn't Turner and Hooch, in the flesh.

467
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,966
Holy shit, you are looking fit.

468
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,011
Hey, you should get some tips from this guy.

469
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,806
He's looking good.
Look at those pectoral muscles.

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,724
That's the kind of definition
I want out of you, man.

471
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,726
- What's up, Eric?
- Hey.

472
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,187
Mr Walters, we should...

473
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,398
Or I should apologise for...

474
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,985
For shooting my penis off?

475
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,069
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

476
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,531
Don't sweat it, brother. I'm liberated. Totally.

477
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:52,907
You know they gave me a vagina?

478
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,493
It's awesome. You guys want to see it?

479
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,995
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no, no.

480
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,539
- That's fine.
- All right. Eric's seen it.

481
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,916
Eric's been all up in that shit.
Isn't that right, Eric?

482
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,710
You guys got to get me the fuck out of here.

483
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:04,836
Hey, guess what.

484
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
I'm Eric's bitch.

485
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,338
No, you're not.

486
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,424
Yes! I am!

487
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,050
I'm your bitch.

488
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,095
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, honey.

489
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,222
I didn't mean that. You know that, right?

490
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,683
I am such a bitch when Aunt Flo shows up.

491
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,102
It bleeds so much, it's crazy.

492
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,730
It's like the elevator doors opening
<i>in The Shining.</i>

493
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,482
Your vagina doesn't fucking work, man.

494
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,401
Worked for you last night.

495
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,363
You are so clearly forcing Eric
into this relationship.

496
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,908
Eric, am I forcing you into anything?

497
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,451
- Yes.
- See?

498
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,079
Look, they sent us in undercover at a college
to find the dealer of this new synthetic,

499
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,831
and no one will tell us anything.

500
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,375
That's 'cause
you guys look like fucking narcs, all right?

501
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,627
College kids aren't dumb like Eric.

502
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,378
I was supposed to go to Berkeley.

503
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,048
Well, they gave us a picture,
so we do have that.

504
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,800
Well, that's your lead, motherfucker!
That's what you start with.

505
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,345
I know, but we can't see his face,
so we don't know who it is.

506
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,263
"We don't know who it is.

507
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,724
"I'm Schmidt.
My pants are filled with doody."

508
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,434
That's you.

509
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,894
That doesn't sound anything like me.

510
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,021
You sort of sound like that.

511
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,397
That doesn't sound anything like me.

512
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,815
"That doesn't sound anything like me."

513
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:08,942
It's not not you.

514
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,068
That doesn't sound anything like me!

515
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:13,154
Eric! Close your eyes
and tell me who's talking right now.

516
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,574
That's Schmidt being a little bitch.

517
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,409
That's just not a good impression.

518
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,162
Nice job, super sleuths.

519
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,164
Did you even bother
to look at the fucking picture?

520
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,666
Yeah.

521
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,209
There's a reflection right here.

522
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,420
Your fucking guy's got a tattoo.

523
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,006
Find the tattoo, find the dealer.

524
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:37,136
Fuck, man, I don't know.
I do a lot of stupid tattoos to drunk kids.

525
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,680
Do you remember that stupid tattoo?

526
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,181
A bazooka?

527
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,603
Think I might have did it on a football player.
Guy with a red Mohawk. I don't know.

528
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,105
They all start to look the same to me.

529
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,691
I think I know exactly who he's talking about.

530
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,112
Fuck you!

531
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,197
Fuck you, you little walk-on fuck!

532
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,449
I can't, like, move around in these things.

533
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,285
God, I love walk-on day!

534
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,536
Fuck, yeah.

535
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,123
That's a weird time to be Q-tipping.

536
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,250
You're all fucking pussies!

537
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,794
- Dude, you don't have to do this.
- What?

538
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,713
- I just don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm not gonna get...

539
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,840
Shit.

540
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,592
- Dude, I am so sorry.
- It's all right, man. Don't worry about it, man.

541
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,052
- Are you sure? All right...
- Yeah.

542
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,013
- Shit.
- I got it.

543
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,932
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
- That's fine.

544
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,475
- I'll get it.
- No, no, let me get it, let me get it.

545
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,102
- No, I got it. Let me just get it.
- No, let me get it.

546
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,228
- I got it, I got it.
- Let's just...

547
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,773
Dude, I'm sorry.
I got my Q-tip in your meat, bro.

548
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,734
No, man, I got my...
I got my meat in your Q-tip.

549
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,944
It's like a whole new type of sandwich.

550
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,904
Like, a meat Q-tip.

551
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,281
Like a meat-qute.

552
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,868
That's funny.

553
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,578
Hey, you guys want some of this sandwich?

554
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,829
It's a meat-qute sandwich.

555
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,623
Me and this guy are having a meat-qute.

556
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,002
You're hilarious, dude. What's your name?

557
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,004
- Brad. Wait...
- Brad.

558
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,088
Yeah, yeah, it's Brad.

559
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,715
- I'm Zook. Nice to meet you.
- Zook.

560
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,925
Nice to meet you, too, man.

561
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,927
Blue 20!

562
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,638
Blue 20!

563
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,599
Set, hut!

564
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,663
You love walk-on day now?

565
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,960
Your arm all right?
You want to take that sleeve off?

566
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,631
No, I'm good.

567
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,551
Dude, holy shit, bro.
Great fucking catch, dude.

568
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:41,677
Sweet throw, dude.

569
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,013
If you see that safety line up that deep,
though, hit me quicker.

570
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,015
Yeah, I didn't know
you had wheels like that, bro.

571
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,226
It's funny, 'cause he's my brother. So...

572
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,564
Hey, you know,
we have this rush party at Zeta.

573
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,732
I don't know if it's your thing,

574
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,692
but I thought, you know,
you could come by and meet the guys.

575
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,027
It'd be really fun, I think.

576
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,654
- Great.
- Yeah, maybe we will.

577
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,323
Are you guys, like, together?

578
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,325
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is my bro.

579
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,161
That's... Funny, dude. You're funny.

580
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,415
Really? Okay.

581
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,333
Yeah, man, sure.
You, too, you can come, too.

582
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,668
We'll see what we can do.

583
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,003
Also, I said a bunch of stuff earlier
that you didn't acknowledge...

584
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,630
- Great catch.
- Cool, yeah.

585
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,798
- See you then.
- So you won't address that?

586
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,007
What the fuck's up with that guy?

587
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,926
All we have to do now
is rush the frat long enough

588
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,054
to confirm that
Rooster has that bazooka tattoo.

589
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,681
Look, man, do you think it's cool
if you come?

590
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,308
'Cause, I mean,
he kind of really just asked me.

591
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,477
I just don't want to start off
on the wrong foot with this guy.

592
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,356
Dude, you're tripping.
We do everything together.

593
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,316
You should lose the puka shells, though.

594
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,069
Things are different
since you didn't go to college.

595
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,531
Yo, Brad! What's up, dude?

596
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,868
- Same puka, dude.
- You got the same... Puka bros.

597
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,411
Holy shit!

598
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,288
Look at him, it's, like, all the same.

599
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,789
Dude, you wear pants, too?

600
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,624
- What? Bros, man.
- Dude.

601
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,209
I knew we were gonna be connected,
just like that.

602
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,752
Yeah, why don't you guys
just tie your dicks together

603
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:57,837
and get married, right, Rooster?

604
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,922
Rooster. What's up, bro?

605
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,299
You look good, man.

606
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,467
What's up, Rooster?

607
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,010
- How you doing, man?
- Digging the puka.

608
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,386
Thanks, dude. I can't believe it's the same...

609
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,804
How you doing, Rooster?

610
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,265
Rooster is getting some pop.
Why don't you go check him out?

611
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,770
- You in the zone, bro?
- In the fucking zone, dude.

612
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,068
Hey. What's up?

613
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:22,695
What's up? I'm Rooster.

614
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,489
Yeah, no.

615
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
We've met before.

616
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,035
Really? I don't remember that at all.
You must just have a really plain face.

617
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,412
Yeah. They call me OI' Plain Face.

618
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,206
They call you that?

619
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,334
So, do you have any body art
or, like, any ink I could see?

620
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,044
That's a pretty random question.

621
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,963
Hey, anyway,
it was so nice chatting with you, man.

622
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,215
Nice to meet you, man.

623
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,342
- Yo, what the fuck, bro?
- Yo, what the fuck are you doing, dude?

624
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,468
- You serious right now?
- You...

625
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,136
You're being weird.

626
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,430
You've been weird.

627
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,392
It was just like, "What am I hearing?

628
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,811
- "What am I hearing right now?"
- And the psychic told you that?

629
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,355
- Yo.
- That is so crazy, dude.

630
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,399
- Hey, dude, you want to go see the roof?
- Fuck yeah, I want to see the roof, dude.

631
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,817
Come on, let's go, let's go. Come on.

632
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,236
Come on to the roof, come on to the roof.
Let's go.

633
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,159
Come on, you can do it.
Come on, come on, come on!

634
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,206
I miss climbing so much.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

635
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,791
All right...

636
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,797
One more time.

637
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,715
I'm just gonna go home.

638
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,467
I don't know parkour, so...

639
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,469
All right.

640
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,142
Hey, Maya Angelou!

641
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,230
Poetry, okay. I got it.

642
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,815
Make fun of the poetry major.

643
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,111
So, I guess you have no interest
in having a real job in the future.

644
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,321
- Absolutely not.
- No, right?

645
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,699
What about you?

646
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,325
I'm an art major.

647
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,204
Okay. So you definitely cannot talk any shit,
'cause...

648
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,999
- No, I can't. I cannot.
- ...you're never gonna make any money.

649
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,669
I'm never gonna make any money,
so don't tell my parents, but...

650
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,922
When I talk to your parents tonight,
I will not tell them about your major.

651
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,591
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

652
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,342
All right, art major.

653
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,012
What do you think about that?

654
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,891
I would say that

655
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,729
it's these two beings

656
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,398
leaning up against each other
in perfect balance.

657
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,860
If one were to fall,
they would just lose each other.

658
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,946
So it's just about support.

659
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,701
You can't admit
that it looks exactly like testicles?

660
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,204
That's exactly what it looks like.

661
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,710
So, is there someone who supports you?

662
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,797
No, I'm just one of those people
that really likes to spend time with myself.

663
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,634
Tell me about it.

664
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,845
I love to be alone. I am, like, the best at it.

665
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,723
I just love
when you're sitting there in a room,

666
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,683
and you're just there with your thoughts,

667
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,604
and you're like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm alone.
Would anyone ever love me?" or whatever.

668
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:06,484
And, like, "Do I know anyone who would care
if I just ever came out of this room or not?"

669
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,027
Or whatever and, like...

670
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,821
- I don't know. It's just peaceful. I just like it.
- Yeah.

671
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,533
Well, if you don't want to be alone tonight,
we are gonna go hang out at the art building,

672
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,744
if you want to come.

673
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,746
Okay, okay.

674
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,415
Okay. Okay.

675
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,840
I expected tonight would go
in a way that you wouldn't expect,

676
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,302
but what I didn't expect was tonight would
go in the exact way that you would expect.

677
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,471
- You know what I mean?
- Totally.

678
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,431
So you guys hang out here a lot?

679
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,351
Yeah. I mean, we're not into
the whole frat party kind of stuff.

680
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,186
We like to sit around,
just drink some good wine

681
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,896
and talk about some important stuff.

682
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:48,192
Banging bitches and getting wasted
all fucking day.

683
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,111
Those are, like,
two of my favourite things to do.

684
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,155
You are, like,
a slightly less attractive version of...

685
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,323
- Picasso?
- Picasso.

686
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,450
- Right? I've been told that before.
- You read my mind.

687
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,161
What?

688
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,391
That's Cynthia Watson's room.

689
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,604
It's only 2:00. I thought it was late.
Do you want to come in?

690
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:29,233
It's only 2:00?
I usually go to dinner at, like, 2:00 a.m., so...

691
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,110
Sure, yeah, why not?

692
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,115
I'm gonna do it.
I just got to get it at the right angle.

693
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,994
- Dude, stop.
- Stupid fucking goalpost!

694
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,580
It's impossible. You can't fucking do it.

695
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,083
The fans used to rush the field
after every win and tear down the goalposts,

696
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,252
and Coach hated it.
And so he cemented them in.

697
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,922
They storm the field, and still do it,
but they just bounce around.

698
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,382
Fuck this goalpost, bro!

699
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,595
You guys might want to hold on,
'cause this shit is coming down.

700
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:04,477
Yo, what is that?
The tattoo, what's that right there?

701
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,728
This?

702
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,523
It's my old high school team.
The Plainview Red Herrings.

703
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,649
Look at it swim.

704
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,028
- Shit.
- What?

705
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,781
Shit, that's a really outside-of-the-box

706
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,699
high school mascot.

707
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,534
Hold on, guys.

708
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,289
Hey, why don't you come to practice today?

709
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,833
I mean, you're obviously good enough
to play on the team.

710
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,795
Look, I'm not supposed to be here
to play football.

711
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,879
What?

712
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,008
I'm just here to do my assignments
and get out, that's it.

713
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,594
I mean, yeah, school's important or whatever,

714
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,930
but when I was throwing you those passes,

715
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,099
it was like I knew where
you were gonna be before you went there.

716
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:49,772
You know, I had this, like, vision of me
throwing bullet TDs to you, dude,

717
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,817
and then all these fans
just started going, like...

718
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,028
"Zook! McQuaid! Zook! McQuaid!"

719
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:00,407
And they were chanting and chanting,
and then the goalposts came down.

720
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,784
Dude?

721
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,080
I have had that exact vision,
like, my entire life.

722
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,541
- Dude.
- Dude.

723
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,584
- Bro?
- Bro.

724
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,169
- Dude.
- Bro.

725
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,462
Dude.

726
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,716
Like, well, we fucking can, bro.
All you gotta do is join the team.

727
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,056
- Yeah. Why not?
- Yes!

728
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,600
- Fuck yeah, dude.
- Fuck yeah, dude.

729
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,520
- What's that?
- My tattoo.

730
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,896
Yeah, fuck, look.

731
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,566
Look, it's me, Zook.

732
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,278
Got a fucking bazooka for an arm.
Know what I mean?

733
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,785
Dude, I'm so fucking pumped
you're gonna be on this fucking team, bro.

734
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,121
Yep.

735
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,460
What's up with it?

736
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,298
- How you doing?
- Hi. Good.

737
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,466
How was the...

738
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:05,222
How was the sex for you? It was fun for me.
It was a good time.

739
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,350
- Yeah, right.
- I enjoyed it.

740
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,518
Yeah.

741
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,896
This is why I don't drink.

742
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,316
Hey. How you doing?

743
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,775
I'm fine.

744
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,653
I mean, I'm not listening to you guys
fornicate all night long.

745
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,197
- Thrusting and pumping.
- Okay.

746
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,408
I thought your hip popped out at one point.

747
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,327
I'm just saying, it's, like, all fun and games,

748
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,121
and then you wake up in bed
next to a 40-year-old freshman.

749
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,081
I'm 19, so...

750
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,000
Nineteen minutes late to pinochle,

751
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,586
where you're meeting your old friends
in the park?

752
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,087
Yeah, that's what I meant.

753
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,716
Oh, my gosh, Maya, look at him.
He's still so sharp. That's so inspiring.

754
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,010
Tell us about the war, any one of them.

755
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,055
You're, like, the loudest climaxer
I've ever heard.

756
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:51,602
It was, like, the sound of, like, a 30-year-old
sprinkler finally going off for the first time.

757
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,689
Okay, well, so lovely talking with you.

758
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,150
You're a lovely person.

759
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,527
Nice to meet you.

760
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,738
Oh, my God.

761
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,406
She seems nice.

762
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,200
She's horrible.

763
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,160
God.

764
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,370
She was Cynthia's roommate,

765
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,538
and I felt bad for her,
so I told her I would room with her.

766
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,248
So...

767
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,420
So you probably have a bunch of stuff
that you have to do today.

768
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,172
- Right?
- No.

769
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,216
Okay.

770
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:27,221
Look, I just want you to know
I'm not, like, a "hit it and quit it" type of fella.

771
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:32,893
I'm, like, a "hit it, continue to hit it both
physically and emotionally" kind of guy, so...

772
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,895
Hey, Doug, you're not gonna be
weird about this, are you?

773
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,482
- No.
- I mean, you're cool with just hooking up?

774
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,485
Yeah. I mean, no.
I mean, I'm glad you said something.

775
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,153
'Cause I don't even know
if I like you when I'm sober.

776
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,156
No, I know, and it's like,
that doesn't even hurt, like, at all.

777
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,741
Okay, so...

778
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,578
I'm gonna... I'm gonna split.
I'll text you later.

779
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,624
Great, that was great sex. You're good at it.

780
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,251
And I'll text you, three to five minutes
or something?

781
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,335
All right.

782
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:19,898
What the fuck is this?

783
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,735
This is bullshit.

784
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,778
Are you two fucking around at school again?

785
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,655
Hey, we got to pay for this shit.

786
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,532
- We need results!
- No, no, no.

787
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,953
Look, we are looking aggressively
for this very specific tattoo.

788
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,830
Or the tattoo could just be a dead end.

789
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,958
What the fuck? It's the same case!

790
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,710
Do the same thing.

791
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,172
Well, it's not exactly the same case, 'cause

792
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,466
one of us got laid last night.

793
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,009
Schmidt?

794
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,553
Don't wake up my dick.

795
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,014
Flew in on the red-eye,
hasn't gotten a wink of sleep.

796
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,098
Damn.

797
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,725
We're talking missionary.

798
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,810
We're talking missionary.

799
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,481
We're talking when I'm on top
and she's on her back.

800
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,942
She's smart, she's an art major.

801
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,820
She can't be that smart.
She's a fucking art major.

802
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,448
- Come on.
- I will give you some daps, Schmidt.

803
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,950
- Give me some motherfucking daps, man!
- Come on, give me some.

804
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,368
- Give me some.
- Come on!

805
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,413
My Human Sexuality class
is blowing my mind.

806
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,332
Did you know
I used gay slurs in high school?

807
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,209
Yes, directed at me.

808
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,629
Dude, I am so sorry for being a homophone.

809
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,631
Are we gonna talk about
how weird you were today with Dickson?

810
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,592
Look, I don't think the tattoo means
what you think it means.

811
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,677
I mean, for all we know,
a lot of people could have that tattoo.

812
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,389
This tattoo? This absurdly specific tattoo?

813
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,308
Name one other person who has this.

814
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,228
For starters, Zook has it.

815
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,771
Zook has the tattoo?

816
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,855
I think it's pretty popular.

817
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,692
What the fuck?
We've been looking for this tattoo for days!

818
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,778
Do you understand
this means Zook is the dealer?

819
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,321
I really want you guys to hang out.

820
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,949
We have hung out.
He's completely ignored me.

821
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,202
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to
investigate your new BFF.

822
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,870
We're gonna put cameras everywhere,

823
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,747
and we're gonna monitor the fuck
out of what he's doing.

824
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:02,292
We can't just walk into Zeta house and just
put up a bunch of fucking cameras, okay?

825
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,712
There's dudes there everywhere.
All right, your plan is stupid. I'm sorry.

826
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,257
- My plan is stupid? That's interesting.
- What... Okay.

827
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,884
I'm, like, basically done fucking
watching your shit all the fucking time.

828
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,594
Okay, yeah, exactly.
I'm the fucking stupid one. Yeah.

829
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,637
That's really fucking stupid.

830
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,597
Man, it must be hard being so different.

831
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,976
We're exactly the same.
It makes everything so much easier.

832
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,603
Guys, can you just give us some space?

833
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,106
We're really trying to figure something out,
and we need to focus, okay?

834
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,983
You're not gonna have
trouble focusing, man.

835
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,153
Yeah, man, those Krispie treats
got mad WhyPhy in them.

836
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,947
We made a batch for the whole dorm, man.

837
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,493
I've eaten six of these.

838
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,203
- Then you're gonna be real focused.
- Be real focused.

839
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,289
In about four hours,
you're gonna be tripping.

840
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,791
- You're fine.
- You're gonna be all right, man.

841
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,501
Who sold you WhyPhy?

842
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:45,878
Nobody sold it to us.

843
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,504
Yeah, man, Cynthia gave us a butt load,

844
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,715
and in exchange,
we wrote her logic paper for her.

845
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,508
- All right.
- All right, man, we'll see you guys later.

846
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:52,593
Enjoy the food.

847
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,136
Maybe this is a good thing.

848
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,512
Since we're gonna be really focused,

849
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,599
let's use that focus
to figure out a way to get into Zook's house.

850
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,684
- You feel anything?
- No. Do you feel anything?

851
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,020
No, but I have a super high tolerance for...

852
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,776
I'm so focused.

853
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:10,986
I'm so focused, too.

854
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,575
- You don't have to be on top of me.
- Yes, I do.

855
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,118
- Why?
- Camouflage.

856
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,578
Go.

857
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,792
Let's go.

858
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,170
No fucking way.

859
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,173
Okay, so no? Dane? All right.

860
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,050
Out, all right.

861
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,891
- Bull's-eye.
- Bingo.

862
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,438
That helmet looks kind of lame.

863
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,398
You know what's not lame?

864
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,483
Safety.

865
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,757
What are you doing?

866
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,592
I'm cutting glass.

867
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:16,760
It's a laser pointer.

868
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,804
- It can't cut glass.
- What?

869
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,059
That's no fun at all.

870
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,186
- I'm so focused.
- Let's do this.

871
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,479
- I'm so focused.
- Let's do this.

872
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,909
- Give me another.
- I don't have any more cameras.

873
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,375
- You don't need to drill so many holes.
- Yeah, okay.

874
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,467
Yeah, that one's perfect.
Okay, you can do that one.

875
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,094
I don't have any more cameras.
I've said it five times.

876
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,391
- All right. Okay.
- That's the last of 'em.

877
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,727
Time to prove that Zook's the dealer.

878
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,061
Or not the dealer.

879
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,605
<i>Next up is Brad McQuaid.</i>

880
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,482
Right? Yes.

881
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,567
Yes!

882
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,612
Obviously, right? I mean, the guy's...
The guy's all-time. You guys, let's be honest.

883
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,282
I mean, like, he was opening up beer cans
with his eyeballs.

884
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:21,491
That's so sweet of them.

885
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,076
<i>So Brad... Brad's in.</i>

886
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,745
- Doug McQuaid.
- No!

887
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,997
He's a bag of dicks!

888
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,917
He's Brad's brother.

889
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:35,088
<i>He follows him around everywhere,</i>
<i>so I doubt we get Brad without Doug.</i>

890
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,757
That's not true. I have a serious girlfriend.

891
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,925
<i>- I got a bad feeling about this guy, dude.</i>
<i>- Why? Why?</i>

892
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,471
<i>I was talking to him for a second.</i>
<i>He's got a big mouth, okay?</i>

893
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,431
<i>I feel like he could fuck this whole thing up</i>
<i>for us.</i>

894
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,100
See, you're fucking this up.
You talk way too much.

895
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,436
That guy is harmless, dude.
Look at him, he's nice.

896
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,106
- He looks like a 30-year-old eighth grader.
- He's gonna be fine.

897
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,067
I'm just saying, the kid sucks.

898
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,861
Okay, and Brad. Brad could be, like, our guy.

899
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,739
He could, like, be a part of our thing.

900
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,449
- "Our thing"?
- Yeah.

901
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,909
I'm trying to hear them be nice about me.

902
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,036
This is fucking bullshit. Shit!

903
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,456
Shit.

904
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:10,916
Is somebody up there?

905
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,542
- Shit.
- We got to get out of here.

906
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,087
- Did you lock the door?
- I did, man. I checked twice.

907
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,480
Go, go!

908
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,482
I'm so focused, dude.

909
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,820
Shit.

910
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,825
Do you think he saw us?

911
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,369
No, you're just paranoid
because we're about to trip balls.

912
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,829
No, I'm paranoid
because it could be dangerous.

913
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,123
No, we're fine. Look, we made it.
We made it. It's all good.

914
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,583
Shit!

915
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:57,879
Help! Help!

916
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,340
- What's happening!
- What the fuck?

917
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,680
I can't breathe.

918
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,391
They made us!

919
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,351
They're gonna kill us!

920
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,729
Jenko!

921
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,606
Where are you going?

922
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:19,985
I think we're tripping.

923
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:23,905
Fuck! I'm having a bad trip!
We're having a bad trip!

924
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,991
I think we are tripping, but...

925
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,325
God, isn't this great?

926
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,202
My side's so much scarier than yours.

927
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,912
Shit, your trip sucks.

928
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,123
You should come over here. It's way better.

929
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,499
Okay.

930
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,337
It's some kind of weird split screen!

931
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,048
Hello, football.

932
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,677
Jenko! Jenko!

933
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,888
I finally got my Lambo!

934
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,223
Hey, Schmidt, look!

935
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,766
Look! Look!

936
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,738
My legs are tired.

937
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,076
Help! No more music!

938
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,162
You'll always be alone.

939
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:14,748
- Hey, Jenko.
- What?

940
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,250
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna go up for a little while, okay?

941
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,418
Stay, stay here.

942
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,462
No, I don't want to stay here.
I'm flying. This is amazing.

943
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,255
No. God. Don't go!

944
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,340
Oh, my God.

945
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,424
No!

946
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,384
- Stay here!
- No, no, stop it.

947
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,012
You're dragging me down!
Why would you drag me down?

948
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,347
- Please stay!
- I'm flying.

949
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,641
Stay!

950
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,395
- Wake up! Get out of the car!
- Shit.

951
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,439
Get out of the car! Get on the ground!

952
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,025
- On your fucking knees!
- Get on your knees!

953
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,985
- You already know, don't you?
- What?

954
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,279
- Do you have anything to say?
- Please don't kill us.

955
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:50,992
If you don't have anything to fucking say,
open your fucking mouth.

956
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,541
What the fuck?

957
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,708
Is that vodka?

958
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,794
Welcome to Zeta, pledges!

959
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,505
Yeah, buddy!

960
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:11,221
Pledges, tonight,
we separate the weak from the strong.

961
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,225
If you don't make it through tonight,

962
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,602
you're dead to all of us.

963
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,354
Rooster,

964
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,481
light the torch!

965
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,900
For Zeta!

966
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,366
Drink, motherfucker! Drink, motherfucker!

967
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,910
Drink, motherfucker! Drink, motherfucker!

968
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,751
Look, whatever happens tonight,
you have to keep up, okay?

969
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:42,836
I'm gonna throw up.

970
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,671
I know. Shut up. Go.

971
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,840
Ready? Go!

972
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,758
Here we go, here we go.

973
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,136
One, two, three, four, five...

974
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,680
I can't do it any more! I can't do it any more!

975
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,806
Twenty's the record!

976
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,183
Thirty-three, 34...

977
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,893
...67...

978
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,058
- You can do this, you can do this.
- I can't. This is disgusting.

979
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,142
- No, you got to.
- I can't do this any more!

980
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,728
And now, for my favourite event.

981
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,813
Fuck this. I'm not doing this.

982
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,939
- I'm not doing it.
- What are... No!

983
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,359
I'm not doing this, okay? All right?

984
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,156
Hey!

985
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,699
- Schmidt!
- What the fuck, man?

986
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,202
What is your problem?
You said you wanted to stick together.

987
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,871
This is what we have to do to win their trust.

988
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,791
This is supposed to be fun.
It's just drinking and bonding games.

989
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,752
- It's fun.
- It's fun for you. It's not fun for me.

990
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,464
I don't know. Maybe we should just...

991
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,094
Maybe we should just investigate
different people.

992
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,889
Did you really just say that?

993
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,350
Did you really just say
that you want to investigate other people?

994
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,601
That's what you want?

995
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:22,977
I don't know, maybe.

996
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,855
Maybe we should just...
We should just branch out.

997
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,316
Okay, just sow our oats a little.

998
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,110
Sow our cop oats.

999
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,736
Look, I have an in with Zook.

1000
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,697
We have a thing and it's good, and...

1001
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,116
I don't know,
maybe I should just stay closer to him.

1002
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,787
And you should do your thing
with your connections and channels

1003
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,706
with Cynthia's roommate.

1004
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,125
You should see
if she knows who sold her drugs.

1005
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,711
I just... I just don't...

1006
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,881
I don't like the idea
of us doing stuff separately.

1007
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,676
No, look, we can still investigate

1008
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,302
together.

1009
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:00,890
It's just, you know,
now it'll be an open thing.

1010
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,727
You want an open investigation?

1011
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,353
I don't know if that's what I want.

1012
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,649
All right? I just think it's healthy right now
for us to try it.

1013
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,403
Okay.

1014
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,864
- Yeah?
- Sure.

1015
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,075
Okay, so I guess
I'll just catch you later, then.

1016
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,664
You okay?

1017
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,000
No, you can't hug me right now.

1018
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:31,796
- Do you need money for a cab or anything?
- No, I don't need money for a cab.

1019
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,798
Okay.

1020
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:45,310
I don't know where the fuck I am right now.

1021
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,691
Hey, Lauren.

1022
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,862
I just want to get in bed
and watch Friends all day.

1023
00:51:56,405 --> 00:52:00,950
<i>Let's hear it</i>
<i>for your Metropolitan City State Statesmen!</i>

1024
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,787
<i>And the Statesmen take the field</i>

1025
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:07,457
<i>for the opening game</i>
<i>against the University of College Generals.</i>

1026
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:08,792
Ready?

1027
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,504
<i>And a surprise start today</i>
<i>for walk-on freshman Brad McQuaid.</i>

1028
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,048
<i>- Looks pretty old to be a freshman.</i>
<i>- It's the hormones in the milk, Bob.</i>

1029
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,716
Ready? Set, hut!

1030
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,844
<i>Haythe drops back.</i>

1031
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,263
<i>And connects with McQuaid!</i>

1032
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:28,144
<i>Who beats safety Will Glock like</i>
<i>an egg white in my famous meringue recipe.</i>

1033
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:31,856
Holy shit, he's good.

1034
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,276
None of you tell McQuaid that he's good,
all right?

1035
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,737
If you do, he'll leave this shitty programme.

1036
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,908
<i>And as the clock ticks down,</i>
<i>we've got time for one last play.</i>

1037
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:48,540
<i>Another perfect hookup</i>

1038
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,792
<i>Even their end zone celebration</i>

1039
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,336
<i>It's like these two share a single brain, Bob.</i>

1040
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,089
<i>That's right, Jim.</i>
<i>They both have one half a brain.</i>

1041
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,342
<i>And the crowd rushes the field</i>
<i>to try and knock down a goalpost.</i>

1042
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,635
It's not coming down!

1043
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,097
<i>Good luck, guys.</i>

1044
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,516
<i>Looks like MC State's</i>
<i>got a new power couple.</i>

1045
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,268
<i>Zook and McQuaid!</i>

1046
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:15,108
I got to get around you, man. I can't jump up.
I got a broken ankle.

1047
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,114
<i>Yeah!</i>

1048
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,992
<i>Fuck yes!</i>

1049
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,244
<i>- Yeah!</i>
<i>- One more!</i>

1050
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,997
Shit.

1051
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,542
Who is that?

1052
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,751
- Nothing.
- All right, ready?

1053
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,254
<i>Come on!</i>

1054
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,630
<i>Focus!</i>

1055
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:48,641
<i>- Come on!</i>
<i>- Do it!</i>

1056
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:49,934
<i>Fuck you, Arnold Schwarzenegger!</i>

1057
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,394
<i>- I'm so jammed!</i>
<i>- Fuck you!</i>

1058
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,646
There's a sock on the door! Don't come in!

1059
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,898
<i>Fuck, yeah!</i>

1060
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,566
I'm having sex with a human woman.

1061
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,318
<i>My God! Fuck!</i>

1062
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:04,657
- Hey!
- Look at you!

1063
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,742
What are you guys doing here?

1064
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,869
What? Are you kidding?
It's Parents Weekend.

1065
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:08,995
Fuck.

1066
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,831
Wonderful. You're dating someone.

1067
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,667
Thanks, Mom.
Listen, we're undercover, okay?

1068
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:15,877
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1069
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,129
Doug!

1070
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,631
Maya!

1071
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:20,840
- Hey.
- Hi.

1072
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:22,592
These are my parents.

1073
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,010
So this is the girl?

1074
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,888
Hi. I'm Annie. I'm your new mother-in-law.

1075
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,933
- Nice to meet you.
- Worst thing to say.

1076
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,267
- Hi.
- Hey. David.

1077
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,435
- My dad.
- Nice to meet you.

1078
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,520
Well, my parents are here, too.

1079
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,356
Maya, hurry up!

1080
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:39,275
Your mama done found a table she want.

1081
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,450
How do you know this person?

1082
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,744
Dad, this is Doug, a guy that I'm dating.

1083
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,121
- The fuck?
- I...

1084
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,248
How's your classes going, Doug?

1085
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,960
You...
We were just in the neighbourhood, and...

1086
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,712
I have an idea. Why don't we all sit together?
Would that be fun?

1087
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,339
Yes, thank you.

1088
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,230
So...

1089
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,065
Do you like weather?

1090
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,235
You two know each other?

1091
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,403
No.

1092
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,613
This is crazy, all these

1093
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,950
students and parents.

1094
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,244
Potential witnesses.

1095
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,454
How did you two meet?

1096
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,415
I love meet-cute stories.

1097
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:39,627
We met at a poetry slam, and then
he stalked me back to my dorm room.

1098
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,838
- Stalked her?
- That's so beautiful.

1099
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,006
Then what happened?

1100
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,466
And then we hung out
and we watched a movie.

1101
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:49,262
Actually, we watched it a couple times.

1102
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,515
This is bullshit!

1103
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,808
This fucking... Waiter!

1104
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,519
What can a black man do
to get some water around here?

1105
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,564
Give the fucking guy some water!
He's black! He's been through a lot!

1106
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,900
For the sake of your daughter,
please keep it together.

1107
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,236
I'm gonna need a motherfucking crepe
before I go crazy.

1108
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,905
I'll be right back.

1109
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,325
So, where are you from originally?

1110
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,952
I'm straight outta Compton,

1111
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,872
but my husband's from Northridge.

1112
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,291
Come on, man, hook me up.

1113
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,836
What the fuck y'all doing?
Y'all rationing around here?

1114
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,005
Come on, hook me up.
Two little fucking string beans?

1115
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,174
Give me the goddamn string beans.

1116
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,969
I want some fucking devilled eggs.
I like fruit. Don't you like fruit?

1117
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:31,763
I like fruit.

1118
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,723
But this pork shit? Got to go!

1119
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,475
He's really taking it out on the omelette bar.

1120
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,726
Shit was nasty!

1121
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,227
He's under a lot of pressure at work.

1122
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,021
What's up, playa? Want to go to the movies?

1123
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,149
I'll break your motherfucking legs!
Break your legs!

1124
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,943
What?

1125
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,696
How you doing, Mr Nice Plant?
Get your fucking ass in there.

1126
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,872
Hey, you want another beer?
I'm gonna get another beer.

1127
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,083
Yeah, yeah, I'll do another.

1128
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:17,934
Hey, look, man,

1129
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,812
you know you can always tell me something
if you want to get it off your chest.

1130
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,021
You know I'm always here for you, right?

1131
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,526
- What are you trying to say?
- No, nothing.

1132
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,783
All right, with everything that happened
with Cynthia and WhyPhy,

1133
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,536
I just don't want you to screw up.

1134
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,038
You don't think I know what I'm doing?

1135
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,250
- What?
- I know exactly what I'm doing here.

1136
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:43,876
Okay.

1137
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,003
I'm gonna tell you something, all right?

1138
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,964
- Can I trust you?
- Yeah, of course.

1139
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,806
I have a friend who knows a guy at UMC.

1140
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,142
He's a scout. It's D-I.

1141
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,978
Their QB, he's not playing well.
They're not happy with the situation.

1142
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,146
They want me to make a tape.

1143
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,898
And I want you to be on it with me.

1144
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,362
Nothing else?

1145
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,281
They had five guys in the draft last year.

1146
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,532
I mean, Brad, this could be our shot.

1147
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:19,120
We're like the Dynamic Duo, bro.
We're like Batman and Robin.

1148
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,913
But we're both Batman.

1149
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:24,667
What do you want to be, like, a stockbroker?
Or a cop?

1150
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,919
Dude, your ceiling is, like,

1151
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,422
so high.

1152
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:33,050
You can just bust right...

1153
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,136
- Just break right through it.
- Right through it.

1154
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,431
Right through it. Right through it.

1155
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,600
You really think I could make it at UMC?

1156
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,728
Dude, you could make it
into the Hall of Fame.

1157
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,813
No, dude, come on, that's you.

1158
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,773
You're gonna be in,
like, the anals of football history.

1159
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:51,402
Dude, you could make it
into the anals of football history, too.

1160
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,323
We're gonna have to tear those anals up.

1161
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,033
- All right.
- We're gonna fucking tear it up.

1162
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,284
I mean, it's just a tape, right?

1163
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,703
I fucking hate my dad so much.

1164
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,871
Do you have any idea

1165
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,957
what it's like to have a guy like that
telling you what to do all the time?

1166
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,250
I can only imagine.

1167
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:09,629
I just don't understand
what his problem is with you specifically.

1168
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,506
I don't... Jesus. That makes no sense to me.

1169
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,884
I mean, you are a perfectly good guy.
You're very honest and nice.

1170
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,345
Why does my dad have your phone number?

1171
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,014
I don't know.
Maybe the school directory or something.

1172
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,307
Let's do something...

1173
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,726
- Let's do something that would distract us.
- Okay.

1174
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,978
So we don't have to think about him
any more.

1175
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,940
All right.

1176
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,650
Maya.

1177
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,153
Is it okay if we just talk?

1178
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,323
Okay.

1179
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,158
Let's talk.

1180
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,993
- No way.
- Yeah.

1181
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,079
I was Peter Pan, but then I was, like, late.

1182
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,622
You're really close with your brother, then.

1183
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:47,250
- It seems like.
- Yeah.

1184
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,210
Yeah, you know...

1185
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,507
You're a fucking genius, dude.

1186
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,050
- Are you sure it's not too much, though?
- No!

1187
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,262
<i>- Yeah!</i>
<i>- Fuck, yeah!</i>

1188
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,180
- All right? All right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,099
- All night, bro. Come on. All night.
- Yeah, I know.

1190
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,433
It's gonna be so worth it, dude.

1191
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,060
It's gonna be fucking worth it,
I promise, all right?

1192
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,687
Dude, you know what this needs?

1193
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,272
Another star wipe.

1194
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,482
Jinx. Buy me a beer.

1195
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,775
Nice twist.

1196
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:13,859
On what?

1197
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,904
I can't believe we've been talking all night.

1198
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:21,117
Oh, my God, it's 8:00. I have class, actually.

1199
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,119
- Okay.
- I...

1200
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,247
Yeah, you can help yourself
to whatever you need, and...

1201
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,290
All right.

1202
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,542
Yeah, I'm so sorry, this...

1203
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,960
I'll see you.

1204
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,003
I'll see you later.

1205
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,796
- Okay.
- Best night ever.

1206
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,381
Okay. Bye.

1207
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:38,634
Bye.

1208
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,432
How long have you been there?

1209
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,101
Like, the longest amount of time
you could think of right now.

1210
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,854
This stuff wasn't meant for you.
It was meant to be private.

1211
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:54,108
So, am I supposed to just sit here and not act
like I hear every one of your problems?

1212
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,820
You got 99 problems,
but being young isn't one.

1213
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,407
You're just jealous
because Maya and I have a real connection.

1214
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,451
I'm pretty close with my grandpa, too.

1215
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,828
You're more messed up than Cynthia was,

1216
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,247
and she went to the school shrink
three times a week.

1217
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,499
- Why?
- I don't know.

1218
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,001
But he gave her a ton of pills and shit.

1219
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:15,004
Maybe he could give you something
for your weird old face.

1220
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,088
Okay.

1221
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,594
- Hey.
- You're late.

1222
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:25,431
No, actually,
I was busy with the investigation.

1223
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,394
This is Cynthia's therapist's office.
This is our investigation.

1224
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,730
All right.

1225
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,530
Watch the door.

1226
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,159
Is that all I'm good for?
Just watching a fucking door?

1227
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:48,954
Got it.

1228
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,124
"Patient exhibits drug-induced paranoia.

1229
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,379
- "Believes her life is in danger."
- Door, door.

1230
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:00,007
Hey.

1231
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,426
I wasn't told that I had a 9:00 a.m. session.

1232
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,387
Yeah, no, we're your 9:00 a.m. That's us.

1233
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,806
And we're cured.

1234
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,308
Thank you very much.
You're an amazing doctor.

1235
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,645
Please. You think you're the first partners
to come in here looking for help,

1236
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,273
only to try to run
when you're first faced with talking with me?

1237
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,775
How the fuck did you know
we were partners?

1238
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,318
He doesn't know we're partners.

1239
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,028
I suspect you're partners.

1240
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,864
A relationship is something
that requires constant work.

1241
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,449
Which is what I thought
we learned in high school.

1242
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,410
So you are high school sweethearts.

1243
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:30,162
I picked up on that early.
Please, continue the dialogue.

1244
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:31,705
Doc.

1245
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,751
I just feel like sometimes
he's not even trying any more.

1246
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,212
Like this isn't even worth saving.

1247
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,881
Okay. Well, sometimes I feel like
that we should be more like the Yangs.

1248
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,675
Or maybe I should be more
like your beautiful Zook.

1249
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,427
- Go fuck yourself!
- You go fuck yourself.

1250
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,262
- Okay.
- You're so selfish.

1251
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,264
- All right. That's a lot of fucking.
- Oh, my God.

1252
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,432
Given all these strong feelings,

1253
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,184
sometimes I like to have the participants
make physical contact.

1254
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,310
Why don't you hold hands?

1255
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,812
- Okay.
- I'm not doing that.

1256
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,940
- Do you see?
- Reach out your hand.

1257
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,150
I'm...

1258
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,026
He's literally reaching out for you.

1259
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,446
- He won't hold my hand.
- I'm not doing it.

1260
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,697
I kind of need you to do it.

1261
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,532
- He won't hold my hand.
- You...

1262
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,033
You got to interlock it, though.

1263
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,785
If you don't interlock it,
it's not hand-holding.

1264
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,288
- Fine.
- We might as well just be friends

1265
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:13,456
and not partners.

1266
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,540
Nice, right?

1267
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,168
Okay, you see this? This is strong.

1268
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,587
What I want to be able to have is this.

1269
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,547
Is this...

1270
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:25,759
I want to be able to have that,
that same thing, in, like

1271
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,887
without actually having to do it.

1272
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,473
- Are you embarrassed of your partner?
- No, not at all. Okay?

1273
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,475
And why the fuck
are you guys ganging up on me?

1274
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,684
Gang up on him. Okay, seriously.

1275
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,144
- Okay, okay.
- He's clingy.

1276
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,730
He literally is terrified of being by himself.

1277
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,316
Look, I know Zook's your buddy
and you don't want him to be guilty,

1278
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,442
but he's our guy.

1279
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,527
No, he's actually not our guy. I would know.

1280
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:46,197
Now, you know,
we sometimes cling to things

1281
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,157
because they're familiar and comfortable.

1282
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,909
I teach about a principle called embedding.

1283
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,494
- Look at the facts.
- Matter of fact, I...

1284
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,038
Zook has the tattoo. He knew Cynthia.

1285
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,832
I know the first time he met you,
you dropped a fucking sandwich on his foot

1286
01:03:56,917 --> 01:04:00,586
and he smiled at you,
but you are completely blind to the fact...

1287
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,047
- What'd you say embedding was?
- Embedding?

1288
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:08,844
Embedding is our tendency to latch on to
the first bit of information that we're offered

1289
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,639
and overlooking, or even ignoring,
contradictory information.

1290
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:12,723
It's a fascinating principle...

1291
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,808
Shut up. I'm thinking.

1292
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,020
You think it's possible that

1293
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,396
we embedded?

1294
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,023
What, like when we were drunk
or something?

1295
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,025
- We embedded each other?
- Okay. I'm gonna recommend...

1296
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,277
Okay, you can leave the room.
Just get the fuck out.

1297
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:27,029
Get the fuck out. You heard him.

1298
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,697
This took a turn.

1299
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:31,158
- One, two...
- Okay. Yep. Good session.

1300
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,411
The first time we saw the photo
of Cynthia buying WhyPhy,

1301
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,789
<i>Dickson said, "This guy's the dealer."</i>

1302
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,333
Everything we've done and thought
has been based on that fact,

1303
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,501
but what if Dickson was wrong?

1304
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:43,045
And we've ignored all the other clues.

1305
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,964
<i>What if Cynthia wasn't the buyer?</i>

1306
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,383
<i>What if Cynthia was the dealer?</i>

1307
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:51,178
Captain, we have something
really, really important to tell you about.

1308
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,059
Captain?

1309
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,310
Are you wearing Kevlar?

1310
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:02,356
Now, gentlemen,
we're not gonna sit here and pretend

1311
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,401
there's not a big-ass elephant in the room.

1312
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,860
What the fuck is going on?

1313
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,989
This is what the fuck is going on.

1314
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,914
Shit! Shit!

1315
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:23,752
Shit! No!

1316
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:27,381
That is not happening right now! No!

1317
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,801
Hey, y'all,
he's fucking the captain's daughter! Yo!

1318
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,929
- Every time he say that shit...
- Oh, my fuck!

1319
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:35,514
...that's another foot in your ass.

1320
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,310
Schmidt, you clearly...
Yo, this is the best thing ever!

1321
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,897
Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter!

1322
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:47,026
Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter!

1323
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,112
Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter!

1324
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,573
Shit! Fuck!

1325
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,451
You fucked Captain Dickson's daughter?

1326
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,453
Captain, what the...

1327
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,998
You bragged to him to his face.
To his actual face. Captain...

1328
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,918
Do you understand that this face right here,
you bragged to that face?

1329
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,714
You actually high-fived Schmidt
for fucking your daughter.

1330
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,090
Holy shit!

1331
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,176
Oh, my God! This is...

1332
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,054
It's really not that funny.

1333
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,473
I just want to say that

1334
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:22,144
it was bizarre not to share the fact

1335
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,688
that your daughter went to MC State.

1336
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:28,067
I think it's bizarre that
I haven't cut your motherfucking nuts off.

1337
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:33,614
What if Captain gets to punch you in the face
one time, really, really, really hard?

1338
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,907
Nah.

1339
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,410
I got something way better than that.

1340
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,124
You think Cynthia was the dealer?

1341
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:47,419
How the fuck we gonna infiltrate the dealer
if the dealer is dead?

1342
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:51,298
We have to stop treating this
like it's exactly the same as last time.

1343
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:54,301
And we got a bigger problem.
No more money in the budget.

1344
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,178
What? I thought we had Cate Blanchett.

1345
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,055
Cate Blanchett?

1346
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,683
Yeah, I thought we had Cate Blanchett
with the budget.

1347
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,768
You mean "carte blanche."

1348
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:04,478
That one.

1349
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,938
Welcome back, dum-dum.

1350
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:09,191
We did have carte blanche. Not no more.

1351
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,276
You got that expensive chase
in the beginning,

1352
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:15,197
that expensive equipment,
this fucking office...

1353
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,534
This look like some shit
Iron Man would have. Shit's expensive!

1354
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:22,246
I got on $800 shoes,
and you can't even see the motherfuckers.

1355
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,124
So now you two motherfuckers
is in the crosshairs.

1356
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,709
I'm warning you,

1357
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:30,504
find the supplier, but don't cost
the department no more money.

1358
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,551
Look, I apologise about the Zook thing.

1359
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,220
You were right, he's not the dealer.

1360
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,848
Okay, great. You apologised.
What's that worth, man?

1361
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:44,393
Now we have no leads.
What are we supposed to do now?

1362
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,602
Police work.

1363
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,611
Fuck.

1364
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,908
Don't throw a fucking
dead person's dildo at me.

1365
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,493
We're at work right now, okay?

1366
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:04,997
Kids don't check out books anymore, right?

1367
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,791
I don't even think they know how to read.

1368
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,212
- Library.
- Book place.

1369
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,255
Library.

1370
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,383
The supplier is putting drugs
inside the books in the library,

1371
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:18,343
where literally no one goes any more, man.

1372
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,928
And the dealers check out the books.

1373
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,972
We're going to catch the supplier.

1374
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,432
- Do you realise how cool...
- Wait, one sec, one sec.

1375
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:24,808
What's up, dude?

1376
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,437
Hey, dude, where are you?
We're warming up. The game's about to start.

1377
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,857
All right, man. Look, I'm just gonna...
I'm coming.

1378
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,108
All right, later.

1379
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:34,318
What are you doing? Don't leave me hanging.

1380
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,987
Dude, I got to go
or I'm gonna blow my cover, okay?

1381
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,407
You can do this alone.
I'll be back in two hours. You got this.

1382
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,419
You scared me.

1383
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,641
State name! Number! State name! Number!

1384
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,810
Colour! Colour! Number!

1385
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:09,436
This is the place.

1386
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:12,981
You'd think if somebody wants to show us
their operation, they'd at least be on time.

1387
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,235
Look at this crap.

1388
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,028
- I do miss the days...
- Shit.

1389
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,863
- What's he doing here?
- ...when people did normal drugs.

1390
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,741
What is this? Jelly beans?

1391
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:24,827
Crap!

1392
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,286
Set, hut!

1393
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,456
<i>McQuaid crosses in an end-around.</i>

1394
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:32,835
<i>It's a trick play!</i>
<i>These two are practically interchangeable.</i>

1395
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,671
<i>McQuaid throws down the field to Haythe.</i>

1396
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,802
<i>And he hangs on for the touchdown!</i>

1397
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,428
<i>These two are peas in a pod, Bob,</i>

1398
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,807
<i>but instead of little green balls,</i>
<i>they are human football players.</i>

1399
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:54,690
<i>Let's hear it once again,</i>
<i>MC State, for your Dynamic Duo.</i>

1400
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,945
Shit. My brother needs me again.

1401
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:04,074
Look, you know, loyalty's cool,

1402
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:07,452
and I admire it, and I know he's your brother.

1403
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:13,834
But you can't allow yourself to be held down
by a guy just because he won't let go.

1404
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,298
Yeah.

1405
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,427
I gotta take a piss.

1406
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:28,098
The kid's pretty rude
to make us wait like this.

1407
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,182
Can you shut it?

1408
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,768
What's wrong with those classic drugs
from the '90s?

1409
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,604
Heroin, you know, cocaine...

1410
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,230
- Hey, hey.
- Shit.

1411
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:36,315
I'm fucking here. You happy?

1412
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:39,318
The Ghost is right there, okay?
He's about to meet up with the supplier.

1413
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,236
- Hey. Check that out.
- You shush.

1414
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:43,280
- You're the one fucking talking.
- You're being so fucking loud.

1415
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,740
You shut the fuck up.

1416
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:46,742
- What's going on here?
- Shit!

1417
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,163
You're interrupting a really stellar blowjob.

1418
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:53,040
Fuck, I just came so hard!

1419
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,333
What the hell is going on?

1420
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,834
It's okay. It's just a couple of faggots.

1421
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,420
Yo, what the fuck did you just say?

1422
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,671
Did you just call us "faggots"?

1423
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,298
He said you were sucking his dick.

1424
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,843
It's 2014, asshole.
You can't fucking use "faggot."

1425
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,803
"Gay" is okay. "Homosexual," maybe.

1426
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,431
And if you know the person,
you might be able to call them a "queer."

1427
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,183
If they have a great sense of humour,
but I don't.

1428
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,102
I'm sorry, he took one human sexuality class,
he thinks he's Harvey Milk.

1429
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:18,065
Oh, my God. Will you please,
just for once, just back me up?

1430
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,608
Why can't you just use your head for once?

1431
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,360
You want me to use my head? Fine.

1432
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,739
Yeah, what's up now, motherfuckers?
You remember me?

1433
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,032
I'm your best night...

1434
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,241
I'm your worst nightmare.

1435
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,869
Man, it's my memory.

1436
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:32,621
It's getting worse lately.

1437
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:33,914
Are you the police?

1438
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,793
Yeah, that's right.
And you motherfuckers are all under arrest.

1439
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,295
Where's your gun?

1440
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,089
- What?
- Do you have guns?

1441
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,216
No.

1442
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,550
No, I don't.

1443
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,594
'Cause we have guns.

1444
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:53,058
Well, why don't you put your guns down,
and let's fight like men?

1445
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,269
Because we have guns.

1446
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:58,397
- Schmidt, run!
- Get him!

1447
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,190
- Go! Go, go.
- Go!

1448
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:01,608
Shit!

1449
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,735
How hard can it be? Shoot them!

1450
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,195
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1451
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,446
Shoot them! Shoot them!

1452
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,784
Come on, this way, it's faster.
No, just come this... Schmidt! Schmidt!

1453
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,162
Hurry up, okay?

1454
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:19,626
Schmidt, will you hurry up!

1455
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,294
Stop yelling at me! You're distracting me!

1456
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,090
Schmidt, come on! Let's go!

1457
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,467
I can't jump down!
I'm not, like, fucking Spider-Man!

1458
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,428
I'm gonna get the car.

1459
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,266
Stairs are so much faster.

1460
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:36,977
That's the car you got?

1461
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,603
I'm sorry it's not a fucking Lambo.
Shut up and get in.

1462
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,148
- Are they even still chasing us?
- Yes, they're still chasing us!

1463
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:51,366
Why did you do that? We were about to
catch the supplier. What's wrong with you?

1464
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,286
Look, if you don't say something,
people will never stop discriminating.

1465
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:57,414
Will you please do something
about how slow this thing's going?

1466
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,919
- Shit!
- Watch out, watch out!

1467
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,800
That is just like a little helmet machine.

1468
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,687
We can't destroy any more stuff!

1469
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,315
We can't waste any more
of the department's money!

1470
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,025
Watch out for that cash machine!

1471
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,490
- Which way? Which way? Which way?
- Whichever way's cheaper!

1472
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,241
Right? You went right?

1473
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,620
You could've gone in a parking lot,
you went to the sculpture garden?

1474
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:38,163
Do you know how expensive
that's gonna be?

1475
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,294
Shit!

1476
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,587
It's like they're trying to hit 'em
or something.

1477
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,298
I mean, it looks cool,
but, I mean, it's just so wasteful.

1478
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,636
They're destroying everything!

1479
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,055
Captain's gonna kill us!

1480
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:56,431
What are we gonna do?

1481
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,974
All right, we're gonna lose 'em
in the robotics lab.

1482
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,184
What?

1483
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,691
No! We broke everything!

1484
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,027
There was a lot of expensive stuff in there!

1485
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,404
Shit!

1486
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,698
They're going into the stadium!

1487
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,453
Listen, Schmidt, I gotta tell you something.

1488
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,456
I got offered a scholarship
to play football here next year.

1489
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,126
And Zook said
I could room with him, you know,

1490
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:28,213
so I was thinking that I could do that, maybe.

1491
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,967
What? You can't be a cop
and stay here and play football with Zook.

1492
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,844
No, look, I know, okay? It's just...

1493
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:36,012
There's no friction with me and Zook.
We're the same.

1494
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,306
Do you want out? If you want out, just say it.

1495
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,142
No, I don't want out, okay?

1496
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:44,312
It's just, when I'm on the football field
and I'm diving for a pass, I feel like I can fly.

1497
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,232
All right? And when I'm with you,
it just feels like you hold me down.

1498
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:50,193
I just wish you could fly with me.

1499
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,696
<i>And the Statesmen win, 34-14.</i>

1500
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,115
<i>And there go the fans onto the field.</i>

1501
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,540
Jenko!

1502
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,834
Jesus Christ!

1503
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,171
- Dude, the brakes are out.
- What?

1504
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,297
Get the fuck out of the way!

1505
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,174
You gotta jump.
You gotta jump, jump, jump!

1506
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,347
No.

1507
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:29,941
Fuck!

1508
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,246
Let's go, boss. We gotta go.

1509
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,292
- You did it! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

1510
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,004
You're under arrest, sir.

1511
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:54,466
Hey, I'm an officer, all right?
Just take me in. I'll explain later.

1512
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,927
No, no, no. Hey, he's a student.
He didn't do anything.

1513
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:00,222
Wait, wait. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1514
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:01,348
I...

1515
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,600
I decided for you.

1516
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,811
Just stick with football.

1517
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:10,982
I can't give you the same feeling
that these guys can.

1518
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,400
Maybe we were only
supposed to do this once.

1519
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,568
What?

1520
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:14,861
Dude, this is the fucking best moment
of my life!

1521
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:16,488
Let's go, man!

1522
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,078
McQuaid! McQuaid! McQuaid!

1523
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,469
Hey, Maya Angelou.

1524
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,680
Thanks for lying to me.

1525
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,819
Lam-bros! Yes!

1526
01:16:56,195 --> 01:17:00,115
Brad McQuaid! Brad McQuaid!
Brad McQuaid! Brad...

1527
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,581
- How are we doing tonight, sir?
- Good, thanks.

1528
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,709
Are we waiting on anybody
or you dining alone?

1529
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:13,962
Someone may swing by, but we can...
We can order without them.

1530
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:18,717
<i>We have identified and arrested</i>
<i>one Dr Karl Murphy,</i>

1531
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,387
<i>who was found with WhyPhy residue</i>
<i>throughout his office...</i>

1532
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,471
That's bullshit.

1533
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,473
<i>...and had a close personal relationship</i>
<i>with the deceased.</i>

1534
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:28,810
<i>Exactly like a case we had recently</i>
<i>at a high school.</i>

1535
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,855
<i>Exactly the same.</i>

1536
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,482
<i>The case is closed.</i>

1537
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,277
You know, like, what you're gonna do
after you're out of here?

1538
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:43,950
You're not supposed to throw rocks.

1539
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,121
- What?
- You're not supposed to throw rocks.

1540
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,800
The lobster for one person.

1541
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,469
Enough for one person only.

1542
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,391
I found something in this WhyPhy case
that caught my attention.

1543
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:10,143
Get the fuck out of my office.

1544
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,770
- Sir, you don't...
- We caught the guy.

1545
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:15,523
Yeah! Yeah!

1546
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:22,864
Hey, you want to do anything else
other than work out today?

1547
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,115
Like what?

1548
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,951
Come on, dude. They're just lobsters, dude.
Come on. No, don't be afraid.

1549
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,746
It's gonna claw your face.
It's gonna claw your face.

1550
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:40,048
It's gonna be like this, dude,
for the rest of our lives.

1551
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,034
- Hey.
- Hey.

1552
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,663
What are you doing here?

1553
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:14,749
Just came to see how you are.

1554
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,377
I'm doing fucking great.

1555
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:20,713
I'm the happiest I've ever been,
so I'm just having a great time with myself.

1556
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,091
I'm glad you're having a good time
with yourself.

1557
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:26,344
I'm a solo artist now, like Beyoncé.

1558
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:30,432
I used to have the other Destiny's Children,
but now I'm just

1559
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:31,599
a lone superstar.

1560
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:32,809
Happy for you.

1561
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,187
Just a light-skinned princess
with a dream and an amazing voice.

1562
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,313
That's great.

1563
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:39,149
How are you?

1564
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,860
I'm pretty great.

1565
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,863
I just chill and... You know how chill Zook is.

1566
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:47,198
- Zook's such a chill guy.
- Just like ice.

1567
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:49,701
That makes me so happy for you.

1568
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,414
So, look, I just wanted to say that, like,

1569
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,499
I was thinking about the case,

1570
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:59,377
and I was worried
that they got the wrong guy for it.

1571
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,964
- I don't think he's the guy, either.
- Yeah?

1572
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,632
I looked into the Ghost's background,

1573
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,261
and I saw that he pays tuition
for a student at MC State.

1574
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,138
You think the Ghost
could be the supplier's dad?

1575
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,264
Maybe.

1576
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,474
Okay, that's a pretty good
piece of information.

1577
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:13,516
Thank you.

1578
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:15,518
Well, I heard WhyPhy's coming back
in a big way.

1579
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:19,355
Someone's bringing a shit-ton of that stuff
down to Puerto, Mexico, for spring break.

1580
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,025
And if that happens, WhyPhy is going viral.

1581
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,610
It's gonna be at every college in the country.

1582
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,820
I think my information was stronger.

1583
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,406
Look, if you... If you want to,

1584
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,075
we could go down there.

1585
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,954
- Like together?
- We don't have to put a label on it.

1586
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:39,501
Just, like, one-time. One-time thing.
No big commitment or stress to each other.

1587
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,085
Just, like, one time, for old times' sake.

1588
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,757
What about school and football
and your wonderful new life?

1589
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:47,884
I have time off.

1590
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,387
I'm on spring break.

1591
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:06,945
Cool tingling.

1592
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:08,988
Got room for one of these babies.

1593
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,449
A grenade. Why you gonna put it there?

1594
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:14,285
- That's just unsanitary.
- Feels right.

1595
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:27,298
Missed a spot.

1596
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,311
You know this is just a one-time thing, right?

1597
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:42,981
I know.

1598
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:46,651
So you're not gonna be weird about this?

1599
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:51,990
Okay.

1600
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:57,662
Perfect.

1601
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,665
Spring break, motherfucker.

1602
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,420
- Did you not see that I was going first?
- Excuse you.

1603
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:06,963
- Excuse you.
- You want to go first?

1604
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,841
<i>Spring break, motherfuckers!</i>

1605
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:29,110
Hey.

1606
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,520
My gosh! I'm sweaty.

1607
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,314
You guys are actually eating stuff in here?

1608
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,024
That's so crazy.

1609
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:11,152
Come on, man, put your dick away.
Put your fucking dick away.

1610
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,987
Upstairs, upstairs. Let's go.

1611
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,366
<i>Okay, so here's the plan.</i>

1612
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,745
We're gonna get all these kids
at spring break hooked on WhyPhy.

1613
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,874
Then you're gonna bring it back to your turf,
and you're gonna sell the shit out of it.

1614
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,043
"Sell shit out of it." Do you see that?

1615
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:31,506
And if you rat me out, I framed
my psych prof just for giving me a B-minus.

1616
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:34,342
He's in jail now, so don't fuck with me.

1617
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:36,511
We're gonna build a nationwide network.

1618
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,805
- What? What the fuck are you doing?
- Be quiet.

1619
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:43,768
Why don't you sell those old classic drugs
from the '90s, like cocaine, heroin and...

1620
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,896
Dad, those are, like, old-people drugs.

1621
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,190
That's, like, what they did
<i>on The Golden Girls.</i>

1622
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:50,566
Like, Blanche did heroin.

1623
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,069
All right, I'll just sit here and be silent.

1624
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:55,238
Blanche never did heroin.

1625
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:57,740
Okay, so, Yangs,
you'll take my dead roommate's spot.

1626
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:58,908
- Cool.
- Dope.

1627
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,952
Are you kidding me, Yangs?
Are you fucking high?

1628
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,704
- Of course.
- Yeah, I am.

1629
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:05,540
Jesus Christ, have you ever heard of,
"Don't get high on your own supply"?

1630
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:06,749
- We didn't.
- Nah.

1631
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:09,210
- I didn't do that.
- Yeah, I used his and he used mine.

1632
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,088
Okay, well, now I have to make
a fucking example out of you.

1633
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:13,798
- That's a gun.
- Yeah.

1634
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:14,882
Who first?

1635
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:17,176
- You want to go first?
- I don't want to die.

1636
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,261
- You die...
- I don't want to die.

1637
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,012
- You want to do Rock Paper Scissors?
- Rock Paper Scissors?

1638
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:21,889
- That's how we'll do it.
- That's how we'll do it.

1639
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,307
Fuck.

1640
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:24,851
Fuck.

1641
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:25,893
Fuck.

1642
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,186
Yeah, we won't figure this out.

1643
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,896
- I'll shoot both of you.
- Darling.

1644
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:33,025
If you're going into the family business,
you will have to have a clean record.

1645
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:36,320
That's why we have these guys
to do it for us.

1646
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:39,282
Fuck. Jinx.

1647
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:40,658
We got to move right now.

1648
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:42,493
Buy me a Coke in Heaven. Jinx again.

1649
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,829
- Put your guns down!
- Fucking guns down!

1650
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,330
Doug?

1651
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,374
My name's not Doug, it's Schmidt.

1652
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,501
And guess what, we're cops.

1653
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,337
Oh, my God.

1654
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,006
- Yeah, everybody knows.
- Really?

1655
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:58,843
You guys look like the stars of a cop show
called Hawaiian Dads.

1656
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,429
All right, enough is enough. Boys, move in!

1657
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,723
- Do we have company?
- Yeah!

1658
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,309
- Drop your guns.
- Drop yours first.

1659
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:09,020
We have way more guns than you.
Drop your fucking guns.

1660
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,271
Okay, that's a good point.

1661
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,735
I mean, was this really your entire plan?
Coming in here with no backup?

1662
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:18,863
Or maybe we had a far more elaborate plan.

1663
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,449
Maybe my partner has a tracking device
in his pocket right now.

1664
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:22,533
May... What?

1665
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,035
You had the fucking tracking device.
I don't have it.

1666
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,870
That's the one fucking thing
you were supposed to remember.

1667
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,747
You're the smart person.
You do the tracking device shit.

1668
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:29,290
That's your domain. I do the physical shit.

1669
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:31,375
You know what,
I may drag you down sometimes,

1670
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:34,712
but every possible time
you can do something dumb,

1671
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:36,088
you do the dumbest possible thing.

1672
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:39,383
No, the fucking dumbest possible thing
is letting two cops blah-blah-blah

1673
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,803
while other cops are getting in position
to bust their shit in.

1674
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,971
So you mean I brought the tracking device.

1675
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,556
Yeah. What's up now?

1676
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,558
That seemed like such a real argument.

1677
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:48,893
That's improv, bitch.

1678
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,228
Move!

1679
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,314
Spring break yourself, fool.

1680
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,318
We shoot dicks off here in Jump Street.

1681
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,198
We're here, as well.

1682
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:06,077
We Jump Street,
and we about to jump in yo' ass.

1683
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,120
Right in the crack.

1684
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:09,789
Don't do it, Leatherface.

1685
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,213
He's got the drugs!

1686
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,054
This is so boring. No one's getting shot.

1687
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,099
Oh, my God.

1688
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,978
Did you just get shot,
like, right after I fucking said that?

1689
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,106
Can I have your gun? It's bigger.

1690
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,943
- Stop! I'll shoot you in the ass!
- Dad!

1691
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,904
Maya?

1692
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:43,447
What are you doing here?

1693
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:44,782
This is a shoot-out.

1694
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,367
You know what happens in a shoot-out.

1695
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,411
They always kidnap the girl.

1696
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:49,495
Not always.

1697
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,997
- Mercedes?
- You're coming with me.

1698
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,165
Bitch, please. I ain't going nowhere with you.

1699
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,129
- Now.
- Dad, what do I do?

1700
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,255
Is that my bathing suit?

1701
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,551
Just ask. It's polite.

1702
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:08,055
- You shot me in my foot! Wait!
- Move! Move faster now!

1703
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,975
I'm taking my time.
Shit, you shot me in my goddamn foot.

1704
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,436
- Doug? Doug!
- Maya!

1705
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,937
Mercedes just took my dad that way!

1706
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:16,606
Okay, we're on it.

1707
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,651
If I die,
I'm gonna kill both of you motherfuckers!

1708
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,404
Fuck. How are we gonna catch him now?

1709
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,491
Lambo.

1710
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,204
<i>- Policía! Policía!</i>
- Fuck off.

1711
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:33,915
Shit, there's Ghost!

1712
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,627
- What? What do we do?
- We need to split up.

1713
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,087
Are you okay with that?

1714
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,256
- Yeah, I can do it.
- Are you sure?

1715
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:43,966
I need to drive, 'cause you're faster on foot.

1716
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:45,718
What? I don't get to drive the Lambo?

1717
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,261
No, you don't. Come on, let's go!

1718
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:49,221
- But I want...
- Who gives a shit about the Lambo? Just go!

1719
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:50,514
- Let go of the fucking keys!
- I can't let 'em go.

1720
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:51,599
You're gonna have to take 'em.

1721
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,851
Take care of her, okay?
It'll be glorious, I promise.

1722
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:55,937
How do you drive this thing?

1723
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:58,147
You got to let her drive you, bro.

1724
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:02,485
I can't get in.

1725
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,155
Hey!

1726
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,657
Look where you're going!

1727
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,702
It's so confusing!

1728
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,211
Easy, bitch. My hands are hurting.

1729
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,430
You know who's behind us in that car?
That's one of the best drivers that we got.

1730
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:33,182
Fuck!

1731
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:34,558
Shit.

1732
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,061
Fucking complicated. What is this?

1733
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,772
Holy shit!

1734
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,567
You fucked up me driving a Lamborghini,
you dick!

1735
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:46,904
Fuck you, doves!

1736
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:57,915
<i>Puerto, Mexico, let's hear you get crazy!</i>

1737
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,505
It's like a Batmobile.

1738
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:05,631
Come on, Schmidt!

1739
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,760
Old man coming through!

1740
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:13,222
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

1741
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:16,058
Brad! Spring break!

1742
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:17,560
Look, I can't, all right?

1743
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:20,229
Dude, I got to go. I got to go.

1744
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:21,397
This is quite enough.

1745
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,858
You need to let me go and drop all this.

1746
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:26,485
Get out of the way!

1747
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:34,118
Tokyo Drift!

1748
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:39,832
That was way too fast and pretty...
Way too... A little bit too furious.

1749
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,376
Schmidt! Get over here! I'm handcuffed!

1750
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:46,380
Give it up, asshole! And nice parking job!

1751
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:49,175
Fuck! I'll be right back. I gotta go.
I'll be right back. Sorry.

1752
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,552
That's a direct order, motherfucker!
Come over here!

1753
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,645
You are so old and weak!

1754
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,439
Drop the fucking gun! Seriously!

1755
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,733
Get your wrinkly hands off me!

1756
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:12,198
- Where the hell have you been?
- Looking for you.

1757
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:13,991
I've been running like crazy!

1758
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:15,576
Hey! Hey.

1759
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:18,829
Want to fight like a man?

1760
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:21,123
Then you better fight like two men.

1761
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:22,458
- Hey.
- Hey.

1762
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,336
Really? More twins?

1763
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:30,257
Get up, Old Man River!

1764
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,384
- Come on!
- Hey.

1765
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,803
Get up and hit me, you fucking pussy!

1766
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:37,139
- I'm not gonna fight a girl, so just stop!
- It shouldn't matter.

1767
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,141
If you thought of me as a person
instead of a woman,

1768
01:30:39,226 --> 01:30:41,185
you would hit me and not feel bad about it.

1769
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,522
- Okay.
- Bring it!

1770
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:45,731
I'm ready.

1771
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,733
It's on now, dawg.

1772
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,527
Girl fight.

1773
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,322
Oh, my God.

1774
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,116
- Is there blood in my eye?
- Oh, my God. Are you all right?

1775
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,534
I think there's blood in my eye.

1776
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,202
Fucking learn how to hit!

1777
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:01,455
That's a little better!

1778
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,791
- That's a little better, motherfucker!
- Come on! Come on!

1779
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,713
- No! No!
- What?

1780
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:11,799
- What were you doing?
- What am I doing?

1781
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:14,135
- Why'd you try to kiss me?
- I didn't fucking try and kiss you!

1782
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,178
- Yes, you did.
- You're so weird!

1783
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:18,055
You're fucking Mr and Mrs Smith-ing me.

1784
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:20,891
I'm not Mr and Mrs Smith-ing you.
This wasn't a sexy fight.

1785
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,185
Like you haven't wanted to kiss me
the whole time.

1786
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:25,771
I never once wanted to kiss you!

1787
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,231
Never! No!

1788
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,482
- You just did it again! Stop it!
- Stop!

1789
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,151
You're making a face that is sexy!

1790
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,069
I don't even want to kiss you!

1791
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:33,487
Then stop trying!

1792
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:34,738
You keep trying!

1793
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:36,282
I've never tried to kiss you.

1794
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,659
- You gave me "kiss me" eyes.
- No, I didn't.

1795
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,744
The eyes were
"I just got punched in the face" eyes.

1796
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:41,871
They weren't "kiss me" eyes.

1797
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:44,999
- I don't even like you!
- Neither do I, so stop kissing me!

1798
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,417
Okay!

1799
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,794
No! You're leaning in again!

1800
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:50,504
I didn't know if we were gonna punch or kiss!

1801
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:51,964
You're making this so uncomfortable.

1802
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,675
This is the most uncomfortable fistfight
I've ever been in.

1803
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,635
I'm gonna give you an out
by punching you in the face.

1804
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,761
- Okay?
- Okay.

1805
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,973
And then we're gonna go back to fighting
and we'll pretend this never happened,

1806
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,391
'cause I feel so awkward.

1807
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,116
<i>I want to see you get crazy!</i>

1808
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:53,150
I fucking hate spring break!

1809
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:57,321
Fuck!

1810
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,119
Are you kidding me? It's plastic.

1811
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,621
- Doesn't even hurt!
- Okay...

1812
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:07,289
This isn't the spring break you imagined?

1813
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,125
- How about this? You want a little fun?
- What is that?

1814
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:11,335
Get wet, baby!

1815
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,379
So much lube in my face!

1816
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:17,258
Lube on my face.

1817
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,012
You're so violent!

1818
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:24,765
Get off me unless you're gonna fuck me!

1819
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:25,891
I'm not gonna fuck you!

1820
01:33:25,976 --> 01:33:27,643
- Are we gonna fuck?
- No, we're not!

1821
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:30,562
- Is that what's happening?
- No! I'm not gonna fuck you, ever!

1822
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:32,231
Get off!

1823
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:41,824
Hey!

1824
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:43,784
Hey!

1825
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,161
What? What are you gonna do?

1826
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,038
Choke me with your liver-spotted hands?

1827
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,207
You gonna push me over with your walker?

1828
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,417
I'm impressed you caught up to me.

1829
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:54,503
You probably haven't run that fast
since you played stickball in the field

1830
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,797
behind Old Pop Wiggleby's sweet shop.

1831
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,049
- Freeze, bitch.
- Thank God.

1832
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:00,926
Look who got off the motherfucking leash.

1833
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,178
- Now who's the damsel in distress?
- Fuck!

1834
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,055
Well, I guess it's him.

1835
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:06,849
I don't have a clean shot, Schmidt.

1836
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,977
- Then don't take the shot!
- Maybe I want to take a dirty shot.

1837
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,895
Kind of like the dirty shot
you took on my daughter.

1838
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,732
I didn't take a dirty shot
on your daughter, okay?

1839
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,152
We talked a lot,
and we care about each other.

1840
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:21,739
All the good qualities you have,
I can feel inside of Maya.

1841
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:24,658
- I'm gonna take the shot.
- Don't take the shot.

1842
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:27,453
I can shoot right through your shoulder,
hit the bitch right in the chest.

1843
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,330
- Don't take the shot.
- I'm taking the shot.

1844
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,999
- I'll take the fucking shot.
- Nobody take the shot before me.

1845
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,126
- How about we take it at the same time?
- No one take a shot.

1846
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,836
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1847
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,004
- Now, Maya!
- What?

1848
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:40,799
Shit! You have the right to remain silent...

1849
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,092
No, no, no, I got this.

1850
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,094
You go handle the Ghost. He's on the roof.

1851
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,429
- I'm on it.
- I got it.

1852
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,264
What you looking at?

1853
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:49,558
Good job on the cuffs, baby girl.

1854
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,276
So many fucking stairs.

1855
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:06,617
- It's me! It's me!
- Shit.

1856
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:08,285
You made it, dude. Did you get Mercedes?

1857
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:10,371
Yeah. All by myself.

1858
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:11,997
Really?

1859
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:14,041
- Mainly by myself.
- Okay.

1860
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,502
And, dude, you were right, that Lambo...

1861
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:17,920
Just can't hear that right now.

1862
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:19,463
It's a shitty-made car. It's not good.

1863
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,799
Hey, let's go. We got to go.
How many bullets you got left?

1864
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:23,801
None.

1865
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:25,427
Act like you have bullets, then.

1866
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,232
We gotta go!

1867
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:39,775
We have to wait for Pudding!

1868
01:35:46,533 --> 01:35:49,326
Jenko!

1869
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,339
Go, go!

1870
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:07,052
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

1871
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:09,263
- I tried to take a bullet for you, man.
- But you didn't.

1872
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:11,432
But I tried. It's the thought that matters.

1873
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:14,184
No, it's not the thought that counts.
It's fucking taking the bullet.

1874
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,731
Cover me. I'm gonna go long.

1875
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,400
Okay.

1876
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:48,177
Bye-bye, Terminator!

1877
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,859
Hey! Get off of my chopper!

1878
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:05,986
Can you shake him off?

1879
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,155
I'm coming for you, motherfucker!

1880
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,073
Come on,
just wiggle the stick back and forth!

1881
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,202
He's only got one arm!

1882
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:15,496
I only need one arm to punch you in the dick.

1883
01:37:16,915 --> 01:37:18,332
Shake him off! Shake him off!

1884
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:20,584
Don't be a pussy!

1885
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:53,575
Holy shit!

1886
01:37:53,952 --> 01:37:55,452
I did it!

1887
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,287
I look so fucking badass!

1888
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:58,580
Oh, my God, you flew!

1889
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:00,791
- This is crazy!
- You made the leap, man!

1890
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,460
- Why'd you do that?
- 'Cause you did it!

1891
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,128
I couldn't leave you hanging, man!

1892
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,713
What are you talking about? I was fine.
I had it.

1893
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:07,798
You weren't...

1894
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:17,057
- I got you!
- Shit! Schmidt!

1895
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:18,183
I got you!

1896
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:19,601
You saved my life!

1897
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:33,699
I just realised something.

1898
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:36,910
You don't hold me down, man.
You lift me up.

1899
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,371
Literally and figuratively.

1900
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:40,831
Yeah, I know. I meant both.

1901
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:43,041
You don't drag me down, either, man.

1902
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:44,626
I mean, except right now.

1903
01:38:44,794 --> 01:38:47,045
You're dragging me down.
You're really heavy.

1904
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:50,424
Hey, listen, there's a grenade in my shorts.
Can you reach it?

1905
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:52,301
You gotta go in from underneath.

1906
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:53,677
Shit!

1907
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,307
- Is that it?
- That's my dick.

1908
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:00,642
- What about that?
- That's my dick also.

1909
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,062
Why is it hard?

1910
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:05,647
I have so much adrenaline right now!

1911
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,108
- Is that it?
- You're tickling me.

1912
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:09,276
I can't find it!

1913
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,444
That's it! Grab it!

1914
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:14,615
- Yes!
- No, I got it in my mouth.

1915
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,241
Say something cool when you throw it!

1916
01:39:16,326 --> 01:39:18,327
One, two, three!

1917
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,372
Something cool!

1918
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:28,629
They're gone!

1919
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:31,798
Oh, I feel so...

1920
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:09,044
- We did it!
- Dude, fuck, I'm...

1921
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:10,420
Shit, sorry.

1922
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,423
- Dude, I miss you so much, man.
- I miss you, too.

1923
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:18,011
You were like a tiny little flower seed
and I was clenching you in my fist.

1924
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:20,597
But a flower, it can't grow in a fist.

1925
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:23,809
A little seed needs to fly away free
and find its soil.

1926
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:26,603
Yeah, I know.
I tried to soil myself and, dude, I didn't like it.

1927
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:31,441
I wanted a relationship without friction.
Dude, you need friction to create fire.

1928
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:34,069
And that's what we have, we have fire.

1929
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:36,613
Dude, I'm in. I'm all in.

1930
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:37,698
Thank God.

1931
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,909
Dude, this is what I've always wanted.
Just me and you, buddy.

1932
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,954
- I love you.
- Me, too, man. I love you, man.

1933
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:49,793
You know what?
That's who he should be with, man.

1934
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:52,671
What?

1935
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:55,632
Hey, what'd you say
when you threw the grenade up there?

1936
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:56,717
I said, "Something cool."

1937
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,051
What did you say?

1938
01:40:58,136 --> 01:40:59,845
- It was "Something cool."
- No, but what'd you say?

1939
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:01,596
Yeah, I know. I said, "Something cool."

1940
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:07,269
I didn't expect spring break to be this stinky.

1941
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:08,687
It's pretty gross.

1942
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:11,732
Man, we're getting too old for this shit.

1943
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,443
We started off too old for this shit.

1944
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:16,903
You ain't lying about that.

1945
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:22,492
Dude, we're even about the arm thing, okay?
Right?

1946
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,161
What? What do you want to do?

1947
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:25,245
- Don't move.
- Fuck. All right.

1948
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:27,205
- Just get it over with, all right?
- Don't move.

1949
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:28,540
- One...
- Just graze my arm.

1950
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:30,167
- I don't want you to hit the bone.
- ...two,

1951
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,334
three.

1952
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:33,837
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Shit!

1953
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,338
- Oh, my God, are you all right?
- Shit!

1954
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:37,424
Why, man?
Why am I always getting hurt around you?

1955
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:38,717
- Jenko, what are you doing?
- Fuck you.

1956
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,469
- Fuck you, Schmidt.
- Stop dicking around.

1957
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:42,429
- Hey, Cap.
- Congratulations, you two.

1958
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:45,724
You managed to un-fuck up the situation
you originally fucked up.

1959
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:46,850
Thanks.

1960
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,437
I wish you can un-fuck my daughter,
but I'm gonna let that be the past.

1961
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,647
Now, for your next mission,

1962
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:56,067
you two sons of bitches
are going to medical school.

1963
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:57,152
What?

1964
01:42:07,497 --> 01:42:09,623
This time, foreign exchange students.

1965
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:10,791
- Awesome.
- Yes!

1966
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:11,875
In Russia.

1967
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:13,335
What?

1968
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,672
Vodka soda.

1969
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,347
Next assignment. A semester at sea.

1970
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:41,071
You two sons of bitches
are going to culinary school.

1971
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,697
There's a microchip in this empanada.

1972
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:44,449
Old family recipe.

1973
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,284
Best to keep it a secret.

1974
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,080
Shit!

1975
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:01,508
New assignment...

1976
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,510
Cap, does Schmidt look any different to you?

1977
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,470
No. That's Schmidt.

1978
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:08,390
I don't know what you're talking about, man.
He look exactly the same to me.

1979
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:09,683
I got new glasses.

1980
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:12,352
Yeah, man, he just got some
new glasses, man. God damn.

1981
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:13,812
No one's gonna fucking notice.

1982
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,315
Let's do this, Schmidt.

1983
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,193
Yeah. Just like we always do, Jenkins.

1984
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:22,362
- It's Jenko.
- Sorry.

1985
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:32,789
I'm really, really glad you're back, Schmidt.

1986
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,541
What are you talking about?
What contract dispute?

1987
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:36,334
I've been here the whole time.

1988
01:43:36,711 --> 01:43:37,711
Man, shut the fuck up.

1989
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:39,588
How about a flight academy?

1990
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:53,977
Undercoverjust got a whole lot sexier.

1991
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:03,695
You're Jump Street, right?

1992
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:05,280
Yeah. How the fuck do you know that?

1993
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:06,781
I'm Booker.

1994
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,783
Shit. Man, you're a legend.

1995
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:16,041
Traffic school!

1996
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:18,084
Military school.

1997
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:19,961
Scuba class.

1998
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:21,838
Dance academy.

1999
01:44:21,923 --> 01:44:23,006
Yes.

2000
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,508
Finally something I'm amazing at.

2001
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,811
<i>You sons of bitches</i>
<i>is gonna be in a video game.</i>

2002
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:40,023
<i>- Let's blow shit up.</i>
<i>- Jump Street style.</i>

2003
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,115
<i>Get ready for a lifetime</i>
<i>of being badass motherfuckers.</i>

2004
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:51,785
