00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,900
行 那我只能拖着你
All right, fine, I guess I'll just drag you.

143
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,600
我要死了
I'm gonna die!

144
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,320
你死不了 快起来 到上面来
You're not gonna die. Just get the fuck up here!

145
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,560
把你自己拉上来
Pull yourself up here.

146
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,380
用你的腰力
Use your core!

147
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,620
 上来了 上来了 快来 快来 好
You got it, you got it. Come on, come on. Yeah!

148
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,900
好了 你能自己站起来吗？  - 能？
All right. Think you can stand on your own now? Yes!

149
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,080
应该甩掉他们了
I think we lost them.

150
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,000
靠
Shit!

151
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,830
他妈的终结者吗
He's the fucking Terminator!

152
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,620
很他妈的危险
That's fucking dangerous!

153
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,680
你 被 捕 了
You are under arrest!

154
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,140
把卡车停下
Pull the truck over!

155
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,510
我说把他妈的卡车给我停下
I said pull the fucking truck over right fucking now!

156
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,370
你欠我一辆车
You owe me a car,

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,570
你最好赔我一辆兰博基尼 贱人
and it'd better be a fucking lamborghini, you bitch!

158
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,560
我站起来了
I did it!

159
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,860
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

160
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,600
我 靠
Oh, shit!

161
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,220
我勒个大操
Holy Moses!

162
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,670
靠
Schmidt: Shit.

163
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,990
怎么回事？
Jenko: What happened?

164
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,470
我想他们跑了
Schmidt: I think they got away.

165
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,860
那是吻痕吗？
Is that a hickey?

166
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,040
这些其实是搞章鱼的时候弄的
Oh. This was actually an octopus-related incident.

167
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,760
我打开箱子章鱼跳到我的脸上
I'd opened a crate and the octopus had leapt onto my face.

168
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,370
明显 它们有很多触手
Apparently, they have many, many arms.

169
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,540
它们有八个触角
They have eight tentacles.

170
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,660
对 还有...
Yes, and...

171
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,960
听好了 废物
Look, ladies,

172
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,280
没人关心龙虎局刚开始时能怎么样
nobody gave a shit about the jump street reboot when you first came on.

173
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,840
脑子没进水的人 包括我自己
Anyone with half a brain, myself included,

174
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,300
都认为这注定要失败
thought it was destined to fail spectacularly.

175
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,210
不过你们很幸运
But you got lucky.

176
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,280
现在这个部门有了资金
So now this department has invested

177
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,010
投很多钱确保龙虎局继续下去
a lot of money to make sure jump street keeps going.

178
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,720
我们增加了一倍的预算
We've doubled their budget.

179
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,080
花两倍的钱要有保证两倍的回馈
As if spending twice the money guaranteed twice the profit.

180
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,280
说的跟真的一样
Like that's going to work.

181
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,680
是啊 上级认为这次之所以失败
Yeah. Well, the commissioner's convinced this debacle happened

182
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,560
因为你没有同样去做学生卧底
because you weren't doing the same undercover student thing

183
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,900
你们第一次是那样
you did the first time.

184
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,600
她不知道第二次一般都很糟糕
She doesn't get that it's always worse the second time around.

185
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,100
你适应的角色
You settle into worn-out roles.

186
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,770
一个有控制欲 一个容易失控
One gets possessive, the other runs away.

187
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,970
你们慢慢会感觉到痛苦
You begin a slow, painful unraveling,

188
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,510
在所有的情况转好之前
as all the good things that came before

189
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,460
就会被悲痛击碎然后分开
begin to be crushed by the trash compactor of sadness.

190
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,270
听起来不像是我们 我的意思是...
That doesn't sound like us. I mean...

191
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,620
这是老司机的经验
I'm getting a divorce.

192
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,420
我们不想做同样的事情
We don't want to do the same thing.

193
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,830
我们想不断突破
We want to burst through our ceiling.

194
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,160
找到突破点
And you're gonna find another ceiling

195
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,390
然后你去突破它
and you got to bust through that one,

196
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,410
你就不断的捶打就行了
and you just got to keep hammering ceilings.

197
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,660
行了 行了 行了
Okay, okay, okay.

198
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,070
我们可以进入特勤处
What if we actually went into the secret service

199
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,540
去守卫白宫
and, like, tried to protect the white house?

200
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,700
我不认为那样可行
I think... I don't think that would work.

201
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,440
我要求你们俩别在说了
I'm going to ask you to stop talking.

202
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,650
我觉得那是很不错的点子
I thought it was a pretty good idea.

203
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,820
做像上次一样的事情 对大家都好
Do the same thing as last time, everyone's happy.

204
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,220
韩国人竟然把教堂买回去了
I can't believe the Koreans bought their church back.

205
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,380
是啊 好事是有个更大些
Yeah. Good thing there was an even bigger

206
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,050
就在原单位的对面
abandoned church directly across the street.

207
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,490
是啊 这倒是很方便  - 是很方便
Yeah. That's convenient. Yes, it is convenient.

208
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,780
明年 我们大概还会回到对面
Next year, we'll probably just be right back across the street.

209
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,540
旁边的那个门
Just next door.

210
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,500
还是不要高估自己
(Scoffs) Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

211
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,670
我们没有高估自己
We're not ahead of ourselves.

212
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,660
我们一个一个的来
We're right next to each other.

213
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,570
太牛叉了  有钱就是不一样
This is awesome. Like, way more expensive for no reason.

214
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,200
看看dickson的办公室
Look at dickson's office.

215
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,200
像一个巨大的冰柜
Looks like a giant cube of ice.

216
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,060
你们俩混小子现在喜欢龙虎局了吧？
How you bitches like jump street now?

217
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,280
看见这些了吗？
Y'all see this shit?

218
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,580
22号龙虎局有钱
22 jump street is the lick.

219
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,240
我也升职了
And I got a big-ass raise

220
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,620
照看你俩混小子
to babysit you two fuckers again.

221
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,060
我自己设计的  这有咖啡吧
Designed it myself. We got an espresso bar.

222
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,200
我想在这弄个鲨鱼池
I'm thinking about a shark tank over there.

223
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,330
哦 我喜欢鲨鱼
Ooh, I like sharks.

224
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,100
去他妈的21号警局 去他妈的韩国耶稣
Fuck a 21 jump street, and fuck a Korean Jesus.

225
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,000
说什么呢 韩国耶稣不就在这吗
Whoa! Cap, come on, Korean Jesus is right there.

226
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,860
这是越南耶稣
Dickson: That's vietnamese Jesus.

227
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,840
看见了吧 这里是越南教堂
See, this a vietnamese church.

228
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,360
你个种族主义 亵渎神明
You racist, sacrilegious sack of shit.

229
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,690
看看 越南耶稣都要哭了
Look at that. Vietnamese Jesus just dripping swagoo.

230
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,770
我们还有新蠢货加入
And we got some new dumb-ass interns.

231
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,010
嘿 嘿 看这边
Hey, hey! Look alive! Huh?

232
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,220
伙计们 - 呦是 jenko
Boys. Yo, jenko.

233
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,960
嘿 schmidt!
Hey, schmidt!

234
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,300
别玩了
Don't do that.

235
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,910
好 你要同样的案子 给你
So, they want the same shit, so here we go.

236
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,540
同样的身份
Same identities.

237
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,030
同样的任务
Same assignment.

238
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,300
我们又要去高中了?
Jenko: We're going back to high school?

239
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,470
你俩看起来有50岁了
Your ass look like you about 50.

240
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,150
你们要去美罗城大学
You're going to mc state.

241
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,640
我们真的要去大学了
We're going to college for real?

242
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,810
有人来这 制作了新毒品
Somebody's out there, they're cooking up a new drug.

243
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,490
混合了阿得拉和摇头丸 还有不知道什么玩意
It's Adderall mixed with ecstasy mixed with God knows what else.

244
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,780
Jenko: "Wipey"?

245
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,050
不是 你个蠢货是Whyphy
No, you dumb motherfucker. "Whyphy."

246
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,520
让人精神百倍 玩命的去玩
Stands for "work hard? Yes. Play hard? Yes."

247
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,500
现在 学生买这些东西
Now, these kids take this shit,

248
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,960
他们只专注4个小时去学习
and they get laser-focused for about four hours of studying,

249
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,450
他们开派对像回到了1999年
and then they party like it's goddamn 1999.

250
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,230
这是谁？
Schmidt: Who's this?

251
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800
那是 Cynthia Watson
That's Cynthia Watson.

252
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,640
美罗城大学的学生
She was a student at mc state.

253
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,870
她吃了whyphy
She took some whyphy,

254
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,140
自己锁在宿舍里
got locked out of her dorm,

255
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,540
最后从屋顶上摔下来
ended up falling off the roof.

256
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,000
现在她已经死了
And now she's dead.

257
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,850
这是她在校园买毒品时
That's her buying drugs on campus.

258
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,550
旁边的就是卖家
And that's the dealer.

259
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,020
找到他就找到供货商了
Find him and we find the supplier.

260
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,300
长官 我能说
Sir, can I just say,

261
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,200
很振奋能这么关心一个黑人受害者
it is so refreshing to have a case with a black victim.

262
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,190
我们更加关心 是因为她是黑人
I mean, we care so much more because she's black.

263
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,520
我觉得他是想说
I think what he's really trying to say

264
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,970
我们同样关心
is that we care equally.

265
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,870
平等对待 我们有多关心
It's a tie, really, how much we care.

266
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,810
不是这样 要白人我看都不看
Uh... no, we're not. If it was a white person, I wouldn't even care.

267
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,630
少了一个白种废物 有什么大不了的
One less cracker-ass cracker to worry about.

268
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,160
为什么你们俩每次说话 我都想打人
Why every time you speak I want to throw the fuck up?

269
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,230
查找卖家 找到供货商
Infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier.

270
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,140
 ¶ ¶

271
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,120
你还好吗？
You all right?

272
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,730
很好
Yeah.

273
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,300
只是
It's just...

274
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,960
我是我们家第一个假装进入大学的
I'm the first person in my family to pretend to go to college.

275
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,010
好事我们要一起去做
Best part is we get to do it together.

276
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,140
怎么样 大学？
What's up, college?

277
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,810
怎么样 兄弟 我们住322房
What's up, bro? We're 322.

278
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,610
去他妈的高中 对吧？

I do not understand how it works.

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,620
是真的
It's true.

299
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,750
高科技警察装备
Jenko: Super high-tech police gear.

全拜高昂的预算所赐 干他娘的
Carte blanche with the budget, motherfucker.

301

我不同意贴这张海报
I'm going to veto that poster.

302
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,690
显的幼稚
It's a touch childish.

303
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,000
好 也不知道兰博基尼跟小屁孩有什么关系
Okay. What do lambos have to do with touching children?

304
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,950
兰博基尼太差劲
Lambos are lame.

305
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,840
我想要说明白的是 这个不是...
I get one choice. I get one thing that I'm not...

306
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,780
我们得承认 你懂我的意思吗？
We have to agree. You know what I mean?

307
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,120
怎么样?同志们 我们是对门的邻居
What up, fellas? We're your across-the-hall neighbors.

怎么？ 你一个年龄大一些

我们就是正常的大学年龄
We're actually just normal college age.

324
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,280
就算你年龄大也很酷 伙计
I mean, even if you're a little older, that's cool, man,

325
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,430
姑娘们喜欢年纪大的
because, you know, girls here love older dudes.

326
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,930
这是真的
That's true.

我上过无数的姑娘
I've fucked a thousand girls by now

331
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,310
不知怎么 到最后
and I don't know, at the end of the day,

332
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,510
你只是想要一些
you just kind of want something

333
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,730
更深层次的东西
that's just a little deeper really.

对吧 像上一次一样
All right? Same as last time.

347
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,960
伙计 要是像上一次
Dude, if it's like last time,

348
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,820
你会玩的很开心 我就很悲剧
you're gonna have an awesome time, and it's gonna suck for me.

349
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,630
不对 你也会玩的很开心
No. You're gonna have an awesome time, too,

350
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,060
我会让你玩的开心的
because I'm gonna make sure of it.

351
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,530
你为我挡过子弹
You took a bullet for me.

352
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,100
对 我挡过 太悲催了 不过我还会挡
That's right, I did, and it sucked, but I'd do it again.

353
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,300
不行 该我了 我欠你的
No way. It's my turn. I owe you a life debt.

354
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,740
男女混用卫生间
(Singsong) Co-ed bathrooms.

355
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,700

What? Oh, shit.

356
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,970
我不会让你悲剧的
I'm not gonna take a shit

357
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,000
我会一直都在的
the entire time I'm here.

358
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,070
我知道
I know.

359
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,650
嗨 你好啊
Hey. How you doing?

360
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,360
嗨

361
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,300
你怎么样？ 你怎么样？

362
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,680
就是刚创造了facebook有点精疲力尽
Just exhausted from inventing Facebook

363
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,020
或其他我们这个年龄的人用的网站
or whatever website people our age use.

364
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,440
这里还有书本？
Jenko: They still have books?

365
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,560
我以为他们都把书放进电脑里了
I thought they just put the books inside the computers.

366
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,540
我猜学生们的电脑只用来约炮的
Yeah, I guess the kids just use the stacks to hide and have sex.

367
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,760
我们去Cynthia参加过的课和活动
So we'll go to all Cynthia's classes and activities,

368
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,030
向周围打探毒品的事
ask around about the drug

369
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,520
找到谁是卖家
and find out who the dealer is.

370
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,940
就像上一次一样
Yeah, it's just like last time.

371
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
完全像上一次一样
Exactly like last time.

372
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,170
伙计 人类性学科
Dude, in human sexuality,

373
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,540
你是自己去干
do you get to fuck

374
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,290
还是只看着别人干
or do you just get to watch people fuck?

375
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,680
都不是
Neither.

376
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,600
我他妈的该干什么？
What the fuck am I taking it for, then?

377
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
明显 我们大家都听过这句话
Now, obviously, we've all heard this statement before,

378
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,360
第一印象很重要
first impression is important

379
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,620
我让你们留个第一印象
I've got a first impression for you.

380
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,960
你喜欢我的心理课吗？
(Mimicking Tracy Morgan) Oh, y'all like psychology?

381
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,290
崔西·摩根
Tracy Morgan.

382
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,100
没人喜欢？
Nobody?

383
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,540
精神百倍 玩命去玩 我说对吧
(Softly) Work hard, play hard, am I right?

384
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,960
你在找whyphy？
You looking for some whyphy?

385
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,940
对 哥们 有就太好了
Yeah, man, that'd be sick.

386
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,340
去警察局
Go to the police station,

387
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,350
向你队长申请去证物室
walk in and ask your captain to see the evidence room

388
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,530
你他妈就是缉毒警察
'cause you're a fucking narc.

389
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,660
我认为你理解错了
I think you're mistaken.

390
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,450
你前面戴着徽章
(Laughs) You're literally wearing your badge.

391
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,480
你真的去检查
Did you really just check to see

392
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,250
你有没有戴徽章
if you were wearing your badge?

393
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,680
这家伙是个警察
This guy's a fucking cop.

394
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,020
我没有往下看
I didn't look down.

395
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,260
等等 Jacobs教授 历史不是很久以前发生的事吗？
"Wait, Professor Jacobs, doesn't history happen a long time ago?"

396
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,100
历史是发生...
Well, history happens...

397
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,370
这节课糟糕透了
This class is such a gut.

398
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,350
你们玩橄榄球
Hey, you guys play football?

399
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,100
这其实是我的笔记本电脑
No, this is actually my laptop.

400
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,770
看 我在记笔记
Yeah, I'm taking notes right now.

401
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,040
逗你玩的 这是橄榄球
I'm kidding. It's a football.

402
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,720
mcquaid同学
Mr. mcquaid?

403
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,780
共价键
Covalent bonds.

404
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,100
缉毒战争的结果是什么？
What has been the result of the war on drugs?

405
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,850
为什么要问我 我有不是警察
Why would you ask me? I'm not a cop.

406
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,600
因为这是大学研讨班
Because this is a college seminar,

407
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,550
这就是大学研讨班要做的
and that's how college seminars work.

408
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,100
教授和学生愉快的交流
Professor gets into a lively conversation with the student.

409
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,450
擦出火花 最后让学生领会
Friction creates fire, and that leads to lessons learned.

410
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,100
缉毒肯定是很困难的
Well, it's definitely harder to get drugs.

411
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,500
这一点可以告诉你
I can personally tell you that.

412
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,470
可卡因的平均价格
The average price of cocaine

413
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,030
在过去30年下降了70%
has dropped 70% in the last 30 years.

414
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,310
然后卖家可能卖给你的是踩到的狗屎
Then your dealer's probably selling you some pretty stepped-on shit.

415
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,010
mcquaid同学 大学是个很好的地方
Mr. mcquaid, college is a wonderful place.

416
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,420

For shooting my penis off?

553
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,330

Don't sweat it, brother. I'm liberated. Totally.

555
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,080
你知不知道他们给我做了个阴道？
You know they gave me a vagina?

556
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,530
特别棒 你们要不要看看？
It's awesome. You guys want to see it?

00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,760
-不 不 不    -不 不 不
No, no, no, no! No, no, no.

558
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,700
不看 好吧 Eric已经看过了
That's fine. All right. Eric's seen it.

559
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,260
Eric已经彻底无望了 是不是啊 Eric？
Eric's been all up in that shit. Isn't that right, Eric?

560
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,980
你们无论如何得把我弄出去
You guys got to get me the fuck out of here.

561
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,760
嘿 你们猜怎么着
Hey, guess what.

562
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,300
我是Eric的马子
I'm Eric's bitch.

563
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
不是 你不是
No, you're not.

564
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,200
是！我就是！
Yes! I am!

565
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,870
我是你的马子
I'm your bitch.

566
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,360
天啊 亲爱的 我很抱歉
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, honey.

567
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,370
我刚才不是故意的 你明白的？
I didn't mean that. You know that, right?

568
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,880
我是马子 忍不住要炫耀一下
I am such a bitch when aunt flo shows up.

569
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,330
出了很多血 太疯狂了
It bleeds so much, it's crazy.

570
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,780
就像是闪闪发光打开了电梯门
It's like the elevator doors opening in  the shining.

571
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,760
靠 哥们 你的阴道根本不能使
Your vagina doesn't fucking work, man.

572
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,670
昨儿晚上你不是使了吗
Worked for you last night. (Chuckles)

573
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,960
毫无疑问你在逼Eric发展这一段感情
You are so clearly forcing Eric into this relationship.

574
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,030
Eric 我逼你做任何事情了么？
Eric, am I forcing you into anything?

575
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,560
-是  -看见了吧？
Yes. (Chuckles) See?

576
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,590
是这样的 我们俩去大学里做卧底
Look, they sent us in undercover at a college

577
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,300
要找到最新合成毒品的毒贩子
to find the dealer of this new synthetic,

578
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,000
但是没人跟我们透露一点儿线索
and no one will tell us anything.

579
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,600
靠 那是因为你们俩看起来就像是缉毒警察 ？
That's 'cause you guys look like fucking narcs, all right?

580
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,210
大学里的孩子不跟Eric似的那么傻
College kids aren't dumb like Eric.

581
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,840
我本来是可以去伯克利大学的
I was supposed to go to Berkeley.

582
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,580
他们给了我们一张照片 我们就只有这个
Well, they gave us a picture, so we do have that.

583
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,920
那就是你们的线索 混账玩意儿
Well, that's your lead motherfucker!

584
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,180
就从这里开始
That's what you start with.

585
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,000
我知道 但是我哦们看不到他的脸 不知道他是谁
I know, but we can't see his face, so we don't know who it is.

586
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,340
我们不知道他是谁
"We don't know who it is.

587
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,720
我是Schimidt 我裤子里都是屎
"I'm schmidt. My pants are filled with doody."

588
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,480
那是你
(Groans) That's you.

589
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,460
那可一点儿也不像我
That doesn't sound anything like me.

590
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,590
有几分像你
You sort of sound like that.

591
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,960
一点儿也不像我
That doesn't sound anything like me.

592
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,050
没有不像你
It's not not you.

593
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,480
一点儿也不像我
That doesn't sound anything like me.

594
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,230
Eric 闭上眼睛 告诉我们现在说话的是谁
Eric! Close your eyes and tell me who's talking right now.

595
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,970
（胡言乱语状）
(Babbling)

596
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,970
Schmidt像婊子一样在发牢骚
That's schmidt being a little bitch.

597
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,800
这绝对不是一个好印象
That's just not a good impression.

598
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,420
干得好 超级警探
Nice job, super sleuths.

599
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,260
你们究竟有没有费心看过这张该死的照片？
Did you even bother to look at the fucking picture?

600
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,010
-有啊   -嗯？
Yeah. Huh?

601
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,430
 这儿有个倒影
There's a reflection right here.

602
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,980
你们要找的这个人有纹身
Your fucking guy's got a tattoo.

603
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,260
找到这个纹身 就找到这个毒贩了
Find the tattoo, find the dealer.

604
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,460
靠 兄弟 我不知道 我给很多醉酒的小屁孩儿做过白痴纹身
Fuck, man, I don't know. I do a lot of stupid tattoos to drunk kids.

605
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,060
那你记不记得这个白痴纹身？
Do you remember that stupid tattoo?

606
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,210
火箭炮？
Tattoo artist: A bazooka?

607
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,690
记得好像是给一个运动员做过一个
Think I might have did it on a football player.

608
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,080
留着红莫西干头型 分不出来
Guy with a red mohawk. I don't know.

609
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,460
他们对我而言都是一样的
They all start to look the same to me.

610
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,600
我觉得我清楚他说的是谁
I think I know exactly who he's talking about.

611
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,130
去你的！
Fuck you!

612
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,570

Fuck you, you little walk-on fuck!

613
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,520
穿着这些东西 根本没法活动
I can't, like, move around in these things.

614
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,450
天 我喜欢跑龙套的一天
Rooster: God, I love walk-on day!

615
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,310
靠 爽啊
(Whispers) Fuck, yeah.

616
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,480
用棉签的奇怪时间
That's a weird time to be q-tipping.

617
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,080
他妈的都是废物
You're all fucking pussies!

618
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,970
-兄弟 你不用非得这么做   -啥？
Dude, you don't have to do this. What?

619
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,820
-我不想你受伤   -我不会...
I just don't want you to get hurt. I'm not gonna get...

625
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,970

Dude, I'm sorry. I got my q-tip in your meat, bro.

630
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,050
不不 哥们 我的肉沾到你的棉签了
No, man, I got my... I got my meat in your q-tip.

631
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,310
这就像是一个新型的三明治
It's like a whole new type of sandwich.

632
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,450
像是 肉棉签
Like, a meat q-tip. (Chuckles)

633
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,120
就像肉签
Like a meat-qute.

634
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,120
有意思
That's funny.

635
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,720
嘿 兄弟们 有人想要这种三明治么？
Hey, you guys want some of this sandwich?

It's a meat-qute sandwich.

637
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,670

Your arm all right? You want to take that sleeve off?

648
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,380
不用 我很好
No, I'm good.

649

Dude, holy shit, bro. Great fucking catch, dude.

650
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,450
你那么远能看见安全线 应该早点告诉我
If you see that safety line up that deep, though, hit me quicker.

651
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,350
哦 对 我不知道你是朝那个方向的 哥们
Oh, yeah, I didn't know you had wheels like that, bro.

652
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,050
很有趣 因为他是我的兄弟 所以...
It's funny, 'cause he's my brother. So...

653
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,930
嘿 知道吗 我们在Zeta有个派对
Hey, uh, you know, we have this rush party at zeta.

654
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,250
我想 你可以过来 跟其他人认识认识
but I thought, you know, you could come by and meet the guys.

655
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,300

It'd be really fun, I think.

We'll see what we can do.

663
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,050
我之前也说了一堆
Also, I said a bunch of stuff earlier

664
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,180
你没留心...
that you didn't acknowledge...

665
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,780

Great catch. Cool, yeah.

666
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,150
-回见   -所以你不回应？
See you then. So you won't address that?

667
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,320
那个家伙怎么回事？
What the fuck's up with that guy?

668
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,730
我们要做的就是混进他们的兄弟会
All we have to do now is rush the frat long enough

669
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,090
找到那个有火箭炮纹身的家伙
to confirm that rooster has that bazooka tattoo.

670
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,070
看 哥们 你觉得你来好吗？
Look, man, do you think it's cool if you come?

671
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,530
因为 我的意思是 他好像是只邀请了我
'Cause, I mean, he kind of really just asked me.

672
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,600
我只是不想开始
I just don't want to start off

673
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,780
留下不好的印象和那家伙
on the wrong foot with this guy.

674
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,920
哥们 你梦游呢 我们做任何事都是一起的啊
Dude, you're tripping. We do everything together.

675
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,480
不过你确实不该带Puka珠串
You should lose the puka shells, though.

676
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,860
自从你来大学之后变了很多
Things are different since you didn't go to college.

677
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,340
呦 Brad 你怎么样 兄弟？
Yo, Brad! What's up, dude?

678
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,160
一样的珠串啊 兄弟
Same puka, dude.

679
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,010
你也有同样的啊
You got the same... Puka bros.

680
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,250
太棒了
Zook: Holy shit! (Both laughing)

681
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,000
哎 你看看 咱俩什么都一样
Look at him, it's, like, all the same.

682
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,950
哥们 你也穿这个裤子啊？
Dude, you wear pants, too?

683
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,620
-啥？哥们  - 兄弟
What? Bros, man. Dude.

684
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,490
我就知道我们很玩的来 就像这样
I knew we were gonna be connected, just like that.

685
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,090
是啊 -你们俩怎么不把小弟弟栓一起
Yeah, why don't you guys just tie your dicks together

686
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,010
然后去结婚啊 高冷仔
and get married, right, rooster?

687
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,640
Rooster 怎样啊 兄弟？
Rooster. What's up, bro?

688
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,470
你看来不错 哥们
You look good, man.

689
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,560
你怎么样Rooster？
What's up, rooster?

690
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,200
你好吗 兄弟？ -戴珠串了
How you doing, man? Digging the puka.

691
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,960
谢谢 兄弟 -我真不相信是一样的...
Thanks, dude. I can't believe it's the same...

692
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,170
rooster 你怎样？
How you doing, rooster?

693
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,290
Rooster 懂点潮流
Rooster is getting some pop.

694
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,240
你怎么不去找他聊聊？
Why don't you go check him out?

695
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,070
你嗨了吗 伙计？  - 肯定嗨了 伙计
Jenko: You in the zone, bro? Zook: In the fucking zone, dude.

696
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,150
嘿 你怎么样？
Hey. What's up?

697
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,920
嘿 我是Rooster
What's up? I'm rooster.

698
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,420
哦 耶 不是
Oh, yeah, no.

699
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,970
我们之前见过
We've met before.

700
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
哦 是么？我一点儿也不记得
Oh, really? I don't remember that at all.

701
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,450
你一定长了一副大众脸
You must just have a really plain face.

702
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,570
对 他们都叫我大众脸
Yeah. They call me ol' plain face.

703
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
他们这么叫你么？
They call you that?

704
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,600
你身体上有没有什么艺术标记 或墨迹 好让我辨认是你？
So, do you have any body art or, like, any ink I could see?

705
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,400
真奇特的问题
That's a pretty random question.

706
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,070
无论怎样 非常高兴跟你交谈 哥们
Hey, anyway, it was so nice chatting with you, man.

707
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,400
很高兴认识你 兄弟
Nice to meet you, man.

708
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,440
靠 你干啥 老兄
Yo, what the fuck, bro?

709
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,640
你他妈干嘛呢 哥们？
Yo, what the fuck are you doing, dude?

710
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,670
你现在认真的？-你...
You serious right now? You...

711
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,040
你很奇怪
You're being weird.

712
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,240
你一直都很奇怪
You've been weird.

713
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,540
就像是“我听见什么了”
Jenko: It was just like, "what am I hearing?

714
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,910
我现在在听什么啊
"What am I hearing right now?"

715
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,910
那个神经病告诉你这些？
And the psychic told you that?

716
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,520
-是的 特别疯狂 兄弟   -呦
Yo. That is so crazy, dude.

717
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,080
嘿 哥们 你要不要上楼顶看看
Hey, dude, you want to go see the roof?

718
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,550
靠 我想上楼顶看看 -哥们
Fuck yeah, I want to see the roof, dude.

719
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,970
来 我们上去吧 来啊
Come on, let's go, let's go. Come on.

720
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,170
去楼顶 来吧去楼顶 来
Come on to the roof, come on to the roof. Let's go.

721
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,230
加油 你能做到的 加油 加油
Jenko: Come on, you can do it. Come on, come on, come on!

722
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,470
我好怀念攀爬啊 来 上来
I miss climbing so much. Come on, let's go. Come on.

723
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,650
好 呃...
All right, uh...

724
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,080
再来一次
One more time.

725
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,010
我先回去了
I'm just gonna go home.

726
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,590
我不懂跑酷 所以...
I don't know parkour, so...

727
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:28,280
好吧
All right.

728
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,020
嘿 玛雅·安吉罗（诗人）
Hey, Maya angelou!

729
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,310
诗歌 好吧 我懂了
Poetry, okay. I got it. (Chuckles)

730
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,860
取笑诗歌专业
Make fun of the poetry major.

731
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,530
我猜 你没什么兴趣
So, I guess you have no interest

732
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,160
以后做一份平常工作
in having a real job in the future.

733
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,160
-绝对没兴趣   -没有 是吧？
Absolutely not. No, right?

734
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,290
那你呢？
(Both laugh) What about you?

735
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,360
呃 我艺术专业的
Um, I'm an art major.

736
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,390
哦 这样的话你绝对不能随便胡说 因为...
Okay. So you definitely cannot talk any shit, 'cause...

737
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,340
是的 我不能 我不能
No, I can't. I cannot.

738
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,090
...你会永远赚不到钱
...you're never gonna make any money. (Laughs)

739
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,180
我绝对赚不到钱
I'm never gonna make any money,

740
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,270
所以不要告诉我的父母 但是...
so don't tell my parents, but...

741
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,320
要是我今晚跟你父母聊天
When I talk to your parents tonight,

742
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,150
我不会告诉他们你的专业
I will not tell them about your major.

743
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,750
-好  谢谢   -不客气
Okay, thank you. You're welcome.

744
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,380
好的 艺术专业
All right, art major.

745
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,830
这个东西 你有什么感想
What do you think about that?

746
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,660
呃 我会说那
Um, I would say that

747
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,070
这是两个人
it's these two beings

748
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,940
相互支撑达到完全平衡的状态
leaning up against each other in perfect balance.

749
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,380
如果一个倒掉 他们就会失去彼此
If one were to fall, they would just lose each other.

750
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,240
这是关于互相支持的
So it's just about support.

751
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,770
你就不能说这玩意儿就像睾丸？
You can't admit that it looks exactly like testicles?

752
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,940
就是像那个东西
(Laughing) That's exactly what it looks like.

753
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,890
那 有没有哪个人在支持着你呢？
So, is there someone who supports you?

754
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,240
不 我是那种
No, I'm just one of those people

755
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,820
喜欢自己一个人待着的人
that really likes to spend time with myself.

756
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,660
跟我说说看
Tell me about it.

757
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,560
我喜欢一个人呆这 我的最爱
I love to be alone. I am, like, the best at it.

758
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,190
我就是喜欢那种 坐在房间里
I just love when you're sitting there in a room,

759
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,970
只有你和你的思想
and you're just there with your thoughts,

760
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,040
然后 你意识到“哦 天啊 我是一个人”
and you're like, "oh, my gosh, I'm alone.

761
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,200
“会有人爱我么？”或其他
"Would anyone ever love me?" Or whatever.

762
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,610
“会有任何人会在乎我吗？”
And, like, "do I know anyone who would care

763
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,710
“我是不是从这个房间里出去”
"if I just ever came out of this room or not?"

764
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,950
或是其他东西 就这样...
Or whatever and, like...

765
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,970
我也说不明白 很平静 就喜欢
I don't know. It's just peaceful. I just like it.

766
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,940
好 如果你今晚不想一个人
Well, if you don't want to be alone tonight,

767
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,150
我们可以去艺术大楼转转
we are gonna go hang out at the art building,

768
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,520
如果你想来的话
if you want to come.

769
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,960
好的 好的
Okay, okay.

770
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,630
我去 我去
Okay. Okay.

771
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,100
我以为今晚会以和预料不一样
I expected tonight would go in a way that you wouldn't expect,

772
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,500
但是我没有想到的是今晚
but what I didn't expect was tonight would go

773
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,250
是和我的预期一样
in the exact way that you would expect.

774
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,840
-你懂我的意思吗？   -妥妥的
You know what I mean? Totally.

775
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,760
你们经常在这儿玩？
So you guys hang out here a lot?

776
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,810
是 我们对兄弟会派对那些东西不是很感兴趣
Yeah. I mean, we're not into the whole frat party kind of stuff.

777
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,450
我们喜欢坐下来 只是喝点好酒
We like to sit around, just drink some good wine

778
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,930
然后谈论点些重要的话题
and talk about some important stuff.

779
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,840
上姑娘 然后整天喝的烂醉
Banging bitches and getting wasted all fucking day.

780
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,410
这就是我最喜欢做的两件事
Those are, like, two of my favorite things to do.

781
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,180
你就像是 稍微欠缺一点儿吸引力的...
ou are, like, a slightly less attractive version of...

782
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,460
-毕加索？   -毕加索
Picasso? Picasso.

783
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,530
是吧？以前有人这么说过
Right? I've been told that before.

784
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,250
哦 那就是Cynthia Watson的房间
Oh, that's Cynthia Watson's room.

785
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,250
现在才2点 我还以为已经很晚了 你要进来么
It's only 2:00. I thought it was late. Do you want to come in?

786
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,070
才2点？我通常凌晨2点才吃晚饭 所以...
It's only 2:00? I usually go to dinner at, like, 2:00 A.M., so...

787
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,830
当然 耶 为什么不呢
Sure, yeah, why not?

788
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,540
我想这么做 我要以正确的角度进去
Rooster: I'm gonna do it. I just got to get it at the right angle.

789
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,500
-兄弟 停下来吧   -操你妈的球门柱
Dude, stop. Rooster: Stupid fucking goalpost!

790
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,710
不可能的 你撞不到那球门柱的
It's impossible. You can't fucking do it.

791
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,640
每次赢球后球迷跑到操场
The fans used to rush the field

792
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,480
然后就把球门柱拆了
after every win and tear down the goalposts,

793
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,850
教练很生气 就想办法把球门柱给固定了
and coach hated it. And so he cemented them in.

794
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,580
他们像风暴一样卷过操场 还想那样
They storm the field, and still do it,

795
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,100
现在他们只能跳来跳去
but they just bounce around.

796
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,550
去你的球门柱 兄弟
Rooster: Fuck this goalpost, bro!

797
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,850
你们俩要抓稳了
You guys might want to hold on,

798
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,420
因为这东西要到了
'cause this shit is coming down.

799
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,530
-呦 那是啥啊 纹身 就在那
Yo, what is that? The tattoo, what's that right there?

800
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,060
哦 这个么？嗯...
Oh. Oh, this? Mmm-hmm.

801
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,580
这是我以前高中的校队 是普莱恩维尤红鲱鱼
It's my old high school team. The plainview red herrings.

802
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,970
看看还能游泳
Look at it swim.

803
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,300
-靠   -咋了
Shit. What?

804
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,120
靠 还真是不寻常啊
Shit, that's a really outside-of-the-box

805
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,050
高中吉祥物
high school mascot.

806
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,380
抓紧了兄弟们
Hold on, guys.

807
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,900
嘿 你今天怎么没来训练场？
Zook: Hey, why don't you come to practice today?

808
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,870
很明显 你在队里表现很不错
I mean, you're obviously good enough to play on the team.

809
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,760
其实 我本来不应该在这玩球的
Look, I'm not supposed to be here to play football.

810
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,460
怎么？
What?

811
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,050
我来这儿是为了完成任务的
I'm just here to do my assignments

812
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,570
然后回去 就是这样
and get out, that's it.

813
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,760
我说 学业是很重要 或是无所谓
I mean, yeah, school's important or whatever,

814
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,700
但是 当我给你传球的时候
but when I was throwing you those passes,

815
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,380
就像是 你去那儿之前我就知道你会去那
it was like I knew where you were gonna be before you went there.

816
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,340
知道吗 我幻想
You know, I had this,

817
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,540
我把球传给你 兄弟
 like, vision of me throwing bullet tds to you, dude,

818
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,910
然后所有的球迷开始叫喊...
and then all these fans just started going, like...

819
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,860
"Zook! Mcquaid! Zook! Mcquaid!"

820
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,530
他们就在那喊呀叫呀
And they were chanting and chanting,

821
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,290
然后球门柱就倒了
and then the goalposts came down.

822
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,350
哥们？
Dude?

823
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,090
我 也有过这样的愿景 我一直都有
I have had that exact vision, like, my entire life.

824
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,660
-哥们   -哥们

825
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,800

827
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,680
哥们
Both: Dude.

828
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,500
我们肯定可以啊 兄弟
Like, well, we fucking can, bro.

829
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,970
你所要做的就是加入球队
All you gotta do is join the team.

830
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,210
是啊 为什么不呢？
Yeah. Why not?

831
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,100
就是这样！
Yes!

832
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,280
太好了 - 太好了 兄弟
Fuck yeah, dude. Fuck yeah, dude.

833
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,480
那是什么东西？
What's that?

834
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,450
我的纹身
My tattoo.

835
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,250
 靠 来看看
Yeah, fuck, look.

836
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,480
看 这是我 Zook
Look, it's me, zook.

837
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,370
胳膊上有个该死的火箭炮 懂我的意思么？
Got a fucking bazooka for an arm. Know what I mean?

838
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,360
兄弟 我太兴奋了
Dude, I'm so fucking pumped

839
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,750
你能加入到球队里
you're gonna be on this fucking team, bro.

840
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,670
感觉怎么样？
What's up with it?

841
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,840
你还好吧？
How you doing?

842
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,400
早安 很好
Hi. Good.

843
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,440
那个怎么样...
How was the, um...

844
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,010
我的表现你还满意吗？
How was the sex for you?

845
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,950
对我来说很好 很愉悦
It was fun for me. It was a good time.

846
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,290
是 对
Yeah, right.

847
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,220
我很享受之中
enjoyed it.

848
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,420
是啊
Yeah.

849
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,810
这就是为什么我从不喝酒
This is why I don't drink.

850
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,290
嘿 你好啊？
Hey. How you doing?

851
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,880
我很好
I'm fine.

852
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,800
我的意思是 我没有整晚上听你们俩私语
I mean, I'm not listening to you guys fornicate all night long.

853
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,050
来回的活塞运动
Thrusting and pumping.

854
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,340
我想你的屁股在某一时刻都快甩掉了
I thought your hip popped out at one point.

855
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,910
我是说 看起来像是很好玩的游戏
I'm just saying, it's, like, all fun and games,

856
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,420
早上醒来邻床有个40岁的大一新生
and then you wake up in bed next to a 40-year-old freshman.

857
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,050
我只有19岁 所以...
I'm 19, so...

858
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,300
去玩Pinochle游戏晚了19分钟？
Nineteen minutes late to pinochle,

859
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,650
你在公园哪里和你的老友们碰面
where you're meeting your old friends in the park?

860
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,130
对 那就是我的意思
Yeah, that's what I meant.

861
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,740
哦 天呐 Maya 你看看他
Oh, my gosh, Maya, look at him.

862
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,970
还那么犀利 太鼓舞人心了
He's still so sharp. That's so inspiring.

863
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,470
给我们说一下经历的战争吧 哪个都行
Tell us about the war, any one of them.

864
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,250
你的高潮呻吟是我听过的最糟糕
You're, like, the loudest climaxer I've ever heard.

865
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,480
就像是30年头的洒水车
It was, like, the sound of, like, a 30-year-old sprinkler

866
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,290
终于第一次爆发了
finally going off for the first time.

867
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,960
好了 特别喜欢跟你聊天
Okay, well, so lovely talking with you. (Sighs)

868
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,600
你是个很可爱的人
You're a lovely person. Hmm.

869
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,050
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

870
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,810
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

871
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,190
她看起来不坏
She seems nice. (Door closes)

872
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,940
她糟透了
She's horrible.

873
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,310
天呐
God.

874
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,760
她曾经是Cynthia的室友
She was Cynthia's roommate,

875
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,930
我觉得她很可怜 就叫她跟我住在一起
and I felt bad for her, so I told her I would room with her.

876
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,020
就这样
So...

877
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,950
你应该有一大堆事情
So you probably have a bunch of stuff

878
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,700
要今天去做吧
that you have to do today.

879
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,290
-有吗？   -没有
Right? No.

880
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,720
哦 好吧
Oh. Okay.

881
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,930
我只是想让你知道
Look, I just want you to know

882
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,130
我不是那种 上完就走的人
I'm not, like, a "hit it and quit it" type of fella.

883
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,600
我是那种 上完
I'm, like, a "hit it,

884
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,170
继续身体和情感上接着交流的人 所以...
"continue to hit it both physically and emotionally" kind of guy, so...

885
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,210
嘿 Doug 这样你不会觉得奇怪的 ？
Hey, Doug, you're not gonna be weird about this, are you?

886
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,480
不会
No.

887
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,180
对这种只随便玩玩能接受吧？
I mean, you're cool with just hooking up?

888
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,610
耶 我很高兴你能这么看的开...
Yeah. I mean, no. I mean, I'm glad you said something.

889
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,330
因为 我都不知道当时我是不是清醒
'Cause I don't even know if I like you when I'm sober.

890
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,520
我知道 就像是
No, I know, and it's like,

891
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,250
一点儿也没感觉到受伤 一点儿也没
that doesn't even hurt, like, at all.

892
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,880
好的 那么...
Okay, so, um...

893
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,490
我要...我要溜了 我以后联系了
I'm gonna... I'm gonna split. I'll text you later.

894
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,050
很棒 特别棒性爱 你技术很好
Great, that was great sex. You're good at it.

895
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,700
我会短息联系你 3到5分钟或怎样？
And I'll text you, three to five minutes or something?

896
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,330
好的
(Door opens) All right.

897
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,880
这他妈到底是什么？
what the fuck is this?

898
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,930
太鸡巴扯了
This is bullshit.

899
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,020
你两个是不是又在学校乱搞了？
Are you two fucking around at school again?

900
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,830
嘿 我们要对这些东西买单的
Hey, we got to pay for this shit.

901
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,630
-我们需要结果   -不不不
We need results! No, no, no.

902
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,230
看 我们在极力寻找
Look, we are looking aggressively

903
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,100
这个特别的纹身
for this very specific tattoo.

904
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,280
或者这个纹身就是死路一条
Or the tattoo could just be a dead end.

905
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,080
什么乱七八糟的？这还是同样的案子
What the fuck? It's the same case!

906
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,250
做一样的事
Do the same thing.

907
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,970
这严格上说不是同样案子 因为
Well, it's not exactly the same case, 'cause

908
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,700
我们俩其中一个昨晚上跟人上床了
one of us got laid last night.

909
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,440
Schmidt?

910
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,280
嘘
Shh.

911
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,560
别把我的小弟弟吵醒了
Don't wake up my dick.

912
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,980
玩红了眼 根本没睡觉
Flew in on the red-eye, hasn't gotten a wink of sleep.

913
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,910
靠
Damn.

914
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,530
我们在说任务
We're talking missionary.

915
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,930
我们在说任务
We're talking missionary.

916
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,840
当我在上面 她背对着我
We're talking when I'm on top and she's on her back.

917
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,040
她很聪明 艺术系的
She's smart, she's an art major.

918
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,180
她也不是多聪明 就他妈是个艺术生
She can't be that smart. She's a fucking art major.

919
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,030
拜托
Come on.

920
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,600
我给你点鼓励 Schmidt
I will give you some daps, schmidt.

921
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,820
给我点鼓励 老大
Give me some motherfucking daps, man!

922
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,410
来嘛 给我点儿
Come on, give me some.

923
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,810
我的人类性学烦死我了
Jenko: My human sexuality class is blowing my mind.

924
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,580
你知道我高中时候侮辱过基佬么？
Did you know I used gay slurs in high school?

925
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,510
是的 直接对我说的
Yes, directed at me.

926
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,020
伙计 我很抱歉当时自说自话
Dude, I am so sorry for being a homophone.

927
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,010
我们要谈谈今天 你对Dickson为嘛这么奇怪吗？
Are we gonna talk about how weird you were today with dickson?

928
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,190
是这样 我觉得那个纹身不是什么重点
Look, I don't think the tattoo means what you think it means.

929
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,140
据我们所知 很多人都有那样的纹身
I mean, for all we know, a lot of people could have that tattoo.

930
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,730
这个纹身 这个荒谬的特别的纹身？
This tattoo? This absurdly specific tattoo?

931
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,460
给我说说还是谁有这样的纹身
Name one other person who has this.

932
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,320
首先 Zook就有
For starters, zook has it.

933
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,030
Zook 有那个纹身？
Zook has the tattoo?

934
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,180
我觉得没什么大不了的
I think it's not problem

935
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,920
我靠 我们找这个纹身 找了好几天了
What the fuck? We've been looking for this tattoo for days!

936
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,870
你明白这个意味着zook就是卖家吗?
Do you understand this means zook is the dealer?

937
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,540
我很希望你们俩能相处的好
I really want you guys to hang out.

938
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,330
我是想好好相处 可他完全无视我
We have hung out. He's completely ignored me.

939
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,480
很抱歉 不过我们一定要调查你的新基友
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to investigate your new bff.

940
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,910
我们要部署摄像头
We're gonna put cameras everywhere,

941
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,490
我们要监控他在干些什么
and we're gonna monitor the fuck out of what he's doing.

942
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,120
我们不能随便就走进zeta的房子
We can't just walk into zeta house

943
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,420
然后安装一大堆摄像头 好吗？
and just put up a bunch of fucking cameras, okay?

944
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,160
那到处是他们的人
There's dudes there everywhere.

945
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,800
行了 你的计划太烂 很抱歉
All right, your plan is stupid. I'm sorry.

946
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,330
我的计划太烂 有意思  -... 好
My plan is stupid? That's interesting. What... okay.

947
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,650
好像这样就行了
I'm, like, basically done

948
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,850
从早到晚一直就这么看着
fucking watching your shit all the fucking time.

949
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,800
好 对 我是愚蠢的那个 是我
Okay, yeah, exactly. I'm the fucking stupid one. Yeah.

950
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,600
伙计 这样的不同 在一起一定很难
Man, it must be hard being so different.

951
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,060
我们俩完全一样 使得做什么事都很容易
We're exactly the same. It makes everything so much easier.

952
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,760
伙计们 能不能给我们一些空间
Guys, can you just give us some space?

953
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,940
我们需要解决一些问题
We're really trying to figure something out,

954
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,180
我们需要集中 好吗
and we need to focus, okay?

955
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,010
你集中不会有问题的 伙计
You're not gonna have trouble focusing, man.

956
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,510
是啊 伙计 这些零食里加了whyphy
Yeah, man, those krispie treats got mad whyphy in them.

957
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,340
我们给整个宿舍都发了
Kenny: We made a batch for the whole dorm, man.

958
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,450
我吃了这样的六块
I've eaten six of these.

959
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,800
那你回你会很专注  - 很专注
Kenny: Then you're gonna be real focused. Keith: Be real focused.

960
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,380
四小时里你会梦游仙境
In about four hours, you're gonna be tripping.

961
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,850
你会没事的 伙计
You're fine. You're gonna be all right, man.

962
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,460
谁卖给你的whyphy?
Who sold you whyphy?

963
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,900
没人卖给我们
Nobody sold it to us.

964
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,370
Cynthia给我们的 作为交换
Yeah, man, Cynthia gave us a butt load,and in exchange,

965
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,960
我们给她写了逻辑论文
we wrote her logic paper for her.

966
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,400
行了 行了 我们等会见
All right. All right, man, we'll see you guys later.

967
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,830
享用食物吧
Enjoy the food.

968
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,570
也许这是好事
Maybe this is a good thing. (Door closes)

969
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,040
我们利用这个专注想办法潜入zook的房子
let's use that focus to figure out a way to get into zook's house.

970
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,050
你有感觉了吗   - 没有 你呢？
You feel anything? No. Do you feel anything?

971
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,210
没有 我有很强的耐药性
No, but I have a super high tolerance for...

972
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,210
我现在很专注
I'm so focused.

973
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,910
我也很专注
I'm so focused, too.

974
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,250
你没必要压在我上面
You don't have to be on top of me.

975
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,820
很有必要
Yes, I do.

976
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,280
为什么  - 伪装
Why? Camouflage.

977
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,020
走
Go.

978
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,400
我们走
Let's go.

979
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,570
绝对不行
Male student: No fucking way.

980
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,420
所以 Dane不行  - 对
Okay, so no? Dane? All right.

981
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,230
踢出 好了
Out, all right.

982
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:40,760
靶心
Bull's-eye. Bingo.

983
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,250
头盔看起来很差劲
That helmet looks kind of lame.

984
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,680
你知道什么不差劲吗？
You know what's not lame?

985
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,490
安全
Safety.

986
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,880
你干吗？
What are you doing?

987
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,370
切玻璃
I'm cutting glass.

988
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,010
那是激光灯
It's a laser pointer.

989
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,800
不能切玻璃  - 什么？
It can't cut glass. What?

990
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,710
一点也不好玩
That's no fun at all.

991
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,360
我很专注  - 开干吧
I'm so focused. Let's do this.

992
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,810
我很专注  - 开干吧
I'm so focused. Let's do this.

993
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
再给我一个  - 我没有摄像头了
Give me another. I don't have any more cameras.

994
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,090
你不用钻这么多的洞 好吗
You don't need to drill so many holes. Yeah, okay.

995
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,330
耶 这个很完美  你可以放这里
Yeah, that one's perfect. Okay, you can do that one.

996
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,780
我没有摄像头了 我都给你说五次了
I don't have any more cameras. I've said it five times.

997
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,460
好了 这是最后的工作
All right. Okay. That's the last of 'em.

998
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,870
是时候验证zook就是卖家了
Time to prove that zook's the dealer.

999
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:07,820
或者不是卖家
Jenko: Or not the dealer.

1000
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,810
下一个是Brad mcquaid
Next up is Brad mcquaid.

1001
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,740
通过？好
(All agreeing) Right? Yes.

1002
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,360
很明显 这家伙...
Obviously, right? I mean, the guy's...

1003
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,890
老实说  这家伙一直创造记录 伙计们
The guy's all-time. You guys, let's be honest.

1004
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,490
例如 他可以用眼睛开啤酒盖
I mean, like, he was opening up beer cans with his eyeballs.

1005
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,520
他们挺不错的吧
That's so sweet of them.

1006
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,480
那Brad就加入了
 So Brad... Brad's in.

1007
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,590
那Doug Mcquaid呢  -不行
MUh, Doug mcquaid. No!

1008
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,280
他是个大蠢蛋
He's a bag of dicks!

1009
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,930
他是Brad的兄弟
He's Brad's brother.

1010
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,160
他就像他哥的跟屁虫
He follows him around everywhere,

1011
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,570
我们要是只要Brad 不要Doug的话
so I doubt we get Brad without Doug.

1012
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,170
不是这样的 我是有正式女朋友
That's not true. I have a serious girlfriend.

1013
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,000
伙计 我觉得这家伙很糟糕  -为什么这样说
I got a bad feeling about this guy, dude.- Why? Why?

1014
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,910
我和他打过几次交道
  I was talking to him for a second.

1015
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,400
他是个大嘴巴
He's got a big mouth,okay?

1016
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,690
我觉得他会把我们的事说出去
I feel like he could fuck this whole thing up for us.

1017
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,250
你看 你把这事搞砸了 你的话太多
See, you're fucking this up. You talk way too much.

1018
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,930
那家伙没恶意 你看他 挺好的
That guy is harmless, dude. Look at him, he's nice.

1019
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,170
他看起来就像个30岁的中学生
Rooster: He looks like a 30-year-old eighth grader.

1020
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,290
他不会有问题的
Zook: He's gonna be fine.

1021
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,260
我就说说 他挺讨人厌的
I'm just saying, the kid sucks.

1022
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,000
 那个Brad  Brad可以成我们的人
and Brad. Brad could be, like, our guy.

1023
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,960
他可以成为我们的一个一员
He could, like, be a part of our thing.

1024
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,820
我们一员？
 "Our thing"?

1025
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,960
嘘 我在听他们怎么夸我
Shh. I'm trying to hear them be nice about me.

1026
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,900
完全是扯淡 见鬼
This is fucking bullshit. Shit!

1027
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,710
糟糕
Shit.

1028
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,860
有人在上面吗？
Is somebody up there?

1029
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,440
完了  我们快走
Shit. We got to get out of here.

1030
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,700
你锁好门了没
Did you lock the door?

1031
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,170
锁好了  我检查了两遍
I did, man. I checked twice.

1032
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,010
快走
Go, go!

1033
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,320
该死的
Shit.

1034
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,980
我感觉很过瘾
I thank this is awesome

1035
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,610
你只是很紧张 因为我们马上要产生幻觉了
No, you're just paranoid because we're about to trip balls.

1036
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,040
不是的 我紧张是因为很危险
No, I'm paranoid because it could be dangerous.

1037
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,160
我们没事了 你看 我们成功了
No, we're fine. Look, we made it.

1038
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,880
我们成功了 一切顺利
We made it. It's all good.

1039
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,260
噢 妈的
Schmidt: Oh, shit!

1040
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,030
救命啊 救命啊
Help! Help!

1041
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:58,770
发生了什么
What's happening!

1042
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,730
什么情况？
Jenko: What the fuck?

1043
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,100
我没法呼吸了
Jenko: (Panting) I can't breathe.

1044
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,490
他们抓到了我们
They made us!

1045
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,780
他们会杀了我们的
They're gonna kill us!

1046
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,400
Jenko!

1047
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,270
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

1048
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,840
我们应该产生幻觉了
I think we're tripping!

1049
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,090
哦 卧槽 我产生的幻觉太可怕了
Oh, fuck! I'm having a bad trip! We're having a bad trip!

1050
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,470
我觉得我们还好啊
I think we are tripping, but...

1051
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,540
天啊 这不挺好的吗
God, isn't this great?

1052
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,280
我这比你那边恐怖多了
My side's so much scarier than yours.

1053
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,150
哦 我去 你那边太糟糕了
Oh, shit, your trip sucks.

1054
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,170
你应该到这边来 这边更好
You should come over here. It's way better.

1055
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,870
好的
Okay.

1056
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,570
这儿好像有个奇怪的隔离屏障
It's some kind of weird split screen!

1057
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,530
你好 橄榄球
Hello, football.

1058
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,830
Jenko!

1059
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,000
我终于有兰博基尼了
I finally got my lambo!

1060
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,400
嘿 Schmidt 你看
Hey, schmidt, look!

1061
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,210
快看啊
Look! Look! (Laughing)

1062
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,220
我的腿好累啊
My legs are tired.

1063
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,560
救命啊 不要再放音乐了
Help! No more music!

1064
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,280
你将永远一个人
You'll always be alone.

1065
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,690
嘿 Jenko  - 怎么了
Hey, jenko. What?

1066

1067
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,450
我去上面看看 好吗
I'm just gonna go up for a little while, okay?

1068
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,660
别走 呆在这儿
Stay, stay here.

1069
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,540
我不想呆在这儿 我飞起来了 太过瘾了
No, I don't want to stay here. I'm flying. This is amazing.

1070
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,810
不 老天 不要走
No. God. Don't go!

1071
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,740
哦 我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1072
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,140

No!

1073
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,670
不要走  - 不行 住手
Stay here! No, no, stop it.

1074
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,240
你把我拽下来了 你为什么要拽我下来
You're dragging me down! Why would you drag me down?

1075
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,510
快回来  -我飞起来了
Please stay! I'm flying.

1076
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:31,470
别走啊
Stay!

1077
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,480
醒醒 快从车里出来  - 完了
Wake up! Get out of the car! Shit.

1078
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,580
快点下车 趴在地上
Get out of the car! Get on the ground!

1079
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,990
给我跪下
On your fucking knees!

1080
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,900
快给我跪下
Get on your knees!

1081
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,740
你们已经知道了 是不是？  -知道什么？
You already know, don't you? What?

1082
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,620
你还有什么话要说的
Do you have anything to say?

1083
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,690
请别杀了我们
Please don't kill us.

1084
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,280
如果你没什么话要说
If you don't have anything to fucking say,

1085
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,290
那就把你的嘴张开
open your fucking mouth.

1086
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,360
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?

1087
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:58,780

1103
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,310
1 2 3 4 5
One, two, three, four, five...

1104
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,910
我不行了 我真的受不了了
I can't do it anymore! I can't do it anymore!

1105
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:54,930
20秒就是记录
Twenty's the record!

1106
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:57,340
33 34
Thirty-three, 34... (Groaning)

1107
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,030
67...

1108
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:36,850
你可以的 你能做到
You can do this, you can do this.

1109
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,240
我不行了 这太恶心了
I can't. This is disgusting.

1110
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,590
你必须行  - 我再也受不了了
No, you got to. I can't do this anymore!

1111
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,000
现在 轮到我最喜欢的项目了
And now, for my favorite event. (Squealing)

1112
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,360
靠 我不干了
Fuck this. I'm not doing this.

1115
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,180
嘿
Hey!

1116
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:54,990

Schmidt! What the fuck, man?

1117
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,450
你怎么回事 你不是说你想一起的吗
What is your problem? You said you wanted to stick together.

1118
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,860
我们必须这么做才能赢得他们的信任
This is what we have to do to win their trust.

1119
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,130
这很好玩 就只是喝酒玩游戏
This is supposed to be fun. It's just drinking and bonding games.

1120
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,010
很好玩
It's fun.

1121
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,960
你觉得好玩 我不觉得
It's fun for you. It's not fun for me.

1122
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,460
我不知道 也许我们应该...
I don't know. Maybe we should just...

1123
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,910
也许我们应该去调查别人
Maybe we should just investigate different people.

1124
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,040
你真这么觉得吗
Did you really just say that?

1125
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,640
你真的这么说 你想去调查别人
Did you really just say that you want to investigate other people?

1126
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,500
这就是你想要的？
That's what you want?

1127
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,820
我不知道 也许吧
I don't know, maybe.

1128
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,250
也许我们应该... 应该分开行动
Maybe we should just... We should just branch out.

1129
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,120
对 我们广撒网
Okay, just sow our oats a little.

1130
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,040
分散警察的种子
Sow our cop oats.

1131
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,760
你看 Zook对我很信任
Look, I have an in with zook.

1132
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,890
我们之间有种东西 感觉很不错
We have a thing and it's good, and...

1133
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,630
我也不知道 或许我应该和他更亲近点
I don't know, maybe I should just stay closer to him.

1134
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,950
你应该去做你的事
And you should do your thing

1135
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,350
继续追踪你的线索
with your connections and channels

1136
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:42,830
Cynthia的室友
with Cynthia's roommate.

1137
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,280
看她是否知道谁卖给的她毒品
You should see if she knows who sold her drugs.

1138
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,410
我只是 ... 我只是不...
I just... I just don't...

1139
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,010
我不喜欢我们分开行动
I don't like the idea of us doing stuff separately.

1140
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,410
不是的 我们还是继续调查
No, look, we can still investigate

1141
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,210
一起调查
together.

1142
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,890
你懂的 只是一起的话 要公开调查
It's just, you know, now it'll be an open thing.

1143
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,930
你想公开调查？
You want an open investigation?

1144
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,460
我不知道 这是不是我想要的
I don't know if that's what I want.

1145
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,390
我只是觉得 现在是时候去试试了
All right? I just think it's healthy right now for us to try it.

1146
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,160
好的
Okay.

1147
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,880

Okay, so I guess I'll just catch you later, then.

1149
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,270
你还好吗
You okay?

1150
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,180
不 你现在不能抱我
No, you can't hug me right now.

1151
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,300
那你需要钱坐车或其他什么吗
Do you need money for a cab or anything?

1152
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,000
不用 我不需要钱坐车
No, I don't need money for a cab.

1153
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,480
好吧
Okay.

1154
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,680
我都不知道我他妈的这是在哪
I don't know where the fuck I am right now.

1155
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,070
嘿 Lauren
Hey, Lauren.

1156
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,480
我只想一整天躺在床上看老友记
I just want to get in bed and watch friends all day.

1157
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,860

1169
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:32,310
我勒个擦 他太棒了
Holy shit, he's good.

1170
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,340
你们没人告诉Mcquaid 说他很厉害吧
None of you tell mcquaid that he's good, all right?

1171
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,700
要是你们说了 他有可能就会离开去打职业联赛了
If you do, he'll leave this shitty program.

1172
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,360
随着时间的流逝 我们只剩下一球了

1175
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,500
就像他们两个人在用同一个大脑
 It's like these two share a single brain, Bob.

1176
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,200
说得对 他们俩一人用一半
That's right, Jim. They both have one half a brain.

1177
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,790
球迷们又冲向球场了
And the crowd rushes the field

1178

I can't jump up. I got a broken ankle.

1185
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:20,760

I'll see you later.

1354
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,920
好的  -最开心的一晚
Okay. Best night ever.

1355
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,380
好的 再见
Okay. Bye.

1356
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,260
拜拜
Bye.

1357
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,520
你在这多久了？
How long have you been there?

1358
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,030
你能想到有多久 就有多久
Like, the longest amount of time you could think of right now.

1359
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,680
这不是针对你的
This stuff wasn't meant for you.

1360
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:49,830
主要是隐私问题
It was meant to be private.

1361
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,680
是不是我应该坐在这儿
 So, am I supposed to just sit here and not act like

1362
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,300
假装什么都没听到
I hear every one of your problems?

1363
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:58,040
你有99个问题 但重回年轻是不可能的了
You got 99 problems, but being young isn't one.

1364
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,650
你只是嫉妒我和Maya的亲密关系
You're just jealous because Maya and I have a real connection.

1365
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,540
我和我的祖父母关系也很亲密
I'm pretty close with my grandpa, too.

1366
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,360
你比Cynthia还要糟糕
You're more messed up than Cynthia was,

1367
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,450
他每周到要找校精神医师三次
and she went to the school shrink three times a week.

1368
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,240
为什么  -我不知道
Why? I don't know.

1369
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,410
不过他给她很多药丸
But he gave her a ton of pills and shit.

1370
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,000
或许他可以把你的这张老脸治好
Maybe he could give you something for your weird old face.

1371
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:15,990
好吧
Okay.

1372
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:21,260
嘿  -你迟到了
Hey. You're late.

1373
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,850
不是的 其实我在忙着调查
No, actually, I was busy with the investigation.

1374
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,080
这里是Cynthia理疗师的办公室 这才是我们要调查
This is Cynthia's therapist's office. This is our investigation.

1375
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,140
好的
(Whispering) All right.

1376
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,060
你看着门
Watch the door.

1377
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,220
哦 这就是我能做的 就只是看门
Oh, is that all I'm good for? Just watching a fucking door?

1378
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:48,730
找到了
Got it.

1379
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,800
病人是药物引起的狂想症
"Patient exhibits drug-induced paranoia.

1380
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,430
认为她有生命危险
"Believes her life is in danger."

1381
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,070
门 门开了
Uh, door, door.

1382
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,100
嘿
Hey.

1383
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,440
没人和我说 九点有会诊
I wasn't told that I had a 9:00 A.M. session.

1384
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,620
嗯 对 我们约了九点的会诊
Yeah, no, we're your 9:00 A.M. that's us.

1385
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,870
我们基本恢复了
And we're cured.

1386
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,590
非常感谢你 你真是个了不起的医生
Thank you very much. You're an amazing doctor.

1387
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,620
拜托 你们以为你们是第一对
Please. You think you're the first partners

1388
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:15,320
刚和我交谈 就想逃走的基友吗
only to try to run when you're first faced with talking with me?

1389
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,890
你怎么知道我们是基友的
How the fuck did you know we were partners?

1390
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,660
他不知道我们是基友
He doesn't know we're partners.

1391
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,960
我怀疑你们是基友
(Whispering) I suspect you're partners.

1392
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,650
一段关系是需要不断地维护
A relationship is something that requires constant work.

1393
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,570
我觉得这个我们在高中就学过了
Which is what I thought we learned in high school.

1394
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,020
所以你在高中是个好学生了
So you are high school sweethearts.

1395
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,490
我早就发现了
I picked up on that early.

1396
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:29,940
请继续阐述吧
Please, continue the dialogue.

1397
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,380
医生
Doc.

1398
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,410
我只是觉得有时候
I just feel like sometimes

1399
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:35,910
他甚至不想试着交流了
he's not even trying anymore.

1400
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,960
就像 这段感情不值得拯救
Like this isn't even worth saving.

1401
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,620
哦 好 我只是有时觉得
 Jenko: Oh, okay. Well, sometimes I feel like

1402
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,000
我们应该阳刚一点
that we should be more like the yangs.

1403
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,850
也许我应该学学你的漂亮的Zook
Or maybe I should be more like your beautiful zook.

1404
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,020
去你妈的   -去你丫的
Oh, go fuck yourself! You go fuck yourself.

1405
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:45,920
好了 -你太自私了
Okay. You're so selfish.

1406
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,390
好了 骂够了吧 -哦 天啊
All right. That's a lot of fucking. Oh, my God.

1407
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,580
有时我会让病人们做一些身体上的接触
sometimes I like to have the participants make physical contact.

1408
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:53,500
为什么你们不牵牵手呢
Why don't you hold hands?

1409
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,070
好的  -我不干
Okay. I'm not doing that.

1410
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,620
嗯 -你看到了吧
Hmm? Do you see?

1411
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:57,930
把手伸出来
Reach out your hand.

1412
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,440
我...
I'm...

1413
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,090
他已经把手伸出来了
He's literally reaching out for you.

1414
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,170
他不会和我牵手的
He won't hold my hand.

1415
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:02,980
我不要牵手
Jenko: I'm not doing it.

1416
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,910
我需要你这么做
I kind of need you to do it.

1417
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:06,140
他不会和我牵手的 -哦 你
He won't hold my hand. Oh, you...

1418
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,050
你要十指相扣
You got to interlock it, though.

1419
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,870
如果你没有十指相扣 就不算牵手
If you don't interlock it, it's not hand-holding.

1420
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,260
好吧
Fine.

1421
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,860
我们还是做朋友吧
We might as well just be friends

1422
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,350
不要当基友了
and not partners.

1423
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:14,500
很好 是吧
Nice, right?

1424
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:17,140
好的 你看到了没 这段关系很牢固
Okay, you see this? This is strong.

1425
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,420
但我想要的是这样
What I want to be able to have is this.

1426
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,670
是这样
Is this...

1427
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:25,960
我想要的是这样 即使不牵手
 I want to be able to have that, that same thing, in, like

1428
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,400
也能心有灵犀
without actually having to do it.

1429
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:29,560
你的基友让你难堪吗
Are you embarrassed of your partner?

1430
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,800
没有 当然没有 好吗
No, not at all. Okay?

1431
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,650
你们俩为何要联合起来对付我
And why the fuck are you guys ganging up on me?

1432
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,270
应该对付他 真的
Gang up on him. Okay, seriously.

1433
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,380
好的 -他很粘人
Okay, okay. He's clingy.

1434
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,200
他害怕做他自己
He literally is terrified of being by himself.

1435
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,590
听着 我知道Zook是你的兄弟
Look, I know zook's your buddy

1436
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,660
你不想让他服罪认法
and you don't want him to be guilty,

1437
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:41,680
但他就是我们要找的人
but he's our guy.

1438
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,000
不是 他其实不是我们要找的人 我知道
No, he's actually not our guy. I would know.

1439
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,390
知道吗 我们有时候抓住一件事情不放
Now, you know, we sometimes cling to things

1440
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:47,800
因为很熟悉 很舒服
because they're familiar and comfortable.

1441
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:50,060
我把这个法则叫做先入为主
I teach about a principle called embedding.

1442
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,430
看清事实吧事实上
Look at the facts. Matter of fact,

1443
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,030
Zook有纹身 他也认识Cynthia
Zook has the tattoo. He knew Cynthia.

1444
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,440
我知道他第一次见你
I know the first time he met you,

1445
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,890
你把他的三明治撞掉 落在他的脚上
you dropped a fucking sandwich on his foot

1446
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,940
他还对你笑
and he smiled at you,

1447
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,440
你完全被蒙蔽了眼睛
but you are completely blind to the fact...

1448
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,970
你刚刚说什么先入为主   -先入为主
What'd you say embedding was? Embedding?

1449
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,670
哦 先入为主就是我们倾向于去注意
Oh, embedding is our tendency to latch on to

1450
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,830
我们第一次获得的信息
the first bit of information that we're offered

1451
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,910
忽视 甚至是无视 自相矛盾的信息
and overlooking, or even ignoring, contradictory information.

1452
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,570
这是个很棒的法则
It's a fascinating principle...

1453
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,040
闭嘴我在思考
Shut up. I'm thinking.

1454
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:16,520
我们有没有可能也是那样
You think it's possible that

1455
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,480
我们先入为主
we embedded?

1456
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,320
什么？是我们喝醉还是其他什么的
What, like when we were drunk or something

1457
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,220
我们太主观了  -好了 我要推荐....
We embedded each other? Okay. I'm gonna recommend...

1458
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,140
好了 你可以出去了
Okay, you can leave the room.

1459
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,540
快点滚出去
Just get the fuck out.

1460
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,100
快点出去 你听到他说的没
Get the fuck out. You heard him.

1461
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,660
治疗方向不对吧
This took a turn.

1462
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,640
1 2
One, two...

1463
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,930
好的 真有效果
Okay. Yep. Good session. (Door closes)

1464
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,390
我们第一次看到
The first time we saw the photo

1465
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,560
Cynthia买whyphy的照片时
of Cynthia buying whyphy,

1466
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,950
Dickson说 这家伙是毒贩子
 dickson said,  "this guy's the dealer."

1467
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,510
我们所想所做的一切都是根据他这句话
Everything we've done and thought has been based on that fact,

1468
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,770
但是如果Dickson搞错了呢？
but what if dickson was wrong?

1469
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,130
我们忽略了其他所有线索
And we've ignored all the other clues.

1470
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,780
那如果Cynthia不是买家呢
Schmidt:  What if Cynthia  wasn't the buyer?

1471
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:46,870
如果Cynthia才是毒贩子呢
 What if Cynthia  was the dealer?

1472
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,180
队长 我们有一件非常非常重要的事要告诉你
Captain, we have something really, really important to tell you about.

1473
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,420
队长?
Captain?

1474
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,550
你在穿凯夫拉（防弹衣）吗？
Are you wearing kevlar?

1475
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,370
现在 先生们 我们不能坐在这 还假装
Now, gentlemen, we're not gonna sit here and pretend

1476
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,460
什么事情都没发生过
there's not a big-ass elephant in the room.

1477
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,750
到底是怎么回事？
What the fuck is going on?

1478
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:09,830
就是这么回事
This is what the fuck is going on.

1479
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,970
卧槽 卧槽
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1480
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,080
卧槽  不是吧
Oh, shit! No!

1481
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,650
这不可能是真的
That is not happening right now! No!

1482
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:31,050
嘿 伙计们 他上了老大的女儿
Hey, y'all, he's fucking the captain's daughter! Yo!

1483
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,130
他每说一次这破事...
Every time he say that shit...

1484
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,980
...你裤裆里第三条腿就要注意了
...that's another foot in your ass.

1485
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,730
Schmidt 你真是... 这是发生过的最好的事了
Schmidt, you clearly... Yo, this is the best thing ever!

1486
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,770
Schmidt上了老大的女儿
Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter!

1487
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,140
Schmidt上了老大的女儿
(Singsong) Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter!

1488
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,330
Schmidt上了老大的女儿
Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter!

1489
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,830
操 日
Shit! Fuck!

1490
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,850
你上了Dickson队长的女儿
You fucked captain dickson's daughter?

1491
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,480
老大 这他妈的
Captain, what the...

1492
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:59,820
你简直是给了他一个耳光
You bragged to him to his face.

1493
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:01,260
直接打他脸上 老大
To his actual face. Captain...

1494
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,510
你明白吗 就这张脸 好一记耳光啊
Do you understand that this face right here, you bragged to that face?

1495
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:08,860
你还为他上你女儿而跟他击掌庆祝
You actually high-fived schmidt for fucking your daughter.

1496
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,400
我了个大操
Holy shit!

1497
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,400
我的天啊 这真是
Oh, my God! This is...

1498
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,870
这其实也没有那么好笑
It's really not that funny.

1499
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,300
我只是想说
Schmidt: I just want to say that

1500
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:22,240
我只是觉得你没说你女儿
it was bizarre not to share the fact

1501
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,910
在美罗城大学太奇怪了
that your daughter went to mc state.

1502
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,030
我也觉得奇怪
I think it's bizarre

1503
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,180
我到现在还没阉了你
that I haven't cut your motherfucking nuts off.

1504
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,620
要不让老大揍你脸一次
What if captain gets to punch you in the face one time,

1505
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,780
特别特别狠的那种
really, really, really hard?

1506
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:34,550
不
Nah.

1507
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,410
我有更好的办法
I got something way better than that.

1508
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,250
你认为Cynthia是卖家?
You think Cynthia was the dealer?

1509
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,490
如果这个卖家死了 我们去深入调查？
How the fuck we gonna infiltrate the dealer if the dealer is dead?

1510
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,390
我们一定要阻止他们继续贩毒
We have to stop treating this

1511
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,400
就像这是上次一样
like it's exactly the same as last time.

1512
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:54,380
我们还有更大的麻烦  预算里没多少钱了
And we got a bigger problem. No more money in the budget.

1513
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,330
啥?我以为我们有凯特-布兰切特资助的
What? I thought we had Cate blanchett.

1514
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:58,170
凯特-布兰切特？
Cate blanchett?

1515
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,980
我以为预算里有凯特-布兰切特资助
Yeah, I thought we had Cate blanchett with the budget.

1516
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,060
你是说空白支票
You mean "carte blanche."

1517
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,580
就是这个
That one.

1518
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,050
欢迎回来 蠢货兄弟
Welcome back, dum-dum.

1519
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:09,400
我们以前确实有空白支票 现在没了
We did have carte blanche. Not no more.

1520
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,480
你开始买的那个贵家伙
You got that expensive chase in the beginning,

1521
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:14,910
昂贵的装备 这间办公室
that expensive equipment, this fucking office...

1522
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,660
看起来像是钢铁侠才会用的   太贵了
This look like some shit iron man would have. Shit's expensive!

1523
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:21,980
我还买了这双800美元的鞋 你他妈都看不到啊
I got on $800 shoes, and you can't even see the motherfuckers.

1524
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,990
所以你们俩现在是在十字路口
So now you two motherfuckers is in the crosshairs.

1525
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,700
我警告你俩
I'm warning you,

1526
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,260
找到供货人
find the supplier,

1527
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,540
但是别花组织上一毛钱
but don't cost the department no more money.

1528
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:35,530
听着 Zook那件事我向你道歉
Look, I apologize about the zook thing.

1529
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,470
你说的对 他不是卖家
You were right, he's not the dealer.

1530
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,020
好 很好 你道歉了
Okay, great. You apologized.

1531
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,010
有什么用啊 伙计
What's that worth, man?

1532
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,720
现在我们什么线索也没有  我们该怎么办
Now we have no leads. What are we supposed to do now?

1533
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,530
做警察该做的
Police work.

1534
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:53,730
操
Fuck.

1535
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,200
别把死人的假老二往老子身上扔
Don't throw a fucking dead person's dildo at me.

1536
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,760
我们是在工作 好吗
We're at work right now, okay?

1537
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,190
现在学生已经不看书了 不是吗
Jenko: Kids don't check out books anymore, right?

1538
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,160
我认为他们都不会阅读了
I don't even think they know how to read.

1539
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,260
放书的地方
 - Book place.

1540
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,250
图书馆
Library.

1541
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,090
供货人把毒品
The supplier is putting drugs

1542
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,720
藏在图书馆的书里
inside the books in the library,

1543
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,340
显然没人会去图书馆
where literally no one goes anymore, man.

1544
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,060
然后卖家再拿走那本书
And the dealers check out the books.

1545
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,600
我们马上就要抓住供货人了
We're going to catch the supplier. (Cell phone vibrating)

1546
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,760
你有觉得这有多酷...  -等一下
Do you realize how cool... Wait, one sec, one sec.

1547
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:24,830
怎么了 伙计
What's up, dude?

1548
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,900
嘿 伙计 你在哪?
Hey, dude, where are you?

1549
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:28,800
我们在热身  比赛就要开始了
We're warming up. The game's about to start.

1550
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,380
好吧 伙计  呃 听着 我要...
All right, man. Um, look, I'm just gonna...

1551
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,400
我马上到
I'm coming.

1552
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,240
好的 等会见
All right, later.

1553
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,840
你要干嘛去 别扔下我一个人啊
What are you doing? Don't leave me hanging.

1554
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,070
 我必须得去 要不我就会暴露身份
Dude, I got to go or I'm gonna blow my cover, okay?

1555
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,260
你一个人可以的  我两个小时以后回来
You can do this alone. I'll be back in two hours.

1556
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:39,970
你可以的
You got this.

1557
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,140
你吓到我了
You scared me.

1558
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:09,640
就是这里了
Man: This is the place.

1559
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,480
要是其他人约我们来看 他们是如何运作的
You'd think if somebody wants to show us their operation,

1560
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:12,640
至少会准时
they'd at least be on time.

1561
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,310
看看这破地方
Look at this crap. Huh?

1562
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,550
我确实很怀念从前...   - 靠
- I do miss the days...    - Shit.

1563
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,040
他在干嘛?    - ...那时还是正常的毒品
-What's he doing here?    - ...When people did normal drugs.

1564
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:22,830
这是什么?  糖豆吗?
What is this? Jelly beans?

1565
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:24,700
垃圾!
Crap!

1566
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,040
站好 接住
Set, hut!

1567
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:29,180
Mcquaid冲过来接住了球
Bob:  Mcquaid crosses  in an end-around.

1568
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:32,810
假动作  他们俩真是默契搭档
It's a trick play!  These two are  practically interchangeable.

1569
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,250
Mcquaid传给haythe
Mcquaid throws down  the field to haythe.

1570
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,240
然后他接稳 触地得分
And he hangs on  for the touchdown!

1571
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:43,640
他们就像在同一豌豆荚里
Jim:  These two are  peas in a pod, Bob,

1572
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,040
不过不是小绿豆
but instead of  little green balls,

1573
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,540
他们是人类 是橄榄球运动员
they are human  football players.

1574
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,750
为美罗城大学黄金二人组再欢呼一次吧
Announcer:  Let's hear it  once again, mc state,  for your dynamic duo.

1575
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,950
我去  我兄弟又需要我去帮忙
Oh, shit. My brother needs me again.

1576
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,130
听着 你也知道 忠诚很酷
Look, you know, loyalty's cool,

1577
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,060
我很羡慕这样
and I admire it,

1578
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,050
我知道他是你的兄弟
and I know he's your brother.

1579
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,050
但是你不能让自己被别人控制
But you can't allow yourself to be held down by a guy

1580
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,570
就因为他不肯放手
just because he won't let go.

1581
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,140
对 呃...
Jenko: Yeah. Um...

1582
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,210
我去上个厕所
I gotta take a piss.

1583
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,760
那孩子让我们这样等着太不礼貌了
Man: The kid's pretty rude to make us wait like this.

1584
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,280
你闭嘴
Can you shut it?

1585
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,870
90年代的老式毒品怎么了
What's wrong with those classic drugs from the '90s?

1586
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,790
海洛因 你知道的 可卡因
Heroin, you know, cocaine...

1587
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,460
- 嘿 嘿   - 喔 靠
- Hey, hey.   - Whoa. Shit.

1588
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,530
- 我到了 你丫高兴了?   - 嘘
- I'm fucking here. You happy?   - Shh!

1589
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,190
鬼见愁就在这边 好吗?
The ghost is right there, okay?

1590
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,660
他要在这见供货商
He's about to meet up with the supplier.

1591
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,180
过去看看    - 你小点声
- Hey. Check that out.    - Jenko: You shush.

1592
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,130
你才是那个说话的    - 你声音太大
- You're the one fucking talking.   - You're being so fucking loud.

1593
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,470
你赶紧闭嘴
You shut the fuck up.

1594
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:46,800
这边怎么了   - 完了
- What's going on here?   - Schmidt: Shit!

1595
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,500
你打扰了一场销魂的口交
(Stuttering) You're interrupting a really stellar blow job.

1596
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,340
卧槽  我才刚硬起来
Oh, fuck, I just came so hard!

1597
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:54,580
怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

1598
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,180
没事 有一对断袖癖而已
It's okay. It's just a couple of faggots.

1599
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,200
你刚说什么
Hey, yo, what the fuck did you just say?

1600
01:10:58,930 --> 01:10:59,880
你刚称呼我们"同性恋"?
Did you just call us "faggots"?

1601
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,740
是他说你在给他口交
He said you were sucking his dick.

1602
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,630
这都2014年了 傻叉
It's 2014, asshole.

1603
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,050
你不能用"同性恋"这个词
You can't fucking use "faggot."

1604
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,050
基佬可以  男同也行
"Gay" is okay. "Homosexual," maybe.

1605
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:09,580
你要是认识这个人 你也可以叫他"同志"
And if you know the person, you might be able to call them a "queer."

1606
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:11,480
要是他们比较有幽默感的话 不过我可没有
If they have a great sense of humor, but I don't.

1607
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,420
抱歉 他选修了一门人类性学课程
I'm sorry, he took one human sexuality class,

1608
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,330
他以为他是Harvey Milk(同性恋政治家)
he thinks he's Harvey milk.

1609
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:16,200
我的老天 你就不能
Oh, my God. Will you please,

1610
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,200
哪怕只有一次  别拆我的台
just for once, just back me up?

1611
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,960
你为啥就不能动一次脑袋呢？
Why can't you just use your head for once?

1612
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:21,440
你想让我用头?  - 行
Oh. You want me to use my head? Fine.

1613
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,130
现在怎样？ 他妈的混蛋
Oh, yeah, what's up now, motherfuckers?

1614
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:25,780
还记得我吗?
You remember me?

1615
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,940
我是你的美...
I'm your best night...

1616
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,410
我是你的噩梦
I'm your worst nightmare.

1617
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,900
喔 老兄 我的记忆力
Oh, man, it's my memory.

1618
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:32,820
最近越来越差了
It's getting worse lately.

1619
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:34,000
你是警察吗?
Are you the police?

1620
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,140
对 我是 你他妈的混蛋都被逮捕了
Yeah, that's right. And you motherfuckers are all under arrest.

1621
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,660
你的枪呢?
Where's your gun?

1622
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,330
啥?   - 你有枪吗?
What? Do you have guns?

1623
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:43,570
没
No.

1624
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,170
我没有
No, I don't.

1625
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,530
可是我们有枪
'Cause we have guns.

1626
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:53,180
为什么你不把枪放下 咱们像个爷们一样打一场
Well, why don't you put your guns down, and let's fight like men?

1627
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:56,570
因为我们有枪
Because we have guns.

1628
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,410
Schmidt 跑!   - 抓住他!
Schmidt, run! Get him!

1629
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:01,780
操!
Shit! (Guns firing)

1630
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,280
这能有多难吗?打中他们!
Ghost: How hard can it be? Shoot them!

1631
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,060
操 操 操!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1632
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,170
打他们!  打他们!
Shoot them! Shoot them!

1633
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,080
过来 走这边 比较快
Come on, this way, it's faster.

1634
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,990
不 走这边   - Schmidt Schmidt
No, just come this... Schmidt! Schmidt!

1635
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,130
快点 行吗?
Hurry up, okay?

1636
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,690
Schmidt  你能快点吗?
Schmidt, will you hurry up!

1637
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,710
别冲我大吼大叫 我会分心的!
Stop yelling at me! You're distracting me!

1638
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,260
Schmidt 快点   我们走!
Schmidt, come on! Let's go!

1639
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,710
我跳不下去!  我又不是蜘蛛侠!
I can't jump down! I'm not, like, fucking spider-man!

1640
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,620
我去弄辆车
I'm gonna get the car.

1641
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:34,440
还是楼梯快多了
Stairs are so much faster.

1642
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:37,050
这就是你弄的车?
That's the car you got?

1643
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,970
很抱歉不是兰博基尼  闭嘴赶紧上车吧
I'm sorry it's not a fucking lambo. Shut up and get in.

1644
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,200
他们还在追我们吗?
Are they even still chasing us?

1645
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,140
对 他们还在追赶我们!
Yes, they're still chasing us!

1646
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,800
为什么你要那么做?  我们马上就能抓住供货人了
Why did you do that? We were about to catch the supplier.

1647
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,570
出什么毛病了你?
What's wrong with you?

1648
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,970
你看啊 如果你什么也不说
Look, if you don't say something,

1649
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,360
人们永远都不会停止他们的歧视
people will never stop discriminating.

1650
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,930
你能想个办法吗?
Will you please do something

1651
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,390
这玩意跑的这么慢
about how slow this thing's going?

1652
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:03,310
我去!   - 小心  小心!
Oh, shit! Watch out, watch out!

1653
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,960
这就像是一个小头盔车
That is just like a little helmet machine.

1654
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,730
我们不能再撞坏其他东西了!
We can't destroy any more stuff!

1655
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,210
我们不能再挥霍组织上的钱了!
We can't waste any more of the department's money!

1656
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:24,940
当心那个取款机!
Watch out for that cash machine!

1657
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,620
走哪边?   走哪边?   走哪边?
Which way? Which way? Which way?

1658
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:31,530
哪边都行 只要便宜!
Schmidt: Whichever way's cheaper!

1659
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:33,880
右边?  你走了右边?
Right? You went right?

1660
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,420
你本可以去停车场的
You could've gone in a parking lot,

1661
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,670
你去了雕塑公园?
you went to the sculpture garden?

1662
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,940
你知道这得多贵吗?
Do you know how expensive that's gonna be?

1663
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:43,740
我去!
Shit!

1664
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,860
看起来好像他们是故意去撞的
It's like they're trying to hit 'em or something.

1665
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:46,770
我是说 虽然看起来很酷
I mean, it looks cool,

1666
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,400
但是 就是 这太奢侈了
but, I mean, it's just so wasteful.

1667
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,430
他们正在撞毁一切!
Schmidt: They're destroying everything!

1668
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,190
老大会灭了咱们的!
Captain's gonna kill us! (Tires screeching)

1669
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,650
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

1670
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:58,170
好吧 我们去机器人实验室里甩掉他们
All right, we're gonna lose 'em in the robotics lab.

1671
01:13:58,190 --> 01:13:58,660
什么?
What?

1672
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,970
哦 不 我们毁了一切!
Schmidt: Oh, no! Oh, we broke everything!

1673
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,120
这里有很多很贵的东西!
There was a lot of expensive stuff in there!

1674
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,490
我去!
Oh, shit!

1675
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,930
他们要去体育馆!
They're going into the stadium!

1676
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,360
听着Schmidt 我得告诉你个事
Listen, schmidt, I gotta tell you something.

1677
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,480
我得到了奖学金
I got offered a scholarship

1678
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:21,760
明年在这里继续玩橄榄球
to play football here next year.

1679
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,520
Zook说我可以和他住一个寝室 你明白的
And zook said I could room with him, you know,

1680
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:28,380
所以我在想 我也许可以这样做
so I was thinking that I could do that, maybe.

1681
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,230
什么?  你不能又当警察
What? You can't be a cop

1682
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:31,990
还留在这里跟Zook玩橄榄球
and stay here and play football with zook.

1683
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,650
不 听着 我知道 好吗?  只是...
No, look, I know, okay? It's just...

1684
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:36,170
我跟Zook不会有矛盾 我们是类似的
There's no friction with me and zook. We're the same.

1685
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,370
你想退出么? 想退出你就直说
Do you want out? If you want out, just say it.

1686
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,420
不是  我不是想退出  好吗?
No, I don't want out, okay?

1687
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,840
只是 当我在橄榄球赛场上的时候
It's just, when I'm on the football field

1688
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,160
我弯腰过人 我感觉我在飞
and I'm diving for a pass, I feel like I can fly.

1689
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,680
好吗 我和你在一起
All right? And when I'm with you,

1690
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,340
只是觉得你在拖累我
it just feels like you hold me down.

1691
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,250
我只是希望你能和我一起飞
I just wish you could fly with me.

1692
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:53,120
Statesmen赢了 34比14
Bob:  And the statesmen  win, 34-14.

1693
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,070
粉丝们都涌到了球场上
(All cheering) Jim:  And there go  the fans onto the field.

1694
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,570
Jenko!

1695
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,930
我嘞个草!
Jesus Christ!

1696
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,230
伙计 刹车失灵了  - 什么?
- Dude, the brakes are out.  -  What?

1697
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,770
都快滚一边去!
Get the fuck out of the way!

1698
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,620
你赶紧跳下去  你跳啊  跳啊!
You gotta jump. You gotta jump, jump, jump!

1699
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:18,930
不
No.

1700
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,410
操
Fuck!

1701
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,470
我们走 老板 我们走
Let's go, boss. We gotta go. (Laughs)

1702
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,680
你做到了!  太棒了!  耶!
You did it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1703
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,540
你被逮捕了 先生
You're under arrest, sir.

1704
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,410
我是警察
Hey, I'm an officer, all right?

1705
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,050
带我走吧  我等会再解释
Just take me in. I'll explain later.

1706
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,110
不管他的事 他是个学生 他什么也没做
No, no, no. Hey, he's a student. He didn't do anything.

1707
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,750
等等 等等 你干嘛呢 你干嘛呢?
Wait, wait. What are you doing? What are you doing?

1708
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,050
我
I, um...

1709
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,220
我替你做决定了
I decided for you.

1710
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,240
继续玩橄榄球吧
Just stick with football.

1711
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,010
我不能给你像他们给你的感觉
I can't give you the same feeling that these guys can.

1712
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,580
也许我们只是一次性的搭档
Maybe we were only supposed to do this once.

1713
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:13,020
什么?
What?

1714
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:15,000
这是我人生中最好的时刻
Dude, this is the fucking best moment of my life!

1715
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,800
我们走 兄弟!
Let's go, man!

1716
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:23,550
Mcquaid! Mcquaid! Mcquaid!

1717
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,120
嘿 玛雅·安吉罗（诗人）
Maya: Hey, Maya angelou.

1718
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,520
谢谢你骗了我
Thanks for lying to me.

1719
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,190
兰博基尼 !  酷毙了!
Both: Lam-bros! Yes!

1720
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:08,950
您今晚过的怎么样 先生?   - 很好 谢谢
How are we doing tonight, sir? Good, thanks.

1721
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:10,890
您是等人还是自己用餐?
Are we waiting on anybody or you dining alone?

1722
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,920
也许有人会顺便过来 但是我可以...
Someone may swing by, but we can...

1723
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,280
我可以自己先点餐
We can order without them.

1724
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,900
我们确认并逮捕了理疗师Karl Murphy
We have identified  and arrested one  Dr. Karl Murphy,

1725
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,330
我们在他的办公室内发现了whyphy残留
who was found with  whyphy residue  throughout his office...

1726
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:25,600
...他与死者有着密切的关系
...and had a close  personal relationship  with the deceased.

1727
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,850
就像我们最近破获的一起发生在高中的案子
Exactly like a case  we had recently at  a high school.

1728
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,820
完全一样
Exactly the same.

1729
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:34,100
这案子结了
The case is closed.

1730
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,550
我说 你那边完了之后下一步打算怎么办?
You know, like, what you're gonna do after you're out of here?

1731
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,280
你不能扔石头
You're not supposed to throw rocks.

1732
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,000
什么?
What?

1733
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,760
你不能扔石头
You're not supposed to throw rocks.

1734
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,010
# 我一点也不想你#
(Groans)  # I ain't missing you at all #

1735
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:58,130
# 自从你离开以后#
 # since you've been gone away #

1736
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,900
一人份的龙虾
the lobster for one person.

1737
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,280
一人份的就行
Enough for one person only.

1738
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:06,740
# 不管我的朋友们说什么#
 # No matter  what my friends say #

1739
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,200
我注意到这个whyphy案子中的一些细节
I found something in this whyphy case that caught my attention.

1740
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,340
滚出我的办公室
Get the fuck out of my office.

1741
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,910
长官 你不...   - 我们抓住了嫌疑人
- Sir, you don't...   - We caught the guy.

1742
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,390
你今天除了锻炼身体什么也不打算做吗?
Hey, you want to do anything else other than work out today?

1743
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:24,090
比如什么?
Like what?

1744
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,050
来吧 伙计  他们只是龙虾而已 伙计
Come on, dude. They're just lobsters, dude.

1745
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,600
来吧  别害怕
Come on. No, don't be afraid.

1746
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,010
它会抓你的脸的 它会抓你的脸的
It's gonna claw your face. It's gonna claw your face.

1747
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,780
我们以后的生活就会像这样 兄弟
It's gonna be like this, dude, for the rest of our lives.

1748
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,210
# 今晚穿过这漫长的距离#
 #down this long  distance line tonight #

1749
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:46,500
# 我一点也不想你#
 # I ain't missing you at all #

1750
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:52,960
# 自从你离开以后#
 # since you've been gone away #

1751
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,840
# 我没有想念你#
 #I ain't missing you

1752
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:02,770
# 不管我的朋友怎么说#
 # no matter  what my friends say #

1753
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,630
# 没有想念你#
 #ain't missing you #

1754
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,770
- 嗨   - 嗨
- hey.    - Hey.

1755
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:11,780
你来这做什么？
What are you doing here?

1756
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:14,800
过来看看你过的怎么样
Just came to see how you are.

1757
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,900
我很他妈好
I'm doing fucking great.

1758
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:18,790
比从前任何时候都开心
I'm the happiest I've ever been,

1759
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,500
我一个人也很好
so I'm just having a great time with myself.

1760
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,160
你若安好 便是晴天
I'm glad you're having a good time with yourself.

1761
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:25,310
我现在是个独立艺人了 像碧昂斯那样
I'm a solo artist now, like Beyonce.

1762
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,460
我以前的命运像普通孩子们一样  现在我只是
I used to have the other destiny's children, but now I'm just, uh,

1763
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,860
一个孤独的超级巨星而已
a lone superstar.

1764
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,760
替你开心
Happy for you.

1765
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:36,230
只是一个拥有梦想和甜美歌声的白皙的公主而已
Just a light-skinned princess with a dream and an amazing voice.

1766
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,400
太好了
That's great.

1767
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:38,900
你呢?
How are you?

1768
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,850
我很好
I'm pretty great.

1769
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,010
我过的很消沉...你知道Zook是个多么消沉的人
I just chill and... You know how chill zook is.

1770
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:46,290
Zook是那么的消沉
Zook's such a chill guy.

1771
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,540
像块冰一样
Just like ice.

1772
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:48,990
这让我替你感到开心
That makes me so happy for you.

1773
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,380
所以 听着 我只是想说
So, look, I just wanted to say that, like,

1774
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,340
我在想这个案子
I was thinking about the case,

1775
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:59,250
我只是担心他们抓错人了
and I was worried that they got the wrong guy for it.

1776
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:01,970
我也认为他不是嫌疑人
I don't think he's the guy, either.

1777
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:03,230
是吗?
Yeah?

1778
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,930
我查了鬼见愁的资料
I looked into the ghost's background,

1779
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,550
我看到他给一个美罗城大学的在校生交学费
and I saw that he pays tuition for a student at mc state.

1780
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,210
你认为鬼见愁会是供货人的父亲?
You think the ghost could be the supplier's dad?

1781
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:10,950
有可能
Maybe.

1782
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,440
这是一条很好的情报
Okay, that's a pretty good piece of information.

1783
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:13,420
谢谢
Thank you.

1784
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,610
我听说whyphy又卷土重来了
Well, I heard whyphy's coming back in a big way.

1785
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,610
有人大批量带着那玩意
Someone's bringing a shit-ton of that stuff

1786
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,280
到墨西哥港 为了春假的供应
down to puerto, Mexico, for spring break.

1787
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,750
如果这真的发生了 那么whyphy会像病毒一样
And if that happens, whyphy is going viral.

1788
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,720
在全国的每一所学校蔓延开来
It's gonna be at every college in the country.

1789
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,260
我觉得还是我的情报更有力一些
I think my information was stronger.

1790
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:28,440
听着 如果你... 你想要
Look, if you... If you want to,

1791
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:30,850
我们可以一起去
we could go down there.

1792
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,660
像搭档一样?
Like together?

1793
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,080
我们不一定非得叫搭档
We don't have to put a label on it.

1794
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,490
就像 一次性的 临时的
Just, like, one-time. One-time thing.

1795
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,630
彼此没有郑重的承诺和压力
No big commitment or stress to each other.

1796
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,120
一次性的 临时的
Just, like, one-time. One-time thing.

1797
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:45,890
那你的学校 橄榄球 和美好的新生活怎么办?
What about school and football and your wonderful new life?

1798
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:47,950
我有时间
I have time off.

1799
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,900
我现在放春假了
I'm on spring break.

1800
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:06,940
这酸爽
Cool tingling.

1801
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,330
还能放下这个宝贝
Got room for one of these babies.

1802
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,630
手榴弹 你干嘛要放在那里?
A grenade. Why you gonna put it there?

1803
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:12,990
太不卫生了
That's just unsanitary.

1804
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,380
感觉爽
Feels right.

1805
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,080
你漏了一个地方
Missed a spot.

1806
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,500
你知道这次只是一次性对吗？
You know this is just a one-time thing, right?

1807
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:42,830
我知道
I know.

1808
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,720
所以你不会觉得这很奇怪吗
So you're not gonna be weird about this?

1809
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,830
好吧
Okay.

1810
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:57,370
很好
Both: Perfect.

1811
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,510
春假 干他娘的
Spring break, motherfucker.

1812
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:05,550
你没看到是我先出来的吗   - 借过一下
- Did you not see that I was going first?    - Excuse you.

1813
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,790
借过一下   - 你想先走?
- Excuse you.   - You want to go first?

1814
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,840
春假他妈的来了
Emcee:  Spring break,  motherfuckers!

1815
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:15,140
#I be divin' in the crowd#

01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,790
# shake my dreads,  actin' wild#

1820
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,100
#can't turn down#

1821
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,010
#All I wanna do is party#

1822
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,620
#my head keep  on spinning around#

1823
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,330
#baby girl,  why don't you first#

1824
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,000
#drop it to the ground#

1825
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,620
#I be divin' in the crowd#

1826
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,250
#shake my dreads,  actin' wild#

1827
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,860
#can't do lean,  too blowed out#

1828
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:51,690
#too turnt up,  I can't turn down#

1829
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,300
# can't turn down  can't turn down#

1830
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,830
#can't turn down  can't turn down#

1831
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:56,600
#can't turn down  can't turn down#

1832
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,900
# can't turn down  can't turn down #

1833
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:04,600
我的天啊!  我满身大汗!
my gosh! I'm sweaty.

1834
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,560
你们真的在这吃东西么?
You guys are actually eating stuff in here?

1835
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,210
这太疯狂了
That's so crazy.

1836
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:10,050
兄弟 麻烦让一让
Jenko: Come on, man, put your dick away.

1837
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,110

Put your fucking dick away.

1838

楼上 楼上 我们走
Upstairs, upstairs. Let's go.

1839
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:16,240
好的 我们的计划是这样的
Mercedes:  Okay,  so here's the plan.

1840
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,380
我们要让所有的学生在春假里依赖上whyphy
We're gonna get all these kids at spring break hooked on whyphy.

1841
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,730
然后你把它带回你的地盘
Then you're gonna bring it back to your turf,

1842
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,310
你要把它全部卖光
and you're gonna sell the shit out of it.

1843
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,400
统统卖光 你们看到了吗
"Sell shit out of it." Do you see that?

1844
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:28,800
如果你们敢出卖我
And if you rat me out,

1845
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,600
我陷害过我的心理学教授 就因为他给我了B-评分
 I framed my psych prof just for giving me a b-minus.

1846
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,620
他现在进监狱了 所以 别惹我
He's in jail now, so don't fuck with me.

1847
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,380
我们要建立一个全国性质的网络
We're gonna build a nationwide network.

1848
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,880
 你干啥呢?   - 安静点
What the fuck are you doing?   - Be quiet.

1849
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,510
为什么你不买那些老式毒品
Why don't you sell those old classic drugs

1850
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,300
90年代的可卡因 海洛因 还有...
from the '90s, like cocaine, heroin and...

1851
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,920
爸 那些都是 老年人的毒品
Dad, those are, like, old-people drugs.

1852
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,670
感觉就像是老女人在像吸毒
That's, like, what they did on  the golden girls.

1853
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,720
就像是blanche在吸海洛因
Like, blanche did heroin.

1854
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,060
好吧 我还是坐在这 什么也不说好了
All right, I'll just sit here and be silent.

1855
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:54,610
Blanche从来没吸过海洛因
Blanche never did heroin.

1856
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,720
好了 杨氏兄弟 你来代替我那个死室友的位置
Okay, so, yangs, you'll take my dead roommate's spot.

1857
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:58,950
酷 很好
Cool. Dope.

1858
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,060
你在逗我吗 杨氏兄弟?  你是嗑嗨了吗?
Are you kidding me, yangs? Are you fucking high?

1859
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,870
当然   - 是的
- Of course.   - Yeah, I am.

1860
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,170
我的天 你难道没有听过
Jesus Christ, have you ever heard of,

1861
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:05,600
“贩毒不吸毒”这句话吗
"don't get high on your own supply"?

1862
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:06,740
我们没嗑要   - 没嗑
- We didn't.   - Nah.

1863
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:07,690
我没嗑
I didn't do that.

1864
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,090
我用了他的 他用了我的
Yeah, I used his and he used mine.

1865
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:12,420
好 现在我必须得从你们俩中间立一个规矩出来
Okay, well, now I have to make a fucking example out of you.

1866
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:13,740
是把枪
That's a gun. Yeah.

1867
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,030
谁先来?
Who first?

1868
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:17,640
你想先去吗?   - 我不想死
- You want to go first?   - I don't want to die.

1869
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,700
你去死...  -  我不想死
- You die...   - I don't want to die.

1870
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,220
你想石头剪刀布吗?   - 石头剪刀布?
- You want to do rock paper scissors?   - Rock paper scissors?

1871
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,020
就是这样   - 就这样
- That's how we'll do it.   - That's how we'll do it.

1872
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:22,560

1874
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:25,930
操
Fuck.

1875
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,650
好吧 我们无法决出胜负
Yeah, we won't figure this out.

1876
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,120
你们两个我一起杀   -宝贝
- I'll shoot both of you.   - Ghost: Darling.

1877
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,490
如果你想加入我们的家族生意
If you're going into the family business,

1878
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,190
你必须要有清白记录
you will have to have a clean record.

1879
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,960
这就是为什么我们有这些人来替我们做事
That's why we have these guys to do it for us.

1880
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:39,440
靠 厄运
Both: Oh, fuck. Jinx.

1881
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,640
我们得行动了
We got to move right now.

1882
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,760
给我在天堂买杯可乐
Both: Buy me a coke in heaven. Jinx again.

1883
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:45,200
放下枪   - 都放下枪
Put your guns down! Fucking guns down!

1884
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,380
Doug?

1885
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,270
我不叫Doug 我叫Schmit
My name's not Doug, it's schmidt.

1886
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,650
猜猜看 我们可是警察
And guess what, we're cops. Boom.

1887
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,440
真可怕
Oh, my God.

1888
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,090
是啊 每个人都知道   - 真的吗
- Yeah, everybody knows.    - Really?

1889
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:59,020
你们俩像是夏威夷老爸秀中的警察
You guys look like the stars of a cop show called  Hawaiian dads.

1890
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:01,620
好吧 够了够了 小的们 进来吧!
All right, enough is enough. Boys, move in!

1891
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,620
我们还有同伙吗   - 是啊!
- Oh, do we have company?   - Ghost: Yeah!

1892
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:06,510
放下你们的枪   - 你们先放下
- Drop your guns.   - Drop yours first.

1893
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,580
我们的枪比你们的多  给我把枪放下
We have way more guns than you. Drop your fucking guns.

1894
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,010
好吧 有道理
Okay, that's a good point.

1895
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,300
这就是你们的整个计划吗?
I mean, was this really your entire plan?

1896
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,070
没有任何支援就冲进来了?
Coming in here with no backup?

1897
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:19,000
也许我们有一个更加精心的计划
Or maybe we had a far more elaborate plan. Mmm-hmm.

1898
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:22,040
也许我的搭档兜里面放着一个跟踪器
Maybe my partner has a tracking device in his pocket right now.

1899
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:22,800
也许...什么?
May... what?

1900
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,260
你居然带了跟踪器?  我没有
You had the fucking tracking device. I don't have it.

1901
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:25,980
这应该是你记着的事
That's the one fucking thing you were supposed to remember.

1902
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:27,880
你是那个有脑子的人  你应该带着跟踪装置
Jenko: You're the smart person. You do the tracking device shit.

1903
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,440
那是你的事 我负责体力劳动方面的
That's your domain. I do the physical shit.

1904
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:31,720
你知道吗 我有时候是会拖累你
Schmidt: You know what, I may drag you down sometimes,

1905
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:34,760
但每一次 只有你要机会犯蠢
but every possible time you can do something dumb,

1906
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,500
你就会做出最蠢的事
you do the dumbest possible thing.

1907
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,190
不 最蠢的事
No, the fucking dumbest possible thing

1908
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:39,730
是让两个警察在这边说废话
is letting two cops blah-blah-blah

1909
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:42,000
同时其他的警察正在就位来捣毁他们
while other cops are getting in position to bust their shit in.

1910
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,160
所以你是说我带了跟踪装置
Oh, so you mean I brought the tracking device.

1911
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,570
对啊 怎么样 现在?
Yeah. What's up now, huh?

1912
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,570
看起来像是一场真的争吵
That seemed like such a real argument.

1913
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,770
即兴表演而已 小婊砸
That's improv, bitch.

1914
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,620
歇你妹的春假啊 傻叉
Spring break yourself, fool.

1915
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,210
我们能把你们打的七零八落
We shoot dicks off here in jump street.

1916
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,200
我们也来了
We're here, as well.

1917
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:06,400
我们龙虎局 马上就要踢你们的屁股
We jump street, and we about to jump in yo' ass.

1918
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:07,840
来得正好
Right in the crack.

1919
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,020
别轻举妄动  皮衣男
Don't do it, leatherface.

1920
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:17,280
他拿着毒品
Dickson: He's got the drugs!

1921
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,680
太无聊了 都没有人中枪
This is so boring. No one's getting shot.

1922
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:27,950
我的天
(Laughs) Oh, my God.

1923
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:31,680
你是中枪了吗 在我话音刚落的时候?
Did you just get shot, like, right after I fucking said that?

1924
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:35,280
我能用你的枪吗? 这把大一点
Can I have your gun? It's bigger.

1925
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,370
停下来!  我要开枪打你了!
Stop! I'll shoot you in the ass!

1926
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:39,220
老爸!
Dad!

1927
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:41,160
Maya?

1928
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:43,140
你来这干什么?
What are you doing here?

1929
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,790
这可是枪战现场
This is a shoot-out.

1930
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,400
你知道在枪战中会发生什么吗
You know what happens in a shoot-out.

1931
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,030
他们总是绑架一个女孩
They always kidnap the girl.

1932
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:49,330
也并不总是
Not always.

1933
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,330
Mercedes?你跟我来
Mercedes? You're coming with me.

1934
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,070
贱货 拜托 我哪也不去
Bitch, please. I ain't going nowhere with you.

1935
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:56,650
现在走
Now.

1936
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,310
爸 我该做什么？
Dad, what do I do?

1937
01:26:58,410 --> 01:26:59,380
那是我的泳装吗
Is that my bathing suit?

1938
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,540
只是问问 这是礼貌
Just ask. It's polite.

1939
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:06,940
你开枪打了我的脚
You shot me in my foot! Wait!

1940
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:08,590
走 快走 现在
Move! Move faster now!

1941
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,950
我在给你说话 见鬼 你朝我的脚开枪
I'm taking my time. Shit, you shot me in my goddamn foot.

1942
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,540
Doug? Doug!

1943
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:13,520
Maya!

1944
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,990
Mercedes带着我爸往那边走了
Mercedes just took my dad that way!

1945
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:15,960
好 我们去追
Okay, we're on it.

1946
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:21,000
要是我出意外  我就杀了你们俩混小子
Dickson: If I die, I'm gonna kill both of you motherfuckers!

1947
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,530
操 现在我们怎么去追赶他
Fuck. How are we gonna catch him now? (Engine revving)

1948
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:27,010
兰博基尼
Lambo.

1949
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,450
警察 警察    - 滚开

Shit, there's ghost!

1951

什么 我们要怎么办？
What? What do we do?

1952
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:37,630
我们要分开行动
Uh, we need to split up.

1953
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:39,120
你一个人行吗
Are you okay with that?

1954
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:41,120
对 我可以
Yeah, I can do it.

1955
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:42,380
你确定？
Are you sure?

1956
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,250
我要开车去追 因为你跑的快
I need to drive, 'cause you're faster on foot.

1957
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,610
什么?我不能开兰博基尼
What? I don't get to drive the lambo?

1958
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,020
你不能开 快走 出发吧
No, you don't. Come on, let's go!

1959
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:49,490
可是 我想 ...  -谁会在乎兰博基尼 快走吧
But I want... Who gives a shit about the lambo? Just go!

1960
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,590
快把钥匙给我  -我不能给你
Let go of the fucking keys! I can't let 'em go.

1961
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:51,210
你要要拿好它
You're gonna have to take 'em.

1962
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,970
好好使用她 这是荣耀 真的
Take care of her, okay? It'll be glorious, I promise.

1963
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,390
这车怎么开啊
How do you drive this thing?

1964
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,170
你要让她驾驶你 伙计
You got to let her drive you, bro.

1965
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:02,090
我进不去
Schmidt: I can't get in.

1966
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,810
你怎么开的车
Look where you're going!

1967
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:11,180
好混乱啊
It's so confusing!

1968
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,300
慢点 贱货我的手很疼
Easy, bitch. My hands are hurting.

1969
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:29,190
你知道后面追我们的是谁吗？
You know who's behind us in that car?

1970
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,620
那是我们队最好的车手
That's one of the best drivers that we got.

1971
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,100

01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,340
真他妈复杂 这是什么？
Schmidt: Fucking complicated. What is this?

1974
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:39,970
我了个大槽
Holy shit!

1975
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,740
你让我错失了开兰博基尼的机会 你个混蛋
You fucked up me driving a lamborghini, you dick!

1976
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:46,910
滚一边去 鸽子
Fuck you, doves!

1977
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,960
墨西哥港让我们听听你们的尖叫
Emcee:  Puerto, Mexico,  let's hear you get crazy!

1978
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,700
感觉就像是蝙蝠车
It's like a Batmobile.

1979
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:05,930

1998
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:06,120
把你皱纹的手从我身上拿开
Mercedes: Get your wrinkly hands off me!

1999
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:11,240

在到处找你
Looking for you.

2001
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:14,310

嘿 嘿

想像爷们一样对打吗？
Want to fight like a man?

2004
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:21,280
你最好能一对二
Then you better fight like two men.

2005

I'm not gonna fight a girl, so just stop!

2011
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,540
那不是问题
It shouldn't matter.

2012
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,540
要是你把我当成一个人 而不是女人
If you thought of me as a person instead of a woman,

2013
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,390
你打我就不会感觉不好了
you would hit me and not feel bad about it.

2014
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,190
好吧  -还手啊
Okay. Bring it!

01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:55,310
我眼睛有没有出血？   -哦 天啊 你没事吧？
Is there blood in my eye? Oh, my God. Are you all right?

2020
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:56,020
我觉得我眼睛出血了
I think there's blood in my eye.

2021
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,350
你他妈学着点
Fucking learn how to hit!

2022
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:01,840
这才像样！
That's a little better!

2023
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,790
这才好点 草泥马！再来 再来
That's a little better, motherfucker! Come on! Come on!

2024
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:09,860
不 不  - 干嘛？
No! No! What?

2025
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,790
你刚在干嘛？   -我在干嘛？
What were you doing? What am I doing?

2026
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,880
你为毛想要亲我？
Why'd you try to kiss me?

2027
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:14,360
我他妈才没想要亲你！
I didn't fucking try and kiss you!

2028
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,430
你就是   -哦 你太怪了
Yes, you did. Ooh, you're so weird!

2029
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,270
你他妈的要跟我上演史密斯夫妇
You're fucking Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing me.

2030
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,770
我才没要跟你演史密斯夫妇
'm not Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing you.

2031
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:20,890
刚刚才不是性战！
This wasn't a sexy fight.

2032
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,440
哦 就像你你从来没有想过要亲我一样
Oh, like you haven't wanted to kiss me the whole time.

2033
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,770
我从没想过一次要亲你！
I never once wanted to kiss you!

2034
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,320
从没有！没有
Never! No!

2035
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,740
你又那么做了   - 停 停
You just did it again! Stop it! Stop!

2036
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:30,390
你在做性感的鬼脸
You're making a face that is sexy!

2037
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,390
我从没有想要亲你
I don't even want to kiss you!

2038
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:33,690
那就不要想这去试
Then stop trying!

2039
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,930
你一直想试
You keep trying!

2040
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:36,520
我从没试着要亲你
I've never tried to kiss you.

2041
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,990
你给我了“亲我的眼神”
You gave me "kiss me" eyes.

2042
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:38,850
没 我没有
No, I didn't.

2043
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,940
那眼神是“我的脸上被揍了”的眼神
The eyes were "I just got punched in the face" eyes.

2044
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:41,710
不是“亲我”的眼神
They weren't "kiss me" eyes.

2045
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:43,190
我一点儿也不喜欢你
I don't even like you!

2046
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:45,260
我也不喜欢你 所以你不要亲我
Neither do I, so stop kissing me!

2047
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,090
好的
Okay!

2048
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:48,870
不  你又前倾了
No! You're leaning in again!

2049
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,630
我不知道我们是要打架还是亲吻
I didn't know if we were gonna punch or kiss!

2050
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,130
你搞得现在很不自在
You're making this so uncomfortable.

2051
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,580
这是我经历过最不自在的打架
This is the most uncomfortable fistfight I've ever been in.

2052
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:57,090
我要打你的脸把你打醒
‘I'm gonna give you an out by punching you in the face.

2053
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,040
好吗？   -好
Okay? Okay.

2054
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,430
然后我们重新回到打架阶段
And then we're gonna go back to fighting

2055
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:01,180
我们都假装刚才什么都发生过
and we'll pretend this never happened,

2056
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:02,650
因为我觉得这太尴尬了
'cause I feel so awkward.

2057
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,390
我想要看到你们疯狂
 I want to see you get crazy!

2058
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:53,230
我他妈的恨死春假了
I fucking hate spring break!

2059
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:56,750
操
Fuck!

2060
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:04,240
你开什么玩笑？那是塑料的
Are you kidding me? It's plastic.

2061
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:05,870
一点儿也不疼   -好...
Doesn't even hurt! Okay...

2062
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,580
这不是你想象的春假？
This isn't the spring break you imagined?

2063
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,370
这个怎么样？你要不要来点好玩的
How about this? You want a little fun?

2064
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:10,360
什么东西？
What is that?

2065
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:11,720
湿身吧 宝贝！
Get wet, baby!

2066
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,630
我脸上有好多润滑油！
So much lube in my face!

2067
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,470
脸上有油
Lube on my face.

2068
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,170
你太暴力了！
You're so violent!

2069
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,920
你要是不上我就给我滚下来
Get off me unless you're gonna fuck me!

2070
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:26,010
我才不要上你！
I'm not gonna fuck you!

2071
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,810
我们要上床么   -不 才不是
Are we gonna fuck?   -No we not

2072
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:28,750
这不就是正在发生么？
Is that what's happening?

2073
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,790
不！我才不想上你
No! I'm not gonna fuck you, ever!

2074
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,740
下来！
Get off!

2075
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:41,400
嘿！
Hey!

2076
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:43,580
嘿！
Hey!

2077
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:46,230
干啥？你要做啥子？
What? What are you gonna do?

2078
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,120
用你的手掐死我？
Choke me with your liver-spotted hands?

2079
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:49,920
还是走过来把我推下去？
You gonna push me over with your Walker?

2080
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,920
你能追上我很了不起
I'm impressed you caught up to me.

2081
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:53,220
你可能从来没有跑那么快过
You probably haven't run that fast

2082
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:54,810
自从你在操场上玩曲棍球以来
since you played stickball in the field

2083
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:56,590
在旧Wiggleby甜品店那里
behind old pop wiggleby's sweet shop.

2084
01:33:57,330 --> 01:33:59,260
不要动 贱货   -哦 谢天谢地
Freeze, bitch. Oh, thank God.

2085
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:01,500
看看谁从该死的皮带上解脱出来了
Look who got off the motherfucking leash.

2086
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:03,440
现在谁是困境中的少女？  -靠！
Now who's the damsel in distress? Schmidt: Fuck!

2087
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:04,460
我猜是他了
Well, I guess it's him.

2088
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:07,060
我可不是打的空心弹 Schmidt
i don't have a clean shot, schmidt.

2089
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:08,220
那就不要开枪！
Then don't take the shot!

2090
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,640
可能我会开下流枪
Maybe I want to take a dirty shot.

2091
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:12,120
就是你对我女儿开的那种下流枪
Kind of like the dirty shot you took on my daughter.

2092
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,180
我没有对你女儿耍流氓 好吗？
I didn't take a dirty shot on your daughter, okay?

2093
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,770
我们谈了很多 我们互相关心
We talked a lot, and we care about each other.

2094
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,950
你身上所有的优点
All the good qualities you have,

2095
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,170
我在Maya身上都感受到了
I can feel inside of Maya.

2096
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:23,120
我要开枪了
I'm gonna take the shot.

2097
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,820
不要开枪
Don't take the shot.

2098
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,250
我开枪越过你的肩膀
I can shoot right through your shoulder,

2099
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:27,740
正中这个贱货的胸部
hit the bitch right in the chest.

2100
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,450
不要开枪   -我就是要开枪
Don't take the shot. I'm taking the shot.

2101
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:30,510
我他妈的会开枪的
I'll take the fucking shot.

2102
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:32,210
在我开枪之前谁都不准开枪
Nobody take the shot before me.

2103
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:34,310
不如我们同时开枪？   -谁也不能开枪
Mercedes: How about we take it at the same time? No one take a shot.

2104
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:35,320
等 等 等 等
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2105
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:41,240
靠！你有权利保持沉默...
Shit! You have the right to remain silent...

2106
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,320
不 不 不 我来处理这个
Dickson: No, no, no, I got this.

2107
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:44,150
你去抓鬼见愁  他在楼顶
You go handle the ghost. He's on the roof.

2108
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,340
我马上去   -交给我了
I'm on it. I got it.

2109
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:46,260
你在看什么？
Dickson: What you looking at?

2110
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,210
手铐铐的不错 宝贝女儿
Good job on the cuffs, baby girl.

2111
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:58,990
他妈的这么多级台阶
So many fucking stairs.

2112
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:06,330
是我 是我   -靠
It's me! It's me! Shit.

2113
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:08,800
你做到了 伙计 你抓到Mercedes？
(Chuckles) You made it, dude. Did you get Mercedes?

2114
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:10,450
是啊 完全靠我一个人
Yeah. All by myself.

2115
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,260
真的？
Really?

2116
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,970
主要是靠我   -好的
Mainly by myself. Okay.

2117
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,680
还有伙计 你说的很对 那个兰博基尼...
And, dude, you were right, that lambo...

2118
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,220
我现在不想提那个
Just can't hear that right now.

2119
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,630
那车很逊 一点儿不好
It's a shitty-made car. It's not good.

2120
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:20,700
嘿 我们走吧 我们该走了
Hey, let's go. We got to go.

2121
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:21,610
你还剩多少子弹？
How many bullets you got left?

2122
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:23,850
一个也没了
None

2123
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,470
那就表现的像你有一样
Act like you have bullets, then.

2124
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:38,010
我们该走了
We gotta go!

2125
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:40,070
我们得等我女儿
We have to wait for pudding!

2126
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:49,570
Jenko！

2127
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,970
快走 快走！
Go, go!

2128
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:06,800
给你 拿着这个    -好的
Here, take this. Okay.

2129
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,390
我是想给你挡个子弹的 伙计
I tried to take a bullet for you, man.

2130
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:09,420
但是你没挡住
Yeah. But you didn't.

2131
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:10,960
但是我试了 重要的是想法
But I tried. It's the thought that matters.

2132
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:12,960
不是 重要的不是想法
No, it's not the thought that counts.

2133
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:14,210
是要挡住子弹
It's fucking taking the bullet.

2134
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,770
掩护我 我要跑远一点
Cover me. I'm gonna go long.

2135
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:20,970
好的
Okay.

2136
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:48,430
拜 拜 终结者！
Bye-bye, Terminator!

2137
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:04,040
嘿！从我直升机上滚下去
Hey! Get off of my chopper!

2138
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:06,080
你能把他晃下来么？
Can you shake him off?

2139
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,080
我来抓你了 草泥马！
I'm coming for you, motherfucker!

2140
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,490
快点 把驾驶杆前后摆动
Ghost: Come on, just wiggle the stick back and forth!

2141
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:13,420
他就一只手在飞机上了
He's only got one arm!

2142
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:15,590
我用一只胳膊就能打你的老二
I only need one arm to punch you in the dick.

2143
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,310
把他晃下来！晃下来！
Shake him off! Shake him off!

2144
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:20,430
别像个娘儿们！
Don't be a pussy!

2145
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,830
我嘞个草
Holy shit!

2146
01:37:54,190 --> 01:37:55,550
我做到了
Schmidt: I did it!

2147
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,570
我他妈看起来就像个坏蛋！
I look so fucking badass!

2148
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,060
哦 天啊  你飞起来了
Oh, my God, you flew!

2149
01:37:59,100 --> 01:37:59,830
太疯狂了
This is crazy!

2150
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:01,120
你飞跃了 伙计
You made the leap, man!

2151
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:02,240
你为啥要这么做？
Why'd you do that?

2152
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:03,650
因为你这么做了

我刚刚意识到

2160
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:35,600
你没有拖我后腿 伙计
You don't hold me down, man.

2161
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:36,970
你提升了我
You lift me up.

2162
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,470
从里到外都是

But a flower, it can't grow in a fist.

我说：来点酷的

2210
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:57,890
