- [James] <i>Did</i> you <i>see</i> her?
- [Lisa] What do you <i>mean?</i> I--

8
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,787
<i>[James] I missed it the first time, too.
Hang on.</i>

00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,743
[tape rewinding]

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,554
[Lisa] Okay. What is that?

11
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,183
Lisa, I think that might be my sister.

12
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,218
[Lisa] Wait, wait, okay. Uh...

13
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,725
How did you even find it?

14
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,397
Did you have, like, a search alert set up?

15
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,566
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
And usually, it's nothing.

16
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,143
But the guy who uploaded this video

17
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,025
said it was from a tape he found
in the Black Hills Woods.

18
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,606
But those woods
have been searched, right?

19
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,157
- They never found the house.
- Mmm-hmm.

20
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,075
Yeah, but the Black Hills Forest is huge.

21
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,529
So maybe they weren't looking
in the right place, you know?

22
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,614
That's why I want us to start
where the tape was found.

23
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,074
- So we can set up camp at night--
- Lisa.

24
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,000
- [Lisa] Hi.
<i>'</i> [James] Hey

25
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,334
What are you guys doing?

26
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,038
We're doing Lisa's
documentary class project, starring me.

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,544
[Peter] Boring! [chuckles]

28
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,801
[Lisa] Okay, so try on
that earpiece camera.

29
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,890
Wh-- which is...

30
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,346
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

31
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,147
And then press the button on the side.

32
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,271
- [James] Okay.
- [Lisa] And then it should be recording.

33
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,321
The cool thing about these
is they've got built-in GPS.

34
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,650
- [James] Huh?
- [Lisa chuckles]

35
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,324
How's that? [laughs]

36
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,201
You're getting more of these
for Peter and Ashley, right?

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,124
Yeah. We just have to make sure
we remember to switch out the cards.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,326
[James] Okay.

39
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,917
Temp narration take one--

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,502
Take two-- Three.

41
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,472
When James was four years old,

42
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,050
his older sister disappeared
while making a documentary

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,018
near the town of Burkittsville, Maryland.

44
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,478
<i>Some of the footage
shot by James' sister was later found.</i>

45
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,653
<i>The final moments of it showed
her going into a house,</i>

46
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,779
<i>seemingly within the Black Hills Forest.</i>

[dogs barking]

49
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,039
<i>That area was extensively searched
by police and FBI,</i>

50
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,499
<i>but they could find no evidence</i>

51
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,254
<i>of an existing house in those woods.</i>

52
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,387
<i>Investigators concluded that James' sister
might have vanished elsewhere,</i>

53
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,807
<i>despite her crew's equipment and footage
being found nearby.</i>

54
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,728
<i>For as long as I've been friends
with James,</i>

55
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,273
<i>he's wondered what happened to her.</i>

56
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,521

59
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,738
<i>How long have you and James
been friends?</i>

60
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,822
<i>[Peter] Our parents were friends,</i>

61
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,782
so I guess we grew up together.

62
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,627
[Lisa] So you knew him
when his sister disappeared?

63
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,620
Yeah.

64
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,958
I don't really remember Heather
all that well, to be honest.

65
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,630
But after she went off into those woods
and she didn't come back...

66
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,340
Yeah. I remember all that.

67
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:20,969
[Peter] Okay, I'm trying to prove a point.

68
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,929
That's why you're about to die.

69
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,014
[James] Found one.

70
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,519
That's me. You're shooting me.

71
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,442
- [Lisa] Peter...
- [both laughing]

72
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,817
[Lisa] Can you give us an idea
of what we're going to be doing out there?

73
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,739
Four of us, we're gonna go out there

74
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,067
and we're gonna try to find this house.

75
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,245
James, he's been messaging with the guy
who uploaded that video.

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,244
He's gonna show us exactly where
in the woods he found the DV tape.

77
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,371
[Lisa] And James, you think
you're gonna find the house?

78
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,077
Um, maybe. I hope so.

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,377
[Lisa] So you really think your sister

80
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,046
could still be out there
after all these years?

81
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,964
All I know is...

82
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,759
if there is any chance at all

83
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,586
that I could find out
what happened to her,

84
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,296
I need to at least try.

85
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,094
[Lisa] And what about the legends?

86
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,220
IILegendSllf-P

87
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,343
[Lisa] Yeah, do you believe, at all,

88
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,394
in the stories about the Blair Witch?

89
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,856
[pop music playing]

90
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,156
[Peter] Hey, Lisa, I can't tell,
is this thing recording or not?

91
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,279
[Lisa] Yeah, it should be.

92
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,157
Did you-- did you press and hold
the button when you did it?

93
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,237
Yeah.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,367
[Ashley] These things are so small.

95
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,618
Like, where do you put it?

96
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,290
Okay. Recording. We are recording.

97
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,245
[Lisa] Just, uh, make sure
it's always facing forward.

98
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,579
And make sure
you press the button down.

99
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,289
- Did you hold it down?
- Okay, got it, got it, got it.

100
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,669
- Yeah, I got it.
- Did you hold it down?

101
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,216
Hold it down, hold it down, hold it down.

102
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,801
- Hey, Peter!
- Yeah?

103
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,968
How do I look?

104
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,045
Yeah, that's sexy.

105
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,129
[Ashley laughs]

106
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,214
[music continues]

107
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,059
The thing is, he's going back out
to those woods

108
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,136
to look for his sister, Lisa.

109
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,767
'Cause he thinks she could still be there

110
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,896
'cause of some blurry footage
that some weirdo put online.

111
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,318
So, like, how's that gonna look?

112
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,646
I don't wanna exploit anyone.
That's not the point.

113
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,945
All right, then don't tell anyone
about it. Okay?

114
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,648
How 'bout that? Use that.
There's an option.

115
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,904
Don't tell anyone.
Just come out there with us.

116
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,657
Film it like he wants you to,
<i>as</i> his friend.

117
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,578
Don't use the footage for your movie.

118
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,454
- I can't promise that. No, I can't.
- Right.

119
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,377
- I know. I know you can't.
- I can't promise that, Peter,

120
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,625
because like what if something
actually happens out there?

121
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,332
I see you, Lisa.
Yeah, right, okay, I'ma get a beer.

122
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,588
What if we find something
that they never found?

123
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,714
I'm so sorry.

124
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,261
He and James
have just been friends forever.

125
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,675
Just because I haven't been friends
with him

126
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,347
for as long as you guys
doesn't mean I don't care.

127
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,767
I know that!
You don't have to explain yourself to me.

128
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,226
Ah, fuck me, man.

129
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,353
[Ashley] How are you feeling?

130
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,355
You're asking if I regret getting drunk

131
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,187
the night before going camping
in the woods?

132
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,487
I do not.

133
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,735
[laughs]

134
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,449
Okay. Let's just move back a little bit.

135
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,574
How far does it go?

136
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,210
Like, 100 meters is the max, I think.

137
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,003
[motor whirring]

138
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,969
[Lisa] Ashley and I have used these
in class before.

139
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,096
Just like cheap helicopter shots,
you know.

140
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,894
It could be useful in terms
of finding our way around the forest.

141
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,721
[Ashley] Yeah,
but we're gonna have a GPS though, right?

142
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,805
[Lisa] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,015
It's built into the earpiece camera,

144
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,725
but it only works when it's on, though.

145
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,529
So just keep an eye on the battery
in case we get separated.

146
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,776
<i>[James on radio] Com check, over.</i>

147
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,073
"Com check"?

148
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,294
<i>Yeah, that's like,
what people say in the military, over.</i>

149
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,756
Okay, anyways, it's working.

150
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,251
Over.

151
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,382
- <i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>
- <i>[laughs]</i>

152
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,756
- Hey, the walkie-talkies work.
- [Peter] Yeah, we know.

153
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,519
[Ashley] He's got the bass in his voice.

154
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,684
- [James] Somebody wasn't hydrated.
- [Ashley giggles]

155
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,477
[Lisa] Whoa...

156
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,528
- [Peter] Boom, we're safe.
- Okay, which one is you guys'?

157
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,950
- We're this one.
- [Peter] Oh, this is ours.

158
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,073
- [Peter] Okay!
- [Ashley laughs] Whoa!

159
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,076
- [James growls over radio]
- [laughing]

160
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,749
[walkie-talkie feedback]

161
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,624
- Lay with us.
- Oh, no.

162
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,672
- [Peter] We got room.
- James! James! James!

163
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,294
[mumbling]

164
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,009
Good night, folks.

165
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,136
Oh, yeah.

166
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,973
- [Peter] I don't know...
- [Lisa] He has been a little...

167
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,721
[Ashley] Who you bragging to?

168
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,428
[Lisa] And this used to be called Blair?

169
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,763
[James] Sort of.

170
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,271
There was a town called Blair
back in the 1700s,

171
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,477
but it was discovered abandoned.

172
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,734
So they founded a new town,
called it Burkittsville.

173
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,027
[Peter] I think so?

174
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,408
[Ashley] My god.

175
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,580
[dogs barking]

176
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,590
[Lane] They're here!

177
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,137
- Hey! Hey, come in.
- [James] Hey.

178
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,723
- [James] Hope they fixed...
- Hey.

179
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,638
[Lisa] Hi.

180
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,679
[Talia] Can I get anybody, like,
water or anything to drink?

181
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,890
- Water or...
- I'm okay. Thank you.

182
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,973
I'll take some water.

183
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,355
-[Lane] Feel free to make yourself
at home. Just through there.

184
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,029
Yeah, have a seat in there
and, uh, Lane'll be right with you.

185
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,524
[Lane] Hey, I'm glad
you're all recording this.

186
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,575
Not every day we get
like-minded investigators

187
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,776
coming out here to discuss
the Blair Witch.

188
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,861
There you go.

189
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,868
[camera beeps]
[Lisa] Hey, I may need to get you guys

190
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,324
to sign some release forms
later if that's...

191
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,329
Yeah, sure, that's cool.

192
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,751
I'll probably need you to sign one, too.

193
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,796
So, you're Darknet666?

194
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,128
[Lane] Yeah. Well, we both are,
but, uh, you can call me Lane.

195
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,214
[Lane] Yeah. Well, we both are,
but, uh, you can call me Lane.

196
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,175
[Lane] Yeah. Well, we both are,
but, uh, you can call me Lane.

197
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
- This is-- this is Talia.
- Hi.

198
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,882
So... Okay, well, first off,

199
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,592
I was hoping you could show us
where you found the tape.

200
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,268
We're gonna make that
our starting point.

201
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,642
Are you guys really gonna go camping
out in those woods?

202
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,769
[Peter] Yep. That's the plan. Why?

203
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,064
[whispers] You ask 'em.

204
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,362
Uh, we wanna go out there with you.

205
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,739
I mean, if you're gonna be looking around,

206
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,533
we wanna be a part of that.

207
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,363
It's not, you know...
We're not gonna be a burden or anything.

208
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,742
- We go camping all the time.
- [Talia] Mmm-hmm.

209
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,205
Hey, look, that's the deal if you want us
to show you where we found it.

210
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,632
Is it okay if we talk it over in private,
real quick?

211
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,169
[Lane] No, yeah, oh, yeah,
yeah, sure, go ahead.

212
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,144
- What do you think?
- [Peter] Nope.

213
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,939
[Lisa] Well, don't we need them to show us
exactly where they found the tape?

214
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,233
- [James] Yeah.
- Yeah, but I didn't think they'd want

215
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,981
to stick around after that.

216
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,235
Well, they didn't exactly make it sound
like we have an option.

217
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,415
[sighs]

218
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,334
[James] What are you bragging about?

219
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,714
[Peter] No, I-- I'm serious.

220
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,420
[Ashley] You say that to people?

221
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,474
[heavy metal playing over stereo]

222
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,389
[Peter] Look at this guy.
You crack me up.

223
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,932
[music continues]

224
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,695
[Peter] We made it.

225
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,200
[exhales]

226
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,405
Yeah. All right. Lisa. Got you.

227
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,414
Baby, what the hell
do you have in here?

228
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,832
[grunts]

229
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,876
[giggles] It's heavy.

230
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,749
Lisa.

231
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,716
And Ash, I'm gonna give you the headlamp.
[grunts] Okay.

232
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,667
[Peter] Hey,
it's cool if we leave our cars here?

233
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,594
Yeah, it's fine. They're safe.

234
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,429
No one comes out this way.

235
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,264
[James] I'm already hungry.

236
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,063
[Peter] Yeah, I'm thinkin' I could eat.

237
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,811
[James] Could eat all these
granola bars in the backpack.

238
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,062
[Peter chuckles]

239
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,113
[Peter] Hey, what do you think
they're smoking up there?

240
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,781
[Ashley] Mmm, definitely bath salts.

241
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,403
[both laugh]

242
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,823
You know what? I'm gonna go ask.

243
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,994
[Ashley] Peter, wait! No!

244
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,118
Hey, yo, Darknet666, wait up!

245
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,119
I saw some of your other videos.

246
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,583
Yeah?

247
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,081
Yeah. Before we came out here.

248
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,412
Saw this one, it was really interesting

249
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,668
where you guys, like,
found this little pile of rocks.

250
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,794
[laughs]

251
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,629
[Whispers] Would you stop?

252
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,923
Symbols.

253
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,379
"Symbols"? Oh, they were symbols.

254
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,930
No, no, no, seriously.

255
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,217
So, do you guys really believe
all these old stories?

256
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,729
I mean, 'cause someone's died everywhere,
at some point, right?

257
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,149
Doesn't mean that every square foot
of this planet is haunted.

258
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,271
Did you grow up here?

259
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,944
- [Peter] No.
- See, I-- I did.

260
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,822
Talia did. We both-- we both grew up here.

261
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,233
And the older folks in town

262
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,410
used to talk a lot
about these woods when I was little.

263
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:04,164
And after... his sister and her crew
went missing and their stuff got found,

264
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,329
suddenly, everyone I know
just wanted to forget it.

265
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,464
This area has a history
of things happening

266
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,134
that no one really likes to talk about.

267
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,008
Rustin Parr. Coffin Rock.

268
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,930
List goes on and on.

269
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,386
Hmm.

270
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,220
[indistinct conversation]

271
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,270
- [Lane] Watch yourself. Watch your step!
- Yeah. It goes down here.

272
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,066
[Talia] Back in the 1940s,
Rustin Parr brought eight kids

273
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,277
out to his house in these woods.

274
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,077
Killed seven of 'em.

275
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,200
But Parr claimed

276
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,952
<i>that he heard the voice
of an old woman</i>

277
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,874
<i>telling him to kill the children.</i>

278
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,451
<i>He would take them up to his attic</i>

279
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,127
<i>and make one stand in a corner</i>

280
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,045
while he killed the other one.

281
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,958
[Lane] There's been some debate
on that actually, where

282
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,464
whether it was the attic or the basement.

283
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,387
So he thought he heard the Blair Witch
telling him to kill people?

284
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,223
Well, he never said who it was.

285
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,550
He just said that it sounded

286
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,600
like this voice of an old woman.

287
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,350
They hanged him out
in these woods, near his house.

288
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,102
[Lisa] So wait, he had a house out here?

289
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,058
Yeah. That's not the one
we're looking for though.

290
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,235
Pan's house was burnt down
after he was hanged.

291
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,942
Supposedly they found a bunch of old
tunnels and stuff underneath

292
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,113
that didn't go anywhere.

293
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,783
Some kind of underground rail road thing,
I think.

294
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,200
[indistinct conversation]

295
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,585
[Peter] Oh, my back.

296
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,470
[buzzing]

297
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,430
[camera beeps]

298
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,182
[Lane] Okay, so this is, uh,

299
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,109
this is technically where
the Black Hills Woods start.

300
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,279
Back from when this was private land.

301
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,865
[Ashley] Uh, well, who owns it now?

302
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,568
No one. It's the state's, I guess.

303
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,621
[Ashley] So, we're not trespassing
or anything, right?

304
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,957
No. No one cares. No one living, that is.

305
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,828
[Peter laughs]

306
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,665

[indistinct]

308
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,972
If we have to go camping with the locals,

309
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,594
could you please not piss them off?

310
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,301
Baby, I di-- I didn't say anything.

311
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,887
You don't have to say anything,
Peter, you know that.

312
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,971
[laughing]

313
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,647
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,769
Sorry.

315
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,442
[Lisa] Okay, Goofy.

316
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,820
[camera beeps]
[Lane] The glare on the plastic...

317
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,534
[James] You just, you we-- you were
walking by and you saw it?

318
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,371
[Lane] This is where we found the DV tape.

319
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,448
[Peter] And there was nothing else
on the tape?

320
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,999
[Lane] No. Like I said, it was all static

321
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,826
except for that bit that we uploaded.

322
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,294
[Ashley] Why does the tree look like that?

323
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,872
[Talia] Lightning.
Sometimes when it hits the tree,

324
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,003
the electricity goes into the ground

325
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,176
and it burns the tree from the roots up.

326
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,504
- [James] Was it just underneath here?
- [Lane] Yeah.

327
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,973
It was like half under and half out,
but we had to dig a little.

328
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,142
...wasn't your fault.

329
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,561
I just couldn't help laughing at you.

330
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,073
[Talia] A girl drowned in this creek.

331
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,278
It was around when Burkittsville
was founded.

332
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,533
Her family was doing the washing
and her mother said

333
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,038
she saw a hand reach out of the water
and pull her daughter in.

334
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,911
Probably the only reason
we still know about it is

335
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,291
'cause there were newspaper articles,

336
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,247
'cause the girl's body was never found.

337
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,386
Are we crossing this?

338
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,139
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

339
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,267
- [Lane] Yeah, let us know how it is.
- [James] Ooh, it's freezing.

340
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,643
I'm walking across the water.

341
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,723
[James] That's great.

342
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,649
- Oh! [laughing]
- [James] Oh! That's cold.

343
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,727
[Ashley] Leeches are fine?
What do you mean?

344
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,608
[Lane] Wait, wait, you said
there was leeches?

345
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,234
[Ashley] No, I'm just asking.

346
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,982
Are you coming?

347
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,613
[Lisa] Did you get a pedicure
before you came here?

348
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,909
[laughing] Ye$_

349
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,123
- Ah! [fake cries]
- I know, I know.

350
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,001
You sure this is a good idea?

351
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,626
[Lane] Uh, will you hold the camera for me
for just one second?

352
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,047
My shoes...

353
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,961
- All right. Oh, oh!
- [Ashley] Careful there.

354
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,216
Ah! That's cold!

355
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,512
Wait, I got it, I got it.

356
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,135
You got it? All right.

357
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,432
[Peter] Careful.

358
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,351
- You all right?
- [Lane] Oh...

359
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,196
[Ashley screams]

360
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,273
[James] Ashley!

361
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,529
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, okay.

362
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,860
[sobs] I cut my foot on a rock

363
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,116
- or a piece of broken glass or something.
- [James] You'll be all right.

364
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,788
[Peter] Okay, there we go. We gotcha.

365
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,365
- You okay?
- Yeah.

366
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,075
[Peter] You're all right,
you're all right.

367
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,956
[James] Careful, careful, careful.

368
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,297
Okay. Let's see that foot.

369
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,045
Okay. Ah, you're all right.

370
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,380
[James] You're all right.
You're all right.

371
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,885
Is it bad? It just feels
like it's really deep and it hurts.

372
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,468
[James] No, it's not bad at all.
I just gotta clean it.

373
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,019
Lisa, do you mind gettin'
my first-aid kit?

374
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,346
- It's in my bag over there.
- Huh?

375
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,228
- Lisa. First-aid kit. Bag. Please.
- Oh, shit!

376
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,934
- Sorry. Yeah. Sorry.
- Thank you very much.

377
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,066
- Lane! Jesus! Manners, dude.
- Hey! Hey! Back up! Back up!

378
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,897
I'll get this shot really quick
and then I'll be good.

379
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,732
- [Peter] Get back over there.
- Just like one more second?

380
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,067
- [Peter] I swear...
- [Lane] All right, all right.

381
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,447
[James] All right,
I've seen much worse than this.

382
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,903
- There you go. Oh, oh, it's okay.
- [wincing]

383
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,080
- Try not to move it too much.
- Feels like it's really big.

384
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,999
No, it feels a lot worse
than it actually is. I promise.

385
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,619
- Pressure. It's okay. It's all right.
- Ah!

386
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,251
Now we just gotta wrap it up
and you'll be good to walk on it.

387
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,752
Gotta bring it around.

388
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:45,921
[Peter] Thank you, James.

389
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,126
[James] No problem, man.

390
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,803
Okay. You wanna try standing up?

391
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,004
<i>'</i> [Ashley] Yeah.
- Okay.

392
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,847
All right,
don't put too much pressure on it.

393
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,924
[Peter] Ready? One, two, three.

394
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,386
- There you go. You all right?
- Yeah.

395
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,187
- Not so bad.
- Not so bad.

396
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,189
- Oh. Ow.
- You okay?

397
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,198
[Peter] Come to my palace in the woods.

398
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,037
[Peter laughs]

399
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,622
This is how we roll.

400
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,869
In style without--

401
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,747
[Ashley] No, that's what I'm trying
to say is, um...

402
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,123
Is it-- fuck.

403
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,080
- [Ashley] Babe, Babe, it's bent.
- Babe, I got it, I got!

404
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,882
Please, let me just put the tent together.
Okay?

405
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,049
I'm just saying that the pole is--

406
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,464
I just need to put
the tent together right now.

407
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,137
It's not supposed to be bent,
I know. So you just bend--

408
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,886
This-- is this supposed to be bent?

409
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,058
This is not the entrance.

410
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,223
[Ashley] That's not.
Well, that's not either.

411
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,187
Fuck!

412
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,352
Fuck!

413
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,433
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

414
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,235
Fuck you! Fuck you, tent!

415
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,863
[rhythmic beeping]

416
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,242
Okay. Everything's good.

417
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,992
[Peter] Hey, I'm gonna go
get some firewood

418
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,077
before it gets totally dark, okay?

419
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,170
Looks like the sun's
coming down pretty quick.

420
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,465
[James] Well, hold up.
Let's finish this and I'll come with you.

421
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,338
[chuckles] No, man,
I'm not goin' too far, okay?

422
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,506
I'll keep my camera on.

423
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,428
You can see me on the GPS, all right?

424
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,505
[James] Okay.

425
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,340
Well, take a walkie-talkie
with you, please.

426
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,143
[Peter] Man. Brother, already got one.
[walkie-talkie beeps]

427
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,595
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

428
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,898
[drone whirring]

429
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,678
<i>[Ashley] What exactly
should we be looking for?</i>

430
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,310
<i>[James] We're looking for the house
from Heather's footage.</i>

431
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,937
<i>Do you see the" do you see any clearings?
Anything like that?</i>

432
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,235
<i>[Ashley] I shouldn't take
this thing too much further up,</i>

433
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,312
but, I mean, I don't see anything yet.

434
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,700
[Peter snickers]

435
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,153
[indistinct conversations]

436
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,659
[James] Yeah. That was a good movie.

437
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,670
[Ashley groans]

438
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,507
[James] I'm unsettled, immediately.

439
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,543
[Peter] All right.

440
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,466
Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,762
- [Lisa] Ew! Ew!
- [James] I'm uncomfortable with this.

442
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,839
What?

443
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,391
[Lisa] Why do you have
to eat it like that?

444
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,309
- I didn't mean to.
- [James] Eat it a little bit quicker.

445
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,681
You don't have to go all slow like that.

446
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,933
Oh, god!

447
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,814
[Ashley] It really,
really did scar me for life.

448
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,021
I don't want to ever fish again.

449
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,319
[indistinct conversations]

450
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,837
Okay, so the Blair Witch.

451
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,539
Who is she really?

452
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,924
[Talia] Elly Kedward.

453
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,679
That's what most people say.

454
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,677
[clears throat]

455
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,258
She was accused of witchcraft

456
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,968
after some of the children
in town said that

457
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,974
she'd taken blood from them.

458
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,523
There wasn't much
of a trial system back then.

459
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,518
Townspeople took her out
to these woods,

460
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,571
tied her to a tree and
left her to die of exposure.

461
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,233
In the spring they went back
to look for her body

462
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,076
but there was no trace of it.

463
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,906
They assumed she was eaten
by animals or something, but...

464
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,868
then people in the town
started disappearing.

465
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,251
First the children who'd accused her,
and their families.

466
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,714
Then others.

467
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,005
Eventually, everyone who was left

468
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,008
just abandoned their homes, fled the town.

469
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,259
[Lane] Well...

470
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,094
What?

471
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,174
[laughs]

472
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,431
- What?
- Well, I was just gonna add...

473
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,979
According to this book I read,
published in 1809,

474
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,898
they didn't just tie
Elly Kedward to a tree.

475
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,442
I mean, they did tie her to a tree,

476
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,689
but they tied her up really high

477
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,896
and they strung these heavy rocks
to her arms and legs

478
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,026
as weights, stretching her.

479
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,231
Ugh.

480
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,363
They left her to die on a makeshift rack.

481
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,989
Okay. Thanks.

482
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,576
[Lane] Ever since,
there's been a curse on these woods.

483
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,704
The legend says if you look
directly at the witch

484
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,785
you'll die just from the fright of it.

485
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,797
That's why Rustin Parr
stood in that corner.

486
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,334
They say no one's ever seen her
and lived to talk about it.

487
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,591
[Peter] Or, alternately,
no one has ever seen her, period.

488
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,848
This is all just stories, okay?

489
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,767
I've been to these woods before.

490
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,017
When I was a kid
with about 100 other people.

491
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,439
[Talia] You were part
of those search teams?

492
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,725
I remember that.

493
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,483
Yeah.

494
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,777
So how come I'm okay?

495
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,067
Nothing got me then.

496
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,528
[Lane] Maybe it did.

497
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,825
You're back, right?

498
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,201
All right, real theory, real theory.

499
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,877
One that I've read online.

500
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,414
Whatever spell the witch
put on these woods,

501
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,046
you have to be out here
at night for it to get you.

502
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,880
You have to spend the night.

503
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,338
Wait, well, then how come
you're still alive?

504
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,466
That's a good point.

505
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,264
Maybe she's using us
to lure you all out here.

506
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,266
[Ashley] Okay, on that note,
I'm going to bed.

507
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,767
- [Peter] Yeah, me, too.
- [James] We should get some rest.

508
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,314
We got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow.

509
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,267
- 'Night, dudes.
- [Peter] Yeah, good night, man.

510
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,193
[indistinct chatter]

511
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,945
[Lisa] Good night, James.

512
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,025
[James] 'Night.

513
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,195
[zipper closing]

514
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,090
[camera beeps]

515
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,094
[James breathing heavily]

516
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,009
[James whispers] I just heard something
moving outside.

517
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,442
[branches breaking]

518
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,739
Oh, my... [mumbles]

519
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,539
[branches continue breaking]

520
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,096
[loud rumble]

521
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,142
Shit.

522
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,061
Shit!

523
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,560
[wolves howling]
[James panting]

524
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,154
What the fuck'?

525
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,123
Hey, Lisa.

526
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,286
[both gasping]

527
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,874
[James] Lisa?
What the hell are you doing?

528
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,421
- Did you hear that out there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard it.

529
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,374
There's something out there,
out in the woods, like a bear.

530
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,800
[shushes]

531
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,924
Okay, here.

532
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,676
Thanks.

533
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,557
[loud radio static]
[screams]

534
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,854
What the fuck was that?

535
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,523
It's okay. It's just my walkie-talkie.

536
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,191
- It's all right, that's all right.
- [Lisa] Shit!

537
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,314
Peter, is that you? Com check.

538
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,569
<i>[Peter on radio] James,
what the hell was that?</i>

539
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,865
[Lisa] Oh, fuck.

540
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,864
[James] I don't know, man,
I don't know.

541
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,619
<i>Are you okay?</i>

542
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,492
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're okay, we're okay.

543
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,956
Lisa's here too, we're okay.

544
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,908
I mean, she just came, like,
just now came into my tent.

545
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,083
[Lisa] Like 30 seconds ago.

546
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,753
- [Talia] Hey, is everyone okay out there?
- [indistinct radio chatter]

547
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,169
[Peter] Yeah, we're fine. You two good?

548
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,251
[Talia] No. Lane's not here.

549
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,460
[James] Where is he?

550
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,046
[Talia] Well, he went--
he went off to pee,

551
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,552
but he always goes far off for privacy.

552
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,008
[James] Oh, god.

553
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,727
Hey, Lane!

554
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,143
Lane!

555
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,067
Lane!

556
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,445
[sighing] Oh, god damn it.

557
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,276
We should probably go look for him, right?
Make sure he's okay?

558
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,406
- [Peter] No.
- [Ashley] No.

559
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,577
[Peter] No, I'm not goin' out there.

560
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,779
[Ashley] That is definitely
not a good idea.

561
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,116
[Talia] Well, I'm gonna go.
He's been gone for a while.

562
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,950
[James] Okay. I'll come with you.

563
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,125
Um...

564
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,914
- Shit, he might be lost, okay?
- Um...

565
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:45,998
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

566
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,459
I guess I should probably go back
to my tent.

567
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,386
- I mean, you can stay here if you want.
- Okay.

568
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,963
- Yeah?
- Okay.

569
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,548
All right. I'll be back soon.

570
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,304
All right.
[zipper closes]

571
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,769
[Peter] Hey, good luck, man.

572
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,901
- Careful. There.
- Thanks.

573
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,027
[camera beeps]

574
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:16,828
[shouting] Lane!

575
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,918
[Tafia] Lane!

576
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,255
Lane!

577
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,264
[James] God, where is he?

578
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,593
Lane!

579
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,517
[Tafia] Lane!

580
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,274
Lane!

581
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,367
Did you see that tree that fell?

582
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,452
Sounded like it landed nearby.

583
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,465
Yeah, but sounds can travel
pretty far out here.

584
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,293
- Did you guys hear that?
- [Talia and James scream]

585
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,549
[James] Lane!

586
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,720
Lane, what the fuck, man?

587
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:16,797
I'm sorry, man.

588
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,219
Tell me you recorded those sounds.

589
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,390
Did you get those sounds?

590
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,389
- [James] Yeah, Lisa and I were recording.
- Okay.

591
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,220
I went to see if I could find
what was makin' those noises.

592
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,101
I couldn't find anything.
Did you guys find anything?

593
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,181
[James] No, dude.

594
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,892
Just let's get back to the camp, okay?

595
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,194
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

596
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,196
- [James] You okay?
- Yeah.

597
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,364
[James] Okay.

598
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,577
[camera beeps]

599
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,334
[Ashley] You guys, get out here!

600
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,634
No. No, no, no, I'm getting out of here.

601
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,257
I'm packing, I'm leaving.
This is fucked up.

602
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,762
[James] Holy shit.

603
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,264
[Ashley] I wanna go home, okay?

604
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,765
[James] Where'd this stuff
come from?

605
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,768
Someone must've put these things up
while we were asleep.

606
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,224
[Lane] Why, what's going on?
What's wrong'?

607
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,483
[Ashley] What do you think?
[chuckles]

608
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,106
We should film these.
Talia, get the camera.

609
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,607
You guys should be taking pictures!

610
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,859
What is it? [gasps]

611
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,277
[Lane] Thank you.

612
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,573
[Talia] What? What is it?

613
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,777
[Ashley] You guys, seriously
I want to go home now.

614
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,077
We need to get out of here.

615
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,951
[Peter] Hey, James,
that's not a bad idea, okay?

616
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,327
We're not prepared for this.

617
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,623
[James] Okay, I've seen this stuff before.

618
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,746
This was in Heather's footage, guys.

619
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,452
Shit, there's another one back here.

620
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,082
[Lane] That's my tent!

621
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,789
[James] Does anybody know
what time it is?

622
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,465
My watch is sayin' 2:00 p.m.

623
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,009
[Ashley] What?
How is it even possible we just woke up?

624
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,085
[Peter] Look, I know I was tired,

625
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,466
but how did we sleep
till 2:00 in the afternoon?

626
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,762
[Ashley] Can we please get out of here?

627
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,010
[James] You know what? Ashley's right.

628
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,012
Let's just pack up our stuff
and get back to my car, okay?

629
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,809
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Are you sure'?

630
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,353
Yeah, yeah, this is too weird.

631
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,472
I dunno, we found something, right?

632
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,977
Like, we can show the footage
to the police.

633
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,525
Maybe they'll reopen Heather's case.

634
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,069
Wait, I wanna get that on camera.

635
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,316
[Ashley] I think it's just...

636
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,739
Just rip it off the tree,
for Christ's sake.

637
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,825
[James] Oh, holy shit.

638
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,198
Wait, wait, that's the shot,
that's the shot.

639
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,278
[Ashley] I have an idea.

640
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,989
Why don't you stay here
and get all the footage you want?

641
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,415
All right, that's it.
Come on, turn it off.

642
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,537
Turn it off. Let's go!

643
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,913
[Lane] I wanna get a shot of it, okay?

644
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:11,878
[Ashley] Oh, fuck this.

645
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,121
[Lisa] So, hey,
what kinda camera is that, man?

646
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,706
Oh, it's a DV camera.

647
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:56,881
[Lisa] Oh, yeah?

648
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,709
It's old. It's good in low light.

649
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,544
- It's better than modern cameras.
- [Lisa] Okay.

650
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,004
Does it use tapes?

651
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,089
Like the one you found? Or is it...

652
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,595
You know, there's not too many brands
of them anymore. Why?

653
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,892
Oh, nothing, I... Just curious.

654
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,221
[Lane] Well, I mean, I recommend it.
Everything is cards now,

655
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,273
but in some ways, you know tapes are
more reliable and cheaper.

656
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,895
Do have to carry
a lot of batteries, though.

657
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,022
[Lisa] Oh, yeah?

658
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,102
[cracking]
[Ashley] Ow! Ah!

659
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,277
[James] Ooh! Ashley!

660
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,693
- [Peter] Hey, you all right?
- You okay? What's going on?

661
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,944
[Ashley] Yeah, yeah, yeah-.

662
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,196
I'm fine. It's just my foot.

663
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,573
[James] Want me to take
the boot off?

664
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,905
[Ashley] No, it just hurt for a second,
but feels fine now.

665
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,740
- [James] Okay. Can you feel that?
- [Ashley] Yeah.

666
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,075
- [James] Does that hurt?
- [Ashley] It's fine.

667
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,411
[Talia] Hey, Lane. Lane.

668
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,665
Stop it. Stop it!

669
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,246
- What the fuck are you doing?
- [Lisa] What is this?

670
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,956
This looks familiar, doesn't it, guys?

671
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,416
Yeah, that's rope. And kindling.

672
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,921
That's useful for camping.
Give that to me!

673
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,298
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
Get back.

674
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,175
[Lisa] You have the symbols from the camp,
don't you, Talia?

675
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,380
So can I see one?

676
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,091
Because this rope looks exactly the same.

677
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,175
[Ashley] What the hell?

678
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,680
Definitely does not look the same.

679
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,931
Rope is rope. Open your eyes.

680
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,105
[Peter] But let her see it, then.
She doesn't need to see it!

681
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,932
- Let her see it.
- Get the fuck off me, man!

682
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,267
Hey, hey! Listen, stop it!

683
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,273
Listen, we weren't trying to scare you
or anything, we just...

684
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,946
We weren't lying about the things
that are going on in these woods.

685
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,945
We just needed somebody
to see what was happening.

686
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,116
[Lane] Oh, no, no, no!

687
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,662
Did you... You faked this?

688
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,535
Yeah, yeah, we faked it.

689
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,496
All right, but look we faked
it because it's real, okay?

690
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,458
There really is something happening here,
guys, in these woods.

691
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,792
[Ashley] And that makes sense to you?

692
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,969
Hey, we didn't fake
those noises last night.

693
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,514
And sleeping until 2:00?
How could we fake that?

694
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,092
There is something really going on
out here in these woods.

695
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,597
Right. For all we know
you guys put sleeping pills

696
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,893
in our water or something.

697
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,263
- What?
- Did you?

698
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,314
- No!
- No, 'course not.

699
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,812
Okay, fuck this. I'm out.

700
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,986
You guys-- you guys want this.

701
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,187
This is on you.

702
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,861
Hey, get a shot of this!

703
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,069
Lane.

704
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,614
[softly] Those fucking assholes.

705
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,500
[Lane] Uh, guys...

706
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,249
Uh...

707
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,960
We don't have the GPS thing.

708
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,087
There's no cell reception out here,
so I mean...

709
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,385
- [Peter] That's not our problem, man.
- Just hear rne out.

710
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,679
What if-- what if we get lost, okay?
What if we get lost?

711
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,382
[James] I thought you guys
came out here all the time?

712
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,181
- We've been following you!
- I don't know what--

713
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,012
[Peter] Oh, my god!
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man!

714
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,688
We've never been as far as the creek,
but nobody has.

715
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,855
Nobody's been here for years.

716
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,148
- Shit, man!
- [James] We don't know where we are!

717
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,567
- Okay, just calm down. We meant to..
- Fuck!

718
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,019
- We wanted safety in numbers, okay?
- Jesus Christ!

719
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,524
There's more of us,
so the odds are better.

720
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,276
Is there anything that you two told us
that is not a lie?

721
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,948
And I guess it's just a coincidence
that your camera uses

722
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,942
the exact same kind of tape
that you found?

723
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,034
No, it wasn't...

724
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,829
[James] Okay, I think you two got
all the footage you need.

725
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,202
You walk that way for about two miles,
you'll hit the fence.

726
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,159
Look, can we just calm down?
We could just talk about this.

727
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,710
- No! Get outta here!
- Guys, come on, please!

728
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,129
- Okay, okay, sure, sure! Go, go.
- Please! Just come on.

729
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,089
Cut the camera off.

730
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,501
You guys don't understand,
okay, you're not from here.

731
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,881
- [Peter] Get out of here!
- [Ashley] Just go! We're done talking!

732
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,257
It's time to go! Let's go!

733
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,838
- Stop it!
- Please, man!

734
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,594
- Take him. Go.
- Come on!

735
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,475
[Lane] Guys, are you sure this is--

736
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,520
Does this have to happen?
We could talk about this.

737
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,519
- We could talk about it. I have like...
- [James] Hey, we're done--

738
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,272
Lane, I swear to-- Fuck you!

739
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,148
[Lane] Oh, my god, no!
Wait, hold on! Stop!

740
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,153
Fuck.

741
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,568
Hey... James, man.

742
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,822
[Ashley] I'm so sorry.

743
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,665
I actually thought that...
Heather could still be out here.

744
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,247
[Peter] They're pathetic, man.

745
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,831
[James] God, I should've known they were--
Fuck.

746
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,005
I guess I just...

747
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,973
Oh, god. [sniffles]

748
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,264
[Lisa] Yeah, well...

749
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,816
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel a little bit,

750
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,235
you know,
less scared being in the woods now.

751
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,061
[all] Yeah.

752
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,029
[Peter] Are you gonna be okay?

753
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,692
- [James] I'm all right, man. I'm okay.
- I'ma give you a hug.

754
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,785
- Don't give me a hug.
- I'ma give you a hug.

755
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,658
Don't give me a hug...

756
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,705
- [Ashley] Aw, look at that.
- [grunts]

757
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,499
[indistinct chatter]

758
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,800
- [Ashley gasps]
- [Peter] Oh, sorry.

759
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,252
[Ashley whispers] That's okay.

760
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,859
- I've got it.
- [sighs]

761
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,984
[Peter] Lisa, come on. Let's go.

762
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,746
[Peter] Hey, James.

763
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,790
We anywhere close to the fence yet?

764
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,412
[James] Yep. Should be.

765
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,777
[Lisa] This looks familiar.

766
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,691
[Peter] That's a good thing, right?

767
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,367
[Ashley] How can you even tell?

768
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:19,117
[Lisa] I don't know. Just...
I thought we'd...

769
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,657
[Ashley] Baby, what?

770
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,626
[Peter] No. No! No way! No way!

771
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,339
[Ashley] We've been walking in a circle?

772
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,543
[James] That doesn't make sense.
I've been following the GPS.

773
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,218
Then we should've reached
the fence hours ago!

774
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,343
We shouldn't be back at the same fuckin'
campsite we just left!

775
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,720
- Can I see the GPS, James?
- Yeah. It must be broken.

776
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,800
[sighs]

777
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,345
- [Ashley] We're lost.
- [James] No, we're not lost.

778
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,021
We, we got turned around. We gotta...

779
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,769
[Peter] "Got turned around."

780
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,689
[sighs] Let's look around with the drone.

781
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,894
We can start hiking for the road.

782
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,274
Yeah, okay, let's do that.

783
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,821
[cracking] I
[Ashley groans in paln]

784
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,740
[Peter] Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

785
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,488
Hey, are you okay?

786
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,407
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

787
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,364
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

788
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,786
- You can't--
- I'm fine.

789
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,617
You can't keep walkin'.

790
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,748
- We gotta camp here tonight, y'all.
- [Ashley] No, no, no, no...

791
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,170
No, no, no, babe, you gotta...
[cracking]

792
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,755
' [Peter] Okay' ghh!
' ey' he}! he ' y!

793
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,958
[sobbing] I can't stay here
another night, Peter!

794
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,918
I can't stay here another night, okay?

795
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,753
Hey, hey, hey, you need to rest.

796
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,383
Okay? You gotta let that foot heal.

797
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,931
- [James] Yeah, yeah.
- Okay?

798
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,054
Look, let's just set up the tents.

799
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,683
We'll be okay. This is fine.
We'll-- we'll figure it out.

800
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,061
[Ashley] Can you please

801
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,063
at least take down
those creepy stick figures?

802
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,861
- I can't look at those things anymore.
- I got it, I got it.

803
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,162
[Lisa] Hey, can I see your camera?

804
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,367
Just wanna charge the batteries

805
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,043
and change the cards out and stuff.

806
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,210
[soft thud]
[James] Yeah.

807
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,252
- [Lisa] Did you hear that?
- [James] What?

808
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,502
[Lisa] Nothing.

809
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,466
Nothing. My ears are playing tricks on me.

810
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,139
You know what?
I thought I heard a voice earlier--

811
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,343
Hey.

812
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,429
Hey, how you doin'?

813
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,765
[Ashley] I'm fine. I'm just freezing.

814
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,192
Can you tell James to start a fire?

815
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,942
Okay.

816
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:15,778
Oh, babe.

817
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,856
Hey, we should check out
this cut on your foot.

818
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,361
Yeah, okay.

819
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,833
Okay... I'll just take that off.

820
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,839
- Ow!
- Oh, babe, okay.

821
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,467
- Be careful, it hurts.
- I gotcha. All right.

822
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,096
Looks like you...

823
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,521
It's a bit irritated.

824
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,391
Is it bad?

825
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,477
[stammers]
No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. No, it's fine.

826
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,903
I mean, uh, we should just,

827
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,652
you know, um, put some ointment on it.

828
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,732
I'll go get James and--
[cracking]

829
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,783
- [screams]
- What, what, what, what, what?

830
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,031
Don't do that! Ow!

831
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,784
- What was that? What just happened?
- [groans]

832
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,285
[Ashley] okay. okay-

833
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,409
It's fine now. Just...

834
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,915
be careful how you touch it, okay?

835
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,623
That's how it felt
when I fell earlier today.

836
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,513
O-- okay, um...
I'm gonna set your foot down. Okay?

837
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,805
And, uh...

838
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,097
You should just stay lying down.
I'll be right back.

839
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,055
[drone beeping]
Okay. I'm just gonna rest my eyes.

840
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,307
Okay.
[drone whirring]

841
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,276
[Peter] Hey, I need to talk to you.

842
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,074
That cut on Ashley's foot,
it's gotten worse.

843
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,197
[inaudible]

844
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,252
But-- No, no, whatever it was,

845
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,749
it was really fuckin' weird, man, and--

846
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,456
[James] Okay.
You said it looked like a muscle spasm?

847
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,257
Yeah, or something like--

848
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,506
I don't know. Whatev--
There's something inside of her cut.

849
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,679
Now she's cold
and I think she has a fever.

850
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,971
So I just...

851
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,924
[James] Okay.
Okay, I'll go take a look at it right now.

852
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,224
- Thank you.
- Yep.

853
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,387
[Peter] I wanna keep
a fire goin' for her tonight.

854
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,314
So I'm gonna gather some wood
if you guys think you can get it started.

855
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,892
- That's a good idea.
- Thanks, man.

856
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,977
- Hey, keep your walkie-talkie on.
- Of course.

857
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,946
[Lisa] Hey, will you look at this?

858
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,648
[James] What? What is it?

859
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,569
Well, I don't see a road
or the creek or anything.

860
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,575
Should I take it further out?

861
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,995
Maybe it's the angle or something?

862
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,496
[erratic whirring]
What?

863
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,952
[James] Whoa. What happened?

864
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,083
I don't know. I don't...

865
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,288
Oh, my god. Oh, shit!

[Peter] Oh, god damn it.

871
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,440
Lisa, if you're watching this footage,

872
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,113
I think you're gonna wanna delete it.

873
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,485

[Lisa] How is she?

876
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,606
[whispers] It's infected
and she has a fever.

877
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,561
Did you see anything, like...
moving, like Peter said?

878
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,445
[Ashley groans]

879
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,193
Uh, nothing like that.

880
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,746
But we should take her
straight to the closest ER tomorrow.

881
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,456
Okay.

882

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,376
Peter!

939
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,382
Peter!

940
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,089
[walkie-talkie beeps]

941
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,388
Peter, can you hear me?

942
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,854
Peter, if you're hurt
or you can't speak or something

943
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,522
just press the button
on your walkie-talkie twice.

944
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,849
Two clicks.

945
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,855
Peter, if you can hear me, just press
the button on your walkie-talkie.

946
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,066
[shouts] Peter!

947
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:00,951
[sighs] Fuck.

948
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,444
- [gasps]
- Lisa.

949
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,779
What?

950
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,705
I don't feel so good.

951
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,288
Where's Peter?

952
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,837
Um, he went to go get some firewood,

953
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,914
but he'll be back soon, okay?

954
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,250
Come on, let's get you back to bed.

955
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,562
- Lisa!
- [93598]

956
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,688
Hey.

957
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,815
Would everyone stop doing that?

958
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,321
Oh, fuck.

959
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,950
I found Peter's flashlight out there.

960
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,155
Shit.

961
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,293
That was him
screaming out there, right?

962
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,627
- I think so.
- Oh, god!

963
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,467
[Lisa] No, James, look, it'll be okay.

964
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,258
Look, we need to stay together.

965
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,015
[James] Yeah, you're right, you're right.

966
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,387
Let's just keep the fire going.

967
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,015
If he sees it,
he can find his way back.

968
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,555
[Lisa softly] Okay.

969
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,336
You know, I actually thought that

970
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,883
Heather could still be out
in these woods, somehow.

971
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,969
But now... Peter's lost.

972
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,888
And Ashley's hurt.

973
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,845
It'll be okay.

974
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,192
[branches breaking]

975
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,318
[whispers] Did you hear that?

976
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,523
Yeah.

977
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,115
[branch breaking]

978
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,031
Do you think that could be Peter?

979
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,582
I don't know.

980
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:55,869
[tent unzipping]

981
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,296
[James] Peter!

982
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,223
[rustling]

983
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,558
Peter?

984
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,144
[rustling]

985
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,145
[James] Lane? Talia?

986
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,106
[Lisa] What are you guys doing here?
[Talia] Is that really them?

987
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,941
[Lane] No, no, no. It's not really them!
Okay? Don't go close.

988
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,446
It's a trick. It's a trick.

989
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,661
When was the last time you saw us?

990
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,907
[Lisa] Uh, earlier this afternoon.

991
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,291
[Talia] They're not lying.

992
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,086
It's been five days since we saw you.
Maybe six.

993
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,754
I don't even fucking know. The sun--

994
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,376
the sun is not coming up!

995
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,379
- The sun is not fucking coming up!
- [Talia shushing]

996
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,085
What are you talking about?

997
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,215
[Lane] Hey, where--
where are the other two?

998
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,342
Peter and what's-her-name?

999
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,765
Um, Ashley's sleeping.
She's not feeling well,

1000
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,059
and we don't know where Peter is.

1001
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,471
It's starting for them. We have to go.

1002
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,851
- Come on, we have to go.
- No, I don't wanna go.

1003
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,773
[Lisa] Guys, we're not gonna fall
for your stupid shit again!

1004
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,100
Can you just tell us what's going on?

1005
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,776
Do I look like I'm messing with you?

1006
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,852
Do you have any food?

1007
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,279
No, no, get back!

1008
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,401
Please.

1009
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,823
Will you get back here, please?

1010
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,320
[Talia] I want it!

1011
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,492
Stop it!

1012
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,990
[Lane] We're alive!
Don't you see that? You crazy?

1013
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,946
[Talia] Look at them!
They're doing better than us, aren't they?

1014
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,038
[Lane] Are they?

1015
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,991
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know.

1016
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,200
[Lane] No, no, no, no, no!

1017
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,911
If you wanna stay here, you go ahead.

1018
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,462
[Talia] Please, Lane, don't!
No, please don't!

1019
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,460
[Lane] These people are gonna die.

1020
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,291
And they're gonna be here forever.

1021
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,378
Not me! Not me!

1022
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,882
[Tafia] Lane!

1023
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,346
[Lisa] Talia.

1024
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,230
- [screams]
- [Lisa gasps]

1025
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,330
[Lisa] We're just gonna go sit by a fire

1026
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,785
and we'll set up a tent for you, okay?

1027
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,670
[Talia] Is he coming back?

1028
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,358
[camera beeps]
[Lisa exhales]

1029
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,667
[Lisa] I don't think I can sleep.

1030
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,131
[sighs]

1031
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,584
Me neither.

[cell phone buzzing]

1033
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,075
What? Makes no sense.

1034
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,371
What?

1035
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,920
Well I set the alarm for 7:00,
but it's still dark outside.

1036
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,755
Okay. We should pack up.

1037
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:33,961
Okay.

1038
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,386
[James] What the hell?

1039
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,689
[branches creaking]

1040
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,142
[James] Oh, my god!

1041
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,648
Oh, my god.

1042
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,025
Lisa...

1043
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:53,860
Lisa, get out here.

1044
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,699
[Lisa] What the fuck is that?

1045
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,367
[gasps]

1046
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:58,861
Oh, my god.

1047
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,280
Oh, my god.

1048
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,077
How did we not hear this?

1049
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,419
Holy shit.

1050
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,920
[James] Oh, fuck.

1051
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,295
[Lisa] They're everywhere.

1052
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,098
Who could have done this?

1053
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:21,843
[James] Oh, my 90¢

1054
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,307
Oh, the web cam!

1055
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,810
Shit, the battery's dead.
[twig snaps]

1056
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,312
Have to go, we have to go,
we have to go!

1057
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,109
We have to go. We...

1058
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,812
We have to go now.

1059
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,114
[James] Yeah. Okay.
Let's pack up our things.

[screams]

1061
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,488
[James] Ashley.

1062
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,695
[Ashley] What the shit?

1063
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,496
[Lisa] Are you okay?

1064
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,492
What is going on?

1065
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,786
What is she doing here?
Where is Peter?

1066
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,037
[loud creaking]
[screaming]

1067
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,418
[Lisa] Talia came back a few hours ago.
She got lost, but...

1068
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,499
[James] You're okay.
You're okay.

1069
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,085
- Peter... We're not sure.
- [James] It's okay. You just bumped it.

1070
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,762
[Lisa] Ashley?

1071
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,759
Ashley? Ashley? Ashley?

1072
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,934
Ashley?

1073
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,136
I feel sick.

1074
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,268
Okay. Okay, well...

1075
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,942
What about the, um...
What about the drone camera?

1076
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,314
Can you send the drone camera up?

1077
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,440
Can you look for him with that?

1078
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,022
- Like you were looking for--
- [James] Ashley, it crashed.

1079
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,732
No! No! Don't tell me that!

1080
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,159
[crying] This is hair.

1081
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,952
This is hair.

1082
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,414
My...

1083
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,961
[sobs] This is my hair.

1084
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,038
[Ashley] Of course, it's your hair.
- [Talia] She took my hair.

1085
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,465
- You did this!
- Ashley, Ashley, no, no, no.

1086
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,293
- No, just shut up! Shut up, get away!
- [Talia screaming]

1087
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,468
[James] Don't!

[Ashley] God! Oh, my god!

1091
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,600
[Lisa] No, don't look, don't look,
don't look!

1092
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,153
- [Talia gurgling]
- [Ashley] I didn't mean it! Oh, my god!

1093
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,401
[Lisa] Is she gonna be okay.

1094
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,699
Ashley. Ashley, Ashley, Ashley,

1095
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,152
it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
