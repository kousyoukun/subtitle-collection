经历数之不尽的 艰难限阻…
Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered...

10
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,247
我终于到了城堡 在格布林鬼城那里…
I have fought my way to the castle beyond the Goblin City...

11
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,350
找回了被你偷走的小孩
to take back the child that you have stolen.

12
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,589
因为我的毅力 同你一样坚韧…
For my will is as strong as yours...

13
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,190
而且我的国度一样的伟大…
and my kingdom is as great...

14
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:32,071
因为我的毅力同你一样坚韧 我的国度一样的伟大…
For my will is as strong as yours, my kingdom as great...

15
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,442
该死
Damn.

16
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,040
噢 我怎么也记不住这一行
Oh, I can never remember that line.

17
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:41,784
你的法力并不强过我
"You have no power over me."

18
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,184
噢 墨林
Oh, Merlin.

19
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,457
噢不 墨林 难以置信已经7点了！
Oh, no, Merlin. I don't believe it. It's 7:00!

20
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,834
快点快点
Come on. Come on!

21
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,280
噢那可不是个神话
Oh, it's not fair!

22
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,713
噢真的
Oh, really.

23
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,316
- 对不起  - 别站在雨里快进来
- I'm sorry. - Don't stand in the rain. Come on.

24
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,487
好快进去墨林
All right. Come on, Merlin.

25
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,530
- 快点  - 狗不行
- Come on. - Not the dog.

26
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,828
- 但下着这么大雨  - 别废话让它去车库
- But it's pouring. - Go on, into the garage.

27
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,000
去吧墨林去车库去
Go on, Merlin. Go into the garage.

28
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,504
去
Go.

29
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,412
- 莎拉你迟了一个小时了  - 我说了对不起了
- Sarah, you're an hour late. - I said I was sorry!

30
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,447
请让我说完
Please let me finish.

31
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,507
- 你爸爸和我很少出去  - 你每一个周末都出去玩
- Your father and I go out rarely. - You go out every single weekend.

32
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,577
我只是让你代看一下你弟弟 这对你做的事又没有什么影响
I ask you to baby-sit only if it won't interfere with your plans.

33
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,386
你根本不知道我打算做什么 你根本不曾问过我
You don't know what my plans are. You don't even ask me anymore.

34
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,690
我猜你会跟我说你有个约会 如果你有约会我会很高兴
I assume you'd tell me you had a date. I'd like it if you had a date.

35
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:33,823
- 在你这年纪你应该约会  - 莎拉你回来拉
- You should have dates at your age. - Sarah, you're home.

36
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,494
- 我们正担心你呢  - 我就不能做什么好事是吗？
- We were worried about you. - I can't do anything right, can I?

37
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,270
她待我就像个 神话里的可恶的后母
She treats me like a wicked stepmother in a fairy story no matter what I say.

38
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,831
我会跟她谈谈
I'll talk to her.

39
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,261
经历了未知的危险…
Through dangers untold...

40
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,690
和数不尽的艰辛…
and hardships unnumbered...

41
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,431
我终于到了这里 这个城堡…
I have fought my way here to the castle...

42
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,530
在格布林鬼城那里…
beyond the Goblin City...

43
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,375
找回了小孩…
to take back the child...

44
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,209
你偷走的那个小孩
that you have stolen.

45
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,785
- 我能跟你谈谈吗？  - 没什么好谈的
- Can I talk to you? - There's nothing to talk about!

46
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,448
快点你们要迟到了
Hurry. You're gonna be late.

47
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,991
听着我们喂过了托比 已经把他放到床上了
Listen, we fed Toby and put him to bed.

48
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,119
我们现在得离开了 我们会在半夜里回来
We do have to leave now, but we'll be back around midnight.

49
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,559
你真的想同我谈谈是吗？
You really wanted to talk to me, didn't you?

50
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,397
还是把门关上吧
Practically broke down the door.

51
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,394
兰斯洛特
Lancelot!

52
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,635
有人又到过我的屋 碰过我的东西
Someone has been in my room again.

53
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,645
讨厌讨厌！
I hate that. I hate it!

54
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,650
我恨你我恨你
I hate you. I hate you!

55
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,320
帮帮我  把我从这个该死的地方带走
Someone save me, take me away from this awful place!

56
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,527
想要什么？ 你想听故事吗？
What do you want? You want a story, huh?

57
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,031
好吧
Okay.

58
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,735
从前有一个 漂亮的小女孩…
Once upon a time there was a beautiful, young girl...

59
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,968
她的继母总是让她留在家里看孩子
whose stepmother always made her stay home with the baby.

60
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,443
这个小孩被宠坏了 什么都想要…
The baby was a spoiled child and wanted everything for himself...

61
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,447
而这个小女孩简直就是个奴隶
and the young girl was practically a slave.

62
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,550
但是没人知道…
But what no one knew...

63
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,746
格布林鬼城的国王爱上了这个女孩…
was that the king of the goblins had fallen in love with the girl...

64
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,346
并且给了她一些魔力
and he had given her certain powers.

65
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,924
这样一天晚上…
So one night...

66
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,450
当这个小孩虐待她的时候…
when the baby had been particularly cruel to her...

67
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,157
她召唤了妖精来帮她
she called on the goblins for help.

68
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,257
听着
Listen.

69
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,672
“快说那些话”妖精们说
"Say your right words," the goblins said.

70
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,467
“我们会把孩子带到格布林鬼城…
"And we'll take the baby to the Goblin City...

71
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,241
你就自由了”
and you will be free. "

72
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,480
但是女孩知道 格布林鬼城的国王…
But the girl knew that the king of the goblins...

73
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,148
会永远永远把孩子留在城堡里…
would keep the baby in his castle forever and ever and ever...

74
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,748
并且把他变成个妖精
and turn it into a goblin.

75
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,794
因此女孩被默默地折磨着…
So the girl suffered in silence...

76
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,854
直到一天晚上 当她经受一整天的家务活的劳累…
until one night, when she was tired from a day of housework...

77
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,698
之后又被后母的尖刻的言语所伤…
and she was hurt by the harsh words of her stepmother...

78
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,998
她再也不能忍受了
and she could no longer stand it...

79
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,639
噢 好吧
Oh, all right!

80
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,974
别闹了 来吧
Knock it off. Come on.

81
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,243
住口
Stop it!

82
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,251
我会这样说
I'll say the words.

83
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,482
不 我不会 我不会这么说
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.

84
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,855
我希望…
I wish...

85
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:47,984
我希望…
I wish.

86
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,324
- 她就要说了  - 说什么？
- She's going to say it. - Say what?

87
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,693
- 闭嘴  - 对不起
- Shut up. - Sorry.

88
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,733
你们闭嘴
You shut up.

89
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,565
听着她就要说了
Listen. She's going to say the words.

90
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,128
我都等不及了
I can bear it no longer!

91
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:04,141
格布林鬼城的国王 格布林鬼城的国王 无论你在哪里…
Goblin King, Goblin King, wherever you may be...

92
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,703
把我的这个孩子带走吧 离我远远的
take this child of mine far away from me!

93
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,440
- 不  - 不是这个
- No! - That's not it.

94
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:16,043
她从哪里学来的这些垃圾？ 根本不是以“我希望”开头的
Where'd she learn that rubbish? It doesn't even start with "I wish."

95
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,881
托比别哭了
Toby, stop it!

96
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,927
我希望我知道该说什么 才能让妖精把你捉去
I wish I did know what to say to make the goblins take you away.

97
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,796
我希望妖精们会来 现在就把你捉走
"I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now."

98
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,802
这不难是吗？
That's not hard, is it?

99
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,004
我希望
I wish...

100
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,666
我希望
I wish...

101
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,677
- 她说了吗？  - 闭嘴
- Did she say it? - Shut up!

102
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,588
我希望妖精们来把你带走
I wish the goblins would come and take you away.

103
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,128
就现在
Right now.

104
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,622
托比？
Toby?

105
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,154
托比你还好吗？
Toby, are you all right?

106
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,036
为什么你不哭了？
Why aren't you crying?

107
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,759
你是他是吗？你是格布林鬼城的国王
You're him, aren't you? You're the goblin king.

108
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,731
请把我的弟弟还给我 如果真是那样
I want my brother back, please, if it's all the same.

109
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,131
说过的话就是说了
What's said is said.

110
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,203
可是我不是那个意思
But I didn't mean it.

111
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,363
- 噢 你不是那个意思  - 求求你
- Oh, you didn't. - Please.

112
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,770
他在哪里？
Where is he?

113
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,469
你很清楚他在哪里
You know very well where he is.

114
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,478
请把他还给我
Please bring him back. Please.

115
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,638
莎拉…
Sarah...

116
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,842
回到你的房间里去…
go back to your room...

117
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,513
玩你的玩具 摆弄你的衣服
play with your toys and your costumes.

118
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,557
忘了孩子
Forget about the baby.

119
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,157
我不能
I can't.

120
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,854
我给你带了个礼物
I've brought you a gift.

121
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,956
- 是什么？  - 是个水晶球
- What is it? - It's a crystal.

122
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,227
没什么特别
Nothing more.

123
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,565
但如果你这样…
But if you turn it this way...

124
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,262
看里面
Iook into it.

125
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,704
它会显现出你的梦
It will show you your dreams.

126
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,868
这可不是给普通女孩的礼物…
But this is not a gift for an ordinary girl...

127
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,879
谁会在意一个哭闹的小孩
who takes care of a screaming baby.

128
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,077
想要它吗？
Do you want it?

129
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,246
那就忘了孩子吧
Then forget the baby.

130
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,015
我不能
I can't.

131
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,154
我感谢您为我做的这些 但是我想要回我的弟弟
I appreciate what you're trying to do for me, but I want my brother back.

132
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,198
- 他一定很害怕  - 莎拉
- He must be so scared. - Sarah.

133
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,907
别拒绝我
Don't defy me.

134
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,780
你可不能跟我斗
You're no match for me.

135
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,947
但我得要回我的弟弟
But I have to have my brother back.

136
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,158
他在那里在我的城堡里
He's there, in my castle.

137
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,833
你还想去找他吗？
Do you still want to look for him?

138
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,834
就是在格布林 鬼城那个城堡吗？
Is that the castle beyond the Goblin City?

139
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:06,037
回去吧莎拉 回去否则就太迟了
Turn back, Sarah. Turn back before it's too late.

140
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,976
我不能
I can't.

141
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,073
你还不明白我说的吗？
Don't you understand that I can't?

142
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,742
真可惜
What a pity.

143
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,018
它看起来并不那么远
It doesn't look that far.

144
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,319
比你想象的远时间很短
It's further than you think. Time is short.

145
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,294
你有13个小时来穿过迷宫…
You have 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth...

146
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,528
要赶在你的小弟弟…
before your baby brother...

147
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,661
成为我们中的一员之前…
becomes one of us...

148
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,170
永远地
forever.

149
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,208
真可惜
<i>Such a pity.</i>

150
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,771
迷宫
The labyrinth.

151
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,142
看起来并不那么难
It doesn't look that hard.

152
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,112
好吧走吧
Well, come on, feet.

153
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,508
- 打扰了？  - 噢 打扰了
- Excuse me? - Oh, excuse me!

154
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,945
噢 是你
Oh, it's you.

155
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,247
打扰了 我必须得穿过这个迷宫 你能帮我吗？
Excuse me, but I have to get through this labyrinth. Can you help me?

156
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,954
噢 多可爱啊
Oh, how sweet.

157
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,019
五十七
Fifty-seven!

158
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,623
- 你怎么能？  - 是的
- How could you? - Yeah.

159
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,825
可怜的小东西
Poor thing.

160
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,537
你这个怪物 噢
You monster. Ow!

161
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,468
她咬我
It bit me!

162
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,805
那你希望小精灵做什么？
What did you expect fairies to do?

163
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:49,007
我以为她们会满足人们的愿望
I thought they did nice things like granting wishes.

164
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,549
啊？看来你什么都不知道 是吧？
Huh? Shows what you know, don't it?

165
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,753
- 五十八  - 你真可恶
- Fifty-eight. - You're horrible.

166
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,618
啊？不 不是这样
Huh? No, I ain't.

167
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,849
我是霍格 你是谁？
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?

168
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,723
我也想问你呢
That's what I thought.

169
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,286
五十九
Fifty-nine.

170
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,594
你知道迷宫的门在哪里吗？
Do you know where the door to the labyrinth is?

171
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,100
- 也许  - 在哪里？
- Maybe. - Where is it?

172
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,659
噢 小东西
Oh, you little...

173
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,465
六十
Sixty!

174
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,836
- 我说它在哪里？  - 什么在哪里？
- I said, where is it? - Where is what?

175
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,069
- 门  - 什么门？
- The door. - What door?

176
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,667
看来不可能从你那里问出点什么来
It's hopeless asking you anything.

177
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,441
那是因为你没有问对问题
Not if you ask the right questions.

178
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,346
怎样我才能 进入那个迷宫啊？
How do I get into the labyrinth?

179
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:32,582
这还差不多
Now that's more like it.

180
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,524
你从这里进去
You gets in there.

181
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,504
你真的要进去是吗？
You really going in there, are you?

182
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:51,572
是的
Yes.

183
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,168
恐怕我必须得去
I'm afraid I have to.

184
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,763
挺容易是吗？
Cozy, isn't it?

185
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:28,445
现在你是向左还是向右？
Now, would you go left or right?

186
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:35,113
- 两面看起来都一样  - 嗯你不会走得太远的
- They both look the same. - Well, you're not gonna get very far.

187
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,054
- 你会去哪边？  - 我？
- Which way would you go? - Me?

188
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,624
两面我都不去
I wouldn't go either way.

189
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,455
如果你只愿意帮忙到这里的话 你可以走了
If that's all the help you're gonna be, you can just leave.

190
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,691
你知道你的问题在哪吗？ 你得自己努力
You know your problem? You take too many things for granted.

191
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,123
拿这个迷宫来说
Take this labyrinth...

192
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,432
即使你到了它的中间 你也走不出来
Even if you get to the center, you'll never get out again.

193
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:56,531
- 那是你的看法  - 至少比你的好
- That's your opinion. - It's a lot better than yours.

194
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,973
就算这样也多谢你 霍格特
Thanks for nothing, Hogwart.

195
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,214
是霍格 别说我没警告你
It's Hoggle! And don't say I didn't warn you.

196
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,707
什么“迷宫”啊？ 没有拐弯也没有拐角
What do they mean, "labyrinth"? There aren't any turns or corners.

197
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,150
只是不断延伸下去
It just goes on and on.

198
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,894
或许它有尽头
Maybe it doesn't.

199
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,828
或许只是我以为它有没有
Maybe I'm just taking it for granted that it does.

200
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,382
您好
'Allo.

201
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,691
是你说“哈喽”的吗？
Did you say "hello"?

202
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,456
不 我是说“啊喽” 不过也差不多了
No, I said "'allo," but that's close enough.

203
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,090
- 你是只蠕虫是吗？  - 没错
- You're a worm, aren't you? - That's right.

204
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,195
或许你知道怎样通过这个迷宫吧？
You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth?

205
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,763
谁 我？我我只是条虫子
Who, me? No, I'm just a worm.

206
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,440
进来见见我太太吧
Come inside, meet the missus.

207
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,709
不谢谢你 我先得搞定这个迷宫
No, thank you, but I have to solve this labyrinth.

208
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,410
可是这条巷即没有拐弯又没有出口 什么都没有
But there aren't any turns or any openings or anything.

209
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,578
一望又没有尽头
It just goes on and on.

210
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,556
你只是看不到 这里到处都是出口 但你却看不见
You ain't looking right. It's full of openings, but you ain't seeing 'em.

211
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,990
- 出口在哪？  - 穿过那儿就有一个
- Where are they? - There's one just across there.

212
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,426
就在你前面
It's right in front of ya.

213
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,623
没有啊
No, there isn't.

214
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,496
进来喝杯茶吧
Come inside and have a nice cup of tea.

215
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:13,561
- 但这里没有出口啊  - 肯定有
- But there isn't an opening. - Of course there is.

216
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,199
你试着走过去 你就明白我的意思了
You try walking through it. You'll see what I mean.

217
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,367
什么？
What?

218
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,944
继续
Go on then.

219
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,072
那只是一堵墙 没有进去的路啊
That's just wall. There's no way through.

220
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,415
这里的东西并不总跟你所看到的一样
Things are not always what they seem in this place.

221
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,944
所以你不能光看表面
So you can't take anything for granted.

222
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,495
嘿
Hey!

223
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
- 继续  - 谢谢你
- Hang on. - Thank you.

224
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,162
- 您真帮了我的大忙  - 别去那边
- That was incredibly helpful. - Don't go that way.

225
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,036
- 什么？  - 我说别去那边
- What was that? - I said, don't go that way.

226
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,769
绝对不要走这条路
Never go that way.

227
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,710
噢多谢
Oh. Thanks.

228
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,976
如果她坚持走那条路的话…
If she had kept on going down that way...

229
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,882
那她很快就会到城堡了
she'd had gone straight to that castle.

230
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,626
托比
Toby.

231
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,633
我来啦 托比
I'm coming, Toby.

232
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,006
把这个还给我 快点 离我远点
Give me back this! Go on, get off me.

233
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,248
别走这条路 你在说什么？
Stay out of the way. What are you talking about?

234
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,252
走走走
Walk, walk, walk.

235
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,069
- 你让我想起了小孩  - 什么小孩？
- You remind me of the babe. - What babe?

236
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:03,671
- 拥有魔法的小孩  - 什么魔法？
- The babe with the power. - What power?

237
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,340
-  伏都魔法  - 谁会魔法？
- The power of voodoo. - Who do?

238
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,475
- 你会  - 会什么？
- You do. - Do what?

239
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,315
让我想起了小孩
Remind me of the babe.

240
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,015
安静点 一个小妖精
Quiet! A goblin babe.

241
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,293
嗯？
Well?

242
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,594
DAVID BOWIE - DANCE MAGIC

243
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,501
嘿 出了什么事吗？
Hey, what goes on?

244
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,866
你妈妈是个土豚
Your mother is an aardvark!

245
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,795
9个小时零23分钟后…
In 9 hours and 23 minutes...

246
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,798
你就是我的了
you'll be mine.

247
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,788
- 你明白了吗？  - 我明白了
- You got it? - I got it.

248
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,327
- 不错  - 嘘
- Good. - Shh!

249
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,035
有人改了我的标记
Someone has been changing my marks.

250
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,307
这真是个可怕的地方 这不公平
What a horrible place this is. It's not fair!

251
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,938
你说的对 这不公平
That's right. It's not fair.

252
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,146
而这只是其中一部分
But that's only half of it.

253
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,786
- 一分钟之前这里还是个死胡同  - 不 在你后面的才是死胡同
- This was a dead end a minute ago. - No, that's the dead end behind you.

254
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,560
它总是在变 我该怎么办呢？
It keeps changing. What am I supposed to do?

255
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,624
唯一的出路 就在这其中的一个门
The only way out of here is to try one of these doors.

256
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,637
其中一个通向迷宫中间的城堡
One of them leads to the castle at the center of the labyrinth.

257
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,038
- 另一个通向…  - 哺哺哺哺
- And the other one leads to... - Boom-boom-ba-boom.

258
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,041
死亡
Certain death.

259
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,706
哪个是哪个？
Which one is which?

260
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,807
- 我们不能告诉你  - 为什么不能？
- We can't tell you. - Why not?

261
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,551
- 我们不知道  - 但就是这样
- We don't know. - But they do.

262
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,589
哦 那我就去问他们
Oh. Then I'll ask them.

263
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,658
不 你不能问我们俩 你只能问我们其中一个
No, you can't ask us. You can only ask one of us.

264
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,664
这是规则 而且我得警告你…
It's in the rules, and I should warn you...

265
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,428
我们其中一人总是说实话…
one of us always tells the truth...

266
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,662
而另一人总是说慌
and one of us always lies.

267
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,204
这也是规则 他总是说谎
That's a rule too. He always lies.

268
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,764
- 我没有 我讲的是实话  - 哦 你看这谎说的
- I do not. I tell the truth. - Oh, what a lie.

269
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,306
他说谎
He's the liar.

270
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,071
好吧 回答是或不是
All right. Answer yes or no.

271
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:09,080
他会告诉我这扇门是通向城堡的吗？
Would he tell me that this door leads to the castle?

272
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:15,766
- 你认为呢？  - 我不知道
-What do you think? -l don't know.

273
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:16,986
是的
Yes.

274
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,992
那么另一扇门通向城堡…
Then the other door leads to the castle...

275
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,999
而这扇门通向死亡
and this door leads to certain death.

276
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,763
- 噢！  - 你怎么知道？
- Ooh! - How do you know?

277
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,704
- 他可能在说实话  - 那么你却不会
- He could be telling the truth. - But then you wouldn't be.

278
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,469
因此如果你告诉我他说是 我就知道答案是不
So if you told me that he said yes, I know the answer is no.

279
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,376
- 但我也可能在说实话  - 那么他说谎也行啊
- But I could be telling the truth. - But then he would be lying.

280
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:37,903
如果你告诉我他说是 我知道答案仍然是否
So if you told me that he said yes, I know the answer would still be no.

281
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,075
等一等 是这样吗？
Wait a minute. Is that right?

282
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,779
我不知道 我搞不清楚
I don't know. I've never understood it.

283
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,216
就是这样 我想出来了
No, it's right. I figured it out.

284
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,452
以前我就想不出来
I could never do it before.

285
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,486
我想我越来越聪明了 这是小菜一碟
I think I'm getting smarter. This is a piece of cake.

286
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,167
救命啊！
Help!

287
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,234
不要这样！救命啊！
Stop it! Help!

288
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,044
你不是喊救命吗？ 我们正在救你
What do you mean, "help"? We are helping.

289
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,113
我们是救命手
We're helping hands.

290
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,807
你们弄痛我了
You're hurting.

291
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,646
你要我们放手吗？
Would you like us to let go?

292
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,940
不
No!

293
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,320
那好 哪一边？
Well, then come on, which way?

294
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,789
哪一边？
Which way?

295
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,623
上还是下？
Up or down?

296
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,220
- 噢  - 说啊 说啊
- Oh. - Come on, come on.

297
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,265
我们没时间磨蹭
We haven't got all day.

298
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,097
看来这个决定很重大
Well, it's a big decision for her.

299
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,161
你想去哪一边啊？
Which way do you want to go, hmm?

300
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,537
是啊 哪一边？
Yes, which way?

301
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,409
既然我在向下 那就下吧
Well, since I'm pointed that way, I guess I'll go down.

302
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,539
她选择下
She chose down.

303
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,811
她选择下？
She chose down?

304
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,786
- 错了吗？  - 太迟了
- Was that wrong? - Too late now.

305
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,799
她掉进了地牢
She's in the oubliette.

306
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,930
住口！她不应该来到地牢
Shut up! She should not have gotten as far as the oubliette.

307
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,408
- 她现在应该放弃了  - 她不会放弃的
- She should have given up by now. - She'll never give up.

308
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,707
不会吗？ 矮子会带她回到入口处
Won't she? The dwarf's about to lead her back to the beginning.

309
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:20,273
当她意识到要从头开始 就会马上放弃
She'll soon give up when she realizes she has to start all over again.

310
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,319
那么笑吧
Well, laugh.

311
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,497
是谁？
Who's there?

312
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:35,998
是我
Me.

313
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,996
- 噢是你  - 嗯是的…
- Oh, it's you. - Oh, yes, well...

314
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,131
我一见到你 就知道你将会有麻烦…
I knew you were gonna get into trouble as soon as I met you...

315
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,675
所以我来帮你了
so I've come to give you a hand.

316
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,172
你在到处看呢 不是吗？
Oh, you're looking around now, aren't you?

317
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,080
我想你应该发现这里没有门
I suppose you noticed there ain't no doors.

318
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,084
只有那个洞口
Only the hole.

319
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,617
这是一间地牢 迷宫里到处都是
This is an oubliette. The labyrinth's full of them.

320
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,784
- 真的？你怎么知道的？  - 噢 真笨
- Really? How do you know that? - Oh, don't sound so smart.

321
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,124
- 你不知道地牢是什么  - 你知道吗？
- You don't know what an oubliette is. - Do you?

322
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,222
当然那是你把别人关起来…
Yes, it's a place you put people...

323
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,426
让他们忘记自己的地方
to forget about 'em.

324
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,130
现在你要做的 就是离开这里
Now, what you've gotta do is get out of here.

325
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,174
碰巧我知道一条捷径…
And it so happens that I know a short cut...

326
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,301
能够离开迷宫
out of the whole labyrinth from here.

327
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,572
不 我现在不打算放弃
No, I'm not giving up now.

328
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,579
我都走这么远了
I've come too far.

329
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,285
- 我很好  - 你当然很好
- No, I'm doing okay. - Of course you are.

330
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,552
但是被困在这里就不好了
But it gets a lot worse from here on in.

331
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,359
你为什么这么关心我？
Why are you so concerned about me?

332
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,330
哦 我就是这样的
Well, I am, that's all.

333
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,859
不想看到这么年轻漂亮的女孩 被困在又黑又恐怖的地牢里
Nice, young girl. Terrible, black oubliette.

334
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:49,270
你喜欢珠宝 对吗？
You like jewelry, don't you?

335
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,967
干嘛？
Why?

336
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,910
如果你帮我走出迷宫 我给你这个
If you help me solve the labyrinth, I'll give you this.

337
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,707
你很喜欢 是吗？
You like it, don't you?

338
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,877
- 一般般  - 那好
- So-so. - Oh. Okay.

339
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,520
这样吧 你把手镯给我…
Tell you what... you give me the bracelet...

340
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,525
我就带你离开迷宫
and I'll show you the way out of the labyrinth.

341
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,255
- 你一定要这么做  - 是的
- You were gonna do that anyway. - Yes.

342
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,733
这样做是对你示好的姿态
That's what would make it a particularly nice gesture on your part.

343
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,531
这样吧…
I'll tell you what...

344
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,400
如果你不带我去迷宫中心 尽量把我带近一些
if you won't take me to the center, take me as far as you can.

345
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,839
- 然后我自己走  - 这是什么做的？
- Then I'll do it on my own. - What is that anyway?

346
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,136
塑料
Plastic.

347
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,473
那么我答应你…
I don't promise nothing, but...

348
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,509
我尽量把你带近些 然后你自己走 是吗？
I'll take you as far as I can, then you're on your own, right?

349
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,748
- 是  - 那好
- Right. - Right.

350
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,059
喔 塑料的！
Wow. Plastic!

351
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,465
走吧
Here we go.

352
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,699
该死的
Damn.

353
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,206
垃圾房
Broom closet.

354
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,378
不是每一次都灵
Well, can't be right all the time.

355
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,475
对了 来吧
This is it. Come on then.

356
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,092
- 这边  - 不要往前走了- This way. - Don't go on.

357
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,462
趁你还有机会 赶快回去吧
Go back while you still can.

358
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,696
这条路不对
This is not the way.

359
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,295
当心 不要再向前了
Take heed and go no further.

360
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,707
小心 小心
Beware. Beware.

361
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:36,212
就快来不及了
Soon it will be too late.

362
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,578
唉！别理它们
Yeah! Don't pay any attention to them.

363
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:42,210
它们是假警报 在迷宫到处都可以看到
They're just false alarms. You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.

364
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,288
特别是当你走对路时
Especially when you're on the right track.

365
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,324
- 不 你走错路了  - 住口
- Oh, no, you're not. - Oh, shut up.

366
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,555
- 对不起 我只是在工作  - 没必要对我们说
- Sorry. Just doing my job. - You don't have to do it to us.

367
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,654
- 当心了  - 得了
- Beware for... - Just forget it.

368
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,394
让我说吧 我很久没说话了
Oh, please, I haven't said it for such a long time.

369
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,960
也好 不过别指望我们会有多大的反应
Oh, all right, but don't expect a big reaction.

370
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,768
不不不 当然不会
No, no, no, of course not.

371
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:07,971
你们正在走向毁灭
For the path you will take will lead to certain destruction.

372
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,980
- 太谢谢你了  - 噢
- Thank you very much. - Uh-oh.

373
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,174
噢 不好
Oh, no.

374
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,482
我们碰到什么了？
What have we here?

375
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,890
- 没什么  - 没什么？
- Nothing. - Nothing?

376
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,690
没什么？没什么？
Nothing? Nothing?

377
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,697
没什么 哇啦啦
Nothing, tra-la-la.

378
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,757
国王陛下 见到你太意外了
Your Majesty, what a nice surprise.

379
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,995
- 你好 霍特沃得  - 霍格特
- Hello, Hedgewart. - Hogwart.

380
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,503
霍格！
Hoggle!

381
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,473
霍格 你在帮助这个女孩吗？
Hoggle, can it be that you're helping this girl?

382
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,375
帮助？这是什么话？
Helping? In what sense?

383
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,912
我是说你正在带她到城堡
In the sense that you're leading her towards the castle.

384
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,245
不我在带她到入口处 国王陛下
No, I was taking her back to the beginning, Your Majesty.

385
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,750
什么？
What?

386
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:51,310
我告诉她 我会帮她走进迷宫
I told her I was going to help her solve the labyrinth.

387
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,586
我在骗她 实际上…
A little trickery on my part. But actually...

388
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,718
你手腕上的塑料是什么？
What is that plastic thing 'round your wrist?

389
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,593
噢 这个！
Oh, this!

390
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:06,394
天哪 这是哪来的？
My goodness, where did this come from?

391
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,994
- 希格…  - 霍格
- Higgle... - Hoggle.

392
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,801
如果我知道你在背叛我…
If I thought for one second that you were betraying me...

393
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:14,844
我就不得不把你倒挂在永久恶臭的沼泽上
I'd be forced to suspend you headfirst in the Bog of Eternal Stench.

394
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:19,008
不要 国王陛下！ 不要那里！
No, Your Majesty! Not the Eternal Stench!

395
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,016
怕了吗 霍格！
Oh, yes, Hoggle!

396
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:23,609
你呢 莎拉
And you, Sarah.

397
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,689
觉得我的迷宫怎样？
How are you enjoying my labyrinth?

398
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,027
小菜一碟
It's a piece of cake.

399
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,722
噢！
Oh!

400
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,128
真的？那么 把时间拨快点把？
Really? Then how about upping the stakes?

401
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,531
哼？
Hmm?

402
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,159
这不公平！
That's not fair!

403
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,330
你说很多次了
You say that so often.

404
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:45,273
我想知道你和什么比较
I wonder what your basis for comparison is.

405
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,834
迷宫是小菜一碟 是吗？
So the labyrinth's a piece of cake, is it?

406
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:51,370
那么看看你怎么对付这个小玩意
Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice.

407
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,154
噢不 是扫除机！
Oh, no, the cleaners!

408
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,159
- 什么？  - 快跑！
- What? - Run!

409
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,330
你还好吧？
You okay?

410
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:15,337
来吧！
Come on!

411
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,173
快点！
Faster!

412
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,777
扫除机！恶臭沼泽！
The cleaners! The Bog of Stench!

413
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,479
你让他认真起来了
You sure got his attention.

414
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,604
啊 这正是我们要的
Ah, this is what we need.

415
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,944
一个梯子 来吧
A ladder. Follow me.

416
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,679
你刚才想把我带回入口处 我现在如何相信你？
How can I trust you now that I know you were taking me back to the beginning?

417
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,311
我没有
I wasn't.

418
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:08,825
我告诉他我在带你回入口处 是为了分散他的注意
I told him I was taking you back to the beginning to throw him off the scent.

419
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,690
霍格，我如何相信你的话呢？
Hoggle, how can I believe anything you say?

420
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,560
好吧 这么说吧
Well, let me put it this way.

421
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,759
你还有什么选择呢？
What choice have you got?

422
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,569
那倒是
You're right.

423
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,371
看来你开始了解我的处境了
You see, you've gotta understand my position.

424
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,936
我是胆小鬼 佳拉斯吓倒我了
I'm a coward, and Jareth scares me.

425
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:34,108
- 什么样的处境？  - 没地位 我认为
- What kind of position is that? - No position. That's my point.

426
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,177
如果你闻过永久恶臭的沼泽…
You wouldn't be so brave if you'd ever smelled...

427
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,347
你就不会这么勇敢了
the Bog of Eternal Stench.

428
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,482
那是…那是…
It's... It's...

429
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,755
真的很臭吗？
Is that all it does, is smell?

430
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,162
相信我 是真的
Believe me, that's enough.

431
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,962
更糟糕的是 万一你不幸…
But the worst thing is, if you so much...

432
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,128
把脚踏进恶臭沼泽…
as put a foot in the Bog of Stench...

433
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,436
你的余生都会很臭
you'll smell bad for the rest of your life.

434
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,136
洗不掉的
It'll never wash off.

435
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:08,011
我们到了 从现在起你要靠自己了
Here we are then. You're on your own from now on.

436
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,678
- 什么？  - 到此为止 我走了
- What? - That's it. I quit.

437
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,690
等一等
Wait a minute.

438
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,688
我遵守诺言了 我说过我能带多远就多远
I didn't promise nothin'. I said I'd take you as far as I could go.

439
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,529
你这个小骗子 你无耻
You little cheat. You nasty little cheat.

440
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,537
别为难我了 我没有自尊
Don't try to embarrass me. I've got no pride.

441
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,664
真的？
Oh, yeah?

442
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,435
这是我的珠宝！
But them's my jewels!

443
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,967
还给我 还给我 把它们还给我
You give 'em back. Give them back. Give those back.

444
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,243
把它们还给我！
Give those back to me!

445
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:42,809
现在城堡就在那边 我们该走哪边呢？
Now, there's the castle. Which way should we try?

446
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,947
那是我的财产 这不公平！
Them's my rightful property. It's not fair!

447
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,515
就是不公平的
No, it isn't.

448
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,960
事实就是这样
But that's the way it is.

449
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:04,039
不好意思 你能帮帮我吗？
Excuse me, please, but can you help me?

450
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,302
噢 小女孩！
Oh, a young girl!

451
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,412
他是谁？
And who is this?

452
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:15,284
- 我朋友  - 是啊
- My friend. - Oh, yes.

453
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,843
有什么能帮你？
And what can I do for you?

454
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,014
麻烦你告诉我… 就是…
Please, can you tell... That is...

455
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,615
我要去迷宫中央的城堡
I have to get to the castle at the center of the labyrinth.

456
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,661
你知道该怎么走吗？
Do you know the way?

457
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,923
那么
Well, yes, now.

458
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,661
你想要去城堡
You want to get to the castle.

459
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,033
脑筋不是很好啊？
How's that for brain power, huh?

460
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:35,401
安静！
Be quiet!

461
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,236
啊 生气了
Ah, nuts.

462
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,368
那么 小姐…
So, young woman...

463
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,812
向前的路有时是往回的
the way forward is sometimes the way back.

464
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,615
你会听这个废物的话吗！
Will you listen to this crap!

465
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,850
- 你静一点好吗！  - 好 对不起
- Will you please be quiet! - Sorry. All right.

466
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,049
- 好吗  - 好！
- Okay. - Okay!

467
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,183
- 好吗  - 好！
- All right. - All right!

468
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,193
- 什么？  - 对不起
- What? - Sorry.

469
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,664
说完了吗？
Finished?

470
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,299
是
Yes.

471
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,132
小姐 很多时候…
Quite often, young lady...

472
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:12,608
看起来我们哪里也去不了 但是事实上…
it seems like we're not getting anywhere, when in fact...

473
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,043
- 我们确实在前进  - 是的
- We are. - We are.

474
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,412
我现在当然哪儿也去不了
I'm certainly not getting anywhere at the moment.

475
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,711
加入俱乐部吧
Join the club.

476
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,683
我想这是你的命运
I think that's your lot.

477
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,989
请在这个小盒子里 捐献点什么吧
Please leave a contribution in the little box.

478
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,055
你敢！那是我的
Don't you dare! Them's mine.

479
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,662
我想我可以捐出这个
Well, I guess I can spare this.

480
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,937
你没有必要把那个给他
Oh, you didn't have to give him that.

481
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,949
他告诉你一些事情了
He didn't tell you nothin'.

482
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,180
好了 两个蠢材上当了
Well, then. There go a couple of suckers.

483
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,615
啊 当你的帽子真刺激
Ah, it's so stimulating being your hat.

484
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,922
为什么…为什么你那么说…
Why... Why did you say that...

485
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,123
说我是你的朋友？
about my being your friend?

486
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:09,688
因为你就是我的朋友
Because you are.

487
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,861
你可能不是我真正的朋友 但在这里你是我唯一的朋友
You may not be much of a friend, but you're the only one I've got here.

488
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,635
你听到什么吗？
Do you hear something?

489
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,175
- 没有 一切正常  - 朋友
- No, it's all right. - Friend.

490
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,873
我喜欢这样
I like that.

491
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,781
以前我从来没有朋友
I ain't never been no one's friend before.

492
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,084
- 再见！  - 等一等
- Good-bye! - Wait a minute.

493
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,155
- 留着我的东西  - 你是不是我的朋友？
- Keep the stuff. - Are you my friend or not?

494
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:34,622
不 我不是 霍格没有朋友
No, I'm not. Hoggle ain't no one's friend.

495
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,684
他照顾他自己 跟其他人一样
He looks after himself, like everyone.

496
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,492
霍格的朋友就是他自己
Hoggle is Hoggle's friend.

497
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,089
霍格 你这个胆小鬼！
Hoggle, you coward!

498
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,903
我才不怕
Well, I'm not afraid.

499
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,338
在这里经常眼见不为实
Things aren't always what they seem in this place.

500
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,811
试试这个吧 大雪人！
Try on this for size, you big yeti!

501
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,512
我们抓到你了 怪物！
We've got you now, fuzz ball!

502
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,219
一起来吧
All together now.

503
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,297
要是我有东西 扔过去就好了
If only I had something to throw.

504
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,532
咬他！咬他！
Sock it to him! Sock it to him!

505
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,944
怎么回事？谁关灯？ 我看不见！
What happened? Who turned out the light? I can't see!

506
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,747
- 你干嘛咬我？  - 谁咬谁？
- Why'd you bite me? - Who bite who?

507
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,155
谁咬我？谁咬我？
Who bite me? Who bite me?

508
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,258
- 我看不见！  - 发生什么事？
- I can't see! - What is going on?

509
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,101
撤退！
Retreat!

510
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,198
谁咬我？
Who bit me?

511
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,707
噢 我心爱的生鱼片！
Oh, my aching sushi!

512
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,188
停止
Now, stop that.

513
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,052
你就这样对待救你的人的吗？
Is that any way to treat someone who's trying to help you?

514
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,096
你要我放你下来吗？
Don't you want me to help you down?

515
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:27,994
放下鲁德
Ludo down.

516
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,471
鲁德？
Ludo?

517
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:31,733
是你的名字吗？
Is that your name?

518
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,206
你是一头可爱的野兽
You seem like such a nice beast.

519
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,508
我真的希望你跟你的外表一样友好
Well, I certainly hope you are what you seem to be.

520
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,319
坚持一下 我放你下来
Just hang on. I'll get you down.

521
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,593
就好了
Just a second.

522
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,489
对不起！
I'm sorry!

523
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,131
鲁德 你受伤了吗？
Ludo, are you hurt?

524
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,035
朋友？
Friend?

525
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,635
是的 鲁德
That's right, Ludo.

526
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,146
我是莎拉
I'm Sarah.

527
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,982
莎拉
Sarah.

528
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,280
起来吧 我帮你
Here, let me help you.

529
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,289
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

530
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:29,355
莎拉是朋友
Sarah friend.

531
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,890
等一等
Now, wait. Just a second.

532
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:35,735
- 我想问你一些东西 鲁德  - 什么？
- I want to ask you something, Ludo. - What?

533
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:39,401
我得去迷宫中心的城堡 你知道怎么去吗？
I have to get to the castle at the labyrinth's center. Do you know the way?

534
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,580
- 不知道  - 你也不知道啊？
- No. - You don't know either, huh?

535
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:52,211
有人知道如何走出迷宫就好了
I wonder if anyone knows how to get through this labyrinth.

536
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,417
走出迷宫 走出迷宫
Get through the labyrinth. Get through the labyrinth.

537
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:01,396
可以肯定… 她永远也走不出迷宫
One thing for sure... she'll never get through the labyrinth.

538
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,301
喂
Hey.

539
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,701
它们从哪来？
Where did they come from?

540
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,306
你说呢？
What do you think?

541
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,041
两个丑面孔我们挑哪个呢？
Which shall we choose out of these two ugly characters?

542
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,078
盯着人看是不礼貌的！
It's very rude to stare!

543
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,990
对不起我只是在想 该挑哪一扇门而已
I'm sorry. I was just wondering which door to choose.

544
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,255
- 什么？  - 问他没用
- What? - It's no good asking him.

545
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,559
- 他是彻底聋了  - 不要含着东西说话
- He's as deaf as a post. - Don't talk with your mouth full.

546
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,156
- 我没有含着东西说话！  - 等一等
- I'm not talking with my mouth full! - Wait a second.

547
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,361
- 我听不懂你的话  - 你说什么了？
- I can't understand you. - What were you saying?

548
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,442
- 把那个东西拿掉真好啊  - 你刚才说什么？
- It is so good to get that thing out. - What were you saying?

549
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,605
我说问他没用 他是完全聋了
I said, it's no good talking to him. He's as deaf as a post.

550
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:55,550
咕哝咕哝 你真是一个健谈的同事
Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful conversational companion.

551
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,884
你会说！你在呻吟而已！
You can talk! All you do is moan!

552
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,150
没用 我听不见
No good. Can't hear you.

553
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,960
- 这些门通向哪里？  - 什么？
- Where do these doors lead? - What?

554
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,794
我可不知道 我们只是门环而已
Search me. We're just the knockers.

555
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,004
- 我怎么过去？  - 啊？
- How do I get through? - Huh?

556
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,473
敲门门就会开
Knock, and the door will open.

557
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,409
我不想再含着这个东西
I don't want that thing back in my mouth.

558
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,920
- 好吧 我要敲门  - 嗯
- Come on. I want to knock. - Mm-mmm.

559
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,719
他不想再含着那个东西 是吗？
Doesn't want his ring back in his mouth, eh?

560
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,191
我可没有责备他
Can't say I blame him.

561
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,708
- 对不起  - 没什么 我习惯了
- Sorry. - That's all right. I'm used to it.

562
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,683
来吧
Come on.

563
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,536
欢迎
You're welcome.

564
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,849
他是一个活泼的小家伙 我想我要叫他佳拉斯
He's a lively little chap. I think I'll call him Jareth.

565
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,686
我注意他好久了
He's got my eyes.

566
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,707
鲁德害怕
Ludo scared.

567
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,505
喔 把手给我吧
Aw, give me your hand.

568
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,239
来吧
Come on.

569
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:05,975
你这么大块还怕啊
Imagine a big thing like you being scared.

570
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,482
是的
Yeah.

571
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,919
看啊 鲁德？ 没什么好害怕的
See, Ludo? There's nothing to be afraid of.

572
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,039
鲁德 你在哪里？
Ludo, where are you?

573
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,209
霍格 救命啊！
Hoggle, help!

574
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:45,516
- 我来了 莎拉  - 幸亏有你啊
- I'm comin', Sarah. - Well, if it isn't you.

575
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,216
你去哪里？
And where are you going?

576
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,326
那个小女孩让我摔倒了…
Well, the little lady gave me the slip...

577
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,091
但是现在我听到她在叫我…
but I just hears her now...

578
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:58,396
所以我打算把她带回入口处…
so I was about to lead her back to the beginning...

579
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,561
按照你的要求
like you told me.

580
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,867
- 我明白了  - 鲁德！
- I see. - Ludo!

581
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,772
我还以为你要回去帮她呢
For one moment I thought you were running to help her.

582
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:09,505
但在我警告你 以后就不认为了
But no, not after my warnings.

583
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:12,844
- 那是愚蠢的  - 你说对了！
- That would be stupid. - Oh, you bet it would!

584
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,544
在你警告之后我还帮她？
Me help her after your warnings?

585
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,957
- 噢 可怜的赫格特  - 霍格
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead. - Hoggle.

586
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,463
我刚刚发现 你可爱的珠宝不见了
I've just noticed your lovely jewels are missing.

587
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,897
噢 真的不见了
Oh, yes, so they are.

588
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,959
我可爱的珠宝 让我想一想
My lovely jewels. Let me think.

589
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,131
我去找 但我先要把那个小女孩带到…
I better find 'em, but first I'm off to take the little lady...

590
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,199
迷宫的入口处 就像我们计划的那样
back to the beginning of the labyrinth, just like we planned.

591
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,972
等等
Wait.

592
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,070
我有个更好的计划
I've got a much better plan.

593
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,810
拿给她
Give her this.

594
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,277
这是…什么？
Wha... What is it?

595
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,913
礼物
It's a present.

596
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,288
它不会伤害小女孩 是吗？
It ain't gonna hurt the little lady, is it?

597
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,054
干嘛这么担心？
Why the concern?

598
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,997
- 我不想伤害她  - 噢 霍格布林
- I won't do nothin' to harm her. - Oh, come, come, Hogbrain.

599
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,568
我很惊讶你被她迷惑了
I'm surprised at you losing your head over a girl.

600
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,535
我没有
I ain't lost my head.

601
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,936
你没有想到一个小女孩会…
You don't think a young girl could ever like...

602
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:13,703
喜欢你这样的无赖 不是吗？
a repulsive little scab like you, do you?

603
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,801
她说我们是…
She said we was...

604
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,107
知心朋友？
Bosom companions?

605
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,807
朋友？
Friends?

606
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,243
- 无所谓  - 你要把那个给她…
- Don't matter. - You'll give her that...

607
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,448
不然我就把你扔进永久恶臭的沼泽…
or I'll tip you straight into the Bog of Eternal Stench...

608
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,457
让你眨眼都来不及
before you can blink.

609
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,083
遵命
Yes. Right.

还有霍格…
And Hoggle...

611
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,528
如果她亲你 我就把你变成王子
if she ever kisses you, I'll turn you into a prince.

612
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,602
你…你会吗？
You... You will?

613
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,035
恶臭沼泽的王子
Prince of the Land of Stench.

614
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:49,843

00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:05,014
- 你们想干嘛？  - 什么我们？
- What do you want? - What, us?

618
00:51:06,885 --> 00:51:09,445

- She's right. It's stuck on. - Hey, lady.

630

it's against the rules to throw other people's heads.

639
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,690

645
00:54:15,106 --> 00:54:17,131
你不能退出游戏 还没结束
You can't quit. The game's not over.

646
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:20,376
- 喂 女孩！  - 走开！

- Don't you want to look like us? - Leave me alone.

650
00:54:32,724 --> 00:54:34,715
抓住她！抓住她！
We want her! Get us all!

651
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,694
如果你玩 我们会把你的胳膊拿掉！
If you play, we'll take off your arms!

652
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:41,755
- 或者拿掉你的耳朵  - 你不需要两只耳朵
- Or we'll take off your ear. - You don't need two ears.

653
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,131
- 游戏快结束了  - 时间到
- Game's almost over. - Time's up.

654
00:54:45,236 --> 00:54:48,569
- 走开  - 霍格 你来救我了
- Go away. - Hoggle, you've come to help me.

655

别亲我！别亲我！
Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!

656
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:57,303
不 不 不要！
No, no, no!

657
00:55:03,455 --> 00:55:05,946
霍格 小心
Hoggle, hold on.

658
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:10,890
噢 我的天
Oh, my God.

659
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:18,766
噢 这是什么？
Oh, what is it?

660
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:21,772
永久恶臭的沼泽！
The Bog of Eternal Stench!

661
00:55:25,076 --> 00:55:27,544
我从未闻过这种东西 好像…
I never smelled anything like it. It's like...

662
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:36,843
别管它像什么 它是永久恶臭的沼泽
It doesn't matter what it's like. It's a Bog of Eternal Stench.

663
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:38,354
救我！
Help!

664

坚持住
Hold on.

665
00:55:45,664 --> 00:55:48,997
你为什么要这么做？
What did you have to go and do a thing like that for?

666
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:50,159
做什么？
Do what?

667
00:55:53,004 --> 00:55:56,064
- 你是说我救你吗？  - 什么？不是
- You mean rescue you? - What? No.

668
00:55:56,174 --> 00:55:58,267
你亲我了
You kissed me.

669
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:06,748
噢 糟糕
Oh, my gosh.

670
00:56:06,818 --> 00:56:09,787
别装模做样了
Don't pretend to be so hard.

671
00:56:09,821 --> 00:56:13,689
我知道你是回来救我 我知道你是我朋友
I know you came back to help me, and I know that you're my friend.

672
00:56:13,725 --> 00:56:15,556

679
00:56:37,048 --> 00:56:38,845
霍格到哪去了？
Where's Hoggle?

680
00:56:41,152 --> 00:56:43,120
别压着我！
Get off of me!

681
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:45,721
在这里
Here.

682
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,221
没事 这是鲁德 它也是我的朋友
Oh, no, it's okay. This is Ludo. He's a friend too.

683
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,592
什么？
A what?

684
00:56:53,665 --> 00:56:55,428
臭！
Smell!

685
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:56,898
你说得对
You're right.

686
00:57:00,038 --> 00:57:02,472
天哪
Oh, my God.

687
00:57:05,543 --> 00:57:06,976
有座桥
There's a bridge.

688
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:08,876
来吧
Come on.

689
00:57:13,852 --> 00:57:14,944
小心
Watch it.

690
00:57:15,053 --> 00:57:18,716
踩到这些东西 你就永远都会臭
You step in this stuff and you'll stink forever.

691
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:22,051
停！
Stop!

692
00:57:23,294 --> 00:57:26,263
- 我说停  - 麻烦你让我们过去吧
- Stop, I say. - Please, we have to get across.

693
00:57:26,364 --> 00:57:28,559
没有我的允许 谁都别想过去
Without my permission, no one may cross.

694
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:31,692
我们没多少时间了！
Please, I only have a little time left!

695
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,965
我们必须走过这个沼泽
We've gotta get out of this stench.

696
00:57:34,072 --> 00:57:36,199
很臭
Smell bad.

697
00:57:36,274 --> 00:57:39,072
- 臭？你说什么臭？  - 这里很臭

698
00:57:40,879 --> 00:57:43,541
- 我什么都闻不到  - 你开玩笑吧
- I smell nothing. - Oh, you're joking.

699
00:57:43,615 --> 00:57:46,379
我靠嗅觉生存的
But I live by my sense of smell.

700
00:57:48,987 --> 00:57:53,048
空气又香又甜 没有我的允许谁都不能过去！
The air is sweet and fragrant, and none may pass without my permission!

701
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:56,093
很臭
Smell bad.

702
00:57:56,194 --> 00:57:58,594
走开！
Oh, get out of my way!

00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,599
我警告你 我发誓要尽忠职守！
I warn thee, I'm sworn to do my duty!

704
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:05,496
- 求求你让我们过去吧  - 别动！
- Come on. Let us get across. - Hold!

705
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:12,476
听着我不想伤害你们
Listen, I don't want to have to hurt you.

706
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:14,171
你要干嘛？
What are you doing?

707
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:16,713
放开我的武器！
Let go of my staff, sir!

708
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:27,116
那好 让我来征服这座山
All right then. I can conquer this mountain.

709
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,105
你必须干得更好才行
Thou must do better than that.

710
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,445
投降了？啊？
Give up? Huh?

711
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,994
够了！
Enough!

712
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,703
以前 我打架未缝敌手
Before this day, never have I met my match in battle.

713
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:19,368
这个高贵的武士 让我透不过气
Yet this noble knight has fought me to a standstill.

714
00:59:19,477 --> 00:59:23,004
- 你没事吧 鲁德？  - 臭！
- Are you all right, Ludo? - Smell!

715
00:59:23,081 --> 00:59:27,211
原来你叫鲁德 我是迪迪莫斯 我服输了
Sir Ludo, if that's thy name, now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.

716
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:30,220
来 让我们从此做兄弟吧…
Come, let us be brothers henceforth...

717
00:59:30,288 --> 00:59:32,916
为正义共同作战！

- 很高兴认识你 鲁德  - 太好了 来吧
- Well met, Sir Ludo. - Good. Come on.

721
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:46,826
等等！你忘了我的誓言 小姐
Wait a minute! You forget my sacred vow, my lady.

722
00:59:46,905 --> 00:59:50,705
- 我不能让你过去  - 但是你说鲁德是你的兄弟
- I cannot let you pass. - But you said Ludo is your brother.

723
00:59:50,808 --> 00:59:54,209
我曾立誓 要誓死捍卫它
I have taken an oath, and I must defend it to the death.

724
00:59:54,312 --> 00:59:57,008
- 很臭！  - 那好
- The smell! - Okay.

725
00:59:57,115 --> 01:00:00,573
我们冷静下来想想 你到底发了什么誓？
Let's handle this thing logically. What exactly have you sworn?

726
01:00:00,652 --> 01:00:04,748
我以血发誓 如果没有我的允许…
I have sworn with my lifeblood no one shall pass this way...

727
01:00:04,822 --> 01:00:07,086
任何人都不准过桥
without my permission.

728
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,593
那么我们可以得到你的允许吗？
Well, may we have your permission?

729
01:00:13,765 --> 01:00:15,198

- 好吧  - 谢谢你 你太好了
- Yes. - Thank you, noble sir.

731
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:27,642
不用谢
My lady.

732
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:34,251
- 噢  - 不要怕 小姐
- Uh-oh. - Have no fear, sweet lady.

733
01:00:34,352 --> 01:00:36,650
这座桥有一千年历史了
This bridge has lasted for a thousand years.

734
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:49,290
- 看来还很坚固  - 霍格！
- It seemed solid enough. - Hoggle!

735
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:56,233
不用怕 可爱的小姐 我来救你
Fear not, fair maiden. I will save thee.

736
01:00:56,307 --> 01:00:57,331
怎么回事
Somehow.

737
01:00:59,477 --> 01:01:03,538
鲁德 你不去救人 反而在这里大声吼叫？
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl when yon maiden needs our help?

738
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:36,241
- 太不可思议了 鲁德  - 兄弟！
- That's incredible, Ludo. - My brother!

739
01:01:36,314 --> 01:01:38,612
你能聚集石头？
Canst thou summon up the very rocks?

740
01:01:38,716 --> 01:01:42,777
当然石头是朋友
Sure. Rocks friends.

741
01:01:47,925 --> 01:01:50,519
- 上来吧  - 谢谢你 霍格

<i>I wouldn't do that, if I were you.</i>

752
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:50,743
不要逼我 我不能拿给她
Oh, please, I can't give it to her.

Look, Sarah, is this what you're trying to find?

So much trouble over such a little thing, but not for long.

756

她很快会忘记你 我的宝贝
She'll soon forget all about you, my fine fellow.

757
01:03:19,217 --> 01:03:22,345
只要霍格把我的礼物给她…
Just as soon as Hoggle gives her my present...

758
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:25,617
她就会忘掉所有的东西
then she'll forget everything.

759
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:30,226
是我的肚子还是你的 安伯希斯？
Is that my stomach or yours, Ambrosious?

饿了
Hungry.

761
01:03:34,132 --> 01:03:38,535
是啊 但我们不能停下

或许我们能找到野果吃
Maybe we can find some berries or something.

763

味道很奇怪
This tastes strange.

768
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:15,467
你放了什么？
What have you done?

769

一切都在跳动
Everything's dancing.

772

I'm not asking to be forgiven. I ain't ashamed of nothin' I did.

Steady, men.

958

停 不要动
Steady, men. Hold your ground.

959
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:54,500
当我没说 逃命吧！
Okay, I take it back. Run for your lives!

960
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:57,774
我受够了！我要睡觉
I've had enough! I'm going to bed.

出去！

962

开火！
Fire!

966
01:25:39,055 --> 01:25:41,148
喂 我开火了
Hey, I just fired you.

967
01:25:41,257 --> 01:25:43,054
唉唷 哎唷 哎唷！
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

968

这边
This way.

969
01:25:51,801 --> 01:25:52,893
我们抓到你们了！
Now we have you!

970
01:25:55,104 --> 01:25:56,537
现在抓不到了
And now you don't.

971
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:16,117

Steady, boy.

976
01:26:44,254 --> 01:26:47,553

好 走吧
Good boy. Come on.

981
01:26:58,535 --> 01:27:01,698
- 他只有这条路走了  - 那么 走吧
- That's the only way he could have gone. - Well, then, come on.

982
01:27:01,771 --> 01:27:05,229
- 我必须自己去找他  - 为什么？
- I have to face him alone. - But why?

983
01:27:05,275 --> 01:27:07,402
因为开始时就是这样
Because that's the way it's done.

984
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:10,037
好吧 如果开始是这样…
Well, if that is the way it is done...

985
01:27:10,146 --> 01:27:12,376
你就必须这样去做
then that is the way you must do it.

986
01:27:12,448 --> 01:27:15,246
但是如果你需要帮忙…
But should you need us...

987

莎拉 小心了
Sarah, beware.

994
01:31:01,177 --> 01:31:05,409
直到现在我都很仁慈 我也可以残忍
I have been generous up until now, and I can be cruel.

995
01:31:05,481 --> 01:31:06,914
仁慈？
Generous?

996
01:31:09,118 --> 01:31:12,451
- 你做了什么叫仁慈？  - 一切！

你要的一切我都做了
Everything that you have wanted, I have done.

998
01:31:15,525 --> 01:31:19,484
你要我把小孩带走 我做了
You asked that the child be taken. I took him.

999
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:22,828
你在我面前退缩 我很可怕
You cowered before me. I was frightening.

1000
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:25,265
我重新定了时间
I have reordered time.

1001
01:31:25,334 --> 01:31:28,064
我把世界倒转…
I have turned the world upside-down...

1002
01:31:28,137 --> 01:31:30,731
这一切都是为了你
and I have done it all for you.

1003
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:36,334
为了满足你 我身心疲倦
I am exhausted from living up to your expectations of me.

1004
01:31:36,412 --> 01:31:37,606
这还不算仁慈吗？
Isn't that generous?

1005
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:44,415
经历数之不尽的艰难险阻…
Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered...

1006
01:31:45,922 --> 01:31:49,756
我终于到了城堡 在格布林鬼城那里
I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the Goblin City.

1007
01:31:52,461 --> 01:31:54,429
因为我的毅力同你一样坚韧…
For my will is as strong as yours...

1008
01:31:55,665 --> 01:31:58,691
- 我的…  - 停止 等一等
- and my... - Stop. Wait.

1009
01:31:58,768 --> 01:32:00,395
看 莎拉
Look, Sarah.

1010
01:32:00,469 --> 01:32:04,166

Your dreams.

1012
01:32:07,944 --> 01:32:10,504
我的国度一样的伟大…
And my kingdom as great...

1013
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:13,413
我只有小小的要求
I ask for so little.

1014
01:32:13,482 --> 01:32:16,007
让我控制你…
Just let me rule you...

1015
01:32:16,085 --> 01:32:19,543
你就能得到你想要的一切
and you can have everything that you want.

1016
01:32:22,258 --> 01:32:25,750
国度一样的伟大？
Kingdom as great?

1017
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:27,159
该死的
Damn.

1018
01:32:27,263 --> 01:32:29,493
我怎么也记不住这一行
I can never remember that line.

1019
01:32:29,565 --> 01:32:33,365
只要你敬畏我 爱我 听我的话…
Just fear me, love me, do as I say...

1020
01:32:33,469 --> 01:32:35,869
我可以成为你的奴隶
and I will be your slave.

1021
01:32:36,873 --> 01:32:40,969
我的国度一样的伟大… 我的国度一样的伟大…
My kingdom as great... My kingdom as great...

1022
01:32:47,683 --> 01:32:50,151
你的法力并不强过我
You have no power over me.

1023
01:32:51,988 --> 01:32:54,957
你的法力并不强过我
You have no power over me.

1024
01:33:38,768 --> 01:33:40,201
托比
Toby.

1025
01:34:15,571 --> 01:34:18,369
给你
Here you are.

1026
01:34:18,474 --> 01:34:21,409
我现在把兰斯洛特送给你
I'd like Lancelot to belong to you now.

1027
01:34:44,834 --> 01:34:46,267
我们回来了
We're home.

1028
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:55,101
莎拉 你在家吗？
Sarah, are you home?

1029
