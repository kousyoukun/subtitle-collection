8
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,945
把孩子給我
Give me the child.

9
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,511
經歷數之不盡的 艱難限阻…
Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered...

10
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,181
我終於到了城堡 在格布林鬼城那裡…
I have fought my way to the castle beyond the Goblin City...

11
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,284
找回了被你偷走的小孩
to take back the child that you have stolen.

12
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,523
因為我的毅力 同你一樣堅韌…
For my will is as strong as yours...

13
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,124
而且我的國度一樣的偉大…
and my kingdom is as great...

14
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:32,005
因為我的毅力同你一樣堅韌 我的國度一樣的偉大…
For my will is as strong as yours, my kingdom as great...

15
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,376
該死
Damn.

16
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,974
噢 我怎麼也記不住這一行
Oh, I can never remember that line.

17
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,718
你的法力並不強過我
"You have no power over me."

18
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,118
噢 墨林
Oh, Merlin.

19
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,391
噢不 墨林 難以置信已經7點了！
Oh, no, Merlin. I don't believe it. It's 7:00!

20
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,768
快點快點
Come on. Come on!

21
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,214
噢那可不是個神話
Oh, it's not fair!

22
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,647
噢真的
Oh, really.

23
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,250
- 對不起  - 別站在雨裡快進來
- I'm sorry. - Don't stand in the rain. Come on.

24
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,421
好快進去墨林
All right. Come on, Merlin.

25
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,464
- 快點  - 狗不行
- Come on. - Not the dog.

26
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,762
- 但下著這麼大雨  - 別廢話讓它去車庫
- But it's pouring. - Go on, into the garage.

27
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,934
去吧墨林去車庫去
Go on, Merlin. Go into the garage.

28
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,438
去
Go.

29
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,346
- 莎拉你遲了一個小時了  - 我說了對不起了
- Sarah, you're an hour late. - I said I was sorry!

30
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,381
請讓我說完
Please let me finish.

31
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,441
- 你爸爸和我很少出去  - 你每一個週末都出去玩
- Your father and I go out rarely. - You go out every single weekend.

32
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:22,511
我只是讓你代看一下你弟弟 這對你做的事又沒有什麼影響
I ask you to baby-sit only if it won't interfere with your plans.

33
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,320
你根本不知道我打算做什麼 你根本不曾問過我
You don't know what my plans are. You don't even ask me anymore.

34
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,624
我猜你會跟我說你有個約會 如果你有約會我會很高興
I assume you'd tell me you had a date. I'd like it if you had a date.

35
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,757
- 在你這年紀你應該約會  - 莎拉你回來拉
- You should have dates at your age. - Sarah, you're home.

36
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,428
- 我們正擔心你呢  - 我就不能做什麼好事是嗎？
- We were worried about you. - I can't do anything right, can I?

37
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,204
她待我就像個 神話裡的可惡的後母
She treats me like a wicked stepmother in a fairy story no matter what I say.

38
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,765
我會跟她談談
I'll talk to her.

39
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,195
經歷了未知的危險…
Through dangers untold...

40
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,624
和數不盡的艱辛…
and hardships unnumbered...

41
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,365
我終於到了這裡 這個城堡…
I have fought my way here to the castle...

42
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,464
在格布林鬼城那裡…
beyond the Goblin City...

43
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,309
找回了小孩…
to take back the child...

44
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,143
你偷走的那個小孩
that you have stolen.

45
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,719
- 我能跟你談談嗎？  - 沒什麼好談的
- Can I talk to you? - There's nothing to talk about!

46
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,382
快點你們要遲到了
Hurry. You're gonna be late.

47
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,925
聽著我們餵過了托比 已經把他放到床上了
Listen, we fed Toby and put him to bed.

48
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,053
我們現在得離開了 我們會在半夜裡回來
We do have to leave now, but we'll be back around midnight.

49
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,493
你真的想同我談談是嗎？
You really wanted to talk to me, didn't you?

50
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,331
還是把門關上吧
Practically broke down the door.

51
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,328
蘭斯洛特
Lancelot!

52
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,569
有人又到過我的屋 碰過我的東西
Someone has been in my room again.

53
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,579
討厭討厭！
I hate that. I hate it!

54
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,584
我恨你我恨你
I hate you. I hate you!

55
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:04,254
幫幫我  把我從這個該死的地方帶走
Someone save me, take me away from this awful place!

56
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,461
想要什麼？ 你想聽故事嗎？
What do you want? You want a story, huh?

57
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,965
好吧
Okay.

58
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,669
從前有一個 漂亮的小女孩…
Once upon a time there was a beautiful, young girl...

59
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,902
她的繼母總是讓她留在家裡看孩子
whose stepmother always made her stay home with the baby.

60
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,377
這個小孩被寵壞了 什麼都想要…
The baby was a spoiled child and wanted everything for himself...

61
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,381
而這個小女孩簡直就是個奴隸
and the young girl was practically a slave.

62
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,484
但是沒人知道…
But what no one knew...

63
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,680
格布林鬼城的國王愛上了這個女孩…
was that the king of the goblins had fallen in love with the girl...

64
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,280
並且給了她一些魔力
and he had given her certain powers.

65
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,858
這樣一天晚上…
So one night...

66
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,384
當這個小孩虐待她的時候…
when the baby had been particularly cruel to her...

67
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:46,091
她召喚了妖精來幫她
she called on the goblins for help.

68
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,191
聽著
Listen.

69
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,606
「快說那些話」妖精們說
"Say your right words," the goblins said.

70
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,401
「我們會把孩子帶到格布林鬼城…
"And we'll take the baby to the Goblin City...

71
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,175
你就自由了」
and you will be free. "

72
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,414
但是女孩知道 格布林鬼城的國王…
But the girl knew that the king of the goblins...

73
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:11,082
會永遠永遠把孩子留在城堡裡…
would keep the baby in his castle forever and ever and ever...

74
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,682
並且把他變成個妖精
and turn it into a goblin.

75
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,728
因此女孩被默默地折磨著…
So the girl suffered in silence...

76
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,788
直到一天晚上 當她經受一整天的家務活的勞累…
until one night, when she was tired from a day of housework...

77
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,632
之後又被後母的尖刻的言語所傷…
and she was hurt by the harsh words of her stepmother...

78
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,932
她再也不能忍受了
and she could no longer stand it...

79
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,573
噢 好吧
Oh, all right!

80
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,908
別鬧了 來吧
Knock it off. Come on.

81
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,177
住口
Stop it!

82
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,185
我會這樣說
I'll say the words.

83
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,416
不 我不會 我不會這麼說
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.

84
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,789
我希望…
I wish...

85
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,918
我希望…
I wish.

86
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,258
- 她就要說了  - 說什麼？
- She's going to say it. - Say what?

87
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,627
- 閉嘴  - 對不起
- Shut up. - Sorry.

88
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,667
你們閉嘴
You shut up.

89
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,499
聽著她就要說了
Listen. She's going to say the words.

90
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,062
我都等不及了
I can bear it no longer!

91
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:04,075
格布林鬼城的國王 格布林鬼城的國王 無論你在哪裡…
Goblin King, Goblin King, wherever you may be...

92
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,637
把我的這個孩子帶走吧 離我遠遠的
take this child of mine far away from me!

93
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,374
- 不  - 不是這個
- No! - That's not it.

94
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,977
她從哪裡學來的這些垃圾？ 根本不是以「我希望」開頭的
Where'd she learn that rubbish? It doesn't even start with "I wish."

95
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,815
托比別哭了
Toby, stop it!

96
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,861
我希望我知道該說什麼 才能讓妖精把你捉去
I wish I did know what to say to make the goblins take you away.

97
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,730
我希望妖精們會來 現在就把你捉走
"I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now."

98
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,736
這不難是嗎？
That's not hard, is it?

99
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,938
我希望
I wish...

100
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,600
我希望
I wish...

101
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,611
- 她說了嗎？  - 閉嘴
- Did she say it? - Shut up!

102
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,522
我希望妖精們來把你帶走
I wish the goblins would come and take you away.

103
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,062
就現在
Right now.

104
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,556
托比？
Toby?

105
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,088
托比你還好嗎？
Toby, are you all right?

106
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,970
為什麼你不哭了？
Why aren't you crying?

107
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,693
你是他是嗎？你是格布林鬼城的國王
You're him, aren't you? You're the goblin king.

108
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,665
請把我的弟弟還給我 如果真是那樣
I want my brother back, please, if it's all the same.

109
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,065
說過的話就是說了
What's said is said.

110
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,137
可是我不是那個意思
But I didn't mean it.

111
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,297
- 噢 你不是那個意思  - 求求你
- Oh, you didn't. - Please.

112
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,704
他在哪裡？
Where is he?

113
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,403
你很清楚他在哪裡
You know very well where he is.

114
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,412
請把他還給我
Please bring him back. Please.

115
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,572
莎拉…
Sarah...

116
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,776
回到你的房間裡去…
go back to your room...

117
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,447
玩你的玩具 擺弄你的衣服
play with your toys and your costumes.

118
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,491
忘了孩子
Forget about the baby.

119
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,091
我不能
I can't.

120
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,788
我給你帶了個禮物
I've brought you a gift.

121
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,890
- 是什麼？  - 是個水晶球
- What is it? - It's a crystal.

122
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,161
沒什麼特別
Nothing more.

123
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,499
但如果你這樣…
But if you turn it this way...

124
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,196
看裡面
Iook into it.

125
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,638
它會顯現出你的夢
It will show you your dreams.

126
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,802
這可不是給普通女孩的禮物…
But this is not a gift for an ordinary girl...

127
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,813
誰會在意一個哭鬧的小孩
who takes care of a screaming baby.

128
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,011
想要它嗎？
Do you want it?

129
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,180
那就忘了孩子吧
Then forget the baby.

130
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,949
我不能
I can't.

131
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:18,088
我感謝您為我做的這些 但是我想要回我的弟弟
I appreciate what you're trying to do for me, but I want my brother back.

132
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,132
- 他一定很害怕  - 莎拉
- He must be so scared. - Sarah.

133
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,841
別拒絕我
Don't defy me.

134
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,714
你可不能跟我鬥
You're no match for me.

135
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,881
但我得要回我的弟弟
But I have to have my brother back.

136
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,092
他在那裡在我的城堡裡
He's there, in my castle.

137
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,767
你還想去找他嗎？
Do you still want to look for him?

138
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,768
就是在格布林 鬼城那個城堡嗎？
Is that the castle beyond the Goblin City?

139
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,971
回去吧莎拉 回去否則就太遲了
Turn back, Sarah. Turn back before it's too late.

140
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,910
我不能
I can't.

141
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,007
你還不明白我說的嗎？
Don't you understand that I can't?

142
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,676
真可惜
What a pity.

143
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,952
它看起來並不那麼遠
It doesn't look that far.

144
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,253
比你想像的遠時間很短
It's further than you think. Time is short.

145
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,228
你有13個小時來穿過迷宮…
You have 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth...

146
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,462
要趕在你的小弟弟…
before your baby brother...

147
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,595
成為我們中的一員之前…
becomes one of us...

148
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,104
永遠地
forever.

149
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,142
真可惜
<i>Such a pity.</i>

150
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,705
迷宮
The labyrinth.

151
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,076
看起來並不那麼難
It doesn't look that hard.

152
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,046
好吧走吧
Well, come on, feet.

153
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,442
- 打擾了？  - 噢 打擾了
- Excuse me? - Oh, excuse me!

154
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,879
噢 是你
Oh, it's you.

155
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,181
打擾了 我必須得穿過這個迷宮 你能幫我嗎？
Excuse me, but I have to get through this labyrinth. Can you help me?

156
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,888
噢 多可愛啊
Oh, how sweet.

157
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,953
五十七
Fifty-seven!

158
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,557
- 你怎麼能？  - 是的
- How could you? - Yeah.

159
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,759
可憐的小東西
Poor thing.

160
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,471
你這個怪物 噢
You monster. Ow!

161
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,402
她咬我
It bit me!

162
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,739
那你希望小精靈做什麼？
What did you expect fairies to do?

163
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:48,941
我以為她們會滿足人們的願望
I thought they did nice things like granting wishes.

164
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,483
啊？看來你什麼都不知道 是吧？
Huh? Shows what you know, don't it?

165
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,687
- 五十八  - 你真可惡
- Fifty-eight. - You're horrible.

166
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,552
啊？不 不是這樣
Huh? No, I ain't.

167
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,783
我是霍格 你是誰？
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?

168
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,657
我也想問你呢
That's what I thought.

169
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,220
五十九
Fifty-nine.

170
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,528
你知道迷宮的門在哪裡嗎？
Do you know where the door to the labyrinth is?

171
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,034
- 也許  - 在哪裡？
- Maybe. - Where is it?

172
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,593
噢 小東西
Oh, you little...

173
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,399
六十
Sixty!

174
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,770
- 我說它在哪裡？  - 什麼在哪裡？
- I said, where is it? - Where is what?

175
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,003
- 門  - 什麼門？
- The door. - What door?

176
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,601
看來不可能從你那裡問出點什麼來
It's hopeless asking you anything.

177
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,375
那是因為你沒有問對問題
Not if you ask the right questions.

178
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,280
怎樣我才能 進入那個迷宮啊？
How do I get into the labyrinth?

179
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,516
這還差不多
Now that's more like it.

180
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,458
你從這裡進去
You gets in there.

181
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,438
你真的要進去是嗎？
You really going in there, are you?

182
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,506
是的
Yes.

183
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,102
恐怕我必須得去
I'm afraid I have to.

184
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,697
挺容易是嗎？
Cozy, isn't it?

185
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:28,379
現在你是向左還是向右？
Now, would you go left or right?

186
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:35,047
- 兩面看起來都一樣  - 嗯你不會走得太遠的
- They both look the same. - Well, you're not gonna get very far.

187
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,988
- 你會去哪邊？  - 我？
- Which way would you go? - Me?

188
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,558
兩面我都不去
I wouldn't go either way.

189
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,389
如果你只願意幫忙到這裡的話 你可以走了
If that's all the help you're gonna be, you can just leave.

190
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,625
你知道你的問題在哪嗎？ 你得自己努力
You know your problem? You take too many things for granted.

191
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,057
拿這個迷宮來說
Take this labyrinth...

192
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,366
即使你到了它的中間 你也走不出來
Even if you get to the center, you'll never get out again.

193
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,465
- 那是你的看法  - 至少比你的好
- That's your opinion. - It's a lot better than yours.

194
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,907
就算這樣也多謝你 霍格特
Thanks for nothing, Hogwart.

195
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:05,148
是霍格 別說我沒警告你
It's Hoggle! And don't say I didn't warn you.

196
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,641
什麼「迷宮」啊？ 沒有拐彎也沒有拐角
What do they mean, "labyrinth"? There aren't any turns or corners.

197
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,084
只是不斷延伸下去
It just goes on and on.

198
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,828
或許它有盡頭
Maybe it doesn't.

199
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,762
或許只是我以為它有沒有
Maybe I'm just taking it for granted that it does.

200
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,316
您好
'Allo.

201
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,625
是你說「哈嘍」的嗎？
Did you say "hello"?

202
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,390
不 我是說「啊嘍」 不過也差不多了
No, I said "'allo," but that's close enough.

203
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,024
- 你是只蠕蟲是嗎？  - 沒錯
- You're a worm, aren't you? - That's right.

204
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:40,129
或許你知道怎樣通過這個迷宮吧？
You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth?

205
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,697
誰 我？我我只是條蟲子
Who, me? No, I'm just a worm.

206
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,374
進來見見我太太吧
Come inside, meet the missus.

207
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:50,643
不謝謝你 我先得搞定這個迷宮
No, thank you, but I have to solve this labyrinth.

208
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,344
可是這條巷即沒有拐彎又沒有出口 什麼都沒有
But there aren't any turns or any openings or anything.

209
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,512
一望又沒有盡頭
It just goes on and on.

210
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,490
你只是看不到 這裡到處都是出口 但你卻看不見
You ain't looking right. It's full of openings, but you ain't seeing 'em.

211
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,924
- 出口在哪？  - 穿過那兒就有一個
- Where are they? - There's one just across there.

212
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,360
就在你前面
It's right in front of ya.

213
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,557
沒有啊
No, there isn't.

214
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,430
進來喝杯茶吧
Come inside and have a nice cup of tea.

215
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:13,495
- 但這裡沒有出口啊  - 肯定有
- But there isn't an opening. - Of course there is.

216
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,133
你試著走過去 你就明白我的意思了
You try walking through it. You'll see what I mean.

217
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,301
什麼？
What?

218
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,878
繼續
Go on then.

219
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,006
那只是一堵牆 沒有進去的路啊
That's just wall. There's no way through.

220
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,349
這裡的東西並不總跟你所看到的一樣
Things are not always what they seem in this place.

221
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,878
所以你不能光看表面
So you can't take anything for granted.

222
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,429
嘿
Hey!

223
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,894
- 繼續  - 謝謝你
- Hang on. - Thank you.

224
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,096
- 您真幫了我的大忙  - 別去那邊
- That was incredibly helpful. - Don't go that way.

225
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,970
- 什麼？  - 我說別去那邊
- What was that? - I said, don't go that way.

226
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,703
絕對不要走這條路
Never go that way.

227
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,644
噢多謝
Oh. Thanks.

228
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,910
如果她堅持走那條路的話…
If she had kept on going down that way...

229
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,816
那她很快就會到城堡了
she'd had gone straight to that castle.

230
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,560
托比
Toby.

231
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,567
我來啦 托比
I'm coming, Toby.

232
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,940
把這個還給我 快點 離我遠點
Give me back this! Go on, get off me.

233
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,182
別走這條路 你在說什麼？
Stay out of the way. What are you talking about?

234
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,186
走走走
Walk, walk, walk.

235
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,003
- 你讓我想起了小孩  - 什麼小孩？
- You remind me of the babe. - What babe?

236
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,605
- 擁有魔法的小孩  - 什麼魔法？
- The babe with the power. - What power?

237
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,274
-  伏都魔法  - 誰會魔法？
- The power of voodoo. - Who do?

238
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,409
- 你會  - 會什麼？
- You do. - Do what?

239
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:09,249
讓我想起了小孩
Remind me of the babe.

240
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,949
安靜點 一個小妖精
Quiet! A goblin babe.

241
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,227
嗯？
Well?

242
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:20,528
DAVID BOWIE - DANCE MAGIC

243
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,435
嘿 出了什麼事嗎？
Hey, what goes on?

244
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,800
你媽媽是個土豚
Your mother is an aardvark!

245
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,729
9個小時零23分鐘後…
In 9 hours and 23 minutes...

246
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,732
你就是我的了
you'll be mine.

247
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,722
- 你明白了嗎？  - 我明白了
- You got it? - I got it.

248
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,261
- 不錯  - 噓
- Good. - Shh!

249
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,969
有人改了我的標記
Someone has been changing my marks.

250
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,241
這真是個可怕的地方 這不公平
What a horrible place this is. It's not fair!

251
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,872
你說的對 這不公平
That's right. It's not fair.

252
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,080
而這只是其中一部分
But that's only half of it.

253
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,720
- 一分鐘之前這裡還是個死胡同  - 不 在你後面的才是死胡同
- This was a dead end a minute ago. - No, that's the dead end behind you.

254
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,494
它總是在變 我該怎麼辦呢？
It keeps changing. What am I supposed to do?

255
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,558
唯一的出路 就在這其中的一個門
The only way out of here is to try one of these doors.

256
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,571
其中一個通向迷宮中間的城堡
One of them leads to the castle at the center of the labyrinth.

257
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,972
- 另一個通向…  - 哺哺哺哺
- And the other one leads to... - Boom-boom-ba-boom.

258
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,975
死亡
Certain death.

259
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,640
哪個是哪個？
Which one is which?

260
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,741
- 我們不能告訴你  - 為什麼不能？
- We can't tell you. - Why not?

261
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,485
- 我們不知道  - 但就是這樣
- We don't know. - But they do.

262
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,523
哦 那我就去問他們
Oh. Then I'll ask them.

263
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:44,592
不 你不能問我們倆 你只能問我們其中一個
No, you can't ask us. You can only ask one of us.

264
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:47,598
這是規則 而且我得警告你…
It's in the rules, and I should warn you...

265
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,362
我們其中一人總是說實話…
one of us always tells the truth...

266
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,596
而另一人總是說慌
and one of us always lies.

267
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:54,138
這也是規則 他總是說謊
That's a rule too. He always lies.

268
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:57,698
- 我沒有 我講的是實話  - 哦 你看這謊說的
- I do not. I tell the truth. - Oh, what a lie.

269
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,240
他說謊
He's the liar.

270
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,005
好吧 回答是或不是
All right. Answer yes or no.

271
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:09,014
他會告訴我這扇門是通向城堡的嗎？
Would he tell me that this door leads to the castle?

272
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:15,700
- 你認為呢？  - 我不知道
-What do you think? -l don't know.

273
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:16,920
是的
Yes.

274
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,926
那麼另一扇門通向城堡…
Then the other door leads to the castle...

275
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,933
而這扇門通向死亡
and this door leads to certain death.

276
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,697
- 噢！  - 你怎麼知道？
- Ooh! - How do you know?

277
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,638
- 他可能在說實話  - 那麼你卻不會
- He could be telling the truth. - But then you wouldn't be.

278
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,403
因此如果你告訴我他說是 我就知道答案是不
So if you told me that he said yes, I know the answer is no.

279
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:34,310
- 但我也可能在說實話  - 那麼他說謊也行啊
- But I could be telling the truth. - But then he would be lying.

280
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,837
如果你告訴我他說是 我知道答案仍然是否
So if you told me that he said yes, I know the answer would still be no.

281
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,009
等一等 是這樣嗎？
Wait a minute. Is that right?

282
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,713
我不知道 我搞不清楚
I don't know. I've never understood it.

283
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,150
就是這樣 我想出來了
No, it's right. I figured it out.

284
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,386
以前我就想不出來
I could never do it before.

285
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,420
我想我越來越聰明了 這是小菜一碟
I think I'm getting smarter. This is a piece of cake.

286
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,101
救命啊！
Help!

287
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,168
不要這樣！救命啊！
Stop it! Help!

288
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,978
你不是喊救命嗎？ 我們正在救你
What do you mean, "help"? We are helping.

289
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,047
我們是救命手
We're helping hands.

290
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,741
你們弄痛我了
You're hurting.

291
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,580
你要我們放手嗎？
Would you like us to let go?

292
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,874
不
No!

293
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,254
那好 哪一邊？
Well, then come on, which way?

294
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,723
哪一邊？
Which way?

295
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,557
上還是下？
Up or down?

296
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,154
- 噢  - 說啊 說啊
- Oh. - Come on, come on.

297
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,199
我們沒時間磨蹭
We haven't got all day.

298
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,031
看來這個決定很重大
Well, it's a big decision for her.

299
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,095
你想去哪一邊啊？
Which way do you want to go, hmm?

300
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,471
是啊 哪一邊？
Yes, which way?

301
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,343
既然我在向下 那就下吧
Well, since I'm pointed that way, I guess I'll go down.

302
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,473
她選擇下
She chose down.

303
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,745
她選擇下？
She chose down?

304
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,720
- 錯了嗎？  - 太遲了
- Was that wrong? - Too late now.

305
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,733
她掉進了地牢
She's in the oubliette.

306
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,864
住口！她不應該來到地牢
Shut up! She should not have gotten as far as the oubliette.

307
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:12,342
- 她現在應該放棄了  - 她不會放棄的
- She should have given up by now. - She'll never give up.

308
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,641
不會嗎？ 矮子會帶她回到入口處
Won't she? The dwarf's about to lead her back to the beginning.

309
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:20,207
當她意識到要從頭開始 就會馬上放棄
She'll soon give up when she realizes she has to start all over again.

310
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,253
那麼笑吧
Well, laugh.

311
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,431
是誰？
Who's there?

312
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,932
是我
Me.

313
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,930
- 噢是你  - 嗯是的…
- Oh, it's you. - Oh, yes, well...

314
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,065
我一見到你 就知道你將會有麻煩…
I knew you were gonna get into trouble as soon as I met you...

315
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,609
所以我來幫你了
so I've come to give you a hand.

316
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,106
你在到處看呢 不是嗎？
Oh, you're looking around now, aren't you?

317
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,014
我想你應該發現這裡沒有門
I suppose you noticed there ain't no doors.

318
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,018
只有那個洞口
Only the hole.

319
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,551
這是一間地牢 迷宮裡到處都是
This is an oubliette. The labyrinth's full of them.

320
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,718
- 真的？你怎麼知道的？  - 噢 真笨
- Really? How do you know that? - Oh, don't sound so smart.

321
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,058
- 你不知道地牢是什麼  - 你知道嗎？
- You don't know what an oubliette is. - Do you?

322
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,156
當然那是你把別人關起來…
Yes, it's a place you put people...

323
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,360
讓他們忘記自己的地方
to forget about 'em.

324
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,064
現在你要做的 就是離開這裡
Now, what you've gotta do is get out of here.

325
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:17,108
碰巧我知道一條捷徑…
And it so happens that I know a short cut...

326
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,235
能夠離開迷宮
out of the whole labyrinth from here.

327
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,506
不 我現在不打算放棄
No, I'm not giving up now.

328
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,513
我都走這麼遠了
I've come too far.

329
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,219
- 我很好  - 你當然很好
- No, I'm doing okay. - Of course you are.

330
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,486
但是被困在這裡就不好了
But it gets a lot worse from here on in.

331
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,293
你為什麼這麼關心我？
Why are you so concerned about me?

332
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,264
哦 我就是這樣的
Well, I am, that's all.

333
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:45,793
不想看到這麼年輕漂亮的女孩 被困在又黑又恐怖的地牢裡
Nice, young girl. Terrible, black oubliette.

334
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,204
你喜歡珠寶 對嗎？
You like jewelry, don't you?

335
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,901
幹嘛？
Why?

336
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,844
如果你幫我走出迷宮 我給你這個
If you help me solve the labyrinth, I'll give you this.

337
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,641
你很喜歡 是嗎？
You like it, don't you?

338
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,811
- 一般般  - 那好
- So-so. - Oh. Okay.

339
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,454
這樣吧 你把手鐲給我…
Tell you what... you give me the bracelet...

340
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,459
我就帶你離開迷宮
and I'll show you the way out of the labyrinth.

341
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,189
- 你一定要這麼做  - 是的
- You were gonna do that anyway. - Yes.

342
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:16,667
這樣做是對你示好的姿態
That's what would make it a particularly nice gesture on your part.

343
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,465
這樣吧…
I'll tell you what...

344
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,334
如果你不帶我去迷宮中心 盡量把我帶近一些
if you won't take me to the center, take me as far as you can.

345
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,773
- 然後我自己走  - 這是什麼做的？
- Then I'll do it on my own. - What is that anyway?

346
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,070
塑料
Plastic.

347
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,407
那麼我答應你…
I don't promise nothing, but...

348
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:36,443
我盡量把你帶近些 然後你自己走 是嗎？
I'll take you as far as I can, then you're on your own, right?

349
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,682
- 是  - 那好
- Right. - Right.

350
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,993
喔 塑料的！
Wow. Plastic!

351
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,399
走吧
Here we go.

352
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,633
該死的
Damn.

353
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,140
垃圾房
Broom closet.

354
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,312
不是每一次都靈
Well, can't be right all the time.

355
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,409
對了 來吧
This is it. Come on then.

356
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,026
- 這邊  - 不要往前走了- This way. - Don't go on.

357
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,396
趁你還有機會 趕快回去吧
Go back while you still can.

358
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,630
這條路不對
This is not the way.

359
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,229
當心 不要再向前了
Take heed and go no further.

360
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,641
小心 小心
Beware. Beware.

361
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,146
就快來不及了
Soon it will be too late.

362
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,512
唉！別理它們
Yeah! Don't pay any attention to them.

363
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,144
它們是假警報 在迷宮到處都可以看到
They're just false alarms. You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.

364
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,222
特別是當你走對路時
Especially when you're on the right track.

365
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,258
- 不 你走錯路了  - 住口
- Oh, no, you're not. - Oh, shut up.

366
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,489
- 對不起 我只是在工作  - 沒必要對我們說
- Sorry. Just doing my job. - You don't have to do it to us.

367
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,588
- 當心了  - 得了
- Beware for... - Just forget it.

368
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:57,328
讓我說吧 我很久沒說話了
Oh, please, I haven't said it for such a long time.

369
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,894
也好 不過別指望我們會有多大的反應
Oh, all right, but don't expect a big reaction.

370
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,702
不不不 當然不會
No, no, no, of course not.

371
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,905
你們正在走向毀滅
For the path you will take will lead to certain destruction.

372
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,914
- 太謝謝你了  - 噢
- Thank you very much. - Uh-oh.

373
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,108
噢 不好
Oh, no.

374
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,416
我們碰到什麼了？
What have we here?

375
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,824
- 沒什麼  - 沒什麼？
- Nothing. - Nothing?

376
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,624
沒什麼？沒什麼？
Nothing? Nothing?

377
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,631
沒什麼 哇啦啦
Nothing, tra-la-la.

378
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,691
國王陛下 見到你太意外了
Your Majesty, what a nice surprise.

379
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,929
- 你好 霍特沃得  - 霍格特
- Hello, Hedgewart. - Hogwart.

380
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,437
霍格！
Hoggle!

381
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,407
霍格 你在幫助這個女孩嗎？
Hoggle, can it be that you're helping this girl?

382
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,309
幫助？這是什麼話？
Helping? In what sense?

383
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,846
我是說你正在帶她到城堡
In the sense that you're leading her towards the castle.

384
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,179
不我在帶她到入口處 國王陛下
No, I was taking her back to the beginning, Your Majesty.

385
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,684
什麼？
What?

386
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,244
我告訴她 我會幫她走進迷宮
I told her I was going to help her solve the labyrinth.

387
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,520
我在騙她 實際上…
A little trickery on my part. But actually...

388
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,652
你手腕上的塑料是什麼？
What is that plastic thing 'round your wrist?

389
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,527
噢 這個！
Oh, this!

390
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,328
天哪 這是哪來的？
My goodness, where did this come from?

391
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,928
- 希格…  - 霍格
- Higgle... - Hoggle.

392
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,735
如果我知道你在背叛我…
If I thought for one second that you were betraying me...

393
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,778
我就不得不把你倒掛在永久惡臭的沼澤上
I'd be forced to suspend you headfirst in the Bog of Eternal Stench.

394
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,942
不要 國王陛下！ 不要那裡！
No, Your Majesty! Not the Eternal Stench!

395
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,950
怕了嗎 霍格！
Oh, yes, Hoggle!

396
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,543
你呢 莎拉
And you, Sarah.

397
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,623
覺得我的迷宮怎樣？
How are you enjoying my labyrinth?

398
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,961
小菜一碟
It's a piece of cake.

399
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,656
噢！
Oh!

400
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:35,062
真的？那麼 把時間撥快點把？
Really? Then how about upping the stakes?

401
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,465
哼？
Hmm?

402
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,093
這不公平！
That's not fair!

403
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,264
你說很多次了
You say that so often.

404
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:45,207
我想知道你和什麼比較
I wonder what your basis for comparison is.

405
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,768
迷宮是小菜一碟 是嗎？
So the labyrinth's a piece of cake, is it?

406
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,304
那麼看看你怎麼對付這個小玩意
Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice.

407
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,088
噢不 是掃除機！
Oh, no, the cleaners!

408
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,093
- 什麼？  - 快跑！
- What? - Run!

409
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,264
你還好吧？
You okay?

410
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,271
來吧！
Come on!

411
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,107
快點！
Faster!

412
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,711
掃除機！惡臭沼澤！
The cleaners! The Bog of Stench!

413
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,413
你讓他認真起來了
You sure got his attention.

414
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,538
啊 這正是我們要的
Ah, this is what we need.

415
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,878
一個梯子 來吧
A ladder. Follow me.

416
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,613
你剛才想把我帶回入口處 我現在如何相信你？
How can I trust you now that I know you were taking me back to the beginning?

417
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,245
我沒有
I wasn't.

418
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:08,759
我告訴他我在帶你回入口處 是為了分散他的注意
I told him I was taking you back to the beginning to throw him off the scent.

419
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,624
霍格，我如何相信你的話呢？
Hoggle, how can I believe anything you say?

420
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,494
好吧 這麼說吧
Well, let me put it this way.

421
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,693
你還有什麼選擇呢？
What choice have you got?

422
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,503
那倒是
You're right.

423
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,305
看來你開始瞭解我的處境了
You see, you've gotta understand my position.

424
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:29,870
我是膽小鬼 佳拉斯嚇倒我了
I'm a coward, and Jareth scares me.

425
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:34,042
- 什麼樣的處境？  - 沒地位 我認為
- What kind of position is that? - No position. That's my point.

426
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,111
如果你聞過永久惡臭的沼澤…
You wouldn't be so brave if you'd ever smelled...

427
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,281
你就不會這麼勇敢了
the Bog of Eternal Stench.

428
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,416
那是…那是…
It's... It's...

429
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,689
真的很臭嗎？
Is that all it does, is smell?

430
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,096
相信我 是真的
Believe me, that's enough.

431
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,896
更糟糕的是 萬一你不幸…
But the worst thing is, if you so much...

432
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,062
把腳踏進惡臭沼澤…
as put a foot in the Bog of Stench...

433
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,370
你的餘生都會很臭
you'll smell bad for the rest of your life.

434
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,070
洗不掉的
It'll never wash off.

435
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:07,945
我們到了 從現在起你要靠自己了
Here we are then. You're on your own from now on.

436
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,612
- 什麼？  - 到此為止 我走了
- What? - That's it. I quit.

437
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,624
等一等
Wait a minute.

438
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,622
我遵守諾言了 我說過我能帶多遠就多遠
I didn't promise nothin'. I said I'd take you as far as I could go.

439
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,463
你這個小騙子 你無恥
You little cheat. You nasty little cheat.

440
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,471
別為難我了 我沒有自尊
Don't try to embarrass me. I've got no pride.

441
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,598
真的？
Oh, yeah?

442
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,369
這是我的珠寶！
But them's my jewels!

443
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,901
還給我 還給我 把它們還給我
You give 'em back. Give them back. Give those back.

444
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,177
把它們還給我！
Give those back to me!

445
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:42,743
現在城堡就在那邊 我們該走哪邊呢？
Now, there's the castle. Which way should we try?

446
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,881
那是我的財產 這不公平！
Them's my rightful property. It's not fair!

447
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,449
就是不公平的
No, it isn't.

448
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,894
事實就是這樣
But that's the way it is.

449
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,973
不好意思 你能幫幫我嗎？
Excuse me, please, but can you help me?

450
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,236
噢 小女孩！
Oh, a young girl!

451
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,346
他是誰？
And who is this?

452
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,218
- 我朋友  - 是啊
- My friend. - Oh, yes.

453
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,777
有什麼能幫你？
And what can I do for you?

454
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,948
麻煩你告訴我… 就是…
Please, can you tell... That is...

455
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,549
我要去迷宮中央的城堡
I have to get to the castle at the center of the labyrinth.

456
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,595
你知道該怎麼走嗎？
Do you know the way?

457
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,857
那麼
Well, yes, now.

458
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,595
你想要去城堡
You want to get to the castle.

459
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,967
腦筋不是很好啊？
How's that for brain power, huh?

460
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,335
安靜！
Be quiet!

461
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,170
啊 生氣了
Ah, nuts.

462
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,302
那麼 小姐…
So, young woman...

463
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:44,746
向前的路有時是往回的
the way forward is sometimes the way back.

464
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,549
你會聽這個廢物的話嗎！
Will you listen to this crap!

465
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,784
- 你靜一點好嗎！  - 好 對不起
- Will you please be quiet! - Sorry. All right.

466
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:53,983
- 好嗎  - 好！
- Okay. - Okay!

467
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,117
- 好嗎  - 好！
- All right. - All right!

468
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,127
- 什麼？  - 對不起
- What? - Sorry.

469
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,598
說完了嗎？
Finished?

470
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,233
是
Yes.

471
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,066
小姐 很多時候…
Quite often, young lady...

472
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:12,542
看起來我們哪裡也去不了 但是事實上…
it seems like we're not getting anywhere, when in fact...

473
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,977
- 我們確實在前進  - 是的
- We are. - We are.

474
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,346
我現在當然哪兒也去不了
I'm certainly not getting anywhere at the moment.

475
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,645
加入俱樂部吧
Join the club.

476
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,617
我想這是你的命運
I think that's your lot.

477
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:30,923
請在這個小盒子裡 捐獻點什麼吧
Please leave a contribution in the little box.

478
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,989
你敢！那是我的
Don't you dare! Them's mine.

479
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,596
我想我可以捐出這個
Well, I guess I can spare this.

480
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:50,871
你沒有必要把那個給他
Oh, you didn't have to give him that.

481
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,883
他告訴你一些事情了
He didn't tell you nothin'.

482
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,114
好了 兩個蠢材上當了
Well, then. There go a couple of suckers.

483
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:01,549
啊 當你的帽子真刺激
Ah, it's so stimulating being your hat.

484
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,856
為什麼…為什麼你那麼說…
Why... Why did you say that...

485
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,057
說我是你的朋友？
about my being your friend?

486
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,622
因為你就是我的朋友
Because you are.

487
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,795
你可能不是我真正的朋友 但在這裡你是我唯一的朋友
You may not be much of a friend, but you're the only one I've got here.

488
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,569
你聽到什麼嗎？
Do you hear something?

489
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,109
- 沒有 一切正常  - 朋友
- No, it's all right. - Friend.

490
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:21,807
我喜歡這樣
I like that.

491
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,715
以前我從來沒有朋友
I ain't never been no one's friend before.

492
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,018
- 再見！  - 等一等
- Good-bye! - Wait a minute.

493
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,089
- 留著我的東西  - 你是不是我的朋友？
- Keep the stuff. - Are you my friend or not?

494
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,556
不 我不是 霍格沒有朋友
No, I'm not. Hoggle ain't no one's friend.

495
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:37,618
他照顧他自己 跟其他人一樣
He looks after himself, like everyone.

496
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,426
霍格的朋友就是他自己
Hoggle is Hoggle's friend.

497
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:43,023
霍格 你這個膽小鬼！
Hoggle, you coward!

498
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,837
我才不怕
Well, I'm not afraid.

499
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:51,272
在這裡經常眼見不為實
Things aren't always what they seem in this place.

500
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,745
試試這個吧 大雪人！
Try on this for size, you big yeti!

501
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,446
我們抓到你了 怪物！
We've got you now, fuzz ball!

502
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,153
一起來吧
All together now.

503
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:16,231
要是我有東西 扔過去就好了
If only I had something to throw.

504
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,466
咬他！咬他！
Sock it to him! Sock it to him!

505
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:34,878
怎麼回事？誰關燈？ 我看不見！
What happened? Who turned out the light? I can't see!

506
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:39,681
- 你幹嘛咬我？  - 誰咬誰？
- Why'd you bite me? - Who bite who?

507
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,089
誰咬我？誰咬我？
Who bite me? Who bite me?

508
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:46,192
- 我看不見！  - 發生什麼事？
- I can't see! - What is going on?

509
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,035
撤退！
Retreat!

510
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,132
誰咬我？
Who bit me?

511
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,641
噢 我心愛的生魚片！
Oh, my aching sushi!

512
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,122
停止
Now, stop that.

513
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,986
你就這樣對待救你的人的嗎？
Is that any way to treat someone who's trying to help you?

514
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,030
你要我放你下來嗎？
Don't you want me to help you down?

515
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:27,928
放下魯德
Ludo down.

516
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,405
魯德？
Ludo?

517
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:31,667
是你的名字嗎？
Is that your name?

518
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:38,140
你是一頭可愛的野獸
You seem like such a nice beast.

519
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,442
我真的希望你跟你的外表一樣友好
Well, I certainly hope you are what you seem to be.

520
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,253
堅持一下 我放你下來
Just hang on. I'll get you down.

521
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,527
就好了
Just a second.

522
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,423
對不起！
I'm sorry!

523
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,065
魯德 你受傷了嗎？
Ludo, are you hurt?

524
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:06,969
朋友？
Friend?

525
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,569
是的 魯德
That's right, Ludo.

526
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,080
我是莎拉
I'm Sarah.

527
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,916
莎拉
Sarah.

528
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,214
起來吧 我幫你
Here, let me help you.

529
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,223
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

530
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:29,289
莎拉是朋友
Sarah friend.

531
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,824
等一等
Now, wait. Just a second.

532
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:35,669
- 我想問你一些東西 魯德  - 什麼？
- I want to ask you something, Ludo. - What?

533
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,335
我得去迷宮中心的城堡 你知道怎麼去嗎？
I have to get to the castle at the labyrinth's center. Do you know the way?

534
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:49,514
- 不知道  - 你也不知道啊？
- No. - You don't know either, huh?

535
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,145
有人知道如何走出迷宮就好了
I wonder if anyone knows how to get through this labyrinth.

536
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:57,351
走出迷宮 走出迷宮
Get through the labyrinth. Get through the labyrinth.

537
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:01,330
可以肯定… 她永遠也走不出迷宮
One thing for sure... she'll never get through the labyrinth.

538
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,235
喂
Hey.

539
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,635
它們從哪來？
Where did they come from?

540
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,240
你說呢？
What do you think?

541
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,975
兩個醜面孔我們挑哪個呢？
Which shall we choose out of these two ugly characters?

542
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,012
盯著人看是不禮貌的！
It's very rude to stare!

543
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,924
對不起我只是在想 該挑哪一扇門而已
I'm sorry. I was just wondering which door to choose.

544
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,189
- 什麼？  - 問他沒用
- What? - It's no good asking him.

545
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,493
- 他是徹底聾了  - 不要含著東西說話
- He's as deaf as a post. - Don't talk with your mouth full.

546
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,090
- 我沒有含著東西說話！  - 等一等
- I'm not talking with my mouth full! - Wait a second.

547
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,295
- 我聽不懂你的話  - 你說什麼了？
- I can't understand you. - What were you saying?

548
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:48,376
- 把那個東西拿掉真好啊  - 你剛才說什麼？
- It is so good to get that thing out. - What were you saying?

549
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,539
我說問他沒用 他是完全聾了
I said, it's no good talking to him. He's as deaf as a post.

550
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:55,484
咕噥咕噥 你真是一個健談的同事
Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful conversational companion.

551
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,818
你會說！你在呻吟而已！
You can talk! All you do is moan!

552
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,084
沒用 我聽不見
No good. Can't hear you.

553
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,894
- 這些門通向哪裡？  - 什麼？
- Where do these doors lead? - What?

554
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,728
我可不知道 我們只是門環而已
Search me. We're just the knockers.

555
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:14,938
- 我怎麼過去？  - 啊？
- How do I get through? - Huh?

556
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:18,407
敲門門就會開
Knock, and the door will open.

557
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,343
我不想再含著這個東西
I don't want that thing back in my mouth.

558
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,854
- 好吧 我要敲門  - 嗯
- Come on. I want to knock. - Mm-mmm.

559
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:34,653
他不想再含著那個東西 是嗎？
Doesn't want his ring back in his mouth, eh?

560
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,125
我可沒有責備他
Can't say I blame him.

561
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:59,642
- 對不起  - 沒什麼 我習慣了
- Sorry. - That's all right. I'm used to it.

562
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:09,617

Come on.

563
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,470
歡迎
You're welcome.

564
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,783
他是一個活潑的小傢伙 我想我要叫他佳拉斯
He's a lively little chap. I think I'll call him Jareth.

565
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,620
我注意他好久了
He's got my eyes.

566
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,641
魯德害怕
Ludo scared.

Come on.

569
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,909

Imagine a big thing like you being scared.

570
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,416

See, Ludo? There's nothing to be afraid of.

572
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,973
魯德 你在哪裡？
Ludo, where are you?

573
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,143
霍格 救命啊！

574
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:45,450
- 我來了 莎拉  - 幸虧有你啊
- I'm comin', Sarah. - Well, if it isn't you.

你去哪裡？
And where are you going?

576
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,260
那個小女孩讓我摔倒了…
Well, the little lady gave me the slip...

577
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:55,025
但是現在我聽到她在叫我…
but I just hears her now...

578
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,330
所以我打算把她帶回入口處…
so I was about to lead her back to the beginning...

579
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,495
按照你的要求
like you told me.

580
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,801
- 我明白了  - 魯德！
- I see. - Ludo!

581
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,706
我還以為你要回去幫她呢
For one moment I thought you were running to help her.

582
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,439
但在我警告你 以後就不認為了
But no, not after my warnings.

583
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,778
- 那是愚蠢的  - 你說對了！
- That would be stupid. - Oh, you bet it would!

584
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,478
在你警告之後我還幫她？

585
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:22,891
- 噢 可憐的赫格特  - 霍格
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead. - Hoggle.

586
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,397
我剛剛發現 你可愛的珠寶不見了
I've just noticed your lovely jewels are missing.

587
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,831
噢 真的不見了
Oh, yes, so they are.

588
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,893
我可愛的珠寶 讓我想一想
My lovely jewels. Let me think.

589

back to the beginning of the labyrinth, just like we planned.

591
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:41,906
等等
Wait.

592
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,004

禮物
It's a present.

596
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,222
它不會傷害小女孩 是嗎？
It ain't gonna hurt the little lady, is it?

597
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,988
幹嘛這麼擔心？

- 我不想傷害她  - 噢 霍格布林
- I won't do nothin' to harm her. - Oh, come, come, Hogbrain.

601
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,870
你沒有想到一個小女孩會…
You don't think a young girl could ever like...

602
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,637
喜歡你這樣的無賴 不是嗎？
a repulsive little scab like you, do you?

603
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,735
她說我們是…
She said we was...

604
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,041
知心朋友？
Bosom companions?

605
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:19,741
朋友？
Friends?

606
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,177
- 無所謂  - 你要把那個給她…
- Don't matter. - You'll give her that...

607
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:26,382
不然我就把你扔進永久惡臭的沼澤…
or I'll tip you straight into the Bog of Eternal Stench...

You can't quit. The game's not over.

646
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:20,310

We want her! Get us all!

651
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:37,628

If you play, we'll take off your arms!

652
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:41,689
- 或者拿掉你的耳朵  - 你不需要兩隻耳朵
- Or we'll take off your ear. - You don't need two ears.

653
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,065
- 遊戲快結束了  - 時間到
- Game's almost over. - Time's up.

噢 我的天
Oh, my God.

659
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:18,700
噢 這是什麼？
Oh, what is it?

660
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:21,706
永久惡臭的沼澤！
The Bog of Eternal Stench!

661
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,478
我從未聞過這種東西 好像…
I never smelled anything like it. It's like...

662
00:55:32,818 --> 00:55:36,777
別管它像什麼 它是永久惡臭的沼澤
It doesn't matter what it's like. It's a Bog of Eternal Stench.

663
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:38,288

堅持住
Hold on.

665
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:48,931
你為什麼要這麼做？
What did you have to go and do a thing like that for?

666
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:50,093
做什麼？
Do what?

667
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:55,998
- 你是說我救你嗎？  - 什麼？不是
- You mean rescue you? - What? No.

668
00:55:56,108 --> 00:55:58,201

You kissed me.

669
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:06,682
噢 糟糕
Oh, my gosh.

670
00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:09,721
別裝模做樣了
Don't pretend to be so hard.

671
00:56:09,755 --> 00:56:13,623
我知道你是回來救我 我知道你是我朋友
I know you came back to help me, and I know that you're my friend.

672
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:15,490

00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,427
給你…給你…
give you... give you...

676
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:25,628
給我什麼？
Give me what?

677
00:56:33,045 --> 00:56:34,672
魯德！
Ludo!

678
00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:36,908
很臭！
Smell!

679
00:56:36,982 --> 00:56:38,779
霍格到哪去了？
Where's Hoggle?

680
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:43,054
別壓著我！
Get off of me!

681
00:56:44,256 --> 00:56:45,655
在這裡
Here.

682
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:52,155
沒事 這是魯德 它也是我的朋友
Oh, no, it's okay. This is Ludo. He's a friend too.

683
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:53,526
什麼？
A what?

684
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,362
臭！
Smell!

685
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:56,832
你說得對
You're right.

686
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:02,406
天哪
Oh, my God.

687
00:57:05,477 --> 00:57:06,910
有座橋
There's a bridge.

688
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:08,810
來吧
Come on.

689
00:57:13,786 --> 00:57:14,878
小心
Watch it.

690
00:57:14,987 --> 00:57:18,650
踩到這些東西 你就永遠都會臭
You step in this stuff and you'll stink forever.

691
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:21,985
停！
Stop!

692
00:57:23,228 --> 00:57:26,197
- 我說停  - 麻煩你讓我們過去吧
- Stop, I say. - Please, we have to get across.

693
00:57:26,298 --> 00:57:28,493
沒有我的允許 誰都別想過去
Without my permission, no one may cross.

694
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,626
我們沒多少時間了！
Please, I only have a little time left!

695
00:57:31,704 --> 00:57:33,899
我們必須走過這個沼澤
We've gotta get out of this stench.

696
00:57:34,006 --> 00:57:36,133
很臭
Smell bad.

697
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:39,006
- 臭？你說什麼臭？  - 這裡很臭
- Stench? Of what speaketh thou? - This smell.

698
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:43,475
- 我什麼都聞不到  - 你開玩笑吧
- I smell nothing. - Oh, you're joking.

699
00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:46,313
我靠嗅覺生存的
But I live by my sense of smell.

700
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:52,982
空氣又香又甜 沒有我的允許誰都不能過去！
The air is sweet and fragrant, and none may pass without my permission!

701
00:57:53,058 --> 00:57:56,027
很臭
Smell bad.

702
00:57:56,128 --> 00:57:58,528
走開！
Oh, get out of my way!

703
00:57:58,564 --> 00:58:01,533
我警告你 我發誓要盡忠職守！
I warn thee, I'm sworn to do my duty!

704
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:05,430
- 求求你讓我們過去吧  - 別動！
- Come on. Let us get across. - Hold!

705
00:58:09,942 --> 00:58:12,410
聽著我不想傷害你們
Listen, I don't want to have to hurt you.

706
00:58:12,478 --> 00:58:14,105
你要幹嘛？
What are you doing?

707
00:58:14,179 --> 00:58:16,647
放開我的武器！
Let go of my staff, sir!

708
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:27,050
那好 讓我來征服這座山
All right then. I can conquer this mountain.

709
00:58:49,014 --> 00:58:51,039
你必須幹得更好才行
Thou must do better than that.

710
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:54,379
投降了？啊？
Give up? Huh?

711
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:09,928
夠了！
Enough!

712
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:14,637
以前 我打架未縫敵手
Before this day, never have I met my match in battle.

713
00:59:14,706 --> 00:59:19,302
這個高貴的武士 讓我透不過氣
Yet this noble knight has fought me to a standstill.

714
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:22,938
- 你沒事吧 魯德？  - 臭！
- Are you all right, Ludo? - Smell!

715
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:27,145
原來你叫魯德 我是迪迪莫斯 我服輸了
Sir Ludo, if that's thy name, now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.

716
00:59:27,219 --> 00:59:30,154
來 讓我們從此做兄弟吧…
Come, let us be brothers henceforth...

717
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:32,850
為正義共同作戰！
and fight for the right as one!

718
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,261
- 非常謝謝你  - 魯德有兄弟了
- Thank you very much. - Ludo get brother.

719
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,422
一言為定
Steady.

720
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:43,191
- 很高興認識你 魯德  - 太好了 來吧
- Well met, Sir Ludo. - Good. Come on.

721
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:46,760
等等！你忘了我的誓言 小姐
Wait a minute! You forget my sacred vow, my lady.

722
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:50,639
- 我不能讓你過去  - 但是你說魯德是你的兄弟
- I cannot let you pass. - But you said Ludo is your brother.

723
00:59:50,742 --> 00:59:54,143
我曾立誓 要誓死捍衛它
I have taken an oath, and I must defend it to the death.

724
00:59:54,246 --> 00:59:56,942
- 很臭！  - 那好
- The smell! - Okay.

725
00:59:57,049 --> 01:00:00,507
我們冷靜下來想想 你到底發了什麼誓？
Let's handle this thing logically. What exactly have you sworn?

726
01:00:00,586 --> 01:00:04,682
我以血發誓 如果沒有我的允許…
I have sworn with my lifeblood no one shall pass this way...

727
01:00:04,756 --> 01:00:07,020
任何人都不准過橋
without my permission.

728
01:00:09,194 --> 01:00:12,527
那麼我們可以得到你的允許嗎？
Well, may we have your permission?

729
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:15,132
這個我…
Well, l...

730
01:00:24,076 --> 01:00:26,135
- 好吧  - 謝謝你 你太好了
- Yes. - Thank you, noble sir.

731
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:27,576
不用謝
My lady.

732
01:00:31,216 --> 01:00:34,185
- 噢  - 不要怕 小姐
- Uh-oh. - Have no fear, sweet lady.

733
01:00:34,286 --> 01:00:36,584
這座橋有一千年歷史了
This bridge has lasted for a thousand years.

734
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:49,224
- 看來還很堅固  - 霍格！
- It seemed solid enough. - Hoggle!

735
01:00:53,505 --> 01:00:56,167
不用怕 可愛的小姐 我來救你
Fear not, fair maiden. I will save thee.

736
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:57,265
怎麼回事
Somehow.

737
01:00:59,411 --> 01:01:03,472
魯德 你不去救人 反而在這裡大聲吼叫？
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl when yon maiden needs our help?

738
01:01:33,445 --> 01:01:36,175
- 太不可思議了 魯德  - 兄弟！
- That's incredible, Ludo. - My brother!

739
01:01:36,248 --> 01:01:38,546
你能聚集石頭？
Canst thou summon up the very rocks?

740
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:42,711
當然石頭是朋友
Sure. Rocks friends.

741
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:50,453
- 上來吧  - 謝謝你 霍格
- Here. - Thanks, Hoggle.

742
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:56,400
小心 魯德
Be careful, Ludo.

743
01:02:03,308 --> 01:02:05,640
等等我
Wait for me.

744
01:02:05,711 --> 01:02:09,977
安伯希斯 沒事了 出來吧

747
01:02:19,691 --> 01:02:22,717
前進
Forward. Steady, boy.

748
01:02:22,794 --> 01:02:26,286
來吧 安伯希斯 閉上眼睛直走
Come on, Ambrosious. Just close your eyes and go.

749
01:02:30,102 --> 01:02:32,002
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

750
01:02:35,807 --> 01:02:37,707
讓一讓 謝謝
Excuse us. Thank you.

751
01:02:44,316 --> 01:02:47,114
如果我是你 我不會那樣做
<i>I wouldn't do that, if I were you.</i>

752
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:50,677
不要逼我 我不能拿給她
Oh, please, I can't give it to her.

753
01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:57,957
走吧 我們在天黑前應該能到達城堡
Come on then. We should reach the castle well before day.

754
01:03:04,936 --> 01:03:08,337
看 莎拉 這就是你要找的東西嗎？
Look, Sarah, is this what you're trying to find?

755
01:03:10,876 --> 01:03:14,539
這個小傢伙多麻煩啊 但是很快就不會了
So much trouble over such a little thing, but not for long.

756
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:19,083
她很快會忘記你 我的寶貝
She'll soon forget all about you, my fine fellow.

757
01:03:19,151 --> 01:03:22,279
只要霍格把我的禮物給她…
Just as soon as Hoggle gives her my present...

758
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:25,551
她就會忘掉所有的東西
then she'll forget everything.

759
01:03:27,259 --> 01:03:30,160
是我的肚子還是你的 安伯希斯？
Is that my stomach or yours, Ambrosious?

760
01:03:31,463 --> 01:03:32,896
餓了
Hungry.

761
01:03:34,066 --> 01:03:38,469
是啊 但我們不能停下
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.

762
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:41,471
或許我們能找到野果吃
Maybe we can find some berries or something.

763
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:46,268
幹嘛？
Yeah?

764
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:47,571

01:03:52,584 --> 01:03:54,711
你真是救命恩人
You're a lifesaver.

767
01:04:04,096 --> 01:04:05,688
味道很奇怪
This tastes strange.

768
01:04:14,139 --> 01:04:15,401
你放了什麼？
What have you done?

769
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:18,806
噢 該死的佳拉斯
Oh, damn you, Jareth.

770
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:21,310
我真該死
And damn me too.

771
01:04:32,724 --> 01:04:34,658
一切都在跳動
Everything's dancing.

772
01:05:39,224 --> 01:05:43,024
太好了 停哇 安伯希斯 哇！
Yea, verily. Whoa, Ambrosious, whoa!

773
01:05:43,094 --> 01:05:47,394
城堡就在那邊 小姐
The castle doth lie yonder, my lady.

774
01:05:47,499 --> 01:05:49,399
小姐？

775
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:51,043
小姐？
My lady?

776
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:54,966
小姐？小姐？
My lady? My lady?

我失去了唯一的朋友
I've lost my only friend.

01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,372
我失去了朋友
That's what I've done.

下來！
Get off my back!

784
01:10:25,376 --> 01:10:27,936
幹嘛不想想你要去哪裡…

我忘記了
I don't remember.

789
01:10:39,491 --> 01:10:42,756
你不知道要去哪裡 找也沒用
You can't look where you're going if you don't know where you're going.

790
01:10:42,827 --> 01:10:44,488
我在找東西

開門 打開門

迪迪莫斯 我們得悄悄進去

開門 趕快開門！

857
01:15:05,857 --> 01:15:09,258
拜託 迪迪莫斯 我求你安靜下來
Please, Sir Didymus, for my sake, hush.

858
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:11,420
當然可以 為了你 什麼都可以

859
01:15:11,496 --> 01:15:13,862
- 但我不是懦夫？  - 對

安伯希斯 安靜

866
01:15:31,215 --> 01:15:33,445
我不明白為什麼要安靜
I don't see why we have to be so quiet.

867
01:15:33,518 --> 01:15:35,713
只是一個格布林鬼城而已
It's only a Goblin City.

868
01:15:35,787 --> 01:15:37,721
我感覺有麻煩了

Watch out!

875
01:16:37,949 --> 01:16:40,042
安伯希斯 過來好嗎？
Ambrosious, will you come here?

876
01:16:43,855 --> 01:16:44,981
馬上過來！

877
01:16:45,857 --> 01:16:48,451
請你過來好嗎？你讓我很難堪

Bombs away!

882
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,815
不是很好
That wasn't very nice.

883
01:17:23,628 --> 01:17:24,822
輪到我了
My turn now.

884
01:17:26,597 --> 01:17:28,792
怎麼駕駛？
How do you drive this thing?

885
01:17:32,536 --> 01:17:34,663
扔掉斧頭！
Drop the ax!

886
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:37,037
我在想辦法
I'm trying.

霍格 你沒事吧？
Hoggle, are you all right?

893
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:12,102
我不奢望你的原諒 我不為自己的所作所為感到內疚
I'm not asking to be forgiven. I ain't ashamed of nothin' I did.

894
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:15,668
佳拉斯叫我把桃子給你
Jareth made me give you that peach.

895
01:18:15,746 --> 01:18:19,375
我不介意你怎麼看我 我說過我是懦夫
I don't care what you think of me. I told you I was a coward.

896

我想和你做朋友
I ain't interested in being friends.

897

我怎麼也記不住這一行
I can never remember that line.

1019
01:32:29,499 --> 01:32:33,299
只要你敬畏我 愛我 聽我的話…
Just fear me, love me, do as I say...

1020
01:32:33,403 --> 01:32:35,803
我可以成為你的奴隸
