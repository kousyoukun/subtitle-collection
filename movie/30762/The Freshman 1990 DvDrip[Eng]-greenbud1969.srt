1
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,651
Over there! Look!

2
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,620
Dwight?

3
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,281
Dwight, don't. Don't.

4
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,419
Hey, asshole!

5
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:10,292
What are ya, nuts?
The cap's not orange enough for ya?

6
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,524
Get out of these woods!

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,160
I got a right to hunt here.
I got a permit.

8
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,829
If the guy's got a permit...

9
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,496
- Jesus.
- Get out!

10
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,039
Let's go.

11
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,677
That's Dwight Armstrong,
my stepfather...

12
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,811
accent on "step."

13
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,719
He's a lawyer by profession...

14
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:41,725
but spends most of his time as head
of the Friends of Fish and Wildlife...

15
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,353
an extremist pro-mammal group
here in Vermont.

16
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:49,595
Almost all of its members,
male and female, look just like Dwight.

17
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:54,068
My real dad died in a motorcycle wreck
when I was six.

18
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:57,938
Two years later, Mom hooked up
with Mr. Personality here.

19
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,477
It has not been a barrel of laughs.

20
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,591
There was a certain poignancy,
though, about today's hunting party.

21
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:26,901
It was my last evening at home.

22
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,906
Tomorrow I was off to New York
to begin my first year...

23
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:32,305
at New York University Film School.

24
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,235
A freshman.
That was me.

25
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,554
My farewell dinner was a typically
raucous and hilarious affair...

26
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:50,359
full of warm, good feelings.

27
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,889
That should cover it.

28
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:01,424
Afterwards, Dwight gave me $600
in spending money...

29
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:04,233
- Thank you.
- And extended a hearty handshake.

30
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,201
- Where's the subway, please?
- That'd be downstairs.

31
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:43,641
- That way?
- Right.

32
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:45,303
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,058
Sorry.

34
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,537
Forget about it.
He's out like a light.

35
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:13,300
It's the shame of the cities.

36
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,807
- Are you all right? Nothing broken?
- I'm okay.

37
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:19,043
- That was some nasty spill you took.
- I'm okay.

38
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,546
You sure?

39
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:23,015
Can I give you a hand
with those bags?

40
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,017
No, thanks.
I'm fine.

41
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:27,811
You're a smart kid.

42
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,321
Rule number one:

43
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:32,880
Don't let anybody touch your bags
unless you know that person...

44
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,893
and can verify
that he's been bonded.

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,225
- Great. Thanks a lot.
- I happen to be bonded...

46
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:39,230
which is your good fortune.

47
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:45,168
- Ignore her.
- Get away from me!

48
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:47,535
"Who's this stranger?"
You're asking yourself.

49
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:51,440
It's Victor Ray, general manager
of the Victor Ray Car Service.

50
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,670
You're on your way to college?

51
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:56,078
- Yeah. New York University.
- Good school.

52
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,584
Thanks. I thought I knew where
the subway was. Do you know?

53
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:03,452
- Yeah, but you don't want the subway.
- Yes, I do. I want the subway.

54
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:05,956
- Okay. It's over there.
- Thanks.

55
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,152
Let's go!

56
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:14,562
Kid, in New York, we have
three distinct social classes.

57
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:17,157
A: People who make
a billion dollars a day...

58
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:19,328
and get laid in some tower
every night.

59
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:23,807
B: People who live in Times Square and
eat Yankee Doodles on the sidewalk.

60
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:27,173
And C: Guys like me,
the glue of society.

61
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:30,772
We go, forget about it.
All hell's gonna break loose.

62
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,842
- You mean rich against poor.
- We're on the brink. It's seething.

63
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:38,216
Come with your Uncle Vic.

64
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:42,520
For $65 you get an air-conditioned ride
and total peace of mind.

65
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,528
I can't afford that.

66
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:48,623
That's the new rate. I could take you
for the old rate, which is 50.

67
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,667
It's outta my league.

68
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,668
How much can you go for?

69
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:56,228
- Go for? I don't know.
- Say 40, which for me is charity.

70
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:58,866
It's impossible. No.
Ten dollars I can manage.

71
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,109
Ten dollars?

72
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:05,205
For complete delivery and security
in a mint-condition Bonneville?

73
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,340
- I gotta eat too!
- I can't do better.

74
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,078
It's okay. Listen...

75
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,417
I'll walk or take a bus.

76
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:13,080
All right, ten bucks.

77
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:17,355
Come on. I'll take you for ten bucks,
but on one condition.

78
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:20,191
Promise you won't tell anybody
I took you for ten.

79
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:23,323
- Word gets out, I'm finished.
- I won't tell a soul.

80
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,367
Okay. Follow me.

81
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,098
I'm parked down the street
in a reserved spot.

82
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:29,604
Let's go.

83
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:32,039
- Watch out!
- Jesus!

84
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,474
Watch out!
Suicide attempt, right?

85
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,912
It's bigger than I had imagined.

86
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:42,507
That's true of many things in Manhattan.
The other boroughs too.

87
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:45,383
Don't get me wrong.
There's tremendous things in Queens.

88
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:49,788
Go to the trunk, kid. It opens
electronically from the inside.

89
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:54,090
Take everything. You'd be surprised how
many people, excited to be in New York...

90
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:58,559
Hey! Whoa!

91
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,760
Stop! Stop the car! Stop!

92
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:05,439
Stop the car, please!

93
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,588
I had been in New York for 19 minutes
and 11 seconds...

94
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,589
and I was already ruined.

95
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:36,297
Action.

96
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,396
The roommate enters.

97
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:40,633
Come on in. Come on.
Don't be afraid.

98
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,505
That's it. Come right in.

99
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:45,442
I'm holding you
in what we call a medium shot.

100
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:48,607
- A really lovely shot. Very cinematic.
- Listen my name is...

101
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:51,014
A little confused.

102
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,713
I like it.
It sells.

103
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:57,484
You think in front of the camera.
Very good. I like that in my actors.

104
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:00,549
- I'm moving in now.
- Hi. Is this the right room?

105
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:02,522
Cut.

106
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:05,455
That's a wrap.
Check it, kids.

107
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,801
- Kellogg?
- Yeah. You're?

108
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,633
Steve Bushak.

109
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,570
- How do you do?
- Really nice to meet you.

110
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,673
I should go
to the police now.

111
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:22,738
Clark, Kojak is a fictional character.

112
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,249
- Don't involve the police.
- I'm just a victim.

113
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:30,351
Clark, everybody in this city
is a victim.

114
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:33,457
Welcome to New York.

115
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,054
Well...

116
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,099
I'm deeply moved.

117
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,700
Sir, I understand your position.
I'm just...

118
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,431
You cannot function
in Introduction to Film...

119
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:48,769
without owning
Fleeber's Viewpoints in Cinema...

120
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,105
and Selected Readings
in Cinema by...

121
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:53,769
Fleeber.

122
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:56,143
I know. Those are your books.
I want to buy them...

123
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,614
They're not to be thought of
as my books.

124
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,618
They are required
and essential reading...

125
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,586
as are the dozen other books
which you must own...

126
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,953
and which will cost you $700.

127
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,855
Off we're
gonna shuffle

128
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:12,828
Shuffle off to Buffalo

129
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:15,365
To Niagara in the sleeper
There's no honeymoon that's cheaper

130
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,833
And the wheels go slow

131
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:20,327
Off we're gonna shuffle

132
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,566
Shuffle off to Buffalo

133
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,107
I'm doing a paper entitled
And the Wheels Go Slow...

134
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,580
Form and Function
in 42nd Street."

135
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,109
Oh. That would be
a very interesting idea.

136
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:39,553
- Take a musical like that...
- I suggest you call home for money.

137
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:42,058
No, that won't work.
My stepfather won't help...

138
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,218
This is out of Dickens.

139
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:47,822
You're robbed by a street urchin.
You have a wicked stepfather.

140
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,421
I don't know what to say.

141
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:54,528
I'm just trying to explain
that I can't get books now.

142
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:57,402
I'm your faculty advisor,
not your caseworker.

143
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:01,001
I'm only interested in your academic
career, and may I say candidly...

144
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,740
that you're off to an extraordinarily
unimpressive start.

145
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,083
Well, I'm sorry,
but being new to New York and...

146
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,820
Excuse me.

147
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,963
I have to leave now.

148
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,376
Excuse me.

149
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:49,922
Hey, wait up!

150
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,191
Stop him!
Wait!

151
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:11,711
Watch it!

152
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,713
Bye-bye.

153
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:20,318
I want my money
and my stuff now!

154
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,683
My money and my clothes,
or I call the cops.

155
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,659
I know who you are.
Enough with this crap!

156
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:33,426
Where's my stuff?

157
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:36,901
Upstairs. Give me a hand
with the wagon, would you?

158
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:38,800
You must be joking.

159
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:40,601
Hey, the party's over.

160
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:43,609
I victimized you in a moment
of weakness, and now justice is done.

161
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,440
So give me a hand.

162
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:54,543
You have my money?
Do you hear me?

163
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,748
Watch your step, kid.
The floors are wet.

164
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:59,291
If you don't give me
the money immediately...

165
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:02,794
I would love nothing
more than to do just that.

166
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:05,057
However...

167
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:07,065
here we run into
an awkward moment.

168
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,235
Tragically...

169
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:13,238
I suffer from a gambling problem.

170
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:17,366
I placed a wager on a horse.

171
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:20,969
You lost my money on a horse?
All of it?

172
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:23,480
In retrospect, I'm not sure
it actually was a horse.

173
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,915
Oh, God.

174
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:28,078
I swear,
it was a responsible bet.

175
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:32,180
It was a four-to-one shot.
We took a beating.

176
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,987
The good news is I still got
most of your clothes here.

177
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,790
I'm going to the police now.

178
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:41,196
Why are we talking about the police?
You're in college. I'm a working man.

179
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,200
This has nothing to do
with the police.

180
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:46,135
Robbery is still a crime
in New York, is it not?

181
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:49,366
- It's not legal.
- It depends on the circumstances.

182
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:52,501
Bullshit.

183
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:55,478
What if I got you a job?
An unbelievable opportunity.

184
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,980
Oh, yeah.
You're just the guy.

185
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,209
I'm serious.
In fact...

186
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:02,218
No, no.
Forget about it.

187
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,223
What?

188
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:12,228
It's irresponsible of me.
So much money.

189
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,464
What is it?

190
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:20,163
I shouldn't even
offer you this job...

191
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,501
but you put me
in such an awkward position...

192
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,837
between my terrible
feelings of guilt towards you...

193
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,602
and my family obligations.

194
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:29,167
I don't know
what you're talking about.

195
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:33,114
I'm talking about offering you a job
that I promised to my sister's kid.

196
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:37,016
It'd be perfect for a college student.
Flexible hours. Big money.

197
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:41,523
My sister's gonna kill me.
She's gonna blow my brains out.

198
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:45,623
What kind of work is it?
Stealing cars?

199
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,527
Hey, if you're gonna be
a cynic here...

200
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,695
You expect me to trust you after you
drive away with everything I own?

201
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,670
You don't have to do anything.

202
00:14:56,739 --> 00:15:00,174
I'm just giving you a choice is all.

203
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:03,040
But if you want to make
some serious money...

204
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,570
be at this address
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

205
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,917
120 Hester Street.
Old World Social Club."

206
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:16,321
Yeah. You'll be working
for my uncle Carmine. A great man.

207
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,228
He's the smart one
in the family.

208
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,096
Hey, look who's here.
Don't be shy, Clark. Come right in.

209
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:07,105
I wasn't sure
if this was the place.

210
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:09,403
This is it.
The best neighborhood in New York.

211
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:13,469
My uncle Carmine's waiting for you.
Here we go.

212
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:22,678
Over there at the desk.
That's him.

213
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,781
- He's your uncle?
- Yeah. Look, do me a favor.

214
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,792
Don't say anything
about my gambling...

215
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,794
or I'll catch a beating.

216
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,996
I said, How are you doing?"

217
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,005
- Very well," he says.
- Hello there.

218
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:43,633
Lorenzo, this is my good friend Clark
from Kansas.

219
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,644
Vermont.

220
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:50,244
"My heart is filled
with much happiness...

221
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:52,306
in meeting you,"
he says.

222
00:16:55,988 --> 00:16:57,422
God Almighty.

223
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,993
You're thinking about
the resemblance, right?

224
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,086
- I can't believe it.
- He's the real thing.

225
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:10,430
When they saw him,
they based the movie.

226
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:12,868
So is he like a Mafia guy?

227
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:17,806
No, no. Local businessman.
Importer. That's it.

228
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:20,400
- What a kisser, huh?
- Unbelievable.

229
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:29,652
Clark, this is my uncle,
Carmine Sabatini.

230
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,415
Uncle Carmine, this is Clark...

231
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:34,219
- Hey, you never told me your last name.
- Kellogg.

232
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:38,259
- Just like the cereal.
- Yeah.

233
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:42,357
Like the breakfast cereal.

234
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,696
- Your resemblance to the Godf...
- Clark, have a seat.

235
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:46,702
Pull up a chair.

236
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,704
Thank you.

237
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,146
How'd you like a nut?

238
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:58,647
No, thank you.

239
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,649
None for me, Uncle Carmine.

240
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,818
Did you ever try Italian coffee?

241
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:10,590
How would you like
to try a little taste?

242
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,991
Yeah. Why not?

243
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:15,553
- Good.
- None for me, Uncle Carmine.

244
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,098
Lorenzo.

245
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,603
Two espressos," he says.

246
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,067
You know, that picture
on the wall back there...

247
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:28,075
that wouldn't
by any chance be Mussolini?

248
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:31,841
It ain't Tony Bennett.

249
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,875
Some of the older members
of the club...

250
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:38,682
just...
I don't know...

251
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,382
They keep it up there
for sentiment.

252
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,652
- Sentiment?
- Yeah, you know, the old days.

253
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:46,888
For the old days.
For good or for bad.

254
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:49,089
It'd be like, for you,
I suppose...

255
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:51,189
a picture of the Beatles.

256
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:53,063
Yeah. The Beatles.

257
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:55,296
They're actually
before my time.

258
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,304
Well, whatever.
You understand.

259
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:00,307
Sure. It's not
for political reasons...

260
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,605
that you keep the picture up.

261
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,645
It's not political.

262
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,873
No, it's definitely
not political.

263
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:09,508
My nephew tells me
you're from Kansas.

264
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:12,417
Vermont.

265
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:14,045
Vermont.

266
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:16,283
Six of one, half a dozen
of the other.

267
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:19,326
You know,
the most important thing is...

268
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:21,987
we're all Americans.

269
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:24,497
- That's right.
- Yes, that's right.

270
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,393
Ah, good, Lorenzo.
Thank you.

271
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:32,371
- "Thank you,' he says.
- I know.

272
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,601
Now, this is real Italian coffee.

273
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,907
It's not like regular coffee.
It's...

274
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,470
You know what I mean?

275
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:46,178
It's a little strong, so we gotta
put a little sugar in here.

276
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,187
It cuts the...

277
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,848
It cuts the strength of it,
you know.

278
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,756
Maybe a little more,
that's all.

279
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,521
All right.
Drink it right down.

280
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,189
One gulp.

281
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,273
Puts hair on your chest.

282
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,373
Did my nephew
explain this job to you?

283
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,384
No. No, not really.

284
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,912
It would be best for you to explain it,
Uncle Carmine.

285
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,749
This is not complicated...

286
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,555
but it has to be done right.

287
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,654
- You know, like all things.
- Sure.

288
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,631
Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.,
outside the club...

289
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,897
is gonna be parked a, uh, car.

290
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,996
- What was that?
- Sedan Deville.

291
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,333
That's a type of Cadillac.
A Cadillac?

292
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,778
Yeah, this is
a type of Cadillac.

293
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:54,841
Now, I want you to drive this car
to the JFK cargo terminal.

294
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,944
There you're going
to pick up a package...

295
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:01,219
addressed to Larry London.

296
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:04,455
You deliver this package
to Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

297
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,257
That's it.

298
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,196
How far is that?
All day?

299
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,290
That shouldn't take you
more than three hours...

300
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,198
the whole trip,
back and forth.

301
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:14,898
That depends on the traffic.

302
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,600
- Right.
- Then again, you never know.

303
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:19,038
You could breeze
out there in no time...

304
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:22,044
or you could wind up
bumper-to-bumper for three hours...

305
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:24,046
sitting with your dick
in your hand.

306
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:32,912
Anyway, that's why I need someone
who can use their head...

307
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:37,450
that's not gonna get upset, nervous...
no matter what happens.

308
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:41,190
- Understand?
- Right. I understand that.

309
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:45,998
For this service,
I'm gonna pay you $500.

310
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,994
Five hundred dollars?

311
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:52,068
Now you see why
my sister's so pissed?

312
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:54,235
I mean angry,
besides herself.

313
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,837
You're gonna pull in
a grand a week, at least.

314
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:59,711
- $1,000 a week?
- Yeah.

315
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:03,274
I'm gonna need
two trips a week, minimum.

316
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:08,119
And then, of course,
if things get busy, maybe even more.

317
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,688
Jesus. I hadn't thought
of that much money.

318
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:18,666
I don't know.

319
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:23,936
- You don't know what?
- Now, wait. Just hold on.

320
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:27,065
Let him think.
This is a sign of intelligence.

321
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:31,374
He's trying to understand
what the nature of this job is.

322
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:34,005
What are your thoughts
on this, Kent?

323
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,778
- Clark.
- Sorry. Clark.

324
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:42,623
I have to ask you something.

325
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:47,556
I dont want you
to take it wrong.

326
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:50,859
No, no, no.
Anything. Go ahead.

327
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,160
I smell a rat.

328
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:01,300
You smell a rat?

329
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,867
He smells a rat.

330
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:06,469
That's right.

331
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,844
You know why
you smell a rat?

332
00:23:10,918 --> 00:23:13,546
Because God gave you a brain,
that's why.

333
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,453
Because you're asking yourself...

334
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:21,256
What is this?
A man will pay me $500 a trip...

335
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:23,296
to go pick up
a package and deliver it."

336
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:27,732
- Is this what you're thinking?
- That's right. That's what I'm feeling.

337
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,291
Well, this is natural.
Natural.

338
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,236
Great.
So then you understand.

339
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:36,106
Oh, sure.
I understand a thousand percent.

340
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,381
Give me your hand.

341
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:56,084
- You know what this is?
- You mean taking my hand?

342
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:59,097
We call this
the hand of friendship.

343
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:01,224
We?

344
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,824
Clark, you dont know
what this is...

345
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:06,895
the hand of friendship
from my uncle Carmine.

346
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:09,668
I want you to take
this opportunity.

347
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:13,074
Totally legitimate work
for $1,000 a week...

348
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:15,170
and I know you're not gonna
disappoint me.

349
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:18,482
I don't see
how I could say no.

350
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:26,222
This is not a yes.

351
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:32,920
I want to hear yes.

352
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:41,470
Yes.

353
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,809
Good.

354
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:50,105
That's good. Now I'm happy.
I'm so happy.

355
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:53,547
But I don't know
why I'm so happy. That's good.

356
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:55,414
Come on.

357
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:57,420
Everybody up.

358
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,320
I want you to come to my house
in Queens tonight.

359
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:05,861
- He's gonna...
- Yeah. Pick up the keys.

360
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:07,863
I'll give you directions.

361
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,159
You know...

362
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:13,795
I have such good feelings
about you.

363
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:18,804
I'm absolutely filled with emotion.

364
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:24,379
I never had a son.

365
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:38,417
For fifteen years, I never saw him
take to anybody like that.

366
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,826
Never.

367
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:53,165
Senator.

368
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:57,606
We're both part
of the same hypocrisy.

369
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:01,976
But never think
it applies to my family.

370
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:04,348
All right.

371
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:09,183
Some people have to play little games.

372
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:11,021
You play yours.

373
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:18,091
Let's say that you'll pay me because
it's in your interest to pay me.

374
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:21,066
But I want your answer
and the money by noon tomorrow.

375
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:22,865
And one more thing.

376
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:25,371
Don't you contact me again.
Ever.

377
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:29,171
From now on,
you deal with Turnbull.

378
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:32,275
Senator.

379
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:36,043
You can have my answer now
if you like.

380
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:39,052
My offer is this: Nothing.

381
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,588
Not even the fee
for the gaming license...

382
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:45,216
which I would appreciate
if you would put up personally.

383
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:49,522
Senator.

384
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:53,498
My offer is this: Nothing."

385
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:58,163
In that one moment, Michael Corleone
says that all corruption is equal...

386
00:26:58,238 --> 00:27:03,266
that there is no separation
between politics and gangsterism.

387
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:07,973
Now, in the Fleeber treatise,
"Guns and Provolone"...

388
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:09,845
what point is made
about the similarities...

389
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,180
between Karl Marx's
Das Kapital...

390
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:15,482
Immanuel Kant's
Critique of Pure Reason...

391
00:27:15,554 --> 00:27:19,116
and the Lake Tahoe scene
from Godfather II, Mr. Kellogg?

392
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,625
Sir.

393
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,062
You haven't read
the Fleeber piece?

394
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:29,464
- Well...
- You need tutoring from Mr. Bushak?

395
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:31,765
No, sir.

396
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:34,465
Perhaps Mr. Bushak would enjoy
helping you prepare...

397
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,509
a five-page answer
to my question...

398
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:39,135
which I want on my desk
by noon tomorrow.

399
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,872
Mr. Glassman.

400
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:43,004
In an evolving society...

401
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:45,209
violence and Narcissism
replace ra...

402
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:46,716
Shut up!

403
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,518
I hate this guy.

404
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:10,333
You're Clark.

405
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:12,035
Yes, I'm Clark.

406
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,306
I'm Tina, Carmine Sabatini's
only daughter.

407
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:17,405
Oh. I didn't know
that he had a daughter, only.

408
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:20,280
He does.
I'm her.

409
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,148
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

410
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,197
This is quite a house.
It's very European.

411
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:39,429
Can I get you something
to drink? Beer? Sprite?

412
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:41,437
Oh, no, thanks.

413
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:45,307
Jesus, look at that.

414
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:50,707
Wow. What a job they did.

415
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:54,011
- Job?
- Copying job. Yeah.

416
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,712
Down to the little cracks
and everything.

417
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:59,051
This isn't a copy.
This is it.

418
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:02,455
- Right.
- I'm very serious.

419
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:04,289
This has to be a copy, okay?

420
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:08,057
Do you remember
about ten years ago...

421
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,065
the original toured the country?

422
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:14,864
- It did?
- They brought it over from the Louvre.

423
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:18,338
- Who?
- I don't know who. They.'

424
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:21,637
It was in the United States
is my point.

425
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,644
And?

426
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,243
And it stayed here.

427
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:29,146
The one they shipped back to Paris...

428
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:31,209
the one behind
all that thick glass...

429
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:33,551
that all the tourists
take the pictures of...

430
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:35,146
that's the copy.

431
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:38,283
My dad thought
it was just awful...

432
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,761
such a masterpiece
behind all that thick glass.

433
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,856
And he had such a special feeling
for it...

434
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,061
his whole life.

435
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,035
Sort of an obsession, really.

436
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:51,436
So he ripped off the Mona Lisa?

437
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,736
The day it arrived here...

438
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,777
I was, like, nine.

439
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:59,439
My dad unwrapped it
outta this huge crate.

440
00:29:59,514 --> 00:30:03,975
There was Styrofoam
and newspaper everywhere.

441
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,783
And suddenly,
there it was.

442
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:10,984
And he turned to me...

443
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,993
I'll never forget this.

444
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:17,292
And he said...

445
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:19,127
Now I'm happy, sugar.

446
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:23,496
Now I got the Mona Lisa."

447
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:27,868
It's safe here in Queens?

448
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:38,314
People don't steal things
from my father.

449
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,249
- They don't?
- No.

450
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,881
Mona Lisa

451
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:47,118
Men have named you

452
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:48,956
You want to dance?

453
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:51,019
- Here?
- Here.

454
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:59,230
- It's kind of hot.
- Take your sweater off.

455
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:04,936
For that Mona Lisa strangeness

456
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:08,845
In your smile

457
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:12,476
Do you smile to tempt a lover

458
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:15,714
Mona Lisa

459
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:18,621
Or is this your way

460
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:22,854
To hide a broken heart

461
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:25,557
Many dreams

462
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:30,657
Have been brought to your doorstep

463
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:34,831
So my dad tells me
you're from Nebraska.

464
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:37,101
Vermont.

465
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:39,200
So what do you think
of New York?

466
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:41,906
I stopped thinking 24 hours ago.

467
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,913
I'm going on pure instinct.

468
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:51,944
Well, that's what you're
supposed to do in New York.

469
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:03,993
Is your father
in the house now?

470
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:05,467
No.

471
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:08,334
He's in the Bronx
at some meeting.

472
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:15,543
Aunt Angelina.

473
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,113
My head's killing me.
I gotta go to bed.

474
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:23,745
Aunt Angelina, this is Clark.
Remember, Dad mentioned?

475
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:27,017
- Who?
- Clark, the boy working for Dad.

476
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:31,049
I'm going to bed, watch Jeopardy.
You come up, Tina?

477
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:34,097
After Clark leaves.

478
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:35,653
Good night, Aunt Angelina.

479
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:38,327
Yeah, yeah. Night.

480
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:40,999
Dad's sister.

481
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,596
She moved in when my mother died.
I was four.

482
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,334
I was six.

483
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:49,310
- Your mom?
- No, my dad.

484
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:52,075
But it's never the same.

485
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:54,379
No, but what can you do?

486
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:56,644
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

487
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:02,389
I'll get you the keys to the car.

488
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:06,291
I'm a sophomore at the College
of the Sacred Virgin.

489
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:09,558
Don't laugh. Next year
I'm switching to Harvard.

490
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:12,794
Harvard?
Jesus, that's really something.

491
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:16,133
I didn't even bother applying there
with my grades in high school.

492
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:18,331
Not that they were terrible.

493
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:22,241
My grades are nothing special...
about a B-minus.

494
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,506
So how did you get in?

495
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:27,412
- Your boards must have been monsters.
- Oh, it's Dad.

496
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:29,608
He called Harvard
and said I wanted to go...

497
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:32,778
and they said,
Oh. Sure."

498
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:35,253
Wait a minute. Are we talking
about the same Harvard?

499
00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:37,916
The one that's in
Cambridge, Massachusetts?

500
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:41,018
Of course.
Harvard needs my dad, you know.

501
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:43,564
They don't want strikes
by the janitors...

502
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:45,963
or if they want the laundry done
and the gardening...

503
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:48,558
All those great
old trees and lawns.

504
00:33:48,636 --> 00:33:52,571
But he's an importer.
Right?

505
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,301
It's great meeting you, Clark.

506
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:59,869
A guy from Vermont,
real American, New Englandy."

507
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:03,576
Hold on. He's an importer.
Just tell me.

508
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:05,414
He's an importer, yes.

509
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:10,081
An extremely powerful importer.
There are such people.

510
00:34:10,156 --> 00:34:12,920
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

511
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:15,189
What am I picking up
at the airport?

512
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:17,987
Hint: It's pretty big.

513
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:21,362
- Bring someone to help you out.
- But what is it?

514
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:24,369
If Dad didn't tell you,
I can't really.

515
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:25,961
It's not going to be...

516
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,566
like, a dead guy in a box
or something, is it?

517
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:34,146
What an imagination!

518
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:41,115
You're so unbelievably cute.

519
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:44,122
I can't wait to see you again.
I could just eat you up.

520
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,428
Good luck tomorrow.

521
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:08,412
You boys need me?

522
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:12,983
Are you Leo?

523
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:16,544
- I am Big Leo.
- It just says Leo.

524
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:18,885
We are the same,
Leo and Big Leo.

525
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:20,821
You're synonymous.

526
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:23,292
That's right.

527
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:32,495
- Okay. Come with me.
- You don't bring it out?

528
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:35,904
No.
Not this I don't.

529
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:52,547
"Not this I don't."

530
00:35:52,622 --> 00:35:55,557
- Remember those words.
- Not very encouraging.

531
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,629
Here it is.
All yours.

532
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:05,632
It arrived this morning
on the red-eye from Borneo.

533
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,705
I'm gonna puke my guts out.

534
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:14,503
- What is it?
- A lizard.

535
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,511
That thing is a lizard?

536
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:19,104
Yeah. They call it
the Komodo dragon.

537
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:21,479
Makes its home
in Indonesia, Sumatra...

538
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,712
Komodo Island,
in point of fact.

539
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:26,847
By the way, tell Mr. Sabatini...

540
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:29,857
this cost him an extra eight bills
to get through.

541
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:34,191
- Excuse me?
- Just tell him. He'II understand.

542
00:36:34,262 --> 00:36:39,132
- Sign here by the "X," recipient.
- That's me.

543
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:40,965
That's you.
You're the recipient.

544
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:44,738
Put him in the back seat
with the windows open.

545
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:47,708
They got to have a lot of fresh air.
The gills or something.

546
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:50,768
He doesn't have any gills.

547
00:36:50,846 --> 00:36:55,010
Whatever. That's what I was told.
Fresh air.

548
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:57,984
And make sure you
get a seat belt on him.

549
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,077
If he jumps on you...

550
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:04,091
you got major troubles.

551
00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:09,059
Down boy.

552
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,621
- It's not a dog.
- Yeah. You know what?

553
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:16,670
We got to pick him up.

554
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:19,229
- Pick him up.
- Yeah.

555
00:37:19,307 --> 00:37:21,901
- With what?
- With our hands. Here.

556
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:24,638
It's not that bad, you know that?

557
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:27,509
I agreed to help, but I'm not
putting my life in danger...

558
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:31,915
- Help me out here.
- I'm sorry, but I refuse to handle it.

559
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:34,454
- I'm not trained.
- He's going under the truck.

560
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:36,456
All right.

561
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:41,384
- Get the door.
- You locked it, genius.

562
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,395
Right.

563
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,658
Will you take him?
Just take him for a second.

564
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,669
You're the recipient.

565
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:55,872
Hurry. If he stains me,
I'm gonna be pissed.

566
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:58,810
Could you take
any longer with this?

567
00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:00,813
Okay. All right.

568
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:09,846
Okay, now, you go around
and get in the other side.

569
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:12,256
Major trouble.

570
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:20,263
We got to put
the seat belt on him.

571
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:23,130
- You're joking.
- No, I am not joking.

572
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:26,068
This is obviously precious cargo,
this freaking thing.

573
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,969
Come on.

574
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,600
- Whoa, whoa. What seat belt?
- Put him in this one.

575
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,643
Okay. Got it.
Seat belt.

576
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:35,305
Get this under his armpit.

577
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:39,373
- What armpit?
- This is a lizard armpit. Put it in.

578
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:43,785
That lizard armpit.
I see. I didn't realize.

579
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,789
You know...

580
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,629
- I think he's okay.
- Let's go.

581
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,575
Happy as a clam.

582
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,275
I'm dying. Close the window.
Turn on the air conditioner.

583
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:12,510
- He said to leave them open.
- Who? Haystack Calhoun?

584
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:16,076
What is he, a zoologist?
I'll take full responsibility.

585
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,621
All right.

586
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,394
I told you he'd throw up.

587
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,099
My apologies.
I got to open the window. The stench!

588
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,104
It's murder.

589
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:40,175
Feeling better?
Tummy ache all gone?

590
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:47,083
- God, it stinks in here.
- I can't stand it.

591
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,084
We got to wash it out.
Pull over.

592
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,551
All right.

593
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,896
Excuse me.
Hello?

594
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:04,557
I need some water.
A hose.

595
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:06,396
Around the corner.
Help yourself.

596
00:40:06,468 --> 00:40:08,266
Thanks.
It's this way.

597
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,272
It's around the back.

598
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:21,340
He went under a car.

599
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:24,969
You go that way.

600
00:41:56,975 --> 00:42:00,536
Will the owner of the reptile
please report to the information booth.

601
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,279
Will the owner of the reptile...

602
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:11,322
- Don't panic.
- What if I can't find him?

603
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:14,791
Look. Leave the country.
Five, ten years, you come back.

604
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,328
You're kidding?
I'm serious!

605
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:39,411
Security to Concourse B.

606
00:42:39,483 --> 00:42:42,078
Security to Concourse B immediately.

607
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,219
Okay. Go.

608
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,020
Will the owner of the reptile
report to information.

609
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:26,892
Slowly.

610
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,898
I'm losing him.

611
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:33,969
Hey. Hold it. Yes.

612
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:38,506
I'm really afraid now.

613
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,935
Mr. London?

614
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:12,236
Edward?

615
00:44:12,874 --> 00:44:15,036
Oh, look!

616
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,736
It's here.
Finally.

617
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:20,447
Are you Edward?

618
00:44:20,515 --> 00:44:25,145
I am.
Oh, what a beautiful specimen!

619
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:32,592
Has this bad boy been swimming?

620
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:35,423
Gee. We wouldn't know.
We came right from the airport.

621
00:44:35,495 --> 00:44:38,726
They just love swimming pools.

622
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:40,734
But... chlorine.

623
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:48,937
I told him
he is very disobedient dragon.

624
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:52,538
For joke.

625
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:57,182
It's a good joke.
It's very unusual.

626
00:44:57,251 --> 00:44:59,878
Well, without humor,
what do we have?

627
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:14,566
Beautiful, yes?

628
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:17,569
This is like a zoo?

629
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:19,571
This is like a zoo.

630
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:24,109
Can you believe this?

631
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:29,114
So do you, like,
exhibit rare animals?

632
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,614
On occasion.

633
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:35,612
Who are these boys?

634
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:43,925
Carmine said one boy.
Here are two.

635
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,391
Young men,
this is Mr. Larry London.

636
00:45:51,671 --> 00:45:54,333
Mr. London,
I'm Clark Kellogg.

637
00:45:54,407 --> 00:45:59,036
Carmine said one boy.
Here are two.

638
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:04,178
Well, I realize that, sir.
Yes, we are two boys.

639
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,240
As you quite rightly point out.

640
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:12,078
However, since I'm
somewhat new to the area...

641
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:15,786
and this parcel...
this particular parcel was quite bulky.

642
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,623
So at the suggestion of Tina...

643
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:26,130
The beautiful Tina.

644
00:46:27,738 --> 00:46:29,535
Yes, the beautiful Tina.

645
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:34,236
Again, sir, if there was any
misunderstanding, I apologize.

646
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:38,771
Carmine said one boy,
and here are two.

647
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:44,351
Ya gotta like this guy.

648
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:48,681
Smells like basil.

649
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:50,954
Very good.

650
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:53,758
A cream basil sauce.

651
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:56,390
So you're actually a chef.

652
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,401
I wasn't clear what you did.

653
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:02,195
And now you'll get your money.

654
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,272
The money...

655
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:08,868
The money is conveyed...

656
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:11,937
in a brown paper bag.

657
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:20,454
Not very attractive, I know.

658
00:47:20,523 --> 00:47:21,855
That's fine, sir.

659
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:25,086
If it is in your nature to count it,
I will not be offended.

660
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,958
That won't be necessary.

661
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:30,497
I certainly trust you
and Mr. Sabatini.

662
00:47:38,206 --> 00:47:41,175
That means
my heart swims in blood."

663
00:47:49,818 --> 00:47:52,945
I believe that's a Bengal tiger,
ladies and gentlemen.

664
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,047
Something is way off.
Way off.

665
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:05,629
How are you, darling?
How's New York?

666
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:09,760
Oh, well, I miss you too,
like crazy.

667
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:14,172
At the risk of sounding like,
you know, a mother.

668
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:17,233
No, he's asleep,
thank God. Why?

669
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:21,610
Well, the thing is,
I got this job.

670
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,877
Will you listen?
New York is unbelievably expensive.

671
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:26,317
I had to.

672
00:48:26,387 --> 00:48:28,321
Well...

673
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:30,516
it mostly involved driving.

674
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:32,525
And...

675
00:48:32,594 --> 00:48:34,321
picking up this reptile.

676
00:48:34,394 --> 00:48:37,227
What kind of a reptile?
Clark, I don't...

677
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:39,697
It's a Komodo dragon.

678
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:43,167
Who? Komodo dragon?
I never heard of it.

679
00:48:43,236 --> 00:48:45,170
Would you look it up?

680
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:54,308
What?

681
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,780
- Komodo. Is that with a "K"?
- Right.

682
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:01,350
Koalamundi."

683
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:04,288
Kodiak."
Komodo dragon." Here we go.

684
00:49:04,357 --> 00:49:08,123
Latin name is
Varanus komodoensis.

685
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:11,254
Main prey are
deer and wild pig.

686
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:15,427
There are seven dragons
in zoos outside Indonesia."

687
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:18,230
- Oh, my God.
- What?

688
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:19,964
- Oh, Clark!
- What?

689
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:23,235
Chances for survival
are considered hopeless."

690
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:25,538
Clark, it's an endangered species.

691
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:30,049
Oh, my God.
Are you sure about this, Ma?

692
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,681
There's a red asterisk
next to it...

693
00:49:32,756 --> 00:49:35,691
which means virtually extinct.

694
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,388
- Clark, what is this job?
- Never mind. I'll quit.

695
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:41,523
The Komodo dragon.

696
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,296
No, don't worry.
Obviously, I didn't know.

697
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,447
That's him.

698
00:49:57,215 --> 00:49:58,807
You sure?

699
00:49:58,884 --> 00:50:02,718
Absolutely. That's
Dwight Armstrong's stepson.

700
00:50:02,788 --> 00:50:04,756
Unbelievable.

701
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:14,995
Is Mr. Sabatini here?

702
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:17,195
Yes. Come in.

703
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:19,205
Thank you.

704
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,532
Charlie,
wait a minute.

705
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:26,409
General Motors went down ten points,
and you didn't call me?

706
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:30,516
Oh. What about Polaroid?

707
00:50:32,953 --> 00:50:34,887
It went down?

708
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:37,314
Down one.

709
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:43,422
Hey, Charlie.

710
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,557
I told you before.

711
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:47,567
I don't like it
when they go down.

712
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,398
You know, I used to have
another broker...

713
00:50:53,475 --> 00:50:56,468
and he bought stocks for me,
and they went down...

714
00:50:56,545 --> 00:50:59,105
and I got
very unpleasant, Charlie.

715
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:03,312
Very unpleasant.

716
00:51:03,385 --> 00:51:07,185
So, wait a minute...
That's right.

717
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:13,228
That's right. So the next time
you call me, I want to hear good news.

718
00:51:14,464 --> 00:51:16,898
Right?
That's only good news.

719
00:51:20,238 --> 00:51:23,968
I must be getting soft.
I don't know... business.

720
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,168
You know, the business
in this country is run by children.

721
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:31,010
It's not men.
It's...

722
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:33,141
Anyway. Forget it.

723
00:51:33,217 --> 00:51:36,243
- How about a nice espresso?
- No, thank you.

724
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:42,060
Sir, I have to talk to you.

725
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:44,618
You know, I'm gonna
tell you something.

726
00:51:44,695 --> 00:51:48,063
Just before, Larry London called me,
he starts talking about you.

727
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:51,102
He couldn't stop
talking, talking, talking.

728
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,331
You know, went on and on.

729
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,069
Seems like
a very interesting man.

730
00:51:59,011 --> 00:52:01,377
I heard you had a little adventure
in the mall there.

731
00:52:01,446 --> 00:52:03,074
Oh, you did?

732
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:05,241
Of course.

733
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,919
So, all right, Clark.

734
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,082
What's on your mind?

735
00:52:12,158 --> 00:52:15,959
I have to talk to you.
It's about these... Thank you.

736
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:23,533
- It's about these reptiles.
- Yeah. What about them?

737
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:25,938
They're endangered.

738
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,077
Not anymore. They're in Jersey.
They'll do fine.

739
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,378
It's against the law
to take them into this country.

740
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:36,110
It's a crime.

741
00:52:37,185 --> 00:52:39,448
Now you're
speaking generalities.

742
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,322
You assured me my work here
was completely legitimate.

743
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:46,259
What are you talking about?
It's perfectly legitimate.

744
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,456
No, it's not.

745
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:52,023
I'm illegally transporting
endangered species.

746
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:55,400
Please, sir,
I'd like to be let out.

747
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,201
Wait a minute.

748
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,668
This is an impossibility.

749
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:05,904
- What do you mean? Why...
- Look, Clark.

750
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:09,613
I have a certain standing
in the business community.

751
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,416
How's it gonna look?

752
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:15,721
Young college kid gonna
make me look like a fool?

753
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:18,318
I mean, this is humiliation.

754
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,794
It's infamia.

755
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,594
You know what people
are gonna start saying?

756
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:26,502
What's wrong with him?"

757
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:28,834
You understand
what I'm talking about?

758
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,509
I would never tell a soul.

759
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:36,179
- It wouldn't leave this club.
- Wait a minute.

760
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:41,582
Are you trying
to hurt my feelings?

761
00:53:43,456 --> 00:53:46,118
No, no.
That's not the issue.

762
00:53:46,192 --> 00:53:50,184
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something
from my heart.

763
00:53:50,262 --> 00:53:54,324
You're a great boy.
You are one of a kind.

764
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,893
Thank you.

765
00:53:57,971 --> 00:54:02,738
No, really. The kind of kids I used to
have working for me were mooks.

766
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:06,404
Muscleheads.
But you...

767
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:08,310
You're from Connecticut.

768
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:13,376
It's nothing personal.
It's not you.

769
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:18,317
Well, in any discussion
about our relationship...

770
00:54:18,393 --> 00:54:22,090
we're not gonna forget about
the most important thing.

771
00:54:22,164 --> 00:54:25,292
- Which is?
- You're marrying my daughter.

772
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:31,128
You should have heard
Tina last night.

773
00:54:31,206 --> 00:54:34,300
Clark this, Clark that.
Daddy, Daddy."

774
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:36,344
She wants to get married
yesterday.

775
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:38,345
I tell her,
"You gotta wait till spring.

776
00:54:38,413 --> 00:54:40,848
You can't plan
these things overnight."

777
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:43,181
I mean, the food, the place,
the time of year.

778
00:54:43,252 --> 00:54:46,711
Who to invite, who not to invite.
That's important.

779
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:48,950
You got to figure,
well, let's see...

780
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:53,291
my business associates alone
must be 2,000 people.

781
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:58,264
And I'm not even talking about the
senators, the congressmen, the judges.

782
00:54:58,334 --> 00:55:00,165
And don't forget
the police department.

783
00:55:01,637 --> 00:55:04,607
But you know, love.
Love.

784
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:07,643
Love doesn't ask these questions,
am I right?

785
00:55:08,712 --> 00:55:10,043
Yeah.

786
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:12,448
I guess.

787
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:16,983
Come here.
I want you to come outside.

788
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:18,990
I got a little surprise
for you.

789
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:23,055
Come on. Come on.

790
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:27,190
Sir, I don't know where this talk
of marriage began...

791
00:55:27,265 --> 00:55:29,234
but I'm really not ready.

792
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:32,702
Id really like to sample life
a little first.

793
00:55:32,772 --> 00:55:34,535
Wait. No, wait.

794
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:36,905
After you get married,
you sample life.

795
00:55:36,976 --> 00:55:39,377
I mean, this is what men do.

796
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:41,436
Marriage is an institution.

797
00:55:41,514 --> 00:55:44,848
It's the bedrock of society.

798
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:49,150
What you're talking about
is a little va-voom.

799
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,156
This is self-understood.

800
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:55,227
But what I'm talking about
is social order.

801
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:58,264
Try to put yourself
in my position.

802
00:55:58,332 --> 00:56:02,529
I wish I could, Clarkie.
You're such a beautiful boy.

803
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:06,605
You know why
I'm so nuts about you?

804
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:08,539
- I don't, no.
- I'll tell you.

805
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:11,340
Because you're not a snake.

806
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,973
You come down here
to my club.

807
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:16,176
You open your heart to me.

808
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:18,845
You say whatever's
on your mind.

809
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,721
That's how I know
you're not gonna be a snake.

810
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:25,624
A snake in the grass.

811
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:29,061
That's how I know
you're gonna be loyal to me...

812
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:31,657
until death.

813
00:56:34,103 --> 00:56:36,571
Like a real son.

814
00:56:36,638 --> 00:56:38,574
Oh, I don't know.

815
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:41,543
The son I never had.

816
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:03,797
Come on.

817
00:57:03,868 --> 00:57:06,564
I got a little engagement present
for you.

818
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:11,076
- It's not much, but it's from my heart.
- This is for me?

819
00:57:11,143 --> 00:57:12,803
Who's the world's
luckiest guy?

820
00:57:18,718 --> 00:57:21,653
Why don't you go
take it for a little spin?

821
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,656
Go pick up Tina.
She's waiting for you at school.

822
00:57:26,058 --> 00:57:28,925
- L...
- No, no. I understand.

823
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:32,963
Sometimes in life...

824
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:36,866
these emotions are beyond...
beyond words.

825
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:38,871
Go ahead. Vic.

826
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:49,807
College of the Sacred Virgin in Queens.
The address is in the glove compartment.

827
00:57:50,952 --> 00:57:52,886
Let's move it.

828
00:57:55,656 --> 00:57:57,590
He kissed me
on the mouth.

829
00:57:59,126 --> 00:58:01,687
You know how big this is?

830
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:04,722
The kiss of all kisses.

831
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:07,666
That's the highest!
You're in now for life.

832
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:11,502
It's like we're brothers.
God bless you and keep you.

833
00:58:14,109 --> 00:58:17,476
Anything goes wrong with that car,
we'll get you another one.

834
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,482
You have fun.

835
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,492
Say when.

836
00:59:05,163 --> 00:59:06,390
When.

837
00:59:33,226 --> 00:59:35,388
Screw this.

838
00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:42,833
Turn right.
Turn right! Right!

839
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:53,844
Hes parking?

840
00:59:53,915 --> 00:59:55,644
Hello!

841
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,464
Whoa!

842
01:00:22,846 --> 01:00:24,780
We need an ambulance.

843
01:00:28,385 --> 01:00:31,047
I want this to be
the perfect wedding.

844
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:34,557
I really want it to be
very conventional. Old-fashioned.

845
01:00:34,624 --> 01:00:35,989
Tina.

846
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:39,220
We have to talk.

847
01:00:39,297 --> 01:00:42,323
Clark, this is Father Frank
of the music department.

848
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,493
We were just discussing music
for the wedding.

849
01:00:44,569 --> 01:00:46,628
I was thinking
of the Ave Maria."

850
01:00:46,705 --> 01:00:48,672
Would you excuse us?

851
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:51,800
Of course,
and congratulations, my son.

852
01:00:51,876 --> 01:00:54,243
Thank you, Father.

853
01:00:54,313 --> 01:00:56,781
- You're hurting my arm.
- I'm a little tense.

854
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:59,374
I was just
in a high-speed car chase.

855
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:02,079
- And?
- No and."

856
01:01:02,154 --> 01:01:05,351
Maybe these things are part
of your everyday life, but not mine.

857
01:01:05,424 --> 01:01:08,292
There are people after me now,
flashing their lights.

858
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:12,161
- Obviously, I have to get away.
- Oh, it's part of a working day.

859
01:01:12,232 --> 01:01:15,429
- It is not!
- You made a commitment to my father.

860
01:01:15,502 --> 01:01:17,436
Nobody forced you.

861
01:01:17,504 --> 01:01:21,031
This is beyond commitment.
This is like slavery.

862
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:22,938
People telling me
who to marry!

863
01:01:23,978 --> 01:01:28,505
- You don't wanna marry me?
- I don't want to marry anybody yet!

864
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:31,179
So we'll wait.

865
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:34,847
We don't have to rush
into anything, darling.

866
01:01:34,922 --> 01:01:37,448
As long as you're
waiting for me...

867
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:40,723
and you're part of the family...
which you are, permanently.

868
01:01:40,796 --> 01:01:42,525
What is with this "permanently"?

869
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:46,397
Your father kissed me on the mouth.
Vic says I'm in for life.

870
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:48,403
- You are.
- I'm not!

871
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:54,568
It's all a fluke.
I got ripped off by this guy Vic.

872
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:58,044
I caught up to him.
What?

873
01:01:58,113 --> 01:02:01,742
You think it was an accident
that you, quote, caught up to him."

874
01:02:03,151 --> 01:02:06,246
You were chosen, Clark.

875
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:09,156
You were handpicked.

876
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,626
And it is like
the greatest honor.

877
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:13,629
What are you talking about?

878
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:16,564
My cousin Vic has always
had great instincts about people.

879
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,901
He saw you where?
Grand Central?

880
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,074
It was a setup
from the beginning?

881
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:27,735
Setup" is so negative.

882
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:30,804
There are so many levels
to this thing.

883
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:33,179
I just want my life back!

884
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,811
I can't talk to you
when you're so hysterical.

885
01:02:38,257 --> 01:02:39,689
What is the deal,
please?

886
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:42,157
Am I some dupe?

887
01:02:42,227 --> 01:02:45,789
They looked through the Putney yearbook
and said, Oh, here's a chump."

888
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:47,890
Are you serious?

889
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,628
A dupe?

890
01:02:49,702 --> 01:02:52,034
You think
I'd be marrying a dupe?

891
01:02:53,572 --> 01:02:56,370
Everybody's talking
about the job you're doing.

892
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:58,604
It's all over town.

893
01:02:58,678 --> 01:03:02,044
Larry London called my father.

894
01:03:02,114 --> 01:03:03,980
Said how bright you were...

895
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:06,541
how gentle...

896
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:08,555
how perceptive.

897
01:03:08,623 --> 01:03:11,250
If you weren't
all those things...

898
01:03:11,324 --> 01:03:15,454
would Vic be out this afternoon
getting you a gun permit?

899
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:18,332
I don't need a gun permit!

900
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:22,096
You have to have one
if you carry a gun.

901
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:24,637
Clark, people are chasing you.

902
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,138
That's quite a story.
Charming.

903
01:03:29,377 --> 01:03:32,472
Well, I can't take it
quite so lightly.

904
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:35,538
No. It has a real
film noir quality.

905
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:37,608
Smuggling lizards
into New Jersey.

906
01:03:37,686 --> 01:03:40,814
I mean, if it was done right...
black-and-white...

907
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:44,655
grainy... sort of
a Kiss Me Deadly feeling.

908
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:46,853
It's not a film idea.
It's my actual life.

909
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:52,027
Life and art are the same
when perceived through the twin lenses...

910
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:54,928
Clark Kellogg.

911
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:57,904
Mr. Kellogg,
I'm Chuck Greenwald.

912
01:03:57,974 --> 01:03:59,407
This is Lloyd Simpson.

913
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:02,034
We're from the Department
of Justice...

914
01:04:02,111 --> 01:04:04,272
Fish and Wildlife Division.

915
01:04:04,347 --> 01:04:06,282
We've been trying to reach you.

916
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:09,619
This is what
I've been talking about.

917
01:04:09,688 --> 01:04:11,746
I know nothing about it.

918
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:15,850
We were discussing a film project.
Oh, God. I'm running late.

919
01:04:15,926 --> 01:04:18,861
Excuse me, please.

920
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,363
Mr. Kellogg.

921
01:04:28,272 --> 01:04:30,901
So this is actually
a federal office?

922
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:34,343
We're undercover,
Mr. Kellogg.

923
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,745
Special agents.

924
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:38,977
Well, I think
I better contact a lawyer.

925
01:04:39,051 --> 01:04:40,484
That's your privilege.

926
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:43,420
You have a lawyer?

927
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:45,013
My stepfather,
I guess.

928
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:51,587
- What?
- Your stepfather turned you in.

929
01:04:51,665 --> 01:04:54,133
My stepfather?

930
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,397
How the hell
did he know about this?

931
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,463
Mr. Kellogg, I believe you know
a Carmine Sabatini...

932
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:04,499
also known as Jimmy the Toucan.

933
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:09,106
Toucan I never heard.
My stepfather?

934
01:05:09,183 --> 01:05:13,313
Do you know a Mr. Hans Kurt Schlegel,
alias Larry London?

935
01:05:15,556 --> 01:05:17,990
We've met.
I wouldn't say that I know him.

936
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,119
These men are fiends...

937
01:05:21,195 --> 01:05:25,393
and it's up to you to end
their unspeakable activities.

938
01:05:25,466 --> 01:05:27,400
I don't know
what you're talking about.

939
01:05:27,468 --> 01:05:31,461
Have you ever heard mention
of the Gourmet Club?

940
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:37,072
Sabatini and Schlegel established
the Gourmet Club operation...

941
01:05:37,147 --> 01:05:39,081
in 1985.

942
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:42,846
It's a movable feast.
Never the same location twice.

943
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:44,944
Dinner is served
every three to six months...

944
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:47,251
depending on the catch.

945
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,915
There are no prices.

946
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:51,790
The minimum price
for eating at this club...

947
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:53,795
is $200,000 per plate.

948
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:55,626
For dinner?

949
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:58,132
Not just dinner,
Mr. Kellogg.

950
01:05:58,202 --> 01:06:01,728
The entire menu
consists of endangered species.

951
01:06:02,906 --> 01:06:04,737
They cook these animals?

952
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:07,244
They cook these animals,
yes, sir...

953
01:06:07,312 --> 01:06:09,871
for an international
clientele of degenerates...

954
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:11,711
scum, Euro-trash.

955
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:16,187
And people pay $200,000
to eat these animals?

956
01:06:16,253 --> 01:06:17,618
Minimum.

957
01:06:17,689 --> 01:06:21,216
The more endangered the species,
the higher the price tag.

958
01:06:21,293 --> 01:06:23,693
If there are five or less
in the world...

959
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:26,697
the entree goes up
to half a million.

960
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:29,928
For the privilege of eating
the last of a species?

961
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:31,764
A cool million.

962
01:06:31,837 --> 01:06:35,070
The dragon will go
for about 350 a plate.

963
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:38,908
It'll be served off the bone
with a cream basil sauce.

964
01:06:38,979 --> 01:06:41,311
That's Schlegel's trademark.

965
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:45,249
If they fillet it... Schlegel
likes to fillet. We know that.

966
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:48,481
They can get 60 servings
out of one dragon.

967
01:06:48,554 --> 01:06:51,547
That's a $20 million haul.

968
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:56,355
I don't believe
Mr. Sabatini would do that.

969
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:59,558
Who do you think he is?
Bishop Tutu?

970
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:01,260
I just don't believe
he'd do that.

971
01:07:01,335 --> 01:07:05,898
Believe it! I want Sabatini
before they serve that poor animal.

972
01:07:05,974 --> 01:07:10,707
Just tell us where
they're gonna serve it and when.

973
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:12,804
You're asking me
to be an informer.

974
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:16,147
Be an informer
or spend two years in Leavenworth.

975
01:07:16,218 --> 01:07:18,914
You'd lock me up
for two years?

976
01:07:18,988 --> 01:07:21,148
I sure would...

977
01:07:21,222 --> 01:07:23,191
unless you give us the old man.

978
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:31,499
Well, I got to think about it.

979
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:46,573
There's a kind of freedom
in being completely screwed...

980
01:08:46,647 --> 01:08:49,445
because you know things
can't get any worse.

981
01:08:56,223 --> 01:08:59,022
Clark, you can't just split.

982
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,254
Really?
What would you do?

983
01:09:01,328 --> 01:09:04,093
I would probably turn him in
and hate myself.

984
01:09:04,165 --> 01:09:06,531
You could do that?

985
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:08,535
I don't know.

986
01:09:18,748 --> 01:09:22,514
I'm looking for Clark Kellogg.
Is he in one of these rooms?

987
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:27,387
He's here. Come in.
Yes, he's here.

988
01:09:27,457 --> 01:09:29,220
Oh.

989
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:34,864
Clark mentioned something...

990
01:09:34,931 --> 01:09:37,457
but I had no idea
that the resemblance...

991
01:09:37,535 --> 01:09:39,934
This is Steve Bushak,
my roommate.

992
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:41,937
- This is Mr. Sabatini.
- My pleasure, sir.

993
01:09:42,006 --> 01:09:44,031
I was wondering...

994
01:09:44,108 --> 01:09:46,201
if you could leave us alone?

995
01:09:46,277 --> 01:09:48,904
I want to talk
to my son-in-law.

996
01:09:50,347 --> 01:09:52,316
I'd really like to stay,
if that's okay.

997
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:54,909
I'll be quiet
as a mouse.

998
01:09:54,986 --> 01:09:56,977
If you could leave us alone...

999
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:58,955
I'd really appreciate it.

1000
01:09:59,023 --> 01:10:01,890
Say no more.
I'll get shoes and be on my way.

1001
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,453
Could you do that outside?
I have some...

1002
01:10:05,532 --> 01:10:08,762
Outside?
I always do that. Yeah.

1003
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:10,803
It's nothing.
Go ahead.

1004
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:15,797
Sit down, Clark.
I want to ask you something.

1005
01:10:19,512 --> 01:10:21,605
You followed me,
didn't you?

1006
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:23,512
Followed you?

1007
01:10:25,117 --> 01:10:26,676
A little bit this evening.

1008
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:34,753
You know, Clark,
I know when somebody's following me.

1009
01:10:34,829 --> 01:10:37,821
I left the club,
and you were around someplace.

1010
01:10:37,898 --> 01:10:41,197
On the street, in a doorway.
Someplace.

1011
01:10:42,269 --> 01:10:46,331
Because I feel these things,
you know?

1012
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,176
Is this true?

1013
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:51,804
Yes.

1014
01:10:54,148 --> 01:10:56,583
- I had a lot on my mind.
- No, no.

1015
01:10:56,651 --> 01:11:00,052
You don't have to explain.
This... You know.

1016
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:07,961
- Looks like you're ready for bed.
- Soon.

1017
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:11,227
Clark, want me to read you
a bedtime story?

1018
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,097
Sir?

1019
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:14,603
Tina used to love...

1020
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,434
Curious George the monkey.

1021
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:21,876
Every night I told her
a different story.

1022
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,606
Curious George goes there.

1023
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:30,081
Yeah, she knew them all by heart.

1024
01:11:30,154 --> 01:11:33,145
I think that my real father
used to read me those.

1025
01:11:33,223 --> 01:11:38,025
Who was the guy who used to
take care of Curious George?

1026
01:11:38,096 --> 01:11:39,859
His keeper.

1027
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:44,027
Oh, yeah.
You mean the Man in the Yellow Hat?

1028
01:11:44,102 --> 01:11:47,435
The Man with the Yellow Hat.
Jesus.

1029
01:11:48,406 --> 01:11:51,933
Is this...
Is this your real dad?

1030
01:11:52,011 --> 01:11:54,070
Uh-huh.

1031
01:11:54,146 --> 01:11:56,204
And that's me
when I was three.

1032
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,584
I was six when he died.

1033
01:12:00,652 --> 01:12:02,586
Motorcycle accident.

1034
01:12:05,025 --> 01:12:06,959
What kind of business
was he in?

1035
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:10,861
He was a poet.
He taught English at the Putney School.

1036
01:12:12,132 --> 01:12:15,329
You know any of his poems?

1037
01:12:15,402 --> 01:12:17,336
A few of them.

1038
01:12:17,404 --> 01:12:20,100
- Could you tell me one?
- One of his poems?

1039
01:12:20,173 --> 01:12:21,868
Yeah.

1040
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:26,311
I mean, just tell me
a little short one.

1041
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:29,941
There's one that I like called
A Doorway on Boylston Street."

1042
01:12:30,016 --> 01:12:31,608
You know, in Boston?

1043
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:36,386
Well, it's...

1044
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,858
It's been a while
since I did it out loud.

1045
01:12:38,927 --> 01:12:40,861
All right.

1046
01:12:42,965 --> 01:12:46,400
"There's a certain doorway
on Boylston Street...

1047
01:12:46,468 --> 01:12:49,699
That I passed by on foot...

1048
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:52,069
Suited and shod.

1049
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,870
One of many, each Tuesday...

1050
01:12:54,943 --> 01:12:56,935
Toward lunch with a certain woman...

1051
01:12:57,012 --> 01:13:00,709
Regarded each Tuesday...

1052
01:13:00,782 --> 01:13:04,151
By the perfect turning gaze...

1053
01:13:04,221 --> 01:13:06,916
of a white Persian...

1054
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:10,256
Regarding me, love-bound...

1055
01:13:10,327 --> 01:13:13,194
Sped by desire...

1056
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,199
And returning
to the certainty of his fur."

1057
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:21,535
This is the cat
in the doorway?

1058
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,539
Yeah.

1059
01:13:27,044 --> 01:13:30,104
The certainty of his fur."

1060
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,772
You liked it?

1061
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:34,546
I like it very much.

1062
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,282
Very much. I like...

1063
01:13:37,356 --> 01:13:41,292
I like especially the fact
that you remember his poem.

1064
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:48,164
Well, you know...

1065
01:13:48,234 --> 01:13:50,202
that's all I wanted to say, really.

1066
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,237
And if there's...

1067
01:13:54,307 --> 01:13:57,743
anything you have to tell me...

1068
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,836
l... I know that you will.

1069
01:14:02,884 --> 01:14:04,316
Yes.

1070
01:14:05,586 --> 01:14:07,850
You know, Clark,
you told me before...

1071
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:09,855
that you wanted to quit your job...

1072
01:14:09,924 --> 01:14:14,622
and if that's what you want,
it's all right.

1073
01:14:14,695 --> 01:14:16,560
I'm gonna miss you.

1074
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:18,564
But...

1075
01:14:20,702 --> 01:14:23,193
It's all right.
Get a good sleep.

1076
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:25,771
Well, good night.

1077
01:14:30,645 --> 01:14:34,275
So this is college.

1078
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,285
I didn't miss nothing.

1079
01:15:03,848 --> 01:15:07,784
There's a plane waiting
to take us to Miami in an hour.

1080
01:15:07,852 --> 01:15:11,549
Don't make a big thing about it.

1081
01:15:14,058 --> 01:15:16,618
I know it was you, Fredo.

1082
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:19,289
You broke my heart.

1083
01:15:19,364 --> 01:15:21,298
You broke my heart.

1084
01:15:35,515 --> 01:15:39,611
"It was you, Fredo."
A moment of epiphany.

1085
01:15:39,686 --> 01:15:43,417
Michael Corleone kisses his brother
full on the lips.

1086
01:15:43,489 --> 01:15:48,950
An astonishing image, at once suggestive
of love, inversion, power.

1087
01:15:49,029 --> 01:15:52,657
And in this world of duplicity
and corruption...

1088
01:15:52,732 --> 01:15:56,566
is there anything finally
more important than loyalty?

1089
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,901
- No.
- To friends?

1090
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:01,303
To family?

1091
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,504
And who deserves our loyalty?

1092
01:16:04,579 --> 01:16:06,137
Yeah?

1093
01:16:06,214 --> 01:16:09,274
Sir, I just need Clark Kellogg
for a second.

1094
01:16:09,349 --> 01:16:12,683
Oh, you just need Clark Kellogg
for a second?

1095
01:16:12,754 --> 01:16:15,985
And why, may I ask, is it so urgent
that you see Mr. Kellogg?

1096
01:16:16,057 --> 01:16:19,424
I'm Carmine Sabatini's
daughter Tina.

1097
01:16:20,361 --> 01:16:21,794
Jimmy the Toucan?

1098
01:16:21,863 --> 01:16:24,195
Nobody really calls him that.
Clark?

1099
01:16:24,265 --> 01:16:26,699
Just one second,
I swear.

1100
01:16:28,904 --> 01:16:30,371
Up, up, Mr. Kellogg.

1101
01:16:30,438 --> 01:16:32,601
I'll be right back.

1102
01:16:32,675 --> 01:16:37,374
No hurry, Mr. Kellogg. I'm really
quite impressed. Jimmy the Toucan?

1103
01:16:37,446 --> 01:16:41,678
Yes, he's quite
a remarkable person.

1104
01:16:41,751 --> 01:16:44,778
Yes, I'm sure he is.
Can I meet him?

1105
01:16:44,854 --> 01:16:47,516
I'd say that's a long shot.

1106
01:16:50,393 --> 01:16:53,089
My father thinks that Clark
is an A" student.

1107
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:56,132
Yes, he's a very fine young man.

1108
01:16:56,199 --> 01:17:00,226
- An "A" student.
- Yes, absolutely. A-plus.

1109
01:17:00,304 --> 01:17:02,238
Have a wonderful time.

1110
01:17:02,307 --> 01:17:05,332
Give my best to your dad.

1111
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,502
Jimmy the Toucan!

1112
01:17:07,578 --> 01:17:09,444
Are you out of your skull,
threatening Fleeber?

1113
01:17:09,515 --> 01:17:12,415
- Hey! I was helping you.
- I don't need your help here.

1114
01:17:12,483 --> 01:17:14,417
- Fine. So I wont.
- Fine.

1115
01:17:16,455 --> 01:17:19,322
Where are we going anyway?
Huh?

1116
01:17:58,165 --> 01:18:00,599
Vic waved.

1117
01:18:00,668 --> 01:18:02,296
That's nice.

1118
01:18:12,013 --> 01:18:14,608
Everybody skate.
Come on.

1119
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:24,053
Sir, we have to talk.

1120
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,492
Pull them off.
We got to talk?

1121
01:18:26,562 --> 01:18:30,190
Yes, yes, we do.
I have important things to bring up.

1122
01:18:30,265 --> 01:18:34,067
- Do you have the clothes?
- They're in the locker room.

1123
01:18:34,137 --> 01:18:36,935
I want you to get the clothes
and change...

1124
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:40,101
and then you'll drive us out.

1125
01:18:40,177 --> 01:18:42,111
- Pull them off.
- Drive us out where?

1126
01:18:44,314 --> 01:18:47,681
We're going to the Gourmet Club.
This is Friday.

1127
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:49,810
Sir, I have to talk
to you first.

1128
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:52,617
We gotta go.
We'll talk in the car.

1129
01:18:52,689 --> 01:18:54,658
- You promise?
- Every word I say...

1130
01:18:54,725 --> 01:18:58,821
by definition, is a promise.

1131
01:18:58,896 --> 01:19:00,831
Come on.

1132
01:19:04,936 --> 01:19:09,703
The idea of driving a Porsche had always
been appealing to me until now.

1133
01:19:17,116 --> 01:19:19,346
- Do you ever read Newsweek?
- Sometimes.

1134
01:19:19,418 --> 01:19:24,014
I'm very, very worried
about this ozone business.

1135
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:26,785
I'm really very concerned.

1136
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:29,419
Sir, I have to talk to you.

1137
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:31,192
Yeah, I know you do.

1138
01:19:31,265 --> 01:19:34,256
You wanted to talk to me
last night but couldn't do it.

1139
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:36,269
I knew it'd take about a day.

1140
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:40,698
There's federal officers
after me.

1141
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:42,902
Did you get their names?

1142
01:19:42,977 --> 01:19:45,035
Greenwald and Simpson.

1143
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:47,773
They said they'd put me in jail
for two years...

1144
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:50,442
unless I led them
to the Gourmet Club.

1145
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:54,010
No. They're not gonna
send you to jail.

1146
01:19:54,088 --> 01:19:57,489
- They're not?
- They're gonna blow your brains out.

1147
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:03,056
I just want to say you gentlemen
have done an outstanding job.

1148
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:06,464
Thank you.
We appreciate it.

1149
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:09,903
These two guys
work for the Bonelli family...

1150
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:12,031
and they work
out of South Amboy.

1151
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:15,475
- Not for the government?
- They work for the government...

1152
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:18,673
but they're on the take
from the Bonellis.

1153
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:21,342
Staggering, isn't it, Clark?
The corruption.

1154
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:23,385
Yeah, the corruption is...

1155
01:20:23,453 --> 01:20:25,751
Look at him,
driving around with mobsters.

1156
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:28,154
A college kid.
Very upsetting.

1157
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:31,194
So these guys are after you...

1158
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:33,354
for the Bonellis...

1159
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:37,958
and they just used me,
and once they get you...

1160
01:20:38,035 --> 01:20:40,197
They're gonna hit you.

1161
01:20:40,271 --> 01:20:42,329
Oh, my God.
This is terrible.

1162
01:20:42,406 --> 01:20:44,340
That's the way it's done.

1163
01:20:44,408 --> 01:20:48,106
I'm sorry I got you
into this mess, but...

1164
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:51,204
you're in it,
and we'll get you out of it.

1165
01:20:51,282 --> 01:20:53,079
My God.

1166
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:54,880
He had a way out of this:

1167
01:20:54,953 --> 01:20:58,354
A high-risk plan designed to entrap
Greenwald and Simpson...

1168
01:20:58,423 --> 01:21:02,622
and get him out of the endangered
species racket forever.

1169
01:21:02,695 --> 01:21:06,859
Hint: It involved using me
and the lizard as bait.

1170
01:21:06,932 --> 01:21:09,162
This was to be the final dinner...

1171
01:21:09,235 --> 01:21:11,169
of the fabulous Gourmet Club.

1172
01:21:27,854 --> 01:21:29,787
Tequila!

1173
01:22:01,391 --> 01:22:03,086
Ladies and gentlemen...

1174
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:07,255
your cohost for this evening,
Mr. Carmine Sabatini.

1175
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:12,629
With Carmine are
his beautiful daughter, Tina...

1176
01:22:12,702 --> 01:22:14,932
and her fianc,
Mr. Clark Kellogg...

1177
01:22:15,004 --> 01:22:16,869
from the great state of Montana.

1178
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,534
Let's have
a nice Gourmet Club welcome...

1179
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:22,601
for Carmine
and the happy couple.

1180
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:39,889
Tequila!

1181
01:22:41,065 --> 01:22:43,000
Want to hand me that, please?

1182
01:22:53,078 --> 01:22:54,841
Ladies and gentlemen.

1183
01:22:54,913 --> 01:22:58,212
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1184
01:22:58,283 --> 01:23:00,981
The moment that makes
the Gourmet Club...

1185
01:23:01,053 --> 01:23:03,146
the special place
that it is.

1186
01:23:03,222 --> 01:23:07,181
Our main course,
served for the very last time...

1187
01:23:07,261 --> 01:23:10,128
on this our planet Earth:

1188
01:23:10,197 --> 01:23:12,961
Your Komodo dragon.

1189
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:20,872
Oh, there he is

1190
01:23:20,941 --> 01:23:25,640
Your Komodo dragon

1191
01:23:25,712 --> 01:23:27,680
Yes, there he is

1192
01:23:27,748 --> 01:23:30,912
One of eight

1193
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:35,315
With so many species

1194
01:23:35,391 --> 01:23:37,154
He took the town by storm

1195
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:40,889
With his continental taste and charm

1196
01:23:40,963 --> 01:23:43,931
Go into this cornfield.
It's deserted.

1197
01:23:43,999 --> 01:23:47,491
Moments from the end he is

1198
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:52,507
Your Komodo dragon

1199
01:23:58,948 --> 01:24:00,143
Good.

1200
01:24:00,217 --> 01:24:02,742
I'll take a Rob Roy
with a twist.

1201
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:04,787
Diet Coke.

1202
01:24:05,856 --> 01:24:08,380
Did my uncle
bring you up to date?

1203
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:12,486
Yeah. We're all going to be killed
by Greenwald and Simpson.

1204
01:24:12,562 --> 01:24:16,192
They're part of the Bonelli family
out of South Amboy.

1205
01:24:16,267 --> 01:24:17,791
That's stretching a little.

1206
01:24:17,867 --> 01:24:19,801
There's a chance
we'll all be killed.

1207
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:21,928
It's not like a lock.

1208
01:24:22,006 --> 01:24:25,134
The thing to do
is to get you adequately prepared.

1209
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,684
- It's an Italian passport.
- Open it up.

1210
01:24:40,058 --> 01:24:42,926
Is that a piece of work
or what?

1211
01:24:42,996 --> 01:24:46,295
What is this?
Rodolfo Lasparri?"

1212
01:24:46,365 --> 01:24:49,027
Clark, I gotta tell you.

1213
01:24:49,101 --> 01:24:52,196
The odds are good we'll be on a plane
to Palermo, Sicily...

1214
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:54,671
tonight at midnight,
if we're still walking.

1215
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,674
I don't want to go
to Palermo, Sicily!

1216
01:24:56,743 --> 01:24:59,337
- Have you ever been there?
- No, of course not!

1217
01:24:59,412 --> 01:25:02,644
Then you can't make
an informed judgment, Rodolfo.

1218
01:25:02,716 --> 01:25:06,447
I'm not going!
I can't take it anymore!

1219
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,421
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life hiding!

1220
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:12,891
- I want this resolved already!
- You do?

1221
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,053
Yes!

1222
01:25:15,095 --> 01:25:17,963
Why are you smiling?

1223
01:25:18,032 --> 01:25:20,558
Because as usual,
my uncle Carmine was right.

1224
01:25:22,136 --> 01:25:25,004
You're ready.
You're ready for Freddy.

1225
01:25:26,174 --> 01:25:29,371
What does this mean,
ready for Freddy"?

1226
01:25:30,812 --> 01:25:35,943
It means it's show time. In two minutes
you go outside and signal the Feds.

1227
01:25:38,654 --> 01:25:40,315
What the hell is that for?

1228
01:25:40,389 --> 01:25:44,826
Fish and Wildlife does not mean
we're social workers, Mr. Armstrong.

1229
01:25:47,496 --> 01:25:50,431
Ladies and gentlemen,
your cohost for this evening...

1230
01:25:50,499 --> 01:25:53,128
Mr. Larry London!

1231
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:58,237
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1232
01:26:05,115 --> 01:26:08,347
This is a very special evening
for all of us...

1233
01:26:08,419 --> 01:26:11,013
for tonight you will eat...

1234
01:26:11,089 --> 01:26:13,853
one of only eight Komodo dragons...

1235
01:26:13,925 --> 01:26:17,053
left in the entire world.

1236
01:26:21,065 --> 01:26:23,795
Which is why it has been priced...

1237
01:26:23,868 --> 01:26:28,773
at, uh, $350,000 a plate,
service included!

1238
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:34,204
Thank you for paying in advance.

1239
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,214
Without these monies...

1240
01:26:39,953 --> 01:26:41,614
Smells good.

1241
01:26:41,688 --> 01:26:43,781
I want you to take half of it...

1242
01:26:43,857 --> 01:26:46,792
and put the rest in the steamer.

1243
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,693
- Right.
- Go ahead.

1244
01:27:00,374 --> 01:27:03,936
I think he wants you
to help him with the dragon.

1245
01:27:04,012 --> 01:27:05,410
Okay.

1246
01:27:06,948 --> 01:27:10,280
Good luck. Not that you'll need it.
Everybody has such confidence.

1247
01:27:13,255 --> 01:27:18,715
Well, I ain't gonna work
on Maggie's farm no more

1248
01:27:20,829 --> 01:27:23,024
No, I ain't gonna work

1249
01:27:23,098 --> 01:27:26,898
On Maggie's farm no more

1250
01:27:31,407 --> 01:27:33,774
Well, I wake up in the morning

1251
01:27:33,844 --> 01:27:36,312
Fold my hands and pray for rain

1252
01:27:36,379 --> 01:27:41,112
Got a head full of ideas
and they're driving me insane

1253
01:27:58,503 --> 01:28:00,869
The kid is signaling us.

1254
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,463
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

1255
01:28:05,543 --> 01:28:09,240
My heart was pounding
as I crossed the dance floor.

1256
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:12,545
In a few minutes
I would be free or dead...

1257
01:28:12,617 --> 01:28:15,882
or Rodolfo Lasparri
of Palermo, Sicily.

1258
01:28:15,954 --> 01:28:18,650
It was all up to me now.

1259
01:28:18,723 --> 01:28:20,918
The show was about to begin.

1260
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:53,589
The lizard looked even more nervous
than I was.

1261
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,594
We were in the same boat.

1262
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,311
All right.
Everybody out.

1263
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:12,312
Get out.

1264
01:29:41,044 --> 01:29:42,910
Give me that dragon!

1265
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:46,642
Freeze! Department of Justice,
Division of Fish and Wildlife!

1266
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:50,209
Carmine Sabatini and Hans Kurt Schlegel,
you're under arrest.

1267
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:52,847
- What's the charge?
- Illegal importation...

1268
01:29:52,924 --> 01:29:57,384
and attempted slaughter
of Varanus komodoensis.

1269
01:29:57,462 --> 01:30:01,592
Also known as the Komodo dragon.
It's over, old man.

1270
01:30:01,666 --> 01:30:03,566
- You betrayed me.
- No!

1271
01:30:03,636 --> 01:30:07,367
Yeah, you betrayed me.
Stand back!

1272
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,464
Drop it, or I'll blow your nose off.

1273
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:11,305
Sir!

1274
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:14,604
- How could you do this?
- Sir, you're wrong!

1275
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,614
Sir...

1276
01:30:19,852 --> 01:30:21,342
Don't.

1277
01:30:27,795 --> 01:30:30,524
- Sir!
- Oh, kid.

1278
01:30:30,597 --> 01:30:34,363
- Sir!
- Oh, God. Carmine.

1279
01:30:44,612 --> 01:30:46,705
I had no choice.

1280
01:30:46,781 --> 01:30:50,978
- You all saw that.
- You had no choice. It was fate.

1281
01:30:51,051 --> 01:30:54,715
No matter how you're feeling, kid,
you're a hero.

1282
01:30:59,428 --> 01:31:01,555
- I'm numb.
- Cigarette?

1283
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:05,998
Oh, yeah.
I'd love one.

1284
01:31:07,836 --> 01:31:09,600
I had real feelings for him.

1285
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,299
I'm sure you did.

1286
01:31:11,373 --> 01:31:15,207
A technical matter...
the money.

1287
01:31:15,278 --> 01:31:17,212
We need it for evidence.

1288
01:31:18,614 --> 01:31:21,913
Yeah, it's over there
in the large tureen.

1289
01:31:32,263 --> 01:31:34,197
Good work, kid.

1290
01:31:35,433 --> 01:31:37,367
We gotta go
impound the evidence.

1291
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:41,096
Job well done.
Everybody, wait here.

1292
01:31:42,707 --> 01:31:46,040
- Congratulations.
- Come on.

1293
01:31:51,716 --> 01:31:53,878
I guess we should go.

1294
01:31:53,952 --> 01:31:56,353
I'm not going anywhere.

1295
01:31:56,422 --> 01:31:58,117
- Son.
- Don't call me son.

1296
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:01,627
- I had no choice.
- You had a choice... not to turn me in.

1297
01:32:01,693 --> 01:32:04,629
- If it was your son...
- If it was my son...

1298
01:32:04,697 --> 01:32:07,131
I would have treated him
like he was my son.

1299
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:10,499
If he was my stepson,
I would treat him like my son.

1300
01:32:11,971 --> 01:32:15,338
- Clark, that animal...
- Dwight, good night.

1301
01:32:15,408 --> 01:32:17,342
Tell Mom I'll call her tomorrow.

1302
01:32:24,217 --> 01:32:25,549
Good night.

1303
01:32:29,357 --> 01:32:31,655
FBI, gentlemen.

1304
01:32:31,726 --> 01:32:34,058
Charles Greenwald,
Lloyd Simpson...

1305
01:32:34,129 --> 01:32:35,653
you're under arrest...

1306
01:32:35,729 --> 01:32:38,756
for violating your oath of office,
conspiracy to commit fraud...

1307
01:32:38,832 --> 01:32:41,199
extortion, violation of the Rico Act.

1308
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:44,137
Put the cuffs on these people.

1309
01:32:44,205 --> 01:32:46,673
The old man set us up.

1310
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:49,005
Sabatini?

1311
01:32:49,077 --> 01:32:52,240
- With the kid!
- Watch the corn, gentlemen.

1312
01:33:03,794 --> 01:33:07,251
I'm getting too old
for this nonsense.

1313
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:09,025
We done?

1314
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,133
We're done.

1315
01:33:15,105 --> 01:33:17,733
- How you doing?
- I'm a wreck.

1316
01:33:18,608 --> 01:33:21,406
Sorry to interrupt,
but they're getting restless.

1317
01:33:21,478 --> 01:33:23,208
All right.
Let's go.

1318
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,444
Hans, what are we serving
our guests for dinner?

1319
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:30,351
Hawaiian tiger fish,
mixed with...

1320
01:33:30,422 --> 01:33:32,480
smoked turkey from Virginia.

1321
01:33:32,557 --> 01:33:36,220
Smoked turkey?
This whole thing's been a scam?

1322
01:33:36,294 --> 01:33:40,129
- This gourmet thing?
- This is an ugly word, "scam."

1323
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:42,565
This is business.

1324
01:33:42,634 --> 01:33:45,159
In business, this is what you do.

1325
01:34:01,054 --> 01:34:04,182
350,000 for smoked turkey.

1326
01:34:04,258 --> 01:34:08,251
But they were having a great time
on this last night of the Gourmet Club.

1327
01:34:08,328 --> 01:34:10,091
Dwight was on a bus to Vermont.

1328
01:34:10,163 --> 01:34:12,825
Greenwald and Simpson
were on their way to jail.

1329
01:34:12,899 --> 01:34:15,334
And the animals were en route
to the Bronx Zoo...

1330
01:34:15,402 --> 01:34:19,132
to be housed in the new
Sabatini Endangered Species Wing.

1331
01:34:19,205 --> 01:34:21,367
Carmine was a philanthropist now.

1332
01:34:21,442 --> 01:34:23,705
And me?
I was just a student.

1333
01:34:28,116 --> 01:34:30,414
Mona Lisa

1334
01:34:30,485 --> 01:34:33,943
Mona Lisa
Men have named you...

1335
01:34:35,223 --> 01:34:38,421
You're so like the lady

1336
01:34:38,494 --> 01:34:40,222
With a mystic smile

1337
01:34:40,295 --> 01:34:42,628
If you'd known,
you wouldn't have done any of it.

1338
01:34:42,698 --> 01:34:47,430
- Of course not.
- That's why we never told you.

1339
01:34:47,502 --> 01:34:50,472
So he knew all along
that Dwight was my stepfather...

1340
01:34:50,539 --> 01:34:53,303
and that he'd call
those Fish and Wildlife guys?

1341
01:34:53,376 --> 01:34:55,607
Of course.

1342
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,613
He's like a genius.

1343
01:35:03,687 --> 01:35:06,054
Or is this your way

1344
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:09,820
To hide a broken heart

1345
01:35:09,894 --> 01:35:13,022
Good night, Liebschen.

1346
01:35:13,097 --> 01:35:15,360
You have always been
my great love.

1347
01:35:15,432 --> 01:35:17,594
Now I can say it
since I'm leaving.

1348
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:21,867
Fantastic job, young man!
Great!

1349
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:32,172
We're gonna go hit some clubs.
Nice working with you.

1350
01:35:32,251 --> 01:35:33,843
Take it easy.

1351
01:35:40,993 --> 01:35:42,824
The show's over.

1352
01:35:42,895 --> 01:35:45,296
So marriage is...

1353
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:47,355
Please.

1354
01:35:47,433 --> 01:35:51,336
- Good. Not that I was...
- I know.

1355
01:35:51,404 --> 01:35:53,338
I'll tell you one thing
I'd really like.

1356
01:35:53,405 --> 01:35:55,739
What's that?

1357
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:59,041
I'd like to spend the night
with you in your dorm room.

1358
01:35:59,113 --> 01:36:02,708
- Really?
- Yes, very much.

1359
01:36:02,782 --> 01:36:04,478
I would love that.

1360
01:36:04,552 --> 01:36:07,385
Get to know each other
under calmer circumstances.

1361
01:36:08,956 --> 01:36:12,824
Many dreams have been brought

1362
01:36:12,893 --> 01:36:14,827
To your doorstep

1363
01:36:15,896 --> 01:36:19,696
They just lie there

1364
01:36:19,767 --> 01:36:23,726
And they die there

1365
01:36:23,805 --> 01:36:27,674
Are you warm
Are you real

1366
01:36:27,744 --> 01:36:30,770
Mona Lisa

1367
01:36:30,847 --> 01:36:34,806
Or just a cold and lonely

1368
01:36:34,884 --> 01:36:39,184
Lovely work of art

1369
01:36:39,255 --> 01:36:41,189
I'll go help Vic.

1370
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:44,058
Well.

1371
01:36:45,595 --> 01:36:47,528
It's all over now.

1372
01:36:47,597 --> 01:36:51,089
- You can go back to Vermont.
- You remember where I'm from.

1373
01:36:51,167 --> 01:36:53,431
I always knew.

1374
01:36:54,938 --> 01:36:57,532
I'm sorry you had to
go through all this nonsense...

1375
01:36:57,608 --> 01:37:00,169
but it turned out for the good.

1376
01:37:00,244 --> 01:37:04,772
Sure. It was just...
You know... It just was.

1377
01:37:06,216 --> 01:37:08,684
I'm gonna tell you something.

1378
01:37:08,753 --> 01:37:10,243
You were brave in there.

1379
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,018
- I was proud of you.
- Thank you.

1380
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:17,388
Anyway...

1381
01:37:18,296 --> 01:37:20,230
I hope you have a good life.

1382
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:32,744
You know, l...

1383
01:37:34,046 --> 01:37:36,344
I meant everything
I told you, Clark.

1384
01:37:47,327 --> 01:37:49,261
Good night, boss.

1385
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:17,219
What's the matter with you?

1386
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,487
You're turning out to be a bum.

1387
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:22,587
Come on. Come on.

1388
01:38:22,664 --> 01:38:26,464
If it weren't for me,
you could've been a handbag.

1389
01:38:26,535 --> 01:38:28,025
Sir.

1390
01:38:28,104 --> 01:38:29,969
He don't want to walk.

1391
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:32,269
Yeah, well,
they don't really walk.

1392
01:38:32,342 --> 01:38:34,276
Yeah, he's...

1393
01:38:34,344 --> 01:38:36,676
Let me get him.
I can pick him up.

1394
01:38:36,746 --> 01:38:38,680
Let me help you.

1395
01:38:38,748 --> 01:38:40,682
I got him.

1396
01:38:43,153 --> 01:38:45,246
- You got him?
- There we go.

1397
01:38:45,321 --> 01:38:47,050
I got him.

1398
01:38:47,123 --> 01:38:49,523
I forgot to tell you something.

1399
01:38:49,592 --> 01:38:52,426
When you finish film school,
I'd like to call you.

1400
01:38:52,496 --> 01:38:54,624
Because I know a lot of people
in Hollywood.

1401
01:38:54,699 --> 01:38:58,430
- Oh, really?
- I could kick some doors open for you.

1402
01:38:58,503 --> 01:39:01,995
- Give you a couple of opportunities.
- Oh, no.

1403
01:39:02,073 --> 01:39:06,032
I- I-I don't know.
I don't think that's necessary.

1404
01:39:06,111 --> 01:39:08,773
It's easy for me.
I'll just make a phone call.

1405
01:39:08,847 --> 01:39:10,781
Make it easy for you.
