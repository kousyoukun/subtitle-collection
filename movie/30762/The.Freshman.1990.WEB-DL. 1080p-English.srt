1
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,038
Over there. Look.

2
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,875
Dwight, don't!

3
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,252
Asshole!

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,882
Are you nuts? You can't see the cap?
It's not orange enough?

5
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,426
Get out of these woods!

6
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,139
- I can hunt here. I got a permit.
- If he's got a permit...

7
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,308
Get out!

8
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,274
Let's go.

9
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,238
<i>That's Dwight Armstrong,
my stepfather.</i>

10
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,240
<i>Accent on "step."</i>

11
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,534
<i>He's a lawyer.</i>

12
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,496
<i>And he's head of
"The Friends of Fish and Wildlife"...</i>

13
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,833
<i>... an extremist pro-mammal group
in Vermont.</i>

14
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:50,838
<i>Almost all its members, male
and female, look like Dwight.</i>

15
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,633
<i>My real dad died
in a motorcycle wreck when I was 6.</i>

16
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,387
<i>Two years later,
Mom met Mr. Personality.</i>

17
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,265
<i>It has not been a barrel of laughs.</i>

18
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,872
<i>There was a certain poignancy
about today's hunting party.</i>

19
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,457
<i>It was my last evening at home.</i>

20
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:33,088
<i>Tomorrow I was beginning my first year
at New York University film school.</i>

21
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>A freshman. That was me.</i>

22
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,312
<i>My farewell dinner was
raucous and hilarious...</i>

23
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,940
<i>... full of warm, good feelings.</i>

24
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,488
That should cover it.

25
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,576
<i>Dwight gave me $600 spending
money...</i>

26
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,495
<i>... and a hearty handshake.</i>

27
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,741
- Where's the subway?
- Downstairs.

28
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,451
- That way?
- Right.

29
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,676
Sorry.

30
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,520
Forget it. He's out like a light.

31
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,772
The shame of the cities.

32
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,567
- Nothing broken?
- I'm okay.

33
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,027
That was a nasty spill.

34
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,071
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

35
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,742
- I'll give you a hand with those bags.
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

36
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,579
You're a smart kid.

37
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,038
Rule 1:

38
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:35,419
Don't let anybody touch your bags
unless you know that person is bonded.

39
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,670
Thanks.

40
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,174
I'm bonded, which is your good fortune.

41
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,511
Ignore her.

42
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,015
Who's this stranger talking to you?

43
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,852
It's Victor Ray of the
Victor Ray Car Service.

44
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,229
On your way to college, right?

45
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,648
- New York University.
- Good school.

46
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,985
Thanks. Do you know
where the subway is?

47
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,447
- You don't want the subway.
- Yes, I do.

48
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,075
- It's over there.
- Thanks.

49
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,292
In New York, we have
three distinct social classes.

50
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,922
A: People who make a billion dollars a
day and get laid in Trump Tower.

51
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,510
B: People who live in Times Square and
eat Yankee Doodles on the sidewalk.

52
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,804
C: Me.
Guys I call "the glue of society."

53
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,350
We go, "Forget about it."
All hell will break loose.

54
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,646
- Rich against poor.
- We're on the brink. It's seething.

55
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,982
Come with me.

56
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,403
For $65, you get an air-conditioned
ride and peace of mind.

57
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,155
No, I can't afford that.

58
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,492
I'll take you for the old rate, fifty.

59
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,869
No, it's out of my league.

60
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,498
- How much can you go for?
- I don't know.

61
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:59,670
- Forty, which for me is charity.
- Ten dollars I can manage.

62
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,547
Ten dollars?

63
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,259
For delivery and security in a
mint-condition Bonneville?

64
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,635
I have to eat.

65
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:11,348
I can't do better.
I'll walk or take a bus.

66
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,851
Okay, ten bucks.

67
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,980
I'll take you for ten bucks,
but on one condition.

68
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:22,317
Promise you won't tell anybody.
Word gets out, I'm finished.

69
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,113
- I won't tell a soul.
- Follow me.

70
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,657
I'm parked in a reserved spot.

71
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,325
Let's go. Come on.

72
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,119
Watch out!

73
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,581
Watch out! Suicide attempt, right?

74
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,668
It's bigger than I imagined.

75
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:44,214
That's true of many things in Manhattan.
The other boroughs too.

76
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,175
Tremendous things in Queens.

77
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,179
Go to the trunk.
It opens from the inside.

78
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,892
Take everything.
You'd be surprised how many people...

79
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,565
Stop the car!

80
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,403
Stop the car, please!

81
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:23,337
<i>I'd been in New York 19 minutes 11
seconds, and I was already ruined.</i>

82
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,558
Action.

83
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,811
The roommate enters. Come on in.

84
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,106
Don't be afraid. That's it. Come in.

85
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:47,945
I'm holding you in a medium shot.
A lovely shot. Very cinematic.

86
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,197
My name is Clark Kel...

87
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:54,076
A little confused. I like it.
It sells.

88
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,829
I like actors who think
in front of the camera.

89
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,333
- I'm moving in.
- Is this the right room?

90
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,252
Cut.

91
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,713
That's a wrap. Check it.

92
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,132
Kellogg?

93
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,551
You're?

94
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,970
- Steve Bushak.
- How do you do?

95
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,930
Really nice to meet you.

96
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,643
I should go to the police.

97
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,230
Kojak is a fictional character.

98
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,067
- Don't involve the police.
- So I'm just a victim.

99
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,821
Everybody in this city is a victim.

100
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,866
Welcome to New York.

101
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,707
I'm deeply moved.

102
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,418
I understand your position, but...

103
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:49,590
<i>For Introduction to Film you must own
Fleeber's Viewpoints in Cinema...</i>

104
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,177
<i>...and Selected Readings in Cinema,
by...</i>

105
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,469
...Fleeber.

106
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,638
I want to buy your books...

107
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,224
They aren't "my" books, Mr. Kellogg.

108
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:04,188
They are essential reading, as are
the 12 other books you must own...

109
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,732
...and which will cost over $700.

110
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,341
<i>I'm doing a paper, "And The Wheels Go
Slow: Form and Function in 42nd St."</i>

111
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,638
That would be a very interesting idea.
Take a musical...

112
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,265
Call your family for more money.

113
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,809
My stepfather won't help me out.

114
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,895
This is out of Dickens.

115
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,398
Robbed by a street urchin.
A wicked stepfather.

116
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,192
I don't know what to say.

117
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,947
I'm trying to explain that I can't
get the books now.

118
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,116
I'm a faculty advisor,
not a caseworker.

119
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,662
I'm only interested
in your academic career.

120
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,541
And you're off to an extraordinarily
unimpressive start.

121
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,712
<i>I'm sorry,
but being new to New York...</i>

122
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:25,227
Excuse me. I have to leave now.

123
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,279
Hey! Excuse me.

124
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,628
Hey, wait up!

125
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,007
Stop him! Wait!

126
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,275
Watch it!

127
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,866
I want my money and my stuff. Now!

128
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,456
My money or I call the cops!

129
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,500
No English!

130
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,503
Knock it off! I know who you are!

131
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,296
Where's my stuff?

132
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,466
Upstairs. Give me a hand with this.

133
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,676
You crazy?

134
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:44,890
I victimized you in a moment of
weakness and now justice is done.

135
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,225
Give me a hand.

136
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:52,981
My money.

137
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,192
Do you have my money?

138
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,569
Watch your step. Floors are wet.

139
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:02,741
- Give me the money immediately...
- I'd love to do just that.

140
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,743
However...

141
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,539
...here we have an awkward moment.

142
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,416
Tragically...

143
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,044
...I have a gambling problem.

144
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:18,048
I placed a wager on a horse.
Predictably.

145
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,301
You lost my money on a horse?
All of it?

146
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,096
Now, I'm not sure it was a horse.

147
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,390
Oh, God. Oh, God.

148
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,851
I swear, it was a responsible bet.

149
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:32,771
It was a 4-to-1 shot. What can I say?
Took a beating.

150
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,066
But I still got most of your clothes.

151
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,068
I'm going to the police.

152
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,490
Police? You're a college student.
I'm a working man. No police.

153
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:48,120
No? Robbery is still a crime
in New York. It's not legal.

154
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,747
It depends on the circumstances.

155
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,791
Bullshit.

156
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:57,129
I'll get you a job.
An unbelievable opportunity.

157
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,757
- You're just the guy.
- I'm serious. In fact...

158
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,010
No, forget about it.

159
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,683
- What?
- No.

160
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,520
It's irresponsible of me.
So much money.

161
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,440
What is it?

162
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,819
I shouldn't offer you this job.

163
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,113
But I'm in an awkward position...

164
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:27,993
...between my feelings of guilt towards
you and my family obligations.

165
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,828
I don't know what you mean.

166
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,916
I'm offering you a job
that I promised to my sister's kid.

167
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,836
Perfect for a college student.
Flexible hours, big money.

168
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:42,299
My sister will kill me. She'll get a
gun and blow my brains out.

169
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,428
What kind of work? Stealing cars?

170
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,266
<i>If you're going to be a cynic...</i>

171
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:55,270
You expect me to trust you
after you steal everything I own?

172
00:14:55,479 --> 00:15:00,317
Don't do anything you don't want to.
I'm giving you a choice is all.

173
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,487
If you want to make serious money...

174
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,491
...be at this address
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

175
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,247
"120 Hester Street.
Old World Social Club."

176
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:17,084
You'll work for my Uncle Carmine.
A great man.

177
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,004
He's the smart one in the family.

178
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,549
Look who's here! Don't be shy.
Come right in.

179
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,718
I wasn't sure this was it.

180
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,179
This is it.
Best neighbourhood in New York.

181
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:14,057
Uncle Carmine's waiting for you.
Here we go.

182
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,358
There at the desk. That's him.

183
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,486
- He's your uncle?
- Yeah. Do me a favour.

184
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,781
Don't say anything about my gambling.

185
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,955
I said, "How are you doing?"

186
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,416
"Very well," he says.

187
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,709
Hello.

188
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,129
This is my good friend Clark,
from Kansas.

189
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,464
Vermont.

190
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:53,138
"My heart is filled with much
happiness in meeting you," he says.

191
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,227
God Almighty.

192
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,149
You notice the resemblance, right?

193
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,818
He's the real thing. The original.

194
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,322
When they saw him,
they based the movie...

195
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,492
So is he a Mafia guy?

196
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:18,163
No, local businessman. Importer.
That's it.

197
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,166
- What a kisser.
- Unbelievable.

198
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,050
This is my uncle, Carmine Sabatini.

199
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:35,013
Uncle Carmine, this is Clark.
You never told me your last name.

200
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,683
- Kellogg.
- Just like the cereal.

201
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,186
Like the breakfast cereal.

202
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,981
Your resemblance to...

203
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,650
- Clark, have a seat.
- Pull up a chair.

204
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,245
- Would you like a nut?
- No, thank you.

205
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,582
None for me, Uncle Carmine.

206
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,212
Did you ever try Italian coffee?

207
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,630
No.

208
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,843
- Would you like to try a little taste?
- Yeah. Why not?

209
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,846
- Good.
- None for me, Uncle Carmine.

210
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,644
"Two espressos," he says.

211
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,859
That picture on the wall
wouldn't by any chance be Mussolini?

212
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,196
It ain't Tony Bennett.

213
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,242
Some older members of the club...

214
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,580
...they keep it up there for sentiment.

215
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,374
- Sentiment.
- The old days.

216
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,669
For the old days.
For good or for bad.

217
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,924
It would be like, for you,
a picture of the Beatles.

218
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,053
They're actually before my time.

219
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,931
Whatever. You understand.

220
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:03,310
You don't keep the picture up
for political reasons.

221
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,437
No. It's not political.

222
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,689
It's definitely not political.

223
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,275
My nephew says you're from Kansas.

224
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,028
Vermont.

225
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,949
Six of one, half-dozen of the other.

226
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:21,620
The most important thing
is that we're all Americans.

227
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,290
Right.

228
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,961
Good, Lorenzo. Thank you.

229
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,965
- "Thank you," he says.
- I know.

230
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,427
Now this is real Italian coffee.

231
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:41,932
It's not like regular coffee.
Know what I mean?

232
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,979
It's a little strong,
so we put a little sugar in.

233
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,320
It cuts the strength.
Maybe a little more.

234
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:00,325
All right. Drink it down. One gulp.

235
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,922
Puts hair on your chest.

236
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,218
Did my nephew explain this job to you?

237
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,345
No, not really.

238
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,600
It's best if you explain it,
Uncle Carmine.

239
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:32,149
It's not complicated work, but it
must be done right, like all things.

240
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:38,447
Tomorrow at 1 pm, outside the club,
will be parked a car.

241
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,699
What is it called?

242
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,534
Sedan De Ville.

243
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,787
- Sedan De Ville.
- That's a type of Cadillac.

244
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,122
A Cadillac.

245
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,708
Yeah, this is a type of Cadillac.

246
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:55,047
Now, I want you to drive this car
to the JFK cargo terminal.

247
00:20:55,714 --> 00:21:01,094
There you will pick up a package
addressed to Larry London.

248
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,725
Deliver this package to Cherry Hill,
New Jersey. That's it.

249
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,436
Is that far?

250
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,023
Not more than 3 hours, the whole trip.

251
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,651
Depends on traffic.

252
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,319
You never know.

253
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,738
You could get there in no time...

254
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,868
...or sit in traffic for hours
with your dick in your hand.

255
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:33,627
That's why I need someone
who can use his head...

256
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:38,298
...who won't get upset, emotional or
nervous no matter what happens.

257
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,635
Right. I understand that.

258
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:46,265
For this service,
I'm going to pay you $500.

259
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,309
$500?

260
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,604
See why my sister's so pissed?

261
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,982
I mean, angry, beside herself.

262
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,318
You'll pull in at least a grand a week.

263
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,320
A thousand dollars a week?

264
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,032
I'm going to need two trips a week,
minimum.

265
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:08,203
Of course, if things get busy,
then maybe more.

266
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,500
I hadn't thought of that much money.

267
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,755
I don't know.

268
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,552
- You don't know what?
- Wait. Hold on.

269
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:28,056
Let him think.
This is a sign of intelligence.

270
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:32,144
He's trying to understand
the nature of this job.

271
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,813
So, what are your thoughts, Kent?

272
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,815
Clark.

273
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,692
Sorry. Clark.

274
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,655
I have to ask you something.

275
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,368
Don't take it wrong.

276
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:51,413
No, anything, go ahead.

277
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,920
I smell a rat.

278
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:00,506
A rat?

279
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,009
He smells a rat.

280
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,720
That's right.

281
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,061
Know why you smell a rat?
Because God gave you a brain.

282
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:18,190
Because you're asking yourself,
"Clark, what is this?

283
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,987
A man will pay me $500 a trip
to deliver a package?"

284
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,367
- This is what you think?
- Right. That's what I'm feeling.

285
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,119
This is natural. Natural.

286
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,038
So then you understand.

287
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:36,542
Sure.
I understand a thousand percent.

288
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,757
Give me your hand.

289
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,393
You know what this is?

290
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,937
This handshake?

291
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,898
We call this the hand of friendship.

292
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,275
We?

293
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,656
You don't know what this is.
The hand of friendship from my Uncle.

294
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,367
I want you to take this opportunity.

295
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,787
Totally legitimate work
for $1000 a week.

296
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,998
I know you won't disappoint me.

297
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,251
How can I say no?

298
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,758
This is not a yes.

299
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,682
I want to hear a yes.

300
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,316
Yes.

301
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,320
Good.

302
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:50,866
Good. Now I'm happy. I'm so happy.

303
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,160
I don't know why I'm so happy.

304
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,411
That's good.

305
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,539
Everybody up.

306
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:04,630
Come to my house in Queens tonight.
He's going to...

307
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,217
You can get the keys.
I'll give you directions.

308
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,890
I have such good feelings about you.

309
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,686
I'm absolutely filled with emotion.

310
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,108
I never had a son.

311
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,289
In 15 years, I never saw him
take to anybody like that.

312
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,833
Never.

313
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,387
<i>Senator.</i>

314
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,850
<i>We're both part of the same hypocrisy.</i>

315
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:02,729
<i>Never think it applies to my family.</i>

316
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,816
<i>All right. All right.</i>

317
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,736
<i>Some people have to play little games.</i>

318
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,822
<i>You play yours.</i>

319
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:18,620
<i>Let's just say you'll pay me because
it's in your interest to pay me.</i>

320
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:21,874
<i>I want your answer and the money
by tomorrow.</i>

321
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:26,086
<i>And one more thing.
Don't you contact me again, ever.</i>

322
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:29,756
<i>From now on, you deal with Turnbull.</i>

323
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:34,845
<i>Senator, you can have my answer now.</i>

324
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:39,516
<i>My offer is this: Nothing.</i>

325
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,394
<i>Not even the fee for the gaming
license...</i>

326
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:46,231
<i>... which I would appreciate if you
would put up personally.</i>

327
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,695
"Senator, my offer is this:

328
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,989
Nothing."

329
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:58,952
In that one moment, Michael Corleone
says that all corruption is equal.

330
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:04,082
That there is no separation between
politics and gangsterism.

331
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,629
<i>As discussed in the Fleeber treatise,
Guns and Provolone...</i>

332
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:12,883
<i>...what are the similarities between
Karl Marx's Das Kapital...</i>

333
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:16,261
<i>...Immanuel Kant's
Critique of Pure Reason...</i>

334
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,932
<i>...and the Lake Tahoe scene from
Godfather II?</i>

335
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:25,771
You haven't read the Fleeber piece?

336
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,232
Well, in an evolving society...

337
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,859
You need help from Mr. Bushak?

338
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:37,199
He might enjoy helping you write
a five-page answer to my question.

339
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,952
I want it on my desk by noon tomorrow.

340
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,705
In an evolving society...

341
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:47,501
...violence and narcissism replace...
- Oh, shut up!

342
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,004
I hate this guy.

343
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:10,941
You're Clark?

344
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,693
Yes, I'm Clark.

345
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:15,946
I'm Tina, Carmine Sabatini's
only daughter.

346
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:20,659
- I didn't know he had a daughter, only.
- He does. I'm her.

347
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,369
Come in.

348
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,717
This is quite a house. Very European.

349
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,137
Can I get you a drink?
Beer? Sprite?

350
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,722
No, thanks.

351
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,893
Jesus, look at that.

352
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,064
Wow, what a job they did!

353
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:52,608
Job?

354
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:57,112
Copying job.
Down to the cracks and everything.

355
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,573
This isn't a copy. This is it.

356
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,241
Right.

357
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,910
I'm very serious.

358
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,120
This has to be a copy.

359
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:11,585
Do you remember about 10 years ago
the original toured the country?

360
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:12,961
It did?

361
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,672
They brought it over from the Louvre.

362
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:16,924
Who?

363
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,134
I don't know who. They.

364
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:22,012
It was in the United States.

365
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:23,680
And...?

366
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,476
And it stayed here.

367
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:32,189
The one they shipped back to Paris,
the one behind all the glass...

368
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:35,943
...that the tourists take pictures of
is the copy.

369
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,904
My dad thought it was just awful.

370
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:42,282
A masterpiece behind such thick glass.

371
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:47,329
He had such a special feeling for it
his whole life.

372
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,790
Sort of an obsession.

373
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,251
<i>He ripped it off? The Mona Lisa?</i>

374
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:56,296
The day it arrived here I was 9.

375
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:00,217
My dad took it out of this huge crate.

376
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,929
There was Styrofoam
and newspaper everywhere.

377
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,306
And suddenly...

378
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,559
...there it was.

379
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:11,103
And he turned to me...

380
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,814
...I'll never forget this...

381
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,400
...and he said:

382
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:19,903
"Now I'm happy.

383
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:24,324
<i>Now I got the Mona Lisa."</i>

384
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,662
It's safe here in Queens?

385
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,755
People don't steal from my father.

386
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,507
- They don't?
- No.

387
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:51,059
- You want to dance?
- Here?

388
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,360
- It's kind of hot.
- Take your sweater off.

389
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,395
My dad tells me you're from Nebraska.

390
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,022
Vermont.

391
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,733
What do you think of New York?

392
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:44,571
I stopped thinking 24 hours ago.
I'm going on pure instinct.

393
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:52,412
That's what you should do in New York.

394
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,299
Is your father here now?

395
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,971
He's in the Bronx at some meeting.

396
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:16,395
Aunt Angelina?

397
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:21,191
My head's killing me.
I'm going to bed.

398
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,653
This is Clark. Dad mentioned him.

399
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,739
Clark. The boy working for Dad.

400
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:31,910
<i>I'm going to bed.
Watch Jeopardy. You come up?</i>

401
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:34,329
After Clark leaves.

402
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:36,456
Good night, Aunt Angelina.

403
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,587
Dad's sister.

404
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:45,174
She moved in when my mother died.
I was 4.

405
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,800
I was 6.

406
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,887
- Your mom?
- No, my dad.

407
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,847
But it's never the same.

408
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,850
No, but what can you do?

409
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,310
Nothing.

410
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,936
Nothing.

411
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:03,108
I'll get you the keys to the car.

412
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:07,946
I'm a sophomore at the College of the
Sacred Virgin. Don't laugh.

413
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:11,533
- Next year I'm going to Harvard.
- Harvard?

414
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:16,747
That's something. I didn't apply there,
with my high school grades.

415
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,957
Not that they were terrible.

416
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,294
My grades are nothing special.
About a B-.

417
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:26,798
How did you get in?
Your Boards must have been monsters.

418
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,175
It's Dad.

419
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:32,513
He told Harvard I wanted to go,
and they said, "Sure."

420
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:38,602
Are we talking about the same Harvard?
In Cambridge, Massachusetts?

421
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,730
Of course. Harvard needs my dad.

422
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:46,777
They don't want strikes
by the janitors or gardeners.

423
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,404
All those old trees and lawns.

424
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,156
But he's an importer.

425
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:52,866
Right?

426
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,537
It's great meeting you, Clark.

427
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,541
A guy from Vermont.
Real American New England-y.

428
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:01,834
Hold on.

429
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:06,129
- He's an importer. Just tell me.
- He's an importer. Yes.

430
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,092
An extremely powerful importer.
There are such people.

431
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,261
So what is it?

432
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:16,014
- What is what?
- The package at the airport.

433
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:20,519
Hint. It's big.
Bring someone to help you out.

434
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,020
What is it?

435
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,523
If Dad didn't tell you, I can't.

436
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:30,487
It's not going to be a dead guy
in a box or something, is it?

437
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,033
What an imagination.

438
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,665
You're so unbelievably cute.

439
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:45,294
I'll see you again.
I could just eat you up.

440
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,757
Good luck tomorrow.

441
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,234
You boys need me?

442
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:15,491
- You Leo?
- I am Big Leo.

443
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:19,703
- It just says Leo.
- We are the same. Leo and Big Leo.

444
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:23,665
- You're synonymous.
- That's right.

445
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,340
Okay, come with me.

446
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:34,092
You don't bring it out?

447
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:36,345
No. Not this I don't.

448
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:54,696
"Not this I don't."
Remember those words.

449
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,365
Not very encouraging.

450
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,246
Here it is. All yours.

451
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:06,458
It arrived this morning
on the redeye from Borneo.

452
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,796
I'm going to puke my guts out.

453
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,842
- What is it?
- A lizard.

454
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:19,763
- That thing is a lizard?
- They call it the Komodo dragon.

455
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:24,560
Lives in Indonesia, Sumatra,
Komodo Island, in point of fact.

456
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,188
And tell Mr. Sabatini that this one...

457
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:32,150
...was eight bills extra.
- Excuse me?

458
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:36,071
Just tell him. He'll understand.
Sign here by the X.

459
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:37,656
Recipient.

460
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:41,743
- That's me.
- You're the recipient.

461
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:46,415
Put him in the back seat
with the windows open.

462
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,500
The gills need fresh air.

463
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:51,378
He doesn't have any gills.

464
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:55,007
Whatever. That's what I was told.
Fresh air.

465
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,677
And make sure you get
a seat belt on him, because...

466
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,929
...if he jumps on you...

467
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,932
...you got major troubles.

468
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:06,476
Major troubles.

469
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,105
Down, boy.

470
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:11,607
It's not a dog.

471
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:16,445
You know what?
We got to pick him up.

472
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,573
Pick him up.

473
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,451
- With what?
- With our hands.

474
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:25,037
It's not that bad.

475
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:28,207
I'll help you,
but I won't risk my life.

476
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:30,501
- Help. For God's sake.
- Sorry.

477
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:35,130
- I refuse to handle this animal.
- He's going under the truck.

478
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:42,179
- Get the door.
- You locked it, remember?

479
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,059
Take him.

480
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:48,560
Just for a second.

481
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,104
You're the recipient.

482
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:56,693
If he stains my suit, I'll be pissed.

483
00:37:57,903 --> 00:38:00,697
Could you take any longer?

484
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:10,666
Okay, you go around
and get the other side.

485
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,001
Major trouble.

486
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,717
Put the seat belt on him.

487
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,804
- You're joking.
- I'm not joking.

488
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:28,016
This is precious cargo,
this freaking thing.

489
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:32,187
- What seat belt?
- Put him in this one.

490
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,398
Seat belts.

491
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:37,401
- Under his armpit.
- What armpit?

492
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,320
This lizard armpit.

493
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,240
Oh, that lizard armpit. I see.

494
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:45,951
<i>You know...</i>

495
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,961
- I think he's okay.
- Let's go.

496
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,137
Happy as a clam.

497
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:11,185
- Use the air conditioner.
- He said to leave them open.

498
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:16,607
Who? Haystack Calhoun? What is he?
A zoologist? I'll take responsibility.

499
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,275
All right.

500
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,745
<i>I told you he'd throw up.</i>

501
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,166
I have to open the windows.

502
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,210
It's murder.

503
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:42,257
Feeling better? Tummy ache all gone?

504
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:47,471
- It stinks in here.
- I can't take it.

505
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:51,225
We have to wash it off.
Pull into that gas station.

506
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:01,860
Excuse me. Hello.

507
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:07,950
- I need some water. A hose.
- Around the corner. Help yourself.

508
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,828
This way. It's around the back.

509
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,940
He went under a car.

510
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:25,736
You go that way.

511
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,272
<i>Owner of the reptile,
report to the information booth.</i>

512
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:12,825
- Don't panic.
- What if I can't find him?

513
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,452
Leave the country for 10 years.

514
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,121
You're kidding? I'm serious!

515
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,143
<i>Security to Concourse B.</i>

516
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,221
Okay, go.

517
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,899
Slowly.

518
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,194
I'm losing him.

519
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,286
I'm afraid now.

520
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,941
Mr. London?

521
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,568
Edward?

522
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:14,530
Look!

523
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,074
It's here!

524
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,492
Finally.

525
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:22,246
- Are you Edward?
- I am.

526
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:25,791
Oh, what a beautiful specimen.

527
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,589
Has this bad boy been swimming?

528
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,968
We took him right here
from the airport.

529
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:39,012
They just love swimming pools.
But...

530
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:41,431
...chlorine.

531
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:50,482
I told him he is
very disobedient dragon.

532
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:53,944
For joke.

533
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:57,781
It's a good joke. Very unusual.

534
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:00,701
Without humour, what do we have?

535
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,299
Beautiful, yes?

536
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,887
- This is like a zoo?
- This is like a zoo.

537
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,892
Can you believe this?

538
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:31,398
- So, do you exhibit rare animals?
- On occasion.

539
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,403
Who are these boys?

540
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:42,659
Carmine said one boy...

541
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:44,745
...here are two.

542
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:50,209
This is Mr. Larry London.

543
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:57,716
- Mr. London, I'm Clark Kellogg.
- Carmine said one boy...

544
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,885
...here are two.

545
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:06,934
I realize that, sir. We are two boys,
as you quite rightly point out.

546
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:12,523
However, I'm somewhat
new to the area...

547
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:16,735
...and this particular parcel
was quite bulky...

548
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:22,366
<i>...so at the suggestion of Tina...
- Ah, die schöne Tina.</i>

549
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,828
The beautiful Tina.

550
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,290
Yes, the beautiful Tina.

551
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,545
If there was a misunderstanding...

552
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,464
Carmine said one boy...

553
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,509
...and here are two.

554
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,513
You gotta like this guy.

555
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,309
Smells like basil.

556
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:50,811
Very good.

557
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,022
A cream basil sauce.

558
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:55,941
You're a chef?

559
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,194
I wasn't clear what you did.

560
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:02,823
Now you'll get your money.

561
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,076
<i>The money...</i>

562
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:12,124
The money is conveyed
in a brown paper bag.

563
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:22,593
- Not very attractive, I know.
- No problem, sir.

564
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:25,846
If you count it, I won't mind.

565
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:31,685
That won't be necessary.
I trust you and Mr. Sabatini.

566
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:42,029
That means,
"My heart swims in blood."

567
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,624
That's a Bengal tiger,
ladies and gentleman.

568
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:56,752
Something is way off.
Way off.

569
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:05,928
<i>How are you, darling?
How's New York?</i>

570
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:10,474
I miss you too. Like crazy...

571
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:14,436
...at the risk of sounding like a mother.

572
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,981
No, he's asleep, thank God. Why?

573
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,735
Well, the thing is I got this job.

574
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:26,114
New York is unbelievably expensive.
I had to.

575
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:31,328
It involved driving...

576
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,123
...and picking up a reptile.

577
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,043
What kind of a reptile?
I don't...

578
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:42,256
<i>- It's a Komodo dragon.
- Who? Komodo dragon?</i>

579
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:46,176
<i>- I never heard of it.
- Then could you look it up?</i>

580
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,604
<i>- Komodo? Is that with a K?
- Right.</i>

581
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,191
Koala.

582
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,193
Kodiak.

583
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:05,154
Komodo dragon. Here.

584
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:08,949
<i>"Latin name is Varanus komodoensis.</i>

585
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:12,035
Main prey are deer and wild pig.

586
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:16,665
<i>There are seven dragons
in zoos outside Indonesia."/i></i>

587
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:20,586
<i>- Oh, my God! Oh, Clark.
- What?</i>

588
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:23,922
"Chances for survival
are considered hopeless."

589
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:26,300
It's an endangered species.

590
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,553
<i>My God.</i>

591
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:33,348
<i>- Are you sure?
- There's a red asterisk next to it.</i>

592
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,310
<i>That means virtually extinct.</i>

593
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:40,063
<i>- What's this job?
- Never mind, I'll quit.</i>

594
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:41,982
A Komodo dragon.

595
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,486
<i>Don't worry. I didn't know.</i>

596
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:56,747
That's him.

597
00:49:58,123 --> 00:49:59,374
You sure?

598
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:04,588
Absolutely. That's Dwight Armstrong's
stepson. Unbelievable.

599
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,933
Is Mr. Sabatini here?

600
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:18,310
Yes. Come in.

601
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,773
Charlie, wait a minute.

602
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:27,528
General Motors went down 10 points,
and you didn't call?

603
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,740
What about Polaroid?

604
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,160
It went down?

605
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,788
Down what?

606
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:48,257
I told you before,
I don't like it when they go down.

607
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:54,012
I used to have another broker.

608
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:57,140
He bought stocks for me
that went down.

609
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:59,810
And it got very unpleasant.

610
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:02,980
Very unpleasant.

611
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:07,359
Wait a minute. That's right.

612
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:14,324
Next time you call me,
I want to hear good news.

613
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,870
Right? That's only good news.

614
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:23,208
I must be getting soft.

615
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,043
Business.

616
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:29,506
Business in this country
is run by children, not men.

617
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,635
Anyway. Forget it.

618
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:36,930
- A nice espresso?
- No, thank you.

619
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,269
Sir, I have to talk to you.

620
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:45,230
I want to tell you something.

621
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:50,861
Larry London called me.
He couldn't stop talking.

622
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:54,031
He went on and on.

623
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,785
He's a very interesting man.

624
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,749
- I heard of the adventure at the mall.
- You did?

625
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:05,542
Of course.

626
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,216
Clark, what's on your mind?

627
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:16,637
I have to talk to you.
It's about these...

628
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:24,269
- It's about these reptiles.
- What about them?

629
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:26,647
They're endangered.

630
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:30,651
Not anymore. They're fine in Jersey.

631
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:34,947
It's against the law
to bring them here.

632
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:36,782
It's a crime.

633
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:40,786
You're speaking in generalities.

634
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:43,956
You said my work here was legitimate.

635
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,917
It's perfectly legitimate.

636
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,502
No, it's not.

637
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:52,506
I'm illegally transporting
endangered species.

638
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:56,051
Please, sir,
I'd like to be let out.

639
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,350
This is an impossibility.

640
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:06,019
What do you mean?

641
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:10,149
I have a certain standing in business.

642
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:15,904
How would it look, some college kid
making me look like a fool?

643
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,325
<i>This is humiliation.
It's infamia.</i>

644
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:23,245
Know what people will say?

645
00:53:24,663 --> 00:53:29,376
"What's wrong with him?"
You understand what I'm saying?

646
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:36,633
I'd never tell a soul.
It wouldn't leave this club.

647
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:39,511
I only meant that...

648
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:44,057
- Are you trying to hurt my feelings?
- No.

649
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:46,727
That's not the issue at all.

650
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,522
I'm going to tell you something
from my heart.

651
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:54,860
You're a great boy.
You are one of a kind.

652
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:58,197
Thank you.

653
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:03,410
The kind of kids I used to have
working for me, the mooks...

654
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,120
...the muscleheads.

655
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:08,874
But you, you're from Connecticut.

656
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:14,087
It's nothing personal.
It's not you.

657
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,884
In any discussion
about our relationship...

658
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,638
...we won't forget
the most important thing.

659
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,431
Which is?

660
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,934
You marrying my daughter.

661
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:31,104
You should have heard Tina.

662
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:37,027
Clark this, Clark that.
She wants to get married yesterday.

663
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:41,156
I said, "Wait for spring.
Planning takes time."

664
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:43,742
The food, place, time of year.

665
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:47,496
Who to invite, who not to invite.
That's important.

666
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:51,750
You got to figure that my
business associates alone...

667
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:53,919
...must be 2000 people.

668
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:58,924
Not including the senators,
congressmen, judges.

669
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,760
And don't forget the police.

670
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:04,263
But you know, love.

671
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:08,267
Love doesn't ask
these questions, right?

672
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:12,271
Yeah, I guess.

673
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:19,611
Come outside.
I got a little surprise for you.

674
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:22,614
Come on.

675
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:29,621
I don't know where this talk
of marriage began, but I'm not ready.

676
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,333
I'd like to sample life a little bit first.

677
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:37,504
Wait. After you get married,
you sample life.

678
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:41,967
This is what men do.
Marriage is an institution.

679
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:44,845
It's the bedrock of society.

680
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,974
What you're talking about
is a little va-voom.

681
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,643
This is self-understood.

682
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,814
I'm talking about social order.

683
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,817
Try to put yourself in my position.

684
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:03,155
I wish I could, Clarkie.
You're such a beautiful boy.

685
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:08,744
- Know why I'm so nuts about you?
- I don't, no.

686
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:11,622
Because you're not a sneak.

687
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,502
You come down to my club.
You open your heart to me.

688
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:19,004
You say what's on your mind.

689
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:22,674
That's how I know
you won't be a snake.

690
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,594
A snake in the grass.

691
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:29,556
That's how I know
you'll be loyal to me...

692
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:31,350
...until death.

693
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,019
Until death.

694
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:36,688
Like a real son.

695
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:39,066
Oh, I don't know.

696
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,486
The son I never had.

697
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:07,386
I got an engagement present for you.

698
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:10,472
It's not much, but it's from my heart.

699
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:11,932
For me?

700
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:13,475
You're a lucky guy.

701
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:21,900
Take it for a little spin.

702
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:25,237
Go pick up Tina.
She's waiting at school.

703
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:29,575
I understand.

704
00:57:31,243 --> 00:57:33,245
Sometimes in life...

705
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:37,416
...these emotions are beyond words.

706
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:38,834
Go ahead.

707
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:50,470
College of the Sacred Virgin in Queens.

708
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:52,973
Let's move it.

709
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:58,645
He kissed me on the mouth.

710
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:02,483
You know how big this is?

711
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:08,322
The kiss of all kisses.
The highest! You're in for life!

712
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,449
It's like we're brothers.

713
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,159
God bless you.

714
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:18,123
Anything wrong with it,
we'll get you another.

715
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:22,169
You have fun.

716
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:03,794
Say when.

717
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:07,464
When.

718
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,659
Screw this.

719
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:43,500
Turn right. Right!

720
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:54,511
He's parking?

721
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:55,929
Hello?

722
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,261
I want it to be very conventional,
old-fashioned...

723
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,971
Oh, hi, Clark!

724
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:39,473
We have to talk.

725
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,893
This is Father Frank
of the music department.

726
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:47,606
We're discussing wedding music.
"Ave Maria" for the recessional...

727
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:49,358
Excuse us.

728
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:52,236
Of course. Congratulations, my son.

729
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:54,071
Thank you, Father.

730
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:57,366
- You're hurting me.
- I'm tense.

731
01:00:57,574 --> 01:01:00,244
- I was involved in a car chase.
- And?

732
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,246
And? No "and."

733
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:05,833
This is part of your life,
but not mine.

734
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:10,462
People are flashing their lights at me.
I have to get away.

735
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:14,341
- It's just part of a working day.
- It is not!

736
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:17,970
You weren't forced
to commit to my father.

737
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:21,098
It's beyond commitment.
It's like slavery.

738
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,600
People telling me who to marry!

739
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,148
- You don't want to marry me?
- I don't want to marry anybody yet.

740
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:31,775
So we'll wait.

741
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:35,404
We don't have to rush into anything.

742
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:37,948
I know that you'll wait for me.

743
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:41,285
You're part of the family permanently.

744
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:42,786
"Permanently"?

745
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:46,790
Your father kissed me.
Vic says I'm in for life.

746
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,293
- You are.
- I'm not!

747
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:55,090
It's a fluke.
I got ripped off by this Vic.

748
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,426
And I caught up to him. What?

749
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:02,681
You think it was an accident
that you "caught up" to him?

750
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,809
You were chosen, Clark.

751
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,896
You were hand-picked.

752
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:13,942
- And it is the greatest honour.
- What are you saying?

753
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:17,488
Vic has great instincts about people.

754
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:23,035
He saw you where? Grand Central?

755
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:28,373
- It was a setup?
- "Setup" is so negative.

756
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:31,460
There are so many levels to this.

757
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,837
I just want my life back.

758
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:37,633
I can't talk to you
when you're so hysterical.

759
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:42,846
What is the deal? What is it?
Am I some kind of dupe?

760
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:46,391
They looked in my yearbook
and found a chump?

761
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,686
Are you serious? A dupe?

762
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:53,065
You think I'd marry a dupe?

763
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:58,946
Everybody's talking about the job
you're doing. It's all over town.

764
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:04,618
Larry London called my father.
He said how bright you were.

765
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:10,958
How gentle. How perceptive.
If you weren't all those things...

766
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:16,046
...would Vic be out now
getting you a gun permit?

767
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,882
I don't need a gun permit!

768
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:22,761
You will if you'll be carrying a gun.

769
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,138
People are chasing you.

770
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:29,434
That's quite a story. Charming.

771
01:03:30,644 --> 01:03:33,105
I can't take it so lightly, sir.

772
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:38,277
It has a real film-noir quality.
Smuggling lizards into New Jersey.

773
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:42,531
If it was done right,
black and white, grainy...

774
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:44,867
<i>...sort of Kiss Me Deadly.</i>

775
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:47,411
It's my life, not a film idea.

776
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:52,499
They are the same when perceived
through the twin lenses...

777
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,377
Clark Kellogg.

778
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:59,840
I'm Chuck Greenwald.
This is Lloyd Simpson.

779
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,676
We're from
the Department of Justice...

780
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:06,889
...Fish and Wildlife Division.
We've been looking for you.

781
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:12,311
- This is what I'm talking about.
- I know nothing about it.

782
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:16,440
We were discussing a film project.
Oh, God, I'm late.

783
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:18,775
Excuse me, please.

784
01:04:19,985 --> 01:04:21,028
Mr. Kellogg.

785
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,538
This is actually a federal office?

786
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,374
We're undercover, Mr. Kellogg.

787
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:36,543
Special agents.

788
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:41,131
- I think I better contact a lawyer.
- You may.

789
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:43,592
You have a lawyer?

790
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:45,636
My stepfather.

791
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:52,226
- What?
- Your stepfather turned you in.

792
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:57,314
My stepfather?
How did he know anything about this?

793
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:04,488
You know a Carmine Sabatini,
also known as Jimmy the Toucan.

794
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:09,368
"Toucan" I never heard.
My stepfather?

795
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:13,914
Do you know Hans Kurt Schlegel,
alias Larry London?

796
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:21,547
- We've met. I don't know him...
- These men are fiends, Mr. Kellogg.

797
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:25,884
It's up to you to stop
their unspeakable activities.

798
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,011
What are you talking about?

799
01:05:28,804 --> 01:05:31,807
You ever heard mention
of the Gourmet Club?

800
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,058
No.

801
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:38,939
Sabatini and Schlegel established
the Gourmet Club operation in 1985.

802
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:43,193
It's a moveable feast.
Never the same location.

803
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:48,031
Dinner's every three to six months,
depending on the catch.

804
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:49,533
No prices.

805
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:54,371
The minimum price for eating
at this club is $200,000 per plate.

806
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:58,709
- For dinner?
- Not just dinner, Mr. Kellogg.

807
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:03,630
The entire menu consists
of endangered species.

808
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:07,551
- They cook these animals?
- They do, yes, sir.

809
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:12,347
For an international clientele
of degenerates, scum, Euro-trash.

810
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:16,727
People pay $200,000
to eat these animals?

811
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:18,061
Minimum.

812
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:21,648
The more endangered,
the higher the price.

813
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:27,070
If there are 5 or less in the world,
it goes up to half a million.

814
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:32,326
<i>- To eat the very last of a species...
- A cool million.</i>

815
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:35,704
The dragon will be about
$350,000 a plate.

816
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:39,500
Served off the bone,
with a cream basil sauce.

817
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,793
That's Schlegel's trademark.

818
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:45,589
If they fillet it...
Schlegel likes to fillet...

819
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:49,092
...they can get 60 servings
out of one dragon.

820
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:51,845
That's a $20 million haul.

821
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:56,850
Mr. Sabatini wouldn't do that.

822
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,937
Who do you think he is, Bishop Tutu?

823
01:07:00,187 --> 01:07:03,941
- I don't believe he'd do that.
- I want Sabatini!

824
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:09,571
- Before they serve that poor animal.
- Tell us where and when.

825
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:13,450
You want me to be an informer.

826
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:16,703
Or spend two years in Leavenworth.

827
01:07:16,954 --> 01:07:21,208
- You'd lock me up for two years?
- I sure would.

828
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,794
Unless you give us the old man.

829
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:32,094
I'll think about it.

830
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:47,002
<i>There's freedom in being screwed.</i>

831
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:50,297
<i>You know things can't get any worse.</i>

832
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:59,473
Clark, you can't just split.

833
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:01,558
What would you do?

834
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,478
I'd turn him in and hate myself.

835
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:06,355
You'd do that?

836
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:08,857
I don't know.

837
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:23,914
Is Clark Kellogg
in one of these rooms?

838
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:28,293
He's here. Come right in.
He's here.

839
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:38,053
Clark mentioned something,
but I had no idea the resemblance...

840
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:43,392
- This is Steve Bushak, my roommate.
- My pleasure.

841
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:49,565
Could you leave us alone for a moment?
I want to talk to my son-in-law.

842
01:09:50,816 --> 01:09:52,818
I'd really like to stay.

843
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:55,529
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

844
01:09:55,737 --> 01:09:59,324
If you'd just leave us alone,
I'd appreciate it.

845
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:02,161
I'll get shoes and be on my way.

846
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,998
<i>Could you put those on outside?
I have some...</i>

847
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:08,959
Outside? I always do that.

848
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:16,216
Sit down.
I want to ask you something.

849
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:23,557
- You followed me.
- Followed you?

850
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:27,311
Yeah. A little bit, this evening.

851
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:34,776
Clark, I know when somebody's
following me.

852
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:40,240
I left the club and you were around
on the street, in a doorway.

853
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:42,701
Someplace.

854
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:46,205
Because I feel these things, you know?

855
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:49,041
Is this true?

856
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:52,461
Yes.

857
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:59,051
- I had a lot on my mind.
- You don't have to explain.

858
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:06,558
Looks like you're ready for bed.

859
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:11,438
- Soon.
- Want me to read you a bedtime story?

860
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:17,402
Tina used to love
Curious George, the monkey.

861
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:21,573
Every night I told her
a different story.

862
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:26,495
Curious George goes here,
Curious George goes there.

863
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,665
She knew them all by heart.

864
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:33,752
My real father used to read me those.

865
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:39,842
Who was the guy who used to take care
of Curious George, his keeper?

866
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:44,596
You mean the man in the yellow hat?

867
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:48,016
The man with the yellow hat.

868
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:52,312
Is this your real dad?

869
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,234
That's me when I was 3.

870
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:03,782
I was 6 when he died.
Motorcycle accident.

871
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:07,578
What business was he in?

872
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:12,374
He was a poet. He taught English
at the Putney School.

873
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:15,002
You know any of his poems?

874
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:17,296
A few of them.

875
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:20,716
- Tell me one.
- One of his poems?

876
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:25,304
Just tell me a short one.

877
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:30,851
One I like is called
"A Doorway on Boylston Street."

878
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:33,020
In Boston.

879
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:39,693
It's been a while since I did it.

880
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:46,658
<i>There's a certain doorway
On Boylston Street</i>

881
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:49,703
<i>That I passed by on foot</i>

882
01:12:50,496 --> 01:12:54,791
<i>Suited and shod
One of many each Tuesday</i>

883
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:58,253
<i>Toward lunch with a certain woman</i>

884
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:00,672
<i>Regarded each Tuesday</i>

885
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,842
<i>By the perfect turning gaze</i>

886
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:06,512
<i>Of a white Persian</i>

887
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:10,474
<i>Regarding me, lovebound</i>

888
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:12,768
<i>Sped by desire</i>

889
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:16,814
<i>And returning
To the certainty of his fur</i>

890
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:22,194
This was a cat on the doorway?

891
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:30,327
"The certainty of his fur."

892
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:34,331
- You liked it?
- I like it very much.

893
01:13:35,332 --> 01:13:37,292
Very much.

894
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:41,880
I like especially the fact
that you remember his poems.

895
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:47,678
<i>Well, that's ...</i>

896
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:51,223
That's all I wanted to say.

897
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:57,312
And if there's anything
you have to tell me...

898
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:01,441
...I know that you will.

899
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:04,319
Yes.

900
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:10,659
You told me before that you
wanted to quit your job.

901
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:13,954
If you want to, it's all right.

902
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,832
I'll miss you.

903
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:23,672
It's all right. Get a good sleep.

904
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:26,383
Good night.

905
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:33,098
So this is college?

906
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:36,894
I didn't miss nothing.

907
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:08,342
<i>A plane is waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.</i>

908
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,136
<i>Don't make a big thing about it.</i>

909
01:15:14,807 --> 01:15:16,975
<i>I know it was you, Fredo.</i>

910
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:19,436
<i>You broke my heart.</i>

911
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:22,147
"You broke my heart."

912
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:37,830
"It was you, Fredo."

913
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:40,207
A moment of epiphany.

914
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:45,254
Michael Corleone kisses his brother.
An astonishing image...

915
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:49,508
...at once suggestive of love,
inversion, power...

916
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:53,220
...and in this world of duplicity
and corruption...

917
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:56,807
...is there anything more important
than loyalty...

918
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:59,226
- No.
...to friends...

919
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:00,936
...to family?

920
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,690
And who deserves our loyalty?

921
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:06,358
Yeah?

922
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:09,736
I need Clark Kellogg for a second.

923
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:13,282
You need Clark Kellogg for a second?

924
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:16,535
Why, may I ask, is it so urgent?

925
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,913
I'm Carmine Sabatini's daughter, Tina.

926
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:24,793
- Jimmy the Toucan?
- Nobody calls him that.

927
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:27,296
Just one second.

928
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:31,008
Up, Mr. Kellogg!

929
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:36,180
- I'll be right back.
- No hurry. I'm quite impressed.

930
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:37,973
Jimmy the Toucan?

931
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:41,894
He's quite a remarkable person.

932
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:45,355
I'm sure he is. Can I meet him?

933
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:48,066
That's a long shot.

934
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:49,735
Fine.

935
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:53,655
My father thinks Clark
is an A student.

936
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:58,285
- He's a fine young man.
- My father said an A student.

937
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:00,829
- Absolutely! A, A+!
- Okay.

938
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:04,750
Have a wonderful time.
Give my best to your dad.

939
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:07,419
Jimmy the Toucan!

940
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:09,755
Are you out of your skull?

941
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:12,758
- I was helping!
- I don't need help.

942
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:14,760
Fine. So I won't.

943
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,639
Where are we going?

944
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,097
Vic waved.

945
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:02,558
That's nice.

946
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,611
Everybody skate, come on.

947
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:23,912
Sir, we have to talk.

948
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:26,999
Pull them off. We gotta talk?

949
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:30,752
I have important things
to bring up with you.

950
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:34,590
- Do you have the clothes?
- In the locker room.

951
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,426
Get the clothes and change.

952
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:40,596
And then you'll drive us out.

953
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,598
Drive where?

954
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:47,978
We're going to go to the Gourmet Club.
This is Friday.

955
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:50,397
I have to talk to you first.

956
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:54,234
- We'll talk in the car.
- You promise?

957
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:58,739
Every word I say, by definition,
is a promise.

958
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:00,657
Come on.

959
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:08,832
<i>Driving a Porsche
had always been appealing...</i>

960
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:10,918
<i>... until now.</i>

961
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:19,927
<i>- Do you read Newsweek?
- Sometimes.</i>

962
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:23,680
I'm very worried
about this ozone business.

963
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:27,142
I'm really very concerned.

964
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,311
I have to talk to you.

965
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:33,982
You wanted to talk to me last night,
but couldn't do it.

966
01:19:34,316 --> 01:19:36,819
I knew it would take you a day.

967
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,198
<i>The feds are after me.</i>

968
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:45,160
- You get their names?
- Greenwald and Simpson.

969
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:50,833
They said they'd put me in jail unless
I led them to the Gourmet Club.

970
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:54,503
- They won't send you to jail.
- They won't?

971
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:58,006
They're gonna blow your brains out.

972
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:03,345
I want to say you have done
an outstanding job.

973
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:07,015
Thank you. We appreciate it.

974
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:10,185
They work for the Bonelli family...

975
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:13,897
...out of South Amboy.
- Not for the government?

976
01:20:14,106 --> 01:20:19,027
They do, but they're on the take
for the Bonellis.

977
01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:23,907
<i>- Staggering, isn't it? The corruption.
- Yeah, the corruption is...</i>

978
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,704
- He's driving around with mobsters.
- College kid. It's upsetting.

979
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:33,542
These guys are after you
for the Bonellis...

980
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:36,211
...and they just used me.

981
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:40,215
- And once they get you...
- Then they hit you.

982
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:42,718
My God! This is terrible.

983
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:47,723
That's the way it's done.
I'm sorry I got you into this...

984
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:51,852
...but you're in it and we'll
get you out of it.

985
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,228
My God!

986
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:55,272
<i>He had a way out.</i>

987
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:58,525
<i>A plan to entrap Greenwald
and Simpson...</i>

988
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:02,529
<i>... and get him out
of the endangered-species racket.</i>

989
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:07,242
<i>Hint: It involved using me
and the lizard as bait.</i>

990
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:11,955
<i>This would be the final dinner
of the fabulous Gourmet Club.</i>

991
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:29,973
<i>Tequila!</i>

992
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,590
Ladies and gentlemen...

993
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:08,595
...your cohost for this evening,
Mr. Carmine Sabatini.

994
01:22:10,597 --> 01:22:15,394
With him are his daughter,
Tina, and her fiancé Clark Kellogg...

995
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,188
...from the great state of Montana.

996
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:23,235
Let's have a Gourmet Club welcome
for Carmine and the happy couple.

997
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:40,711
<i>Tequila!</i>

998
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:58,479
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all waited for.

999
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:03,692
The moment that makes the Gourmet
Club the special place it is.

1000
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:07,738
Our main course,
served for the very last time...

1001
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:10,449
...on this, our planet Earth...

1002
01:23:10,908 --> 01:23:13,368
...your Komodo dragon.

1003
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,709
<i>There he is</i>

1004
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:24,129
<i>Your Komodo dragon</i>

1005
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,258
<i>Yes, there he is</i>

1006
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:31,470
<i>One of eight</i>

1007
01:23:32,596 --> 01:23:35,265
<i>With so many species</i>

1008
01:23:35,474 --> 01:23:37,726
<i>He took the town by storm with his</i>

1009
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:41,480
<i>Continental taste and charm</i>

1010
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:44,983
Go into this cornfield. It's deserted.

1011
01:23:59,581 --> 01:24:00,624
Good.

1012
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:03,168
A Rob Roy with a twist.
You?

1013
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:04,753
Diet Coke.

1014
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:09,633
- Did my uncle bring you up-to-date?
- Yeah.

1015
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:12,845
We'll be killed
by Greenwald and Simpson.

1016
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:16,348
They're with the Bonellis
out of South Amboy.

1017
01:24:16,557 --> 01:24:20,185
That's stretching.
There's a chance we'll be killed.

1018
01:24:20,519 --> 01:24:22,062
It's not a lot.

1019
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:25,691
We need to get you
adequately prepared.

1020
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:34,241
- An Italian passport.
- Open it.

1021
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:42,583
Is that a piece of work?

1022
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,210
What is this?

1023
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,837
"Rodolfo Lasparri?"

1024
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:49,298
I got to tell you.

1025
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:53,218
We may be on a plane to
Palermo, Sicily tonight...

1026
01:24:53,469 --> 01:24:55,179
...if we're still walking.

1027
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:58,599
- I don't want to go to Palermo.
- Ever been?

1028
01:24:58,849 --> 01:25:03,145
- No.
- Then you can't judge, Rodolfo.

1029
01:25:03,353 --> 01:25:04,855
I'm not going!

1030
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:09,818
I can't take it! I don't want to
spend the rest of my life hiding.

1031
01:25:10,068 --> 01:25:13,447
- I want this resolved!
- You do?

1032
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:14,698
Yes!

1033
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:21,121
- Why are you smiling?
- As usual, Uncle Carmine was right.

1034
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:25,542
You're ready. Ready for Freddy.

1035
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:28,879
"Ready for Freddy"?

1036
01:25:31,256 --> 01:25:36,011
It's showtime. In two minutes,
you go outside and signal the feds.

1037
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:40,891
What the hell is that?

1038
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:45,395
Fish and Wildlife doesn't mean
we're social workers.

1039
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:52,945
Ladies and gentlemen, your cohost
for this evening, Mr. Larry London!

1040
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:59,117
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1041
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:09,002
This is a very special evening
for all of us.

1042
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:14,591
For tonight you will eat one
of only eight Komodo dragons...

1043
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:17,678
...left in the entire world.

1044
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:25,602
Which is why it has been priced at...

1045
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:29,314
...$350,000 a plate.
Service included!

1046
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:34,486
Thank you for paying in advance.

1047
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:36,780
<i>Without these monies...</i>

1048
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:44,121
Smells good.
I want you to take half of it...

1049
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:47,457
...and put the rest in the steamer.

1050
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:50,294
Go ahead.

1051
01:27:01,138 --> 01:27:04,475
He wants you to help him
with the dragon.

1052
01:27:07,478 --> 01:27:11,482
Good luck, not that you need it.
Everybody's confident.

1053
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:01,198
The kid is signalling us.

1054
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:03,033
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

1055
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:09,248
<i>I crossed the dance floor,
heart pounding.</i>

1056
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:12,584
<i>In a few minutes
I would be free, dead...</i>

1057
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:16,421
<i>... or Rodolfo Lasparri
of Palermo, Sicily.</i>

1058
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:21,802
<i>It was all up to me.
The show was about to begin.</i>

1059
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:56,170
<i>The lizard was more nervous than me.
We were in the same boat.</i>

1060
01:29:08,807 --> 01:29:11,560
Everybody out. Get out.

1061
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:46,595
- Give me that dragon!
- Freeze! Department of Justice!

1062
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:48,972
Sabatini, Schlegel...

1063
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:50,766
...you're under arrest.

1064
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:55,896
- What's the charge?
- Import and attempted slaughter...

1065
01:29:56,146 --> 01:30:00,651
<i>...of Varanus komodoensis,
also known as the Komodo dragon.</i>

1066
01:30:00,943 --> 01:30:04,112
- It's over, old man.
- You betrayed me.

1067
01:30:04,363 --> 01:30:05,697
You betrayed me.

1068
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:07,908
Stand back!

1069
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,868
Drop it or I'll shoot.

1070
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:15,165
<i>- How could you do this?
- Sir...</i>

1071
01:30:15,374 --> 01:30:17,125
How could you betray me?

1072
01:30:32,933 --> 01:30:34,935
Oh, my God, Carmine.

1073
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:47,197
I had no choice.

1074
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:50,284
- You all saw that.
- You had no choice.

1075
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:51,535
It was fate.

1076
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:55,622
No matter how you feel, you're a hero.

1077
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:01,086
I'm numb.

1078
01:31:01,295 --> 01:31:02,421
Cigarette?

1079
01:31:05,757 --> 01:31:07,092
I'd love one.

1080
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,346
- I had feelings for him.
- I'm sure you did.

1081
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:13,765
A technical matter.

1082
01:31:14,933 --> 01:31:18,228
The money. We need it for evidence.

1083
01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:23,108
It's there in the large tureen.

1084
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,328
Good work, kid.

1085
01:31:35,746 --> 01:31:37,915
We gotta impound the evidence.

1086
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,461
Job well done.
Everybody wait here.

1087
01:31:43,378 --> 01:31:45,547
- Congratulations.
- Come on.

1088
01:31:52,721 --> 01:31:56,183
- I guess we should go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1089
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:58,477
- Son...
- Don't call me son.

1090
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:02,147
- I had no choice.
- You didn't have to turn me in.

1091
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:07,611
- If it was your son...
- I'd have treated him like a son.

1092
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:11,031
I'd treat my stepson
like he was my son.

1093
01:32:12,366 --> 01:32:15,744
- Clark, that animal...
- Dwight, good night!

1094
01:32:16,078 --> 01:32:18,705
Tell Mom I'll call her tomorrow.

1095
01:32:24,878 --> 01:32:26,088
Good night.

1096
01:32:29,675 --> 01:32:31,009
FBI, gentlemen.

1097
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:36,181
Greenwald, Simpson,
you're under arrest for violating...

1098
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:41,645
...your oath of office, conspiracy,
fraud, extortion, RICO Act violation.

1099
01:32:41,854 --> 01:32:43,730
Put the cuffs on them.

1100
01:32:44,648 --> 01:32:46,650
The old man set us up.

1101
01:32:47,276 --> 01:32:48,569
Sabatini?

1102
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:52,906
- With the kid!
- Watch the corn, gentlemen.

1103
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:07,796
I'm getting too old for this nonsense.

1104
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,548
We done?

1105
01:33:11,675 --> 01:33:13,552
We're done.

1106
01:33:15,471 --> 01:33:18,182
- How are you doing?
- I'm a wreck.

1107
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:21,935
Sorry to interrupt,
but they're restless.

1108
01:33:22,478 --> 01:33:26,940
All right, Hans,
what are we serving for dinner?

1109
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:29,276
Hawaiian tiger fish...

1110
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:33,030
...mixed with smoked turkey
from Virginia.

1111
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:34,698
Smoked turkey?

1112
01:33:35,115 --> 01:33:36,742
It's all a scam?

1113
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:40,704
- The Gourmet thing?
- This is an ugly word, "scam."

1114
01:33:41,038 --> 01:33:42,873
This is business.

1115
01:33:43,123 --> 01:33:45,626
In business, this is what you do.

1116
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:04,394
<i>$350, 000 for smoked turkey.</i>

1117
01:34:04,645 --> 01:34:08,482
<i>But the Gourmet Club
had a great last night.</i>

1118
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:13,153
<i>Dwight went back to Vermont.
Greenwald and Simpson went to jail.</i>

1119
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:19,409
<i>The animals went to the Bronx Zoo's
Sabatini Endangered Species Wing.</i>

1120
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:24,331
<i>Carmine was a philanthropist now.
And me? I was just a student.</i>

1121
01:34:40,806 --> 01:34:44,268
- You wouldn't have done it.
- Of course not.

1122
01:34:44,518 --> 01:34:46,854
That's why we never told you.

1123
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,858
He knew that Dwight
was my stepfather...

1124
01:34:51,108 --> 01:34:55,028
...and he'd call Fish and Wildlife?
- Of course.

1125
01:34:55,946 --> 01:34:59,575
- He's like a genius.
- He's like a genius.

1126
01:35:10,252 --> 01:35:11,920
<i>Good night, Liebchen.</i>

1127
01:35:13,464 --> 01:35:18,135
You've always been my great love.
I can say it since I'm leaving.

1128
01:35:19,595 --> 01:35:22,222
Fantastic job, young man.
Great!

1129
01:35:29,605 --> 01:35:32,774
We're going to some clubs.
Nice work.

1130
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:34,359
Take it easy.

1131
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:43,076
The show's over.

1132
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,370
<i>So marriage is...</i>

1133
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:47,080
Please.

1134
01:35:47,831 --> 01:35:51,001
- Good. Not that l...
- I know.

1135
01:35:51,835 --> 01:35:55,172
- Tell you what I'd really like.
- What's that?

1136
01:35:56,089 --> 01:35:59,343
I want to spend the night
in your dorm room.

1137
01:35:59,593 --> 01:36:02,596
- Really?
- Yes, very much.

1138
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:07,935
I would love that. Get to know
each other under calm circumstances.

1139
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:41,301
I'll go help Vic.

1140
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:49,935
It's all over now.
You can go back to Vermont.

1141
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:51,603
You remember?

1142
01:36:52,437 --> 01:36:53,897
I always knew.

1143
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:59,153
I'm sorry you had to
go through this nonsense, but...

1144
01:36:59,403 --> 01:37:02,114
...it turned out good.
- Sure.

1145
01:37:02,364 --> 01:37:05,242
<i>It was just...
It just was.</i>

1146
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:10,747
I'll tell you something.
You were brave.

1147
01:37:11,165 --> 01:37:14,543
- I was proud of you.
- Thank you.

1148
01:37:16,128 --> 01:37:20,507
Anyway, I hope you have a good life.

1149
01:37:31,185 --> 01:37:32,519
You know...

1150
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:37,774
...I meant everything I told you.

1151
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:19,691
What's the matter with you?
You turned out to be a bum.

1152
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,568
Come on, come on.

1153
01:38:22,236 --> 01:38:27,449
If it weren't for me,
you could have been a handbag.

1154
01:38:28,325 --> 01:38:32,579
- He don't want to walk.
- They don't really walk.

1155
01:38:34,748 --> 01:38:37,709
I'll get him. I can pick him up.

1156
01:38:39,086 --> 01:38:41,171
- Let me help you.
- I got him.

1157
01:38:47,511 --> 01:38:49,555
I want to tell you something.

1158
01:38:49,763 --> 01:38:53,267
When you finish film school,
I'd like to call you.

1159
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:58,772
I know a lot of people in Hollywood.
I could open some doors for you.

1160
01:38:59,106 --> 01:39:01,775
Give you some opportunities.

1161
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:07,072
- No, I don't think that's necessary.
- Really, it's easy for me.

1162
01:39:07,322 --> 01:39:11,827
I just make a phone call
and make it easy for you.
