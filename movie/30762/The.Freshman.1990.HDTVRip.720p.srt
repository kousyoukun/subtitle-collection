1
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:43,915
Over there. Look.

2
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:47,752
Dwight, don't!

3
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:50,129
Asshole!

4
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:54,759
Are you nuts? You can't see the cap?
It's not orange enough?

5
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:57,303
Get out of these woods!

6
00:01:57,553 --> 00:02:02,016
- I can hunt here. I got a permit.
- Lf he's got a permit...

7
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,185
Get out!

8
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:12,151
Let's go.

9
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:17,115
<i>That's Dwight Armstrong,
my stepfather.</i>

10
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,117
<i>Accent on "step."</i>

11
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:21,411
<i>He's a lawyer.</i>

12
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:25,373
<i>And he's head of
"The Friends of Fish and Wildlife"...</i>

13
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:28,710
<i>... an extremist pro-mammal group
in Vermont.</i>

14
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:33,715
<i>Almost all its members, male
and female, look like Dwight.</i>

15
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:37,510
<i>My real dad died
in a motorcycle wreck when I was 6.</i>

16
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,264
<i>Two years later,
Mom met Mr. Personality.</i>

17
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:44,142
<i>It has not been a barrel of laughs.</i>

18
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:07,749
<i>There was a certain poignancy
about today's hunting party.</i>

19
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,334
<i>It was my last evening at home.</i>

20
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:15,965
<i>Tomorrow I was beginning my first year
at New York University film school.</i>

21
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,135
<i>A freshman. That was me.</i>

22
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:31,189
<i>My farewell dinner was
raucous and hilarious...</i>

23
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,817
<i>... full of warm, good feelings.</i>

24
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,366
That should cover it.

25
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:45,453
<i>Dwight gave me $600 spending
money...</i>

26
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:48,373
<i>... and a hearty handshake.</i>

27
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:25,618
- Where's the subway?
- Downstairs.

28
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,328
- That way?
- Right.

29
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,553
Sorry.

30
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:54,397
Forget it. He's out like a light.

31
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:56,649
The shame of the cities.

32
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,444
- Nothing broken?
- I'm okay.

33
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:01,904
That was a nasty spill.

34
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,948
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

35
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:08,619
- I'll give you a hand with those bags.
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

36
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,456
You're a smart kid.

37
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:12,915
Rule 1:

38
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:18,296
Don't let anybody touch your bags
unless you know that person is bonded.

39
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:19,547
Thanks.

40
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:23,051
I'm bonded, which is your good fortune.

41
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,388
Ignore her.

42
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,892
Who's this stranger talking to you?

43
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:34,729
It's Victor Ray of the
Victor Ray Car Service.

44
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,106
On your way to college, right?

45
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,525
- New York University.
- Good school.

46
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:42,862
Thanks. Do you know
where the subway is?

47
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:46,324
- You don't want the subway.
- Yes, I do.

48
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,952
- It's over there.
- Thanks.

49
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:58,169
In New York, we have
three distinct social classes.

50
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:02,799
A: People who make a billion dollars a
day and get laid in Trump Tower.

51
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,387
B: People who live in Times Square and
eat Yankee Doodles on the sidewalk.

52
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:10,682
C: Me.
Guys I call "the glue of society."

53
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:14,227
We go, "Forget about it."
All hell will break loose.

54
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:18,523
- Rich against poor.
- We're on the brink. It's seething.

55
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:21,859
Come with me.

56
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:26,280
For $65, you get an air-conditioned
ride and peace of mind.

57
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,032
No, I can't afford that.

58
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:31,369
I'll take you for the old rate, fifty.

59
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:33,746
No, it's out of my league.

60
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:37,375
- How much can you go for?
- I don't know.

61
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:42,547
- Forty, which for me is charity.
- Ten dollars I can manage.

62
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:44,424
Ten dollars?

63
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:48,136
For delivery and security in a
mint-condition Bonneville?

64
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,512
I have to eat.

65
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:54,225
I can't do better.
I'll walk or take a bus.

66
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:56,728
Okay, ten bucks.

67
00:06:57,395 --> 00:07:00,857
I'll take you for ten bucks,
but on one condition.

68
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:05,194
Promise you won't tell anybody.
Word gets out, I'm finished.

69
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:08,990
- I won't tell a soul.
- Follow me.

70
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:11,534
I'm parked in a reserved spot.

71
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,202
Let's go. Come on.

72
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:14,996
Watch out!

73
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,458
Watch out! Suicide attempt, right?

74
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:22,545
It's bigger than I imagined.

75
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:27,091
That's true of many things in Manhattan.
The other boroughs too.

76
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,052
Tremendous things in Queens.

77
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:33,056
Go to the trunk.
It opens from the inside.

78
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:37,769
Take everything.
You'd be surprised how many people...

79
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,442
Stop the car!

80
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:49,280
Stop the car, please!

81
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:06,214
<i>I'd been in New York 19 minutes 11
seconds, and I was already ruined.</i>

82
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:19,435
Action.

83
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:22,689
The roommate enters. Come on in.

84
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:25,983
Don't be afraid. That's it. Come in.

85
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:30,822
I'm holding you in a medium shot.
A lovely shot. Very cinematic.

86
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:33,074
My name is Clark Kel...

87
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:36,953
A little confused. I like it.
It sells.

88
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,707
I like actors who think
in front of the camera.

89
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:44,210
- I'm moving in.
- Is this the right room?

90
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,212
Cut.

91
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:49,590
That's a wrap. Check it.

92
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:52,010
Kellogg?

93
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:53,428
You're...?

94
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,847
- Steve Bushak.
- How do you do?

95
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,807
Really nice to meet you.

96
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,520
I should go to the police.

97
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:06,107
Kojak is a fictional character.

98
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:09,944
- Don't involve the police.
- So I'm just a victim.

99
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,698
Everybody in this city is a victim.

100
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:16,743
Welcome to New York.

101
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,584
I'm deeply moved.

102
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,295
I understand your position, but...

103
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:32,467
For Introduction to Film you must own
Fleeber's "Viewpoints in Cinema..."

104
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:36,054
...and "Selected Readings in Cinema,"
by...

105
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:37,347
...Fleeber.

106
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:39,515
I want to buy your books...

107
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:42,101
They aren't "my" books, Mr. Kellogg.

108
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:47,065
They are essential reading, as are
the 12 other books you must own...

109
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:49,609
...and which will cost over $700.

110
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:15,218
I'm doing a paper, "And The Wheels Go
Slow: Form and Function in "42nd St."

111
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:20,515
That would be a very interesting idea.
Take a musical...

112
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:23,142
Call your family for more money.

113
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,687
My stepfather won't help me out.

114
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,772
This is out of Dickens.

115
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:31,275
Robbed by a street urchin.
A wicked stepfather.

116
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:33,069
I don't know what to say.

117
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,824
I'm trying to explain that I can't
get the books now.

118
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:40,993
I'm a faculty advisor,
not a caseworker.

119
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:44,539
I'm only interested
in your academic career.

120
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:48,418
And you're off to an extraordinarily
unimpressive start.

121
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:53,589
I'm sorry,
but being new to New York...

122
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:08,104
Excuse me. I have to leave now.

123
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:18,156
Hey! Excuse me.

124
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:34,505
Hey, wait up!

125
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:37,884
Stop him! Wait!

126
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,152
Watch it!

127
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:03,743
I want my money and my stuff. Now!

128
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,333
My money or I call the cops!

129
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,377
No English!

130
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:15,380
Knock it off! I know who you are!

131
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:17,173
Where's my stuff?

132
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:20,343
Upstairs. Give me a hand with this.

133
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:22,553
You crazy?

134
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:27,767
I victimized you in a moment of
weakness and now justice is done.

135
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,102
Give me a hand.

136
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:35,775
My money.

137
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,069
Do you have my money?

138
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:40,446
Watch your step. Floors are wet.

139
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:45,618
- Give me the money immediately...
- I'd love to do just that.

140
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:47,620
However...

141
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:51,416
...here we have an awkward moment.

142
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,293
Tragically...

143
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:56,921
...I have a gambling problem.

144
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,925
I placed a wager on a horse.
Predictably.

145
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:04,178
You lost my money on a horse?
All of it?

146
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,973
Now, I'm not sure it was a horse.

147
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:09,267
Oh, God. Oh, God.

148
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,728
I swear, it was a responsible bet.

149
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:15,648
It was a 4-to-1 shot. What can I say?
Took a beating.

150
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,943
But I still got most of your clothes.

151
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,945
I'm going to the police.

152
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,367
Police? You're a college student.
I'm a working man. No police.

153
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:30,997
No? Robbery is still a crime
in New York. It's not legal.

154
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,624
It depends on the circumstances.

155
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,668
Bullshit.

156
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:40,006
I'll get you a job.
An unbelievable opportunity.

157
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:43,634
- You're just the guy.
- I'm serious. In fact...

158
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,887
No, forget about it.

159
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:52,560
- What?
- No.

160
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,397
It's irresponsible of me.
So much money.

161
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,317
What is it?

162
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:03,696
I shouldn't offer you this job.

163
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:05,990
But I'm in an awkward position...

164
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,870
...between my feelings of guilt towards
you and my family obligations.

165
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,705
I don't know what you mean.

166
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:16,793
I'm offering you a job
that I promised to my sister's kid.

167
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:20,713
Perfect for a college student.
Flexible hours, big money.

168
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:25,176
My sister will kill me. She'll get a
gun and blow my brains out.

169
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:29,305
What kind of work? Stealing cars?

170
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:34,143
If you're going to be a cynic...

171
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:38,147
You expect me to trust you
after you steal everything I own?

172
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:43,194
Don't do anything you don't want to.
I'm giving you a choice is all.

173
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:46,364
If you want to make serious money...

174
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:50,368
...be at this address
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

175
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:56,124
"120 Hester Street.
Old World Social Club."

176
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:59,961
You'll work for my Uncle Carmine.
A great man.

177
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:03,881
He's the smart one in the family.

178
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,426
Look who's here! Don't be shy.
Come right in.

179
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:50,595
I wasn't sure this was it.

180
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:53,056
This is it.
Best neighbourhood in New York.

181
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:56,934
Uncle Carmine's waiting for you.
Here we go.

182
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:06,235
There at the desk. That's him.

183
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:09,364
- He's your uncle?
- Yeah. Do me a favour.

184
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:12,658
Don't say anything about my gambling.

185
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:19,832
I said, "How are you doing?"

186
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,293
"Very well," he says.

187
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:23,586
Hello.

188
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:27,006
This is my good friend Clark,
from Kansas.

189
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:28,341
Vermont.

190
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:36,015
"My heart is filled with much
happiness in meeting you," he says.

191
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:41,104
God Almighty.

192
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:47,026
You notice the resemblance, right?

193
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:49,696
He's the real thing. The original.

194
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:53,199
When they saw him,
they based the movie...

195
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,369
So is he a Mafia guy?

196
00:16:56,619 --> 00:17:01,040
No, local businessman. Importer.
That's it.

197
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:04,043
- What a kisser.
- Unbelievable.

198
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:12,927
This is my uncle, Carmine Sabatini.

199
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:17,890
Uncle Carmine, this is Clark.
You never told me your last name.

200
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,560
- Kellogg.
- Just like the cereal.

201
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:24,063
Like the breakfast cereal.

202
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:26,858
Your resemblance to...

203
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:29,527
- Clark, have a seat.
- Pull up a chair.

204
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:41,122
- Would you like a nut?
- No, thank you.

205
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:44,459
None for me, Uncle Carmine.

206
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:50,089
Did you ever try Italian coffee?

207
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:51,549
No.

208
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:55,720
- Would you like to try a little taste?
- Yeah. Why not?

209
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:58,723
- Good.
- None for me, Uncle Carmine.

210
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,521
"Two espressos," he says.

211
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:11,736
That picture on the wall
wouldn't by any chance be Mussolini?

212
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:15,073
It ain't Tony Bennett.

213
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:20,119
Some older members of the club...

214
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:24,457
...they keep it up there for sentiment.

215
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:27,251
- Sentiment.
- The old days.

216
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,546
For the old days.
For good or for bad.

217
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:34,801
It would be like, for you,
a picture of the Beatles.

218
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:38,930
They're actually before my time.

219
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,808
Whatever. You understand.

220
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:46,187
You don't keep the picture up
for political reasons.

221
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:48,314
No. It's not political.

222
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:50,566
It's definitely not political.

223
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,152
My nephew says you're from Kansas.

224
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:55,905
Vermont.

225
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:59,826
Six of one, half-dozen of the other.

226
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:04,497
The most important thing
is that we're all Americans.

227
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,167
Right.

228
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,838
Good, Lorenzo. Thank you.

229
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,842
- "Thank you," he says.
- I know.

230
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,304
Now this is real Italian coffee.

231
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:24,809
It's not like regular coffee.
Know what I mean?

232
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:29,856
It's a little strong,
so we put a little sugar in.

233
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:38,197
It cuts the strength.
Maybe a little more.

234
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:43,202
All right. Drink it down. One gulp.

235
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:56,799
Puts hair on your chest.

236
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:01,095
Did my nephew explain this job to you?

237
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,222
No, not really.

238
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:07,477
It's best if you explain it,
Uncle Carmine.

239
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:15,026
It's not complicated work, but it
must be done right, like all things.

240
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:21,324
Tomorrow at 1 pm, outside the club,
will be parked a car.

241
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:23,576
What is it called?

242
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:25,411
Sedan De Ville.

243
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:28,665
- Sedan De Ville.
- That's a type of Cadillac.

244
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:29,999
A Cadillac.

245
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,585
Yeah, this is a type of Cadillac.

246
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:37,924
Now, I want you to drive this car
to the JFK cargo terminal.

247
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:43,971
There you will pick up a package
addressed to Larry London.

248
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:49,602
Deliver this package to Cherry Hill,
New Jersey. That's it.

249
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,313
Is that far?

250
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:55,900
Not more than 3 hours, the whole trip.

251
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,528
Depends on traffic.

252
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,196
You never know.

253
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:02,615
You could get there in no time...

254
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:07,745
...or sit in traffic for hours
with your dick in your hand.

255
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:16,504
That's why I need someone
who can use his head...

256
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:21,175
...who won't get upset, emotional or
nervous no matter what happens.

257
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:24,512
Right. I understand that.

258
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:29,142
For this service,
I'm going to pay you $500.

259
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,645
$500?

260
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:35,481
See why my sister's so pissed?

261
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,859
I mean, angry, beside herself.

262
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:41,195
You'll pull in at least a grand a week.

263
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:43,197
A thousand dollars a week?

264
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:46,909
I'm going to need two trips a week,
minimum.

265
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:51,080
Of course, if things get busy,
then maybe more.

266
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,377
I hadn't thought of that much money.

267
00:22:00,423 --> 00:22:01,632
I don't know.

268
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:06,429
- You don't know what?
- Wait. Hold on.

269
00:22:07,513 --> 00:22:10,933
Let him think.
This is a sign of intelligence.

270
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:15,021
He's trying to understand
the nature of this job.

271
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:17,690
So, what are your thoughts, Kent?

272
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:19,692
Clark.

273
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:21,569
Sorry. Clark.

274
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:26,532
I have to ask you something.

275
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:31,245
Don't take it wrong.

276
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:34,290
No, anything, go ahead.

277
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:40,797
I smell a rat.

278
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,341
A rat?

279
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:46,886
He smells a rat.

280
00:22:48,304 --> 00:22:49,597
That's right.

281
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:56,938
Know why you smell a rat?
Because God gave you a brain.

282
00:22:57,188 --> 00:23:01,067
Because you're asking yourself,
"Clark, what is this?

283
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:06,864
A man will pay me $500 a trip
to deliver a package?"

284
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:11,244
- This is what you think?
- Right. That's what I'm feeling.

285
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:13,997
This is natural. Natural.

286
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:15,915
So then you understand.

287
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:19,419
Sure.
I understand a thousand percent.

288
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,634
Give me your hand.

289
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:37,270
You know what this is?

290
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:39,814
This handshake?

291
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:42,775
We call this the hand of friendship.

292
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,152
We?

293
00:23:46,237 --> 00:23:50,533
You don't know what this is.
The hand of friendship from my Uncle.

294
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:53,244
I want you to take this opportunity.

295
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:56,664
Totally legitimate work
for $1000 a week.

296
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:58,875
I know you won't disappoint me.

297
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,128
How can I say no?

298
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,635
This is not a yes.

299
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,559
I want to hear a yes.

300
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,151
Yes.

301
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:29,155
Good.

302
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:33,743
Good. Now I'm happy. I'm so happy.

303
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:36,037
I don't know why I'm so happy.

304
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:37,288
That's good.

305
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,416
Everybody up.

306
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,507
Come to my house in Queens tonight.
He's going to...

307
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:51,094
You can get the keys.
I'll give you directions.

308
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:57,767
I have such good feelings about you.

309
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:02,563
I'm absolutely filled with emotion.

310
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,985
I never had a son.

311
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:22,166
In 15 years, I never saw him
take to anybody like that.

312
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,710
Never.

313
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,264
<i>Senator.</i>

314
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:40,727
<i>We're both part of the same hypocrisy.</i>

315
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,606
<i>Never think it applies to my family.</i>

316
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:48,693
<i>All right. All right.</i>

317
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,613
<i>Some people have to play little games.</i>

318
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,699
<i>You play yours.</i>

319
00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:01,497
<i>Let's just say you'll pay me because
it's in your interest to pay me.</i>

320
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:04,751
<i>I want your answer and the money
by tomorrow.</i>

321
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:08,963
<i>And one more thing.
Don't you contact me again, ever.</i>

322
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,633
<i>From now on, you deal with Turnbull.</i>

323
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:17,722
<i>Senator, you can have my answer now.</i>

324
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:22,393
<i>My offer is this. Nothing.</i>

325
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:25,271
<i>Not even the fee for the gaming
license...</i>

326
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,108
<i>... which I would appreciate if you
would put up personally.</i>

327
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:34,572
"Senator, my offer is this:

328
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:36,866
Nothing."

329
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:41,829
In that one moment, Michael Corleone
says that all corruption is equal.

330
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:46,959
That there is no separation between
politics and gangsterism.

331
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:51,506
<i>As discussed in the Fleeber treatise,
Guns and Provolone...</i>

332
00:26:51,714 --> 00:26:55,760
...what are the similarities between
Karl Marx's "Das Kapital..."

333
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:59,138
<i>...lmmanuel Kant's
Critique of Pure Reason...</i>

334
00:26:59,347 --> 00:27:02,809
...and the Lake Tahoe scene from
"Godfather II"?

335
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:08,648
You haven't read the Fleeber piece?

336
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:11,109
Well, in an evolving society...

337
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,736
You need help from Mr. Bushak?

338
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:20,076
He might enjoy helping you write
a five-page answer to my question.

339
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:22,829
I want it on my desk by noon tomorrow.

340
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:26,582
In an evolving society...

341
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:30,378
...violence and narcissism replace...
- Oh, shut up!

342
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,881
I hate this guy.

343
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:53,818
You're Clark?

344
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,570
Yes, I'm Clark.

345
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,823
I'm Tina, Carmine Sabatini's
only daughter.

346
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:03,536
- I didn't know he had a daughter, only.
- He does. I'm her.

347
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:05,246
Come in.

348
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:19,594
This is quite a house. Very European.

349
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:23,014
Can I get you a drink?
Beer? Sprite?

350
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:24,599
No, thanks.

351
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:28,770
Jesus, look at that.

352
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,941
Wow, what a job they did!

353
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:35,610
Job?

354
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,989
Copying job.
Down to the cracks and everything.

355
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,450
This isn't a copy. This is it.

356
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,118
Right.

357
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:45,787
I'm very serious.

358
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:47,997
This has to be a copy.

359
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,462
Do you remember about 10 years ago
the original toured the country?

360
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:55,838
It did?

361
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,549
They brought it over from the Louvre.

362
00:28:58,758 --> 00:28:59,801
Who?

363
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:02,011
I don't know who. They.

364
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,889
It was in the United States.

365
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,557
And...?

366
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:10,353
And it stayed here.

367
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:15,066
The one they shipped back to Paris,
the one behind all the glass...

368
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:18,820
...that the tourists take pictures of
is the copy.

369
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:21,781
My dad thought it was just awful.

370
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:25,159
A masterpiece behind such thick glass.

371
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,206
He had such a special feeling for it
his whole life.

372
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,667
Sort of an obsession.

373
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,128
He ripped it off? The "Mona Lisa"?

374
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:39,173
The day it arrived here I was 9.

375
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:43,094
My dad took it out of this huge crate.

376
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:46,806
There was Styrofoam
and newspaper everywhere.

377
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,183
And suddenly...

378
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:51,436
...there it was.

379
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,980
And he turned to me...

380
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,691
...l'll never forget this...

381
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,277
...and he said:

382
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:02,780
"Now I'm happy.

383
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:07,201
Now I got the "Mona Lisa."

384
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,539
It's safe here in Queens?

385
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:21,632
People don't steal from my father.

386
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,384
- They don't?
- No.

387
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:33,936
- You want to dance?
- Here?

388
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,237
- It's kind of hot.
- Take your sweater off.

389
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:18,272
My dad tells me you're from Nebraska.

390
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:19,899
Vermont.

391
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:22,610
What do you think of New York?

392
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,448
I stopped thinking 24 hours ago.
I'm going on pure instinct.

393
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:35,289
That's what you should do in New York.

394
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:47,176
Is your father here now?

395
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,848
He's in the Bronx at some meeting.

396
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:59,272
Aunt Angelina?

397
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:04,068
My head's killing me.
I'm going to bed.

398
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:07,530
This is Clark. Dad mentioned him.

399
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,616
Clark. The boy working for Dad.

400
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:14,787
I'm going to bed.
Watch "Jeopardy." You come up?

401
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:17,206
After Clark leaves.

402
00:32:17,874 --> 00:32:19,334
Good night, Aunt Angelina.

403
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:24,464
Dad's sister.

404
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:28,051
She moved in when my mother died.
I was 4.

405
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,677
I was 6.

406
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,764
- Your mom?
- No, my dad.

407
00:32:32,972 --> 00:32:34,724
But it's never the same.

408
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:37,727
No, but what can you do?

409
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:39,187
Nothing.

410
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,813
Nothing.

411
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:45,985
I'll get you the keys to the car.

412
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:50,823
I'm a sophomore at the College of the
Sacred Virgin. Don't laugh.

413
00:32:51,032 --> 00:32:54,410
- Next year I'm going to Harvard.
- Harvard?

414
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:59,624
That's something. I didn't apply there,
with my high school grades.

415
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,834
Not that they were terrible.

416
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:05,171
My grades are nothing special.
About a B-.

417
00:33:05,672 --> 00:33:09,676
How did you get in?
Your Boards must have been monsters.

418
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:11,052
It's Dad.

419
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,390
He told Harvard I wanted to go,
and they said, "Sure."

420
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:21,479
Are we talking about the same Harvard?
In Cambridge, Massachusetts?

421
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:24,607
Of course. Harvard needs my dad.

422
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:29,654
They don't want strikes
by the janitors or gardeners.

423
00:33:29,862 --> 00:33:32,281
All those old trees and lawns.

424
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,033
But he's an importer.

425
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:35,743
Right?

426
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,414
It's great meeting you, Clark.

427
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:43,418
A guy from Vermont.
Real American New England-y.

428
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:44,711
Hold on.

429
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,007
- He's an importer. Just tell me.
- He's an importer. Yes.

430
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:52,969
An extremely powerful importer.
There are such people.

431
00:33:53,803 --> 00:33:55,138
So what is it?

432
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,891
- What is what?
- The package at the airport.

433
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:03,396
Hint. It's big.
Bring someone to help you out.

434
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:04,897
What is it?

435
00:34:05,106 --> 00:34:07,400
If Dad didn't tell you, I can't.

436
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:13,364
It's not going to be a dead guy
in a box or something, is it?

437
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:17,910
What an imagination.

438
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,542
You're so unbelievably cute.

439
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:28,171
I'll see you again.
I could just eat you up.

440
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:33,634
Good luck tomorrow.

441
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:52,111
You boys need me?

442
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:58,368
- You Leo?
- I am Big Leo.

443
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:02,580
- It just says Leo.
- We are the same. Leo and Big Leo.

444
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:06,542
- You're synonymous.
- That's right.

445
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:14,217
Okay, come with me.

446
00:35:15,134 --> 00:35:16,969
You don't bring it out?

447
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,222
No. Not this I don't.

448
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:37,573
"Not this I don't."
Remember those words.

449
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:39,242
Not very encouraging.

450
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:45,123
Here it is. All yours.

451
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:49,335
It arrived this morning
on the redeye from Borneo.

452
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:53,673
I'm going to puke my guts out.

453
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:57,719
- What is it?
- A lizard.

454
00:35:58,302 --> 00:36:02,640
- That thing is a lizard?
- They call it the Komodo dragon.

455
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,437
Lives in Indonesia, Sumatra,
Komodo Island, in point of fact.

456
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,065
And tell Mr. Sabatini that this one...

457
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:15,028
...was eight bills extra.
- Excuse me?

458
00:36:15,278 --> 00:36:18,948
Just tell him. He'll understand.
Sign here by the X.

459
00:36:19,198 --> 00:36:20,533
Recipient.

460
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,620
- That's me.
- You're the recipient.

461
00:36:26,122 --> 00:36:29,292
Put him in the back seat
with the windows open.

462
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:31,377
The gills need fresh air.

463
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:34,255
He doesn't have any gills.

464
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:37,884
Whatever. That's what I was told.
Fresh air.

465
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:41,554
And make sure you get
a seat belt on him, because...

466
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:43,806
...if he jumps on you...

467
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,809
...you got major troubles.

468
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:49,354
Major troubles.

469
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:52,982
Down, boy.

470
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:54,484
It's not a dog.

471
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:59,322
You know what?
We got to pick him up.

472
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,450
Pick him up.

473
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:05,328
- With what?
- With our hands.

474
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:07,914
It's not that bad.

475
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:11,084
I'll help you,
but I won't risk my life.

476
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,378
- Help. For God's sake.
- Sorry.

477
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,007
- I refuse to handle this animal.
- He's going under the truck.

478
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:25,056
- Get the door.
- You locked it, remember?

479
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:29,936
Take him.

480
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:31,437
Just for a second.

481
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:33,981
You're the recipient.

482
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:39,570
If he stains my suit, I'll be pissed.

483
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,574
Could you take any longer?

484
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:53,543
Okay, you go around
and get the other side.

485
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:55,878
Major trouble.

486
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:03,594
Put the seat belt on him.

487
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:06,681
- You're joking.
- I'm not joking.

488
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:10,893
This is precious cargo,
this freaking thing.

489
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:15,064
- What seat belt?
- Put him in this one.

490
00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,275
Seat belts.

491
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,278
- Under his armpit.
- What armpit?

492
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:23,197
This lizard armpit.

493
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:26,117
Oh, that lizard armpit. I see.

494
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,828
You know...

495
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,838
- I think he's okay.
- Let's go.

496
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:48,014
Happy as a clam.

497
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,062
- Use the air conditioner.
- He said to leave them open.

498
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,484
Who? Haystack Calhoun? What is he?
A zoologist? I'll take responsibility.

499
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,152
All right.

500
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,622
<i>I told you he'd throw up.</i>

501
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:17,043
I have to open the windows.

502
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:19,087
It's murder.

503
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:25,134
Feeling better? Tummy ache all gone?

504
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:30,348
- It stinks in here.
- I can't take it.

505
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:34,102
We have to wash it off.
Pull into that gas station.

506
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,737
Excuse me. Hello.

507
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:50,827
- I need some water. A hose.
- Around the corner. Help yourself.

508
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:53,705
This way. It's around the back.

509
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:04,817
He went under a car.

510
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:08,613
You go that way.

511
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:45,149
<i>Owner of the reptile,
report to the information booth.</i>

512
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:55,702
- Don't panic.
- What if I can't find him?

513
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,329
Leave the country for 10 years.

514
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:00,999
You're kidding? I'm serious!

515
00:42:20,476 --> 00:42:23,021
<i>Security to Concourse B.</i>

516
00:42:57,305 --> 00:42:59,098
Okay, go.

517
00:43:08,316 --> 00:43:10,151
Slowly.

518
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:13,071
I'm losing him.

519
00:43:20,787 --> 00:43:22,163
I'm afraid now.

520
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:51,818
Mr. London?

521
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:54,445
Edward?

522
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:57,699
Look!

523
00:43:58,616 --> 00:43:59,951
It's here!

524
00:44:00,326 --> 00:44:01,369
Finally.

525
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:05,123
- Are you Edward?
- I am.

526
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:08,668
Oh, what a beautiful specimen.

527
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:15,466
Has this bad boy been swimming?

528
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:18,845
We took him right here
from the airport.

529
00:44:19,095 --> 00:44:21,889
They just love swimming pools.
But...

530
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:24,308
...chlorine.

531
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:33,359
I told him he is
very disobedient dragon.

532
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:36,821
For joke.

533
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:40,658
It's a good joke. Very unusual.

534
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,578
Without humour, what do we have?

535
00:44:56,507 --> 00:44:58,176
Beautiful, yes?

536
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,764
- This is like a zoo?
- This is like a zoo.

537
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:07,769
Can you believe this?

538
00:45:10,438 --> 00:45:14,275
- So, do you exhibit rare animals?
- On occasion.

539
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:19,280
Who are these boys?

540
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,536
Carmine said one boy...

541
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:27,622
...here are two.

542
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:33,086
This is Mr. Larry London.

543
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:40,593
- Mr. London, I'm Clark Kellogg.
- Carmine said one boy...

544
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:42,762
...here are two.

545
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:49,811
I realize that, sir. We are two boys,
as you quite rightly point out.

546
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:55,400
However, I'm somewhat
new to the area...

547
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,612
...and this particular parcel
was quite bulky...

548
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:05,243
<i>...so at the suggestion of Tina...
- Ah, die schöne Tina.</i>

549
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,705
The beautiful Tina.

550
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:13,167
Yes, the beautiful Tina.

551
00:46:14,669 --> 00:46:17,422
If there was a misunderstanding...

552
00:46:17,964 --> 00:46:20,341
Carmine said one boy...

553
00:46:21,175 --> 00:46:23,386
...and here are two.

554
00:46:25,388 --> 00:46:27,390
You gotta like this guy.

555
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,186
Smells like basil.

556
00:46:32,478 --> 00:46:33,688
Very good.

557
00:46:34,647 --> 00:46:36,899
A cream basil sauce.

558
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,818
You're a chef?

559
00:46:40,153 --> 00:46:42,071
I wasn't clear what you did.

560
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:45,700
Now you'll get your money.

561
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:48,953
The money...

562
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:55,001
The money is conveyed
in a brown paper bag.

563
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:05,470
- Not very attractive, I know.
- No problem, sir.

564
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,723
If you count it, I won't mind.

565
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:14,562
That won't be necessary.
I trust you and Mr. Sabatini.

566
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:24,906
That means,
"My heart swims in blood."

567
00:47:33,247 --> 00:47:36,501
That's a Bengal tiger,
ladies and gentleman.

568
00:47:36,751 --> 00:47:39,629
Something is way off.
Way off.

569
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,805
<i>How are you, darling?
How's New York?</i>

570
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:53,351
I miss you too. Like crazy...

571
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:57,313
...at the risk of sounding like a mother.

572
00:47:57,772 --> 00:48:00,858
No, he's asleep, thank God. Why?

573
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:04,612
Well, the thing is I got this job.

574
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:08,992
New York is unbelievably expensive.
I had to.

575
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:14,205
It involved driving...

576
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:18,001
...and picking up a reptile.

577
00:48:18,543 --> 00:48:20,920
What kind of a reptile?
I don't...

578
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:25,133
<i>- It's a Komodo dragon.
- Who? Komodo dragon?</i>

579
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,053
<i>- I never heard of it.
- Then could you look it up?</i>

580
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:40,481
<i>- Komodo? Is that with a K?
- Right.</i>

581
00:48:42,817 --> 00:48:44,193
Koala.

582
00:48:45,028 --> 00:48:46,070
Kodiak.

583
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:48,031
Komodo dragon. Here.

584
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:51,826
"Latin name is" Varanus komodoensis.

585
00:48:52,118 --> 00:48:54,912
Main prey are deer and wild pig.

586
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:59,542
<i>There are seven dragons
in zoos outside Indonesia. "</i>

587
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:03,463
<i>- Oh, my God! Oh, Clark.
- What?</i>

588
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:06,799
"Chances for survival
are considered hopeless."

589
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,177
It's an endangered species.

590
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,179
<i>My God.</i>

591
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:16,225
<i>- Are you sure?
- There's a red asterisk next to it.</i>

592
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:19,187
<i>That means virtually extinct.</i>

593
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:22,940
<i>- What's this job?
- Never mind, I'll quit.</i>

594
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:24,859
A Komodo dragon.

595
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:28,363
<i>Don't worry. I didn't know.</i>

596
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:39,624
That's him.

597
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,251
You sure?

598
00:49:42,502 --> 00:49:47,465
Absolutely. That's Dwight Armstrong's
stepson. Unbelievable.

599
00:49:56,808 --> 00:49:58,810
Is Mr. Sabatini here?

600
00:49:59,185 --> 00:50:01,187
Yes. Come in.

601
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,650
Charlie, wait a minute.

602
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:10,405
General Motors went down 10 points,
and you didn't call?

603
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:14,617
What about Polaroid?

604
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:18,037
It went down?

605
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,665
Down what?

606
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:31,134
I told you before,
I don't like it when they go down.

607
00:50:34,012 --> 00:50:36,889
I used to have another broker.

608
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:40,018
He bought stocks for me
that went down.

609
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:42,687
And it got very unpleasant.

610
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,857
Very unpleasant.

611
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,236
Wait a minute. That's right.

612
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:57,201
Next time you call me,
I want to hear good news.

613
00:50:58,036 --> 00:51:00,747
Right? That's only good news.

614
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:06,085
I must be getting soft.

615
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:07,920
Business.

616
00:51:08,379 --> 00:51:12,383
Business in this country
is run by children, not men.

617
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:16,512
Anyway. Forget it.

618
00:51:16,763 --> 00:51:19,807
- A nice espresso?
- No, thank you.

619
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,146
Sir, I have to talk to you.

620
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:28,107
I want to tell you something.

621
00:51:28,316 --> 00:51:33,738
Larry London called me.
He couldn't stop talking.

622
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,908
He went on and on.

623
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:41,663
He's a very interesting man.

624
00:51:42,497 --> 00:51:46,626
- I heard of the adventure at the mall.
- You did?

625
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:48,419
Of course.

626
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:55,093
Clark, what's on your mind?

627
00:51:55,301 --> 00:51:59,514
I have to talk to you.
It's about these...

628
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:07,146
- It's about these reptiles.
- What about them?

629
00:52:08,064 --> 00:52:09,524
They're endangered.

630
00:52:10,316 --> 00:52:13,528
Not anymore. They're fine in Jersey.

631
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:17,824
It's against the law
to bring them here.

632
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:19,659
It's a crime.

633
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:23,663
You're speaking in generalities.

634
00:52:24,038 --> 00:52:26,833
You said my work here was legitimate.

635
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,794
It's perfectly legitimate.

636
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:31,379
No, it's not.

637
00:52:32,005 --> 00:52:35,383
I'm illegally transporting
endangered species.

638
00:52:35,675 --> 00:52:38,928
Please, sir,
I'd like to be let out.

639
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:46,227
This is an impossibility.

640
00:52:47,353 --> 00:52:48,896
What do you mean?

641
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:53,026
I have a certain standing in business.

642
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,781
How would it look, some college kid
making me look like a fool?

643
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:03,202
This is humiliation.
It's "infamia."

644
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:06,122
Know what people will say?

645
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,253
"What's wrong with him?"
You understand what I'm saying?

646
00:53:14,547 --> 00:53:19,510
I'd never tell a soul.
It wouldn't leave this club.

647
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:22,388
I only meant that...

648
00:53:23,056 --> 00:53:26,934
- Are you trying to hurt my feelings?
- No.

649
00:53:27,435 --> 00:53:29,604
That's not the issue at all.

650
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:33,399
I'm going to tell you something
from my heart.

651
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:37,737
You're a great boy.
You are one of a kind.

652
00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:41,074
Thank you.

653
00:53:41,407 --> 00:53:46,287
The kind of kids I used to have
working for me, the mooks...

654
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:47,997
...the muscleheads.

655
00:53:48,748 --> 00:53:51,751
But you, you're from Connecticut.

656
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:56,964
It's nothing personal.
It's not you.

657
00:53:58,257 --> 00:54:01,761
In any discussion
about our relationship...

658
00:54:02,136 --> 00:54:05,515
...we won't forget
the most important thing.

659
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:07,308
Which is...?

660
00:54:07,517 --> 00:54:09,811
You marrying my daughter.

661
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:13,982
You should have heard Tina.

662
00:54:14,774 --> 00:54:19,904
Clark this, Clark that.
She wants to get married yesterday.

663
00:54:20,154 --> 00:54:24,033
I said, "Wait for spring.
Planning takes time."

664
00:54:24,283 --> 00:54:26,619
The food, place, time of year.

665
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:30,373
Who to invite, who not to invite.
That's important.

666
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:34,627
You got to figure that my
business associates alone...

667
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:36,796
...must be 2000 people.

668
00:54:37,964 --> 00:54:41,801
Not including the senators,
congressmen, judges.

669
00:54:42,051 --> 00:54:44,637
And don't forget the police.

670
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:47,140
But you know, love.

671
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:51,144
Love doesn't ask
these questions, right?

672
00:54:52,228 --> 00:54:55,815
Yeah, I guess.

673
00:54:58,651 --> 00:55:02,488
Come outside.
I got a little surprise for you.

674
00:55:03,823 --> 00:55:05,533
Come on.

675
00:55:07,994 --> 00:55:12,498
I don't know where this talk
of marriage began, but I'm not ready.

676
00:55:12,707 --> 00:55:16,210
I'd like to sample life a little bit first.

677
00:55:16,419 --> 00:55:20,381
Wait. After you get married,
you sample life.

678
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:24,844
This is what men do.
Marriage is an institution.

679
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,722
It's the bedrock of society.

680
00:55:28,181 --> 00:55:31,851
What you're talking about
is a little va-voom.

681
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:34,520
This is self-understood.

682
00:55:35,855 --> 00:55:38,691
I'm talking about social order.

683
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:41,694
Try to put yourself in my position.

684
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:46,032
I wish I could, Clarkie.
You're such a beautiful boy.

685
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,621
- Know why I'm so nuts about you?
- I don't, no.

686
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:54,499
Because you're not a sneak.

687
00:55:54,957 --> 00:55:59,379
You come down to my club.
You open your heart to me.

688
00:55:59,754 --> 00:56:01,881
You say what's on your mind.

689
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:05,551
That's how I know
you won't be a snake.

690
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,471
A snake in the grass.

691
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:12,433
That's how I know
you'll be loyal to me...

692
00:56:12,725 --> 00:56:14,227
...until death.

693
00:56:15,228 --> 00:56:16,896
Until death.

694
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:19,565
Like a real son.

695
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:21,943
Oh, I don't know.

696
00:56:23,111 --> 00:56:25,363
The son I never had.

697
00:56:47,635 --> 00:56:50,263
I got an engagement present for you.

698
00:56:50,596 --> 00:56:53,349
It's not much, but it's from my heart.

699
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:54,600
For me?

700
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:56,352
You're a lucky guy.

701
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:04,777
Take it for a little spin.

702
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:08,114
Go pick up Tina.
She's waiting at school.

703
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:12,452
I understand.

704
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,122
Sometimes in life...

705
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:20,293
...these emotions are beyond words.

706
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:21,711
Go ahead.

707
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:33,348
College of the Sacred Virgin in Queens.

708
00:57:34,474 --> 00:57:35,850
Let's move it.

709
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:41,522
He kissed me on the mouth.

710
00:57:43,191 --> 00:57:45,360
You know how big this is?

711
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:51,199
The kiss of all kisses.
The highest! You're in for life!

712
00:57:51,407 --> 00:57:53,326
It's like we're brothers.

713
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,036
God bless you.

714
00:57:57,455 --> 00:58:01,000
Anything wrong with it,
we'll get you another.

715
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:05,046
You have fun.

716
00:58:45,503 --> 00:58:46,671
Say when.

717
00:58:49,298 --> 00:58:50,717
When.

718
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:18,536
Screw this.

719
00:59:24,751 --> 00:59:26,377
Turn right. Right!

720
00:59:36,304 --> 00:59:37,388
He's parking?

721
00:59:37,638 --> 00:59:38,806
Hello?

722
01:00:14,717 --> 01:00:19,138
I want it to be very conventional,
old-fashioned...

723
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:20,848
Oh, hi, Clark!

724
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:22,350
We have to talk.

725
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:25,770
This is Father Frank
of the music department.

726
01:00:26,062 --> 01:00:30,483
We're discussing wedding music.
"Ave Maria" for the recessional...

727
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:32,235
Excuse us.

728
01:00:32,443 --> 01:00:35,113
Of course. Congratulations, my son.

729
01:00:35,405 --> 01:00:36,948
Thank you, Father.

730
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:40,243
- You're hurting me.
- I'm tense.

731
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:43,121
- I was involved in a car chase.
- And?

732
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:45,123
And? No "and."

733
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:48,710
This is part of your life,
but not mine.

734
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,339
People are flashing their lights at me.
I have to get away.

735
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:57,218
- It's just part of a working day.
- It is not!

736
01:00:57,427 --> 01:01:00,847
You weren't forced
to commit to my father.

737
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,975
It's beyond commitment.
It's like slavery.

738
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:06,477
People telling me who to marry!

739
01:01:07,437 --> 01:01:12,025
- You don't want to marry me?
- I don't want to marry anybody yet.

740
01:01:12,984 --> 01:01:14,652
So we'll wait.

741
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:18,281
We don't have to rush into anything.

742
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:20,825
I know that you'll wait for me.

743
01:01:21,075 --> 01:01:24,162
You're part of the family permanently.

744
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,663
"Permanently"?

745
01:01:25,872 --> 01:01:29,667
Your father kissed me.
Vic says I'm in for life.

746
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:32,170
- You are.
- I'm not!

747
01:01:33,421 --> 01:01:37,967
It's a fluke.
I got ripped off by this Vic.

748
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:40,303
And I caught up to him. What?

749
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:45,558
You think it was an accident
that you "caught up" to him?

750
01:01:46,684 --> 01:01:48,686
You were chosen, Clark.

751
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:51,773
You were hand-picked.

752
01:01:52,732 --> 01:01:56,819
- And it is the greatest honour.
- What are you saying?

753
01:01:57,195 --> 01:02:00,365
Vic has great instincts about people.

754
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:05,912
He saw you where? Grand Central?

755
01:02:07,163 --> 01:02:11,250
- It was a setup?
- "Setup" is so negative.

756
01:02:11,501 --> 01:02:14,337
There are so many levels to this.

757
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:16,714
I just want my life back.

758
01:02:16,923 --> 01:02:20,510
I can't talk to you
when you're so hysterical.

759
01:02:22,053 --> 01:02:25,723
What is the deal? What is it?
Am I some kind of dupe?

760
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:29,268
They looked in my yearbook
and found a chump?

761
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:32,563
Are you serious? A dupe?

762
01:02:33,189 --> 01:02:35,942
You think I'd marry a dupe?

763
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:41,823
Everybody's talking about the job
you're doing. It's all over town.

764
01:02:42,073 --> 01:02:47,495
Larry London called my father.
He said how bright you were.

765
01:02:48,413 --> 01:02:53,835
How gentle. How perceptive.
If you weren't all those things...

766
01:02:54,752 --> 01:02:58,923
...would Vic be out now
getting you a gun permit?

767
01:02:59,757 --> 01:03:01,759
I don't need a gun permit!

768
01:03:02,593 --> 01:03:05,638
You will if you'll be carrying a gun.

769
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:08,016
People are chasing you.

770
01:03:09,267 --> 01:03:12,312
That's quite a story. Charming.

771
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:15,982
I can't take it so lightly, sir.

772
01:03:16,232 --> 01:03:21,154
It has a real film-noir quality.
Smuggling lizards into New Jersey.

773
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:25,408
If it was done right,
black and white, grainy...

774
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:27,744
...sort of "Kiss Me Deadly."

775
01:03:27,952 --> 01:03:30,288
It's my life, not a film idea.

776
01:03:30,663 --> 01:03:35,376
They are the same when perceived
through the twin lenses...

777
01:03:36,502 --> 01:03:38,254
Clark Kellogg.

778
01:03:38,463 --> 01:03:42,717
I'm Chuck Greenwald.
This is Lloyd Simpson.

779
01:03:42,967 --> 01:03:45,553
We're from
the Department of Justice...

780
01:03:45,762 --> 01:03:49,766
...Fish and Wildlife Division.
We've been looking for you.

781
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:55,188
- This is what I'm talking about.
- I know nothing about it.

782
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:59,317
We were discussing a film project.
Oh, God, I'm late.

783
01:03:59,984 --> 01:04:01,653
Excuse me, please.

784
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:03,821
Mr. Kellogg.

785
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,415
This is actually a federal office?

786
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,251
We're undercover, Mr. Kellogg.

787
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,420
Special agents.

788
01:04:20,254 --> 01:04:24,008
- I think I better contact a lawyer.
- You may.

789
01:04:24,676 --> 01:04:26,469
You have a lawyer?

790
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:28,513
My stepfather.

791
01:04:31,974 --> 01:04:35,103
- What?
- Your stepfather turned you in.

792
01:04:35,353 --> 01:04:40,191
My stepfather?
How did he know anything about this?

793
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:47,365
You know a Carmine Sabatini,
also known as Jimmy the Toucan.

794
01:04:48,533 --> 01:04:52,245
"Toucan" I never heard.
My stepfather?

795
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:56,791
Do you know Hans Kurt Schlegel,
alias Larry London?

796
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,424
- We've met. I don't know him...
- These men are fiends, Mr. Kellogg.

797
01:05:04,632 --> 01:05:08,761
It's up to you to stop
their unspeakable activities.

798
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:10,888
What are you talking about?

799
01:05:11,681 --> 01:05:14,684
You ever heard mention
of the Gourmet Club?

800
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:16,144
No.

801
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:21,816
Sabatini and Schlegel established
the Gourmet Club operation in 1985.

802
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:26,070
It's a moveable feast.
Never the same location.

803
01:05:26,446 --> 01:05:30,908
Dinner's every three to six months,
depending on the catch.

804
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:32,410
No prices.

805
01:05:32,618 --> 01:05:37,248
The minimum price for eating
at this club is $200,000 per plate.

806
01:05:38,124 --> 01:05:41,586
- For dinner?
- Not just dinner, Mr. Kellogg.

807
01:05:41,919 --> 01:05:46,507
The entire menu consists
of endangered species.

808
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:50,428
- They cook these animals?
- They do, yes, sir.

809
01:05:50,636 --> 01:05:55,224
For an international clientele
of degenerates, scum, Euro-trash.

810
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:59,604
People pay $200,000
to eat these animals?

811
01:05:59,812 --> 01:06:00,938
Minimum.

812
01:06:01,147 --> 01:06:04,525
The more endangered,
the higher the price.

813
01:06:04,984 --> 01:06:09,947
If there are 5 or less in the world,
it goes up to half a million.

814
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,203
- To eat the very last of a species...
- A cool million.

815
01:06:15,453 --> 01:06:18,581
The dragon will be about
$350,000 a plate.

816
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:22,377
Served off the bone,
with a cream basil sauce.

817
01:06:22,627 --> 01:06:24,671
That's Schlegel's trademark.

818
01:06:24,921 --> 01:06:28,466
If they fillet it...
Schlegel likes to fillet...

819
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:31,969
...they can get 60 servings
out of one dragon.

820
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,722
That's a $20 million haul.

821
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:39,727
Mr. Sabatini wouldn't do that.

822
01:06:39,978 --> 01:06:42,814
Who do you think he is, Bishop Tutu?

823
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:46,818
- I don't believe he'd do that.
- I want Sabatini!

824
01:06:47,068 --> 01:06:52,448
- Before they serve that poor animal.
- Tell us where and when.

825
01:06:54,075 --> 01:06:56,327
You want me to be an informer.

826
01:06:56,536 --> 01:06:59,580
Or spend two years in Leavenworth.

827
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:04,085
- You'd lock me up for two years?
- I sure would.

828
01:07:04,293 --> 01:07:06,671
Unless you give us the old man.

829
01:07:12,844 --> 01:07:14,971
I'll think about it.

830
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:29,879
<i>There's freedom in being screwed.</i>

831
01:08:30,088 --> 01:08:33,174
<i>You know things can't get any worse.</i>

832
01:08:39,472 --> 01:08:42,350
Clark, you can't just split.

833
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,435
What would you do?

834
01:08:44,644 --> 01:08:47,355
I'd turn him in and hate myself.

835
01:08:47,563 --> 01:08:49,232
You'd do that?

836
01:08:49,983 --> 01:08:51,734
I don't know.

837
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:06,791
Is Clark Kellogg
in one of these rooms?

838
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:11,170
He's here. Come right in.
He's here.

839
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:20,930
Clark mentioned something,
but I had no idea the resemblance...

840
01:09:21,472 --> 01:09:26,269
- This is Steve Bushak, my roommate.
- My pleasure.

841
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:32,442
Could you leave us alone for a moment?
I want to talk to my son-in-law.

842
01:09:33,693 --> 01:09:35,695
I'd really like to stay.

843
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:38,406
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

844
01:09:38,614 --> 01:09:42,201
If you'd just leave us alone,
I'd appreciate it.

845
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:45,038
I'll get shoes and be on my way.

846
01:09:45,288 --> 01:09:48,875
Could you put those on outside?
I have some...

847
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:51,836
Outside? I always do that.

848
01:09:55,715 --> 01:09:59,093
Sit down.
I want to ask you something.

849
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:06,434
- You followed me.
- Followed you?

850
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:10,188
Yeah. A little bit, this evening.

851
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,654
Clark, I know when somebody's
following me.

852
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:23,117
I left the club and you were around
on the street, in a doorway.

853
01:10:24,285 --> 01:10:25,578
Someplace.

854
01:10:25,912 --> 01:10:29,082
Because I feel these things, you know?

855
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,918
Is this true?

856
01:10:34,295 --> 01:10:36,214
Yes.

857
01:10:37,548 --> 01:10:41,928
- I had a lot on my mind.
- You don't have to explain.

858
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:49,435
Looks like you're ready for bed.

859
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:54,315
- Soon.
- Want me to read you a bedtime story?

860
01:10:56,609 --> 01:11:00,279
Tina used to love
Curious George, the monkey.

861
01:11:01,114 --> 01:11:04,450
Every night I told her
a different story.

862
01:11:05,284 --> 01:11:09,372
Curious George goes here,
Curious George goes there.

863
01:11:10,289 --> 01:11:12,542
She knew them all by heart.

864
01:11:13,626 --> 01:11:16,629
My real father used to read me those.

865
01:11:17,296 --> 01:11:22,719
Who was the guy who used to take care
of Curious George, his keeper?

866
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:27,473
You mean the man in the yellow hat?

867
01:11:27,974 --> 01:11:30,893
The man with the yellow hat.

868
01:11:31,978 --> 01:11:35,189
Is this your real dad?

869
01:11:37,817 --> 01:11:40,111
That's me when I was 3.

870
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:46,659
I was 6 when he died.
Motorcycle accident.

871
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:50,455
What business was he in?

872
01:11:50,997 --> 01:11:55,251
He was a poet. He taught English
at the Putney School.

873
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:57,879
You know any of his poems?

874
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:00,173
A few of them.

875
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,593
- Tell me one.
- One of his poems?

876
01:12:05,845 --> 01:12:08,181
Just tell me a short one.

877
01:12:09,849 --> 01:12:13,728
One I like is called
"A Doorway on Boylston Street."

878
01:12:14,103 --> 01:12:15,897
In Boston.

879
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:22,570
It's been a while since I did it.

880
01:12:26,366 --> 01:12:29,535
<i>There's a certain doorway
On Boylston Street</i>

881
01:12:29,869 --> 01:12:32,580
<i>That I passed by on foot</i>

882
01:12:33,373 --> 01:12:37,669
<i>Suited and shod
One of many each Tuesday</i>

883
01:12:38,294 --> 01:12:41,130
<i>Toward lunch with a certain woman</i>

884
01:12:41,547 --> 01:12:43,549
<i>Regarded each Tuesday</i>

885
01:12:44,217 --> 01:12:46,719
<i>By the perfect turning gaze</i>

886
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,389
<i>Of a white Persian</i>

887
01:12:50,473 --> 01:12:53,351
<i>Regarding me, lovebound</i>

888
01:12:53,935 --> 01:12:55,645
<i>Sped by desire</i>

889
01:12:56,729 --> 01:12:59,691
<i>And returning
To the certainty of his fur</i>

890
01:13:01,776 --> 01:13:05,071
This was a cat on the doorway?

891
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:13,204
"The certainty of his fur."

892
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:17,208
- You liked it?
- I like it very much.

893
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:20,169
Very much.

894
01:13:20,586 --> 01:13:24,757
I like especially the fact
that you remember his poems.

895
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:30,555
Well, that's...

896
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:34,100
That's all I wanted to say.

897
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:40,189
And if there's anything
you have to tell me...

898
01:13:41,524 --> 01:13:44,319
...I know that you will.

899
01:13:46,154 --> 01:13:47,447
Yes.

900
01:13:49,032 --> 01:13:53,536
You told me before that you
wanted to quit your job.

901
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:56,831
If you want to, it's all right.

902
01:13:58,207 --> 01:13:59,709
I'll miss you.

903
01:14:04,088 --> 01:14:06,549
It's all right. Get a good sleep.

904
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:09,260
Good night.

905
01:14:13,973 --> 01:14:15,975
So this is college?

906
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:19,771
I didn't miss nothing.

907
01:14:47,173 --> 01:14:51,219
<i>A plane is waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.</i>

908
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:54,013
<i>Don't make a big thing about it.</i>

909
01:14:57,684 --> 01:14:59,852
<i>I know it was you, Fredo.</i>

910
01:15:00,311 --> 01:15:02,313
<i>You broke my heart.</i>

911
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:05,024
"You broke my heart."

912
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,707
"It was you, Fredo."

913
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:23,084
A moment of epiphany.

914
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:28,131
Michael Corleone kisses his brother.
An astonishing image...

915
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:32,385
...at once suggestive of love,
inversion, power...

916
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:36,097
...and in this world of duplicity
and corruption...

917
01:15:36,306 --> 01:15:39,684
...is there anything more important
than loyalty...

918
01:15:39,934 --> 01:15:42,103
- No.
...to friends...

919
01:15:42,395 --> 01:15:43,813
...to family?

920
01:15:44,897 --> 01:15:47,567
And who deserves our loyalty?

921
01:15:48,192 --> 01:15:49,444
Yeah?

922
01:15:49,652 --> 01:15:52,613
I need Clark Kellogg for a second.

923
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:56,159
You need Clark Kellogg for a second?

924
01:15:56,367 --> 01:15:59,412
Why, may I ask, is it so urgent?

925
01:15:59,954 --> 01:16:02,790
I'm Carmine Sabatini's daughter, Tina.

926
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,670
- Jimmy the Toucan?
- Nobody calls him that.

927
01:16:08,421 --> 01:16:10,173
Just one second.

928
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:13,885
Up, Mr. Kellogg!

929
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:19,057
- I'll be right back.
- No hurry. I'm quite impressed.

930
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:20,850
Jimmy the Toucan?

931
01:16:21,726 --> 01:16:24,771
He's quite a remarkable person.

932
01:16:25,355 --> 01:16:28,232
I'm sure he is. Can I meet him?

933
01:16:29,442 --> 01:16:30,943
That's a long shot.

934
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:33,237
Fine.

935
01:16:33,696 --> 01:16:36,532
My father thinks Clark
is an A student.

936
01:16:37,033 --> 01:16:41,162
- He's a fine young man.
- My father said an A student.

937
01:16:41,412 --> 01:16:43,706
- Absolutely! A, A+!
- Okay.

938
01:16:43,956 --> 01:16:47,627
Have a wonderful time.
Give my best to your dad.

939
01:16:48,836 --> 01:16:50,296
Jimmy the Toucan!

940
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,632
Are you out of your skull?

941
01:16:52,965 --> 01:16:55,635
- I was helping!
- I don't need help.

942
01:16:55,968 --> 01:16:57,637
Fine. So I won't.

943
01:16:59,806 --> 01:17:01,516
Where are we going?

944
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:42,974
Vic waved.

945
01:17:43,933 --> 01:17:45,435
That's nice.

946
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:57,488
Everybody skate, come on.

947
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,789
Sir, we have to talk.

948
01:18:07,623 --> 01:18:09,876
Pull them off. We gotta talk?

949
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:13,629
I have important things
to bring up with you.

950
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,467
- Do you have the clothes?
- In the locker room.

951
01:18:17,717 --> 01:18:20,303
Get the clothes and change.

952
01:18:20,678 --> 01:18:23,473
And then you'll drive us out.

953
01:18:24,057 --> 01:18:25,475
Drive where?

954
01:18:26,476 --> 01:18:30,855
We're going to go to the Gourmet Club.
This is Friday.

955
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:33,274
I have to talk to you first.

956
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:37,111
- We'll talk in the car.
- You promise?

957
01:18:37,362 --> 01:18:41,616
Every word I say, by definition,
is a promise.

958
01:18:41,866 --> 01:18:44,410
Come on.

959
01:18:48,122 --> 01:18:51,709
<i>Driving a Porsche
had always been appealing...</i>

960
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:53,795
<i>... until now.</i>

961
01:18:59,676 --> 01:19:02,804
<i>"- Do you read" Newsweek"?"
- Sometimes.</i>

962
01:19:03,012 --> 01:19:06,557
I'm very worried
about this ozone business.

963
01:19:07,684 --> 01:19:10,019
I'm really very concerned.

964
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:12,188
I have to talk to you.

965
01:19:12,855 --> 01:19:16,859
You wanted to talk to me last night,
but couldn't do it.

966
01:19:17,193 --> 01:19:19,696
I knew it would take you a day.

967
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:24,075
<i>The feds are after me.</i>

968
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:28,037
- You get their names?
- Greenwald and Simpson.

969
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:33,710
They said they'd put me in jail unless
I led them to the Gourmet Club.

970
01:19:34,043 --> 01:19:37,380
- They won't send you to jail.
- They won't?

971
01:19:38,089 --> 01:19:40,883
They're gonna blow your brains out.

972
01:19:42,218 --> 01:19:46,222
I want to say you have done
an outstanding job.

973
01:19:46,723 --> 01:19:49,892
Thank you. We appreciate it.

974
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:53,062
They work for the Bonelli family...

975
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:56,774
...out of South Amboy.
- Not for the government?

976
01:19:56,983 --> 01:20:01,904
They do, but they're on the take
for the Bonellis.

977
01:20:02,155 --> 01:20:06,784
- Staggering, isn't it? The corruption.
- Yeah, the corruption is...

978
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:11,581
- He's driving around with mobsters.
- College kid. It's upsetting.

979
01:20:13,124 --> 01:20:16,419
These guys are after you
for the Bonellis...

980
01:20:16,836 --> 01:20:19,088
...and they just used me.

981
01:20:19,756 --> 01:20:23,092
- And once they get you...
- Then they hit you.

982
01:20:23,593 --> 01:20:25,595
My God! This is terrible.

983
01:20:25,928 --> 01:20:30,600
That's the way it's done.
I'm sorry I got you into this...

984
01:20:31,434 --> 01:20:34,729
...but you're in it and we'll
get you out of it.

985
01:20:34,937 --> 01:20:36,105
My God!

986
01:20:36,314 --> 01:20:38,149
<i>He had a way out.</i>

987
01:20:38,441 --> 01:20:41,402
<i>A plan to entrap Greenwald
and Simpson...</i>

988
01:20:41,653 --> 01:20:45,406
<i>... and get him out
of the endangered-species racket.</i>

989
01:20:46,115 --> 01:20:50,119
<i>Hint. It involved using me
and the lizard as bait.</i>

990
01:20:50,453 --> 01:20:54,832
<i>This would be the final dinner
of the fabulous Gourmet Club.</i>

991
01:21:11,307 --> 01:21:12,850
<i>Tequila!</i>

992
01:21:45,008 --> 01:21:46,467
Ladies and gentlemen...

993
01:21:46,718 --> 01:21:51,472
...your cohost for this evening,
Mr. Carmine Sabatini.

994
01:21:53,474 --> 01:21:58,271
With him are his daughter,
Tina, and her fiancé Clark Kellogg...

995
01:21:58,521 --> 01:22:01,065
...from the great state of Montana.

996
01:22:01,274 --> 01:22:06,112
Let's have a Gourmet Club welcome
for Carmine and the happy couple.

997
01:22:22,545 --> 01:22:23,379
<i>Tequila!</i>

998
01:22:36,643 --> 01:22:41,356
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all waited for.

999
01:22:41,814 --> 01:22:46,569
The moment that makes the Gourmet
Club the special place it is.

1000
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:50,615
Our main course,
served for the very last time...

1001
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:53,326
...on this, our planet Earth...

1002
01:22:53,785 --> 01:22:56,245
...your Komodo dragon.

1003
01:23:01,584 --> 01:23:03,586
<i>There he is</i>

1004
01:23:04,671 --> 01:23:07,006
<i>Your Komodo dragon</i>

1005
01:23:09,008 --> 01:23:11,135
<i>Yes, there he is</i>

1006
01:23:12,178 --> 01:23:14,347
<i>One of eight</i>

1007
01:23:15,473 --> 01:23:18,142
<i>With so many species</i>

1008
01:23:18,351 --> 01:23:20,603
<i>He took the town by storm with his</i>

1009
01:23:20,812 --> 01:23:24,357
<i>Continental taste and charm</i>

1010
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,860
Go into this cornfield. It's deserted.

1011
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:43,584
Good.

1012
01:23:43,793 --> 01:23:46,045
A Rob Roy with a twist.
You?

1013
01:23:46,295 --> 01:23:47,630
Diet Coke.

1014
01:23:49,215 --> 01:23:52,510
- Did my uncle bring you up-to-date?
- Yeah.

1015
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,722
We'll be killed
by Greenwald and Simpson.

1016
01:23:56,055 --> 01:23:59,225
They're with the Bonellis
out of South Amboy.

1017
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:03,062
That's stretching.
There's a chance we'll be killed.

1018
01:24:03,396 --> 01:24:04,939
It's not a lot.

1019
01:24:05,565 --> 01:24:08,568
We need to get you
adequately prepared.

1020
01:24:15,033 --> 01:24:17,118
- An Italian passport.
- Open it.

1021
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:25,460
Is that a piece of work?

1022
01:24:26,544 --> 01:24:28,087
What is this?

1023
01:24:28,338 --> 01:24:29,714
"Rodolfo Lasparri?"

1024
01:24:30,506 --> 01:24:32,175
I got to tell you.

1025
01:24:32,425 --> 01:24:36,095
We may be on a plane to
Palermo, Sicily tonight...

1026
01:24:36,346 --> 01:24:38,056
...if we're still walking.

1027
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:41,476
- I don't want to go to Palermo.
- Ever been?

1028
01:24:41,726 --> 01:24:46,022
- No.
- Then you can't judge, Rodolfo.

1029
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:47,732
I'm not going!

1030
01:24:48,024 --> 01:24:52,695
I can't take it! I don't want to
spend the rest of my life hiding.

1031
01:24:52,945 --> 01:24:56,324
- I want this resolved!
- You do?

1032
01:24:56,532 --> 01:24:58,117
Yes!

1033
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:03,998
- Why are you smiling?
- As usual, Uncle Carmine was right.

1034
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:08,419
You're ready. Ready for Freddy.

1035
01:25:09,545 --> 01:25:11,756
"Ready for Freddy"?

1036
01:25:14,133 --> 01:25:18,888
It's showtime. In two minutes,
you go outside and signal the feds.

1037
01:25:21,891 --> 01:25:23,768
What the hell is that?

1038
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:28,272
Fish and Wildlife doesn't mean
we're social workers.

1039
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:35,822
Ladies and gentlemen, your cohost
for this evening, Mr. Larry London!

1040
01:25:39,283 --> 01:25:41,995
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1041
01:25:48,459 --> 01:25:51,879
This is a very special evening
for all of us.

1042
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:57,468
For tonight you will eat one
of only eight Komodo dragons...

1043
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,555
...left in the entire world.

1044
01:26:04,642 --> 01:26:08,479
Which is why it has been priced at...

1045
01:26:08,813 --> 01:26:12,191
...$350,000 a plate.
Service included!

1046
01:26:14,652 --> 01:26:17,363
Thank you for paying in advance.

1047
01:26:17,613 --> 01:26:19,657
Without these monies...

1048
01:26:23,328 --> 01:26:26,998
Smells good.
I want you to take half of it...

1049
01:26:27,332 --> 01:26:30,335
...and put the rest in the steamer.

1050
01:26:32,045 --> 01:26:33,171
Go ahead.

1051
01:26:44,015 --> 01:26:47,352
He wants you to help him
with the dragon.

1052
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:54,359
Good luck, not that you need it.
Everybody's confident.

1053
01:27:42,115 --> 01:27:44,075
The kid is signalling us.

1054
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:45,910
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

1055
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:52,125
<i>I crossed the dance floor,
heart pounding.</i>

1056
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:55,461
<i>In a few minutes
I would be free, dead...</i>

1057
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:59,298
<i>... or Rodolfo Lasparri
of Palermo, Sicily.</i>

1058
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:04,679
<i>It was all up to me.
The show was about to begin.</i>

1059
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:39,047
<i>The lizard was more nervous than me.
We were in the same boat.</i>

1060
01:28:51,684 --> 01:28:54,437
Everybody out. Get out.

1061
01:29:25,009 --> 01:29:29,472
- Give me that dragon!
- Freeze! Department of Justice!

1062
01:29:29,722 --> 01:29:31,849
Sabatini, Schlegel...

1063
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,643
...you're under arrest.

1064
01:29:33,851 --> 01:29:38,773
- What's the charge?
- Import and attempted slaughter...

1065
01:29:39,023 --> 01:29:43,528
...of "Varanus komodoensis,"
also known as the Komodo dragon.

1066
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,990
- It's over, old man.
- You betrayed me.

1067
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,574
You betrayed me.

1068
01:29:49,325 --> 01:29:50,785
Stand back!

1069
01:29:51,077 --> 01:29:52,745
Drop it or I'll shoot.

1070
01:29:55,707 --> 01:29:58,042
- How could you do this?
- Sir...

1071
01:29:58,251 --> 01:30:00,003
How could you betray me?

1072
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,812
Oh, my God, Carmine.

1073
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:30,074
I had no choice.

1074
01:30:30,366 --> 01:30:33,161
- You all saw that.
- You had no choice.

1075
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:34,412
It was fate.

1076
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:38,499
No matter how you feel, you're a hero.

1077
01:30:42,879 --> 01:30:43,963
I'm numb.

1078
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:45,298
Cigarette?

1079
01:30:48,635 --> 01:30:49,969
I'd love one.

1080
01:30:51,137 --> 01:30:54,223
- I had feelings for him.
- I'm sure you did.

1081
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:56,643
A technical matter.

1082
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:01,105
The money. We need it for evidence.

1083
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:05,985
It's there in the large tureen.

1084
01:31:15,787 --> 01:31:17,205
Good work, kid.

1085
01:31:18,623 --> 01:31:20,792
We gotta impound the evidence.

1086
01:31:22,418 --> 01:31:25,338
Job well done.
Everybody wait here.

1087
01:31:26,255 --> 01:31:28,424
- Congratulations.
- Come on.

1088
01:31:35,598 --> 01:31:39,060
- I guess we should go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1089
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,354
- Son...
- Don't call me son.

1090
01:31:41,604 --> 01:31:45,024
- I had no choice.
- You didn't have to turn me in.

1091
01:31:45,316 --> 01:31:50,488
- Lf it was your son...
- I'd have treated him like a son.

1092
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:53,908
I'd treat my stepson
like he was my son.

1093
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:58,621
- Clark, that animal...
- Dwight, good night!

1094
01:31:58,955 --> 01:32:01,582
Tell Mom I'll call her tomorrow.

1095
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:08,965
Good night.

1096
01:32:12,552 --> 01:32:13,886
FBI, gentlemen.

1097
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:19,058
Greenwald, Simpson,
you're under arrest for violating...

1098
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:24,522
...your oath of office, conspiracy,
fraud, extortion, RICO Act violation.

1099
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:26,607
Put the cuffs on them.

1100
01:32:27,525 --> 01:32:29,527
The old man set us up.

1101
01:32:30,153 --> 01:32:31,446
Sabatini?

1102
01:32:32,405 --> 01:32:35,783
- With the kid!
- Watch the corn, gentlemen.

1103
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:50,673
I'm getting too old for this nonsense.

1104
01:32:51,257 --> 01:32:52,425
We done?

1105
01:32:54,552 --> 01:32:56,429
We're done.

1106
01:32:58,348 --> 01:33:01,059
- How are you doing?
- I'm a wreck.

1107
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:04,812
Sorry to interrupt,
but they're restless.

1108
01:33:05,355 --> 01:33:09,817
All right, Hans,
what are we serving for dinner?

1109
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,153
Hawaiian tiger fish...

1110
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:15,907
...mixed with smoked turkey
from Virginia.

1111
01:33:16,115 --> 01:33:17,575
Smoked turkey?

1112
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:19,619
It's all a scam?

1113
01:33:19,869 --> 01:33:23,581
- The Gourmet thing?
- This is an ugly word, "scam."

1114
01:33:23,915 --> 01:33:25,750
This is business.

1115
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,503
In business, this is what you do.

1116
01:33:44,102 --> 01:33:47,271
<i>$350, 000 for smoked turkey.</i>

1117
01:33:47,522 --> 01:33:51,359
<i>But the Gourmet Club
had a great last night.</i>

1118
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:56,030
<i>Dwight went back to Vermont.
Greenwald and Simpson went to jail.</i>

1119
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:02,286
<i>"The animals went to the Bronx" Z"oo's"
Sabatini Endangered Species Wing.</i>

1120
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:07,208
<i>Carmine was a philanthropist now.
And me? I was just a student.</i>

1121
01:34:23,683 --> 01:34:27,145
- You wouldn't have done it.
- Of course not.

1122
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:29,731
That's why we never told you.

1123
01:34:30,857 --> 01:34:33,735
He knew that Dwight
was my stepfather...

1124
01:34:33,985 --> 01:34:37,905
...and he'd call Fish and Wildlife?
- Of course.

1125
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:42,452
- He's like a genius.
- He's like a genius.

1126
01:34:53,129 --> 01:34:54,797
Good night, "Liebchen."

1127
01:34:56,341 --> 01:35:01,012
You've always been my great love.
I can say it since I'm leaving.

1128
01:35:02,472 --> 01:35:05,099
Fantastic job, young man.
Great!

1129
01:35:12,482 --> 01:35:15,652
We're going to some clubs.
Nice work.

1130
01:35:15,902 --> 01:35:17,236
Take it easy.

1131
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:25,953
The show's over.

1132
01:35:26,245 --> 01:35:28,247
So marriage is...

1133
01:35:28,623 --> 01:35:29,957
Please.

1134
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:33,878
- Good. Not that l...
- I know.

1135
01:35:34,712 --> 01:35:38,049
- Tell you what I'd really like.
- What's that?

1136
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:42,220
I want to spend the night
in your dorm room.

1137
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:45,473
- Really?
- Yes, very much.

1138
01:35:46,057 --> 01:35:50,812
I would love that. Get to know
each other under calm circumstances.

1139
01:36:22,427 --> 01:36:24,178
I'll go help Vic.

1140
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:32,812
It's all over now.
You can go back to Vermont.

1141
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:34,480
You remember?

1142
01:36:35,315 --> 01:36:36,774
I always knew.

1143
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:42,030
I'm sorry you had to
go through this nonsense, but...

1144
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,991
...it turned out good.
- Sure.

1145
01:36:45,241 --> 01:36:48,119
It was just...
It just was.

1146
01:36:49,662 --> 01:36:53,624
I'll tell you something.
You were brave.

1147
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:57,420
- I was proud of you.
- Thank you.

1148
01:36:59,005 --> 01:37:03,384
Anyway, I hope you have a good life.

1149
01:37:14,062 --> 01:37:15,396
You know...

1150
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:20,652
...I meant everything I told you.

1151
01:37:58,106 --> 01:38:02,568
What's the matter with you?
You turned out to be a bum.

1152
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:04,445
Come on, come on.

1153
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:10,326
If it weren't for me,
you could have been a handbag.

1154
01:38:11,202 --> 01:38:15,456
- He don't want to walk.
- They don't really walk.

1155
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:20,586
I'll get him. I can pick him up.

1156
01:38:21,963 --> 01:38:24,048
- Let me help you.
- I got him.

1157
01:38:30,388 --> 01:38:32,432
I want to tell you something.

1158
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:36,144
When you finish film school,
I'd like to call you.

1159
01:38:36,394 --> 01:38:41,649
I know a lot of people in Hollywood.
I could open some doors for you.

1160
01:38:41,983 --> 01:38:44,652
Give you some opportunities.

1161
01:38:45,194 --> 01:38:49,949
- No, I don't think that's necessary.
- Really, it's easy for me.

1162
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:54,704
I just make a phone call
and make it easy for you.
