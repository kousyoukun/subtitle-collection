1
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,314
- Is that where she keeps it?
- Mm-hm.

2
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,800
Come on! Come on!

3
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,796
Yam

4
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,474
I'll have my revenge...

5
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,061
And deathstalker, too!

6
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,022
Let me go! Let me go!

7
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,734
Quiet, or you'll eat
steel for dinner.

8
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,202
Looks like you've eaten
everything else.

9
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,112
Shut up, you little wench.

10
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,906
This town's got no room
for beggars!

11
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,578
Lam not a beggar.
I'm a seer.

12
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,042
Even the king knows that.

13
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,669
All too well, girl.

14
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,245
You're lucky to get away
with your life.

15
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,750
Look, his highness
asked for a prophecy,

16
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,053
and that's what he got.

17
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,212
In my kingdom,
a man would delight

18
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,974
to learn his wife
would soon be with child.

19
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,183
But not by another man,
eh, Marco?

20
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,717
I call 'em as I see 'em,
good or bad.

21
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,348
Even I can predict what's gonna
happen to you.

22
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,558
Give me a break!

23
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,058
How's an oracle supposed
to make a living?

24
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,268
The king wants you
off the castle grounds. Now!

25
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,402
You can't treat me like this!

26
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,320
- L'm a Princess!
- Right. Right.

27
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,398
- And I'm Merlin the magician!
- Yeah!

28
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,913
Now, be off with you,
"Princess of beggars".

29
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,703
You'll be sorry!

30
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,239
You're the one
that's gonna be sorry.

31
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,576
Let's get her!

32
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,169
Here.

33
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,290
- You know, boys.
- Who the hell are you?

34
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,666
Ordinarily, I don't mind seeing
a woman get a good beating,

35
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,881
if she deserves it.

36
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,672
Yeah?

37
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,971
But this doesn't look
like much of a contest to me.

38
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,104
You picked the wrong town
to stop in, stranger.

39
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,556
He's gonna stop here
permanently.

40
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,637
You know who we are?

41
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,688
The village idiot
and the two runners-up?

42
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,816
Get him!

43
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,446
Yeah!

44
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,955
Hey, take it easy!
I don't even know these guys.

45
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,505
Hi.

46
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,517
Hello.

47
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:58,979
Whoo!

48
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,706
Whoa.

49
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,341
Whoa.

50
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,007
Oh, gets 'em every time.

51
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,951
Now, I got a nice,
big room upstairs.

52
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,960
What do you say, the three of us
go up there and...

53
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,712
- I need to talk to you.
- Line forms to the right.

54
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,213
You gotta help me!

55
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,625
One rescue a day,
that's my policy.

56
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,674
It's a matter of life and death.

57
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,221
Do the words, "walk east till your
hat floats" mean anything to ya?

58
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,390
Hey, you, Princess, I thought
we told you to get out of town.

59
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,900
Come here.

60
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:24,817
Get him!

61
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,293
What's the matter
with you?

62
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,566
[ Gasps 1

63
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,224
what are you doing?

64
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,524
Look out!

65
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,597
Behind you!

66
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,999
Come on! Come on, the back door!
Let's go!

67
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,974
Let's get out of here!

68
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,096
After them!

69
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,312
Seal off the fence!

70
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,363
Yah! Yah!

71
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,284
Yam

72
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,061
- l'm Evie.
- Deathstalker.

73
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,024
- Deathstalker?
- Uh-huh.

74
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,729
Is that your first name
or your last name?

75
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,735
They're gaining!

76
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,483
You're good.

77
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,283
- Helps in my line of work.
- What line of work is that?

78
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,164
Oh, I like to call it the wealth
redistribution business.

79
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,117
Oh, so you rob from the rich
and give to the poor?

80
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,787
No, I rob from the rich
and pretty much keep it.

81
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,870
Do you think we lost 'em?

82
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,207
You gotta get up pretty early
in the morning

83
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,584
to catch the prince of thieves.

84
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,673
It is pretty early
in the morning!

85
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,761
Yah! Yah!

86
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,375
Yam

87
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,840
hey-yah!

88
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,723
'Hey-yahg

89
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,819
- hold it! Which way they go?
- I don't know.

90
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:32,855
You go north.

91
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,649
I'll head south.

92
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,991
I'll double back.
We'll meet here.

93
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,896
- But find him!
- Yah!

94
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,408
Yep.

95
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,155
I think we finally lost them.

96
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,840
- Starvin' here.
- Just a second.

97
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,462
Haven't had a thing to eat

98
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,172
since last night at aboud's.

99
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,930
Here, try it.
It's my specialty.

100
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,219
Oh, your specialty, huh?

101
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,472
Like it?

102
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,728
Mmm.

103
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,517
Good. Very good.

104
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,480
Um...

105
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,230
Can I have some water, too,
please?

106
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,700
Thank you. That was great.
Great.

107
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,824
Boy, you must have
really been hungry!

108
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,624
Mm-hm.

109
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,905
- More?
- Oh, no!

110
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,083
Couldn't eat another bite.
Couldn't eat another bite.

111
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,915
I know I kinda messed things up
for you before...

112
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,053
Excuse me.
Just... struck me funny.

113
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,421
But I'm willing
to make it up to you.

114
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,718
I'm listening.

115
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,506
I can tell your future.

116
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,971
No, really!

117
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,891
I'm a seer. It's a gift I've had
since childhood.

118
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,978
Okay, things can't get
much worse, I guess.

119
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,732
Shoot

120
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,522
spirits of tomorrow...

121
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,606
Hear my call!

122
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,779
Wanna keep that to a minimum?

123
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,699
I see you embarking
on a heroic quest.

124
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,577
It shall become legend!

125
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,290
And storytellers shall recount
your many exploits

126
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,584
down through the ages.

127
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,751
Well, I sure hope
they get my name right.

128
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,875
An image is coming to me.

129
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,554
Yes. I see it so clear!

130
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,547
A young woman. No!
A Princess.

131
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,045
A Princess?

132
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,722
<i>- She rich?
- She's calling to you.</i>

133
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,762
Help me!

134
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,555
Help me, deathstalker!

135
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,348
Only you can save me!

136
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,808
She's in trouble?

137
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,438
Oh, big trouble.

138
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,694
<i>A matter of life or death.</i>

139
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,980
Why?

140
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,072
- What?
- I see someone else.

141
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,856
Dark and evil.

142
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,488
This is bad.

143
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,033
This is real bad.

144
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,041
The Princess is being imprisoned
by jarek,

145
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,406
an evil sorcerer.

146
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,833
Are there any other kind?

147
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,173
He's also a great swordsman.

148
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,455
Even greater than deathstalker.

149
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,751
- Better than me?
- Wait!

150
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,800
He's laughing at you.

151
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,762
Come and get me, deathstalker,

152
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,392
if you dare.

153
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,008
The sorcerer...
Where do I find him?

154
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,641
In the land of jzafir.

155
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,182
Where the hell is that?

156
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,732
Oh, it's a long
and perilous journey.

157
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,649
Ah, figures.

158
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,856
Many dangers, witches,
dragons, ogres.

159
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,608
Must cut down
on the tourist trade!

160
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,820
You shall confront them all,
emerge victorious,

161
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,032
and reap a fabulous reward.

162
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,582
The all-seeing eye never lies.

163
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,869
And this is gonna get me
into the legends?

164
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,832
Right up there with conan!

165
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,830
Whoa!

166
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,210
Uh...

167
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,506
Sorry. You all right?

168
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:43,884
Yes.

169
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,053
Well, what about the reward?

170
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,885
When I know more,
you'll know more.

171
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,678
Well, that settles it, then.
I'm out of here.

172
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,560
Where you goin'?

173
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,392
Let's go.

174
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,938
I'm not getting any younger,
you know!

175
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:55,726
Go?

176
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,646
To jzafir? Now?

177
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,016
You got it, sis.

178
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,228
Wait a minute!
Well, wait a minute!

179
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,323
There's still more soup!

180
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,464
Next.

181
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,965
- Have you found the Princess yet?
-L'm working on it.

182
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,800
She won't get far.

183
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,639
You should have never
let her escape.

184
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,190
She might come back
and take the throne.

185
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,311
A waif pretending
to be a Princess?

186
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,022
Who would believe it?

187
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,316
Why don't you just... kill her?

188
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,743
Evie, darling,

189
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,777
we've gone over this
a dozen times before.

190
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,408
I created you from the original
soul of the Princess.

191
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,713
An exact duplicate
in all respects.

192
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,827
Unfortunately, I haven't had time
to work out the bugs.

193
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,303
In other words,
if she dies...

194
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,840
You die.

195
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,967
Once I've made a few minor
adjustments in the formula,

196
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,311
I can duplicate anyone.

197
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,813
Then eliminate the original.

198
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,849
Now, my dear, please run along.

199
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,729
These brief practice sessions
are the...

200
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,517
Only leisure I allow myself.

201
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,816
And I enjoy them so much more...
Alone.

202
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,277
I'll be in my chamber...

203
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,449
Waiting.

204
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,280
As you wish, my dear.
As you wish.

205
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,199
Next!

206
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,078
Sultana.

207
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,915
You know how I hate
standing in line.

208
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,764
You look marvelous.

209
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,585
Lovely as a rose.

210
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,840
We can dispense with pleasantries,
if you don't mind.

211
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,223
After what you've done to me,

212
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,260
I'd hardly call this visit
a pleasure.

213
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,893
Whatever do you mean, my dear?

214
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,430
You never would have been
able to put

215
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,353
that little blonde bitch of yours
up on the throne without my help.

216
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,770
Let alone, get rid of the real one.

217
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,364
You were paid handsomely.

218
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,147
I did not come here to bicker
with you, jarek, my dear.

219
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,071
I have a proposition for you.

220
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,950
You wish to have the Princess Evie
returned to you.

221
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,616
I wish to settle a score
with a certain varlet

222
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,117
who is escorting her back here.

223
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,157
I have a man shadowing them now.

224
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,459
Doubtless, you'll remember chin,
the buccaneer?

225
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,371
Chin, the one-eye?

226
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,785
The man's a second-rate amateur.

227
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,344
In any event, you will assist him.

228
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,706
Evie is mine.

229
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,125
- And the meddler?
- Deathstalker.

230
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,338
Deathstalker?

231
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,723
Oh, very well, he's yours.
Enjoy.

232
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,100
Done.

233
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,813
- Always a pleasure, sultana.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

234
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:42,944
Next!

235
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,932
Which way, o mighty oracle?

236
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,427
Why do they call you
the prince of thieves?

237
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,263
Because I'm the best.

238
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,814
<i>- But you're not a real prince?</i>

239
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,101
Which way?

240
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,977
The west road.

241
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,309
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

242
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,233
The crystal ball
never lets me down.

243
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,975
The west road.

244
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,437
You're sure about that?

245
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,937
The west road.

246
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,527
If you had the chance
to marry a real Princess,

247
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,742
would you do it?

248
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,780
No, I wouldn't.

249
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:39,913
Why not?

250
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,500
Because being a Princess brings out
the worst in a woman.

251
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,333
Always whinin' and poutin',
and actin'

252
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,502
like a spoiled little brat, if they
don't get their own way all...

253
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,183
Give it to me, chin.
What do you got?

254
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,765
Deathstalker's as good
as in the grave.

255
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,364
Look, sailor, don't carve
a tombstone so readily.

256
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,533
He has as many lives,
as a cat.

257
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,153
And, remember,
the last one belongs to me.

258
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,906
If he's made of flesh and blood,
he can die.

259
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,119
Never underestimate
the strength of an enemy.

260
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,910
Especially an accomplished fighter
like stalker.

261
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,541
You telling me how to do
my job, sultana?

262
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,541
Just giving you
some friendly advice.

263
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,003
Well, keep it to yourself.

264
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,963
I'll bring stalker to you
on a platter.

265
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,092
Like a piece of raw meat.

266
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,343
Oh, yeah?

267
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,139
Yeah! I've got just the butchers
to do it!

268
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,354
Say hello to crazy Otto reingold,
the mad prussian,

269
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,096
solely responsible
for the lemurian massacres

270
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,232
that killed hundreds
and left thousands homeless.

271
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,481
I'm sure you recognize
ed "the head" schamanski.

272
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,532
Five years on the genghis Khan
strike force,

273
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,436
part-time consultant
to Attila the hun.

274
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,946
Next.

275
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,156
John "the baptist" bombaso.
Drowning's his specialty.

276
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,277
Beside him...

277
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,123
Nick "the crippler" of kashmir.

278
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,865
I think his name says it all.

279
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,081
And last, but not least,
the real find,

280
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,922
buddy "footstool" laroza,

281
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,417
only recently dismissed
by Ivan the terrible...

282
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,340
<i>--...for excessive brutality.</i>

283
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,089
Still skeptical?

284
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,471
You bet I am.

285
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,684
Suit yourself.

286
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,519
Come on, boys.

287
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,975
Okay, men.
Let him have it!

288
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,039
Close, men, but don't kill...
Not yet.

289
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,758
I think we better find
another way.

290
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,048
Oh, really? You think so?

291
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,178
West road, right!

292
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,138
I oughta...

293
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,352
- Who are they?
- You tell me. You're the seer.

294
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,270
Well, they're trying to kill us.

295
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,019
Somebody give the lady a cigar.

296
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,519
Look, if they were trying
to kill us,

297
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,364
they could have done it
way back down the road.

298
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,319
No, they're--
they're after something.

299
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,203
You sure you're telling me
everything?

300
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,406
I told you it was gonna be a long
and perilous journey, didn't I?

301
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,867
Yeah, yeah, witches, ogres,
all that bad stuff.

302
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,210
You and your visions!

303
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,422
Knew these would come in handy.

304
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,843
Where you goin'?

305
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,465
- Just stay put.
- I wanna help.

306
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,220
You've done plenty already.

307
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,358
That'll be fine, boys.
Save your arrows.

308
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,027
Whew.

309
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,108
Stalker? Stalker!

310
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,175
There... huh?

311
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:36,813
Throw your sword down...

312
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,272
Or I'll cut her pretty,
little throat.

313
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,146
Go ahead. Cut it.

314
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,858
You rat!

315
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,662
You were gonna let him kill me!

316
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,488
Now, would I do a thing
like that?

317
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,664
Come on, let's go find that horse
and get the hell out of here.

318
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:57,912
Oh!

319
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,583
And, uh, would you mind
taking that knife

320
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,621
out of that guy for me?

321
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,794
It's the only one I got left.

322
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,674
Ew!

323
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,881
- Wait a minute!
- What do you want now?

324
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,723
Were you really gonna
let him kill me?

325
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,604
Deathstalker, you weren't really
gonna let him kill me, were you?

326
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,426
Huh? No, you wouldn't do that?
Deathstalker!

327
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,360
Ah, you're back!
Minus the fearless five.

328
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,781
You should have
listened to me.

329
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,281
You wanna bitch?
Bitch to jarek.

330
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,660
I'm calling him right now.

331
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,797
- What news have you?
- Bad news, lord jarek.

332
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,047
I hate bad news.
It spoils my day.

333
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,052
I got an idea.

334
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:55,795
Come closer.

335
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,184
I'll kill that son of a bitch
if it kills me.

336
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,061
You may rest assured
that it will.

337
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,499
So long, sailor.

338
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,678
Well, look what we have here.

339
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,017
Spooky, huh?

340
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,852
Yeah.

341
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,441
Stalker...

342
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,450
I still don't understand
why you want to break in there.

343
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,816
Because
we're broke, that's why.

344
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,696
What's that got to do with anything?

345
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,078
That's a family mausoleum.

346
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,120
There are probably...

347
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,961
More jewels in there,
than we can carry out.

348
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,500
You're about to become
a very rich woman.

349
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,010
I was just starting
to enjoy poverty.

350
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,919
Come on, where's your sense
of adventure?

351
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,513
This isn't adventure.
It's just damn scary!

352
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,681
Yeah, but, uh...
When legends told...

353
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
I want people to think
we faced this bravely.

354
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,599
When the legend's told,

355
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,652
nobody's gonna believe
we were this stupid!

356
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,440
- Stalker.
- Huh?

357
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,395
I heard somewhere it was bad luck
to walk over graves.

358
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,653
I heard it was only
the open ones.

359
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,027
- Wait a minute!
- What?

360
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,695
I just remembered.
My hat...

361
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,834
I left the door unlocked.
We gotta go back!

362
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,420
- You don't have a door?
- I don't?

363
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,166
No.

364
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,578
Oh, yeah.

365
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,169
What was that?

366
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,300
The wind.

367
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,932
It should get oiled.
It came from in there.

368
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,756
You bet it did.

369
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,308
Stalker, you're not really
going in there?

370
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,688
- Don't go in there. It's dark.
- Look, relax, will ya?

371
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,655
Whew!

372
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,624
Well, come on in.
What are you waiting for?

373
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,915
Ah, come on, it's a little smelly,
but what could happen?

374
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,878
Stalker!

375
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,524
Stalker.

376
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,666
You know...

377
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,928
Grave robbing is not only
morally repulsive,

378
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,761
but I believe it carries a rather
stiff penalty, in these parts.

379
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,016
Who the hell are you?

380
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,385
Forgive me for not introducing
myself properly.

381
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,269
But I assumed a person with even
your limited deductive powers,

382
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,187
could have guessed.

383
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,191
Jarek.

384
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:46,951
Stalker.

385
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:02,835
Stalker!

386
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,759
Get out here!
Stalker, get out here!

387
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,603
I'd offer you my hand, sir.

388
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,181
But it's both tiring
and inconvenient

389
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,015
to be at two places at once...

390
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,193
Even for a sorcerer.

391
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,359
So if you'll be so good
as to excuse me,

392
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,358
I have a rather pressing
engagement to attend to.

393
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,033
And, oh, by the way...

394
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,946
I've arranged one for you
as well.

395
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,579
<i>Stalker!</i>

396
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,415
Ah! Son of a bitch.

397
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,380
Ah! The old crushing wall
routine, huh?

398
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,760
You couldn't do better than this?

399
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,394
Me and my big mouth...

400
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,057
Stalker! Stalker!

401
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,478
Stalker!

402
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,200
Stalker!

403
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,659
Stalker!

404
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,292
Gotta be a secret lever
around here someplace.

405
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,616
Uh-huh!

406
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,207
Yipe!

407
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,633
Stalker!

408
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,672
Stalker!

409
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,242
Stalker!

410
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,086
Stalker!

411
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,131
Stalker! Get out here!

412
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:09,966
Stalker!

413
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,929
Gosh, leave you alone
for five minutes,

414
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,984
look what happens.

415
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,191
Come on!

416
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,732
Come on!

417
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,151
I'm comin'! I'm comin'!

418
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,326
Yah! Yah!

419
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,329
Come on! Yah!

420
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,850
Don't you know another tune?

421
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,725
Get out of here!

422
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,610
It's happening again!

423
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,871
Guards! Guards!

424
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,752
"- No! No!

425
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,331
No!

426
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,375
Dinner is served, your majesty.

427
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,892
- Did you see the face on her?
- Too bad. Nice body, though!

428
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,809
Come.

429
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,863
I won't bite.

430
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,032
You know, something funny
is going on here.

431
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,606
First, we get attacked
by bandits.

432
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,565
Then those damned zombies.
What's next?

433
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,825
Don't answer that!

434
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,039
Every time,
it's like they're waiting for us.

435
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,539
This jarek guy
is playing for keeps.

436
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,093
I told you the path would be
filled with perils.

437
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,205
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,627
We can forget the legend,
if you want to.

439
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,090
There's still time to turn back.

440
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,090
Reward's still up for grabs,
isn't it?

441
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,429
Uh-huh.

442
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,217
Who said anything
about turning back?

443
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,177
Not me.

444
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,231
Here...

445
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,524
Looks like you could use this.

446
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,109
What are you gonna use?

447
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,185
The fire won't last
but a few more minutes.

448
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,654
- I'll be all right.
- Are you sure?

449
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,402
There's plenty of blanket here.

450
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,613
Nah.

451
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,116
Oh, okay...

452
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,883
-Lsn't it cozy?
- Yeah, I think so.

453
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,965
- Stalker?
- Hmm?

454
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,675
Is that your sword
or you just happy to see me?

455
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,947
Well, what's the 0l' crystal ball
say about this one?

456
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,368
Just follow the road to bagoth,

457
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,462
turn west at a tree
that looks like a rock,

458
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,375
where you cross a dry riverbed,
where the water is more shallow.

459
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,632
What? Dry river?

460
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,129
Just-- just follow the mountains!

461
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,221
Okay!

462
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,430
Not gonna be any zombies
or anything, are there?

463
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,135
It's a clear road.
No surprises.

464
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,466
<i>- No surprises?
- No surprises.</i>

465
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,311
No surprises?

466
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,431
Some oracle
you turned out to be!

467
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,555
Three out of four's not bad!

468
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,310
Uh, why I oughta...

469
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,818
Rough crowd!

470
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,867
- Look, I...
- Let me do the talking.

471
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,710
Now listen.

472
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,419
I think there's been some mistake.
Maybe you haven't heard of me.

473
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,590
Silence!

474
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,840
Haven't we met before?

475
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,215
No, no, no.
I don't think so.

476
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,676
I would have remembered.

477
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,676
You look a lot like Evie of jzafir,
the demon Princess,

478
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,104
who raids our camps
and burns our crops,

479
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,483
and steals our men.

480
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,441
Me? A Princess?

481
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,243
Do I look like a Princess to you?

482
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,235
No.

483
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,276
But my name is reena.
Reena the seer.

484
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,332
- Reena?
- Oh, yeah...

485
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,622
Her name's reena, all right.
Reena the seer.

486
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,200
Reena the liar.

487
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,173
Oh, well,
maybe I've made a mistake.

488
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,004
Yeah, uh, well...

489
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,050
Now that we've, uh, cleared up
this little misunderstanding,

490
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,495
and we're all friends again...

491
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,222
Uh...Maybe we could just be
on our way.

492
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,301
The girl may go,

493
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,814
but not you.

494
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,891
Deathstalker.

495
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,805
So. You have heard of me.

496
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,230
Oh, yes.

497
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,811
Your legend precedes you.

498
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,778
Your exploits as a womanizer
are well known in these parts.

499
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,649
Well, I am more of a lover
than a fighter.

500
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,699
- I hope not.
- Huh?

501
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,084
You'll be put on trial for your
crimes against womanhood.

502
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,291
Trial?

503
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,919
- Trial?
- Trial...

504
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,038
...by combat!

505
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,838
Used to be able to do this great.

506
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,011
How's it goin'?

507
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,179
It's a farce!

508
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,087
I can beat any of these women

509
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,684
with my hands tied
behind my back.

510
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,679
That's the spirit!

511
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,430
Come on! Come on!
Let's get goin'!

512
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,352
Let's get in the ring!

513
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,770
Okay, okay, I'm goin'.
Stop shovin'...

514
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,237
- Deathstalker!
- Here it comes.

515
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,815
According to our laws,
we must settle

516
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,695
all serious disputes
in a trial by combat.

517
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,623
Your opponent, in this contest,

518
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,170
shall be none other than gorgo,

519
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,213
our fiercest warrior.

520
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,799
And my champion!

521
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,261
<i>Gorge: Gorge: Gorge:!</i>

522
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,430
I could beat her
with my eyes closed.

523
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,231
<i>Gorge'. Come on down!</i>

524
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,979
It's taking candy
from a baby. You name it!

525
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,403
Did you see her?

526
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,516
- Stalker.
- Shut up, will ya?

527
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,810
- Shut up.
- Stalker!

528
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,145
Look, I could beat her
with my eyes closed.

529
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,654
I think you should keep
at least one eye open.

530
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,566
What are you talking about?
What?

531
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:33,287
<i>Aumence: Gorge: Gorge:
Gorge: Gorgo!</i>

532
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:35,671
Get back!

533
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,539
<i>Gorge'. Gorge'.
Gorgo'. Gorgo!</i>

534

00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,906
It's payback time, stalker!

714
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,710
I'm all for it, of course.

715
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,231
Stalker!

716
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,381
What the matter?

717
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,458
Nothing. I just think there's
a time and a place for everything.

718
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,471
Well, the top half of you
may think it's the wrong time,

719
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,255
but the bottom half definitely
knows it's the right place!

720
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,356
Lord jarek,
we've recovered the body.

721
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,192
Get her in here at once, fools!

722
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,529
Will there be anything else,
my lord?

723
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,659
Out! Out!

724
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,322
As you wish, my lord.

725
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,278
Welcome back.

726
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,315
Very interesting.

727
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:02,899
Is there another way in?

728
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,494
Of course.

729
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:18,002
- Where do these tunnels go?
- Under the castle.

730
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,416
What was that?

731
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,094
The wind.

732
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,134
Friend of yours?

733
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,434
Looks like he died
with a gag in his mouth.

734
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,180
Yeah, well if he did,

735
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,759
he never got a chance
to tell it.

736
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,903
Stalker... I've got a feeling.

737
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,233
- Don't say it. Just don't say it!
- But...

738
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,609
Every time you have a vision,
something bad happens.

739
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,200
- Stalker!
- Get out! Just get out of here!

740
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,408
Hi, guys.

741
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,366
Ah, deathstalker...

742
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,037
You needn't come
through the servant's entrance.

743
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,384
I would have welcomed you
through the front gates.

744
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,299
Oh, I've seen
your welcoming committee.

745
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,258
You know, despite
your rather silly name,

746
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,968
I hear you're quite
an extra ordinary swordsmen.

747
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,176
Like a demonstration?

748
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,639
Another time, perhaps.

749
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,519
Oh, god, I've forgotten,
there won't be another time.

750
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,935
You see, I couldn't have possibly
attained my current position

751
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,352
b)! Playing fair.

752
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:22,767
Kill him.

753
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:24,612
Stop!

754
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,694
<i>- He's mine!
- Sultana?</i>

755
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,566
I thought you was dead.

756
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,819
Not hardly.

757
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,196
Well, I must say, you're lookin'
better than ever.

758
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,202
And it's, uh, really great
to be back here at the castle.

759
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,665
Found her, boys!

760
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,807
<i>- Poor girl fell off her horse.
- What can we do?</i>

761
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:58,978
Check her heart.

762
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,614
I think we revived her.

763
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:14,739
Huh?

764
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,074
Good evening, deathstalker.

765
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,074
Doesn't look too good from here.

766
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,155
Where's the little Princess?

767
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,791
You don't expect me to talk?

768
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,865
No,no,no...

769
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,580
I expect you to die.

770
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:07,286
And I'm sorry to see you go.
We could have made a great team.

771
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,174
There's still time.

772
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,884
I'm afraid,
time has run out for you.

773
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,302
Did you ever think
about joining our side?

774
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,048
Good-bye, deathstalker.

775
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,681
I shoulda stood in bed.

776
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,189
Mother.

777
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,322
Princess wants to see ya.

778
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,616
Dad got laid off.

779
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,948
Things were tough for our family
for a long time.

780
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,583
Nice digs.

781
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,344
Most of my gentleman callers
bring flowers.

782
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,125
Damn! My mistake.

783
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,763
I must have given them
to the wrong Princess.

784
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,008
I don't wanna shock ya,
but there's, uh, another girl

785
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,720
running around here
that's a dead ringer for you.

786
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,600
That little harlot is nothing
but a lying imposter.

787
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,234
That's funny, 'cause that's exactly
what she said about you.

788
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,307
Uh, say...

789
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,555
Would you mind, uh,
calling off your hogs here?

790
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,440
Big laughs, these guys.

791
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,318
Next time I see 'em, it's gonna be
on a plate next to some eggs.

792
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:21,368
Don't you think I look
like a Princess?

793
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,829
You dress like a Princess.

794
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,912
You walk like a Princess.

795
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,757
You kiss like a Princess.

796
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:39,716
But you sure don't act
like a Princess.

797
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,180
Oh? And how's a Princess
supposed to act?

798
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,720
I'm not sure...

799
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,103
But I, uh, think you're start...

800
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,977
I think you're starting
to get a handle on it.

801
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,146
I think so, too.

802
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:58,029
Oh, I could just eat you alive.

803
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,776
Bones and everything?

804
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,482
Mmm.

805
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,212
And now you're mine, stalker.

806
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,377
What?

807
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,309
I thought I told you
not to hang around

808
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,441
with girls like that!

809
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,531
Well, it was just her looks
that got to me.

810
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,069
Oh, well, in that case.

811
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,319
Uh, look...

812
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,320
I don't want to sound ungrateful
or anything but...

813
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,032
How the hell
did you get in here?

814
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:09,202
You're forgetting one thing, bucko...

815
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,414
This is my castle, my room...

816
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:14,207
My bed, for crying out loud!

817
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,082
And you think I don't know where
the secret passageways are?

818
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,344
Well, uh, thanks.

819
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,875
I thought you might need this.

820
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:26,683
You sure
you know where you're goin'?

821
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,545
I got us here, didn't I?

822
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,353
Yeah, just tell me
one thing, though,

823
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,598
why do secret passageways

824
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,349
have to be so damn clammy
and dark?

825
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,391
Quit gripin'.
We're almost here.

826
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:36,975
Besides, I got a surprise for ya.

827
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,977
Here we are.

828
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,565
Some surprise.

829
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,120
How do they say it,

830
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,908
"out of the frying pan,
into the fire"?

831
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:55,208
Yeah, that's how they say it,
all right.

832
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,381
You can't possibly kill us all.
One against 100.

833
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,455
Make that two against 100.

834
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,133
Kill them.

835
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,143
Hey!

836
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:12,217
What about we even up
those odds considerably?

837
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,020
Told ya I had a surprise.

838
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,739
Get them!

839
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,389
"L groans ]

840
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,014
Where are you going?

841
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,006
Leaving.

842
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,301
You owe me your life.

843
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,802
I owe nothing to any man,
even you.

844
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,310
Good luck,
'cause you're gonna need it.

845
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,637
Get out of my way!

846
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,358
What is going on here?

847
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,401
I have a splitting headache.
I'm trying to get some sleep!

848
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,192
You?

849
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,895
Inside! Inside!

850
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:32,815
It's not over yet.

851
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,621
You okay?

852
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:39,448
Guess you are.

853
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,746
Come on, we got business
to attend to.

854
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,745
How could you let this happen?
You've ruined my life!

855
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,047
I gave you your life!

856
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,215
Now, go to your chambers.
I'll be there shortly.

857
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:56,258
Go.

858
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:09,783
Throne room's that way.

859
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:10,935
Where you goin'?

860
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,781
There's only room
for one Princess in this castle.

861
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:14,820
What're you gonna do?

862
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,196
Can't tell ya.

863
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:17,783
Girl talk.

864
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,411
Oh.

865
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,901
You bitch!

866
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:42,491
Ew!

867
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,395
Still ready
for that demonstration?

868
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,069
Spoken like a true gallant!

869
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,072
And soon to be a legend.

870
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,032
But not a living one.

871
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,501
Up.

872
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,355
Yay!

873
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,985
Hey, stalker...

874
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:54,703
Look.

875
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,840
Your highness shall speak now.

876
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,298
This oughta be good.

877
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,300
Come forward, deathstalker.

878
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,187
We've searched
through the kingdom's coffers

879
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,937
for some expression
of our appreciation

880
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,936
for your magnificent deeds.

881
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,188
And that is?

882
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,533
You're looking at it, bucko.

883
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,742
You sure you made
the right choice?

884
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,580
I don't know.
Let me consult my crystal ball.

885
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:36,368
Uh...

886
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,287
You won't be needing this
anymore.

887
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,575
Ow!

888
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,924
So, you really think our story is
gonna make it into the legends?

889
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,166
Oh, more than that!

890
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,591
A thousand years from now,

891
