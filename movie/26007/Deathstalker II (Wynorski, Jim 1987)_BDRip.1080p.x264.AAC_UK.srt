1
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:21,712
- Is that where she keeps it?
- Mm-hm.

2
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,231
Come on! Come on!

3
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:14,357
Yam

4
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:17,860
I'll have my revenge...

5
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:20,446
And deathstalker, too!

6
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,382
Let me go! Let me go!

7
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,116
Quiet, or you'll eat
steel for dinner.

8
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,577
Looks like you've eaten
everything else.

9
00:03:57,994 --> 00:03:59,495
Shut up, you little wench.

10
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:02,290
This town's got no room
for beggars!

11
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,959
Lam not a beggar. I'm a seer.

12
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,419
Even the king knows that.

13
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,022
All too well, girl.

14
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:10,607
You're lucky to get away
with your life.

15
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,110
Look, his highness
asked for a prophecy,

16
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:14,426
and that's what he got.

17
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:16,570
In my kingdom,
a man would delight

18
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:18,345
to learn his wife
would soon be with child.

19
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,533
But not by another man,
eh, Marco?

20
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:23,101
I call 'em as I see 'em,
good or bad.

21
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,704
Even I can predict what's gonna
happen to you.

22
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:26,914
Give me a break!

23
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:28,578
How's an oracle supposed
to make a living?

24
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:31,649
The king wants you
off the castle grounds. Now!

25
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:33,777
You can't treat me like this!

26
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,673
- I'm a Princess!
- Right. Right.

27
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:38,758
- And I'm Merlin the magician!
- Yeah!

28
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:41,283
Now, be off with you,
"Princess of beggars".

29
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,053
You'll be sorry!

30
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:44,620
You're the one
that's gonna be sorry.

31
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:45,955
Let's get her!

32
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:50,543
Here.

33
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,671
- You know, boys.
- Who the hell are you?

34
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:58,049
Ordinarily, I don't mind seeing
a woman get a good beating,

35
00:04:58,258 --> 00:04:59,235
if she deserves it.

36
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,051
Yeah?

37
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,345
But this doesn't look
like much of a contest to me.

38
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,473
You picked the wrong town
to stop in, stranger.

39
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,909
He's gonna stop here
permanently.

40
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,018
You know who we are?

41
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,064
The village idiot
and the two runners-up?

42
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,232
Get him!

43
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,031
Yeah!

44
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:31,329
Hey, take it easy!
I don't even know these guys.

45
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:47,928
Hi.

46
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,930
Hello.

47
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,521
Whoo!

48
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,166
Whoa.

49
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,710
Whoa.

50
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,379
Oh, gets 'em every time.

51
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,316
Now, I got a nice,
big room upstairs.

52
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:54,322
What do you say, the three of us
go up there and...

53
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:57,074
- I need to talk to you.
- Line forms to the right.

54
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,576
You gotta help me!

55
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,996
One rescue a day,
that's my policy.

56
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,041
It's a matter of life and death.

57
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,585
Do the words, "walk east till your
hat floats" mean anything to ya?

58
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:11,755
Hey, you, Princess, I thought
we told you to get out of town.

59
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:23,515
Come here.

60
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:25,392
Get him!

61
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:36,857
What's the matter with you?

62
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:06,138
[ Gasps 1

63
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,663
what are you doing?

64
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,083
Look out!

65
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,960
Behind you!

66
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:59,353
Come on! Come on, the back door!
Let's go!

67
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,329
Let's get out of here!

68
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:21,433
After them!

69
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:22,666
Seal off the fence!

70
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:26,712
Yah! Yah!

71
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,799
Yam

72
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:59,408
- I'm Evie.
- Deathstalker.

73
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,369
- Deathstalker?
- Uh-huh.

74
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:04,080
Is that your first name
or your last name?

75
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,092
They're gaining!

76
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:48,828
You're good.

77
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,624
- Helps in my line of work.
- What line of work is that?

78
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:56,503
Oh, I like to call it the wealth
redistribution business.

79
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,440
Oh, so you rob from the rich
and give to the poor?

80
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:02,133
No, I rob from the rich
and pretty much keep it.

81
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,218
Do you think we lost 'em?

82
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:06,564
You gotta get up pretty early
in the morning

83
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:07,961
to catch the prince of thieves.

84
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:12,017
It is pretty early
in the morning!

85
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:14,227
Yah! Yah!

86
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,728
Yam

87
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:18,356
hey-yah!

88
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,068
'Hey-yahg

89
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:32,160
- hold it! Which way they go?
- I don't know.

90
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,180
You go north.

91
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:33,972
I'll head south.

92
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,306
I'll double back.
We'll meet here.

93
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,248
- But find him!
- Yah!

94
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:44,922
Yep.

95
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:47,507
I think we finally lost them.

96
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,178
- Starvin' here.
- Just a second.

97
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:52,781
Haven't had a thing to eat

98
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,515
since last night at aboud's.

99
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,247
Here, try it. It's my specialty.

100
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,563
Oh, your specialty, huh?

101
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:05,816
Like it?

102
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,046
Mmm.

103
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,838
Good. Very good.

104
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,797
Um...

105
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:12,572
Can I have some water, too,
please?

106
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:20,037
Thank you. That was great.
Great.

107
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:22,140
Boy, you must have
really been hungry!

108
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:22,956
Mm-hm.

109
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:25,250
- More?
- Oh, no!

110
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,873
Couldn't eat another bite.
Couldn't eat another bite.

111
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,255
I know I kinda messed things up
for you before...

112
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:36,386
Excuse me.
Just... struck me funny.

113
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,763
But I'm willing
to make it up to you.

114
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,097
I'm listening.

115
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:41,849
I can tell your future.

116
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,350
No, really!

117
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,229
I'm a seer. It's a gift I've had
since childhood.

118
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,314
Okay, things can't get
much worse, I guess.

119
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,066
Shoot

120
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,860
spirits of tomorrow...

121
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:55,945
Hear my call!

122
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,117
Wanna keep that to a minimum?

123
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:04,037
I see you embarking
on a heroic quest.

124
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:05,913
It shall become legend!

125
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,624
And storytellers shall recount
your many exploits

126
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,917
down through the ages.

127
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,085
Well, I sure hope
they get my name right.

128
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:14,212
An image is coming to me.

129
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,882
Yes. I see it so clear!

130
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:21,886
A young woman. No! A Princess.

131
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:23,364
A Princess?

132
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:26,033
<i>- She rich?
- She's calling to you.</i>

133
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,099
Help me!

134
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,869
Help me, deathstalker!

135
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,686
Only you can save me!

136
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,145
She's in trouble?

137
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:33,772
Oh, big trouble.

138
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,000
<i>A matter of life or death.</i>

139
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,316
Why?

140
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,403
- What?
- I see someone else.

141
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,196
Dark and evil.

142
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
This is bad.

143
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,366
This is real bad.

144
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,368
The Princess is being imprisoned
by jarek,

145
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,722
an evil sorcerer.

146
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,164
Are there any other kind?

147
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,499
He's also a great swordsman.

148
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,793
Even greater than deathstalker.

149
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,087
- Better than me?
- Wait!

150
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,130
He's laughing at you.

151
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:04,091
Come and get me, deathstalker,

152
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,718
if you dare.

153
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,345
The sorcerer...
Where do I find him?

154
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,973
In the land of jzafir.

155
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,515
Where the hell is that?

156
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:15,036
Oh, it's a long
and perilous journey.

157
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,954
Ah, figures.

158
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:19,165
Many dangers, witches,
dragons, ogres.

159
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,940
Must cut down
on the tourist trade!

160
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:24,151
You shall confront them all,
emerge victorious,

161
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,362
and reap a fabulous reward.

162
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:28,905
The all-seeing eye never lies.

163
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,201
And this is gonna get me
into the legends?

164
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,161
Right up there with conan!

165
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,163
Whoa!

166
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:40,749
Uh...

167
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,835
Sorry. You all right?

168
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,189
Yes.

169
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:45,379
Well, what about the reward?

170
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:47,215
When I know more,
you'll know more.

171
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:50,008
Well, that settles it, then.
I'm out of here.

172
00:14:50,718 --> 00:14:51,885
Where you goin'?

173
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,970
Let's go.

174
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm not getting any younger,
you know!

175
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:56,264
Go?

176
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:58,976
To jzafir? Now?

177
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:00,350
You got it, sis.

178
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,561
Wait a minute!
Well, wait a minute!

179
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,648
There's still more soup!

180
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,830
Next.

181
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,271
- Have you found the Princess yet?
- I'm working on it.

182
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,295
She won't get far.

183
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:33,965
You should have never
let her escape.

184
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:36,509
She might come back
and take the throne.

185
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,637
A waif pretending
to be a Princess?

186
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,347
Who would believe it?

187
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,642
Why don't you just... kill her?

188
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,187
Evie, darling,

189
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,105
we've gone over this
a dozen times before.

190
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:55,712
I created you from the original
soul of the Princess.

191
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:58,029
An exact duplicate
in all respects.

192
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,156
Unfortunately, I haven't had time
to work out the bugs.

193
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,620
In other words, if she dies...

194
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:09,164
You die.

195
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,269
Once I've made a few minor
adjustments in the formula,

196
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:13,626
I can duplicate anyone.

197
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,128
Then eliminate the original.

198
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,171
Now, my dear, please run along.

199
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,048
These brief practice sessions
are the...

200
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,843
Only leisure I allow myself.

201
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:25,137
And I enjoy them so much more...
Alone.

202
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,600
I'll be in my chamber...

203
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:30,809
Waiting.

204
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,604
As you wish, my dear.
As you wish.

205
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:36,523
Next!

206
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:40,401
Sultana.

207
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:44,238
You know how I hate
standing in line.

208
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,074
You look marvelous.

209
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:47,885
Lovely as a rose.

210
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:51,137
We can dispense with pleasantries,
if you don't mind.

211
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,514
After what you've done to me,

212
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:54,557
I'd hardly call this visit
a pleasure.

213
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,184
Whatever do you mean, my dear?

214
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,727
You never would have been
able to put

215
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,670
that little blonde bitch of yours
up on the throne without my help.

216
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,089
Let alone, get rid of the real one.

217
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,650
You were paid handsomely.

218
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,468
I did not come here to bicker
with you, jarek, my dear.

219
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:09,386
I have a proposition for you.

220
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,264
You wish to have the Princess Evie
returned to you.

221
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,909
I wish to settle a score
with a certain varlet

222
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,434
who is escorting her back here.

223
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,478
I have a man shadowing them now.

224
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:20,772
Doubtless, you'll remember chin,
the buccaneer?

225
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:22,690
Chin, the one-eye?

226
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,086
The man's a second-rate amateur.

227
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,652
In any event, you will assist him.

228
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,111
Evie is mine.

229
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,447
- And the meddler?
- Deathstalker.

230
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:32,657
Deathstalker?

231
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:36,036
Oh, very well, he's yours.
Enjoy.

232
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,495
Done.

233
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:42,124
- Always a pleasure, sultana.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

234
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,458
Next!

235
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:13,237
Which way, o mighty oracle?

236
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,738
Why do they call you
the prince of thieves?

237
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:18,551
Because I'm the best.

238
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:20,118
<i>But you're not a real prince?</i>

239
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:21,452
Which way?

240
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:23,287
The west road.

241
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,600
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

242
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:27,541
The crystal ball
never lets me down.

243
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,293
The west road.

244
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:30,877
You're sure about that?

245
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:33,254
The west road.

246
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:36,842
If you had the chance
to marry a real Princess,

247
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:38,092
would you do it?

248
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,260
No, I wouldn't.

249
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:40,196
Why not?

250
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,804
Because being a Princess brings out
the worst in a woman.

251
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:44,617
Always whinin' and poutin',
and actin'

252
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:47,241
like a spoiled little brat, if they
don't get their own way all...

253
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,491
Give it to me, chin.
What do you got?

254
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:07,077
Deathstalker's as good
as in the grave.

255
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:10,664
Look, sailor, don't carve
a tombstone so readily.

256
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,833
He has as many lives, as a cat.

257
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,460
And, remember,
the last one belongs to me.

258
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:20,191
If he's made of flesh and blood,
he can die.

259
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:22,425
Never underestimate
the strength of an enemy.

260
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:25,220
Especially an accomplished fighter
like stalker.

261
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:27,822
You telling me how to do
my job, sultana?

262
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:29,824
Just giving you
some friendly advice.

263
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:31,284
Well, keep it to yourself.

264
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:33,268
I'll bring stalker to you
on a platter.

265
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,395
Like a piece of raw meat.

266
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:36,688
Oh, yeah?

267
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:39,440
Yeah! I've got just the butchers
to do it!

268
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:43,652
Say hello to crazy Otto reingold,
the mad prussian,

269
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,382
solely responsible
for the lemurian massacres

270
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:48,533
that killed hundreds
and left thousands homeless.

271
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:51,761
I'm sure you recognize
ed "the head" schamanski.

272
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:53,805
Five years on the genghis Khan
strike force,

273
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,747
part-time consultant
to Attila the hun.

274
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:57,225
Next.

275
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:00,436
John "the baptist" bombaso.
Drowning's his specialty.

276
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,562
Beside him...

277
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,420
Nick "the crippler" of kashmir.

278
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:05,171
I think his name says it all.

279
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:08,360
And last, but not least,
the real find,

280
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:10,219
buddy "footstool" laroza,

281
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,698
only recently dismissed
by Ivan the terrible...

282
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:14,640
<i>for excessive brutality.</i>

283
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,392
Still skeptical?

284
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,770
You bet I am.

285
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,982
Suit yourself.

286
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,816
Come on, boys.

287
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:35,283
Okay, men. Let him have it!

288
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,335
Close, men, but don't kill...
Not yet.

289
00:21:39,343 --> 00:21:41,028
I think we better find
another way.

290
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,344
Oh, really? You think so?

291
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:44,448
West road, right!

292
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:45,472
I oughta...

293
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,643
- Who are they?
- You tell me. You're the seer.

294
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:51,562
Well, they're trying to kill us.

295
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,314
Somebody give the lady a cigar.

296
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,793
Look, if they were trying
to kill us,

297
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,657
they could have done it
way back down the road.

298
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,672
No, they're...
They're after something.

299
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,676
You sure you're telling me
everything?

300
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,675
I told you it was gonna be a long
and perilous journey, didn't I?

301
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,159
Yeah, yeah, witches, ogres,
all that bad stuff.

302
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,501
You and your visions!

303
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,714
Knew these would come in handy.

304
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,135
Where you goin'?

305
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,761
- Just stay put.
- I wanna help.

306
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,513
You've done plenty already.

307
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:38,647
That'll be fine, boys.
Save your arrows.

308
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:28,483
Whew.

309
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:02,390
Stalker? Stalker!

310
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,459
There... huh?

311
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,213
Throw your sword down...

312
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,549
Or I'll cut her pretty,
little throat.

313
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:42,427
Go ahead. Cut it.

314
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:44,177
You rat!

315
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:50,934
You were gonna let him kill me!

316
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:52,770
Now, would I do a thing
like that?

317
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:57,043
Come on, let's go find that horse
and get the hell out of here.

318
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,190
Oh!

319
00:24:58,441 --> 00:24:59,835
And, uh, would you mind
taking that knife

320
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:00,878
out of that guy for me?

321
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,069
It's the only one I got left.

322
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:05,948
Ew!

323
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:10,136
- Wait a minute!
- What do you want now?

324
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,994
Were you really gonna
let him kill me?

325
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,872
Deathstalker, you weren't really
gonna let him kill me, were you?

326
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:16,708
Huh? No, you wouldn't do that?
Deathstalker!

327
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:26,633
Ah, you're back!
Minus the fearless five.

328
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,167
You should have listened to me.

329
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:31,531
You wanna bitch? Bitch to jarek.

330
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:32,931
I'm calling him right now.

331
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:50,072
- What news have you?
- Bad news, lord jarek.

332
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:53,302
I hate bad news.
It spoils my day.

333
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:54,327
I got an idea.

334
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,119
Come closer.

335
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:00,456
I'll kill that son of a bitch
if it kills me.

336
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:03,334
You may rest assured
that it will.

337
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,768
So long, sailor.

338
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:39,951
Well, look what we have here.

339
00:26:42,037 --> 00:26:43,288
Spooky, huh?

340
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:45,122
Yeah.

341
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,711
Stalker...

342
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:54,691
I still don't understand
why you want to break in there.

343
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:56,091
Because we're broke, that's why.

344
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:57,967
What's that got to do with anything?

345
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,345
That's a family mausoleum.

346
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:03,389
There are probably...

347
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:06,226
More jewels in there,
than we can carry out.

348
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:09,769
You're about to become
a very rich woman.

349
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,272
I was just starting
to enjoy poverty.

350
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:14,206
Come on, where's your sense
of adventure?

351
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,754
This isn't adventure.
It's just damn scary!

352
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:19,923
Yeah, but, uh...
When legends told...

353
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:21,948
I want people to think
we faced this bravely.

354
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:25,844
When the legend's told,

355
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:27,911
nobody's gonna believe
we were this stupid!

356
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:31,707
- Stalker.
- Huh?

357
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,644
I heard somewhere it was bad luck
to walk over graves.

358
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:35,988
I heard it was only
the open ones.

359
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:39,296
- Wait a minute!
- What?

360
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,967
I just remembered. My hat...

361
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:45,094
I left the door unlocked.
We gotta go back!

362
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:47,656
- You don't have a door?
- I don't?

363
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
No.

364
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:49,848
Oh, yeah.

365
00:27:52,143 --> 00:27:53,435
What was that?

366
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:56,604
The wind.

367
00:27:56,855 --> 00:28:00,191
It should get oiled.
It came from in there.

368
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:03,027
You bet it did.

369
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,571
Stalker, you're not really
going in there?

370
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,956
- Don't go in there. It's dark.
- Look, relax, will ya?

371
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:21,127
Whew!

372
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,880
Well, come on in.
What are you waiting for?

373
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,206
Ah, come on, it's a little smelly,
but what could happen?

374
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:31,219
Stalker!

375
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:46,775
Stalker.

376
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:17,929
You know...

377
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:21,182
Grave robbing is not only
morally repulsive,

378
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,018
but I believe it carries a rather
stiff penalty, in these parts.

379
00:29:26,062 --> 00:29:27,247
Who the hell are you?

380
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:29,648
Forgive me for not introducing
myself properly.

381
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,526
But I assumed a person with even
your limited deductive powers,

382
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:33,693
could have guessed.

383
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:35,486
Jarek.

384
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:47,206
Stalker.

385
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:03,178
Stalker!

386
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:08,017
Get out here!
Stalker, get out here!

387
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:09,852
I'd offer you my hand, sir.

388
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:12,413
But it's both tiring
and inconvenient

389
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,272
to be at two places at once...

390
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,417
Even for a sorcerer.

391
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,609
So if you'll be so good
as to excuse me,

392
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,612
I have a rather pressing
engagement to attend to.

393
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,280
And, oh, by the way...

394
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,198
I've arranged one for you
as well.

395
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,870
<i>Stalker!</i>

396
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,646
Ah! Son of a bitch.

397
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,631
Ah! The old crushing wall
routine, huh?

398
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,160
You couldn't do better than this?

399
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:49,638
Me and my big mouth...

400
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,309
Stalker! Stalker!

401
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:01,732
Stalker!

402
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:04,444
Stalker!

403
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:05,903
Stalker!

404
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,532
Gotta be a secret lever
around here some place.

405
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:13,993
Uh-huh!

406
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:18,664
Yipe!

407
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,876
Stalker!

408
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:25,128
Stalker!

409
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:52,487
Stalker!

410
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:04,539
Stalker!

411
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,376
Stalker! Get out here!

412
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:10,379
Stalker!

413
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:16,152
Gosh, leave you alone
for five minutes,

414
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:17,218
look what happens.

415
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:19,553
Come on!

416
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:21,950
Come on!

417
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,391
I'm comin'! I'm comin'!

418
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:36,545
Yah! Yah!

419
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:37,570
Come on! Yah!

420
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,089
Don't you know another tune?

421
00:32:58,674 --> 00:32:59,966
Get out of here!

422
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:08,849
It's happening again!

423
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:13,103
Guards! Guards!

424
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:18,984
"- No! No!

425
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:22,778
No!

426
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,617
Dinner is served, your majesty.

427
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,124
- Did you see the face on her?
- Too bad. Nice body, though!

428
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:44,214
Come.

429
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:48,094
I won't bite.

430
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:31,258
You know, something funny
is going on here.

431
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,843
First, we get attacked
by bandits.

432
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:36,782
Then those damned zombies.
What's next?

433
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,056
Don't answer that!

434
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:42,267
Every time,
it's like they're waiting for us.

435
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:44,770
This jarek guy
is playing for keeps.

436
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:47,291
I told you the path would be
filled with perils.

437
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:48,441
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:50,835
We can forget the legend,
if you want to.

439
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:52,318
There's still time to turn back.

440
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:54,320
Reward's still up for grabs,
isn't it?

441
00:34:54,738 --> 00:34:55,632
Uh-huh.

442
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:57,449
Who said anything
about turning back?

443
00:34:58,116 --> 00:34:59,408
Not me.

444
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Here...

445
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:04,746
Looks like you could use this.

446
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:07,333
What are you gonna use?

447
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,418
The fire won't last
but a few more minutes.

448
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:12,856
- I'll be all right.
- Are you sure?

449
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,630
There's plenty of blanket here.

450
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,841
Nah.

451
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:23,347
Oh, okay...

452
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:35,109
- Isn't it cozy?
- Yeah, I think so.

453
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:38,193
- Stalker?
- Hmm?

454
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,906
Is that your sword
or you just happy to see me?

455
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:01,174
Well, what's the 0l' crystal ball
say about this one?

456
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,593
Just follow the road to bagoth,

457
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:06,679
turn west at a tree
that looks like a rock,

458
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:10,599
where you cross a dry riverbed,
where the water is more shallow.

459
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:12,828
What? Dry river?

460
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:14,353
Just... just follow the mountains!

461
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:15,603
Okay!

462
00:36:15,812 --> 00:36:17,623
Not gonna be any zombies
or anything, are there?

463
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:20,334
It's a clear road. No surprises.

464
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,693
<i>- No surprises?
- No surprises.</i>

465
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:24,529
No surprises?

466
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:26,655
Some oracle
you turned out to be!

467
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:28,782
Three out of four's not bad!

468
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:30,534
Uh, why I oughta...

469
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,041
Rough crowd!

470
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:51,093
- Look, I...
- Let me do the talking.

471
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,179
Now listen.

472
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:55,825
I think there's been some mistake.
Maybe you haven't heard of me.

473
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:56,849
Silence!

474
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,060
Haven't we met before?

475
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:01,437
No, no, no. I don't think so.

476
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:02,897
I would have remembered.

477
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:07,878
You look a lot like Evie of jzafir,
the demon Princess,

478
00:37:07,902 --> 00:37:10,297
who raids our camps
and burns our crops,

479
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:11,697
and steals our men.

480
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:13,657
Me? A Princess?

481
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,428
Do I look like a Princess to you?

482
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:18,429
No.

483
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,497
But my name is reena.
Reena the seer.

484
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:24,542
- Reena?
- Oh, yeah...

485
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,836
Her name's reena, all right.
Reena the seer.

486
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:28,420
Reena the liar.

487
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,381
Oh, well,
maybe I've made a mistake.

488
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,216
Yeah, uh, well...

489
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:36,237
Now that we've, uh, cleared up
this little misunderstanding,

490
00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:37,720
and we're all friends again...

491
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:40,430
Uh... Maybe we could just be

656
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:29,068
<i>No.</i>

657
00:48:32,154 --> 00:48:34,990
- Have you seen deathstalker?
- No.

658
00:48:39,661 --> 00:48:41,704
- Have you seen deathstalker?
- There he is.

659
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,942
Shall we drink, then, to your
magnificent battle tonight?

660
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,319
And...

661
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,864
The magnificent battle
yet to come.

662
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,242
Which one's that?

663
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:24,410
Oh, that!

664
00:49:28,456 --> 00:49:30,082
Your body's close to me...

665
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,210
But your mind seems far away.

666
00:49:35,962 --> 00:49:40,341
Just... wait here, one minute.

667
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:42,552
Don't go away.

668
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:50,934
- Stalker?
- Hmm?

669
00:49:51,185 --> 00:49:52,185
Just think...

670
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:56,898
Our lovemaking tonight may spawn
generations of leaders to come.

671
00:49:57,316 --> 00:50:01,152
The passion in our hearts will burn
like a great sensual fire...

672
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:05,072
Melding our souls into
a whirlpool of unending ecstasy.

673
00:50:05,907 --> 00:50:08,492
- Sounds good to me.
- Tomorrow...

674
00:50:08,826 --> 00:50:10,702
My servant will awaken us
at dawn.

675
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,329
You gotta be kiddin'?

676
00:50:12,996 --> 00:50:15,308
After that fight, I was kinda
looking forward to sleeping in.

677
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:17,292
Oh, no! That's not possible.

678
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:20,503
The ceremony traditionally
is performed at daybreak.

679
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:22,464
Ceremony? What ceremony?

680
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:24,840
Our wedding ceremony.

681
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:33,724
Aw, shit!

682
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:37,736
Excuse me, have you seen
the girl I was with?

683
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:40,081
I think she left a half-hour ago.

684
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:41,105
Thanks.

685
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:00,974
I don't suppose you guys
are hunters,

686
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:02,541
and I stepped
into your bear trap?

687
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:06,712
Nah, I didn't think so.

688
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:21,809
Ah!

689
00:51:21,935 --> 00:51:24,020
Now that you're up,
your royal highness,

690
00:51:24,354 --> 00:51:26,271
there are matters
we need to discuss.

691
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,292
You're the one who helped jarek!

692
00:51:29,316 --> 00:51:31,128
In all the excitement,
we never really did

693
00:51:31,152 --> 00:51:32,778
have a chance
to sit down and talk.

694
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:34,780
But now we can fix all that.

695
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:37,216
Where's deathstalker?

696
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,908
Why should I tell you anything?

697
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,992
Huh?

698
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:42,494
I can think of lots of reasons.

699
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:44,163
Here's one.

700
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:46,749
[ Gasps 1

701
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,000
I'll never talk!

702
00:51:49,334 --> 00:51:50,793
And do you know why?

703
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:53,212
Jarek needs to keep me alive.

704
00:51:53,505 --> 00:51:55,567
You kill me,
and you're as good as dead,

705
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:56,591
and you know it.

706
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,611
Do you know that I
could drop you, say,

707
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:01,762
up to your waist, and you'd still
be very much alive?

708
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:04,014
Now, where is deathstalker?

709
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:07,309
Somebody looking for me?

710
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,353
- Stalker!
- You came back!

711
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,022
By popular demand.

712
00:52:11,314 --> 00:52:12,982
Get him!

713
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:43,050
It's payback time, stalker!

714
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:47,847
I'm all for it, of course.

715
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:50,362
Stalker!

716
00:54:15,594 --> 00:54:16,488
What the matter?

717
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:19,032
Nothing. I just think there's
a time and a place for everything.

718
00:54:19,264 --> 00:54:21,599
Well, the top half of you
may think it's the wrong time,

719
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,394
but the bottom half definitely
knows it's the right place!

720
00:54:34,278 --> 00:54:37,489
Lord jarek,
we've recovered the body.

721
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:40,325
Get her in here at once, fools!

722
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,636
Will there be anything else,
my lord?

723
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,786
Out! Out!

724
00:54:43,953 --> 00:54:45,454
As you wish, my lord.

725
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,407
Welcome back.

726
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,441
Very interesting.

727
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,026
Is there another way in?

728
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,611
Of course.

729
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,123
- Where do these tunnels go?
- Under the castle.

730
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:20,749
What was that?

731
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,209
The wind.

732
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:27,297
Friend of yours?

733
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:29,549
Looks like he died
with a gag in his mouth.

734
00:56:30,342 --> 00:56:31,278
Yeah, well if he did,

735
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:32,885
he never got a chance
to tell it.

736
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:40,018
Stalker... I've got a feeling.

737
00:56:40,185 --> 00:56:42,352
- Don't say it. Just don't say it!
- But...

738
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,731
Every time you have a vision,
something bad happens.

739
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,318
- Stalker!
- Get out! Just get out of here!

740
00:56:53,488 --> 00:56:54,530
Hi, guys.

741
00:56:57,576 --> 00:56:59,494
Ah, deathstalker...

742
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:02,164
You needn't come
through the servant's entrance.

743
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:04,475
I would have welcomed you
through the front gates.

744
00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:06,393
Oh, I've seen
your welcoming committee.

745
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:08,353
You know, despite
your rather silly name,

746
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:11,088
I hear you're quite
an extra ordinary swordsmen.

747
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:12,297
Like a demonstration?

748
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:13,734
Another time, perhaps.

749
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:16,635
Oh, god, I've forgotten,
there won't be another time.

750
00:57:16,844 --> 00:57:20,054
You see, I couldn't have possibly
attained my current position

751
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,472
(b)! Playing fair.

752
00:57:22,265 --> 00:57:23,265
Kill him.

753
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:24,850
Stop!

754
00:57:26,352 --> 00:57:28,812
<i>- He's mine!
- Sultana?</i>

755
00:57:29,563 --> 00:57:30,689
I thought you was dead.

756
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:32,940
Not hardly.

757
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:35,295
Well, I must say, you're lookin'
better than ever.

758
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,559
And it's, uh, really great
to be back here at the castle.

759
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:46,787
Found her, boys!

760
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:57,922
<i>- Poor girl fell off her horse.
- What can we do?</i>

761
00:57:58,173 --> 00:57:59,173
Check her heart.

762
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:12,727
I think we revived her.

763
00:58:14,063 --> 00:58:15,063
Huh?

764
00:58:50,805 --> 00:58:52,181
Good evening, deathstalker.

765
00:58:52,765 --> 00:58:54,182
Doesn't look too good from here.

766
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:57,268
Where's the little Princess?

767
00:58:57,561 --> 00:58:58,871
You don't expect me to talk?

768
00:58:58,895 --> 00:58:59,956
No, no, no...

769
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,690
I expect you to die.

770
00:59:03,316 --> 00:59:07,402
And I'm sorry to see you go.
We could have made a great team.

771
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:09,279
There's still time.

772
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:11,990
I'm afraid,
time has run out for you.

773
00:59:12,241 --> 00:59:14,409
Did you ever think
about joining our side?

774
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,162
Good-bye, deathstalker.

775
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,789
I shoulda stood in bed.

776
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:27,337
Mother.

777
00:59:32,009 --> 00:59:33,427
Princess wants to see ya.

778
00:59:38,473 --> 00:59:39,701
Dad got laid off.

779
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:42,060
Things were tough for our family
for a long time.

780
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:46,688
Nice digs.

781
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,444
Most of my gentleman callers
bring flowers.

782
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:53,237
Damn! My mistake.

783
00:59:53,529 --> 00:59:55,089
I must have given them
to the wrong Princess.

784
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,091
I don't wanna shock ya,
but there's, uh, another girl

785
00:59:57,115 --> 00:59:58,801
running around here
that's a dead ringer for you.

786
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:01,702
That little harlot is nothing
but a lying imposter.

787
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:05,331
That's funny, 'cause that's exactly
what she said about you.

788
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:06,582
Uh, say...

789
01:00:06,999 --> 01:00:09,668
Would you mind, uh,
calling off your hogs here?

790
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:14,548
Big laughs, these guys.

791
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:17,426
Next time I see 'em, it's gonna be
on a plate next to some eggs.

792
01:00:18,302 --> 01:00:21,470
Don't you think I look
like a Princess?

793
01:00:22,722 --> 01:00:23,931
You dress like a Princess.

794
01:00:24,515 --> 01:00:26,016
You walk like a Princess.

795
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:35,858
You kiss like a Princess.

796
01:00:37,778 --> 01:00:39,821
But you sure don't act
like a Princess.

797
01:00:40,572 --> 01:00:43,283
Oh? And how's a Princess
supposed to act?

798
01:00:43,991 --> 01:00:44,991
I'm not sure...

799
01:00:45,284 --> 01:00:47,202
But I, uh, think you're start...

800
01:00:49,038 --> 01:00:51,081
I think you're starting
to get a handle on it.

801
01:00:51,707 --> 01:00:53,250
I think so, too.

802
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,129
Oh, I could just eat you alive.

803
01:00:58,546 --> 01:00:59,880
Bones and everything?

804
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,574
Mmm.

805
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:38,305
And now you're mine, stalker.

806
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:40,639
What?

807
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,378
I thought I told you
not to hang around

808
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,528
with girls like that!

809
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,615
Well, it was just her looks
that got to me.

810
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:01,135
Oh, well, in that case.

811
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:02,386
Uh, look...

812
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,412
I don't want to sound ungrateful
or anything but...

813
01:03:05,872 --> 01:03:07,152
How the hell
did you get in here?

814
01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:09,291
You're forgetting one thing, bucko...

815
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,501
This is my castle, my room...

816
01:03:12,336 --> 01:03:14,296
My bed, for crying out loud!

817
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:17,173
And you think I don't know where
the secret passageways are?

818
01:03:17,883 --> 01:03:19,426
Well, uh, thanks.

819
01:03:20,344 --> 01:03:21,969
I thought you might need this.

820
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:27,121
You sure
you know where you're goin'?

821
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:28,642
I got us here, didn't I?

822
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,412
Yeah, just tell me
one thing, though,

823
01:03:30,436 --> 01:03:31,663
why do secret passageways

824
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:33,414
have to be so damn clammy
and dark?

825
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:35,458
Quit gripin'. We're almost here.

826
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:37,066
Besides, I got a surprise for ya.

827
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,068
Here we are.

828
01:03:47,201 --> 01:03:48,660
Some surprise.

829
01:03:49,036 --> 01:03:50,203
How do they say it,

830
01:03:50,704 --> 01:03:52,997
"out of the frying pan,
into the fire"?

831
01:03:53,374 --> 01:03:55,292
Yeah, that's how they say it,
all right.

832
01:03:56,627 --> 01:04:00,463
You can't possibly kill us all.
One against 100.

833
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,548
Make that two against 100.

834
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:05,217
Kill them.

835
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:07,428
Hey!

836
01:04:09,222 --> 01:04:12,307
What about we even up
those odds considerably?

837
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:18,105
Told ya I had a surprise.

838
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:26,862
Get them!

839
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:30,463
[ "I groans ]

840
01:06:08,289 --> 01:06:10,082
Where are you going?

841
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,291
Leaving.

842
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:12,352
You owe me your life.

843
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:14,878
I owe nothing to any man,
even you.

844
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,357
Good luck,
'cause you're gonna need it.

845
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:18,715
Get out of my way!

846
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:26,430
What is going on here?

847
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:29,451
I have a splitting headache.
I'm trying to get some sleep!

848
01:06:29,475 --> 01:06:30,475
You?

849
01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:31,954
Inside! Inside!

850
01:06:31,978 --> 01:06:32,978
It's not over yet.

851
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:35,814
You okay?

852
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:39,650
Guess you are.

853
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:41,819
Come on, we got business
to attend to.

854
01:06:43,947 --> 01:06:46,824
How could you let this happen?
You've ruined my life!

855
01:06:48,158 --> 01:06:50,118
I gave you your life!

856
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:55,290
Now, go to your chambers.
I'll be there shortly.

857
01:06:55,499 --> 01:06:56,499
Go.

858
01:07:08,803 --> 01:07:09,845
Throne room's that way.

859
01:07:10,305 --> 01:07:11,305
Where you goin'?

860
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:13,848
There's only room
for one Princess in this castle.

861
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,099
What're you gonna do?

862
01:07:15,475 --> 01:07:16,475
Can't tell ya.

863
01:07:16,852 --> 01:07:17,853
Girl talk.

864
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:19,770
Oh.

865
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:33,964
You bitch!

866
01:08:41,513 --> 01:08:42,555
Ew!

867
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:12,458
Still ready
for that demonstration?

868
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,126
Spoken like a true gallant!

869
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:17,128
And soon to be a legend.

870
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:19,088
But not a living one.

871
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:39,759
Up.

872
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,406
Yay!

873
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,034
Hey, stalker...

874
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,745
Look.

875
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:03,877
Your highness shall speak now.

876
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:05,337
This oughta be good.

877
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,340
Come forward, deathstalker.

878
01:13:18,016 --> 01:13:20,202
We've searched
through the kingdom's coffers

879
01:13:20,226 --> 01:13:21,977
for some expression
of our appreciation

880
01:13:22,145 --> 01:13:23,980
for your magnificent deeds.

881
01:13:25,357 --> 01:13:26,357
And that is?

882
01:13:26,942 --> 01:13:28,567
You're looking at it, bucko.

883
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:32,930
You sure you made
the right choice?

884
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:35,592
I don't know.
Let me consult my crystal ball.

885
01:13:35,616 --> 01:13:36,616
Uh...

886
01:13:37,785 --> 01:13:39,328
You won't be needing this
anymore.

887
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:41,598
Ow!

888
01:13:41,622 --> 01:13:44,099
So, you really think our story is
gonna make it into the legends?

889
01:13:44,123 --> 01:13:45,207
Oh, more than that!

890
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,602
A thousand years from now,

891
01:13:46,626 --> 01:13:48,628
players will re-enact
all our exploits.

892
01:13:49,045 --> 01:13:50,045
Really?

893
01:13:51,255 --> 01:13:54,840
Well... I sure hope they get
a good-looking guy to play me!

894
01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:47,639
[ Cheering 1 ole!

895
01:15:37,352 --> 01:15:38,288
Stalker!

896
01:15:38,312 --> 01:15:40,022
God, I leave you alone
for five minutes,

897
01:15:40,314 --> 01:15:41,314
look what happens. Ow!

898
01:15:41,356 --> 01:15:42,814
Goddamnit, that's hot!

899
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:54,367
Don't you think
I look like a Princess?

900
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:57,245
You dress like a Princess.

901
01:15:57,829 --> 01:15:59,789
Oh, I hate these friggin' stairs!

902
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:01,290
Excuse me.

903
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:33,069
That's lunch! 30 minutes!

904
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:47,415
Huh?

905
01:17:00,554 --> 01:17:01,763
Don't laugh at me!
