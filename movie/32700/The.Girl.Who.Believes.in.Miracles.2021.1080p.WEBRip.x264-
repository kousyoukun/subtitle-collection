1
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:07,010
对大多数人来说，对家庭有强烈的信仰是非常典型的。依靠他们的爱和支持。
It is perfectly typical for most people to have a strong faith in their families... relying on them for love and support.

2
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:13,448
他们是和我们一起长大的人，他们养育了我们，希望他们是真正的啦啦队长。
These are people we've grown up with, who've nurtured us and who, hopefully, have been real cheerleaders for us.

3
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:18,153
但是…让我们来看另一个关于另一种信仰的寓言。
But... let's look at another parable that talks about a different kind of faith.

4
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,956
它是这么说的。
And here's what it says.

5
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:29,966
天国好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在田里，比一切的种都小。
"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of a mustard seed, "which a man took and sowed in his field, "and which indeed is smaller than all seeds.

6
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:43,478
"等它长起来，就比所有的菜都大" "成了树，甚至有飞鸟来宿在它的枝子上"
"But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs "and becomes a tree, so that birds come and lodge in its branches."

7
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:51,688
的确，信仰可以变得如此强大……它可以移动一座山。
And indeed, faith can become so strong... that it can move a mountain.

8
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:04,199
没错!在右边!
Right! On the right!

9
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,137
这就对了，丹尼，摆脱它的方式!
There you go, Danny, way to shake it off!

10
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,273
亲爱的，过来，坐回去。
Honey, come on, sit back down.

11
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,479
谢谢你给我留了个座位。
Thanks for saving me a seat.

12
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:20,415
我，我是旁观者，但我快疯了。
I, I was on the sidelines, but it's driving me crazy.

13
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,384
我受不了这种压力!
I can't take this pressure!

14
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:26,254
我哥哥知道他有世界上最好的女朋友。
Well, my brother knows he's got the best girlfriend in the world.

15
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:28,256
是啊，也是最紧张的。
Yeah, and the most nervous.

16
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,892
山姆在哪里?
Where's Sam?

17
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,928
他去给我们买热狗了。
He went to go get us some hot dogs.

18
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,228
希望他不要错过什么。
Hope he doesn't miss anything.

19
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,164
回去，回去!
Head back, head back!

20
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,200
在这里,外面!
Right here, outside!

21
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:39,234
我得到它!
I got it!

22
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,537
到空地上去!
Get to the open space!

23
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,882
54号命令，准备!
Order number 54, ready!

24
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,885
52岁的数量准备好了!
Number 52, ready!

25
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,230
——嘿!-你在干什么，老家伙?!
- Hey! - What are you doing, old man?!

26
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:11,801
我是在阻止两个小混混偷我朋友的钱，还是你忘了把钱放在柜台上?
I'm stopping two punks from ripping off my friend, or did you just forget to put the money on the counter, huh?

27
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,970
你疯了吗?
What are you, crazy?

28
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:16,105
我不认为我疯了，儿子。
I don't think I'm crazy, son.

29
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,373
有很多人都这么做。
There's a lot of people who do.

30
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,676
你去那边付钱给那个女人。
You get your butts over there and pay that woman.

31
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,477
你会希望你今天早上没有醒来的，老头。
You're gonna wish you didn't wake up this morning, old man.

32
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:26,048
哦,真的吗?
Oh, really?

33
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,153
——啊!——惊喜!
- Aah! - Surprise!

34
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,823
好了,儿子。
All right, son.

35
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:36,259
再过20秒我就要掐死你了。
I'm choking you out in about 20 seconds.

36
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,095
除了付餐费，你什么也做不了。
Nothing you can do about it except pay for that food.

37
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,630
我，我没有钱。
I, I don't have any money.

38
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,031
我们都不知道。
Neither of us do.

39
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,432
把你的钱包拿出来，给我。
Take your wallet out and give it to me.

40
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,402
在哪里?给我吧。
Where is it? Let me have it.

41
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,507
哦，等一下。
Oh, wait a minute.

42
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:56,511
你是瑞安·布罗迪吗?你查克的男孩?
You're Ryan Brody? You're Chuck's boy?

43
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,480
你一定是尼克·路易斯，对吧?
So you gotta be Nick Lewis, right?

44
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,651
好了，笨手笨脚的，接下来是这样的。
All right, fumble-wits, this is how this is gonna go.

45
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:07,489
我来付这顿饭的钱，你们去Crestline查查Sam Donovan。
I'm gonna pay for this food, and y'all are gonna look up Sam Donovan on Crestline.

46
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:12,695
如果我明天晚上能拿到钱，我就没有理由打电话给你父亲了。
If I get paid back by tomorrow night, I won't have any reason to call your fathers.

47
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,199
我们达成协议了吗?
We have an agreement?

48
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,633
我们达成协议了吗?
Do we have an agreement?!

49
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,635
是的。我们有个协议。
Yeah. We have an agreement.

50
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,704
你学习。
You're learning.

51
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,606
玛丽亚。
Maria.

52
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,340
嗨,山姆。
Hey, Sam.

53
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,676
这是您点的菜。
Here's your order.

54
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,343
好的，给你钱。
Okay, here's your money.

55
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,645
不用找了。
Keep the change.

56
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,714
谢谢你！
Thank you.

57
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,549
你没必要这么做的。
You know, you didn't have to do that.

58
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,652
那两个可能是好孩子。
Those two are probably good kids.

59
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,788
他们只是需要一点指导。
They just need a little guidance.

60
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,389
是的,嗯…考虑他们指导。
Yeah, well... consider 'em guided.

61
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,099
!来吧,·纽伯
Come on, Newburn!

62
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,034
没有个人犯规!
No personal fouls!

63
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,872
48号需要被踢一脚才能清醒过来。
That number 48 needs a kick in the butt to clear his mind.

64
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,674
爸爸……就当我没说过。
Dad... Pretend I didn't say it.

65
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:01,077
但我们总得做点什么。
Oh, but we gotta do something.

66
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,645
我们快没时间了。
We're running out of time here.

67
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,315
嘿,布劳恩!
Hey, Brauner!

68
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:09,018
你真该被淘汰了!
You should be out of the game for that!

69
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,485
准备好回家了吗，霍普金斯?
You ready to go home yet, Hopkins?

70
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,057
踢出去，踢出去!
Kick it out, kick it out!

71
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,759
-很好，很好!——是的!
- Good one, good one! - Yes!

72
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:18,661
他们一定要赢，爷爷。
They just have to win, Grampa.

73
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:21,898
他们必须进入决赛。
They have to make it to the finals.

74
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,699
真希望我能帮助他们。
Wish I could help them.

75
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,034
等一下。
Wait a minute.

76
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:29,272
你不就是那个经常和我谈论上帝的小女孩吗?
Aren't you the little girl that's always talking to me about God?

77
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:30,940
也许你和他的关系不错。
Well, maybe you're on good terms with Him.

78
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,843
你为什么不问问他呢?也许他会做点什么。
Why don't you ask Him? Maybe He'll do something.

79
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:36,411
好吧,上帝。
Okay, God.

80
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,247
这是给丹尼队的。
This one's for Danny's team.

81
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:44,452
请赐予我弟弟力量，让他踢得比那支愚蠢的球队里的任何人都更狠更快。
Please give my brother the strength to kick harder and faster than anyone else on that other stupid team.

82
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:50,993
我…也许我不该在祈祷词里说"愚蠢"对吧?
I... guess maybe I shouldn't have said "stupid" in my prayer, huh?

83
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,598
这个比巧克力还甜。
This one is just sweeter than chocolate.

84
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,786
是啊!走,丹尼!
Yeah! Go, Danny!

85
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,155
我的祷告工作!
My prayer worked!

86
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,389
你看到了什么?我告诉你。
You see? I told you.

87
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:22,992
谢谢你,上帝。
Thank You, God.

88
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:29,832
好吧，如果我们能再坚持21秒，我们就要进入加时赛了。
Okay, if we can just hold on for another 21 more seconds, we're going to overtime.

89
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,567
通过它!我没人，我没人!
Pass it! I'm open, I'm open!

90
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,277
哦,来吧!他故意绊倒我!那不是犯规!
Oh, come on! He tripped over me on purpose! That's not a foul!

91
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,646
哦，拜托，裁判，一张黄牌?没门!
Oh, come on, ref, a yellow card? No way!

92
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,283
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

93
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:54,223
意思是布劳纳那小子骗进了点球，如果他成功了…如果他成功了，我们就输了。
It means that the Brauner kid just cheated his way into a penalty kick, and if he makes it... if he makes it, we lose.

94
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,758
加油,裁判!
Come on, ref!

95
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:00,129
是的…!
Yeah...!

96
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,199
哦,不……
Oh, no...

97
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:12,375
想得美，霍普金斯，但很明显你们太差劲了。
Oh, nice try, Hopkins, but it's pretty obvious you guys suck.

98
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,682
但我记得你说过如果我认真祈祷，我们会赢的。
But I thought you said if I prayed really hard, we would win.

99
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,718
不，我没那么说，亲爱的。
No, I didn't say that, honey.

100
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:25,855
我是说如果你认真祈祷，他可能会帮助你。
I said that if you prayed really hard, He might help.

101
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,289
他做到了，亲爱的。
And He did, honey.

102
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,891
丹尼得分。
Danny scored.

103
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,659
是的，但他们还是输了，爷爷。
Yeah, but they still lost, Grampa.

104
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:33,528
难道上帝不想让我们赢吗?
Didn't God want us to win?

105
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,999
上帝是如何运作的是个谜。
You know, how God works is a mystery.

106
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:43,205
我相信他听到了你的祈祷并回应了你，但也许丹尼的球队输了是有原因的。
I'm sure He heard your prayers and He answered 'em, but maybe there was a reason that Danny's team lost.

107
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,308
比赢一场比赛更重要的理由?
You know, like a reason more important than just winning a game?

108
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:49,211
好吧。
Okay.

109
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,781
我要去告诉丹尼他做得很好。
Well, I'm gonna go tell Danny that he did great anyway.

110
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:54,517
-想去吗，辛迪?——确定。
- Wanna go, Cindy? - Sure.

111
00:07:56,986 --> 00:08:00,689
——好吧. .-好吧…完事后我们还去你家吗，爸爸?
- Well.. - Okay... Well, are we still going over to your place after, Dad?

112
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,925
是的。我应该带孩子去吗?
Yeah. Should I take the kids?

113
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:07,963
谢谢，但我确定莎拉想和辛迪和丹尼一起去，这样她们就能一路跳舞了。
Oh, thanks, but I'm sure that Sara's gonna wanna go with Cindy and Danny, so they can dance their way up.

114
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,865
你能在车里这么做吗?
You can do that in a car?

115
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,269
不要问。
Don't ask.

伟大的……哦,赛迪!

Well, you can have her if you feed her.

134
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,325
莎蒂吃得太多了。
Mm, Sadie eats too much.

135
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,960
我们负担不起。
We couldn't afford it.

136
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,529
我怎么没想到呢?
Why didn't I think of that?

137
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:15,631
丹尼，你打得很好，我为你骄傲。
Danny, you played a great game and I'm proud of you.

138
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,866
你在干什么?
You doing okay?

139
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,267
是的,我很好。
Yeah, I'm fine.

140
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,137
我只是…真不敢相信阿尔维·布劳纳用一个下流球赢了比赛。
I just... can't believe that Alvie Brauner won the game off a cheap shot.

141
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,272
-裁判所要做的就是…-丹尼，别这样。
- All the ref had to do was... - Danny, come on.

142
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,907
你说过你不会说的。
You said you weren't gonna talk about it.

143
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,409
你打得很好，亲爱的，那些家伙都是混蛋。
You played great, honey, and those guys were jerks.

144
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,845
甚至都不担心。
Not even worried about it.

145
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:33,983
走,斗犬!
Go, Pitbulls!

146
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,417
漂亮的照片。
Nice shot.

147
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,652
作秀。
Showoff.

148
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,521
那只是因为我知道你爱它。
It's only 'cause I know you love it.

149
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:41,323
打得不错，丹尼。
Hey, that was a nice game, Danny.

150
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,491
谢谢你,爷爷。
Thanks, Grampa.

151
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:43,659
我们可以去湖边吗?
Can we go to the lake?

152
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:49,498
哇……我刚在游戏里跑了一个半小时，现在你要我徒步去那儿?
Whoa... I just ran in the game for an hour and a half, and now you want me to hike up there?

153
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,101
辛迪想去。
Cindy wants to go.

154
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:55,171
是的，我想去。
Yeah, I wanna go.

155
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,172
看看这个。
Look at that.

156
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,642
有这两个人在身边，一个人是没有机会的。
A guy doesn't stand a chance with these two around.

157
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,242
你学习。
You're learning.

158
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,710
来吧。
Come on.

159
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,512
我今天要钓很多鱼。
I'm gonna catch a lot of fish today.

160
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,947
——是吗?-是的，我想是的。
- Yeah? - Yeah, I think so.

161
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,519
我把我的幸运杆带出来了，所以…-哦…-上次你带了钢管，我钓到的比你和爷爷钓到的还多。
I brought my lucky pole out here, so... - Oh... - You brought that pole last time, and I caught more than you and Grampa.

162
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,894
好吧，你是想坐树林里爷爷的座位还是想坐中间这个位置?
Okay, well, you want Grampa's seat in the grove or you want to try this spot in the middle?

163
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,665
等等，你是说我们不一起钓鱼了?
Wait, you mean we're not gonna fish together?

164
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:26,335
嗯…不，我想和辛迪单独碰碰运气。
Uh... no, I thought that Cindy and I would try our luck alone.

165
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:29,038
人少了，鱼多了?
You know, less people, more fish?

166
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,541
爷爷让你盯着我。
Grampa told you to keep an eye on me.

167
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:34,710
我应该盯着你们俩的。
I should be keeping an eye on you two.

168
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:40,115
你们俩要接吻吗?
Are you two gonna kiss?

169
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,717
你觉得我们应该吗?
You think we should?

170
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:50,025
等等!
Wait!

171
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:59,101
哦，不，可怜的孩子。
Oh, no, the poor thing.

172
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,004
我想知道发生了什么事?
I wonder what happened?

173
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,139
我觉得你不该碰它，莎拉。
I, I don't think you should be touching it, Sara.

174
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:05,474
没关系。
It's okay.

175
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,109
它看起来不脏。
It doesn't look dirty.

176
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:09,613
上面没有窃听器什么的。
There's no bugs on it or anything.

177
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,715
它死了。
It's dead.

178
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:12,781
你想把它埋了?
You want to bury it?

179
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,283
不。
No.

180
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,052
它可能还没死。
It might not be dead.

181
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:23,693
它的心脏停止跳动了，莎拉，而且感觉很冷。
It's heart isn't beating, Sara, and it feels cold.

182
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,928
它死了。
It's dead.

183
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,865
也许如果我们祈祷，他就会复活。
Maybe if we pray, he'll come back to life.

184
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,967
莎拉，那只鸟死了。
Sara, the bird is dead.

185
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,637
什么也不能使他复活。
Nothing can bring him back.

186
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,607
拉撒路死了四天，耶稣把他救活了。
Lazarus was dead for four days and Jesus brought him back to life.

187
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:41,510
但是…耶稣不在这里，而且……那只鸟也不是拉撒路。
But... Jesus isn't here and... the bird isn't Lazarus.

188
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:43,178
上帝永远在这里。
God is always here.

189
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:46,081
嗯…我没看见他。
Well... I don't see Him.

190
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:49,586
但我们必须对奇迹有信心。
But we have to have faith in miracles.

191
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,390
你能给她讲讲道理吗?
Will you talk some sense into her?

192
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,760
也许我们应该放过她。
Maybe we should leave her alone.

193
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:00,462
你要有点信心，让她祈祷。
Have a little faith and let her pray.

194
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:04,701
好吧，但她搬那些树的运气跟她把那只鸟带回来的运气差不多。
Okay, but she's gonna have about as much luck moving those trees as she will bringing that bird back.

195
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,869
这是不可能的。
It's not gonna happen.

196
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:09,673
莎拉。
Sara.

197
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:14,376
鸟的事我很抱歉，但是…死亡是生命的一部分。
Sorry about the bird but... death is a part of life.

198
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,246
你想怎么度过这一天都行，莎拉。
You can spend the day any way you want, Sara.

199
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,515
如果你需要我们，我们就在雪松那边。
We'll be over at the cedars if you need us.

200
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:22,117
来吧。
Come on.

201
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:37,333
神……你创造了这个可怜的小家伙，所以也许你可以帮他。
God... You made this poor little guy, so maybe You can help him out.

202
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,670
他的家人可能想他了，你觉得呢?
His family's probably missing him, don't You think?

203
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:44,674
你不会想让他们伤心的，对吧?
You wouldn't want them to be sad, would You?

204
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:49,646
请把他带回来。
Please bring him back.

205
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:56,452
我们在天上的父，愿你被尊为圣…
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be...

206
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,501
不坏。
Not bad.

207
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:16,105
应该留我们吃晚饭。
Should hold us for dinner.

208
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:19,875
都准备好了吗?
All set?

209
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,343
好了，我们走吧。
All right, let's go.

210
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:32,187
嘿，你钓到什么了吗?
Hey, did you catch anything?

211
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:36,892
快点，莎拉，我们得走了。
Come on, Sara, we have to go.

212
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,061
听着，我提出要帮你埋了它。
Look, I offered to help you bury it.

213
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,864
来吧,萨拉。
Come on, Sara.

214
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:42,431
如果你晚餐迟到了，你妈妈会不高兴的。
Your mom's not gonna like it if you're late for dinner.

215
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,567
你看见他了吗?
Do you see Him?

216
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,936
谁?
Who?

217
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,707
神。
God.

218
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,040
你看见他了吗?
Do you see Him?

219
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,780
别这样，莎拉，这一点也不好笑。
Come on, Sara, that's not funny.

220
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,414
在那里。
There.

221
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,751
告诉我他在哪里。
Show me where He is.

222
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,919
你没看见他吗?
You don't see Him?

223
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,455
他漂浮在水面上。
He's floating over the water.

224
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,126
莎拉，我们得走了。
Sara, we have to go.

225
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:26,575
你看到了吗?
Did you see that?

226
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,145
也许……是风把它吵醒的吗?
Maybe... the wind woke it up?

227
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,147
风吗?
The wind?

228
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,283
它没有心跳，而且很冷。
It didn't have a heartbeat and it was cold.

229
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,386
上帝让它复活了。
God brought it back to life.

230
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:43,358
来吧，伙计们，辛迪说得对，我们得走了。
Come on, guys, Cindy's right, we gotta go.

231
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:46,663
我们不想让妈妈生我们的气。
We don't want Mom to get mad at us.

232
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,716
我能帮忙吗?
Can I help?

233
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,485
你确定可以。
You sure can.

234
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,621
你钓到鱼了吗?
You catch any fish?

235
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,121
不。
No.

236
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:18,494
你最好叫你妈妈从冰箱里拿些肉放到微波炉里。
Oh, well, you better tell your mother to take some meat out of the freezer and put it in the microwave.

237
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:19,963
我们不需要。
We don't have to.

238
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,965
丹尼和辛迪抓到了一些。
Danny and Cindy caught some.

239
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,666
和你没有?
And you didn't?

240
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,167
这不像你的作风。
That doesn't sound like you.

241
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,002
我们发现了一只死鸟。
We found a dead bird.

242
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,303
哦,好!我们要吃那个吗?
Oh, good! Are we gonna eat that?

243
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:31,173
不,爷爷。
No, Grampa.

244
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,878
我给了他自由。
I set him free.

245
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,182
亲爱的……如果他死了，他就永远不会再有自由了。
Honey... If he was dead, he's as free as he's ever gonna be.

246
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,318
我放他走的时候他还活着。
He was alive when I let him go.

247
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:45,889
我一定是老了，亲爱的。
Well, I must be getting old, dear.

248
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,323
你不是告诉我他已经死了吗?
Didn't you tell me he was dead?

249
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:51,594
然后他就复活了?
And then he came back to life?

250
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:54,664
当我找到那只鸟时，我祈祷着。
When I found the bird, I prayed.

251
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,532
就像你在足球比赛时让我做的那样?
Like you told me to do at the soccer game?

252
00:15:56,666 --> 00:16:04,206
——嗯。-然后…我看见上帝站在湖的另一边，鸟儿拍打着翅膀，我就把他放了。
- Uh-huh. - But then... I saw God standing on the other side of the lake, and the bird flapped his wings and I let him go.

253
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:11,513
嗯…我一直觉得那个地方很特别，亲爱的…我一直觉得你很特别
Well... I always thought that place was special, honey... and I always thought you were kinda special.

254
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:14,049
你祈祷了多久?
How, how long were you praying?

255
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,618
只要我们在上面。
As long as we were up there.

256
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,987
你一直都在跪着吗?
You were on your knees the whole time?

257
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,023
是的。
Yup.

258
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:22,057
莎拉，你是个很棒的小女孩。
Sara, you're an amazing little girl.

259
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,559
你告诉你妈妈了吗?
Did you tell your mother?

260
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,093
是的。
Yeah.

261
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:26,896
是吗?她怎么说的?
Yeah? What'd she say?

262
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,933
她说:“那很好，亲爱的。”
She said, "That's nice, honey."

263
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:33,201
她可能没听见。
She probably didn't hear me.

264
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:34,837
反正她也不会相信我的。
She wouldn't have believed me anyway.

265
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:37,472
你知道，我能理解。
You know, I can understand that.

266
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:41,678
也许接下来的一段时间你应该把这事保密。
Maybe you just ought to keep this between us for the next little while.

267
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,913
不是每个人都像我这么聪明。
Not everybody's as smart as I am.

268
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,583
他们可能认为是你瞎编的。
They might think you just made it up.

269
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,084
但我说的是实话。
But I'm telling the truth.

270
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,420
丹尼和辛迪看到它复活了。
Danny and Cindy saw it come back to life.

271
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,723
他们做了,是吗?
They did, huh?

272
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:57,026
嗯…我相信你，亲爱的。
Well... I believe you, hon.

273
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,728
你下周末回来吗?
Are you coming back next weekend?

274
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,630
-我想。——嗯。
- I want to. - Uh-huh.

275
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:03,066
我会和你妈妈谈谈的。
I'll talk to your mama.

276
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,136
爷爷……你还会再结婚吗?
Grampa... are you ever gonna get married again?

277
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,472
哦,亲爱的。
Oh, dear.

278
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:17,080
亲爱的，上帝把你奶奶给了我，她容忍我比我应得的要多。
Honey, the Lord gave me your grandma, and she put up with me more than I deserved.

279
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:19,983
我不会推动这个问题。
I'm not gonna push the issue.

280
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:21,985
作为一个爷爷，你看起来很年轻。
You look young for a grampa.

281
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:26,756
是啊，你看起来真可爱，让我的心像小兔子一样跳。
Yeah, and you look so cute, you make my heart hop like a little bunny.

282
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:28,190
不是真的。
Not really.

283
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,592
是的,真的。
Yes, really.

284
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:30,760
你知道吗?
You know what?

285
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:34,496
今天……我爱你这么多。
Today... I love you this much.

286
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,165
你爱我不止这些。
You love me more than that.

287
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,102
也许那么多。
Maybe that much.

288
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:45,173
我爱你就这么多，甚至更多。
Well, I love you this much, and even more.

289
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:51,346
嗯…你等晚饭，我从你盘子里偷点你妈妈做的红薯。
Well... you wait till dinner, when I steal some of your mama's sweet potatoes off your plate.

290
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,116
看看你有多爱我。
See how much you love me then.

291
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,795
喂?
Hello?

292
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:06,929
嘿。
Hey.

293
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:09,431
你在用谁的电话?
Whose phone are you using?

294
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:11,566
我借了我哥哥的。
I borrowed my brother's.

295
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,802
借来的?
Borrowed?

296
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:15,504
嗯，差不多是这样。
Well, something like that.

297
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,874
好吧，今天在湖边发生了一件最酷的事。
Okay, so, the coolest thing happened at the lake today.

298
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,976
是的,像什么?
Yeah, like what?

299
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,945
我和丹尼还有辛迪去钓鱼了。
Me and Danny and Cindy went fishing.

300
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,312
嗯,他们做的。
Well, they did.

301
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,650
我没有,因为…我发现一只死鸟。
I didn't, because... I found a dead bird.

302
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:33,555
然后我祈祷……然后我看到了上帝，他让鸟儿复活了。
And then I prayed... and then I saw God, and He brought the bird back to life.

303
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,991
什么?
What?

304
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:36,491
这是真的，马克。
It really happened, Mark.

305
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:38,293
好吧，让我把话说清楚。
Okay, so, let me get this straight.

306
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:42,865
你见到了上帝，然后让一只死鸟复活。
You saw God and then brought a dead bird... back to life.

307
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,433
不,我没有。上帝所做的。
No, I didn't. God did.

308
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,269
来吧……你在耍我。
Come on... you're playing with me.

309
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:48,771
我不,马克。
I'm not, Mark.

310
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:51,239
我告诉你是因为你是我最好的朋友。
I'm telling you because you're my best friend.

311
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:54,877
好吧，如果你看到了上帝，那他长什么样?
Okay, so, if you saw God, then what did He look like?

312
00:18:55,011 --> 00:19:00,282
一开始他被一个巨大的光球包围着，所以他有点看不清。
He was surrounded by a large ball of light at first, so He was kinda hard to see.

313
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:06,823
但接着他从光亮中走了出来，看上去又年轻又善良。
But then He stepped out of the light and... He looked young and... kind.

314
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:09,324
但我觉得他穿的是t恤和牛仔裤。
But I think He was wearing a t-shirt and jeans.

315
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,693
来吧。
Come on.

316
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:12,929
上帝不会穿t恤和牛仔裤。
God doesn't wear t-shirts and jeans.

317
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:14,063
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

318
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,430
你见过他吗?
Have you ever seen Him?

319
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:16,766
不。
No.

320
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:21,904
它是上帝…他确实让那只鸟复活了。
It was God... and He did bring that bird back to life.

321
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:25,507
丹尼和辛迪目睹了这一切，但他们都不相信。
Danny and Cindy saw it happen, and they don't even believe it.

322
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:35,151
他们在吃饭的时候告诉妈妈…那可能是水面上的某种奇怪的倒影，或者那只鸟可能昏迷了或生病了……但没有死。
They told Mom at dinner... that it was probably some weird reflection on the water, or that the bird was probably stunned or sick... but not dead.

323
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,452
嗯…也许他们是对的。
Well... maybe they're right.

324
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,756
马克…我保证!
Mark... I promise!

325
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,389
上帝在那里。
God was there.

326
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:42,725
真的吗?
Really?

327
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,761
我对圣经发誓。
I swear on the Bible itself.

328
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:46,696
哇!
Whoa!

329
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,765
这太棒了!
This is so awesome!

330
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:51,466
呃,我,我…相信你!
Uh, I, I... believe you!

331
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,202
这是发生了什么事。
That's what happened.

332
00:19:53,335 --> 00:20:01,510
嗯…但是…我不会告诉任何人，因为人们会认为我疯了，而且…嗯,要走了。
Um... but... I wouldn't tell anyone, because people will just think I'm crazy, and... Uh, gotta go.

333
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:02,745
明天见。
I'll see you tomorrow.

334
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,580
好吧。
All right.

335
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,950
嗨,蜂蜜。
Hi, honey.

336
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,484
你刷牙并用牙线了吗?
Did you brush your teeth and floss?

337
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,087
确定了。
Sure did.

338
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,655
好东西。
Good stuff.

339
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,860
好吧。
Okay.

340
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,495
这是我一天中最喜欢的部分。
This is my favorite part of the day.

341
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:28,604
好了，你闭上眼睛然后想想今天发生的所有让你感激的事。
All right, so, you're gonna close your eyes and then you're gonna think about all the things that you're grateful for that happened today.

342
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,140
妈妈?
Mom?

343
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:33,709
是的,甜心?
Yes, sweetheart?

344
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:37,613
那只鸟在湖边果然复活了。
That bird really did come back to life at the lake.

345
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:40,583
就在我见到上帝之后。
It was right after I saw God.

346
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:44,654
这不是什么奇怪的映像或类似的东西，不是。
It wasn't some weird reflection or anything like that, no.

347
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:50,660
真的是上帝，他对我说话。
It really was God, and He spoke to me.

348
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,795
他说了什么?
What did He say?

349
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,631
他说他很快就会带我去天堂。
He said He'll be taking me to Heaven soon.

350
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:04,841
蜂蜜……你必须死才能上天堂。
Honey... You have to die to go to Heaven.

351
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:09,344
我不想死，但是…我想去天堂。
I don't wanna die, but... I wanna go to Heaven.

352
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:14,549
在很长一段时间内我都不打算让你去任何地方，好吗?
Well, I don't intend on letting you go anywhere for a very long time, okay?

353
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:20,590
你有很多时间去天堂，当你最终去天堂的时候，你会变成一个很老很老的女人。
You have a lot of time to get to Heaven, and when you finally go there, you're gonna be an old, old, old, old lady.

354
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:22,091
比我大得多。
Much older than me.

355
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:24,392
好吧?
Okay?

356
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:27,296
不要再谈论死亡。
No more talk about dying.

357
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:29,866
好了，你得睡会儿了。
All right, you gotta get some sleep.

358
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,234
你早上还要上学，好吗?
You have school in the morning, okay?

359
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:32,235
所以祈祷吧。
So say your prayers.

360
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,769
好吧。
Okay.

361
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:37,273
下个周末我能回爷爷家吗?
Can I got back to Grampa's next weekend?

362
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:41,010
除非你不再让你的想象力占了上风。
Only if you stop letting your imagination get the better of you.

363
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:42,510
好吧?
Okay?

364
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:46,849
——爱你。——爱你。
- Love you. - Love you.

365
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:49,151
做个好梦,宝贝。
Sweet dreams, baby.

366
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,872
妈妈,爸爸。
Mom, Dad.

367
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:12,108
嘿，伙计，一切都好吗?
Hey, buddy, is everything okay?

368
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:15,678
我去莎拉的房间看她有没有拿我的手机，她看起来病得很厉害。你一定要来。
I went to Sara's room to see if she had my phone, and she looks really sick. You need to come.

369
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,545
——怎么生病的?-我不知道
- How sick? - I don't know.

370
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,181
她浑身是汗，呼吸困难。
She's covered in sweat and breathing pretty hard.

371
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,482
还不是很好。
It's not good.

372
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,399
——嘿,本。-嗨。
- Hey, Ben. - Hey.

373
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:37,967
-谢谢你这么晚才来。——不,不。
- Thanks for coming out so late. - No, no.

374
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,835
没问题，我明白。
No problem, I get it.

375
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:44,707
本，真高兴你能来。
Oh, Ben, I'm so happy that you're here.

376
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,543
她一直在发高烧，现在她说她感到恶心。
She's been running a really high fever, and now she says that she's nauseous.

377
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:49,979
好吧，让我看看。
All right, uh, let me take a look.

378
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,315
你好,萨拉。
Hi, Sara.

379
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,450
你能告诉我你现在感觉如何吗?
Can you tell me how you're feeling right now?

380
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,953
-不太好。
- Not so good. - Mm.

381
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,322
我感觉很不舒服，好像要吐了。
I feel really sick, like I'm gonna throw up.

382
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:00,790
你不担心。
Don't you worry.

383
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:04,160
我们会治好你的，莎拉。
We're gonna fix you right up, Sara.

384
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:05,493
我想她是肠胃感冒了。
I think she has a stomach flu.

385
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,363
呃，它正在传播。
Uh, it's going around.

386
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,265
明天别让她回家，多给她补充水分。
Just keep her home tomorrow and keep her hydrated.

387
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:11,634
谢谢,我们将。
Thanks, we will.

388
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,904
只是她说的话吓到我了。
It's just that something she said scared me.

389
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:18,240
那是什么?
What was that?

390
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:21,577
说吧，告诉他。
Go ahead, tell him.

391
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:31,253
我们去湖边看爸爸的时候，她说她看到了上帝……他让一只死鸟复活。
When we visited my dad at the lake, she said she saw God... and that He brought a dead bird back to life.

392
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:36,025
在我听来她的想象力很丰富
Well, that, that just sounds like she has a healthy imagination to me.

393
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:41,563
但后来她说上帝对她说话了……他告诉她他很快就会带她去天堂。
But then she said that God spoke to her... and He told her He was gonna be taking her to Heaven soon.

394
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,701
她会没事的。
She's gonna be fine.

395
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:47,535
好吧?她比我们都健康
All right? She's healthier than all of us.

396
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,871
没什么可担心的。
It's nothing to worry about.

397
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:51,207
会没事的。
It's gonna be okay.

398
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,043
-本，谢谢你能来-好的，没问题。
- Ben, thanks for coming out. - All right, no problem.

399
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:57,146
还有，如果她病情加重，体温上升，打电话给我办公室。
Oh, and, you know, if she gets worse, her temperature rises, just call my office.

400
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,682
——会做。——谢谢。
- Will do. - Thank you.

401
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,287
嘿,花生。
Hey, peanut.

402
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,989
你感觉好些了吗?
You feeling any better?

403
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:08,724
我想是的。
I think so.

404
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:11,027
好吧，你去睡会儿。
Well, you get some sleep.

405
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,597
我肯定你会觉得……哦……对不起。
I'm sure you'll feel... Oh... sorry.

406
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:21,837
你从哪儿弄来的?
Where'd you get this?

407
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:24,807
我今晚回家的时候画的。
I drew it when I came home tonight.

408
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,010
-你画的?-是的。
- You drew this? - Yeah.

409
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:31,580
我用爷爷圣诞节送给我的画盒画的。
I drew it with the drawing kit Grampa gave me for Christmas.

410
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:33,315
嗯。
Huh.

411
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:37,253
嗯。
Huh.

412
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:43,959
莎拉，我从没见过你做这种事。
Sara, I, I've never seen you do anything like this before.

413
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:45,461
你从哪学来的?
Where'd you learn to do this?

414
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:46,929
我不知道。
I don't know.

415
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:50,232
我只是想把我在湖边看到的东西拍下来。
I just felt like trying to make a picture of what I saw at the lake.

416
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:54,537
莎拉，这不是努力，这…这是难以置信的。
Sara, this isn't trying, this... this is incredible.

417
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,739
——谢谢。-我能把这个给你妈妈看吗?
- Thanks. - Can I show this to your mom?

418
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,107
确定。
Sure.

419
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:03,712
好吧,嗯…明天你得待在家里，好好睡一觉。
Okay, well... we're gonna keep you home tomorrow, so you get some sleep.

420
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,449
和我…答应我把它还给你，好吗?
And I... promise to return it, okay?

421
00:25:06,582 --> 00:25:08,184
晚安,爸爸。
Good night, Dad.

422
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:09,285
亲爱的,晚上。
Night, sweetheart.

423
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:31,340
这是谁干的?
Who did this?

424
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:34,477
你的女儿做的。
Your daughter did.

425
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,047
不…她不可能。
No... she couldn't have.

426
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,915
但是她做到了。
But she did.

427
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,962
你昨天的课上什么都没错过。
You didn't really miss anything in class yesterday.

428
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:56,966
还是老样子，幸运的是，也没有数学测验。
You know, same old stuff, and, luckily, no math quiz either.

429
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,503
我感觉很好，但是我妈妈想让我整天躺在床上。
I felt fine, but my mom wanted to keep me in bed all day.

430
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,873
所以…我…吸引了你。
So... I... drew you something.

431
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:05,609
哦，是吗，比如说?
Oh, yeah, like what?

432
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,613
莎拉!
Sara!

433
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:11,747
你画的吗?
You drew this?

434
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:13,949
这是难以置信的!
This is unbelievable!

435
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,819
我们的美术老师永远画不出这样一幅画。
Our art teacher could never pull off a drawing like this.

436
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,054
-你怎么做到的?-我不知道
- How'd you do it? - I don't know.

437
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,857
我想我找到了自己的强项。
I guess I just found something I'm good at.

438
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:31,167
——哦,男人。-这些傻瓜来了。
- Oh, man. - Here are these fools.

439
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:34,403
嘿,莎拉。
Hey, Sara.

440
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:35,671
我的猫上星期死了。
My cat died last week.

441
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,274
我在想你能不能过来把他救活。
I was wondering if you could stop by and bring him back to life.

442
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:40,610
我的青蛙昨晚死了。
My frog died last night.

443
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:42,011
你能把他也带回来吗?
Could you bring him back too?

444
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:45,314
-哦，真可悲。-我记得我告诉过你不要告诉任何人在湖边发生的事。
- Oh, so pathetic. - I thought I told you not to tell anyone about what happened at the lake.

445
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:47,049
哦，我有一条金鱼!
Oh, and I have a goldfish!

446
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:50,186
也许你可以把水变成酒，我们可以把鱼喝个烂醉。
Maybe if you changed some water into wine, we could get the fish really drunk.

447
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,754
那太棒了。
That would be awesome.

448
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:56,325
没人敢惹我妹妹…没有一个人。
No one messes with my little sister... no one.

449
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,993
真是个怪人。
What a weirdo.

450
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,368
你父母没告诉过你不要欺负女孩子吗?
Didn't your parents ever tell you not to pick on girls?

451
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,871
显然不是。
Obviously not.

452
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:17,581
我们不是一直被教导如果有人冤枉了你，就别打他的脸吗?
Weren't we always taught that if someone wrongs you, to turn the other cheek?

453
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:20,684
嗯…他们肯定学过一些关于脸颊的知识。
Well... they were certainly taught something about a cheek.

454
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,952
也许那个人能告诉你更多。
Maybe that guy could tell you more about it.

455
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:33,429
搞什么，伙计?
What the hell, man?

456
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,613
哦……我得到这个。
Oh... I got this.

457
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:55,619
好,好,好……这不是准足球英雄吗。
Well, well, well... if it isn't the would-be soccer hero.

458
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:57,553
怎么了，孩子?
What's the matter, boy?

459
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:00,756
你还在为你那天那可悲的游戏赎罪吗?
You still trying to make up for your pathetic game the other day?

460
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,759
哇，你的狗真漂亮。
Wow, your dog is really pretty.

461
00:28:06,262 --> 00:28:07,796
离他远点，莎拉。
Stay away from him, Sara.

462
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,466
这只狗可能和它的主人一样兴奋。
The dog's probably just as jacked up as his master.

463
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,800
在这里。
Here.

464
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,908
那你现在打算怎么办，霍普金斯?
And what are you gonna do now, Hopkins?

465
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,844
叫犯规?
Call a foul?

466
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:23,846
来吧，丹尼，我们离开这里。
Come on, Danny, let's get outta here.

467
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:26,650
我敢肯定街对面的空气更新鲜。
I'm sure the air is fresher on the other side of the street.

468
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:32,421
没错，霍普金斯，逃跑就行了。
Yeah, that's right, Hopkins, just run away.

469
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:36,292
就躲在你女朋友和你妹妹的裙子后面吧!
Just keep hiding behind the skirts of your girlfriend and your little sister!

470
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:44,768
快跑吧，霍普金斯!
Just run away, Hopkins!

471
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,503
你和那个瘸子!
You and that crippled kid too!

472
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:49,405
你知道吗?
You know what?

473
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:52,141
应该有人教你闭上你的嘴，布劳纳。
Somebody ought to teach you to keep your mouth shut, Brauner.

474
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,376
是谁呢?
And who would that be?

475
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,946
Alvie,当心!
Alvie, look out!

476
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:05,287
老兄，你是怎么了?!
Man, what's the matter with you?!

477
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:06,955
你差点杀了我，傻瓜!
You almost took me out, fool!

478
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,824
你为什么不看路?!
Why weren't you watching the road?!

479
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,392
你疯了吗?
Are you outta your mind?

480
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:23,372
哦,不……不…不不不不不…诺比，起来，伙计。
Oh, no... no... No, no, no, no, no... Nobby, get up, man.

481
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:24,473
起床,华丽的。
Get up, Nobby.

482
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,342
起床了。
Get up.

483
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,147
你杀了我的狗，伙计。
You killed my dog, man.

484
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,718
-你杀了我的狗。-阿瓦，等等!
- You killed my dog, man. - Alvie, hold up!

485
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,984
-那是个意外。-我要打烂你的头!
- It was an accident. - I'm gonna break your head!

486
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:37,553
冷静，伙计，退后。
Calm down, man, back off.

487
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:39,021
那只狗是我最好的朋友，而你杀了它。
That dog was my best friend, and you killed him.

488
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,022
-拜托，伙计…-就这样，伙计。
- Come on, man... - That's it, man.

489
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,591
我要杀了你。
I'm gonna finish you.

490
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:43,025
你这么做什么也帮不上忙。
You're not gonna help anything by doing this.

491
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,194
告诉她别碰我的狗。
Hey, tell her to keep her hands off my dog.

492
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,930
-来吧…——不。
- Come on... - Don't.

493
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:52,534
亲爱的上帝……你在湖边救了那只小鸟。
Dear God... You helped that little bird at the lake.

494
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:55,839
你能帮帮这只可怜的狗吗?
Can you please help this poor dog too?

495
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:04,647
我们的父亲……谁在天堂…愿人尊你的名为圣……
Our Father... who art in Heaven... hallowed be Thy name...

496
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:29,571
继续。
Go on.

497
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:49,525
然后……当他开始呼吸的时候，我简直不敢相信。
And then... when he just started breathing, I just couldn't believe it.

498
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:53,630
我是说，我从没见过那样的事。
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

499
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:57,600
莎拉…我能问你点事吗?
Sara... can I ask you something?

500
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:00,135
确定。
Sure.

501
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:02,938
你能帮我再走路吗?
Do you think you could help me walk again?

502
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,940
我不知道。
I don't know.

503
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,375
也许吧。
Maybe.

504
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:11,480
你能为我祈祷吗?
Could you say a prayer for me?

505
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:25,461
神……马克是个好人。
God... Mark's a good guy.

506
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:28,330
他确实是。
He really is.

507
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:31,701
也许你能帮他再走路?
Maybe You could help him walk again?

508
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:33,803
你能做到吗?
Could You do that, please?

509
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,948
我回家后也会为你祈祷更多。
I'll pray for you more when I get home too.

510
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,649
见到你,马克。
See you, Mark.

511
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:48,217
好的,谢谢。
Okay, thanks.

512
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,986
明天见。
See you tomorrow.

513
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:07,369
你把我从高尔夫比赛中带走了。
Hey, you took me away from my golf game.

514
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:09,973
所以…告诉我这次紧急医疗事件是怎么回事
So... tell me what this medical emergency is all about.

515
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:13,509
今天早上我动了脚趾。
I moved my toes this morning.

516
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:16,144
不，他真的说了，医生。
No, he really did, Doc.

517
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:17,914
哪个脚?
Which foot?

518
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:19,314
两个!
Both!

519
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:24,453
给我看。
Show me.

520
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:28,156
准备好了吗?
Ready?

521
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:39,201
马克,嗯…我，我不知道……发生了什么，但你的脊髓损伤不是…等等!
Mark, uh... I, I don't know... what happened, but your spinal cord injury isn't... Wait!

522
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,403
只是…给我个机会。
Just... give me a chance.

523
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,874
请。
Please.

524
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:10,065
你能移动另一只脚吗?
Can, can you move the other foot?

525
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:30,218
给你。
Here you go.

526
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:31,420
谢谢你,医生。
Thanks, Doc.

527
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:36,458
所以,听……医生，你真的认为他有机会，对吗?
So, listen... Doc, you really think he's got a chance, right?

528
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:47,235
你看,我,我…我无法解释刚才发生了什么…但是…脊髓里被切断的神经无法再生，我只是，我只是不想让你抱太大希望。
Look, I, I... I can't explain what, what happened in there... but... severed nerves in spinal cord can't regenerate, and I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up too much.

529
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:49,237
哦,嘿,本。
Oh, hey, Ben.

530
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:53,141
嘿,不是……那是12频道的德洛丽丝·克拉克，对吧?
Hey, isn't... that's Dolores Clark from Channel 12 News, right?

531
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,444
是的，她是，她是我的病人之一。
Yes, she's, uh, she's one of my patients.

532
00:33:57,614 --> 00:34:00,315
妈妈?
Mom?

533
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:04,921
哦,我的宝贝!
Oh, my baby!

534
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:09,993
你……步行和…他的地位!
You're... walking and... He's standing!

535
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,261
他在走路，看他!
He's walking, look at him!

536
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:15,064
这是一个奇迹!
It's a miracle!

537
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,802
哦,我的……哦,我的宝贝。
Oh, my... Oh, my baby.

538
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,604
那不是那个叫米勒的男孩吗?
Isn't that the Miller boy?

539
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:24,373
去年他被那辆车撞的时候我做过关于他的报道。
I did the story on him last year when he was hit by that car.

540
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:25,842
我以为他再也不能走路了。
I thought he was never supposed to walk again.

541
00:34:27,677 --> 00:34:30,813
他,他不是。
He, he wasn't.

542
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:34,584
是，是莎拉。
It, it was Sara.

543
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,954
莎拉霍普金斯。
Sara Hopkins.

544
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:47,697
她能和上帝说话，她救活了一只鸟，还有阿尔维·布劳纳的狗，现在……她治好了我!
She speaks with God, she brought a bird back to life, and Alvie Brauner's dog, and now... she's healed me!

545
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:52,969
嗯,多洛雷斯……不要这样做!
Uh, Dolores... Don't do it!

546
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:54,704
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me?

547
00:34:54,837 --> 00:34:58,340
一个能让死去的动物起死回生还能治愈截瘫孩子的小女孩?
A little girl who brings dead animals back to life and then heals a paraplegic kid?

548
00:34:58,473 --> 00:34:59,676
好像这不是新闻似的。
Like that's not news.

549
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,309
先弄清楚事实吧。
Just get the facts first.

550
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:03,579
好吧，我刚说了。
Well, I just did.

551
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,985
来吧……不!
Come on... no!

552
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:10,787
有你了。
Got you again.

553
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,954
嗨,伙计们。
Hi, guys.

554
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,891
看看谁来打声招呼了。
Look who came to say hi.

555
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:17,292
妈妈，你没必要叫医生。
Mom, you didn't have to call the doctor.

556
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:18,961
我告诉过你我感觉好多了。
I told you I was feeling better.

557
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:26,401
是的…我们是来谈另一件事的，莎拉，但为什么我没有…随便看看你，好吗?
Yeah... yeah, we're here on another matter, Sara, but why don't I have a... quick look at you anyway, okay?

558
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:27,670
你感觉如何?
How do you feel?

559
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:29,438
——现在。——嗯。
- Okay now. - Mm-hmm.

560
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:33,910
昨天我回家时头痛得厉害，一整天都很累。
Yesterday I came home with a terrible headache and I was tired all day.

561
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:36,478
也许你还是有点感冒
Well, maybe you still have a touch of the flu.

562
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:40,415
莎拉…你最后一次见到马克·米勒是什么时候?
Sara... when was the last time you saw Mark Miller?

563
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:41,718
昨天。
Yesterday.

564
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,820
我和他一起走回家。
I walked home with him.

565
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:45,722
你和马克发生什么事了吗?
Did anything happen with Mark?

566
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:48,191
有什么异常情况发生吗?
Anything unusual?

567
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:53,129
他让我为他祈祷，所以我闭上眼睛，祈求上帝治愈他。
Well, he asked me to pray for him, so I closed my eyes and I asked God to heal him.

568
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:57,967
马克·米勒今天走路了。
Mark Miller walked today.

569
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,534
真的吗?
Really?

570
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:03,371
太棒了，我的祈祷奏效了!
Awesome, my prayers worked!

571
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:05,608
是啊，看来他会完全康复的。
Yeah, seems like he's gonna make a full recovery.

572
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:10,179
你能跟我们说说那天在湖边发生的事吗?
Can you tell us a little more about what happened at the lake the other day?

573
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:11,881
确定。
Sure.

574
00:36:12,014 --> 00:36:15,051
我在为丹尼说已经死了的小鸟祈祷。
I was praying for a little bird that Danny said was dead.

575
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:21,456
但后来我看到上帝漂浮在湖面上我请他治好那只鸟，他做到了。
But then I saw God floating over the lake and I asked him to cure the bird, and He did.

576
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,458
你经常和上帝说话吗?
Do you speak to God often?

577
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:26,394
一直都是，不是吗?
All the time, don't you?

578
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:28,296
嗯…不直接。
Well... not directly.

579
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,734
即使在教堂也不行吗?
Not even in church?

580
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:39,041
听着，假装自己在和上帝对话对别人来说既不健康也不公平。
Look, um, it's, it's not healthy or fair to other people to pretend that you're actually having conversations with God.

581
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:41,409
我不是假装。
I'm not pretending.

582
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,813
好吧。
Okay.

583
00:36:43,946 --> 00:36:46,215
明天把她带到办公室来。
Bring her to the office tomorrow.

584
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:51,053
像她这样年纪的人，真的需要检查一下疲劳和头痛，好吗?
Fatigue and headaches with someone her age, uh, really need to be examined, okay?

585
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:54,023
你得跟她谈谈。
You need to talk to her.

586
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:59,862
我是说，关于治愈鸟儿和让瘫痪男孩重新行走的故事会让她的生活变成媒体的马戏团。
I mean, stories about healing birds and making paralyzed boys walk again is gonna turn her life into a media circus.

587
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:04,801
本，这些我都理解，但说真的，你对马克的康复有合理的解释吗?
Look, Ben, I understand all of that, but, seriously, do you have a logical explanation for Mark's recovery?

588
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:06,468
我可以向你保证有一个。
I can assure you there is one.

589
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,570
然而，目前我们还不知道这是什么。
However, at the moment, we have no idea what it is.

590
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:10,640
别再火上浇油了，杰瑞。
Don't be pouring fuel on the fire, Jerry.

591
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,407
我是说，莎拉不需要这个。
I mean, Sara doesn't need that.

592
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:17,079
听着，我不知道到底发生了什么，但我知道莎拉相信她告诉我们的一切。
Look, I, I don't know exactly what happened, but I do know Sara believes everything she's telling us.

593
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:20,583
我知道她的想象力很丰富，但她绝对不会撒谎。
Look, I know she has a very vivid imagination, but she would never outright lie.

594
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,084
她不会做那种事的。
She just wouldn't do something like that.

595
00:37:22,218 --> 00:37:25,788
这件事只有我们俩知道直到我们查清真相，好吗?
Let's, let's just keep this between us until we get to the bottom of it, okay?

596
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:30,325
现在我很担心她的健康
Right now, I'm worried about her health.

597
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:35,397
明天放学后见。
See you tomorrow after school.

598
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,175
嘿。
Hey.

599
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,679
你看到莎拉了吗?
Did you see Sara?

600
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:51,346
是的。
Yeah.

601
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,682
然后呢?
And?

602
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:59,055
她只是个小女孩，她讲的那些虚构的故事把人们都激怒了。
She's just a little girl, and she's got people all riled up with these make-believe stories she's been telling.

603
00:38:00,223 --> 00:38:02,325
我知道你生他的气。
I know you're mad at Him.

604
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:03,860
在谁?
At who?

605
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,161
神。
God.

606
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:07,495
哦,请。
Oh, please.

607
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,803
杰西也是我的儿子，本。
Jesse was my son too, Ben.

608
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:16,571
但我没你那么坚强。
But I'm not as strong as you are.

609
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:22,178
因为如果我不再相信上帝…那我就得相信我们的儿子已经不存在了
Because if I quit believing in God... then I have to believe that our son no longer exists.

610
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:24,814
我不能那么做。
I can't do that.

611
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:27,783
我没那么坚强。
I'm not that strong.

612
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,586
我觉得你也不是。
And I don't think you really are, either.

613
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,791
莎拉不需要你和其他人认为她是上帝的工具。
Sara doesn't need you and everyone else thinking that she's an instrument of God.

614
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:37,392
为什么不呢?
Why not?

615
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:42,698
一个有坚定信念的小女孩是我们大家都需要的。
A little girl with a strong faith is something that we could all use more of.

616
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:49,605
如果真有上帝，他会创造一个世界让父母们眼睁睁地看着自己的儿女死去吗?
If there really was a God, would He create a world where parents have to watch their sons and daughters die?

617
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:54,442
哦,太棒了。
Oh, great.

618
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,446
．..站起来走走。
...get up and walk.

619
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:03,619
他说，一个叫萨拉·霍普金斯的小女孩握着他的手，为他祈祷。
He said a little girl, Sara Hopkins, held his hands and prayed for him.

620
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:06,289
但她真的能通过祈祷治愈人们吗?
But can she really cure people by praying?

621
00:39:06,421 --> 00:39:08,958
恐怕这让我有点难以相信。
I'm afraid that's a bit hard for me to believe.

622
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:14,230
然而真正的问题是……你们每个人相信什么?
Yet the real question is... what do each of you believe?

623
00:39:14,363 --> 00:39:16,232
——嘿,老兄。-嗨。
- Hey, kiddo. - Hi.

624
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:17,532
你在做什么呢?
What you doing?

625
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:20,435
绘画。
Drawing.

626
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:24,307
是的…嗯。
Yeah... Huh.

627
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:29,812
嗯…是的,你是。
Uh... Yes, you are.

628
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:34,750
莎拉，亲爱的，看着我。
Sara, sweetheart, look at me.

629
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:36,819
是吗?
Yeah?

630
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:39,454
呃，是不是有什么…
Uh, is there something that...

631
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:45,493
不要紧。
Never mind.

632
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,096
告诉我你的照片。
Tell me about your picture.

633
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,732
你认识那个小男孩吗?
Do you know that little boy?

634
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,334
我不确定。
I'm not sure.

635
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:53,002
我突然想到的，你知道吗?
It just came to me, you know?

636
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:55,503
就像做梦一样。
Almost like a dream.

637
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:58,573
但我知道，那不是男孩。
But I do know that it's, it's not a boy.

638
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,676
——哦。-是个年轻女孩。
- Oh. - It's a young girl.

639
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,045
也许是我的学校。
Maybe from my school.

640
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,849
我觉得她想和我做朋友。
I think she wants to be friends with me.

641
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,620
是的…
Yeah...

642
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:25,601
特蕾莎……有人要见你。
Theresa... there's someone here to see you.

643
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:28,838
西德尼叔叔!
Uncle Alonzo!

644
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,876
我就在外面客厅里。
I'll just be out in the living room.

645
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,378
你们俩玩得开心。
You two have fun.

646
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:44,387
他有什么故事吗?
Is there a story that goes along with him too?

647
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,222
哦,你的赌注。
Oh, you bet.

648
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:51,160
现在,这个家伙…两次赢得全国越野障碍赛冠军
Now, this guy... won the Grand National Steeplechase twice.

649
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:59,035
他表现得太好了，他们不得不让他退休，但他说只有住在你家他才会退休。
He was so good, they had to ask him to retire, but he said he'd only do it if he could live at your house.

650
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,404
你的故事是最好的。
Your stories are the best.

651
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:10,279
我只希望能和他多待一会儿。
I just wish I'd be around long enough to play with him.

652
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:21,490
我听到医生告诉妈妈…我的癌症越来越严重了。
I heard the doctor telling Mom that... my cancer is getting worse.

653
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:29,031
他说……我没有多少时间。
He said... I don't have much time.

654
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,139
我会死吗?
Am I going to die?

655
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:41,811
你什么时候听说的?
When did you hear this?

656
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:43,946
今天在医院
At the hospital today.

657
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,816
如果你不高兴，我们就不用谈了。
We don't have to talk about it if it upsets you.

658
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:49,585
我们可以谈谈。
We can talk about it.

659
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:57,393
我只是不确定我死后会发生什么。
I'm just not sure what will happen to me when I die.

660
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:06,735
耶稣说……复活在我，生命也在我。
Jesus said... "I am the resurrection and the life.

661
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:16,979
“相信我的人……会活下来，即使他死了…凡活著信我的人…永远不会死的。”
"He who believes in Me... will live, even though he dies... and whoever lives and believes in Me... will never die."

662
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:23,552
我的灵魂会升入天堂吗?即使我真的害怕死亡?
Will my soul go to Heaven... even if I'm really scared of dying?

663
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:35,297
每个人都害怕死亡。
Everyone's afraid to die.

664
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:41,605
即使是最勇敢的人。
Even the bravest people.

665
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,141
是耶稣害怕吗?
Was Jesus afraid?

666
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,342
他是。
He was.

667
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:53,516
但耶稣因知道他必再活，就得了安慰。
But He was comforted by knowing that He would live again.

668
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:57,153
你也应该有同样的感觉。
And you should feel the same way too.

669
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:04,994
请继续关注我们关于莎拉·霍普金斯奇迹的最新消息。
So stay tuned as we keep you up to date on the miracles of Sara Hopkins.

670
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:06,762
现在回到弗兰克·麦克唐纳。
And now, back to Frank McDonald.

671
00:43:06,896 --> 00:43:07,897
谢谢,多洛雷斯。
Thanks, Dolores.

672
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:14,003
接下来是…这是可能的吗?
Coming up next after the... Is this possible?

673
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,205
霍普金斯家的小女孩真的能治愈人类吗?
Could the little Hopkins girl really be curing people?

674
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:22,478
如果这是上帝的旨意，一切皆有可能，但是…但是,西德尼?
Anything is possible if it's the will of God, but... But what, Alonzo?

675
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,547
-她没多少时间了。——我知道。
- She doesn't have much time. - I know.

676
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,552
但你很容易抱有希望，如果特蕾莎没有痊愈…?
But it's easy to get your hopes up, and then if Theresa isn't healed...?

677
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:32,988
我们得试试。
We have to try.

678
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:36,058
我们得带特蕾莎去见莎拉·霍普金斯。
We have to take Theresa to see Sara Hopkins.

679
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,767
她在这里!莎拉的。
She's here! Sara's in there.

680
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,002
她会帮我们的。她会治愈我们的。
She's gonna help us. She's gonna heal us.

681
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,144
爸爸?
Dad?

682
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:56,845
我觉得这些人想见莎拉。
I think these people want to see Sara.

683
00:44:00,883 --> 00:44:03,319
哦,上帝。
Oh, Lord.

684
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:05,354
我将……出去叫他们都离开。
I'll... go out and ask 'em all to leave.

685
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:07,089
你不能,爸爸。
You can't, Daddy.

686
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:12,629
如果我病了你能帮我做点什么呢?
What if I was sick and there was a possibility you could do something to help me?

687
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:16,765
但是，莎拉，你不是说不是你治愈了马克，而是他对上帝的信仰吗?
But, Sara, didn't you say that it wasn't you that healed Mark, that it was his faith in God?

688
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:19,468
如果所有的孩子都没有同样的信仰呢?
What if all those children don't have that same faith?

689
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,904
如果他们这么做了呢?
What if they do?

690
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,539
听着,宝贝。
Listen, sweetheart.

691
00:44:23,673 --> 00:44:27,042
你只是个小女孩。
You're just a little girl.

692
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:35,851
如果你去那里，发现那些人都被治愈了，我恐怕…我担心你再也没有机会做那个小女孩了。
And if you go out there and all those people are healed, I'm afraid that... I'm afraid that you're not gonna get a chance to be that little girl again.

693
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:37,253
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

694
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,089
爸爸是对的。
Daddy's right.

695
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:41,757
他们会越来越多地来。
They're gonna keep coming more and more.

696
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,993
它永远不会停止。
It'll never stop.

697
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,828
你还没吃早饭呢。
Look, you haven't even had breakfast yet.

698
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:50,299
我们去厨房吧，我给你做些华夫饼然后我们再好好谈谈，好吗?
Let's go in the kitchen, I'll make you some waffles and we can talk about it some more, okay?

699
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:51,500
好了，来吧。
All right, come on.

700
00:44:52,736 --> 00:44:54,671
来吧,甜心。
Come on, sweetheart.

701
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,418
莎拉?
Sara?

702
00:45:09,551 --> 00:45:11,655
莎拉?
Sara?

703
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:20,863
看,伙计们,嗯…我们知道你听说了我们女儿的事但这只是流言蜚语。
Look, folks, um... we know what you've heard about our daughter... but it's just gossip.

704
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:22,632
这是媒体编造的故事。
It's stories made up by the media.

705
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:33,342
我们的小女孩…她不能治愈病人，我很抱歉你来这里，但是…求你了，回家吧。
Our little girl... she can't cure sick people, and I'm sorry that you came out here, but... please, go back home.

706
00:45:33,475 --> 00:45:35,844
她只是个小女孩。
She's just a little girl.

707
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:39,181
她帮不了我们。
She can't help us.

708
00:45:39,315 --> 00:45:40,816
等待,等待。
Wait, wait.

709
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:56,098
你是我画的那个女孩。
You're the girl from my drawing.

710
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:57,866
画什么?
Drawing?

711
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,869
你喜欢马，对吧?
You like horses, right?

712
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:06,141
听。
Listen.

713
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:08,977
我确实看到了上帝。
I did see God.

714
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:11,715
我不知道我能不能帮你，但我看到他了。
I don't know if I can help you, but I did see Him.

715
00:46:33,202 --> 00:46:34,738
谢谢你！
Thank you.

716
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:41,076
妈妈，我会没事的。
Mom, I'm gonna be okay.

717
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:55,891
谢谢你！
Thank you.

718
00:47:44,373 --> 00:47:47,109
你有一头淡黄色的头发!
You have sandy hair!

719
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,812
你可以看到吗?
You can see?

720
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:50,279
看着我，伊莎贝尔。
Look at me, Isabel.

721
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,147
嗨,妈妈。
Hi, Mommy.

722
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:15,672
-我的天啊。-发生什么事了?
- Oh, my God. - What is happening?

723
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,050
谢谢你的光临。
Thank you for coming.

724
00:48:28,183 --> 00:48:31,821
嗯…我得去看我父母了。
Um... I have to go see my parents now.

725
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:33,322
小心翼翼地移动。
Move very carefully.

726
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:34,323
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

727
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:35,692
莎拉?
Sara?

728
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,359
-天啊，天啊-来吧，宝贝。
- Oh, my God, oh, my God. - Come on, baby.

729
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:39,261
来吧。
Come on.

730
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:55,077
好吧，听着，我们已经做了所有的血检，我也给医院打了电话安排她做核磁共振，所以，他们会等你的。
All right, look, uh, we've done all the blood work, and I've, uh, called the hospital and scheduled her for an M.R.I., so, uh, they'll be waiting for you.

731
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:59,983
医生，在她为马克·米勒祈祷之后…她一整天都下不了床。
Doctor, after she prayed for Mark Miller... she couldn't get out of bed all day.

732
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:02,150
现在看看她。
And, and now look at her.

733
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:03,753
我是说她太累了。
I mean, she's so exhausted.

734
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,823
她好像累坏了。
She's, like, wrung out.

735
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:12,962
你知道的…你当时不在场，但是…事情确实发生了。
You know... you weren't there, but... something really did happen.

736
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:17,466
另一个坐在轮椅上的男孩站起来走了起来。
A-Another boy in a wheelchair stood up and walked.

737
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,969
第一，一个失明的女孩又能看见东西了。
A, a blind girl could see again.

738
00:49:20,102 --> 00:49:22,070
这是怎么呢这一切怎么可能发生?
What's going on? How could any of this be happening?

739
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:27,109
让我们,嗯…我们先看看你女儿怎么了。
Let's, um... let's find out what's wrong with your daughter first.

740
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:30,546
然后我们可以…弄清楚你前院发生了什么。
Then we can... figure out what happened in your front yard.

741
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,114
是吗?
Yes?

742
00:49:32,247 --> 00:49:36,619
医生，我觉得有些东西你和霍普金斯夫妇需要看看。
Doctor, I think there's something you and the Hopkins need to see.

743
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,421
．..找出来。
...find out.

744
00:49:39,555 --> 00:49:43,559
就在几小时前，就站在这里，据说奇迹已经发生了。
Just hours ago, standing right here, miracles were supposedly performed.

745
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:50,566
据说，一个失明的女孩现在可以看见东西了，一个瘫痪的男孩可以走路了，一个患癌症的小女孩说她已经痊愈了。
It's been said that a blind girl can now see, a paralyzed boy can walk, and a little girl with cancer says she was healed.

746
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,568
但这些奇迹是真的吗?
But are these miracles real?

747
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:55,437
萨拉·霍普金斯会创造奇迹吗?
Is Sara Hopkins a miracle worker?

748
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:59,541
我们会坚持这个故事直到我们得到答案。
We'll stick with this story until we get the answers.

749
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:05,113
哦,不。
Oh, no.

750
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:10,519
他们怎么知道我们在这里?
How'd they know we were here?

751
00:50:10,653 --> 00:50:13,121
网上也到处都是她。
She's all over the Internet too.

752
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:15,024
我们得带莎拉离开这里。
We need to get Sara out of here.

753
00:50:15,157 --> 00:50:17,060
带她去医院做检查
Take her to the hospital and get those tests done.

754
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:19,194
你能在你父亲家待几天吗?
You think you could stay at your father's for a couple of days?

755
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:20,797
是的,当然。
Yeah, sure.

756
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,432
但是，你知道，媒体可能跟踪我们到这里，因为他们知道我们的车。
But, you know, the press probably followed us here 'cause they know our car.

757
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:24,968
我把车停在外面了。
Hey, well, I'm parked out back.

758
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,234
他们认不出我的。
They wouldn't recognize mine.

759
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:29,772
好的,太好了,嗯…亲爱的，你和本去找莎拉吧?
Okay, great, um... Honey, why don't you and Ben go gather up Sara?

760
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:34,911
丹尼，在后面找我，我们用你的车带她走，希望他们不会认出我们把她偷带出去。
Danny, meet me around back, we'll take her in your car, and let's just hope they don't recognize us sneaking her out of here.

761
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:36,411
别担心，我会拖住他们的。
Oh, no worries, I'll stall 'em.

762
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:37,814
你觉得你能应付媒体吗?
You think you can handle the press?

763
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:39,048
确定。
Sure.

764
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,152
我们能处理的，爸爸。
We can handle this, Dad.

765
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,927
你好,太太霍普金斯。我要回家了。
Hi, Mrs. Hopkins. I'm gonna go home.

766
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,327
谢谢你的晚餐。
Thank you for dinner.

767
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:54,329
再见,亲爱的。谢谢你帮忙。
Bye, honey. Thank you for helping out.

768
00:50:54,463 --> 00:50:55,330
见到你,山姆。
See you, Sam.

769
00:50:55,464 --> 00:50:56,699
再见,辛迪。
Bye, Cindy.

770
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:06,508
嗯…你看起来很累。
Well... you look tired.

771
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:11,146
我累坏了。
I'm exhausted.

772
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:18,121
我甚至无法描述或理解今早莎拉在我们家发生了什么。
I can't even begin to describe or understand what happened with Sara this morning at our house.

773
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:20,990
我不知道该说什么。
I don't know what to say.

774
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:28,698
我的意思是……我知道发生了什么，但我们家从没发生过这样的事。
I mean... I know something happened, but nothing like this has ever happened in our family.

775
00:51:28,831 --> 00:51:36,806
这会让她的世界发生翻天覆地的变化，我不认为…家里的每个人，尤其是她，都为此做好了准备。
It's about to turn her world upside down, and I don't think... anybody in this family, least of all her, is prepared for that.

776
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:41,077
但是，爸爸，我很担心，因为自从她说她见到了上帝，她的病就越来越重了。
But, Dad, I'm worried, because ever since she said she saw God, she just keeps getting sicker.

777
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:42,679
我从未见过她病成这样。
I have never seen her this ill.

778
00:51:42,812 --> 00:51:44,847
我真的担心这是一件很严重的事情。
I'm really worried that this is something very serious.

779
00:51:50,252 --> 00:51:53,355
-是医生。——好的。
- Oh, it's the doctor. - Okay.

780
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:54,991
喂?
Hello?

781
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:57,894
嗨,本。
Hi, Ben.

782
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,163
他们怎么说?
And what, what did they say?

783
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:04,834
什么?
What?

784
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,242
是吗?
Yes?

785
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:15,678
什么?
What?

786
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:18,181
哦,我的天啊。
Oh, my gosh.

787
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:20,549
谢谢你！
Thank you.

788
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:52,447
我知道你能听到我。
I know You can hear me.

789
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,086
你在越南听到了。
You heard me in 'Nam.

790
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:08,965
你可能也听到我在楼下的声音了，但是…我以为……这地方会有一些…对你有特别的意义，所以…我是来说我的意见的。
You could have probably heard me down to the house too, but... I thought maybe... this place'd have some... special meaning to You, so... I came here to say my piece.

791
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:22,779
我知道我没有权利…求你听我说…或……展示自己,还是……我知道我是谁。
I know I got no right... to ask You to hear me... or to... show Yourself, or... I know who I am.

792
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:24,914
我知道我做了什么。
I know what I've done.

793
00:53:26,448 --> 00:53:30,820
我喝得太多了，一直在打架。
I drank too much, I fought all the time.

794
00:53:32,054 --> 00:53:37,760
在军队……我做的事情。
In the army... I did things.

795
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:40,830
但是，我还是结婚了。
But, still, I got married.

796
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:42,999
我是个好丈夫。
I was a good husband.

797
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:49,471
我每天都工作，打了40年的钣金工，我还有个漂亮的女儿。
I worked every day, I pounded sheet metal for 40 years, and I had a beautiful daughter.

798
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:52,742
我妻子经常带她去教堂。
And my wife took her to church all the time.

799
00:53:52,875 --> 00:54:03,886
现在…我只是不知道莎拉看到你时到底在哪里…但我想让你知道，如果我可以，我会在那个位置。
Now... I just don't know exactly where Sara was when she saw You... but I want You to know I would be in that spot if I could.

800
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:11,459
主……哦……她真是个漂亮的孩子。
Lord... oh... she's such a beautiful child.

801
00:54:11,594 --> 00:54:19,434
她是……她比我强多了，而且你知道她一直爱着你。
She is... she is so much better than I ever was, and You know she always loved You.

802
00:54:19,568 --> 00:54:24,941
从她能说话的时候起，她就问我:“爷爷，他剪指甲了吗?”
From the time she could talk, she would ask me, "Does He cut His fingernails, Grampa?

803
00:54:25,074 --> 00:54:27,542
他刮胡子的样子跟你一样吗?”
Does He shave like you do?"

804
00:54:27,677 --> 00:54:29,377
我该说什么呢?
What was I to say?

805
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:36,518
我…我说,“亲爱的…他给了你生命，他一定爱你。”
I... I said, "Honey... He gave you life, He must love you."

806
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:42,557
我不明白!
I don't understand!

807
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:50,666
我只是，我只是不明白为什么你把她塑造得如此完美然后又把她从我们身边夺走!
I just, I just don't understand why You would make her so perfect and then snatch her away from us!

808
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,336
我不明白!
I do not understand it!

809
00:54:54,871 --> 00:55:03,045
神……我在问你……不…我乞求你。
God... I am asking You... No... I'm begging You.

810
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:05,248
请不要这样做。
Please don't do this.

811
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,252
求你别这么做，别带走莎拉!
Please don't do this, don't take Sara!

812
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:12,121
如果你需要人，带我去吧。
If You need somebody, take me.

813
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:16,225
让我的心停在这里，没事的。
Stop my heart right here, it's okay.

814
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:19,729
但请别带走莎拉。
But please don't take Sara.

815
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,570
哦,上帝…
Oh, God...

816
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:35,077
——早上。——早上。
- Morning. - Morning.

817
00:55:35,211 --> 00:55:37,412
——进来。——谢谢。
- Come in. - Thank you.

818
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:47,590
-莎拉在吗?——是的。
- Uh, is Sara here? - Yes.

819
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:50,425
我觉得我们还是私下谈谈比较好。
Uh, you know, I think it'll be better if we talk in private.

820
00:55:50,558 --> 00:55:52,762
当然可以。我去叫亚历克斯。
Of course. I'll go get Alex.

821
00:55:56,832 --> 00:55:58,968
＂...越往野锅里越往深处走……”
"...and deeper and deeper into the wild Tinker went..."

822
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:00,970
嗨,丹尼?
Hey, Danny?

823
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:03,072
你能带莎拉出去一会儿吗?
Can you please take Sara outside for a little bit?

824
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:05,107
我觉得她需要呼吸点新鲜空气。
I think she could use some fresh air.

825
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:07,610
是的，我们可以这么做。
Uh, yeah, we can do that.

826
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,477
嗯…我们可以去湖边吗?
Um... can we go to the lake?

827
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:11,614
不，不，我觉得这不是个好主意。
No, no, I don't think that's a very good idea.

828
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,416
妈妈,请。
Please, Mom.

829
00:56:13,548 --> 00:56:16,185
亲爱的，我之后会带你去个好玩的地方。
Honey, I'll take you someplace after, someplace really fun.

830
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,654
——好吗?——好的。
- Okay? - Okay.

831
00:56:18,788 --> 00:56:19,855
来吧，我们走。
Come on, let's go.

832
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,962
啊,好吧。
Ah, okay.

833
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:35,738
看看你能不能把我带到这里来。
Let's see... ah... if you can take me... at this... right here.

834
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:37,306
啊。
Ah.

835
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,442
好吧。
Okay.

836
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:42,144
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

837
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:48,684
你拿一个，然后…好…!
You take one of these, and then... Nice...!

838
00:56:48,818 --> 00:56:52,188
好吧,嗯……轮到你。
Okay, um... your turn.

839
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:53,789
你认为。
You hold that.

840
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:56,158
我们会帮你挪过去。
And we're gonna scoot up for you.

841
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:59,862
好吧，看看这个罐子…并把它。
Okay, just look at the can... and throw it.

842
00:57:15,778 --> 00:57:18,347
你还想做什么吗?
Is there anything else you want to do?

843
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:24,519
我知道医生是来谈我的，所以…我只是希望我知道他在说什么。
I know the doctor's here to talk about me, so... I just wish I knew what he was saying.

844
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:28,024
嗯…为什么我们不继续玩这个游戏呢?
Well... why don't we keep playing the game?

845
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:33,362
我告诉你…你每打倒一个人，就有一个小时的时间打我手机。
I'll tell you what... for every can you knock down, you get a free hour on my phone.

846
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:35,164
交易吗?
Deal?

847
00:57:35,297 --> 00:57:39,468
你能多放些罐头吗这样我就有更多机会了?
Will you just set up a lot more cans so I have more of a chance?

848
00:57:39,602 --> 00:57:41,103
确定。
Sure.

849
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:45,708
好吧,所以…这里还有一些。
All right, so... here's a few more.

850
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:49,178
这些都是更大的目标，你也可以从更近的地方射击。
These are bigger targets, uh, and you can shoot from a closer spot too.

851
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,946
我想会有帮助的，莎拉。
I think that'll help, Sara.

852
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:54,850
莎拉?
Sara?

853
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:00,555
所以你觉得这些测试很全面?
So you feel that these tests are comprehensive?

854
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:03,558
奥康纳医生看了莎拉的脑部扫描图。
Dr. O'Connor's been reviewing the scans of Sara's brain.

855
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:13,202
他让他们去咨询其他三个意见，他们都认为，鉴于肿瘤的大小和位置，手术风险太大。
He sent them out for three other opinions, and they all feel that, because of the size and location of the tumor, that surgery would just be too risky.

856
00:58:13,335 --> 00:58:16,238
风险太大…和……吗?
Too risky... and...?

857
00:58:16,372 --> 00:58:24,046
他说…莎拉的脑瘤无法手术。
And he's saying that... Sara's brain tumor is inoperable.

858
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,249
是的，这就是它的意思。
Yes, that's, that's, that's what it means.

859
00:58:27,383 --> 00:58:32,388
他还认为肿瘤可能导致…的幻觉。
And he also believes that the tumor could be causing... the hallucinations.

860
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:36,225
这就是为什么她认为她看到了上帝而其他人都看不到。
That's why she thinks she sees God when no one else does.

861
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:38,894
但她治愈的孩子们呢?
But what about the children that she cured?

862
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:42,898
暗示的力量，你知道，安慰剂效应。
Power of suggestion, you know, a placebo effect.

863
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:47,636
你在说什么，这是大规模催眠的结果吗?
What are you saying, that this is the result of, of a kind of mass hypnosis?

864
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:57,313
一个残疾的孩子又能走路了，一个失明的小女孩恢复了视力，还有一个小女孩确信萨拉治愈了她的癌症，天哪!
A handicapped child walked again, a blind girl regained her eyesight, and another little girl is sure that Sara cured her cancer, for crying out loud.

865
00:58:57,446 --> 00:59:00,216
杰瑞，有记录的案例可以解释这些类型的治愈。
Jerry, there are documented cases that explain these types of healings.

866
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:07,156
我的意思是，在2004年，有一个人全身长着葡萄柚大小的肿瘤，他只能活不到两周了。
I mean, in, in 2004, there was a man who had tumors the size of grapefruits throughout his body, and he had less than two weeks to live.

867
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:12,628
他服用了一种他认为可以治愈癌症的药物，四天后，肿瘤完全消失了。
He took a substance that he believed would cure cancer, and four days later, the tumors completely disappeared.

868
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:18,400
所以这些孩子很有可能就是这样的。
So it's in the realm of possibility that this is what happened to those children.

869
00:59:18,534 --> 00:59:22,138
好吧，好吧，我们以后再谈其他孩子。
Okay, okay, we can talk about those other children later.

870
00:59:22,271 --> 00:59:24,807
我们还有其他的选择吗?
What other options do we have?

871
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:27,543
没别的选择了邦妮
There are no other options, Bonnie.

872
00:59:27,676 --> 00:59:28,944
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

873
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:35,351
不…其他选项吗?
No... other options?

874
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:42,925
等待,是……你是说……莎拉比我遇到的任何孩子都更有信心。
Wait, are... are you saying... Sara has more faith than any child I've ever met.

875
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:48,564
我想没有人能确定她什么时候会死。
I don't think anyone can say for certain when she is going to die.

876
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:55,037
你是说……我的女儿会死吗?
Are you saying... my little girl's gonna die?

877
00:59:57,306 --> 01:00:00,543
本，告诉我们真相。
Ben, just tell us the truth.

878
01:00:00,676 --> 01:00:02,678
莎拉要死了。
Sara's dying.

879
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:14,723
等等，那里，那里，一定有一家特殊的医院或者，或者一些新的，实验性的治疗方法。
Wait, there, there, there must be, like, a special hospital or, or some, some new, experimental treatments.

880
01:00:14,857 --> 01:00:16,425
我们可以做的事。
Something that we can do.

881
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:22,331
如果有……邦妮，相信我我会的。
If there was... anything I could do, Bonnie, believe me... I would.

882
01:00:22,464 --> 01:00:26,936
所以，我们必须…我们得告诉她。
So, we have to... we have to tell her.

883
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:30,239
我要怎么告诉我女儿她要死了?
How do I tell my little girl that she's gonna die?

884
01:00:30,372 --> 01:00:31,740
我不想失去她，亲爱的。
I don't want to lose her, honey.

885
01:00:31,874 --> 01:00:33,075
我受不了了。
I can't stand it.

886
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:34,577
我太爱她了。
I love her too much.

887
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:42,017
她是我的孩子……我不能……没事的,妈妈。
She's my baby... I can't... It's okay, Mommy.

888
01:00:42,151 --> 01:00:43,519
哦,莎拉。
Oh, Sara.

889
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:45,689
我只是不想让你哭。
I just don't want you to cry.

890
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:47,556
停止哭泣。
Stop crying.

891
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:50,192
哦,亲爱的…我也很抱歉让你听到这些。
Oh, honey... I'm so sorry you had to hear all of that too.

892
01:00:50,326 --> 01:00:52,261
请停止哭泣。
Please, stop crying.

893
01:00:52,394 --> 01:00:54,930
真的,没关系。
Really, it's okay.

894
01:00:55,064 --> 01:00:57,533
我听到莱利医生说我快死了。
I heard what Dr. Riley said about me dying.

895
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:02,238
-哦…-我只是不想让你伤心，好吗?
- Oh... - Just, I don't want you to be sad, okay?

896
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:05,241
没关系，因为如果我去天堂，我会和上帝在一起。
It's okay, 'cause if I go to Heaven, I'll be with God.

897
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:14,216
甜心……我爱你。
Sweetheart... I love you.

898
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:16,018
我爱你这么多!
I love you this much!

899
01:01:16,151 --> 01:01:20,489
我爱你这么多，甚至更多。
I love you this much and even more.

900
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,928
妈妈，爸爸，我不想去医院
Mom, Dad, I don't want to go to the hospital.

901
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:31,934
我想回到湖边……我想再见到上帝。好吗?
I want to go back to the lake... and I want to see God again. Please?

902
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:38,040
我…哦……但是…我们得去医院，好吗?
I... oh... but... We have to go to the hospital, okay?

903
01:01:38,173 --> 01:01:39,808
在那里他们会让你感到舒服。
That's where they'll make you comfortable.

904
01:01:39,942 --> 01:01:42,712
我知道，但我想回到湖边。
I know, but I want to go back to the lake.

905
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:48,752
我想问上帝我能不能等到我长大后再去天堂和你们在一起。
I want to ask God if I can wait to go to Heaven and stay with you guys till I grow up.

906
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:52,154
亲爱的?亲爱的?哦,不。
Honey? Honey? Oh, no.

907
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:53,989
-看着我。-哦不哦不
- Look at me. - Oh, no, oh, no.

908
01:01:54,123 --> 01:01:57,326
我们得马上送她去医院
We need to get her to the hospital, right now.

909
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:05,501
爷爷，请带我去湖边。
Grampa, please take me to the lake.

910
01:02:15,311 --> 01:02:16,979
天啊，她来了吗?
Oh, my God, is she here?

911
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:20,549
我们需要的东西都带齐了吗?
Do you have everything we need?

912
01:02:20,684 --> 01:02:22,217
别紧张，我已经搞定了。
Relax, I got everything taken care of.

913
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,153
-好吧，好吧。-嘿，嘿，他们来了!
- All right, all right. - Hey, hey, here they come!

914
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:28,658
丹尼，你能告诉我们你妹妹的健康状况吗?
Danny, can you tell us the status of your sister's health?

915
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:31,293
这是什么严重的疾病吗?
Is this some sort of grave illness?

916
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:32,895
她怎么样了?
How, how's she doing?

917
01:02:33,028 --> 01:02:34,798
你的妈妈怎么样?辛迪!辛迪!
How's your mom? Cindy! Cindy!

918
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,132
给我们一些最新消息。
Give us an update of some kind.

919
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:49,813
嘿…我以为……你可能想给我画一个你想出来的伦勃朗。
Hey... I thought... you might want to draw me one of those Rembrandts you've been coming up with.

920
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:51,213
谢谢你,你们。
Thanks, you guys.

921
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:53,750
丹尼?
Danny?

922
01:02:53,882 --> 01:02:59,521
我想知道和某人约会是什么感觉……和…坠入爱河。
I wanted to know what it's like to date someone... and... to be in love.

923
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:01,523
就像你和辛迪一样。
The way you and Cindy are.

924
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:10,966
嗯…嗯…太棒了。
Well... um... it's great.

925
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:15,839
你们总是期待和对方在一起。
You always look forward to being with one another.

926
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:17,674
你分享的东西。
You share stuff.

927
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:20,744
我是说，感情和一些事情。
I mean, feelings and things.

928
01:03:20,876 --> 01:03:23,912
很难解释。
It's tough to explain it.

929
01:03:24,046 --> 01:03:27,015
当你开始约会时，你会发现的。
When you start dating, you'll find out.

930
01:03:27,149 --> 01:03:35,924
我觉得我活不了那么久了，丹尼，而且…我觉得我一定会想念的。
I don't think I'm gonna live that long, Danny, and... I think it's something I'm really gonna miss.

931
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:48,437
有什么需要我们帮忙的吗?
Is there anything we can do for you?

932
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:55,377
你可以唱《相信你》给我听就像我们在车里唱的那样。
You can sing the "Believe in You" song for me... like we did in the car.

933
01:03:57,379 --> 01:04:01,150
我想相信你
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

934
01:04:01,283 --> 01:04:04,052
给我个信号吧
♪ So give me a sign ♪

935
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:08,090
我想相信你
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

936
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,627
再给我点时间…♪
♪ Just give me more time... ♪

937
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,763
我想相信你
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

938
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:19,368
但你必须相信…在我。♪
♪ But You have to believe... in me. ♪

939
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,912
我美丽的天使怎么样了?
How's my beautiful angel?

940
01:04:29,044 --> 01:04:31,146
嘿,甜心。
Hey, sweetheart.

941
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:47,296
嗯…我们要出去一会儿，但是…我们马上回来。
Uh... we're gonna step out for a while, but... we'll be right back.

942
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:55,137
我们非常爱你。
We love you so much.

943
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:15,792
擦你的脚。
Wipe your feet.

944
01:05:19,228 --> 01:05:21,263
现在请坐。
Now take a seat.

945
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:24,767
谢谢你们的到来。
Thank you all for coming.

946
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:27,637
特蕾莎有话要说。
Theresa has something to say.

947
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:40,549
上周，当莎拉在她屋外帮助那些孩子时……我感觉到了什么。
Last week, when Sara was helping those children outside her house... I felt something.

948
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:44,453
我也看到了。
I also saw it.

949
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:52,494
那是一个飘浮在萨拉身边的神灵，伸出手去触摸她正在触摸的孩子们。
It was a spiritual figure floating next to Sara, holding out His hand to touch the children she was touching.

950
01:05:54,363 --> 01:06:06,943
在她为我祈祷后，两年来我第一次感到不同和温暖。
After she prayed for me... I felt... different... and warm... for the first time in two years.

951
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:08,410
健康。
Healthy.

952
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:18,220
我知道我已经痊愈了……我也知道我看到了上帝
I knew I'd been cured... and I also know that I was seeing God.

953
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:21,691
莎拉告诉我们的都是真的。
Everything Sara told us was true.

954
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:27,864
她非常想帮助别人，而且……现在我们得帮她。
She wanted so much to help people and... and now we have to help her.

955
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:33,068
谢谢你,特里萨。
Thank you, Theresa.

956
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:42,477
好吧麦肯和我想出了一个计划这很可能会让很多人不高兴。
All right, Mac and I have worked out a plan... and it's liable to get a whole bunch of people upset.

957
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:51,253
说到一大群人，我是指莱利医生，我是指你的父母，我是指医院里的所有人。
And by a whole bunch of people, I mean Dr. Riley, I mean your parents, and I mean about everybody at the hospital.

958
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:56,926
莎拉跟我说的最后一句话是她想回到湖边。
The last thing Sara said to me was she wanted to go back to the lake.

959
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:01,163
我知道那就是她的视力，我知道那就是她治愈的原因。
I know that that's where she had her vision, I know that's where her healing comes from.

960
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:06,903
我得认为她知道一些我们不知道的事，一些能帮到她的事。
I have to think that she knows something that we don't know, something that could help her.

961
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:12,775
我不知道，但我知道我会看到她实现她最后的愿望。
I don't know, but I do know I'm gonna see that she gets her last wish.

962
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:16,311
我今晚要带莎拉回湖边。
I'm taking Sara back to the lake tonight.

963
01:07:16,445 --> 01:07:18,413
哦,我们在。
Oh, we're in.

964
01:07:18,547 --> 01:07:20,950
她帮助治愈了我的孩子。
She helped to cure my baby.

965
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:23,218
我们会尽我们所能帮助她。
We're gonna do everything we can to help her.

966
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:32,127
我无法解释莎拉身上发生的奇迹，但如果她想回到那里，我相信这是上帝的旨意让我们帮助她。
I can't explain the miracles that have taken place through Sara, but if she wants to go back up there, I believe it is God's will for us to help her.

967
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,696
我同意你，牧师。
I agree with you, Pastor.

968
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,699
听起来不错，我加入。
Sounds good to me, I'm in.

969
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:41,536
但医院外面到处都是记者和人。
But there's reporters and people all around the outside of the hospital.

970
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:46,609
在医院里，她身边不仅有我的父母，还有整个医院的工作人员。
And inside, she's surrounded by not only my parents, but the entire hospital staff.

971
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:49,177
他们不会让我们把她带出来的。
They're not gonna let us take her out of there.

972
01:07:49,311 --> 01:07:51,146
我们需要一个大计划来解救她。
We need a major plan to spring her.

973
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:53,415
完全正确。
Exactly.

974
01:07:53,548 --> 01:07:57,854
玛丽亚一直在医院做兼职夜间护士。
Maria's been working part-time as a night nurse up at the hospital.

975
01:07:57,987 --> 01:08:02,257
她有这张通行证，几乎可以打开任何一扇门。
She has this pass, which'll open almost any door.

976
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:09,032
这就是我的想法…
So this is what I'm thinking...

977
01:08:41,898 --> 01:08:44,734
没关系,亲爱的。
It's okay, honey.

978
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,937
我们在这里，我们都在这里。
We're here, we're all here.

979
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,080
孩子们，我能去候诊室跟你们谈谈吗?
Hey, kids, can I talk to you in the waiting room a minute?

980
01:08:57,212 --> 01:09:00,248
为什么不在这里?
Why not in here?

981
01:09:00,382 --> 01:09:04,120
没关系，反正我还需要点咖啡。
It's okay, I need some more coffee anyway.

982
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:13,996
房间里很明显。
The room's clear.

983
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:19,902
克拉维茨医生，大厅有人来找你。
Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby.

984
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:26,709
嘿…我们会救你出去的…
Hey... we're gonna get you outta here...

985
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:33,916
好吧，我们得非常小心地处理这件事。
Okay, we have to get this done very carefully.

986
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:36,953
脉搏的任何变化都会把所有的护理人员带到这里来。
Any break in the pulse rhythm will bring the whole nursing staff right in here.

987
01:09:37,086 --> 01:09:41,456
一个,两个,三个……
One, two, three...

988
01:09:44,761 --> 01:09:45,995
好吧。
Okay.

989
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:19,327
不好意思，我的朋友不太舒服。
Excuse me, but my, my friend here isn't... feel-feeling very well.

990
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:20,963
你有什么症状?
What are your symptoms?

991
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:24,432
我不知道，我，我只是，我觉得头晕，而且…我想我要晕倒了。
I don't know, I, I just, I feel so dizzy and... I think I'm gonna faint.

992
01:10:24,566 --> 01:10:27,804
-好吧，让我帮你…-哦…躺下。
- Well, let's get you... - Oh... Lay down.

993
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:37,747
克拉维茨医生，大厅有人来找你。
Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby.

994
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,717
Kravitz博士……大厅里的一个访客。
Dr. Kravitz... ... a visitor in the main lobby.

995
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:43,853
我们要去哪里?
Where are we going?

996
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:46,222
带你去湖边。
Taking you to the lake.

997
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:11,314
我们很好!
We're good!

998
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,884
现在好多了，谢谢!
All better now, thanks!

999
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:18,654
嘿，你忘了你的包!
Hey, you forgot your bag!

1000
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:21,858
谢谢你！
Thank you!

1001
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:25,328
听着，萨姆，我们不能这么做。
Look, Sam, we can't do something like that.

1002
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,462
你听到医生说的了。
You heard what the doctor said.

1003
01:11:27,597 --> 01:11:31,667
我知道你们都不同意，但我会尊重你们最后的要求。
I know you both disagree, but I'm gonna honor that last request.

1004
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:33,435
爸爸,不!
Dad, no!

1005
01:11:33,568 --> 01:11:40,643
我知道你有多爱她，但我们不会把她带回湖边... ...尤其是在这样的夜晚。
I know how much you love her, but we are not taking her back to that lake... ...especially on a night like this.

1006
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,388
她看起来怎么样?
How's she looking?

1007
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:54,891
看来她又睡着了。
Looks like she's sleeping again.

1008
01:11:55,024 --> 01:12:00,363
亲爱的?Sweeth……什么……这是什么?
Honey? Sweeth... What the... what is this?

1009
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:01,764
莎拉在哪儿?
Where's Sara?

1010
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:05,668
嗯…爸爸!爸爸?
Um... Dad! Dad?

1011
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:08,070
哦,我的……这是怎么回事?
Oh, my... What is going on?

1012
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:09,605
——嗯…嗯…——莎拉在哪儿?
- Um... well... - Where's Sara?

1013
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:14,243
我们觉得她在这里不舒服，所以我们决定把她拿下…到湖边? !
We thought that she wasn't comfortable here, so we decided to take her down... To the lake?!

1014
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:19,547
有点……你看到莎拉·霍普金斯离开12号房间了吗?
Kinda... Did you see Sara Hopkins leaving Room 12?

1015
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:20,716
她不可能。
She couldn't have.

1016
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,218
她的脉搏监测器还开着。
Her pulse monitor is still on.

1017
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:24,353
你可能想再查一遍。
You might want to check again.

1018
01:12:24,486 --> 01:12:26,122
你真觉得他们要去湖边吗?
You really think they're going to the lake?

1019
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:27,857
是啊，这都是爸爸干的。
Yeah, this is all Dad's doing.

1020
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,959
他和那个愚蠢又疯狂的把她带回去的主意!
Him and that stupid, crazy idea of taking her back there!

1021
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:39,101
走吧!走吧!我将跟随你!
Go! Go! I'll follow ya!

1022
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:06,095
我觉得我受不了这么激动!
I don't think I can take this much excitement!

1023
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:10,199
是吗?拿好你的帽子，因为还会有更多!
Yeah? Hold on to your hat, 'cause there's gonna be a lot more of it!

1024
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:22,445
嘿!那个叫霍普金斯的女孩刚离开，往I-60方向去了!
Hey! The Hopkins girl just left, headed up I-60!

1025
01:13:22,577 --> 01:13:24,413
——I-60 ?——是的!
- I-60? - Yes!

1026
01:13:24,546 --> 01:13:25,948
-好了，走吧，走吧!——走吧!
- All right, let's go, let's go! - Let's go!

1027
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:38,694
你能看到吗?
Can you see okay?

1028
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:41,330
会没事的，亲爱的。
It'll be all right, honey.

1029
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:43,699
我们马上就到。
We'll be there soon.

1030
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:04,086
如果我们停下来，我们就完蛋了。
Oh, man, if we stop, we're sunk.

1031
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,822
但是，丹尼，你必须停下来，我们是警察!
But, Danny, you have to stop, it's the police!

1032
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:16,098
好吧，我们得阻止他们，麦克。
Okay, we're gonna have to cut these guys off, Mac.

1033
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:18,566
主啊，原谅他吧，他不知道自己在做什么!
Oh, Lord, forgive him, for he knows not what he's doing!

1034
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:19,969
坚持住!
Hold on!

1035
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,041
的车!的车!
Car! Car!

1036
01:14:28,344 --> 01:14:29,912
哦……哦……
Oh... oh...

1037
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:33,716
那不是山姆·多诺万的卡车吗?
Isn't that Sam Donovan's truck?

1038
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:38,487
看起来确实是这样……这事不会让警察满意的。
Sure looks like it... This is not gonna sit real well with the cops.

1039
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,156
等等，等等，等等，等等。
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1040
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:41,891
你这车开得还不够快吗?
Aren't you going about as fast as this truck can go?

1041
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:44,760
这不是关于快，而是关于慢。
It's not about going fast, it's about slowing down.

1042
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,602
那家伙怎么了?他疯了吗?
What's the matter with that guy? Has he gone nuts?

1043
01:14:53,736 --> 01:14:55,604
天啊，我希望他们不会打我们。
Oh, Lord, I hope they don't hit us.

1044
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:57,039
什么? !
What?!

1045
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:58,707
山姆·多诺万，靠边停车!
Sam Donovan, pull over!

1046
01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:02,044
你在妨碍司法公正妨碍警方追捕!
You're obstructing justice and interfering with a police pursuit!

1047
01:15:06,082 --> 01:15:07,716
我们正在失去他们!
We're losing them!

1048
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:08,951
丹尼,小心!
Danny, be careful!

1049
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:11,387
路太湿了，慢一点!
The road is so wet, slow down!

1050
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,489
别担心，我来搞定。
Don't worry, I got this.

1051
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:20,196
天父啊，请让他们对我们仁慈吧。
Oh, Heavenly Father, please let them be lenient with us.

1052
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:22,465
你觉得我们要为此蹲多少年?
How many years you think we're gonna get for this?

1053
01:15:22,598 --> 01:15:26,402
我不知道，麦克，但足够我复习圣经了!
I don't know, Mac, but enough to brush up on my Bible reading!

1054
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:39,281
-你是谁?-我也不知道，但是在超速，违章超车和尾随的情况下，看来我们得跑半个镇子了。
- Who's this now? - Beats me, but between the speeding, illegal passing and tailgating, looks like we're gonna have to run half the town in.

1055
01:15:39,415 --> 01:15:40,716
我去叫支援。
I'm gonna call for backup.

1056
01:15:42,785 --> 01:15:45,254
在警察前面的是萨姆吗?
Is that Sam up ahead of the police?

1057
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:46,956
看起来像它。
Looks like it.

1058
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:48,757
你确定要跟这么近吗?
Are you sure you should be tailgating this close?

1059
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:50,226
我想知道他在做什么。
I'm trying to see what he's up to.

1060
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:52,995
我们比刚开始的时候慢多了。
We're going a lot slower than when we started.

1061
01:15:53,129 --> 01:15:54,797
那是因为他在帮丹尼逃跑。
That's because he's helping Danny get away.

1062
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,099
家伙太棒了!
Dude is awesome!

1063
01:16:09,613 --> 01:16:12,348
不…不，这不可能!
No... No, this can't be happening!

1064
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:14,316
我们得把她弄上去!
We have to get her up there!

1065
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,452
在这里,他们来了!
Here they come!

1066
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,289
你能把她抬上去吗?
Can you carry her up?

1067
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:23,325
可能不是在暴风雨中，不是独自一人。
Probably not in the storm, not alone.

1068
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:29,532
你在这里做什么，伙计?
What are you doing here, man?

1069
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,333
你想把你妹妹带到湖边，对吧?
You're trying to get your sister up to the lake, right?

1070
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:35,204
对，但路被封锁了，我不知道她还有多少时间。
Yeah, but the road's blocked, and I don't know how much time she has.

1071
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,006
警察就在我们后面。
Cops are right on our tail.

1072
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:39,175
我们可以抄近路穿过梅森山，比较快。
We can take a shortcut through Mason's Hill, it's quicker.

1073
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:41,477
这座山吗?我们到不了的!
The mountain? We'll never make it!

1074
01:16:41,611 --> 01:16:43,445
来吧，伙计，我们能做到的!
Come on, dude, we can do this!

1075
01:16:47,783 --> 01:16:51,020
你救了我的狗，我欠你的…大的时间。
For saving my dog, I owe you... big time.

1076
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,322
快点，我们得走了，我们得离开这里。
Come on, we gotta go, we gotta get out of here.

1077
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:54,490
走,走,走。
Go, go, go.

1078
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,585
莎拉在哪儿?
Where's Sara?

1079
01:17:21,717 --> 01:17:23,085
阿瓦和丹尼带走了她。
Alvie and Danny have her.

1080
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:24,420
他们开始上山了!
They started up the hill!

1081
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:25,655
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1082
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,490
多诺万!停在那里!
Donovan! Hold it right there!

1083
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:30,694
你哪儿也不能去!
You're not going anywhere!

1084
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:35,497
你几乎违反了所有的交通法规，更别提妨碍警察追捕了。
You've broken just about every traffic law there is, not to mention hindering a police pursuit.

1085
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:37,166
你被捕了。
You're under arrest.

1086
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:41,170
我们要扣押你的车护送你去警局。
We're impounding your vehicle and escorting you to the station.

1087
01:17:41,303 --> 01:17:43,839
听着，我的孙女快要死了!
Listen, my granddaughter is dying!

1088
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:45,874
你是说那个治愈了所有人的孩子吗?
You mean the kid that's been curing all those people?

1089
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:54,250
是的，她让我做的最后一件事就是在她去世前带她去湖边，医生说可能是今晚。
Yes, and the last thing she asked me was to take her up to the lake before she passes, and the doctors say it could be tonight.

1090
01:17:54,383 --> 01:18:00,556
你知道我住哪，你可以在下来的路上逮捕我，但我现在要带她过去。
You know where I live, you can arrest me on the way down, but I'm taking her up there now.

1091
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:07,429
哈罗，没必要把事情弄得更糟。
Harrow, no sense making things worse.

1092
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:22,845
不只是多诺万，整个镇子都疯了!
It's not just Donovan, the whole town's gone nuts!

1093
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:41,997
哦!噢!
Oh! Ooh!

1094
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:43,966
不，不，不，不，别回来，别回来!
No, no, no, no, don't come back, don't come back!

1095
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:46,502
继续，山姆，继续!
Keep going, Sam, keep going!

1096
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:48,003
麦克牧师，你还好吗?
Pastor Mac, are you okay?

1097
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:49,905
没事，没事，我没事。
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1098
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:00,710
好男孩,时髦的!
Good boy, Nobby!

1099
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,187
-你会没事的。-让她躺在这里。
- You're gonna be okay. - Lay her down here.

1100
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:14,556
这里，这里，这里，这里。
Here, here, here, here.

1101
01:20:14,691 --> 01:20:15,792
你是好的。
You're okay.

1102
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:20,562
莎拉,我们在这里。
Sara, we're here.

1103
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:23,132
你想让我和你一起祈祷吗?
Do you want me to pray with you?

1104
01:20:23,265 --> 01:20:32,842
我们在天上的父，愿人都尊你的名为圣…她还在吗?
Our Father... who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name... Is she still with us?

1105
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:34,711
几乎没有。
Barely.

1106
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:49,124
莎拉!莎拉?莎拉?
Sara! Sara? Sara?

1107
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:53,897
等等,莎拉…哦,上帝…等等,宝贝。
Hold on, Sara... oh, God... Hold on, sweetheart.

1108
01:20:54,029 --> 01:21:01,805
哦,不……不,不……哦,宝贝,甜心…我爱你，我爱你…我很爱你。
Oh, no... no, no... Oh, baby, sweetheart... I love you, I love you... I love you so much.

1109
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:08,812
哦,亲爱的…爸爸你知道医生想让她住院
Oh, sweetheart... Dad, you knew that the doctors wanted to keep her in the hospital.

1110
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:12,514
你怎么能把她带到这里来，尤其是像今晚这样的夜晚!
How could you bring her here, especially on a night like tonight?!

1111
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:14,584
如果发生了什么事，那都是你的错!
If something happens, it's your fault!

1112
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:17,821
这是你的错!你们所有的人!
This is your fault! All of you!

1113
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:19,421
你们都有责任!
All of you had a hand in this!

1114
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:21,290
你为什么就不能放过她呢?
Why couldn't you just leave her alone?

1115
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:29,465
她是个好女孩，她一心只想帮你，现在她…哦,不……哦,不……莎拉?亲爱的,莎拉?
She's such a good girl, all she wanted to do was help you, and now she's... Oh, no... oh, no... Sara? Sara, sweetheart?

1116
01:21:29,599 --> 01:21:30,667
——亲爱的?-来吧，亲爱的。
- Sweetheart? - Come on, sweetheart.

1117
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,337
不…求你了，不要离开我们。
No... Please, don't leave us.

1118
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:22,210
哦……哦……
Oh... oh...

1119
01:23:49,504 --> 01:23:52,274
你听到了吗?
Hey, did you get any of that?

1120
01:23:54,911 --> 01:23:57,145
什么也没有。
There's nothing there.

1121
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,883
它是空白的。
It's blank.

1122
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:13,930
好吧，艾德，你可以带我进去。
All right, Ed, you can take me in.

1123
01:24:14,063 --> 01:24:16,131
没关系,山姆。
It's okay, Sam.

1124
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:20,937
也许你超速是有理由的，即使从法律的角度看也是如此。
Maybe you had a good reason for speeding, even in the eyes of the law.

1125
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:24,306
你孙女能做她想做的事吗?
Your granddaughter get to do what she wanted?

1126
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:27,175
比你知道的要多。
More than you'll ever know.

1127
01:24:27,309 --> 01:24:28,711
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1128
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:34,216
埃迪，你看到了吗?
Eddie, are you seeing this?

1129
01:24:34,349 --> 01:24:39,454
这是一年中最强的暴风雨之一，但是去那里的人没有一个是湿的。
It was one of the strongest storms of the year, yet none of the people who went up there are wet.

1130
01:25:45,621 --> 01:25:47,757
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1131
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:59,702
我知道…我们说什么都不会给你带来安慰……但我们都知道莎拉现在在哪
I know... nothing we can say will bring you comfort... but we all know where Sara is now.

1132
01:25:59,836 --> 01:26:03,338
在上帝的手中是安全的。
Safe in God's hands.

1133
01:26:07,242 --> 01:26:10,213
爸爸……
Dad...

1134
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,823
爸爸，我为我在湖边说的话道歉。
Dad, I'm sorry for what I said at the lake.

1135
01:26:20,957 --> 01:26:25,161
我知道你有多爱她，你只是想满足她的愿望。
I know how much you loved her, and you were just trying to fulfil her wish.

1136
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:30,398
你知道一些我们都无法理解的事情，所以我…谢谢你为她所做的一切。
And, and you knew something that none of us could understand, so I... thank you for doing that for her.

1137
01:26:38,107 --> 01:26:40,575
爸爸。
Dad.

1138
01:26:55,258 --> 01:26:56,759
肯定是她画的最后一张画。
Must've been the last picture she drew.

1139
01:26:56,893 --> 01:27:00,562
我…我想她知道上帝要来找她了。
I... I think she knew God was coming for her.

1140
01:27:00,696 --> 01:27:04,167
这是美丽的。
That's beautiful.

1141
01:27:04,299 --> 01:27:07,435
我要把它裱起来挂在教堂里。
I'll have it framed and hung up in church.

1142
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:15,244
丹尼…丹尼，看这个…
Danny... Danny, look at this...

1143
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:20,149
妈妈!爸爸!
Mom! Dad!

1144
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:24,720
这是她画的最后一幅画。
This is the last picture she drew.

1145
01:27:24,854 --> 01:27:26,022
她回来了!
She's coming back!

1146
01:27:26,155 --> 01:27:29,659
这意味着，也许…
That means that, maybe...

1147
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:37,200
神……你会让莎拉回到我们身边吗?
God... ...are You gonna let Sara come back to us?

1148
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:39,669
——哦,丹尼…——你能吗?
- Oh, Danny... - Can You?

1149
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:43,572
-你，你，求求你…-丹尼…求你了，让莎拉回到我们身边?
- Will You, will You, please... - Danny... Please, let Sara come back to us?

1150
01:27:43,706 --> 01:27:46,742
-亲爱的，对不起…——请神。
- Sweetheart, I'm sorry... - Please, God.

1151
01:27:46,876 --> 01:27:49,645
-你可以吗?-你得让她走
- Will You, please? - You got to let her go.

1152
01:27:49,779 --> 01:27:55,618
——莎拉吗?-对不起，亲爱的…-拜托，莎拉，拜托…——我很抱歉……我很抱歉，亲爱的。
- Sara, please? - I'm sorry, darling... - Please, Sara, please... - I'm sorry... I'm so sorry, sweetie.

1153
01:27:58,921 --> 01:28:01,456
莎拉?莎拉!
Sara? Sara!

1154
01:28:01,591 --> 01:28:14,136
哦,我的……——哦!——莎拉!莎拉…哦……——莎拉?——嗨,妈咪……爸爸……莎拉!
Oh, my... - Oh! - Sara! Sara... Oh... - Sara? - Hi, Mommy... Daddy... Sara!

1155
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,304
亲爱的，你好吗?
Honey, how are you?

1156
01:28:19,474 --> 01:28:22,712
这是一个奇迹!
It's a miracle!

1157
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:29,517
我告诉上帝，我认为我还没有准备好去天堂，他让我回到这里来照顾你。
I told God that I didn't think I was ready to go to Heaven and He told me to come back here and take care of you.

1158
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:37,425
哦,我的……我的宝贝…我的宝贝，你还活着。
Oh, my... my baby... Oh, my baby, you're alive.

1159
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:39,595
你活着。
You're alive.

1160
01:28:39,729 --> 01:28:40,963
我很爱你。
I love you so much.

1161
01:28:42,832 --> 01:28:47,502
感谢上帝，感谢上帝。
Thank You, God, thank You, God.

1162
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:48,470
谢谢你,上帝。
Thank You, God.

1163
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:50,339
这是不可能的。
It, it, it's not possible.

1164
01:28:50,472 --> 01:28:54,343
她没有呼吸，没有，没有脉搏。
She wasn't breathing, there was no, there was no pulse.

1165
01:28:54,476 --> 01:28:56,746
你开始明白了。
You're beginning to catch on.

1166
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:11,761
这是一个奇迹!
It's a miracle!

1167
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:26,943
不,不跪。
No, don't kneel.

1168
01:29:27,076 --> 01:29:31,948
我只是一个…上帝决定拜访的幸运女孩。
I'm just a... lucky girl who God decided to visit.

1169
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:35,985
它……可能是你们中的任何一个。
It... could've been any one of you.

1170
01:29:36,118 --> 01:29:41,791
他仍然可能回来看你们中的一个，就像他对我那样。
He still may come back to see one of you, just like He did with me.

1171
01:29:47,797 --> 01:29:57,773
请起来，现在你们都需要相信一些事。
Please, get up... and... now you all need to believe something.

1172
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:01,844
我再也不能治愈任何人了。
I can't cure anyone anymore.

1173
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:07,984
但是…一开始我并不是那个真正治愈病人的人。
But... I wasn't the one who really cured people in the first place.

1174
01:30:08,117 --> 01:30:10,319
这是神。
It was God.

1175
01:30:10,453 --> 01:30:14,657
他只是告诉我该做什么…我做到了。
He just told me what to do and... I did it.

1176
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:18,327
真相是……你们都能治好人。
The truth is... all of you can cure people.

1177
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:21,330
你真的可以。
You really can.

1178
01:30:21,464 --> 01:30:28,371
你所要做的就是相信上帝并向他祈祷，他会帮助你的。
All you have to do is believe in God and pray to Him, and He'll help you.

1179
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:31,974
有时……我们不能马上看到它。
Sometimes... we can't see it right away.

1180
01:30:32,108 --> 01:30:39,415
或者有时候答案并不是你所祈祷的，但是……他的听力。
Or sometimes the answer isn't exactly what you've prayed for, but... He's listening.

1181
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:44,186
很快你就会看到他是多么的仁慈和奇妙。
And soon you'll see how kind and how wonderful He is.

1182
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,521
他是最好的。
He's the best.

1183
01:30:49,658 --> 01:31:02,204
他让我告诉你………爱你的孩子和你的家庭，并且试着每天互相帮助。
He told me to tell you... to... love your children and your families, and to try to help one another every day.

1184
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:15,418
所以…当你们今晚回家的时候…祈祷一下，问问你能做些什么来让你的家庭更强大，并帮助其他人。
So... when you all go home tonight... say a prayer and ask what you can do to make your family strong and to help other people.

1185
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:27,296
上帝会帮助你的，因为他非常爱你们。
God will help you, because... well... He loves you all... a lot.

1186
01:31:42,244 --> 01:31:44,447
．..还有那句话"上帝以神秘的方式运作"
...and, well, the expression, "God works in mysterious ways"

1187
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:48,317
当然，在我们的社区在过去的一周左右是正确的。
certainly rung true in our community over the last week or so.

1188
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:53,923
事实上，那天晚上在那条乡间小路上，我很确定我会遇到我的上帝……好几次了。
As a matter of fact, on that country road the other night, I was certain I was gonna meet my maker... several times.

1189
01:31:57,726 --> 01:32:08,037
对我们所有人来说，以我们自己的方式，不同的方式，我认为上帝已经打开了一扇门，向我们展示了一点光明，他的手臂环绕着我们，环绕着我们的朋友，
For all of us, each in our own, different way, I think God has opened a door, has shown us a little light, has shown us that His arms were around us, around our friends,

1190
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:10,873
我们的家庭，不管是今生还是来世。
our family, both in this life and in the next one.

1191
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:13,909
你能感觉到杰西在我们身边吗?
Can you feel Jesse with us?

1192
01:32:14,043 --> 01:32:17,079
你知道,呃…我能。
You know, uh... I can.

1193
01:32:20,116 --> 01:32:29,191
所以，我们中的一些人见证了…现代奇迹可以让你稍微体会一下使徒的感受。
So, some of us who have been witness to... modern miracles can get a small taste of what it was like to be an apostle.

1194
01:32:29,325 --> 01:32:40,169
因为在他们的面前是一个持续的奇迹，一个我们可以选择与神同在来陪伴我们度过一生的奇迹。
For in their presence was the one continuing miracle, the miracle that we can all choose to accompany us through our lives... the presence of God.

1195
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:57,653
看,爸爸?
See, Daddy?

1196
01:32:57,786 --> 01:32:59,421
就像耶稣说的。
It's like Jesus said.

1197
01:32:59,555 --> 01:33:08,598
信念像芥菜种子一样小，可以生长和传播，很快就会大到足以移动山脉。
Faith as small as a mustard seed can grow and spread, and soon become big enough to move mountains.

1198
01:33:10,634 --> 01:33:12,701
看来他是对的。
Guess He was right.
