1
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:01,104
It is perfectly typical
for most people

2
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:04,439
to have a strong faith
in their families...

3
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:07,010
relying on them
for love and support.

4
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:10,212
These are people we've grown up
with, who've nurtured us

5
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:13,448
and who, hopefully, have been
real cheerleaders for us.

6
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,585
But...
let's look at another parable

7
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:18,153
that talks about
a different kind of faith.

8
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,956
And here's what it says.

9
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:23,693
"The Kingdom of Heaven is
like a grain of a mustard seed,

10
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,629
"which a man took
and sowed in his field,

11
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:29,966
"and which indeed is smaller
than all seeds.

12
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:35,270
"But when it is grown,
it is greater than the herbs

13
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:38,041
"and becomes a tree,

14
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:43,478
so that birds come
and lodge in its branches."

15
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:49,018
And indeed,
faith can become so strong...

16
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,688
that it can move a mountain.

17
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:04,199
Right! On the right!

18
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,137
There you go, Danny,
way to shake it off!

19
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,273
Honey, come on, sit back down.

20
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,479
Thanks for saving me a seat.

21
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:20,415
I, I was on the sidelines,
but it's driving me crazy.

22
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,384
I can't take this pressure!

23
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,020
Well, my brother knows

24
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:26,254
he's got <i>the</i> best girlfriend
in the world.

25
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:28,256
Yeah, and the most nervous.

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,892
Where's Sam?

27
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,928
He went to go get us
some hot dogs.

28
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,228
Hope he doesn't miss anything.

29
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,164
Head back, head back!

30
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,200
Right here, outside!

31
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:39,234
I got it!

32
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,537
Get to the open space!

33
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,882
Order number 54, ready!

34
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,885
Number 52, ready!

35
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,230
- Hey!
- What are you doing, old man?!

36
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:09,132
I'm stopping two punks
from ripping off my friend,

37
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,801
or did you just forget to put
the money on the counter, huh?

38
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,970
What are you, crazy?

39
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:16,105
I don't think I'm crazy, son.

40
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,373
There's a lot of people who do.

41
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,676
You get your butts over there
and pay that woman.

42
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,477
You're gonna wish you didn't
wake up this morning, old man.

43
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:26,048
Oh, really?

44
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,153
- Aah!
- Surprise!

45
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,823
All right, son.

46
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:36,259
I'm choking you out
in about 20 seconds.

47
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,095
Nothing you can do about it
except pay for that food.

48
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,630
I, I don't have any money.

49
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,031
Neither of us do.

50
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,432
Take your wallet out
and give it to me.

51
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,402
Where is it? Let me have it.

52
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,507
Oh, wait a minute.

53
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:56,511
You're Ryan Brody?
You're Chuck's boy?

54
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,480
So you gotta be
Nick Lewis, right?

55
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,651
All right, fumble-wits,
this is how this is gonna go.

56
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,886
I'm gonna pay for this food,

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,489
and y'all are gonna look up
Sam Donovan on Crestline.

58
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,626
If I get paid back
by tomorrow night,

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,695
I won't have any reason
to call your fathers.

60
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,199
We have an agreement?

61
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,633
Do we have an agreement?!

62
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,635
Yeah.
We have an agreement.

63
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,704
You're learning.

64
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,606
Maria.

65
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,340
Hey, Sam.

66
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,676
Here's your order.

67
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,343
Okay, here's your money.

68
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,645
Keep the change.

69
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,714
Thank you.

70
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,549
You know,
you didn't have to do that.

71
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,652
Those two are probably
good kids.

72
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,788
They just need
a little guidance.

73
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,389
Yeah, well...
consider 'em guided.

74
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,099
Come on, Newburn!

75
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,034
No personal fouls!

76
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,836
That number 48

77
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,872
needs a kick in the butt
to clear his mind.

78
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,439
Dad...

79
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:58,674
Pretend I didn't say it.

80
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:01,077
Oh, but we gotta do something.

81
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,645
We're running out of time here.

82
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,315
Hey, Brauner!

83
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:09,018
You should be
out of the game for that!

84
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,485
You ready
to go home yet, Hopkins?

85
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,057
Kick it out, kick it out!

86
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,759
- Good one, good one!
- Yes!

87
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:18,661
They just have to win, Grampa.

88
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:21,898
They have to make it
to the finals.

89
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,699
Wish I could help them.

90
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,034
Wait a minute.

91
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,335
Aren't you the little girl

92
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:29,272
that's always talking
to me about God?

93
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:30,940
Well, maybe
you're on good terms with Him.

94
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,843
Why don't you ask Him?
Maybe He'll do something.

95
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:36,411
Okay, God.

96
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,247
This one's for Danny's team.

97
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,982
Please give my brother
the strength

98
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:41,784
to kick harder and faster

99
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,452
than anyone else
on that other stupid team.

100
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,691
I... guess
maybe I shouldn't have said

101
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,993
"stupid" in my prayer, huh?

102
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,598
This one is
just sweeter than chocolate.

103
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,786
Yeah! Go, Danny!

104
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,155
My prayer worked!

105
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,389
You see? I told you.

106
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:22,992
Thank You, God.

107
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:28,397
Okay, if we can just hold on
for another 21 more seconds,

108
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,832
we're going to overtime.

109
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,567
Pass it! I'm open, I'm open!

110
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,277
Oh, come on! He tripped over me
on purpose! That's not a foul!

111
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,646
Oh, come on, ref, a yellow card?
No way!

112
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,283
What does that mean?

113
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,918
It means that the Brauner kid

114
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,485
just cheated his way
into a penalty kick,

115
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,223
and if he makes it...
if he makes it, we lose.

116
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,758
Come on, ref!

117
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:00,129
Yeah...!

118
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,199
Oh, no...

119
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:12,375
Oh, nice try, Hopkins, but it's
pretty obvious you guys suck.

120
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,680
But I thought you said

121
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,682
if I prayed really hard,
we would win.

122
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,718
No, I didn't say that, honey.

123
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:25,855
I said that if you prayed
really hard, He might help.

124
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,289
And He did, honey.

125
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,891
Danny scored.

126
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,659
Yeah, but they still lost,
Grampa.

127
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:33,528
Didn't God want us to win?

128
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,999
You know,
how God works is a mystery.

129
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,935
I'm sure He heard your prayers
and He answered 'em,

130
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,205
but maybe there was a reason
that Danny's team lost.

131
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,907
You know,
like a reason more important

132
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,308
than just winning a game?

133
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:49,211
Okay.

134
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,781
Well, I'm gonna go tell Danny
that he did great anyway.

135
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:54,517
- Wanna go, Cindy?
- Sure.

136
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:58,587
- Well..
- Okay...

137
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,689
Well, are we still going over
to your place after, Dad?

138
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,925
Yeah. Should I take the kids?

139
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:04,627
Oh, thanks,
but I'm sure that Sara's

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,028
gonna wanna go
with Cindy and Danny,

141
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:07,963
so they can dance their way up.

142
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,865
You can do that in a car?

143
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,269

Can I go to the lake?

156
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,111
If Danny goes with you.

157
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,746
Great... oh, Sadie!

158
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,682
Wanna go to the lake with me?

159
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,650
Girl, are you trying
to steal my dog?

160
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:04,453
Only for the day, Grampa.

161
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:05,955
Well, you can have her
if you feed her.

162
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,325
Mm, Sadie eats too much.

163
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,960
We couldn't afford it.

164
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,529
Why didn't I think of that?

165
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:15,631
Danny, you played a great game
and I'm proud of you.

166
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,866
You doing okay?

167
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,267
Yeah, I'm fine.

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,568
I just...
can't believe that Alvie Brauner

169
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:21,137
won the game off a cheap shot.

170
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,272
- All the ref had to do was...
- Danny, come on.

171
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,907
You said
you weren't gonna talk about it.

172
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,409
You played great, honey,
and those guys were jerks.

173
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,845
Not even worried about it.

174
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:33,983
Go, Pitbulls!

175
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,417
Nice shot.

176
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,652
Showoff.

177
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,521
It's only 'cause
I know you love it.

178
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:41,323
Hey, that was a nice game,
Danny.

179
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,491
Thanks, Grampa.

180
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:43,659
Can we go to the lake?

181
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,694
Whoa...

182
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,730
I just ran in the game
for an hour and a half,

183
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,498
and now you want me
to hike up there?

184
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,101
Cindy wants to go.

185
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:55,171
Yeah, I wanna go.

186
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,172
Look at that.

187
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,373
A guy doesn't stand a chance

188
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:58,642
with these two around.

189
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,242
You're learning.

190
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,710
Come on.

191
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,512
I'm gonna catch
a lot of fish today.

192
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,947
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think so.

193
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,382
I brought my lucky pole
out here, so...

194
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:07,983
- Oh...
- You brought that pole

195
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:10,519
last time, and I caught
more than you and Grampa.

196
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,759
Okay, well, you want Grampa's
seat in the grove

197
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:18,894
or you want to try
this spot in the middle?

198
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,665
Wait, you mean we're not gonna
fish together?

199
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:26,335
Uh... no, I thought that Cindy
and I would try our luck alone.

200
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:29,038
You know,
less people, more fish?

201
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,541
Grampa told you
to keep an eye on <i>me.</i>

202
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:34,710
I should be keeping an eye
on you two.

203
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:40,115
Are you two gonna kiss?

204
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,717
You think we should?

205
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:50,025
Wait!

206
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:59,101
Oh, no, the poor thing.

207
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,004
I wonder what happened?

208
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,139
I, I don't think you should be
touching it, Sara.

209
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:05,474
It's okay.

210
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,109
It doesn't look dirty.

211
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:09,613
There's no bugs on it
or anything.

212
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,715
It's dead.

213
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:12,781
You want to bury it?

214
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,283
No.

215
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,052
It might not be dead.

216
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:23,693
It's heart isn't beating, Sara,
and it feels cold.

217
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,928
It's dead.

218
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,865
Maybe if we pray,
he'll come back to life.

219
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,967
Sara, the bird is dead.

220
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,637
Nothing can bring him back.

221
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:35,137
Lazarus was dead for four days

222
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,607
and Jesus brought him
back to life.

223
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:41,510
But... Jesus isn't here and...
the bird isn't Lazarus.

224
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:43,178
God is always here.

225
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:46,081
Well... I don't see Him.

226
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:49,586
But we have to have faith
in miracles.

227
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,390
Will you talk
some sense into her?

228
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,760
Maybe we should leave her alone.

229
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:00,462
Have a little faith
and let her pray.

230
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:03,165
Okay, but she's gonna have about
as much luck moving those trees

231
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:04,701
as she will
bringing that bird back.

232
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,869
It's not gonna happen.

233
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:09,673
Sara.

234
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:12,141
Sorry about the bird but...

235
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,376
death is a part of life.

236
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,246
You can spend the day
any way you want, Sara.

237
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,515
We'll be over at the cedars
if you need us.

238
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:22,117
Come on.

239
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:31,695
God...

240
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,333
You made this poor little guy,
so maybe You can help him out.

241
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,670
His family's probably
missing him, don't You think?

242
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:44,674
You wouldn't want them
to be sad, would You?

243
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:49,646
Please bring him back.

244
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:56,452
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be...

245
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,501
Not bad.

246
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:16,105
Should hold us for dinner.

247
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:19,875
All set?

248
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,343
All right, let's go.

249
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:32,187
Hey, did you
catch anything?

250
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:36,892
Come on, Sara, we have to go.

251
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,061
Look, I offered
to help you bury it.

252
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,864
Come on, Sara.

253
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:42,431
Your mom's not gonna like it
if you're late for dinner.

254
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,567
Do you see Him?

255
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,936
Who?

256
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,707
God.

257
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,040
Do you see Him?

258
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,780
Come on, Sara,
that's not funny.

259
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,414
There.

260
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,751
Show me where He is.

261
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,919
You don't see Him?

262
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,455
He's floating over the water.

263
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,126
Sara, we have to go.

264
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:26,575
Did you see that?

265
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,145
Maybe... the wind woke it up?

266
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,147
The wind?

267
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,283
It didn't have a heartbeat
and it was cold.

268
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,386
God brought it back to life.

269
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:43,358
Come on, guys,
Cindy's right, we gotta go.

270
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:46,663
We don't want Mom
to get mad at us.

271
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,716
Can I help?

272
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,485
You sure can.

273
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,621
You catch any fish?

274
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,121
No.

275
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:14,657
Oh, well,
you better tell your mother

276
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,759
to take some meat
out of the freezer

277
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:18,494
and put it in the microwave.

278
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:19,963
We don't have to.

279
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,965
Danny and Cindy caught some.

280
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,666
And you didn't?

281
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,167
That doesn't sound like you.

282
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,002
We found a dead bird.

283
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,303
Oh, good!
Are we gonna eat that?

284
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:31,173
No, Grampa.

285
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,878
I set him free.

286
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,579
Honey...

287
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:40,182
If he was dead, he's as free
as he's ever gonna be.

288
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,318
He was alive when I let him go.

289
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:45,889
Well, I must be
getting old, dear.

290
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,323
Didn't you tell me he was dead?

291
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:51,594
And then he came back to life?

292
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:54,664
When I found the bird, I prayed.

293
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,532
Like you told me to do
at the soccer game?

294
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,534
- Uh-huh.
- But then...

295
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:01,771
I saw God standing
on the other side of the lake,

296
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,206
and the bird flapped his wings
and I let him go.

297
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,275
Well...

298
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,579
I always thought that place
was special, honey...

299
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:11,513
and I always thought
you were kinda special.

300
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:14,049
How, how long were you praying?

301
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,618
As long as we were up there.

302
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,987
You were on your knees
the whole time?

303
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,023
Yup.

304
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:22,057
Sara, you're
an amazing little girl.

305
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,559
Did you tell your mother?

306
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,093
Yeah.

307
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:26,896
Yeah? What'd she say?

308
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,933
She said, "That's nice, honey."

309
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:33,201
She probably didn't hear me.

310
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:34,837
She wouldn't have
believed me anyway.

311
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:37,472
You know, I can understand that.

312
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,575
Maybe you just ought to
keep this between us

313
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,678
for the next little while.

314
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,913
Not everybody's
as smart as I am.

315
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,583
They might think
you just made it up.

316
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,084
But I'm telling the truth.

317
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,420
Danny and Cindy
saw it come back to life.

318
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,723
They did, huh?

319
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:57,026
Well... I believe you, hon.

320
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,728
Are you coming back
next weekend?

321
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,630
- I want to.
- Uh-huh.

322
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:03,066
I'll talk to your mama.

323
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,267
Grampa...

324
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,136
are you ever gonna
get married again?

325
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,472
Oh, dear.

326
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:13,275
Honey, the Lord
gave me your grandma,

327
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:17,080
and she put up with me
more than I deserved.

328
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:19,983
I'm not gonna push the issue.

329
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:21,985
You look young for a grampa.

330
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:23,953
Yeah, and you look so cute,

331
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,756
you make my heart hop
like a little bunny.

332
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:28,190
Not really.

333
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,592
Yes, really.

334
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:30,760
You know what?

335
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:34,496
Today... I love you this much.

336
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,165
You love me more than that.

337
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,102
Maybe that much.

338
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:45,173
Well, I love you this much,
and even more.

339
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,677
Well... you wait till dinner,

340
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,346
when I steal some of your mama's
sweet potatoes off your plate.

341
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,116
See how much you love me then.

342
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,795
Hello?

343
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:06,929
Hey.

344
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:09,431
Whose phone are you using?

345
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:11,566
<i>I borrowed my brother's.</i>

346
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,802
Borrowed?

347
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:15,504
Well, something like that.

348
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,874
Okay, so, the coolest thing
happened at the lake today.

349
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,976
<i>Yeah, like what?</i>

350
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,945
Me and Danny and Cindy
went fishing.

351
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,312
Well, they did.

352
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,514
I didn't, because...

353
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:27,650
<i>I found a dead bird.</i>

354
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:29,551
<i>And then I prayed...</i>

355
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:33,555
and then I saw God, and He
brought the bird back to life.

356
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,991
What?

357
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:36,491
It really happened, Mark.

358
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:38,293
<i>Okay, so,
let me get this straight.</i>

359
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:41,664
You saw God
and then brought a dead bird...

360
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:42,865
<i>back to life.</i>

361
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,433
No, I didn't.
God did.

362
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:46,169
Come on...

363
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,269
<i>you're playing with me.</i>

364
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:48,771
I'm not, Mark.

365
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:51,239
I'm telling you
because you're my best friend.

366
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:54,877
Okay, so, if you saw God,
then what did He look like?

367
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:57,914
He was surrounded by
a large ball of light at first,

368
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:00,282
so He was kinda hard to see.

369
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:03,920
But then He stepped
out of the light and...

370
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,823
He looked young and... kind.

371
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:09,324
<i>But I think He was wearing
a t-shirt and jeans.</i>

372
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,693
Come on.

373
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:12,929
God doesn't wear
t-shirts and jeans.

374
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:14,063
How do you know?

375
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,430
Have <i>you</i> ever seen Him?

376
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:16,766
No.

377
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,768
<i>It was God...</i>

378
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:21,904
and He did bring that bird
back to life.

379
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:25,507
<i>Danny and Cindy saw it happen,
and they don't even believe it.</i>

380
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,176
<i>They told Mom at dinner...</i>

381
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,479
that it was probably some weird
reflection on the water,

382
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:33,649
or that the bird was probably
stunned or sick...

383
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,151
<i>but not dead.</i>

384
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,452
Well... maybe they're right.

385
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:38,453
<i>Mark...</i>

386
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:39,756
I promise!

387
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,389
God <i>was</i> there.

388
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:42,725
Really?

389
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,761
I swear on the Bible itself.

390
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:46,696
Whoa!

391
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,765
This is so awesome!

392
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:50,265
Uh, I, I...

393
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,466
<i>believe you!</i>

394
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,202
That's what happened.

395
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:56,139
Um... but...
I wouldn't tell anyone,

396
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,975
because people will just think
I'm crazy, and...

397
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,510
Uh, gotta go.

398
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:02,745
I'll see you tomorrow.

399
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,580
All right.

400
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,950
Hi, honey.

401
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,484
Did you brush your teeth
and floss?

402
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,087
Sure did.

403
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,655
Good stuff.

404
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,860
Okay.

405
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,495
This is my favorite part
of the day.

406
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,666
All right, so,
you're gonna close your eyes

407
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,501
and then you're gonna think
about all the things

408
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:28,604
that you're grateful for
that happened today.

409
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,140
Mom?

410
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:33,709
Yes, sweetheart?

411
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:37,613
That bird really did come
back to life at the lake.

412
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:40,583
It was right after I saw God.

413
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:44,654
It wasn't some weird reflection
or anything like that, no.

414
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:50,660
It really was God,
and He spoke to me.

415
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,795
What did He say?

416
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,631
He said He'll be
taking me to Heaven soon.

417
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,003
Honey...

418
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:04,841
You have to die to go to Heaven.

419
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:09,344
I don't wanna die, but...
I wanna go to Heaven.

420
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,782
Well, I don't intend
on letting you go anywhere

421
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,549
for a very long time, okay?

422
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:16,886
You have a lot of time
to get to Heaven,

423
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,721
and when you finally go there,

424
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:20,590
you're gonna be
an old, old, old, old lady.

425
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:22,091
Much older than me.

426
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:24,392
Okay?

427
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:27,296
No more talk about dying.

428
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:29,866
All right,
you gotta get some sleep.

429
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,234
You have school
in the morning, okay?

430
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:32,235
So say your prayers.

431
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,769
Okay.

432
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:37,273
Can I got back to Grampa's
next weekend?

433
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,041
Only if you stop
letting your imagination

434
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,010
get the better of you.

435
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:42,510
Okay?

436
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:46,849
- Love you.
- Love you.

437
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:49,151
Sweet dreams, baby.

438
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,872
Mom, Dad.

439
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:12,108
Hey, buddy,
is everything okay?

440
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,943
I went to Sara's room
to see if she had my phone,

441
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,678
and she looks really sick.
You need to come.

442
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,545
- How sick?
- I don't know.

443
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,181
She's covered in sweat
and breathing pretty hard.

444
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,482
It's not good.

445
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,399
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey.

446
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:37,967
- Thanks for coming out so late.
- No, no.

447
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,835
No problem, I get it.

448
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:44,707
Oh, Ben, I'm so happy
that you're here.

449
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,309
She's been running
a really high fever,

450
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:48,543
and now she says
that she's nauseous.

451
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:49,979
All right, uh,
let me take a look.

452
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,315
Hi, Sara.

453
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,450
Can you tell me
how you're feeling right now?

454
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,953
- Not so good.
- Mm.

455
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,322
I feel really sick,
like I'm gonna throw up.

456
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:00,790
Don't you worry.

457
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:04,160
We're gonna fix you
right up, Sara.

458
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:05,493
I think she has a stomach flu.

459
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,363
Uh, it's going around.

460
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,265
Just keep her home tomorrow
and keep her hydrated.

461
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:11,634
Thanks, we will.

462
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,904
It's just that something
she said scared me.

463
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:18,240
What was that?

464
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:21,577
Go ahead, tell him.

465
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:25,547
When we visited my dad
at the lake,

466
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:27,817
she said she saw God...

467
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,253
and that He brought
a dead bird back to life.

468
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:33,322
Well, that, that just sounds

469
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:36,025
like she has a healthy
imagination to me.

470
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:38,127
But then she said
that God spoke to her...

471
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,563
and He told her He was gonna be
taking her to Heaven soon.

472
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,701
She's gonna be fine.

473
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:47,535
All right?
She's healthier than all of us.

474
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,871
It's nothing to worry about.

475
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:51,207
It's gonna be okay.

476
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,043
- Ben, thanks for coming out.
- All right, no problem.

477
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:56,012
Oh, and, you know, if she gets
worse, her temperature rises,

478
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:57,146
just call my office.

479
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,682
- Will do.
- Thank you.

480
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,287
Hey, peanut.

481
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,989
You feeling any better?

482
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:08,724
I think so.

483
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:11,027
Well, you get some sleep.

484
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,995
I'm sure you'll feel...

485
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:14,597
Oh... sorry.

486
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:21,837
Where'd you get this?

487
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:24,807
I drew it
when I came home tonight.

488
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,010
- You drew this?
- Yeah.

489
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:31,580
I drew it with the drawing kit
Grampa gave me for Christmas.

490
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:33,315
Huh.

491
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:37,253
Huh.

492
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:43,959
Sara, I, I've never seen you
do anything like this before.

493
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:45,461
Where'd you learn to do this?

494
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:46,929
I don't know.

495
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:48,563
I just felt like
trying to make a picture

496
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,232
of what I saw at the lake.

497
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:54,537
Sara, this isn't trying, this...
this is incredible.

498
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,739
- Thanks.
- Can I show this to your mom?

499
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,107
Sure.

500
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:02,078
Okay, well... we're gonna
keep you home tomorrow,

501
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,712
so you get some sleep.

502
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,449
And I...
promise to return it, okay?

503
00:25:06,582 --> 00:25:08,184
Good night, Dad.

504
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:09,285
Night, sweetheart.

505
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:31,340
Who did this?

506
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:34,477
Your daughter did.

507
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,047
No... she couldn't have.

508
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,915
But she did.

509
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,962
You didn't really miss
anything in class yesterday.

510
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:56,966
You know, same old stuff, and,
luckily, no math quiz either.

511
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,503
I felt fine, but my mom wanted
to keep me in bed all day.

512
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,873
So... I... drew you something.

513
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:05,609
Oh, yeah, like what?

514
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,613
Sara!

515
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:11,747
You drew this?

516
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:13,949
This is unbelievable!

517
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,819
Our art teacher could never
pull off a drawing like this.

518
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,054
- How'd you do it?
- I don't know.

519
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,857
I guess I just found
something I'm good at.

520
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:31,167
- Oh, man.
- Here are these fools.

521
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:34,403
Hey, Sara.

522
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:35,671
My cat died last week.

523
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,039
I was wondering
if you could stop by

524
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:38,274
and bring him back to life.

525
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:40,610
My frog died last night.

526
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:42,011
Could you bring him back too?

527
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,647
- Oh, so pathetic.
- I thought I told you

528
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,314
not to tell anyone
about what happened at the lake.

529
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:47,049
Oh, and I have
a goldfish!

530
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:48,751
Maybe if you changed
some water into wine,

531
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:50,186
we could get the fish
really drunk.

532
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,754
That would be awesome.

533
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:56,325
No one messes with
my little sister... no one.

534
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,993
What a weirdo.

535
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,368
Didn't your parents ever
tell you not to pick on girls?

536
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,871
Obviously not.

537
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:15,579
Weren't we always taught
that if someone wrongs you,

538
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:17,581
to turn the other cheek?

539
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:20,684
Well... they were certainly
taught something about a cheek.

540
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,952
Maybe that guy could tell you
more about it.

541
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:33,429
What the hell, man?

542
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,613
Oh... I got this.

543
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:53,415
Well, well, well...

544
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,619
if it isn't
the would-be soccer hero.

545
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:57,553
What's the matter, boy?

546
00:27:57,687 --> 00:27:58,954
You still trying to make up

547
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:00,756
for your pathetic game
the other day?

548
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,759
Wow, your dog is really pretty.

549
00:28:06,262 --> 00:28:07,796
Stay away from him, Sara.

550
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,466
The dog's probably
just as jacked up as his master.

551
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,800
Here.

552
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,908
And what are you
gonna do now, Hopkins?

553
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,844
Call a foul?

554
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:23,846
Come on, Danny,
let's get outta here.

555
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:26,650
I'm sure the air is fresher
on the other side of the street.

556
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:32,421
Yeah, that's right, Hopkins,
just run away.

557
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:33,922
Just keep hiding
behind the skirts

558
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:36,292
of your girlfriend
and your little sister!

559
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:44,768
Just run away, Hopkins!

560
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,503
You and that crippled kid too!

561
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:49,405
You know what?

562
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:52,141
Somebody ought to teach you to
keep your mouth shut, Brauner.

563
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,376
And who would that be?

564
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,946
Alvie, look out!

565
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:05,287
Man, what's the matter
with you?!

566
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:06,955
You almost took me out, fool!

567
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,824
Why weren't you
watching the road?!

568
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,392
Are you outta your mind?

569
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:19,602
Oh, no... no...

570
00:29:19,736 --> 00:29:21,870
No, no, no, no, no...

571
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:23,372
Nobby, get up, man.

572
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:24,473
Get up, Nobby.

573
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,342
Get up.

574
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,147
You killed my dog, man.

575
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,718
- You killed my dog, man.
- Alvie, hold up!

576
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,984
- It was an accident.
- I'm gonna break your head!

577
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:37,553
Calm down, man, back off.

578
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:39,021
That dog was my best friend,
and you killed him.

579
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,022
- Come on, man...
- That's it, man.

580
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,591
I'm gonna finish you.

581
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:43,025
You're not gonna help
anything by doing this.

582
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,194
Hey, tell her to keep her hands
off my dog.

583
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,930
- Come on...
- Don't.

584
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:52,534
Dear God... You helped
that little bird at the lake.

585
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:55,839
Can you please help
this poor dog too?

586
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:01,811
Our Father...
who art in Heaven...

587
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:04,647
hallowed be Thy name...

588
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:29,571
Go on.

589
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,724
And then...
when he just started breathing,

590
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,525
I just couldn't believe it.

591
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:53,630
I mean, I've never seen
anything like that.

592
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:55,931
Sara...

593
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,600
can I ask you something?

594
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:00,135
Sure.

595
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:02,938
Do you think
you could help me walk again?

596
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,940
I don't know.

597
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,375
Maybe.

598
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:11,480
Could you say a prayer for me?

599
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:25,461
God... Mark's a good guy.

600
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:28,330
He really is.

601
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:31,701
Maybe You could help him
walk again?

602
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:33,803
Could You do that, please?

603
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,948
I'll pray for you more
when I get home too.

604
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,649
See you, Mark.

605
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:48,217
Okay, thanks.

606
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,986
See you tomorrow.

607
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:07,369
Hey, you took me away
from my golf game.

608
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:09,973
So... tell me what this
medical emergency is all about.

609
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:13,509
I moved my toes this morning.

610
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:16,144
No, he really did, Doc.

611
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:17,914
Which foot?

612
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:19,314
Both!

613
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:24,453
Show me.

614
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:28,156
Ready?

615
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:36,298
Mark, uh... I, I don't know...
what happened,

616
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,001
but your
spinal cord injury isn't...

617
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:39,201
Wait!

618
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,403
Just... give me a chance.

619
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,874
Please.

620
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:10,065
Can, can you move
the other foot?

621
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:30,218
Here you go.

622
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:31,420
Thanks, Doc.

623
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,155
So, listen...

624
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:36,458
Doc, you really think
he's got a chance, right?

625
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:38,260
Look, I, I...

626
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,529
I can't explain what,
what happened in there...

627
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:44,533
but... severed nerves
in spinal cord can't regenerate,

628
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:47,235
and I just, I just don't want
to get your hopes up too much.

629
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:49,237
Oh, hey, Ben.

630
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:51,106
Hey, isn't...
that's Dolores Clark

631
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,141
from Channel 12 News, right?

632
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,444
Yes, she's, uh,
she's one of my patients.

633
00:33:57,614 --> 00:34:00,315
Mom?

634
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:04,921
Oh, my baby!

635
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:06,455
You're...

636
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:08,725
walking and...

637
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:09,993
He's standing!

638
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,261
He's walking, look at him!

639
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:15,064
It's a miracle!

640
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,833
Oh, my...

641
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:19,802
Oh, my baby.

642
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,604
Isn't that the Miller boy?

643
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:24,373
I did the story on him last year
when he was hit by that car.

644
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:25,842
I thought he was
never supposed to walk again.

645
00:34:27,677 --> 00:34:30,813
He, he wasn't.

646
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:34,584
It, it was Sara.

647
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,954
Sara Hopkins.

648
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:41,991
She speaks with God,
she brought a bird back to life,

649
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:45,260
and Alvie Brauner's dog,
and now...

650
00:34:45,394 --> 00:34:47,697
she's healed me!

651
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:51,533
Uh, Dolores...

652
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:52,969
Don't do it!

653
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:54,704
Are you kidding me?

654
00:34:54,837 --> 00:34:56,571
A little girl who brings dead
animals back to life

655
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:58,340
and then heals a paraplegic kid?

656
00:34:58,473 --> 00:34:59,676
Like that's not news.

657
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,309
Just get the facts first.

658
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:03,579
Well, I just did.

659
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,985
Come on... no!

660
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:10,787
Got you again.

661
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,954
Hi, guys.

662
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,891
Look who came to say hi.

663
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:17,292
Mom, you didn't have to
call the doctor.

664
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:18,961
I told you I was feeling better.

665
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:21,463
Yeah... yeah, we're here
on another matter, Sara,

666
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:26,401
but why don't I have a...
quick look at you anyway, okay?

667
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:27,670
How do you feel?

668
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:29,438
- Okay now.
- Mm-hmm.

669
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,941
Yesterday I came home
with a terrible headache

670
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:33,910
and I was tired all day.

671
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:36,478
Well, maybe you still have
a touch of the flu.

672
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:40,415
Sara... when was the last time
you saw Mark Miller?

673
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:41,718
Yesterday.

674
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,820
I walked home with him.

675
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:45,722
Did anything happen with Mark?

676
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:48,191
Anything unusual?

677
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:50,693
Well, he asked me
to pray for him,

678
00:35:50,827 --> 00:35:53,129
so I closed my eyes
and I asked God to heal him.

679
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:57,967
Mark Miller walked today.

680
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,534
Really?

681
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:03,371
Awesome, my prayers worked!

682
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:05,608
Yeah, seems like
he's gonna make a full recovery.

683
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:08,111
Can you tell us a little more

684
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:10,179
about what happened at the lake
the other day?

685
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:11,881
Sure.

686
00:36:12,014 --> 00:36:15,051
I was praying for a little bird
that Danny said was dead.

687
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:18,921
But then I saw God
floating over the lake

688
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:21,456
and I asked him to cure
the bird, and He did.

689
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,458
Do you speak to God often?

690
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:26,394
All the time, don't you?

691
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:28,296
Well... not directly.

692
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,734
Not even in church?

693
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:36,672
Look, um, it's, it's not healthy
or fair to other people

694
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:39,041
to pretend that you're actually
having conversations with God.

695
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:41,409
I'm not pretending.

696
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,813
Okay.

697
00:36:43,946 --> 00:36:46,215
Bring her
to the office tomorrow.

698
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:48,084
Fatigue and headaches
with someone her age, uh,

699
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:51,053
really need to be
examined, okay?

700
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:54,023
You need to talk to her.

701
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:55,758
I mean,
stories about healing birds

702
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:58,127
and making paralyzed boys
walk again

703
00:36:58,261 --> 00:36:59,862
is gonna turn her life
into a media circus.

704
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:01,731
Look, Ben,
I understand all of that,

705
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,365
but, seriously, do you have
a logical explanation

706
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:04,801
for Mark's recovery?

707
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:06,468
I can assure you there is one.

708
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,570
However, at the moment,
we have no idea what it is.

709
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:10,640
Don't be pouring fuel
on the fire, Jerry.

710
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,407
I mean, Sara doesn't need that.

711
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,243
Look, I, I don't know
exactly what happened,

712
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:17,079
but I do know Sara believes
everything she's telling us.

713
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,681
Look, I know she has
a very vivid imagination,

714
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:20,583
but she would never
outright lie.

715
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,084
She just wouldn't do
something like that.

716
00:37:22,218 --> 00:37:23,451
Let's, let's just keep this
between us

717
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:25,788
until we get
to the bottom of it, okay?

718
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:30,325
Right now,
I'm worried about her health.

719
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:35,397
See you tomorrow after school.

720
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,175
Hey.

721
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,679
Did you see Sara?

722
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:51,346
Yeah.

723
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,682
And?

724
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:55,550
She's just a little girl,

725
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:57,153
and she's got people
all riled up

726
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:59,055
with these make-believe stories
she's been telling.

727
00:38:00,223 --> 00:38:02,325
I know you're mad at Him.

728
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:03,860
At who?

729
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,161
God.

730
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:07,495
Oh, please.

731
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,803
Jesse was my son too, Ben.

732
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:16,571
But I'm not as strong
as you are.

733
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:19,342
Because if I quit
believing in God...

734
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:22,178
then I have to believe
that our son no longer exists.

735
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:24,814
I can't do that.

736
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:27,783
I'm not that strong.

737
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,586
And I don't think
you really are, either.

738
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,122
Sara doesn't need
you and everyone else

739
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:35,791
thinking that she's
an instrument of God.

740
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:37,392
Why not?

741
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:39,561
A little girl
with a strong faith

742
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:42,698
is something
that we could all use more of.

743
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:45,167
If there really was a God,

744
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:47,270
would He create a world
where parents have to watch

745
00:38:47,402 --> 00:38:49,605
their sons and daughters die?

746
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:54,442
Oh, great.

747
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,446
<i>...get up and walk.</i>

748
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:01,050
<i>He said a little girl,
Sara Hopkins,</i>

749
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:03,619
<i>held his hands
and prayed for him.</i>

750
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:06,289
<i>But can she really cure people
by praying?</i>

751
00:39:06,421 --> 00:39:08,958
<i>I'm afraid that's a bit hard
for me to believe.</i>

752
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:10,793
<i>Yet the real question is...</i>

753
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:14,230
<i>what do each of</i> you <i>believe?</i>

754
00:39:14,363 --> 00:39:16,232
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi.

755
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:17,532
What you doing?

756
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:20,435
Drawing.

757
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:22,570
Yeah...

758
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:24,307
Huh.

759
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:27,043
Uh...

760
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:29,812
Yes, you are.

761
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:34,750
Sara, sweetheart, look at me.

762
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:36,819
Yeah?

763
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:39,454
Uh, is there something that...

764
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:45,493
Never mind.

765
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,096
Tell me about your picture.

766
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,732
Do you know that little boy?

767
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,334
I'm not sure.

768
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:53,002
It just came to me, you know?

769
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:55,503
Almost like a dream.

770
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:58,573
But I do know that it's,
it's not a boy.

771
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,676
- Oh.
- It's a young girl.

772
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,045
Maybe from my school.

773
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,849
I think she wants to be
friends with me.

774
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,620
Yeah...

775
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:25,601
Theresa...
there's someone here to see you.

776
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:28,838
Uncle Alonzo!

777
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,876
I'll just be out
in the living room.

778
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,378
You two have fun.

779
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:44,387
Is there a story
that goes along with him too?

780
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,222
Oh, you bet.

781
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:51,160
Now, this guy... won the Grand
National Steeplechase twice.

782
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:54,529
He was so good,
they had to ask him to retire,

783
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:59,035
but he said he'd only do it
if he could live at your house.

784
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,404
Your stories are the best.

785
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:10,279
I just wish I'd be around
long enough to play with him.

786
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:18,687
I heard the doctor
telling Mom that...

787
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:21,490
my cancer is getting worse.

788
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:29,031
He said...
I don't have much time.

789
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,139
Am I going to die?

790
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:41,811
When did you hear this?

791
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:43,946
At the hospital today.

792
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,816
We don't have to talk about it
if it upsets you.

793
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:49,585
We can talk about it.

794
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:57,393
I'm just not sure what will
happen to me when I die.

795
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,899
Jesus said...

796
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,735
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

797
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:11,907
"He who believes in Me... will
live, even though he dies...

798
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:16,979
and whoever lives and believes
in Me... will never die."

799
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:19,682
Will my soul go to Heaven...

800
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:23,552
even if I'm really scared
of dying?

801
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:35,297
Everyone's afraid to die.

802
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:41,605
Even the bravest people.

803
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,141
Was Jesus afraid?

804
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,342
He was.

805
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:53,516
But He was comforted by knowing
that He would live again.

806
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:57,153
And you should feel
the same way too.

807
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:02,525
<i>So stay tuned
as we keep you up to date</i>

808
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:04,994
<i>on the miracles
of Sara Hopkins.</i>

809
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:06,762
<i>And now,
back to Frank McDonald.</i>

810
00:43:06,896 --> 00:43:07,897
<i>Thanks, Dolores.</i>

811
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,998
<i>Coming up next after the...</i>

812
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,003
Is this possible?

813
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,205
Could the little Hopkins girl
really be curing people?

814
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:19,909
Anything is possible
if it's the will of God, but...

815
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:22,478
But what, Alonzo?

816
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,547
- She doesn't have much time.
- I know.

817
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,850
But it's easy
to get your hopes up,

818
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:29,552
and then if Theresa
isn't healed...?

819
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:32,988
We have to try.

820
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:36,058
We have to take Theresa
to see Sara Hopkins.

821
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,767
She's here!
Sara's in there.

822
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,002
She's gonna help us.
She's gonna heal us.

823
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,144
Dad?

824
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:56,845
I think these people
want to see Sara.

825
00:44:00,883 --> 00:44:03,319
Oh, Lord.

826
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:05,354
I'll... go out
and ask 'em all to leave.

827
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:07,089
You can't, Daddy.

828
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:09,558
What if I was sick
and there was a possibility

829
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:12,629
you could do something
to help me?

830
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:14,930
But, Sara, didn't you say that
it wasn't you that healed Mark,

831
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:16,765
that it was his faith in God?

832
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:19,468
What if all those children
don't have that same faith?

833
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,904
What if they do?

834
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,539
Listen, sweetheart.

835
00:44:23,673 --> 00:44:27,042
You're just a little girl.

836
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:29,411
And if you go out there and all
those people are healed,

837
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,214
I'm afraid that...

838
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:33,515
I'm afraid that
you're not gonna get a chance

839
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,851
to be that little girl again.

840
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:37,253
Do you understand?

841
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,089
Daddy's right.

842
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:41,757
They're gonna keep coming
more and more.

843
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,993
It'll never stop.

844
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,828
Look, you haven't even had
breakfast yet.

845
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:47,263
Let's go in the kitchen,

846
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:48,632
I'll make you some waffles

847
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:50,299
and we can talk about it
some more, okay?

848
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:51,500
All right, come on.

849
00:44:52,736 --> 00:44:54,671
Come on, sweetheart.

850
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,418
Sara?

851
00:45:09,551 --> 00:45:11,655
Sara?

852
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,091
Look, folks, um...

853
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:19,528
we know what you've heard
about our daughter...

854
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:20,863
but it's just gossip.

855
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:22,632
It's stories
made up by the media.

856
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:25,769
Our little girl...

857
00:45:25,901 --> 00:45:27,569
she can't cure sick people,

858
00:45:27,704 --> 00:45:30,239
and I'm sorry that you
came out here, but...

859
00:45:30,372 --> 00:45:33,342
please, go back home.

860
00:45:33,475 --> 00:45:35,844
She's just a little girl.

861
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:39,181
She can't help us.

862
00:45:39,315 --> 00:45:40,816
Wait, wait.

863
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:56,098
You're the girl from my drawing.

864
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:57,866
Drawing?

865
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,869
You like horses, right?

866
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:06,141
Listen.

867
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:08,977
I did see God.

868
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:11,715
I don't know if I can help you,
but I did see Him.

869
00:46:33,202 --> 00:46:34,738
Thank you.

870
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:41,076
Mom, I'm gonna be okay.

871
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:55,891
Thank you.

872
00:47:44,373 --> 00:47:47,109
You have sandy hair!

873
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,812
You can see?

874
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:50,279
Look at me, Isabel.

875
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,147
Hi, Mommy.

876
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:15,672
- Oh, my God.
- What is happening?

877
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,050
Thank you for coming.

878
00:48:28,183 --> 00:48:31,821
Um... I have to go see
my parents now.

879
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:33,322
Move very carefully.

880
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:34,323
Are you okay?

881
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:35,692
Sara?

882
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,359
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Come on, baby.

883
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:39,261
Come on.

884
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:48,103
All right, look, uh,
we've done all the blood work,

885
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:50,138
and I've, uh,
called the hospital

886
00:48:50,272 --> 00:48:52,474
and scheduled her for an M.R.I.,

887
00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:55,077
so, uh,
they'll be waiting for you.

888
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,714
Doctor, after she prayed
for Mark Miller...

889
00:48:57,847 --> 00:48:59,983
she couldn't get out of bed
all day.

890
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:02,150
And, and now look at her.

891
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:03,753
I mean, she's so exhausted.

892
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,823
She's, like, wrung out.

893
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:11,293
You know...
you weren't there, but...

894
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:12,962
something really did happen.

895
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:17,466
A-Another boy in a wheelchair
stood up and walked.

896
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,969
A, a blind girl could see again.

897
00:49:20,102 --> 00:49:22,070
What's going on? How could
any of this be happening?

898
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,274
Let's, um... let's find out

899
00:49:25,407 --> 00:49:27,109
what's wrong
with your daughter first.

900
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:30,546
Then we can... figure out what
happened in your front yard.

901
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,114
Yes?

902
00:49:32,247 --> 00:49:33,850
Doctor,
I think there's something

903
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:36,619
you and the Hopkins need to see.

904
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,421
<i>...find out.</i>

905
00:49:39,555 --> 00:49:41,156
<i>Just hours ago,
standing right here,</i>

906
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,559
<i>miracles were
supposedly performed.</i>

907
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:45,695
<i>It's been said
that a blind girl can now see,</i>

908
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:47,664
<i>a paralyzed boy can walk,</i>

909
00:49:47,797 --> 00:49:50,566
<i>and a little girl with cancer
says she was healed.</i>

910
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,568
<i>But are these miracles real?</i>

911
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:55,437
<i>Is Sara Hopkins
a miracle worker?</i>

912
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:59,541
<i>We'll stick with this story
until we get the answers.</i>

913
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:05,113
Oh, no.

914
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:10,519
How'd they know we were here?

915
00:50:10,653 --> 00:50:13,121
She's all over the Internet too.

916
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:15,024
We need to get Sara
out of here.

917
00:50:15,157 --> 00:50:17,060
Take her to the hospital
and get those tests done.

918
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:19,194
You think you could stay at your
father's for a couple of days?

919
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:20,797
Yeah, sure.

920
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,297
But, you know, the press
probably followed us here

921
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:23,432
'cause they know our car.

922
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:24,968
Hey, well, I'm parked out back.

923
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,234
They wouldn't recognize mine.

924
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:27,837
Okay, great, um...

925
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:29,772
Honey, why don't you and Ben
go gather up Sara?

926
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:32,008
Danny, meet me around back,
we'll take her in your car,

927
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,676
and let's just hope
they don't recognize us

928
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,911
sneaking her out of here.

929
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:36,411
Oh, no worries, I'll stall 'em.

930
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:37,814
You think you can
handle the press?

931
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:39,048
Sure.

932
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,152
We can handle this, Dad.

933
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,927
Hi, Mrs. Hopkins.
I'm gonna go home.

934
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,327
Thank you for dinner.

935
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:54,329
Bye, honey.
Thank you for helping out.

936
00:50:54,463 --> 00:50:55,330
See you, Sam.

937
00:50:55,464 --> 00:50:56,699
Bye, Cindy.

938
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,473
Well...

939
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:06,508
you look tired.

940
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:11,146
I'm exhausted.

941
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:15,084
I can't even begin
to describe or understand

942
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:18,121
what happened with Sara
this morning at our house.

943
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:20,990
I don't know what to say.

944
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:22,759
I mean...

945
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:24,426
I know something happened,

946
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,698
but nothing like this
has ever happened in our family.

947
00:51:28,831 --> 00:51:30,565
It's about to turn her world
upside down,

948
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,469
and I don't think... anybody in
this family, least of all her,

949
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:36,806
is prepared for that.

950
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:39,642
But, Dad, I'm worried, because
ever since she said she saw God,

951
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:41,077
she just keeps getting sicker.

952
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:42,679
I have never seen her this ill.

953
00:51:42,812 --> 00:51:44,847
I'm really worried that this is
something very serious.

954
00:51:50,252 --> 00:51:53,355
- Oh, it's the doctor.
- Okay.

955
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:54,991
Hello?

956
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:57,894
Hi, Ben.

957
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,163
And what, what did they say?

958
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:04,834
What?

959
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,242
Yes?

960
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:15,678
What?

961
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:18,181
Oh, my gosh.

962
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:20,549
Thank you.

963
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:52,447
I know You can hear me.

964
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,086
You heard me in 'Nam.

965
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,455
You could have probably heard me
down to the house too, but...

966
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,060
I thought maybe...
this place'd have some...

967
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:06,629
special meaning to You, so...

968
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:08,965
I came here to say my piece.

969
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:15,270
I know I got no right...
to ask You to hear me...

970
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:17,874
or to... show Yourself, or...

971
00:53:19,274 --> 00:53:22,779
I know who I am.

972
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:24,914
I know what I've done.

973
00:53:26,448 --> 00:53:30,820
I drank too much,
I fought all the time.

974
00:53:32,054 --> 00:53:37,760
In the army... I did things.

975
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:40,830
But, still, I got married.

976
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:42,999
I was a good husband.

977
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:46,501
I worked every day, I pounded
sheet metal for 40 years,

978
00:53:46,636 --> 00:53:49,471
and I had a beautiful daughter.

979
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:52,742
And my wife took her to church
all the time.

980
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:57,345
Now... I just don't know
exactly where Sara was

981
00:53:57,479 --> 00:54:00,448
when she saw You...

982
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:03,886
but I want You to know I would
be in that spot if I could.

983
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,323
Lord... oh...

984
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:11,459
she's such a beautiful child.

985
00:54:11,594 --> 00:54:16,199
She is... she is so much better
than I ever was,

986
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:19,434
and You know
she always loved You.

987
00:54:19,568 --> 00:54:22,271
From the time she could talk,
she would ask me,

988
00:54:22,404 --> 00:54:24,941
"Does He cut
His fingernails, Grampa?

989
00:54:25,074 --> 00:54:27,542
Does He shave like you do?"

990
00:54:27,677 --> 00:54:29,377
What was I to say?

991
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:36,518
I... I said, "Honey... He gave
you life, He must love you."

992
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:42,557
I don't understand!

993
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:45,527
I just, I just don't understand

994
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,864
why You would make her
so perfect

995
00:54:47,997 --> 00:54:50,666
and then
snatch her away from us!

996
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,336
I do not understand it!

997
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:58,573
God... I am asking You...

998
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:03,045
No... I'm begging You.

999
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:05,248
Please don't do this.

1000
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,252
Please don't do this,
don't take Sara!

1001
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:12,121
If You need somebody, take me.

1002
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:16,225
Stop my heart right here,
it's okay.

1003
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:19,729
But please don't take Sara.

1004
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,570
Oh, God...

1005
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:35,077
- Morning.
- Morning.

1006
00:55:35,211 --> 00:55:37,412
- Come in.
- Thank you.

1007
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:47,590
- Uh, is Sara here?
- Yes.

1008
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:50,425
Uh, you know, I think it'll be
better if we talk in private.

1009
00:55:50,558 --> 00:55:52,762
Of course.
I'll go get Alex.

1010
00:55:56,832 --> 00:55:58,968
"...and deeper and deeper
into the wild Tinker went..."

1011
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:00,970
Hey, Danny?

1012
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:03,072
Can you please take Sara outside
for a little bit?

1013
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:05,107
I think
she could use some fresh air.

1014
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:07,610
Uh, yeah, we can do that.

1015
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,477
Um... can we go to the lake?

1016
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:11,614
No, no, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

1017
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,416
Please, Mom.

1018
00:56:13,548 --> 00:56:16,185
Honey, I'll take you someplace
after, someplace really fun.

1019
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,654
- Okay?
- Okay.

1020
00:56:18,788 --> 00:56:19,855
Come on, let's go.

1021
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,962
Ah, okay.

1022
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:29,932
Let's see...

1023
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:35,738
ah... if you can take me...
at this... right here.

1024
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:37,306
Ah.

1025
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,442
Okay.

1026
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:42,144
You ready?

1027
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:44,479
You take one of these,
and then...

1028
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:48,684
Nice...!

1029
00:56:48,818 --> 00:56:52,188
Okay, um... your turn.

1030
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:53,789
You hold that.

1031
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:56,158
And we're gonna
scoot up for you.

1032
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:59,862
Okay, just look at the can...
and throw it.

1033
00:57:15,778 --> 00:57:18,347
Is there anything else
you want to do?

1034
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:22,084
I know the doctor's here
to talk about me, so...

1035
00:57:22,218 --> 00:57:24,519
I just wish I knew
what he was saying.

1036
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:28,024
Well... why don't we keep
playing the game?

1037
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:30,893
I'll tell you what...
for every can you knock down,

1038
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:33,362
you get a free hour on my phone.

1039
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:35,164
Deal?

1040
00:57:35,297 --> 00:57:39,468
Will you just set up a lot more
cans so I have more of a chance?

1041
00:57:39,602 --> 00:57:41,103
Sure.

1042
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,440
All right, so...

1043
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:45,708
here's a few more.

1044
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:47,843
These are bigger targets, uh,

1045
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:49,178
and you can shoot
from a closer spot too.

1046
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,946
I think that'll help, Sara.

1047
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:54,850
Sara?

1048
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:00,555
So you feel that
these tests are comprehensive?

1049
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,058
Dr. O'Connor's
been reviewing the scans

1050
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:03,558
of Sara's brain.

1051
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:06,062
He sent them out
for three other opinions,

1052
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:07,596
and they all feel that,

1053
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,733
because of the size and location
of the tumor,

1054
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:13,202
that surgery
would just be too risky.

1055
00:58:13,335 --> 00:58:16,238
Too risky... and...?

1056
00:58:16,372 --> 00:58:19,909
And he's saying that...

1057
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:24,046
Sara's brain tumor
is inoperable.

1058
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,249
Yes, that's, that's,
that's what it means.

1059
00:58:27,383 --> 00:58:30,619
And he also believes that
the tumor could be causing...

1060
00:58:30,753 --> 00:58:32,388
the hallucinations.

1061
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:36,225
That's why she thinks she sees
God when no one else does.

1062
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:38,894
But what about
the children that she cured?

1063
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:42,898
Power of suggestion,
you know, a placebo effect.

1064
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:45,334
What are you saying,
that this is the result of,

1065
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:47,636
of a kind of mass hypnosis?

1066
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,139
A handicapped child
walked again,

1067
00:58:50,272 --> 00:58:52,308
a blind girl
regained her eyesight,

1068
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:55,811
and another little girl is sure
that Sara cured her cancer,

1069
00:58:55,945 --> 00:58:57,313
for crying out loud.

1070
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:58,714
Jerry, there are
documented cases

1071
00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:00,216
that explain
these types of healings.

1072
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:02,218
I mean, in, in 2004,
there was a man

1073
00:59:02,351 --> 00:59:05,254
who had tumors the size of
grapefruits throughout his body,

1074
00:59:05,387 --> 00:59:07,156
and he had
less than two weeks to live.

1075
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:10,159
He took a substance that he
believed would cure cancer,

1076
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:12,628
and four days later, the tumors
completely disappeared.

1077
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,964
So it's in the realm
of possibility

1078
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:18,400
that this is
what happened to those children.

1079
00:59:18,534 --> 00:59:22,138
Okay, okay, we can talk about
those other children later.

1080
00:59:22,271 --> 00:59:24,807
What other options do we have?

1081
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:27,543
There are
no other options, Bonnie.

1082
00:59:27,676 --> 00:59:28,944
I'm sorry.

1083
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:35,351
No... other options?

1084
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:38,988
Wait, are... are you saying...

1085
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:42,925
Sara has more faith
than any child I've ever met.

1086
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:45,694
I don't think anyone
can say for certain

1087
00:59:45,828 --> 00:59:48,564
when she is going to die.

1088
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:55,037
Are you saying...
my little girl's gonna die?

1089
00:59:57,306 --> 01:00:00,543
Ben, just tell us the truth.

1090
01:00:00,676 --> 01:00:02,678
Sara's dying.

1091
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:10,786
Wait, there, there, there must
be, like, a special hospital

1092
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,723
or, or some, some new,
experimental treatments.

1093
01:00:14,857 --> 01:00:16,425
Something that we can do.

1094
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,396
If there was... anything I
could do, Bonnie, believe me...

1095
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:22,331
I would.

1096
01:00:22,464 --> 01:00:26,936
So, we have to...
we have to tell her.

1097
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:30,239
How do I tell my little girl
that she's gonna die?

1098
01:00:30,372 --> 01:00:31,740
I don't want to lose her, honey.

1099
01:00:31,874 --> 01:00:33,075
I can't stand it.

1100
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:34,577
I love her too much.

1101
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,979
She's my baby...

1102
01:00:37,112 --> 01:00:39,315
I can't...

1103
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:42,017
It's okay, Mommy.

1104
01:00:42,151 --> 01:00:43,519
Oh, Sara.

1105
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:45,689
I just don't want you to cry.

1106
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:47,556
Stop crying.

1107
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:50,192
Oh, honey... I'm so sorry you
had to hear all of that too.

1108
01:00:50,326 --> 01:00:52,261
Please, stop crying.

1109
01:00:52,394 --> 01:00:54,930
Really, it's okay.

1110
01:00:55,064 --> 01:00:57,533
I heard what Dr. Riley said
about me dying.

1111
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,535
- Oh...
- Just, I don't want you

1112
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:02,238
to be sad, okay?

1113
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:05,241
It's okay, 'cause if I go
to Heaven, I'll be with God.

1114
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:12,348
Sweetheart...

1115
01:01:12,481 --> 01:01:14,216
I love you.

1116
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:16,018
I love you this much!

1117
01:01:16,151 --> 01:01:20,489
I love you this much
and even more.

1118
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,928
Mom, Dad, I don't want to go
to the hospital.

1119
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:29,298
I want to go back to the lake...

1120
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:31,934
and I want to see God again.
Please?

1121
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:36,038
I... oh... but...

1122
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:38,040
We have to go
to the hospital, okay?

1123
01:01:38,173 --> 01:01:39,808
That's where
they'll make you comfortable.

1124
01:01:39,942 --> 01:01:42,712
I know, but I want to go
back to the lake.

1125
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:45,781
I want to ask God
if I can wait to go to Heaven

1126
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:48,752
and stay with you guys
till I grow up.

1127
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:52,154
Honey? Honey? Oh, no.

1128
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:53,989
- Look at me.
- Oh, no, oh, no.

1129
01:01:54,123 --> 01:01:57,326
We need to get her
to the hospital, right now.

1130
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:05,501
Grampa, please take me
to the lake.

1131
01:02:15,311 --> 01:02:16,979
Oh, my God, is she here?

1132
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:20,549
Do you have everything we need?

1133
01:02:20,684 --> 01:02:22,217
Relax, I got everything
taken care of.

1134
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,153
- All right, all right.
- Hey, hey, here they come!

1135
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:28,658
Danny, can you tell us the
status of your sister's health?

1136
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:31,293
Is this
some sort of grave illness?

1137
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:32,895
How, how's she doing?

1138
01:02:33,028 --> 01:02:34,798
How's your mom?
Cindy! Cindy!

1139
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,132
Give us an update of some kind.

1140
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:44,506
Hey...

1141
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:47,176
I thought...
you might want to draw me

1142
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:49,813
one of those Rembrandts
you've been coming up with.

1143
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:51,213
Thanks, you guys.

1144
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:53,750
Danny?

1145
01:02:53,882 --> 01:02:57,186
I wanted to know what it's like
to date someone...

1146
01:02:57,319 --> 01:02:59,521
and... to be in love.

1147
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:01,523
The way you and Cindy are.

1148
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:08,230
Well... um...

1149
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:10,966
it's great.

1150
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:15,839
You always look forward
to being with one another.

1151
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:17,674
You share stuff.

1152
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:20,744
I mean, feelings and things.

1153
01:03:20,876 --> 01:03:23,912
It's tough to explain it.

1154
01:03:24,046 --> 01:03:27,015
When you start dating,
you'll find out.

1155
01:03:27,149 --> 01:03:30,252
I don't think I'm gonna
live that long, Danny,

1156
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:35,924
and... I think it's something
I'm really gonna miss.

1157
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:48,437
Is there anything
we can do for you?

1158
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:52,007
You can sing the
"Believe in You" song for me...

1159
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:55,377
like we did in the car.

1160
01:03:57,379 --> 01:04:01,150
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

1161
01:04:01,283 --> 01:04:04,052
♪ So give me a sign ♪

1162
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:08,090
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

1163
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,627
♪ Just give me more time... ♪

1164
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,763
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

1165
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:19,368
♪ But You have to believe...
in me. ♪

1166
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,912
How's my beautiful angel?

1167
01:04:29,044 --> 01:04:31,146
Hey, sweetheart.

1168
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:44,594
Uh... we're gonna step out
for a while, but...

1169
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:47,296
we'll be right back.

1170
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:55,137
We love you so much.

1171
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:15,792
Wipe your feet.

1172
01:05:19,228 --> 01:05:21,263
Now take a seat.

1173
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:24,767
Thank you all for coming.

1174
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:27,637
Theresa has something to say.

1175
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:35,845
Last week,
when Sara was helping

1176
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:37,881
those children
outside her house...

1177
01:05:38,013 --> 01:05:40,549
I felt something.

1178
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:44,453
I also saw it.

1179
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:47,624
It was a spiritual figure
floating next to Sara,

1180
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:52,494
holding out His hand to touch
the children she was touching.

1181
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:57,332
After she prayed for me...

1182
01:05:57,466 --> 01:06:01,270
I felt... different...

1183
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:06,943
and warm...
for the first time in two years.

1184
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:08,410
Healthy.

1185
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:13,583
I knew I'd been cured...

1186
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:18,220
and I also know
that I was seeing God.

1187
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:21,691
Everything Sara told us
was true.

1188
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:24,894
She wanted so much
to help people and...

1189
01:06:25,028 --> 01:06:27,864
and now we have to help her.

1190
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:33,068
Thank you, Theresa.

1191
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:39,107
All right, Mac and I
have worked out a plan...

1192
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:42,477
and it's liable to get
a whole bunch of people upset.

1193
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,079
And by a whole bunch of people,

1194
01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:48,017
I mean Dr. Riley,
I mean your parents,

1195
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:51,253
and I mean about everybody
at the hospital.

1196
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:53,790
The last thing
Sara said to me was

1197
01:06:53,923 --> 01:06:56,926
she wanted to go
back to the lake.

1198
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,962
I know that
that's where she had her vision,

1199
01:06:59,094 --> 01:07:01,163
I know that's where
her healing comes from.

1200
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:05,200
I have to think that she knows
something that we don't know,

1201
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:06,903
something that could help her.

1202
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:10,405
I don't know, but I do know

1203
01:07:10,539 --> 01:07:12,775
I'm gonna see
that she gets her last wish.

1204
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:16,311
I'm taking Sara
back to the lake tonight.

1205
01:07:16,445 --> 01:07:18,413
Oh, we're in.

1206
01:07:18,547 --> 01:07:20,950
She helped to cure my baby.

1207
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:23,218
We're gonna do
everything we can to help her.

1208
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:24,787
I can't explain the miracles

1209
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,090
that have taken place
through Sara,

1210
01:07:27,222 --> 01:07:29,124
but if she wants
to go back up there,

1211
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:32,127
I believe it is God's will
for us to help her.

1212
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,696
I agree with you, Pastor.

1213
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,699
Sounds good to me, I'm in.

1214
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:39,836
But there's reporters and people

1215
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:41,536
all around
the outside of the hospital.

1216
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:44,439
And inside, she's surrounded
by not only my parents,

1217
01:07:44,573 --> 01:07:46,609
but the entire hospital staff.

1218
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:49,177
They're not gonna let us
take her out of there.

1219
01:07:49,311 --> 01:07:51,146
We need a major plan
to spring her.

1220
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:53,415
Exactly.

1221
01:07:53,548 --> 01:07:54,817
Maria's been working part-time

1222
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:57,854
as a night nurse
up at the hospital.

1223
01:07:57,987 --> 01:08:02,257
She has this pass,
which'll open almost any door.

1224
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:09,032
So this is what I'm thinking...

1225
01:08:41,898 --> 01:08:44,734
It's okay, honey.

1226
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,937
We're here, we're all here.

1227
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,080
Hey, kids, can I talk to you
in the waiting room a minute?

1228
01:08:57,212 --> 01:09:00,248
Why not in here?

1229
01:09:00,382 --> 01:09:04,120
It's okay,
I need some more coffee anyway.

1230
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:13,996
The room's clear.

1231
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:17,734
<i>Dr. Kravitz,</i>

1232
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:19,902
<i>you have a visitor
in the main lobby.</i>

1233
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:26,709
Hey... we're gonna get you
outta here...

1234
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:33,916
Okay, we have to get this done
very carefully.

1235
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,585
Any break in the pulse rhythm

1236
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:36,953
will bring the whole
nursing staff right in here.

1237
01:09:37,086 --> 01:09:41,456
One, two, three...

1238
01:09:44,761 --> 01:09:45,995
Okay.

1239
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:17,425
Excuse me, but my,
my friend here isn't...

1240
01:10:17,559 --> 01:10:19,327
feel-feeling very well.

1241
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:20,963
What are your symptoms?

1242
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:23,232
I don't know, I, I just,
I feel so dizzy and...

1243
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:24,432
I think I'm gonna faint.

1244
01:10:24,566 --> 01:10:26,002
- Well, let's get you...
- Oh...

1245
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:27,804
Lay down.

1246
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:37,747
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor
in the main lobby.</i>

1247
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,682
<i>Dr. Kravitz...</i>

1248
01:10:39,816 --> 01:10:41,717
<i>...a visitor in the main lobby.</i>

1249
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:43,853
Where are we going?

1250
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:46,222
Taking you to the lake.

1251
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:11,314
We're good!

1252
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,884
All better now, thanks!

1253
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:18,654
Hey, you forgot your bag!

1254
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:21,858
Thank you!

1255
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:25,328
Look, Sam, we can't do
something like that.

1256
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,462
You heard what the doctor said.

1257
01:11:27,597 --> 01:11:29,564
I know you both disagree,

1258
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,667
but I'm gonna honor
that last request.

1259
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:33,435
Dad, no!

1260
01:11:33,568 --> 01:11:35,238
I know how much you love her,
but we are not taking her

1261
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,707
back to that lake...

1262
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,643
...especially
on a night like this.

1263
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,388
How's she looking?

1264
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:54,891
Looks like she's sleeping again.

1265
01:11:55,024 --> 01:11:58,361
Honey? Sweeth...

1266
01:11:58,493 --> 01:12:00,363
What the... what is this?

1267
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:01,764
Where's Sara?

1268
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:02,965
Um...

1269
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:05,668
Dad! Dad?

1270
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:06,869
Oh, my...

1271
01:12:07,003 --> 01:12:08,070
What is going on?

1272
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:09,605
- Um... well...
- Where's Sara?

1273
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,207
We thought that she wasn't
comfortable here,

1274
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,775
so we decided
to take her down...

1275
01:12:12,909 --> 01:12:14,243
To the lake?!

1276
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:16,245
Kinda...

1277
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:19,547
Did you see Sara Hopkins
leaving Room 12?

1278
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:20,716
She couldn't have.

1279
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,218
Her pulse monitor is still on.

1280
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:24,353
You might want to check again.

1281
01:12:24,486 --> 01:12:26,122
You really think
they're going to the lake?

1282
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:27,857
Yeah, this is all Dad's doing.

1283
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,959
Him and that stupid, crazy idea
of taking her back there!

1284
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:39,101
Go! Go! I'll follow ya!

1285
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:06,095
I don't think I can take
this much excitement!

1286
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:07,630
Yeah?
Hold on to your hat,

1287
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:10,199
'cause there's gonna be
a lot more of it!

1288
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:22,445
Hey! The Hopkins girl just left,
headed up I-60!

1289
01:13:22,577 --> 01:13:24,413
- I-60?
- Yes!

1290
01:13:24,546 --> 01:13:25,948
- All right, let's go, let's go!
- Let's go!

1291
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:38,694
Can you see okay?

1292
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:41,330
It'll be all right, honey.

1293
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:43,699
We'll be there soon.

1294
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:04,086
Oh, man, if we stop, we're sunk.

1295
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,822
But, Danny, you have to stop,
it's the police!

1296
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:16,098
Okay, we're gonna have to
cut these guys off, Mac.

1297
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:18,566
Oh, Lord, forgive him, for he
knows not what he's doing!

1298
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:19,969
Hold on!

1299
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,041
Car! Car!

1300
01:14:28,344 --> 01:14:29,912
Oh... oh...

1301
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:33,716
Isn't that Sam Donovan's truck?

1302
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,718
Sure looks like it...

1303
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:38,487
This is not gonna sit real well
with the cops.

1304
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,156
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1305
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:41,891
Aren't you going about as fast
as this truck can go?

1306
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:44,760
It's not about going fast,
it's about slowing down.

1307
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,602
What's the matter with that guy?
Has he gone nuts?

1308
01:14:53,736 --> 01:14:55,604
Oh, Lord,
I hope they don't hit us.

1309
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:57,039
What?!

1310
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:58,707
Sam Donovan, pull over!

1311
01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:00,575
<i>You're obstructing justice</i>

1312
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:02,044
and interfering
with a police pursuit!

1313
01:15:06,082 --> 01:15:07,716
We're losing them!

1314
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:08,951
Danny, be careful!

1315
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:11,387
The road is so wet, slow down!

1316
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,489
Don't worry, I got this.

1317
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:20,196
Oh, Heavenly Father, please
let them be lenient with us.

1318
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:22,465
How many years you think
we're gonna get for this?

1319
01:15:22,598 --> 01:15:23,933
I don't know, Mac,

1320
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:26,402
but enough to brush up
on my Bible reading!

1321
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:34,376
- Who's this now?
- Beats me,

1322
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:37,279
but between the speeding,
illegal passing and tailgating,

1323
01:15:37,413 --> 01:15:39,281
looks like we're gonna have to
run half the town in.

1324
01:15:39,415 --> 01:15:40,716
I'm gonna call for backup.

1325
01:15:42,785 --> 01:15:45,254
Is that Sam
up ahead of the police?

1326
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:46,956
Looks like it.

1327
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:48,757
Are you sure you should be
tailgating this close?

1328
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:50,226
I'm trying to see
what he's up to.

1329
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:52,995
We're going a lot slower
than when we started.

1330
01:15:53,129 --> 01:15:54,797
That's because
he's helping Danny get away.

1331
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,099
Dude is awesome!

1332
01:16:09,613 --> 01:16:10,614
No...

1333
01:16:10,746 --> 01:16:12,348
No, this can't be happening!

1334
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:14,316
We have to get her up there!

1335
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,452
Here they come!

1336
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,289
Can you carry her up?

1337
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:23,325
Probably not in the storm,
not alone.

1338
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:29,532
What are you doing here, man?

1339
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,333
You're trying to get your sister
up to the lake, right?

1340
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:33,402
Yeah, but the road's blocked,

1341
01:16:33,536 --> 01:16:35,204
and I don't know
how much time she has.

1342
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,006
Cops are right on our tail.

1343
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:39,175
We can take a shortcut through
Mason's Hill, it's quicker.

1344
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:41,477
The mountain?
We'll never make it!

1345
01:16:41,611 --> 01:16:43,445
Come on, dude, we can do this!

1346
01:16:47,783 --> 01:16:51,020
For saving my dog, I owe you...
big time.

1347
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,322
Come on, we gotta go,
we gotta get out of here.

1348
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:54,490
Go, go, go.

1349
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,585
Where's Sara?

1350
01:17:21,717 --> 01:17:23,085
Alvie and Danny have her.

1351
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:24,420
They started up the hill!

1352
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:25,655
Let's go.

1353
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,490
Donovan!
Hold it right there!

1354
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:30,694
You're not going anywhere!

1355
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:33,162
You've broken just about
every traffic law there is,

1356
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:35,497
not to mention
hindering a police pursuit.

1357
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:37,166
You're under arrest.

1358
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:38,602
We're impounding your vehicle

1359
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:41,170
and escorting you
to the station.

1360
01:17:41,303 --> 01:17:43,839
Listen,
my granddaughter is dying!

1361
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:45,874
You mean the kid that's been
curing all those people?

1362
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:48,277
Yes, and the last thing
she asked me

1363
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:51,847
was to take her up to the lake
before she passes,

1364
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:54,250
and the doctors say
it could be tonight.

1365
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:55,884
You know where I live,

1366
01:17:56,018 --> 01:17:58,320
you can arrest me
on the way down,

1367
01:17:58,454 --> 01:18:00,556
but I'm taking her up there now.

1368
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:07,429
Harrow, no sense
making things worse.

1369
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:22,845
It's not just Donovan,
the whole town's gone nuts!

1370
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:41,997
Oh! Ooh!

1371
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:43,966
No, no, no, no, don't come back,
don't come back!

1372
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:46,502
Keep going, Sam, keep going!

1373
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:48,003
Pastor Mac, are you okay?

1374
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:49,905
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1375
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:00,710
Good boy, Nobby!

1376
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,187
- You're gonna be okay.
- Lay her down here.

1377
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:14,556
Here, here, here, here.

1378
01:20:14,691 --> 01:20:15,792
You're okay.

1379
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:20,562
Sara, we're here.

1380
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:23,132
Do you want me to pray with you?

1381
01:20:23,265 --> 01:20:24,400
Our Father...

1382
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:26,034
who art in Heaven,

1383
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:29,538
hallowed be Thy name...

1384
01:20:31,006 --> 01:20:32,842
Is she still with us?

1385
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:34,711
Barely.

1386
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:49,124
Sara! Sara? Sara?

1387
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:52,027
Hold on, Sara... oh, God...

1388
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:53,897
Hold on, sweetheart.

1389
01:20:54,029 --> 01:20:55,564
Oh, no... no, no...

1390
01:20:55,698 --> 01:21:00,536
Oh, baby, sweetheart...
I love you, I love you...

1391
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:01,805
I love you so much.

1392
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:04,006
Oh, sweetheart...

1393
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:07,242
Dad, you knew that the doctors

1394
01:21:07,376 --> 01:21:08,812
wanted to keep her
in the hospital.

1395
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:10,179
How could you bring her here,

1396
01:21:10,312 --> 01:21:12,514
especially on a night
like tonight?!

1397
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:14,584
If something happens,
it's your fault!

1398
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:17,821
This is your fault!
All of you!

1399
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:19,421
All of you had a hand in this!

1400
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:21,290
Why couldn't you just
leave her alone?

1401
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:23,492
She's such a good girl, all she
wanted to do was help you,

1402
01:21:23,626 --> 01:21:25,628
and now she's...

1403
01:21:25,762 --> 01:21:27,496
Oh, no... oh, no...

1404
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,465
Sara?
Sara, sweetheart?

1405
01:21:29,599 --> 01:21:30,667
- Sweetheart?
- Come on, sweetheart.

1406
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,168
No...

1407
01:21:33,302 --> 01:21:35,337
Please, don't leave us.

1408
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:22,210
Oh... oh...

1409
01:23:49,504 --> 01:23:52,274
Hey, did you get any of that?

1410
01:23:54,911 --> 01:23:57,145
There's nothing there.

1411
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,883
It's blank.

1412
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:13,930
All right, Ed,
you can take me in.

1413
01:24:14,063 --> 01:24:16,131
It's okay, Sam.

1414
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:18,635
Maybe you had
a good reason for speeding,

1415
01:24:18,768 --> 01:24:20,937
even in the eyes of the law.

1416
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:24,306
Your granddaughter get to do
what she wanted?

1417
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:27,175
More than you'll ever know.

1418
01:24:27,309 --> 01:24:28,711
Thank you.

1419
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:34,216
Eddie, are you seeing this?

1420
01:24:34,349 --> 01:24:36,385
It was one of the strongest
storms of the year,

1421
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:39,454
yet none of the people
who went up there are wet.

1422
01:25:45,621 --> 01:25:47,757
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:55,765
I know... nothing we can say
will bring you comfort...

1424
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:59,702
but we all know
where Sara is now.

1425
01:25:59,836 --> 01:26:03,338
Safe in God's hands.

1426
01:26:07,242 --> 01:26:10,213
Dad...

1427
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,823
Dad, I'm sorry
for what I said at the lake.

1428
01:26:20,957 --> 01:26:22,290
I know how much you loved her,

1429
01:26:22,424 --> 01:26:25,161
and you were just trying
to fulfil her wish.

1430
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:26,394
And, and you knew something

1431
01:26:26,528 --> 01:26:28,097
that none of us
could understand,

1432
01:26:28,231 --> 01:26:30,398
so I... thank you
for doing that for her.

1433
01:26:38,107 --> 01:26:40,575
Dad.

1434
01:26:55,258 --> 01:26:56,759
Must've been
the last picture she drew.

1435
01:26:56,893 --> 01:27:00,562
I... I think she knew
God was coming for her.

1436
01:27:00,696 --> 01:27:04,167
That's beautiful.

1437
01:27:04,299 --> 01:27:07,435
I'll have it framed
and hung up in church.

1438
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:15,244
Danny...
Danny, look at this...

1439
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:20,149
Mom! Dad!

1440
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:24,720
<i>This</i> is
the last picture she drew.

1441
01:27:24,854 --> 01:27:26,022
She's coming back!

1442
01:27:26,155 --> 01:27:29,659
That means that, maybe...

1443
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,030
God...

1444
01:27:34,163 --> 01:27:37,200
...are You gonna
let Sara come back to us?

1445
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:39,669
- Oh, Danny...
- Can You?

1446
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:41,737
- Will You, will You, please...
- Danny...

1447
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:43,572
Please, let Sara
come back to us?

1448
01:27:43,706 --> 01:27:46,742
- Sweetheart, I'm sorry...
- Please, God.

1449
01:27:46,876 --> 01:27:49,645
- Will You, please?
- You got to let her go.

1450
01:27:49,779 --> 01:27:51,814
- Sara, please?
- I'm sorry, darling...

1451
01:27:51,948 --> 01:27:53,783
- Please, Sara, please...
- I'm sorry...

1452
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:55,618
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

1453
01:27:58,921 --> 01:28:01,456
Sara? Sara!

1454
01:28:01,591 --> 01:28:03,025
Oh, my...

1455
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:05,628
- Oh!
- Sara! Sara...

1456
01:28:05,761 --> 01:28:07,864
Oh...

1457
01:28:07,997 --> 01:28:10,333
- Sara?
- Hi, Mommy...

1458
01:28:10,465 --> 01:28:11,968
Daddy...

1459
01:28:13,102 --> 01:28:14,136
Sara!

1460
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,304
Honey, how are you?

1461
01:28:19,474 --> 01:28:22,712
It's a miracle!

1462
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:27,016
I told God that I didn't think
I was ready to go to Heaven

1463
01:28:27,149 --> 01:28:29,517
and He told me to come back here
and take care of you.

1464
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:34,290
Oh, my... my baby...

1465
01:28:34,422 --> 01:28:37,425
Oh, my baby, you're alive.

1466
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:39,595
You're alive.

1467
01:28:39,729 --> 01:28:40,963
I love you so much.

1468
01:28:42,832 --> 01:28:47,502
Thank You, God, thank You, God.

1469
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:48,470
Thank You, God.

1470
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:50,339
It, it, it's not possible.

1471
01:28:50,472 --> 01:28:54,343
She wasn't breathing, there was
no, there was no pulse.

1472
01:28:54,476 --> 01:28:56,746
You're beginning to catch on.

1473
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:11,761
It's a miracle!

1474
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:26,943
No, don't kneel.

1475
01:29:27,076 --> 01:29:31,948
I'm just a... lucky girl
who God decided to visit.

1476
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:35,985
It... could've been
any one of you.

1477
01:29:36,118 --> 01:29:39,355
He still may come back
to see one of you,

1478
01:29:39,487 --> 01:29:41,791
just like He did with me.

1479
01:29:47,797 --> 01:29:51,867
Please, get up...

1480
01:29:52,001 --> 01:29:57,773
and... now you all
need to believe something.

1481
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:01,844
I can't cure anyone anymore.

1482
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:04,647
But... I wasn't the one

1483
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,984
who really cured people
in the first place.

1484
01:30:08,117 --> 01:30:10,319
It was God.

1485
01:30:10,453 --> 01:30:14,657
He just told me what to do
and... I did it.

1486
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:15,925
The truth is...

1487
01:30:16,058 --> 01:30:18,327
all of you can cure people.

1488
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:21,330
You really can.

1489
01:30:21,464 --> 01:30:25,401
All you have to do is
believe in God and pray to Him,

1490
01:30:25,533 --> 01:30:28,371
and He'll help you.

1491
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:31,974
Sometimes...
we can't see it right away.

1492
01:30:32,108 --> 01:30:34,877
Or sometimes the answer

1493
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:37,079
isn't exactly
what you've prayed for, but...

1494
01:30:37,213 --> 01:30:39,415
He's listening.

1495
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:44,186
And soon you'll see how kind
and how wonderful He is.

1496
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,521
He's the best.

1497
01:30:49,658 --> 01:30:52,328
He told me to tell you...

1498
01:30:52,461 --> 01:30:58,401
to... love your children
and your families,

1499
01:30:58,533 --> 01:31:02,204
and to try to help one another
every day.

1500
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:07,977
So...
when you all go home tonight...

1501
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:10,880
say a prayer
and ask what you can do

1502
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:15,418
to make your family strong
and to help other people.

1503
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:18,687
God <i>will</i> help you, because...

1504
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:22,391
well...

1505
01:31:22,525 --> 01:31:25,194
He loves you all...

1506
01:31:25,327 --> 01:31:27,296
a lot.

1507
01:31:42,244 --> 01:31:44,447
...and, well, the expression,
"God works in mysterious ways"

1508
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:46,248
certainly rung true
in our community

1509
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:48,317
over the last week or so.

1510
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:50,986
As a matter of fact, on that
country road the other night,

1511
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,923
I was certain <i>I</i> was gonna meet
my maker... several times.

1512
01:31:57,726 --> 01:32:00,262
For all of us, each in our own,
different way,

1513
01:32:00,396 --> 01:32:04,800
I think God has opened a door,
has shown us a little light,

1514
01:32:04,934 --> 01:32:08,037
has shown us that His arms were
around us, around our friends,

1515
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:10,873
our family, both in this life
and in the next one.

1516
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:13,909
Can you feel Jesse with us?

1517
01:32:14,043 --> 01:32:17,079
You know, uh... I can.

1518
01:32:20,116 --> 01:32:25,087
So, some of us who have been
witness to... modern miracles

1519
01:32:25,221 --> 01:32:29,191
can get a small taste of what
it was like to be an apostle.

1520
01:32:29,325 --> 01:32:32,862
For in their presence was
the one continuing miracle,

1521
01:32:32,995 --> 01:32:34,663
the miracle
that we can all choose

1522
01:32:34,797 --> 01:32:38,267
to accompany us
through our lives...

1523
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,169
the presence of God.

1524
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:57,653
See, Daddy?

1525
01:32:57,786 --> 01:32:59,421
It's like Jesus said.

1526
01:32:59,555 --> 01:33:05,161
Faith as small as a mustard seed
can grow and spread,

1527
01:33:05,294 --> 01:33:08,598
and soon become big enough
to move mountains.

1528
01:33:10,634 --> 01:33:12,701
