But you don't have to worry
about that, do you...

00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:39,288
chocolate drop?

163
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:41,991
Who'd you sell crack to?

164
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:46,394
Your sister? Your aunt?
Your baby mama?

165
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:50,031
I bet you think you and me
are the same.

166
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,599
Best believe
I'll bust your black ass

167
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:55,238
just as quick as I'd bust
that white bread cracker
standing next to you.

168
00:13:57,844 --> 00:14:00,078
And who the fuck
are you supposed to be?

169
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,213
What's your fucking name?

170
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:07,184
Billy Powers.

171
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,352
Billy Powers...

172
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:14,488
Welcome to the jungle,
motherfucker.

173
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:22,231
What the fuck are you
telling me right now?

174
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:25,903
- I'm not really sure,
Pauly.
- Why is that?

175
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:29,775
I guess because
I'm short on information.

176
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,875
- You're short?
- On information, yeah.

177
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:36,175
Well, I need you
not to be, Dom.

178
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:38,617
I can't even
fucking repeat that.

179
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,051
I'll find out
what happened.

180
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:43,686
Well, that's good.
That's really fucking good.

181
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,025
- Yeah.
- This?

182
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:49,655
- Not good, Dom.
- I know that.

183
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,831
Well, it's good
you fucking know.
That's good.

184
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:54,094
I hope you also know
that this is on you.

185
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,068
This is your fucking fault.

186
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,506
Go. Go fucking
take care of it.

187
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,568
You give me fucking<i> agita.</i>

[bird cawing]

189
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,048
Sorry, was that
cook a friend of yours?

190
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,712
What happened?

191
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:19,991
If it's okay with you,
maybe we can skip
the pleasantries.

192
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:22,529
I've been kidnapped,
I'm walking back to the car.

193
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:23,592
Let's just leave it
at that.

194
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:27,495
You don't have
to put your hands up.
That's great.

195
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,796
- This is obviously
an awkward situation.
- Yes.

196
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,965
Well, I figured maybe if I knew
a thing or two about you,

197
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,007
- it wouldn't have
to be-- Right.
- It won't be awkward. Okay.

198
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,476
I'm Lola.
I've said that already.

199
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:43,982
I moved to Costa Rica
a few years ago to open
an acting school

200
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:46,686
because living here
reminded me of two things...

201
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,917
failure and trauma.
Anything else?

202
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:51,153
[stammering] You, uh--

203
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:52,892
You opened
an acting school
in Costa Rica?

204
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:55,160
- It didn't work out.
- That's shocking.

205
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,629
I'm sorry about all this.

206
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:06,534
Okay.

207
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,375
[exhales sharply]

208
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:18,348
Wasn't your car
right here?

209
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:25,652
Fuck, I give up.

210
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:31,328
Just fuck it all, man!
Just fucking... fuck!

211
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,796
Are you fucking crying?

212
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:42,537
- I'm really not a criminal.
- Yeah.

213
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:45,238
- I'm getting that.
- I'm trying to do right
by my son.

214
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:47,375
That's all I'm trying to do.

215
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,247
This poor fucking kid
never had a chance.

216
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:51,513
You think I'm an asshole?
You should meet his mother.

217
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:55,448
If you want to run now,
or walk, or whatever,

218
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:56,951
I'm not gonna hold it
against you,

219
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,454
so you can go ahead.

220
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,690
Well, are you
just gonna sit there?

221
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:07,199
No, I'm either
currently wanted
for murder, or I'm...

222
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,133
Yeah, I'm gonna be murdered
by the guys who hired me

223
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:11,500
to murder the guy
I did not murder.

224
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:14,404
So, yeah, sitting here seems--
seems like the move.

225
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:22,775
You got any better ideas?
I'll take any suggestions.

226
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:28,550
Maybe I can help you.

227
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,056
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I wouldn't do that.

228
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:34,257
You're a big scary man
with a gun.

229
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,195
Also, pretty sure
you're out of bullets.

230
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:40,595
Why would you help me?

231
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:43,862
Maybe we can
help each other.

232
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:51,603
I should have my fucking head
examined for trusting
this idiot again.

233
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,839
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

234
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,774
It's my fault.
It was your fault
10 years ago,

235
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,118
when you told me he'd throw
the fucking fight.

236
00:17:58,153 --> 00:18:00,481
It's my fault for listening
the second time, okay?

237
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:03,581
Fool me once,
shame on you.
Fool me twice...

238
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,955
It's just
that we grew up together.

239
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:07,491
He used to be a smart fuck.

240
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:10,762
- I don't know what happened.
- I just said it was my fault.

241
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,232
You want to get me hot?

242
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:16,631
Yeah, but you said
it was your fault
for listening to me,

243
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,631
which kind of makes it my fault
if you think about it.

244
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,302
I don't want to fucking
think about it.

245
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,238
That's what I'm saying,
Dom, okay?

246
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:23,935
Now you want to get me
fucking hot?

247
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,113
You want to get me fucking hot,
or you want to let it go?

248
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,275
- Fine.
- Thank you, that is fine.
Thank you.

249
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,711
Now tomorrow, first thing,

250
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:32,912
I want you to go and see
that fucking degenerate cowboy

251
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,648
and see if you can straighten
this fucking out, all right?

252
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:38,650
Who knows? Maybe it's all
for the best.

253
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:42,191
- You did the right thing.
- What?

254
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:43,696
You did the right thing,
I'm saying,

255
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,826
having
the guy clipped.

256
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:48,728
He owed you 100 grand
for six weeks.
You did the right thing.

257
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,532
Are you being
a fucking wise ass
right now?

258
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:54,274
- Are you fucking with me, Dom?
- What do you mean?

259
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:56,335
What do I mean?
What do you mean,
what the fuck do I mean?

260
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:59,846
It didn't fucking work.
It didn't work. What do you
mean, "I had him clipped"?

261
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,344
- I'm just saying.
- Don't say.

262
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,475
I don't want you
to fucking say,
all right? Do!

263
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,910
I don't want you
to fucking say.

264
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:07,679
In retrospect, I would like
to have my hundred stacks,

265
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:10,685
- if that's okay with you.
- I got it.

266
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,559
Good. Now, tomorrow
first thing,
you go out there

267
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:17,225
and you take care
of this fucking thing
with this cowboy.

268
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:18,627
Hopefully,
with some success,

269
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:22,694
and then I want you to find
that fucking cunt Jackie

to bring him to me directly.

00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:27,438
Are we fucking clear?

272
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,471
- Yeah, yeah. We're clear.
- Yeah, yeah.

273
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,279
What the fuck
is going on with you?

274
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,853
[Jackie] What's happening?
What's happening?

275
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,253
What the fuck
are you doing?

276
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,255
- What are you doing?
- Why are you hiding?

277

No one knows that I work
at that fucking diner.

- I'm being fucking discreet.
- Oh, discreet!

279
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:50,562
And pertaining to the others
of concern, one's dead

280
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:52,560
and for all we know,
the other might have
killed him, okay?

281
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:54,363
- Shh!
- Just relax.
Oh, don't shush me!

of your fucking neighborhood,

working at that shithole?

and I get to go back
to Costa Rica and pay
my mortgage.

You gonna say anything

Okay, why are we

it's the sole condition
of my mother's will.
