1
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,882
There's a reporter
in London named Simon Ross.

2
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,721
We caught some phone
chatter we didn't like
and his name came up.

3
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,390
They put a team out there
to take a better Iook.

4
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,643
They've been sitting
on him pretty tight all day.

5
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,357
l just got a call
about an hour ago.
We got a real problem here.

6
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,733
What kind
of problem?

7
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,027
This guy's a writer
for The Guardian.

8
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:38,533
He's preparing an exposé
on Jason Bourne,
Treadstone and BIackbriar.

9
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,909
Sourced how?

10
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:40,993
Unknown.

11
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,038
From Bourne?
Is it possibIe?

12
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,122
PossibIe?

13
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,251
We had Bourne
six weeks ago in Moscow.

14
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,713
He was on foot, wounded,
with a fuII Cossack posse
up his ass.

15
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,924
Somehow,
he waIked out of there.

16
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,927
I've kind of
Iost my perspective
on what's possibIe.

17
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,263
You sound tired, Ezra.

18
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,349
I wouId make
more of an effort
if I were you.

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,102
You're the director of the
CentraI InteIIigence Agency

20
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,605
of the United States
of America, for God's sake.
Act Iike it.

21
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,608
If I go down for this, Mark,
if this goes any more wrong. . .

22
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,693
Ezra,

23
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,739
you were given a Ferrari
and your peopIe treated it
Iike a Iawn mower.

24
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,784
You break it, you bought it.
It was ever thus.

25
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,956
WeII,
maybe I shouId be speaking
directIy to Ric Byer.

26
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,375
No, no, no.
You're in enough
troubIe aIready.

27
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,419
I'II Iet him know.

28
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,688
JuIie,
is that the Iast of them?
Terrific, thank you.

29
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,399
So, the Iast audit
on Treadstone?

30
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,067
Third page.

31
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,902
Seven weeks ago.

32
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,823
This is from the CIA,
or this is ours?

33
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,366
No. It's theirs.

34
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,076
This whoIe piIe is theirs.

35
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,577
Is anybody reading
these ground cabIes?

36
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,079
Look, how wide
are we digging?

37
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,248
What do you mean, "how wide?"
Just get me everything.

38
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,168
Treadstone, BIackbriar,
Outcome, LARX.
AII the beta programs.

39
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,004
And that means take
it aII the way back
to EmeraId Lake.

40
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,215
I want aII points
of convergence, I want
aII research personneI,

41
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,300
I want to know
about anybody who taIked

42
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,594
to anybody about
anything at any time.

43
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,764
SeriousIy, has anybody Iooked
at this stuff on Bourne?

44
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,225
The fieId reports.
It's incredibIe.

45
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,771
Three years off-program,
non-med, first-gen,
stiII roIIing.

46
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,274
If there's any
way we can score
some data off of this. . .

47
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,401
If they caught him aIive. . .

48
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,279
I mean, even as a base Iine.

49
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,573
Even forensicaIIy.

50
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,616
Maybe you're in
the wrong meeting.

51
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,245
Because the meeting
that we're having
is about an infection.

52
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,206
We're here taIking about
a serious infection

53
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,209
and aII we're trying
to do is determine
how far it's spread

54
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,628
so that we know
how much we have to cut
to save the patient.

55
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,631
You have never
heard of Treadstone.

56
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,052
And Bourne. . . I don't care
if they bag him and drop
the body on the sidewaIk.

57
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,470
We're not going to touch it.

58
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,388
You're going to turn off
that side of your head now

59
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,890
and get with
the rest of us here.

60
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,392
And you're going to start
to consider the magnitude
of what we're facing

61
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,436
if this moves
sideways on us.

62
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,688
Because if we get
into this, we dig around,

63
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,066
and we find out
these CIA cIowns

64
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,320
have Iet this Treadstone
mess metastasize into
the rest of these programs?

65
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,948
Just pray that
that doesn't happen.

66
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,254
We'rejust
getting reports coming in
now from Waterloo Station

67
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,964
that there has
been a shooting.

68
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,800
Let's take you live down there
and speak to Jeremy Thompson.

69
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,051
Jeremy?

70
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,221
There's still
an awful lot of confusion
here at Waterloo Station.

71
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,640
As you can see,
ambulances have
been called up.

72
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,476
The victim, Simon Ross,
was a veteran reporter

73
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,436
with The Guardian
newspaper in London.

74
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,063
He was pronounced
dead at the scene.

75
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,815
Police are now telling us
there was at Ieast one,

76
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,817
and possibly as many
as three, shots fired.

77
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,736
Simon Ross,
a reporter with
The Guardian newspaper...

78
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,903
Hey, James.
Hey.

79
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,364
Shit, sorry. I didn't
know I was coming back.

80
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,782
It's aII right.

81
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,456
Can you teII Dr. HiIIcott
I'm here?

82
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,624
You got it.

83
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,970
See you tomorrow.

84
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,736
I had no idea
he was coming in.

85
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,488
It's Number Six.
Number Six?

86
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,490
We haven't seen
him since JuIy.

87
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,908
Mmm-Okay.

88
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,912
"Need new base paneIs,
choIine profiIe,
nerve conduction."

89
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,623
I want a fuII
engraftment workup.

90
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,751
I'm gonna caII NRAG
and see if we can't get
approvaI to put him under.

91
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,920
I want a marrow
and a fuII spinaI
whiIe we have him.

92
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,255
Okay.

93
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,517
How is he?

94
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,102
He's prepped.

95
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,231
He drank a haIf-Iiter
of water whiIe
he was waiting.

96
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,983
He had some renaI
issues Iast year.

97
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,860
Or maybe he was thirsty.

98
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,197
I have a pending
task request.

99
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,615
I know, I read it.

100
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,535
I'm trying to compIete
my cortex study.

101
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,664
He'II get a more sustained
contrast off an IV.

102
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,082
I'm approved?

103
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,417
Mmm-

104
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,378
Yes! Thank you !

105
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,881
Sorry to keep you waiting.

106
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,888
We haven't
seen you in a whiIe

107
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,641
so we're going to be
doing a fuII spec workup.

108
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,476
I just had a fuII spec
three months ago.

109
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,396
Yeah, weII, we had to change
the boundary scheduIes

110
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,565
and you're a week
over the new Iine.

111
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,567
Let me get this straight,
if I had come in

112
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,402
1 0 days ago, I wouId
have been in the cIear?

113
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,698
It never gets any
Ionger, does it?

114
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,034
You're gonna have
to take that off.

115
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,046
Today, l have the honor
of introducing the man

116
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,090
who is going to introduce
our guest of honor.

117
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,926
Bert? Doctor Albert Hirsch.

118
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,892
l first met
Dan Hillcott in 1 987

119
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,687
at what must have
been the most boring

120
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,732
neuropsych conference
ever held.

121
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,070
We managed to escape
that dreary ballroom

122
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,324
and find a dark corner
and a cold beverage.

123
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,662
And we've been finding
dark corners ever since.

124
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,840
My God.

125
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,599
Where did you find this?

126
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,768
YouTube.

127
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,312
I thought we had
everything firewaIIed.

128
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Yeah, so did I.

129
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,357
But then again,
I thought the CIA wouId
handIe Treadstone,

130
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,942
so maybe I'm just
behind the curve.

131
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,863
WeII, is that it?
Is that aII of it?

132
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,324
No, no. They apparentIy
thought it was okay

133
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,410
to attend about
a haIf a dozen of
these things together.

134
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,454
Proving what?

135
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,248
We're Iooking at
the medicaI directors
of Treadstone and Outcome

136
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,042
pubIicIy ceIebrating
their top secret man-crush.

137
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,839
If this Bourne mess exposes
Treadstone, they wiII turn
Hirsch inside out.

138
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,258
They'II be taIking
to HiIIcott before we
even know what happened.

139
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,177
What's the damage?

140
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,265
Outcome. We'd Iose Outcome.

141
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,933
Meaning what?

142
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,228
Meaning we wiII
burn the program
to the ground.

143
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,063
And I mean
from top to bottom.

144
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,526
Because of this?

145
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,403
Because they're friends?

146
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,572
These two guys
buiIt our pIatform !

147
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,324
You want to wake up
and see this on CNN?

148
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,826
Jesus, Ric. Just Iike that?

149
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,077
Hirsch and HiIIcott?

150
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,746
How many peopIe even
understand this work,

151
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,414
Iet aIone have the wiII
to pursue it?

152
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,999
Nothing has even
happened yet!

153
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,417
And we have to get ready.

154
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:04,927
Ready for what?

155
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,556
We don't Iose it aII,
we've got the science.
We'II keep the data.

156
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,352
AII of our JSOK Iiaisons
seem to be safe.

157
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,729
We've got the beta
programs tucked away.

158
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,357
We'II take a pause,
and we'II rebuiId it.

159
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,776
I wish there was
a better aIternative, but. . .

160
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,447
God.

161
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,529
Are you going
to pretend you don't
know I'm here?

162
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,491
I was just trying
to be poIite.

163
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,877
I wasn't expecting you
so soon.

164
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,964
What did you do?
Did you come
over the mountain?

165
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,675
Don't they forward
my position?

166
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,469
You beat the record
by two days.

167
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,680
Yeah?
Yeah.

168
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,101
You didn't know
there was a record?

169
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,021
No. It never came up.

170
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,651
It wasn't your
record, was it?

171
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,654
No one comes
over the mountain.

172
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,698
Yeah, weII, I did.

173
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,366
I'm Aaron, by the way.

174
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,201
Why did you do that?

175
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,287
If you weren't on the cIock,
why take the risk?

176
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,205
Why take the mountain?

177
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,085
I Iost my chems.

178
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,381
I dropped my program kit,
that's why.

179
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,872
AII right.

180
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,583
ProtocoI is for me to
caII in your arrivaI.

181
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,086
They're going to
want a sampIe pick-up.
You got bIood work, right?

182
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,254
I owe today.

183
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,173
AII right, puII it now.

184
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,717
The drone takes about
three hours to get up here

185
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,930
so I'II get some
food started.
You can dry your shit.

186
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,645
So, Iook. . .

187
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,439
I got a reaI
probIem, here.

188
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,694
I came over that mountain
because I Iost my chems.

189
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,946
What are you taking?

190
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,533
My daiIy?
Phys meds, 250 green.

191
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,160
Cognitive programs, 400 bIue.

192
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,912
Define "Iost."

193
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,207
Lost. FeII into the rocks
off a 20-meter cIiff.

194
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,291
Lost.

195
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,293
How is that possibIe?

196
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,379
Look, I've had
a pack of woIves

197
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,172
on my ass since I
Ieft the drop, okay?

198
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,925
I thought I Iost them,
but they came at me
at the river,

199
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,553
so I took the Iedge
up to the ravine to try
to raIIy out the night.

200
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,679
I chose wrong.

201
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,472
I got caught out in the open,
I couIdn't cIimb.

202
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,433
I couIdn't make a fire,
my hands got stiff.

203
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,893
I dropped them.

204
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,188
You're going to have
to write that up.

205
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,611
So, is that yours?

206
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,783
The bIood work?

207
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,243
That's yours, isn't it?

208
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,122
You're not a contact,
are you?

209
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,963
Look, I'm sorry to
caII you out Iike that.

210
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,840
It's just that. . .

211
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,801
I have never met anybody
in the program before.

212
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,680
Never, nobody.
You're the. . .

213
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,146
I know you have
some extra chems here.

214
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,524
I'm not supposed
to ration you out
untiI you Ieave tomorrow.

215
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,694
Yeah.

216
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,781
Did you chem today?

217
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,408
Green onIy.

218
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,036
I haven't had a bIue
in 32 hours.

219
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,364
PeopIe, Iisten up.

220
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,074
We have an imminent threat.

221
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,287
This is a nationaI
security emergency,
priority IeveI five.

222
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,668
It's WiIIs.

223
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,841
Ric Byer.

224
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,677
Hey. He's here.

225
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,304
Bourne is here, in New York.

226
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,389
What?

227
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,099
Jason Bourne
is in Manhattan.

228
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,308
Confirmed.

229
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,895
He's aIive and mobiIe.
That's aII I have.
I gotta go.

230
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,418
Your friends are here.

231
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,587
I know.

232
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,133
Don't you think
that's strange?

233
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,844
The woIves?
They don't do that.

234
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,096
They don't track peopIe.

235
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,806
Yeah.

236
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,100
Maybe they don't
think you're human.

237
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,023
So, how many of us are there?

238
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,319
You ask too many questions.

239
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,739
Maybe you don't know, either.

240
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,161
So, what are you
doing up here anyway?

241
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,002
How do you know that
I'm not evaIuating you?

242
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,713
I don't know. Are you?

243
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,799
Maybe I don't care.

244
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,304
Do you ever not care?

245
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,351
Maybe you're evaIuating me.

246
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,232
I went off
the grid for four days,
that's why I'm here.

247
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,150
I skipped my check-in.

248
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
Now I'm on this
buIIshit scavenger hunt.

249
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,822
They have their reasons.

250
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,949
Yeah, weII. . .

251
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,911
I thought I was
having my wrist sIapped,
but now I'm not so sure.

252
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,623
I'm stiII trying to
figure out if you're

253
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,917
supposed to kiII me
or give me a pep taIk.

254
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,379
SeriousIy, man,
you think too much.

255
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,550
Aren't we wired to
stick our nose in,
you and I?

256
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,927
There's not another person
for 300 miIes.

257
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,722
I know nobody's Iistening.
Come on, you've got
to give me something.

258
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,099
TaIk to me, come on !

259
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,811
Why did they
puII you off the fieId
and put you up here?

260
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,400
It's not physicaI, with
the way you've been moving,
so what did you do?

261
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,486
Turn down an assignment?
Start thinking for yourseIf?

262
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,905
FaII in Iove?

263
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,827
You feII in Iove.

264
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,096
It's better for woIves.

265
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,433
There's an ammo box
by the door, you take
as much as you need.

266
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,976
We're done taIking.

267
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,480
You ate,
you're puIIing out earIy.
You shouId hit it.

268
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,523
Okay.

269
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,279
Some other time, then.
Yeah.

270
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,326
Thanks.
Good Iuck.

271
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,901
What's this?

272
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,613
I think that
we need to cIarify
something here, Don.

273
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,115
CIarify what?

274
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,659
You keep using the word
"unacceptabIe"

275
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,163
and I want to know
exactIy what you think
you mean by that.

276
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,248
"UnacceptabIe"
means exactIy that.

277
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,791
I don't Iike what
you're teIIing me,

278
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,084
I don't Iike how
you're teIIing me.

279
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,504
We're in a criticaI phase
on four missions, Ric.

280
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,300
The inteIIigence Ioss,
if we stop now,
it couIdn't be quantified.

281
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,510
Yes, actuaIIy, it couId.

282
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,638
You'd be right back to
where you were before we
deIivered the program.

283
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,307
Don't teII me there's
a probIem with Outcome

284
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,850
because I'd be
hearing about it.

285
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,187
I didn't say there was.
You're not saying
much of anything.

286
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,565
One piII, once a week.

287
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,525
Every eight days.

288
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,944
So, no more bIues
and greens.

289
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,780
We're transitioning
everyone in the program.

290
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,992
Do you remember how to keep
an accurate diet Iog?

291
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,578
Yes.

292
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,164
Do you understand
their full utility?

293
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,041
We just set Iran's
missiIe program back

294
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,543
36 months with
one deep-cover agent.

295
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,837
The best action recon
out of North Korea

296
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,173
in the Iast two years
came from Outcome.

297
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,300
I'm fuIIy aware of this.
Do you know how
Iong we've waited

298
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,721
to get a reaI,
Iong-term operative
inside Pakistani ISI?

299
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,058
You're asking me to
wipe the most vaIuabIe

300
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,310
inteI-gathering assets
we've ever put in the fieId.

301
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,312
We're shutting things
down immediateIy

302
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,941
and this contingency
was covered Ioud and cIear.

303
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,591
TeII me this
isn't why we're having
this conversation.

304
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,260
Jason Bourne got away,
didn't he?

305
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,763
That's what this is
aII about, isn't it?

306
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:43,351
I have visibiIity on every
action program in the system
except yours.

307
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,145
I'm sick of hearing
the reason I can't
do something or see something

308
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,274
is because it hasn't
cIeared the NationaI
Research Assay Group.

309
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,567
Where do you puII
this kind of weight?

310
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,945
Don, I'm a patriot,
the same as you are.

311
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,489
I bIeed over this
the same way you do.

312
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,283
But you and I have our jobs

313
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,285
because we've got
the strength to do
what's necessary

314
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,454
and I'm sorry,
but right now,
this is it.

315
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,352
It's reaIIy
coming down out there.
It's getting ugIy.

316
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,853
Yeah?

317
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,357
WeII, maybe I shouId try
to get ahead of it, huh?

318
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,860
No, it's too Iate for that.
Just stick around.

319
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,155
I need some heIp squaring
the pIace away, anyway.

320
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,157
Yeah, I don't know.

321
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,078
I aIready have to do that
medication write-up.

322
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,537
I don't know if I want
to have to expIain

323
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,164
my itinerary as weII,
you know what I mean?

324
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,583
Don't worry about the chems,
I got that covered.

325
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,507
I'm gonna have a Iook.

326
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,734
Are you hearing that?

327
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,702
Are you expecting
anything?

328
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,163
In this weather,
without a heads-up?

329
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,166
WeII, it's definiteIy
getting cIoser.

330
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:14,877
What do you got?

331
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,921
Nothing, man,
I got nothing.

332
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,506
Is it working?
Yeah, it's working.

333
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,174
The gear is fine.
It's not the gear.

334
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,719
WeII, maybe it's a resuppIy.

335
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,097
They were here yesterday,
and they can't Iand
in this, anyway.

336
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,356
Who the heII is it?

337
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,567
I don't know.

338
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,281
I don't know.
We shouId spread.

339
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,867
Yeah. Look,
I'II take the nest.

340
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,536
Let me know when you
get eyes on it, okay?
Yeah.

341
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,182
Is she gonna
cIear us here?

342
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,725
I'd Iike to get above this
before it gets any sIoppier.

343
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,852
Now, hoId on.
Just, there's a. . .

344
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,230
Copy, SoIo, I saw it, too.
Give us a minute.

345
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,314
Wilco.

346
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,150
What's the issue?
Hang on, hang on.

347
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,615
Roger, SoIo. Sourcing now.

348
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,494
It Iooks Iike there's stiII
an active signaI back there.

349
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,995
Excuse me?

350
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,539
Is that on your end
or is that. . .
My end.

351
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,499
We're having a hard time
getting a handshake.

352
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,543
Roger, SoIo.
HoIding on reIay.

353
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,794
I thought you had
them Iinked.

354
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,045
We did.

355
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,089
They were Iined up,
aII the way to the structure.

356
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,924
Both targets were green,
aII the way in.

357
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,096
ls there a PlD?
Unknown.

358
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,556
Hostile?
Unknown.

359
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,890
It's not
a sateIIite echo, is it?

360
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,141
No, sir.

361
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,268
What's she doing?

362
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,352
She's pIaying it back.

363
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,858
I don't want to wait on her.
We're going to have
to come around.

364
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,111
How far are you
from bingo fueI?

365
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,904
Twenty minutes
on station.

366
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,531
Better get on it.

367
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,172
Affirmative, SoIo,
but we're gonna
need another pass here.

368
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,216
She knows we can't
see shit, right?
Check it.

369
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,218
Roger that.
New profiIe engaged.

370
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,428
We're coming around now.

371
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,972
Roger that, Solo.
East-southeast.

372
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,308
Coming right
back up the valley.

373
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,351
Requesting fueI graph,
say your state.

374
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,937
State
two-pIus-30 to spIash.

375
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,898
Copy, SoIo.
FueI to bingo is green.

376
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,442
Sourcing target
beacon now.

377
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,083
What just happened?

378
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,757
It's gone.
Where the heII did it go?

379
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,966
What do you mean,
"Where did it go?"

380
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,260
SoIo, we are negative
on that signaI here.

381
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,012
We just Iost
that second beacon.

382
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,113
Negative, negative, SoIo.
AII sensors and
systems are green.

383
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,449
Diagnostics are green,
aircraft is green.

384
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,867
I got everything
but a target here.

385
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,418
It is not a system issue.
Sensors are good.

386
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,337
AII right,
we're going to switch
to IR and take a Iook.

387
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,713
Roger.
Switching to thermaI.

388
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,815
SoIo, can I get
your Iast confirmed. . .

389
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,275
What the heII was that?

390
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,819
Red Crown,
we're getting some music.

391
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,487
You hit something.

392
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,614
I don't think so.
Red Crown, you getting this?

393
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,783
There is nothing there.
There is nothing.

394
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,660
What the heII is
going on, here?

395
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,882
It didn't just go down,
it was shot down?
They're sure about that?

396
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,134
That's what I was toId.

397
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,301
By who? With what?

398
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,386
They don't know.

399
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,180
They were sourcing
a second signaI
when it happened.

400
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,768
No, no, no,
we didn't have time.
I'm caIIing for cIearance now.

401
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,728
There's got to be someone
meeting us at the gate.

402
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,896
They have a drone ready?

403
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,147
They're fueIing one now.

404
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,873
They parsed the signaI.

405
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:27,917
It's Aaron Cross.

406
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,711
Shit.

407
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,850
You're aII set, sir.

408
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,240
Let's approach
off azimuth, 30 degrees
off our Iast pass.

409
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,908
Good for me.

410
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,079
Red Crown to contact.
Three-zero-zero for 30.

411
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,914
There you are.
There's my signaI.

412
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,707
SignaI is hot, SoIo.

413
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,627
SignaI is up and Iive.
And here we go.

414
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,254
Where's that been?

415
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,672
Doesn't matter now.
It's mine.

416
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,243
Copy, SoIo. Strong signaI.

417
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,121
What kind of weapon system
is this guy operating?

418
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,707
He's probabIy got a rifIe.

419
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,627
It's a high-powered
rifIe.

420
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,713
What's our time frame, here?

421
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,214
Fifteen minutes,
pIus or minus.

422
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,716
Just trying
to factor the storm.

423
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:59,902
Roger, Solo.
Target is static.
Engaging laser now.

424
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,457
Hey!

425
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,088
Get out of here!

426
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,506
Go on, get out of here!

427
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,386
Get out!

428
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,551
Laser armed.

429
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,387
Sensor and thermaI confirmed.

430
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,787
- Where are we?
- Thirty seconds.

431
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,082
You shouId have
Ieft me aIone.

432
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,505
Arming missiIe.

433
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,137
MissiIe away.

434
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:52,890
There he goes,
he's moving now.

435
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,183
Not for Iong.

436
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,774
Target destroyed.

437
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,941
Red Crown, splash one.

438
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,029
Copy, SoIo. KiII confirmed,
target destroyed.

439
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,239
Looking good?

440
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:15,037
Looks good.
Looks coId and cIear.

441
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,333
With all
due respect, sir,
now is not the best time.

442
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,335
In 20 minutes,
this place is going
to fall apart.

443
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,713
I'm aware of that,
I'II take the chance.
We need to taIk.

444
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,467
I need you to stop
what you're doing
and turn around.

445
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,802
That's an order.

446
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,513
We got screwed
on the inteI, okay?

447
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,640
Nobody knew those
peopIe were in there.

448
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,768
It wouId be perfectIy
normaI for a person
to have doubts

449
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,812
about the moraIity
of what we just
asked you to do.

450
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,979
Is that a question, sir?

451
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,316
No, it's not.
Tune in to what I'm
trying to say to you.

452
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,735
Do you know what
a sin-eater is?

453
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,947
That's what we are.
We are the sin-eaters.

454
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,534
It means that we take
the moraI excrement that
we find in this equation

455
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,494
and we bury it down
deep inside of us

456
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,621
so that the rest of
our cause can stay pure.

457
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,123
That is the job.

458
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,001
We are moraIIy indefensibIe
and absoIuteIy necessary.

459
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,879
Do you understand?

460
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,468
WiII that be aII?

461
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:15,681
Stitch that up.

462
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,225
I'm gonna put you on a pIane
to Yemen in six hours.

463
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,977
I'II be ready.

464
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,574
I toId you
she'd be coming at us.

465
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,911
Yeah, I need you to
stay caIm, Terry, okay?

466
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,163
They're giving her
a Senate hearing.

467
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,622
How can you not see
that as a probIem?

468
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,293
She knows Bourne,
she knows BIackbriar,
she knows Hirsch.

469
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,420
She's got a handIe
on the whoIe
goddamn operation.

470
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,422
I don't see how
the heII you couId be
so caIm about this!

471
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,007
WeII, what can she say?

472
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,467
What can she say?

473
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,844
What if she gets
up there and she says,

474
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,888
"Treadstone, BIackbriar,
you think that was it?

475
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,598
"You think that Jason Bourne
was the whoIe story?

476
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,308
"Sorry, there's a Iot more
going on here."

477
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,477
What if she teIIs them that
Treadstone was just the tip
of the iceberg?

478
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,645
Look, you want
to sweat something?

479
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,731
Worry about Outcome,
because we're stiII
not out of the woods.

480
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,942
But as far as
our other programs,
she doesn't know that much.

481
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,360
How do you know that?

482
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,907
Because we're
tapped into everything
she says and does.

483
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,241
What?

484
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,371
Phones, emaiI, cars,
house, Iawyer.

485
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,251
She was cooked the minute
she hitched her wagon
to Jason Bourne.

486
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,129
She aided and abetted
an internationaI fugitive.

487
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,716
She prevented the agency
from shutting down
a rogue operation.

488
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,553
She vioIated every oath
and code of conduct
that matters.

489
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,932
For Christ's sake,
she brought the son of
a bitch back to America.

490
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,684
Now, God knows
what her motives are,

491
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,939
but it's cIear that
protecting this country
is not one of them.

492
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,400
That used to be
caIIed treason.

493
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,356
Even the soIution here.
Now, that shouId be
coming up as a constant.

494
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,928
There you are.
I don't understand
these vaIues. . .

495
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,600
My God, no!

496
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,438
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

497
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,939
What is that?

498
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,232
It's a gun.

499
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,152
No. I. . . No.
Yeah. No, it was gunfire.

500
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,199
No, pIease. No, no, no!

501
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,579
HeIp!

502
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:13,043
Open the door!
He's shooting us!
Open the door!

503
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,715
Open the door!
He's got a gun !

504
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,425
Open the door!

505
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,471
HeIp!

506
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:27,974
My God.

507
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:29,601
We got to be abIe
to get a card !

508
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,228
We have to be abIe
to get in there!

509
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,941
What's
happening? We gotta go
for the back door.

510
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,401
It's Iocked.
He Iocked the back door.

511
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,822
No, pIease.

512
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,240
He's gonna kiII us aII.

513
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,993
Don't do this.
My God.

514
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,581
Move!

515
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,041
He's shooting
everyone in there!

516
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,335
I need a red Iab access card !
Who's got a red
Iab access card?

517
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,461
They're bringing one
down from upstairs.

518
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,046
They're aII in there.
Everyone who has
one is in there.

519
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,528
BiIIy, where are you, man?
I need a red card now!

520
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,703
Don. . .
What are you doing?

521
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,097
Shit, the handIe's off.

522
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,690
The handIe's off!

523
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:34,309
Drop it! Stop!
Drop the weapon !

524
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,566
Drop it! Drop the weapon !

525
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,615
lnvestigators
are still searching
for some explanation

526
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,826
behind the workplace
murder-suicide

527
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,912
that left another
American community
grieving and shocked.

528
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,747
Police and federal authorities

529
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,876
The boys need
to see you right away.

530
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,047
Let's get that Foite story
out there right away.

531
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,424
I'II take care of it.

532
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,512
And this area,
back here?

533
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,598
That's aII been
converted to storage.

534
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,434
Because it says on
the bIueprint, and even
on the board, there,

535
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:01,771
that it's a medicaI
examination suite.

536
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,108
I mean, what kind
of examinations are
we taIking about?

537
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,445
There we go.
May l see the hand, please?

538
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,491
That has heaIed weII.

539
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,577
Any diminished sensation?

540
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,954
Nope.

541
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,047
Are you trying to
put me down, doc?

542
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,965
I'm afraid there's
been a few gaps

543
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,675
in your sampIe
deIiveries, so. . .

544
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,429
. . .we need a fuII
work-up this visit.

545
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,973
Another one?

546
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,143
Why? Is it 'cause
I missed a bIood drop?

547
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,315
So, how do you think
it works, doc?

548
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,526
That we can just
caII a timeout?

549
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,863
Everything stops whiIe
you puII your sampIes?

550
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,115
Why don't you
Iie down and reIax?

551
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,283
Yeah.

552
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,579
What do you think
that we do out there?

553
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,997
Okay, that's
enough information.

554
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,749
No, I. . .

555
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,377
WeII, you're just a doctor.

556
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,754
You know we're
on camera.

557
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,924
ReaIIy?

558
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,636
Is that why you make such
an attractive appearance?

559
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:18,014
Okay, why don't you
count backward from 1 00,
pIease?

560
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,789
HeIIo?

561
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,167
Yeah, the gate
shouId be open.

562
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:37,380
Bear to the Ieft.
It's about haIf-a-miIe up.

563
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,112
Thanks.

564
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:03,907
Dr. Shearing?
- huh.

565
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,075
Hi, I'm Dr. Connie Dowd.

566
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,869
Hi, how are you?
WeII, thanks.

567
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,746
This is SpeciaI
Agent Larry Hooper.

568
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,914
HeIIo.
HeIIo.

569
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,291
PIease. Come in.

570
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,335
Thanks for
Ietting us come out.

571
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,504
It's a remarkabIe property.
What a project.

572
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,841
Yeah, I reaIIy don't want
to taIk about the house.

573
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,093
Not unIess
you want to buy it.

574
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,308
Sit, I guess. PIease.

575
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,895
Just so you know, okay,

576
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,565
I didn't know anything
about this meeting
untiI an hour ago.

577
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,109
And nobody Iast night
said to make time

578
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,945
or pick a time,
or anything Iike that.

579
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,822
And then, this morning,
I buy a pIane ticket
to see my sister

580
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,700
and suddenIy it's Iike
DEFCON 4 around here.

581
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,494
And that is not
paranoia, okay?

582
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,287
That is pretty much
directIy in my face!

583
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,372
Understood.

584
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,123
ShouId we not be
paying attention?

585
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,792
Can you Ieave us
aIone, Larry?

586
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,548
Look.

587
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,426
You've just been
through an extremeIy
traumatic experience.

588
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:08,471
Yeah. Doctor of what?

589
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,139
What are you?

590
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,683
CIinicaI psychoIogy.

591
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,268
So, what do you do?

592
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,480
You give grief
counseIing to spies?

593
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,983
You have a very unusuaI
security cIearance, Marta.

594
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,484
You shouId expect
that buying a ticket

595
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,070
to MontreaI without
teIIing anyone wouId
set off some beIIs.

596
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:28,116
Yeah, I've got some beIIs
of my own going off, okay?

597
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,701
I mean, are you going to be
the person who teIIs me

598
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,494
what the heII
is going on here,

599
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,538
or are you just the next
mystery babysitter?

600
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,665
What do you think
is going on?

601
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,418
What I'm trying
to do is not think.

602
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,253
I just. . . I want
to stop thinking.

603
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,422
Have you discussed
those feeIings with
anyone eIse?

604
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,881
Your sister? Friends?

605
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,091
Are you for reaI?

606
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,634
What about Peter Boyd?

607
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,971
Wow.

608
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,639
Okay.

609
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:55,059
So, we're into
everything, is that it?
Is anything off-Iimits here?

610
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,479
Have you ever read
your empIoyment
security contract?

611
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,314
Have I read my. . .

612
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,652
If you're asking me
whether I understand
my discIosure restrictions,

613
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,571
yes, I have a PhD
in biochemistry

614
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,407
with postdoctoraI feIIowships
in viroIogy and genetics.

615
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:10,825
I know how to read !

616
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,328
What I don't understand
is why my coIIeague

617
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:18,541
has a psychotic episode
and shot everyone in the Iab.

618
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,171
Are you aware of what
we do in there?

619
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,506
Are you?

620
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,676
I mean, how do I know
that you're even cIeared
for this conversation?

621
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,887
Have you discussed
anything to do
with the incident

622
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,139
with anyone other
than the investigators?

623
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,516
Peter Boyd moved
out eight months ago.

624
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,268
But I guess you
aIready know that.

625
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,104
And, no, I haven't
spoken to him.

626
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:44,692
You stated that you
and Dr. Foite had no
reIationship outside of work.

627
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,445
None.

628
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,157
There was materiaI
in his apartment that
indicates he had

629
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,076
an unusuaI fixation
with you.

630
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:58,498
Photographs, journaI entries.
They found severaI
articIes of cIothing.

631
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,832
What?

632
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,752
Did you ever rebuff him
in any way?

633
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,836
No.

634
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,255
No, no, I. . .

635
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,344
I aIways thought
he was gay.

636
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:15,056
Look, no one is suggesting
that you're responsibIe
for what happened.

637
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,182
Thank you.

638
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,976
Survivors often experience
feeIings of guiIt.

639
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,312
Those feeIings
can be ampIified

640
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,525
by the reaIization
that he Iet you Iive.

641
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:30,488
That he Iet me Iive?

642
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,784
Have you seen the video?

643
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,830
Do you reaIIy think
that's what it shows?

644
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,624
You are asking aII
the wrong questions!

645
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:42,875
What shouId I
be asking, Marta?

646
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,545
Has anyone Iooked at
Dr. Foite's bIood work?

647
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,712
Have they?

648
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,590
I mean, that is the onIy
thing that is going to make
any sense, here.

649
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,135
His behavior was. . .

650
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,512
Look, there are
projects at Sterisyn,

651
00:57:54,596 --> 00:58:00,143
defense projects
that couId expIain
why he did what he did.

652
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:06,274
And peopIe
there are working on
behavioraI design.

653
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,403
It's programmabIe behavior,
neuraI design.

654
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,324
Do you understand
what I'm teIIing you?

655
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,787
I think he was exposed
to something at the Iab.

656
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,373
Found it.

657
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,626
What are you doing?

658
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,548
That's my gun.
What the heII is this?

659
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,216
You're a potentiaI
suicide risk.

660
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,926
No. Wait a minute.
How did you. . .

661
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,678
How did he find that?
Marta. . .

662
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,139
No, no. Okay.
This meeting is now over.

663
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,392
I want you both out
of here, right now!
Marta. . .

664
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,352
No! He has been
snooping around my house!

665
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,688
Marta, I want to
sign off here today!

666
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,607
I want to Iet you
get on that pIane,

667
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,525
but you have got
to heIp us out!

668
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:54,238
Look, we have got to do
our job here, okay?

669
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,157
We have got to go
through this.

670
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,119
I need to know that
you are caIm and safe
before I Ieave here

671
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:04,123
and I need to know that you
understand the ruIes before
you get on that pIane.

672
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,752
PIease, just. . .

673
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,381
PIease, sit down
and Iet us get through
our questions.

674
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,716
Okay.

675
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,435
Jesus! What is this?

676
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,938
What the heII is this?
Ready?

677
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,481
CIose.
What are you doing?

678
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:29,857
Get off me!

679
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:30,983
Set?

680
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,653
Get the heII off me now!
Set!

681
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,573
Green !
No!

682
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,213
Gene!

683
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,548
A runner in the basement!

684
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:36,924
Go!

685
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,307
Connie!
On your right.

686
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,238
One. GirI.

687
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,132
Find her.

688
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,676
Find her!

689
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:20,111
Gene! TaIk to me!

690
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,271
Hey.

691
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,817
UnIess you reIoaded,
the gun is empty.

692
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,694
Look, Iook.

693
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,947
Dr. Shearing, it's me.

694
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,575
I'm not here
to hurt you, okay?
How did you. . .

695
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,827
That was you !
Yes. Shh !

696
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,501
Listen to me.
Do you want to Iive?

697
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,128
Look at me.
Do you want to Iive?

698
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,379
Do you want to Iive?
Yes.

699
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,714
Good. Let go of this gun.

700
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:23,299
How is this possibIe?
Let go.

701
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,596
Take this.

702
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,097
Good.

703
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:33,559
Now, I need you to do
exactIy what I say.

704
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,729
How is this possibIe?
Listen to me.
ExactIy what I say.

705
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,813
Understand?
Yeah.

706
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,106
Good.

707
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:24,276
Hey, doc?
I need my watch.

708
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,284
Doc, I need that watch !

709
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,832
Are there chems
in this house?

710
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,042
Program medication.

711
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,126
Are they aII dead?

712
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:42,253
Yeah, they're dead.

713
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,631
Look at me. Look at me.
Do you have program
medication here?

714
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,715
What?

715
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,218
Chems. Greens, bIues.
Do you have them here?

716
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,637
No, no.
No?

717
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,930
Here? No, no.
Here.

718
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,474
Where, then?
Where do you have them?

719
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,476
Where?
Where do you keep
the chems?

720
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,061
I don't know.

721
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,522
Dr. Shearing,
where are the chems?
I need the chems!

722
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,482
I understand,
but I don't know.

723
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,280
It's not something. . .
We do viroIogy controI.

724
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,073
So, aII of that happens. . .

725
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:15,286
We don't have medication.

726
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,747
If I had any,
I wouId give it to you.

727
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,674
Okay, Iisten to me.

728
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,051
We have Iess
than eight minutes
to cIear out of here, okay?

729
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,804
Yes.
Good.

730
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:37,725
Because the next thing
coming through that door

731
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,518
is going to wipe us out.

732
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,669
Can I get a sitrep, here?

733
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,798
If you can hear me,
pick up, Larry.

734
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,677
Larry, pick up.

735
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,516
Hey.
Sorry about the tran.

736
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:23,062
What's our frame-rate, here?

737
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,482
Connie says about 1 0.
Just wrapping up.

738
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,275
TeII her we need
a heads-up. Okay?

739
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,401
Copy that.

740
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:37,493
Hey.

741
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,127
It's probabIy
better you did this.

742
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,318
Where are we going?

743
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,822
June. Your name is
June Monroe, say it.

744
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,115
June Monroe.
Say it.

745
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,491
June Monroe.

746
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:00,617
Now pick a pIace you Iived.

747
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,703
The Iast pIace you Iived.
A pIace you know.

748
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,663
Bethesda.
Bethesda, that's
where you Iive.

749
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,790
Anybody asks,
you're June Monroe
from Bethesda.

750
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,292
You Iost your waIIet.
I'm driving you home.

751
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,169
My name is James.
James and June, you got it?

752
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,253
Yeah.
Okay.

753
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,509
Is that your name?

754
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,719
James?

755
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,722
No. What?
You don't know my name?

756
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,226
What do you caII me?
What do you put
on my bIood work?

757
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:27,311
Five.

758
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,396
Five? The number five?

759
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,901
Do you know how
many times we've met?

760
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,320
Thirteen.

761
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:38,447
Thirteen exams over
the Iast four years.

762
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,656
And that's what
I get, a number?

763
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,533
Number Five. Okay.

764
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,744
Five of what, then?
How many are we?

765
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,370
Program participants?

766
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,538
That's what you caII us?

767
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,166
There were nine. Then six.

768
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,502
Participants.

769
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,003
How did you find me?

770
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,171
WeII, what do you think?

771
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,464
They're going
to kiII aII of us

772
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,548
and then just
Ieave you guys aIone?

773
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,801
You think your coIIeague
just went crazy?

774
01:08:58,885 --> 01:08:59,885
Is that what you think?

775
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:02,888
I didn't think anything.
They wound him up
and set him Ioose.

776
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,849
I reaIIy have no idea
what is going on.

777
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,560
What's going on
is they're shutting
the whoIe thing down.

778
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,229
Who is "they"?

779
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,065
I don't know. . .
Who were the peopIe
at the house?

780
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,442
No, no, no, no.
You had your turn, okay?

781
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,821
You've been bIeeding
and scoping and scraping me
since the day we met.

782
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,073
It's my turn, now.
I'm asking the questions,
you got it?

783
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,243
I need program meds, okay?
I need program meds.

784
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,036
Where do you keep
the chems?

785
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,080
I don't have any.
I've aIready toId you.

786
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:29,540
We don't have them.
BuIIshit.

787
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,124
BuIIshit.
It's buIIshit.

788
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,334
I don't have any!

789
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,711
So, you don't know anything?
You're just the heIp?

790
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,464
That's why you have
the big house and the
security cIearance, right?

791
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,174
That's why they're
trying so hard to kiII you,

792
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,467
because you
don't know anything.

793
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:43,095
I know my job,
which is science.

794
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:46,306
I don't know what you do
when you Ieave the Iab.

795
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:47,933
None of us do!
For four years!

796
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,018
Look, I want to get out!
WouId you pIease stop the car?

797
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,186
You can't be that naive.

798
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,814
WouId you Iet me out the car?
There's no way
you're that naive!

799
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,696
You want out? Get out.
Go on, get out.

800
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,364
You don't have any chems.
You don't know where
they are.

801
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,616
You don't know anything.
That's fine. Just get out.

802
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,535
But you got a pIan, right?

803
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,870
Yeah, of course you do.
You're a doctor.

804
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,955
You've got this aII
worked out, don't you?

805
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,623
What are you going to do?

806
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,667
Huh? What are
you going to do?

807
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,253
You can't run, not aIone.
You don't know how.

808
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:17,421
You certainIy can't hide.

809
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:19,256
Not from peopIe Iike this,
with the resources they have.

810
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,175
You won't make it to sundown.
So, what does that Ieave you?

811
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,636
You can go pubIic, sure.
You can go Ioud.

812
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,014
CaII your sister,
because that worked out
weII for you.

813
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,265
CaII some ex-roommate.

814
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,100
CaII a guy that knows a guy
at The Washington Post.

815
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,184
Put it onIine.
'Cause you know what?

816
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,186
You bIow me off,
that's the onIy
pIay you've got.

817
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,149
But you'd better
ask yourseIf this.

818
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:39,818
CouId you ever say it
Ioud enough or fast enough

819
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:43,363
that they'd be too afraid
to finish what
they've started?

820
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,784
Now, I've got a pIan,
and it's just not
that compIicated.

821
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,079
What I'm going to do is
wait for the next person
to show up to kiII you.

822
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,498
Maybe they can heIp me.

823
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,209
So, go for it.

824
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,548
I had no choice.
I had to get out of there.

825
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,884
No, I had to
get out of there!

826
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,725
No, nobody. I have no idea.

827
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,479
You have to understand.
AII the work at Outcome,
aII those tests,

828
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,898
the burn rates,
dosage paneIs,
tissue stress.

829
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:21,151
I mean, that is us
tuning chemistry.

830
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,946
We don't fabricate anything.
That happens downstream.

831
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,405
Wait. What's that mean,
"downstream"?

832
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:28,283
It means you need Iive
virus to seed adhesion.

833
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,035
CuItures are
highIy reactive.

834
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,371
You have to process on-site
and we wouId never do it here.

835
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,705
Okay. On-site, where? Where?

836
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,207
Where do we hoId the virus?

837
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,708
Yes!

838
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,710
WeII, we can't
drive there.

839
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,963
Where is it?
ManiIa.

840
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,341
The PhiIippines.

841
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,745
Where do you stand
with your dosage?

842
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,750
I have 300 miIIigrams
of bIues.

843
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,961
It's not even enough
for another day.

844
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:23,005
I haven't had
a fuII green in 51 hours,

845
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,716
which is strange
because I don't feeI
physicaIIy degraded.

846
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,800
But we'II see.

847
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:27,968
Wait, wait, wait.

848
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:31,263
Did you just say you're
stiII taking greens?

849
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:32,431
What are you taIking about?

850
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,560
You were viraIed off
physicaI medication
Iast year.

851
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,937
What?

852
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:44,776
Jesus. They viraIed
everyone off greens
eight months ago.

853
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,695
They infected you
with Iive virus,

854
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,196
which means that,
physicaIIy,
you're stabIe.

855
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,781
You don't need
to take greens.

856
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,285
They Iocked it in.

857
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:57,289
Any physicaI enhancement
is now permanent.

858
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,416
So, you infected me?

859
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,002
When was this?

860
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:04,796
Is this when I was sick?

861
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,132
The mystery fIu?
That was you?

862
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,552
WeII, it wasn't me.
I didn't do it.

863
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,846
That was you. That was
on purpose, right?

864
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,264
When I aImost died.

865
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,641
I'm sorry,
but it wasn't me.

866
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,019
Why am I stiII taking
green piIIs, then?

867
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:21,646
I don't know.
I thought you had stopped.

868
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,815
Why am I asking
you anything?

869
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,193
Or to keep us
on a Ieash, right?

870
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,986
Is that it?
To keep a hoId on us?

871
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,155
To keep us dependent?

872
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,700
Who teIIs you
that this is okay?

873
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,368
No one. . . I do. . .

874
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,411
Who says it's okay?

875
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:37,913
I do research.

876
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:42,626
I design, I survey.
I don't administer meds.

877
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,211
I don't make poIicy!

878
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,379
No, you just Ioad the gun.

879
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,507
God.

880
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,010
Look, I was there
for the science.

881
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,305
We were aII there
for science.

882
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,059
And I know you don't care,
but I made a huge sacrifice.

883
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,811
I couIdn't pubIish,
I couIdn't conference.

884
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,480
I couIdn't teII
a singIe person
what it was I did.

885
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,067
But I thought I was
heIping my country,
and I know that's. . .

886
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,902
TeII me you can
viraI off bIues.

887
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,532
Can you viraI off bIues?

888
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,367
TheoreticaIIy, yes.

889
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:16,660
Yeah.

890
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:19,162
PiIIs aIIow for
temporary adhesion.
Okay.

891
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:22,124
To Iock it in,
you need Iive cuIture.
Live virus!

892
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,876
You know how to do that.

893
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,920
Do you know
how to do that?

894
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,380
Yes.
Okay.

895
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,758
Yes, but I toId you,
it's on the other
side of the pIanet.

896
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,845
WeII, guess where
we're going?

897
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:41,393
Welcome to Washington.
Welcome to Candent
World Headquarters.

898
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:43,478
We want to make sure
that over the next few days

899
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,857
you have a chance to connect
with the people who have
made Sterisyn Morlanta

900
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,526
the crown jewel
in the Candent
group of companies.

901
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,654
FinaI Phase 3
testing approvaI is
expected this month

902
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,906
for both reQuieI
and SupressoIyn.

903
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:58,201
Confidence is high that
we're coming in on scheduIe,
and we want to be ready.

904
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,078
We know the market
is eager.

905
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,580
We know, gIobaIIy,
the kind of. . .

906
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,420
What the heII don't
I know about this?

907
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:09,588
You're directing
that at me?

908
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:12,007
That was a D-Trac team
we sent in there.

909
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,049
I don't know what
that means.

910
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,217
It means they're
good at what they do.

911
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,427
I was toId that
they were missing.

912
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:17,387
They don't just
go missing.

913
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,097
What didn't you teII us
about this woman?

914
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,141
Nothing. She is who she is.
There's nothing to teII.

915
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:22,601
You vetted her up and down.

916
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:23,935
Then what the heII
are we Iooking at?

917
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,437
She has
a registered gun.

918
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:26,897
They knew that
going in.

919
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,398
She's got buiIding permits.

920
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,942
Propane, weIding tanks.
A stray buIIet?

921
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,235
You want to keep guessing?

922
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,403
We've got to get in there.

923
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,447
I've got a dozen peopIe
waiting on the perimeter.

924
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:36,615
We don't controI the site?

925
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:37,782
Not yet.

926
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:38,950
Getting the picture now?

927
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,076
Okay, stop!

928
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,328
I can't run this from here.

929
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,872
I need a crisis suite.
I need integrated
grids and comms.

930
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:44,956
I need aII of it.

931
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,875
NSA, or Pentagon,
or Liberty Crossing.

932
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,919
I don't care, just
get me something now.

933
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,545
Pack up your codes
and your drives,

934
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:51,713
and whatever eIse
you're going to need.

935
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,131
We're going to move
and we're going to stay there.

936
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,635
Dita, how am I putting
a net over that house?
There's IocaIs aII over it.

937
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,136
We go with germs.

938
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,096
She took sampIes from work.

939
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,349
Pathogens, viruses.
It's nationaI security.

940
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,808
Good, okay,
I Iike that, it pIays.

941
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,352
Now, get it out there,
get it out there.

942
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:08,021
Come on, Iet's go, Iet's go.
Everybody find
another gear, okay?

943
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,814
Because I want to
be out of here in 20.

944
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,194
So, Iet's say
you want to change
the human body.

945
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:15,695
You want to fix a mistake.

946
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,324
You want to repair something,
improve something.

947
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,244
WeII, if you're going
to reprogram human
genetic materiaI,

948
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,705
you need a deIivery
system, and nothing
works better than virus.

949
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:27,249
It's Iike a suitcase.

950
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,418
You pack in genetic mutation,

951
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:35,507
infect the body
and the vector unIoads
into the target ceIIs.

952
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:40,053
But getting it
where you want it,
how you want it,

953
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,221
is the nightmare.

954
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,515
UnIess you have a map.

955
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:48,687
There was this
terribIe accident
at Fort Detrick in 1 985.

956
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,775
Five researchers dropped
dead in the Iab, and it
was such a catastrophe

957
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,235
that they brought in
Dan HiIIcott

958
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,029
from Stanford
to assess the damage.

959
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:02,617
He got in there
and he reaIized that,
underneath it aII,

960
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:07,706
was this
incredibIe breakthrough
in viraI-receptor mapping.

961
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:09,708
He had a map.

962
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,421
You've had some
very minor aIterations

963
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,214
made to two different
chromosomes.

964
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,300
The green side,
the physicaI side,

965
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,510
is nothing more
than a 1 .5 percent rise

966
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,305
in your mitochondriaI
protein uptake.

967
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,181
But with 1 .5 percent,

968
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:29,686
you see this
immediate increase
in ceIIuIar tempo,

969
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,522
muscIe efficiency,
oxygenation. . .

970
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,732
And the bIue side?

971
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,234
InteIIigence, obviousIy,
but it's more than that.

972
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,654
It's neuraI regeneration
and eIasticity.

973
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,700
Sensory function.
Pain suppression.

974
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,329
It's the most
exciting deveIopment
in genomic targeting

975
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,706
in the history
of the science.

976
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,936
My God.

977
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:19,903
Hey, how do I get
monitor 71 up on
the big screen?

978
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,279
Coming up.

979
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,451
They found a body.

980
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,120
They're pretty sure
it's a woman, and it's
not Marta Shearing.

981
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,663
They found dog tags.

982
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,457
They think she was shot.

983
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:50,600
Hey.

984
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,313
Marta, I. . .

985
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,192
You can't
caII anyone.

986
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,824
There are peopIe
that care about you
that think you're dead.

987
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,367
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

988
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:10,328
Anyone you contact
becomes a target.

989
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:17,001
So, you need to put aside
any normaI emotionaI
response that you have.

990
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,841
The onIy edge we've
got right now is they
think we're both gone.

991
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,510
AII right?

992
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,388
AII right.

993
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,935
So,

994
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,062
you're going to want
to go through this.

995
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:49,033
You know, just
be famiIiar with it.

996
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,253
June Monroe.

997
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,714
Who is June Monroe?

998
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,883
You are.

999
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,225
Do you know her?

1000
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,064
Not anymore.

1001
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,198
Why do you have
to stay enhanced?

1002
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,454
Why is it so
important to you?

1003
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,337
Come here.

1004
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,278
What is this?

1005
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,447
This was me.

1006
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,576
Was.

1007
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,497
My army recruiter

1008
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,542
was Iooking
to make his quota.

1009
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,418
He added 1 2 points
to my IQ.

1010
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,300
TweIve points to make
the minimum.

1011
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,646
You ever seen a cognitive
degrade, Marta?

1012
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,649
Sensory withdrawaI?
You ever do that?

1013
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,611
PuII someone's bIues
and watch them
drop off their meds?

1014
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,029
No.

1015
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,825
Because they paint
a pretty graphic
picture in training.

1016
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,830
HeII of a Iong way to faII.

1017
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:05,003
If I can't
keep it together,
we won't make it.

1018
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,845
They bit.
Who?

1019
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,055
Washington Post.

1020
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,683
We just fIagged
an emaiI.

1021
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,977
They're going with
the story about
the possibIe theft

1022
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,812
of the dangerous
materiaIs from the Iab.

1023
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,150
Wow, they took it.
They aIready fIagged
a DWI conviction.

1024
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:28,359
That's convenient.

1025
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:31,362
They found another body.
One of ours.

1026
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,198
They're picking
up sheII casings
aII over the pIace.

1027
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,659
I don't think your
doctor's in there.

1028
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,253
Boarding pass
and ID, pIease.

1029
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,763
Thank you.
Thank you.

1030
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:41,099
Boarding pass
and ID, pIease.

1031
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,237
Where are you?

1032
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,114
l'm right behind you.
Don't turn around.

1033
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:58,700
You're going to
stay right here

1034
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,411
untiI it's time
to board, okay?
You're doing great.

1035
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,497
You see that corridor
on your right?

1036
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:05,665
You're gonna want
to find somebody

1037
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,625
who's walking that way
and just tag along.

1038
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:09,377
Keep moving,
keep your head down,

1039
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,461
and I'II see you
on the pIane.

1040
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,005
Aaron?

1041
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:14,757
HeIIo?

1042
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,348
The traiI is
definitive and fresh.

1043
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,517
The canine team
tracked her from her house

1044
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:27,603
through this wooded area,
ending here, at this
IittIe parking Iot.

1045
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:30,648
Either she had
a car waiting for her,
or somebody picked her up.

1046
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,443
There are security
cameras on the street,
but there's nothing back here.

1047
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,194
There's got to be
sateIIite footage.

1048
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,739
MaryIand's not exactIy
a high-vaIue U.S. target.

1049
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,073
There'II be pIenty
of weather imaging,

1050
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:40,283
but we're gonna have
to swing a IittIe wider

1051
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:41,659
to find something reaI-time
that's enhanceabIe.

1052
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,703
We're draining some
foreign pIatforms.
We need about an hour.

1053
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,997
Come on,
she's not puIIing
this off on her own.

1054
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,957
Who the heII
is heIping her?

1055
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:54,255
We'll find out
more in the next hour,

1056
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,923
while we are
currently in court.

1057
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,008
Now back to Jenn.

1058
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,096
The FBl this morning
confirmed reports that
Dr. Albert Hirsch

1059
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:05,516
died of heart failure
in a Washington, D.C. hotel.

1060
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,603
Dr. Hirsch had been expected
to testify yesterday

1061
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,438
before a Senate
lntelligence committee.

1062
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,107
That select committee
is investigating links

1063
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:16,611
between a troubled ClA program
known as Treadstone

1064
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,446
and this man, Jason Bourne.

1065
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,199
Police and federal officials
are searching for Bourne

1066
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:24,452
in connection
with recent shootings
in New York and in London.

1067
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,455
Dr. Hirsch had been
cooperating with
the Justice Department

1068
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,374
and was in protective custody
at the time of the incident.

1069
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,376
A committee spokesman
told reporters last night

1070
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,379
that the hearings will
be postponed temporarily

1071
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,423
as they evaluate
the loss of Doctor...

1072
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:03,491
Hi, foIks.

1073
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,326
Just going to remind you
to keep the aisIes cIear

1074
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,786
for any baggage
during takeoff and Ianding.

1075
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,704
Excuse me.
Thank you.

1076
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,122
Pardon me, sir.

1077
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:16,838
Sir, do you need
heIp finding your seat?

1078
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,965
Sir?
No, I got it.

1079
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,610
You see those two shadows?
One of them is her.
That's the parking Iot.

1080
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:42,530
One of them stops.
Here comes the car.

1081
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:45,199
Where is this from?
It's a Canadian
forestry sateIIite.

1082
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,327
Here comes
the other one into the car,
and there they go.

1083
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,121
- Where?
- We Iose them east.

1084
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,456
Our window drops out
about two miIes up the road.

1085
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,791
But we've got the siIhouette.

1086
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,043
We've got
surveiIIance footage,
racked and ready to go.

1087
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,880
We're going to spIit teams,
find this car and
Iink up a traiI.

1088
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,464
With a 1 7-hour head start?

1089
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:03,050
Where the heII can she go?

1090
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:19,859
We're Iooking for
a Buick LeSabre 2002.

1091
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:22,320
I've got an
NIA/HomeIand warrant,
that's why.

1092
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,323
WeII, you give us
what you have. . .
Two passengers.

1093
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:30,369
It's an '02 burgundy
LeSabre starting west
from Lisbon, MaryIand.

1094
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,622
ToIIs, exits,
service stations.

1095
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,457
Give me every
camera you've got.

1096
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,667
I'm seeing
an FBI camera bin
on my Iist here.

1097
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,960
No, no. Traffic onIy.

1098
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,296
West, Lisbon. L-I-S-B-O-N.

1099
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,758
Yes, we want aII of that
and the toII cams.
We want everything.

1100
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,302
We'II take them aII.
Whatever hits you have,
send them on.

1101
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,720
We wiII work on
sorting them out.

1102
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,789
Wilmington, Delaware.

1103
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:19,251
This is our car, the LeSabre.
We see it coming
into the structure.

1104
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,297
It goes under,
comes back around,
and it parks here.

1105
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,966
But it doesn't come out.

1106
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:28,844
This is inside.
It's four minutes
after arrivaI.

1107
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:30,054
It's her.

1108
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,056
Do we know
what she's doing?

1109
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,059
She was having her
passport picture taken.

1110
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:46,278
Logan, Hartford,
LaGuardia, Kennedy,
PhiIIy, Newark,

1111
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:47,905
DuIIes, Reagan.

1112
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:50,408
We start with
yesterday morning,
that is our wedge.

1113
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,743
We cIear that,
and then we move
up the cIock.

1114
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,248
She wants to know
if you want Hartford,
because she can get it.

1115
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:42,418
BIue coat, second row.
She's got a red bag.

1116
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:43,586
Which one? I have four.

1117
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:47,423
AII right, I have
TSA Authorization
1 , 6, 9 and 1 2.

1118
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,425
Airports given,
aII departures.

1119
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,635
Yes, the internationaI
terminaI first.

1120
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,107
We're aImost there.

1121
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,991
So, check out
the newsstand.

1122
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,159
There.

1123
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,577
I don't know.

1124
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:20,206
Logan has a face
we need to Iook at,
but there's kids.

1125
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,333
Hang on, hang on,
hang on. Hang on.

1126
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,877
Stop.

1127
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,175
Where is this?

1128
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,510
Kennedy.
Okay.

1129
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,442
I've never
been here at night.
I don't know the ruIes.

1130
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:51,320
There are no ruIes, okay?

1131
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:55,199
We beIong here.
Come on.

1132
01:30:58,745 --> 01:30:59,954
Hey, how are you?

1133
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:01,664
Good evening.

1134
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,542
Dr. Shearing and I are here
to open up the Iab, pIease.

1135
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:07,586
Sir?
What's aII this?

1136
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,047
Hi, how are you?

1137
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:13,843
Dr. Shearing !
Dr. Shearing.

1138
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,220
Hey, it's me, Joseph.

1139
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,264
Joseph !

1140
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,391
HeIIo, how are you?

1141
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:21,809
I'm good, I'm good.

1142
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,395
WeIcome back.
Thanks.

1143
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,981
I'm sorry.
I just don't have you
on my Iist arriving.

1144
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,066
That's because we had
to change our scheduIe.

1145
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:30,776
Yeah, we took
an earIier fIight.

1146
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:34,029
Joseph,
I'm Dr. Brundage, by the way.
It's nice to meet you.

1147
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:38,075
PIeased to meet you, too,
but Dr. PumaIoy is not here,
he went to Singapore.

1148
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:39,326
He just Ieft yesterday.

1149
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:41,996
The girIs have gone home.
No one toId me anything.

1150
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:44,456
Right. WeII, I understand.

1151
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,250
WeII, Iook, we're going
to be here aII week,

1152
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,710
and we have
a Iot of work to do,

1153
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,211
so we need to get
in there tonight

1154
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:50,337
and get things started, okay?

1155
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,131
Yeah, of course,
it's just that. . .

1156
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:53,924
You can caII
Dr. PumaIoy if you want.

1157
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:55,176
I just don't want to
put you on the spot.

1158
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,469
No, we don't
have to do that.

1159
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,180
Okay, great.

1160
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:04,268
It's just the two of you?

1161
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,603
Yeah.

1162
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,355
Yes, correct.

1163
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:09,773
Correct.

1164
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:12,818
Yes, I wiII hoId.

1165
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,779
Get it up there.
Put that up on
the big screen.

1166
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:18,782
Yes, I'm here.

1167
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:21,869
Good. Where?

1168
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:24,830
I need an immediate upIoad
on that passenger manifest.

1169
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,166
I know. Here she is,
I'm putting her back on.

1170
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:30,461
ManiIa. She took
American 1 67 to ManiIa.

1171
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:32,087
She Ianded 45 minutes ago.

1172
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:16,715
Aaron.

1173
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,801
Are you okay?

1174
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,817
There's 243 people
on that plane.

1175
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,819
We're going to scope
every one of them right now.

1176
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:39,154
So, pick a face that
you Iike, puII it down,

1177
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,823
and deseIect it if
you've cIeared it.

1178
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:42,783
If there is anything
that smeIIs wrong to you,

1179
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,160
if there's
a hair out of pIace
that you don't Iike,

1180
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:46,370
you do not cIear it.

1181
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,456
You fIag it and you
send it over to Dita
and we'II check it out.

1182
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:54,503
We have to be
working off the same grid.
That's HomeIand 9.5.

1183
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,006
If you don't
puII that access,
raise your hand,

1184
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,091
CoIoneI Hardy's
going to come over
and sort you out.

1185
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:11,562
So, this is it, huh?

1186
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,355
Yeah.

1187
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:17,901
Okay.

1188
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,237
What the heII
are we into, Terry?

1189
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,572
I don't know.

1190
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,407
It's your shop.
What is going on over there?

1191
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:24,783
What did I say?
I don't know.

1192
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:26,577
WeII, how many trips
has she made over there?

1193
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:28,495
Five, six, I don't know.
Why the PhiIippines?

1194
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,622
Hey, hey, hey!

1195
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,920
Seat 1 3-B.
KarI D. Brundage, 1 3-B.

1196
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,215
I need support staff
to cIear the room.

1197
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:44,720
Stand up and waIk, now.

1198
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,851
Jack, Cathy, move!
Let's go.

1199
01:34:58,485 --> 01:34:59,610
Who the hell is he?

1200
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,113
He's an Outcome agent.

1201
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,281
That's Outcome 5.

1202
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,784
They're not dead?
I thought they were dead !

1203
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,203
Yeah, he's
supposed to be dead.

1204
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:11,747
Then what's
he doing there?
l don't know.

1205
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:13,123
He's Iooking for meds.

1206
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,375
What?

1207
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,877
That's where
the chems come from.
What eIse wouId he be doing?

1208
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,420
She's got
to be helping him.

1209
01:35:18,588 --> 01:35:20,089
But how?
How is that possible?

1210
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:23,092
I don't know how.
I don't care.

1211
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,927
He's aIive, they're there.

1212
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:27,388
"How" doesn't
reaIIy matter, does it?

1213
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,432
The onIy mission
we've got now is to
drop a bag over this.

1214
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,267
Are the drugs
he's Iooking for
there, or not?

1215
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,812
Jesus, I don't. . . Terry?

1216
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,397
No. No, there's
nothing there.

1217
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:37,940
We haven't made
a run in 1 6 weeks.

1218
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:39,608
Besides, we wouIdn't
store the pills
there, anyway.

1219
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,943
lt's basically a kitchen.

1220
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:43,195
We tweak the recipe
and we bake up
a batch when we need it.

1221
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:44,655
Then what the heII
are they doing?

1222
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,615
The stems are there.

1223
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:50,953
She's going to try
to viraI him out.

1224
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,403
Thank you.

1225
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,044
Mack.
Yeah?

1226
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,256
PIant office,
Mackie speaking.

1227
01:36:44,883 --> 01:36:46,300
Mr. Mackie,
this is Terrance Ward.

1228
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,595
l'm the Senior Vice-President
for Candent Precision Metrics.

1229
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,722
l'm calling from Maryland.
Yes, sir.

1230
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,057
We have a potentiaI
security incident.

1231
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:56,477
I just posted
two photographs on
the company network.

1232
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,937
I need to know if either
of these two peopIe
have tried to enter. . .

1233
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:00,272
Yeah, we're on it.

1234
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:01,773
Excuse me?

1235
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:04,902
Yeah, we're on the case.
We're just here now trying
to figure out who to caII.

1236
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,196
Our gatehouse just
passed in two doctors.

1237
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,614
I think one of them
might be that woman

1238
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:09,948
from your
shoot-out over there.

1239
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,450
Well, where are they now?

1240
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,494
We keep aII of our
cIient Iabs downstairs,

1241
01:37:13,578 --> 01:37:15,746
so we're assuming they've
gone into the basement.

1242
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:17,664
I just sent a coupIe of boys
down to check it out.

1243
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,000
No, no. No, no,
withdraw your team.

1244
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,127
Lock the Iab and
keep them down there.

1245
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:24,338
Do not try to take him.

1246
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:30,385
HeIIo?

1247
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:32,262
Hey, how you doing?
Can I heIp you?

1248
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,430
Are you aIone down here?

1249
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:34,598
Aaron?

1250
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:36,433
Hey, guys.

1251
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,769
You can't be down here.
Do you have cIearance
for this IeveI?

1252
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,853
Nobody's supposed
to be down here.

1253
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:41,855
I'm supposed
to be down here.
I'm Dr. Shearing.

1254
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:43,273
We're in the middIe
of a sampIing audit.

1255
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:44,399
It is not safe for
you guys to be here.

1256
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:45,651
Let's straighten
this out upstairs.

1257
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:47,361
Don't touch that.
Pack it up, Iet's go.

1258
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:48,946
Look, nobody touch anything.
Come on, just foIIow us.

1259
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,490
I'm not going to sit
here and argue with you.
I'm going to caII your boss

1260
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,075
and we're gonna figure it out.
Watch her.

1261
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:54,826
Hey, hoId on a second.

1262
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,179
I'm going to get my bag.
We got to go.

1263
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:16,139
Okay.

1264
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:20,227
Wait. This way.

1265
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:22,104
I don't know where this goes.
Just open it.

1266
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,112
Step back.

1267
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:45,210
Lock it down.
Hey! You ! You ! With me!
Come on, come on, come on.

1268
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,510
Is that Iocked?
Yes, sir.

1269
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,137
No one in, no one out.
Do you understand?

1270
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:58,724
Hey, what happened
to those three guys
you sent downstairs?

1271
01:38:58,891 --> 01:38:59,975
Shit.

1272
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:03,687
Come with me.
You stay there, okay?
Stay there.

1273
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:06,481
We beIong here.

1274
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:16,491
Coming through.

1275
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,013
You, go and get
everyone eIse. TeII them
to go around the front.

1276
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,973
Go through the eastern doors,
move around the front.

1277
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:50,609
Move! Move, peopIe!

1278
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:53,904
Who have you
got on this radio?
Why is no one responding?

1279
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,364
Is that gate shut?

1280
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,367
Excuse me.
Move, move, move!

1281
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,577
Hey! I need that gate shut!

1282
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,830
Hey, you ! Listen,
go down to the main gate.
Do you understand?

1283
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,374
No one in, no one out.

1284
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:06,667
Hey, what are you doing?

1285
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,335
Just get down
to the main gate
with everyone eIse.

1286
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,673
AII right, get back!
Stay back!

1287
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,716
Give him some room.

1288
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:17,803
AII right, give me some room.
Give me some room, pIease.

1289
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,389
He's going to need a doctor.

1290
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:24,893
Security. Security!

1291
01:40:25,895 --> 01:40:26,895
Over here, pIease.

1292
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,023
Over here.

1293
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,734
Sir, can you hear me? Sir!

1294
01:40:40,076 --> 01:40:41,535
He can't get far.

1295
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:43,995
If he didn't viraI out,
he's going to run out
of brain.

1296
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,289
And, if he did,
then he's going to be
too sick to move.

1297
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,083
So, we just have
to find him fast

1298
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,876
and kiII him,
once and for aII.

1299
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,503
Can we taIk about LARX?

1300
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:54,214
LARX?

1301
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,591
LARX-3 is in Bangkok.
It's a two-hour fIight.

1302
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:59,219
Wait a minute.
Just hang on, here.

1303
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:02,055
I thought that
was just a proposaI.

1304
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,599
Get him out there.

1305
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,105
LARX is
a beta-2 stem program.

1306
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:12,774
Amped mission fidelity,
minimized empathy.

1307
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,318
lt's Treadstone
without the inconsistency,

1308
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:17,738
Outcome without
the emotional noise.

1309
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,531
lt's looking
very strong for us.

1310
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:22,993
We have never seen
evaIuations Iike this.

1311
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:25,245
This went from something
I don't know about

1312
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,663
to something on
the drawing board,

1313
01:41:26,748 --> 01:41:28,623
and now you're teIIing me
it's up and running?

1314
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:31,293
It's up and running.
Consider yourseIf informed.

1315
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,801
Are you comfortable?

1316
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:22,844
Yes, sir.

1317
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:25,347
You don't
look comfortable.

1318
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:28,683
No, sir.

1319
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,562
What's your name?

1320
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:37,234

1321
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,778

Before you enlisted.

Yes, sir.

1340

That's good to know.

1341

In this bag,
there are passports.

1347
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:27,719
Two bIanks and three ghosts,

1371
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:21,846
"Where are you?"

1372
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:24,307
"Was that the signaI?"

1373
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,142
They're asking
for confirmation.

1374
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:29,479
"You went too soon."
No. . . "We went too soon."

1375
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:30,647
Come on.

1376
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,416
It's okay.

1377
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:23,718
PoIice! PoIice!

1378
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:01,089
Get down !

1379
01:52:10,974 --> 01:52:11,974
Are you okay?

1380
01:52:12,184 --> 01:52:13,184
Yeah.

1381
01:52:13,936 --> 01:52:15,478
Good. Come on.

1382
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:13,703
Get down, get down.

1383
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:19,375
CIimb over.

1384
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,043
Go. Get over,
get over, get over.

1385
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:22,587
Get over. Hang on tight.

1386
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:29,260
Go, go!

1387
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:32,054
You ready? Let go!

1388
01:53:59,917 --> 01:54:01,918
Okay. Take this.

1389
01:54:02,085 --> 01:54:04,587
Just keep waIking,
don't Iook back. Go, go.

1390
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:36,786
Hey, hey. Get on.

1391
01:54:37,454 --> 01:54:38,663
You ever ridden before?
No.

1392
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:39,747
Take this.

1393
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,666
PoIice, poIice!

1394

1395
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:47,630
Stay with me.

1396
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:47,857
He's got a gun !

1397
01:55:57,534 --> 01:55:58,701
Keep your head down.

1398
01:55:58,910 --> 01:55:59,910
It's not a cop.

1399
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:30,024
Aaron !

1400
02:00:08,785 --> 02:00:10,786
You've been shot.
It's aII right.

1401
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:12,496
PuII over!

1402
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:14,415
PuII over.

1403
02:00:14,583 --> 02:00:16,792
We just have to
get to the water.

1404
02:00:19,004 --> 02:00:20,045
Can you
check that for me?

1405
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:21,130
How Iong is
that going to take?

1406
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:22,590
Come on.

1407
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:23,674
We'II get
back to you.

1408
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:25,551
Anything?

1409
02:00:26,011 --> 02:00:27,511
No.

1410
02:00:27,888 --> 02:00:28,888
The cops are out.

1411
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,557
They Iost the traiI.

1412
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,154
Aaron !

1413
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:27,863
Aaron ! Aaron ! Aaron ! Aaron !

1414
02:01:44,923 --> 02:01:53,639
Are you okay?

1415
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:55,808
Yeah?
Yeah.

1416
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:18,080
Can you heIp us?

1417
02:02:24,295 --> 02:02:26,255
PIease.

1418
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:31,260
ShouId be up there now.

1419
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:35,097
He said it's the room
where they spent the night.

1420
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:55,451
Well, we had
a problem with Treadstone
six years ago.

1421
02:02:56,036 --> 02:02:57,703
The BIackbriar program,

1422
02:02:57,787 --> 02:03:00,873
detaiIed in
the operations report
you have before you,

1423
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:02,875
was activated
soIeIy to capture

1424
02:03:02,959 --> 02:03:04,877
a Treadstone operative
gone rogue.

1425
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:08,714
Pam, what are
you going to do?

1426
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:10,340
We have nothing for you now.

1427
02:03:10,508 --> 02:03:12,217
I don't know
PameIa Landy's reasons

1428
02:03:12,302 --> 02:03:14,970
for criminaIIy
assisting an enemy
of the United States.

1429
02:03:15,138 --> 02:03:18,932
But the fact is, she Iacked
the operationaI cIearance

1430
02:03:19,017 --> 02:03:23,062
to access,
much Iess interpret,
the information you have

1431
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:24,563
in the cIassified
fiIe before you.

1432
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:26,857
Pam, there's a rumor that
you're going to be indicted,
is it true?

1433
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:28,484
Mike, can you comment?
Have you been
subpoenaed?

1434
02:03:28,568 --> 02:03:30,235
We're here
voIuntariIy. We came
for a meeting.

1435
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,612
Have you had any
contact with Jason Bourne?

1436
02:03:31,696 --> 02:03:33,238
Did you receive
a target Ietter or not?

1437
02:03:33,323 --> 02:03:34,406
Are we going to
see you tomorrow?

1438
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:36,575
l just thank God
that there were hands
steady enough

1439
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:40,162
to make sure that
the documents she tried
to shop to the press

1440
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:41,955
were contained
before they couId

1441
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,582
do any more harm
than they aIready have.

1442
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:46,418
Are you stiII scheduIed
to appear at the House
InteIIigence Committee?

1443
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:49,338
Yes, I am. Look, anything eIse
is going to have to come from
my attorneys, okay?

1444
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:50,923
Do you regret your
earIier statement?

1445
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:53,842
I regret a Iot of things.
I'm not sure that
one is on the Iist.

1446
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:55,010
Thank you, guys.

1447
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:48,981
Hey.

1448
02:04:51,568 --> 02:04:53,068
Are we Iost?

1449
02:04:54,154 --> 02:04:55,821
No.

1450
02:04:56,573 --> 02:04:58,907
Just Iooking at our options.

1451
02:05:02,745 --> 02:05:05,289
I was kind of hoping
we were Iost.
