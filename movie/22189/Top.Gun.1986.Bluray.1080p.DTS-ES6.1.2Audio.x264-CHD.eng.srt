1
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:10,245
- Morning, Scott.
- Morning, Vince.

2
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,216
- Morning, Wells.
- Morning, sir.

3
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,324
Ghost Rider, this is Strike.

4
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:20,489
We have unknown aircraft. Inbound, Mustang.

5
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,297
Your vector, 0-9-0 for bogey.

6
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,537
Who's up there?

7
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:37,212
Cougar and Merlin
and Maverick and Goose.

8
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:40,510
Great. Maverick and Goose.

9
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:50,920
Talk to me, Goose.

10
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:54,155
Roger, I got him.
Contact, 20 left at 30 miles.

11
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:56,058
Nine hundred knots closure.

12
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:57,289
Cougar, you hear that?

13
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,158
Roger.

14
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:02,599
- Merlin, you got him?
- Roger, I've got radar contact.

15
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:04,773
I'll get a visual ID.
Cougar, you hook him.

16
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,841
Roger, and I'll clean him and fry him.

17
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:17,816
Mustang, Mustang, this is Ghost Rider, 2-0-3,

18
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,285
I've got him inbound, bogey heading 2-7-0,

19
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,118
We're at ten miles, 900 knots closure,

20
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,160
Ghost Rider, take Angels ten left, 3-0.

21
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:28,830
Are we supposed to have visitors today?

22
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,862
Negative, sir.

23
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:40,375
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

24
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,538
Goose, you see a trailer?

25
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,505
Negative, Merlin.

26
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:47,749
Looks like he's a single.

27
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,815
Cougar, I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.

28
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,214
Take it easy, Maverick. I don't like this shit.

29
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,719
I'm gonna break high and right,
see if he's really alone.

30
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,900
We've got 1000 knots closure, Mav.

31
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:17,409
He's coming right at us.

32
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,342
Okay, buddy, what's on your mind?

33
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,176
Holy shit, there's two of them.

34
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,911
MiG-28s. No one's been this close before.

35
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,216
What the hell are they doing here?
What's the position?

36
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,290
Two hundred and fifty miles out, sir.

37
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:33,257
Two hundred and fifty miles? Get them out.

38
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:38,627
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

39
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:42,127
I lost him in the sun.

40
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,570
Shit. What's he doing? You got him, Merlin?

41
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,908
He's coming around.
He's coming around on our tail.

42
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:53,745
Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.

43
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,800
- What's their range now?
- Two hundred miles, sir.

44
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:03,312
If they break 150 miles, launch the Alert Five aircraft.

45
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:04,577
Yes, sir.

46
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:08,660
Air speed, 300. Go get him, Mav.

47
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:10,661
I'm going for missile lock.

48
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,833
Let's see if we can scare this guy out of here.

49
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:19,004
Come on, lock up, baby.
Lock up, baby. Lock up.

50
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,143
I got him locked. Bingo.

51
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:29,243
We got him, Mav. He's bugging out and going home.

52
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:32,785
Mustang, this is Maverick. MiG two is headed home.

53
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:34,782
All right. What's their position?

54
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,754
A hundred and eighty miles at bearing 0-1-0, sir.

55
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:43,955
Cougar, he's got missile lock on us.
Get away from this guy.

56
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,134
What the hell is this shit? He's engaging me.

57
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:51,200
Goddamn it, Mustang.
This is Ghost Rider, 1-1-7.

58
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:52,396
This bogey's all over me.

59
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,599
He's got missile lock on me. Permission to fire?

60
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,801
Do not fire until fired upon.

61
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,442
Goose, there they are, right below us.

62
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,312
The MiG's in perfect firing position.
He's right on Cougar's tail.

63
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,249
No way, Goose.
He'd have fired by now.

64
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:07,615
He's just trying to piss us off.

65
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,355
Maverick, get down here and get this asshole off me.

66
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,619
Easy, Cougar.

67
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,531
Bring it back, hard right. Help me engage.

68
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,536
I'm on my way.

69
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:39,384
I can't shoot this son of a bitch.

70
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:42,182
Let's see if we can have a little fun with him.

71
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,720
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?

72
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:53,759
Greetings.

73
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,430
Watch the birdie.

74
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:02,372
Jeez, I crack myself up.

75
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:12,013
This is a great shot, Mav. I should be a photographer.

76
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,384
Cougar...

77
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,922
...your tail is clear. MiG one's bugged out.

78
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,469
Cougar, this is Maverick.

79
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,372
We've had enough fun for one day, don't you think?

80
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:35,369
I'm getting a little low on fuel, so we're heading home.

81
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,379
We'll see you on deck.

82
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,751
Cougar, we're running low on gas,
we gotta get out of here.

83
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:55,425
Cougar.

84
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:01,164
We're on vapor, Cougar. Let's do it.

85
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:06,005
Cougar. Come on, Cougar.

86
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:18,044
Let's take it back to the ship, man, Come on, Cougar,

87
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,789
Get him on deck as soon as possible.
He's gotta be low on fuel.

88
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:24,457
Cougar, we gotta land this thing.

89
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,357
We are way low on gas. You understand me?

90
00:10:28,864 --> 00:10:30,263
You all right, man?

91
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:40,032
Maverick, you're at three-quarters of a mile, call the ball,

92
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,834
Roger. Maverick has the ball.

93
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,710
Cougar, it is time to land, Let's do it,

94
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:46,938
Goose, Cougar's in trouble.

95
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,350
Come on, Mav, we're getting low on gas.
Let's land this sucker.

96
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,614
Cougar,

97
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:02,162
Goddamn it, Maverick.

98
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:04,025
What are you doing, Mav?
We've got no fuel for this.

99
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,359
We're going after Cougar.

100
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,971
You tell him to land that plane. That's an order.

101
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,674
Ghost Rider, you are instructed to land,

102
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,308
Land immediately,

103
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,974
Any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here?

104
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:26,349
Mav, we got a little problem up here.
That MiG really screwed him up.

105
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,489
I don't think he can make it back.

106
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:34,552
You're okay, Cougar. Just stay on my wing,

107
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:38,065
I'll take you all the way in. Just stay with me.

108
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:56,342
Easy, Cougar. Just a walk in the park, buddy.

109
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:01,349
You're a little low.
You're a little low, Coug.

110
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,252
Come on, buddy, pull up.

111
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,088
Pull up, Cougar.

112
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:11,190
That's it. Almost there.

113
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,164
You're a little below glide path, three-quarters of a mile,

114
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,427
Call the ball,

115
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,099
Roger, ball,

116
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,552
We're too low, Cougar.
We're too low, Cougar.

117
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:34,780
Increase power. Some more power!

118
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,131
Come in.

119
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,233
Sir.

120
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,268
Cougar, you should be in sickbay.
What's on your mind?

121
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:57,638
My wife and kid, sir.

122
00:12:57,846 --> 00:13:00,713
I almost orphaned him today, and I've never even seen him.

123
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:05,469
I don't know what happened up there, but I was so scared.

124
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:09,082
- Come on, we've seen this before.
- No, sir.

125
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:12,259
I'm holding on too tight.

126
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:19,425
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

127
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:27,640
Cougar.

128
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:32,075
Thanks, Maverick.

129
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,976
Maverick, Goose, come in here.

130
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:40,211
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

131
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,022
Shit.

132
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:49,961
Maverick, you just did an incredibly brave thing.

133
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,995
What you should have done was land your plane.

134
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,729
You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do.

135
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,000
Son, your ego is writing checks your body can't cash.

136
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,977
You've been busted.
You lost your qualifications as section leader three times.

137
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:08,513
Put in hack twice by me.

138
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:12,983
With a history of high-speed passes over five air-control towers

139
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,712
and one admiral's daughter.

140
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:17,350
Penny Benjamin?

141
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,994
- And you, asshole. You're lucky to be here.
- Thank you, sir.

142
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:25,763
Let's not bullshit, Maverick,
your family name ain't the best in the Navy.

143
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:30,430
You need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy.
Now, what is it with you?

144
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,874
Just wanna serve my country,
be the best fighter pilot in Navy, sir.

145
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:35,703
Don't screw around with me, Maverick.

146
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:39,211
You're a hell of an instinctive pilot. Maybe too good.

147
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,611
I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't.
I got another problem here.

148
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,786
I gotta send somebody from this squadron to Miramar.

149
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:51,059
I gotta do something here.
I still can't believe it.

150
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,988
I gotta give you your dream shot.
I'm gonna send you up against the best.

151
00:14:55,197 --> 00:15:00,368
You two characters are going to Top Gun.

152
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,901
For five weeks,
you're gonna fly against the best fighter pilots in the world.

153
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,301
You were number two, Cougar was number one.

154
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:09,204
Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.

155
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:10,776
You guys are number one.

156
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:16,911
But you remember one thing: You screw up just this much,

157
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:20,953
you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.

158
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:23,124
Yes, sir.

159
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:27,887
That is all.

160
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:30,326
You can tell me about the MiG some other time.

161
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,329
Gentlemen.

162
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:34,399
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

163
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,093
Thank you.

164
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,949
During Korea, the Navy kill ratio was 12-to-1.

165
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,174
We shot down 12 of their jets for every one of ours.

166
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:26,316
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1.

167
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,785
Our pilots become dependent upon missiles.

168
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:31,323
They had lost some of their dogfighting skills.

169
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:35,629
Top Gun was created to teach ACM: Air Combat Maneuvering.

170
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:36,889
Dogfighting.

171
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,566
This gives me a hard-on.

172
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,463
By the end of Vietnam, that ratio was back up to 12-to-1.

173
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,661
- Don't tease me.
- Blinds, please.

174
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,366
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at Top Gun.

175
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,841
The very first man to win the Top Gun trophy.

176
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:54,573
You will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world.

177
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,147
Commander Mike Metcalf. Callsign: Viper.

178
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:00,446
Gentlemen.

179
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:05,092
You are the top one percent of all naval aviators.

180
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:10,194
The elite. The best of the best.

181
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,134
We'll make you better.

182
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,903
You'll fly at least two combat missions a day,

183
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:19,570
attend classes in between and evaluations of your performance.

184
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:23,609
On each combat sequence, you're gonna meet a different challenge.

185
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,738
Every encounter is gonna be much more difficult.

186
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:29,437
We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14 right to the edge of the envelope,

187
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,813
faster than you've ever flown before

188
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,714
and more dangerous.

189
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:37,758
Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen.

190
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,621
Elected officials, civilians do that.

191
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:43,696
We are the instruments of that policy.

192
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:48,463
And although we're not at war,
we must always act as though we are at war.

193
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,637
What are you doing?

194
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:53,932
- The tip of the spear best be sharp.
- I'm just wondering who's the best.

195
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,736
In case some of you wonder who the best is,

196
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,277
they're up here on this plaque on the wall.

197
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:03,212
The best driver and his RIO from each class has his name on it.

198
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,586
And they have the option to come back here to be Top Gun instructors.

199
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:14,027
You think your name's gonna be on that plaque?

200
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,825
Yes, sir.

201
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,398
That's pretty arrogant, considering the company you're in.

202
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:24,600
Yes, sir.

203
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,402
I like that in a pilot.

204
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,309
Just remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

205
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,114
Gentlemen, this school is about combat.

206
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,615
There are no points for second place.

207
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:43,513
Dismissed.

208
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,454
Nice going.

209
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:51,797
The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies' room.

210
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:58,057
Oh, Jesus. Oh, you kill me. You really do.

211
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,609
No, no, no. There's two O's in "Goose", boys.

212
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:20,527
This is what I call a target-rich environment.

213
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,959
You live your life between your legs, Mav.

214
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:25,656
Goose, even you could get laid in a place like this.

215
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:30,065
I'm telling you, I'd be happy to find a girl who'd talk dirty to me.

216
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:37,275
Mav, you wanted to know who the best is?

217
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,741
That's him. Iceman.

218
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:43,048
That's the way he flies, ice-cold, no mistakes.

219
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:48,414
Just wears you down. You get bored, frustrated,
do something stupid, and he's got you.

220
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,450
Hey, hey, Slider.

221
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,787
Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man. What happened?

222
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:56,763
Goose, you're such a dickhead.
Whose butt did you kiss to get in here?

223
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,865
Well, the list is long but distinguished.

224
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,591
Well, so is my johnson.

225
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,531
So you're flying with Iceman, huh?

226
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,331
- It's Mr. Iceman to you.
- Hey, Mother Goose. How's it going?

227
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,668
Good, Tom. This is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazansky.

228
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,771
- Congratulations on Top Gun.
- Thank you.

229
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,174
Sorry to hear about Cougar.

230
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,144
He and I were like brothers in flight school.

231
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,614
- He was a good man.
- Still is a good man.

232
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,684
Yeah, that's what I meant.

233
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,356
- Thought so.
- Say, you need any help?

234
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,519
With what?

235
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,093
You figured it out yet?

236
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:29,354
What's that?

237
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,363
Who's the best pilot.

238
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,797
No, I think I can figure that one out on my own.

239
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:39,138
I heard that about you. You like to work alone.

240
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,504
Mav, you must've soloed under a lucky star, huh?

241
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:46,112
I mean, first the MiG,
and then you guys slide into Cougar's spot.

242
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,874
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.
It was ours, okay?

243
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:51,814
Some pilots wait their whole career just to see a MiG up close.

244
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:54,115
Guess you guys are lucky and famous, huh?

245
00:20:54,322 --> 00:20:56,756
No, you mean notorious.

246
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,121
- I'll see you later.
- You can count on it.

247
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:03,220
They were abused children.

248
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:06,766
- We're gonna have a good time.
- Always.

249
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:13,165
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?

250
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,536
All right, the bet is $20.

251
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:17,041
- Twenty dollars.
- Right.

252
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:22,046
You have to have carnal knowledge,
of a lady this time, on the premises.

253
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,774
On the premises.

254
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,711
Come on, Mav. A bet's a bet.

255
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:32,258
I don't know, it just--
It just doesn't seem fair. For you, I mean.

256
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,420
But... she's lost that loving feeling.

257
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,758
- She's lost--? No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has.

258
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,992
- She has not lost that--
- Goose, she's lost it.

259
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,464
Mav-- Come on.

260
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,868
I hate it when she does that. Shit.

261
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:51,874
Excuse me, miss.

262
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,481
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

263
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:59,279
<i>You never close your eyes anymore</i>

264
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>When I kiss your lips</i>

265
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:10,128
<i>There's no tenderness like before
In your fingertips</i>

266
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:13,631
<i>You're trying hard not to show it</i>

267
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,530
<i>Baby</i>

268
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:21,198
<i>But, baby, believe me, I know it</i>

269
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:30,216
<i>You've lost that loving feeling
That loving feeling</i>

270
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:33,512
<i>You've lost that loving feeling</i>

271
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:37,590
<i>Now it's gone, gone, gone</i>

272
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:45,591
Sit down.

273
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:47,600
Thank you.

274
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:53,903
<i>Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you</i>

275
00:22:55,877 --> 00:23:00,543
I love that song. I've never seen that approach.

276
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:02,376
How long have you two been doing this act?

277
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:05,451
- Oh, I don't know, since...
- Puberty?

278
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,553
Right, puberty.

279
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,384
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

280
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,052
Maverick? Did your mother not like you or something?

281
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,230
No, it's my callsign.

282
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:19,734
- You're a pilot.
- That's right, a naval aviator.

283
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:24,131
No, actually, we've only done this twice.

284
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,239
Oh, how'd you do?

285
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:29,569
Crashed and burned on the first one. It wasn't pretty.

286
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:32,971
- The second?
- I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow.

287
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:35,775
But it's looking good so far.

288
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,345
Well, Maverick,

289
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:43,956
my friend's just arrived, so it's been great talking to you.

290
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,126
- Perry.
- Hi.

291
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:49,456
Hi. Here you go. I'll be with you in just a second, okay?

292
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:55,168
Listen, can I ask you a personal question?

293
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,031
That depends.

294
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:00,770
Are you a good pilot?

295
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,907
I can hold my own.

296
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:06,080
Great.

297
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:11,150
Then I won't have to worry about you making your living as a singer.

298
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:19,249
I'm gonna need a beer to put these flames out. Yo!

299
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,486
Great, Mav. Real slick.

300
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:49,514
It was a long cruise, was it, sailor?

301
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,521
It was too long.

302
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:55,662
What did you wanna do,
just drop right down on the tile and go for it?

303
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:59,857
No, I actually had--
Had this counter in mind.

304
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:02,967
Great, that would be very, very comfortable. Yeah.

305
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:05,105
It could be.

306
00:25:07,408 --> 00:25:14,004
Actually,
I came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy.

307
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:20,753
Really?
So I could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like yourself?

308
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:25,593
Maybe. No?

309
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,988
I've gotta be at work very early in the morning.

310
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:30,096
Then what are you doing here?

311
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,764
Your friend was magnificent.

312
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,335
No.

313
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,069
Now, you'll also be trained and evaluated by a few civilian specialists.

314
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:50,343
The civilians are here because they are our very best source of information on enemy aircraft.

315
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:54,753
One of the most qualified is our TAGREP,
callsign: Charlie.

316
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:56,947
She has a Ph.D. in astrophysics,

317
00:25:57,158 --> 00:26:00,423
and she's also a civilian contractor,
so you do not salute her.

318
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:04,198
But you better listen to her,
because the Pentagon listens to her about your proficiency.

319
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:06,993
- It's all yours, Charlie.
- Thank you.

320
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,366
Hello.

321
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:14,304
We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s as our MiG simulators.

322
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,067
Now, then, as most of you know,

323
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:21,441
the F-5 doesn't have the thrust-to-weight ratio the MiG-28 has.

324
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:25,551
And it doesn't bleed energy below 300 knots, like the MiG-28.

325
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:31,424
However, the MiG-28 does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks.

326
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:34,595
It won't do a negative-G pushover.

327
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:37,822
The latest intelligence tells us that the most it will do

328
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:40,432
is one negative--

329
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:42,694
Excuse me, lieutenant.

330
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,428
Is there something wrong?

331
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:47,107
Yes, ma'am, the data on the MiG is inaccurate.

332
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,869
How's that, lieutenant?

333
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:54,037
- Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28 do--
- We, we.

334
00:26:54,242 --> 00:26:55,436
Sorry, Goose.

335
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,913
We happened to see a MiG-28 do a four-G negative dive.

336
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:03,818
Where did you see this?

337
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,892
- That's classified.
- It's what?

338
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:08,824
It's classified.

339
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,588
I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you.

340
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,824
Lieutenant, I have top-secret clearance.

341
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:16,833
The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.

342
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,599
Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so in this case, now, does it?

343
00:27:22,377 --> 00:27:26,777
So, lieutenant... where exactly were you?

344
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,908
- Well, we...
- Thank you.

345
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:33,780
...started up on his 6 when he pulled through the clouds,
and then I moved in above him.

346
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:36,980
Well, if you were directly above him, how could you see him?

347
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:40,319
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.

348
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,998
No, he was, man. It was a really great move.

349
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:45,893
He was inverted.

350
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:51,361
You were in a four-G inverted dive with a MiG-28?

351
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,039
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:56,438
- At what range?
- About two meters.

353
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,339
It was actually about one and a half, I think.

354
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,571
It was one and a half.
I've got a great Polaroid of it.

355
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:02,374
He's right there. It must be one and a half.

356
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:05,416
- It was a nice picture.
- Lieutenant.

357
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:08,988
What were you doing there?

358
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:12,521
- Communicating.
- Communicating.

359
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:14,286
Keeping up foreign relations.

360
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:17,723
I was... You know, giving him the bird.

361
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:22,031
- You know, the finger.
- Yes, I know the finger, Goose.

362
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,830
I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.

363
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,738
Excuse me.

364
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,671
So you're the one.

365
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:32,537
Yes, ma'am.

366
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:34,647
All right, gentlemen, we have a hop to take.

367
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,546
The hard deck on this hop will be 10000 feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.

368
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:42,348
Move it.

369
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:48,188
Lieutenant.

370
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:52,331
Okay, well, don't be late again.
You look great, honey.

371
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,058
Thanks, dear. See you in preflight.

372
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,365
Lieutenant,
why didn't you tell me that you were the famous MiG insulter?

373
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:01,201
Would it have made any difference?

374
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,274
Not in the ladies' room, no.

375
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:05,173
What would've?

376
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:06,778
I'm an instructor at this school.

377
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:09,541
I see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks.

378
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:12,151
Now, I'm sure you can figure that out.

379
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:14,446
Look, lieutenant.

380
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:18,421
I'd just really like to hear about the MiG sometime.

381
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:23,090
You've got security clearance.
You can read about it.

382
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,499
Maverick...

383
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:34,171
...I'm curious.

384
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:40,671
Who was covering Cougar while you were showboating with this MiG?

385
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:43,851
Cougar was doing just fine.

386
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:46,851
Gentlemen, this is your first hop,

387
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:50,788
The jets you are flying against are smaller, faster and more maneuverable,

388
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:52,050
just like the enemy MiGs,

389
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,662
The clock is ticking and as of now,
we are keeping score,

390
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:55,993
The clock is ticking and as of now,
we are keeping score,

391
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:58,131
I lost him, Goose.

392
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,626
Show me what you got, kid.

393
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:04,936
- I lost him.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

394
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,001
I got him, I got him.
He's on our tail, coming hard.

395
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,178
I got him. I got him. Here we go.

396
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,620
All right, talk to me, Goose.

397
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:29,061
He's still back there. He's closing in on us.
He's closing fast.

398
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,231
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

399
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:38,398
Come on, Jester.
Let's see if I can give you a run for your money here.

400
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:46,847
Watch the mountains.

401
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,823
I still got him. He's still back there.

402
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,085
Come on, Mav. Do some of that pilot shit.

403
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,092
Yeah, I got him.

404
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,504
Come on, bring it right.

405
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,176
Goose, I've had about enough of this shit.

406
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:21,042
I'm gonna hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.

407
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,342
Okay, you're mine.

408
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,147
Jesus Christ.

409
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,691
Let's see what you've got now, Jester.

410
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,493
Okay, Mav, let's turn and burn.

411
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,817
He's going vertical, so am I.

412
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:02,421
We're going ballistic, Mav. Go get him.

413
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:14,695
He's going for the hard deck.
Let's get down there first and nail him, Mav.

414
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,836
No way, Jester, you're mine.

415
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:35,856
I got you now.

416
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,783
Jester's dead.

417
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:42,860
Jester's dead.

418
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:49,267
Get your butts above the hard deck and return to base immediately.

419
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,998
Yes, sir.

420
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,982
Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby.

421
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:06,351
Negative, Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.

422
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,488
No. No, Mav. This is not a good idea.

423
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:11,990
Sorry, Goose, but it's time to buzz the tower.

424
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:26,306
Goddamn son of a bitch.

425
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:32,335
Great balls of fire!

426
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,014
Jester's dead.

427
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:39,686
- You won? That's bullshit.
- Didn't everybody?

428
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,878
Hell, no, man, we got our butts kicked.

429
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:45,024
Thirty seconds. We went like this, he went like that.

430
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:50,163
I said to Hollywood, "Where'd he go?"
Hollywood said, "Where'd who go?"

431
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,992
Yeah, and he's laughing at us,
right on the radio. He's laughing at us.

432
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,428
No, it's me laughing, dickhead.

433
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:57,866
- We won.
- All right.

434
00:33:58,072 --> 00:33:59,937
They won too, man.

435
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,268
- That's not what I heard.
- No, we did, we got Jester.

436
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:05,707
No, no. Below the hard deck does not count.

437
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:08,575
Hard deck, my ass.
We nailed that son of a bitch.

438
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:11,616
- You guys really are cowboys.
- What's your problem, Kazansky?

439
00:34:13,788 --> 00:34:15,653
You're everyone's problem.

440
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:18,381
That's because every time you go up in the air,
you're unsafe.

441
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:20,351
I don't like you because you're dangerous.

442
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:24,827
That's right, Iceman.

443
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,522
I am dangerous.

444
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,637
Maverick, you and Goose get
your butts out of that flight gear

445
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,535
and up to Viper's office now.

446
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:42,746
Remember, boys, no points for second place.

447
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,145
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- You shut up, okay?

448
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,445
- Don't worry, Goose, don't worry.
- Okay, I will.

449
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:51,989
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys did a flyby on my tower at over 400 knots!

450
00:34:52,193 --> 00:34:55,629
I want somebody's butt. I want it now. I've had it.

451
00:34:56,464 --> 00:34:59,524
Goddamn it! That's twice.

452
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,826
I want some butts!

453
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,101
Well, that'll just about cover the flybys.

454
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:08,436
Follow me.

455
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,274
Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day.

456
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:24,553
The hard deck for this hop was 10000 feet.

457
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:26,851
You knew it, you broke it.

458
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:32,499
You followed Commander Heatherly below after he lost sight of you and called no joy.

459
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,798
Why?

460
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:41,369
Sir. I had Commander Heatherly in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill.

461
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:44,738
He then proceeded below the hard deck.

462
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:48,244
We weren't below 10000 for more than a few seconds.

463
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:52,442
I had the shot, there was no danger, so I took it.

464
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:58,084
You took it. And broke a major rule of engagement.

465
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,727
Then you broke another one with that circus-stunt flyby.

466
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:08,160
Lieutenant Mitchell, Top Gun rules of engagement exist

467
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,996
for your safety and for that of your team.

468
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:13,405
They are not flexible, nor am I.

469
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:16,800
Either obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?

470
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:19,902
Yes, sir.

471
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:29,923
Dismissed.

472
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:38,127
I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot.

473
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:40,698
Holy shit.

474
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,403
Maybe I could learn how to be a truck driver.

475
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,001
Mav, you have the number of that truck-driving school

476
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,734
we saw on TV?
Truck Master, I think it is.

477
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:52,037
I might need that.

478
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:57,144
His fitness report says it all.
He's a wild card.

479
00:36:57,351 --> 00:37:00,912
Flies by the seat of his pants.
Completely unpredictable.

480
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:05,311
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

481
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:10,689
Maverick. I flew with his old man.

482
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:18,797
Tell me one thing.
If you had to go into battle, would you want him with you?

483
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,764
I don't know.

484
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,133
I just don't know.

485
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:38,616
- You still awake?
- Yeah.

486
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:42,429
What's up?

487
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:44,723
Can't sleep.

488
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,099
You know, when I first realized that we were going to Top Gun,

489
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:51,567
all I could think about was getting that trophy.

490
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,739
I gotta be straight with you, Mav.

491
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:58,942
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

492
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:04,783
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.

493
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:12,183
Yeah, I guess that flyby wasn't such a big hit.

494
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:18,891
Look, man, I know it's tough for you.

495
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,795
They wouldn't let you in the academy because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.

496
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,065
You have to live with that reputation.

497
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:29,704
But it's like every time we go up there,
it's like you're flying against a ghost.

498
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:33,145
It makes me nervous.

499
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:40,409
You're the only family I've got.

500
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:43,419
I'm not gonna let you down. I promise you.

501
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,800
Get out of here.

502
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:15,049
A rolling reversal would work well in that situation.

503
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,918
If I reversed on a hard cross,
I could immediately go to guns on them.

504
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:23,358
Yeah, but at that speed, it's too fast.

505
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:25,225
It's a little bit too aggressive.

506
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:27,866
Too aggressive.

507
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:33,396
Yeah, I guess when I see something,
I go right after it.

508
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,270
You didn't tell me who you were the other night.

509
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:39,946
You didn't give me a chance, did you?

510
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:41,371
You deserved it.

511
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:51,080
I know. But you were tempted to ask me out for dinner.

512
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:52,949
- No.
- No?

513
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,957
No. I don't date students.

514
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,103
I can see it's dangerous for you.

515
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:13,642
But if the government trusts me, maybe you could.

516
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:23,215
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

517
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,905
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

518
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,407
Slider...

519
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,882
...you stink.

520
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:00,921
Let's go.

521
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,686
Okay, Ice, hit it.

522
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:18,036
That's good. Come on.

523
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:19,379
Let's go, now.

524
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:34,987
Come on, Mav, 4-7. Let's get them.
Those guys are animals.

525
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,532
Let's go.

526
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:45,199
Good serve, good serve.

527
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:10,222
That's game.

528
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:13,391
Okay. Fake block, stay down.
We'll just take them.

529
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,565
Come on, where you guys going?
You walking away?

530
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:21,468
We won, we won.

531
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:24,908
Mav. Mav. Come on, man.
Just one more game. That evens it up.

532
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:26,409
- Come on, we can take them.
- No.

533
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:29,081
- No, we can, we got it.
- I got some things I gotta take care of.

534
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,046
Take care of? Just one more game.

535
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,345
- Please? For me?
- I'm sorry.

536
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:34,885
You're sorry. Come on.

537
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:37,113
- Mother Goose, you pussy!
- For me?

538
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:11,615
Damn it.

539
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:24,304
Lieutenant?

540
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:32,640
What, no singing?

541
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:38,649
- Look, I'm-- I'm--
- No apologies.

542
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,451
If you don't mind, I'm--
I'm gonna just take a quick shower

543
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:51,130
while you're finishing up here.

544
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:57,837
Yeah, I do mind. I'm hungry.

545
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:04,365
And then I thought about it.

546
00:44:04,578 --> 00:44:06,341
I thought:

547
00:44:07,347 --> 00:44:09,372
"You know, Charlie, he's a smart guy.

548
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:13,011
Why don't you just tell him why you've got him here."

549
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:15,547
Well?

550
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,385
It's the MiG.

551
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,854
The MiG.

552
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:27,329
You're the only pilot who's been up against a MiG-28.

553
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:33,066
I'm trying for this big promotion at work, and if I get it,

554
00:44:33,273 --> 00:44:34,535
I'm not gonna be here much longer.

555
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:38,806
It seems to me you've got it all figured out.

556
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:40,978
Yeah.

557
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:45,140
Except you did forget the wine.

558
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:49,379
Sorry.

559
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:52,191
You always get what you want?

560
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:56,162
No, not always. Yeah, maybe.

561
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:58,863
Then relax about the MiG.

562
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:15,409
This music.

563
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,576
An old friend?

564
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:23,383
My folks loved it.

565
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,990
I haven't heard this in years.

566
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,885
My mother used to call down from her room

567
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:32,395
and have me play this over and over again.

568
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,796
I got so sick of it.

569
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,531
But not her, she....

570
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,870
Just sit up there alone, just listening, hours.

571
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,704
Just listening.

572
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,982
She died shortly after him.

573
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:54,086
What happened to your father?

574
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:01,951
I guess I kind of figured, with your security clearance,

575
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,790
you'd know more about him than I do.

576
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:09,734
Well, I didn't get that far.

577
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:13,837
Well, it's a big mystery.

578
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:20,370
He disappeared in an F-4, November 5th, 1965.

579
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:26,481
The stink of it was, he screwed up.

580
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:29,211
No way.

581
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,788
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

582
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:40,055
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

583
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:43,998
Somebody must know.

584
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:46,805
Yeah, somebody knows everything.

585
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:49,805
Is that why you're always second best up there?

586
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,843
You are direct, aren't you?

587
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,882
I'm sorry I was late.

588
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,454
I'm sorry for being direct.

589
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:11,494
No apologies.

590
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,994
This is gonna be complicated.

591
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,342
Where are you going?

592
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:32,849
I'm gonna take a shower.

593
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:42,261
Thank you. I enjoyed being here.

594
00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:21,893
It looks like you need another shower.

595
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,557
Right.

596
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:33,505
I'm gonna be honest with you.

597
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:39,413
Your MiG sighting is really important to my work, but...

598
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:48,150
I don't normally invite students to my house.

599
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,723
You're...

600
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:01,533
But please understand, I still have a job to do.

601
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:05,132
- Morning.
- Sir.

602
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,796
I'm glad we got that straight.

603
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,510
I told her how tough it is here.

604
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,450
You know, my ass dragging like an old, tired dog.

605
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:55,647
I told her that you didn't even have a woman here.

606
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,827
- Oh, really.
- You know what she said?

607
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:00,962
Said, "Well, he probably doesn't have one, he's got eight."

608
00:50:09,772 --> 00:50:11,501
Daddy.

609
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,583
So, Maverick,
Goose tells me you're in love with one of your instructors.

610
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:24,252
- Is that right?
- I-- I didn't tell her that.

611
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,648
Yes, you did.

612
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:27,618
- Yes, you did.
- I can't believe you said that.

613
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,792
- That was a secret.
- No.

614
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:38,991
The bogey has good position right here.
All right, freeze-frame.

615
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,400
Moment of choice.

616
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,535
The F-14 is defensive.

617
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,970
He has a chance to bug out right here.

618
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:50,112
Better to retire and save your aircraft

619
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,304
than push a bad position.

620
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:54,005
Charlie, jump in here anytime.

621
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,713
Now, you stay in that diamond another three seconds,

622
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,219
the bogey's gonna blow you out of the sky.

623
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:03,187
You take a hard right, select zone five,

624
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,691
you can extend an escape.

625
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,354
You made a bad choice.

626
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:10,556
Charlie.

627
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,763
Aircraft one performs a split S?

628
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:20,202
That's the last thing you should do.
The MiG's right on your tail.

629
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,503
Freeze there, please.

630
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:26,705
The MiG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking at this point?

631
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,349
You don't have time to think up there.

632
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,779
If you think, you're dead.

633
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:35,285
Well, that's a big gamble with a $30 million plane, lieutenant.

634
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,628
Unfortunately, the gamble worked.

635
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,631
The MiG never got a clean shot.

636
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,799
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here,

637
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:55,137
comes over the top,
and he defeats the bandit with a missile shot.

638
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,744
The encounter was a victory,

639
00:51:56,946 --> 00:52:00,780
but I think that we've shown it as an example of what not to do.

640
00:52:02,485 --> 00:52:03,452
Next.

641
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:07,651
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

642
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:16,594
Now, then, this is a perfect example of a textbook maneuver.

643
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:30,071
Lieutenant.

644
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,846
Maverick.

645
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:38,988
Lieutenant.

646
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,720
Lieutenant.

647
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:47,192
My review of your flight performance in the TACTS was right on,
in my professional opinion.

648
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,287
I can't hear you.

649
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,080
Jesus Christ! And you think I'm reckless.

650
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:16,725
When I fly,
I'll have you know that my crew and my plane come first!

651
00:53:16,926 --> 00:53:19,360
Well, I'm going to finish my sentence, lieutenant.

652
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:22,053
My review of your flight performance was right on.

653
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,698
- Is that right?
- That is right.

654
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:25,632
But I held something back.

655
00:53:25,968 --> 00:53:29,563
I see some real genius in your flying,
Maverick, but I can't say that in there.

656
00:53:29,772 --> 00:53:32,899
I was afraid that everyone in that TACTS trailer would see right through me.

657
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,979
And I just don't want anyone to know that I've fallen for you.

658
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,584
- Hey, Maverick.
- Yeah.

659
00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:26,755
You hear about Ice?

660
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,424
- What's that?
- He won another one.

661
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:31,718
- Really?
- Yeah.

662
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,253
I feel the need,

663
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,956
- the need for speed.
- The need for speed.

664
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,069
Gentlemen, this is hop 19,

665
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:45,365
Multiple aircraft, multiple bogies,

666
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:49,868
Your training is half over,
The competition for the Top Gun trophy remains tight,

667
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,341
First place, Iceman,

668
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:55,278
Second place, Maverick, just two points behind,

669
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:56,618
There they are.

670
00:55:57,086 --> 00:55:59,486
Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.
I don't think they see us yet.

671
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,713
Okay, I see them.

672
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:04,552
Two A-4s, left 10 o'clock level, continue left turn.

673
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:15,696
Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperature's 110 degrees.

674
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,338
Holy shit, it's Viper.

675
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,798
Viper's up here, great.

676
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,271
Oh, shit.

677
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:24,742
Great. He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."

678
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:26,346
Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that.

679
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:31,818
I've got my eye on the northern bogey.

680
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,579
Roger. I got the southern guy.

681
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,758
Hollywood, you've got the lead, I'll cover you.

682
00:56:51,073 --> 00:56:52,199
Break now, Jester.

683
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,506
Hollywood, we're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

684
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,649
Roger, I'm on him.

685
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,750
Goose, find Viper. He's out there somewhere.

686
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:11,051
Stay with Hollywood, Mav, we're covering his wing.

687
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,291
Goose, there's Viper. 3 o'clock, low.

688
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,363
Stay with Hollywood, Mav. We're his cover.

689
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,932
Don't you leave me, Maverick.

690
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,695
Hollywood, you're looking good.

691
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:23,201
I'm going after Viper.

692
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,033
Goddamn you, Maverick.

693
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:29,575
Mav, don't leave him.

694
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,441
Goose, Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.

695
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,949
Stand by. Viper's coming down.

696
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:48,653
Holy shit, we're head-to-head.
I can't believe we're doing this.

697
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:06,175
Rocking roll. Here's our chance.
It's a big one, Goose.

698
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,978
Come on, goddamn it.

699
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,147
Come on, Mav, keep coming.

700
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,758
Okay. Sidewinder missile selected.

701
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:23,864
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

702
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:26,830
Come around, come around.
That's it, that's it.

703
00:58:32,808 --> 00:58:33,832
Jesus, this guy's good.

704
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,937
Goose, where's he going?

705
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:39,106
Come on, come on, come on, keep coming. Keep coming.

706
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:45,116
Come on, baby.

707
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,321
Damn, this kid's good.

708
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,791
He's too close for missiles,
Goose, I'm switching to guns.

709
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:00,128
Come on, come on, come on.

710
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:06,131
Stick with me, stick with me.

711
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,512
What--? Hold it. Goose, check our tail.

712
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,147
Shit. There's Jester.

713
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:15,847
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

714
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,815
Shit.

715
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,018
The Defense Department regrets to inform you

716
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:22,349
that your sons are dead because they were stupid.

717
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:25,551
Great balls of fire.

718
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:29,762
Okay, knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

719
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:38,537
Thirty seconds, Wolfman, and I'm coming in.

720
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,232
- Shut up!
- God, buttnose.

721
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,674
That was some of the best flying I've seen yet,

722
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:46,143
right up the part where you got killed.

723
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:49,078
You never, never leave your wingman.

724
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,987
Maverick...

725
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,360
...it's not your flying, it's your attitude.

726
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:08,335
The enemy's dangerous,
but right now you're worse than the enemy.

727
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,001
You're dangerous and foolish.

728
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,034
You may not like the guys flying with you,

729
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:17,311
they may not like you, but whose side are you on?

730
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:29,151
Well, at least Viper got Iceman before he got us.

731
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,827
We still got a shot at it.

732
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,661
That was stupid. I know better than that.

733
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,096
It'll never happen again.

734
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:42,868
I know.

735
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,873
I know.

736
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,847
<i>You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain</i>

737
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:33,988
<i>Thinking about your love
Drives a man insane</i>

738
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,750
<i>You break my will
Oh, what a thrill</i>

739
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,860
<i>Goodness gracious
Great balls of fire</i>

740
01:01:40,062 --> 01:01:44,196
Maverick, would you go fetch him?
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

741
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,699
Goose? Hell, no. Well, there was the time...

742
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,495
- Admiral's daughter.
- What?!

743
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:50,831
Come on.

744
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:56,105
He told me all about the time you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

745
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,537
Did he? Well, that's great.

746
01:01:58,747 --> 01:02:00,977
He tells me about all of them, Maverick.

747
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:04,516
How my little angel Goose goes home early for church,

748
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,780
and you, you always go home with the hot women.

749
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,355
All right, thank you, Carole.

750
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:12,459
I'm gonna go embarrass myself with Goose for a while.

751
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,497
<i>You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain</i>

752

754
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,076
<i>Goodness gracious
Great balls of fire</i>

755
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,106
I would love to be able to warn you off about Maverick,

756
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:36,284
but I just love him to death.

757
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:40,186
You know, I've known Pete for a lot of years now,

758
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,323
and I'm telling you, one thing's for certain.

759
01:02:42,524 --> 01:02:46,984
There are hearts breaking wide open all over the world tonight.

760
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,723
- Why?
- Because unless you are a fool,

761
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,696
that boy is off the market.

762
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:57,703
He is 100 percent, prime-time in love with you.

763
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,840
Hey, Goose, you big stud!

764
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,101
That's me, honey.

765
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:06,714
- Take me to bed or lose me forever.
- Show me the way home, honey.

766
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,081
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

767
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:16,781
<i>You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain</i>

771
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,647
Maverick...

772
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:50,788
...you big stud, take me to bed or lose me forever.

773
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:08,374
Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31,
Two weeks to graduation,

774
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:11,603
Top Gun trophy is still up for grabs,
so every point counts,

775
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,651
Well, it's bottom of the ninth, the score is tied.
It's time for the big one.

776
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,192
You up for this one, Maverick?

777
01:05:00,462 --> 01:05:02,657
Just a walk in the park, Kazansky.

778
01:05:06,835 --> 01:05:09,167
Contact. Multiple bogies, 1-6-5.

779
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,566
Two miles. Looks like they're going away from us.

780
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,673
Ho, I see them, tallyho, right 2 o'clock. I'm in.

781
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,344
I'm in.

782
01:05:35,864 --> 01:05:37,991
That son of a bitch cut me off.

783
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:50,335
Come on, come on. Jesus Christ.
Ice, take the shot.

784
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,274
Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there.

785
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,608
I can't get the angle.
I'm too close for missiles.

786
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,011
I'm switching to guns.

787
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:57,952
Ice, fire or clear.

788
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,227
Look at this! Jesus Christ,
I can take a shot right here!

789
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:10,295
I need another 20 seconds, then I've got it.

790
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:17,763
I'm moving in. I've got the shot.

791
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:21,773
Come on, Mav, let's get in there!
Come on, Mav!

792
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:23,945
Maverick's getting impatient.
Come on, take the shot.

793
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,704
Ten more seconds, then I've got him.

794
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,650
Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there!
Let's do it, Mav.

795
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,548
Ice, come off high right. I'm in.

796
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:35,723
- Five more seconds.
- Come off high right, Ice. I'm in.

797
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:36,982
I'm off. Shit!

798
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:43,359
- We're in his jet wash!
- Holy shit!

799
01:06:46,468 --> 01:06:48,766
This is not good. Shit, we got a flameout, Mav.

800
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,632
Engine one is out.

801
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,329
Engine two is out!

802
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,236
Goose, I'm losing control. I'm losing control.

803
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,536
I can't control it. It won't recover.

804
01:06:56,745 --> 01:06:57,769
Shit.

805
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,748
It's coupling up, Mav! We're out of control.

806
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,650
This is not good! This is not good!

807
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:06,412
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin.

808
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,180
He's heading out to sea.

809
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,492
Altitude 8000, 7000.

810
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:16,863
Six. We're at six, Mav.

811
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:22,470
I'm pinned forward, Goose.
I can't reach the ejection handle.

812
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,538
Goose, you're gonna have to punch us out.

813
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:29,540
I can't reach the ejection handle. Eject.

814
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:31,542
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Eject! Eject!

815
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:34,147
Eject! Watch the canopy!

816
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:54,024
Goose! Goose! Oh, no!

817
01:07:57,439 --> 01:08:00,340
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God.

818
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:51,256
Sir, let go of him. You gotta let him go, sir.

819
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,227
How you doing?

820
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,296
I'm all right.

821
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,076
Goose is dead.

822
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,676
I know.

823
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:51,776
You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens.

824
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:56,682
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

825
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:03,521
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost eight of 18 aircraft. Ten men.

826
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,400
First one dies, you die too.

827
01:10:08,203 --> 01:10:13,340
But there will be others. You can count on it.

828
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,102
You gotta let him go.

829
01:10:20,515 --> 01:10:22,540
You gotta let him go.

830
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:41,735
I think maybe it was my fault.

831
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,334
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

832
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:57,375
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.

833
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,984
God, I want him back.

834
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,865
I'll be here if you need me, okay?

835
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,810
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

836
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:32,530
But he'd have flown anyway without you.

837
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:37,109
He'd have hated it, but he would've done it.

838
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:05,572
We find that the F-14 flat spin was induced by the disruption of airflow into the starboard engine.

839
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:12,343
This disruption stalled the engine,
which produced enough yaw rate

840
01:14:12,547 --> 01:14:17,348
to induce a spin which was unrecoverable.

841
01:14:17,552 --> 01:14:23,246
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell could either see or avoid the jet wash which produced the engine stall.

842
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:26,052
Therefore, the board of inquiry finds that Lieutenant Pete Mitchell

843
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,923
was not at fault in the accident of 29 July.

844
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:32,028
Lieutenant Mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident.

845
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:35,691
Lieutenant Mitchell is restored to flight status without further delay.

846
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,998
These proceedings are closed.

847
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:50,276
Get him up flying, soon.

848
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:18,913
Come on, kid, come on. Get in there. Engage.

849
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,207
All right, you got a bogey at 2 o'clock low, Maverick.

850
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,281
You got the angle. Piece of cake, pal.

851
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:29,118
Take the shot, kid. Take the shot.

852
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,959
You can engage any time, Maverick.

853
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:45,371
Hey, where the hell are you going?

854
01:15:45,573 --> 01:15:47,837
It's not good. It doesn't look good.

855
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:52,078
What do you mean, it doesn't look good?
It doesn't get to look any better than that.

856
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:08,593
Hey, man, we could've had him.
Hey, we could've had him, man!

857
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:13,100
I will fire when I am goddamn good and ready!

858
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:14,699
You got that?!

859
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:36,457
He can't get back in the saddle. Won't engage.

860
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:37,989
It's only been a few days.

861
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,588
You know, he just might not make it back.

862
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,662
Keep sending him up.

863
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,412
Mitchell...

864
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:10,591
...I'm sorry about Goose.

865
01:17:14,462 --> 01:17:16,430
Everybody liked him.

866
01:17:21,936 --> 01:17:23,335
I'm sorry.

867
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:45,158
Hi, it's Wolfman.

868
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,830
Yeah, Maverick just quit.

869
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:14,450
Excuse me.

870
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,251
May I?

871
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,757
Please.

872
01:18:27,735 --> 01:18:32,138
I'll have what he's having.

873
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,069
Hemlock, is it?

874
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:35,703
Ice water.

875
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,244
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

876
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,155
I heard you got that job in Washington. Congratulations.

877
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:52,186
Thanks.

878
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:57,356
But I wasn't gonna leave without saying goodbye.

879
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:02,900
It's good to see you.

880
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:05,366
Thanks.

881
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,565
Where you going?

882
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:12,208
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

883
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:17,879
Listen, I've seen all the evidence,
and it's not your responsibility.

884
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:24,951
It's not your fault.
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.

885
01:19:25,793 --> 01:19:29,559
What you do up there, it's dangerous.

886
01:19:30,498 --> 01:19:32,830
But you've got to go on.

887
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,295
You don't understand.

888
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:41,908
When I first met you, you were larger than life.

889
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:45,177
Look at you.

890
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:51,573
You're not gonna be happy unless you're going Mach 2 with your hair on fire,

891
01:19:51,612 --> 01:19:54,253
- you know that.
- No, it's over.

892
01:19:54,455 --> 01:19:57,015
- It's just over.
- To be the best of the best

893
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:01,794
means you make mistakes and then you go on.
It's just like the rest of us.

894
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:03,964
You don't think I know that?

895
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,259
I'm here to help.

896
01:20:09,537 --> 01:20:12,233
Look, thank you.

897
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:17,401
But if I wanted help, really,
I would have asked for it.

898
01:20:23,484 --> 01:20:25,247
So I'm too late.

899
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,146
You've already left.

900
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,320
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?

901
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,191
Except to quit.

902
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,928
You've got that maneuver down real well.

903
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,243
So long, Pete Mitchell.

904
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,874
Well, hi, Maverick, come on in.

905
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:22,337
- How are you doing?
- Good.

906
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:24,943
- Really? You sure you're feeling okay?
- Oh, I feel great.

907
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,944
Jamie, come on.
Can I get you a drink or anything else like that?

908
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:31,941
- No, thank you.
- Okay, well, why don't you just make yourself comfortable.

909
01:21:31,952 --> 01:21:33,217
Mike will be right down.

910
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:34,786
Great, thank you.

911
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:58,309
I flew with your old man. VF-51, the Oriskany.

912
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:03,513
You're a lot like he was.

913
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:08,245
Only better and worse.

914
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:13,318
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch, that one.

915
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:18,655
So he did do it right.

916
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,599
Yeah, he did it right.

917
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:40,180
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?

918
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,491
Yeah, your old man did it right.

919
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:49,886
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.

920
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,358
We were in the worst dogfight I ever dreamed of.

921
01:22:54,535 --> 01:22:57,800
Bogies like fireflies all over the sky.

922
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,299
His F-4 was hit, he was wounded,
but he could've made it back.

923
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,877
He stayed in it, saved three planes before he bought it.

924
01:23:08,749 --> 01:23:10,148
How come I never heard that before?

925
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:12,785
That's not something the State Department tells dependents

926
01:23:12,987 --> 01:23:17,083
when the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map.

927
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:21,221
- So you were there?
- I was there.

928
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:23,795
What's on your mind?

929
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,763
My options, sir.

930
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,002
Simple.

931
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,539
First, you've acquired enough points to show up tomorrow

932
01:23:33,741 --> 01:23:36,369
and graduate with your Top Gun class.

933
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:38,641
Or you can quit.

934
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:43,849
There'd be no disgrace. That spin was hell.
It would've shook me up.

935
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:45,746
So you think I should quit?

936
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,348
I didn't say that.

937
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:54,456
The simple fact is, you feel responsible for Goose,
and you have a confidence problem.

938
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,530
Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass, lieutenant.

939
01:23:59,767 --> 01:24:03,931
A good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what's happened.

940
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:06,135
So he can apply what he's learned.

941
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:12,176
Up there, we gotta push it. That's our job.

942
01:24:14,982 --> 01:24:18,918
It's your option, lieutenant, all yours.

943
01:24:30,631 --> 01:24:34,567
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir,
but thank you very much for your time.

944
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:38,102
No problem. Good luck.

945
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,316
- Gentlemen...
- Where's Maverick?

946
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:33,154
I don't know where he is.

947
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,023
You know what he's planning to do?

948
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:41,067
Gotta be hard on the guy, though.

949
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:13,760
Congratulations.

950
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,230
Thank you.

951
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:18,801
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.

952
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,439
Sir.

953
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,571
Gentlemen.

954
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:27,576
I hate to break up the party before it really gets out of hand,

955
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:29,079
but there is work to be done.

956
01:26:29,283 --> 01:26:31,751
Some of you have to depart immediately.

957
01:26:31,952 --> 01:26:34,420
We have a crisis situation.

958
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,681
- Ice, Slider.
- Yo.

959
01:26:36,957 --> 01:26:39,357
- Hollywood, Wolfman.
- Yes, sir.

960
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:43,630
- Maverick.
- Sir.

961
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:50,135
Maverick, you'll get your RIO when you get to the ship.

962
01:26:50,671 --> 01:26:52,070
And if you don't...

963
01:26:52,773 --> 01:26:56,106
...give me a call. I'll fly with you.

964
01:26:58,179 --> 01:26:59,703
Sir.

965
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:10,786
Gentlemen, this is bull's-eye.

966
01:27:10,991 --> 01:27:16,625
The communication ship SS Layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory.

967
01:27:16,897 --> 01:27:19,024
A rescue operation is to begin within the hour.

968
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:22,634
Your mission is to give air support to that rescue.

969
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,598
There are MiGs in the area, and tensions are high.

970
01:27:25,806 --> 01:27:29,674
If you witness a hostile act, you will return fire.

971
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:32,975
Those MiGs carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.

972
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:35,978
They can fire that missile from 100 miles away.

973
01:27:36,183 --> 01:27:40,085
Gentlemen, this is the real thing.
This is what you've been trained for.

974
01:27:40,287 --> 01:27:44,246
You are America's best. Make us proud.

975
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:45,719
- Ice.
- Yes, sir.

976
01:27:45,926 --> 01:27:46,950
- Hollywood.
- Yes, sir.

977
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:50,426
Sector two. And Maverick,
you back them up with Merlin on Ready Five.

978
01:27:52,266 --> 01:27:53,790
Yes, sir.

979
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,501
Rise!

980
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:59,239
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

981
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,534
This is not personal, but with regard to Maverick,

982
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:04,102
is he the best backup--?

983
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:07,109
I know what's on your mind,
Kazansky, just get on it.

984
01:29:23,824 --> 01:29:25,815
Mustang, can you give me a mode-four check?

985
01:29:26,026 --> 01:29:29,484
Voodoo one, you've got a pair of bogies,
12 o'clock, 15 miles.

986
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:33,689
Voodoo one, Voodoo one, 0-9-0,
radar contact 15 miles.

987
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,459
They're doing 500 knots.

988
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:36,931
Roger, that's your bogey.

989
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:43,172
Got them dead ahead, 15 miles,
air speed is 600 knots.

990
01:29:46,747 --> 01:29:50,342
Bogies' air speed, 650, We're a little close together,
Let's take a wider split,

991
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:54,417
They're at 15000 feet now,
dead ahead, ten miles,

992
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,146
Air speed is still increasing,

993
01:29:56,357 --> 01:30:00,624
Eight hundred knots. Dead ahead, now, eight miles.
Dead ahead, now, eight miles.

994
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:03,160
- Wood, you got them?
- Not yet, I can't see them.

995
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:05,229
They must be close, I'm getting a hard-on.

996
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:14,633
Okay, Wood, I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify them.

997
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:18,710
Roger, Ice, you got the lead.
I'm on your left side, a little low.

998
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:21,681
Maverick's up and ready in Alert Five.

999
01:30:21,882 --> 01:30:22,871
Good, good.

1000
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:29,046
Hollywood, my bogey's still locked up,
He's drifting to the left,

1001
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:32,491
Still maneuvering course 0-9-0,

1002
01:30:33,894 --> 01:30:36,886
Okay, Wood, let's bring it to the right,
and we'll get a better angle on them,

1003
01:30:46,273 --> 01:30:47,297
Ice, we got a problem here.

1004
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:49,339
Now I'm breaking out four aircraft on the radar.

1005
01:30:49,543 --> 01:30:51,875
Not one pair, two pair. Repeat, four bogies.

1006
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:53,341
Wood, we've got four bogies.

1007
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:58,575
- Wrong! Make that five!
- There's five, sir.

1008
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,720
- That's five?
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:31:02,823 --> 01:31:04,518
Oh, shit!

1010
01:31:04,825 --> 01:31:06,087
He's got a radar lock on us!

1011
01:31:08,495 --> 01:31:11,089
Get out of there, Hollywood!
Get out of there, goddamn it!

1012
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:21,230
- Break left!
- I'm hit! I'm hit!

1013
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:23,910
We're coming apart!
I can't control it! Hold on!

1014
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:26,909
- We're going down!
- Wood's been hit! Wood's been hit!

1015
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:28,706
Shit! Wood's been hit!

1016
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,543
Voodoo one! Wood's been hit!
Wood's been hit!

1017
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:32,776
We've lost Hollywood!
Repeat, we've lost Hollywood!

1018
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:35,615
- We've lost our wingman,
- Launch Maverick on Alert Five.

1019
01:31:35,889 --> 01:31:40,387
Get a bearing on Hollywood and Wolfman and launch the rescue helicopter immediately,

1020
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,947
- Maverick's airborne.
- Iceman, what's your position?

1021
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,249
0-9-0 at 180 miles.

1022
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:12,925
We're coming in left!

1023
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:16,027
Three MiGs, dead ahead,
coming down the left side.

1024
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,360
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

1025
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:26,003
We got four on our tail!
That makes six of them!

1026
01:32:26,206 --> 01:32:28,504
Who do you think is hooking in the guns range?

1027
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:33,707
He's firing! Break right!

1028
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:38,051
Mustang, this is Voodoo one, we are totally defensive.

1029
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,186
- Launch the alert fighters,
- Where are they?

1030
01:32:40,387 --> 01:32:42,252
A hundred and sixty miles and closing in fast, sir.

1031
01:32:42,456 --> 01:32:44,788
Ready Willard and Simkin off CATs three and four.

1032
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,819
Maverick's supersonic. I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1033
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:52,396
Move your ass! Get up here!
I'm engaged with five. Repeat, five.

1034
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:54,430
I'm in deep shit!

1035
01:32:56,236 --> 01:32:57,965
What about Willard and Simkin?

1036
01:32:58,172 --> 01:33:00,902
Both catapults are broken.
We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

1037
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:02,666
- How long?
- It'll take ten minutes.

1038
01:33:02,876 --> 01:33:06,004
Bullshit, ten minutes.
This thing will be over in two minutes. Get on it!

1039
01:33:08,615 --> 01:33:11,015
One MiG, 12 o'clock high!
One MiG, 12 o'clock high!

1040
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:12,617
Watch your back! Watch your back!

1041
01:33:18,258 --> 01:33:20,055
Break right!

1042
01:33:21,795 --> 01:33:23,194
Shit, that was close!

1043
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:24,762
Maverick, how about some help here?

1044
01:33:24,965 --> 01:33:27,024
- Where the hell are you?
- Come on, kid, hang in there.

1045
01:33:29,203 --> 01:33:30,568
Jesus Christ.

1046
01:33:32,973 --> 01:33:34,998
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddamn it!

1047
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:39,510
Maverick, we got a MiG on our tail.

1048
01:33:41,915 --> 01:33:43,940
Watch out! Watch out!

1049
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:48,621
Shit, we just flew right through his jet wash.

1050
01:33:50,724 --> 01:33:52,248
Get control, Mav! Get control!

1051
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,431
Good recovery, Mav. Okay, let's get in there.

1052
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:05,264
Come on, we gotta help Ice.

1053
01:34:05,472 --> 01:34:07,565
Come on, let's get back in the game, Maverick!

1054
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:08,969
- Come on!
- No. It's no good.

1055
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:10,700
- Get in there, Maverick!
- It's no good.

1056
01:34:13,647 --> 01:34:15,444
Goddamn it! Maverick's disengaging!

1057
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:17,012
I knew it! Shit!

1058
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:18,812
Goddamn it, Maverick!

1059
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:24,389
Get in there, Maverick!
You can't leave him! Come on! Maverick!

1060
01:34:24,591 --> 01:34:26,491
- What the hell are you doing?
- Talk to me, Goose.

1061
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:28,183
Get in there, for chrissake!

1062
01:34:28,395 --> 01:34:29,953
- Ice is in trouble!
- Talk to me, Goose.

1063
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:32,189
Get in there, Maverick!
He won't last down there alone!

1064
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:33,627
Get in the fight, for chrissakes!

1065
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:37,429
Maverick! Maverick!

1066
01:34:39,339 --> 01:34:42,001
Maverick's reengaging, sir.

1067
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:47,909
I can't get him off my tail!

1068
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:51,414
Ice, I've got your MiG dead ahead.
I've got him dead ahead.

1069
01:34:52,886 --> 01:34:54,751
Good tone. I've got good tone.

1070
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:57,947
I've got tone! I've got tone! Firing!

1071
01:35:07,901 --> 01:35:10,529
- Where? Where are they?
- A hundred and fifty-five miles.

1072
01:35:10,771 --> 01:35:12,932
Two MiGs, dead ahead.
Closing at 800 miles an hour.

1073
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:16,109
I see them. I see them.
I'm gonna take them down the left side.

1074
01:35:17,744 --> 01:35:19,541
Oh, my God.

1075
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:25,249
Ice is right below us.
He's got a MiG on his tail.

1076
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,287
He's firing! Break left! Break left!

1077
01:35:32,025 --> 01:35:34,721
He overshot! He overshot!

1078
01:35:34,928 --> 01:35:36,657
Coming in, Ice. I'm coming in.

1079
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:41,497
I got two MiGs dead ahead.

1080
01:35:42,202 --> 01:35:44,864
I got him, Mav. One MiG passing between us.

1081
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:50,603
You got a MiG on your left.
On your left! 3 o'clock!

1082
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:52,142
He's gonna fire, he's gonna fire!

1083
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:03,278
Maverick, check the guys to the north!
Check the guys to the north!

1084
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:07,825
Banking left. Banking left.

1085
01:36:09,863 --> 01:36:11,660
There he is. Get him, Ice. Get him!

1086
01:36:11,965 --> 01:36:13,159
Okay, you guys, I'm coming in!

1087
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:20,269
Maverick, we got a MiG coming around on our tail!

1088
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,034
- We gotta get out of here!
- I can't leave Ice.

1089
01:36:23,243 --> 01:36:25,768
He's still coming around!
He's gonna get behind us!

1090
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:28,038
I'm not leaving my wingman.

1091
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:32,676
I'm on his tail. I'm on his tail.
I'm going for it.

1092
01:36:32,886 --> 01:36:34,786
I'm going for it.
I'm going for the shot right now.

1093
01:36:34,988 --> 01:36:36,717
Roger. Engaged.

1094
01:36:38,892 --> 01:36:40,382
I've got radar lock.

1095
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:41,959
Good tone. I'm taking a shot.

1096
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:44,493
Fire!

1097
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,069
- Bingo!
- Wash that sucker, yeah!

1098
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:53,671
Ice, watch out.
There's a MiG to your right. He's firing!

1099
01:36:54,942 --> 01:36:56,705
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1100
01:36:58,578 --> 01:36:59,806
We're hit in the right engine!

1101
01:37:00,013 --> 01:37:02,379
I'm shutting it down.
I'm shutting it down.

1102
01:37:06,286 --> 01:37:08,550
Coming in, Ice. Coming in.

1103
01:37:11,391 --> 01:37:13,757
Ice, that bogey's still behind you.
I'm maneuvering for a shot.

1104
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:16,291
Stay with him, Mav, stay with him!

1105
01:37:16,496 --> 01:37:19,556
- Take the shot! Nail him! Nail him!
- Shit. Ice, I can't get a tone.

1106
01:37:19,766 --> 01:37:21,631
Shoot, Maverick! I can't get him off my tail!

1107
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:28,202
- Maverick, we're hit! We're hit again!
- It's okay.

1108
01:37:28,408 --> 01:37:29,966
Both engines are functioning. We're okay.

1109
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:33,010
Ice, on the count of three,
break hard right!

1110
01:37:33,413 --> 01:37:38,179
Three, two, one. Break right!

1111
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:42,145
Firing!

1112
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:46,757
Damn it, I missed!

1113
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,190
Don't let him go.
Keep on him, Mav. Keep on him.

1114
01:37:49,629 --> 01:37:51,790
I got him. I got him.

1115
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,099
Here comes a shot.

1116
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:00,632
Scratch three!

1117
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:05,504
Maverick, move! There's a MiG on your tail!
There's a MiG on your tail!

1118
01:38:05,712 --> 01:38:07,646
We've got a problem here.
We've only got one missile left.

1119
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:10,681
- Approaching 110 miles, sir.
- Goddamn it.

1120
01:38:10,884 --> 01:38:13,648
I got him! I got him! He's right on us!
He's between our tails!

1121
01:38:16,556 --> 01:38:18,023
Shit.

1122
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:22,619
You haven't lost him. He's still with us!

1123
01:38:27,267 --> 01:38:29,394
What are you doing?
You're slowing down! You're slowing down!

1124
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:32,231
- I'm bringing him in closer, Merlin.
- You're gonna do what?

1125
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:38,639
This is it, Maverick!

1126
01:38:38,845 --> 01:38:40,540
I'm gonna hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.

1127
01:38:40,747 --> 01:38:42,146
Shit! He's gonna get a lock on us!

1128
01:38:45,852 --> 01:38:47,046
Now!

1129
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:54,059
I got a good lock. Firing.

1130
01:38:58,932 --> 01:39:00,991
Scratch four!

1131
01:39:04,604 --> 01:39:08,904
Mustang, this is Voodoo three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.

1132
01:39:23,323 --> 01:39:26,417
Mustang, this is Maverick requesting flyby.

1133
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:29,027
Negative, Ghost Rider. The pattern is full.

1134
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:34,592
Excuse me. Something I should know about?

1135
01:39:46,379 --> 01:39:48,142
Thank you.

1136
01:39:53,086 --> 01:39:54,553
Goddamn that guy.

1137
01:40:50,777 --> 01:40:52,506
You!

1138
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:57,550
You are still dangerous.

1139
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:03,683
You can be my wingman anytime.

1140
01:41:04,991 --> 01:41:07,687
Bullshit. You can be mine.

1141
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:01,376
- Maverick.
- Sir.

1142
01:42:01,581 --> 01:42:05,178
How does it feel to be on the front page of every newspaper in the English-speaking world?

1143
01:42:05,652 --> 01:42:07,347
Even though the other side denies the incident,

1144
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:09,351
- congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1145
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:10,989
They gave you your choice of duty, son.

1146
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:13,352
Anything, anywhere. Do you believe that shit?

1147
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,687
Where do you think you wanna go?

1148
01:42:16,363 --> 01:42:19,696
I thought of being an instructor, sir.

1149
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:22,367
- Top Gun?
- Yes, sir.

1150
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:24,601
God help us.

1151
01:43:44,984 --> 01:43:46,508
Hello, Pete Mitchell.

1152
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:55,856
I heard the best of the best were gonna be back here,
so...

1153
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:02,895
This could be complicated.

1154
01:44:04,304 --> 01:44:08,502
You know, on the first one,
I crashed and burned.

1155
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:11,868
And the second?

1156
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:22,318
I don't know, but...

1157
01:44:23,022 --> 01:44:25,217
...it's looking good so far.
