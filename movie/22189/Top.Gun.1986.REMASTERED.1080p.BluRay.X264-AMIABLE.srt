{\rENG}Goddamn it, Mustang.This is Ghost Rider, 1-1-7

69
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,580
我被敵機制住了 他用導彈鎖定我了
{\rENG}This bogey's all over me He's got missile lock on me

70
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,780
我能得到開火的批准嗎

{\rENG}I almost orphaned him today, and I've never even seen him

135
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,890
我不知道發生了什麼事 但是我很害怕
{\rENG}I don't know what happened up there, but I was so scared

136
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,440
別這樣 我們以前也見過這種事
{\rENG}Come on, we've seen this before

137
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,060

{\rENG}No, sir

138
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,770
壓力太大了
{\rENG}I'm holding on too tight

139
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:24,410
我已經受夠了 對不起 長官
{\rENG}I've lost the edge I'm sorry, sir I'm sorry

140
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,810
美洲獅

馬華力 野鵝 進來
{\rENG}Maverick, Goose, come in here

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,130
- 發生了什麼事  - 我不知道
{\rENG}- What the hell's going on?  - I don't know

144
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,140
狗屎
{\rENG}Shit

145
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,710
馬華力 你剛才做的事很勇敢
{\rENG}Maverick, you just did an incredibly brave thing

146
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,250
可是你應該做的是降落
{\rENG}What you should have done was land your plane

147
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,010
戰機是納稅人的 不是你的
{\rENG}You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do

148
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,350
你真是狂妄自大
{\rENG}Son, your ego is writing checks your body can't cash

149
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,220
你試過被開除 失去當小組隊長的資格三次
{\rENG}You've been busted.You lost your qualifications as section leader three times

150
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,560
我兩次幫你恢復職位
{\rENG}Put in hack twice by me

151
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:20,330
你卻試過高速 飛過控制塔和上將之女
{\rENG}With a history of high-speed passes over five air-control towers and one admiral's daughter

152
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,060

{\rENG}- And you, asshole You're lucky to be here  - Thank you, sir

154
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,140
別再說廢話 馬華力 你的家人不是空軍中最好的
{\rENG}Let's not bullshit, Maverick,your family name ain't the best in the Navy

155
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,690
你應該比他做得更好 你究竟在想什麼
{\rENG}You need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy. Now, what is it with you?

156
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,020

{\rENG}Just wanna serve my country,be the best fighter pilot in Navy, sir

157
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,780
馬華力 別騙我了
{\rENG}Don't screw around with me, Maverick

158
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,260
你全憑直覺當機師 而且很出色
{\rENG}You're a hell of an instinctive pilot Maybe too good

159
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,060
我很想開除你 不過我有另一個麻煩
{\rENG}I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't.I got another problem here

160
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,300
我要從隊中派人去米拉馬
{\rENG}I gotta send somebody from this squadron to Miramar

161
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,200
我要做一些事 我難以置信的事
{\rENG}I gotta do something here.I still can't believe it

162
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,180
我要讓你夢想成真 派你去面對一流的海軍
{\rENG}I gotta give you your dream shot.I'm gonna send you up against the best

163
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,440

{\rENG}You two characters are going to Top Gun

164
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,190
你們會和世上的頂級機師 交手五星期
{\rENG}For five weeks,you're gonna fly against the best fighter pilots in the world

165
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,620
你是第二 美洲獅是第一
{\rENG}You were number two, Cougar was number one

166
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,660
美洲獅放棄開戰機
{\rENG}Cougar lost it, turned in his wings

167
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,250
你們就成了第一
{\rENG}You guys are number one

168
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,890
記著一件事 你們闖過這麼多禍
{\rENG}But you remember one thing: You screw up just this much,

169
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,160
遲早會被調往運送狗屎的
{\rENG}you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong

170
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,470
是 長官
{\rENG}Yes, sir

171
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,210
沒事了
{\rENG}That is all

172
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,710
改天把米格機的事告訴我
{\rENG}You can tell me about the MiG some other time

173
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,570
兩位
{\rENG}Gentlemen

174
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,010
- 祝你們好運  - 謝謝！
{\rENG}- Good luck, gentlemen  - Thank you, sir

175
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,710
謝謝
{\rENG}Thank you

176
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,630
{\fad(500,500)}美國空軍基地 加州米拉馬

177
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,990
海軍在韓戰的殺敵比率 是十二比一
{\rENG}During Korea, the Navy kill ratio was 12-to-1

178
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,860
我們一架戰機 就能擊落敵人十二架
{\rENG}We shot down 12 of their jets for every one of ours

179
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
到了越戰時比率降至三比一
{\rENG}During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1

180
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,730
我們的機師太依賴導彈了
{\rENG}Our pilots become dependent upon missiles

181
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,030
他們失去了一些空戰技巧
{\rENG}They had lost some of their dogfighting skills

182
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,740
成立頂級機師部 是為了教導你們空戰策略
{\rENG}Top Gun was created to teach ACM: Air Combat Maneuvering

183
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,280
也就是空中格鬥
{\rENG}Dogfighting

184
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,810
真令人興奮
{\rENG}This gives me a hard-on

185
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,880
到了越戰末期 比率回升至十二比一
{\rENG}By the end of Vietnam, that ratio was back up to 12-to-1

186
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,920
別跟我開玩笑
{\rENG}Don't tease me

187
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,280
請下窗簾
{\rENG}Blinds, please.

188
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,580
我想藉著這次機會 介紹指揮官給大家認識
{\rENG}I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at Top Gun

189
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,020
他是第一位獲得 頂級機師獎的人
{\rENG}The very first man to win the Top Gun trophy

190
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,460
你不會在其他地方找到 比他更優秀的機師了
{\rENG}You will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world

191
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,930
麥米克長官 外號毒蛇
{\rENG}Commander Mike Metcalf Callsign: Viper

192
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,800
各位
{\rENG}Gentlemen

193
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,330
你們是海軍空戰人員中 最好的百分之一
{\rENG}You are the top one percent of all naval aviators

194
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,710
是精英 精英中之精英
{\rENG}The elite The best of the best

195
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,270
我們會令你們更進一步
{\rENG}We'll make you better

196
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,140
你們每天至少 要執行兩項空中任務
{\rENG}You'll fly at least two combat missions a day,

197
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,850
當中要上課 聽取自己表現所得到的評價
{\rENG}attend classes in between and evaluations of your performance

198
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,620
你們在每次的空中任務 都要面對新挑戰
{\rENG}On each combat sequence, you're gonna meet a different challenge

199
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,960
每一次都會更加困難
{\rENG}Every encounter is gonna be much more difficult

200
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,830
我們會教你們令F14盡展所長
{\rENG}We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14 right to the edge of the envelope,

201
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,990
你們會比以前開得更快
{\rENG}faster than you've ever flown before

202
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,040
也會更加危險
{\rENG}and more dangerous

203
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,270
各位 我們不是在這兒立法
{\rENG}Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen

204
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,240
立法是由獲選的官員 和平民做的
{\rENG}Elected officials, civilians do that

205
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,780
我們只是這些政策的工具
{\rENG}We are the instruments of that policy

206
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,780
雖然我們不是在打仗 但要假裝是
{\rENG}And although we're not at war,we must always act as though we are at war

207
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,950
你在做什麼
{\rENG}What are you doing?

208
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,190
- 矛尖最好鋒利點  - 我只是在想誰是最一流的機師
{\rENG}- The tip of the spear best be sharp.  - I'm just wondering who's the best

209
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,160
你們可能會想 誰是最一流的機師
{\rENG}In case some of you wonder who the best is,

210
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,290
他們的名字就在牆上的板子上
{\rENG}they're up here on this plaque on the wall

211
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,860
最佳機師和他的通訊員的名字 都會記錄在上面
{\rENG}The best driver and his RIO from each class has his name on it

212
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,860
他們可以選擇回來當教官
{\rENG}And they have the option to come back here to be Top Gun instructors

213
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,110
你認為你的名字會在上面
{\rENG}You think your name's gonna be on that plaque?

214
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,680
是 長官
{\rENG}Yes, sir

215
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,110
你真自大 周圍有這麼多人
{\rENG}That's pretty arrogant, considering the company you're in

216
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,210
是 長官
{\rENG}Yes, sir

217
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,250
我喜歡機師自大
{\rENG}I like that in a pilot

218
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,230
記著 離開這兒後 我們都是同一隊人
{\rENG}Just remember, when it's over out there,we're all on the same team

219
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,790
各位 這兒是教大家戰鬥的
{\rENG}Gentlemen, this school is about combat

220
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,560
當第二是沒意思的
{\rENG}There are no points for second place

221
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,800
解散
{\rENG}Dismissed

222
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,370
做得好
{\rENG}Nice going

223
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,110
後補者的徽章在女洗手間
{\rENG}The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies' room

224
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,410
天啊 真是笑死我了
{\rENG}Oh, Jesus Oh, you kill me You really do

225
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,450
不 “野鵝” 是兩個O的
{\rENG}No, no, no There's two O's in "Goose", boys

226
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,370
真是一個不愁沒目標的環境
{\rENG}This is what I call a target-rich environment

227
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,940
你在兩腿之間生活
{\rENG}You live your life between your legs, Mav

228
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,910
野鵝 連你也可以來這兒
{\rENG}Goose, even you could get laid in a place like this

229
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,350
能找到說髒話的女孩 我就高興了
{\rENG}I'm telling you, I'd be happy to find a girl who'd talk dirty to me

230
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,490
馬華力 你想知道誰是一流機師
{\rENG}Mav, you wanted to know who the best is?

231
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,190
就是他 冰佬
{\rENG}That's him Iceman

232
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,530
因為他開戰機時十分冷靜 從不犯錯
{\rENG}That's the way he flies, ice-cold, no mistakes

233
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,530
磨滅你的耐性 令你沮喪 你一犯錯就會被他逮住
{\rENG}Just wears you down.You get bored, frustrated, do something stupid, and he's got you

234
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,260
滑行者
{\rENG}Hey, hey, Slider

235
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,040
我還以為你想做機師 發生了什麼事
{\rENG}Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man What happened?

236
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,980
野鵝 你真是個蠢才 你是靠誰進來的
{\rENG}Goose, you're such a dickhead.Whose butt did you kiss to get in here?

237
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,140
名單很長 不過很有名
{\rENG}Well, the list is long but distinguished

238
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,980
我的莊遜也是
{\rENG}Well, so is my johnson

239
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,640
你和冰佬一起飛行
{\rENG}So you're flying with Iceman, huh?

240
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,980
你應該說冰佬先生
{\rENG}It's Mr Iceman to you

241
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,490
野鵝媽媽 你好嗎
{\rENG}Hey, Mother Goose How's it going?

美洲獅的事真令人遺憾
{\rENG}Sorry to hear about Cougar

246
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,600
- 他和我在飛行學校時情如手足  - 他以前很好
{\rENG}- He and I were like brothers in flight school.  - He was a good man.

247
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,800
- 他現在還是  - 我就是這個意思
{\rENG}- Still is a good man  - Yeah, that's what I meant

248
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,530
- 我也以為是  - 需要幫忙嗎
{\rENG}- Thought so  - Say, you need any help?

249
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,540
幫忙什麼
{\rENG}With what?

250
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,570
你想到了嗎
{\rENG}You figured it out yet?

251
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,870
什麼
{\rENG}What's that?

252
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,580
誰是最佳機師
{\rENG}Who's the best pilot

253
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,240
還沒有 我自己會想到的
{\rENG}No, I think I can figure that one out on my own

254
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,890
聽說你喜歡單獨行事
{\rENG}I heard that about you You like to work alone

255
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,690
你一定是在幸運星之下行事
{\rENG}Mav, you must've soloed under a lucky star, huh?

256
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,350
先是米格機 然後又闖進美洲獅的戰場
{\rENG}I mean, first the MiG,and then you guys slide into Cougar's spot

257
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,120
我們不是闖進去 那也是我們的戰場
{\rENG}We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.It was ours, okay?

258
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,290
有些機師到退役時 還沒試過近距離見過米格機
{\rENG}Some pilots wait their whole career just to see a MiG up close

259
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,270
你們一定是既幸運又出名了
{\rENG}Guess you guys are lucky and famous, huh?

260
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,360
你想說的是臭名遠播吧
{\rENG}No, you mean notorious

261
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,360
回見
{\rENG}I'll see you later

262
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,100
一定會
{\rENG}You can count on it

263
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,370
他們被人寵壞了
{\rENG}They were abused children

264
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,380
- 我們會有一段好時光  - 常常如此
{\rENG}- We're gonna have a good time  - Always

265
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,420
這次應該輪到我吧
{\rENG}Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?

266
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,030
- 打賭二十元  - 好
{\rENG}- All right, the bet is $20 dollars  - Right

267
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:28,890
你得對欲海有認識 才能勾搭這時在這兒的女人
{\rENG}You have to have carnal knowledge,of a lady this time, on the premises On the premises

268
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,660
這始終是一場賭博
{\rENG}Come on, Mav A bet's a bet

269
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,500
我不知道 只是這似乎對你不太公平
{\rENG}I don't know, it just...It just doesn't seem fair For you, I mean

270
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,610
她失去了愛的感覺
{\rENG}But she's lost that loving feeling

271
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,480
- 什麼？  - 不 她還沒失去
{\rENG}- She's lost...?  - No, she hasn't

272
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,070
- 她失去了  - 她還沒失去
{\rENG}- Yes, she has.  - She has not lost that...

273
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,580
- 野鵝 她失去了…  - 你少來
{\rENG}- Goose, she's lost it Mav...  - Come on

274
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,710
該死 我討厭她這樣做
{\rENG}I hate it when she does that Shit

275
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,660
對不起 小姐

{\rENG}I love that song I've never seen that approach

288
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,590
你們兩個試過多少次
{\rENG}How long have you two been doing this act?

289
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,670
我不知道 從青春期開始
{\rENG}Oh, I don't know, since-Puberty?

290
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,330
對
{\rENG}Right, puberty

291
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,570
- 我叫布莎洛  - 我叫馬華力
{\rENG}- I'm Charlotte Blackwood  - I'm Maverick

292
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,270
馬華力 你媽媽不喜歡你嗎
{\rENG}Maverick? Did your mother not like you or something?

293
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,450
不 這是我的外號
{\rENG}No, it's my callsign

294
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,140
你是戰機師
{\rENG}You're a pilot

295
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,150
是 我是海軍空戰人員
{\rENG}That's right, a naval aviator

296
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,280
其實我們這樣做只試過兩次
{\rENG}No, actually, we've only done this twice

297
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,080
結果怎樣
{\rENG}Oh, how'd you do?

298
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,920
第一次是一場大災難 不太好看
{\rENG}Crashed and burned on the first one It wasn't pretty

299
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,120
第二次呢
{\rENG}The second?

300
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,890
我不知道 明天告訴你 暫時還不錯
{\rENG}I don't know I'll tell you tomorrow But it's looking good so far

301
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,830
馬華力
{\rENG}Well, Maverick,

302
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,910
我的朋友剛到了 和你談得真愉快
{\rENG}my friend's just arrived, so it's been great talking to you

303
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,440
- 彼利  - 嗨
{\rENG}- Perry  - Hi

304
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,570
你來了 我馬上回來
{\rENG}Hi Here you go I'll be with you in just a second, okay?

305
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,180
我可以問你一個私人問題嗎
{\rENG}Listen, can I ask you a personal question?

306
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,390
視乎你問什麼
{\rENG}That depends

307
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,120
你是好機師嗎
{\rENG}Are you a good pilot?

308
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,190
我認為我是
{\rENG}I can hold my own

309
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:16,270
好極 我不用擔心你要靠唱歌維生了
{\rENG}Great Then I won't have to worry about you making your living as a singer

310
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,640
我需要啤酒來救火
{\rENG}I'm gonna need a beer to put these flames out Yo!

311
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,570
好極 真狡猾
{\rENG}Great, Mav Real slick

312
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,860
水手 你出了海很久嗎
{\rENG}It was a long cruise, was it, sailor?

313
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,460
太久了
{\rENG}It was too long

314
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,610
你想怎樣 就地進行嗎
{\rENG}What did you wanna do,just drop right down on the tile and go for it?

315
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,080
不 其實我是想在這張桌子
{\rENG}No, I actually had...Had this counter in mind

316
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,150
好極 一定會很舒服
{\rENG}Great, that would be very, very comfortable Yeah

317
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,810
可能會
{\rENG}It could be

318
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,360
其實我來是希望你不會 為那個老鬼做錯誤決定
{\rENG}Actually,I came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy

319
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:25,830
真的 那我就能和你這種年輕人好
{\rENG}Really?So I could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like yourself?

320
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,630
可能吧
{\rENG}Maybe No?

321
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,070
明天一早我便要工作
{\rENG}I've gotta be at work very early in the morning

322
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,910
你在這兒做什麼
{\rENG}Then what are you doing here?

323
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,080
你的朋友真厲害
{\rENG}Your friend was magnificent

324
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,450
不
{\rENG}No

325
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,290
你們也會受到 平民專家的訓練和評估
{\rENG}Now, you'll also be trained and evaluated by a few civilian specialists

326
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,530
這兒有平民 是因為他們對敵機很有認識
{\rENG}The civilians are here because they are our very best source of information on enemy aircraft

327
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,030
其中最有資格的 就是教官代表 外號狐狸
{\rENG}One of the most qualified is our TAGREP,callsign: Charlie

328
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
她是天體物理學哲學博士
{\rENG}She has a PhD in astrophysics,

329
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,570
她也是一個平民承包商 你們不用向她敬禮
{\rENG}and she's also a civilian contractor,so you do not salute her

330
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,650
不過最好聽她的 因為軍方相信她對你們的評估
{\rENG}But you better listen to her,because the Pentagon listens to her about your proficiency

331
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,770
- 交給你了 狐狸  - 謝謝
{\rENG}- It's all yours, Charlie  - Thank you

332
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,440
大家好
{\rENG}Hello

333
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,350
我們會用F5和 A4模擬米格機
{\rENG}We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s as our MiG simulators

334
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,550
你們大多都應該知道
{\rENG}Now, then, as most of you know,

335
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,390
F5不像米格28 可以打破重量比率
{\rENG}the F-5 doesn't have the thrust-to-weight ratio the MiG-28 has

336
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,490
更不會像米格28 在少於三百海海裡時漏出能量
{\rENG}And it doesn't bleed energy below 300 knots, like the MiG-28

337
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:36,770
不過米格28的反飛行油箱 的確有問題
{\rENG}However, the MiG-28 does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks

338
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,710
它不能做負引力飛行動作
{\rENG}It won't do a negative-G pushover

339
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,110
最新的情報告訴我們
{\rENG}The latest intelligence tells us that the most it will do

340
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,940
它最多能夠做負一
{\rENG}is one negative...

341
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,540
對不起 上尉
{\rENG}Excuse me, lieutenant

342
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,750
有什麼問題嗎
{\rENG}Is there something wrong?

343
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,450
是 米格機的資料不正確
{\rENG}Yes, ma'am, the data on the MiG is inaccurate

344
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,650
哪兒不正確
{\rENG}How's that, lieutenant?

345
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,490
- 我看過米格28…  - 是我們
{\rENG}- Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28 do...  - We, we

346
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,830
對不起 野鵝
{\rENG}Sorry, Goose

347
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,990
我們見過米格28 做四個負引力俯衝
{\rENG}We happened to see a MiG-28 do a four-G negative dive

348
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,360
你在哪兒見到
{\rENG}Where did you see this?

349
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,300
這是機密資料
{\rENG}That's classified

350
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,000
什麼
{\rENG}It's what?

351
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,940
是機密資料
{\rENG}It's classified

352
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,870
我可以告訴你 但是之後就要殺了你
{\rENG}I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you

353
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,950
上尉 我有權知道最高機密
{\rENG}Lieutenant, I have top-secret clearance

354
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,180
軍方要我比你知道得更多
{\rENG}The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you

355
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,650
那麼這次大概不同了
{\rENG}Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so in this case, now, does it?

356
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,990
上尉 你當時在哪兒
{\rENG}So, lieutenant where exactly were you?

357
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,920
- 我們  - 謝謝
{\rENG}- Well, we.  - Thank you

358
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,000
我們從他後面開始 他穿越雲層 我飛到他上面
{\rENG}started up on his 6 when he pulled through the clouds,and then I moved in above him

359
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,370
你在他上面又怎會看到他
{\rENG}Well, if you were directly above him, how could you see him?

360
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,760
因為我倒轉了
{\rENG}Because I was inverted

361
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,340
廢話
{\rENG}Bullshit

362
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,040
不 他真是這樣做
{\rENG}No, he was, man It was a really great move

363
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,010
好精彩呢 他倒轉了
{\rENG}He was inverted

364
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,620
你和米格28一起 做四個負引力反轉俯衝
{\rENG}You were in a four-G inverted dive with a MiG-28?

365
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,190
是
{\rENG}Yes, ma'am

366
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,760
- 距離多遠  - 大概兩米吧
{\rENG}- At what range?  - About two meters

367
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,450
實際上是一米半
{\rENG}It was actually about one and a half, I think

368
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,860
我拍下了當時的精彩景象
{\rENG}It was one and a half.I've got a great Polaroid of it

369
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
他沒錯 一定是一米半
{\rENG}He's right there It must be one and a half

370
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,730
- 是張好照片  - 謝謝

對不起

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,890
是
{\rENG}Yes, ma'am

382
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,690
好吧 各位 我們要飛行了
{\rENG}All right, gentlemen, we have a hop to take

383
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,960
假設地面在一萬英尺 無論如何不能低過這高度
{\rENG}The hard deck on this hop will be 10000 feet.There'll be no engagement below that

384
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,930
出發

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,110
謝謝 在預飛區見
{\rENG}Thanks, dear See you in preflight

388
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,720
上尉 你為什麼不告訴我 是你羞辱米格機
{\rENG}Lieutenant,why didn't you tell me that you were the famous MiG insulter?

389
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,310
我說了會有分別嗎
{\rENG}Would it have made any difference?

390
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,580
在女洗手間裡不會
{\rENG}Not in the ladies' room, no

391
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,990
那我們呢
{\rENG}What would've?

392
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,160
我是這兒的教官
{\rENG}I'm an instructor at this school

393
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,660
每八個星期就會見到 二十個雄心勃勃的新丁
{\rENG}I see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks

394
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,100
你一定能想像得到
{\rENG}Now, I'm sure you can figure that out

395
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,630
上尉
{\rENG}Look, lieutenant

396
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,770
我真的很想聽聽米格機的事
{\rENG}I'd just really like to hear about the MiG sometime

397
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,210
你有權看最高機密 你可以自己看
{\rENG}You've got security clearance.You can read about it

398
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,650
馬華力
{\rENG}Maverick

399
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,710
我很好奇
{\rENG}I'm curious

400
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,520
你戲弄米格機時 是誰在掩護美洲獅
{\rENG}Who was covering Cougar while you were showboating with this MiG?

401
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,360
美洲獅表現很好
{\rENG}Cougar was doing just fine

402
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,970
先生們 這是你們的第一跳
{\rENG}Gentlemen, this is your first hop,

403
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,610
你們面對的戰機更小 更快 也更容易控制
{\rENG}The jets you are flying against are smaller, faster and more maneuverable,

404
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,260
就像米格機一樣
{\rENG}just like the enemy MiGs,

405
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,210
計時開始 我們要保持優勢
{\rENG}The clock is ticking and as of now,we are keeping score,

406
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,540
我不見了他 野鵝
{\rENG}I lost him, Goose

407
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,170
小子 讓我看看你有什麼能耐
{\rENG}Show me what you got, kid

408
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,950
不見了他
{\rENG}I lost him

409
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,640
我在找他了
{\rENG}I'm looking, I'm looking

410
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,080
看到了 他在我們後面沖過來
{\rENG}I got him, I got him.He's on our tail, coming hard

411
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,630
我看到他了 行動
{\rENG}I got him I got him Here we go

412
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,630
好吧 把資料告訴我 野鵝
{\rENG}All right, talk to me, Goose

413
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,040
他仍然在很後面 急速飛過來
{\rENG}He's still back there He's closing in on us.He's closing fast

414
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,670
小子 你可以逃 但是躲不掉
{\rENG}You can run, kid, but you can't hide

415
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,840
笑匠 看看我能不能逼你盡力
{\rENG}Come on, Jester.Let's see if I can give you a run for your money here

416
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,150
小心撞山
{\rENG}Watch the mountains

417
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,970
我仍然看到他 他仍然在後面
{\rENG}I still got him He's still back there

418
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,130
馬華力 快點想辦法
{\rENG}Come on, Mav Do some of that pilot shit

419
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,610
我看到他了
{\rENG}Yeah, I got him

420
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,250
快點鎖定
{\rENG}Come on, bring it right

421
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,530
野鵝 我受夠了
{\rENG}Goose, I've had about enough of this shit

422
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,360
我要踏制動器 他就會飛過頭
{\rENG}I'm gonna hit the brakes, he'll fly right by

423
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,990
你們死定了
{\rENG}Okay, you're mine

424
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,570
天啊
{\rENG}Jesus Christ

425
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,910
看看你現在的境況 笑匠
{\rENG}Let's see what you've got now, Jester

426
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,310
扭轉局勢吧
{\rENG}Okay, Mav, let's turn and burn

427
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,790
他垂直飛 我也是
{\rENG}He's going vertical, so am I

428
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,370
我們好像在彈射一樣
{\rENG}We're going ballistic, Mav Go get him

429
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,940
他要飛向假設地面 快比他搶先一步
{\rENG}He's going for the hard deck.Let's get down there first and nail him, Mav

430
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,280
不行 笑匠 你死定了
{\rENG}No way, Jester, you're mine

431
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,330
我瞄準你了
{\rENG}I got you now

432
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,300
笑匠輸了
{\rENG}Jester's dead

433
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,570
笑匠輸了
{\rENG}Jester's dead

434
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,750
馬上飛高回基地
{\rENG}Get your butts above the hard deck and return to base immediately

435
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,850
遵命
{\rENG}Yes, sir

436
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,120
控制塔 騎鬼者要求低飛
{\rENG}Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby

437
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,690
騎鬼者 不行 航線繁忙
{\rENG}Negative, Ghost Rider, the pattern is full

438
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,000
不 馬華力 這不是個好主意
{\rENG}No No, Mav This is not a good idea

439
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,370
對不起 野鵝 是時候飛過控制塔了
{\rENG}Sorry, Goose, but it's time to buzz the tower

440
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,150
臭小子
{\rENG}Goddamn son of a bitch

441
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,890
真是精彩絕倫
{\rENG}Great balls of fire!

442
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,060
笑匠輸了
{\rENG}Jester's dead

443
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,070
你們贏了 廢話
{\rENG}You won? That's bullshit

444
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,100
不是大家都贏了嗎
{\rENG}Didn't everybody?

445
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,330
是才怪 我們都慘敗而回
{\rENG}Hell, no, man, we got our butts kicked

446
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,270
在三十秒內我們這樣 他這樣
{\rENG}Thirty seconds We went like this, he went like that

447
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,280
我問好萊塢他在哪兒 他竟然問我誰在哪兒
{\rENG}I said to Hollywood, "Where'd he go?"Hollywood said, "Where'd who go?"

448
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,010
他就在對講機上取笑我們
{\rENG}Yeah, and he's laughing at us,right on the radio He's laughing at us

449
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,770
不 笑你們的是我 笨蛋
{\rENG}No, it's me laughing, dickhead

450
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,910
我們贏了
{\rENG}We won

451
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,040
好
{\rENG}All right

452
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,620
他們也贏了呢
{\rENG}They won too, man

453
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,620
- 我沒聽說過  - 是真的 我們打敗了笑匠
{\rENG}- That's not what I heard  - No, we did, we got Jester

454
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,690
不 低過假設地面不算
{\rENG}No, no Below the hard deck does not count

455
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,700
假設地面 總之我們打敗了他
{\rENG}Hard deck, my ass.We nailed that son of a bitch

456
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,160
你們真愛自吹自擂
{\rENG}You guys really are cowboys

457
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,060
卡湯姆 你有問題嗎
{\rENG}What's your problem, Kazansky?

458
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
你是大家的問題
{\rENG}You're everyone's problem

459
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,770
因為你每次飛行都不安全
{\rENG}That's because every time you go up in the air,you're unsafe

460
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,570
我不喜歡你 因為你很危險
{\rENG}I don't like you because you're dangerous

461
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,410
對 冰佬
{\rENG}That's right, Iceman

462
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,010
我很危險
{\rENG}I am dangerous

463
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,020
馬華力
{\rENG}Maverick, you and Goose get your butts out of that flight gear

464
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,080
你和野鵝馬上脫掉飛行衣 到毒蛇的辦公室
{\rENG}and up to Viper's office now

465
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,460
記著 當第二名是沒分的
{\rENG}Remember, boys, no points for second place

466
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,000
- 你們比看來更聰明  - 住口
{\rENG}- You're a lot brighter than you look  - You shut up, okay?

467
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,590
- 別擔心 野鵝  - 我會
{\rENG}- Don't worry, Goose, don't worry  - Okay, I will

468
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,070
有這兩個自大狂 以四百多海海裡飛過控制塔
{\rENG}Two of your snot-nosed jockeys did a flyby on my tower at over 400 knots!

469
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,340
我要你們找人負責 我受夠了
{\rENG}I want somebody's butt I want it now I've had it

470
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,640
該死 第二次了
{\rENG}Goddamn it! That's twice

471
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,710
一定要有人負責
{\rENG}I want some butts!

472
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,850
正好解釋了飛過控制塔的事
{\rENG}Well, that'll just about cover the flybys

473
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,320
跟我來
{\rENG}Follow me

474
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:23,290
兩位 你們第一天過得真充實
{\rENG}Gentlemen You had a hell of a first day

475
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,900
這次任務的假設地面是一萬英尺
{\rENG}The hard deck for this hop was 10000 feet

476
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,970
你們明知故犯
{\rENG}You knew it, you broke it

477
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:37,010
希軍官不見了你們之後 你們跟著他低飛
{\rENG}You followed Commander Heatherly below after he lost sight of you and called no joy

478
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,980
為什麼
{\rENG}Why?

479
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,650
長官 我看到希軍官
{\rENG}Sir I had Commander Heatherly in my sights.He saw me move in for the kill

480
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,850
他看到我飛到開火的位置 就飛低過假設地面
{\rENG}He then proceeded below the hard deck

481
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,420
我們只有幾秒低飛了
{\rENG}We weren't below 10000 for more than a few seconds

482
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,060
我瞄準了他 見沒有危險就開火
{\rENG}I had the shot, there was no danger, so I took it

483
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,170
你開了火 你破壞了重要守則
{\rENG}You took it And broke a major rule of engagement

484
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,070
飛越控制塔時又犯了另一條
{\rENG}Then you broke another one with that circus-stunt flyby

485
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,480
麥上尉
{\rENG}Lieutenant Mitchell, Top Gun rules of engagement exist

486
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,640
守則是為了你 和隊員的安全而設立的
{\rENG}for your safety and for that of your team

487
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,350
守則不可隨時更改 我也是
{\rENG}They are not flexible, nor am I

488
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,120
不遵守的話就要被開除 清楚了嗎
{\rENG}Either obey them or you're history.Is that clear?

489
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,650
是 長官
{\rENG}Yes, sir

490
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,830
解散
{\rENG}Dismissed

491
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,580
我真的很享受那一下 謝謝你
{\rENG}I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot

492
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,380
天啊
{\rENG}Holy shit

493
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,780
我或者可以學習當貨車司機
{\rENG}Maybe I could learn how to be a truck driver

494
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,850
你有貨車駕駛學校的電話號碼
{\rENG}Mav, you have the number of that truck-driving school we saw on TV?Truck Master, I think it is

495
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,590
我可能會需要到
{\rENG}I might need that

496
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,290
評估報告已經顯示了他很飄忽
{\rENG}His fitness report says it all.He's a wild card

497
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,590
他靠直覺開戰機 完全無法預測
{\rENG}Flies by the seat of his pants.Completely unpredictable

498
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,670
- 他嚇倒你了  - 是
{\rENG}- He got you, didn't he?  - Yeah

499
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:16,010
馬華力 我曾經和他爸爸共事
{\rENG}Maverick I flew with his old man

500
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,250
告訴我 你想和他一起上戰場嗎
{\rENG}Tell me one thing.If you had to go into battle, would you want him with you?

501
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,120
我不知道
{\rENG}I don't know

502
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,290
我真的不知道
{\rENG}I just don't know

503
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,260
還沒睡嗎
{\rENG}You still awake?

504
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,040
是
{\rENG}Yeah

505
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,340
你在想什麼
{\rENG}What's up?

506
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,410
睡不著
{\rENG}Can't sleep

507
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:57,050
我知道可以進頂級機師部時 我只想拿機師獎
{\rENG}You know, when I first realized that we were going to Top Gun, all I could think about was getting that trophy

508
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,110
我要坦白跟你說
{\rENG}I gotta be straight with you, Mav

509
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,860
我現在只希望我們能畢業
{\rENG}Right now, I just hope we graduate

510
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,160
我有家人 我不能浪費這個機會
{\rENG}I got a family to think about.I can't afford to blow this

511
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,530
其實飛越控制塔不算什麼
{\rENG}Yeah, I guess that flyby wasn't such a big hit

512
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,000
我知道你很難受
{\rENG}Look, man, I know it's tough for you

513
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,740
他們因為你是麥杜克的兒子 而不讓你進海軍學院
{\rENG}They wouldn't let you in the academy because you're Duke Mitchell's kid

514
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,320
你要承受這個汙名
{\rENG}You have to live with that reputation

515
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,720
我們每次飛行時 你都像在面對鬼魂一樣
{\rENG}But it's like every time we go up there,it's like you're flying against a ghost

516
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,450
你令我緊張
{\rENG}It makes me nervous

517
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,500
我只有你這個親人
{\rENG}You're the only family I've got

518
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,800
我不會令你失望的 我保證
{\rENG}I'm not gonna let you down I promise you

519
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,710
出去吧
{\rENG}Get out of here

520
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,200
在這情形下 倒轉打轉會很有效
{\rENG}A rolling reversal would work well in that situation

521
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,060
如果我十字形倒轉飛 就能馬上轉為發炮
{\rENG}If I reversed on a hard cross,I could immediately go to guns on them

522
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,040
在這種速度下 太快了
{\rENG}Yeah, but at that speed, it's too fast

523
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,940
而且太過急進
{\rENG}It's a little bit too aggressive

524
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,540
太過急進
{\rENG}Too aggressive

525
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,520
我覺得應該這樣做就這樣做
{\rENG}Yeah, I guess when I see something,I go right after it

526
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,490
你沒告訴我你那晚去了哪兒
{\rENG}You didn't tell me who you were the other night

527
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,150
你沒有給我機會說
{\rENG}You didn't give me a chance, did you?

528
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,290
你應有此報
{\rENG}You deserved it

529
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:56,030
我知道 不過有人想你約我吃晚餐
{\rENG}I know But you were tempted to ask me out for dinner

530
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,300
- 不  - 不？
{\rENG}- No  - No?

531
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:01,500
- 不  - 我不和學員約會
{\rENG}- No.  - I don't date students

532
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,550
我看得出這對你很危險
{\rENG}I can see it's dangerous for you

533
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,750
但是如果政府相信我 你也可以
{\rENG}But if the government trusts me, maybe you could

534
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,500
這不只是花式飛行這麼簡單
{\rENG}It takes a lot more than just fancy flying

535
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,940
今晚五點半共進晚餐

536
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,050
一敗塗地 馬華力
{\rENG}Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

537
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,450
滑行者
{\rENG}Slider

538
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,020
你很臭
{\rENG}you stink

539
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,760
開始
{\rENG}Let's go

540
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,430
冰佬 快打
{\rENG}Okay, Ice, hit it

541
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,150
很好 繼續
{\rENG}That's good Come on

542
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,490
發球 開始
{\rENG}Let's go, now

543
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:40,100
來吧 四比七 讓我們抓住他們 那些傢伙是牲畜
{\rENG}Come on, Mav, 4-7 Let's get them.Those guys are animals

544
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,650
發球
{\rENG}Let's go

545
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,310
發好球 發好球
{\rENG}Good serve, good serve

546
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,340
這就是比賽
{\rENG}That's game

547
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,510
好吧 假動作 趴下 把他們帶走
{\rENG}Okay Fake block, stay down.We'll just take them

548
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,680
來吧 你們去哪裡？你要走？
{\rENG}Come on, where you guys going? You walking away?

549
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,580
我們贏了 我們贏了
{\rENG}We won, we won

550
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,020
馬華力 再打一局 就追成平手了
{\rENG}Mav Mav Come on, man.Just one more game That evens it up

551
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,730
- 我們很大機會會贏的  - 不
{\rENG}- Come on, we can take them  - No

552
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,230
- 我們有實力  - 我要去辦一件事
{\rENG}- No, we can, we got it  - I got some things I gotta take care of

553
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,420
辦事 只是再打一局而已
{\rENG}Take care of? Just one more game

554
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,700
- 為了我好嗎？  - 對不起
{\rENG}- Please? For me?  - I'm sorry.

555
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,230
- 你應該內疚 來吧  - 鵝媽媽，你這娘們！  - 為了我
{\rENG}- You're sorry Come on.  - Mother Goose, you pussy!  - For me?

556
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,800
該死
{\rENG}Damn it

557
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,280
上尉
{\rENG}Lieutenant?

558
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,180
不唱歌了嗎
{\rENG}What, no singing?

559
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,900
- 我  - 不用道歉
{\rENG}- Look, I'm...I'm...  - No apologies

560
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,470
你不介意的話 我想去快快洗一個澡
{\rENG}If you don't mind, I'm...I'm gonna just take a quick shower

561
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,270
讓你好好吃完
{\rENG}while you're finishing up here

562
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,210
可是我介意 我很餓
{\rENG}Yeah, I do mind I'm hungry

563
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,250
後來我想起來了
{\rENG}And then I thought about it

564
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,560
我想
{\rENG}I thought:

565
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,690
狐狸 他是個聰明人
{\rENG}You know, Charlie, he's a smart guy

566
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,400
為什麼不乾脆告訴他 請他來的目的
{\rENG}Why don't you just tell him why you've got him here"

567
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,040
是什麼
{\rENG}Well?

568
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,070
米格機
{\rENG}It's the MiG

569
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,070
是米格機 只有你曾經面對過米格28
{\rENG}The MiG You're the only pilot who's been up against a MiG-28

570
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,780
我正在努力工作 希望能夠升職
{\rENG}I'm trying for this big promotion at work, and if I get it,

571
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,750
成功的話 我不會再留在這兒
{\rENG}I'm not gonna be here much longer

572
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,250
你似乎什麼都想清楚了
{\rENG}It seems to me you've got it all figured out

573
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,520
是
{\rENG}Yeah

574
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,260
只是你忘記了酒
{\rENG}Except you did forget the wine

575
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,560
對不起
{\rENG}Sorry

576
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,360
你常常如願以償
{\rENG}You always get what you want?

577
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:01,270
不 可能是吧
{\rENG}No, not always Yeah, maybe

578
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,070
那就別這麼在意那架米格機
{\rENG}Then relax about the MiG

579
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,960
這首音樂
{\rENG}This music

580
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,730
是老朋友的
{\rENG}An old friend?

581
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,560
我父母很喜歡這首音樂
{\rENG}My folks loved it

582
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,230
我有很多年沒聽過了
{\rENG}I haven't heard this in years

583
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,910
媽媽以前在房裡 叫我把它不停重播
{\rENG}My mother used to call down from her room and have me play this over and over again

584
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,280
我很厭倦聽這首音樂
{\rENG}I got so sick of it

585
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,880
她卻沒有
{\rENG}But not her, she

586
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,920
她會獨坐在一旁 一聽就聽上幾個小時
{\rENG}Just sit up there alone, just listening, hours

587
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,380
她會跟著唱
{\rENG}Just listening

588
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,030
他死後不久她也死了
{\rENG}She died shortly after him

589
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,200
你爸爸怎樣死的
{\rENG}What happened to your father?

590
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,300
你既然有權知道機密資料
{\rENG}I guess I kind of figured, with your security clearance,

591
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,880
應該比我知道得更多
{\rENG}you'd know more about him than I do

592
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,940
我還沒知道得這麼深入
{\rENG}Well, I didn't get that far

593
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,080
這是一個謎
{\rENG}Well, it's a big mystery

594
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,530
他在一九六五年十一月五日 開著F4失蹤
{\rENG}He disappeared in an F-4, November 5th, 1965

595
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:34,400
聽說是他犯錯了 不可能
{\rENG}The stink of it was, he screwed up No way

596
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,170
我爸爸是很優秀的機師
{\rENG}My old man was a great fighter pilot

597
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,570
但誰知道呢 一切都被列作機密資料
{\rENG}But who the hell knows?It's all classified

598
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,580
一定有人知道的
{\rENG}Somebody must know

599
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,210
有人什麼都知道
{\rENG}Yeah, somebody knows everything

600
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,450
所以你總是只能拿到第二名
{\rENG}Is that why you're always second best up there?

601
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,560
你真直接呢
{\rENG}You are direct, aren't you?

602
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,500
對不起 我遲到
{\rENG}I'm sorry I was late

603
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,670
對不起 我這麼直接
{\rENG}I'm sorry for being direct

604
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,840
不用道歉
{\rENG}No apologies

605
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,880
這會變得很複雜
{\rENG}This is gonna be complicated

606
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,090
你去哪兒
{\rENG}Where are you going?

607
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,360
我去洗澡
{\rENG}I'm gonna take a shower

608
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,370
謝謝 我玩得很高興
{\rENG}Thank you I enjoyed being here

609
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,440
你似乎需要再洗一個澡呢
{\rENG}It looks like you need another shower

610
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,940
對
{\rENG}Right

611
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,150
我想對你坦白
{\rENG}I'm gonna be honest with you

612
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,390
你看到米格機 會對我的工作大有幫助
{\rENG}Your MiG sighting is really important to my work, but

613
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:53,110
但我不是常常請學員 到家中作客的
{\rENG}I don't normally invite students to my house

614
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,510
你是
{\rENG}You're

615
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,980
希望你明白我有工作在身
{\rENG}But please understand, I still have a job to do

616
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,820
- 長官  - 你好
{\rENG}- Morning  - Sir

617
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,910
我很高興我們這麼坦白
{\rENG}I'm glad we got that straight

618
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,900
我告訴她這兒有多辛苦
{\rENG}I told her how tough it is here

619
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,870
我累得跟死狗一樣
{\rENG}You know, my ass dragging like an old, tired dog

620
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,970
我告訴她你在這兒 連一個女人也沒有
{\rENG}I told her that you didn't even have a woman here

621
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,070
- 夠了  - 知道她怎樣說嗎？
{\rENG}- Oh, really  - You know what she said?

622
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,150
他可能有八個呢
{\rENG}Said, "Well, he probably doesn't have one, he's got eight"

623
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,620
爸爸
{\rENG}Daddy

624
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,530
馬華力
{\rENG}So, Maverick,

625
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,660
野鵝說你和教官墜入愛河了
{\rENG}Goose tells me you're in love with one of your instructors

626
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,700
- 是嗎  - 我沒說過這件事
{\rENG}- Is that right?  - I...I didn't tell her that

627
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,740
你有說過的
{\rENG}Yes, you did

628
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,910
- 是的，是你  - 你竟然說出來 那是秘密
{\rENG}- Yes, you did  - I can't believe you said that, That was a secret. No

629
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,490
敵機在很好的位置 請定格
{\rENG}The bogey has good position right here.All right, freeze-frame

630
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,920
是抉擇的時刻了
{\rENG}Moment of choice

631
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,090
F14是防守性的 它有機會逃回基地
{\rENG}The F-14 is defensive He has a chance to bug out right here

632
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:55,230
最好先撤退和保存戰機安全
{\rENG}Better to retire and save your aircraft

633
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,460
接著進入了更差的位置
{\rENG}than push a bad position

634
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,690
狐狸 你可以隨時插嘴
{\rENG}Charlie, jump in here anytime

635
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,200
你在菱形內再多留三秒
{\rENG}Now, you stay in that diamond another three seconds,

636
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,430
就會被敵機消滅
{\rENG}the bogey's gonna blow you out of the sky

637
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,570
如果你選擇第五區向右突圍
{\rENG}You take a hard right, select zone five,

638
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,980
就能拖延時間逃走
{\rENG}you can extend an escape

639
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,610
你作了一個很差的決定
{\rENG}You made a bad choice

640
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,240
狐狸
{\rENG}Charlie

641
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,320
戰機一號翻了一個分裂S筋斗
{\rENG}Aircraft one performs a split S?

642
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:25,450
這是你最不該做的 米格機就在你後面
{\rENG}That's the last thing you should do.The MiG's right on your tail

643
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,960
請定格
{\rENG}Freeze there, please

644
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,730
你在米格機的射程範圍 你現在會想什麼
{\rENG}The MiG has you in his gunsight What were you thinking at this point?

645
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,140
你沒時間在空中思想了
{\rENG}You don't have time to think up there

646
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,210
一想就死定了
{\rENG}If you think, you're dead

647
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,740
用價值三千萬元的戰機打賭 賭得可真大呢
{\rENG}Well, that's a big gamble with a $30 million plane, lieutenant

648
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,080
不幸地 他賭贏了
{\rENG}Unfortunately, the gamble worked

649
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,310
米格機無法開火
{\rENG}The MiG never got a clean shot

650
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,020
馬華力做了 富侵略性的垂直飛行
{\rENG}Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here,

651
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:00,220
到了頂部 他用導彈打敗了敵機
{\rENG}comes over the top,and he defeats the bandit with a missile shot

652
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,060
這次的交手是一次勝利
{\rENG}The encounter was a victory,

653
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,460
不過這是不該做的例子
{\rENG}but I think that we've shown it as an example of what not to do

654
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,190
下一個
{\rENG}Next

655
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,630
從沒見過這麼大膽的行動
{\rENG}Gutsiest move I ever saw, man

656
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:20,510
接著的可以作為 教科書的最佳例子
{\rENG}Now, then, this is a perfect example of a textbook maneuver

657
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,290
上尉
{\rENG}Lieutenant

658
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,960
馬華力
{\rENG}Maverick

659
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,840
上尉
{\rENG}Lieutenant Lieutenant

660
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,150
我對你的飛行評估 是我的專業意見
{\rENG}My review of your flight performance in the TACTS was right on, in my professional opinion

661
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,280
我聽不到你說什麼
{\rENG}I can't hear you

662
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,530
天啊 你以為我只會魯莽行事
{\rENG}Jesus Christ! And you think I'm reckless

663
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,130
我飛行時就會讓你知道 我以隊員和戰機為先
{\rENG}When I fly,I'll have you know that my crew and my plane come first!

664
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,650
上尉 讓我把話說完
{\rENG}Well, I'm going to finish my sentence, lieutenant

665
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,340
我對你的飛行評估是正確的
{\rENG}My review of your flight performance was right on

666
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,150
- 是嗎？  - 是的
{\rENG}- Is that right?  - That is right

667
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,010
但是我保留了一些
{\rENG}But I held something back

668
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:34,850
我看得出你有飛行的天才 但是我不能在那兒說出來
{\rENG}I see some real genius in your flying,Maverick, but I can't say that in there

669
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,590
我害怕大家會看穿我
{\rENG}I was afraid that everyone in that TACTS trailer would see right through me

670
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,250
我只是不想讓人知道 我愛上你了
{\rENG}And I just don't want anyone to know that I've fallen for you

671
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,560
- 馬華力  - 聽到冰佬的事嗎？
{\rENG}- Hey, Maverick  - Yeah You hear about Ice?

672
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,600
- 什麼事  - 他又贏了
{\rENG}- What's that?  - He won another one

673
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,230
- 真的？  - 是的
{\rENG}- Really?  - Yeah

674
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:43,070
我感覺到我需要速度
{\rENG}I feel the need, the need for speed! The need for speed!

675
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,410
各位 這是第十九次飛行
{\rENG}Gentlemen, this is hop 19,

676
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,620
會有更多戰機和敵機
{\rENG}Multiple aircraft, multiple bogies,

677
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,250
訓練已經過了一半 最佳機師獎的爭持仍然激烈
{\rENG}Your training is half over,The competition for the Top Gun trophy remains tight,

678
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,800
第一名是冰佬
{\rENG}First place, Iceman,

679
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,830
第二名是馬華力 只差兩分
{\rENG}Second place, Maverick, just two points behind,

680
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,100
他們來了
{\rENG}There they are

681
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,670
在三哩外 西北方 大概還沒見到我們
{\rENG}Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.I don't think they see us yet

682
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:05,900
我看到他們
{\rENG}Okay, I see them

683
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,440
左邊有兩架A4 在西北方 繼續左轉
{\rENG}Two A-4s, left 10 o'clock level, continue left turn

684
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,950

{\rENG}Good morning, gentlemen.The temperature's 110 degrees

685
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,610
天啊 是毒蛇
{\rENG}Holy shit, it's Viper

686
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,060
毒蛇在空中 好極
{\rENG}Viper's up here, great

687
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,460
該死
{\rENG}Oh, shit

688
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,960
他可能也在說該死 是馬華力和野鵝
{\rENG}Great He's probably saying,"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose"

689
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,830
他一定在這樣說
{\rENG}Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that

690
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:36,900
我看到北方的敵機
{\rENG}I've got my eye on the northern bogey

691
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,970
收到 我看到南方的

693
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,660
笑匠 快轉彎
{\rENG}Break now, Jester

694
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,730
好萊塢 我們失去了毒蛇 對付笑匠吧
{\rENG}Hollywood, we're losing Viper.Let's just stay on Jester

695
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,130

{\rENG}Roger, I'm on him

696
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,070

{\rENG}Goose, find Viper He's out there somewhere

697

馬華力 別離開他
{\rENG}Mav, don't leave him

705
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,690
野鵝 好萊塢沒事的 我想打敗毒蛇
{\rENG}Goose, Hollywood's okay I want Viper

706
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,360
毒蛇會被打敗
{\rENG}Stand by Viper's coming down

707
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,150
該死 我們面對面了 我們竟然這樣做
{\rENG}Holy shit, we're head-to-head.I can't believe we're doing this

708
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,590
搖滾一下吧
{\rENG}Rocking roll

天啊 他真厲害
{\rENG}Jesus, this guy's good

716
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,390
野鵝 他去了哪兒

{\rENG}Damn, this kid's good

720
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,610

{\rENG}He's too close for missiles,Goose, I'm switching to guns

721
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,280
快快快！

{\rENG}What...? Hold it Goose, check our tail

724
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,530
是笑匠
{\rENG}Shit There's Jester

725
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,130
成功了 馬華力輸了 小子 你玩完了

該死
{\rENG}Shit

727
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,040
防衛部很遺憾要告訴你
{\rENG}The Defense Department regrets to inform you

728
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,940
你的兒子因為太笨而戰死沙場
{\rENG}that your sons are dead because they were stupid

729
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,910
真刺激
{\rENG}Great balls of fire

730
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,280
算了吧 大家回去 由毒蛇帶頭
{\rENG}Okay, knock it off, gentlemen.Let's go home Viper has the lead

731
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,650
還有三十秒 我和人狼就進來
{\rENG}Thirty seconds, Wolfman, and I'm coming in

732
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,350
- 閉嘴！  - 上帝啊，笨蛋
{\rENG}- Shut up!  - God, buttnose

733
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:49,120
我從沒見過這麼精彩的空戰
{\rENG}That was some of the best flying I've seen yet,

734
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:51,320
直至你們被打敗為止
{\rENG}right up the part where you got killed

735
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,160
你永不該離開同伴
{\rENG}You never, never leave your wingman

736
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,330
馬華力
{\rENG}Maverick

737
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,280
問題不在你的飛行技術 而是你的態度
{\rENG}it's not your flying, it's your attitude

738
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,650
敵人很危險
{\rENG}The enemy's dangerous,

739
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,550
但是你比敵人更加危險
{\rENG}but right now you're worse than the enemy

740
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,250
你既危險又愚蠢
{\rENG}You're dangerous and foolish

741
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,320
你未必喜歡你的戰友
{\rENG}You may not like the guys flying with you,

{\rENG}they may not like you, but whose side are you on?

743
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,500
起碼毒蛇在打敗我們之前 打敗了冰佬
{\rENG}Well, at least Viper got Iceman before he got us

744
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,310
我們仍然有機會得獎
{\rENG}We still got a shot at it

745
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,110
那是愚蠢的行為 我也知道
{\rENG}That was stupid I know better than that

{\rENG}Maverick, would you go fetch him?Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

750
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,310
野鵝 當然沒試過

{\rENG}He told me all about the time you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin

754
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,060
是嗎 好極
{\rENG}Did he? Well, that's great

755
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,160
他把一切都告訴我了
{\rENG}He tells me about all of them, Maverick

756
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,900
我的小天使野鵝 早早回家準備去教堂
{\rENG}How my little angel Goose goes home early for church,

01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,710
好吧 謝謝你 嘉露
{\rENG}All right, thank you, Carole

759
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,940
我去和野鵝一起難為情一下
{\rENG}I'm gonna go embarrass myself with Goose for a while

760
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,670
我想警告你 馬華力很危險
{\rENG}I would love to be able to warn you off about Maverick,

761
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,100
可是我很喜歡他

{\rENG}and I'm telling you, one thing's for certain

764
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:52,270
今晚世界上會有很多人心碎
{\rENG}There are hearts breaking wide open all over the world tonight

765
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:53,440
為什麼
{\rENG}Why?

766
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,910
因為 除非你是個笨蛋
{\rENG}Because unless you are a fool,

767
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:58,250
他已經不再在情場上鬼混了
{\rENG}that boy is off the market

{\rENG}Top Gun trophy is still up for grabs, so every point counts,

779
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:03,870

{\rENG}Well, it's bottom of the ninth, the score is tied.It's time for the big one

780
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,540
馬華力 你這次能贏嗎
{\rENG}You up for this one, Maverick?

781
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,010
這跟在公園散步一樣容易
{\rENG}Just a walk in the park, Kazansky

{\rENG}Two miles Looks like they're going away from us

784
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,020

787
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,890

{\rENG}Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there

790
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,460
角度還沒確定 太近了 不能用導彈
{\rENG}I can't get the angle.I'm too close for missiles

791
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,230
現在改為用槍炮
{\rENG}I'm switching to guns

792
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,640
冰佬 你不開火就走開
{\rENG}Ice, fire or clear

793
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:13,410
天啊 我在這兒也能開火
{\rENG}Look at this! Jesus Christ,I can take a shot right here!

794

再多十秒就行了
{\rENG}Ten more seconds, then I've got him

800
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,900
冰佬 快走開
{\rENG}Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there!

801
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,060
馬華力 出手吧
{\rENG}Let's do it, Mav

802
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,800
冰佬 從右邊走開 我要上來
{\rENG}Ice, come off high right I'm in

803
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:38,870
再多五秒
{\rENG}Five more seconds

804
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,870
去右邊 冰佬 我來了
{\rENG}Come off high right, Ice I'm in

805
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:42,710
我走開 該死
{\rENG}I'm off Shit!

806
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,570
我們在噴氣流之中
{\rENG}We're in his jet wash!

807
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,170
該死
{\rENG}Holy shit!

808
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,410
該死 引擎停了 馬華力
{\rENG}This is not good Shit, we got a flameout, Mav

809
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,920
引擎一號停了
{\rENG}Engine one is out

810
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,550
引擎二號也停了
{\rENG}Engine two is out!

811
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,130
野鵝 我無法控制戰機
{\rENG}Goose, I'm losing control I'm losing control

812
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,660
失去了控制 無法回復正常
{\rENG}I can't control it It won't recover

813
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,090
該死
{\rENG}Shit

814
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,400
禍不單行
{\rENG}It's coupling up, Mav! We're out of control

815
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,100
情況不妙
{\rENG}This is not good! This is not good!

816
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,600
請求救援 馬華力出事了 機身在不停打轉
{\rENG}Mayday, mayday Mav's in trouble.He's in a flat spin

817
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,470
快掉進海裡了
{\rENG}He's heading out to sea

818
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,140
高度八千 現在是六千
{\rENG}Altitude 8000, 7000

819
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,980
六點 我們六點了 小牛
{\rENG}Six We're at six, Mav.

820
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:25,950
我被拋到前面 野鵝
{\rENG}I'm pinned forward, Goose.

821
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,080
我摸不到跳機杆
{\rENG}I can't reach the ejection handle

822
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:31,830
野鵝 你要幫我們彈出去
{\rENG}Goose, you're gonna have to punch us out

823
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:33,890
我摸不到跳機杆
{\rENG}I can't reach the ejection handle Eject

824
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,900

{\rENG}- Eject!  - Watch the canopy!

826
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,820
野鵝 不
{\rENG}Goose! Goose! Oh, no!

827
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,550
天啊
{\rENG}Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God

828
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,870
請你放手 你一定要放手
{\rENG}Sir, let go of him You gotta let him go, sir

829
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,650
你怎樣
{\rENG}How you doing?

830
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,750
我沒事
{\rENG}I'm all right

831
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,560
野鵝死了
{\rENG}Goose is dead

832
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:49,130
我知道
{\rENG}I know

833
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,800
開戰機開得久了 總會遇到這種事
{\rENG}You fly jets long enough,something like this happens

834
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:01,700
他是我的通訊員 這是我的責任
{\rENG}He was my RIO, my responsibility

835
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:07,310
我在越戰的部隊 十八架戰機有八架墜毀
{\rENG}In my squadron in Vietnam,we lost eight of 18

836
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,470
總共十條人命
{\rENG}aircraft Ten men

837
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,580
第一個人死了 你也會死
{\rENG}First one dies, you die too

838
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,620
你可以肯定還會有其他人
{\rENG}But there will be others You can count on it

839
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,830
放過自己
{\rENG}You gotta let him go

840
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,930
放過他
{\rENG}You gotta let him go

841
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,820
這可能是我的錯
{\rENG}I think maybe it was my fault

842
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:55,590
我不知道是哪兒出錯
{\rENG}I don't know what the hell went wrong

843
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,900
我想幫你 我知道你很難接受
{\rENG}I'd like to help I know it's difficult

844
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,500
天啊 我想他復活
{\rENG}God, I want him back

845
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,880
你需要我的話隨時找我
{\rENG}I'll be here if you need me, okay?

846
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:15,560
天啊 他很喜歡和你並肩作戰
{\rENG}God, he loved flying with you, Maverick

847
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:38,150
就算沒遇上你 他也會當機師
{\rENG}But he'd have flown anyway without you

848
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:42,430
雖然他會討厭這種事 但他還是會做
{\rENG}He'd have hated it, but he would've done it

849
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:10,960
我們發現這架F14的引擎 捲進了氣流
{\rENG}We find that the F-14 flat spin was induced by the disruption of airflow into the starboard engine

850
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:17,800
這種干擾令引擎 出現過多的偏航率
{\rENG}This disruption stalled the engine,which produced enough yaw rate

851
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:22,870
結果令機身不停打轉 無法修正
{\rENG}to induce a spin which was unrecoverable

852
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:28,700
這種問題 不是麥上尉可察覺到的
{\rENG}There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell could either see or avoid the jet wash which produced the engine stall

853
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:30,810
所以資詢會發現
{\rENG}Therefore, the board of inquiry finds that Lieutenant Pete Mitchell

854
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:34,440
麥彼得上尉 並沒在七月二十九日的意外犯錯
{\rENG}was not at fault in the accident of 29 July

855
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:37,250
這次的意外 不會記在麥上尉的紀錄上
{\rENG}Lieutenant Mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident

856
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:40,980
麥上尉馬上複職
{\rENG}Lieutenant Mitchell is restored to flight status without further delay

857
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,260
調查完畢
{\rENG}These proceedings are closed

858
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,730
儘快讓他回復飛行
{\rENG}Get him up flying, soon

859
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:24,220
小子 快點進戰場
{\rENG}Come on, kid, come on Get in there Engage

860
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:26,530
馬華力 東北方有一架敵機
{\rENG}All right, you got a bogey at 2 o'clock low, Maverick

861
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:28,660
你的位置很好 簡直是輕而易舉
{\rENG}You got the angle Piece of cake, pal

862
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,630
快開火 小子
{\rENG}Take the shot, kid Take the shot

863
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:38,140
馬華力 你隨時都可以加入
{\rENG}You can engage any time, Maverick

864
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,620
你要去哪兒
{\rENG}Hey, where the hell are you going?

865
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:53,190
情況不妙
{\rENG}It's not good It doesn't look good

866
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,660
情況不妙是什麼意思 情況好到不得了
{\rENG}What do you mean, it doesn't look good?It doesn't get to look any better than that

867
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:13,700

{\rENG}Hey, man, we could've had him.Hey, we could've had him, man!

868
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,440

{\rENG}I will fire when I am goddamn good and ready!

869
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,520
你明白了嗎
{\rENG}You got that?!

870
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,810
他仍然未回復過來 他不願戰鬥
{\rENG}He can't get back in the saddle Won't engage

871
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,710
只過了幾天
{\rENG}It's only been a few days

872
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,680
他可能不能回復過來
{\rENG}You know, he just might not make it back

873
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,780
繼續把他送上去
{\rENG}Keep sending him up.

874
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,860
麥彼得

875
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:16,100
我很難過野鵝死了

876
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:21,940
大家都喜歡他

877
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,620

01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,300
隨便
{\rENG}Please

883
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:37,620
和他要的一樣
{\rENG}I'll have what he's having

884
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,620
是毒藥吧

885
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:41,630
是冰水
{\rENG}Ice water

886
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,470
你不和我道別嗎
{\rENG}You weren't gonna say goodbye?

887
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:54,310
聽說你得到華盛頓的工作了
{\rENG}I heard you got that job in Washington

888
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:55,900

謝謝
{\rENG}Thanks

890
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,880
但是我不會不辭而別
{\rENG}But I wasn't gonna leave without saying goodbye

891
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,620
看到你真好
{\rENG}It's good to see you

892
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,710
謝謝
{\rENG}Thanks

893
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,490
你要去哪兒
{\rENG}Where you going?

894
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,990
你連機票也沒有吧
{\rENG}You don't even have a ticket, do you?

895
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:23,230
我看過所有證據 這不是你的責任
{\rENG}Listen, I've seen all the evidence,and it's not your responsibility

896
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:30,410
不是你的錯 你是海軍裡的精英
{\rENG}It's not your fault You're one of the best pilots in the Navy

897
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:35,110
你在高空戰鬥是很危險
{\rENG}What you do up there, it's dangerous

898
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,480
但是你得繼續下去
{\rENG}But you've got to go on

899
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,010
你不明白
{\rENG}You don't understand

900
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:47,190
我剛認識你時 你的生活很充實
{\rENG}When I first met you, you were larger than life

901
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,390
看看你
{\rENG}Look at you

902
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:56,770
你不過步伐急速的生活 你不會快樂
{\rENG}You're not gonna be happy unless you're going Mach 2 with your hair on fire,

903
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:57,730
- 你知道的  - 不 完了
{\rENG}- you know that  - No, it's over

904
01:19:57,870 --> 01:20:02,500
- 剛剛結束  - 做精英中的精英
{\rENG}- It's just over  - To be the best of the best

905
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,580
就是犯錯後仍然繼續努力
{\rENG}means you make mistakes and then you go on.

906
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,150
這對大家來說都一樣
{\rENG}It's just like the rest of us

907
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,740
你以為我不知道嗎
{\rENG}You don't think I know that?

908
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:13,910
我是來幫你的

謝謝你
{\rENG}Look, thank you

910
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:22,850
我想別人幫我的話 自然會開口
{\rENG}But if I wanted help, really,I would have asked for it

911
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,800
原來我來遲了
{\rENG}So I'm too late

912
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,900
你已經離開了
{\rENG}You've already left

913
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,210
你什麼都沒學到
{\rENG}You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?

914
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,840
你只學會退縮
{\rENG}Except to quit

915
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:49,010
你真的很擅長做這種事呢
{\rENG}You've got that maneuver down real well

916
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,060

01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:03,690
你爸爸和我在奧利士卡尼號的VF51小隊並肩作戰
{\rENG}I flew with your old man VF-51, the Oriskany

924
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:13,570
你真的很像他
{\rENG}You're a lot like he was Only better and worse

925
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,840
他是一個天生的英雄主義者
{\rENG}He was a natural heroic son of a bitch, that one

926
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,780
他真的沒做錯
{\rENG}So he did do it right

927
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,290
是的 他沒做錯
{\rENG}Yeah, he did it right

928
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:45,370
所以你這樣開戰機 你想證明什麼
{\rENG}Is that why you fly the way you do?Trying to prove something?

929
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,810
你爸爸的確沒做錯
{\rENG}Yeah, your old man did it right

930
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:55,380
我要告訴你的事是機密事件 可能會令我丟掉工作
{\rENG}What I'm about to tell you is classified.It could end my career

931
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,710
我們置身於一場 我夢寐以求的戰鬥之中
{\rENG}We were in the worst dogfight I ever dreamed of

932
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:02,880
敵機像螢火蟲般佈滿天空
{\rENG}Bogies like fireflies all over the sky

933
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,250
他的F4戰機被擊中 他受了傷
{\rENG}His F-4 was hit, he was wounded,but he could've made it back

934
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,700
他本來可以回基地 但是他留在戰場
{\rENG}He stayed in it, saved three planes

935
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,390
在墜毀之前救了三架戰機
{\rENG}before he bought it

936
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,470
我怎麼會從沒聽說過
{\rENG}How come I never heard that before?

937
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,900
州政府不會告訴家屬
{\rENG}That's not something the State Department tells dependents

938
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,140
因為地圖出錯而發生戰事
{\rENG}when the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map

939
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:26,780

{\rENG}- So you were there?  - I was there

941
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:33,280
我的選擇
{\rENG}My options, sir

942
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,710
很簡單
{\rENG}Simple

01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:41,480
你已經拿到足夠分數 出席明天的畢業禮
{\rENG}First, you've acquired enough points to show up tomorrow and graduate with your Top Gun class

944
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:44,030
否則就退學
{\rENG}Or you can quit

945
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:49,270
這不是丟臉的事 那樣打轉我也會被嚇倒
{\rENG}There'd be no disgrace That spin was hell.It would've shook me up

946
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:51,170
你認為我應該退學
{\rENG}So you think I should quit?

947
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,100
我沒說過
{\rENG}I didn't say that

948
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:59,980
你覺得是你害了野鵝 而且有信心危機
{\rENG}The simple fact is, you feel responsible for Goose,

949
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,950
我不會坐在這兒跟你說好話
{\rENG}Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass, lieutenant

950
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:09,080
一個好機師必須評估發生的事
{\rENG}A good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what's happened

951
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,820
這樣才能學以致用
{\rENG}So he can apply what he's learned

952
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:17,890
到了高空我們就要全力以赴 這是我們的職責
{\rENG}Up there, we gotta push it That's our job

953
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:24,030
上尉 這全看你的選擇
{\rENG}It's your option, lieutenant, all yours

954
