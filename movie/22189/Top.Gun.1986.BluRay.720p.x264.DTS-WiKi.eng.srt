1
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,630
Morning, Scott.
Morning, Wells.

2
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,430
Ghost Rider, we have an unknown
aircraft. Vector 090 for bogey.

3
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,870
- Who's up there?
- Cougar, Merlin, Maverick and Goose.

4
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,040
Great. Maverick and Goose.

5
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,930
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Roger, I got them. 900 knots closure.

6
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,680
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.

7
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,100
- Merlin, you got them?
- I've got radar contact.

8
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,730
- I'll get a visual ID. You hook them.
- I'll clean them and fry them.

9
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,870
Ghost Rider, 203. I have them inbound,
bogeyheading 270 at 10 miles.

10
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,670
- 900 knots closure.
- Take angels 10, left, 3, 0.

11
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,340
- Are we expecting visitors?
- Negative, sir.

12
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,470
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

13
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,310
Do you see a trailer?.
Looks like he's a single.

14
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,240
- I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.
- Take it easy. I'll see if he's really alone.

15
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,890
- He's coming right at us, Mav.
- Okay, buddy. What's on your mind?

16
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,770
- Shit, there's two of them. MiG-28s!
- What? What's their position?

17
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,730
- 250 miles out, sir.
- Get them out of here!

18
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

19
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,120
I lost him in the sun! Shit, what's
he doing? You got him, Merlin?

20
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,170
He's coming around on our tail!

21
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,010
Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.

22
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,760
What's their range now?. If they break
150 miles, launch the alert five aircraft.

23
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,100
- Airspeed 300. Go get them, Mav!
- I'm going for missile lock.

24
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:19,030
Let's see if we can scare him
out of here. Lock up, baby.

25
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,070
I've got him locked. Bingo!

26
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,960
- We got him, Mav. He's bugging out.
- Mustang, MiG two is headed home.

27
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,300
- What's their position?
- 180 miles and bearing 010, sir.

28
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,640
- He's got missile lock on us!
- He's engaging me.

29
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,730
Goddamn it. Mustang,
this bogey's all over me.

30
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,230
- Do I have permission to fire?
- Do not fire until fired upon.

31
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,990
- There they are.
- The MiG's in perfect firing position.

32
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,870
- No way. He would have fired by now.
- Maverick, get this asshole off me!

33
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,880
Easy, Cougar. Bring him back,
hard right. Help me engage.

34
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,590
I'm on my way.

35
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,440
I can't shoot, so let's have a little fun.

36
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,290
Is this your idea of fun?

37
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,500
Greetings.

38
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,960
Watch the birdie.

39
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,880
Geez, I crack myself up.

40
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,520
Great shot.
I should be a photographer.

41
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,520
Cougar, your tail is clear.
MiG one has bugged out.

42
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,910
Cougar, we've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?.

43
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm getting low on fuel,
so we're heading home.

44
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,590
We'll see you on deck.

45
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,310
We're running low on gas.

46
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,690
Cougar?.

47
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,690
We're on vapour.
Let's do it.

48
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,530
Cougar, come on!

49
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:21,290
- Let's take ltback to the ship, man.
- Get him on deck as soon as possible.

50
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,880
Cougar, we've got to land this thing.
We are way low on gas.

51
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,800
Are you all right?

52
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,360
- Maverick, call the ball.
- Roger. Maverick has the ball.

53
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,740
- Cougar's in trouble.
- Come on, we're getting low on gas.

54
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,780
- Let's land this sucker.
- Cougar!

55
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,550
- Goddamn it!
- We've got no fuel for this.

56
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,460
We're going after Cougar.

57
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,810
- Tell him to land. That's an order!
- You're instructed to land immediately.

58
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,480
Have you boys seen an aircraft carrier?.

59
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,990
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.

60
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,580
You're okay, Cougar. Just stay on
my wing. I'll take you all the way in.

61
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,770
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

62
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,770
You're a little low. You're a little low.
Come on, buddy, pull up.

63
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,610
Pull up, Cougar.

64
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,700
That's it. Almost there.

65
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,950
A little below glide path. Call the ball.

66
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,500
Rogerball.

67
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,430
You're too low. Increase power!

68
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,650
Come in.

69
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,120
- What's on your mind?
- My wife and kid, sir.

70
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,160
I almost orphaned him today.
I've never even seen him.

71
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,670
- I was so scared.
- We've seen this before.

72
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,460
No, sir.

73
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm holding on too tight.
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.

74
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,360
Cougar?.

75
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,360
Thanks, Maverick.

76
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,200
- Maverick, Goose, come in here.
- What the hell's going on?

77
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,040
- I don't know.
- Shit.

78
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,920
Maverick,
you just did an incredibly brave thing.

79
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,260
What you should have done was land
your plane. It belongs to the taxpayers!

80
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,510
Your ego's writing cheques
your body can't cash.

81
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,480
You've lost your qualifications
as section leader three times.

82
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,110
Put in hack twice by me
with a history of high-speed passes -

83
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,240
- over five air control towers
and one admiral's daughter!

84
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:22,080
- Penny Benjamin?
- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.

85
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,580
Let's not bullshit. Your family name
ain't the best in the Navy.

86
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,380
You need to be doing it
better and cleaner than the other guy.

87
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,340
- Just want to serve my country, sir.
- Don't screw around with me.

88
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,100
You're a hell of a pilot. Maybe too good.
I'd like to bust your butt -

89
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,310
- but I have another problem here.
I have to send somebody to Miramar.

90
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,520
I've got to do something. I can't believe
it. I have to give you your dream shot.

91
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,280
I have to send you up against the best.
You characters are going to Top Gun.

92
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,410
For five weeks,
you're going to fly against the best.

93
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,870
You were number two. Cougar was
number one. He turned in his wings.

94
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,210
You guys are number one.
But you remember one thing:

95
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,470
You screw up, you'll be flying
a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit.

96
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,600
Yes, sir!

97
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,390
That is all.

98
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,860
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
Gentlemen?

99
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,610
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

100
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,450
During Korea, we shot down 12
of theirjets for every one of ours.

101
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:31,830
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-1 .
Our pilots were dependant on missiles.

102
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,420
Top Gun was created to teach ACM.
Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting.

103
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,970
- This gives me a hard-on.
- By the end of Vietnam, it was 12-1 .

104
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,260
- Don't tease me.
- Blinds, please.

105
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:51,350
Our commanding officer was the very
first man to win the Top Gun trophy.

106
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,770
You won't find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere. Commander Mike Metcalf.

107
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,110
- Call sign, Viper.
- Gentlemen ...

108
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,610
You're the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

109
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,750
The elite. The best of the best.
We'll make you better.

110
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,090
You fly at least two combat missions
a day, attend classes and evaluations.

111
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:27,430
On each combat sequence you're
gonna meet a different challenge.

112
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:34,640
We'll teach you to fly the F-14
faster than you've ever flown before.

113
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,150
Now, we don't make policy here.
Elected officials, civilians, do that.

114
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,070
We are their instruments and must
always act as though we are at war.

115
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,460
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering who's the best.

116
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,790
In case some of you wonder
who the best is, they're on this plaque.

117
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,010
The best driver and his RIO
from each class has his name on it.

118
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,970
They have the option to come back here
and be Top Gun instructors.

119
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,560
- You think you will be on the plaque?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,650
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

121
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,910
- Yes, sir.
- I like that in a pilot.

122
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,000
Remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

123
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:42,750
This school is about combat.
There are no points for second place.

124
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,630
- Dismissed.
- Nice going.

125
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:54,100
The plaque for the alternates
is down in the ladies' room.

126
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,480
Jesus ... You kill me.

127
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,770
You really do ...
There's two O's in Goose, boys.

128
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,590
- This I call a target-rich environment.
- You live your life between your legs.

129
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Even you could get laid in here.

130
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,590
I'd be happy to find a girl
who'd talk dirty to me.

131
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,270
You wanted to know who the best is?
That's him. Iceman.

132
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,560
He flies ice-cold. No mistakes.

133
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:49,650
Wears you down. You get bored,
do something stupid, and he's got you.

134
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:57,290
- I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
- Whose butt did you kiss to get here?

135
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,120
- The list is long but distinguished.
- So is myjohnson.

136
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,840
- So you're flying with lceman?
- Hey, Mother Goose, how's it going?

137
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,170
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazansky.

138
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,430
Congratulations on Top Gun. Sorry to
hear about Cougar. He was a good man.

139
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,480
- Still is a good man.
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

140
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,690
You need any help?
You figured it out yet?

141
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,860
- What's that?
- Who's the best pilot.

142
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,620
- I can figure that one out on my own.
- I heard that about you.

143
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,870
You like to work alone.

144
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,630
You're lucky. First the MiG
and then you slide into Cougar's spot.

145
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,420
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.

146
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,760
Some pilots wait a whole career to see
a MiG up close. Lucky and famous?

147
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:01,600
- You mean notorious. See you later.
- You can count on it.

148
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:07,270
- They were abused children.
- We're gonna have a good time.

149
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,990
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?
All right, the bet is 20 dollars.

150
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,750
You have to have carnal knowledge,
of a lady this time, on the premises.

151
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,170
- On the premises.
- Come on, a bet's a bet.

152
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,470
I don't know, it just doesn't seem fair ...
for you, I mean. But ...

153
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,090
She's lost that loving feeling.

154
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,600
No, she hasn't. She has not lost ...

155
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,020
- She's lost it, man. Come on.
- I hate it when she does that.

156
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,860
- Excuse me, miss.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

157
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,670
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

158
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,930
I love that song. That's a new approach.
How long have you been doing this act?

159
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,230
- I don't know. Since ...
- Puberty?.

160
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,900
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

161
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:16,740
- Did your mother not like you?
- No, it's my call sign.

162
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,820
- You're a pilot?
- That's right. A naval aviator.

163
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,250
- Actually, we've only done this twice.
- How did you do?

164
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,210
- Crashed and burned on the first one.
- And the second?

165
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,210
I'll tell you tomorrow.
But it's looking good so far.

166
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,470
Well, Maverick. My friend just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you. Perry.

167
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,690
I'll be with you in just a second.

168
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:58,280
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- That depends.

169
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,530
- Are you a good pilot?
- I can hold my own.

170
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:11,580
Great. Then I won't have to worry about
you making your living as a singer.

171
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:24,050
I'm gonna need a beer to put these
flames out. Great, Mav. Real slick.

172
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,290
- A long cruise, was it, sailor?.
- Too long.

173
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,340
You want to just drop down on the tile
and go for it?

174
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,380
I actually had this counter in mind.

175
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,350
- That would be very comfortable, yeah.
- It could be.

176
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:14,560
I came in here to save you from making
a big mistake with that older guy.

177
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:21,280
Really?. So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

178
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,780
Maybe.

179
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,620
- I have to get up early in the morning.
- What are you doing?

180
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,580
Your friend was magnificent.

181
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,550
You'll also be trained and evaluated
by civilian specialists.

182
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,600
They are our best source of information
on enemy aircraft.

183
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,480
One of the most qualified is call sign
Charlie, with a Ph.D. in astrophysics.

184
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:04,700
Listen to her, because the Pentagon
listens to her about your proficiency.

185
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,410
All yours, Charlie.

186
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:14,960
Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s
and A-4s as our MiG simulators.

187
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:21,170
As you know, the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.

188
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,050
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots like the MiG-28.

189
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,930
However, the MiG-28 does have
a problem with its inverted flight tanks.

190
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,350
It won't do a negative G push-over.

191
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,150
The latest intelligence tells us
the most it will do is ...

192
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,940
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?

193
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,570
- The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
- How's that?

194
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,790
Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28 ...
Sorry, Goose.

195
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,790
We happened to see a MiG-28
do a four G negative dive.

196
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,710
Where did you see this?

197
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,140
That's classified. I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

198
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,350
I have Top Secret clearance.

199
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,060
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

200
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:27,320
- Well, it doesn't seem to be the case.
- So, where exactly were you?

201
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:34,290
We started up on his six when he pulled
through the clouds. I went above him.

202
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,790
If you were directly above him,
how could you see him?

203
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,750
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.

204
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,420
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.

205
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,890
You were in a four G inverted dive
with a MiG-28?

206
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,060
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

207
00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:01,100
- About two metres?
- 11/2. I have a great Polaroid of it.

208
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,860
- It was a nice picture.
- Lieutenant?

209
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,240
- What were you doing there?
- Communicating.

210
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,080
Keeping up foreign relations.

211
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,750
- I was, you know, giving him the bird.
- You know, the finger.

212
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,170
- I know the finger.
- I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.

213
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,170
- Excuse me.
- So you're the one?

214
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,180
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, we have a hop to take.

215
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:40,850
The hard-deck on this is 10,000 feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.

216
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,810
Move it!

217
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,530
Lieutenant!

218
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,620
Don't be late again.
You look great, honey.

219
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,200
Why didn't you tell me
you were the famous MiG lnsulter?.

220
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,580
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room.

221
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:12,760
I see 20 new hotshots every eight
weeks. I'm sure you can figure that out.

222
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:19,270
I'd just really like
to hear about the MiG sometime.

223
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,650
You've got security clearance.
You can read about it.

224
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,320
Maverick?.
I'm curious.

225
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:41,540
Who was covering Cougar while you
were showboating with his MiG?

226
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,870
Cougar was doing just fine.

227
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,300
This is your fiirsthop. Thejets you're
flying against are smaller and faster, -

228
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:56,510
-justlike the enemy MiGs.
As ofnow we are keeping score.

229
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,140
- I lost him, Goose.
- Show me what you've got, kid.

230
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,850
- I lost him.
- I'm looking.

231
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,690
- He's on our tail, coming hard.
- I got him. Here we go.

232
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,590
- Talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there. Closing in on us.

233
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,300
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

234
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,220
All right, Jester,
I'll give you a run for your money here.

235
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,900
Watch the mountains!

236
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:02,830
He's still back there. Come on, Mav,
do some of that pilot shit.

237
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,680
- Come on, bring it right.
- I've had about enough of this shit.

238
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,970
- I'll hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.
- You're mine.

239
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,690
Jesus Christ!

240
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,110
- Let's see what you've got now, Jester.
- Let's turn and burn.

241
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,930
- He's going vertical. So am l.
- We're going ballistic. Go get him!

242
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,610
He's going for the hard-deck.
Let's nail him.

243
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,110
No way, Jester. You're mine.

244
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,380
I've got you now!

245
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,800
- Jester's dead.
- Jester's dead.

246
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,770
Get your butts above the hard-deck
and return to base.

247
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,810
Yes, sir!

248
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,870
- This is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.
- Negative. The pattern is full.

249
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,500
- No, Mav. This is not a good idea.
- Sorry, but it's time to buzz the tower.

250
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,800
Goddamn son of a bitch!

251
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,850
Great balls of fire.

252
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,650
- Jester's dead.
- You won? Bullshit.

253
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,530
- Didn't everybody?.
- We got our butts kicked.

254
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,700
I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?"
He said, "Where did who go?"

255
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,040
- And he's laughing at us on the radio.
- That was me, dickhead. We won.

256
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,800
- All right!
- They won too, man.

257
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,720
- That's not what I heard.
- We got Jester.

258
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,100
- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.
- We nailed that son of a bitch.

259
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,440
- You guys really are cowboys.
- What's your problem, Kazansky?.

260
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,900
You're everyone's problem.
Every time you fly, you're unsafe.

261
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:24,950
- I don't like you. You're dangerous.
- That's right, lceman.

262
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,870
I am dangerous.

263
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:35,040
Maverick?. You and Goose
get your butts up to Viper's office, now!

264
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,300
Remember, no points for second place.

265
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,970
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- You shut up.

266
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:56,060
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys flew by
by at over 400 knots. I want their butts!

267
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,730
Damn it, that's twice.
I want some butts!

268
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:08,990
- That just about covers the fly-bys.
- Follow me.

269
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:18,620
Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day.

270
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,760
The hard-deck for this hop was
10,000 feet. You knew it. You broke it.

271
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:35,310
You followed Commander Heatherly
below after he lost sight of you. Why?.

272
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,060
Sir, I had him in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill.

273
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:49,070
He proceeded below the hard-deck.
We were below forjust a few seconds.

274
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,950
I had the shot.
There was no danger, so I took it.

275
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,160
You took it,
and broke a major rule of engagement.

276
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,340
Then you broke another one
with that circus stunt fly-by.

277
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,510
Top Gun rules of engagement exist
for your safety and for that of your team.

278
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:17,310
They're not flexible, nor am l. Obey them
or you're history. Is that clear?.

279
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,690
Yes, sir!

280
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,360
Dismissed.

281
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,920
I really enjoyed that, Mav,
thanks a lot. Holy shit.

282
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:52,550
Maybe I could be a truck driver. You got
the number of that truck-driving school?

283
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,720
Fitness report says it all.
He's a wild card.

284
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,770
Completely unpredictable.

285
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,150
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

286
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,240
Maverick. I flew with his old man.

287
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,870
Tell me, if you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

288
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,880
I just don't know.

289
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,140
- Still awake?
- Yeah.

290
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,230
- What's up?
- I can't sleep.

291
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:53,990
When I realised we were off to Top Gun,
all I could think about was that trophy.

292
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,450
I've got to be straight with you, Mav.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

293
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,040
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.

294
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,720
I guess that fly-by
wasn't such a big hit, huh?

295
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,310
I know it's tough. The Academy rejected
you because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.

296
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,690
You have to live with that reputation.
But it's like you're flying against a ghost.

297
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,150
It makes me nervous.

298
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:44,410
You're the only family I've got.
I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.

299
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,590
Get out of here.

300
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,700
A rolling reversal
would work well in that situation.

301
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,450
If I reversed on a hard cross,
I could go to guns on him.

302
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,750
But at that speed, it's too fast.
It's a little bit too aggressive.

303
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,420
Too aggressive?

304
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,760
I guess when I see something,
I go right after it.

305
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:41,890
- You didn't tell me who you were.
- I didn't get a chance. You deserved it.

306
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:51,610
I know ... but you were tempted
to ask me out for dinner.

307
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,490
No. I don't date students.

308
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:12,420
I can see it's dangerous for you.
But if the government trusts me ...

309
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,510
... maybe you could.

310
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,720
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

311
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,410
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?.

312
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,830
Slider ...

313
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,670
You stink.

314
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,430
Let's go!

315
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,930
Come on, Mav. Just one more game.
That evens it up.

316
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,560
- I got some things to take care of.
- Just one more game.

317
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,230
Please? For me?
Come on ... For me?

318
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,020
Damn it.

319
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,320
Lieutenant?

320
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,580
- What? No singing?
- Look, I'm ...

321
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,540
No apologies.

322
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,640
If you don't mind, I'll just take a quick
shower while you're finishing up here.

323
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,350
I do mind. I'm hungry.

324
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,190
And then I thought about it.

325
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,910
I thought,
"You know, he's a smart guy."

326
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,080
"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here?"

327
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,330
It's the MiG.

328
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:30,340
The MiG. You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MiG-28.

329
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,270
I'm trying for this big promotion.
If I get it, I won't be here much longer.

330
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,480
Seems to me you've got it all figured out.

331
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,490
Except you did forget the wine.

332
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,030
Sorry.

333
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,660
- You always get what you want?
- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.

334
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:01,370
Then relax about the MiG.

335
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:18,220
This music ...

336
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,850
An old friend?

337
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:28,030
My folks loved it.
I haven't heard this in years.

338
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,320
My mother used to call from her room
and have me play this over and over.

339
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,990
I got so sick of it.

340
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,750
But not her. She'd sit up there alone,
just listening for hours.

341
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,510
Just listening.
She died shortly after him.

342
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,220
What happened to your father?.

343
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:06,440
I figured with your security clearance
you'd know more about it than I do.

344
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:12,030
Well, I didn't get that far.

345
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,490
It's a big mystery.

346
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,450
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.

347
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,290
The stink of it was ... he screwed up.

348
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,920
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

349
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,560
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

350
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,310
- Somebody must know.
- Yeah, somebody knows everything.

351
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,650
Is that why
you're always second best up there?

352
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,200
You are direct, aren't you.

353
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:07,500
I'm sorry I was late.

354
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:13,710
- I'm sorry for being direct.
- No apologies.

355
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,390
This is going to be complicated.

356
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,360
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna take a shower.

357
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,790
Thank you. I enjoyed being here.

358
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,740
It looks like you need another shower.

359
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:28,410
Right.

360
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,800
I'm gonna be honest with you.

361
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:41,140
Your MiG sighting
is really important to my work, but ...

362
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:50,270
I don't normally invite students
to my house. You're ...

363
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,070
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.

364
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,650
I'm glad we got that straight.

365
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:54,000
I told her how tough it is here.
My ass dragging like an old tired dog.

366
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,550
I told her you didn't even have a woman.

367
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,510
She said, "He probably
doesn't have one, but eight."

368
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:12,060
- Hi!
- Daddy.

369
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:23,570
Goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.

370
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,910
I didn't tell her that. I can't believe
you said that. That was a secret.

371
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,960
The bogey has good position right here.
Freeze frame. A moment of choice.

372
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:46,510
The F-14 is defensive.
He has a chance to bug out right here.

373
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:53,230
Better to retire and save your aircraft
than push a bad position.

374
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,690
Charlie, jump in here any time. You stay
in that diamond another three seconds, -

375
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,740
- the bogey's gonna blow you away.
You take a hard right, select zone five ...

376
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:08,910
You can extend an escape.
You made a bad choice.

377
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:16,330
- Charlie?
- Aircraft one performs a split S?

378
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,750
That's the last thing you should do.
The MiG's right on your tail.

379
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,590
Freeze there. The MiG has you in
his gunsight. What were you thinking?

380
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,350
You don't have time to think up there.
If you think, you're dead.

381
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:38,350
That's a big gamble
with a $30 million plane.

382
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:48,860
Unfortunately, it worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.

383
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:55,700
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical
move and defeats him with a missile.

384
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,340
The encounter was a victory, but we
show it as an example of what not to do.

385
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,630
Next.

386
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,340
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

387
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:17,140
Now then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook manoeuvre.

388
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,950
Lieutenant?

389
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,800
My review of your performance was
right on, in my professional opinion.

390
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,850
I can't hear you.

391
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,620
Jesus! And you call me reckless? When
I fly, my crew and my plane come first.

392
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:24,250
I'm gonna finish my sentence. My review
of your performance was right on.

393
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:30,130
I see some real genius in your flying,
but I can't say that in there.

394
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,220
I was afraid they'd see right through me.

395
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:39,980
I don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.

396
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,630
- Hey, Maverick?. Hear about lce?
- What's that?

397
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,010
- He won another one.
- Really?.

398
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,510
I fell the need ...
the need for speed.

399
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,520
This is hop 19. Multiple aircraft, multiple
bogeys. Your training is halfover.

400
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:52,320
The competltion for the trophy
remains tight. Firstplace, lceman.

401
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:55,820
Second, Maverick, two points behind.

402
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,570
There they are. Three miles, 10 o'clock.

403
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:04,950
I see them. Two A-4s.
Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.

404
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:21,470
- Good morning. The temperature is 1 10.
- Viper's up here? Great. Oh, shit.

405
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,890
He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."

406
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:36,740
- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.
- Roger, I've got the southern guy.

407
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:40,950
Hollywood, you lead. I'll cover you.

408
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,000
Break now, Jester.

409
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:01,180
We're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

410
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:12,940
- Goose, find Viper. He's out there.
- Stay with Hollywood.

411
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:17,900
- There's Viper. Three o'clock low.
- We're Hollywood's cover.

412
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:22,200
- Don't you leave me.
- Hollywood, you're looking good.

413
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,530
I'm going after Viper.

414
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,120
- Goddamn you!
- Don't leave him.

415
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:34,290
Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.

416
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,510
Viper's coming down.

417
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,230
Holy shit. We're head-to-head.

418
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,740
Rock and roll! Here's our big chance.

419
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:12,540
Come on, goddamn it.

420
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,550
Come on, keep coming.

421
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:24,640
Okay, sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.

422
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,750
Come around. That's it.

423
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:40,390
- Jesus, he's good. Where's he going?
- Come on, come on. Keep coming.

424
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:46,810
Come on, baby.

425
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,860
Damn, this kid's good.

426
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,690
He's too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.

427
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,280
Come on, come on.

428
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,040
Stick with it ...

429
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,040
- Hold it. Check our tail.
- Shit, there's Jester!

430
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:18,170
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

431
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:25,470
The Defence Department regrets to
inform you your sons died of stupidity.

432
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,690
Knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

433
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,570
- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.
- Shut up!

434
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:46,490
That was some of the best flying
I've seen yet. Until you got killed.

435
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,420
You never, never leave your wingman.

436
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:02,270
Maverick ... It's not your flying,
it's your attitude.

437
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:10,990
The enemy's dangerous, but right now
you're worse. Dangerous and foolish.

438
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:18,280
You may not like who's flying with you,
but whose side are you on?

439
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:32,550
At least Viper got lceman before
he got us. We've still got a shot at it.

440
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,890
That was stupid, I know better than that.
That will never happen again.

441
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:45,020
I know ...

442
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,070
I know.

443
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:44,500
Go fetch him.
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

444
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:50,750
- Hell no. Well, there was the time ...
- Admiral's daughter.

445
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,260
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

446
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,010
Did he? Great.

447
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:04,740
He tells me about all of them. My angel
Goose goes home early for church.

448
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:09,280
- You go home with the hot women.
- Thank you, Carole.

449
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:14,870
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

450
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:36,140
I'd love to be able to warn you off about
Maverick, but I just love him to death.

451
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,650
I've known Pete for a lot of years.
One thing's for certain.

452
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:47,990
There are hearts breaking wide open
all over the world tonight.

453
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,620
Unless you are a fool,
that boy is off the market.

454
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:58,210
He is 100%%% prime time in love with you.

455
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:04,090
Hey, Goose, you big stud.
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

456
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,970
Show me the way home, honey.

457
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,340
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

458
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,670
Maverick, you big stud ...

459
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,270
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

460
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,950
This is hop 31.
Two weeks to graduation.

461
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,540
The Top Gun trophy
is still up forgrabs.

462
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,590
The score is tied. Time for the big one.

463
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:04,930
- Are you up for this one, Maverick?.
- Just a walk in the park.

464
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,520
Contact. Multiple bogeys. Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.

465
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:15,690
- I see them. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.
- I'm in.

466
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:39,460
That son of a bitch cut me off.

467
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:52,230
Come on. Jesus Christ, lce.
Take the shot. Get the hell out of there.

468
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,240
I can't get the angle. I'm too close.
I'm switching to guns.

469
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,620
Fire or clear!

470
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:10,250
- Christ, I can take a shot right here.
- 20 seconds and I've got him.

471
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:20,300
- I'm moving in. I've got the shot.
- Come on, Mav.

472
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:25,640
- He's getting impatient. Take the shot.
- 10 more seconds.

473
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:32,480
Get the hell out of there.
Come off my right. I'm in.

474
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:35,650
- Five more seconds.
- I'm in.

475
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,030
I'm off. Shit.

476
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,330
We're in a jetwash. Shit!

477
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:52,290
This is not good. We've got a flame-out.
Engine one is out ... Engine two is out.

478
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,550
I'm losing control. I can't control it!

479
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,600
It's coupling up. This is not good!

480
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:09,270
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin heading out to sea!

481
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:14,730
Altitude 8,000 ... 7,000 ...

482
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:17,780
We're at 6,000!

483
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:22,420
I can't reach the ejection handle!

484
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:31,210
- You're gonna have to punch us out.
- I can't reach the ejection handle!

485
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,970
- Eject ...
- Watch the canopy!

486
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,990
Goose ... Oh, no!

487
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,330
Oh, God.

488
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:51,210
Sir, let go of him.
You've got to let him go, sir.

489
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:40,480
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.

490
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:44,780
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

491
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:52,370
You flyjets long enough,
something like this happens.

492
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:56,960
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

493
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:05,010
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.

494
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:11,510
The first one dies, you die too.
But there will be others.

495
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,270
You can count on it.

496
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,270
You've got to let him go.

497
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,190
You've got to let him go.

498
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:44,340
I think maybe it was my fault.

499
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:47,920
I don't know.

500
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:52,140
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

501
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:57,350
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.

502
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:07,070
God, I want him back.

503
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:15,800
I'll be here if you need me, okay?.

504
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:11,120
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

505
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:33,780
He would have flown anyway ...
without you.

506
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:39,570
He'd have hated it,
but he would have done it.

507
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:05,180
The spin was induced by the disruption
of air flow into the starboard engine.

508
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:09,350
This disruption stalled the engine, -

509
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,030
- which produced enough yaw rate
to induce a spin -

510
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,650
- which was unrecoverable.

511
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:23,450
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell
could see or avoid the jetwash.

512
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:28,920
The Board of lnquiry finds that he was
not at fault in the accident of 29 July.

513
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:35,710
His record will be cleared. He's restored
to flight status without further delay.

514
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,340
These proceedings are closed.

515
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,450
Get him up flying, soon.

516
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:22,770
- Come on, kid. Get in there. Engage.
- You've got a bogey at two o'clock.

517
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,860
Take the shot, kid.

518
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,570
You can engage any time, Maverick.

519
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,800
- Where the hell are you going?
- It doesn't look good.

520
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:53,380
What do you mean? It doesn't get
to look any better than that.

521
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:08,020
Hey, man. We could have had him ...

522
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:15,870
I'll fire when I'm goddamn
good and ready. You got that?

523
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:38,980
- He won't engage.
- It's only been a few days.

524
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:45,360
- He just might not make it back.
- Keep sending him up.

525
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:08,590
Mitchell?

526
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,220
I'm sorry about Goose.

527
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,060
Everybody liked him.

528
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:25,400
I'm sorry.

529
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:47,050
Hi, it's Wolfman.

530
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,220
Maverickjust quit.

531
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,870
Excuse me ...

532
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,120
- May l?
- Please.

533
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:34,480
I'll have what he's having.
Hemlock, is it?

534
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:39,310
Ice water.

535
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:45,120
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

536
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:50,150
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.

537
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:57,050
Thanks. But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

538
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:05,510
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks.

539
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:13,520
Where are you going?
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

540
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:20,700
I've seen all the evidence, and it's not
your responsibility. It's not your fault.

541
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:25,620
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.

542
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:30,290
What you do up there ... It's dangerous.

543
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:35,540
- But you've got to go on.
- You don't understand.

544
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:42,050
When I first met you,
you were larger than life.

545
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:46,890
Look at you.

546
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:52,310
You're not gonna be happy unless you're
going Mach 2 with your hair on fire.

547
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,310
No, that's over. It's just over.

548
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:01,820
To be the best of the best means you
make mistakes and then you go on.

549
01:20:02,070 --> 01:20:05,820
You don't think I know that?

550
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:09,330
I'm here to help.

551
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:17,470
Look, thank you. If I'd wanted help,
I would have asked for it.

552
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:27,360
So, I'm too late.

553
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:31,190
You've already left.

554
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:38,410
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?
Except to quit.

555
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:44,960
You've got that manoeuvre down
real well.

556
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,880
So long, Pete Mitchell.

557
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:24,660
Hi, Maverick, come on in. How are you?
Sure you're feeling okay?.

558
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:29,380
- Great.
- Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink?.

559
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:34,630
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.

560
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:59,950
I flew with your old man.
VF-51 , the Oriskany.

561
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:07,880
You're a lot like he was.
Only better ... and worse.

562
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,930
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch.

563
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:21,440
So he did do it right.

564
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,690
Yeah, he did it right.

565
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:40,790
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?

566
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:45,960
Yeah, your old man did it right.

567
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:50,340
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.

568
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:53,760
We were in the worst dogfight ever.

569
01:22:54,010 --> 01:23:00,020
Bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.
His F-4 was hit, -

570
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:03,230
- he was wounded, but he stayed.

571
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:10,110
- Saved three planes before he bought it.
- How come I never heard that before?

572
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:17,370
The battle occurred
over the wrong line on some map.

573
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,250
- So you were there?
- I was there.

574
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:27,800
- What's on your mind?
- My options, sir.

575
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:32,550
Simple.
You've acquired enough points -

576
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,810
- to show up tomorrow and graduate
with your class. Or you could quit.

577
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:44,230
There'll be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.

578
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:49,150
- So you think I should quit?
- I didn't say that.

579
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,490
You feel responsible for Goose.
And you have a confidence problem.

580
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:59,580
I won't blow sunshine up your ass.

581
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,300
A good pilot is compelled
to evaluate what's happened -

582
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:12,230
- and apply what he's learned. Up there,
we've got to push it. That's ourjob.

583
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:19,650
It's your option, Lieutenant.
All yours.

584
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:34,620
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir.
Thank you for your time.

585
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:38,750
No problem. Good luck.

586
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,220
- Gentlemen ...
- Where's Maverick?.

587
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:37,100
- I don't know where he is.
- You know what he's planning to do?

588
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:42,940
It's got to be hard on the guy though.

589
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:15,270
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

590
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:20,450
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.

591
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:29,120
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party
before it gets out of hand ...

592
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:34,460
Some of you have to depart
immediately. We have a crisis situation.

593
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:38,510
Ice, Slider ...
Hollywood, Wolfman.

594
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:45,850
- Maverick.
- Sir.

595
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:52,770
Maverick, you'll get your RIO
when you get to the ship. If you don't ...

596
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:57,280
... give me a call. I'll fly with you.

597
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:16,670
The SS Layton has become disabled
and has wandered into foreign territory.

598
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:22,680
A rescue operation will soon begin.
Your mission is to give it air support.

599
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:29,720
There are MiGs in the area. If you
witness a hostile act, return fire.

600
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:36,280
They carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.
They can fire it from 100 miles away.

601
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:42,740
This is the real thing.
This is what you've been trained for.

602
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,040
Make us proud.
Ice ... Hollywood, sector two.

603
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,340
Maverick, you back them up with Merlin
on ready five.

604
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:55,890
- Yes, sir.
- Rise.

605
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:00,880
Excuse me, sir. This is not personal.

606
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:07,190
- But is Maverick the best pilot to ..?
- I know what's on your mind. Get on it.

607
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:29,570
You've got a pair of bogeys,
12 o'clock, 15 miles.

608
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:35,540
Voodoo One, 090, radar contact
15 miles. They're doing 500 knots.

609
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,450
Roger, that's your bogey.

610
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:43,290
Dead ahead, 15 miles, 600 knots.

611
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:56,220
They're at 15,000 feetnow, 10 miles.

612
01:29:56,470 --> 01:30:00,690
800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.

613
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:05,320
Wood, you got them? They must
be close. I'm getting a hard-on.

614
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:19,790
- I'm taking the lead. Let's identify them.
- Roger. I'm on your leftside, a little low.

615
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,920
Maverick's up and ready in alert five.

616
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,220
Mybogey's still locked up.
He's drifting to the left.

617
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:36,970
- Stillmanoeuvring, course 090.
- Let's bring It to the right.

618
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:51,950
Ice, we've got a problem. I have four
aircraft on radar. Four bogeys.

619
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,990
Wood, we've got four bogeys.

620
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,790
- Wrong, make that five!
- There's five, sir.

621
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,170
- Oh, shit!
- He's got a radar lock on us.

622
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,170
Get out of there, Hollywood!

623
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:25,610
I'm hit. We're coming apart.
I can't control it! We're going down.

624
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,790
Wood's been hit. Wood's been hit!

625
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:32,290
Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.
We've lost Hollywood!

626
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:35,710
- We've lostHollywood.
- Launch Maverick.

627
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:41,000
Get a bearing on Hollywood and
Wolfman. Launch the rescue helicopter.

628
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:11,330
- Iceman, what's your position?
- 090 at 180 miles.

629
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:16,170
- They're coming in left.
- Three MiGs dead ahead.

630
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:23,050
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

631
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:27,720
We have four on our tail.
That makes six of them!

632
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:38,150
- He's firing. Break right.
- This is Voodoo One. We are defensive.

633
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,940
- Launch the alertfiighters!
- 160 miles and closing in fast, sir.

634
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,860
Ready Willard and Simkin.

635
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:53,620
- I'll be there in 30 seconds.
- I'm engaged with five. I'm in deep shit.

636
01:32:56,410 --> 01:33:01,380
- Willard and Simkin?
- We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

637
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:06,090
How long? 10 minutes?
It's over in two minutes!

638
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,730
One MiG 12 o'clock high ...
Watch your back!

639
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:23,330
- Break right!
- Shit, that was close.

640
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:27,120
- Maverick, getyourbutt down here!
- Hang in there.

641
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:32,880
Jesus Christ!

642
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:37,220
How about some help? Engage!

643
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:41,300
We've got a MiG on our tail.

644
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:44,890
Watch out!

645
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:50,600
We just flew right through his jetwash!

646
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:53,650
Get control!

647
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:05,790
- Good recovery.
- Let's get in there and help lce.

648
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:10,790
- Let's get back in the game.
- No, it's no good.

649
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:18,920
- Goddamn it. Maverick's disengaging.
- I knew it. Shit!

650
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:27,640
Get in there, come on.
What the hell are you doing?

651
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:33,730
- Ice won't last down there alone ...
- Talk to me, Goose.

652
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:37,530
Maverick!

653
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:42,110
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.

654
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:51,500
- I can't get him off my tail.
- I've got your MiG dead ahead.

655
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,790
I got tone. Firing!

656
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,650
- Where are they?.
- 155 miles.

657
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:16,230
- Two MiGs dead ahead.
- I see them. I'll take it left.

658
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,790
Oh, my God.

659
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:26,750
Ice is right below with a MiG on his tail.

660
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,670
He's firing. Break left!

661
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:34,840
He overshot!

662
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:40,520
Coming in, lce.
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.

663
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:45,100
One MiG passing between us.

664
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:52,240
You've got a MiG on your left.
He's gonna fire!

665
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,290
Check the guy to the north!

666
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:08,790
Banking left.

667
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:15,630
- There he is. Get him, lce!
- Okay, you guys, I'm coming in.

668
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:23,140
- A MiG's coming round on our tail.
- I can't leave lce.

669
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:28,150
- He's gonna get behind us!
- I'm not leaving my wingman.

670
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:35,950
I'm on his tail. I'm going
for the shot right now. Roger, engaged!

671
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:43,450
- I've got radar lock.
- I'm taking the shot. Fire!

672
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:51,850
- Bingo!
- Watch out, there's a MiG to your right.

673
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:54,850
He's firing!

674
01:36:55,100 --> 01:37:01,310
- I'm hit. We're hit in the right engine.
- I'm shutting it down.

675
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,700
Coming in, lce.

676
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:16,410
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm manoeuvring for a shot.

677
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,670
- Take the shot.
- I can't get a tone.

678
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,170
Shoot. I can't get him off my tail.

679
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:30,090
- We're hit again.
- We're okay.

680
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:33,140
On the count of three, break hard right.

681
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:37,020
Three ... two ... one ... break right!

682
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:43,480
Firing!

683
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:49,320
- Damn it, I missed.
- Don't let him go.

684
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:53,570
I got him. Here comes the shot.

685
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:02,750
Strike three.

686
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,760
- There's a MiG on your tail.
- We've only got one missile left.

687
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:10,800
1 10 miles, sir.

688
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:13,760
I got him. He's on our tail.

689
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:25,020
He's still with us.

690
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:32,360
- You're slowing down.
- I'm bringing him in closer.

691
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:42,250
- This is it.
- I'll hit the brakes. He'll fly right by us.

692
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,510
Now!

693
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:55,050
I've got a good lock. Firing.

694
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,100
Strike four!

695
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:10,450
This is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.

696
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:29,140
- This is Maverick, requesting fly-by.
- Negative, the pattern is full.

697
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:34,730
Is there something I should know about?

698
01:39:53,290 --> 01:39:55,960
Goddamn that guy.

699
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:55,030
You!

700
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,240
You are still dangerous.

701
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:05,040
But you can be my wingman anytime.

702
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:09,790
Bullshit. You can be mine.

703
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:05,300
Maverick?. You're on the front pages
of all the English-speaking world.

704
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:09,480
Even though the other side
denies the incident, congratulations.

705
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:16,150
They gave you your choice of duty, son.
Where do you think you want to go?

706
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:20,960
- I thought of being an instructor, sir.
- Top Gun?

707
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:24,740
- Yes, sir.
- God help us.

708
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:48,380
Hello, Pete Mitchell.

709
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:57,050
I heard the best of the best
were gonna be back here, so ...

710
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:04,430
This could be complicated.

711
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:08,650
You know,
on the first one, I crashed and burned.

712
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:13,230
And the second?

713
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:21,250
I don't know.

714
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:25,550
But it's looking good so far.
