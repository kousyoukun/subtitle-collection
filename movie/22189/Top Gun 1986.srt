-Yes, she has.

316
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,180
-She has not lost that...
-Goose, she's lost it.

317
00:21:41,264 --> 00:21:42,389
Mav. Come on.

318
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:45,726
l hate it when she does that. Shit.

319
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:53,233
-Excuse me, miss.
-Hey, hey, hey.

320
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:55,027
Don't worry, l'll take care of this.

321
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,865
(SlNGlNG)
You never close your eyes anymore

322
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:02,784
When I kiss your lips

323
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,997
There's no tenderness like before

324
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:10,542
In your fingertips

325
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,962
You're trying hard not to show it

326
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:16,131
ALL: Baby

327
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,175
But, baby

328
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:21,678
Believe me I know it

329
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,141
You've lost that loving feeling

330
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:30,646
Whoa, that loving feeling

331
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,982
You've lost that loving feeling

332
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:38,028
Now it's gone, gone, gone

Ba-doom ba-doom boom boom
Ba-doom, ba-doom...

How long have you two
been doing this act?

345
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:04,888
Oh, l don't know, since...

346

-Puberty?
-Right, puberty.

347
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,561
-l'm Charlotte Blackwood.
-l'm Maverick.

348

349

Did your mother not like you
or something?

350
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:16,650
No, it's my callsign.

351

-(GASPS) You're a pilot.
-That's right, a naval aviator.

352
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,822
Oh.

353
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:24,658
No, actually, we've only done this, twice.

354
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:26,243
Oh, how'd you do?

355
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:30,080
Crashed and burned on the first one.
lt wasn't pretty.

356
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:33,500
-And second?
-l don't know. l'll tell you tomorrow.

357
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,460
But it's looking good so far.

358
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,632
Well, uh, Maverick,

359
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:44,219
my friend's just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you.

360
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:45,721
-Perry.
-Hi.

361
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:46,972
Hi. Here you go.

362
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,474
Oh, l'll be with you
in just a second, okay?

363
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:55,147
Listen, can l ask you
a personal question?

364
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:57,024
That depends.

365
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:01,445
Are you a good pilot?

366
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,947
l can hold my own.

367
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:05,616
Great.

368
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:10,203
Then l won't have to worry about you
making your living as a singer.

369
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,755
l'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out. Yo!

370
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:23,467
Great, Mav. Real slick.

371
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:51,286
-lt was a long cruise, was it, sailor?
-lt was too long.

372
00:24:52,163 --> 00:24:55,415
What did you wanna do, just drop
right down on the tile and go for it?

373
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:58,335
No, l actually had...

374
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:00,420
Had this counter in mind.

375
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:03,548
Great, that would be
very, very comfortable. Yeah.

376
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:04,883
lt could be.

377
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:10,555
Actually, l came in here
to save you from

378
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:14,101
making a big mistake
with that older guy.

379
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:15,852
Really?

380
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:20,607
So l could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

381
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:24,194
Maybe.

382
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:26,238
No?

383
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:28,490
l've gotta be at work
very early in the morning.

384
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:29,825
Then what are you doing here?

385
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:33,328
Your friend was magnificent.

386
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:40,419
Nah.

387
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:46,216
JESTER: Now, you'll also be trained and
evaluated by a few civilian specialists.

388
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:49,010
The civilians are here because
they are our very best source

389
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:50,804
of information on enemy aircraft.

390
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:53,765
One of the most qualified
is our TAGREP,

391
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,267
callsign, Charlie.

392
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,477
She has a Ph.D. in astrophysics,

393
00:25:57,603 --> 00:25:59,271
and she's also a civilian contractor,

394
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:01,022
so you do not salute her.

395
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,232
But you better listen to her,

396
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:04,651
because the Pentagon listens to her
about your proficiency.

397
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:06,737
-lt's all yours, Charlie.
-Thank you.

398
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,781
Hello.

399
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:13,076
We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s

400
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,661
as our MiG simulators.

401
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:16,955
Now, then, as most of you know,

402
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:19,875
the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio

403
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,460
that the MiG-28 has.

404
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:24,463
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots,

405
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:25,922
like the MiG-28.

406
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:27,132
However,

407
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,636
the MiG-28 does have a problem
with its inverted flight tanks.

408
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:34,806
lt won't do a negative-G pushover.

409
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:36,475
-The latest intelligence...
-GOOSE: Are you gonna tell her?

410
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,351
-...tells us that the most it will do...
-MAVERlCK: Nothing.

411
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:40,145
...is one negative...

412
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:42,773
Excuse me, lieutenant.

413
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:44,941
ls there something wrong?

414
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:47,569
Yes, ma'am, the data
on the MiG is inaccurate.

415
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,530
How's that, lieutenant?

416
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:53,408
Well, l just happened to see
a MiG-28 do...

417
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:54,826
We, we.

418
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,161
Sorry, Goose.

419
00:26:56,245 --> 00:27:00,165
We happened to see a MiG-28
do a four-G negative dive.

420
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,376
Where did you see this?

421
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:05,545
That's classified.

422
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:06,922
lt's what?

423
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:08,882
MAVERlCK: lt's classified.

424
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:11,051
l could tell you,
but then l'd have to kill you.

425
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:13,804
CHARLlE: Lieutenant,
l have top-secret clearance.

426
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:17,349
The Pentagon sees to it
that l know more than you.

427
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:22,020
Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so
in this case, now, does it?

428
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:24,231
So, lieutenant,

429
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:26,900
where exactly were you?

430
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:30,153
-Well, we...
-Thank you.

431
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,031
...started up on his 6
when he pulled through the clouds,

432
00:27:33,115 --> 00:27:34,199
and then l moved in above him.

433
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:36,243
Well, if you were directly above him,

434
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:37,911
how could you see him?

435
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:39,913
Because l was inverted.

436
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:41,248
Bullshit.

437
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,668
No, he was, man.
lt was a really great move.

438
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:46,378
He was inverted.

439
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:48,922
You were in a four-G

440
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,883
inverted dive with a MiG-28?

441
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:55,011
-Yes, ma'am.
-At what range?

442
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:56,930
No. About two meters.

443
00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:59,057
lt was actually about
one and a half, l think.

444
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:01,017
lt was one and a half.
l've got a great Polaroid of it.

445
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:02,310
He's right there.
lt must be one and a half.

446
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:03,436

This disruption stalled the engine,

1078

which produced enough yaw rate

which was unrecoverable.

There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell
could either see or avoid the jet wash

lt would've shook me up.

l didn't say that.

1196
01:23:50,114 --> 01:23:53,200
The simple fact is,
you feel responsible for Goose,

1197
