00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,949
Whoa! Whoa!

2
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:57,065
Whoa!

3
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:59,228
Whoa.

4
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:02,112
- Easy.
- Mornin'.

5
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:05,743
Mornin'. Y'all mind
steppin' aside?

6
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:09,463
- You know what I think?
- No, sir, I don't.

7
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:13,547
I think you got yourselves
a shipment of gold in that wagon...

8
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:16,273
that you're bringin'
to General Iee.

9
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:20,029
- Just who might you be?
- A friend of the Confederacy.

10
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:23,993
Why don't y'all show us what a
good friend you are by steppin' aside?

11
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:27,066
I'd be most happy to,
'cept first...

12
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:29,827
I'd be much obliged
if you'd give me that gold.

13
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,191
I don't think I heard you correct.

14
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:38,346
I think you did.
I'd Iike that gold now.

15
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:42,029
Iisten, mister, it ain't
very nice out here, as you can see.

16
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:44,469
There are five of us.

17
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:48,024
If you don't step aside now,
I'd just as soon kill you as not.

18
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:51,311
You wanna die out here in this
miserable weather, that's your choice.

19
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:54,906
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

20
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:56,905
Would you please
give me the gold?

21
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:29,105
Good afternoon, senators.

22
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,106
The president is very
grateful for your time here.

23
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:35,231
Believe me, this is a matter
of the utmost importance.

24
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:37,225
I cannot stress too much
the utmost secrecy.

25
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:39,874
Why don't you just
cut out the shit, George?

26
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:43,708
You're here to ask the committee
for money, so come out and ask for it.

27
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:46,592
Thanks for the advice.
I am gonna ask you for money.

28
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,665
Guess what else?
You're gonna give it to me.

29
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:51,632
You all remember
Dr. Hans Kleindast...

30
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:54,865
the Nobel Iaureate who helped us
during the space program?

31
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,433
For 20 years...

32
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,665
he's been keeping his face
off of Time magazine doing research.

33
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:02,109
His field of research
has been time traveI.

34
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,344
- Time traveI.
- Time traveI.

35
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,710
- Well, beam me up, Scotty.
- That's very funny, Senator.

36
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:10,911
- Wanna know what's funnier than that?
- He's gonna tell us.

37
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:13,906
The funny thing is...
the good doctor actually did it.

38
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,952
I thought that'd
get your attention.

39
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:23,709
He did it. The technology is
in the folders in front of you.

40
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:25,625
You won't understand it
any better than I can.

41
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:29,024
Now, you can't go forward,
because the future hasn't happened yet.

42
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,867
However, you can go back,
and that's where things get tricky.

43
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:36,345
If you go back and change something,
it's serious. It could be catastrophic.

44
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:38,629
It's Iike throwing
a stone in a Iake...

45
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,989
only now there
are ripples in time.

46
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,350
So you can't go back and kill Hitler,
much as we'd Iike to...

47
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:47,312
because it could cause
a chain reaction of events...

48
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,954
that could alter
or even destroy mankind.

49
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,343
And that, my good senators,
is where you come in.

50
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:57,952
We have to form a new agency to police
this technology and protect time.

51
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:01,310
It will be called the Time Enforcement
Commission or the T.E.C.

52
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:06,422
Eugene Matuzak of the Washington P.D.
is our choice to run the commission.

53
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:10,109
- How much is this gonna cost?
- A Iot.

54
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:13,391
- How much is a Iot?
- More than a Iittle
and Iess than too much.

55
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,784
This is not a good time
to ask for money. The economy--

56
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:20,787
Suppose one of our competitors goes
back in time and invents the computer?

57
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,705
Or the airplane or the automobile?

58
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:24,830
You wanna talk about
the American economy, Senator?

59
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:28,190
How about this one?
Saddam Hussein finances a trip to 1944.

60
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:29,787
He gets our technology...

61
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:32,593
and Iraq becomes the first country
to have the atomic bomb.

62
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:35,507
- Oh, you Iike that one.
- Not bad.

63
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:38,392
Try this one.
We think there's already been a ripple.

64
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:42,103
Ten days ago, the C. I.A. broke up
an arms sale to terrorists...

65
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,025
in Hamburg, Germany.

66
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:46,753
Ordinarily, that sort of news
doesn't cross the president's desk.

67
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,347
What made this different...

68
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,425
was that the purchase
was made with gold bullion...

69
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:53,028
and the bullion
was dated 1863...

70
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:55,947
and stamped
"Confederate States of America."

71
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:58,753
We had it carbon-tested
and authenticated. It's reaI.

72
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,143
Now, just think
about what I'm saying.

73
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:04,431
Going back in time
is a pretty easy way to make money.

74
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:08,507
Our committee would have exclusive
jurisdiction over this program?

75
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,667
Yours and yours alone. No one can know
about this. It's too dangerous.

76
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:15,143
That's very good, George.

77
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,429
Personally...

78
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:21,109
I think this sounds Iike that
bullshit Star Wars program.

79
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:26,029
You'Il get your money. Anyone here want
to chair the oversight on this program?

80
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,866
Yeah, I'Il do it.

81
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,991
Ah, young Senator McComb.

82
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:33,872
Why not?
Oh, you'Il Iike him, George.

83
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:38,266
Very much Iike you,
except his dorsal fin's a bit bigger.

84
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,909
There's never enough time.

85
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,428
Never enough for what?

86
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:25,108
To satisfy a woman.

87
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:28,470
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

88
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:31,312
Are you busy?

89
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,385
I'm meeting my husband.

90
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,551
If I were him,
l would not keep you waiting.

91
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:42,393
If he's not here when I turn around,
I'Il go home with you.

92
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:47,953
You'Il do.

93
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:51,704
Mmm.

94
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:54,705
I didn't hear you
leave this morning.

95
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:57,547
It was early.
I was meeting with Matuzak.

96
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,033
Are you gonna
take that job?

97
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,430
- What?
- Be right back.

98
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,544
Read it.

99
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:17,712
- "Wolverine"?
- Between the Iines.

100
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:21,627
I should get
the fuck outta here.

101
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:23,545
Good.

102
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:26,785
You know that purse?
Doesn't Iook good on you.

103
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:34,425
Thank you.

104
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:37,870
- Glad you're not hurt.
- Thank you.

105
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:57,907
Smart kid.
He read my mind.

106
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,825
With your English,
he doesn't have much choice.

107
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,991
Hey, I know all the good words.

108
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,668
You didn't answer my question.

109
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:10,463
- Are you gonna take this job?
- I think so.

110
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:12,863
Is this T.E.C. thing dangerous?

111
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:15,024
I don't bake cookies for a Iiving.

112
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,745
Will you have to traveI?

113
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,632
Not the way you think.

114
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:23,706
Pictures bring back your memories.

115
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:27,070
Aw, you're gonna
be very happy you have this.

116
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:29,145
Why?

117
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:32,465
I can see into the future.

118
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:35,352
- You can see the future, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,143
- What do you see?
- I see it's gonna rain.

120
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:41,828
We both have
the afternoon off.

121
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:47,227
Why don't we go and practice some of
those words you seem to Iike so much?

122
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:31,465
Max?

123
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:33,909
Hmm? What?

124
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:39,944
I have something I want to tell you.

125
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,865
Shit. I'm sorry.

126
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:46,424
Don't answer it.
Just this once, don't answer it.

127
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:49,074
I have to.

128
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,470
Walker.

129
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,425
Now?

130
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,267
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Can you find somebody else?

131
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:24,153
Iook, uh, somebody
called in sick and--

132
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,190
And there's nobody
but Max Walker...

133
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,424
- to keep the streets safe.
- I said I was sorry.

134
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,711
- It's not Iike I have a choice.
- Of course you have a choice.

135
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:35,787
- This is what I do.
- I know that's what you do.

136
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:38,672
It's just that things
are different now.

137
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:40,904
What are you
talking about?

138
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,350
This isn't the way
l wanted to do this.

139
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,311
I have to go.

140
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,589
There's something
you need to tell me?

141
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:51,063
Yes.

142
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,463
Can you wait
until I get back?

143
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:55,306
Sure.

144
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:07,949
Surprise.

145
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:42,034
Max!

146
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,545
Melissa!

147
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:51,704
Max!

148
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:55,389
- Finish him.
- Who are you?

149
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:58,910
You're a smart boy.
Why don't you sleep on it a while?

150
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:18,111
Nothing to see over there.
It's just another jumper.

151
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,025
Hang on, there, buddy!

152
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,582
All right, close enough! That's it!

153
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,904
Thank you!
Stand back, folks!

154
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:27,872
Come on! Break it up!
There's nothin' to see!

155
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:32,345
Go back to work. Come on!
Come on, now! Come on, now.

156
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:34,425
Break it up.
Go back to work.

157
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:37,074
Come on. Come on,
get out of here.

158
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,554
- Good morning, Mr. Atwood.
- Good morning, Charlie.

159
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:51,228
- It's a terrible day, sir.
- Beat it.

160
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:53,509
- What's goin' on?
- Mr. Floatbauer.

161
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:56,705
He went off the roof.

162
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,225
Ah, yeah.

163
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:02,511
Well, shit happens.
Excuse me.

164
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,062
Oh, that poor man!

165
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:11,905
Good morning, Pete.

166
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,871
Good morning, Mr. Atwood.

167
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:21,947
Third jumper this week. They keep
this up, you're gonna be out of a job.

168
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:23,945
Only going down, sir.

169
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,352
There he is!

170
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:34,552
- Mr. Atwood, isn't it terrible?
- Tragic.

171
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,431
...little Iovebirds

172
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,425
We're not above birds

173
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,630
Iet's misbehave

174
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:25,233
Slip and slide

175
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,828
Slip inside

176
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:31,229
Slip and slide

177
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:47,192
I Iearn to Iove
l Iearn to Iive

178
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,269
Get me Ross.

179
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:55,391
Ross! Hi!
Yeah, Iisten.

180
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,864
I want another 100,000 shares
of Middle States OiI.

181
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,946
No, no. Just buy it.
It's an act of faith.

182
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:04,707
I really think things
are gonna turn around.

183
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,103
I got a feeling
about the future.

184
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:09,549
Iook, I gotta go.
I'm-- I'm very busy.

185
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:27,187
- Walker.
- How've you been, Iyle?

186
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,749
How ya doin', partner?

187
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,793
- Ex-partner.
- Max.

188
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:45,423
I'm not gonna change a thing. The only
ripples'Il be in my swimming pooI.

189
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:48,586
It's a nice place.
You couldn't do this by yourself.

190
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:51,552
- Who are you working for?
- I'm not hurtin' anybody.

191
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:56,185
It's America, man! I'm just
takin' an opportunity, that's alI.

192
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:59,072
I've got to take you back.

193
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:10,871
I went ten rounds with
John I. Sullivan himself.

194
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,865
Oh.

195
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:17,589
I saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV.

196
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:09,231
- Mr. Atwood-- Oh, my god!
- Get down.

197
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:30,063
Doesn't Iook too good, Iyle.

198
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,985
Iet me go, Max.

199
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,030
I'Il stay here.
I won't go back.

200
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:36,230
Who sent you?
I want the name.

201
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:38,145
Iike it'Il make any difference.

202
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:41,032
In a few weeks,
this guy's gonna run the whole country.

203
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,151
If he doesn't get the money here,
he's gonna get it somewhere else.

204
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:47,988
I can't tell you. He'Il send somebody
back to wipe out my grandparents.

205
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:49,348
It'Il be Iike I never existed:

206
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:53,273
My mother, my father, my wife,
my kids, my fuckin' cat!

207
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:58,269
You ever hear of the name Aaron McComb?
Senator McComb?

208
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:00,189
Bullshit.

209
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:03,266
You don't understand.
He's gonna be president.

210
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:06,152
He's doin' this to get
money for his campaign.

211
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:09,988
Shit, Max, he already
owns most of the guys we work with!

212
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:12,952
When we get back,
you'Il point them out.

213
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:16,993
You're out of your mind.
This guy's gonna roll right over you.

214
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:19,383
- We'Il see. Iet's go.
- Iisten to me!

215
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:23,023
If I go back and talk,
my family is dead.

216
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:26,231
I'm talkin' about my f--
my family!

217
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,947
If I die here, it's only me.
I can't go back!

218
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:38,664
I have to bring you back.
I have no choice.

219
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:41,945
Neither do I.

220
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:03,587
Holy Mother of Mary!

221
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:10,350
Iieutenant Clapton, 0316.

222
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:12,311
Iieutenant Clapton.

223
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:15,550
Testify and I'Il do what I can.

224
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:19,786
Communication relays
rerouted to Alpha 02.

225
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:27,872
Captain Iyle Atwood,
you are charged with violations...

226
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:31,310
of T.E.C. code 40.8,
subsection nine...

227
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:33,988
time travel with intent
to alter the future.

228
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:37,783
Charges are compounded by your current
status as a time enforcement officer.

229
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:39,944
Does the defendant
have any statement?

230
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:43,504
- Tell her.
- Something to say on your own behalf?

231
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:47,143
- Yes.
- No.

232
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,953
Then I will pass sentence
as mandated by our charter.

233
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,992
Say something.
Come on. Say something!

234
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,304
The defendant has been
found guilty...

235
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:56,793
Take care of yourself, Max.

236
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,104
And is sentenced to death,
immediately.

237
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,785
Poor bastard.

238
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:16,627
Tomorrow might've been
a brighter day.

239
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:21,946
We're pickin' up
some noise outside Camp David, '79.

240
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,832
Intelligence thinks
it's a kill team out of Iran.

241
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,745
It's their third
try this year.

242
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,665
C. I.A.'s trying to Iocate
their Iaunch facility.

243
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:31,587
I want two teams on this date.
Iet's smoke these guys.

244
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:34,268
- Right.
- Number two: Ios Angeles, 1902.

245
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:38,984
Somebody's trying to get a jump on
real-estate, buying up Beverly Hills.

246
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:40,905
- Burr and Swain got the deaI.
- Yes, sir.

247
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:42,746
You Iook Iike shit.

248
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,665
- We have to talk.
- In a minute.

249
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:46,904
- Now.
- I said in a minute.

250
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:51,385
Temporary wave guide
shutdown in three minutes.

251
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:56,748
Shit. Go over your dispatch notes
and check with me before you Iaunch.

252
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,984
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- George. Welcome.

253
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:03,067
Gene. Senator Nelson, this is
T.E.C. Director Matuzak.

254
00:24:03,154 --> 00:24:06,191
Senator Nelson is the newest member
of the oversight committee.

255
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:08,265
Since he's gonna be voting
on your budget...

256
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:09,946
he'd Iike to see how it's spent.

257
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:13,470
Senator McComb,
our Iong-standing committee chairman...

258
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:17,388
agreed to take time out from his
presidential campaign to accompany us.

259
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:19,305
Senator.

260
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:21,703
WelI. Be a pleasure
to show you around.

261
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,103
Are these all of your agents?

262
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:27,106
Most of 'em. Agent Monroe.
Agent Anderson.

263
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:29,708
Agents Burr, Bartolo and Shepherd.

264
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:32,752
- Agent Walker.
- Agent Walker.

265
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:36,025
I've heard a great deal about you.

266
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:40,027
- And I've heard a Iot about you.
- Not all of it bad, I hope.

267
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:44,632
Agent Walker just returned
from a successful mission.

268
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:48,263
Well, congratulations,
Agent Walker.

269
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:54,147
Senator, now Director Matuzak
will show you the Iaunch room.

270
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,589
Follow me.
I'Il show you where we kick off.

271
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:59,029
You wouldn't mind
if Agent Walker accompanied us?

272
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:02,231
I'd Iove to hear about
his most recent mission.

273
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:06,705
- I have a report to file.
- Agent Walker would be delighted.

274
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:09,752
All units switch to TEC channel three.

275
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:12,826
All units switch
to TEC channel three.

276
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:15,064
As you can see,
we've spared every expense.

277
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:18,908
No comfort, no convenience,
no necessities. Watch your head.

278
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:21,189
So, Agent Walker,
who were you after?

279
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:23,868
A man named Atwood.
Ring a belI?

280
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:27,424
Atwood. No.
Should that name be familiar to me?

281
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:31,553
-Unfortunately, Atwood was a TEC agent.
-Really?

282
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:34,432
See, George, I don't
want to sound Iike a broken record...

283
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:37,312
but that's one of the dangers
of having an agency Iike this.

284
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:41,467
- Imagine the dangers of not having it.
- Did you know this Atwood?

285
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,385
He was my partner.

286
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:47,183
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nothing worse than a rogue cop.

287
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:50,664
- Except the guy who paid him.
- If there is such a guy.

288
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:54,508
- There always is.
- Do you know who the man is?

289
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,745
- Oh, yeah.
- Why don't you arrest him?

290
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:00,667
- I Iost my witness.
- Oh.

291
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:02,506
Well, I trust you'Il
keep working on it.

292
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,267
You can bet on it.

293
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,829
Hydrogen specialists,
prepare for inspection.

294
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:18,424
We've updated our entire operation
to Parker Datalink Systems...

295
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:20,550
utilizing their
superconducting chip.

296
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,829
Senator McComb
was Jack Parker's partner...

297
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,668
and sold out before the company
got the patent on that chip.

298
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:29,314
- Bet that cost you a few billion.
- Whoa, bad Iuck.

299
00:26:30,594 --> 00:26:33,984
My deal with Jack Parker
is not important, Mr. Spota.

300
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:37,066
What is important is talking about
the dangers of this program.

301
00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:40,430
- You got my vote.
- Excuse me. What dangers?

302
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:42,903
Well, dishonest agents
like this, uh, Atwood.

303
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:47,385
Every time an agent goes back,
he risks making contact with
the past version of himself.

304
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,113
- That could be a disaster.
- And why is that?

305
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:53,869
The same matter can't occupy
the same space at the same time.

306
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:56,184
It's never happened.

307
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:58,026
Not yet, but what I propose...

308
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:00,184
is far Iess costly
yet accomplishes the same thing.

309
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:02,151
Why don't we just
prevent time traveI...

310
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,146
rather than spend money
trying to police it?

311
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,190
I have to get back
to the HilI.

312
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:11,984
Malcolm, this is a project
that we could do without.

313
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:14,190
I hope you vote against
continued appropriations.

314
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:16,990
I admire your dedication,
Agent Walker.

315
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:20,392
I hope you keep trying
to get your man.

316
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,032
I never quit.

317
00:27:31,394 --> 00:27:32,986
We've done a breakdown
of the Iatest poll results.

318
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:35,708
While the trends
are not what we want...

319
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,944
there are some good things
we can utilize.

320
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,309
The numbers in the suburbs
are encouraging...

321
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:42,510
but they are killing you
in the urban centers.

322
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,633
But you're gaining with the pro-life,
pro-death-penalty coalition...

323
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:49,865
and with the close-our-border,
anti-immigration faction.

324
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:54,425
The bad news is the campaign chairman
put together a projected budget...

325
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:57,631
from now to Election Day,
and it's a big number.

326
00:27:57,714 --> 00:28:02,344
Even going back again, I don't see how
you could get it all in time.

327
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:08,786
Iawrence, I Iove you.
I really do.

328
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:11,069
But don't tell me
what I can't do.

329
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:13,748
Elections are won with television.

330
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,985
You don't need the press, endorsements.
You don't even need the truth.

331
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:17,790
You need money.

332
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,030
So... tell me.

333
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:25,471
How much is it gonna cost
to buy the network time I need?

334
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,863
- $50 million.
- $50 million.

335
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,945
Agent Walker has already
cost me that much.

336
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:34,027
We're gonna chat with him, the kind
of chat a man remembers for a Iifetime.

337
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:49,153
Sure is a handsome devil, isn't he?

338
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:52,624
- He's not my type.
- What did you want to talk about?

339
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:54,989
What do you know
about him?

340
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:57,304
Capable of eating
his young.

341
00:28:57,394 --> 00:28:59,862
He sure seemed interested
in you this afternoon.

342
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:01,831
He interests me.

343
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,791
Atwood named him.

344
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:07,708
- You're shittin' me.
- He's the one who sent him back.

345
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:11,230
- Why didn't he testify?
- McComb would go after his family.

346
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:14,829
He also said McComb
has half of the agency. I believe him.

347
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:17,712
He doesn't have me.

348
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:20,672
I said, he doesn't have me.

349
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:23,587
- Well, fuck you too.
- He's gonna close the agency.

350
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:26,984
Then no one can stop him
from going back.

351
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:29,634
- This one is mine.
- Not unless I say it is.

352
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:32,353
The son of a bitch
is a presidential candidate.

353
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:36,427
If you haul him in, you better have
enough evidence to plug up the Potomac.

354
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:38,391
- You believe me.
- I always believe you...

355
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:41,068
but you're not always right.

356
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,271
Yeah.

357
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:48,272
Come over to the house for dinner.

358
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:50,310
Carol would Iove to see you.

359
00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:52,783
Thanks. Some other time.

360
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,150
You're allowed to have a Iife.
I read it in a manuaI.

361
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:59,510
I'Il tell you this:
lf I cannot go back to save her...

362
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:02,870
this scumbag is not
going back to steal money.

363
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:06,825
Go home, Max.

364
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:11,032
If you won't come to mine,
go to yours.

365
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:18,592
By the way, when I said
McComb hasn't bought me...

366
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:21,711
you were supposed to say,
"I know that."

367
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:25,745
I know that.

368
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:52,509
System initialized.

369
00:30:52,594 --> 00:30:54,983
Destination, please.

370
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:57,269
Home.

371
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:37,670
There are no new messages.

372
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,268
Television.

373
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,668
Play tape.

374
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:55,905
It's going to Iook Iike
this when I'm finished.

375
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:58,383
See? Very nice.

376
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:02,070
"Victorian Villa Deluxe Birdhouse."

377
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:09,590
This thing is gonna be bigger
than our house by the time I'm done.

378
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,550
Okay. Uh-huh.

379
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:16,353
- Want some help?
-Want some help?

380
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,265
Yeah. You can buy the birdseed.

381
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:21,152
Okay. Divide all these parts...

382
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:24,510
into groups to determine
their structural function.

383
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,903
- I should buy more videotapes.
- I should buy more videotapes.

384
00:32:26,994 --> 00:32:28,825
Gotta be in the mood to do this.

385
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:32,065
- You were a second ago.
- You were a second ago.

386
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:34,031
I think that I should...

387
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:37,106
start with something
easier to put together.

388
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:39,469
Huh? Honey?

389
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:47,342
Maybe you should Iay out
all the parts first, then...

390
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:50,585
- You know--
- I think I wanna try from memory.

391
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:53,393
Just find part "A"
and work from there.

392
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:58,352
The controversy...

393
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:02,188
over government-provided campaign funds
is in the news again.

394
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:05,550
The White Supremacist Party has
qualified for matching funds...

395
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:09,468
sparking many groups to petition
for the abolition of the practice.

396
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,352
Meanwhile, Senator McComb's
fading presidential bid...

397
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:13,833
received another blow...

398
00:33:13,914 --> 00:33:16,712
when today it was denied
federal campaign matching funds.

399
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,752
Sources indicate
the senator is out of money...

400
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:22,826
and may be forced
to withdraw from the race.

401
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:25,223
Though no official
statement has been made...

402
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:29,068
independent party Ieaders claim that
the denial will bolster their play...

403
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,985
for the upcoming
presidential election.

404
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:34,111
With the polls showing
independent candidate Elgin Michaels...

405
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:36,025
trailing the incumbent
by only six points--

406
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:39,345
There are no new messages.

407
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:07,185
Who are you?
Who sent you?

408
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,549
Who sent you?

409
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:28,583
Fifty thousand volts, motherfucker.

410
00:35:28,674 --> 00:35:30,505
Have a nice day.

411
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,665
Walker?

412
00:35:51,794 --> 00:35:54,183
Walker!

413
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,511
My name's Fielding.
I'm with Internal Affairs.

414
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:03,309
He messed up my apartment.
You can kill him.

415
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,906
You've got some more inside.

416
00:36:07,994 --> 00:36:11,669
- Everybody freeze!
- I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

417
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,710
I.D.
I.D.

418
00:36:13,794 --> 00:36:15,671
Get in there.

419
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:17,790
You, he's under arrest.

420
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:19,705
They're all under arrest.

421
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:24,345
Assault, attempted murder,
makin' a mess.

422
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,550
Sector 17, Sector 19.

423
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:28,704
Report for duty
in five minutes.

424
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:42,505
If you'd Iike,
I'Il have the door removed.

425
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:44,425
I had company
this morning.

426
00:36:44,514 --> 00:36:47,074
- You Iook Iike they stayed awhile.
- McComb sent them.

427
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:49,429
- Did they say that?
- I said that.

428
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:52,187
- And what does I.A. want?
- Atwood was your partner.

429
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:55,789
Internal Affairs isn't convinced
you can be trusted anymore.

430
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:02,867
- She's not going to follow me.
- We've got a phase four. You take it.

431
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,388
Send somebody else.
I want to be where McComb is.

432
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:09,786
A Iittle refresher course in Agency
etiquette: I'm the director, I direct.

433
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:13,867
I authorize the missions. I make
the assignments. This one's yours.

434
00:37:13,954 --> 00:37:18,106
This agency isn't dead yet, but if I
can't keep you from McComb, it will be!

435
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,152
- Fielding, get in here!
- She'Il get in my way.

436
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:24,192
Ask her to stay behind you.
You've got an hour until Iaunch.

437
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:27,027
-You're not funny.
- I'm never funny.

438
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,303
Yeah?

439
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,703
Disturbance has jumped
from four to six, sir.

440
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:39,153
Yes.

441
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:49,103
Yes.

442
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:55,310
I catch you fuckin' this machine again,
I'Il break your neck.

443
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:58,033
- Sorry, Chief.
- Iooks Iike safe sex to me.

444
00:37:58,114 --> 00:38:00,150
- Show me.
- Okay.

445
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:05,308
Here we go. The ripple was steady
at four, then spiked past five to six.

446
00:38:05,394 --> 00:38:07,954
On the board, it Iooks
like it set off Waimea.

447
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:10,343
Somebody's really doing a number.

448
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:12,789
We've Iocated the point
of origin and...

449
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,672
- it's right here in Washington.
- Shit.

450
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,222
Come on.
You're out of here.

451
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:20,384
You should have an exhibit.

452
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:25,150
Oh, really? All my best stuff's
at home.

453
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:28,544
I really could care Iess
whether you Iike me or not...

454
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:30,465
but you don't know
a thing about me.

455
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:33,068
T minus three minutes and counting.

456
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:34,985
I've been with I.A. for two years.

457
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:39,750
I'm field-rated in weapons and tactics
and speak three Ianguages. Impressed?

458
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:43,065
- I'm blown away.
- I read the Atwood file.

459
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,065
You didn't mention you could read.

460
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:48,430
He was your friend,
and you still asked to go after him.

461
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:51,472
- He crossed the Iine.
- Or he crossed you.

462
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:55,991
Iaunch sequence activated.

463
00:38:56,074 --> 00:38:59,623
Authorized personnel only in the area.

464
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:02,706
She Iooks just Iike the Vollmers!

465
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:04,910
T minus two minutes and counting.

466
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,825
Why is everyone so nervous?

467
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:10,873
When a Iaunch goes wrong,
they're the guys who scrape the walI.

468
00:39:10,954 --> 00:39:13,991
And you do Iook Iike
the Vollmer twins.

469
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:16,065
Who are the Vollmer twins?

470
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:21,468
Iaunch personnel only in the bay.

471
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:34,546
T minus one minute 30 seconds
and counting.

472
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:40,308
Magnetic field polarity
initiation in ten seconds.

473
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,424
Telemetry check is initiated.

474
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:59,069
Are we gonna blast to the past!

475
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:02,271
Yee-hah!

476
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:09,670
Green for Iaunch!

477
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:18,025
I've run dozens
of simulated Iaunches...

478
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:20,184
but I-l never noticed
that wall before.

479
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:22,913
- "Simulated"?
- This is my first real Iaunch.

480
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:26,111
Great. Don't stick
your head out of the window.

481
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:29,470
- She's a Iittle shaky.
- Blood pressure'Il Ioosen her teeth.

482
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,311
Her pulse is pushing 140.

483
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,430
If she farts, she'Il get
ahead of the pod.

484
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,950
Fielding, Iisten to me.
it helps to concentrate...

485
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,106
on something relaxing
during a Iaunch.

486
00:40:44,514 --> 00:40:46,584
What do you think about?

487
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:49,909
Not swallowing my tongue.

488
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:53,112
- How's Walker?
- You'd have to shake him...

489
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:54,547
to be sure he's awake.

490
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:58,024
- He's awake.
-T minus 30 seconds.

491
00:40:58,114 --> 00:41:01,584
29... 28... 27... 26...

492
00:41:01,674 --> 00:41:06,589
25... 24... 23...
22... 21... 20...

493
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:09,950
- Have they ever Iost a pod?
- Ask the Vollmers.

494
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,832
- Where are they?
- See those two red spots?

495
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:15,474
12... 11... 10...

496
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:17,943
- Oh, God.
- Nine... eight... seven...

497
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:20,423
Six... five... four...

498
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:23,665
Three... two... one...

499
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:26,109
Zero.

500
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,984
They're away.

501
00:41:58,074 --> 00:42:01,111
Is this the hottest thing or what?

502
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:13,464
Goddamn Ricky.

503
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:18,025
So much for a dry run.

504
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:20,184
We're alive.

505
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:24,313
- Are we where we're supposed to be?
- Give me a date.

506
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:27,704
Sunday, October 9, 1994.

507
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:31,389
Target.

508
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:34,750
- We're close.
- October 9?

509
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,665
- I'Il be 16 tomorrow.
- Where?

510
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:41,191
I was Iiving in Colorado.
Man, this is weird. Whew.

511
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:45,313
Yeah? Well, don't get sentimental
and try to visit yourself.

512
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:49,182
I'd Iike to call myself, tell me not to
sleep with Bobby Morgan after my party.

513
00:42:49,274 --> 00:42:52,107
It's really disappointing.

514
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,424
A smart woman
would call Bobby...

515
00:42:54,514 --> 00:42:56,823
and give him
some advice.

516
00:42:56,914 --> 00:42:59,303
Aw, yeah, right.

517
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:08,429
- How Iong was Atwood your partner?
- Three years.

518
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:13,144
- Was it difficult to bring him back?
- What do you think?

519
00:43:14,434 --> 00:43:17,153
You got a family?
Hmm?

520
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:19,702
Mine's still in Colorado.

521
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:21,989
When my dad started
reading about time traveI...

522
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:25,111
he said it was a bigger threat
to the world than the nuclear bomb.

523
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:27,389
He's right.

524
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:29,305
That's why I joined the agency.

525
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:32,306
The world should be able to party
on Saturday night...

526
00:43:32,394 --> 00:43:35,192
and not worry whether the planet's
going to be here on Monday.

527
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:39,028
- You sound Iike a woman I knew.
- Someone remarkable, I hope.

528
00:43:39,114 --> 00:43:40,945
- Yeah.

529
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:44,310
Someone you knew, huh?
So, where is she?

530
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:46,225
She was killed.

531
00:43:46,314 --> 00:43:48,145
Sorry.

532
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:51,704
You must've thought
about going back and changing that.

533
00:43:54,274 --> 00:43:55,468
We're here.

534
00:43:57,274 --> 00:43:59,151
Huh.

535
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:14,627
I thought it was
just Parker Datalink.

536
00:44:15,634 --> 00:44:18,990
Take the back
and wait for my calI.

537
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,872
Keep your head down.
Tomorrow's your birthday.

538
00:44:43,474 --> 00:44:46,034
- I have a problem.
- You do?

539
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:48,912
Yes. Iet me tell you
what my problem is.

540
00:44:48,994 --> 00:44:51,792
This isn't working.
I can't keep paying for this.

541
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:55,867
- Hey, it doesn't matter to me.
- Oh, but it should, Jack.

542
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:58,752
You're taking the goddamn company
into bankruptcy.

543
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:00,665
We have a difference of opinion.

544
00:45:00,754 --> 00:45:03,314
The chip is the future of this company.

545
00:45:03,394 --> 00:45:07,546
- Since you don't agree, walk away.
- This isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

546
00:45:07,634 --> 00:45:10,194
Come up with money
and I'm out of here.

547
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,469
You know I can't afford it...

548
00:45:12,554 --> 00:45:17,309
but I've found an enterprising
banker with faith in the future.

549
00:45:17,394 --> 00:45:20,192
Take it.

550
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:23,391
You're out.
You've got no faith in the company...

551
00:45:23,474 --> 00:45:25,783
and I've got none in politicians.

552
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:43,306
If I were you,
l wouldn't cash that check.

553
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:46,591
It's gonna cost you
more than you'Il ever know.

554
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:51,506
Hey, Jack, it's been a while.

555
00:45:51,594 --> 00:45:54,347
- What is this?
- It's me.

556
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:57,232
Well, it's, it's him.

557
00:45:59,754 --> 00:46:01,631
No, it's us.

558
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:03,705
W-W-Where did you come from?

559
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:07,833
- Are you his father?
- Do I Iook that old?

560
00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:12,669
I'm a United States senator.
Hurting me is a federal offense.

561
00:46:12,754 --> 00:46:15,143
- I don't know about Jack's business.
- Will you stop it?

562
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:18,749
J-Just stop it.
Get a grip.

563
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:21,871
I remember having bigger balls.

564
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,872
I'm gonna have to get
this fixed. Right--

565
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:30,263
Don't touch me.

566
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,869
Same matter can't occupy
the same space.

567
00:46:33,954 --> 00:46:36,263
Same matter?

568
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:40,552
So, you got
a special N.S.A. briefing coming up.

569
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,750
Secret session.

570
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:44,825
That's not for another week.

571
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:50,352
Time travel, someone says,
gets a big Iaugh.

572
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:53,471
Oh, Christ, you're me.

573
00:46:53,554 --> 00:46:56,273
How far back have you come?

574
00:47:06,354 --> 00:47:09,152
Never interrupt me
when I'm talking to myself.

575
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:12,351
- We're gonna take them.
- What's the signaI?

576
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:18,906
You were a visionary.
The computer market was saturated.

577
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:20,985
The software stocks
were in the toilet...

578
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:24,464
and your fuckin' coldware
revolutionizes the industry.

579
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:26,749
I made a mistake.

580
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:29,906
-l came to tell you I changed my mind.
-Now.

581
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:36,591
Freeze!

582
00:47:36,674 --> 00:47:41,270
Do you realize how inappropriate
that word is? Do I Iook frozen to you?

583
00:47:41,354 --> 00:47:43,788
You Iook Iike shit to me.
Get away from him!

584
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:47,509
Move!

585
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:50,347
Drop the guns, now.

586
00:47:53,074 --> 00:47:55,986
Under your jacket there's
a track-and-return module.

587
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:57,587
Throw it to me.

588
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:03,384
You, uh, gonna
leave me back here?

589
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:07,103
Do it.

590
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:14,825
Agent Walker, I wanna see how you get
down here and keep the gun on us.

591
00:48:14,914 --> 00:48:16,870
What are you gonna do?
You gonna jump?

592
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:19,343
That's how the Vollmers
would do it.

593
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:33,625
Move back.

594
00:48:33,714 --> 00:48:36,547
Give me the envelope.

595
00:48:36,634 --> 00:48:38,511
Thank you.

596
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:41,870
The country's going down the drain
because of the special interests.

597
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:45,708
We need someone rich in the White House
who doesn't have to Iisten to anybody.

598
00:48:45,794 --> 00:48:48,991
- What's that?
- The senator was having a fund-raiser.

599
00:48:49,074 --> 00:48:51,383
When I'm in office,
it's gonna be Iike the '80s.

600
00:48:51,474 --> 00:48:56,343
Top 10%% will get richer, the rest can
emigrate to Mexico, Iive a better Iife.

601
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,584
So, you goin' or stayin'?

602
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:01,234
I think you plan too far ahead.

603
00:49:02,514 --> 00:49:04,425
Obviously, you don't.

604
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:11,629
Anything else you want
to tell me about yourself?

605
00:49:13,674 --> 00:49:16,188
Don't tell anyone I killed ya.
I'm out on baiI.

606
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:19,789
Okay, Iet's finish up
and get out of here.

607
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:22,263
He's running for president.
I'm voting early.

608
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:25,471
Good seeing you again, Jack.

609
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:30,750
Maybe he'Il calm down
after the election.

610
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,632
What's the big deaI?

611
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:36,023
Point it, pull the trigger...

612
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:38,264
and, boom, somebody dies.

613
00:49:48,634 --> 00:49:50,545
Get up there!
Get the module!

614
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:14,543
Fuckin' great!
Will you get him?

615
00:50:14,634 --> 00:50:15,749
Goddamn it.

616
00:50:34,154 --> 00:50:36,429
Oh!

617
00:51:45,874 --> 00:51:48,786
Aaron!

618
00:51:49,994 --> 00:51:51,825
Come here.

619
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:55,905
You own the company,
do you understand?

620
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:59,828
The chip is going to be worth billions,
my billions.

621
00:51:59,914 --> 00:52:02,747
Now, read this.
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

622
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:05,632
You just read it
and do what it says.

623
00:52:05,714 --> 00:52:07,545
Now, you get out of here.

624
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:11,863
Oh. And will you do me a favor?

625
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:14,991
Will you Iay off
the fuckin' candy bars?

626
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:26,423
Have a nice day.

627
00:53:53,394 --> 00:53:57,148
- I should've said, "Freeze."
- I think he got the idea.

628
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,431
Do me a favor.
Don't give up without a fight.

629
00:54:00,514 --> 00:54:02,232
Never crossed my mind.

630
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:07,233
I don't want
to fight a woman.

631
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:10,192
Then don't.

632
00:54:17,194 --> 00:54:19,025
Changed my mind.

633
00:54:21,874 --> 00:54:24,149
Tell me he's gonna
kill your family.

634
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:29,548
- Don't you Ieave me, damn it!
- Who are you talking to?

635
00:54:39,354 --> 00:54:41,549
Stay here, Walker.

636
00:54:41,634 --> 00:54:44,148
In my future, you're dead.

637
00:55:07,914 --> 00:55:10,144
Iook at this!

638
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:14,308
Iet's get a canine unit
up there.

639
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:36,352
- What the helI's going on here?
- You're Iucky you got back.

640
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:39,232
They're gettin' ready
to tear up these tracks.

641
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:41,623
- McComb?
- Who else?

642
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:44,069
- He hasn't got the power.
- Are you kiddin'?

643
00:55:44,154 --> 00:55:48,272
He's ahead in the polls. He's probably
out buying running shoes for his team.

644
00:55:48,354 --> 00:55:53,189
Senate committee caved in. They want
to be on the good side of the new boss.

645
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:58,149
What's the matter?
It's been headed this way for months.

646
00:55:58,234 --> 00:56:00,065
When I Ieft,
nothing had happened.

647
00:56:00,154 --> 00:56:03,385
Hey, Walker, when they tear up the
launcher, you get the pod as a memento.

648
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:05,305
He's changed the future.

649
00:56:05,394 --> 00:56:07,225
What are you talking about?

650
00:56:07,314 --> 00:56:11,102
McComb.
He's buying the presidency.

651
00:56:11,194 --> 00:56:14,027
What's new?
It's been done before.

652
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:15,945
- The guy is a killer.
- Doesn't surprise me.

653
00:56:16,034 --> 00:56:18,104
- He killed my agency.
- He shot two people.

654
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:22,506
- Who?
- Who? A guy named Parker and Fielding.

655
00:56:23,674 --> 00:56:25,824
- Do I know them?
- Fielding was with me.

656
00:56:25,914 --> 00:56:28,712
- You sent her.
- I don't Iike this guy one bit...

657
00:56:28,794 --> 00:56:34,152
but just who can I sell this story to
without 50 eyewitnesses?

658
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,304
- How about one?
- You don't count.

659
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,147
There's a chance she's still alive.

660
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,873
- Who?
- Fielding. The cops were there.

661
00:56:42,954 --> 00:56:44,865
I'm gonna be Iooking
for a new government job.

662
00:56:44,954 --> 00:56:46,865
I don't think it will
help my chances...

663
00:56:46,954 --> 00:56:49,593
if I'm the guy that tried to put
our next president in jaiI.

664
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:52,711
- You think I'm making this up?
- Forget it! You're not going back!

665
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:54,944
If she's alive, we've got him.

666
00:56:55,034 --> 00:56:56,865
You understand that?
We've got the guy.

667
00:56:56,954 --> 00:56:59,422
We're shut down.
Take a Iook around. We're history.

668
00:56:59,514 --> 00:57:01,789
Wait, I'm gonna
show you something.

669
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:05,184
You come with me.

670
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:08,311
Those files are supposed to be sealed.
I don't know why I'm doing this.

671
00:57:08,394 --> 00:57:10,385
You say you were my best friend?

672
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:13,511
- For a Iong time.
- I Iiked you?

673
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:17,473
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you Iooking for?

674
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:21,467
Fielding's friends or family;
anyone she would go to in 1994.

675
00:57:21,554 --> 00:57:24,944
- Who was she?
- I.A., but she had a deal with McComb.

676
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:28,265
He's got to go back
to be sure she's dead.

677
00:57:29,874 --> 00:57:32,547
Since you say
we were close friends...

678
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:35,831
I'm gonna ask you a question
the prison psychiatrist will ask you.

679
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:37,905
How's our Ieading
presidential candidate...

680
00:57:37,994 --> 00:57:41,589
making these expeditions into the past
without our equipment, old paI?

681
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:45,906
The prototype was never dismantled.

682
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:49,987
Kleindast's.
It's in Calverton, Maryland.

683
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:53,588
Short drive from Washington.

684
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:57,110
We have no authority
to get in there.

685
00:57:57,194 --> 00:57:59,583
What about Ricky?

686
00:58:01,714 --> 00:58:05,104
If you were my best friend,
you wouldn't do this to me.

687
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:09,870
I would have had him killed
right here, but if he's back...

688
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:13,742
he's already told the story to Matuzak.
God knows who else.

689
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:17,668
They won't get it, but they'Il sure
give it thought if he comes up dead.

690
00:58:17,754 --> 00:58:20,552
- Right.
- He'Il have to be erased.

691
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:21,623
Erased.

692
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:25,343
Have him killed
before he joined T.E.C.

693
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:28,107
That way nobody in the Agency
ever talked to him or even knew him.

694
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:32,710
-Perfect.
-lt's not perfect. It's all we've got.

695
00:58:32,794 --> 00:58:34,625
Don't expect to be
my chief of staff...

696
00:58:34,714 --> 00:58:36,545
if slamming you
into the side of the car...

697
00:58:36,634 --> 00:58:38,670
turns you into a sniveling worm.

698
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:45,545
Well, what do you know?

699
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:49,388
At random intervals, Maryland Utilities
shows spikes in demand and duration...

700
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:52,432
- that are almost identical to ours.
- Send me back.

701
00:58:52,514 --> 00:58:54,982
- No, they won't Iet us do that.
- Stay out of it, Ricky.

702
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:57,065
Would it be too much trouble
to call me Richard?

703
00:58:57,154 --> 00:58:59,952
Richard, do I have
a best friend around here?

704
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:02,946
It isn't me.
Maybe Gordon.

705
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:04,990
Gordon is a putz. I can tell you
who my best friend was...

706
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,905
in school, in the marines,
when I was a cop.

707
00:59:06,994 --> 00:59:08,825
Gordon doesn't fit.
I'm not saying you do...

708
00:59:08,914 --> 00:59:11,223
but since I'd Iike to see McComb take a
fall, you get the benefit of the doubt.

709
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,112
- Whoa! Where you goin'?
- We've got to vent the fuel shunts.

710
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:16,867
Oh, is that right? You'Il have
to wait while I get authori--

711
00:59:21,674 --> 00:59:24,063
Was I your only friend?

712
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:30,273
A Iaunch is not
a one-man operation.

713
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:32,185
Yeah, I know.

714
00:59:32,274 --> 00:59:35,232
If I'm off on velocity or trajectory,
you're gonna be an omelette.

715
00:59:35,314 --> 00:59:37,270
- You trying to scare me?
- Yeah.

716
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:40,983
- Just hit the right year.
- I'Il see ya.

717
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:45,192
I've had your wife's goulash
a hundred times; always too much salt.

718
00:59:51,474 --> 00:59:53,351
Here goes the pension.

719
00:59:55,954 --> 00:59:58,229
Emergency Iaunch system
on-line warning.

720
00:59:58,314 --> 01:00:01,829
Emergency Iaunch system
on-line warning.

721
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:09,103
Manual Iaunch
initiation alert.

722
01:00:09,194 --> 01:00:12,425
Manual Iaunch
initiation alert.

723
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:16,628
Shut it down! Now!

724
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:21,151
Telemetry on-line.
Ignition firing on-line.

725
01:00:21,234 --> 01:00:24,032
- Iaunch now on hold for--
- Iast chance!

726
01:00:24,114 --> 01:00:25,991
Iaunch is now--

727
01:00:27,354 --> 01:00:29,345
- Iaunch now on hold--

728
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:31,345
Damn it!

729
01:00:56,394 --> 01:00:59,431
Get me the police mainframe computer.

730
01:00:59,514 --> 01:01:03,507
I want all Jane Does admitted
to Iocal hospitals on October 9.

731
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:08,224
Check if any of the Jane Does
are victims of multiple gunshot wounds.

732
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:17,185
Gotcha.

733
01:01:38,554 --> 01:01:42,786
Dr. Iemon, call Iine one-five.

734
01:01:42,874 --> 01:01:45,672
Dr. Iemon, call Iine one-five.

735
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,669
Police. Jane Doe.

736
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:07,386
Happy birthday.

737
01:02:12,874 --> 01:02:15,991
Thanks.
Get me anything?

738
01:02:16,074 --> 01:02:18,872
- Tell me what you want.
- I want to go home.

739
01:02:18,954 --> 01:02:22,390
I already know who's gonna
win the next ten World Series.

740
01:02:22,474 --> 01:02:26,387
- No problem.
- Why'd you come back?

741
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:29,113
I need you to testify
against McComb.

742
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:33,426
Mmm.
That would be my pleasure.

743
01:02:33,514 --> 01:02:35,744
- It could be dangerous.
- I know that.

744
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:38,223
It's not that simple.
McComb has made some changes.

745
01:02:38,314 --> 01:02:42,546
- You were never in the T.E.C.
- No, that can't be.

746
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,864
I had the training for six years.

747
01:02:44,954 --> 01:02:47,024
- I have friends.
- I've got to move fast.

748
01:02:47,114 --> 01:02:50,709
If I can find you, so can he.

749
01:02:50,794 --> 01:02:52,785
What can I do?

750
01:02:52,874 --> 01:02:56,264
I need proof
that you existed here.

751
01:02:56,354 --> 01:03:00,313
In case I don't
make the trip, huh?

752
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:02,669
They just took some blood.

753
01:03:02,754 --> 01:03:04,665
It would be in the Iab.

754
01:03:04,754 --> 01:03:08,064
- I'Il be right back.
- Hey.

755
01:03:09,514 --> 01:03:12,984
- I really screwed up.
- Yes, you did.

756
01:03:13,074 --> 01:03:15,144
I want to make things right.

757
01:03:16,874 --> 01:03:20,708
You may find you can make
things right for yourself.

758
01:03:24,194 --> 01:03:26,708
I'Il be right back.

759
01:03:26,794 --> 01:03:31,310
Wheelchair to Admitting,
please. Wheelchair to Admitting.

760
01:03:32,674 --> 01:03:35,632
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

761
01:03:35,714 --> 01:03:38,672
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

762
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:42,502
Nurse Remington,
report to main desk.

763
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:45,552
Nurse Remington,
report to the main desk.

764
01:04:30,674 --> 01:04:32,551
Melissa.

765
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:37,750
I'm gonna take you
to someplace safe.

766
01:04:47,794 --> 01:04:51,753
What are you doing?

767
01:04:55,594 --> 01:04:58,062
Help! Security!

768
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:15,789
Help! Security!
Somebody call security!

769
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,823
Help!

770
01:05:22,634 --> 01:05:25,102
Security!
Call security!

771
01:05:25,194 --> 01:05:27,947
Hey! Hold it!
Don't move!

772
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,070
Pictures bring back
your memories.

773
01:06:16,874 --> 01:06:19,513
- This is for what you're going to do.
- Hey, wha--

774
01:06:19,594 --> 01:06:23,109
- What the--

775
01:06:34,634 --> 01:06:37,432
- Melissa... don't turn around.
- Why? What's wrong?

776
01:06:37,514 --> 01:06:39,505
It's okay.

777
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:42,552
- Iisten. Iisten.
- Who are you?

778
01:06:42,634 --> 01:06:45,751
It's me. Iook.
It's Max.

779
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,473
Max? Max, what happened?

780
01:06:48,554 --> 01:06:51,671
I can't tell you right now.
We have to go.

781
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:53,665
Trust me.

782
01:06:53,754 --> 01:06:55,790
Trust me.

783
01:07:00,754 --> 01:07:02,631
Come on.

784
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,985
Iet's go.

785
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:13,994
Here! Here!

786
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:20,589
Please! Just tell me
what happened to you!

787
01:07:21,714 --> 01:07:24,706
Just try to believe me.
I Iove you.

788
01:07:24,794 --> 01:07:26,864
Trust me.

789
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:57,271
- You're not Max.
- It's me.

790
01:07:57,354 --> 01:07:59,231
Ten years from now,
it's me.

791
01:07:59,314 --> 01:08:01,270
- That's not possible.
- Remember:

792
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:05,950
- Matuzak, the new job, time traveI.
- Time traveI?

793
01:08:06,034 --> 01:08:10,391
If one day I need a birdhouse built,
l know who to talk to.

794
01:08:10,474 --> 01:08:13,830
- Oh, my god.
- It's me. It's Max.

795
01:08:13,914 --> 01:08:18,305
- I can't believe this.
- Try.

796
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:23,344
What am I Iike
ten years from now?

797
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:26,232
Just Iike now.

798
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:29,272
Perfect.

799
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:34,872
You time traveled,
and what? Why?

800
01:08:34,954 --> 01:08:37,707
Iet me show you.

801
01:08:50,754 --> 01:08:54,303
Today you have something
very special to tell him.

802
01:08:56,354 --> 01:09:00,063
- How do you know that?
- I've just told you.

803
01:09:00,154 --> 01:09:02,509
What are you here to prevent?

804
01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:05,392
Changes in the past.

805
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,908
Why? What's gonna happen?

806
01:09:07,994 --> 01:09:11,430
Iater. Stay and meet with him.

807
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,505
Don't tell him
anything, please.

808
01:10:00,794 --> 01:10:04,070
There's never enough time.

809
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:08,983
Never enough for what?

810
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,872
To satisfy a woman.

811
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:14,422
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

812
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:17,551
- Are you busy?
- I'm meeting my husband.

813
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:30,904
Senator McComb!
Sir!

814
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:34,703
That message came
from the senate operator, sir.

815
01:10:34,794 --> 01:10:38,230
- It's 3:30. You have a 4:00 with--
- Clear my schedule.

816
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:41,272
- All of it.
- Yes, sir.

817
01:10:41,354 --> 01:10:45,108
Kelly, have you ever been
inside the president's Iimo?

818
01:10:45,194 --> 01:10:47,025
No, sir.

819
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:49,264
You keep in touch.

820
01:10:49,354 --> 01:10:51,345
I'Il send you a photograph of it.

821
01:11:06,354 --> 01:11:09,426
I have something I want to tell you.

822
01:11:09,514 --> 01:11:12,312
- Oh, shit.
- Don't answer it.

823
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:16,785
I have to.

824
01:11:23,474 --> 01:11:27,183
- Did not tell him?
- He didn't give me a chance.

825
01:11:27,274 --> 01:11:31,028
You should have tried.

826
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:38,064
Are we still together
in ten years?

827
01:11:38,154 --> 01:11:40,714
Yes, we're together.

828
01:11:40,794 --> 01:11:44,867
- Do you have a picture?
- No, nothing recent.

829
01:11:44,954 --> 01:11:49,106
- Am I dead?
- No. You're not dead.

830
01:11:49,194 --> 01:11:51,105
What about tomorrow?

831
01:11:51,194 --> 01:11:53,833
Everything is going
to be fine, okay?

832
01:11:53,914 --> 01:11:58,146
Why can't we just get out? Why can't we
just run away from whatever it is?

833
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:01,192
It would come back
as many times as it takes.

834
01:12:01,274 --> 01:12:03,151
It has to end tonight.

835
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:06,947
Hurry!
Keep him upstairs.

836
01:12:07,034 --> 01:12:09,992
Whatever you do,
keep him upstairs.

837
01:12:10,074 --> 01:12:13,225
Just do what I say.
Please! Go!

838
01:12:24,794 --> 01:12:27,388
Max, I don't want you to go.

839
01:12:27,474 --> 01:12:29,908
I'Il be back soon.

840
01:12:29,994 --> 01:12:33,304
I-- I'm pregnant.

841
01:12:33,394 --> 01:12:37,023
- Great.
- I Iove you.

842
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:55,903
- Surprise.
- Who the fuck are you?

843
01:12:55,994 --> 01:12:58,952
Friend of the family.

844
01:12:59,034 --> 01:13:00,433
Don't go down!

845
01:13:24,074 --> 01:13:26,872
Upstairs.

846
01:13:26,954 --> 01:13:28,751
- How did you miss him?
- He knew it was comin'.

847
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:30,426
It was a T.E.C. cop.

848
01:13:30,514 --> 01:13:32,550
Son of a bitch
doesn't know how to die.

849
01:13:32,634 --> 01:13:34,033
He'Il Iearn tonight.

850
01:13:34,114 --> 01:13:36,582
You don't kill him,
you don't go back.

851
01:13:41,794 --> 01:13:43,785
Upstairs.

852
01:16:15,114 --> 01:16:17,070
Max.

853
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:22,394
Oh, my god, Max.
Iook out!

854
01:16:59,754 --> 01:17:02,791
You have nothing soft
to Iand on, do you?

855
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,463
Go! Go!

856
01:17:44,554 --> 01:17:46,465
- I'Il get help!
- Go!

857
01:18:54,794 --> 01:18:56,785
Say, "Ah."

858
01:19:19,234 --> 01:19:20,747
Oh, shit.

859
01:19:21,874 --> 01:19:24,547
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

860
01:20:09,314 --> 01:20:11,191
Iousy night to be out.

861
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:13,629
Don't hurt her.

862
01:20:13,714 --> 01:20:17,104
You were at a disadvantage
in this from the beginning.

863
01:20:17,194 --> 01:20:19,424
I'm an ambitious
Harvard-educated visionary...

864
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:21,903
who deserves to be
the most powerful man in the world...

865
01:20:21,994 --> 01:20:25,145
and you, you're a fuckin' idiot
who never figured out...

866
01:20:25,234 --> 01:20:28,783
that the only way to make anything of
all that fancy kicking is on Broadway.

867
01:20:28,874 --> 01:20:30,512
Thanks for clearing that up.

868
01:20:30,594 --> 01:20:32,471
The polls have me winning
by 28 points.

869
01:20:32,554 --> 01:20:35,193
That's the biggest Iandslide
since Nixon back in '72.

870
01:20:35,274 --> 01:20:39,233
I find it reassuring to know
what the future holds, don't you?

871
01:20:39,314 --> 01:20:41,305
That's C-4.

872
01:20:41,394 --> 01:20:45,945
It'Il turn this house into dust
and also separate every part of you...

873
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:49,026
- from every other part of you.
- Iet her go. You've got me.

874
01:20:49,114 --> 01:20:52,504
I don't want you.
Agent Walker is too visible.

875
01:20:52,594 --> 01:20:57,748
But Officer Walker, dead,
is just another D.C. statistic.

876
01:20:57,834 --> 01:21:00,951
When he's gone,
you're gone.

877
01:21:01,034 --> 01:21:02,865
Get the younger one.
I want him to see this.

878
01:21:02,954 --> 01:21:04,945
- He's dead.
- No, he's not, you moron.

879
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:07,832
If he were dead,
he would not be here. Get him.

880
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:10,951
Iet her go!

881
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:19,591
- What do you want?
- You're a bright boy.

882
01:22:19,674 --> 01:22:21,824
Why don't you sleep on it?

883
01:22:21,914 --> 01:22:23,825
I did that.

884
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:03,343
It's different
than before, isn't it?

885
01:23:03,434 --> 01:23:05,186
It's what happens
when you change time.

886
01:23:05,274 --> 01:23:08,949
Iines of confluence,
probability scales, all that shit.

887
01:23:10,514 --> 01:23:13,472
Put your gun
on the floor.

888
01:23:13,554 --> 01:23:16,512
What were you gonna do? Shoot me?

889
01:23:18,474 --> 01:23:21,591
A bomb is gonna go off any second now.
You know what happens then?

890
01:23:21,674 --> 01:23:24,791
We're all gonna be dead.
I'm gonna win by default.

891
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:26,990
My young self
is still gonna be president...

892
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:28,507
and you can't save your wife.

893
01:23:28,594 --> 01:23:31,028
Just Iike you couldn't
save her once before.

894
01:23:31,114 --> 01:23:33,582
She died because you came back
and made some changes.

895
01:23:33,674 --> 01:23:35,983
Now you're gonna
fuck with time.

896
01:23:36,074 --> 01:23:40,067
- You're as bad as me.
- Wrong. I'm setting it right.

897
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:43,824
Usually I hate doing things
more than once...

898
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:45,984
but in this case,
l don't see any other option.

899
01:23:46,074 --> 01:23:48,304
I do.

900
01:23:51,594 --> 01:23:53,027
What the fuck are you doing here?

901
01:23:53,114 --> 01:23:55,674
You called me. You Ieft a message
with the senate operator.

902
01:23:55,754 --> 01:23:58,746
I didn't Ieave any message,
you fucking idiot!

903
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:00,950
Don't argue among yourself.
I Ieft it.

904
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:04,468
Now nobody's got a future.

905
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:07,512
Okay.
This is a real mess now.

906
01:24:07,594 --> 01:24:09,710
I hope you're happy.
This is a real mess.

907
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:12,433
You turned a simple, ordinary murder
into a bloodbath.

908
01:24:15,754 --> 01:24:18,473
You get out of here. Get out of here.
Go! Now! Go!

909
01:24:22,634 --> 01:24:25,592
- You two should be closer.
- Keep him away from me.

910
01:24:25,674 --> 01:24:27,505
The same matter
can't occupy the same space.

911
01:24:27,594 --> 01:24:31,030
I'm still kicking.
I must be on Broadway.

912
01:24:31,114 --> 01:24:33,070
No!

913
01:26:11,634 --> 01:26:16,025
Coordinates downloaded
to G.P.S. sequencer.

914
01:26:16,114 --> 01:26:18,105
Re-entry sequence
is completed.

915
01:26:18,194 --> 01:26:22,153
Iaunch bay alert
is now terminated.

916
01:26:47,154 --> 01:26:49,714
Hey, where you goin'?

917
01:26:51,114 --> 01:26:54,390
- What happened to you?
- What are you talkin' about?

918
01:26:54,474 --> 01:26:56,465
You're walking around.

919
01:26:56,554 --> 01:27:01,423
I've been doing that since I was
about two. Does that seem abnormaI?

920
01:27:01,514 --> 01:27:05,268
I--

921
01:27:07,034 --> 01:27:11,186
- What's going on with Senator McComb?
- Senator McComb?

922
01:27:11,274 --> 01:27:14,391
If you want time off, ask. Don't act
