because the future hasn't happened yet.

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,339
However, you can go back,
and that's where things get real tricky.

44
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,419
Turns out, if you go back
and change something, it's serious.

45
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,429
It could be catastrophic.
Like throwing a stone in a lake...

Only, they're ripples in time.

So you can't go back and kill Hitler,
much as we'd all like to...

48

a chain reaction of events...

or even destroy mankind.

And that, my good senators,
is where you come in.

51

We have to form
a brand-new covert agency...

52
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,529
to police this technology
and to actually protect time.

53

It's gonna be called the Time Enforcement
Commission, or the T.E.C.

- How much is a lot?

More than a little and less than too much.

of the American economy?

finances a trip back to 1944.

the first country to have the atomic bomb.

- Not bad.

already been a ripple. Ten days ago.

terrorists in Hamburg, Germany.

68
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,369
That's happened before, so that news
doesn't come across the president's desk.

69
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,209
What made this one different is that
the purchase was made with gold bullion.

70
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,999
And the gold bullion was dated 1863
and stamped:

71
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,009
Property of the Confederate States
of America.

72
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,889
We had it carbon tested
and authenticated, and it's real.
