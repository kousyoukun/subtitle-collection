1
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:38,077
No, I can't, okay?
I have to finish this report.

2
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:39,997
You can take a couple hours off.

3
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:43,117
I know it's Sunday, Jeff,
but I'm evaluating a shipping company...

4
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:45,997
for this client from Barcelona,
and he's flying in tomorrow.

5
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:48,517
No, I'm not gonna change my mind.

6
00:01:48,597 --> 00:01:50,997
- I'll give you a back rub.
- No!

7
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,877
Okay, you win.

8
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:56,397
- We'll do it over the phone.
-Jeff, don't do this to me.

9
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:58,837
- What are you wearing?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

10
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,677
Besides a thong and--

11
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:43,357
- Maribel, come here.
- Yeah?

12
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:47,357
I have a boyfriend emergency.
See that guy waiting for me?

13
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:49,877
The boy from Ipanema over there.

14
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:52,037
You wanna bail on him? He's a babe!

15
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:56,597
Please? Tell him I stayed home sick.
Spence is taking me sailing.

16
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:00,677
Come on. I'll owe you.

17
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,477
Come on in.

18
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,197
What do you think?
I took the red out.

19
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,957
It's great! Yolanda,
it makes you look younger.

20
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:43,157
Younger? Really?

21
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:45,837
Are you almost done?
Because I don't want to be late.

22
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,437
How was church?

23
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:50,837
How was church?
Anyone interesting?

24
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,917
Yolanda, church is not a pickup bar.

25
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:55,917
I'm not Catholic anymore, remember?

26
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:59,717
I remember your dad trying
to understand the difference.

27
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:03,637
Catholics worship saints,
Christians worship Christ.

28
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:07,397
Christ was a Christian, not Catholic.

29
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:09,317
- Honey, Christ was a Jew.
- Really?

30
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:11,717
Yeah, and he had great hair.

31
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:15,477
Speaking of which, why don't we do
something different with your hair?

32
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:17,517
Me? No, I don't think so.

33
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:21,717
We could snip it about here,
but the bangs need to grow.

34
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:23,637
It would accentuate your eyes.

35
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:27,197
What are you doing? I don't want
to do anything with my hair.

36
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:29,237
Are you gonna come, or what?

37
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,797
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

38
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:34,117
Tell your dad
I'm bringing April over.

39
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,277
Jeff, I don't know
if this is working.

40
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:56,557
Baby, it's working, believe me.

41
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,517
I don't think it's strong enough.

42
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:02,917
Believe me, Carmen.
Trust me on this, it's strong enough.

43
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:05,957
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

44
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:08,677
- Is that an earthquake?
- What was that?

45
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:15,157
- Great chair, Jeff.
- I told you it wasn't strong enough.

46
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:19,637
You did not say that.

47
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:26,597
You don't miss it,
us being a couple?

48
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,357
We sucked as a couple.

49
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:32,797
I liked us as a couple.

50
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:44,557
Shit! I didn't realize
it was so late. I gotta go.

51
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,477
Jeff, let me up.

52
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:10,437
Hey, music store girl.
You know someone named Eden?

53
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:17,157
Yeah.
I'm gonna give it to you straight.

54
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:19,437
Eden skipped out the back door
with some Ken doll.

55
00:06:19,517 --> 00:06:23,757
Who is "Ken doll"?
I don't understand.

56
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:27,117
Oh, you're not from
this solar system, are you?

57
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:29,637
She stood you up.
That means--

58
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:32,077
Yeah, I know what that means.

59
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:35,757
It's known to happen
in my solar system as well.

60
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:40,437
Which, I gather from the music
you're listening to, is Brazil?

61
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:42,677
You know Brazilian music?

62
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:48,037
That's Bebel Gilberto's composition,
"Sem Contencao"...

63
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:50,157
recorded in 1999.

64
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:53,037
Released on Six Degrees Records...

65
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:57,917
and originally inspired by the legendary
bossa nova artist, Joao Gilberto...

66
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:01,157
who happens to be her father.

67
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:03,117
Wait!

68
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:07,317
- Have a coffee with me.
- I can't. I'm late for dinner.

69
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:11,917
According to the theory of relativity,
time doesn't exist as we know it.

70
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:14,757
Yeah, but my father does.

71
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:18,437
So you're going
to stand me up as well?

72
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:22,637
- No. We didn't have a date.
- How do you know?

73
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:27,637
Maybe this all happened for a purpose.
Maybe you had a date with destiny.

74
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:30,637
Come on. There's a coffee shop
right across the street.

75
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:38,677
Does my destiny have a name?

76
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,637
Andre. But you can call me Andy.

77
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,917
How long are we gonna wait
this time?

78
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,037
Maybe she got stuck in traffic.

79
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:38,117
Maybe she got stuck in traffic.

80
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:40,397
Tu sabes que Maribel
walks home from work.

81
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:44,197
English or Spanish,
one or the other.

82
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:54,397
All right. Soup isn't meant
to be served cold.

83
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:55,877
Leticia.

84
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:02,517
Dear Lord, thank you
for the blessings of your bounty.

85
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:06,517
And help us, dearJesus,
to commit ourselves wholeheartedly...

86
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:09,837
to the service of your name.

87
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,997
Be our guide, Lord Jesus Christ,
and show us your will.

88
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:16,397
Grant us the privilege of dwelling
in the bosom of your love...

89
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:19,997
for now and for all eternity.

90
00:09:21,797 --> 00:09:23,157
Amen?

91
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,957
Something wrong?

92
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:41,757
No, it's fine.

93
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:44,437
- What is it?
- She said it was fine.

94
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,357
I don't know.
I think something's missing.

95
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:50,437
Serranos.

96
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:53,357
No, I put serranos in.

97
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:55,397
But you removed the seeds.

98
00:09:56,397 --> 00:10:00,277
You would add seeds.
I respect tradition.

99
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,997
You made it better before, Pa.

100
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:05,197
I always make squash flower soup
this way.

101
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,237
He's getting worse.
He can't taste anything.

102
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,157
So? Do you have to rub it in?

103
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:15,437
- Hello?
- Mari, where the hell are you? Sorry.

104
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:20,237
I'm here already! Give me a break.
Jesus Christ! Sorry, Leti.

105
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:23,717
- Do you know what time it is?
- Gonna wash my hands.

106
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:27,997
I know, I know.
You don't have to say it.

107
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:32,037
- Perdoname, Daddy.
- Please cut the "Spanglish."

108
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:34,597
I may have met my destiny today.

109
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,917
- I thought you were mad at her.
- Mind your own business.

110
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:40,517
- When are you gonna grow up?
- When everybody gets off my back.

111
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:44,757
This is not how we behave for dinner.
We honor dinner.

112
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:47,637
We have good manners,
and we have pleasant conversation.

113
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:51,237
Well, I have a little announcement.

114
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:58,117
You know the new luxury condos
going up in Playa del Rey?

115
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:01,877
A friend of mine who works
for the developer gave me a tip...

116
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:04,757
and I was able
to get my bid in early.

117
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:10,277
- You're moving out?
- Not immediately.

118
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:12,397
It's still under construction.

119
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,477
Does it have a pool?
Can I come on weekends?

120
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:17,317
Dad, aren't you gonna say anything?

121
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:21,677
- You need a loan for the down payment?
- I'm covered. I used my savings.

122
00:11:21,717 --> 00:11:23,877
What about the mortgage?

123
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:27,717
My agent handled everything,
and I even got him to eat half his fee.

124
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:30,757
I understand.

125
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:34,597
If you wanted my advice, you would've
asked me before making the decision.

126
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:39,397
I'm sorry, Dad, but you
would've told me not to do it.

127
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:48,437
- I can't digest my food.
- You did last week.

128
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:56,357
- Hey!
- Hi! Here she is.

129
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:00,037
- Sorry for disturbing dinner.
- Hi, Yoli.

130
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:02,277
You didn't miss anything unusual.

131
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,757
Just the two Aries butting heads.

132
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,197
Get her a chair.

133
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:10,237
Here we go. Try this.

134
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,237
What is it?

135
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:15,797
Nopales. I think
you're going to like it.

136
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:22,677
Go figure! I can't get her to finish her
cereal, and you get her to eat cactus.

137
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,517
Cactus?

138
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:26,037
Cool!

139
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:29,517
Excuse me.

140
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:32,877
- Soup?
- No, I'm not staying. Oh, that's me.

141
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:37,477
- Hello?
- Yolanda, where on earth are you?

142
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,437
It's my mom.
I guess her flight arrived early.

143
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:41,677
- I was on my way.
- How could you leave me stranded?

144
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:45,557
- There's nothing I can do!
- But it's Sunday. It's dinnertime.

145
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:48,317
The governor's dessert is burned up.
We need your help.

146
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:51,117
All right, I'll come by if I have to.

147
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:54,477
- If you're not here in five minutes--
- She thinks she belongs at the hearing.

148
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:58,357
A single woman living with her mother.
Looks better?

149
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:01,197
- Here you go.
- Oh, April.

150
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:04,237
I gotta go. Thanks for baby-sitting.

151
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,797
My pleasure.
We're gonna have fun, right?

152
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:09,157
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

153
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,717
- See you. Bye.
- Good night. Bye-bye.

154
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:14,597
I've got to put out a fire.

155
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:16,917
What happened
to "We honor dinnertime"?

156
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,437
Did you hear? Yolanda's mom
is moving into the neighborhood.

157
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:26,197
There's candied pumpkin
in the kitchen for your ice cream.

158
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:28,157
Okay, bye-bye.

159
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:35,077
What?

160
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:42,377
This way, sir, over here.

161
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:43,557
This way, sir, over here.

162
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:45,477
Catering.

163
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:58,597
- Apron.
- He's here!

164
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,757
Toque.

165
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:03,037
Martin!
I'm here.

166
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:07,117
They have burned the dessert.
They burned all of it.

167
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,677
I told them put the oven
at 325 degrees...

168
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:11,677
and they put it
at 425 degrees.

169
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,197
Not even one survived!

170
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:17,117
Should we fire them?

171
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:22,157
No, they'll never do it again.
Don't fire them.

172
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:28,557
Tony, the apples are still moist.

173
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:31,237
- How many bread loaves do we have?
- We got plenty of loaves.

174
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,037
Remove the bread crusts
and save the apples.

175
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:38,357
Cut the baguettes into cubes, coat them
with melted butter and bake them.

176
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:40,677
I'll prepare the sugar syrup.

177
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:45,957
We'll call it something French.

178
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,477
I want every little piece
of burned crust out of there.

179
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:56,997
I don't want to see one.

180
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:43,357
- Belle melange?
- It means "a lovely mess."

181
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:48,117
That's perfect
for this Hollywood crowd.

182
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:57,437
Leti, you have papers to grade.
Why don't you let me and Maribel finish?

183
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,597
How long you gonna give me
the silent treatment?

184
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:10,957
I don't know what you expected.
We are three grown women.

185
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:16,917
Okay, make that two grown women,
living at home with their daddy.

186
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:20,877
That might have worked in Mexico, but
he doesn't realize things are different.

187
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:23,557
He needs to meet someone.
He's been alone for too long.

188
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:25,517
He only had one true love
in his life.

189
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:29,237
- All they did was bicker and fight.
- That's how they loved each other.

190
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,437
Please!

191
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:34,517
- What do you remember? You were what?
- I was old enough to know.

192
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:38,277
Anyway, I have to get out.
And so do you.

193
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:42,117
When will you get it through your head
that I choose to live my life this way?

194
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:44,077
Por favor, you are lying to yourself.

195
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:47,797
Okay! Somebody has to care
what happens to Dad.

196
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:50,717
I care, okay? I care very much
what happens to him...

197
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:53,277
but I won't use that as an excuse
not to live my life.

198
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,357
All you think about is you.

199
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:57,317
Stop pretending you're mad at me.

200
00:16:57,357 --> 00:17:00,117
You're mad because Carlos
showed you the door a decade ago.

201
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,277
At least I don't sleep
with every guy I meet.

202
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:16,037
Don't make me out to be a slut just
because I've had sex in this decade.

203
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,157
Why don't you wake up
and get a life?

204
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,037
- I have a life.
- "I have a life."

205
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:25,357
You should've stayed Catholic and joined
a convent for all the fun you have.

206
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:29,637
- You're aggravating her colitis.
- What is wrong now?

207
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:31,877
Why do you always do that?

208
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:34,917
- Do what?
- Dismiss me like I don't exist.

209
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:37,197
It is not just you.
She does it to everybody.

210
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:39,477
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb, Carmen.

211
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:43,277
You can be a real bitch when you want.
No wonder you don't have friends.

212
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:48,197
What do you know? You can't even
show up on time for dinner.

213
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:51,077
Oh, please! Why should I
when it always ends up like this?

214
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:56,477
I can't take it anymore!

215
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,397
Is that a promise or a threat?

216
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:03,437
Jesus, you're pathetic.
Give it to me!

217
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:07,917
Oh, my--
Are you crazy?

218
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,477
So fun!

219
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:14,797
No wonder the Greeks do it.
And they sing and dance. Let's try that!

220
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:16,357
Maribel, wait.

221
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:18,957
You won't admit you love me

222
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:22,837
And so how am I

223
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,317
To know

224
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,477
You only tell me

225
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,797
Perhaps, perhaps

226
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:31,437
Perhaps

227
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,997
A million times I ask you
and then

228
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,797
I asked you over again

229
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:46,757
You only answer

230
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,437
So if you really love me
say yes

231
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:23,557
But if you don't, dear, confess

232
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,637
And please don't tell me

233
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:26,637
In Spanglish!

234
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:29,637
Perhaps, quizas, perhaps

235
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:39,877
I just don't get it.

236
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,837
My three get the best of everything.

237
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,357
The only thanks I get is a daughter...

238
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:47,677
who spends her last dime
on a cookie-cutter condo.

239
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:49,117
For what?

240
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:52,157
So it's not the moving part
that bothers you?

241
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:56,237
I want them to move out.
I want them to get their own lives.

242
00:19:57,677 --> 00:20:01,837
You just wish that they would ask
for your advice?

243
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,917
So, what's wrong with that?

244
00:20:03,997 --> 00:20:05,837
Nothing, nothing. But--

245
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:09,917
I mean, since you were the one
who pushed her to get her MBA...

246
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:12,997
I think you should trust that
she knows what she is doing.

247
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:17,357
I didn't push her. Besides,
I thought it was for her own good.

248
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:22,077
Anyway, I think the one that's going
to give you a lot of trouble...

249
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:24,357
is that old maid Leticia.

250
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,757
She's gonna stick it to you
for the rest of your life.

251
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:29,797
- Now she's got the perfect boyfriend.
- Who?

252
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,677
Jesus Christ.

253
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:41,837
But without them, you'd be
just a boring old man.

254
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:46,677
And you are a Cuban that never
learned how to drink tequila.

255
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:52,317
I only miss one thing.

256
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:54,397
Seeing Ana
walk through that door.

257
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:04,317
As for the restaurant,
I don't miss it for a minute.

258
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,237
Too many fights.

259
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:11,797
Ana was right.
I didn't know how to run it.

260
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:15,757
I only know how to cook.
Now, even that is going.

261
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:19,597
What are you talking about?
You're still a great chef.

262
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:21,877
One of the greatest chefs
in the world, Martin.

263
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:26,397
A chef who can't smell
or taste anything.

264
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:30,877
I'm dependent on your nose
to judge my recipes.

265
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,517
- And Beethoven?
- What about Beethoven?

266
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:36,997
Beethoven composed,
and he couldn't hear a goddamn thing.

267
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:42,317
He composed his greatest symphonies
by heart and instinct, Martin.

268
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:45,237
Your greatest recipes
have yet to be written.

269
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,037
You're getting drunk.

270
00:21:48,077 --> 00:21:53,917
It's a good thing I still enjoy
drinking and eating and talking.

271
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:55,877
As for sex...

272
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:59,717
well, I think you and me
are semiretired.

273
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,757
Speak for yourself.

274
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,117
Where's my shirt?

275
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:40,597
"Thanks for ironing the shirt, Dad."

276
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:48,637
I practically had to beg Yolanda
to bring me over here.

277
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,877
- I heard so many good things about you.
- Please.

278
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:53,717
My daughter's been so alone
during her terrible divorce.

279
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:56,517
She tells me that you're a widower.

280
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,757
- Martin, isn't it?
- Yes. It's a pleasure.

281
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,917
I'm Hortensia.

282
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:07,477
- This is my oldest.
- Leticia!

283
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:08,917
Of course.

284
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,797
The schoolteacher, right?

285
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:15,757
- Let me pour you a cup of coffee.
- You're still not married?

286
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:18,877
No. I mean, yes, I'm not married.

287
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:21,157
And a nice girl like you.

288
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:23,757
You might want to try a little
Preparation H around the eyes.

289
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:26,317
It gets rid
of those nasty little lines.

290
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:30,237
Anyway, once you're past the sex,
marriage is not all that interesting.

291
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:33,477
Especially if you're crazy enough
to marry a real loser like Yolanda did.

292
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:34,677
Mother!

293
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:37,557
You wouldn't listen to me,
and now look where you are.

294
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:43,117
I left something in the car.
I'll be right back.

295
00:23:45,597 --> 00:23:47,557
We all learn from our mistakes.

296
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:50,957
Yes, of course. It's just that...

297
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,877
as a parent, it's so painful to watch
your child suffer needlessly.

298
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:57,317
You and I know a few things
about raising daughters.

299
00:23:57,397 --> 00:24:00,837
I'm still learning.
You see--

300
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:04,517
- This is my--
- Your youngest! Maribel.

301
00:24:07,877 --> 00:24:10,237
And what are you
rebelling against, dear?

302
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:13,317
People who can talk and talk
and talk and say nothing.

303
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,477
Careful, honey,
boys don't like smart-asses.

304
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:17,917
Yeah, they just like asses.

305
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:23,437
It's hard to tell,
but I did teach her manners.

306
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:27,757
Just don't wait too long like your
big sister. She's already over the hill.

307
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:29,197
Sugar?

308
00:24:30,197 --> 00:24:32,837
Life is bitter enough.

309
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:34,277
Carmen.

310
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:38,917
- And you must be Carmencita.
- And you must be Yolanda's mother.

311
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:41,557
Of course there's no problem here.

312
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:46,637
Just remember, as pretty as you are,
a man is incapable of telling the truth.

313
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:52,277
I'm late for a meeting. I'm sorry,
but it was very nice meeting you.

314
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,877
Me, too.

315
00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:58,477
Just wait.Just--

316
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:04,877
Daughters. And they say
that boys are harder to raise.

317
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:09,557
What's this?

318
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:11,277
Oh, my!

319
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:15,317
It's not mine.
A man's work is never done.

320
00:25:16,357 --> 00:25:20,437
Yolanda tells me you make a coconut flan
that brings a woman to tears.

321
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,717
...anything until I get there, okay?

322
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:42,637
Hi. Thank you for meeting me,
Ms. Naranjo.

323
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:44,557
My pleasure.
I've been looking--

324
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:49,157
Don't worry. I'll take care of it
as soon as I arrive, okay? Bye.

325
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,117
Sorry, but I'm flying earlier
than I expected.

326
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:53,157
- No problem.
- So?

327
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:55,917
So, according to my analysis...

328
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:58,717
Petersen's air, rail and trucking links
are all very strong...

329
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:02,757
but those assets are far outweighed by
the company's financial liabilities...

330
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:07,397
and a cargo fleet that needs a lot more
work than their projections allow for.

331
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:09,837
Are you telling me
the company is a dog?

332
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:12,157
Bottom line? Yes.

333
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,837
Well, I could have read that
in the Journal.

334
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:18,437
Don't worry.
You'll be paid for it.

335
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:25,277
Why bother hiring me if you're planning
to purchase Petersen anyway?

336
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:26,477
Excuse me?

337
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:29,917
I think you've already decided
to purchase the company.

338
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:34,877
How did you arrive at that theory?

339
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:38,277
Last month's Wine and Gourmet magazine
had a picture of you dining...

340
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:42,117
in San Francisco with Harlan Richter,
the patent attorney.

341
00:26:42,197 --> 00:26:43,877
So?

342
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:45,877
Petersen's ships and trucks
are all fitted...

343
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:48,757
with their patented
satellite tracking devices.

344
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:53,957
I think you're interested in acquiring
the company just to get the patent.

345
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:55,957
You mean a classic bait and switch.

346
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:57,237
Exactly.

347
00:26:58,157 --> 00:27:00,917
It could be a huge market.
They have the potential...

348
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:03,117
to track all kinds
of consumer products...

349
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:07,717
including luggage, computers,
Palm Pilots, cell phones, you name it.

350
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:12,637
Good effort. But Harlan Richter
happens to be a friend of mine...

351
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:14,797
and I'm really just interested
in the ships.

352
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,077
Bye.

353
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,077
Let's go.

354
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:25,557
The second type of chemical reaction
is a composition reaction.

355
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:27,797
The second type of chemical reaction
is a composition reaction.

356
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:30,997
We all hate the smell of ammonia,
don't we?

357
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,037
So nitrogen and hydrogen yield ammonia.

358
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:39,717
Who else can give me an example
of a composition reaction?

359
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:41,477
What? No hands?

360
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:48,117
Who wants to return the ball?

361
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,997
Arms down.
I'll do it.

362
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:56,197
I'm trying to teach up here.

363
00:27:57,157 --> 00:28:00,357
I'm sorry. Look what we did
to your window.

364
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,317
Did anybody get hurt up there?

365
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:04,237
No, just humiliated.

366
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:08,357
Humiliated.
You ought to see how my catcher feels.

367
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,317
I didn't know
he could throw that far.

368
00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:18,677
You gonna keep that ball
as a souvenir?

369
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:22,837
I mean, you can. We got more.

370
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:36,517
Love is a chemical reaction,
Miss Naranjo.

371
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:42,277
Please tell me you know what H2O is.

372
00:28:51,477 --> 00:28:53,597
Waiting for Eden?

373
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:55,597
Waiting for you.

374
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:57,997
Come on.

375
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,757
- Where do you want to go?
- Brazil.

376
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,757
Brazil. Okay.

377
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:14,197
- What's this?
- It's a figa. A good luck charm.

378
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:17,157
- Has it brought you any luck?
- I'm with you, aren't I?

379
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,957
Red lights are such a waste of time,
don't you think?

380
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:33,917
You just sit and wait
with nothing to do.

381
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:06,437
Hi. We've never met up close.

382
00:30:06,477 --> 00:30:09,797
I'm Orlando Castillo,
the new baseball coach.

383
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:14,517
You teach science, right?

384
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:15,957
Chemistry.

385
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:22,277
Nice biceps.

386
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,157
Pardon?

387
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,997
You work out?

388
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:31,157
Too bad.

389
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:35,277
'Cause you could improve your triceps
if you would work out.

390
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:55,117
Surprise, surprise.

391
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,237
I felt like cooking.

392
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:10,357
You cooked enough for an army.

393
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:11,797
Try this.

394
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:21,477
That's delicious.

395
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:24,317
Is that one of your dad's specialities?

396
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:26,117
It's my version.

397
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:30,557
It's tamarind-glazed lamb on
cumin cabbage with a tangerine salsa.

398
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:33,877
The lamb is French-South American,
the cabbage is pure Mexican...

399
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:35,957
and the salsa is Caribbean.

400
00:31:36,037 --> 00:31:38,477
What will they call this?

401
00:31:38,557 --> 00:31:39,877
I don't know.

402
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,237
Dad calls my dishes "mutts."

403
00:31:45,157 --> 00:31:46,557
"Nuevo Latino."

404
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:51,237
I like that.

405
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:56,797
I bet if your dad would just try it,
he would definitely be sold.

406
00:31:57,837 --> 00:32:01,877
When I was little, he used to bake me
bracelets out of cookie dough.

407
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:07,877
Then he'd make rings and paint them
with colored sugar to make them sparkle.

408
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,557
Did you see that?
That's not stable.

409
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,797
I'm gonna go check this out.

410
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,877
It might be the leg.

411
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,517
It's the leg.

412
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:23,437
Yeah. Come here.

413
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:08,317
- Mind if I join you?
- Of course.

414
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:12,997
What a beautiful day.

415
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:14,757
Yes, it is.

416
00:33:15,757 --> 00:33:18,677
I need to stretch. Okay?

417
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,437
- All right.
- All right.

418
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,677
- Ready?
- Yeah.

419
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:24,997
And one...

420
00:33:27,357 --> 00:33:28,717
and two...

421
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:32,197
and three.

422
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:41,237
I feel so much better.
Come on.

423
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:48,757
Uh-oh, red light.

424
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:06,837
You need to review page 172. Okay?

425
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:23,477
"Leticia:
Had we but world enough, and time...

426
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:25,637
this coyness, lady, were no crime.

427
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:30,597
We would sit down and think
which way to walk...

428
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:34,117
and pass our long love's day."

429
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:38,317
Long love's day.

430
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:42,637
Hello?

431
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:47,277
Carmen, Mr. Urgell flew back from San
Francisco today. He wants to meet now.

432
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:49,197
Did you change my appointment?

433
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:51,477
He asked directions to the market.

434
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,797
You gave him the address?

435
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:56,877
- He's coming there to meet you.
- What do you mean, he's coming here?

436
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:58,797
That's what I said.

437
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,237
Carmen?

438
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:03,837
Thanks for the advance notice, Sharon.

439
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:08,517
- Mr. Urgell.
- Please, call me Antonio.

440
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:10,837
- May I help you?
- Sure.

441
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:15,357
So this is where you get
your great ideas.

442
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:18,117
You were wrong assuming
what I was thinking the other day.

443
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:21,757
But your instincts could be right...

444
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:23,797
and your timing is perfect.

445
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:28,117
So perfect, in fact--

446
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:30,317
That you're thinking
of buying Petersen?

447
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,637
Oh, just to get the patent.

448
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:50,677
Pass the rice, please.

449
00:36:50,757 --> 00:36:53,597
Am I hallucinating, or are we having
a pleasant dinner?

450
00:36:57,237 --> 00:36:58,797
I have some news.

451
00:36:58,877 --> 00:37:01,197
- Oh, well.
- Moving out?

452
00:37:01,277 --> 00:37:03,197
- Not yet.
- Did you close escrow?

453
00:37:03,277 --> 00:37:05,517
- Yes. That's not what I was--
- When are you moving?

454
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:09,077
- Maribel, please.
- Why can't I say anything?

455
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:12,037
I've been offered a job
in a new company.

456
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:14,637
Oh, congratulations.

457
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:17,037
In Barcelona.

458
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:20,797
Spain?

459
00:37:20,877 --> 00:37:22,357
Yes.

460
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:23,637
That's far.

461
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:25,557
Not far enough for me.

462
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:30,317
I guess it doesn't matter how far it is.
The distance isn't important.

463
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:32,197
What matters is...

464
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:34,117
is it a good opportunity?

465
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:37,357
It's the kind of opportunity
you've always wanted for me, Dad.

466
00:37:37,437 --> 00:37:39,917
I would be running a high-tech
start-up company...

467
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:42,357
and the money is more
than I ever dreamed.

468
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:44,357
What about the condo?

469
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:47,477
I'll rent it out.
It can pay for itself.

470
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:01,517
Excuse me.

471
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:07,757
- Look what I brought.
- Music.

472
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:26,357
For some reason,
I've never found the right man.

473
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,277
That's hard to believe.

474
00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:33,477
My first husband, Oscar,
he was a womanizer.

475
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:36,157
He just couldn't keep his cosita
in his pants.

476
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:42,917
Then there was Gustavo.

477
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:44,877
He was a real artist.

478
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:48,597
He liked the opera and the ballet.

479
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:51,477
He also liked to dress in tutus.

480
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:56,357
Then there was my third husband, Pedro.

481
00:38:56,437 --> 00:39:00,637
In the middle of making love,
he had a heart attack and died.

482
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,757
- I'm so sorry.
-Just like that.

483
00:39:02,797 --> 00:39:04,197
Sorry.

484
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,037
And your wife?

485
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:09,637
She passed away 15 years ago.

486
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:11,557
And you never remarried.

487
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:15,277
No, not with working...

488
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:18,437
and raising three girls, it's--

489
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:21,637
I like a macho con priorities.

490
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:24,877
The Spanglish will definitely
get on his nerves.

491
00:39:24,957 --> 00:39:29,517
- It would be nice if he found someone.
- Yeah. Someone else.

492
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,077
Are you all right?

493
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:47,237
I think I've had too much to drink.

494
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:51,477
"Her face, her tongue...

495
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:55,557
her wit, so fair, so sharp."

496
00:39:57,877 --> 00:39:59,837
Yours made it into my drawers.

497
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:03,197
Dad is getting worse. He should
just let us sort our own laundry.

498
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,797
I put your stuff in your room.

499
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:11,277
They're called thongs, Leti.
Come on. You can say it. Thongs.

500
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:13,437
They're not the work of the devil,
you know.

501
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:15,877
They look extremely uncomfortable.

502
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:19,517
On the contrary.
They kind of massage you all day...

503
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:22,677
inspiring all kinds of thoughts.

504
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:25,837
The only thing I need flossed
are my teeth, thank you.

505
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:46,557
Too late. I already saw them.

506
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:48,517
So, who's the bard?

507
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:50,357
The drama teacher?

508
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:51,837
Social studies?

509
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:55,157
It's that security guard with
the broken nose and cauliflower ears.

510
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:57,677
- He's always had a thing for you.
- Very funny.

511
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:02,117
What do you have--

512
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,237
You put Preparation H around your eyes?

513
00:41:07,317 --> 00:41:09,517
Get out! Get out!

514
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,037
Miss April?

515
00:41:21,637 --> 00:41:24,717
- Good morning. How are you?
- Good.

516
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:26,317
Is that your breakfast?

517
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:30,117
Mom didn't have time
to make me anything.

518
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:33,197
They serve pizza dogs in the cafeteria.

519
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:38,757
Let me tell you. How would you like it
if I brought you lunch once in a while?

520
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:41,397
A couple of main courses...

521
00:41:41,477 --> 00:41:43,317
and some porcupine cookies.

522
00:41:43,397 --> 00:41:44,997
- Yeah!
- All right.

523
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:49,637
But my mom makes me
lunch sometimes.

524
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:51,317
Then we'll trade.

525
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:54,517
You give me yours. That way,
your mom won't be embarrassed.

526
00:41:56,757 --> 00:41:58,437
Your bus.

527
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,117
Go on.

528
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:05,477
- Good-bye. Thank you.
- Good-bye now. Be careful.

529
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:16,057
So, French, Portuguese and German
and English?

530
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:18,437
So, French, Portuguese and German
and English?

531
00:42:18,477 --> 00:42:20,757
What do you call that?
You're a--

532
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:22,917
What is that when somebody
speaks several languages?

533
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,917
- A polyglot.
- Correct.

534
00:42:25,997 --> 00:42:30,197
- How about two languages?
- That's easy. Bilingual, right?

535
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:31,837
One language?

536
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:38,277
I don't know.
I don't think I know that one.

537
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:39,557
American.

538
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:42,557
I'm just kidding.
I'm American, and I speak two.

539
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:46,117
Both at the same time, on top of it.
It drives my dad crazy.

540
00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:47,677
He's a purist.

541
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:49,597
I love this!

542
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,997
Contemporary Folk Songs.

543
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:58,477
- Okay, Mr. Bossa Nova, what is that?
- I don't know.

544
00:42:58,557 --> 00:43:00,837
- It came like this.
- Yeah.

545
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:04,157
"I never saw them before.
They came with the apartment."

546
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:05,517
Whatever.

547
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:09,197
I love your place.

548
00:43:10,317 --> 00:43:12,237
Thank you.

549
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:15,597
What made you decide
to come to the States?

550
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:18,357
I didn't want
to go straight to college.

551
00:43:18,437 --> 00:43:21,877
There's a whole world out there,
and I had to see it, you know?

552
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:26,117
How long are you planning
on staying?

553
00:43:26,157 --> 00:43:27,517
I don't know.

554
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:31,637
I think if you tell life
what it has to be, you limit it.

555
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:35,597
But if you let it show you
what it wants to be...

556
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:37,957
it will open doors
you never knew existed.

557
00:43:38,037 --> 00:43:39,757
Yeah.

558
00:43:39,837 --> 00:43:41,917
And your parents are cool with that?

559
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:44,357
Totally.

560
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:48,237
Wow. Brazil must be
the opposite of Mexico.

561
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,877
"Gather ye rosebud while ye may...

562
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:32,197
Old Time is still a-flying...

563
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:35,397
And this same flower
that smiles today...

564
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,477
Tomorrow will be dying"?

565
00:44:40,557 --> 00:44:44,037
- Do you live near a rain forest?
- No.

566
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:46,957
Where I'm from is too far below
the equator to be tropical.

567
00:44:47,877 --> 00:44:50,437
In fact, I hateJuly
because it's our coldest month.

568
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:54,277
-July?
- Yeah, the seasons are opposite there.

569
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:58,717
Wow. Seasons are opposite,
parents are opposite.

570
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:01,637
What else is opposite
below the equator?

571
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:12,117
- I'd like to go to this opposite world.
- Yeah?

572
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:19,877
You have ten minutes
to solve the problem...

573
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:22,877
before we move on to lab.

574
00:45:28,317 --> 00:45:32,077
All right, fellas, gather around
and sit. Pay attention.

575
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:35,157
Now, young men, what is our problem?

576
00:45:35,237 --> 00:45:38,917
Here's what happened in the last game.
You were using the bat...

577
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:42,437
like it's a walking cane,
like you're rap--you're not rappers!

578
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:45,797
You're not supposed to move
your legs up and down. This is baseball.

579
00:45:45,837 --> 00:45:47,717
It's more than a game.
It's about life.

580
00:45:47,757 --> 00:45:49,717
It's about getting to first base.
It's an art form.

581
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:52,877
Do you know what I'm telling you?
I'm telling you that--

582
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,797
What I was trying to tell you...

583
00:46:01,877 --> 00:46:03,797
is you're doing a good job.

584
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,557
- Done?
- No.

585
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:15,277
Just like I promised you.

586
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:21,437
Green corn tamales. Huh?

587
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:23,397
Isn't that pretty?
Looks like a garden.

588
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,797
You're really
gonna like this one.

589
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:28,317
Tomatoes
stuffed with guacamole.

590
00:46:28,397 --> 00:46:30,757
Little tomatitos,
stuffed with guacamole.

591
00:46:30,837 --> 00:46:34,037
- Very special.
- Where are the porcupine cookies?

592
00:46:34,117 --> 00:46:36,677
I knew you were
gonna ask that. Here.

593
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:39,837
There they are. But this is at the end.
You can't eat that first, right?

594
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,317
Can I have a bite?

595
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:43,517
I'll trade you my Pokémon card
for the cookies.

596
00:46:43,597 --> 00:46:45,797
You should open a restaurant.

597
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,837
I'll think about that.
That's a good idea.

598
00:46:54,677 --> 00:46:56,517
Here. Here, taste this.

599
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:01,917
It's too salty?

600
00:47:03,437 --> 00:47:05,317
Too spicy? What?

601
00:47:05,357 --> 00:47:07,597
Come on.
Don't make those faces.

602
00:47:07,677 --> 00:47:09,597
Is it too salty? Too spicy?
What is--

603
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:14,837
- Gomez?
- What happened?

604
00:47:26,437 --> 00:47:29,717
- I just heard.
- Imagine that, huh?

605
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:31,677
I almost got killed
by my own fart.

606
00:47:34,797 --> 00:47:36,197
Look at her.

607
00:47:36,237 --> 00:47:37,957
Seems like yesterday
she was a little girl...

608
00:47:38,037 --> 00:47:40,477
following me
all over the kitchen.

609
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,437
Yeah, until he
kicked me out.

610
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:44,837
I wanted you to do something
significant with your life.

611
00:47:44,877 --> 00:47:47,197
You didn't think a woman
would make a good chef.

612
00:47:47,277 --> 00:47:49,677
I didn't send my daughter to graduate
school so she could make tortillas.

613
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:51,597
You only make tortillas?

614
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:53,597
You wanna spend your life
in a kitchen like me?

615
00:47:53,677 --> 00:47:56,757
Hello? I'm supposed to be
the center of attention here, okay?

616
00:47:56,837 --> 00:47:58,077
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

617
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:00,677
You know what I went through
to give her opportunities I never had.

618
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:03,557
- Here we go with the immigrant story.
- This is not an immigrant story.

619
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:06,277
- This is not what I'm talking about.
- Martin, please go outside and--

620
00:48:06,357 --> 00:48:08,317
- You know--
- Please go and get me some ice.

621
00:48:08,397 --> 00:48:10,477
Please, I need some ice.

622
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:13,437
All right. So you two can talk
behind my back, right?

623
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:15,717
Of course.
What else?

624
00:48:15,797 --> 00:48:17,717
- Look, it's--
- Get--

625
00:48:21,557 --> 00:48:24,837
He just wants to spare you
our kind of life, baby, that's all.

626
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:27,557
What life?
Doing what I love?

627
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:29,557
Listen.
Let me tell you something.

628
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:34,677
I remember
when we started our restaurant.

629
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:36,597
Some of the customers
would complain...

630
00:48:36,677 --> 00:48:39,357
that the mole sauces
were too hot...

631
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:43,117
or that they wanted them on the side,
and your father wouldn't budge.

632
00:48:43,197 --> 00:48:45,117
He was, like, uncompromising...

633
00:48:45,197 --> 00:48:47,477
when people wanted him
to change anything.

634
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,037
I know. You're not
telling me anything new.

635
00:48:51,117 --> 00:48:54,957
What I'm trying to tell you is
that things got very difficult.

636
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:58,437
Okay? Very, very difficult.

637
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:01,997
The day your mother died...

638
00:49:02,757 --> 00:49:05,237
so sudden like that...

639
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:09,437
he blamed himself,
he blamed the kitchen, the restaurant.

640
00:49:09,477 --> 00:49:11,877
I know, but I'm not like him.

641
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:14,397
I'm not afraid of change.
You know that.

642
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:18,357
Yeah.
And look at you.

643
00:49:19,237 --> 00:49:22,557
Your father's more proud of you
than anything in the whole world.

644
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:28,357
He's just the type that doesn't
express his feelings, that's all. Okay?

645
00:49:28,437 --> 00:49:30,117
He's not like Tío Gomez.

646
00:49:30,157 --> 00:49:33,237
Tío Gomez is a guy who cries
when he watches telenovelas.

647
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:34,357
I know.

648
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:37,157
- Look at me. I'm crying now.
- I know you're crying now.

649
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:19,357
DearJesus,
thank you for the gifts.

650
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,277
Dear, dear Lord,
open our eyes...

651
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:28,197
and be our guide
as we thank you...

652
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:30,917
dear Lord,
Lord Jesus Christ.

653
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,997
- Amen.
- Amen.

654
00:50:42,757 --> 00:50:45,477
- Maribel tells us you're from Brazil?
- Yes.

655
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:47,477
- Take this.
- Thank you.

656
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:50,277
Well, the only white
Brazilians I know are...

657
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:52,797
Nazi war criminals.

658
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:53,997
Dad!

659
00:50:55,477 --> 00:51:00,117
There probably were a few,
but most German immigrants...

660
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:01,997
went to Brazil between the wars...

661
00:51:02,077 --> 00:51:03,997
mainly because of
the depression in Europe.

662
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:06,277
Andy's half German,
half Italian.

663
00:51:08,237 --> 00:51:09,397
Like the Argentinians.

664
00:51:09,477 --> 00:51:11,357
They always brag about
their European heritage.

665
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:15,637
This is amazing.

666
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:19,557
I can't even describe it.
It's really incredible.

667
00:51:19,597 --> 00:51:21,677
So, you like
pulpo a la Veracruzana?

668
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:22,877
Like it?

669
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:25,557
I love it. Really.
It's incredible.

670
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:27,717
Maribel told me
you were a chef...

671
00:51:27,797 --> 00:51:31,037
but I'd say you are
more like an artist.

672
00:51:32,677 --> 00:51:34,997
Artist.
That's very generous of you.

673
00:51:35,077 --> 00:51:37,477
You're so lucky.
Dinner like this all the time.

674
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:47,077
No. But tell me some more
about your country.

675
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:49,957
Is it true that there are
moreJapanese women...

676
00:51:49,997 --> 00:51:51,357
I have an announcement.

677
00:51:51,437 --> 00:51:52,837
than anywhere else,
outside ofJapan?

678
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,397
- It's overcooked.
- It's not overcooked.

679
00:51:55,477 --> 00:51:58,117
- Do you know Mexican cuisine?
- Not as much as I'd like.

680
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:02,437
But I do know that it's one of
the major cuisines of the world.

681
00:52:02,517 --> 00:52:04,317
You should come back next week...

682
00:52:04,357 --> 00:52:05,677
I have an announcement.

683
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:07,877
because I'm gonna make
something very, very special.

684
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:10,597
I decided to postpone college.

685
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:14,037
Yeah-- What?
What was that?

686
00:52:14,117 --> 00:52:16,477
I decided not to go
straight to college.

687
00:52:16,557 --> 00:52:18,757
I want to take off
a year or two first.

688
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:22,597
May I ask why?

689
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:24,677
I want to find myself.

690
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:28,757
Find yourself.
Well, you won't have to look far.

691
00:52:31,077 --> 00:52:32,677
You know what I mean, Dad.

692
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,757
No, I don't.

693
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:40,997
You've applied, you've been accepted,
you're going to college.

694
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:42,437
End of discussion.

695
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:44,597
No, I'm not.

696
00:52:44,677 --> 00:52:47,037
Beginning of drama.

697
00:52:47,117 --> 00:52:48,837
Now, listen to me, young lady.

698
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:51,677
Why can't I decide what to do
with my life?

699
00:52:51,757 --> 00:52:54,637
Because as long as you're living
under my roof, you will do as I say.

700
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:58,757
- You understand?
- Fine. That's just fine!

701
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:01,797
'Cause I'm moving in with Andy.

702
00:53:01,877 --> 00:53:04,477
- What?
- What?

703
00:53:05,357 --> 00:53:06,757
- Dad.
- Dad.

704
00:53:06,837 --> 00:53:10,237
What? You sit at my table,
you make a fool of me...

705
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:12,157
while you're scheming
to take my daughter away?

706
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:15,877
- I wasn't scheming.
- I just want to find out who I am.

707
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:17,517
- Is that a crime?
- You're Maribel Naranjo!

708
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:20,117
- That's who you are!
- I don't want you to tell me!

709
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,797
I want to find out for myself...

710
00:53:21,837 --> 00:53:24,357
or I'm gonna be who you
want me to be, like Carmen.

711
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:26,277
Whoa. What?

712
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:28,317
I never wanted you
to be anything, anybody.

713
00:53:28,397 --> 00:53:29,957
Why are you
afraid to confront him?

714
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:31,717
You see what you're
doing to your sister?

715
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:34,837
- She does it to herself, Dad!
- I am not afraid, Maribel.

716
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:37,317
This is the first time
I ever hear of anything--

717
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:39,437
- Whoa!
- Stop it!

718
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:45,517
Way to go, Leti.

719
00:53:55,957 --> 00:53:57,437
You okay?

720
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,077
No wonder April's lunch box
is coming back empty.

721
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:40,997
Guilty.

722
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,877
What happens to the lunches
that I make her?

723
00:54:43,957 --> 00:54:47,757
Last Thursday's meat loaf
wasn't bad. It was--

724
00:54:47,837 --> 00:54:48,917
Oh, my God.

725
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,037
I can't believe
you're eating my food.

726
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:54,597
No, don't worry. I don't have much
in the way of taste anymore.

727
00:54:54,677 --> 00:54:56,117
I hope not.

728
00:54:56,197 --> 00:54:58,157
Anyway, it's the feeling that counts.

729
00:55:03,437 --> 00:55:06,757
- April's not going to school today?
- She's a little under the weather.

730
00:55:06,797 --> 00:55:08,797
I'm sorry.

731
00:55:10,597 --> 00:55:12,997
Somebody else
may as well enjoy it.

732
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:15,957
Here.
Filete relleno de cabrilla.

733
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,237
Thank you.

734
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:21,317
Please don't tell her I know.

735
00:55:21,397 --> 00:55:23,917
She must enjoy
her secret encounters with you.

736
00:56:02,757 --> 00:56:05,237
Leti, did you know Dad
went to see a cardiologist?

737
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:07,157
- Leti?
- In here.

738
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:12,957
What are you doing?

739
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,357
I don't know.

740
00:56:16,237 --> 00:56:18,197
I'm still in shock.

741
00:56:18,277 --> 00:56:19,837
Our little sister.

742
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:23,717
I knew she was going off
to college, but...

743
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:26,277
that's not the same
as moving out.

744
00:56:26,357 --> 00:56:27,957
Have you seen Dad?

745
00:56:28,837 --> 00:56:30,837
Yeah. He's catering
some affair.

746
00:56:31,797 --> 00:56:33,157
How'd he look?

747
00:56:33,237 --> 00:56:36,557
Between Maribel and Gomez,
he's not looking all that well.

748
00:56:36,637 --> 00:56:38,957
- You want some tea?
- Yeah.

749
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:55,877
I know what you're
wondering about.

750
00:56:57,437 --> 00:57:00,677
- You think I'm overreacting?
- "Overreacting"?

751
00:57:02,037 --> 00:57:06,077
Yeah. I'm concerned
about how he is physically.

752
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:12,837
Is that all you ever think about,
the physical part?

753
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:15,037
- No, I was just--
- I'm sure he's fine physically.

754
00:57:15,117 --> 00:57:16,997
He's the new baseball coach.

755
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:20,477
Played professionally in the minors.
Never been married.

756
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:21,917
His name is Orlando.

757
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:25,757
I had his files checked
by a secretary in the office.

758
00:57:27,237 --> 00:57:29,757
- I love that you did that.
- Do you?

759
00:57:29,797 --> 00:57:32,077
Because I feel like such a--

760
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,277
A snoop?

761
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:35,277
Guess it runs
in the family.

762
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:44,837
How do you get your hair
to do that?

763
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:48,477
We are gonna bring Orlando
to his knees.

764
00:57:50,557 --> 00:57:53,197
No. You're not gonna
make me wear a--

765
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:02,397
Ow!

766
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,197
Hi.

767
00:58:31,277 --> 00:58:34,277
Hey, are you okay? 'Cause
you're walking a little funny.

768
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:37,597
You know, I could teach you exercises
to stretch out, if you want.

769
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:40,437
To give you better balance,
you know? They're simple.

770
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,717
You can do 'em on a chair
or on the table.

771
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:47,397
So, if you're interested,
you let me know. Okay?

772
00:58:51,877 --> 00:58:53,797
On the table.

773
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:11,557
"I pray thee,
gentle mortal sing again:

774
00:59:11,597 --> 00:59:15,037
And thy fair virtue's force
perforce...

775
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:18,437
doth move me on the first view
to say, to swear...

776
00:59:20,717 --> 00:59:22,637
I love thee."

777
00:59:41,317 --> 00:59:43,237
Okay, Billy, just like
we told you in practice.

778
00:59:43,317 --> 00:59:45,397
Keep your eye on the ball
and make contact. Oh, yes!

779
00:59:45,477 --> 00:59:47,757
That's contact!
That's what I been talking about!

780
00:59:47,837 --> 00:59:49,957
That's Billy boy!
That's my boy!

781
00:59:53,037 --> 00:59:55,077
Hey, lady,
we're playing a game here!

782
00:59:58,437 --> 01:00:00,477
Yes.

783
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:03,317
"Yes."

784
01:00:04,037 --> 01:00:05,317
The poems.

785
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:09,637
I love you too.

786
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:26,237
What poems?

787
01:00:45,877 --> 01:00:48,277
What were you thinking,
writing notes like that?

788
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:50,197
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

789
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:57,357
I'm sorry if those jerks
hurt your feelings.

790
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:04,877
I want you to know that if--

791
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,317
if I could think
of things like that...

792
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,077
if I were a kind of guy
who could write things like that...

793
01:01:11,157 --> 01:01:13,157
I would have written
those poems myself.

794
01:01:16,837 --> 01:01:18,837
Please, please, don't cry.

795
01:01:21,957 --> 01:01:23,917
My makeup's running.

796
01:01:26,317 --> 01:01:29,597
That's okay.
I like you better without it.

797
01:01:30,997 --> 01:01:33,717
But I have these little wrinkles
around my eyes.

798
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,037
Where?

799
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:40,517
I don't see any wrinkles.

800
01:02:17,477 --> 01:02:19,437
- Hi.
- Wow.

801
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,837
What do you think?
Better, right?

802
01:02:23,357 --> 01:02:25,277
Can you?
Thank you.

803
01:02:25,317 --> 01:02:27,757
You won't believe how gross
the laundry room was.

804
01:02:27,837 --> 01:02:30,957
I ran the washer with hot water
and bleach to disinfect it.

805
01:02:31,037 --> 01:02:32,877
- Did you see my papers?
- What papers?

806
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:37,917
-The ones that were on the bed.
-Yes. They're in the organizer I bought.

807
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:39,877
I had them spread out
for a reason.

808
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:42,717
You can't afford to do that
in a studio apartment.

809
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:44,677
There's not enough space.

810
01:02:51,317 --> 01:02:52,917
There used to be.

811
01:02:52,997 --> 01:02:54,877
- What, sweetie?
- Nothing.

812
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,877
- Hope you like your sangria fruity.
- Oh, yes, I do.

813
01:03:04,957 --> 01:03:07,157
But tell me,
what are we celebrating?

814
01:03:07,237 --> 01:03:09,557
Yolanda's getting
custody of April.

815
01:03:09,637 --> 01:03:12,277
Her divorce came through today.
Isn't that great?

816
01:03:12,357 --> 01:03:15,677
- Thank God I could be here with her.
- That's very good news.

817
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:17,957
Yes. I'm just
a little worried still.

818
01:03:17,997 --> 01:03:19,797
She's a single mother now...

819
01:03:19,877 --> 01:03:21,917
and she has absolutely
no professional skills.

820
01:03:21,997 --> 01:03:25,157
She keeps telling me that she's
got everything under control...

821
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:27,597
but I don't see her
doing anything.

822
01:03:27,677 --> 01:03:31,157
Anyway, the worst is over.

823
01:03:31,237 --> 01:03:33,157
Good. It's all very good, then.

824
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:35,077
Here we are.
All right.

825
01:03:35,157 --> 01:03:38,277
So, what are your plans
now that you've...

826
01:03:38,317 --> 01:03:40,997
accomplished everything
you came here to do?

827
01:03:43,077 --> 01:03:45,077
I'm not at all certain
that I have...

828
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:47,357
accomplished what
I came here to do, Martin.

829
01:04:25,357 --> 01:04:27,237
Dear Lord Jesus...

830
01:04:28,477 --> 01:04:30,317
please help me.

831
01:04:31,517 --> 01:04:33,637
Please, please
give me the strength...

832
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:37,717
to make him understand just--

833
01:04:37,797 --> 01:04:42,357
Please, just help me, dear Lord
Jesus Christ almighty up in heaven.

834
01:04:43,437 --> 01:04:45,637
My dearJesus,
just give me strength--

835
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:49,877
Leticia, why are you
praying so hard?

836
01:04:57,557 --> 01:04:59,837
- Amen.
- Amen.

837
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:11,977
I have an announcement.

838
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:13,037
I have an announcement.

839
01:05:15,477 --> 01:05:16,837
Yes?

840
01:05:18,797 --> 01:05:20,077
Well, I--

841
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,837
We just couldn't wait.

842
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:36,277
I mean, he wanted to,
and I wanted to, too, and--

843
01:05:36,357 --> 01:05:38,397
and we...

844
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:42,237
really wanted to do it
properly, Dad, but--

845
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:45,557
It just wouldn't--
It was so--

846
01:05:54,277 --> 01:05:57,757
Hold on. Okay?
Just one minute.

847
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:06,237
Where are you?

848
01:06:12,117 --> 01:06:14,077
- Come on.
- Do I look okay?

849
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:16,797
Yeah. You look great.
Come on.

850
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:19,637
Dad?

851
01:06:20,797 --> 01:06:22,157
Carmen...

852
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:27,517
I want you to meet
Orlando Castillo...

853
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:31,557
- my husband.
- Your what?

854
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:33,637
Your husband?

855
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:35,637
- You see, Orlando and I--
- Well, sir...

856
01:06:35,717 --> 01:06:37,877
I realize that this is too late...

857
01:06:37,957 --> 01:06:39,837
but I would like to take
this opportunity...

858
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:42,597
to ask for your daughter's hand
in marriage.

859
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:45,957
What's going on here?

860
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:49,157
Well, Orlando
and I met and--

861
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:53,277
Well, no,
what it is is that...

862
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:57,477
a couple of nights ago, sir,
we got ourselves into this situation...

863
01:06:57,517 --> 01:06:59,837
- No, I don't--
- that I hope you understand.

864
01:06:59,877 --> 01:07:01,797
I don't think you should
tell him that part.

865
01:07:01,877 --> 01:07:03,037
Please, please.

866
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:06,277
I'm just trying to get to the place
where we went to Las Vegas.

867
01:07:06,357 --> 01:07:07,677
Las Vegas?

868
01:07:07,717 --> 01:07:10,717
Yeah, we had to
get married in a hurry.

869
01:07:10,757 --> 01:07:12,677
I thought you went
on a retreat, Leti.

870
01:07:12,757 --> 01:07:15,877
Well, under those circumstances,
we really had no choice.

871
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:17,917
What circumstances?

872
01:07:17,997 --> 01:07:20,237
That's what I've been trying
to explain to you, sir--

873
01:07:20,317 --> 01:07:23,477
that we were, a couple of nights ago,
we were together and--

874
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:26,277
- I don't think he needs to--
- All right, all right.

875
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:28,197
Here, have a seat.

876
01:07:40,677 --> 01:07:42,957
So, Orlando,
are you a Christian?

877
01:07:43,037 --> 01:07:44,997
- No, I--
- He will be.

878
01:07:46,037 --> 01:07:47,877
Dad, may I?

879
01:07:52,037 --> 01:07:55,197
I love toppings.
I've always liked toppings.

880
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:58,877
Sometimes I go to restaurants
and I just ask for toppings.

881
01:07:58,917 --> 01:08:02,397
You know, I say
the more toppings, the merrier.

882
01:08:02,437 --> 01:08:04,357
That's what I say.

883
01:08:09,637 --> 01:08:11,757
You like tortilla soup?

884
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,077
Yes, of course.

885
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:16,637
My mother used to
make it for us all the time.

886
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:26,437
She never made it like this.

887
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:29,317
This is the best tortilla soup
I've ever had.

888
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,837
Orlando was in
the Dodger farm league.

889
01:08:35,117 --> 01:08:36,237
Here.

890
01:08:38,117 --> 01:08:39,397
Yes, I--

891
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:42,877
I used to catch
for Fernando Valenzuela...

892
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:45,197
when he was in the Sonora League
in Mexico.

893
01:08:51,277 --> 01:08:53,957
I still know some people
at Dodger Stadium.

894
01:08:55,437 --> 01:08:58,717
I could probably get us
some box seats.

895
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:01,957
And we can sit
right over the dugout.

896
01:09:01,997 --> 01:09:03,917
They're the best seats
in Dodger Stadium...

897
01:09:03,997 --> 01:09:07,077
and we can sit there
and have hot dogs and...

898
01:09:07,157 --> 01:09:08,437
sodas.

899
01:09:16,677 --> 01:09:18,077
Do you love her?

900
01:09:20,037 --> 01:09:21,157
Excuse me?

901
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:22,877
Do you love her?

902
01:09:24,517 --> 01:09:26,357
Yes, sir, I do.

903
01:09:26,437 --> 01:09:28,997
I love Leticia
very, very much.

904
01:09:36,277 --> 01:09:38,397
Hot dogs and sodas.

905
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:48,157
I'll tell you what.
You take care of the tickets.

906
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:50,277
I'll take care of the food.

907
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:57,277
All right. Provecho.

908
01:09:57,317 --> 01:09:58,757
Congratulations.

909
01:09:59,517 --> 01:10:01,437
We'll celebrate some other time,
seriously, all right?

910
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:03,157
Try some stuffed chiote.

911
01:10:03,237 --> 01:10:05,357
Thanks for everything, sis.

912
01:10:05,437 --> 01:10:07,277
I'm so happy for you, Leti.

913
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:10,317
Whoa!

914
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:36,477
- You're leaning.
- What?

915
01:10:37,277 --> 01:10:38,717
Towards the bowl.

916
01:10:39,677 --> 01:10:42,077
Honey, spoon the soup
away from yourself...

917
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:44,077
and then bring it
up to your mouth.

918
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,117
Don't lean towards the bowl.

919
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:52,317
I can't deal with this.

920
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:54,277
With what?
Table manners?

921
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:58,917
No, baby, with you telling me
what to do every second of the day.

922
01:10:58,957 --> 01:11:02,157
With you rearranging
my entire apartment...

923
01:11:02,237 --> 01:11:04,157
making the bed
every morning.

924
01:11:04,197 --> 01:11:06,717
You're still mad because
I misplaced your papers?

925
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:08,717
It's not just my papers.

926
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:11,037
I don't know where
anything is anymore.

927
01:11:11,077 --> 01:11:13,117
Where's my hammock?

928
01:11:13,157 --> 01:11:15,037
Your hammock?

929
01:11:15,077 --> 01:11:18,237
Before I came here, this place
was totally upside down.

930
01:11:18,277 --> 01:11:21,477
Yeah, okay, but I thought
you liked the opposite world.

931
01:11:22,197 --> 01:11:24,797
How can you say that?
After all I've done around here--

932
01:11:24,837 --> 01:11:26,037
Who asked you to?

933
01:11:26,117 --> 01:11:28,157
I never even asked you
to move in here.

934
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:36,157
- You're right.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

935
01:11:36,237 --> 01:11:38,717
- No, baby, come on.
- No, you're right.

936
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:40,957
- It's fine. No, don't worry.
- No, no, baby.

937
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,397
-I'll put everything back where it was.
-Baby, I'm sorry.

938
01:11:43,437 --> 01:11:46,237
I mean, I believe
this belongs here.

939
01:11:46,277 --> 01:11:47,557
Whoa!

940
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,677
- Let me see if I remember correctly.
- I deserved that.

941
01:11:50,757 --> 01:11:53,117
I believe that was over there.
That was there.

942
01:11:53,157 --> 01:11:54,677
I live here too.

943
01:11:54,757 --> 01:11:56,037
Never made the bed.

944
01:11:56,077 --> 01:11:58,437
- What are these? Papers?
- Hey, not the CDs.

945
01:11:58,477 --> 01:12:00,557
- Come on.
- This was probably there.

946
01:12:00,637 --> 01:12:02,597
I believe that was there,
if I remember correctly.

947
01:12:02,677 --> 01:12:05,317
Maybe that was over there.
I don't know. Let me see.

948
01:12:05,397 --> 01:12:06,397
This stuff.

949
01:12:06,477 --> 01:12:09,157
Can we talk
without you getting violent?

950
01:12:22,757 --> 01:12:25,637
How did you know
what you wanted to do--

951
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:29,237
that you wanted to go off
and see the world, anyway?

952
01:12:30,317 --> 01:12:32,237
Were you born knowing?

953
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,197
Is everybody
born knowing...

954
01:12:36,237 --> 01:12:39,157
exactly what they want to do
with their life, except for me?

955
01:12:39,237 --> 01:12:40,477
Stop it.

956
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:49,117
Are you even
listening to me?

957
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:57,157
Why doesn't anybody
listen to me?

958
01:12:59,197 --> 01:13:01,357
Hello? Are you--
Am I invisible?

959
01:13:05,477 --> 01:13:07,437
- Look who's back.
- Hiya.

960
01:13:10,117 --> 01:13:13,437
No matter how much Martin tries,
he can't kill me with his food, eh?

961
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:17,157
Come on.
How are you? Hiya.

962
01:13:17,237 --> 01:13:18,557
All right.

963
01:13:19,357 --> 01:13:21,517
No work for you.
Sit down and take it easy.

964
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,917
Sit down. Get him something
to drink or something.

965
01:13:23,997 --> 01:13:26,117
Now, you stay there.
Behave yourself.

966
01:13:26,157 --> 01:13:28,157
All right, hombre.

967
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:34,397
Let's go. We have
a very special guest of honor today.

968
01:13:34,437 --> 01:13:37,757
We must pay special attention.
Our captain is back.

969
01:13:37,797 --> 01:13:41,077
Because of him, we will cook
like we've never cooked before.

970
01:13:53,557 --> 01:13:54,837
Gomez?

971
01:14:04,237 --> 01:14:05,677
He's gone.

972
01:14:36,917 --> 01:14:40,037
No, I'll just have water.

973
01:14:40,077 --> 01:14:42,517
You have to eat something.
It'll make you feel better.

974
01:14:42,597 --> 01:14:45,517
Oh, no.
My taste has died.

975
01:14:48,677 --> 01:14:51,517
What's gonna happen to them
now that he's gone?

976
01:14:51,557 --> 01:14:55,717
Some of these people have been
with me and Gomez for years.

977
01:14:56,717 --> 01:14:59,197
You know,
ever since Mom died...

978
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:02,397
you have been looking out
for everybody except for yourself.

979
01:15:02,437 --> 01:15:05,317
I mean, you need some time off.
Just slow down.

980
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:07,717
Slow down?
Why should I slow down?

981
01:15:09,077 --> 01:15:11,037
This should be
a wake-up call for you.

982
01:15:35,557 --> 01:15:36,517
Pa.

983
01:15:38,357 --> 01:15:40,597
Isn't there something,
¿qué me quieres decir?

984
01:15:41,557 --> 01:15:42,997
English or Spanish.

985
01:15:44,837 --> 01:15:48,317
What difference does it make
what language I'm speaking?

986
01:15:52,877 --> 01:15:55,357
Take the job
in Barcelona, Carmen.

987
01:15:55,437 --> 01:15:56,557
Hi.

988
01:15:57,917 --> 01:16:00,797
Come here,
you little thing you.

989
01:16:00,877 --> 01:16:02,917
Come over here.

990
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:04,477
That's it. Right up here.

991
01:16:06,237 --> 01:16:08,997
Come on, April. Mr. Naranjo
doesn't want to be bothered right now.

992
01:16:09,077 --> 01:16:13,557
No, it's all right.
She's just what I need right now.

993
01:16:20,157 --> 01:16:22,077
"Take the job in Barcelona."

994
01:16:23,117 --> 01:16:25,317
Is that all
you can manage to say?

995
01:16:27,277 --> 01:16:29,677
How about,
"How do you feel about this, Carmen?

996
01:16:31,237 --> 01:16:33,157
Is this what you
really want to do?"

997
01:16:33,237 --> 01:16:35,277
All right,
just calm down, Carmen.

998
01:16:36,957 --> 01:16:40,037
- You don't care.
- Care about what?

999
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:41,597
How I feel.

1000
01:16:43,397 --> 01:16:46,117
- What are you talking about?
- How I feel, Dad.

1001
01:16:48,357 --> 01:16:49,917
Gomez knew.

1002
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:54,677
He tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

1003
01:16:59,517 --> 01:17:00,837
What's the use?

1004
01:17:07,117 --> 01:17:09,637
Jeff? Please be home.

1005
01:17:11,157 --> 01:17:12,317
Carmen?

1006
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:15,197
I'm sorry for barging in.

1007
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:19,037
-Just hold me.
- What's wrong?

1008
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,917
I have so much I want
to talk to you about.

1009
01:17:21,957 --> 01:17:23,997
Carmen, listen--

1010
01:17:24,077 --> 01:17:25,157
Jeff?

1011
01:17:26,197 --> 01:17:28,157
I didn't know
we had company.

1012
01:17:34,437 --> 01:17:35,717
Sorry.

1013
01:17:35,757 --> 01:17:37,957
I guess I should have called first.

1014
01:17:40,397 --> 01:17:44,197
Just give me a minute, okay?
Please? Carmen.

1015
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,837
Stop, stop.

1016
01:17:47,877 --> 01:17:51,077
Okay? I'm sure
I mentioned Rachel to you before.

1017
01:17:51,157 --> 01:17:53,917
Maybe a couple of times, or maybe not.
I don't remember.

1018
01:17:53,957 --> 01:17:57,157
But it wasn't that serious...

1019
01:17:57,197 --> 01:17:58,677
until recently.

1020
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,517
Congratulations.

1021
01:18:03,197 --> 01:18:04,957
Are you gonna be okay?

1022
01:18:04,997 --> 01:18:07,517
Yeah. Of course
I'm gonna be all right.

1023
01:18:08,837 --> 01:18:09,917
It's fine.

1024
01:18:10,917 --> 01:18:15,477
I really came by to tell you that I
just accepted a new job in Barcelona.

1025
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:19,037
- I'm really looking forward to it.
- Great.

1026
01:18:26,757 --> 01:18:28,357
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1027
01:18:31,757 --> 01:18:34,517
I'll have the same.
So, what's up?

1028
01:18:35,717 --> 01:18:37,597
Nothing.

1029
01:18:37,637 --> 01:18:40,317
I was just thinking
about the trip because--

1030
01:18:40,357 --> 01:18:42,757
- Well, I am going.
- Yeah, I know.

1031
01:18:44,677 --> 01:18:46,077
I mean, it's perfect.

1032
01:18:46,157 --> 01:18:47,837
I speak the language, and...

1033
01:18:47,877 --> 01:18:50,877
who wouldn't want to live in
a beautiful city on the Mediterranean?

1034
01:18:50,957 --> 01:18:53,157
It's an incredible
business opportunity...

1035
01:18:53,197 --> 01:18:55,517
that no one in their right mind
would want to miss.

1036
01:18:57,957 --> 01:18:59,677
So I have to pack.

1037
01:18:59,717 --> 01:19:01,877
But I have no idea what to take.

1038
01:19:01,957 --> 01:19:04,877
So, what's the weather like
in Barcelona?

1039
01:19:05,837 --> 01:19:08,317
But we are not leaving
for at least another week.

1040
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:10,597
I know. But do I
need a converter?

1041
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:12,757
A converter?

1042
01:19:12,837 --> 01:19:16,317
What's the voltage like?
120? 240?

1043
01:19:17,237 --> 01:19:18,717
Are you okay?

1044
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:21,277
Yeah. Of course
I'm all right.

1045
01:19:34,357 --> 01:19:36,797
Do you know why we clink glasses
before drinking?

1046
01:19:37,957 --> 01:19:40,157
I'm not sure.
I never thought about it.

1047
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:42,477
It's so that
all the five senses are involved.

1048
01:19:43,677 --> 01:19:47,677
We touch the glass,
we smell the drink...

1049
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:50,517
we see its color,
we taste it.

1050
01:19:51,557 --> 01:19:55,517
Hearing is the only sense that doesn't
participate unless we create a sound.

1051
01:20:03,717 --> 01:20:05,077
Temperate.

1052
01:20:05,157 --> 01:20:06,997
Typical Mediterranean weather.

1053
01:20:07,077 --> 01:20:09,477
You'll need a coat
in the winter, though.

1054
01:20:09,557 --> 01:20:11,677
- Converter?
- Definitely.

1055
01:20:11,717 --> 01:20:14,557
One or two of them,
you know.

1056
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:39,837
- What are you doing here?
- Can I come in?

1057
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:42,717
Yeah.

1058
01:20:57,317 --> 01:20:59,197
Did you find your papers?

1059
01:20:59,237 --> 01:21:01,557
Yeah. I forgot
I'd hidden them myself.

1060
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:04,957
I didn't want you
to find them.

1061
01:21:06,117 --> 01:21:07,397
Why?

1062
01:21:08,717 --> 01:21:10,637
I applied to
the same college as you.

1063
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:11,717
What?

1064
01:21:11,797 --> 01:21:13,717
In case you changed
your mind about going...

1065
01:21:13,797 --> 01:21:15,997
I wanted to be able
to go with you.

1066
01:21:22,437 --> 01:21:25,757
- Did you get accepted?
- Yeah.

1067
01:21:25,837 --> 01:21:27,837
- What?
- Yeah.

1068
01:21:27,877 --> 01:21:31,357
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1069
01:21:31,437 --> 01:21:35,117
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What if I didn't get accepted?

1070
01:21:35,197 --> 01:21:38,757
- Then you would be an idiot.
- But I am an idiot.

1071
01:21:38,837 --> 01:21:40,117
True.

1072
01:21:49,717 --> 01:21:50,877
I almost got him!

1073
01:21:50,957 --> 01:21:52,957
I don't think I wanna eat that.

1074
01:22:30,877 --> 01:22:32,157
Dad?

1075
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:57,957
Let's go, April.

1076
01:22:58,037 --> 01:23:00,877
This is going to be
a memorable evening.

1077
01:23:00,957 --> 01:23:02,397
How do I look?

1078
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,357
I wonder why Martin
didn't remarry.

1079
01:23:05,437 --> 01:23:07,717
He's not physically impaired
in any way, is he?

1080
01:23:07,797 --> 01:23:09,277
I don't know.

1081
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,877
Anyway, did you sign up for that
computer class, Yolanda?

1082
01:23:11,957 --> 01:23:13,917
You have to think
about your future.

1083
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:16,997
You look great,
Grandma.

1084
01:23:17,037 --> 01:23:20,317
Mmm, chicken,
pork and lamb. Wow.

1085
01:23:20,357 --> 01:23:22,237
- What are we celebrating, anyway?
- Fate.

1086
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:24,157
We're celebrating fate tonight.

1087
01:23:24,197 --> 01:23:26,117
That's why I prepared
this special meal...

1088
01:23:26,157 --> 01:23:29,957
to celebrate the fate
that has brought us to this table.

1089
01:23:30,037 --> 01:23:31,917
I feel part of
the family already.

1090
01:23:31,997 --> 01:23:33,837
Well, you are.

1091
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:35,757
- To family.
- To family.

1092
01:23:35,837 --> 01:23:37,277
To family, my dear.

1093
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:40,917
Dad, should you
be drinking?

1094
01:23:43,717 --> 01:23:45,757
I can't think
of a better time to celebrate.

1095
01:23:45,797 --> 01:23:47,677
Why don't we eat first?

1096
01:23:47,717 --> 01:23:49,597
- Yeah.
- That's a good idea.

1097
01:23:49,637 --> 01:23:53,157
- Oh, Martin, the food looks delicious.
- Thank you, Hortensia.

1098
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:55,677
Someday you'll have
to let me cook for you.

1099
01:23:55,717 --> 01:23:58,957
I'm the one who taught Yolanda
her way around the kitchen.

1100
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:01,117
I'd like to do
a special toast...

1101
01:24:01,197 --> 01:24:03,197
to my father-in-law.

1102
01:24:03,277 --> 01:24:06,397
- To you, sir. Yes.
- That's nice.

1103
01:24:06,437 --> 01:24:07,677
Thank you.

1104
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:15,597
Now, I have
an announcement.

1105
01:24:24,077 --> 01:24:27,037
Leading our separate lives,
but under the same roof...

1106
01:24:27,117 --> 01:24:28,997
worrying and caring
for one another.

1107
01:24:29,037 --> 01:24:31,797
It's that caring-- it's what
makes us a familia, huh?

1108
01:24:31,877 --> 01:24:34,397
English or Spanish, Dad.

1109
01:24:35,877 --> 01:24:39,397
And families shouldn't keep secrets
from each other.

1110
01:24:40,237 --> 01:24:43,517
But I've kept one.

1111
01:24:43,557 --> 01:24:45,637
- Oh, dear.
- Because I...

1112
01:24:45,717 --> 01:24:48,317
I didn't want to burden you
with my personal affairs...

1113
01:24:48,357 --> 01:24:50,877
but now I can't
keep it any longer, so--

1114
01:24:53,477 --> 01:24:55,237
We'll talk some more después.

1115
01:24:56,477 --> 01:24:58,797
Please, Martin.
I can't eat a thing.

1116
01:24:58,877 --> 01:25:02,077
Just say what you
have to say, mi amor.

1117
01:25:05,557 --> 01:25:09,837
Every Sunday,
I have three angels sit at my table...

1118
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:13,117
in this casa
full of old memories.

1119
01:25:13,157 --> 01:25:16,357
And now my angelitas
are gonna go off into the world...

1120
01:25:16,397 --> 01:25:19,077
and create memories
of their own.

1121
01:25:20,757 --> 01:25:23,837
And I can either sit here by myself
or start a new life.

1122
01:25:26,277 --> 01:25:28,517
- I've sold the house.
- You sold the house?

1123
01:25:28,597 --> 01:25:30,917
- You did what, Dad?
- If I'm to start a new life...

1124
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:33,077
I had to,
but I bought a new one.

1125
01:25:33,157 --> 01:25:35,197
Oh! He bought
a new house. Well!

1126
01:25:35,277 --> 01:25:37,397
There'll be plenty of room
for visitors, so--

1127
01:25:37,477 --> 01:25:39,437
Here's to the new house, then.

1128
01:25:39,517 --> 01:25:42,277
- New house.
- To the new house.

1129
01:25:46,117 --> 01:25:48,837
- Is that it, dear?
- I hope that's it, 'cause I'm hungry.

1130
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:52,197
- Haven't you forgotten something?
- Hortensia...

1131
01:25:54,837 --> 01:25:57,597
I've gotten to know you
over the last few months.

1132
01:25:59,717 --> 01:26:01,117
Oh, my God, Carmen.

1133
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:03,517
I finally have the confidence
to say what I feel.

1134
01:26:09,477 --> 01:26:11,997
- Excuse me.
- Where's he going?

1135
01:26:15,237 --> 01:26:17,117
I had a complete physical.
That's the medical report.

1136
01:26:17,197 --> 01:26:19,117
- Leti, grab that.
- Medical report?

1137
01:26:19,197 --> 01:26:20,997
Take a look at it.

1138
01:26:21,077 --> 01:26:23,077
Why don't you
look at it, Carmen?

1139
01:26:23,157 --> 01:26:25,957
- Its says he's in excellent health.
- Of course he is.

1140
01:26:25,997 --> 01:26:28,157
Why wouldn't he be?

1141
01:26:31,637 --> 01:26:33,277
I'm glad to see...

1142
01:26:33,317 --> 01:26:35,317
that you're still
in good working order.

1143
01:26:37,397 --> 01:26:40,197
And I promise you
that as long as I live...

1144
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:42,917
I'll take good care
of your daughter and April.

1145
01:26:42,957 --> 01:26:46,237
I would expect nothing less
from a gentleman like you, Martin.

1146
01:26:46,277 --> 01:26:48,837
And you will always
be welcome in our house.

1147
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:50,717
Yes, of--

1148
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:53,637
What are you
talking about, mi amor?

1149
01:26:53,677 --> 01:26:56,997
Hortensia, will you
do me the honor...

1150
01:26:58,437 --> 01:27:00,397
of giving me...

1151
01:27:00,477 --> 01:27:02,757
your daughter's hand
in marriage?

1152
01:27:04,437 --> 01:27:07,077
Dad!
Stop drinking.

1153
01:27:07,157 --> 01:27:09,877
Martin, just take
a few deep breaths.

1154
01:27:09,957 --> 01:27:11,797
You got a little confused.
Start again.

1155
01:27:11,877 --> 01:27:15,757
Yes, yes. I was confused,
but not anymore.

1156
01:27:15,837 --> 01:27:18,917
No. I forgot to ask
the woman in question.

1157
01:27:19,957 --> 01:27:21,277
What?

1158
01:27:22,997 --> 01:27:26,597
Yolanda,
will you marry me?

1159
01:27:27,557 --> 01:27:28,677
What?

1160
01:27:34,117 --> 01:27:37,077
- Dad, don't you mean Hortensia?
- Of course he does.

1161
01:27:37,157 --> 01:27:39,317
The hell I do.
I mean Yolanda.

1162
01:27:39,397 --> 01:27:41,437
Yolanda, what is
he talking about?

1163
01:27:41,477 --> 01:27:44,157
Does this mean
you're gonna be my dad?

1164
01:27:44,197 --> 01:27:46,757
- No!
- That's up to your mom.

1165
01:27:46,837 --> 01:27:49,557
Well, I forbid you
to do this, Yolanda!

1166
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:52,037
I'm a grown woman, Mother.

1167
01:27:52,797 --> 01:27:54,557
I forbid it, I said.

1168
01:28:01,517 --> 01:28:03,917
Your father and I
love each other very much.

1169
01:28:06,677 --> 01:28:10,077
Yes, Martin,
I will marry you.

1170
01:28:13,437 --> 01:28:14,557
All right!

1171
01:28:19,557 --> 01:28:20,957
To Dad and Yoli!

1172
01:28:21,757 --> 01:28:24,317
I can't believe you guys
never noticed them before.

1173
01:28:24,397 --> 01:28:27,037
- You knew?
- Yeah.

1174
01:28:28,997 --> 01:28:30,637
- Grandma!
- Mom!

1175
01:28:30,717 --> 01:28:32,637
Somebody,
pick that woman up.

1176
01:28:33,677 --> 01:28:35,037
Give her some air.

1177
01:28:35,077 --> 01:28:38,677
- Get her some air.
- Open the door.

1178
01:28:38,757 --> 01:28:41,277
- It's okay. Mom, you're all right.
- Unzip her dress.

1179
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:43,637
- Don't you touch me, you pervert!
- "Pervert"?

1180
01:28:43,717 --> 01:28:46,597
You should be ashamed
of yourself. All of you!

1181
01:28:46,677 --> 01:28:48,837
Let her catch her breath.

1182
01:28:48,917 --> 01:28:51,597
- Mom? Are you all right?
- What kind of a family is this?

1183
01:28:51,677 --> 01:28:55,157
- Get away!
- Is anybody gonna eat?

1184
01:28:57,957 --> 01:28:59,117
Bravo.

1185
01:29:03,597 --> 01:29:04,797
Some water?

1186
01:29:11,677 --> 01:29:13,517
I should take her home.

1187
01:29:13,597 --> 01:29:15,837
- She gonna be all right?
- She'll be fine.

1188
01:29:15,877 --> 01:29:17,917
Good.
Are you gonna be all right?

1189
01:29:17,997 --> 01:29:19,997
I'll be fine.

1190
01:29:28,077 --> 01:29:31,917
You won't admit you love me

1191
01:29:31,997 --> 01:29:33,597
And so

1192
01:29:33,677 --> 01:29:35,757
How am I ever

1193
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:38,677
To know

1194
01:29:38,757 --> 01:29:41,477
You always tell me

1195
01:29:41,517 --> 01:29:44,917
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

1196
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:50,957
I should go.

1197
01:30:18,437 --> 01:30:20,317
Here, let me help you.

1198
01:30:25,757 --> 01:30:26,877
Here.

1199
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:31,637
- Dad--
- It's a set of some of my knives.

1200
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:35,077
Some of them,
for your new kitchen.

1201
01:30:37,957 --> 01:30:40,157
- Thank you.
- You better put 'em in your bag...

1202
01:30:40,197 --> 01:30:42,157
because you'll never
get past security.

1203
01:30:48,637 --> 01:30:50,557
If you need anything...

1204
01:30:50,637 --> 01:30:53,677
anything at all,
you call, hmm?

1205
01:30:53,757 --> 01:30:55,997
If you can't get
decent chipotles in Europe...

1206
01:30:56,037 --> 01:30:58,677
I'll send some air express.

1207
01:31:01,477 --> 01:31:05,757
All right, go, Carmen.
You're gonna miss your plane. Bye.

1208
01:31:42,437 --> 01:31:44,837
Am I hallucinating, or are we
having a pleasant dinner?

1209
01:31:46,717 --> 01:31:48,757
"How do you feel about this, Carmen?

1210
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,157
Is this what you really want to do?"

1211
01:31:54,237 --> 01:31:57,597
He wanted to,
and I wanted to, too...

1212
01:31:57,637 --> 01:32:00,037
and we really wanted
to do it properly, Dad, but--

1213
01:32:00,072 --> 01:32:02,437
and we really wanted
to do it properly, Dad, but--

1214
01:32:07,077 --> 01:32:08,477
Dad?

1215
01:32:11,397 --> 01:32:12,757
Dad?

1216
01:32:20,437 --> 01:32:22,277
Barcelona can wait.

1217
01:32:41,277 --> 01:32:42,397
All right?

1218
01:32:44,797 --> 01:32:46,397
Chicken pibil.

1219
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:49,837
But I wanted you
to taste my version.

1220
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:52,557
- All right.
- Yeah?

1221
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:54,517
Here we go.

1222
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:11,397
It's exquisito!

1223
01:33:14,037 --> 01:33:16,077
You're good.
You're very good, Carmen.

1224
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:17,277
Thank you.

1225
01:33:17,317 --> 01:33:20,517
Yeah, but the serranos
is too sharp, too sharp.

1226
01:33:20,597 --> 01:33:23,037
Next time,
not so much zest.

1227
01:33:24,077 --> 01:33:26,917
I think that it's better.
It's a little more interesting.

1228
01:33:28,237 --> 01:33:30,197
What?
What's wrong?

1229
01:33:32,597 --> 01:33:33,917
I can taste.

1230
01:33:38,757 --> 01:33:41,397
I can smell
and I can taste.

1231
01:33:53,637 --> 01:33:54,557
Wait, wait, wait.
One more thing.

1232
01:33:54,592 --> 01:33:55,477
Wait, wait, wait.
One more thing.

1233
01:33:55,557 --> 01:33:57,517
There you go, Gavin.
Thank you.

1234
01:33:57,597 --> 01:33:59,717
- Hey, Rock, how's it coming there?
- My table's waiting.

1235
01:33:59,797 --> 01:34:01,957
Table 22, you guys.
Extra special treatment, please.

1236
01:34:01,997 --> 01:34:03,957
Very important people.

1237
01:34:04,037 --> 01:34:07,677
Looking good. All right.
All right, wait, wait. Okay.

1238
01:34:07,717 --> 01:34:09,597
There we go.
All right, you guys.

1239
01:34:09,637 --> 01:34:12,997
Careful on the lobster, okay?
Only two more minutes, please.

1240
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:20,957
Hi. How are you doing?
It's good to see you.

1241
01:34:21,957 --> 01:34:23,077
Good. Everything okay?

1242
01:34:31,157 --> 01:34:33,677
- Tonight's lobster.
- Oh, that looks so good.

1243
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:38,837
- Carmen.
- What?

1244
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:40,477
- The lobster.
- What, Dad?

1245
01:34:40,517 --> 01:34:41,877
Are you doing it in a--

1246
01:34:41,957 --> 01:34:45,237
You need to sit down, have a bite,
and then you can criticize it.

1247
01:34:45,317 --> 01:34:48,317
- All right, all right.
