1
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:21,669
(boy) Somebody help me! I can't swim!

2
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,839
Get the raft!

3
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,250
Somebody help me!

4
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,643
(gasps)

5
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:52,502
What is that?

6
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,586
(dark-haired boy) It's a glow stick.

7
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,886
How does it work?

8
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,886
From some kind of chemical.

9
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,936
(birds call)

10
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:17,693
Do you think anybody else is here, sir?

11
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:21,526
It's just an island. There's nothing here.

12
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,750
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah, me too. I'm hungry.

13
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:33,414
What if there's no water?

14
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:36,920
We're all thirsty and we're all hungry.

15
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,972
We should just try and get some sleep.

16
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,678
And tomorrow we'll figure out
what we're gonna do.

17
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,842
(whispers) Water.

18
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:24,018
Water.

19
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,545
Sir. Sir.

20
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,132
I found water.

21
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,855
(boy) Well, that's it, Colonel.

22
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,051
What's that?

23
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,846
It's a conch.

24
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:57,728
My granny had one.

25
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:04,059
If it had a hole in it right there
you could really blow it, like a trumpet.

26
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,040
Come on! Give us some.

27
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,965
(coughs)

28
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,261
Sh! Come on.

29
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:39,475
(snorting)

30
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:47,404
(horn-like sound)

31
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:50,991
(horn-like sound)

32
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,797
(horn-like sound)

33
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:26,988
(horn-like sound)

34
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:35,994
OK, listen up. Whoever holds the conch
gets to speak. That's the rule.

35
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,167
Is this like assembly, sir?

36
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:41,915
Yeah. Except anybody
who wants to speak gets to.

37
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,339
But not before they get the conch.

38
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,428
Right. There doesn't seem
to be anybody here except us.

39
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,717
- And a pig.
- It was a wild boar.

40
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:55,056
No, it was a regular pig. Big, but regular.

41
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,310
A regular pig must have
got here from people.

42
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:01,148
Yeah. If there's pigs, there's people.

43
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,357
OK, cadets. Like I said,
this island's probably uninhabited.

44
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:10,907
- We don't know. We've gotta explore.
- (dark-haired boy) There's a lot to do.

45
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,043
But the main thing is, we're not
by ourselves. We got Captain Benson.

46
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,211
Can I speak?

47
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:26,422
The most important thing is,
who knows we're here?

48
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:31,053
Nobody knows we're here.
They know where we were going.

49
00:12:31,187 --> 00:12:35,315
But they don't know where we are.
We never got where we were going.

50
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:39,439
- (small boy) Where were we going?
- We were going home.

51
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:41,480
(groaning)

52
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:46,197
(dark-haired boy) I'm sure they're looking.

53
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:49,863
We should set up some kind
of steady signal, like a fire,

54
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:54,626
and keep it going all the time.
And we're gonna have to have rules.

55
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,960
(Captain Benson coughs)

56
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:03,047
Can I have the conch?

57
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:08,214
Yes, Ralph's right.
We've definitely gotta make a fire.

58
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:12,017
- Sir, are you the leader?
- Jack's the oldest.

59
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:15,517
- But Ralph's the colonel.
- I think it should be Ralph.

60
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:18,403
- I vote for Ralph.
- Yeah, he's a colonel.

61
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,902
- Yeah, Ralph.
- He's the colonel. Ralph.

62
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:25,742
- I guess you just won the election.
- It doesn't matter who's in charge.

63
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,999
We've just gotta work together.
First, we build a camp.

64
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:50,393
Be careful.

65
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:57,361
There's probably a lot of berries and
things that look OK but are really poison.

66
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,896
I know what's poisonous or not.

67
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:05,110
My brother did Outward Bound,
learned how to survive. He taught me.

68
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:09,411
Did he do Outward Bound in the tropics?

69
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:12,117
- Not exactly.
- Then where?

70
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:14,791
Colorado.

71
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:20,132
There are totally different poison plants
in Colorado than in this place.

72
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:23,798
So we've gotta take precautions
or it won't matter.

73
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:27,884
- What won't matter?
- Whether we get rescued.

74
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:32,233
Better learn to live with yourself,
because we ain't gonna get rescued.

75
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,610
- What are you talking about?
- Just being logical.

76
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:41,243
A plane goes down in the ocean, there's
no wreckage - who's gonna find us?

77
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:45,497
- Why don't you just shut up?
- Are you telling me to shut up?

78
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:50,701
What we need around here is positive
people, not people trying to scare people.

79
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:53,245
What we don't need is you, shitbrain.

80
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:56,467
(boy) His name's not shitbrain. It's Piggy.

81
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:58,752
Yeah, Piggy! Yeah!

82
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,049
(boy snorts like a pig)

83
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:06,185
Shut up. Everybody just shut up.

84
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:13,559
- It's just cos you're new.
- No, it's not. It's always this way.

85
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:16,483
(Ralph) Just cut it out, OK?

86
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:22,074
- (boy chants) Mama, mama, can't you see
- (all chant) Mama, mama, can't you see

87
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:26,155
- What the army's done to me?
- What the army's done to me?

88
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,160
- They put me in a barber's chair.
- They put me in a barber's chair.

89
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:34,046
- Spun me round, I had no hair.
- Spun me round, I had no hair.

90
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:37,960
- I used to drive a Cadillac.
- I used to drive a Cadillac.

91
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:41,965
- Now I'm marching in a pack.
- Now I'm marching in a pack.

92
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:45,636
- I used to drive a Chevrolet.
- I used to drive a Chevrolet.

93
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:49,604
- Now I'm marching for my pay.
- Now I'm marching for my pay.

94
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:53,400
- They took away my TV.
- They took away my TV.

95
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,315
- Got me doing lOT.
- Got me doing lOT.

96
00:15:57,451 --> 00:16:01,319
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

97
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,495
(boy) Whoa, oh, oh.

98
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:10,331
- Come on, let me try.
- I got it, I got it.

99
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,544
Shit!

100
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:17,086
- Damn! Mother...
- Swearing won't help.

101
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:21,268
- Listen, Piggy, shut your fat ass.
- Hold it! Hold it!

102
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:25,890
Hey, wait a minute.
Piggy, give me your glasses.

103
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,645
- Hey, give 'em back.
- Trust me.

104
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:31,446
What are you doing?

105
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,224
- Fire!
- (all) Yeah!

106
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:25,288
(Ralph) Jesus, it's spreading!
Put it out. Stomp on it.

107
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,672
Come on, run and stomp on it.

108
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:34,304
Beat it back. Use your jacket.

109
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:37,931
Beat it back. Come on, guys, beat it back.

110
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:05,063
About time you showed up. People ought
to be fined for being late for fire watch.

111
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,023
Bullshit.

112
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,504
(Jack) The forest was totally dark,

113
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:26,546
but he had to keep going
because the thing was behind him.

114
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,465
The pus was everywhere.

115
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:36,015
He could feel it and, all the while,
the thing behind him kept coming closer.

116
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:39,100
And then, suddenly,

117
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:44,773
he realised it wasn't any normal plants
or bushes he was trying to run through.

118
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:48,488
It wasn't the leaves or plants
brushing up against him,

119
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:51,109
touching his arms and face.

120
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:55,623
It was thousands of claws,
long claws, grasping at him,

121
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,036
trying to stop him
and hold him for the thing.

122
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:04,592
And he tried to get away, but they held on,
choking him. He tried to scream. Argh!

123
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,758
(screams)

124
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:14,426
It's only a story.

125
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:17,136
It's not real.

126
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:24,231
(Ralph) I don't know if he can hold up.
What if he suddenly gets really sick?

127
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:28,612
(Jack) Man, you gotta stop worrying
so much. We got it made.

128
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:33,572
No parents, no teachers,
no academy, no girls.

129
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,199
Of course, I wouldn't mind getting a little.

130
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:40,879
- Like you ever got any.
- Well, I still wouldn't mind.

131
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:51,180
Oh! My arm.

132
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,801
You OK?

133
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:55,978
Psych!

134
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:33,265
Nearly got him. Next time.

135
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,445
Do you think it has any protein in it?

136
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:44,909
Here, give it here.

137
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,503
I heard they're supposed
to taste like chicken.

138
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:36,418
Want some?

139
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,399
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yeah.

140
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:57,936
- We don't believe you.
- Yeah, you're lying.

141
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:02,281
Why aren't you getting ready?

142
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,783
(boy) Sir, is it really true?

143
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:09,456
You bet it is. Simon's right.
We're gonna be rescued.

144
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:14,412
Get your things together, guys.
We're going home.

145
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:35,794
I...

146
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:41,756
(Captain Benson groans)

147
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,307
(groans)

148
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:56,988
(Ralph) Beat it, you kids.

149
00:24:57,117 --> 00:25:01,246
Come on. Why isn't anybody
getting food or wood?

150
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,124
(yells)

151
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,663
- Spit! Come on!
- Come on! Spit!

152
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,498
- Spit!
- Go on, spit!

153
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,786
- Spit.
- I got it. There it is.

154
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:50,871
No, you're not gonna get out
until I see it splash in the ocean.

155
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:55,137
- That made it.
- No, I didn't see it splash.

156
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,558
- Ow!
- See? It splashed again.

157
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,600
Ha! It's our turn to have fun.

158
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,483
Assembly!

159
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:22,789
What's going on?

160
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,086
The reason I'm calling
this assembly is,

161
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:32,636
too many people are screwing around and
not working. There's a bunch of things.

162
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:35,254
Some kids don't know
when to use the bathroom.

163
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,060
There was this one kid the other day,

164
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:40,890
he took a shit in his pants
and then sat in it.

165
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:45,980
I'm not naming names
cos it's possible Mikey couldn't help it.

166
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:51,946
Was it green? Was it running
down your legs?

167
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:55,195
Everybody shut their goddamn mouths!

168
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:58,365
Ralph's got the conch.

169
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,169
All I mean is, we have
to have more discipline.

170
00:27:02,294 --> 00:27:05,379
And more spearfishing.
We've gotta have real food.

171
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:10,215
- (boy) We should be hunting pigs.
- That's all I got to say.

172
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:14,425
- Anyone else want the conch?
- Some jerk-off stole my pocketknife.

173
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:17,131
Yeah, things are disappearing all over.

174
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:20,934
- What are we gonna do with thieves?
- Kick the shit out of them.

175
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:25,015
- Shove their dick in the conch!
- Put a stick up their butt.

176
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:27,940
- Ram it in there!
- OK, OK!

177
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:33,450
(Ralph) We can't have kids
stealing and running wild.

178
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:39,083
We're gonna have to have stricter rules.
And hand out demerits, I guess.

179
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:41,166
- Demerits!
- Demerits?

180
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,667
Demerits for grand larceny?

181
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:46,834
- Eat shit and die.
- Yeah!

182
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:55,391
Sir?

183
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:58,511
Are we ever going home?

184
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:02,431
Of course we are,
as soon as they see our signal.

185
00:28:02,568 --> 00:28:06,566
Jack says that we're never
gonna be rescued.

186
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:10,615
No, you misunderstood him.
That's not what he meant.

187
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:14,693
That's exactly what I meant.
There's eight million islands out here.

188
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:18,449
Why should they find this one?

189
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:22,583
Don't listen to him.
We will be rescued, Peter.

190
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:25,003
Honest.

191
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:39,478
Are you going hunting for pigs again?
I wanna come next time.

192
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,482
Me too.

193
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:45,948
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

194
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:05,631
Hey, cut it out.

195
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,263
Are you crazy? Stop it.

196
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:18,481
You know why Jack got sent
to military school?

197
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:22,227
- Because he was in trouble.
- Who says?

198
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:26,859
Tony. Jack told him he took a car
and drove it on the highway.

199
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:31,738
- He's a liar. He didn't steal a car.
- He didn't say he stole it.

200
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:34,114
He borrowed it. It was a neighbour's.

201
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:39,209
And the neighbour was away and he just
borrowed it and drove it on the highway.

202
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:42,790
He probably rode his dad's bicycle
around the block.

203
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:46,342
- Then how come he got arrested?
- Yeah, by the highway patrol.

204
00:29:46,472 --> 00:29:49,259
They got him doing 80.

205
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,395
Ugh!

206
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:57,019
Ugh!

207
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:09,366
What time is it?

208
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:12,166
What difference does it make?

209
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:17,452
Well, if I knew what time it was
I'd know what's on TV.

210
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:24,381
- I'm not even sure what day it is.
- It's Monday.

211
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:29,390
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

212
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:32,436
Mondays. Monday's ALF.

213
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:38,020
ALF comes on at eight o'clock.
It's a lot later than eight.

214
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:42,447
Yeah. But I bet we're in
a different time zone.

215
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:48,577
I bet it's really about eight o'clock and
ALF's causing some trouble right now.

216
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:50,532
Yeah.

217
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:19,524
(Jack) They're mean and they move fast.
They ain't gonna be easy to kill.

218
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:26,406
- You gotta get 'em first time, in the heart.
- I guess the spear's gotta be real sharp.

219
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:30,750
We have to have a strategy.
You know, trick 'em.

220
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:33,546
Oh, sure. How we supposed to do that?

221
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:37,585
You just smoke 'em out.
You crawl up, light a little fire.

222
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:40,801
We have to practise on stuff that moves.

223
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:44,424
Ew.

224
00:31:45,392 --> 00:31:47,717
Jesus Christ.

225
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:16,796
When do we do it?
I mean, like, what time of day?

226
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:21,255
You always go right before dawn.
Maybe you can catch 'em asleep.

227
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,216
(panting)

228
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,728
Simon!

229
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:53,166
Simon can't stay with him
every single second.

230
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:54,923
Sh.

231
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:59,383
And he's scared of everyone else.

232
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:05,303
I'm scared of him. He's crazy.
We've gotta do something.

233
00:33:05,436 --> 00:33:09,387
- (Ralph) Maybe we should tie him down.
- (Jack) That or get rid of him.

234
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:14,317
Come on. He's hurt bad and he has
a fever. We've gotta take care of him.

235
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:18,230
(Roger) Why bother?
He ain't gonna make it.

236
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:22,579
- We've gotta take care of ourselves.
- Exactly.

237
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:03,699
(gasps)

238
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,122
(Ralph) Captain Benson!

239
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:51,297
(Simon) Captain!

240
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,968
Captain Benson!

241
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:10,234
Captain Benson!

242
00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:14,364
(Ralph) Save your breath, man.

243
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:18,621
He's gotta be close by.
He's probably just lost.

244
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,545
Look.

245
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:45,149
(Ralph) It's nobody's fault, Simon.
He just didn't know what he was doing.

246
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:49,488
I don't think it's what you think.
I don't think he's dead.

247
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,568
- Why not?
- Where are his shoes?

248
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,859
We've gotta keep looking.

249
00:35:54,995 --> 00:35:57,664
He just swam out in 'em.

250
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:02,498
And his belt? He left his pants
and swam out in his shoes and belt?

251
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,297
He was crazy, Simon.

252
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,703
(grunting)

253
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:41,407
- There it is! Get it!
- Get it!

254
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:45,336
- Kill it!
- Yeah!

255
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:56,057
(Jack) Roger, are you OK, man?
That was some jump.

256
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:59,056
I got him right up his ass.

257
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:02,901
- Right up the ass!
- Yeah!

258
00:37:07,823 --> 00:37:11,074
- Get him! Get him!
- Yeah!

259
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:14,203
Hey, come on! Cut it out! Stop it!

260
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:22,796
- You dorks. It hurt.
- I know it hurt.

261
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:37,159
I've been thinking about a clock.
We could make a clock.

262
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:40,166
Yeah, sure, Piggy. Then a TV.

263
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:44,925
No, really. We could make a sundial
with a stick in the ground.

264
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:48,261
What's that noise?

265
00:38:51,852 --> 00:38:53,892
(whirring)

266
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:58,185
- Look, there it is!
- Help!

267
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:00,725
Over here!

268
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:04,065
- Help!
- Please!

269
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:28,386
Over here!

270
00:39:28,642 --> 00:39:30,551
Over here!

271
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:33,518
Over here!

272
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:38,815
Over here!

273
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:41,944
Over here!

274
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:15,182
If you guys hadn't let the fire go out
they would have seen it.

275
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:18,568
- Hey, man, we were hunting.
- Great. Killed a pig.

276
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:21,567
Face it, you fucked up.
We could have been rescued.

277
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:25,115
Back off, man.
I'm sick of your shit and so's my gang.

278
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:27,570
Your gang?
What's that supposed to mean?

279
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:32,748
It means that if you know what's good for
you you'll stop trying to run everything.

280
00:40:34,546 --> 00:40:37,120
Stop it!

281
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:49,724
I'm sick of this. I'm gonna make a camp
for hunters and guys who wanna have fun.

282
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:51,135
(gang) Yeah!

283
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:54,440
Come on, that's crazy.
We've gotta work together.

284
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:58,569
- Come on, what do you say?
- I say fuck you.

285
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:01,367
And that goes for you too, Miss Piggy.

286
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:05,277
Come on, let's get out
of this kindergarten.

287
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:17,211
- I'm with you, Jack.
- Right on, Larry.

288
00:41:17,343 --> 00:41:23,013
When you other brats get older or get
hungry enough, you can come join us too.

289
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:40,949
They're back! Simon, they're back!

290
00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:44,785
(loud bang)

291
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,952
Are you all right?
It's only a storm.

292
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:53,918
(thud)

293
00:41:56,593 --> 00:42:00,426
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

294
00:42:00,556 --> 00:42:04,091
He must be in the other shelter.

295
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:12,563
Quick, get out of there!
That tree's gonna go!

296
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,175
(boy screams)

297
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,970
Help me!

298
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,019
Over here!

299
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,666
Help!

300
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,093
Where are the others?

301
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,263
I don't know.

302
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,892
(boy screams)

303
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:31,863
Peter, where are you?

304
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:14,073
Ralph!

305
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:18,455
(Ralph in distance) Yeah?

306
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,263
Where are you?

307
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:39,432
(Ralph) Over here.

308
00:44:45,442 --> 00:44:48,397
(Piggy) Wait. Wait for me.

309
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,569
Well, come on.

310
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,077
- Where'd you get that from?
- (boy) Right here.

311
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,880
(Piggy) Ralph!

312
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,094
- Yeah?
- Over here. We found fruit.

313
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:32,655
Do you think the other guys are OK?

314
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:36,997
- Who cares?
- OK, dork. I was just asking.

315
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:43,713
We should relight the fire.

316
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:06,862
- Gross.
- (boy) Where are they?

317
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:10,607
(boy#2) If they didn't get blown away
they're probably hunting.

318
00:46:10,743 --> 00:46:16,248
What good will that do? They can't cook
pigs without a fire. They'll get trichinosis.

319
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:19,826
- What's that?
- It's bugs that live in pigs.

320
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:24,045
We knew that.

321
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,255
- (groans)
- (screams)

322
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,569
What's this shit about a monster?
We'll send you back to kindergarten.

323
00:49:17,695 --> 00:49:21,146
- I'm serious.
- OK, what kind of monster?

324
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:25,494
Did it have fur and poisoned fangs,
or long, slimy tentacles?

325
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,914
It growled and it came out at me.
And its mouth, it was wet.

326
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:33,208
- Maybe it was a bear.
- Sounds more like a reptile.

327
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,291
Sounds more like bullshit.

328
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:58,272
(groaning)

329
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,618
(groaning)

330
00:50:29,564 --> 00:50:31,936
- We heard it all right.
- Yeah.

331
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:34,938
Whatever it is, it's in there.

332
00:50:55,926 --> 00:50:59,461
You should have seen it.
He was scared shitless.

333
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:04,306
Do you think there was something there?
Some kind of wild animal or something?

334
00:51:04,435 --> 00:51:08,848
- I know it. We heard it growl.
- Is it close?

335
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:12,980
Just over the big rise
behind our camp. Real close.

336
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,151
Holy shit.

337
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,574
- I just thought you ought to know.
- Yeah.

338
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,791
Thanks for the fire.

339
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,045
(Roger) Here come the reserves.

340
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:41,098
- Better keep on your toes tonight.
- What do you mean?

341
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:43,930
- You'll find out.
- What are you doing with that?

342
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:48,474
Next time we kill a pig,
we're gonna have a barbecue.

343
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:55,064
- You mean no one's on fire watch?
- Why can't we have the fire down here?

344
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:58,449
If we want anybody to see the smoke
it's gotta be up there.

345
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:01,115
Nobody wants to be
up there alone any more.

346
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:04,616
There's something loose
on this island - a monster.

347
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,621
- There's no monster.
- There's something.

348
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:12,794
- (Piggy) So what do you want?
- Jack wants the survival knife.

349
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:14,965
It's not his. It belongs to the camp.

350
00:52:15,095 --> 00:52:18,298
Yeah? Well, there's a new camp now,
and he wants it.

351
00:52:18,432 --> 00:52:21,349
Yeah, and Tony wants his shoes,
socks and his junk.

352
00:52:21,477 --> 00:52:24,098
Take Tony's stuff
but you can't have the knife.

353
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:29,473
- He's a defector. Another damn defector.
- It's because of the monster.

354
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,062
I told you there's no monster.
Tony knows there's no monster.

355
00:52:33,198 --> 00:52:37,361
Tony just wants to be a hunter
and he's too chickenshit to get his stuff.

356
00:52:37,494 --> 00:52:40,115
But what if there is
some kind of big animal?

357
00:52:40,247 --> 00:52:41,907
Yeah.

358
00:52:56,473 --> 00:53:00,222
(Piggy) Oh, great. Two more traitors.

359
00:53:00,352 --> 00:53:02,641
Sorry, Ralph.

360
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:05,476
(Piggy) Good riddance.

361
00:53:45,776 --> 00:53:47,401
Sh.

362
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,360
(twig snaps)

363
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:04,334
(hunters shout)

364
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,964
(Jack) Go on! Get the knife! Get the knife!

365
00:54:15,058 --> 00:54:17,893
(Ralph) Bring that back!
You have no right!

366
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:22,765
Get back here! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

367
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:34,906
(Piggy whimpers)

368
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:37,410
(sobs) Oh, God!

369
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:41,123
They broke my glasses.

370
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,918
Anyone who wants to come up has to ask.

371
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:26,836
- Where are the others?
- They're hunting.

372
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:30,930
Where's that cave you found?

373
00:55:33,184 --> 00:55:36,019
- Don't you know?
- Yeah, but I'm not going back.

374
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:39,514
- I already showed Jack and the others.
- Tell me where it is.

375
00:55:39,649 --> 00:55:41,642
You shouldn't go there.

376
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:45,477
I just want to look. I've got a glow stick.

377
00:55:47,074 --> 00:55:49,944
It's over there in the forest.

378
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,444
(Jack) Put it here.

379
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:32,240
Sharpen a stick at both ends.

380
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:16,663
This is a present for the monster.

381
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,542
(shouting and whooping)

382
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:45,883
OK, Rambo, you've made your point.
What do you want?

383
00:58:46,017 --> 00:58:48,769
We killed a pig today.
There's going to be a feast.

384
00:58:48,895 --> 00:58:51,730
You can all come eat
with us if you want to.

385
00:58:51,857 --> 00:58:57,148
- (whispers) Go on. Now.
- (all) The chief has spoken.

386
00:58:57,279 --> 00:58:59,319
(Jack) See you tonight, girls.

387
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,843
(Jack) Count.
Cadence delay. Cadence count.

388
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:08,512
- (hunters) Whoa, one.
- (Jack) Airborne rangers!

389
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,190
- Two.
- Better do your best!

390
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:11,941
- Three.
- Or you'll find yourself...

391
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:13,646
- Four.
- In front leaving rest.

392
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:14,478
- One.
- Hit it.

393
01:00:14,613 --> 01:00:15,312
- Two.
- Hit it.

394
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:16,193
- Three.
- Hit it.

395
01:00:16,323 --> 01:00:17,022
- Four.
- Hit it.

396
01:00:17,157 --> 01:00:20,242
(hunters) One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

397
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:22,942
We like it here. We love it here.
We finally found a home.

398
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,574
- (boy) A what?
- (hunters) A home.

399
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:28,835
- A what?
- A home away from home. Huh!

400
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:46,226
(thunderclap)

401
01:01:09,714 --> 01:01:12,549
Luke, take them some meat.

402
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,466
I promised I'd get meat.

403
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:18,636
Didn't l, Ralph?

404
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:25,306
I want you to tell the little ones that
I made you a promise and I kept it. Say it!

405
01:01:25,439 --> 01:01:28,061
You kept your promise
but not the fire watch.

406
01:01:28,192 --> 01:01:33,353
You think one meal is worth not getting
rescued? We've gotta be one group again.

407
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,906
I agree. You can join my camp
and have all the meat you want.

408
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:39,656
We don't want your meat.

409
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:42,409
(Jack) Oh, yeah. Then why'd you come?

410
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:45,459
(Ralph) We came to try
and talk some sense to you.

411
01:01:45,586 --> 01:01:48,159
You don't have the conch.

412
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:51,002
The conch is in our camp,
where it belongs.

413
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:54,585
What's the matter, tits?
Were you afraid to bring it with you?

414
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:57,390
- The conch doesn't count any more.
- Stop that!

415
01:01:57,515 --> 01:01:59,841
Nobody's interested in you
and your conch.

416
01:01:59,976 --> 01:02:06,181
Take your fat friend and shove off.
You've had all the meat you can eat.

417
01:02:06,317 --> 01:02:08,689
Come on, hunters!

418
01:02:10,321 --> 01:02:12,361
Roger's the pig!

419
01:03:11,345 --> 01:03:13,919
(Roger yells)

420
01:04:19,585 --> 01:04:23,168
Come on, hunters! Billy's the monster!

421
01:04:49,743 --> 01:04:53,741
The monster!
It's the real monster! Kill him!

422
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:31,033
(thunderclap)

423
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,971
What are we gonna do?

424
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:58,812
Piggy, that was Simon.

425
01:06:00,987 --> 01:06:05,364
What good are you doing
talking about it? It was dark.

426
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:09,196
- We were scared.
- I wasn't scared.

427
01:06:09,329 --> 01:06:13,197
You were scared.
Anything could have happened.

428
01:06:16,545 --> 01:06:18,752
It wasn't our fault.

429
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:23,377
It was. We were there
and we didn't do anything about it.

430
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:27,924
There was nothing we could do.
There was too many of them.

431
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:31,474
- That's not the point.
- It was an accident.

432
01:06:31,603 --> 01:06:35,103
That's what it was - a terrible accident.

433
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:48,742
- Hi.
- Hi.

434
01:06:51,249 --> 01:06:54,001
We came here to see
if you guys have any fire.

435
01:06:54,127 --> 01:06:56,167
Ours is out.

436
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:02,255
- Everything's out.
- On account of the storm.

437
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:08,177
We gotta get back.

438
01:07:09,686 --> 01:07:12,094
Hold on a minute.

439
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:14,900
I wanna talk to you about last night.

440
01:07:15,025 --> 01:07:16,305
Ralph.

441
01:07:18,529 --> 01:07:21,067
We left early.

442
01:07:21,198 --> 01:07:24,069
(both) We were real tired.

443
01:07:39,093 --> 01:07:41,548
- It isn't fair.
- I never touched it.

444
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,217
- He didn't.
- (Roger) Butt out, or you'll get it.

445
01:07:44,348 --> 01:07:48,560
From now on, any more criminals
are gonna be put on that island to starve.

446
01:07:48,686 --> 01:07:52,684
- Give it to him. Whip him.
- Now you're gonna get it.

447
01:07:52,816 --> 01:07:54,855
(all shout) Yeah!

448
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:12,414
(boy yells in pain)

449
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:22,212
I'll get fire, I promise you.
Tomorrow we'll hunt again.

450
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:26,049
But we have to be careful
cos the monster might come any time.

451
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,178
But didn't we... I thought we...

452
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:32,180
No. It could come again any time,
in any shape.

453
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:35,900
Just when we're not ready,
it could be there.

454
01:09:00,305 --> 01:09:04,849
(Piggy) Maybe we should
just build a raft and row off.

455
01:09:06,228 --> 01:09:09,562
(Ralph) I will if you will.

456
01:09:12,151 --> 01:09:16,814
- Well?
- We don't really know what's out there.

457
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:20,649
I bet you out past the reef
lots of boats come by every day,

458
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,909
and one of them could rescue us.

459
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:26,953
Yeah? Well, suppose it didn't.
Suppose it was Russian.

460
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:29,836
Then what? We'd be taken prisoner.

461
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:32,999
The Russians wouldn't take us prisoner.

462
01:09:33,132 --> 01:09:36,632
I don't know. Major Dingledine,
my new dad, told me...

463
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:38,838
Major Dingledine?

464
01:09:38,972 --> 01:09:42,637
Yeah. He said that if
the Russians invaded the US,

465
01:09:42,768 --> 01:09:47,679
they would take the kids
and separate us from our parents -

466
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:50,849
and I know it sounds weird -

467
01:09:50,985 --> 01:09:56,656
but they might make us go into
the Olympics or something like that.

468
01:09:57,575 --> 01:10:00,327
- I don't see what's so funny.
- Piggy,

469
01:10:00,454 --> 01:10:05,163
I don't think you have to worry about the
Russians forcing you into the Olympics.

470
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:15,385
Hey, what's that?

471
01:10:45,586 --> 01:10:48,255
(sings Bach's Minuet in G)

472
01:10:52,635 --> 01:10:55,304
Where do you think it comes from?

473
01:10:55,430 --> 01:11:00,057
A Russian submarine,
full of Olympic athletes.

474
01:11:15,118 --> 01:11:17,157
(rustling)

475
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:43,815
Ralph, wake up.

476
01:11:46,276 --> 01:11:49,112
- What is it?
- Sh. Just listen.

477
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:52,405
There's someone out there.

478
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:58,828
- I don't hear anything.
- Sh. Listen.

479
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,699
(rustling)

480
01:12:06,548 --> 01:12:09,502
(Jack) I hear you there, Piggy.

481
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:13,086
Come outside, Piggy. I want you, Piggy.

482
01:12:14,181 --> 01:12:16,755
(hunter) Ha, Piggy!

483
01:12:16,893 --> 01:12:19,847
Come on out, Piggy.

484
01:12:22,941 --> 01:12:25,313
(Piggy wails)

485
01:12:28,822 --> 01:12:32,156
Why can't you just leave us alone?

486
01:12:32,284 --> 01:12:34,407
- (hunter) Yagh!
- (Piggy wails)

487
01:12:34,537 --> 01:12:36,862
- Give 'em back!
- I got the glasses!

488
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:39,037
(hunters cheer)

489
01:12:57,645 --> 01:12:59,472
(crying)

490
01:13:08,323 --> 01:13:10,150
Here.

491
01:13:25,925 --> 01:13:30,884
We did everything just the way
grown-ups would have.

492
01:13:31,014 --> 01:13:33,684
Why didn't it work?

493
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:40,186
Things'd be much better, Ralph,
if it wasn't for him.

494
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:43,234
I wish he was dead.

495
01:13:43,945 --> 01:13:47,314
- No, you don't.
- I do.

496
01:13:51,245 --> 01:13:56,584
We could just give up and join his tribe.

497
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:59,995
Then we'd at least be with the others.

498
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:02,537
No, Piggy.

499
01:14:03,216 --> 01:14:07,000
Ralph, I can't see.

500
01:14:08,555 --> 01:14:10,927
I know.

501
01:14:39,755 --> 01:14:42,329
- Halt! Who goes there?
- (whistles)

502
01:14:42,466 --> 01:14:45,040
(Ralph) Don't be stupid.
You know who we are.

503
01:14:45,178 --> 01:14:47,751
We brought the conch.
I'm calling an assembly.

504
01:14:47,889 --> 01:14:50,843
- Where's Jack?
- (Jack) What do you want now?

505
01:14:50,976 --> 01:14:54,641
(Ralph) You heard. We brought the conch.
I'm calling an assembly.

506
01:14:54,771 --> 01:14:59,897
Why don't you two fuck off? This is my
end and my tribe. Keep to your own end.

507
01:15:00,027 --> 01:15:04,357
You won't keep to your end, tearing up
our camp and stealing Piggy's glasses.

508
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:07,326
- You've gotta give 'em back.
- Got to? Who says?

509
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:09,492
I do.

510
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:14,827
Piggy can't see. If you wanted to have
a fire all you had to do was ask.

511
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,338
- I don't have to ask!
- Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

512
01:15:56,171 --> 01:15:57,998
(conch)

513
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,388
- (Piggy) I've got the conch. Let me speak.
- Get outta here, Piggy.

514
01:16:08,518 --> 01:16:10,557
(hunters jeer)

515
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:17,188
Stop that, Roger. Let Piggy speak.

516
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:19,359
(wolf-whistles)

517
01:16:20,197 --> 01:16:23,780
Please. This is serious.

518
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:28,073
Get out, fat ass. Get away.
Go back to your own camp.

519
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:32,200
What I wanna say is,

520
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:37,496
if we don't get rescued
we might have to live here for a long time.

521
01:16:38,634 --> 01:16:41,588
Maybe the rest of our lives.

522
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:49,683
If we are stuck here until we get old
then we can't go on acting like kids.

523
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:54,314
We've gotta be sensible
and make things work.

524
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:56,102
No!

525
01:17:26,102 --> 01:17:28,972
You're not gonna get away with this.

526
01:17:29,105 --> 01:17:33,055
Yeah? And what are you gonna do? Huh?

527
01:17:33,193 --> 01:17:36,443
What are you gonna do about it?

528
01:17:36,571 --> 01:17:40,071
You're out of it, pal. You're on your own.

529
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,573
(bird squawks)

530
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:35,255
About time.

531
01:18:35,385 --> 01:18:37,876
- You guys by yourselves?
- Yep.

532
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:42,675
- Listen, you two, you have to stay awake.
- Give us a break.

533
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:46,428
What do you think? You have to be 1 1
or you can't stand a watch?

534
01:18:46,563 --> 01:18:48,805
Just stay awake.

535
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:58,492
What's the big deal?
There's nobody left except Ralph.

536
01:18:58,618 --> 01:19:01,738
They're scared of the monster.

537
01:19:01,872 --> 01:19:06,285
You said we didn't believe
in the monster. You said.

538
01:19:07,795 --> 01:19:10,630
I'm pretty sure we don't.

539
01:19:37,785 --> 01:19:39,992
(whispers) Sam! Eric!

540
01:19:40,121 --> 01:19:42,197
It's me.

541
01:19:42,332 --> 01:19:44,621
You shouldn't be around here, Ralph.

542
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:48,334
You're not allowed. The hunters
are gonna come after you.

543
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:54,134
Yeah. And Jack had Roger
sharpen his stick at both ends.

544
01:19:54,262 --> 01:19:58,675
If that happens, it'll be
because you let it happen.

545
01:19:58,808 --> 01:20:03,850
If you don't stand up to him
you're just another one of his slaves.

546
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:07,314
(Jack) Hey, keep alert down there!

547
01:20:39,394 --> 01:20:43,807
(hunter) Light another one.
We gotta smoke him out.

548
01:20:53,951 --> 01:20:56,193
(hunter) He's over here!

549
01:20:56,329 --> 01:20:57,953
(yells)

550
01:21:21,564 --> 01:21:23,604
(hunter whistles)

551
01:21:32,534 --> 01:21:34,574
(hunter whistles)

552
01:22:42,276 --> 01:22:44,649
See anything over there?

553
01:22:44,779 --> 01:22:45,942
No.

554
01:22:46,072 --> 01:22:48,398
(both) Nothing.

555
01:23:12,476 --> 01:23:14,100
Jack!

556
01:23:15,187 --> 01:23:17,939
(Jack) Get him!

557
01:24:15,711 --> 01:24:17,538
(shouting)

558
01:24:38,944 --> 01:24:41,815
What are you guys doing?

559
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:45,314
