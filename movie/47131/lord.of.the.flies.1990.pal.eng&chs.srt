lt's only a story.
这只是个故事罢了

126
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,188
lt's not real.
又不是真的

127
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,992
(Ralph) I don't know if he can hold up. What if he suddenly gets really sick?
我不知道他能不能撑得住，要是他突然得了重病呢？

128
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,193
(Jack) Man, you gotta stop worrying so much. We got it made.
兄弟，别担心这么多好吗？我们活了下来

129
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,950
No parents, no teachers, no academy, no girls.
没有父母，老师，学校，女孩

130
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,469
Of course, I wouldn't mind getting a little every now and then.
当然，偶尔有几个女孩作伴也不错

131
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,957
- Like you ever got any.
- 就凭你这副德性？
- Well, I still wouldn't mind.
- 我还是这么想

132
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,835
Oh! My arm.
噢，我的手

133
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,349
You OK?
你没事吧？

134
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,436
Psych!
笨蛋！

135
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,193
Nearly got him. Next time.
差点就逮到它了，下一次它跑不掉的

136
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,078
Do you think it has any protein in it?
你认为它含有蛋白质吗？

137
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,359
Here, give it here.

l heard they're supposed to taste Iike chicken.

要吃一些吗？

140
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,080
- Are you telling the truth?
- 你说的是真的？
- Yeah.
- 是的

141
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,389

- 我们才不相信呢！
- Yeah, you're lying.
- 是啊，你在骗人！

142
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,556
Why aren't you getting ready?
你们怎么还没开始打包呢？

143
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,955
(boy) Sir, is it really true?
机长，这是真的吗？

144
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,437
You bet it is. Simon's right. We're gonna be rescued.
当然是了，赛门说得没错，我们将会获救的

145
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,189
Get your things together, guys. We're going home.

I...
我...

147
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,949
(Captain Benson groans)

148
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,272
(groans)

149
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,556
(Ralph) Beat it, you kids.
到一边去！你们这些小鬼

150
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,639
Come on. Why isn't anybody getting food or wood?
快点，为何没有人去找食物或捡柴火？

151
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,112
(yells)

152
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,398
- Spit! Come on!
- 吐！快点！
- Come on! Spit!
- 快，吐啊！

- I got it. There it is.
- 我办到了，你看

155
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,228
No, you're not gonna get out until I see it splash in the ocean.
没门，在我看见你的口水在海水里散开之前，你休想起来

156
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,319
- I made it.
- 我成功了！
- No, I didn't see it splash.
- 闪一边去！我没看见它散开

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,558
- Ow!
- 嗷
- See? It splashed again.
- 看，又散开了！

158
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,393
Ha! It's our turn to have fun.

Assembly!
集合了！

160
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,836
What's going on?
是怎么回事？

161
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,957
The reason I'm calling this assembly is,
我今天之所以要吹集合号..

162
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,279
too many people are screwing around when they should be working. And there's a bunch of things.
有太多的人该工作时不去工作，却跑去玩，我们还有好多事得做

163

Some kids don't even know when to use the bathroom.
有些人甚至不知道该何时去上厕所

164
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,480
Yeah, there was this one kid the other day,
是啊，前几天就有那么一个小鬼

165
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,194
he took a shit in his pants and then sat in it.
大便在自已的裤子里也不晓得

166
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,075
I'm not naming names cos it's possible Mikey couldn't help it.
我不公布他的名字，因为麦奇听了后可能会控制不住

167
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,796
Was it green? Was it running down your Iegs?
它是绿色的吗？它是顺着你的腿流下来的？

168
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,912
Everybody shut their goddamn mouths!
所有人都给我闭嘴！

169
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,952
Ralph's got the conch.
海螺还在拉夫的手上啊！

170
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,600
All I mean is, we have to have a little more discipline.
我只是想告诉你们，我们得有一点纪律

171
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,678
And more spearfishing. We've gotta have real food.
还得去多叉一些鱼回来，我们得吃营养的食物才行

172
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,316

- That's all I got to say.
- 以上就是我所要说的

173

- Some jerk-off stole my pocketknife.

174
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,948
Yeah, things are disappearing all over.

175
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,595
- What are we gonna do with thieves we catching?

176
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,508

177
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,313
- Ram it in there!
- 整个插进去！
- OK, OK!
- 好了！好了！

178
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,597
(Ralph) We can't have kids stealing and just running wild.
我们不能容许有人到处偷东西

179
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,999
We're gonna have to have stricter rules. And hand out demerits, I guess.
我想我们得制定更严格的规定，并制定罚则

180
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,997
- Demerits!
- 罚则！
- Demerits?
- 罚则？

181
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,395
Demerits for grand larceny?
这么重大的窃盗罪就只轻轻地罚一下？

182
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,432
- Eat shit and die.
- 非把他整死不可！
- Yeah!
- 对！

183
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,638
Sir?
长官

184
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,630
Are we ever going home?
我们回得了家吗？

185
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,389
Of course we are, as soon as they see our signal.
当然能了，只要他们看见我们的讯号

186
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,354
Jack says that we're never gonna be rescued.
杰克说我们永远都不会获救

187
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,237
No, you misunderstood him. That's not what he meant.
不，你误会他的意思了，这不是他的意思

188
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,148
That's exactly what I meant. There's eight million islands out here.
我正是这个意思，这一带有八百万个岛

189
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,750
Why should they find this one?
他们怎么会找到这一个？

190
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,714
Don't listen to him. We will be rescued, Peter.
别听他的话，我们都会获救的，彼得

191
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,035
Honest.

Are you going hunting for pigs again? I wanna come next time.

194
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,120
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

195
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,995
Hey, cut it out.

196
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,478
Are you crazy? Stop it.

- 因为他惹了麻烦
- Who says?

东尼，杰克告诉他，他弄了一辆车子然后开上高速公路

- He didn't say he stole it.
- 他没说是他偷的

201
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,310
He just borrowed it. It was a neighbour's.
他只是借用一下，那车子是个邻居的

202
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,195
And the neighbour was away and he just borrowed it and drove it on the highway.
当时邻居不在，他就借了那车子然后开上高速公路

203
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,630
He probably rode his dad's bicycle around the block.
他可能是借了他爸的脚踏车，然后骑着它在那一带兜风

204

207
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,275
Ugh!
噢！

208
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,115
What time is it?
几点了？

209
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,800
What difference does it make?
你就算知道又能怎样？

210
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,869
Well, if I knew what time it was I'd know what's on TV.
如果我知道现在是几点，我就知道电视上在演什么了

211
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,514

Mondays. Monday's ALF.
礼拜一..礼拜一是"家有阿福"啊！

214

ALF comes on at eight o'clock. It's a Iot Iater than eight.
"家有阿福"是八点开始的，现在早就不止八点了

215
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,838
Yeah. But I bet we're in a different time zone.
是啊，但我敢打赌，我们是身处一个不同的时区里

216
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,717
l bet it's really about eight o'clock and ALF's causing some trouble right now.
而且现在也正好是八点左右，而阿福这时候正惹出了某种麻烦

217
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,592
Yeah.
是啊

218
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,394
(Jack) They're mean and they move fast. They ain't gonna be easy to kill.
它们很凶悍，而且动作很快，它们可是不容易杀死的

219
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,993

- I guess the spear's gotta be real sharp.
- 矛必须足够锐利才行

220
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,159
We have to have a strategy. You know, trick 'em.
我们得拟定一套战略才行，你知道，欺骗它们

221
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,840
Oh, sure. How we supposed to do that?
是啊，但我们该如何来做？

222
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,714
You just smoke 'em out. You crawl up, light a Iittle fire.
只要用火将它们熏出来就行，爬进去，点一把火

223
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,798
We have to practise on stuff that moves.
我们得用会移动的东西来练习

224
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,272
Ew.
喔

225
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,430
Jesus Christ.
我的天！

226
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,316
When do we do it? I mean, Iike, what time of day?
我们何时动手？我是说，在一天中的什么时候？

227
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,592
You always go right before dawn. Maybe you can catch 'em asleep.
你得在天亮以前出击，或许能在它们熟睡时抓住它们

228
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,472
(panting)

229
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,430
Simon!
赛门！

230
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,193
Simon can't stay with him every single second.
不能要赛门寸步不离地陪着他啊

231
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,878
Sh.
嘘

232
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,155
And he's scared of everyone else.
而且他也怕别的人

233
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,832
I'm scared of him. He's crazy. We've gotta do something.
我才怕他呢！他疯了，我们得想想办法才行

234
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,748
- (Ralph) Maybe we should tie him down so he can't move.
- 或许我们该把他绑起来让他不能乱动
- (Jack) Yeah, it would be better if we get rid of him.
- 对，最好把他解决了

235
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,476
Come on. He's hurt bad and he has a fever. We've gotta take care of him.
别说这种话，他受了重伤，而且在发高烧，我们得照顾他才行

236
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,229
(Roger) Why bother? He ain't gonna make it.
何必多此一举？他反正也活不了

237
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,399
- We've gotta take care of ourselves.
- 我们得照顾自已才是重要的
- Exactly.
- 一点也没错

238
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,832
(gasps)

239
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,596

Captain Benson!
班森机长！

00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,636
Captain Benson!
班森机长！

243
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,597
(Ralph) Save your breath, man.
省省力吧，兄弟

244
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,679
He's gotta be close by. He's probably just Iost.
他一定在这附近，他可能是迷了路

245
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,278
Look.
看！

246
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,118
(Ralph) It's nobody's fault, Simon. He just didn't know what he was doing.
这不是任何人的错，赛门，他不知道自已在做什么

247
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,279
l don't think it's what you think. I don't think he's dead.
我的看法和你不同，我不认为他已经死了

248
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,233
- Why not?
- 这话怎么说？
- Where are his shoes?

We've gotta keep Iooking.

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,120
He just swam out in 'em.
他一定是穿着它们跳下去了

251
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,756
And his belt? He Ieft his pants and swam out in his shoes and belt?
还有他的皮带呢？他留下他的裤子却穿着鞋子系着皮带下海游泳？

252
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
He was crazy, Simon.
他已经疯了啊！赛门

253
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,475
(grunting)

254
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,068

- Yeah!

- 刺它的屁股！

261
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,758
- You dorks. It hurt.
- 你们这些混蛋！会痛呢！
- I know it hurt.

262
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,070

Yeah, sure, Piggy. Then a TV.
是啊，猪小弟，然后再造一个电视

264
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,517
No, really. We could make a sundial with a stick in the ground.
不，我是说真的，我们可以在地上插根柱子做一个日晷

265
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,716
What's that noise?
那是什么声音？

266
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,116
(whirring)

267
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,233
- Look, there it is!

00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,070
If you guys hadn't let the god damn fire go out they would have seen it.
如果你们没让那堆火熄灭，他们早看见它了！

面对现实吧！杰克，是你坏了事，我们本来可获救的

278
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,596
Back off, man. I'm sick of your shit and so's my gang.
你少教训我！我受够你了，我的弟兄们也一样

279
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,950
Your gang? What's that supposed to mean?
你的弟兄？这是什么意思？

280
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,915
What it means, colonel, is that if you know what's good for you you'll stop trying to run everything.
意思是，团长，如果你识相的话就别再想对我们颐指气使！

281
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,108
Stop it!
住手！

我受够了这一切！我要另外建一个营地，只要是猎人和想玩的人都可以来

283
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,548
(gang) Yeah!
好啊！

284
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,717
Come on, Jack, that's crazy. We've gotta work together.
别胡说，杰克，这太疯狂了，我们得团结在一起才行

285
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,677
- Come on, what do you say?
- 快点，你说如何？
- I say fuck you.
- 我说去你的！

286
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,360
And that goes for you too, Miss Piggy.
你也一样，猪小妹

287
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,109
Come on, Iet's get out of this kindergarten.

- Right on, Larry.
- 好极了，拉瑞

When you other brats get older or get hungry enough, you can come join us too.
你们其他人想明白了或者饿得受不了时，也可以过来加入我们

They're back! Simon, they're back!
他们回来了！赛门，他们回来了！

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,951
Are you all right? It's only a storm.
你没事吧？不过是场暴风雨罢了

293
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,754
(thud)

294
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,995
- Where's your brother?
- 你弟弟在哪？
- I don't know.
- 我不知道

295
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,510
He must be in the other shelter.
他一定是在别的地方躲雨！

296
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,634
Quick, get out of there! That tree's gonna go!
快！快点出来！那棵树要倒了！

297
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,236
(boy screams)

298
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,876

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,475
Where are the others?
其他的人呢？

302
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,556
I don't know.
我不知道

303
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,036
(boy screams)

304
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,680
Peter, where are you?
彼得，你在哪里？

305
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,158
Ralph!
拉夫！

306
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,360
(Ralph in distance) Yeah?
什么事？

307
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,396
Where are you?
你在哪？

308
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,476
(Ralph) Over here.
这边

309
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,073
(Piggy) Wait. Wait for me.
等等，等等我

310
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,156
Well, come on.
快点啊！

311
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,274
- Where'd you get that from?

- (boy) Right here.
- 这里

312
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,716
(Piggy) Ralph!
拉夫！

313
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,798
- Yeah?
- 什么？
- Over here. We found fruit.
- 快过来！我们找到水果了！

314
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,515
Do you think the other guys are OK?
你想其他那些人都平安吗？

315
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,679
- Who cares?
- 谁在乎？
- OK, dork. I was just asking.
- 你发什么火，我只是问问罢了

316
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,119
We should relight the fire.
我们该再将那堆火点起来

317
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,318
- Gross.
- 好恶心
- (boy) Where are they?
- 他们到哪去了？

318
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,910
(boy #2) If they didn't get blown away they're probably hunting.
如果他们没被风吹走的话，大概是去打猎了

319
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,319
What good will that do? They can't cook pigs without a fire. They'll get trichinosis.
就算打到了又有个屁用！他们没有火是不能烤猪肉的，若是吃生肉会得旋毛虫病的

320
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,750
- What's that?
- 那是什么？
- It's bugs that Iive in pigs.

321
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,796
We knew that.
这我们知道

322
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,596
- (groans)
- (screams)

323
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,199
What's this shit about a monster? We'll send you back to kindergarten.
你在胡说什么？一个怪物？看来咱们得送你回那个幼稚园了

324
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,630
- I'm serious.
- 我是说真的！
- OK, what kind of monster?
- 好吧，什么样的怪物？

325
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,799
Did it have fur and poisoned fangs, or long, slimy tentacles?
它身上有毛，嘴里长着毒牙？或者是长长的触须？

326
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,038
It growled and it came out at me. And its mouth, it was wet.
它会发出叫声，它向我爬过来，还有它的嘴巴..是湿的

327
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,197
- Maybe it was a bear.
- 或许是一头熊
- Sounds more like a reptile.
- 听来倒像是某种爬行动物

328
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,153
Sounds more like bullshit.
听起来更像是狗屁

329
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,232
(groaning)

330
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,112
(groaning)

331
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,515
- We heard it all right.
- 没错，咱们听见它了
- Yeah.
- 是啊

332
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,393
Whatever it is, it's in there.
不管它是什么..它就在那里面

333
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,910
You should have seen it. He was scared shitless.
你该看看那场面的，他被吓得屁滚尿流

334
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,556
Do you think there was something there? Some kind of wild animal or something?
你认为那里面真的有东西吗？某种野兽之类的？

335
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,912
- I know it. We heard it growl.
- 我知道它在里面，我们听见它发出吼叫
- Is it close?
- 它离我们很近吗？

336
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,874
Just over the big rise behind our camp. Real close.
就在我们营地后方的山上，相当近

337
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,956
Holy shit.
我的天！

338
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,116
- I just thought you ought to know.
- 我只是认为你们应该知道此事
- Yeah.
- 是啊

339
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,160
Thanks for the fire.
多谢你们的火

340
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,993
(Roger) Here come the reserves.
后备部队来了

341
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,838
- Better keep on your toes tonight, cadets.
- 今晚最好提高警觉，兄弟们
- What do you mean?
- 这话是什么意思？

342
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,554
- You'll find out.
- 你到时候就会明白
- What are you doing with that?
- 你拿那火做什么？

343
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,912
Next time we kill a pig, we're gonna have a barbecue.
下回当我们宰了一头猪后，咱们要来个烤肉大餐

344
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,231
- You mean no one's on the fire watch?
- 你是说，没有人在看守火堆？
- Why can't we have the fire down here, by the camp？
- 我们为什么不能在在营地旁边升一堆火？

345
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,477
lf we want anybody to see the smoke it's gotta be up there.
因为我们若希望让人看见烟，就得将火升在那上面！

346
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,034
Nobody wants to be up there alone any more.
没有人敢再一个人待在那上面了

347
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,391
Listen, Ralph, there's something loose on this island, a monster.
听我说，拉夫，这岛上有个东西出没，一个怪物

348
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,273
- There's no monster.
- 根本没有什么怪物
- There's something.
- 真的有一个东西！

349
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,234
- (Piggy) So what do you want?
- 你们想要什么？
- Jack wants the survival knife.
- 杰克要他那把求生猎刀

350
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,316
lt's not his. It belongs to the camp.
那不是他的！刀是属于营地的！

351
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,512
Yeah? Well, there's a new camp now, and he wants it.
是吗？现在有个新营地了，他要将它要回来！

352
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,438
Yeah, and Tony wants his shoes, socks and his junk.
对，还有东尼要他的鞋子、袜子和杂物

353
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,074
Take Tony's stuff but you can't have the survival knife.
把东尼的东西拿走，但求生猎刀不能给你们！

354
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:21,228
- He's a defector. Just another damn defector.
- 他是个叛徒！不过是另一个叛徒罢了！
- It's because of the monster.
- 他是因为害怕怪物才加入他们的

355
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,670
l told you there's no monster. Tony knows there's no monster.
我告诉你们，根本没有怪物！东尼也知道没有怪物

356
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,793
Tony just wants to be a hunter and he's too chickenshit god damn to get his stuff himself.
东尼只是想当个猎人，却不敢自已回营地来拿东西！

357
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,434
But what if there is some kind of big animal?
如果真的有某种大动物存在呢？

358
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,152
Yeah.
是啊

359
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,715
(Piggy) Oh, great. Two more traitors.
太好了，又多了两个叛徒

360
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,035
Sorry, Ralph.
抱歉，拉夫

361
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,754
(Piggy) Good riddance.
早走早安生！

362
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,958
Sh.
嘘

363
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,796
(twig snaps)

364
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,196
(hunters shout)

365
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,636
(Jack) Go on! Get the knife! Get the knife!
快！抢那把刀！抢那把刀！

366
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,199
(Ralph) Bring that back! You have no right!
还给我！你们无权这么做！

367
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,871
Get back here! What the hell do you think you're doing?
快回来！你们在干什么啊？

368
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,514
(Piggy whimpers)

369
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,915
(sobs) Oh, God!
天啊..

370
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,476
They broke my glasses.
他们弄破了我的眼镜

371
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,515
Anyone who wants to come up has to ask.
任何人想上去都得先问问我们！

372
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,313
- Where are the others?
- 其它的人呢？
- They're hunting.
- 他们打猎去了

373
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,239
Where's that cave you found?
你找到的那个洞穴在哪里？

怎么？小姑娘，你们不敢把它带来吗？

是我们的错，我们在场，却没有做任何事情

- 闭嘴！否则连你一起罚！

From now on, any more criminals are gonna be put on that island to starve.
从现在起，有谁再犯错，就将被丢到小岛上挨饿！

448
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,636
(all shout) Yeah!
够了！

449
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,474
(boy yells in pain)

450
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,870
I'll get fire, I promise you. Tomorrow we'll hunt again.
我会弄到火的，我向你们保证，明天，我们将再度出猎

不！它随时都可能再回来！以任何形状出现

就在我们有所不备时，它就可能会出现

我跟你打赌，一旦越过了暗礁，每天都有许多船往来在这片海上

and one of them could rescue us.
其中一艘就可能会救起我们

460
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,954
Yeah? Well, suppose it didn't. Suppose it was Russian.
是吗？如果情形不是这样呢？如果是一艘俄国船呢？

461
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,719
Then what? We'd be taken prisoner.
接下来会如何？他们会把我们囚禁起来的

462

The Russians wouldn't take us prisoner.
俄国人不会将我们囚禁起来的

- 我可不觉得这有什么好笑
- Piggy

嘿，那是什么？

Where do you think it comes from?

Why can't you just Ieave us alone?
你们能不能别来烦我们？

487
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,716

Things'd be much better, Ralph, if it wasn't for him.
如果没有他兴风作浪的话，我们今天也不会这么惨了，拉夫

你们两个能不能别来烦我们？这是我的地盘，我的部落！别捞过界了！

有什么好紧张的？另一边除了拉夫就没别人了

是啊，杰克已经叫罗杰削尖他的棍子两端

如果真的发生这种事，也将会是你们坐视这种事发生
