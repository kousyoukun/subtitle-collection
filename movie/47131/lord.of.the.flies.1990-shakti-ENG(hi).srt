No, it was a regular pig. Big, but regular.

- <i>(dark-haired boy)</i> There's a lot to do.

Can l speak?

47
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,791
The most important thing is,

Nobody knows we're here.
They know where we were going.

<i>(dark-haired boy)</i> l'm sure they're looking.

53
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,270
We should set up some kind
of steady signal, like a fire,

54
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,837
and keep it going all the time.
And we're gonna have to have rules.

Yes, Ralph's right.
We've definitely gotta make a fire.

- Jack's the oldest.

- But Ralph's the colonel.
- l think it should be Ralph.

60
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,639
- l vote for Ralph.
- Yeah, he's a colonel.

61
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,035

- He's the colonel. Ralph.

- lt doesn't matter who's in charge.

63
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,759
We've just gotta work together.
First, we build a camp.

64
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,316
Be careful.

65
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,998
There's probably a lot of berries and
things that look OK but are really poison.

66
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,429
l know what's poisonous or not.

67
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,429
My brother did Outward Bound,
learned how to survive. He taught me.

68

Did he do Outward Bound in the tropics?

69
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,148
- Not exactly.
- Then where?

70
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,713
Colorado.

71
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,834
There are totally different poison plants
in Colorado than in this place.

72
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,350
So we've gotta take precautions
or it won't matter.

73
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,268
- What won't matter?
- Whether we get rescued.

74
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,439
Better learn to live with yourself,
because we ain't gonna get rescued.

75
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,677
- What are you talking about?
- Just being logical.

76
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,079
A plane goes down in the ocean, there's
no wreckage - who's gonna find us?

- Why don't you just shut up?
- Are you telling me to shut up?

78

What we need around here is positive
people, not people trying to scare people.

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,228
No, you're not gonna get out
until l see it splash in the ocean.

155
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,319
- That made it.
- No, l didn't see it splash.

156
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,558
- Ow!
- See? lt splashed again.

157
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,393
Ha! lt's our turn to have fun.

158
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,912
Assembly!

159
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,836
What's going on?

160
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,957
The reason l'm calling
this assembly is,

161
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,279
too many people are screwing around and
not working. There's a bunch of things.

162
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,789
Some kids don't know
when to use the bathroom.

163
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,480
There was this one kid the other day,

164
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,194
he took a shit in his pants
and then sat in it.

165
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,075
l'm not naming names
cos it's possible Mikey couldn't help it.

166
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,796
Was it green? Was it running
down your legs?

167
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,912
Everybody shut their goddamn mouths!

168
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,952
Ralph's got the conch.

169
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,600
All l mean is, we have
to have more discipline.

170
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,678
And more spearfishing.
We've gotta have real food.

171
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,316
- <i>(boy)</i> We should be hunting pigs.
- That's all l got to say.

172
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,353
- Anyone else want the conch?
- Some jerk-off stole my pocketknife.

173
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,948
Yeah, things are disappearing all over.

174
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,595
- What are we gonna do with thieves?
- Kick the shit out of them.

175
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,508
- Shove their dick in the conch!
- Put a stick up their butt.

176
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,313
- Ram it in there!
- OK, OK!

177
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,597
<i>(Ralph)</i> We can't have kids
stealing and running wild.

178
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,999
We're gonna have to have stricter rules.
And hand out demerits, l guess.

179
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,997
- Demerits!
- Demerits?

180
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,395
Demerits for grand larceny?

181
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,432
- Eat shit and die.
- Yeah!

182
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,638
Sir?

183
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,630
Are we ever going home?

184
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,389
Of course we are,
as soon as they see our signal.

185
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,354
Jack says that we're never
gonna be rescued.

186
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,237
No, you misunderstood him.
That's not what he meant.

187
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,148
That's exactly what l meant.
There's eight million islands out here.

188
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,750
Why should they find this one?

189
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,714
Don't listen to him.
We will be rescued, Peter.

190
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,035
Honest.

191
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,916
Are you going hunting for pigs again?
l wanna come next time.

192
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,837
Me too.

193
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,120
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

194
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,995
Hey, cut it out.

195
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,478
Are you crazy? Stop it.

196
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,318
You know why Jack got sent
to military school?

197
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,910
- Because he was in trouble.
- Who says?

198
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,352
Tony. Jack told him he took a car
and drove it on the highway.

199
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,031
- He's a liar. He didn't steal a car.
- He didn't say he stole it.

200
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,310
He borrowed it. lt was a neighbour's.

201
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,195
And the neighbour was away and he just
borrowed it and drove it on the highway.

202
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,630
He probably rode his dad's bicycle
around the block.

203
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,036
- Then how come he got arrested?
- Yeah, by the highway patrol.

204
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,833
They got him doing 80.

205
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,758
Ugh!

206
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,275
Ugh!

207
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,115
What time is it?

208
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,800
What difference does it make?

209
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,869
Well, if l knew what time it was
l'd know what's on TV.

210
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,514
- l'm not even sure what day it is.
- lt's Monday.

- l'm sure.

212

Mondays. Monday's <i>ALF.</i>

a different time zone.

ALF's causing some trouble right now.

- l guess the spear's gotta be real sharp.

219
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,159
We have to have a strategy.
You know, trick 'em.

Oh, sure. How we supposed to do that?

221

You just smoke 'em out.
You crawl up, light a little fire.

222
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,798
We have to practise on stuff that moves.

- Who cares?
- OK, dork. l was just asking.

315
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,119
We should relight the fire.

- Gross.
- <i>(boy)</i> Where are they?

<i>(boy #2)</i> lf they didn't get blown away
they're probably hunting.

318
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,319
What good will that do? They can't cook
pigs without a fire. They'll get trichinosis.

319
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,750
- What's that?
- lt's bugs that live in pigs.

- OK, what kind of monster?

324
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,799
Did it have fur and poisoned fangs,

lt growled and it came out at me.
And its mouth, it was wet.

- Maybe it was a bear.

Some kind of wild animal or something?

- l know it. We heard it growl.
- ls it close?

335
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,874
Just over the big rise
behind our camp. Real close.

- Why can't we have the fire down here?

00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,477
lf we want anybody to see the smoke
it's gotta be up there.

Nobody wants to be
up there alone any more.

There's something loose
on this island - a monster.

- There's no monster.
- There's something.

- <i>(Piggy)</i> So what do you want?
- Jack wants the survival knife.

349
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,316
lt's not his. lt belongs to the camp.

350

Yeah? Well, there's a new camp now,
and he wants it.

351
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,438
Yeah, and Tony wants his shoes,
socks and his junk.

Take Tony's stuff
but you can't have the knife.

- He's a defector. Another damn defector.
- lt's because of the monster.

354
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,670
l told you there's no monster.
Tony knows there's no monster.

355
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,793
Tony just wants to be a hunter
and he's too chickenshit to get his stuff.

00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,434
But what if there is
some kind of big animal?

- Where are the others?
- They're hunting.

- Yeah, but l'm not going back.

You kept your promise

lots of boats come by every day,

458
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,076
and one of them could rescue us.

459
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,954
Yeah? Well, suppose it didn't.
Suppose it was Russian.

460
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,719
Then what? We'd be taken prisoner.

461
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,752
The Russians wouldn't take us prisoner.

462
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,236
l don't know. Major Dingledine,
my new dad, told me...

463
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,351
Major Dingledine?

464
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,995
Yeah. He said that if
the Russians invaded the US,

465
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,830
they would take the kids
and separate us from our parents -

466
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,870
and l know it sounds weird -

467
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,438
but they might make us go into
the Olympics or something like that.

468
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,959
- l don't see what's so funny.
- Piggy,

469
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:13,596
l don't think you have to worry about the
Russians forcing you into the Olympics.

470
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,399
Hey, what's that?

<i>(sings Bach's Minuet in G)</i>

Where do you think it comes from?

473
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,237
A Russian submarine,
full of Olympic athletes.

There's someone out there.

We did everything just the way

Why didn't it work?

Things'd be much better, Ralph,

l wish he was dead.

- No, you don't.
- l do.

496
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,520
We could just give up and join his tribe.

497
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,791
Then we'd at least be with the others.

No, Piggy.

- <i>(Jack)</i> What do you want now?

l'm calling an assembly.

Why don't you two fuck off? This is my
end and my tribe. Keep to your own end.

You won't keep to your end, tearing up
our camp and stealing Piggy's glasses.

508
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,359
- You've gotta give 'em back.

l do.

510
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,553
Piggy can't see. lf you wanted to have
a fire all you had to do was ask.

Get out, fat ass. Get away.
Go back to your own camp.

519
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,750
What l wanna say is,

520
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,829
if we don't get rescued
we might have to live here for a long time.

Maybe the rest of our lives.

522
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:41,516
lf we are stuck here until we get old
then we can't go on acting like kids.

523
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,957
We've gotta be sensible
and make things work.

No!

525

Yeah? And what are you gonna do? Huh?

- Give us a break.

533
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,470

or you can't stand a watch?

534

Just stay awake.

There's nobody left except Ralph.

They're scared of the monster.

You said we didn't believe
in the monster. You said.

Yeah. And Jack had Roger
sharpen his stick at both ends.
