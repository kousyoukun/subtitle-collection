00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,273
Ah!

<i>The tomatoes go in the refrigerator
and the bananas go in the fruit bowl.</i>

23
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,590
<i>I do some of the grocery shopping,
and always do the tomatoes first.</i>

24
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,066
<i>We don't ask for information.</i>

25
00:02:31,136 --> 00:02:33,229
<i>You say that's it?
That's the only problem.</i>

26
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,199
<i>People will do that, the tomato crop,
tomato prices will be part of the deal.</i>

27
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,188
<i>Well, I thought that they'll have
a much better product, yeah.</i>

28
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,239
<i>But this lot will grow in the back yard,
pick 'em whenever you want.</i>

29
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,167
<i>If you want to eat tomatoes
12 months out of the year,</i>

30
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:54,124
<i>you're gonna have to pick 'em
at one of these two stations.</i>

<i>It's your choice, oh, Lord</i>

40
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,291
<i>- Hello. You've reached...
- John McCleary.</i>

41
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:23,303
<i>After the tone,
please leave a message.</i>

42
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,281
It's done.

43
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:42,078
Just go inside.

44
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,265
- What?
- Go inside. Just go, just go.

45

<i>$300? You parasite!</i>

46

<i>75.</i>

49
00:08:55,306 --> 00:09:00,076
<i>I'm not wealthy.
I'm just a woman with $75.</i>

50
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:09,076
Hey.

51
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,180
Excited to see me, huh?

52
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,147
You actually got me.

53
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,074
- I got you.
- Yeah, pretty good.

54
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:38,261
Got you, got you!

55
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,281
What is this shit you're watching?

56
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:42,292
Oh...

57
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:46,094
Psycho was on today.

58
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:49,229
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,115
That scared me.
Oh, boy, it scared me.

60
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,082
Then why are you watching it alone?

61
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:58,135
I don't know.
I should've waited for you.

62
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:04,166
Ohh...

63
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:16,070
- Joe?
- Yeah?

64
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,102
Would you just stay a little bit?

65
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,164
Just stay.

66
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,102
- Okay.
- Just...

67
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,248
Cos you watched some scary,
fucking movie?

68
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,258
Just till I've finished the movie.

69
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:48,127
Joe?

70
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:51,115
Uh?

71
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,210
Mom?

72
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,167
Yeah?

73
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:57,199
I can't turn the tap off!

74
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,178
Oh, I don't have any of the...

75
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:06,105
I can't find anything.

76
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:08,302
- What are you looking for?
- I can't find my toothbrush.

77
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,135
It's right behind the mirror.

78
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:12,250
Wait...

79
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,302
Oh, oh, okay.

80
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,061
Mom? Come on!

81
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,281
- Let's go. I'm opening.
- No, no, no, no! Stop that!

82
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,301
- Just let me...
- I'm opening the door.

83
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,238
No, no, no!

84
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:30,112
What are you doing?
What are you fucking around with?

85
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,248
- There's water everywhere!
- I'm not fucking around!

86
00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:35,207
You are! There's nothing.
You keep rearranging... Get out.

87
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,144
I need my space!

88
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,124
- Your what?
- My space.

89
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,279
Alright. Go get your space downstairs.

90
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,237
Okay, I just needed that...

91
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:45,279
Are you sure
you can get downstairs alright?

92
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,216
What? Yeah.

93
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,205
Yeah, if I do it really slow.

94
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:53,102
I know what to do.

95
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,119
The man called.

96
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,180
Said he wants to see you, right away.

97
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,097
Did your son tell you that he saw me?

98
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,066
Hey, he was...
with a friend, you know.

99
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,075
It's just... just a coincidence, man.

100
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,138
Did he tell you where he saw me?

101
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,086
No.

102
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:18,283
No, I...
I know you wouldn't want me to know, man.

103
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:22,096
Moises didn't mean to see you, Joe. He...

104
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,054
Don't yell at me.

105
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:26,065
He's just a stupid freaking kid.

106
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:29,095
- I know, but...
- He...

107
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:32,178
We're done, Angel.

108
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,199
Joe, he didn't mean to see you.

109
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:41,064
Come on.

110
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:43,052
Take the money.

111
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:55,135
<i>J...</i>

112
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:57,115

<i>I could go on all day</i>

118
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:19,228
Yes, you could.

119
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:23,092
<i>Q, R, S, T</i>

<i>W, X, Y, Z</i>

125
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:47,090
- Mom...
- What?

126
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:49,100
This fridge is disgusting.

127
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,162
- What's wrong?
- You got...

128
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,121
And all this shit's rotten.

129
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:59,182
Well, honey,
what are you looking for?

130
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:03,255
This cream cheese is from 1972.

131
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,130
I use it. Just leave it.

132
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:18,181
- How's Janice?
- Who's Janice?

133
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:24,055
Oh, come on.
You know who Janice is.

134
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:31,077
You mean my girlfriend from 20 years ago?

135
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,034
She would've been a good mom.

136
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:48,240
<i>Stop it!</i>

137
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,263
Joe?

138
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:54,200
Coming!

139
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:49,154
Going up?

140
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:09,163
What's all this?

141
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,058
That Cincinnati kid.

142
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:17,069
Parents are florists.

143
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:24,214
A warm thank you for getting
their darling daughter back home safe.

144
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,172
Flowers.

145
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:29,129
Josephine loved flowers.

146
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:33,046
I could never see the point myself.

147
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:36,056
The fuckers die anyway
and stink up the whole damn place.

148
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:39,129
God bless her.

149
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:42,234
Hey, um...

150
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:45,213
Listen, we gotta lose Angel's number.

151
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,055
- I'll find a new service.
- Okay.

152
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:52,201
No problem.

153
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,055
So, Angel's out.

154
00:20:56,253 --> 00:21:01,170
You could uh... just call me directly,
you know, like a normal person.

155
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:12,138
There's no green ones.

156
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:15,043
- I like green.
- Hm.

157
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:17,074
Fucking asshole!

158
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:19,022
Why am I here?

159
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:22,105
State Senator Albert Votto.

160
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,210
I ran his father's security
back in the '80s.

161
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:29,198
Lost track of him after his arraignment.

162
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:31,261
I found a green one.

163
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,187
The wife - Votto Junior's wife -

164
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:38,084
kills herself a couple of years ago.

165
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:42,115
Their teenage daughter's
been running away from home ever since.

166
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,166
I'm listening.

167
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,239
Votto calls me this morning.

168
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,259
She's been missing all weekend.

169
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,228
He doesn't wanna get the cops involved

170
00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:00,154
now that he's running
on Governor Williams's ticket.

171
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,154
Ahh!

172
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:05,143
He's paying 50 grand cash.

173
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:07,154
What's the lead?

174
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:10,060
He got an anonymous text with an address.

175
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,164
Meet him at the Union Club, 2pm.

176
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:23,070
Josephine II is coming out of dry dock,
thanks to this.

177
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:28,017
I'm gonna drive her through the harbor
with a big fucking fireworks display.

178
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:35,257
You, me, couple of steaks,
cold beers, setting sun...

179
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:38,016
What do you say to that?

180
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:40,235
What?

181
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,806
<i>235 East 31st Street.</i>

182

<i>That's what the text said.</i>

183
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:14,962
You have kids, Joe?

184
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:19,857
No.

185
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,815

Her name is Nina.

187
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,783
I've heard of these places...

188
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:34,991
Underage girls.

189
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:37,970
Senator, if she's there,

190
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,949
I'll get her.

191
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,844
McCleary said you were brutal.

192
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:52,865
I can be.

193
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,927
Gonna need this.

194
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,789
Be at this address, 3am.

195
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,893
Hotel Caribe, room 701.

196
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:42,808
I want you to hurt them.

197
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,933
- Keys.
- Have a nice day.

198
00:25:56,782 --> 00:25:58,782
What are you doing?

199
00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:58,914
Would you mind taking a picture for us?

200
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,747
What?

201
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:04,954
Would you mind taking
a picture of us?

202

Go, go!

205
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,752
He doesn't know...

206
00:28:05,763 --> 00:28:07,762
He has no idea.

207
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:21,939
I've been waiting for
you for 20 minutes.

Please be honest with me.

Right, security - how many are there?

Huh? Is there one? More than one?

- Two, three? Come on, talk.
- Two.

00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:31,684
<i>The Pacific Ocean.</i>

330
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:34,591
<i>Do you know what the Mexicans
say about the Pacific?</i>

331
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:38,653
<i>They say it has no memory.</i>

332
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:42,767
<i>That's where I want
to live the rest of my life.</i>

333
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:49,548
Hey, don't worry,
your dad's gonna be here soon.

334
00:43:55,642 --> 00:43:57,641
Are you alright?

335
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,577
Yes, sir.

336
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:07,630
<i>Take my guests out
charter fishing.</i>

337

<i>Zihuatanejo.</i>

<i>27-year-old passer-by
Rebecca Couran</i>

front of the hotel.</i>

340
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:33,764
<i>He just stood there for a second

<i>Senator Votto's body
was discovered</i>

342
00:44:36,597 --> 00:44:39,574
<i>beneath the Tower Hotel
in mid-town Manhattan,</i>

343
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:42,553
<i>after he apparently leapt from
a suite on the 22nd floor.</i>

344
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:45,607
<i>Senator Votto was in the city
campaigning for Governor Williams</i>

345

<i>in next month's
gubernatorial elections.</i>

346
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,585
It's okay. Okay.
Come here. Look at me.

347
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:08,698
<i>He climbed up on the ledge, stood
there for a second, then stepped off.</i>

348
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:12,708
<i>Votto had been dogged with
rumors of sexual misconduct...</i>

349
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:21,550
We got him.

350
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:29,738
Joe!

351

Cute.

352

Man... you think I don't know
what the fuck's going on here?

353
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,540
I'm just a hired gun.

354
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,550
I don't give a shit about...

355
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:50,611
<i>...this is a complete smear campaign,

John, pick up the fucking phone, man.

364
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,746
They fucking shot me, man.
They shot me in the face.

365

Where's your papa?

366
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,580
Huh?

367
00:51:04,547 --> 00:51:06,547

Was it you or the other guy?

00:58:31,483 --> 00:58:33,493
Alright.

384
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:40,482

people and places as we'd like them to be</i>

Was my mother afraid?

<i>That might have
made me complete</i>

415

<i>But I took the sweet life</i>

416
01:00:25,475 --> 01:00:28,578
<i>And never knew I'd be bitter</i>

417

01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:36,513
<i>Cos I don't know
where you've been</i>

489
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:39,472
<i>But it really doesn't matter,
grab your chair and fill a platter</i>

490
01:19:39,482 --> 01:19:41,524
<i>And dig, dig, dig right in</i>

491
01:19:41,534 --> 01:19:44,618
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

492
01:19:44,628 --> 01:19:47,607
<i>Hired a band, goodness' sake...</i>

493
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:25,604
Well, you look great.

494
01:20:25,615 --> 01:20:28,427
Excuse me, could I get
a little bit of butter?

495
01:20:28,437 --> 01:20:30,500
You know you're not supposed
to have butter.

496
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,583
How do you know
I'm not supposed to have it?

497
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,469
We all know you're
not supposed to have it.

498
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:40,635
Have a nice day.

499
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,434
Hey.

500
01:20:55,445 --> 01:20:57,456
Joe? Wake up.

501
01:21:17,632 --> 01:21:19,580
What?

502
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:21,507
Let's go.

503
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:24,475
It's a beautiful day.

504
01:21:31,662 --> 01:21:33,609
It is a beautiful day.

505
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:39,662
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

506
01:21:40,422 --> 01:21:42,641
<i>Baked a cake, baked a cake</i>

507
01:21:42,651 --> 01:21:45,515
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

508
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,421
<i>How do you do,
how do you do, how do you do?</i>
