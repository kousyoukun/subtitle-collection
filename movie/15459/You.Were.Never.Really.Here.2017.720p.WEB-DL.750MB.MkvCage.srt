You must do better. You must do better!

00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,207
Say it.

17
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:08,312
<i>I must do better, sir.</i>

18
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:16,230

20
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:26,295

and always do the tomatoes first.</i>

21
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:30,161
<i>We don't ask for information.</i>

22
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,265
<i>You say that's it?
That's the only problem.</i>

23
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:36,235
<i>People will do that, the tomato crop,
tomato prices will be part of the deal.</i>

24
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:39,225
<i>Well, I thought that they'll have
a much better product, yeah.</i>

00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:44,278
<i>But this lot will grow in the back yard,
pick 'em whenever you want.</i>

12 months out of the year,</i>

27
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:53,166

Hey.

48
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,341
Excited to see me, huh?

49
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,314
You actually got me.

- Yeah, pretty good.

Got you, got you!

52
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,451
What is this shit you're watching?

53
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:41,462
Oh...

54
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:45,265
Psycho was on today.

55
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:52,288
That scared me. Oh, boy, it scared me.

57
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:54,256
Then why are you watching it alone?

58
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:57,310
I don't know. I should've waited for you.

59
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:03,342
Ohh...

60
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:15,251
- Joe?
- Yeah?

61
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:17,283
Would you just stay a little bit?

62
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:20,347
Just stay.

63
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,284
- Okay.
- Just...

64
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,431
Cos you watched some scary, fucking movie?

65
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,442
Just till I've finished the movie.

66
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,336
Joe?

67
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:50,326
Uh?

68
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,421
Mom?

69
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,379
Yeah?

70
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,411
I can't turn the tap off!

71
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:01,392
Oh, I don't have any of the...

72
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,320
I can't find anything.

73
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,570
- What are you looking for?
- I can't find my toothbrush.

74
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:10,352
It's right behind the mirror.

75
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,467
Wait...

76
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:13,520
Oh, oh, okay.

77
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:20,281
Mom? Come on!

78
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,501
- Let's go. I'm opening.
- No, no, no, no! Stop that!

79
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,522
- Just let me...
- I'm opening the door.

80
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:26,460
No, no, no!

81
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:29,335
What are you doing?
What are you fucking around with?

82
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,472
- There's water everywhere!
- I'm not fucking around!

83
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:34,431
You are! There's nothing.
You keep rearranging... Get out.

84
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,368
I need my space!

85
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,349
- Your what?
- My space.

86
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,505
Al right. Go get your space downstairs.

87
00:12:40,515 --> 00:12:42,464
Okay, I just needed that...

88
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,506
Are you sure
you can get downstairs al right?

89
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,444
What? Yeah.

90
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:49,434
Yeah, if I do it really slow.

91
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:52,331
I know what to do.

92
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,405
The man called.

93
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,467
Said he wants to see you, right away.

94
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,386
Did your son tell you that he saw me?

95
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,357
Hey, he was... with a friend, you know.

96
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,367
It's just... just a coincidence, man.

97
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:12,431
Did he tell you where he saw me?

98
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,380
No.

99
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,578
No, I...
I know you wouldn't want me to know, man.

100
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:21,391
Moises didn't mean to see you, Joe. He...

101
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:23,350
Don't yell at me.

102
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:25,361
He's just a stupid freaking kid.

103
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,393
- I know, but...
- He...

104

138

That Cincinnati kid.

Parents are florists.

Josephine loved flowers.

I could never see the point myself.

144

00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,590
Listen, we gotta lose Angel's number.

148
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,434
- I'll find a new service.
- Okay.

149
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,581
No problem.

150
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:54,436
So, Angel's out.

151
00:20:55,634 --> 00:21:00,552
You could uh... just call me directly,
you know, like a normal person.

152
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:11,524
There's no green ones.

153
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:14,430
- I like green.
- Hm.

154
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,462
Fucking ass hole!

155
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,410
Why am I here?

156
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:21,494
State Senator Albert Votto.

157
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:25,600
I ran his father's security
back in the '80s.

158
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,590
Lost track of him after his arraignment.

159
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,653
I found a green one.

160
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:34,581
The wife - Votto Junior's wife -

161
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:37,478
kills herself a couple of years ago.

162
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:41,510
Their teenage daughter's
been running away from home ever since.

163
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,564
I'm listening.

164
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:52,638
Votto calls me this morning.

165
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:54,259
She's been missing all weekend.

166
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,628
