1
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,094
They're leaving town.

2
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,272
Wyatt.

3
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,596
Ike Clanton,
Andy Warshaw, Latigo...

4
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,925
Curly Bill Brocius.

5
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:19,548
Who's in the corral, Virg?

6
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:20,727
Billy Clanton.

7
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,141
And the McLowerys.

8
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,075
We've come to disarm you.

9
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,004
Raise your hands
over your heads!

10
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,409
Virgil?

11
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,072
Can't walk.

12
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,092
Morg?

13
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,077
It's the shoulder.

14
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,871
- Doc?
- Yeah?

15
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:48,853
Did Virg deputize you?

16
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,902
I swore to something
he was muttering about.

17
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,568
Then wear the badge.

18
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:04,088
Virg, let me help you.
Here... here.

19
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:18,267
I'm all right, doc.
See to Virg.

20
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,888
- Doc, he's hit.
- It's just my leg.

21
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,782
Just stay still, Virg.

22
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,268
Well, arrest 'em.

23
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,173
I don't know if a county sheriff can
arrest a city marshal without a warrant.

24
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,484
We can take him if you can't.

25
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,104
We got enough guns
to settle the whole thing right here.

26
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,540
You're under arrest.

27
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,719
For what?

28
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,904
Murder.

29
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:54,237
Not today, tomorrow, or ever.

30
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,856
You don't have jurisdiction
in the city of Tombstone.

31
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,000
If you did,
you couldn't make it stick.

32
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,788
We got enough men behind us
to make it stick.

33
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:05,684
Stillwell, if you so much as turn
your head toward those men,

34
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,759
you'll be laying in the horse manure
with your friends.

35
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:13,623
Wyatt, give me a hand here.

36
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,655
I'll get a warrant.
I'm serving you, Wyatt!

37
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:23,637
Your badge
won't help you this time.

38
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:52,020
Please accept my condolences,
Mr. Clanton.

39
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,524
We'll be ready in a moment.

40
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,856
You got the warrants now?

41
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,683
Ready for the judge's signature.

42
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,344
If you'd had the law in your hands,

43
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:03,710
Wyatt would've let you lock them up
out at the corral. I know him.

44
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,630
It was a stupid play
to try without it.

45
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:08,084
I didn't have the warrants

46
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,672
because I didn't think the Earps
would be alive to be served.

47
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:13,914
At least, that's what you told me.

48
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:16,220
Yeah, they're alive now.

49
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,142
But their hands are dirty.

50
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,443
And you all got to understand that.

51
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,024
That's what's going to get you
elected city marshal.

52
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:28,700
That is if the county doesn't let the Earps
slip through our fingers at the trial.

53
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,636
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I don't intend to.

54
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:34,264
Get this through your heads.

55
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:38,999
If this were back east,
I could make law the way they do.

56
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,361
But the best thing
I can do out here is buy it.

57
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:44,504
You get good value, don't you?

58
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:46,200
It's been working.

59
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,656
It works until the east gets here.

60
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,483
But if I'm not big enough to buck them

61
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:55,861
when they start to corner the ranges
and the railroads and the stockyards,

62
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,131
you boys are going to have to go back
to living on what the county pays you.

63
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,573
But meanwhile...

64
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,711
Meanwhile, if we don't
wanna get eaten up,

65
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:06,078
we're going to have to grow bigger
and faster than nature intended.

66
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:07,896
Yeah...

67
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:12,277
and hope their brothers don't continue
to be so lucky as they were this morning.

68
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,555
They won't.

69
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,112
One way or another.

70
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,020
We are ready now,
Mr. Clanton.

71
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:42,614
I hope you are satisfied,
Mr. Clanton.

72
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,752
I am.

73
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:30,901
Yay, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

74
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:35,230
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

75
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:39,092
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me...

76
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:42,870
Why did you give up practice
in dentistry and take up gambling?

77
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,398
What's the word they use?
Irrelevant?

78
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:48,854
I'll rule on that, Mr. Holiday.
You answer the question.

79
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,700
Was it because of your illness?

80
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,888
Partially.

81
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,537
Or as your
growing reputation as a killer?

82
00:10:56,607 --> 00:11:01,080
No. I found there was more gold
in people's pockets than in their mouths.

83
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,677
Does that satisfy you?

84
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:04,028
Eminently.

85
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,682
What was your reason

86
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:11,540
for volunteering your services
as a gunfighter to the Earp family?

87
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:13,371
I owed Wyatt Earp a favor.

88
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:18,996
You mean you killed a man you didn't
even know as a favor to another?

89
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:22,203
I killed a lot of men I didn't know
between 1861 and 1865.

90
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,027
Nobody said anything about it then.

91
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,207
War, Mr. Holliday.

92
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,516
Well, I never did
understand the difference.

93
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,557
How many men have you killed
as a civilian?

94
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:33,461
Oh, I don't know.
Somewhere between 18 and 25.

95
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:37,212
I presume they were all quarrels
over your gentlemanly honor.

96
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,475
No. Over money.
That's my profession.

97
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,843
Are you finished?

98
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,821
No. No, not quite.

99
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:49,308
Then you admit
that you accepted a deputy's badge

100
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,150
and used it as a cloak to cover
an act of homicide as a favor?

101
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,168
I accepted a deputy's badge
to uphold the law against lke Clanton

102
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,627
who was threatening it
with a gang of gunmen...

103
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,573
until he decided to pull out
and sacrifice his brother

104
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:06,843
to make the Earps look like baby killers
so they'd lose votes.

105
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:10,294
You're out of order, Mr. Holliday.
Just answer the question.

106
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:15,960
Did you not, as a fact,
accept a deputy's badge and...

107
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:18,584
- I don't need a badge to kill.
- Only the word of Wyatt Earp!

108
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,727
I'd go to hell and back
on the word of Wyatt Earp.

109
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,457
So would half the men in this room.

110
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:26,618
And you observed these impressions
of the gunfight from where, Mr. Clanton?

111
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:30,461
Fly's Photographic Gallery
across from the O.K. Corral.

112
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:34,039
I see.
With the court's permission.

113
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,164
Is Andrew Warshaw in the court?

114
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,149
Yeah. Right here.

115
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:42,295
Would you mind
standing up, Mr. Warshaw?

116
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,302
Is Andrew Warshaw
in your employ?

117
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:46,519
Yes, he is.

118
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,365
Is this the same Andrew Warshaw
who's wanted in Pecos County, Texas

119
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,049
on two counts of armed robbery
and three of murder?

120
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,093
I wouldn't know that.

121
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,655
In what capacity do you employ
Mr. Warshaw?

122
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,483
Scientific stock breeder.

123
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,000
I see.

124
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,460
Now, Andrew Warshaw
has been observed regularly

125
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,731
wearing a six-gun and
saddle holstering a Winchester carbine.

126
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,898
Are these normally considered
the tools of his profession?

127
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,520
Maybe he has
to force the stock to breed.

128
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,530
Mr. Holliday...
that will be all.

129
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,566
You can sit down now,
Mr. Warshaw.

130
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:32,599
Would William Brocius
please stand up?

131
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:37,301
Is William Brocius
in your employ?

132
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:38,716
Yes, he is.

133
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,855
Is this the same William Brocius

134
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:44,604
who is wanted variously
on eight counts of murder

135
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:48,086
in Kansas City, Missouri,
Abilene, Texas, Gallup, New Mexico

136
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,777
between the years 1878 and 1881?

137
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,822
I wouldn't know that, either.

138
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:54,749
In what capacity
do you employ him?

139
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,927
Bookkeeper.

140
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,006
- I beg your pardon?
- Bookkeeper.

141
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,829
I see.
That'll be all, Mr. Brocius.

142
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,508
Now, is it a fact that you're
a heavy financial backer

143
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:11,193
of another one of your employees,
Pete Spence,

144
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:14,711
for the Tombstone City Marshal post
now held by Virgil Earp?

145
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,059
It is a fact.

146
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,540
That will be all.

147
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,004
When you heard the shooting,

148
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,170
why did you not go to the aid
of your brother and the McLowerys?

149
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:33,108
It's been so long since there's been
a gunfight in this county,

150
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:35,419
I could scarcely believe my ears.

151
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,999
When you did ascertain
that a gunfight was actually in progress,

152
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,183
what did you do?

153
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,327
Nothing. I was unarmed.

154
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:47,895
I find that my familiarity with weapons
is not an asset to me as a businessman.

155
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:52,756
It has been stated
that your employees...

156
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:55,067
the bookkeeper
and the cattle breeder...

157
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:57,851
were armed.
Why, Mr. Clanton?

158
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:00,853
I've been told that there's
a plot to assassinate me.

159
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,536
Because of my stand for freedom
of the range against the easterners.

160
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,122
In my opinion...

161
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:11,868
such was the purpose of
the marshal's attack on the O.K. Corral.

162
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:14,362
That is all.

163
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:19,323
Then you did have an animosity
toward the Clanton group

164
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,627
prior to October 26, 1881?

165
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:23,288
Everyone in town knows I did.

166
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:26,076
Oh, Marshal, you walked down
to that O.K. Corral

167
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:29,012
with your brothers and Doc Holliday
in a state of frustration,

168
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:31,803
with malice in your heart,
toward lke Clanton and his group.

169
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,318
I've said that. Repeating the question
won't make it any stronger.

170
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:36,733
That's all.

171
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:41,182
Just a moment, Your Honor.
I should like to reexamine the defendant.

172
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,076
Wyatt, did malice move you
against the Clanton group?

173
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:47,157
No.

174
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,889
Would you tell the court what did?

175
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,667
The Clanton group was armed

176
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,604
and made threats
of death and violence against us.

177
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,835
It was our duty as sworn peace officers
to disarm and arrest them.

178
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:02,520
I would disarm and arrest
General Ulysses S. Grant

179
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,202
if he appeared on the streets of
Tombstone under those circumstances.

180
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,619
Wyatt, I told you
before you went down to the corral

181
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:13,918
that I had met with the Clanton group
and they agreed to leave town peaceably.

182
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:17,561
Bryan, you take bribes. You're a thief,
a liar, and a disgrace to your office.

183
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,500
I wouldn't take your word
if you swore to it on your mother's grave.

184
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,606
You'll live to regret that.

185
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:28,251
I want to recall Sheriff Bryan.

186
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,334
Now, Sheriff Bryan...

187
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:45,181
would you mind repeating under oath
the statement you just made?

188
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,876
I said I attempted
to stop the Earps and Holliday

189
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:52,668
as they marched down the street
toward the corral.

190
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,328
How did you go about that?

191
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:58,582
I told them that none of the men
at the corral were looking for trouble.

192
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:01,208
They had all agreed
to leave town immediately.

193
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,937
And what was their reply?

194
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:04,919
They ignored me.

195
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,517
And what did you do then?

196
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,528
I watched them.

197
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:15,741
I saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLowery
raise their hands above their heads...

198
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:19,254
and Tom McLowery threw back his coat
and lapel to show that he was unarmed!

199
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,715
And that's when the Earps
and Holliday opened fire!

200
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,027
- You swear this under oath?
- I do!

201
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:27,291
That they fired on the deceased
with their coats open

202
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,595
and their hands raised in the air!

203
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:32,828
That's all, Your Honor.

204
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:38,011
So we see that the prosecution has
introduced a substantial body of evidence

205
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:40,249
pointing to the guilt
of the defendants.

206
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:43,701
And much of this stands unrefuted
by the defense.

207
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,531
But in the last analysis,

208
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,468
the prosecution's case
turns on two points.

209
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,259
Whether in fact
the shooting was a crime,

210
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:53,082
and whether there was a motive.

211
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,052
As to the first point,

212
00:17:56,126 --> 00:18:01,560
both the coroner's report and the
independent medical testimony indicate

213
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,853
that William Clanton's wrist
was penetrated from the outside

214
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,984
and that the bullet lodged
in his abdomen.

215
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,708
That is not the wound received
by a man with his hands in the air.

216
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:20,123
Tom McLowery's wounds were not
the sort that could be received

217
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:23,060
with his hands
on his lapels like that,

218
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,484
but rather with his hands
around a Winchester carbine

219
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,820
which he had recently extracted
from his horse's saddle holster.

220
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:34,712
The testimony of Sheriff Bryan
therefore stands refuted.

221
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:39,316
Therefore, since no crime
has been established...

222
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:41,300
or even a motive for one...

223
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:46,134
I find that the defendants
were fully justified in their actions,

224
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:50,679
and that these homicides occurred
in the discharge of their official duties.

225
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,099
The case of the prosecution
is therefore dismissed.

226
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,149
Court is adjourned.

227
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,645
Everybody rise.

228
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,224
Well, shooting from the front side
didn't work.

229
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:13,203
Next time, he'll try it from the back.

230
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,148
We'll get Clanton at the election.
Thanks, Horace.

231
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,651
See you at the polls.

232
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:21,210
Good night.

233
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,272
Harry... take this over to Doc
before you check out, will ya?

234
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:27,157
Okay.

235
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,828
- Good night, Marshal.
- Good night, Harry.

236
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:37,495
Hit me.

237
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:39,322
How much the baby weigh?

238
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,779
Too much.
Don't distract me.

239
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,023
Hit me again.

240
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:46,811
- Charley, I don't think that...
- Just give me the card, will ya?

241
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:51,287
If the population keeps growing

242
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,076
and you keep stopping in here
every time you deliver a baby,

243
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,484
you're gonna go broke.

244
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,140
I can't understand
why I never win.

245
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:04,083
You don't play very well.
Besides that, you never cheat.

246
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:06,547
Cheat?
Do you?

247
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,597
No, I'm too good.
I don't have to.

248
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,834
Well, if you weren't that good?

249
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,179
I'd cheat.

250
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,499
Well, I'll be damned.

251
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:19,443
I don't think
the correct word is "cheat," Charley.

252
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,195
What is that word? Just how much
is a player supposed to lose?

253
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:24,691
Well, now...

254
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,082
the house rules fix the percentage.
The regulars know the odds.

255
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,257
Doc's just trying to keep you
from giving us your money.

256
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,992
Checked the horses and the prisoners.
You're on duty.

257
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,543
Don't you think it's time
to go home, Charley?

258
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,043
I'll walk along with you.

259
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,660
Nope. I'm gonna stay
and do a little rule bending.

260
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,067
Good night.

261
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:17,879
Harry.

262
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,347
Harry, wake up.

263
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:24,023
Harry, get out of bed.

264
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:25,850
I just got into bed.

265
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,635
There's someone breaking in
downstairs in the barbershop.

266
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:31,255
What can they steal
in the barbershop?

267
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:33,814
Harry, do you want me
to go downstairs?

268
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:35,958
Sure. You go. You go.

269
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,511
All right. All right.

270
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,800
- Marshal.
- Get my brother. Get my brother, please.

271
00:22:45,471 --> 00:22:46,747
Morg, check the alley!

272
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,237
It's your brother, Marshal.

273
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,212
- Virgil, you all right?
- Couldn't see.

274
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,774
- Stick with us.
- I don't feel anything.

275
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,756
- Where'd the shots come from?
- Barbershop.

276
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,572
Out of the way, Wyatt.

277
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,278
Hold him up, will ya?

278
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:11,002
Harry, did you see anything?

279
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,459
No. Nothing. Nothing.

280
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:17,654
Harry, you're lying.
Who did you see?

281
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,319
It was dark.

282
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,803
Where was it dark, Harry?

283
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:31,066
Marshal... I got a boy and a wife.

284
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:34,010
So has Virgil.

285
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,697
I can't.
They'll kill me.

286
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:40,281
That won't help nothing.

287
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:44,314
Harry, you've got just as much to fear
from me as you have from Clanton.

288
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,292
Now, who was it?

289
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:50,651
It makes no difference
what you do to me.

290
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,419
I can't.

291
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:58,716
Unless you promise I don't have
to say this to anyone but you.

292
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,691
All right, Harry.
You've got my word.

293
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:10,933
Stilwell.

294
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:12,829
You said "they."

295
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,155
Brocius.

296
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,659
And Spence.

297
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:19,036
And Warshaw.

298
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,503
All right, Harry.

299
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:28,087
Whereas six witnesses
for the defense have testified

300
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:31,933
that the accused, Peter Spence,
Andrew Warshaw, and William Brocius

301
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:34,070
were playing poker
at the Alhambra Saloon

302
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:37,012
at the time of the assault
on Marshal Earp's life,

303
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:39,573
and whereas Sheriff Bryan
has sworn

304
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:43,094
that his deputy, Frank Stilwell,
was on duty at the county jail...

305
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:48,665
...and since the city prosecutor has failed
to produce any evidence to the contrary

306
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,734
or any witnesses
to the actual assault

307
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:54,839
or to the number
or identity of assailants...

308
00:24:58,302 --> 00:24:59,644
Mr. Fitch?

309
00:25:06,494 --> 00:25:09,843
Therefore, the charges of feloniously
assaulting Marshal Virgil Earp

310
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:13,693
brought by the city of Tombstone
against these defendants are dismissed.

311
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:15,831
This court is adjourned.

312
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:17,014
Everybody rise.

313
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,723
Wyatt, he knew you had a witness.
He gave you every chance...

314
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,862
Let it go, Tom.

315
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,527
I'll be damned
if I understand a man

316
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:40,315
whose word to a waiter
is more important than his brother.

317
00:25:40,382 --> 00:25:42,771
The law won't work
when part of it is ignored

318
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:45,563
because everyone is either
bought off or terrified.

319
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,932
Then I'll enforce the part
that does work.

320
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,274
Wyatt...

321
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:52,915
Your brother will be
a cripple for life.

322
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:58,300
Who's gonna take his place
on the ballot, Wyatt?

323
00:25:58,366 --> 00:25:59,893
I am.

324
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:15,320
I don't wanna hear
a word from you.

325
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,819
I'm just educating myself.

326
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:18,803
I've never been
on the right side of the law.

327
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,431
I want to see how much good
it does you when you are.

328
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:32,955
Andy Warshaw.

329
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,514
Andrew Warshaw.

330
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:37,338
Andrew Warshaw.

331
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:39,923
Anson Safford.

332
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,423
Anson Safford.

333
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:44,086
Anson Safford.

334
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,755
Nervous?

335
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,307
Fair amount.

336
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,370
Well, it should be over
by midnight.

337
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,662
I won, didn't I?

338
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:51,795
Yes, Morgan.

339
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,266
You did.

340
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,022
Wyatt?

341
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:23,603
What'd he say?

342
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,026
When we were kids,

343
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:31,672
we used to argue about whether,
when you were dying,

344
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:34,808
your whole life
flashed in front of you or not.

345
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:38,715
He said,
"It ain't so, Wyatt."

346
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,614
There's two more bags
in the carriage.

347
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,055
What are you gonna do, Wyatt?

348
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:04,763
I'm taking them to Tucson to meet
the transcontinental train to California.

349
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:08,535
Virgil will bury Morgan
out there with my folks.

350
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,159
I don't mean that.
What about here?

351
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,302
What do you want us to do?

352
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:15,130
Nothing.

353
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:17,435
I'll take legal action
when I get back.

354
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:19,706
The runner-up takes office
in Tombstone.

355
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:23,287
We had to swear in Spence
as City Marshal this morning.

356
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:25,943
You're not gonna find
any legal action that's gonna stick.

357
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:27,770
We'll see.

358
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:31,351
We've gotten together $20,000
to post his reward money.

359
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:32,535
Thank you, Hansen.

360
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:33,849
All aboard!

361
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:38,228
Horace.

362
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:41,879
You'll get a telegram from me
by the time you reach Tucson, Wyatt.

363
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,005
What are you doing here?

364
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,306
I'm crazy about trains.

365
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:03,162
Telegram for you, Mr. Earp.

366
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,343
Thank you.

367
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:15,831
"I've secured your appointment,
Federal Marshal,

368
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:18,291
"and authority you form posse.

369
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:23,963
"Arrest suspects Stilwell,
Spence, Brocius, and Warshaw.

370
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,688
"Warrants in mail.

371
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:28,343
Sorry, no public funds available.
Horace Solomon."

372
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,421
He doesn't name Clanton.

373
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:33,112
Not enough evidence
to get a warrant against Clanton.

374
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:36,051
Well, you got the first gun
for your posse.

375
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,100
You hear the part
about no funds available?

376
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:42,843
I hear the Chamber of Commerce
has put up $20,000 reward money.

377
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,205
For arrest and conviction.
Not dead or alive.

378
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,699
Not your style, Doc.

379
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:51,548
For that kind of money,
I can be as law-abiding as, uh...

380
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:53,622
...you are.

381
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:24,858
- Hi, Sherm.
- Wyatt.

382
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:26,202
Thanks for meeting us.

383
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:27,862
I'm very sorry about Morgan.

384
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:30,901
Yeah. You know Doc Holliday.
Sherman McMasters.

385
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:34,683
You were the arresting officer when
I shot Long Nose Ernie here in '74.

386
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:35,862
That's right.

387
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:37,046
Good to see ya.

388
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:38,230
Wyatt.

389
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:42,588
I got a tip, and figured it mightn't wait,
so I came out to meet you.

390
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:43,668
Yeah?

391
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,866
You can talk in front of me.
We just went in business together.

392
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,343
Clanton sent Frank Stilwell
and two of his gun hands into Tucson.

393
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,803
I think he means to make
a clean sweep of the Earps.

394
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,539
Where do you think it'll come?

395
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:00,955
There's no telling.

396
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:03,258
If I were you,
I'd get my family off to California,

397
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:05,235
take this train back to Tombstone.

398
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:23,574
I wish you'd sign on, Sherm.

399
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,414
I would, Wyatt,
but I can't afford it.

400
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,675
You know they only pay
$53 a month in Tucson?

401
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,986
With a family, that keeps me
on the edge all the time.

402
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:36,184
I'll match that out of my own pocket,
plus a half...

403
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:38,970
and you get a crack
at the $20,000 reward.

404
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,689
You'll take this train
back to Tombstone?

405
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:43,252
Yeah.

406
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:45,334
I'll get my gear.

407
00:34:48,765 --> 00:34:51,067
Stilwell's had time
to get to Tucson.

408
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:01,874
Take care of your family.

409
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:01,879
All aboard!

410
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,388
Stilwell...
you're under arrest.

411
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:08,627
Drop the shotgun.

412
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:12,984
Now the gun belt.

413
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:25,843
Before you start steaming, lke,

414
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:29,562
Tucson has issued a homicide warrant
for Earp for Stilwell's murder.

415
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:31,287
We'll serve it in Tombstone.

416
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:33,529
What happened to the two hands
you sent with him?

417
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:35,507
- Earp nailed the first one.
- And the other?

418
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,970
- He, uh...
- Yes?

419
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:39,321
He left.

420
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:57,236
Now...

421
00:38:58,493 --> 00:38:59,606
Bryan.

422
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:04,114
If I gave you a posse
of 25 men...

423
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:08,499
you think you might be able
to find Earp and maybe even arrest him?

424
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:12,060
I can handle it, Mr. Clanton.

425
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:13,713
Ike...

426
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:17,363
This is local law
against federal law.

427
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:18,779
It's gotten too big for us.

428
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:21,463
They'll send troops here
if anything happens to Earp.

429
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,842
Sit down, Roy.

430
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:28,370
Advice like that
I can get cheaper than you come.

431
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:32,762
Bryan, after you organize your posse,

432
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:37,139
I want you to put 20 men under Spence
as Deputy City Marshals.

433
00:39:37,213 --> 00:39:38,806
Put Latigo in charge.

434
00:39:39,582 --> 00:39:40,596
Latigo?

435
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:44,918
Solomon, Clum, and the rest of them are
bound to organize a vigilante committee.

436
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,023
I want them disarmed
and out of the way.

437
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:49,238
Okay, Mr. Clanton.

438
00:39:50,142 --> 00:39:53,338
Ike? Bryan and Latigo
don't have to handle that.

439
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:55,161
I can take care of it.
It's my job.

440
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,379
You won't even be here.
You're going to disappear.

441
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:01,842
How do you mean disappear?

442
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,503
I'm the city marshal now.
I can stand up to Earp.

443
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:06,428
You're a joke.

444
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,547
Earp would drop you and a dozen
like you quicker than he did Stilwell.

445
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:15,635
Brocius, you like to drink.

446
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:19,316
Go to Texas
and booze yourself into silence.

447
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,048
Sure.

448
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,502
Warshaw?

449
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:26,231
I've been to Texas, Mr. Clanton.

450
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:29,650
If you want me to go, I'll go, but I can
find a spot right here in the ranch,

451
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:32,278
stay there real quiet,
and just not go no place.

452
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:36,917
The city marshal
can't just disappear.

453
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:38,265
Business trip.

454
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:42,267
That'll take money.

455
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:46,354
You've had all the money you're going
to get out of me. Find it somewhere else.

456
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,467
I can't go, lke.

457
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:52,594
The talking's over, Spence.

458
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,083
What do you think you're doing?

459
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:19,986
Marshal Spence heard some
of you people been wearing guns.

460
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,916
We have orders to find out.

461
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,508
Whose orders?

462
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,264
Marshal Spence.
We're his deputies.

463
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,505
Where is the marshal?
I wanna talk to him.

464
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:30,395
- He's out of town.
- Why?

465
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:33,075
Business trip.

466
00:41:33,149 --> 00:41:35,059
May I have your firearms?

467
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:39,226
No.
I challenge your authority.

468
00:41:39,293 --> 00:41:41,202
John. John.

469
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:45,939
That's not gonna
get us anywhere now.

470
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:47,769
After all, they are the law.

471
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:49,430
You're just playing
into their hands.

472
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:50,777
He's right, John.

473
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:12,469
I'll let you know
when you can pick up your irons.

474
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,134
You won't have it that long.

475
00:42:38,685 --> 00:42:40,343
I'll leave these gentlemen to you.

476
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:43,762
I can't stand pillars of society
when I'm not taking their money.

477
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:49,046
Here's your posse authorization.
I'm glad to see you.

478
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:51,986
Gentlemen, this is
Sherman McMasters from Tucson.

479
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:53,173
Anson Safford.

480
00:42:53,245 --> 00:42:54,358
John.

481
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,906
Now, what do they want?

482
00:43:01,981 --> 00:43:04,851
They've got what they wanted.
Our guns.

483
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:07,477
Spence's men
ordered us disarmed.

484
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:08,978
Where is Spence?

485
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,835
Out of town.
On business.

486
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:17,714
Well, it's Spence's duty
just as it was Virgil's to disarm you.

487
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:19,251
You're not defending Spence?!

488
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,371
Just the law.

489
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,533
What were you doing
wearing a gun, John?

490
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:27,477
That mob of Clanton's
armed to the teeth.

491
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:30,583
I want to arm a hundred men,
organize a vigilante's committee,

492
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:32,954
back you,
take this town away from Clanton!

493
00:43:33,021 --> 00:43:35,093
They're legally elected.

494
00:43:35,165 --> 00:43:38,198
Till they step out of line, neither you
nor I have a right to touch them.

495
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:40,571
If we do...
you said it in court...

496
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:42,066
you've got anarchy.

497
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,694
All right.
What do you think we should do?

498
00:43:44,765 --> 00:43:46,194
Just sit tight.

499
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:49,302
Clanton's got a murder warrant
out on you for Stilwell's death.

500
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:51,762
Bryan's got a posse together
to serve it.

501
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,746
Let him.
He hasn't got a case.

502
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:55,894
You can get it kicked out
of court, can't you?

503
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:59,128
You won't be alive
long enough to get to court.

504
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:02,897
Do you know that for a fact?

505
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,486
The way I see it, if Clanton actually
wants you arrested and taken to jail,

506
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:08,794
these deputies could do it
easily right now.

507
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:10,290
I don't see 'em moving.

508
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:13,660
I know it's against your principles
to run away from the law,

509
00:44:13,725 --> 00:44:18,198
but under the circumstances, my advice
to you right now is... start movin'.

510
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:25,942
I think you're right, Horace.

511
00:44:26,941 --> 00:44:29,330
Don't think I don't appreciate
your offer, John.

512
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:36,022
Sherm, the situation
has changed here.

513
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:39,382
Bryan's got his posse on my tail.

514
00:44:39,453 --> 00:44:41,842
Clum feels they're
gonna try to kill me.

515
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:43,706
They'll have to catch up
with us first.

516
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:46,162
That's what I mean.
You got a wife and children.

517
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:47,993
I had 'em when I started.

518
00:44:50,141 --> 00:44:53,654
There's a water station about 20 miles
up the line. We'll drop off there.

519
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:55,961
You get us outfitted
and meet us there.

520
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,458
I'll meet you there, too.

521
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:02,037
I'm gonna raise a posse for you...
not the kind you'd come up with...

522
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:04,663
...but it'll be a posse.

523
00:45:06,685 --> 00:45:08,114
Wyatt...

524
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:10,164
Damnit, I hate to see you
make a wrong move here.

525
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:12,724
Let me organize the vigilante's committee.
Just say the word.

526
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:16,282
No. But thank you, John.

527
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:48,401
You sure got cheated
on that table.

528
00:45:48,477 --> 00:45:52,274
I know you can draw before I can raise
this up. Go on! Get it over with!

529
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,738
I got no such thing
in mind, Jack.

530
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:57,530
I wasn't duckin' out on you, Doc.
I know I owe you 800.

531
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:59,986
I just been saving up, that's all.

532
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:04,152
Sure. What would I want
with a lousy $6.50 anyway?

533
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:05,977
You see, the thing is...

534
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:08,434
I'm in the hole for another thousand
with Bill Rayner.

535
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,854
So there wouldn't be much point
in shootin' a bankrupt.

536
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:16,122
That's it. You'd just be gettin'
yourself a lot of trouble with Bill.

537
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:17,465
He'd be sore as hell at you

538
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:20,347
if you was to kill me
and me still owin' him all that money.

539
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:25,147
Supposin' we go
for a little walk?

540
00:46:25,212 --> 00:46:27,449
I'd sooner you give it
to me right here.

541
00:46:29,597 --> 00:46:31,190
Put that thing away.

542
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,818
That's for the drinks
and the table.

543
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:51,026
Raise your right hand.

544
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:55,067
Do you solemnly swear to enforce
the laws of the United States of America

545
00:46:55,132 --> 00:46:58,166
and the territory of Arizona to the best
of your abilities, so help you God?

546
00:46:58,237 --> 00:46:59,895
Well, you must be
out of your mind.

547
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:02,202
- Say, "I do."
- I do.

548
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:04,505
You are now
a Deputy Federal Marshal.

549
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,685
I am?

550
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:08,626
There's $15,000
reward money in this.

551
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,457
Spence, Brocius, and Warshaw.

552
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:11,802
Dead or alive?

553
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:14,228
Arrest and conviction.

554
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:17,334
The way you handle a gun,
you're lucky that's the way it is.

555
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:19,160
- When do I start?
- Right now.

556
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,659
All right, you men.
Off the wagons. Off the wagons!

557
00:47:44,733 --> 00:47:47,351
Get your tools.
Let's go! Let's move out!

558
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,330
Pick it up! Pick it up!

559
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:53,842
All right, you men.
Let's go. Let's go.

560
00:47:55,645 --> 00:47:58,612
All right, let's get the lead out.
Let's move!

561
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:02,617
All right, let's get it in there!

562
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,585
Pretty dangerous fellas
you got here.

563
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:09,074
Might scorch you
with one of them headlamps.

564
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,435
Hello, Doc.

565
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:14,997
A gunslinger like you
bullying miners.

566
00:48:15,868 --> 00:48:17,624
You oughta be ashamed
of yourself.

567
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:18,903
I have to make a living.

568
00:48:18,973 --> 00:48:21,428
You don't have to make it
busting mining strikes.

569
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:22,962
That's what they pay me for.

570
00:48:23,037 --> 00:48:25,907
I just can't make it
as a hired gun in the west anymore.

571
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,409
Well...

572
00:48:27,484 --> 00:48:29,786
Ike Clanton's hirin' guns right now.

573
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:31,992
I wouldn't raise a finger
against the Earps.

574
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,617
That's what I
wanna talk to you about.

575
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:38,005
- Wyatt staked you, didn't he?
- After I got outta jail.

576
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:40,051
- So? He still staked ya.
- He sent me to jail!

577
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:42,197
- You still owe him a favor.
- I did him a favor.

578
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:44,374
I didn't hire my gun to Clanton.

579
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:48,407
No, you just used it
to push poor miners around.

580
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:51,226
Well... you don't expect me
to work, do ya?

581
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,721
Raise your right hand.

582
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:54,074
What for?

583
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,050
I'm gettin' up a posse.

584
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,230
- Against Clanton?
- That's right.

585
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:59,413
Why should I?

586
00:49:02,012 --> 00:49:03,441
That's a foolish question.

587
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:07,290
Yeah.

588
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:11,926
And there's $15,000
reward money in it.

589
00:49:14,557 --> 00:49:17,459
Do you solemnly swear to uphold
the laws of the United States of America

590
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:21,144
and the territory of Arizona to the best
of your abilities, so help you God?

591
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:24,474
- I do.
- You are now a Deputy Federal Marshal.

592
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,653
Follow me.

593
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:32,598
Texas Jack Vermillion,
this is Turkey Creek Johnson.

594
00:49:34,844 --> 00:49:36,273
How'd he sucker you?

595
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,902
Well, you see,
I owed him this $800.

596
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:56,403
You sure they're hiding
over at Clanton's ranch?

597
00:49:58,205 --> 00:49:59,798
Only one way to find out.

598
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,804
It's right over them mountains,
ain't it?

599
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:05,365
Maybe Wyatt isn't headed
for Clanton's ranch at all.

600
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:07,641
Maybe he's just trying
to put a lot of rough ground

601
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:10,010
between that posse of Bryan and us.

602
00:50:10,077 --> 00:50:11,964
Is that possible, Wyatt?

603
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:17,938
If that's so, we oughta move outta here
before we get squeezed in the middle.

604
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:20,827
I think the boys are trying to tell you
it'd be a lot safer

605
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,867
if we headed away
from Clanton's place.

606
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,722
- Nobody said that.
- Then stop thinking about it!

607
00:50:25,788 --> 00:50:27,479
Wyatt...

608
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:32,757
Here.

609
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,018
You know who they were?

610
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,173
It was Pete.

611
00:51:43,357 --> 00:51:44,786
Pete Spence.

612
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,202
How many were there?

613
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,497
And where's your shotgun rider?

614
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,395
If we can get him across the river,
maybe we can get some help.

615
00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:58,745
Forget it.

616
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:32,218
Mine payroll.

617
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:35,285
Why? This isn't
Spence's kind of play.

618
00:52:36,797 --> 00:52:38,455
No, it sure ain't.

619
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:39,954
It's traveling money.

620
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:43,444
I got a feeling we'll find Spence
down around Guatemala.

621
00:52:47,326 --> 00:52:49,878
I want you boys to stay here
and watch for Bryan's posse.

622
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,127
And if he does show?

623
00:52:51,197 --> 00:52:54,874
Hold 'em off if you can.
If you can't, lead 'em off downriver.

624
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:56,534
Where will you be?

625
00:52:56,605 --> 00:53:01,875
If you have to cut out, I'll meet you
at Marshal Kiergan's place in Contention.

626
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:05,080
Wyatt, Sherm asked,
"Where will you be?"

627
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,525
I'm gonna play a long shot.

628
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:11,867
No handier than Spence is.

629
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:14,322
He won't try to horse back
over those mountains.

630
00:53:14,397 --> 00:53:17,114
He'll be at Algodones
waiting for the eastbound stage.

631
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:18,840
All right. I'll go with you.

632
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,120
Doc...

633
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:23,187
I want you to stay here
and handle the posse.

634
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:26,577
Spencer's bound to have some men
with him. He wouldn't pull this alone.

635
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:28,883
I don't expect too much trouble.

636
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:31,608
Then what are
these two bodies doing here?

637
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,562
How come Wyatt don't just admit
he wants Spence for himself,

638
00:53:45,629 --> 00:53:47,418
same as I would
if he killed my brother?

639
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,747
He wants Spence
because the law says to get him.

640
00:53:51,805 --> 00:53:53,463
Then do me a favor, will ya, Doc?

641
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:56,566
As long as he's got no personal
feeling about it one way or the other,

642
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:59,354
why don't you just talk him into
taking the rest of them alive?

643
00:53:59,421 --> 00:54:01,014
I could really use that reward money.

644
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:05,242
Doc, you got any idea how to cut out
Bryan and his whole posse?

645
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:08,571
The time has come to have one.

646
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,297
Hello, Spence.

647
00:55:42,685 --> 00:55:44,278
Waiting for the stage?

648
00:55:45,213 --> 00:55:49,752
Yeah. I'm going on a trip east...
on business.

649
00:55:52,701 --> 00:55:55,418
Two men killed
on the Naco stage this morning.

650
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:58,834
The driver, shotgun rider.

651
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,297
Mine payroll was taken.

652
00:56:03,165 --> 00:56:04,726
- Mine payroll?
- Yeah.

653
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,514
When'd that happen?

654
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:11,356
Oh... half hour,
45 minutes ago.

655
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,158
From the looks of the tracks,
there was three or four men involved.

656
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,252
I'm traveling alone.

657
00:56:23,325 --> 00:56:25,398
You don't think I had anything
to do with that?

658
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,646
Traveling alone, are you?

659
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,659
Yeah, just, uh...

660
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,326
Just taking a trip east on business.

661
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,603
Both those men got it
in the back with a shotgun.

662
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,511
The same way my brothers
Virgil and Morgan got it.

663
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:42,962
Wyatt, I know how you feel
about your brothers, but...

664
00:56:43,036 --> 00:56:46,648
You know how it feels
to look down the side of a shotgun...

665
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:49,399
...at a man's back?

666
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:51,443
Wyatt, don't try
to hang that on me.

667
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:53,906
There's a federal warrant
for your arrest, Vince.

668
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,956
I was acquitted in court once,
I'll be acquitted again.

669
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:58,549
- I had nothing to do with it.
- You had nothing to do with that stage?

670
00:56:58,621 --> 00:57:00,148
Nothing!

671
00:58:07,772 --> 00:58:08,885
Charlie.

672
00:58:13,149 --> 00:58:14,261
Okay.

673
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:28,597
I see you boys made it all right.

674
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:30,011
Where's Marshal Kiergan?

675
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:32,019
Charlie said
he'd be back this evening.

676
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:45,078
- Did you find Spence?
- He's dead.

677
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:48,346
Obviously no chance
for a formal arrest.

678
00:58:48,413 --> 00:58:49,754
That's right.

679
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:53,465
Well, now, that leaves
$10,000 on the table.

680
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,126
That's right, Doc.

681
00:58:55,197 --> 00:58:57,750
Keeps this up,
we'll all lose money on the deal.

682
00:58:57,821 --> 00:58:59,348
Mine payroll?

683
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:01,592
Yeah. Sherm,
you'd better take charge of this.

684
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:05,490
Probably a little short. Spence said
he was traveling alone when I found him.

685
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:07,321
What next?

686
00:59:07,389 --> 00:59:11,862
Now we'll just stay here until we figure
Bryan's posse's moved on.

687
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:14,300
Well, you've already
had a busy day.

688
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,515
What?

689
00:59:19,837 --> 00:59:21,266
Nothin'.

690
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,653
Hey, Charlie!

691
00:59:46,556 --> 00:59:48,945
Come 'ere.
Crack another bottle, will ya?

692
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,706
He says there ain't any more.

693
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:57,586
How do you know
what he's sayin'?

694
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:01,115
'Cause I told him
not to buy any more.

695
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,955
Here's the money you gave him.

696
01:00:47,036 --> 01:00:49,589
A bottle in a bag,
a bottle for now, and a shot glass.

697
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,773
Yes, sir.

698
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:25,207
What can I do for you, sir?

699
01:01:25,276 --> 01:01:28,473
- You know Bill Brocius?
- He was here up till an hour ago.

700
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:29,970
Any idea where he went?

701
01:01:30,045 --> 01:01:32,597
Yeah. Across the street
to the Desert Queen.

702
01:01:32,668 --> 01:01:33,814
Drunk?

703
01:01:33,884 --> 01:01:35,477
He was making the rounds.

704
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:36,661
Thanks.

705
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,449
Just make sure you're not so free
giving out information about me.

706
01:01:58,524 --> 01:02:00,597
I don't even know
who you are, sir.

707
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,977
Very sloppy riding, Brocius.

708
01:03:40,477 --> 01:03:43,608
I remember seeing
something like this in the circus...

709
01:03:44,348 --> 01:03:46,104
...once when I was a child.

710
01:03:46,173 --> 01:03:49,020
They lifted up the canvas,
and there they were...

711
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:50,840
statues.

712
01:03:51,837 --> 01:03:56,692
Any of you gentlemen...
want not to be statues?

713
01:04:05,437 --> 01:04:06,811
He's drunk, Holliday.

714
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,087
So am I.

715
01:04:09,117 --> 01:04:10,643
Now, let me see.

716
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:12,123
Oh, yes.

717
01:04:12,988 --> 01:04:16,022
By authority vested in me
by the government of the United States

718
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:18,810
and the territory of Arizona...

719
01:04:18,877 --> 01:04:21,266
you, Curly Bill Brocius...

720
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,650
First unhook your gun belt.

721
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:56,984
You did that deliberately.

722
01:05:05,692 --> 01:05:06,969
What are you so sore about?

723
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,524
You got Brocius, didn't you?
That's what you wanted.

724
01:05:10,396 --> 01:05:12,633
Killing Brocius
is gonna lead Bryan right to us.

725
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,318
We can't move by surprise now.
You fixed that, Doc.

726
01:05:15,388 --> 01:05:16,817
Yeah.

727
01:05:16,892 --> 01:05:19,609
Well, everybody has
their bad luck.

728
01:05:19,676 --> 01:05:22,164
I cough when I drink.

729
01:05:22,237 --> 01:05:25,106
You come up
against sneaky people...

730
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,897
who get you
to help them commit suicide.

731
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:31,163
Get your horse, Doc.

732
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,417
Look what's comin'.

733
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,297
Play dead.

734
01:06:16,636 --> 01:06:18,546
Get your gear
and a horse, Warshaw.

735
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:19,962
You're under arrest.

736
01:06:26,076 --> 01:06:27,189
For what?

737
01:06:27,261 --> 01:06:28,373
Get his horse.

738
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:30,037
Put a blanket roll on it.

739
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:36,083
But for why?

740
01:06:36,157 --> 01:06:38,840
For felonious assault
and murder...

741
01:06:40,732 --> 01:06:42,642
...to Virgil and Morgan Earp.

742
01:06:48,156 --> 01:06:49,814
I didn't do either of those.

743
01:06:50,653 --> 01:06:52,082
You were seen.

744
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,313
Well, I swear to you
I didn't do 'em.

745
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,670
What did you do?

746
01:07:02,812 --> 01:07:05,846
I only watched
to see that no one came.

747
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:07,291
From the barbershop?

748
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,138
Around the corner
from your brother Virgil only.

749
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:13,563
I wasn't in the barbershop
with the guns.

750
01:07:15,228 --> 01:07:18,577
What did you do
when Morgan was shot?

751
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:23,993
Again, I only watched.

752
01:07:24,796 --> 01:07:25,876
Where?

753
01:07:29,788 --> 01:07:32,177
In the alley
behind the billiard parlor.

754
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:36,115
Why'd you watch?

755
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:45,531
Well... to see that the men
with the guns were left alone.

756
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,152
Clanton pay you for that?

757
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:52,090
Well, sure.
He always pays me.

758
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:54,294
I work here for Clanton.

759
01:07:54,364 --> 01:07:55,477
What'd he pay?

760
01:07:58,428 --> 01:08:00,500
Oh, hell.
If I told you that...

761
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:01,521
What'd he pay?

762
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,598
He paid...

763
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:07,634
...$50 to me.

764
01:08:14,652 --> 01:08:16,245
Before or after?

765
01:08:20,124 --> 01:08:21,237
After.

766
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,398
Clanton ain't so free
with his money.

767
01:08:27,452 --> 01:08:31,129
A man's life... $50.

768
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,177
I'm gonna give you a chance
to make another $50.

769
01:08:50,205 --> 01:08:51,798
I don't want such a chance.

770
01:08:52,764 --> 01:08:54,674
My men'll stay back.

771
01:08:55,357 --> 01:08:58,488
I'm gonna count,
"One, two, three."

772
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:02,516
You can draw on two,
I'll wait till three.

773
01:09:04,668 --> 01:09:08,017
If you get me,
my boys won't bother you.

774
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:10,363
Who knows?
Maybe...

775
01:09:11,164 --> 01:09:13,881
Maybe Clanton'll pay you
another $50.

776
01:09:13,948 --> 01:09:15,737
Wyatt, he can plug you.

777
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:17,659
He's too scared.

778
01:09:17,724 --> 01:09:20,659
For God's sake, Wyatt,
you got men watching you.

779
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,413
He's gonna draw first.

780
01:09:27,324 --> 01:09:29,113
I don't wanna shoot anybody.

781
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:33,200
I didn't shoot.
I only watched.

782
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:38,905
$50...
to see my brother shot.

783
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:42,003
One. Two. Three.

784
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:03,925
Take him back to his boss.

785
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:45,624
Well, it's the end of the line.

786
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:48,978
Sorry about the reward money.

787
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:52,027
You don't hear
any complaints, do ya?

788
01:10:52,092 --> 01:10:53,783
I owe you money.

789
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:57,329
You don't have call
to talk to us like that, Wyatt.

790
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:01,080
I'm sorry, Sherman.

791
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:05,464
I wanna thank you boys.

792
01:11:21,884 --> 01:11:24,535
Boy, you sure gave him a chance.

793
01:11:24,604 --> 01:11:27,735
I'd just blown his head off
as he lay in bed.

794
01:11:39,836 --> 01:11:41,429
You better have one.

795
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,736
- I don't need it.
- Oh, yes, you do.

796
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:47,798
You need it to make this morning
stay down, just like I do.

797
01:11:53,084 --> 01:11:56,433
God... when I think back...

798
01:11:56,508 --> 01:11:58,744
Five minutes after we left
the OK Corral,

799
01:11:58,812 --> 01:12:01,430
I wanted to say,
"Get Clanton, Wyatt.

800
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,737
Get him before he gets you."

801
01:12:03,804 --> 01:12:05,233
But I didn't.

802
01:12:05,308 --> 01:12:08,504
You don't...
speak that way to Wyatt Earp.

803
01:12:08,572 --> 01:12:11,355
You got too much respect for him.

804
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,097
Then Virgil got it...
and then Morgan...

805
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:19,889
And I watched you keep your word
to that waiter back in Tombstone.

806
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:23,030
You thought it was your honor that
stopped you from making him testify,

807
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,376
but it wasn't.

808
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:27,313
You couldn't get a conviction
in a Federal court or a local one,

809
01:12:27,388 --> 01:12:29,144
and you never intended to try!

810
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:31,765
You just didn't wanna be
cheated out of this!

811
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:35,153
And those aren't warrants
you got there.

812
01:12:35,228 --> 01:12:39,123
Those are hunting licenses...
Stilwell, Spence...

813
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:42,359
That was a pretty good shot
you made at Brocius. God!

814
01:12:42,428 --> 01:12:44,338
That's when I hooked it all together.

815
01:12:44,412 --> 01:12:46,997
And now Warshaw,
and then you're gonna get Clanton.

816
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:49,240
You're gonna kill Clanton
just like I would,

817
01:12:49,308 --> 01:12:51,958
and you don't need
a warrant for that.

818
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:55,290
So go on.
Go on, have one.

819
01:12:55,356 --> 01:12:59,001
If you're gonna kill like me,
you might as well drink like me!

820
01:13:23,772 --> 01:13:25,201
That's all right.

821
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,893
This stops.

822
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:35,066
I'm taking you to Colorado.

823
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:42,168
Sorry to spoil your party.

824
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:53,014
- Mr. Clanton...
- Don't tell me. I've heard it.

825
01:14:05,436 --> 01:14:09,146
Bryan, Earp and the rest of that crowd
will be heading for Colorado by now.

826
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:12,725
Well...
that does it, then.

827
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:14,072
Doesn't it?

828
01:14:15,036 --> 01:14:16,891
I mean, he can't operate
from Colorado.

829
01:14:16,956 --> 01:14:19,193
I expect you to be waiting
at the border for him.

830
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,332
Might be a little tough to do, lke.

831
01:14:21,404 --> 01:14:24,917
Your posse outnumbers Earp's
five to one. What are you worried about?

832
01:14:24,988 --> 01:14:27,705
I thought having him out of the way
was all you needed.

833
01:14:27,772 --> 01:14:31,634
I need Wyatt Earp dead and cold,
and nothing seems to get that for me.

834
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:33,715
I've been doing
the best I can, lke!

835
01:14:33,788 --> 01:14:35,828
Well, then get back to it!

836
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,617
If you don't get Earp at the border
before he moves into Colorado,

837
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:41,401
I want you to get to the governor
for papers to extradite him!

838
01:14:41,468 --> 01:14:42,679
Where will you be?

839
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,423
I'll get back to you
when I need you.

840
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:55,219
Something you wanna say?

841
01:14:59,196 --> 01:15:00,723
No.

842
01:15:31,868 --> 01:15:33,209
Good morning, Mr. Earp.

843
01:15:33,276 --> 01:15:34,617
Welcome to Denver.

844
01:15:34,683 --> 01:15:35,796
Thank you.

845
01:15:37,692 --> 01:15:38,804
302.

846
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:41,112
I put you in the room
next door to your friends.

847
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:44,948
Thank you.

848
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:50,745
Has Bryan got to the governor?
Have I been extradited? What?

849
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,153
Bryan's finished.

850
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:54,806
Who managed that?

851
01:15:55,516 --> 01:15:58,418
Well, Bryan and Clanton
had over a hundred men between them.

852
01:15:58,492 --> 01:15:59,986
Clanton left town...

853
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:03,314
...and we bought
the rest of the men off.

854
01:16:03,388 --> 01:16:05,395
You bribed them?

855
01:16:05,468 --> 01:16:08,402
I wouldn't put it that way,
but if you want to... yes.

856
01:16:08,475 --> 01:16:10,036
Where is Clanton?

857
01:16:10,108 --> 01:16:11,569
Mexico.

858
01:16:11,644 --> 01:16:12,854
Doing what?

859
01:16:14,139 --> 01:16:16,376
I should judge
stealing cattle, Wyatt.

860
01:16:16,444 --> 01:16:17,720
Prospering?

861
01:16:17,788 --> 01:16:19,762
Yes.

862
01:16:19,836 --> 01:16:21,811
What part of Mexico is he in?

863
01:16:21,884 --> 01:16:23,477
Somewhere out of Nogales.

864
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:25,620
Wyatt, we want you
back in Tombstone.

865
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:28,409
We've got an appointment for you
as Chief U.S. Marshal.

866
01:16:28,476 --> 01:16:31,607
We're growing, Wyatt.
And you can grow with us.

867
01:16:32,348 --> 01:16:33,722
Grow to what?

868
01:16:34,524 --> 01:16:36,760
Adjutant-General of the territory.

869
01:16:36,827 --> 01:16:40,024
That would make you
chief law enforcement officer in Arizona...

870
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:42,328
and that could be
just the beginning for you.

871
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,696
Do I have to give you
a yes or no right now?

872
01:16:49,788 --> 01:16:52,657
Well, we can't stall the answer
to Washington for too long.

873
01:16:57,691 --> 01:17:00,441
I'll have to give you
my answer later, gentlemen.

874
01:17:00,508 --> 01:17:02,035
Thanks for the drink.

875
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,242
We'll hear from you?

876
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:07,697
I said you would.

877
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:22,326
Once again.

878
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,801
How am I?

879
01:17:27,867 --> 01:17:30,999
If you put pipes on those lungs,
you could play a hymn. Terrible.

880
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:35,061
But I've been following your orders...
rest, fresh air, fresh eggs...

881
01:17:35,131 --> 01:17:36,244
Go on.

882
01:17:37,628 --> 01:17:39,733
You know, you don't have
to get well to please me.

883
01:17:39,804 --> 01:17:41,778
I'm used to people dying on me.

884
01:17:41,851 --> 01:17:43,193
So am I!

885
01:17:44,379 --> 01:17:47,576
Don't laugh too hard.
Those lung scars won't stand it.

886
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:50,452
My friend,
if you don't give up drinking,

887
01:17:50,524 --> 01:17:52,596
you'll go like that.

888
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:56,344
I'll say this for you...
you got one hell of a bedside manner.

889
01:17:56,411 --> 01:17:58,167
Put him back in the icebox.

890
01:18:25,436 --> 01:18:27,159
That's terrible stuff.

891
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,873
I wouldn't drink that
if I were you.

892
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:35,828
Doc.

893
01:18:39,003 --> 01:18:40,214
It's cold out here.

894
01:18:40,284 --> 01:18:44,113
I'll send for blankets and a wheelchair.
I'd like you to try it for a while.

895
01:18:44,188 --> 01:18:47,057
Don't ask for sympathy from me.
You're doing this to yourself.

896
01:18:47,131 --> 01:18:50,262
Come on, you didn't come all the way
out here to get on my back.

897
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:52,022
No...

898
01:18:52,988 --> 01:18:57,777
Solomon and a few of the others
were back at the hotel when I got there.

899
01:18:57,851 --> 01:18:59,444
I have to go back to Tombstone.

900
01:18:59,515 --> 01:19:01,042
They extradited you?

901
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:05,499
No. They want me
to be Chief U.S. Marshal.

902
01:19:05,564 --> 01:19:07,255
Well...

903
01:19:07,324 --> 01:19:10,772
Are they gonna give you enough
manpower to operate against Bryan?

904
01:19:10,843 --> 01:19:12,502
Bryan is finished.

905
01:19:12,572 --> 01:19:13,848
And Clanton?

906
01:19:14,748 --> 01:19:16,820
He's high-tailed it for Mexico.

907
01:19:16,891 --> 01:19:18,964
How'd they swing all this?

908
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:20,562
They bought their men off.

909
01:19:21,308 --> 01:19:23,031
You approve?

910
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,376
It's done.

911
01:19:24,444 --> 01:19:26,931
If it's so easy,
why didn't they do it before?

912
01:19:27,003 --> 01:19:28,661
Too expensive.

913
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:32,408
That's what I like
about your friends... idealists.

914
01:19:33,948 --> 01:19:36,119
Are you gonna take
the marshal's appointment?

915
01:19:37,532 --> 01:19:38,644
Yeah.

916
01:19:39,835 --> 01:19:43,512
You know, this could lead to me being
the Adjutant-General of the territory.

917
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:46,776
I wouldn't leave you for anything less
than that. I figured you'd understand.

918
01:19:46,844 --> 01:19:50,357
I do. I understand. You're a bigger rat
than I thought you were.

919
01:19:51,132 --> 01:19:52,408
Probably.

920
01:19:53,244 --> 01:19:55,000
You gonna be all right here?

921
01:19:55,068 --> 01:19:57,785
Yeah, except for
a slight dying spell.

922
01:19:59,164 --> 01:20:00,440
I'll see you at Tombstone.

923
01:20:00,507 --> 01:20:01,784
Absolutely.

924
01:20:01,852 --> 01:20:04,470
Hey... listen,
I wanna give this to the doctor.

925
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:06,514
Oh, no. Here.
Give it to me.

926
01:20:34,715 --> 01:20:37,017
Amazing thing... modern life.

927
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:41,528
I'm going south to Nogales,
you're going west to Tombstone,

928
01:20:41,595 --> 01:20:43,570
and we're both on the same train.

929
01:20:44,444 --> 01:20:47,477
Train fare was $18.65.

930
01:20:47,547 --> 01:20:49,936
I'm keeping the rest
for expenses.

931
01:20:51,004 --> 01:20:52,978
I believed you were going
back to Tombstone.

932
01:20:53,051 --> 01:20:55,353
I did... for about five seconds.

933
01:20:55,419 --> 01:20:57,492
Then it popped into my head...

934
01:20:57,563 --> 01:20:58,676
Clanton.

935
01:21:00,092 --> 01:21:02,328
Still Clanton, isn't it?

936
01:21:02,395 --> 01:21:03,508
Lay off it, Doc.

937
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:06,133
You let me have it once...
that's enough.

938
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:08,058
We don't have
the only law in the world.

939
01:21:08,123 --> 01:21:09,716
They've got law in Mexico.

940
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:11,129
I'm going to the federales,

941
01:21:11,195 --> 01:21:14,392
and if Clanton is operating
down there, I'll bring him back.

942
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,849
The next stop,
you use your expense money.

943
01:21:16,924 --> 01:21:20,185
Buy a return ticket
and go take care of yourself.

944
01:21:30,172 --> 01:21:31,601
No, thank you.

945
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,492
Buenos dias.

946
01:22:06,523 --> 01:22:07,800
Hello, Latigo.

947
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:22,074
- He said that...
- Yeah. I know what he said, captain.

948
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,318
Just in case he didn't tell you,

949
01:22:43,388 --> 01:22:45,144
they have tried
to arrest us before.

950
01:22:46,364 --> 01:22:49,495
Yeah, but never for stealing
Mexican government cattle before.

951
01:23:41,692 --> 01:23:42,968
Whose cattle?

952
01:23:46,107 --> 01:23:48,344
- Whose cattle?
- Clanton.

953
01:23:54,555 --> 01:23:56,311
And you...

954
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:58,289
Who hired you
to drive these cattle?

955
01:23:58,364 --> 01:23:59,574
Clanton.

956
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:07,386
Go get your warrant.

957
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:49,271
- Lieutenant.
- Senor.

958
01:24:51,868 --> 01:24:53,209
Gracias.

959
01:24:54,363 --> 01:24:55,639
- Hello.
- Hello, Captain.

960
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:56,984
Sit down, please.

961
01:24:59,196 --> 01:25:01,749
The purpose of my
sending for you is unfortunate.

962
01:25:02,715 --> 01:25:03,828
Well, let's have it.

963
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,518
The two witnesses we took
with the cattle this morning

964
01:25:06,587 --> 01:25:10,165
are dead one hour ago...
of guns through the bars of the jail.

965
01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:12,308
Those who shot
escaped into the night.

966
01:25:14,139 --> 01:25:15,416
And Clanton?

967
01:25:15,483 --> 01:25:19,061
We will bring him in to be questioned
as we will find those who killed,

968
01:25:19,131 --> 01:25:23,026
but you understand for Clanton there could
be no arrest under the circumstances.

969
01:25:25,628 --> 01:25:27,221
Yeah, I understand.

970
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:30,106
Without the two witnesses,
there could be no trial.

971
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:34,004
Thank you, Captain.

972
01:25:34,779 --> 01:25:36,634
I tried to notify you
of this immediately

973
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:38,935
because perhaps you're now
in some danger.

974
01:25:39,003 --> 01:25:40,596
Thanks for your kindness.

975
01:26:03,483 --> 01:26:05,392
- Doc?
- Yeah?

976
01:26:06,747 --> 01:26:09,049
You were right
about Warshaw and the others.

977
01:26:10,651 --> 01:26:12,560
Now you can be right
about Clanton.

978
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:15,991
Clanton's different, Wyatt.

979
01:26:17,307 --> 01:26:19,544
Warshaw was in anger.

980
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:22,000
But you're planning this one
without the law.

981
01:26:23,195 --> 01:26:26,010
You're throwing away
all the years you lived by the rules.

982
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,492
I don't care
about the rules anymore.

983
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,888
I'm not that much of a hypocrite.

984
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:36,594
The whole thing's hypocrisy.

985
01:26:36,668 --> 01:26:38,577
The rules they've tacked on say

986
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:42,480
unless you're wearin' that badge
or a soldier's uniform, you can't kill.

987
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:45,298
But they're the only rules there are.

988
01:26:46,971 --> 01:26:49,360
And they're more important
to you than you think.

989
01:26:50,363 --> 01:26:52,818
Play it that way, Wyatt...

990
01:26:53,531 --> 01:26:55,441
...or you'll destroy yourself.

991
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:57,848
I know you.

992
01:26:59,355 --> 01:27:01,111
You can't live like me.

993
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:05,492
Virg played it by the rules.

994
01:27:05,563 --> 01:27:07,319
He's crippled for life.

995
01:27:08,379 --> 01:27:11,096
Morgan... dead.

996
01:27:14,299 --> 01:27:17,016
I can't let Clanton
get away with that.

997
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,898
I know where to find him...
I'm gonna find him.

998
01:27:23,131 --> 01:27:24,244
Doc...

999
01:27:25,851 --> 01:27:28,666
Go back to the hotel.
Take care of yourself.

1000
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:33,081
No, thanks.

1001
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:46,897
You got some kind of plan?

1002
01:28:46,971 --> 01:28:48,248
I have.

1003
01:28:49,947 --> 01:28:51,376
You wanna tell me about it?

1004
01:28:52,091 --> 01:28:54,262
We take whoever gets
in our way.

1005
01:28:55,323 --> 01:28:56,849
You call that a plan?

1006
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:00,084
You got a better one?

1007
01:29:00,155 --> 01:29:01,268
No.

1008
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:15,795
Morning.

1009
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:18,769
Good morning.
Doc.

1010
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:24,947
Too bad I'm not feeling better.

1011
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:30,799
Too bad you don't listen
to your doctor.

1012
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:33,744
I should've listened
to my mother in Baltimore.

1013
01:33:43,674 --> 01:33:44,787
Wyatt?

1014
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:48,311
When we were down
with the federales...

1015
01:33:49,915 --> 01:33:53,046
...when I said about your
not being able to go back, I...

1016
01:33:55,642 --> 01:33:57,398
Well, that was talk.

1017
01:34:00,858 --> 01:34:03,030
But I have to know something.

1018
01:34:03,099 --> 01:34:05,008
Are you going back to Tombstone?

1019
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:08,403
Sure.

1020
01:34:09,883 --> 01:34:12,120
Don't lie to me this time.

1021
01:34:14,363 --> 01:34:15,639
I'm going back.

1022
01:34:17,691 --> 01:34:19,447
That's what I had to know.

1023
01:34:30,075 --> 01:34:32,147
Hey, do me a favor,
will you?

1024
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:33,496
Sure, Doc.

1025
01:34:33,563 --> 01:34:35,472
Get outta here.

1026
01:34:35,547 --> 01:34:37,140
Go on. Don't hang around.

1027
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,744
All right, Doc.

1028
01:34:45,531 --> 01:34:46,643
Wyatt?

1029
01:34:47,642 --> 01:34:48,755
Yeah?

1030
01:34:55,003 --> 01:34:56,345
So long.

1031
01:34:59,162 --> 01:35:00,504
So long, now.

1032
01:35:14,426 --> 01:35:17,241
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll be in touch with you.

1033
01:35:21,531 --> 01:35:23,702
You'll be in Denver or Tombstone?

1034
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:26,159
I'm not gonna be
in either place, Charles.

1035
01:35:26,234 --> 01:35:29,911
When he...
where will you be?

1036
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:33,908
I don't know, but I'm not
gonna be in this part of the country.

1037
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:37,142
Well, Clum told me you got
the appointment... U.S. Marshal.

1038
01:35:38,139 --> 01:35:40,211
I'm not gonna accept it, Charles.

1039
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:43,284
I'm through with the law.

1040
01:35:43,355 --> 01:35:45,744
I wanna thank you
for coming up here.

1041
01:35:48,474 --> 01:35:49,816
So long, Charley.

1042
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:19,763
God! That's terrible.

1043
01:36:19,835 --> 01:36:22,323
Where do you get that stuff?

1044
01:36:27,003 --> 01:36:28,115
Kings.

1045
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:33,363
Aces.
