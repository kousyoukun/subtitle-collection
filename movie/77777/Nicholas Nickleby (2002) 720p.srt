1
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,020
<i>What happens
when the light first pierces</i>

2
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,498
<i>the dark dampness
in which we have waited?</i>

3
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:35,338
<i>We are slapped and cut loose.</i>

4
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,772
<i>If we are lucky,
someone is there to catch us,</i>

5
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,626
<i>and persuade us
that we are safe.</i>

6
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,225
<i>But are we safe?</i>

7
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,980
<i>What happens if, too early,
we lose a parent?</i>

8
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:56,624
<i>That party on whom we rely
for only everything?</i>

9
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:00,061
<i>Why, we are cut loose again,</i>

10
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:03,543
<i>and we wonder, even dread,</i>

11
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,658
<i>whose hands will catch us now.</i>

12
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:14,583
<i>There once lived a man
named Nicholas Nickleby.</i>

13
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,101
<i>Unambitious in business,</i>

14
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:20,222
<i>he devoted himself
to the happiness of his family.</i>

15
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:24,701
<i>But he is not the Nicholas Nickleby
you have come to hear about.</i>

16
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:27,985
<i>That Nicholas Nickleby
is here.</i>

17
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:30,622
<i>And here.</i>

18
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,268
<i>And here.</i>

19
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:35,387
Said your prayers?

20
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:36,737
Yes.

21
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,821
I prayed that
I should have this day,

22
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:40,588
the same day
we had today,

23
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,185
all the rest
of my life.

24
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:45,744
But someday you will find
someone who will have

25
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:48,382
a greater hold
on your affections than I do.

26
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,385
The most important
journey of your life

27
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:54,590
will be to find her.

28
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:57,865
<i>Nicholas had
a younger sister, Kate.</i>

29
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,863
<i>Here she is again.</i>

30
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:02,348
<i>And here.</i>

31
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,185
<i>Goodness, how it goes.</i>

32
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:09,380
<i>For their father,
these children were a divine burden.</i>

33
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,379
<i>Never had money meant less to him,</i>

34
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,458
<i>and never
had he needed it more.</i>

35
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:16,901
<i>His wife said...</i>

36
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:18,228
Speculate.

37
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,898
<i>Since it was well known that
Mr. Nickleby's brother, Ralph,</i>

38
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,536
<i>many years his senior,</i>

39
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:27,142
<i>had made his fortune in London
by just this method,</i>

40
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:31,862
<i>so Nicholas Nickleby,
who had never speculated,</i>

41
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:34,058
<i>speculated.</i>

42
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,378
<i>It is a particular
sort of triumph</i>

43
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:40,539
<i>that bankers have made
the word "speculation"</i>

44
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:42,829
<i>synonymous with "adventure, "</i>

45
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:46,382
<i>when, indeed, it means only
that one may gain a great deal,</i>

46
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,745
<i>or one may lose a great deal.</i>

47
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:51,986
<i>Alas, for Mr. Nickleby,
it meant the latter.</i>

48
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:57,179
<i>Four stockbrokers
took villa residences in Italy,</i>

49
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,948
<i>and 400 nobodies were ruined.</i>

50
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,508
<i>Eliminating all he had saved,</i>

51
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:06,343
<i>as well as any wish
to earn it again,</i>

52
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,302
<i>Mr. Nickleby took to his bed</i>

53
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:12,428
<i>until he surrendered
to the one certainty of life</i>

54
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:16,146
<i>which no amount of speculation
can prevent.</i>

55
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:18,817
What shall we do?

56
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:33,264
<i>Here is Nicholas Nickleby again.</i>

57
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,381
<i>Nineteen years old,</i>

58
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:42,665
<i>and head of his family.</i>

59
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:57,753
Come here!

60
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,417
Said he would
join me at the tavern.

61
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:08,223
Turnips and carrots!

62
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,063
Mind your back, Miss.

63
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:11,908
Turnips and carrots...

64
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,025
Iron gates
and wheels mended.

65
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:44,669
Please, Mr. Nickleby,

66
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:47,066
do you wish my father
to go to debtor's prison?

67
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:48,939
Where your father
sleeps, Miss Bray,

68
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,339
is of no concern to me.

69
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:53,550
Father tells me that the interest
is what makes the debt so unmanageable.

70
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:54,784
Could you not stop it?

71
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,621
Tell your father
to repay the loan,

72
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,948
and that will stop
the interest right away.

73
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:19,148
You must bear up
against sorrow, ma'am.

74
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:21,588
I always do.

75
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:23,468
Mine was no common loss.

76
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,274
Well, it was no uncommon loss.

77
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,737
Husbands die every day.

78
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,827
And wives.

79
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:33,630
And brothers also.

80
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,710
Yes, and puppies, too.

81
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:37,906
Ma'am, you did not mention

82
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:39,828
what my brother's
complaint was.

83
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:43,668
We feel he died
of a broken heart.

84
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,346
Pooh,
there's no such thing.

85
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:48,347
Indeed, if you have
no heart to break.

86
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:50,670
In your letter,
you said,

87
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,587
uh, the creditors
had administered

88
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:53,913
and there was nothing
left for you?

89
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,306
We tried to
sell the house,

90
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:58,907
but no one seemed
to want a little home like ours.

91
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:00,626
So you spent what
little remained,

92
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,220
coming all the way
to London,

93
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:03,707
to see what I could
do for you?

94
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:07,784
It was your brother's
dying wish

95
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:10,072
that you might
do something for his children.

96
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,747
How is it, when a man dies
without any property of his own,

97
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:15,147
he thinks he has the right
to dispose of other people's?

98
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,585
What a feckless, inconsiderate man.

99
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:20,428
Our father,
your brother, had a noble heart.

100
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,514
Which beats no more.

101
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:24,870
You, girl,

102
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:27,985
you haven't
been brought up too delicately

103
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,667
to apprentice at some
boarding school, have you?

104
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,868
Uncle,

105
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:35,671
I will try to do
anything to gain me a home and bread.

106
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:42,541
Now that I think of it, I know a
dressmaker who may have some work.

107
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,905
You, boy, have you
ever done anything?

108
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,863
No.

109
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:51,477
Noggs, where is
the morning paper that I left on my desk?

110
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,301
- On my desk.
- Bring it to me.

111
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:54,865
"Bring it to me."
"Bring it to me."

112
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,232
Stop parroting me.

113
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:58,830
I wish I was a parrot.
I'd fly away.

114
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:01,228
I wish you were a parrot, too.
I'd wring your neck.

115
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:03,786
Read that.

116
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,113
What is it, Nicholas?

117
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,102
An advertisement.

118
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:10,420
"Education at Mr. Wackford
Squeers' Academy."

119
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:13,954
Oh, no, no.

120
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,748
"Dotheboys Hall,

121
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,388
"at the delightful village
of Dotheboys, in Yorkshire.

122
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,782
"Youth are clothed,

123

"Master of Arts preferred."

129
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,512
I'm not a Master of Arts.

130
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:42,758
That can be got over, I believe.

131
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,471
But it is such a long way off.

132
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,909
If I am fortunate enough
to be appointed to the post,

133
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,908
what will become
of those I leave behind?

134
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:50,585
It will be
my immediate care

135
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,432
to place your mother and sister
in some sphere of life

136
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,639
in which they may
become independent.

137
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,437
I will not forget what you have
done for me this day, uncle.

138
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,831
Nor shall I.

139
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,274
Any chimneys to sweep?

140
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,155
There he is.
He's the man with one eye.

141
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,992
Though the popular prejudice
runs in favor of two.

142
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,826
Is this one inch milk
and the rest water?

143
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,108
Aye, sir.

144
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,065
Here's richness.

145
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,550
When I say "number one,"
you may take a drink.

146
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,153
When I say "number two,"
the boy next to you may take it,

147
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,635
and so on,
till all five boys have been nourished.

148
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,105
But work fast.
We leave when the coach horn blows.

149
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:41,426
Number one.

150
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,141
Number two.

151
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,519
Number three.

152
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,991
Number four.

153
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,274
Number five.

154
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,837
Out you go. Out you go.

155
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:57,513
Subdue your appetites,
and you've conquered human nature.

156
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,633
Yorkshire coach
leaves in 5 minutes!

157
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:03,031
Wait by the coach
in a straight line.

158
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:05,109
Ah, Squeers,
this is the boy I told you about.

159
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:06,227
My nephew.

160
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:08,717
I am most grateful
for the opportunity to serve, sir.

161
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,430
- Mr. Squeers.
- Ah, Mrs. Shaygar.

162
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:12,987
Could you give
those to Henry?

163
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,557
Tuesday is
his birthday.

164
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,072
Delighted, my dear.
The boy's happiness is our prime concern.

165
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,470
Three inside,
two little ones up top.

166
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:24,232
Get up behind.
If a boy drops off the back,

167
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,076
that's 20 pounds
a year lost.

168
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:29,950
If he is the schoolmaster,

169
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:31,824
what kind of school
can it be?

170
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,240
I hardly know.

171
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:38,198
Bless you both.

172
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:41,757
Goodbye.

173
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:46,710
Someday,
we will once again

174
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:49,475
share the protection
of the same roof,

175
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:52,237
and revive the happiness
denied to us now.

176
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:54,878
I promise.

177
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:01,306
Psst!
Young man. Young man.

178
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:07,594
Forgive me. I know the world.

179
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:09,592
Your father didn't,

180
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,186
or he wouldn't have
done me a kindness

181
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,470
when there was
no hope of a return.

182
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,796
You don't, or you
wouldn't be bound

183
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,310
on... On such a journey.

184
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:19,993
If ever you should need
help or shelter in London...

185
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,073
Oh, dear.
I once thought I never should.

186
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:25,428
They know where I live,

187
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,987
at the sign
of the Crown in Golden Square.

188
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,957
You can come at night.

189
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,795
Once, nobody was ashamed.

190
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:34,071
Ashamed?

191
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,272
Where are you, Nickleby? Up, up.

192
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,346
If you should go
near Barnard Castle,

193
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,186
there's good ale
at the King's Head.

194
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:41,270
Say you know me,

195
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:43,836
and I'm sure they won't
charge you for it.

196
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,112
And...

197
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:48,873
You may say
"Mr. Noggs" there,

198
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,312
for I was
a gentleman then.

199
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:53,034
I was.

200
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:03,034
Walk on.

201
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,274
Goodbye, Nicholas.

202
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,356
Whoa!

203
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:37,111
Smike!

204
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,431
Smike!

205
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,472
Smike!

206
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:49,360
Is this Dotheboys Hall?

207
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,831
No need to call it
a hall up here.

208
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:54,554
We call it that in London,
because it sounds better.

209
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:56,638
Hurry, lad! Hurry.

210
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,794
Where the devil were you?

211
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,275
Please, sir,

212
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,236
I fell asleep over the fire.

213
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,356
Missus said
I might go in there for a warm.

214
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,274
You'd have been
a deuced deal more wakeful

215
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:27,957
out in the cold.

216
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:33,677
Is that my Squeery?

217
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:42,723
The crime
of my dead eye, my love,

218
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,915
is that I can't see you twice.

219
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:46,592
How's the pig?

220
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,826
Just as you left her.

221
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:48,911
And the boys?

222
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,353
Young Braithwaite's
had a fever.

223
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,632
Third time this year.

224
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,355
I say it's obstinacy,

225
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,592
and we beat it out of him.

226
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:59,477
No one can cure an illness

227
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,002
quicker than you, my love.

228
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,392
This is the new man,
Mr. Nickleby.

229
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:08,670
I hope you're not hungry.

230
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:09,955
I am.

231
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:11,359
Of course you are.

232
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:14,274
I've got a nice hot stew
for you here, Squeery.

233
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,317
And there's bread
on the table.

234
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,241
I brought the letters
to the boys,

235
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:21,792
I'll read them
in the morning.

236
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,037
I'm doing
the brimstone first.

237
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:24,239
Of course you are.
Of course you are.

238
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:25,562
That's right...

239
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,675
Grand piece of meat
in that, Squeery.

240
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:29,233
Put the heat back in you.

241
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,725
Aye, it will.

242
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,160
How was
your journey, my pet?

243
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,232
Dreadful.

244
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:34,312
Was it perishing?

245
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,442
Torture.

246
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,475
What?

247
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,555
Have you...

248
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,475
Did anybody...

249
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,561
Has nothing been heard...

250
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,632
About me?

251
00:15:57,317 --> 00:16:00,596
Not a word,
and never will we.

252
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:02,440
But count your blessings.

253
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:04,081
You've been here
all these years...

254
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:07,800
And not a penny paid
after the first six.

255
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:09,756
No clue as to who
you belong to,

256
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:11,082
and still I feed you.

257
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:13,713
That's cause for joy.

258
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:17,756
And here's more
cause for joy.

259
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:20,717
Little Wackford.

260
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:25,917
Father!

261
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,877
Look what your pa
brought you.

262
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:31,555
Eh?

263
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,846
<i>"Dear Kate,</i>

Who are you after?

268
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,715
It's brimstone morning,
and I can't find the school spoon.

269
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,761
We purify the boys' blood
now and then, Nickleby.

270
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:24,324
Purify, fiddlesticks!

271
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,198
We give the boys
brimstone and treacle, Mr. Knuckleboy,

272
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,802
because if we didn't,
they'd always be ailing.

273
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,283
Because it spoils
their appetites

274
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,594
and comes cheaper than
breakfast and dinner.

275
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:39,997
You might say it does
them good and us good at the same time.

276
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:41,914
Smike!

277
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,243
Where's the school spoon?

278
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,277
Please, ma'am.

279
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:49,000
Huh? Huh?

280
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,241
Please.

281
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,200
Don't contradict
your mistress.

282
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:01,689
Take it.

283
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:03,684
Take it.
Be thankful.

284
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:06,993
A most invaluable
woman that, Nickleby.

285
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,642
I don't know her equal.

286
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:09,803
Nor I.

287
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:10,878
No, please!

288
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:11,956
Take it.

289
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:13,482
And thank me for it.

290
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,125
She does things
for them boys,

291
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:16,841
that I don't believe
half the mothers going

292
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,714
would do for
their own sons.

293
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,925
- I should think they would not, sir.
- No.

But I saw your father
in London.

300
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,201
He was 2.10 pounds
short in his payments.

301

One. Two. Three.

That's all the news
your sister sends, except for 8 pence,

324
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:42,921
That's our system,
Nickleby.

325
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:44,086
What do you think of it?

326
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:45,122
It's useful.

327
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:47,290
<i>"And so went the day.</i>

328
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:51,838
<i>"I very much hope
I can be of service here."</i>

329
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:03,691
Are you cold?

330
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,523
You're shivering, poor fellow.

331
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,002
There.

332
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:23,363
Oh, dear, my heart.

333
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:27,199
I feel lost here, too.

334
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,963
But we must always hope.

335
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,170
Hope?

336
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:39,363
Do you remember
the boy who died here?

337
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:40,489
I was not here.

338
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:42,607
What of him?

339
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,442
I...

340
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:48,006
I was with him
that night.

341
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:53,198
He began to see faces
around his bed that came from home.

342
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:59,835
He said they smiled
and talked to him.

343
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:05,918
At last, he died...

344
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:10,408
Lifting his head
to kiss them.

345
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:16,328
Yes?

346
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:22,447
What faces
will smile on me when I die?

347
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:27,202
Who will comfort me
that long night?

348
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:31,922
They cannot come
from home.

349
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:33,287
They would frighten me
if they did,

350
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:35,051
for I shouldn't
know them.

351
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:39,638
No.

352
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:42,247
There is no hope.

353
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,886
No hope for me at all!

354
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,289
What's the matter, love?

355
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,888
Tilda's getting married
to John Browdie.

356
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:51,891
I'll be the only girl in the
county who hasn't posted my banns.

357
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:55,130
John Browdie's no catch.
I hate him.

358
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:56,844
Eat your breakfast.

359
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,841
I'll never eat again.

360
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,600
How do you like
Mr. Knuckleboy?

361
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,966
I hate him,
that's how I like him.

362
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:07,366
He's a nasty, stuck-up monkey.

363
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,170
He needs his pride
brought down.

364
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,087
I'll leave that
to you, my love.

365
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,690
There's not a woman
in all England

366
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:16,566
can bring a person's
pride down quicker than you can.

367
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,046
Oh.

368
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:19,879
Thank you, Squeery.

369
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,361
Who's Mr. Knuckleboy?

370
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:24,730
The new teacher.

371
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:26,408
A smile like
a sugar-drop

372
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:29,094
and the straightest legs
I've ever seen.

373
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:34,290
<i>The word for "window"</i>

374
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:37,205
is <i>"fenetre, "</i>
F-E-N-E...

375
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:38,926
Oh, father.

376
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,293
Oh, I beg your pardon.

377
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,206
I thought
my father was here.

378
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:45,606
I'm so foolish,
I'm sure.

379
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:47,171
Not at all.

380
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:51,368
Again, the word
for "window" is <i>"fenetre."</i>

381
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:54,888
No, I'm sure
I am foolish.

382
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:59,683
It's just my pen is in need of...

383
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,616
Mending.

384
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:08,488
Oh, well, may I be of service?

385
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:11,606
No, no, I couldn't,
I just couldn't.

386
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,567
Well, all right.

387
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,567
<i>Tilda!</i>

388
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,158
Tilda!

389
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:21,723
What is it, Fanny?

390
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,445
I am engaged!

391
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,368
To whom?

392
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,609
To the new schoolteacher.

393
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:31,800
The speed of it!

394
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:33,401
What's he said?

395
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:35,692
We don't need language.

396
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:38,050
If you could have
only seen his looks.

397
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:41,454
- Did he look at you like this?
- Yes.

398
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:43,204
If he did,
you're engaged.

399
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:44,649
That's how John
looked at me.

400
00:24:44,688 --> 00:24:46,088
Hope it was
better than that.

401
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,328
Thee'd have run
to the hills.

402
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:49,929
Hush, John!
So, when is the day?

403
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:54,572
Well, we just need
a final declaration to settle it,

404
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,727
but he's shy
in the way of words.

405
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,688
Oh, Fanny,
I'm so happy for you.

406
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,096
Have you read
<i>The Pilgrim's Progress?</i>

407
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,492
<i>"The Pilgrim's Progress,</i>
by John Bunyan.

408
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,609
"As I walked
through the wilderness

409
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,692
"of this world,
I lighted on a certain"...

410
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,089
What do you think
you're doing, eh?

411
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:30,691
Eh?

412
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,937
Get on with your work!

413
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,405
Don't give me that
high-and-mighty look.

414
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,450
He don't pay.

415
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,530
Therefore, he works.

416
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:54,970
Ladies.

417
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,571
Quick, quick,
I must do something

418
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:03,135
to engage his sympathy,

419
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:05,733
and bring him
to the declaration. Should I choke?

420
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:08,849
I think fainting
might be more romantic than choking.

421
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:12,208
Oh!

422
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,094
Oh, Mr. Nickleby,
help!

423
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,374
What's happened?

424
00:27:19,452 --> 00:27:21,811
I think she was undone
by your coldness just now.

425
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,653
Was I abrupt?
My mind, I'm afraid, was on other matters.

426
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:26,092
I'm sure
it wasn't deliberate.

427
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:27,976
It's just that
with all the feelings

428
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:31,406
that have been so nearly
expressed between you of late...

429
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:39,620
If I caused any distress,
I reproach myself most bitterly, but...

430
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:42,736
This is most awkward,
but...

431
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:45,335
Well, does your friend
think I'm in love with her?

432
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,973
Does she think so?
Of course.

433
00:27:48,452 --> 00:27:50,456
But I've made
no such declaration.

434
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:52,496
Your eyes said
what your mouth could not.

435
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:56,652
Perhaps my mouth
should say what my eyes have not.

436
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:59,369
I have scarcely seen
the young lady three times,

437
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:02,051
but should I have
seen her 30 or 30,000,

438
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:03,607
it would still
be the same.

439
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:07,019
I have not one thought,
hope or wish connected with her,

440
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,412
unless it be
part of the picture I keep in my mind

441
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:13,216
of one day being able to turn my
back upon this accursed place,

442
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,778
and never
to think of it again

443
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:17,452
with any feeling
but loathing and disgust.

444
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:22,413
Refused by a teacher

445
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,008
picked up
by an advertisement.

446
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:26,090
He's insulted not just you,

447
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:28,011
but the whole
house of Squeers.

448
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,260
Smike!

449
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:32,169
He's proud.
I said so from the start.

450
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,608
He must be wounded.

451
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,812
I hate him like poison!

452
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:38,494
Where is Smike?
We need wood.

453
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:42,255
He's with Mr. Nickleby.
He waits on him hand and foot.

454
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,216
Well,

455
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,409
he must not have
enough to do.

456
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:56,453
<i>We must think of how
better to occupy our Smike.</i>

457
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:12,085
<i>They are so hard on me.</i>

458
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,126
But for you,

459
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,293
they would kill me.

460
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:24,724
I fear they
may be killing you because of me.

461
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:30,086
You will do better
when I am gone.

462
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:31,411
Gone?

463
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:34,572
Are you going?

464
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:37,776
I would go tomorrow
if I could.

465
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:41,327
Tell me,

466
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:44,536
is the world
as bad as this place?

467
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:46,652
Oh, no.

468
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,337
Should I ever
meet you there?

469
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:51,572
Why, yes,
I'm sure at some...

470
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:52,661
No.

471
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:54,335
No, tell me.

472
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,371
Tell me that
I should be sure to find you.

473
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:03,050
You would.

474
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:06,934
And I would help you
and aid you,

475
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:11,375
and not bring fresh sorrow on you,
as I have done here.

476
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:16,006
Smike!

477
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:18,659
Smike!

478
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:21,500
Smike!

479
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:23,541
He is not here, sir!

480
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:27,417
Smike!

481
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,293
Show yourself!

482
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,131
Who knows where he is?

483
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:44,050
Please, sir,
I think he's run away.

484
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:45,851
And what
possible reason

485
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:49,732
would any boy
have to run away from my establishment?

486
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:52,770
Do you think
he's run away?

487
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,292
I hope so!

488
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:55,459
Squeery,

489
00:30:57,896 --> 00:30:59,862
we best go find him.

490
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,568
But if you lift
one finger

491
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,608
to stop what's
about to begin,

492
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:19,136
you and I will
fall out in a way

493
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:23,215
that will spoil
your beauty.

494
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:33,257
Take pattern by Smike
if you dare, boys!

495
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:37,778
You'll see what he'll get for hisself
when he's brought back.

496
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,811
For brought back
he will be.

497
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:47,496
You go the north way, Squeery,
I'll take the west.

498
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:54,814
Mr. Squeers!

499
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,536
Mr. Squeers, please!

500
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:58,538
I beg you,
forgive the boy!

501
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:00,140
He is not in
his right mind.

502
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:02,660
That will soon be
the least of his problems.

503
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:11,100
Father, please
don't let them find him.

504
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:13,579
If they do,
let him be dead,

505
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:15,536
his last breath
a free one.

506
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:10,978
Does he have him?
Is it Smike?

507
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:42,863
Is she back with him?

508
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,905
Then you do not have him.

509
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,138
Thank God.

510
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,338
Squeery!

511
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,016
Squeery, we have him!

512
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,142
Is every boy here?

513
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,901
Get back!

514
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,776
And you, Nickleby.

515
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,578
Have you anything to say?

516
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,742
Please, sir, spare me.

517
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,855
Oh, I'll spare you, Smike.

518
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,348
I'll spare you.

519
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,102
I'll flog you
to within an inch of your life,

520
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,936
and I'll spare you then.

521
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,263
Stop!

522
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:09,947
This must not go on.

523
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:12,654
I will not allow it.

524
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:17,145
You dare
to challenge my authority!

525
00:35:17,461 --> 00:35:18,659
Stay back!

526
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:22,102
Touch him at your peril!

527
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,853
I will not stand by
and see it done.

528
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:27,537
You will do
as you're told!

529
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:28,982
If you raise
the devil within me,

530
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:31,862
the consequences shall
fall on your own head!

531
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:34,025
Once I begin, God help you!

532
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,422
Ah! Ah!

533
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:41,141
Stop! Stop! Stop!

534
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:46,663
No, please, wait!

535
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:48,017
Wait, wait.

536
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:54,944
I do not know why,
but I am going to show you

537
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:57,668
what you have
never shown any boy in this room.

538
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:02,423
Pity.

539
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,586
Wait. I say, wait!

540
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:49,823
I've come from
the schoolhouse.

541
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:53,947
Mr. Squeers says he was attacked.
Beaten, and nearly senseless.

542
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:55,661
When he said
it was thee who did it,

543
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,342
I knew thee must not
be allowed to leave...

544
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:58,978
We will not be stopped!

545
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:00,376
Without my
shaking your hand,

546
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,620
and saying to thee,
"Job well done."

547
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:04,784
Give us thee hand,
will you, huh?

548
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:07,262
Whoever heard
the like of it?

549
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,141
I only wish

550
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:11,860
I could've been
there to see it myself.

551
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:19,057
What do thee
mean to do now?

552
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:21,182
I don't know.

553
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:22,261
How much cash
has thee got?

554
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:24,662
Not much.
But I'll find...

555
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:25,712
Take what you need.

556
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:26,743
No. I could not.

557
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:27,828
Please.

558
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:31,062
Every boy in that room

559
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:32,419
would add to it if he could.

560
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,984
Thank you.

561
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:38,741
Here, and take this
bit of timber, too, to help thee on.

562
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:41,747
You keep a good heart.

563
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,503
God bless thee. Huh, huh!

564
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,505
Beating the schoolmaster!

565
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:53,018
God, it's the best thing
I've heard in 20 years.

566
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:07,388
Tomorrow...

567
00:38:08,344 --> 00:38:09,945
Where will you go?

568
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:12,500
Perhaps to Liverpool.

569
00:38:13,144 --> 00:38:15,186
I could find
work on a ship.

570
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,026
Do not be anxious.

571
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:23,259
Before I do anything,
I will get you to your home.

572
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:25,546
Where is it?

573
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:32,069
You are my home.

574
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:34,589
Smike!

575
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:38,461
Please, may I go
with you to the sea?

576
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:40,463
I will be your faithful,
hard-working servant.

577
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:43,104
I will. I promise I will.

578
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:46,179
I want only to be near you.

579
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:51,376
Smike...

580
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:53,548
The word which
separates us

581
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,543
shall never be
said by me.

582
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:58,262
And I promise you,

583
00:38:58,346 --> 00:38:59,947
from this night forward...

584
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:03,385
The world shall deal
by you as it does by me.

585
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:14,739
Do you have a family...

586
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:17,784
Or are you alone,
as I am?

587
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:20,347
I have a mother
and a sister.

588
00:39:22,546 --> 00:39:23,744
Dear God!

589
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:26,906
If he has sent me here,
what has he done to Kate?

590
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:29,059
I'm grateful
that you came.

591
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:31,064
It is a boon
to a single man

592
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:34,110
to have such
a lady as yourself for my hostess.

593
00:39:34,147 --> 00:39:36,832
I know little
of how these things are done in London.

594
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:40,110
Surely one of
the other ladies would be more adept.

595
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:42,866
You are the only
lady present.

596
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:47,067
By the time I was finished
with her, she couldn't escape.

597
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:56,823
Have you thought
about the investment I brought you?

598
00:39:57,467 --> 00:40:00,583
Uh, well,
it has its merits and its risks.

599
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,746
You know, Nickleby,
I've noticed

600
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:04,350
you never seem
to touch your wine,

601
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:05,748
while we drink
and drink.

602
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:07,551
Well, I like to
keep a clear head.

603
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:09,548
Yet you pour us
so much.

604
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,707
Nickleby, I must say,
it is a pleasure having your niece with us.

605
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,350
He must have
designed that, too,

606
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:16,230
to soften you
into speculating.

607
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:18,752
If I could see
someone as winning as Miss Nickleby

608
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:20,503
when I come
to her uncle's to talk business,

609
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:23,310
I can think of no other place
I would rather talk business.

610
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:26,145
No other place on earth.

611
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:28,703
Hear, hear, hear!

612
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:33,665
Gentlemen, I feel
we are boring Miss Nickleby.

613
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:36,500
Look, she can barely
raise her eyes.

614
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:39,301
The poor,
dear girl simply cannot understand

615
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:41,181
why no one here
is making love to her.

616
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:45,308
She gasps!
I have uncovered her secret.

617
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:48,544
No!
You misunderstand me. I...

618
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:50,948
In fact, I'll hold
any man 50 pounds

619
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:53,348
that Miss Nickleby
can't look in my face

620
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:55,547
and tell me that
she wasn't thinking so.

621
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,506
Done, done, done!

622
00:40:57,628 --> 00:40:58,663
Done!

623
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:02,111
Pray, do not make me
the subject of bets.

624
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,991
Uncle, please!

625
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:07,229
Why not,
if the gentlemen insist?

626
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:08,631
It's a minute's work.

627
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:10,710
Just lift your eyes
and tell me

628
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:13,462
that you're not
hoping I would make love to you.

629
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:18,785
Get your money ready,
gentlemen.

630
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:23,749
She's not going to say it,
because she wants me to make love to her.

631
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:25,863
Can you, girl?

632
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:30,867
Can you say that
you don't wish me to make love to you?

633
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:37,626
I...

634
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,225
Hush, my dear.

635
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:03,708
Don't mind it, now.

636
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,946
Then let me go.

637
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:08,502
Let me leave
this place.

638
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:11,906
You must dry
your eyes first.

639
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,195
Hmm?
Let me raise your head.

640
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:26,591
There.

641
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,908
Uncle...

642
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,555
What have I done,

643
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,989
that you should
subject me to this?

644
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,072
I didn't know
it would be so.

645
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,709
Can you remember when you
first came to Mr. Squeers?

646
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,390
Surely you did not find
your way there alone?

647
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,906
I could not have.

648
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,984
I was brought by
a small, withered man.

649
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:13,747
I was afraid of him.

650
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,112
But then they made me
more afraid of them.

651
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:32,192
Tremendous.
Positively tremendous.

652
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:35,511
That'll be a double encore
if you take care, boys!

653
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,715
Don't you concur? Was that not the
very picture of excitement?

654
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:40,635
It was very good.

655
00:43:41,672 --> 00:43:42,631
Although...

656
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:44,069
Although?

657
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:48,148
They might be
better matched in terms of size.

658
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:51,194
How are you to get
up the sympathies of the audience,

659
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:54,511
if there isn't a little man
contending against a bigger one?

660
00:43:55,072 --> 00:43:57,632
I confess,
I had not considered that.

661
00:43:57,712 --> 00:43:59,706
We have had
a long day's walk without much...

662
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:01,671
Without much?

663
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,514
Well, food.

664
00:44:03,952 --> 00:44:05,198
Dear me.

665
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:09,309
Let it never be said
that any man went hungry here or here

666
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:11,147
when he was with
Vincent Crummles.

667
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,274
Boys,
set the table at once!

668
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:16,432
We shall adjourn
to the dining room.

669
00:44:16,832 --> 00:44:19,239
My friend and I shall try
for a berth on a ship.

670
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:20,433
Ah!

671
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:23,200
Does no other profession
suggest itself

672
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:25,745
to a young man
of your figure and bearing?

673
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,384
I think the sea
offers a great many...

674
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:28,707
What about the stage?

675
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:29,837
The stage?

676
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:31,273
The theatrical profession!

677
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:33,597
I am in the theatrical
profession myself.

678
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,311
My wife is in
the theatrical profession.

679
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:38,110
My children are in
the theatrical profession.

680
00:44:38,193 --> 00:44:40,792
I had a dog that
lived and died in it,

681
00:44:40,832 --> 00:44:44,831
and the pony that
pulled us here today is 3rd generation.

682
00:44:45,193 --> 00:44:47,552
His mother could
fire a pistol

683
00:44:47,593 --> 00:44:49,511
and get in bed
wearing a nightcap.

684
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:50,955
But...

685
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:53,431
There is tragedy
in the family.

686
00:44:54,673 --> 00:44:56,514
In the pony's family?

687
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:57,993
Yes.

688
00:44:58,313 --> 00:45:00,231
The father drank.

689
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,914
Ended up in the circus...

690
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:05,752
Drinking port wine
with the clowns.

691
00:45:07,473 --> 00:45:09,429
Got greedy,
couldn't quit...

692
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:12,601
And choked on the bottle.

693
00:45:15,953 --> 00:45:18,187
At any rate,
I'd love to bring you and your friend out.

694
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:20,066
He has a capital countenance!

695
00:45:20,193 --> 00:45:21,832
Why, as he is now,

696
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:25,155
he would make
such an apothecary in <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

697
00:45:25,194 --> 00:45:27,793
that he would be certain
of three rounds of applause

698
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:30,587
the minute he put his face
out of the practicable door!

699
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:31,668
And you!

700
00:45:32,153 --> 00:45:33,150
Me?

701
00:45:33,194 --> 00:45:35,630
You were born
for the lamps!

702
00:45:35,714 --> 00:45:36,721
No, sir, I think...

703
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:38,394
You could be useful
in a hundred ways.

704
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:40,188
You could write plays!

705
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:41,754
Well...

706
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,185
I dare say, I could
scribble something, now and then.

707
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:48,196
Whatever you write, please include
a pump and two washing tubs.

708
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:50,113
I just bought them
at a sale.

709
00:45:50,474 --> 00:45:52,315
Could I live
by such a trade?

710
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:56,714
Ooh, like a prince!
With your own salary, and your friend's,

711
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:00,401
and your writing,
you could make a pound a week!

712
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:03,346
With a good run
of houses, double that.

713
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,920
Then I accept,
and happily!

714
00:46:08,275 --> 00:46:10,001
Arise, young man.

715
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:12,676
You've been transformed!

716
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:15,067
You went to sleep a wretch,

717
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:17,033
you awake an actor!

718
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,915
Mrs. C, Mrs. C,
could I have a word?

719
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:28,192
What is it now?

720
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:29,713
About my roar.

721
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,873
There are two options
available to you. A rugged...

722
00:46:33,955 --> 00:46:35,479
My dear.

723
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,114
I've made
another discovery.

724
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:42,228
<i>Messieurs</i> Nickleby
and Smike,

725
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:44,509
may I present Mrs. Crummles.

726
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,875
Welcome to our
family of players!

727
00:46:48,595 --> 00:46:51,951
We were just
about to rehearse the climax of our drama.

728
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:53,954
Will you
watch with us...

729
00:46:54,555 --> 00:46:56,271
And feel with us?

730
00:46:58,555 --> 00:47:01,393
Ladies and gentlemen,
places, please.

731
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:06,513
I must warn you,
Folair has been hopeless today!

732
00:47:13,636 --> 00:47:16,724
Play the terror,
but don't lose the joy!

733
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:20,635
Your trap!

734
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,754
Mr. Folair, shut your trap!

735
00:47:27,396 --> 00:47:28,403
Ah!

736
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:30,434
Somebody forgot
his spear.

737
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:35,993
The flames!
The flames! And remember, they're hot!

738
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:37,196
Ow!

739
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:39,558
Oh, dear,
it's almost too real!

740
00:47:40,717 --> 00:47:42,874
Remember, Mr. Folair,
you are a savage,

741
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:44,835
not a demented fairy!

742
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,515
Don't lose
your theatricality!

743
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:51,717
Ninetta, dear, would you move that
flower to your other hand?

744
00:47:51,756 --> 00:47:54,556
Mr. Folair,
there's a problem with your head!

745
00:47:54,597 --> 00:47:55,604
Perfect!

746
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:02,472
Bravo!
Thrilling in the extreme!

747
00:48:03,357 --> 00:48:06,636
Gentlemen,
this is Miss Ninetta Crummles,

748
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,520
the infant phenomenon.

749
00:48:09,037 --> 00:48:10,600
And how old is she?

750
00:48:14,277 --> 00:48:16,684
She is 10 years
of age, sir.

751
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,877
Not more?

752
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:22,152
Not a day.

753
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:23,679
- My dear?
- Yes?

754
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:27,035
It is of the utmost
that I speak to you about a great struggle

755
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:31,441
which is taking place outside this mortal
temple we call the theater.

756
00:48:32,038 --> 00:48:34,598
The contestants are
those aged combatants,

757
00:48:34,918 --> 00:48:36,318
art...

758
00:48:36,357 --> 00:48:38,351
And commerce.

759
00:48:38,438 --> 00:48:41,238
And art, it would
appear from the receipts,

760
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,195
is in its usual
position of jeopardy.

761
00:48:45,598 --> 00:48:47,957
Might you and I
have a word, <i>a deux?</i>

762
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:49,476
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

763
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:54,308
Psst!

764
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:56,678
"Infant phenomenon"!

765
00:48:57,078 --> 00:48:58,756
"Infant humbug"
is more to the point!

766
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:02,356
She has been 10
for the past eight years!

767
00:49:03,238 --> 00:49:06,038
They keep her on a diet of gin and
water to hold back her growth.

768
00:49:06,478 --> 00:49:07,686
You don't say!

769
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:09,357
I do say, sir. I do!

770
00:49:09,438 --> 00:49:12,957
That hammy sprawler keeps the rest of
us from doing our specialties.

771
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,200
Mine is the Highland Fling.

772
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,923
Would you like to see it?

773
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:20,801
Please.

774
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:28,085
Ladies and gentlemen!

775
00:49:28,158 --> 00:49:31,562
Based on the receipts
Mrs. Crummles has shown me,

776
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,873
Liverpool has little relish

777
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:37,200
for high-minded
theatrical entertainments

778
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,034
properly conducted.

779
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:41,476
We must give them
our pity.

780
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:47,233
Now, we must give them
something they will pay to see.

781
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:49,638
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

782
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:51,243
But we have no Romeo.

783
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:54,157
Mr. Leadville's leg is broke.

784
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:56,403
Oh! I don't mind!

785
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,595
I can manage!

786
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:01,802
Old friend,

787
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,994
it may be time
for you to move on from Romeo.

788
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,919
Move on?

789
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:07,994
To what?

790
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:10,764
Lear?

791
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:14,283
Mr. Nickleby
will take that part.

792
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,124
And do you not think
his friend

793
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,443
would make
a smashing apothecary?

794
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:26,755
His face practically
erupts with drama!

795
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,167
What an acquisition!

796
00:50:29,879 --> 00:50:32,478
These speeches! Listen to this.

797
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,437
"Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

798
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,792
"that I might
touch that cheek."

799
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,671
Are you worried
about how to memorize so much?

800
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:42,764
I am, and I have
barely a word to say!

801
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,355
It is not only that,

802
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,996
but a desire to know
someone to whom I could say such things.

803
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,043
My father told me
that the great journey

804
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,640
of my life would be
to find such a person,

805
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,000
but I'm nearly
20 years of age,

806
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:58,007
and I fear
he may be wrong.

807
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,961
I hope not.

808
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:02,394
I hope not, too.

809
00:51:05,761 --> 00:51:07,314
May I ask you why
you were so upset

810
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,923
seeing that savage
come through the trapdoor?

811
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:13,247
You asked me yesterday
if I had a memory

812
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,200
about my life
before Yorkshire.

813
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,959
There is but one thing
I remember.

814
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:21,204
It was the room
in which I was kept.

815
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:25,485
<i>It was a lonesome room
at the top of a house.</i>

816
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:29,848
<i>There was a large black hook
that hung down from the ceiling.</i>

817
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:32,838
<i>Underneath it was a trapdoor.</i>

818
00:51:35,402 --> 00:51:37,924
I was so afraid
of what might be on the other side,

819
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,246
that there was
not a single night

820
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:41,239
I did not cover my head
in the bedclothes.

821
00:51:42,761 --> 00:51:43,921
So today,

822
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:47,204
when a door so very like it
opened in the dark before me...

823
00:51:48,682 --> 00:51:50,801
I could not watch
what came out of it.

824
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:53,279
Carry on.

825
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:02,167
We have fallen
on strange times.

826
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:03,799
Yes...

827
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:06,077
But wondrous strange.

828
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,125
What's come then?

829
00:52:21,162 --> 00:52:22,360
I have.

830
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:25,842
What else?

831
00:52:25,922 --> 00:52:27,648
A letter marked,

832
00:52:28,203 --> 00:52:32,077
"Urgent, as well as
extremely important."

833
00:52:33,322 --> 00:52:35,201
It's from the Squeers.

834
00:52:35,242 --> 00:52:36,642
Wackford?

835
00:52:36,683 --> 00:52:39,080
Doubtful.
It's perfumed.

836
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:43,564
"Dear Mr. Knuckleboy, sir.

837
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:46,562
"My pa requests me
to write to you.

838
00:52:46,602 --> 00:52:48,884
"The doctor's
considering it doubtful

839
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:51,762
"whether he will ever recover
the use of his legs,

840
00:52:51,843 --> 00:52:54,125
"which prevents
his holding a pen.

841
00:52:54,763 --> 00:52:57,045
"He was brought
to this state by your nephew,

842
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:59,645
"who jumped upon
my pa's body with his feet,

843
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,362
"and dashed him
to the earth."

844
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:04,003
"Dashed him to the earth."
Very nice, my dear!

845
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:06,645
"He also attacked
him with language,

846
00:53:06,723 --> 00:53:09,964
"which I will
not pollute my pen with describing.

847
00:53:10,643 --> 00:53:12,167
"He assaulted my ma

848
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:15,885
"by driving her
back-comb several inches into her head.

849
00:53:16,523 --> 00:53:18,604
"We have a medical
certificate that says

850
00:53:18,684 --> 00:53:20,995
"if the comb had
entered her skull,

851
00:53:21,043 --> 00:53:24,035
"the tortoiseshell

852
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:27,161
<i>"The monster then ran away,</i>

853
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:29,880
"taking with him a boy
of desperate character,

854
00:53:29,963 --> 00:53:33,875
"as well as a garnet ring

855
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:37,281

money compensating for its loss

856
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:39,405
"in the amount of 22..."

857
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:40,922
- Four.
- Eight.

858
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:43,440
"28.10 pounds.

859
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:46,962
<i>"Remain yours, etc.,
Fanny Squeers."</i>

860
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:49,645
The boy has crossed me.

861
00:53:50,364 --> 00:53:52,042
I did not expect otherwise.

862
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:53,800
He's written as well.

863
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:56,045
Pride, obstinacy.

864
00:53:57,364 --> 00:54:00,404
A reputation
for fine feelings are all against it.

865
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:03,645
He's gone to Liverpool.

866
00:54:04,084 --> 00:54:05,887
Taken some employment.

867
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:08,958
Otherwise it's all excuses.

868
00:54:10,124 --> 00:54:12,646
I predict he soon
will be on some ship.

869
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:14,930
Gone.

870
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:17,970
Forever.

871
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:25,842
Ah!

872
00:54:26,285 --> 00:54:27,483
Child...

873
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:29,797
Forgive me.
I have been remiss

874
00:54:29,845 --> 00:54:31,849
in my attentions
to you and your mother.

875
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:32,882
Oh...

876
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:34,518
I came to enquire
whether you and she

877
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,721
would accompany me
to the theater on Friday evening?

878
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:40,319
That is most
kind of you, uncle.

879
00:54:40,365 --> 00:54:41,889
Mmm. Very well.

880
00:54:42,325 --> 00:54:44,041
I shall call for you.

881
00:54:51,485 --> 00:54:53,038
She has accepted.

882
00:55:05,565 --> 00:55:07,924
I have
a genuine interest in Shakespeare,

883
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:12,052
especially after having been to that
dear little dull house he was born in.

884
00:55:12,405 --> 00:55:14,208
How fascinating. May I?

885
00:55:14,526 --> 00:55:16,252
Nickleby? Is that you?

886
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,963
Nickleby, are you all alone?

887
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:21,322
Oh! What luck!

888
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:29,319
The drama begins.

889
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:35,686
Her eyes in heaven

890
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:39,485
would through
the airy region stream so bright,

891
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:41,130
that birds would sing,

892
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,085
and think it
were not night.

893
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:46,968
See how she
leans her cheek upon her hand.

894
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:50,162
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

895
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,365
that I might
touch that cheek!

896
00:55:53,207 --> 00:55:54,693
Ay, me!

897
00:55:54,766 --> 00:55:57,163
I should like
to be your glove,

898
00:55:57,246 --> 00:55:59,365
as much to
touch your cheek

899
00:55:59,407 --> 00:56:01,488
as to grip
your fingers.

900
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:05,367
Bravo!

901
00:56:07,207 --> 00:56:08,645
Oh, don't hurry.

902
00:56:09,007 --> 00:56:10,090
Oh, please do not detain me.

903
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:12,878
Now, why do you
keep up this show of displeasure?

904
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:14,280
Show?

905
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,686
Nothing could be
more sincerely felt.

906
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:19,441
Indeed, you're prettier
when you are in a passion.

907
00:56:19,527 --> 00:56:20,802
I wish my brother were here.

908
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:23,369
He would be in a passion
from which you would not soon recover.

909
00:56:23,407 --> 00:56:24,970
Linger with me
just a moment

910
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,253
as they extinguish
the lights.

911
00:56:26,288 --> 00:56:27,362
I will not.

912
00:56:27,407 --> 00:56:29,373
Will you deny me
everything I want?

913
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:31,126
If everything
you want is wrong.

914
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:32,521
Please, let me
rejoin my family.

915
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:33,717
My mother
will be anxious.

916
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,927
Your mother, child,
is already anxious

917
00:56:36,008 --> 00:56:37,887
that you should
find a proper prospect.

918
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:40,844
I would hazard
that she is delighted we are by ourselves,

919
00:56:40,928 --> 00:56:42,452
and I imagine
the longer we are gone,

920
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:44,366
the less anxious
she will be.

921
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:45,692
Do not mock me.

922
00:56:46,128 --> 00:56:47,576
You do not
consider me a prospect,

923
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:50,407
but a plaything,
and I consider you neither.

924
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,534
To treat me this way
in a public place

925
00:56:52,568 --> 00:56:54,610
could ruin
my reputation.

926
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:57,649
And every chance for a decent and
loving marriage will be gone.

927
00:56:57,688 --> 00:56:59,491
If it's privacy you want,
let me give it to you.

928
00:56:59,568 --> 00:57:02,167
But I'll have
what I want and wait no more.

929
00:57:09,528 --> 00:57:11,570
I have a genuine
interest in Shakespeare.

930
00:57:12,088 --> 00:57:13,852
Mother, may we go?

931
00:57:13,928 --> 00:57:15,213
It was delightful
to see you.

932
00:57:15,249 --> 00:57:16,524
Mother, please.

933
00:57:16,568 --> 00:57:17,929
Is something wrong?

934
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,048
Uncle...

935
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:28,683
I have been wounded
past all healing...

936
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:31,609
And by your friends.

937
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:33,645
What can you mean?
I have no friends.

938
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:35,571
If they are
not your friends,

939
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:37,845
then more shame on you
for bringing me among them.

940
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:41,013
Oh, I see you have some
of the boy's blood in you.

941
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:44,728
I hope I have.

942
00:57:45,649 --> 00:57:47,241
I should be proud.

943
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:52,214
You know what happened
under this roof.

944
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:55,367
Last night was far worse.

945
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:58,770
You have influence
with these men.

946
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:01,812
One word from you
would induce them to desist.

947
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:06,011
Oh, what of it if an old man
whispers inanities in your ear on Monday?

948
00:58:06,089 --> 00:58:08,208
Some other novelty
will spring up on Tuesday.

949
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:11,252
In the meantime,
you must be practical.

950
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,810
The money that allows me
to help you and your mother

951
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:16,852
in some portion
comes from these men.

952
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,014
Uncle...

953
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:25,696
I am grateful
for all that you have done for us...

954
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,413
But do not mistake me.

955
00:58:30,729 --> 00:58:32,407
I am not a toy.

956
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,567
I will live with dignity.

957
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,210
If that means that I must set up my
mother and myself on our own,

958
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,811
and hide myself
from your friends,

959
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,170
I will do so...

960
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,129
Knowing God will help us,

961
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,126
even if you will not.

962
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,610
If the boy drowns,
or is lost at sea...

963
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,808
This house could be hers.

964
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,284
How pretty
she would make it.

965
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,814
Dear girl, here, here. Take this.

966
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,765
But I am not crying.

967
00:59:17,811 --> 00:59:21,090
Oh, the handkerchief's
for me. The arm's for you.

968
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:25,734
To hear you speak so bravely
and not give way before him...

969
00:59:25,811 --> 00:59:27,777
My admiration
moves me to this.

970
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:29,970
Your brother,
he'd be so proud.

971
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:35,569
Oh, that's right, yes.
Yes, give way now.

972
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:38,532
Noggs!

973
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,650
You're not...
You're not alone.

974
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:46,646
I'll see you soon.
And so shall someone else.

975
00:59:47,732 --> 00:59:49,170
God bless you.

976
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:07,891
Again.
"What ho, apothecary?"

977
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:10,766
It's no use.
I can't remember it.

978
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,410
Smike, you can only
fail by not trying.

979
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:15,885
"Who calls so loud?"

980
01:00:15,972 --> 01:00:19,808
It is a crime that Mr. C has not
found a spot for my Highland Fling.

981
01:00:19,892 --> 01:00:22,491
Yes<i>. Romeo and Juliet</i>
will not be the same without it.

982
01:00:22,572 --> 01:00:24,327
"Who calls so loud?"
"Who calls so loud?"

983
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:26,884
May I tempt you
with a humble offering?

984
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:27,977
Please.

985
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:32,252
The lamps are lit!
Your public awaits!

986
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,728
Let us use our bodies
like instruments,

987
01:00:35,772 --> 01:00:39,972
and quiver together
until music comes out!

988
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:46,567
You will be wonderful.
Just relax.

989
01:00:48,132 --> 01:00:49,532
Relax.

990
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:51,650
Relax.

991
01:00:54,732 --> 01:00:56,295
"Who calls so loud?"

992
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,567
If a man did
need a poison,

993
01:01:00,973 --> 01:01:03,735
here lives a caitiff wretch
who would sell it to him.

994
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,054
What ho, apothecary!

995
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,448
What ho?

996
01:01:55,534 --> 01:01:56,531
Who calls so loud?

997
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:00,536
Well done.

998
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:07,932
Mr. Nickleby?

999
01:02:08,814 --> 01:02:09,974
This just came.

1000
01:02:10,054 --> 01:02:11,415
Thank you.

1001
01:02:13,614 --> 01:02:15,896
If it is an offer from
a competing company,

1002
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:18,772
I hope you honor it with
the respect it deserves...

1003
01:02:19,214 --> 01:02:20,249
None.

1004
01:02:20,935 --> 01:02:23,140
Newman says Kate
is in some sort of peril.

1005
01:02:23,815 --> 01:02:25,493
He says we must
come to London at once.

1006
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:29,609
You leave us?
At the very moment of your triumph?

1007
01:02:29,935 --> 01:02:32,207
I must, sir.
It is a family drama.

1008
01:02:32,535 --> 01:02:34,290
Those are
always popular.

1009
01:02:35,735 --> 01:02:37,010
Well,

1010
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:39,690
we shall miss
you, Nicholas.

1011
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,254
Very well, we'll have
posters out in the morning

1012
01:02:43,335 --> 01:02:46,336
announcing positively
your last performance for tomorrow.

1013
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:49,773
Then re-engagement
by popular demand for Friday.

1014
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:54,259
And then, one absolutely
last-time-ever appearance

1015
01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:56,337
on any stage, Saturday...

1016
01:02:58,256 --> 01:03:01,094
With the possibility
of a second show to follow.

1017
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:03,016
Mr. Crummles, no man has been

1018
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:04,898
more helpful to me
in my time of trouble than you,

1019
01:03:05,496 --> 01:03:08,728
but I must say that tonight
was my absolutely, positively,

1020
01:03:08,816 --> 01:03:10,609
final last performance.

1021
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:12,738
There is a most
urgent family crisis,

1022
01:03:12,815 --> 01:03:14,694
and I must be no less
quick in responding to it

1023
01:03:14,775 --> 01:03:18,457
than you would be if the infant
phenomenon herself were in danger.

1024
01:03:25,336 --> 01:03:27,656
There is only one
response to that.

1025
01:03:29,736 --> 01:03:32,852
Farewell, my noble,
lion-hearted boy.

1026
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:34,456
We shall never
forget you.

1027
01:03:34,496 --> 01:03:36,020
Nor we, you.

1028
01:03:36,616 --> 01:03:38,927
And have you anything
to say, my boy?

1029
01:03:40,336 --> 01:03:41,659
Who calls so loud?

1030
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:49,375
Goodbye. Thank you.

1031
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:50,702
Farewell, dear friends.

1032
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:52,656
Ladies and gentlemen,

1033
01:03:52,697 --> 01:03:55,775
if you found these
goodbyes affecting...

1034
01:03:56,056 --> 01:04:00,448
You will love our production
of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

1035
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:04,612
miraculously recast
with that great Italian actor

1036
01:04:04,696 --> 01:04:06,901
whose name shall be revealed

1037
01:04:06,937 --> 01:04:10,533
only to ticket buyers
at tonight's performance,

1038
01:04:10,617 --> 01:04:13,532
but who promises,
in honor of the local tastes,

1039
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:16,849
to deftly insert
into tonight's story...

1040
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:19,779
The Highland Fling.

1041
01:04:30,937 --> 01:04:32,413
Mr. Noggs is in here?

1042
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:34,741
He said for us
to wait for him here.

1043
01:04:35,457 --> 01:04:37,413
Shall I get you
something to eat?

1044
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:39,568
It may be some time
before Newman arrives.

1045
01:04:39,657 --> 01:04:40,817
Yes, please.

1046
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:42,899
Not as much as
little Kate Nickleby!

1047
01:04:42,937 --> 01:04:45,018
Little Kate Nickleby!

1048
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:48,861
Tell us again what
she said in Nickleby's box.

1049
01:04:49,137 --> 01:04:50,940
She said she wished
her brother were there,

1050
01:04:50,978 --> 01:04:54,257
as he would be in a passion
that I would not soon forget!

1051
01:04:55,898 --> 01:04:57,259
Didn't she also
say something about,

1052
01:04:57,658 --> 01:04:59,652
"If you press
yourself further,

1053
01:04:59,738 --> 01:05:02,490
"I shall lose every hope
of a loving and decent marriage?"

1054
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:04,502
I thought that
was a bit much.

1055
01:05:04,538 --> 01:05:05,976
A word with you, sir.

1056
01:05:10,298 --> 01:05:11,813
Will you step
apart with me?

1057
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:14,455
I see no reason to step
in any direction

1058
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:16,695
until you state your name
and business, sir.

1059
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:21,298
My name is Nicholas Nickleby.
Miss Nickleby's brother.

1060
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:24,456
I denounce you as a liar
and impeach you as a coward.

1061
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,614
You will tell me your name.

1062
01:05:26,698 --> 01:05:27,935
Certainly not.

1063
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:31,059
If there is a gentleman
in this party,

1064
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,224
he will acquaint me with the
name and residence of this man.

1065
01:05:36,219 --> 01:05:37,945
Someone answer me!

1066
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:41,018
My sister's good
name is at stake!

1067
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:43,618
This dog is bothering me.

1068
01:05:43,698 --> 01:05:45,664
I am the son of
a country gentleman,

1069
01:05:46,138 --> 01:05:47,854
your equal in
education and birth,

1070
01:05:47,899 --> 01:05:51,063
and your superior, I trust,
in everything besides.

1071
01:05:51,098 --> 01:05:53,332
It is as much in his name
as it is in my own

1072
01:05:53,418 --> 01:05:55,412
that I demand you
answer for your conduct.

1073
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,021
Here is my answer, sir.

1074
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:01,534
Now, gentlemen.

1075
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,619
No!

1076
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:11,628
Come near my sister again...

1077
01:06:12,379 --> 01:06:14,412
And I shall not
be so forgiving.

1078
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,942
The Exchange is now open for business!

1079
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,494
My patience is at an end, Miss Bray.

1080
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,498
You are known to me now,

1081
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,177
every suspicion
viciously confirmed.

1082
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:52,973
And you to me.

1083
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,019
I? What wrong have I done?

1084
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,855
Did you not attack
the schoolmaster?

1085
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,299
The monster was beating
a crippled boy!

1086
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,664
Oh, you choose to
restore that boy?

1087
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,337
No more than I would
restore a lamb to a wolf.

1088
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,059
Then your appearance here
to beg my help is in vain.

1089
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,336
You mistake the point
of this conference.

1090
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:17,903
We knew no shame
until we knew you...

1091
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,507
And the degradations
we have endured,

1092
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:24,654
whether at Dotheboys Hall
or in the dark box of a theater,

1093
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,822
all trace their
poisoned roots to you.

1094
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:31,059
You did not want us
when we came,

1095
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:35,263
and it shamed me to seek help
from someone unwilling to give it.

1096
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:39,702
Now our only shame
is the blood which binds our name to yours.

1097
01:07:39,741 --> 01:07:43,740
Therefore, your brother's widow
and her children renounce you!

1098
01:07:45,901 --> 01:07:47,425
May every
recollection of your life

1099
01:07:47,461 --> 01:07:50,462
cast a terrifying
darkness over your deathbed.

1100
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:53,538
How soon that day
may come, I cannot know.

1101
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:57,303
But I do know that in our life,
you live no more.

1102
01:07:58,141 --> 01:07:59,186
<i>I disown him.</i>

1103
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:02,298
I would give good money
to have him stabbed,

1104
01:08:02,381 --> 01:08:05,133
and rolled into the kennels
for the dogs to devour.

1105
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:06,332
As would I.

1106
01:08:06,502 --> 01:08:09,983
But I am sure he's
left London in fear of my retribution.

1107
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:13,025
Oh, indeed, sir,
he has not.

1108
01:08:13,502 --> 01:08:15,985
I saw him just now
in the city,

1109
01:08:16,061 --> 01:08:18,784
boasting of his
triumphal attack over you.

1110
01:08:18,822 --> 01:08:20,097
I don't believe it.

1111
01:08:20,182 --> 01:08:23,461
You were there last night, Lord Verisopht.
I wager you could believe it.

1112
01:08:23,862 --> 01:08:25,626
I'll tell you
what I believe.

1113
01:08:26,822 --> 01:08:29,018
I believe you have
only yourself to blame, Hawk.

1114
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:30,342
What?

1115
01:08:30,422 --> 01:08:33,308
If you had only
told him who you were, as he asked.

1116
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:36,538
I was wrong, too,
not to interfere.

1117
01:08:36,582 --> 01:08:38,538
I did not sleep the night,
for thinking about it.

1118
01:08:38,622 --> 01:08:41,988
Whatever mistakes were made,
were made by the boy.

1119
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:45,818
I am his uncle,
and even I can see that he is no good.

1120
01:08:46,142 --> 01:08:48,702
He was defending
the honor of his sister.

1121
01:08:48,783 --> 01:08:51,976
That is the very
definition of goodness.

1122
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,581
How can you not be proud
of what he's done

1123
01:08:55,623 --> 01:08:57,339
in defense
of your own niece?

1124
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,512
You will be glad,
My Lord, that I possess

1125
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:02,939
such an unsentimental view
when I am managing your investments.

1126
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:08,622
Mr. Nickleby, I am no longer sure I
can make an investment with you.

1127
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:12,665
Because of my nephew?

1128
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:14,659
Because of your
treatment of him!

1129
01:09:15,503 --> 01:09:17,056
And his sister!

1130
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:21,258
When I think of her leaving
the theater that night...

1131
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:24,102
I feel sick to recall it.

1132
01:09:26,104 --> 01:09:29,029
Surely there is
another way for me to expand my fortune,

1133
01:09:29,384 --> 01:09:31,704
than to enrich
the tormentor...

1134
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:34,507
Of these children.

1135
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:01,461
I see, from your eyes,
you remember me.

1136
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:05,736
If the change you see in me,
from so long ago, does not move you...

1137
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:06,859
It does not.

1138
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:10,463
Then let the knowledge that I am
as helpless and destitute as a child.

1139
01:10:10,824 --> 01:10:12,703
Any man can earn his bread.

1140
01:10:12,784 --> 01:10:13,992
How?

1141
01:10:14,264 --> 01:10:15,903
Would you show
me the means?

1142
01:10:16,264 --> 01:10:18,306
I did, once.

1143
01:10:19,104 --> 01:10:20,226
Not again.

1144
01:10:20,545 --> 01:10:23,422
It's 20 years and 5 months
since you and I fell out.

1145
01:10:24,584 --> 01:10:25,945
Do you remember the cause?

1146
01:10:26,384 --> 01:10:28,656
You claimed a share
in the profits of some of my business,

1147
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:31,830
alleging that you had brought it to me.
When I refused you,

1148
01:10:32,224 --> 01:10:34,947
you threatened to reveal
some, uh... What was it you said?

1149
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:36,748
Hold I'd gained over
you in your absence.

1150
01:10:36,825 --> 01:10:39,030
Yes, rifling through
my files, I suspect.

1151
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:41,818
So I had you arrested
for an advance you had not repaid.

1152
01:10:41,865 --> 01:10:44,857
Thirty pounds.
That's all I owed you.

1153
01:10:44,945 --> 01:10:46,661
Indeed, it was more.

1154
01:10:46,985 --> 01:10:48,538
There was the interest.

1155
01:10:49,665 --> 01:10:53,146
Seven years I have been gone,
under the most crushing conditions...

1156
01:10:53,705 --> 01:10:56,706
To return as you see me now,
ready to renew my offer,

1157
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,911
but on terms
much easier for you than before.

1158
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:03,980
You will want this information.
I want only to eat and drink.

1159
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,747
Is that all?

1160
01:11:07,706 --> 01:11:10,026
It depends on you
whether that's all or not.

1161
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:15,062
Are you threatening
now to tell others

1162
01:11:15,106 --> 01:11:17,465
of whatever you learned
when you were my clerk?

1163
01:11:18,426 --> 01:11:20,382
To be plain with
you, Mr. Brooker...

1164
01:11:21,386 --> 01:11:24,186
The world already knows
what sort of man I am...

1165
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:27,787
And I do not grow poorer.

1166
01:11:28,706 --> 01:11:30,585
You cannot stain
a black coat.

1167
01:11:30,626 --> 01:11:31,901
No, that's not
what I meant.

1168
01:11:32,546 --> 01:11:33,984
Are those of your
own name dear to you?

1169
01:11:34,026 --> 01:11:35,387
- If they are...
- They are not.

1170
01:11:35,746 --> 01:11:36,868
- But...
- But nothing.

1171
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:38,221
If we meet again, sir,

1172
01:11:38,306 --> 01:11:41,183
and you so much as notice
me with one begging gesture,

1173
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:43,989
you shall see the inside
of a jail once more.

1174
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:48,828
That is my answer
to your trash.

1175
01:11:52,546 --> 01:11:54,665
Mother, this is Smike.

1176
01:11:55,386 --> 01:11:56,978
How do you do, Mr. Pike?

1177
01:11:57,266 --> 01:11:59,663
No, mother, "Smike,"
with an "S."

1178
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:01,381
How do you do?

1179
01:12:01,467 --> 01:12:03,423
Very well, thank
you, Mr. Spike.

1180
01:12:05,707 --> 01:12:07,500
And this is our landlady,
Miss Lacreevy.

1181
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:10,115
She is the artist whose
work fills these walls.

1182
01:12:10,146 --> 01:12:13,387
Oh, I do hope you
will let me make a miniature of you.

1183
01:12:16,427 --> 01:12:19,582
Kate, this is
my faithful friend and fellow traveler.

1184
01:12:20,867 --> 01:12:22,152
I have been so eager

1185
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:25,430
to thank you for being
such a comfort to Nicholas.

1186
01:12:31,067 --> 01:12:32,668
He is my only friend.

1187
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,585
I would lay down
my life to help him.

1188
01:12:37,627 --> 01:12:38,912
To a new beginning.

1189
01:12:39,387 --> 01:12:40,700
To new subjects.

1190
01:12:40,787 --> 01:12:42,024
To an end of villains.

1191
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,312
To finding proper
work as soon as I can.

1192
01:12:44,387 --> 01:12:46,506
And to our
extended family.

1193
01:12:46,588 --> 01:12:48,227
Hear, hear.

1194
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:50,227
Our family.

1195
01:13:13,028 --> 01:13:14,831
Pork pie, Mister?

1196
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:16,581
No, thank you.

1197
01:13:30,388 --> 01:13:32,555
Oh, ah, then you...

1198
01:13:33,348 --> 01:13:34,431
Are you well?

1199
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:36,074
Yes, I...

1200
01:13:37,749 --> 01:13:39,149
Only weary.

1201
01:13:39,428 --> 01:13:42,429
You look so pale
and were still so long.

1202
01:13:43,588 --> 01:13:44,949
Forgive me.

1203
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:19,504
There are many
opportunities here.

1204
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:23,116
Surely a fine-looking gentleman is not
reduced to such a necessity?

1205
01:14:23,509 --> 01:14:24,707
I look no finer
than you, sir.

1206
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:28,273
Yes, but I seek
a worker, not work.

1207
01:14:30,629 --> 01:14:32,988
How did this
come about, hmm?

1208
01:14:33,509 --> 01:14:34,947
Who's it for?

1209
01:14:36,069 --> 01:14:37,191
My father.

1210
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:41,783
It's a bad thing
for a young man to lose a father.

1211
01:14:42,509 --> 01:14:44,714
I feel more of a child
than when he was alive.

1212
01:14:46,789 --> 01:14:49,186
And so I am obliged
to throw off my uncle's protection,

1213
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:52,154
and take care of mother,
Kate, and Smike myself.

1214
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:54,107
But I grow desperate.

1215
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:55,626
Now, don't say
another word.

1216
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:04,433
My boy.

1217
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:09,757
My good sir, would
you be so good as to wait here?

1218
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:13,627
Brother Ned?

1219
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:14,916
Yes, brother Charles?

1220
01:15:15,391 --> 01:15:17,347
I believe I've found
someone for the position.

1221
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,425
We should make inquiries
into his statements.

1222
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,155
If they are confirmed, I'm hopeful they will
be, we should assist him.

1223
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:23,909
It's enough for me
dear brother, that if you say

1224
01:15:23,991 --> 01:15:26,666
he should be assisted,
then we shall assist him.

1225
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:29,629
He has a mother, sister,
and friend in need of support,

1226
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:31,224
as well as the demands
of his own stomach.

1227
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:34,792
Compared to us, dear brother,
he appears to have no stomach at all.

1228
01:15:35,271 --> 01:15:36,671
Frank, where are those cakes?

1229
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:38,187
Mr. Nickleby,
my brother, Ned.

1230
01:15:38,271 --> 01:15:39,383
How do you do, sir?

1231
01:15:39,871 --> 01:15:40,878
Ah!

1232
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,148
Thank you, Frank.

1233
01:15:45,031 --> 01:15:46,114
My friend.

1234
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:47,748
Thank you.

1235
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:50,113
Would you give us a moment
to discuss your salary?

1236
01:15:50,871 --> 01:15:52,031
Now then...

1237
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:53,710
I suppose we should
ascertain his previous...

1238
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:55,594
His previous stipend,
of course.

1239
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:58,826
Uh, forgive me, sir,
your previous salary was?

1240
01:16:02,751 --> 01:16:03,949
A pound a week, sir.

1241
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:08,108
An annual salary
of 52 pounds.

1242
01:16:08,192 --> 01:16:10,234
That's rather
an unsuitable emolument for a boy.

1243
01:16:10,351 --> 01:16:12,825
For such a talented,
prospective youth.

1244
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:20,674
Mr. Nickleby,
we would like to offer you a position here,

1245
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:22,466
working alongside
our nephew, Frank.

1246
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:25,153
Based on the feeling
I had during our walk...

1247
01:16:25,192 --> 01:16:29,066
As well as by the
rapidity with which you ate that cake...

1248
01:16:29,512 --> 01:16:33,156
We'd like to begin you on a salary
of 120 pounds a year.

1249
01:16:37,832 --> 01:16:39,232
Is it not enough?

1250
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:40,992
We won't wait long
before improving it.

1251
01:16:41,032 --> 01:16:42,269
No.

1252
01:16:42,792 --> 01:16:45,189
It is the generosity
of it that undoes me.

1253
01:16:47,033 --> 01:16:48,711
For the first time
since father died,

1254
01:16:48,793 --> 01:16:51,670
I feel we may at last
be in a position to find happiness.

1255
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,678
Thank you, both,
a thousand times.

1256
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:02,399
- Are you at home?
- Yes.

1257
01:17:02,473 --> 01:17:03,633
- To anybody?
- Yes.

1258
01:17:03,713 --> 01:17:04,835
To the tax gatherer?

1259
01:17:04,872 --> 01:17:06,157
No.

1260
01:17:06,233 --> 01:17:07,556
What about...

1261
01:17:10,673 --> 01:17:12,437
Oh, I'd know
your face anywhere.

1262
01:17:12,513 --> 01:17:15,629
You'd know it better
if your nephew hadn't maltreated it.

1263
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:17,838
And, who is this?

1264
01:17:18,153 --> 01:17:20,397
My son, Little Wackford.

1265
01:17:20,713 --> 01:17:23,829
Indeed a specimen of
the Dotheboys's old diet.

1266
01:17:23,913 --> 01:17:26,147
A miracle
of high feeding.

1267
01:17:26,593 --> 01:17:28,597
His flesh, his firmness.

1268
01:17:30,473 --> 01:17:31,547
And those tears.

1269
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:33,426
His oiliness.

1270
01:17:33,673 --> 01:17:35,312
I'd expect nothing less.

1271
01:17:36,633 --> 01:17:39,749
And Mrs., uh, Squeers,
uh, how is...

1272
01:17:40,193 --> 01:17:42,159
Mrs. Squeers is
as she always is.

1273
01:17:42,193 --> 01:17:44,513
A joy to all
them as knows her.

1274
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,391
One of our lads had
an abscess last week.

1275
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:52,237
To see her operate
on him with a penknife.

1276
01:17:52,674 --> 01:17:55,426
And you? Have you recovered
from that scoundrel's attack?

1277
01:17:55,513 --> 01:17:56,548
Only just.

1278
01:17:57,194 --> 01:17:59,428
Your nephew
is a vicious animal.

1279
01:17:59,753 --> 01:18:01,709
That is why
I asked you to come.

1280
01:18:02,314 --> 01:18:04,270
Noggs, see this package?

1281
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:05,751
It's big enough.

1282
01:18:05,834 --> 01:18:07,473
Take it, please, at once.

1283
01:18:08,554 --> 01:18:10,481
"Take it, please,
at once."

1284
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:14,592
"At once, do you hear?
If not sooner."

1285
01:18:16,634 --> 01:18:18,273
He may be a little mad.

1286
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:22,316
I, uh, wanted to offer you...

1287
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:25,628
This as a recompense

1288
01:18:26,474 --> 01:18:28,430
to your troubles, though...

1289
01:18:29,195 --> 01:18:30,585
It seems foolish...

1290
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:32,520
If the boy is unpunished.

1291
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:34,550
He might come
after you again.

1292
01:18:34,955 --> 01:18:36,834
Surely he's been
punished by you.

1293
01:18:37,275 --> 01:18:38,473
Our ties have been cut.

1294
01:18:38,554 --> 01:18:41,037
I'm not sure that
he views that as a punishment.

1295
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:43,834
What about the other boy?

1296
01:18:44,275 --> 01:18:45,272
Smike?

1297
01:18:45,355 --> 01:18:46,352
Yes.

1298
01:18:47,474 --> 01:18:50,590
You said that my nephew
was quite attached to him.

1299
01:18:51,154 --> 01:18:52,352
What do you know of him?

1300
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:55,960
Only that he came to us
12 or so years ago.

1301
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:59,353
The money was paid at first,
and then it stopped.

1302
01:19:00,475 --> 01:19:02,556
But I kept the lad
out of charity,

1303
01:19:02,635 --> 01:19:05,761
which coincided with a period
of usefulness on his part.

1304
01:19:05,995 --> 01:19:06,992
No parents then?

1305
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,034
No.

1306
01:19:08,075 --> 01:19:09,590
No person with
any claim on him?

1307
01:19:09,675 --> 01:19:10,797
No.

1308
01:19:11,315 --> 01:19:12,638
So he's yours.

1309
01:19:13,356 --> 01:19:14,717
And he's been stolen.

1310
01:19:14,795 --> 01:19:16,914
Would it not be
well within your rights to take him?

1311
01:19:17,115 --> 01:19:19,714
That would
settle your score with my nephew.

1312
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:23,633
Wounding him,
not through force...

1313
01:19:25,315 --> 01:19:27,281
But through
his own affections.

1314
01:19:28,996 --> 01:19:32,678
Capturing wayward boys
is something of a specialty.

1315
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:36,556
It's most kind of you
to join me on my errands.

1316
01:19:36,835 --> 01:19:37,995
Ribbons for sale.

1317
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:39,434
Oh, dear.

1318
01:19:39,756 --> 01:19:40,791
What is it?

1319
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:42,391
Father used to tell me
there were girls

1320
01:19:42,476 --> 01:19:44,921
who sold ribbons
on the streets in London,

1321
01:19:44,996 --> 01:19:48,717
and that if we ever came here, he would
buy me some as a remembrance.

1322
01:19:50,476 --> 01:19:51,828
Ribbons for sale.

1323
01:19:59,116 --> 01:20:00,228
How much is it, please?

1324
01:20:00,276 --> 01:20:02,481
Two pence for the pink ones.
Penny for the others.

1325
01:20:02,556 --> 01:20:04,195
I'll take the
pink one, please.

1326
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:06,792
Thank you.

1327
01:20:15,796 --> 01:20:18,395
Help! Help! Help!

1328
01:20:18,477 --> 01:20:20,001
Somebody! Help!

1329
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,555
It's Smike.
He's been taken.

1330
01:20:31,877 --> 01:20:34,485
It must be the wretched Squeers.
He was with your uncle.

1331
01:20:34,557 --> 01:20:37,194
I didn't hear it all,
but they were speaking of Smike.

1332
01:20:37,237 --> 01:20:38,723
Newman, what shall we do?

1333
01:20:39,037 --> 01:20:40,955
He stays at the Saracen's Head.

1334
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:45,244
Squeers, but no Smike.

1335
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:50,643
It's John Browdie.

1336
01:20:51,437 --> 01:20:52,760
Is John Browdie good or bad?

1337
01:20:53,357 --> 01:20:55,438
He gave me money
when he heard I'd beaten Squeers.

1338
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:57,519
Oh, he's good.
He's very good.

1339
01:20:59,797 --> 01:21:01,513
Well, well, well,
if it isn't...

1340
01:21:01,558 --> 01:21:02,881
Shh!

1341
01:21:04,357 --> 01:21:05,642
What are you doing here?

1342
01:21:05,678 --> 01:21:07,471
Tilda and I are
on our honeymoon.

1343
01:21:07,558 --> 01:21:10,473
Schoolmaster says this was a fine place
to stay. In fact, he's here as well.

1344
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:13,032
I know. Do you remember
the boy that was with me that night?

1345
01:21:13,358 --> 01:21:14,911
Crippled lad? Of course.

1346
01:21:15,278 --> 01:21:18,279
We suspect that Squeers has taken
him, just this day, by force.

1347
01:21:18,718 --> 01:21:21,115
He's talked of
nothing but revenge since you left.

1348
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:23,111
Could you find
out if he has him?

1349
01:21:23,438 --> 01:21:26,516
Who do you suppose we've laid
our hands on, Wackford and me?

1350
01:21:26,598 --> 01:21:29,360
- In London?
- Not that hateful, horrible Mr. Knuckleboy?

1351
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:31,114
No, but next door to him.

1352
01:21:31,318 --> 01:21:33,523
- Smike?
- Aye!

1353
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:36,436
Me and young Wackford,
we grabbed him!

1354
01:21:36,518 --> 01:21:39,433
He was crying and begging me
to let him go, but I wouldn't.

1355
01:21:39,518 --> 01:21:41,119
What have thee
done with him?

1356
01:21:41,918 --> 01:21:44,392
He's in the schoolmaster's room,
next to Tilda's and my room.

1357
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:45,797
What is the way in?

1358
01:21:45,839 --> 01:21:47,037
You must go
through the inn,

1359
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:48,997
but, the schoolmaster
is sitting in the front room,

1360
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:50,236
just by the stairs.

1361
01:21:50,318 --> 01:21:51,804
Oh, dear, it's impossible.

1362
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:53,993
I could distract the schoolmaster.

1363
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:56,198
Thee could slip past
and go up to my room.

1364
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,838
There is a door
adjoining the schoolmaster's.

1365
01:21:58,918 --> 01:22:00,481
Go through it,
get the lad.

1366
01:22:00,558 --> 01:22:02,437
I'll watch the stairs
and again try

1367
01:22:02,478 --> 01:22:04,165
to distract him
when thee come out.

1368
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:07,116
May I offer
an opinion with regards to this scheme?

1369
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:10,800
It seems, uh, foolhardy,
redolent of danger,

1370
01:22:11,118 --> 01:22:15,002
and doomed to failure.
Otherwise, I can find no fault with it.

1371
01:22:15,599 --> 01:22:16,922
It is for Smike.

1372
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,115
Schoolmaster,
I couldn't trouble thee

1373
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,962
to take the head
of the table, could I?

1374
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,084
Eh? Oh, aye, aye.

1375
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:28,046
I'd like to propose
a toast to thee...

1376
01:22:28,839 --> 01:22:33,154
And thy family.
To thee, Mr. Squeers and the lovely Fanny.

1377
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,474
Mr. Squeers...

1378
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,878
I'd like to
congratulate thee.

1379
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,594
I think it's about
time for a song. Come on, Tilda.

1380
01:23:51,921 --> 01:23:53,877
Be still.
Do not worry.

1381
01:23:58,161 --> 01:23:59,369
Oh, thank you.

1382
01:24:00,721 --> 01:24:02,485
You are the best
and bravest friend.

1383
01:24:02,521 --> 01:24:05,637
Hush. Lean forward.
I shall untie you.

1384
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:08,643
Grand singer, my wife.

1385
01:24:08,882 --> 01:24:11,605
Little Wackford,
you left our bedroom window open.

1386
01:24:11,642 --> 01:24:15,123
- I did not.
- Don't argue with me, piglet, go and shut it.

1387
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:24,158
I thought I would
have to go back.

1388
01:24:26,282 --> 01:24:27,682
Never.

1389
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:31,118
But we are not free yet.
Speed and silence are of the essence.

1390
01:24:38,962 --> 01:24:42,443
Brisket. Nice bit
of rolled brisket here.

1391
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:44,639
Lovely, lovely beef brisket.

1392
01:24:54,682 --> 01:24:56,321
Thee talking about
the same blacksmith?

1393
01:24:56,402 --> 01:24:57,600
Aye, that's him.

1394
01:24:57,682 --> 01:25:00,079
Saw him the other day.
I stuck up for thee.

1395
01:25:00,922 --> 01:25:04,086
He said thee weren't
fit to live with pigs. I said thee were.

1396
01:25:04,122 --> 01:25:06,644
Thank you kindly, John Browdie,
you're an honorable man.

1397
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:20,797
Fine door, that.

1398
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:24,961
Quick, quick.
Squeers is outside.

1399
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:40,049
It's been a grand day,
John Browdie.

1400
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:41,521
Aye, that it has.

1401
01:25:41,604 --> 01:25:42,649
Ah!

1402
01:25:52,243 --> 01:25:53,480
He was stolen?

1403
01:25:54,403 --> 01:25:55,764
Right from under you?

1404
01:25:56,483 --> 01:25:59,283
Well, to be literal about it,
and I'm not sure this will dissipate

1405
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:01,404
your various strong
emotions on the subject,

1406
01:26:01,484 --> 01:26:04,121
but he was actually
stolen right from over me.

1407
01:26:04,924 --> 01:26:07,762
My nephew does not know
the enemy he has made in me.

1408
01:26:08,803 --> 01:26:11,450
I shall put his ruin
ahead of my own business!

1409
01:26:11,924 --> 01:26:13,765
Certainly done that already.

1410
01:26:13,844 --> 01:26:15,167
What?

1411
01:26:15,244 --> 01:26:18,639
The bank sent a letter
saying you were short in your accounts.

1412
01:26:19,124 --> 01:26:20,927
Sir Mulberry also wrote.

1413
01:26:21,684 --> 01:26:24,091
He declined your
invitation to invest.

1414
01:26:24,164 --> 01:26:25,362
Rubbish!

1415
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:27,805
The boy is not invincible.

1416
01:26:28,644 --> 01:26:31,569
People who wish to
be thought of as good are always weak!

1417
01:26:34,484 --> 01:26:37,648
I will listen to every
rumor and every rumble...

1418
01:26:38,604 --> 01:26:40,445
Until I can strike him.

1419
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:44,120
And then I will strike him...

1420
01:26:46,404 --> 01:26:48,887
Until he can be
struck no more.

1421
01:26:58,325 --> 01:27:00,722
Now, my dear,
my dear, you must...

1422
01:27:00,805 --> 01:27:04,132
I do entreat and beseech of you...
No, no, you must get up.

1423
01:27:05,325 --> 01:27:06,600
Oh, oh, oh...

1424
01:27:06,645 --> 01:27:08,572
No, please, a chair,
place her here.

1425
01:27:10,485 --> 01:27:13,199
Not a word
for your life, brother Ned.

1426
01:27:13,245 --> 01:27:15,441
Now, my dear sir,
you must leave.

1427
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:18,485
Well, well, is...
Is there no way I could be of service?

1428
01:27:19,165 --> 01:27:20,766
...To which they said no.

1429
01:27:21,205 --> 01:27:24,082
It has now been three weeks.
She's never come back.

1430
01:27:24,565 --> 01:27:26,761
And no one will tell
me anything about her.

1431
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:28,561
They never answer any
questions on the matter,

1432
01:27:28,645 --> 01:27:30,687
and discourage
the posing of others.

1433
01:27:31,685 --> 01:27:33,324
This distresses me.

1434
01:27:33,366 --> 01:27:36,924
Nicholas, have you found
your matching half?

1435
01:27:38,485 --> 01:27:41,208
Well, then we must think
of how to find her.

1436
01:27:41,726 --> 01:27:44,488
For when she knows you,
she will love you, too.

1437
01:27:45,726 --> 01:27:47,250
This is our nephew, Frank.

1438
01:27:47,486 --> 01:27:49,241
This is Mr. Nickleby's sister, Kate.

1439
01:27:49,846 --> 01:27:52,886
My uncle tells me you're quite a
gardener. May I show you around?

1440
01:27:52,926 --> 01:27:54,048
Please.

1441
01:27:54,966 --> 01:27:57,200
Uh, Mrs. Nickleby,
I wonder if you would excuse Nicholas.

1442
01:27:57,286 --> 01:27:59,127
We have a small
matter of business to attend to.

1443
01:27:59,726 --> 01:28:01,126
Yes, of course.

1444
01:28:03,886 --> 01:28:06,408
I never thought I should find fault
with any statement of your brother's,

1445
01:28:06,486 --> 01:28:09,046
but he has described you
as exceedingly pretty.

1446
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:10,765
May I offer
the correction

1447
01:28:10,806 --> 01:28:13,088
that such a remark
seems inadequate?

1448
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:14,759
He has told me
much of you

1449
01:28:14,807 --> 01:28:17,243
and of how patient
you have been in teaching him.

1450
01:28:21,127 --> 01:28:22,277
Do you remember
the young lady

1451
01:28:22,327 --> 01:28:23,602
who fainted
in our office?

1452
01:28:23,886 --> 01:28:25,046
Fainted?

1453
01:28:25,806 --> 01:28:26,889
Oh, yes.

1454
01:28:27,407 --> 01:28:31,454
She is the daughter of a lady whom,
when she herself was young...

1455
01:28:32,487 --> 01:28:34,328
I loved very dearly.

1456
01:28:41,807 --> 01:28:44,885
You will smile, perhaps,
to hear an old man talk about such things.

1457
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:46,802
I have no such inclination.

1458
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:49,772
In fact, I'm eager
to know if she returned your affection.

1459
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:51,652
She made another choice.

1460
01:28:52,087 --> 01:28:53,448
<i>A man named Bray.</i>

1461
01:28:54,327 --> 01:28:56,408
<i>Inconsiderate of
all obligations,</i>

1462
01:28:56,447 --> 01:28:58,614
<i>except to those
of his own leisure,</i>

1463
01:28:58,647 --> 01:29:01,763
<i>he squandered his fortune,
and then hers.</i>

1464
01:29:02,648 --> 01:29:06,848
<i>Finally, after 20 years
of bitter unhappiness, she came to me...</i>

1465
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:10,771
<i>Sadly changed.
She was dying.</i>

1466
01:29:11,087 --> 01:29:14,165
<i>And she asked us to
help her daughter, Madeline,</i>

1467
01:29:14,207 --> 01:29:15,808
<i>should she ever
seek our assistance.</i>

1468
01:29:17,247 --> 01:29:19,606
But Madeline has sought
these past two years

1469
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,001
to earn her money
on her own.

1470
01:29:21,688 --> 01:29:25,207
However, the demands for
service her father places upon her

1471
01:29:25,808 --> 01:29:30,162
<i>make steady, not to mention
lucrative, employment an impossibility.</i>

1472
01:29:30,488 --> 01:29:32,885
Finally, she came to us,
that day you caught her from fainting,

1473
01:29:32,968 --> 01:29:36,094
and made the appeal,
asking only that her father never know.

1474
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:38,804
So we came up
with this scheme...

1475
01:29:39,528 --> 01:29:41,887
Of which we are not
unreasonably proud.

1476
01:29:42,648 --> 01:29:43,683
It is a very
good scheme.

1477
01:29:43,768 --> 01:29:45,695
Oh, it's very good,
indeed, very good.

1478
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:48,844
Madeline is an artist,

1479
01:29:49,368 --> 01:29:51,928
and we thought that
someone could make a feint

1480
01:29:51,968 --> 01:29:54,730
of commissioning
her paintings for a high price.

1481
01:29:55,408 --> 01:29:57,930
This allows her
to stay at home, where he needs her...

1482
01:29:58,049 --> 01:29:59,775
And allows our involvement
to be disguised.

1483
01:29:59,809 --> 01:30:01,132
He knows us.

1484
01:30:01,968 --> 01:30:05,046
We were hoping
you would be the agent.

1485
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:27,213
Madeline, who is this?

1486
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,409
Who told a stranger
we could be seen?

1487
01:30:30,969 --> 01:30:33,251
I'm here to purchase
some paintings, sir.

1488
01:30:34,249 --> 01:30:35,284
These three, please.

1489
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:36,532
Very well.

1490
01:30:36,569 --> 01:30:39,647
I want a newspaper,
and grapes, and another bottle of wine!

1491
01:30:40,009 --> 01:30:43,768
Yes, Father, very well,
I'll just finish with this gentleman.

1492
01:30:43,929 --> 01:30:45,012
I want it now!

1493
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:53,526
Please, Father.

1494
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:57,608
This purchase will help us
pay for the things you want.

1495
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:01,931
This never happened
when your mother was alive.

1496
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:10,533
Sir.

1497
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:14,122
Pray, do not mention
to my mother's dear friends

1498
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,368
what has passed here.

1499
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:16,888
Father has
suffered so much,

1500
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,931
and is worse than
usual this morning.

1501
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:22,168
You have but
to hint at a wish,

1502
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:24,846
and I would hazard
my life to gratify it.

1503
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:29,565
Have you ever
had the sensation

1504
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,047
of looking at someone
for the first time,

1505
01:31:32,531 --> 01:31:35,206
and ever so quickly,
the past and future seem to fuse?

1506
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:36,733
The first time
I saw you...

1507
01:31:36,811 --> 01:31:37,856
At your uncle's.

1508
01:31:38,331 --> 01:31:41,524
And then, that day
on the street by the wall.

1509
01:31:41,971 --> 01:31:43,131
You remember.

1510
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:45,090
I felt such
concern for you.

1511
01:31:45,331 --> 01:31:46,568
And I for you.

1512
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:48,894
Does that not
mean something?

1513
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:51,768
That we felt so much,
so deeply, before speaking?

1514
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:54,249
And now that
I know your history,

1515
01:31:54,651 --> 01:31:57,537
I entreat you to believe,
I would do anything to help you.

1516
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:04,003
Do you know Madeline Bray?

1517
01:32:04,411 --> 01:32:07,134
Nigel Bray's daughter?
Oh, indeed I do.

1518
01:32:07,171 --> 01:32:09,453
She may be
the prettiest girl in all of London.

1519
01:32:09,531 --> 01:32:11,132
Well, Bray owes me money.

1520
01:32:12,091 --> 01:32:14,651
What if I were
to, uh, erase that debt

1521
01:32:14,691 --> 01:32:17,453
in exchange
for his giving you his daughter's hand?

1522
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:21,934
Would that put you in a better frame of
mind to consider my investment?

1523
01:32:23,852 --> 01:32:26,057
I should say it would secure it.

1524
01:32:31,252 --> 01:32:32,287
My...

1525
01:32:33,052 --> 01:32:36,619
The canvas must blush,
she flatters it so.

1526
01:32:37,572 --> 01:32:39,010
Are they
not extraordinary?

1527
01:32:40,652 --> 01:32:41,774
Frank.

1528
01:32:41,851 --> 01:32:44,248
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I was passing this way.

1529
01:32:45,052 --> 01:32:46,528
I remember
your telling me on our walk

1530
01:32:46,612 --> 01:32:48,175
how much
you like violets.

1531
01:32:49,412 --> 01:32:51,771
I thought
I would bring some for your mother and...

1532
01:32:53,012 --> 01:32:54,210
All of you.

1533
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:57,652
That is most kind of you.
They're lovely.

1534
01:32:58,612 --> 01:33:00,568
Lovely.
Thank you.

1535
01:33:01,092 --> 01:33:02,415
Won't you stay and have supper?

1536
01:33:03,812 --> 01:33:05,327
Why, of course.

1537
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:23,172
Smike, old friend,
will you not join us?

1538
01:33:24,733 --> 01:33:26,171
I'm not hungry tonight.

1539
01:33:37,773 --> 01:33:39,691
You seem so
melancholy of late.

1540
01:33:41,013 --> 01:33:42,652
Do you fear Squeers
might come again?

1541
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:46,657
It is not that.

1542
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:49,331
No.

1543
01:33:49,733 --> 01:33:51,171
Then what?

1544
01:33:51,774 --> 01:33:54,334
Speak of it, and
let me help you if I can.

1545
01:34:01,813 --> 01:34:04,018
I will tell you
the reason one day...

1546
01:34:05,653 --> 01:34:07,091
Not now.

1547
01:34:10,654 --> 01:34:12,572
I hate myself for it.

1548
01:34:15,454 --> 01:34:17,295
But I cannot help it.

1549
01:34:21,854 --> 01:34:24,011
Will you trust me
to tell you later?

1550
01:34:24,974 --> 01:34:26,259
Of course.

1551
01:34:37,214 --> 01:34:39,093
My heart is very full.

1552
01:34:41,574 --> 01:34:43,300
You cannot know how much.

1553
01:35:13,535 --> 01:35:15,290
I shall want two more
in a week's time.

1554
01:35:16,175 --> 01:35:17,412
Is that possible?

1555
01:35:18,015 --> 01:35:20,537
No, there won't
be any more sales.

1556
01:35:20,575 --> 01:35:21,773
Father.

1557
01:35:22,655 --> 01:35:24,448
Not since the news.

1558
01:35:25,495 --> 01:35:26,693
The news?

1559
01:35:28,176 --> 01:35:29,259
What is it?

1560
01:35:35,976 --> 01:35:37,414
Can you not go
see her and ask?

1561
01:35:37,496 --> 01:35:38,694
No, no.

1562
01:35:38,976 --> 01:35:41,776
That would arouse suspicion
on her father's part.

1563
01:35:42,335 --> 01:35:44,732
She will come to us
and tell us, I feel sure.

1564
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:47,168
I shall ask my
sister and mother.

1565
01:35:47,496 --> 01:35:48,733
Perhaps their
feminine sympathies

1566
01:35:48,775 --> 01:35:50,136
can shed some light
on the mystery.

1567
01:35:50,175 --> 01:35:52,217
There is no need.
Your sister is here.

1568
01:35:53,096 --> 01:35:54,496
Forgive me,

1569
01:35:54,535 --> 01:35:55,772
but there is
a matter about which

1570
01:35:55,816 --> 01:35:58,136
I am harboring
the gravest concerns.

1571
01:35:59,016 --> 01:36:00,214
It is Smike.

1572
01:36:02,376 --> 01:36:03,536
Inhale.

1573
01:36:06,696 --> 01:36:07,818
Again.

1574
01:36:07,896 --> 01:36:09,056
<i>He's gravely ill.</i>

1575
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:11,781
Every token of
rapid consumption is present.

1576
01:36:12,256 --> 01:36:15,929
His only hope depends upon his being
instantly removed from London.

1577
01:36:16,016 --> 01:36:18,097
Um, Devonshire's
the best place.

1578
01:36:18,616 --> 01:36:20,332
We come from Devonshire.

1579
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:23,498
Whoever takes him should
prepare for the worst.

1580
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:25,216
He may never return.

1581
01:36:27,496 --> 01:36:29,011
Good evening.

1582
01:36:36,057 --> 01:36:37,179
Father,

1583
01:36:37,216 --> 01:36:38,894
I know I am stronger
than when you left us,

1584
01:36:38,976 --> 01:36:41,133
but not strong enough
to lose Smike.

1585
01:36:42,257 --> 01:36:45,373
If this is what that strength is for,
then I do not want it.

1586
01:36:46,297 --> 01:36:47,620
Not Smike.

1587
01:37:07,297 --> 01:37:08,773
This is my room.

1588
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:10,217
Once, when Kate
was very little, she was lost.

1589
01:38:10,819 --> 01:38:13,542
After hours of search,
we found her here, fast asleep,

1590
01:38:14,018 --> 01:38:15,897
before there was any grave,

1591
01:38:15,938 --> 01:38:18,220
protected from
the sun by this tree.

1592
01:38:19,139 --> 01:38:21,421
Father took her up,
still sleeping,

1593
01:38:21,499 --> 01:38:23,858
and told my mother
that whenever he died,

1594
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:27,094
he wished to be buried
where his dear little child had laid her head.

1595
01:38:31,059 --> 01:38:32,862
It is a beautiful tree.

1596
01:38:35,339 --> 01:38:36,854
It is like a home.

1597
01:38:49,019 --> 01:38:50,582
What is it, Smike?

1598
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,820
Do you remember my telling you of the
man who took me to school?

1599
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,384
I just now raised my
eyes towards that tree,

1600
01:38:57,899 --> 01:39:00,219
and there, with his
eyes fixed on me, he stood!

1601
01:39:00,259 --> 01:39:02,263
Only reflect
for a moment.

1602
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,254
Granted that
he is alive

1603
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,985
and wandering around
so lonely a place as this,

1604
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,976
so far from
the public road,

1605
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:12,899
do you think at this distance of time you
could possibly know the man again?

1606
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,586
Anywhere.

1607
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,063
Let us go inside.

1608
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:36,984
<i>I've had such
pleasant dreams.</i>

1609
01:39:42,581 --> 01:39:45,381
You asked me some time ago
why I was so melancholy.

1610
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,301
Shall I tell you why?

1611
01:39:49,701 --> 01:39:51,187
Not if it pains you.

1612
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:54,337
I only asked that
I might make you happier.

1613
01:39:56,501 --> 01:39:57,862
I know.

1614
01:39:59,261 --> 01:40:00,421
I felt that.

1615
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:07,183
You will forgive
me, because...

1616
01:40:08,261 --> 01:40:09,785
I could not help it.

1617
01:40:17,702 --> 01:40:21,538
Though I would've died
to make her happy,

1618
01:40:23,621 --> 01:40:26,104
it broke my
heart to see.

1619
01:40:30,022 --> 01:40:32,026
I know he loves her dearly.

1620
01:40:33,142 --> 01:40:34,503
Kate.

1621
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,258
I love her.

1622
01:40:51,262 --> 01:40:53,506
I procured a lock
of her hair.

1623
01:40:54,662 --> 01:40:57,059
It hangs at my breast,
in these ribbons.

1624
01:41:02,462 --> 01:41:04,303
When I am dead,

1625
01:41:04,942 --> 01:41:06,860
would you please
take it off,

1626
01:41:07,302 --> 01:41:09,699
so that no eyes but
yours might see it?

1627
01:41:12,902 --> 01:41:15,021
And when I am
laid in my coffin,

1628
01:41:16,383 --> 01:41:18,665
and am about to be
put in the earth,

1629
01:41:20,582 --> 01:41:22,701
would you hang
it round my neck,

1630
01:41:22,782 --> 01:41:25,256
that it might
rest with me forever?

1631
01:41:26,462 --> 01:41:28,830
On my knees,
I pledge it.

1632
01:41:35,063 --> 01:41:36,549
Now...

1633
01:41:38,303 --> 01:41:40,019
Now I can say it.

1634
01:41:42,983 --> 01:41:44,622
I am happy.

1635
01:42:35,664 --> 01:42:37,227
Newman.

1636
01:42:43,424 --> 01:42:45,706
Smike is gone.

1637
01:42:48,104 --> 01:42:49,542
Bless you, dear boy.

1638
01:42:53,384 --> 01:42:55,139
Thank God for you, Newman.

1639
01:42:55,624 --> 01:42:57,024
Always there to catch me.

1640
01:42:57,065 --> 01:42:58,388
Hmm.

1641
01:42:59,144 --> 01:43:00,630
But what brings you here?

1642
01:43:01,025 --> 01:43:03,585
The young lady for whom
you've come to care so deeply...

1643
01:43:04,185 --> 01:43:05,220
Is she in danger?

1644
01:43:05,265 --> 01:43:07,384
She's to be married
to Sir Mulberry Hawk.

1645
01:43:07,784 --> 01:43:08,781
What?

1646
01:43:08,865 --> 01:43:11,742
Before I tell you this, you must
promise you won't do anything rash.

1647
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,588
Tell me, Newman.
Tell me.

1648
01:43:14,185 --> 01:43:16,103
It was your uncle.
It was his idea.

1649
01:43:16,144 --> 01:43:18,982
I overheard it,
and I'm sure he did it to wound you.

1650
01:43:19,465 --> 01:43:21,344
I've so much more
to tell you about him

1651
01:43:21,385 --> 01:43:23,188
and your
dear friend Smike.

1652
01:43:23,265 --> 01:43:24,943
Your uncle
doesn't know it yet,

1653
01:43:25,025 --> 01:43:27,863
but he has just
lost 10,000 pounds.

1654
01:43:37,065 --> 01:43:38,350
What are you
doing here?

1655
01:43:38,425 --> 01:43:41,541
I come to offer aid
to the unhappy subject of your treachery,

1656
01:43:41,865 --> 01:43:42,939
Madeline Bray.

1657
01:43:42,986 --> 01:43:44,741
Oh, do you know her?

1658
01:43:45,746 --> 01:43:46,868
Nicholas.

1659
01:43:47,145 --> 01:43:48,823
I beg you for
a moment alone.

1660
01:43:49,385 --> 01:43:51,063
You were betrayed
and sold for money.

1661
01:43:51,145 --> 01:43:53,792
This web is of my
own weaving. I...

1662
01:43:53,865 --> 01:43:55,543
I know what
I am doing and why.

1663
01:43:55,626 --> 01:43:58,704
I know why, too.
It only deepens my esteem for you.

1664
01:43:58,786 --> 01:44:00,982
But you cannot
degrade yourself in your own esteem

1665
01:44:01,066 --> 01:44:03,741
by giving yourself away
as payment for another man's debt.

1666
01:44:04,626 --> 01:44:06,908
I will not disguise
from you, sir,

1667
01:44:06,986 --> 01:44:09,230
that I have
undergone some...

1668
01:44:10,506 --> 01:44:12,548
Pain of mind.

1669
01:44:14,346 --> 01:44:17,472
I do not love
the gentleman.

1670
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:22,019
This he knows, and knowing,
still offers me his hand.

1671
01:44:22,146 --> 01:44:24,140
By accepting,
I can free my father...

1672
01:44:24,226 --> 01:44:26,825
Does your own happiness
matter so little?

1673
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:29,705
Father is all that
remains of my family.

1674
01:44:29,907 --> 01:44:32,870
That is why I have
come to offer you a place in our home.

1675
01:44:38,107 --> 01:44:40,543
You have been
so good to me.

1676
01:44:41,947 --> 01:44:44,114
But I cannot leave Father.

1677
01:44:44,507 --> 01:44:46,271
No, he must come with you.

1678
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:51,468
He is too proud.

1679
01:44:53,386 --> 01:44:54,623
I am proud, too...

1680
01:44:57,867 --> 01:44:59,631
To know someone...

1681
01:45:00,827 --> 01:45:02,188
So good.

1682
01:45:06,948 --> 01:45:10,064
Madeline, come at once.
It's your father.

1683
01:45:12,347 --> 01:45:14,907
He wouldn't stir,
even after I tapped him.

1684
01:45:36,587 --> 01:45:37,862
Come.

1685
01:45:38,588 --> 01:45:40,352
Let us leave this place.

1686
01:45:46,828 --> 01:45:48,228
My curse upon you.

1687
01:45:48,868 --> 01:45:51,984
My bitter, deadly
curse upon you, boy.

1688
01:45:52,068 --> 01:45:54,388
Your curse has
no power over me.

1689
01:45:55,188 --> 01:45:58,026
The structures you raised
all through your misspent life

1690
01:45:58,109 --> 01:46:00,103
are crumbling into dust.

1691
01:46:00,868 --> 01:46:02,507
This day,
this very day,

1692
01:46:02,548 --> 01:46:06,825
10,000 pounds of your
hoarded wealth are gone

1693
01:46:07,308 --> 01:46:08,746
in one great crash.

1694
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:11,148
How could you know such a thing?

1695
01:46:11,188 --> 01:46:13,988
It is true,
and you shall find it so.

1696
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:16,387
Your day is done.

1697
01:46:17,228 --> 01:46:19,635
Night is coming
fast for you.

1698
01:46:24,109 --> 01:46:27,906
10,000 pounds?
Can that be true?

1699
01:46:29,388 --> 01:46:31,306
I've invested such a sum,

1700
01:46:32,109 --> 01:46:35,225
and I am waiting...

1701
01:46:36,389 --> 01:46:37,827
For news of it.

1702
01:46:40,669 --> 01:46:42,472
But he could not know that.

1703
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:46,470
He could not know that.

1704
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:51,511
If he is right that you
have lost the money,

1705
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:53,393
and the money
that Bray owed you,

1706
01:46:53,469 --> 01:46:55,789
you shall not
have my money now.

1707
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:58,030
He is...

1708
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:02,348
Not right.

1709
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:07,712
My life collapsed
like a house of sticks

1710
01:47:07,789 --> 01:47:09,553
the day my father died.

1711
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,952
I clung to my mother and sister,
then Smike and Noggs,

1712
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:17,033
hoping, waiting for
I knew not what.

1713
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:21,034
I knew not what,
until that day when I opened my eyes,

1714
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:24,033
and the darkness
was replaced with the sight of your face.

1715
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:25,382
It was the island
towards which

1716
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:28,067
I'd been sailing,
unguided, my whole life,

1717
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:30,070
the dream my father
had promised me

1718
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:32,749
before I could even
imagine its existence.

1719
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:37,101
I have been
happy for times,

1720
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:39,223
little times,
since he died,

1721
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:41,635
but never at peace.

1722
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:45,024
Not until I looked
at your face

1723
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:48,029
and saw the universe
in order behind it.

1724
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:49,155
Nicholas...

1725
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:53,554
I feel you know
what it's like

1726
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:55,824
to be without
happiness, but...

1727
01:47:56,711 --> 01:47:59,156
Do you know
what it's like to be afraid of it?

1728
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:01,222
To see the world as...

1729
01:48:02,031 --> 01:48:04,745
So conniving, you
cannot take pleasure

1730
01:48:04,791 --> 01:48:07,063
in the appearance
of something good,

1731
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:10,195
because you
suspect it is...

1732
01:48:11,311 --> 01:48:12,596
It is only
a painted drop

1733
01:48:12,631 --> 01:48:14,836
behind which
other troubles lie.

1734
01:48:16,271 --> 01:48:17,949
That has been my life.

1735
01:48:19,471 --> 01:48:22,233
Every good thing
has been a trick.

1736
01:48:24,071 --> 01:48:25,509
Until you.

1737
01:48:27,312 --> 01:48:29,632
Yet I am afraid
to take your hand.

1738
01:48:31,231 --> 01:48:35,268
What if you cannot
or will not save me?

1739
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:39,786
I can bear to be maltreated
by the greedy or the weak...

1740
01:48:41,272 --> 01:48:42,959
But to be let down...

1741
01:48:44,152 --> 01:48:45,389
By an angel...

1742
01:48:45,431 --> 01:48:46,716
I am not an angel.

1743
01:48:47,351 --> 01:48:50,199
I live as far
from that lofty perch as any man.

1744
01:48:50,632 --> 01:48:53,077
My temper alone,
my impatience, well...

1745
01:48:54,071 --> 01:48:57,552
Perhaps I should not list all my
faults, in case I am too persuasive.

1746
01:48:57,952 --> 01:49:01,864
You are the one who is so
admirably able and strong.

1747
01:49:10,113 --> 01:49:12,549
I am tired of being strong.

1748
01:49:14,152 --> 01:49:15,312
As am I.

1749
01:49:15,952 --> 01:49:18,992
Weakness is tiring,
but strength is exhausting.

1750
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:24,789
You see,
I cannot save you...

1751
01:49:26,192 --> 01:49:28,071
For I need saving, too.

1752
01:49:30,432 --> 01:49:32,119
What are you proposing?

1753
01:49:33,073 --> 01:49:34,425
Only this...

1754
01:49:35,232 --> 01:49:38,828
That we save
ourselves together.

1755
01:49:52,113 --> 01:49:55,632
Nicholas, please.
Think of the others. People might see.

1756
01:49:57,353 --> 01:49:58,360
I don't care.

1757
01:49:58,873 --> 01:50:00,273
I don't care.

1758
01:50:13,913 --> 01:50:15,313
Noggs?

1759
01:50:25,874 --> 01:50:27,034
Oh.

1760
01:50:56,754 --> 01:50:58,192
My God.

1761
01:51:01,554 --> 01:51:03,107
My God.

1762
01:51:20,155 --> 01:51:22,034
10,000...

1763
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:25,111
Pounds.

1764
01:52:01,636 --> 01:52:03,477
Who bade you
enter this house?

1765
01:52:04,595 --> 01:52:05,793
I have no
business with you.

1766
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:09,004
Alas, we have
business with you.

1767
01:52:10,436 --> 01:52:14,032
We have come to report
a tragedy in your family.

1768
01:52:14,116 --> 01:52:15,401
Has something
happened to my niece?

1769
01:52:15,476 --> 01:52:18,554
No, sir. Though we do
bring news of a death.

1770
01:52:18,836 --> 01:52:21,588
Don't tell me
it's her brother's death?

1771
01:52:22,516 --> 01:52:24,597
That would be too
welcome to be true.

1772
01:52:24,676 --> 01:52:26,507
Sorry to disappoint
you, uncle.

1773
01:52:27,196 --> 01:52:29,958
But it will not be the last unhappy
development for you this night.

1774
01:52:30,356 --> 01:52:31,478
You know nothing.

1775
01:52:31,516 --> 01:52:32,916
Every word I am
about to say to you

1776
01:52:32,956 --> 01:52:33,991
is based on information

1777
01:52:34,037 --> 01:52:35,955
from an
unimpeachable source.

1778
01:52:36,796 --> 01:52:37,841
This man...

1779
01:52:38,957 --> 01:52:40,990
Who'd sell his
soul for a drink?

1780
01:52:41,876 --> 01:52:43,352
Oh, this is a good beginning.

1781
01:52:43,436 --> 01:52:46,111
To tamper with a fellow like this,
whose every word is a lie!

1782
01:52:46,197 --> 01:52:48,163
Who made me
a fellow like this?

1783
01:52:48,677 --> 01:52:50,681
If I'd sell my soul
for a drink,

1784
01:52:50,757 --> 01:52:52,991
why wasn't I
a thief? Swindler?

1785
01:52:54,076 --> 01:52:56,157
Here, you, Nickleby!

1786
01:52:58,717 --> 01:53:01,392
You say they
tampered with me.

1787
01:53:02,197 --> 01:53:05,592
Who was it tampered with
the Yorkshire schoolmaster

1788
01:53:05,997 --> 01:53:08,433
to take Smike
away from them?

1789
01:53:11,758 --> 01:53:14,673
Aye,
you're listening now, aren't you?

1790
01:53:15,437 --> 01:53:19,321
You are an eavesdropping,
drunken scoundrel.

1791
01:53:19,957 --> 01:53:23,073
I deny the charge,
but ask regardless, what of it?

1792
01:53:24,397 --> 01:53:26,871
I'm back, Mr. Nickleby.

1793
01:53:30,118 --> 01:53:31,719
What have we now?

1794
01:53:33,877 --> 01:53:35,162
Do you know who this is?

1795
01:53:35,198 --> 01:53:37,873
We are satisfied
Mr. Brooker speaks the truth.

1796
01:53:38,558 --> 01:53:39,996
A common thief.

1797
01:53:40,478 --> 01:53:42,597
A beggar.
A convict!

1798
01:53:43,958 --> 01:53:45,876
Were you not
once married?

1799
01:53:49,558 --> 01:53:50,843
What?

1800
01:54:02,998 --> 01:54:04,925
There's no crime in that.

1801
01:54:05,558 --> 01:54:08,205
<i>But you
desired the marriage to be kept secret,</i>

1802
01:54:08,278 --> 01:54:10,234
<i>for if your wife's
father had known,</i>

1803
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:13,915
<i>he would have changed his will
and denied you his fortune.</i>

1804
01:54:18,838 --> 01:54:21,676
Mr. Brooker also tells us
your wife had a child.

1805
01:54:22,958 --> 01:54:24,156
Your child.

1806
01:54:25,799 --> 01:54:27,477
Because
the marriage was secret,

1807
01:54:27,519 --> 01:54:29,283
this, too, had
to be kept secret,

1808
01:54:29,879 --> 01:54:31,125
and you sent her away.

1809
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:33,240
Hush, my dear.

1810
01:54:33,798 --> 01:54:35,514
Don't mind it now.

1811
01:54:36,118 --> 01:54:37,921
Let me raise your head.

1812
01:54:41,239 --> 01:54:42,361
There.

1813
01:54:45,319 --> 01:54:47,879
<i>So the child was
put out to nurse, far away.</i>

1814
01:54:49,919 --> 01:54:53,553
<i>His mother never saw him,
and she grew tired of the deception.</i>

1815
01:54:54,959 --> 01:54:56,762
So she eloped
with another man.

1816
01:54:57,239 --> 01:55:00,720
Soon thereafter,
she came into her money.

1817
01:55:01,959 --> 01:55:03,560
You, naturally,
pursued her,

1818
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,394
leaving me in
charge of the boy.

1819
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:09,604
<i>I was told to bring
him here, which I did,</i>

1820
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,003
<i>keeping him in the garret.</i>

1821
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:13,564
<i>Neglect
made him sickly.</i>

1822
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,126
<i>Mr. Brooker
consulted a doctor</i>

1823
01:55:16,199 --> 01:55:19,315
<i>who said he must be
removed from the city for a change of air,</i>

1824
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,558
or he would die.

1825
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,917
But he did die.
I know that.

1826
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,355
At last I can say it.

1827
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:34,319
I told you that
the boy had died, but he had not.

1828
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:39,473
<i>I had heard, like most men,
of Yorkshire schools.</i>

1829
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,960
<i>So I took the child to one
kept by a man named Squeers.</i>

1830
01:55:45,081 --> 01:55:46,567
<i>I was able to pay the
fees myself at first,</i>

1831
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:48,116
<i>but then my
troubles took over</i>

1832
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:49,801
<i>and I was sent away
out of this country.</i>

1833
01:55:50,681 --> 01:55:53,567
<i>When I returned,
nearly eight years later, I sought you out.</i>

1834
01:55:54,801 --> 01:55:55,961
<i>But you repulsed me.</i>

1835
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,396
<i>So I found out your clerk,</i>

1836
01:55:58,921 --> 01:56:01,759
<i>and showed him there were good
reasons for communicating with me.</i>

1837
01:56:02,721 --> 01:56:03,996
<i>I told him my story.</i>

1838
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:07,159
<i>But just to be sure that the boy I was
thinking of was the same boy...</i>

1839
01:56:08,721 --> 01:56:12,000
<i>I went to Devonshire,
and knew at once that it was.</i>

1840
01:56:15,121 --> 01:56:16,434
Did Squeers...

1841
01:56:17,881 --> 01:56:19,482
Know who the child was?

1842
01:56:21,241 --> 01:56:22,516
No.

1843
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:25,074
I told him his name was Smike.

1844
01:56:37,722 --> 01:56:39,640
Then the crippled boy...

1845
01:56:43,041 --> 01:56:44,316
Is my son.

1846
01:56:45,242 --> 01:56:47,927
Was your son.

1847
01:56:49,122 --> 01:56:52,996
That boy, whose loving
cheerfulness and sweetness of heart

1848
01:56:53,082 --> 01:56:55,796
could have been
the life-saving comfort you need,

1849
01:56:56,402 --> 01:56:58,521
as all your
fortune falls away,

1850
01:56:59,322 --> 01:57:01,729
that boy now
sleeps in the ground...

1851
01:57:03,362 --> 01:57:04,800
By my father.

1852
01:58:30,204 --> 01:58:32,678
<i>God is working His purpose out</i>

1853
01:58:32,764 --> 01:58:36,283
<i>And the time is drawing near</i>

1854
01:58:36,963 --> 01:58:40,367
<i>Nearer and nearer draws the time</i>

1855
01:58:40,444 --> 01:58:43,608
<i>The time that shall surely be</i>

1856
01:58:44,604 --> 01:58:48,804
<i>When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God</i>

1857
01:58:49,884 --> 01:58:54,238
<i>As the waters cover the sea</i>

1858
01:59:02,124 --> 01:59:03,322
Ring on.

1859
01:59:06,805 --> 01:59:09,327
For births that
lead to early deaths...

1860
01:59:11,564 --> 01:59:14,527
For marriages made in hell...

1861
01:59:17,765 --> 01:59:19,961
And for the coming
in of every year...

1862
01:59:21,445 --> 01:59:24,130
That brings this cursed
world closer to its end.

1863
01:59:30,844 --> 01:59:32,320
Would that it had come...

1864
01:59:37,085 --> 01:59:38,571
Before tonight.

1865
01:59:50,446 --> 01:59:54,569
<i>What can we do to work God's work</i>

1866
01:59:55,246 --> 01:59:58,679
<i>To prosper and increase</i>

1867
01:59:58,725 --> 02:00:02,359
<i>The brotherhood of all mankind</i>

1868
02:00:03,205 --> 02:00:06,446
<i>The reign of the Prince of Peace?</i>

1869
02:00:12,566 --> 02:00:16,047
<i>What can we do to hasten the time</i>

1870
02:00:16,446 --> 02:00:20,052
<i>The time that shall surely be</i>

1871
02:00:20,686 --> 02:00:22,853
<i>When the earth shall be filled</i>

1872
02:00:22,966 --> 02:00:26,447
<i>With the glory of God</i>

1873
02:00:27,646 --> 02:00:33,045
<i>As the waters cover the sea?</i>

1874
02:00:37,406 --> 02:00:38,844
<i>In every life,</i>

1875
02:00:38,926 --> 02:00:41,371
<i>no matter how full
or empty one's purse,</i>

1876
02:00:42,127 --> 02:00:43,690
<i>there is tragedy.</i>

1877
02:00:44,006 --> 02:00:46,883
<i>It is the one promise
life always fulfills.</i>

1878
02:00:47,686 --> 02:00:50,083
<i>Thus, happiness is a gift,</i>

1879
02:00:50,727 --> 02:00:53,047
<i>and the trick is
not to expect it,</i>

1880
02:00:53,087 --> 02:00:55,369
<i>but to delight in it
when it comes,</i>

1881
02:00:56,046 --> 02:00:58,731
<i>and to add to other
people's store of it.</i>

1882
02:00:59,967 --> 02:01:02,690
What happens if, too early,

1883
02:01:02,726 --> 02:01:04,289
we lose a parent,

1884
02:01:04,767 --> 02:01:08,679
that party on whom we rely
for only everything?

1885
02:01:09,527 --> 02:01:12,202
What did these people do
when their families shrank?

1886
02:01:13,207 --> 02:01:17,244
They cried their tears,
but then they did the vital thing.

1887
02:01:18,047 --> 02:01:21,614
They built a new family,
person by person.

1888
02:01:22,207 --> 02:01:25,573
They came to see
that family need not be defined

1889
02:01:25,608 --> 02:01:28,408
merely as those
with whom they share blood,

1890
02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:31,726
but as those for whom
they would give their blood.

1891
02:01:33,087 --> 02:01:36,606
It is in that spirit
that we offer this heartfelt toast

1892
02:01:37,167 --> 02:01:39,171
to the brides and grooms.

1893
02:01:40,487 --> 02:01:42,290
The brides and grooms.

1894
02:02:21,969 --> 02:02:24,088
We are going to live
in the old house again.

1895
02:02:25,568 --> 02:02:28,004
And we will walk and
sit here every day,

1896
02:02:28,728 --> 02:02:30,646
soon, I hope,
with our children.

1897
02:02:33,248 --> 02:02:35,166
We will always
be with you,

1898
02:02:35,929 --> 02:02:38,691
and you with us,
dearest father...

1899
02:02:40,808 --> 02:02:42,208
And cousin.
