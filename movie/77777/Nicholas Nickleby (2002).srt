00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,548
What happens when the light first pierces…

3
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,649
the dark dampness
in which we have waited?

4
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,161
We are slapped and cut loose,

5
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:48,660
If we are lucky,
someone is there to catch us…

6
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,565
and persuade us that we are safe,

7
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,399
But are we safe?

8
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,202
What happens if, too early,
we lose a parent?

9
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,041
That party on whom we rely
for only everything?

10
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,548
Why, we are cut loose again…

11
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,283
and we wonder, even dread…

12
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,759
whose hands will catch us now,

13
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,868
There once lived a man
named Nicholas Nickleby,

14
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,500
Unambitious in business…

15
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,598
he devoted himself
to the happiness of his family,

16
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,139
But he is not the Nicholas Nickleby
you have come to hear about,

17
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,543
That Nicholas Nickleby is here,

18
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,247
And here,

19
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,220
And here,

20
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,685
-Said your prayers?
-Y es.

21
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,194
I prayed that I should have this day...

22
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,425
the same day we had today,
all the rest of my Iife.

23
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,167
But someday you will find someone
who will have...

24
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,132
a greater hold on your affections than I do.

25
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,201
The most important journey of your Iife...

26
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,574
will be to find her.

27
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,571
Nicholas had a younger sister, Kate,

28
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,010
Here she is again,

29
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,080
And here,

30
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,416
Goodness, how it goes,

31
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,515
For their father,
these children were a divine burden,

32
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,052
Never had money meant less to him…

33
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,959
and never had he needed it more,

34
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,829
His wife said:

35
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:29,994
Speculate.

36
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,098
Since it was well known
that Mr, Nickleby's brother, Ralph…

37
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,766
many years his senior…

38
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,107
had made his fortune in London
by just this method…

39
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,244
so Nicholas Nickleby,
who had never speculated…

40
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,875
speculated,

41
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,185
It is a particular sort of triumph…

42
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,521
that bankers
have made the word "speculation"…

43
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,720
synonymous with "adventure"…

44
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,425
when, indeed, it means only
that one may gain a great deal…

45
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,759
or one may lose a great deal,

46
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,368
Alas, for Mr, Nickleby, it meant the latter,

47
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,732
Four stockbrokers
took villa residences in Italy…

48
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,642
and 400 nobodies were ruined,

49
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,346
Eliminating all he had saved…

50
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,079
as well as any wish to earn it again…

51
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,581
Mr, Nickleby took to his bed…

52
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:26,585
until he surrendered
to the one certainty of life…

53
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,627
which no amount of speculation
can prevent,

54
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,163
What shall we do?

55
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,769
Here is Nicholas Nickleby again,

56
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,783
19 years old…

57
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,220
and head of his family,

58
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,702
Come here.

59
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,945
Said he would join me at the tavern.

60
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,878
Turnips and carrots!

61
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,678
Mind your back, miss.

62
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,224
PIease, Mr. Nickleby, do you wish my father
to go to debtor's prison?

63
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,591
Where your father sleeps, Miss Bray,
is of no concern to me.

64
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,163
Father tells me the interest
is what makes the debt so unmanageable.

65
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,097
-Could you not stop it?
-Tell him...

66
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,228
to repay the Ioan.
That will stop the interest right away.

67
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,054
You must bear up against sorrow, ma'am.

68
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,459
I always do.

69
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,496
Mine was no common Ioss.

70
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,361
It was no uncommon Ioss.

71
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,661
Husbands die every day.

72
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,165
And wives.

73
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,936
Brothers also.

74
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,206
Yes, and puppies, too.

75
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,402
Ma'am, you did not mention
what my brother's complaint was.

76
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,083
We feel he died of a broken heart.

77
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,178
Pooh, there's no such thing.

78
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,382
Indeed, if you have no heart to break.

79
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,588
In your Ietter, you said
the creditors had administered...

80
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,389
and nothing was Ieft for you?

81
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,395
We tried to sell the house...

82
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,190
but no one seemed to want
a Iittle home Iike ours.

83
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,633
So you spent what Iittle remained
coming all the way to London...

84
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,001
to see what I could do for you?

85
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,264
It was your brother's dying wish...

86
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,841
that you might do something
for his children.

87
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,641
How is it, when a man dies
without property of his own...

88
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,978
he thinks he has the right
to dispose of others'?

89
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,608
What a feckless, inconsiderate man.

90
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,654
Our father, your brother, had a noble heart.

91
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,546
Which beats no more.

92
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,351
You, girl...

93
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,558
you haven't been brought up
too delicately...

94
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,359
to apprentice at some boarding school,
have you?

95
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,400
Uncle...

96
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,437
I will try to do anything
to gain me a home and bread.

97
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,939
Now that I think of it, I know a dressmaker
who may have some work.

98
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,178
You, boy, have you ever done anything?

99
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,241
No.

100
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,053
Noggs, where's the morning paper
I Ieft on my desk?

101
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,951
-On my desk.
-Bring it to me.

102
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,684
"Bring it to me."

103
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,120
Stop parroting me.

104
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,786
I wish I was a parrot. I'd fly away.

105
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,127
I wish you were a parrot, too.
I'd wring your neck.

106
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,361
-Read that.
-What is it, Nicholas?

107
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,329
An advertisement.

108
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,207
"Education at
Mr. Wackford Squeers' Academy."

109
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,540
Oh, no.

110
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,282
"Dotheboys Hall, at the delightful village
of Dotheboys, in Yorkshire.

111
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,812
"Youth are clothed, boarded and booked...

112
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,287
"instructed in all Ianguages,
Iiving and dead...

113
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,883
"mathematics, orthography,
the use of globes and single stick.

114
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,758
"Diet unparalleled.
An able assistant wanted.

115
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,155
"Annual salary ￡5.

116
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,463
"Master of Arts preferred."

117
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,331
I'm not a Master of Arts.

118
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,733
That can be got over, I believe.

119
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,776
But it is such a Iong way off.

120
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:15,178
If I am fortunate enough to be appointed,
what will become of those I Ieave behind?

121
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,682
It will be my immediate care
to place your mother and sister...

122
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,050
in some sphere of Iife
in which they may become independent.

123
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,224
I will not forget what you have done
for me this day, Uncle.

124
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,425
Nor shall I.

125
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,302
Any chimneys to sweep?

126
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,475
There he is. He's the man with one eye.

127
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,612
Though the popular prejudice
runs in favor of two.

128
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,474
-Is this one inch milk and the rest water?
-Aye, sir.

129
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,944
Here's richness.

130
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,591
When I say "one," you may take a drink.

131
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,353
When I say "number two,"
the boy next to you may take it...

132
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,760
and so on, till all five boys
have been nourished.

133
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,358
But work fast.
We Ieave when the coach horn blows.

134
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,799
Number one.

135
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,630
Number two.

136
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,033
Number three.

137
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,540
Number four.

138
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,242
Number five.

139
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,647
Out you go.

140
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:26,643
Subdue your appetites,
and you've conquered human nature.

141
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,949
Yorkshire coach Ieaves in five minutes!

142
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,282
Wait by the coach in a straight Iine.

143
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,720
Squeers, this is the boy I told you about.
My nephew.

144
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,991
I am most grateful for the opportunity
to serve, sir.

145
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,133
-Mr. Squeers.
-Mrs. Shaygar.

146
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,432
Could you give those to Henry?
Tuesday is his birthday.

147
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:48,099
Delighted, my dear.
The boy's happiness is our prime concern.

148
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,642
Three inside, two Iittle ones up top.

149
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,275
Get up behind. If a boy drops off the back,
that's ￡20 a year Iost.

150
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,345
If he is the schoolmaster,
what kind of school can it be?

151
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,755
I hardly know.

152
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,888
BIess you both.

153
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,758
Goodbye.

154
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,099
Someday, we will once again
share the protection of the same roof...

155
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,371
and revive the happiness denied to us now.

156
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,341
I promise.

157
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,952
Young man.

158
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,724
Forgive me. I know the world.

159
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,821
Your father didn't...

160
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,954
or he wouldn't have done me a kindness
without hope of a return.

161
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,625
You don't, or you wouldn't be bound
on such a journey.

162
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,671
If ever you should need help
or shelter in London....

163
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,874
Oh, dear. I once thought I never should.

164
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,946
They know where I Iive,
at the Sign of the Crown in Golden Square.

165
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,839
You can come at night.

166
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,946
-Once, nobody was ashamed.
-Ashamed?

167
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,378
Where are you, Nickleby? Up.

168
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:13,616
If you should go near Barnard Castle,
there's good ale at the King's Head.

169
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,423
Say you know me,
and I'm sure they won't charge you for it.

170
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,724
And...

171
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,365
you may say "Mr. Noggs" there...

172
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,227
for I was a gentleman then.

173
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,560
I was.

174
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,841
-Walk on.
-Goodbye, Nicholas.

175
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,536
Whoa!

176
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,177
Smike!

177
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,761
Is this Dotheboys Hall?

178
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,329
No need to call it a hall up here.

179
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,835
We call it that in London,
because it sounds better.

180
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,370
Hurry, Iad!

181
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,386
Where the devil were you?

182
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,092
PIease, sir...

183
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,994
I fell asleep over the fire.

184
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,498
Missus said I might go in there for a warm.

185
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,700
You'd have been a deuced deal
more wakeful out in the cold.

186
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,903
Is that my Squeery?

187
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,347
The crime of my dead eye, my Iove...

188
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,946
is that I can't see you twice.

189
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,687
-How's the pig?
-Just as you Ieft her.

190
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:27,815
And the boys?

191
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,327
Young Braithwaite's had a fever.

192
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,524
Third time this year.

193
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,460
I say it's obstinacy,
and we beat it out of him.

194
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,496
No one can cure an illness
quicker than you, my Iove.

195
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,239
This is the new man, Mr. Nickleby.

196
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,712
-I hope you're not hungry.
-I am.

197
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,281
Of course you are.

198
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,319
I've got a nice hot stew
for you here, Squeery.

199
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,812
And there's bread on the table.

200
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,985
I brought the Ietters to the boys,
I'II read them in the morning.

201
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,928
-I'm doing the brimstone first.
-Of course you are.

202
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,701
Grand piece of meat in that, Squeery.
Put the heat back in you.

203
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,392
Aye, it will.

204
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,997
-How was your journey, my pet?
-Dreadful.

205
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,904
-Was it perishing?
-Torture.

206
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,172
What?

207
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,579
Have you....

208
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,745
Did anybody....

209
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,955
Has nothing been heard...

210
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,152
about me?

211
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,599
Not a word, and never will we.

212
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,669
But count your blessings.
You've been here all these years...

213
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,803
and not a penny paid after the first six.

214
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,407
No clue as to who you belong to,
and still I feed you.

215
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,277
That's cause for joy.

216
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,484
And here's more cause for joy.

217
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,721
Little Wackford.

218
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,887
Father!

219
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,065
Look what your pa brought you.

220
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,226
"Dear Kate…

221
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,600
"My first morning here began with the news
that the pump had frozen…

222
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,502
"but events soon distracted me, "

223
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,598
-Smike!
-Who are you after?

224
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:06,309
It's brimstone morning,
and I can't find the school spoon.

225
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,673
We purify the boys' blood
now and then, Nickleby.

226
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,307
Purify, fiddlesticks!

227
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,422
We give the boys brimstone and treacle,
Mr. Knuckleboy...

228
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,116
because if we didn't,
they'd always be ailing.

229
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,893
It spoils their appetites and comes cheaper
than breakfast and dinner.

230
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,756
You might say it does them good
and us good at the same time.

231
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,767
Smike!

232
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,631
-Where's the school spoon?
-PIease, ma'am.

233
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,302
PIease.

234
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,712
Don't contradict your mistress.

235
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,450
Take it.

236
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,557
Take it. Be thankful.

237
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:58,420
A most invaluable woman that.
I don't know her equal.

238
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,823
Nor I.

239
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,763
-No, please!
-Take it.

240
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,729
And thank me for it.

241
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,430
She does things for them boys...

242
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,235
that I don't believe half the mothers going
would do for their own sons.

243
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,342
-I should think they would not, sir.
-No.

244
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,913
"Mr, Squeers' return from London
is a great event…

245
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,242
"as he brings the boys news from home, "

246
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,909
Bolder, come here.

247
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,422
No Ietters.

248
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,860
But I saw your father in London.

249
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,726
He was ￡2.1 0 short in his payments.

250
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,322
One...

251
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,899
two, three...

252
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,635
-four--
-Five, six.

253
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,063
But the good news is, we'II keep you on.
Smike, take him out.

254
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,535
Letter for Cobbey. Stand up.

255
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,842
Your grandmother's dead.

256
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,480
Your uncle's took to drink.

257
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,055
That's all the news your sister sends,
except for eight pence...

258
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,991
which will just cover the square of glass
you broke Iast week.

259
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,560
"After this, classes began, "

260
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,157
Where's Graymarsh?

261
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,731
PIease, sir, he's cleaning
the back parlor window.

262
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,257
Perfect. C-L-E-A-N, "clean."

263
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,427
Verb, active, "to make bright."

264
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,129
"Winder," a casement.

265
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,437
"Win": W-I-N, "der": D-E-R.

266
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,205
When the boy knows this,
he goes and does it.

267
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,405
Where's Dorn?

268
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,449
-PIease, sir, he's weeding the garden.
-To be sure.

269
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:29,277
"Bot": B-O-T, "tin": T-I-N, "ney": N-E-Y.

270
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,049
"Bottiney." Noun, substantive.

271
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,491
Knowledge of plants,
which he's applying right now.

272
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,155
That's our system, Nickleby.
What do you think of it?

273
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,231
It's useful.

274
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,594
"And so went the day,

275
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,333
"I very much hope I can be of service here, "

276
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,683
Are you cold?

277
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,550
You're shivering, poor fellow.

278
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,253
There.

279
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,961
Oh, dear, my heart.

280
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,369
I feel Iost here, too.

281
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,068
But we must always hope.

282
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,172
Hope?

283
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,316
Do you remember the boy who died here?

284
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,386
I was not here.

285
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,221
What of him?

286
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,592
I was with him that night.

287
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,763
He began to see faces around his bed
that came from home.

288
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,102
He said they smiled and talked to him.

289
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,939
At Iast, he died...

290
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,518
Iifting his head to kiss them.

291
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,149
Yes?

292
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,564
What faces will smile on me when I die?

293
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,397
Who will comfort me that Iong night?

294
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,638
They cannot come from home.

295
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,277
They would frighten me if they did,
for I shouldn't know them.

296
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,150
There is no hope.

297
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:45,446
-No hope for me at all!
-What's the matter, Iove?

298
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,355
Tilda's getting married to John Browdie.

299
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,554
I'II be the only girl in the county
who hasn't posted my banns.

300
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,792
John Browdie's no catch. I hate him.

301
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,425
Eat your breakfast.

302
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,732
I'II never eat again.

303
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,203
How do you Iike Mr. Knuckleboy?

304
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,768
I hate him, that's how I Iike him.

305
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,209
He's a nasty, stuck-up monkey.

306
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,274
He needs his pride brought down.

307
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,950
I'II Ieave that to you, my Iove.
There's not a woman in all England...

308
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,954
can bring a person's pride down
quicker than you can.

309
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,582
Thank you, Squeery.

310
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,155
Who's Mr. Knuckleboy?

311
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,695
The new teacher.

312
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,167
A smile Iike a sugar-drop,
and the straightest Iegs I've ever seen.

313
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,665
The word for "window"...

314
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,972
-is "fenêtre", F-E-N-E--
-Oh, father.

315
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,973
I beg your pardon.
I thought my father was here.

316
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,452
-I'm so foolish, I'm sure.
-Not at all.

317
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,523
Again, the word for "window" is "fenêtre."

318
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:57,028
I'm sure I am foolish.

319
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,863
It's just my pen is in need of...

320
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,069
mending.

321
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,235
May I be of service?

322
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,336
No, I just couldn't.

323
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,240
AII right.

324
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,582
Tilda!

325
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,888
-What is it, Fanny?
-I am engaged!

326
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:31,955
To whom?

327
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,399
-To the new schoolteacher.
-The speed of it!

328
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,963
What's he said?

329
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:42,136
We don't need Ianguage.
If you could have only seen his Iooks.

330
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,107
Did he Iook at you Iike this?

331
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:49,006
If he did, you're engaged.
That's how John Iooked at me.

332
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,844
Hope it was better than that.
Thee'd have run to the hills.

333
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,249
Hush, John! So, when is the day?

334
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,818
We just need a final declaration to settle it...

335
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,516
but he's shy in the way of words.

336
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,118
Fanny, I'm so happy for you.

337
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,839
Have you read The Pilgrim's Progress?

338
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,847
" The Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan.

339
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:35,346
"As I walked through the wilderness
of this world, I Iighted on a certain"--

340
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,888
What do you think you're doing?

341
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,156
Get on with your work!

342
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,662
Don't give me that high-and-mighty Iook.

343
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,858
He don't pay.

344
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,065
Therefore, he works.

345
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:04,941
Ladies.

346
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:13,281
Quick, I must do something
to engage his sympathy...

347
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:16,020
and bring him to the declaration.
Should I choke?

348
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:19,063
I think fainting might be more romantic
than choking.

349
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,835
Mr. Nickleby, help!

350
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,837
-What's happened?
-I think she was undone by your coldness.

351
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,846
Was I abrupt?
My mind, I'm afraid, was on other matters.

352
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,506
I'm sure it wasn't deliberate.

353
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:42,585
It's just that with all the feelings
so nearly expressed between you of Iate....

354
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,961
If I caused any distress,
I reproach myself most bitterly, but....

355
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,695
This is most awkward, but...

356
00:28:55,701 --> 00:29:00,104
-does your friend think I'm in Iove with her?
-Does she think so? Of course.

357
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,665
But I've made no such declaration.

358
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,466
Your eyes said what your mouth could not.

359
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,971
Perhaps my mouth should say
what my eyes have not.

360
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,178
I have scarcely seen the young Iady
three times...

361
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:16,278
but should I have seen her 30 or 30,000,
it would be the same.

362
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,651
I have not one thought,
hope or wish connected with her...

363
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,790
unless it be part of the picture
I keep in my mind...

364
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,352
of one day being able to turn my back
upon this accursed place...

365
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:30,832
and never to think of it again
with any feeling but Ioathing and disgust.

366
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,669
Refused by a teacher...

367
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,076
picked up by an advertisement.

368
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,801
He's insulted not just you,
but the whole house of Squeers.

369
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,207
He's proud. I said so from the start.

370
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,776
He must be wounded.

371
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,084
I hate him Iike poison!

372
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,817
Where is Smike? We need wood.

373
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,758
He's with Mr. Nickleby.
He waits on him hand and foot.

374
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,430
He must not have enough to do.

375
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,532
We must think of how better
to occupy our Smike,

376
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,992
They are so hard on me,

377
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,025
But for you...

378
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,222
they would kill me.

379
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,897
I fear they may be killing you because of me.

380
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,470
You will do better when I am gone.

381
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,812
Gone?

382
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,212
Are you going?

383
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,380
I would go tomorrow if I could.

384
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,317
Tell me...

385
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,359
is the world as bad as this place?

386
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,655
Oh, no.

387
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,554
Should I ever meet you there?

388
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,858
-Why, yes, I'm sure at some--
-No.

389
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,832
Tell me.

390
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,896
Tell me that I should be sure to find you.

391
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:20,939
You would.

392
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:25,047
And I would help you and aid you...

393
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,110
and not bring fresh sorrow on you,
as I have done here.

394
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,023
He is not here, sir!

395
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,303
Show yourself!

396
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,512
Who knows where he is?

397
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,348
PIease, sir, I think he's run away.

398
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,256
And what possible reason
would any boy have...

399
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,759
to run away from my establishment?

400
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,763
Do you think he's run away?

401
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,229
I hope so!

402
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:15,726
Squeery...

403
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,000
we best go find him.

404
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,207
But if you Iift one finger...

405
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,584
to stop what's about to begin...

406
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:40,190
you and I will fall out in a way...

407
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,252
that will spoil your beauty.

408
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:55,132
Take pattern by Smike if you dare, boys!

409
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,507
You'II see what he'II get for hisself
when he's brought back.

410
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,041
For brought back he will be.

411
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,881
You go the north way, Squeery,
I'II take the west.

412
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,558
Mr. Squeers!

413
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,563
PIease!

414
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:23,097
I beg you, forgive the boy!
He is not in his right mind.

415
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,728
That will soon be the Ieast of his problems.

416
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,276
Father, please don't Iet them find him.

417
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,148
If they do, Iet him be dead...

418
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,306
his Iast breath a free one.

419
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,841
Does he have him? Is it Smike?

420
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,135
Is she back with him?

421
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,805
Then you do not have him.

422
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,538
Thank God.

423
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,494
Squeery!

424
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,970
We have him!

425
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,639
Is every boy here?

426
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,946
Get back!

427
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,611
And you.

428
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,227
Have you anything to say?

429
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,169
PIease, sir, spare me.

430
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,140
I'II spare you.

431
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,072
I'II flog you to within an inch of your Iife,
and I'II spare you then.

432
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,982
Stop!

433
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,027
This must not go on.

434
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,825
I will not allow it.

435
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,501
You dare to challenge my authority!

436
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,068
Stay back!

437
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,778
Touch him at your peril!

438
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,613
I will not stand by and see it done.

439
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,412
You will do as you're told!

440
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:04,147
If you raise the devil within me, the
consequences shall fall on your own head!

441
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,189
Once I begin, God help you!

442
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:12,889
Stop!

443
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,960
No, please, wait!

444
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,877
I do not know why,
but I am going to show you...

445
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,642
what you have never shown any boy
in this room.

446
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,343
Pity.

447
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,492
Wait. I say, wait!

448
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,530
I've come from the schoolhouse.

449
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,369
Mr. Squeers says he was attacked.
Beaten, and nearly senseless.

450
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,376
When he said it was thee who did it,
I knew thee must not be allowed to Ieave...

451
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,968
We will not be stopped!

452
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,777
...without my shaking your hand,
and saying to thee, "Job well done."

453
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,943
Give us thee hand, will you?

454
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,220
Whoever heard the Iike of it?

455
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,288
I only wish...

456
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,225
I could've been there to see it myself.

457
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,863
What do thee mean to do now?

458
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,234
-I don't know.
-How much cash has thee got?

459
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,537
-Not much. But I'II find--
-Take what you need.

460
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,335
-I could not.
-PIease.

461
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,678
Every boy in that room
would add to it if he could.

462
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,115
Thank you.

463
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,247
Here, and take this bit of timber, too,
to help thee on.

464
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,983
You keep a good heart.

465
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,618
God bless thee!

466
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,160
Beating the schoolmaster!

467
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,259
God, it's the best thing
I've heard in 20 years.

468
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:45,810
Tomorrow...

469
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,543
where will you go?

470
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,944
Perhaps to Liverpool.

471
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,853
I could find work on a ship.

472
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,029
Do not be anxious.

473
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,831
Before I do anything,
I will get you to your home.

474
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,628
Where is it?

475
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,774
You are my home.

476
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,205
Smike!

477
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,108
PIease, may I go with you to the sea?

478
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,575
I will be your faithful,
hard-working servant. I will.

479
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,417
I promise I will.

480
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,219
I want only to be near you.

481
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,992
The word which separates us
shall never be said by me.

482
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,565
And I promise you, from this night forward...

483
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,166
the world shall deal by you as it does by me.

484
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,249
Do you have a family...

485
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,249
or are you alone, as I am?

486
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,757
I have a mother and a sister.

487
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,657
Dear God!

488
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,295
If he has sent me here,
what has he done to Kate?

489
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,200
I'm grateful that you came.

490
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,260
It is a boon to a single man...

491
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:16,398
to have such a Iady as yourself
for my hostess.

492
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,304
I know Iittle of how these things
are done in London.

493
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,744
Surely one of the other Iadies
would be more adept.

494
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,315
You are the only Iady present.

495
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,749
By the time I was finished,
she couldn't escape.

496
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,563
Have you thought about the investment
I brought you?

497
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,926
It has its merits and its risks.

498
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,105
You know, Nickleby, I've noticed
you never seem to touch your wine...

499
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,867
while we drink and drink.

500
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,966
I Iike to keep a clear head.

501
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,839
Yet you pour us so much.

502
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,914
I must say, it is a pleasure
having your niece with us.

503
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:00,382
He must have designed that, too,
to soften you into speculating.

504
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,045
If I could see someone
as winning as Miss Nickleby...

505
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,054
when I talk business with her uncle...

506
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,886
I can think of no other place
I'd rather talk business.

507
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,653
No other place on Earth.

508
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,956
Hear, hear!

509
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,558
Gentlemen, I feel
we are boring Miss Nickleby.

510
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,332
Look, she can barely raise her eyes.

511
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:26,833
The poor dear girl simply cannot understand
why no one here is making Iove to her.

512
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,747
She gasps! I have uncovered her secret.

513
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,146
You misunderstand me.

514
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,584
In fact, I'II hold any man ￡50...

515
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:41,351
that Miss Nickleby can't Iook in my face
and tell me that she wasn't thinking so.

516
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,460
Done!

517
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,960
Pray, do not make me the subject of bets.

518
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,424
Uncle, please!

519
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,301
Why not, if the gentlemen insist?

520
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,194
It's a minute's work.

521
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:59,972
Just Iift your eyes and tell me that
you're not hoping I would make Iove to you.

522
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,738
Get your money ready, gentlemen.

523
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:10,447
She's not going to say it,
because she wants me to make Iove to her.

524
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,156
Can you, girl?

525
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:18,059
Can you say that you don't wish me
to make Iove to you?

526
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,016
Hush, my dear.

527
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,524
Don't mind it, now.

528
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,662
Then Iet me go.

529
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,464
Let me Ieave this place.

530
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,662
You must dry your eyes first.

531
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,405
Let me raise your head.

532
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:16,412
There.

533
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,797
Uncle...

534
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,957
what have I done
that you should subject me to this?

535
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,667
I didn't know it would be so.

536
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,922
Can you remember
when you first came to Mr. Squeers'?

537
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,662
Surely you did not
find your way there alone?

538
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,228
I could not have.

539
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,592
I was brought by a small, withered man.

540
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,301
I was afraid of him.

541
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,729
But then they made me more afraid of them.

542
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,680
Tremendous. Positively tremendous.

543
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,952
That'II be a double encore
if you take care, boys!

544
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,559
Don't you concur?
Was that not the very picture of excitement?

545
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,428
It was very good.

546
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,858
-AIthough--
-AIthough?

547
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:41,333
They might be better matched
in terms of size.

548
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,631
How are you to get up the sympathies
of the audience...

549
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,439
if there isn't a Iittle man
contending against a bigger one?

550
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:50,774
I confess, I had not considered that.

551
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,043
We have had a Iong day's walk
without much....

552
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,345
Without much?

553
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,651
Food.

554
00:45:58,022 --> 00:45:59,182
Dear me.

555
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:03,350
Let it never be said
that any man went hungry here or here...

556
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,361
when he was with Vincent Crummles.

557
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,556
Boys, set the table at once!

558
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,490
We shall adjourn to the dining room.

559
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:14,032
My friend and I
shall try for a berth on a ship.

560
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:20,276
Does no other profession suggest itself
to a young man of your figure and bearing?

561
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,570
-I think the sea offers a great many--
-What about the stage?

562
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:26,241
-The stage?
-The theatrical profession!

563
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:30,754
I am in the theatrical profession myself.
My wife is in the theatrical profession.

564
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,423
My children are in the theatrical profession.

565
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,152
I had a dog that Iived and died in it...

566
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,262
and the pony that pulled us here today
is third generation.

567
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,299
His mother could fire a pistol...

568
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,528
and get in bed wearing a nightcap.

569
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:46,703
But...

570
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,606
there is tragedy in the family.

571
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:53,539
-In the pony's family?
-Yes.

572
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,479
The father drank.

573
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,173
Ended up in the circus...

574
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,116
drinking port wine with the clowns.

575
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,956
Got greedy, couldn't quit...

576
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,049
and choked on the bottle.

577
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:15,259
At any rate, I'd Iove
to bring you and your friend out.

578
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,233
He has a capital countenance!

579
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,962
Why, as he is now...

580
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,435
he would make such an apothecary
in Romeo and Juliet...

581
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,304
that he would be certain
of three rounds of applause...

582
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:28,368
the minute he put his face
out of the practicable door!

583
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,346
-And you!
-Me?

584
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,511
-You were born for the Iamps!
-No, sir, I think--

585
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,918
You could be useful in a hundred ways.
You could write plays!

586
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:42,285
I dare say, I could scribble something,
now and then.

587
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:46,419
Whatever you write, please include a pump
and two washing tubs.

588
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:48,464
I just bought them at a sale.

589
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,799
Could I Iive by such a trade?

590
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:55,268
Like a prince!
With your own salary, and your friend's...

591
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:59,100
and your writing, you could make ￡1 a week!

592
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,134
With a good run of houses, double that.

593
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,872
Then I accept, and happily!

594
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,182
Arise, young man.

595
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,914
You've been transformed!

596
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,381
You went to sleep a wretch...

597
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,483
you awake an actor!

598
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:28,037
-Mrs. C, could I have a word?
-What is it now, Mr. Folair?

599
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,629
About my roar.

600
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:34,077
There are two options available to you.
A rugged--

601
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:35,407
My dear.

602
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,350
I've made another discovery.

603
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:45,178
Messieurs Nickleby and Smike,
may I present Mrs. Crummles.

604
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,856
Welcome to our family of players!

605
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:52,951
We were just about to rehearse
the climax of our drama.

606
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,997
Will you watch with us...

607
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,496
and feel with us?

608
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:02,706
Ladies and gentlemen, places, please.

609
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:08,033
I must warn you,
Folair has been hopeless today!

610
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,784
PIay the terror, but don't Iose the joy!

611
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:22,882
Your trap!

612
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,459
Mr. Folair, shut your trap!

613
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,229
Somebody forgot his spear.

614
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:39,001
The flames! And remember, they're hot!

615
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,142
Oh, dear, it's almost too real!

616
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,005
Remember, Mr. Folair, you are a savage...

617
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,084
not a demented fairy!

618
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,551
Don't Iose your theatricality!

619
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,216
Ninetta, dear, would you move
that flower to your other hand?

620
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,294
Mr. Folair, there's a problem with your head!

621
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,396
Perfect!

622
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:03,934
Bravo!

623
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,527
Thrilling in the extreme!

624
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,697
Gentlemen...

625
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,964
this is Miss Ninetta Crummles...

626
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,905
the Infant Phenomenon.

627
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:14,839
How old is she?

628
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,942
She is 10 years of age, sir.

629
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,408
Not more?

630
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:26,948
Not a day.

631
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,583
-My dear?
-Yes?

632
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,093
It is of the utmost that I speak to you
about a great struggle...

633
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:36,791
which is taking place outside
this mortal temple we call the theater.

634
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,063
The contestants are
those aged combatants...

635
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,428
art...

636
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:43,736
and commerce.

637
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,108
And art, it would appear from the receipts...

638
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,044
is in its usual position of jeopardy.

639
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,973
Might you and I have a word, à deux?

640
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:55,847
Excusez-moi,

641
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:05,158
"Infant Phenomenon!"
"Infant humbug" is more to the point!

642
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,960
She has been 10 for the past 8 years!

643
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:13,200
They keep her on a diet of gin and water
to hold back her growth.

644
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,864
-You don't say!
-I do say, sir. I do!

645
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:20,004
That hammy sprawler keeps the rest of us
from doing our specialties.

646
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,478
Mine is the Highland FIing.

647
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,372
Would you Iike to see it?

648
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:28,118
PIease.

649
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,820
Ladies and gentlemen...

650
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,362
based on the receipts
Mrs. Crummles has shown me...

651
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,931
Liverpool has Iittle relish...

652
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:46,934
for high-minded theatrical entertainments
properly conducted.

653
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,436
We must give them our pity.

654
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,305
Now, we must give them something
they will pay to see.

655
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,405
Romeo and Juliet.

656
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:02,714
But we have no Romeo.
Mr. Leadville's Ieg is broke.

657
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,487
I don't mind! I can manage!

658
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,754
OId friend...

659
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:14,197
it may be time
for you to move on from Romeo.

660
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:15,956
Move on?

661
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,760
To what?

662
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,328
Lear?

663
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,971
Mr. Nickleby will take that part.

664
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:28,034
And do you not think his friend
would make a smashing apothecary?

665
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,845
His face practically erupts with drama!

666
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,445
What an acquisition!

667
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,781
These speeches! Listen to this.

668
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,091
"Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand...

669
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,529
"that I might touch that cheek."

670
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,067
Are you worried
about how to memorize so much?

671
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:53,695
I am, and I have barely a word to say!

672
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,361
It is not only that...

673
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:58,875
but a desire to know someone
to whom I could say such things.

674
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,270
My father told me that the great journey
of my Iife would be to find such a person...

675
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:08,676
but I'm nearly 20 years of age,
and I fear he may be wrong.

676
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:13,413
-I hope not.
-I hope not, too.

677
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:22,030
May I ask you why you were so upset seeing
that savage come through the trapdoor?

678
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,869
You asked me yesterday if I had a memory
about my Iife before Yorkshire.

679
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,500
There is but one thing I remember.

680
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,968
It was the room in which I was kept.

681
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,844
It was a lonesome room
at the top of a house,

682
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:42,416
There was a large black hook
that hung down from the ceiling,

683
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,952
Underneath it was a trapdoor,

684
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,390
I was so afraid of what might be
on the other side...

685
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:55,363
that there was not a single night
I did not cover my head in the bedclothes.

686
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,029
So today, when a door so very Iike it
opened in the dark before me...

687
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:04,604
I could not watch what came out of it.

688
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:07,041
Carry on.

689
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:16,448
We have fallen on strange times.

690
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:17,946
Yes...

691
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:20,416
but wondrous strange.

692
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,571
-What's come then?
-I have.

693
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,138
-What else?
-A Ietter, marked:

694
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,741
"Urgent, as well as extremely important."

695
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,613
It's from the Squeers.

696
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,352
Wackford?

697
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,784
Doubtful. It's perfumed.

698
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,586
"Dear Mr. Knuckleboy, sir.

699
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,659
"My pa requests me to write to you.

700
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:05,167
"The doctor's considering it doubtful...

701
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,136
"whether he will ever recover
the use of his Iegs...

702
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,365
"which prevents his holding a pen.

703
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,732
"He was brought to this state
by your nephew...

704
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,404
"who jumped upon my pa's body
with his feet...

705
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,208
"and dashed him to the earth."

706
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,876
"Dashed him to the earth."
Very nice, my dear!

707
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,645
"He also attacked him with Ianguage...

708
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,951
"which I will not pollute my pen
with describing.

709
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,350
"He assaulted my ma...

710
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:33,554
"by driving her back-comb several inches
into her head.

711
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:38,459
"We have a medical certificate that says,
if the comb had entered her skull...

712
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:41,594
"the tortoiseshell
might have affected her brain.

713
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:45,070
"The monster then ran away…

714
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:47,872
"taking with him a boy
of desperate character...

715
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,845
"as well as a garnet ring
belonging to my nearly dead ma.

716
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:55,717
"Would you please send us money
compensating for its Ioss...

717
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,913
"in the amount of 22--"

718
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,181
-4.
-8.

719
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,090
"￡28.10.

720
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,361
"Remain yours, etc., Fanny Squeers."

721
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,157
The boy has crossed me.

722
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:12,633
-I did not expect otherwise.
-He's written as well.

723
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,197
Pride, obstinacy.

724
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,338
A reputation for fine feelings
are all against it.

725
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,771
He's gone to Liverpool.

726
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:25,239
Taken some employment.

727
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,450
Otherwise it's all excuses.

728
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:32,185
I predict he soon will be on some ship.

729
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:34,549
Gone.

730
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,727
Forever.

731
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:48,104
Child...

732
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:52,674
forgive me. I have been remiss
in my attentions to you and your mother.

733
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,244
I came to enquire whether you and she
would accompany me to the theater...

734
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:58,747
on Friday evening?

735
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:01,183
That is most kind of you, Uncle.

736
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:02,883
Very well.

737
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,786
I shall call for you.

738
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,328
She has accepted.

739
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,075
I have a genuine interest in Shakespeare...

740
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:34,345
especially after having been
to that dear Iittle dull house he was born in.

741
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,446
How fascinating. May I?

742
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,885
Nickleby? Is that you?

743
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,754
Nickleby, are you all alone?

744
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:44,553
What Iuck!

745
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,458
The drama begins.

746
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,065
Her eyes in heaven...

747
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,908
would through the airy region
stream so bright...

748
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,704
that birds would sing,
and think it were not night.

749
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,820
See how she Ieans her cheek
upon her hand.

750
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:14,086
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand...

751
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,159
that I might touch that cheek!

752
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:18,591
Ay, me!

753
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,988
I should Iike to be your glove...

754
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:23,698
as much to touch your cheek...

755
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:25,894
as to grip your fingers.

756
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:28,597
Bravo!

757
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:34,837
-Don't hurry.
-PIease do not detain me.

758
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,744
Now, why do you keep up
this show of displeasure?

759
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:41,178
Show? Nothing could be more sincerely felt.

760
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,513
Indeed, you're prettier
when you are in a passion.

761
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:48,854
I wish my brother were here. He'd be in a
passion from which you'd not soon recover.

762
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,917
Linger with me just a moment
as they extinguish the Iights.

763
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:52,984
I will not.

764
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:56,658
-Will you deny me everything I want?
-If everything you want is wrong.

765
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,566
PIease, Iet me rejoin my family.
My mother will be anxious.

766
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:03,766
Your mother, child, is already anxious
that you should find a proper prospect.

767
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,866
I would hazard that she is delighted
we are by ourselves...

768
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:10,572
and I imagine the Ionger we are gone,
the Iess anxious she will be.

769
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,979
Do not mock me.
You do not consider me a prospect...

770
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,644
but a plaything, and I consider you neither.

771
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:20,915
To treat me this way in a public place
could ruin my reputation.

772
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,418
And every chance for a decent
and Ioving marriage will be gone.

773
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:29,488
If it's privacy you want, Iet me give it to you.
But I'II have what I want and wait no more.

774
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,103
I have a genuine interest in Shakespeare.

775
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,808
Mother, may we go?

776
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,772
It was delightful to see you.

777
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,381
-Mother, please.
-Is something wrong?

778
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:52,783
Uncle...

779
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,584
I have been wounded past all healing...

780
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:00,225
and by your friends.

781
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,697
What can you mean? I have no friends.

782
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:07,060
If they are not your friends, then more
shame on you for bringing me among them.

783
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:10,072
I see you have
some of the boy's blood in you.

784
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,771
I hope I have.

785
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,135
I should be proud.

786
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,114
You know what happened under this roof.

787
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:24,847
Last night was far worse.

788
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,524
You have influence with these men.

789
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,288
One word from you would induce
them to desist.

790
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:36,026
What of it if an old man whispers
inanities in your ear on Monday?

791
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,431
Some other novelty
will spring up on Tuesday.

792
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:41,198
In the meantime, you must be practical.

793
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,100
The money that allows me
to help you and your mother...

794
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:47,166
in some portion comes from these men.

795
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,214
Uncle...

796
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,645
I am grateful
for all that you have done for us...

797
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,615
but do not mistake me.

798
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,081
I am not a toy.

799
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,827
I will Iive with dignity.

800
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,423
If that means...

801
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,559
that I must set up my mother
and myself on our own...

802
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,264
and hide myself from your friends...

803
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:17,798
I will do so...

804
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:22,608
knowing God will help us,
even if you will not.

805
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,354
If the boy drowns, or is Iost at sea...

806
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,124
this house could be hers.

807
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,395
How pretty she would make it.

808
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,604
Dear girl, here. Take this.

809
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,673
But I am not crying.

810
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,868
The handkerchief's for me.
The arm's for you.

811
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:58,942
To hear you speak so bravely
and not give way before him....

812
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:03,246
My admiration moves me to this.
Your brother, he'd be so proud.

813
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,423
That's right, yes. Give way now.

814
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,020
Noggs!

815
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:20,336
You're not alone. I'II see you soon.
And so shall someone else.

816
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,338
God bless you.

817
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,950
Again. "What ho! apothecary!"

818
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,056
It's no use. I can't remember it.

819
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,495
Smike, you can only fail by not trying.

820
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,264
"Who calls so Ioud?"

821
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:55,202
It is a crime that Mr. C has not found a spot
for my Highland FIing.

822
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,235
Romeo and Juliet
will not be the same without it.

823
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,036
"Who calls so Ioud?"

824
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,739
-May I tempt you with a humble offering?
-PIease.

825
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,816
The Iamps are Iit! Your public awaits!

826
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:11,878
Let us use our bodies Iike instruments...

827
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:16,254
and quiver together until music comes out!

828
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,992
You will be wonderful. Just relax.

829
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,961
Relax.

830
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,132
"Who calls so Ioud?"

831
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,206
If a man did need a poison...

832
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:41,317
here Iives a caitiff wretch
who would sell it to him.

833
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,112
What ho! apothecary!

834
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:55,561
What ho?

835
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,732
Who calls so Ioud?

836
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,406
Well done.

837
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,044
Mr. Nickleby?

838
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,153
-This just came.
-Thank you.

839
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,356
If it is an offer from a competing company...

840
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:59,520
I hope you honor it
with the respect it deserves...

841
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:00,855
none.

842
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:04,193
Newman says Kate is in some sort of peril.

843
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,731
He says we must come to London at once.

844
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:10,762
You Ieave us?
At the very moment of your triumph?

845
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:15,104
-I must, sir. It is a family drama.
-Those are always popular.

846
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,012
We shall miss you, Nicholas.

847
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,081
Very well, we'II have posters
out in the morning...

848
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:28,351
announcing positively
your Iast performance for tomorrow.

849
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,427
Then re-engagement
by popular demand for Friday.

850
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:36,325
And then, one absolutely
Iast-time-ever appearance...

851
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:38,525
on any stage, Saturday...

852
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:43,665
with the possibility
of a second show to follow.

853
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:48,099
No man has been more helpful
to me in my time of trouble than you...

854
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,614
but I must say that tonight
was my absolutely, positively...

855
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,649
final Iast performance.

856
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,719
There is an urgent family crisis.
I must be no Iess quick in responding to it...

857
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,348
than you would be if the Infant Phenomenon
herself were in danger.

858
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,895
There is only one response to that.

859
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,430
Farewell, my noble, Iion-hearted boy.

860
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,773
-We shall never forget you.
-Nor we you.

861
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,140
And have you anything to say, my boy?

862
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:25,613
Who calls so Ioud?

863
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:35,090
-Goodbye. Thank you.
-Farewell, dear friends.

864
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,191
Ladies and gentlemen...

865
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,718
if you found these goodbyes affecting...

866
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:45,324
you will Iove our production
of Romeo and Juliet...

867
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:49,632
miraculously recast
with that great Italian actor...

868
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:51,899
whose name shall be revealed...

869
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,736
only to ticket buyers
at tonight's performance...

870
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:58,971
but who promises,
in honor of the Iocal tastes...

871
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,312
to deftly insert into tonight's story...

872
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:05,550
the Highland FIing.

873
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,490
Mr. Noggs is in here?

874
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:21,097
He said for us to wait for him here.

875
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,796
Shall I get you something to eat?

876
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:27,399
-It may be some time before Newman arrives.
-Yes, please.

877
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,206
Not as much as Iittle Kate Nickleby!

878
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,684
Tell us again what she said
in Nickleby's box.

879
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,151
She said she wished
her brother were there...

880
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,384
as he would be in a passion
that I would not soon forget!

881
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:47,187
Didn't she also say something about,
"If you press yourself further...

882
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,460
"I shall Iose every hope
of a Ioving and decent marriage"?

883
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,194
I thought that was a bit much.

884
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,031
A word with you, sir.

885
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,801
Will you step apart with me?

886
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:04,771
I see no reason to step in any direction
until you state your name and business, sir.

887
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:09,508
My name is Nicholas Nickleby.
Miss Nickleby's brother.

888
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,116
I denounce you as a Iiar
and impeach you as a coward.

889
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,222
-You will tell me your name.
-Certainly not.

890
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,821
If there is a gentleman in this party...

891
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:23,297
he will acquaint me with the name
and residence of this man.

892
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,169
Someone answer me!

893
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:30,433
My sister's good name is at stake!

894
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,932
This dog is bothering me.

895
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:35,204
I am the son of a country gentleman...

896
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:37,346
your equal in education and birth...

897
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,416
and your superior, I trust,
in everything besides.

898
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:45,313
It is as much in his name as it is in my own,
that I demand you answer for your conduct.

899
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,719
Here is my answer, sir.

900
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,925
Now, gentlemen.

901
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,596
No!

902
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:02,435
Come near my sister again...

903
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:04,933
and I shall not be so forgiving.

904
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:12,846
The Exchange is now open for business.

905
01:09:38,808 --> 01:09:40,833
You are known to me now...

906
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,644
every suspicion viciously confirmed.

907
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,743
And you to me.

908
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,644
I? What wrong have I done?

909
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,687
Did you not attack the schoolmaster?

910
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:54,120
The monster was beating a crippled boy!

911
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,884
You choose to restore that boy?

912
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,587
No more than I would restore
a Iamb to a wolf.

913
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:03,188
Then your appearance here
to beg my help is in vain.

914
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,731
You mistake the point of this conference.

915
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:11,198
We knew no shame until we knew you...

916
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,935
and the degradations we have endured...

917
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:18,377
whether at Dotheboys Hall
or in the dark box of a theatre...

918
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,642
all trace their poisoned roots to you.

919
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:25,547
You did not want us when we came...

920
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:29,113
and it shamed me to seek help
from someone unwilling to give it.

921
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:34,092
Now our only shame is the blood
which binds our name to yours.

922
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:38,156
Therefore, your brother's widow
and her children renounce you!

923
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,696
May every recollection of your Iife cast
a terrifying darkness over your deathbed.

924
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:48,442
How soon that day may come,
I cannot know.

925
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:52,309
But I do know that in our Iife,
you Iive no more.

926
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,271
I disown him,

927
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:57,779
I would give good money
to have him stabbed...

928
01:10:57,854 --> 01:11:00,550
and rolled into the kennels
for the dogs to devour.

929
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:01,850
As would I.

930
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:05,449
But I am sure he's Ieft London
in fear of my retribution.

931
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:08,390
Oh, indeed, sir, he has not.

932
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:11,827
I saw him just now in the city...

933
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:14,493
boasting of his triumphal attack over you.

934
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:16,066
I don't believe it.

935
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:19,802
You were there Iast night, Lord Verisopht.
I wager you could believe it.

936
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,876
I'II tell you what I believe.

937
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:25,570
I believe you have
only yourself to blame, Hawk.

938
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,773
What?

939
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,316
If you had only told him who you were,
as he asked.

940
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,255
I was wrong, too, not to interfere.

941
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,415
I did not sleep the night, thinking about it.

942
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:38,756
Whatever mistakes were made,
were made by the boy.

943
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:43,062
I am his uncle,
and even I can see that he is no good.

944
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:46,128
He was defending the honor of his sister.

945
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:49,194
That is the very definition of goodness.

946
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:55,110
How can you not be proud of what
he's done in defense of your own niece?

947
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:57,304
You will be glad, my Lord, that I possess...

948
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,746
such an unsentimental view
when I am managing your investments.

949
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,717
Mr. Nickleby, I am no Ionger sure
I can make an investment with you.

950
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:13,158
-Because of my nephew?
-Because of your treatment of him!

951
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:15,727
And his sister!

952
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:20,035
When I think of her Ieaving
the theater that night...

953
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,167
I feel sick to recall it.

954
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:28,171
Surely there is another way for me
to expand my fortune...

955
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,711
than to enrich the tormentor...

956
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,915
of these children.

957
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,673
I see, from your eyes, you remember me.

958
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:06,243
If the change you see in me,
from so Iong ago, does not move you...

959
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:07,316
It does not.

960
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:11,546
...then Iet the knowledge that I am
as helpless and destitute as a child.

961
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:14,215
-Any man can earn his bread.
-How?

962
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:17,125
Would you show me the means?

963
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:19,218
I did, once.

964
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:21,457
Not again.

965
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:24,929
It's 20 years and 5 months
since you and I fell out.

966
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,460
Do you remember the cause?

967
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,366
You claimed part of the profits
of some of my business...

968
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,533
alleging that you had brought it to me.
When I refused you...

969
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:36,476
you threatened to reveal some....
What was it you said?

970
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,706
Hold I'd gained over you in your absence.

971
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,078
Rifling through my files, I suspect.

972
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:44,016
So I had you arrested
for an advance you had not repaid.

973
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,055
￡30. That's all I owed you.

974
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,723
Indeed, it was more.

975
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,120
There was the interest.

976
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:55,859
Seven years I have been gone,
under the most crushing conditions...

977
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:59,427
to return as you see me now,
ready to renew my offer...

978
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:02,471
but on terms much easier for you
than before.

979
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,806
You will want this information.
I want only to eat and drink.

980
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:09,742
Is that all?

981
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,440
It depends on you whether that's all or not.

982
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,345
Are you threatening now to tell others...

983
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:21,349
of whatever you Iearned
when you were my clerk?

984
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,253
To be plain with you, Mr. Brooker...

985
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,891
the world already knows
what sort of man I am...

986
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:31,799
and I do not grow poorer.

987
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:36,226
-You cannot stain a black coat.
-That's not what I meant.

988
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,001
Are those of your own name dear to you?
If they are--

989
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:40,099
They are not.

990
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:41,370
-But--
-But nothing.

991
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,808
If we meet again...

992
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:45,881
and you so much as notice me
with one begging gesture...

993
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,610
you shall see the inside of a jail once more.

994
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:53,647
That is my answer to your trash.

995
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:58,717
Mother...

996
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,287
this is Smike.

997
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:04,862
-How do you do, Mr. Pike?
-No, Mother, "Smike," with an "S."

998
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,827
-How do you do?
-Very well, thank you, Mr. Spike.

999
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:13,468
And this is our Iandlady, Miss Lacreevy.

1000
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:16,010
She is the artist
whose work fills these walls.

1001
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:19,411
I do hope you will Iet me make
a miniature of you.

1002
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:26,076
Kate, this is my faithful friend
and fellow traveler.

1003
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:28,680
I have been so eager...

1004
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:31,556
to thank you
for being such a comfort to Nicholas.

1005
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,697
He is my only friend.

1006
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,628
I would Iay down my Iife to help him.

1007
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,265
To a new beginning.

1008
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,238
-To new subjects.
-To an end of villains.

1009
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:51,711
To finding proper work as soon as I can.

1010
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:55,376
-And to our extended family.
-Hear, hear.

1011
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:57,909
Our family.

1012
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:25,011
-Pork pie, mister?
-No, thank you.

1013
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:44,188
Are you well?

1014
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,358
Yes, I....

1015
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,793
Only weary.

1016
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,938
You Iook so pale and were still so Iong.

1017
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,765
Forgive me.

1018
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:31,171
There are many opportunities here.

1019
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,807
Surely a fine-Iooking gentleman
is not reduced to such a necessity?

1020
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,680
I Iook no finer than you, sir.

1021
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:39,619
Yes, but I seek a worker, not work.

1022
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:44,458
How did this come about?

1023
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:47,053
Who's it for?

1024
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,392
My father.

1025
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,832
It's a bad thing for a young man
to Iose a father.

1026
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,632
I feel more of a child
than when he was alive.

1027
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:01,903
And so I am obliged
to throw off my uncle's protection...

1028
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,741
and take care of mother,
Kate, and Smike myself.

1029
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,745
-But I grow desperate.
-Now, don't say another word.

1030
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:17,292
My boy.

1031
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,262
My good sir,
would you be so good as to wait here?

1032
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,563
-Brother Ned?
-Yes, brother Charles?

1033
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:33,202
I've found someone for the position. We
should make inquiries into his statements.

1034
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:36,301
If confirmed, I'm hopeful they will be,
we should assist him.

1035
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:40,906
It's enough for me that if you say he should
be assisted, then we shall assist him.

1036
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:44,011
He has a mother, sister,
and friend in need of support...

1037
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:46,280
as well as the demands of his own stomach.

1038
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,824
Compared to us, dear brother,
he appears to have no stomach at all.

1039
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,416
Frank, where are those cakes?

1040
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:54,428
-Mr. Nickleby, my brother, Ned.
-How do you do, sir?

1041
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:57,231
Thank you, Frank.

1042
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,663
-My friend.
-Thank you.

1043
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,639
Would you give us a moment
to discuss your salary?

1044
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,133
Now then...

1045
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,268
I suppose we should ascertain
his previous--

1046
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:11,142
His previous stipend, of course.

1047
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,273
Forgive me, sir, your previous salary was?

1048
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,954
￡1 a week, sir.

1049
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,884
An annual salary of ￡52.

1050
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:26,493
That's rather an unsuitable
emolument for a boy.

1051
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:29,030
For such a talented, prospective youth.

1052
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:37,303
Mr. Nickleby, we would Iike to offer you
a position here...

1053
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:39,432
working alongside our nephew, Frank.

1054
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,736
Based on the feeling I had during our walk...

1055
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:45,746
as well as by the rapidity
with which you ate that cake...

1056
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:49,977
we'd Iike to begin you on a salary
of ￡1 20 a year.

1057
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,684
Is it not enough?

1058
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:59,521
-We won't wait Iong before improving it.
-No.

1059
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:03,129
It is the generosity of it that undoes me.

1060
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,429
For the first time since Father died...

1061
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:09,665
I feel we may at Iast be in a position
to find happiness.

1062
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:13,064
Thank you, both, a thousand times.

1063
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:20,672
-Are you at home?
-Yes.

1064
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,214
-To anybody?
-Yes.

1065
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,683
-To the tax gatherer?
-No.

1066
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,287
What about....

1067
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,322
I'd know your face anywhere.

1068
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,691
You'd know it better
if your nephew hadn't maltreated it.

1069
01:20:35,631 --> 01:20:36,791
Who is this?

1070
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:39,234
My son, Iittle Wackford.

1071
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,960
Indeed a specimen
of the Dotheboys's old diet.

1072
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:45,196
A miracle of high feeding.

1073
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:48,136
His flesh, his firmness.

1074
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,070
No tears.

1075
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:53,281
His oiliness.

1076
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:55,111
I'd expect nothing Iess.

1077
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,850
And Mrs. Squeers, how is....

1078
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:04,749
Mrs. Squeers is as she always is.
A joy to all them as knows her.

1079
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,220
One of our Iads had an abscess Iast week.

1080
01:21:09,398 --> 01:21:12,390
To see her operate on him with a penknife.

1081
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:16,160
And you? Have you recovered
from that scoundrel's attack?

1082
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,296
Only just.

1083
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:20,101
Your nephew is a vicious animal.

1084
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,633
That is why I asked you to come.

1085
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,212
Noggs...

1086
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,770
-see this package?
-It's big enough.

1087
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,906
Take it, please, at once.

1088
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:32,252
"Take it, please, at once."

1089
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:36,089
"At once, do you hear? If not sooner."

1090
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,887
He may be a Iittle mad.

1091
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:43,961
I wanted to offer you...

1092
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:47,366
this as a recompense...

1093
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:50,230
to your troubles, though...

1094
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:52,798
it seems foolish...

1095
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,172
if the boy is unpunished.

1096
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,212
He might come after you again.

1097
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,473
Surely he's been punished by you.

1098
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,741
Our ties have been cut.

1099
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:03,818
I'm not sure
that he views that as a punishment.

1100
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,949
What about the other boy?

1101
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,522
-Smike?
-Yes.

1102
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,592
You said that my nephew
was quite attached to him.

1103
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,924
What do you know of him?

1104
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:19,234
Only that he came to us 1 2 or so years ago.

1105
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:22,599
The money was paid at first,
and then it stopped.

1106
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,967
But I kept the Iad out of charity...

1107
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:29,407
which coincided with a period
of usefulness on his part.

1108
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:31,611
-No parents then?
-No.

1109
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,148
-No person with any claim on him?
-No.

1110
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:36,808
So he's yours.

1111
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,685
And he's been stolen.

1112
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:41,222
Would it not be well within your rights
to take him?

1113
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:44,019
That would settle your score
with my nephew.

1114
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:47,862
Wounding him, not through force...

1115
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,789
but through his own affections.

1116
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:57,071
Capturing wayward boys
is something of a specialty.

1117
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,542
It's most kind of you
to join me on my errands.

1118
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:02,940
Ribbons for sale.

1119
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,544
-Oh, dear.
-What is it?

1120
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,006
Father used to tell me...

1121
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:10,141
there were girls who sold ribbons
on the streets in London...

1122
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:14,051
and that if we ever came here,
he would buy me some as a remembrance.

1123
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:18,058
Ribbons for sale.

1124
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,259
How much, please?

1125
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,565
Twopence for the pink ones.
Penny for the others.

1126
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:30,332
I'II take the pink one, please.

1127
01:23:31,974 --> 01:23:33,032
Thank you.

1128
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:43,483
Help!

1129
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:46,687
Somebody! Help!

1130
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,887
It's Smike. He's been taken.

1131
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,864
It must be the wretched Squeers.
He was with your uncle.

1132
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:04,667
I didn't hear it all,
but they were speaking of Smike.

1133
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,369
-Newman, what shall we do?
-He stays at the Saracen's Head.

1134
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:13,007
Squeers, but no Smike.

1135
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:18,685
It's John Browdie.

1136
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,182
Is John Browdie good or bad?

1137
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:23,781
He gave me money
when he heard I'd beaten Squeers.

1138
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:26,327
He's very good.

1139
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:31,195
If it isn't--

1140
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:36,061
-What are you doing here?
-Tilda and I are on our honeymoon.

1141
01:24:36,138 --> 01:24:39,574
Schoolmaster says this was a fine place
to stay. He's here as well.

1142
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:42,371
I know. You remember the boy
that was with me that night?

1143
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,377
Crippled Iad? Of course.

1144
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,937
We suspect that Squeers has taken him,
just this day, by force.

1145
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:51,085
He's talked of nothing but revenge
since you Ieft.

1146
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,777
Could you find out if he has him?

1147
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,080
Who do you suppose we've Iaid
our hands on, Wackford and me?

1148
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:59,251
In London?
Not that hateful, horrible Mr. Knuckleboy?

1149
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:00,920
No, but next door to him.

1150
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,620
-Smike?
-Aye!

1151
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:06,030
Me and young Wackford, we grabbed him!

1152
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:09,564
He was crying and begging me to Iet him go,
but I wouldn't.

1153
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,606
What have thee done with him?

1154
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,804
He's in the schoolmaster's room,
next to our room.

1155
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:17,310
-What is the way in?
-You must go through the inn...

1156
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:20,870
but the schoolmaster is sitting
in the front room, just by the stairs.

1157
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:22,712
Oh, dear, it's impossible.

1158
01:25:22,985 --> 01:25:27,115
I could distract the schoolmaster.
Thee could slip past and go up to my room.

1159
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,747
There is a door
adjoining the schoolmaster's.

1160
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:31,554
Go through it, get the Iad.

1161
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:35,427
I'II watch the stairs and again try
to distract him when thee come out.

1162
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:38,432
May I offer an opinion
with regards to this scheme?

1163
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:42,395
It seems foolhardy, redolent of danger...

1164
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:46,438
and doomed to failure.
Otherwise, I can find no fault with it.

1165
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,873
It is for Smike.

1166
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:56,811
Schoolmaster, I couldn't trouble thee
to take the head of the table, could I?

1167
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,213
I'd Iike to propose a toast to thee...

1168
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:05,524
and thy family.
To thee, Mr. Squeers and the Iovely Fanny.

1169
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,226
Mr. Squeers...

1170
01:26:07,429 --> 01:26:09,454
I'd Iike to congratulate thee.

1171
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:52,134
I think it's about time for a song.
Come on, Tilda.

1172
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,936
Be still. Do not worry.

1173
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:35,806
Thank you.

1174
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,886
You are the best and bravest friend.

1175
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:42,390
Hush. Lean forward. I shall untie you.

1176
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:45,193
Grand singer, my wife.

1177
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:48,294
Little Wackford,
you Ieft our bedroom window open.

1178
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:51,890
-I did not.
-Don't argue with me, piglet, go and shut it.

1179
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,234
I thought I would have to go back.

1180
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:04,403
Never.

1181
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:09,005
But we are not free yet.
Speed and silence are of the essence.

1182
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:36,200
-Thee talking about the same blacksmith?
-Aye, that's him.

1183
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,871
Saw him the other day. I stuck up for thee.

1184
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:42,808
He said thee weren't fit to Iive with pigs.
I said thee were.

1185
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:46,011
Thank you kindly, John Browdie,
you're an honorable man.

1186
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,858
Fine door, that.

1187
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:05,338
Quick. Squeers is outside.

1188
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:21,948
-It's been a grand day, John Browdie.
-That it has.

1189
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:34,897
He was stolen?

1190
01:29:35,437 --> 01:29:37,098
Right from under you?

1191
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:40,541
To be Iiteral about it,
and I'm not sure this will dissipate...

1192
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:42,805
your very strong emotions on the subject...

1193
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:45,846
but he was actually stolen
right from over me.

1194
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:49,847
My nephew does not know the enemy
he has made in me.

1195
01:29:50,452 --> 01:29:53,148
I shall put his ruin
ahead of my own business!

1196
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,781
-Certainly done that already.
-What?

1197
01:29:57,092 --> 01:30:01,119
The bank sent a Ietter
saying you were short in your accounts.

1198
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:03,297
Sir Mulberry also wrote.

1199
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:07,230
-He declined your invitation to invest.
-Rubbish!

1200
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:10,571
The boy is not invincible.

1201
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:14,471
People who wish to be thought of as good
are always weak!

1202
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,339
I will Iisten to every rumor
and every rumble...

1203
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:23,683
until I can strike him.

1204
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,715
And then I will strike him...

1205
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,954
until he can be struck no more.

1206
01:30:42,404 --> 01:30:44,634
Now, my dear, you must....

1207
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:48,266
I do entreat and beseech of you....
You must get up.

1208
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,945
PIease, a chair, place her here.

1209
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:57,443
Not a word for your Iife, brother Ned.

1210
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:59,950
Now, my dear sir, you must Ieave.

1211
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:03,317
Is there no way I could be of service?

1212
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:05,850
...to which they said no.

1213
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:09,294
It has now been three weeks.
She's never come back.

1214
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:11,729
And no one will tell me anything about her.

1215
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:16,260
They never answer any questions on it,
and discourage the posing of others.

1216
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:18,566
This distresses me.

1217
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:21,972
Nicholas, have you found
your matching half?

1218
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,948
Then we must think of how to find her.

1219
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:30,374
For when she knows you,
she will Iove you, too.

1220
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:35,454
This is our nephew, Frank.
This is Mr. Nickleby's sister, Kate.

1221
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:38,949
My uncle says you're quite a gardener.
May I show you around?

1222
01:31:39,027 --> 01:31:40,187
PIease.

1223
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:43,527
Mrs. Nickleby, would you excuse Nicholas?

1224
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:46,089
We have a small matter of business
to attend to.

1225
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:47,691
Of course.

1226
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:53,297
I never thought I'd find fault
with your brother's statements...

1227
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:55,900
but he has described you
as exceedingly pretty.

1228
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:59,811
May I offer the correction
that such a remark seems inadequate?

1229
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:01,742
He has told me much of you...

1230
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,683
and of how patient
you have been in teaching him.

1231
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:11,221
Do you remember the young Iady
who fainted in our office?

1232
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:12,520
Fainted?

1233
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:14,318
Yes.

1234
01:32:14,963 --> 01:32:18,956
She is the daughter of a Iady whom,
when she herself was young...

1235
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,031
I Ioved very dearly.

1236
01:32:29,978 --> 01:32:33,641
You will smile, perhaps,
to hear an old man talk about such things.

1237
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:35,176
I have no such inclination.

1238
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:38,548
In fact, I'm eager to know
if she returned your affection.

1239
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:40,250
She made another choice.

1240
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,314
A man named Bray,

1241
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:47,390
Inconsiderate of all obligations,
except to those of his own leisure…

1242
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:50,757
he squandered his fortune, and then hers,

1243
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:55,964
Finally, after 20 years of bitter unhappiness,
she came to me…

1244
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:59,902
sadly changed, She was dying,

1245
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:03,639
And she asked us
to help her daughter, Madeline…

1246
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:06,236
should she ever seek our assistance,

1247
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:09,382
But Madeline has sought
these past two years...

1248
01:33:09,451 --> 01:33:11,419
to earn her money on her own.

1249
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:15,353
However, the demands for service
her father places upon her...

1250
01:33:15,857 --> 01:33:20,385
make steady, not to mention lucrative,
employment an impossibility,

1251
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:23,460
She came to us,
that day you caught her from fainting...

1252
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:26,796
and made the appeal,
asking only that her father never know.

1253
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:29,660
So we came up with this scheme...

1254
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:32,867
of which we are not unreasonably proud.

1255
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:36,736
-It is a very good scheme.
-It's very good, indeed.

1256
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,944
Madeline is an artist...

1257
01:33:40,482 --> 01:33:43,280
and we thought
that someone could make a feint...

1258
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:46,286
of commissioning her paintings
for a high price.

1259
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,451
This allows her to stay at home,
where he needs her--

1260
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:53,084
And allows our involvement to be disguised.
He knows us.

1261
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,688
We were hoping you would be the agent.

1262
01:34:18,286 --> 01:34:20,186
Madeline, who is this?

1263
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,188
Who told a stranger we could be seen?

1264
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:26,589
I'm here to purchase some paintings, sir.

1265
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:29,560
-These three, please.
-Very well.

1266
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:33,191
I want a newspaper, and grapes,
and another bottle of wine!

1267
01:34:33,268 --> 01:34:37,261
Yes, Father, very well,
I'II just finish with this gentleman.

1268
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:38,600
I want it now!

1269
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:47,080
PIease, Father.

1270
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:51,619
This purchase will help us
pay for the things you want.

1271
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:56,086
This never happened
when your mother was alive.

1272
01:35:03,665 --> 01:35:04,723
Sir.

1273
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:10,030
Pray, do not mention to my mother's
dear friends what has passed here.

1274
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:14,666
Father has suffered so much,
and is worse than usual this morning.

1275
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:19,904
You have but to hint at a wish,
and I would hazard my Iife to gratify it.

1276
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:27,914
Have you ever had the sensation
of Iooking at someone for the first time...

1277
01:35:27,989 --> 01:35:31,186
and ever so quickly,
the past and future seem to fuse?

1278
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:33,989
-The first time I saw you--
-At your uncle's.

1279
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:37,463
And then, that day on the street by the wall.

1280
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:41,268
-You remember.
-I felt such concern for you.

1281
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:42,892
And I for you.

1282
01:35:43,271 --> 01:35:44,966
Does that not mean something?

1283
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:48,202
That we felt so much, so deeply,
before speaking?

1284
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:51,077
And now that I know your history...

1285
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:54,478
I entreat you to believe,
I would do anything to help you.

1286
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,115
Do you know Madeline Bray?

1287
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:02,849
Nigel Bray's daughter?

1288
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:06,416
Indeed I do. She may be
the prettiest girl in all of London.

1289
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:08,518
Bray owes me money.

1290
01:36:09,197 --> 01:36:11,722
What if I were to erase that debt...

1291
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:15,164
in exchange for his giving you
his daughter's hand?

1292
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:19,972
Would that put you in a better frame of mind
to consider my investment?

1293
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:23,808
I should say it would secure it.

1294
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:30,241
My...

1295
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:35,021
the canvas must blush, she flatters it so.

1296
01:36:35,823 --> 01:36:37,916
Are they not extraordinary?

1297
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:43,393
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I was passing this way.

1298
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:47,433
I remember your telling me on our walk
how much you Iike violets.

1299
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:51,229
I thought I would bring some
for your mother...

1300
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:53,168
and all of you.

1301
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:56,973
That is most kind of you. They're Iovely.

1302
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:01,743
Thank you.
Won't you stay and have supper?

1303
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:04,607
Why, of course.

1304
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:23,799
Smike, old friend, will you not join us?

1305
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,039
I'm not hungry tonight.

1306
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,118
You seem so melancholy of Iate.

1307
01:37:41,956 --> 01:37:44,220
Do you fear Squeers might come again?

1308
01:37:46,561 --> 01:37:48,085
It is not that.

1309
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:52,430
Then what?

1310
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,965
Speak of it, and Iet me help you if I can.

1311
01:38:03,578 --> 01:38:06,103
I will tell you the reason one day...

1312
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:08,776
not now.

1313
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,784
I hate myself for it.

1314
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:19,622
But I cannot help it.

1315
01:38:24,499 --> 01:38:26,831
Will you trust me to tell you Iater?

1316
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,066
Of course.

1317
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,412
My heart is very full.

1318
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:47,187
You cannot know how much.

1319
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:20,719
I shall want two more in a week's time.

1320
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,749
Is that possible?

1321
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:26,458
-There won't be any more sales.
-Father.

1322
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:29,954
Not since the news.

1323
01:39:30,832 --> 01:39:32,094
News?

1324
01:39:33,768 --> 01:39:35,065
What is it?

1325
01:39:41,843 --> 01:39:44,539
-Can you not go see her and ask?
-No.

1326
01:39:44,946 --> 01:39:48,109
That would arouse suspicion
on her father's part.

1327
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:51,418
She will come to us and tell us, I feel sure.

1328
01:39:51,853 --> 01:39:53,787
I shall ask my sister and mother.

1329
01:39:53,855 --> 01:39:56,380
Their feminine sympathies
may shed some Iight.

1330
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,119
There is no need. Your sister is here.

1331
01:39:59,694 --> 01:40:01,161
Forgive me...

1332
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:05,595
but there is a matter about which
I am harboring the gravest concerns.

1333
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:07,266
It is Smike.

1334
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:10,564
Inhale.

1335
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,035
Again.

1336
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:16,303
He's gravely ill,

1337
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:19,278
Every token of rapid consumption
is present.

1338
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:23,710
His only hope depends upon
his being instantly removed from London.

1339
01:40:24,552 --> 01:40:27,988
-Devonshire's the best place.
-We come from Devonshire.

1340
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:33,654
Whoever takes him should
prepare for the worst. He may never return.

1341
01:40:35,796 --> 01:40:37,263
Good evening.

1342
01:40:44,739 --> 01:40:45,831
Father...

1343
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:50,240
I know I am stronger than when you Ieft us,
but not strong enough to Iose Smike.

1344
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,776
If this is what that strength is for,
then I do not want it.

1345
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:56,614
Not Smike.

1346
01:41:17,038 --> 01:41:18,630
This is my room.

1347
01:42:19,433 --> 01:42:22,596
Once, when Kate was very Iittle,
she was Iost.

1348
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:26,568
After hours of search,
we found her here, fast asleep...

1349
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:28,675
before there was any grave...

1350
01:42:28,743 --> 01:42:31,234
protected from the sun by this tree.

1351
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:36,814
Father took her up, still sleeping,
and told my mother that whenever he died...

1352
01:42:37,018 --> 01:42:40,920
he was to be buried
where his dear Iittle child had Iaid her head.

1353
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:46,358
It is a beautiful tree.

1354
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:50,590
It is Iike a home.

1355
01:43:02,977 --> 01:43:04,604
What is it?

1356
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:09,642
Do you remember my telling you
of the man who took me to school?

1357
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:12,218
I just now raised my eyes
towards that tree...

1358
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:14,787
and there, with his eyes fixed on me,
he stood!

1359
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:16,880
Only reflect for a moment.

1360
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,159
Granted that he is alive...

1361
01:43:19,226 --> 01:43:21,888
and wandering around
so Ionely a place as this...

1362
01:43:21,962 --> 01:43:24,089
so far from the public road...

1363
01:43:24,632 --> 01:43:28,830
do you think at this distance of time
you could possibly know the man again?

1364
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:30,799
Anywhere.

1365
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,466
Let us go inside.

1366
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:52,821
I've had such pleasant dreams,

1367
01:43:59,033 --> 01:44:02,161
You asked me some time ago
why I was so melancholy.

1368
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,035
Shall I tell you why?

1369
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,203
Not if it pains you.

1370
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:11,543
I only asked that I might make you happier.

1371
01:44:13,447 --> 01:44:14,641
I know.

1372
01:44:16,317 --> 01:44:17,750
I felt that.

1373
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:24,554
You will forgive me, because...

1374
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,523
I could not help it.

1375
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:39,630
Though I would've died to make her happy...

1376
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:44,244
it broke my heart to see.

1377
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:50,542
I know he Ioves her dearly.

1378
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:52,810
Kate.

1379
01:45:00,361 --> 01:45:01,885
I Iove her.

1380
01:45:10,538 --> 01:45:12,733
I procured a Iock of her hair.

1381
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:16,771
It hangs at my breast, in these ribbons.

1382
01:45:22,216 --> 01:45:23,808
When I am dead...

1383
01:45:24,919 --> 01:45:29,754
would you please take it off,
so that no eyes but yours might see it?

1384
01:45:33,127 --> 01:45:35,561
And when I am Iaid in my coffin...

1385
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:39,392
and am about to be put in the earth...

1386
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:45,628
would you hang it round my neck,
that it might rest with me forever?

1387
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:49,572
On my knees, I pledge it.

1388
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:57,477
Now....

1389
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,144
Now I can say it:

1390
01:46:04,425 --> 01:46:05,790
I am happy.

1391
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:00,571
Newman.

1392
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:09,513
Smike is gone.

1393
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:14,122
BIess you, dear boy.

1394
01:47:17,865 --> 01:47:19,890
Thank God for you, Newman.

1395
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:22,392
AIways there to catch me.

1396
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:25,735
But what brings you here?

1397
01:47:25,806 --> 01:47:29,105
The young Iady
for whom you've come to care so deeply--

1398
01:47:29,209 --> 01:47:31,575
-Is she in danger?
-She's to be married...

1399
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:33,804
-to Sir Mulberry Hawk.
-What?

1400
01:47:34,148 --> 01:47:37,083
Before I tell you this,
promise you won't do anything rash.

1401
01:47:37,151 --> 01:47:38,743
Tell me.

1402
01:47:39,753 --> 01:47:41,653
It was your uncle. It was his idea.

1403
01:47:41,722 --> 01:47:44,816
I overheard it,
and I'm sure he did it to wound you.

1404
01:47:45,192 --> 01:47:49,094
I've so much more to tell you about him
and your dear friend Smike.

1405
01:47:49,163 --> 01:47:53,725
Your uncle doesn't know it yet,
but he has just Iost ￡10,000.

1406
01:48:03,344 --> 01:48:04,709
What are you doing here?

1407
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:08,270
I come to offer aid
to the unhappy subject of your treachery:

1408
01:48:08,382 --> 01:48:11,374
-Madeline Bray.
-Do you know her?

1409
01:48:13,921 --> 01:48:15,855
I beg you for a moment alone.

1410
01:48:16,223 --> 01:48:18,088
You were betrayed and sold for money.

1411
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:22,652
This web is of my own weaving.
I know what I am doing and why.

1412
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:25,893
I know why, too.
It only deepens my esteem for you.

1413
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:28,433
But you cannot degrade yourself
in your esteem...

1414
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:31,733
by giving yourself away
as payment for another man's debt.

1415
01:48:32,139 --> 01:48:36,599
I will not disguise from you, sir,
that I have undergone some...

1416
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:40,337
pain of mind.

1417
01:48:42,282 --> 01:48:45,410
I do not Iove the gentleman.

1418
01:48:46,754 --> 01:48:50,349
This he knows,
and knowing, still offers me his hand.

1419
01:48:50,457 --> 01:48:52,687
By accepting, I can free my father--

1420
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:55,558
Does your own happiness matter so Iittle?

1421
01:48:55,963 --> 01:48:58,488
Father is all that remains of my family.

1422
01:48:58,565 --> 01:49:01,659
That is why I have come to offer you
a place in our home.

1423
01:49:06,974 --> 01:49:09,101
You have been so good to me.

1424
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:13,479
But I cannot Ieave Father.

1425
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:15,682
He must come with you.

1426
01:49:19,253 --> 01:49:20,845
He is too proud.

1427
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:24,480
I am proud, too...

1428
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:29,322
to know someone...

1429
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:31,959
so good.

1430
01:49:37,104 --> 01:49:40,335
Madeline, come at once. It's your father.

1431
01:49:42,776 --> 01:49:45,643
He wouldn't stir, even after I tapped him.

1432
01:50:08,068 --> 01:50:09,160
Come.

1433
01:50:10,337 --> 01:50:12,305
Let us Ieave this place.

1434
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:20,404
My curse upon you.

1435
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:24,179
My bitter, deadly curse upon you, boy.

1436
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:26,717
Your curse has no power over me.

1437
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:30,523
The structures you raised
all through your misspent Iife...

1438
01:50:30,591 --> 01:50:32,559
are crumbling into dust.

1439
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,223
This very day...

1440
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:39,561
￡10,000 of your hoarded wealth are gone...

1441
01:50:40,334 --> 01:50:42,165
in one great crash.

1442
01:50:42,636 --> 01:50:46,868
-How could you know such a thing?
-It is true, and you shall find it so.

1443
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,633
Your day is done.

1444
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:52,704
Night is coming fast for you.

1445
01:50:57,784 --> 01:51:01,220
￡10,000? Can that be true?

1446
01:51:03,557 --> 01:51:05,650
I've invested such a sum...

1447
01:51:05,993 --> 01:51:08,791
and I am waiting...

1448
01:51:10,564 --> 01:51:12,088
for news of it.

1449
01:51:14,902 --> 01:51:16,995
But he could not know that.

1450
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:26,204
If he is right that you have Iost the money...

1451
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:30,580
and the money that Bray owed you,
you shall not have my money now.

1452
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:32,709
He is...

1453
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:37,214
not right.

1454
01:51:40,827 --> 01:51:44,786
My Iife collapsed Iike a house of sticks
the day my father died.

1455
01:51:45,432 --> 01:51:49,528
I clung to my mother and sister,
then Smike and Noggs...

1456
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:53,003
hoping, waiting for I knew not what.

1457
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:57,107
I knew not what,
until that day when I opened my eyes...

1458
01:51:57,177 --> 01:52:00,271
and the darkness
was replaced with the sight of your face.

1459
01:52:00,414 --> 01:52:04,851
It was the island towards which
I'd been sailing, unguided, my whole Iife...

1460
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:09,184
the dream my father had promised me
before I could even imagine its existence.

1461
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:15,688
I have been happy for times,
Iittle times, since he died...

1462
01:52:16,597 --> 01:52:18,326
but never at peace.

1463
01:52:19,866 --> 01:52:22,300
Not until I Iooked at your face...

1464
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:25,098
and saw the universe in order behind it.

1465
01:52:25,172 --> 01:52:26,537
Nicholas...

1466
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:32,739
I feel you know what it's Iike
to be without happiness...

1467
01:52:34,181 --> 01:52:37,207
but do you know what it's Iike
to be afraid of it?

1468
01:52:37,351 --> 01:52:39,182
To see the world...

1469
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:44,657
as so conniving, you cannot take pleasure
in the appearance of something good...

1470
01:52:45,993 --> 01:52:48,120
because you suspect...

1471
01:52:49,563 --> 01:52:52,964
it is only a painted drop
behind which other troubles Iie.

1472
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:56,466
That has been my Iife.

1473
01:52:58,005 --> 01:53:00,473
Every good thing has been a trick.

1474
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:04,073
Until you.

1475
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:08,604
Yet I am afraid to take your hand.

1476
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:13,085
What if you cannot or will not...

1477
01:53:13,587 --> 01:53:14,815
save me?

1478
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:19,049
I can bear to be maltreated
by the greedy or the weak...

1479
01:53:20,627 --> 01:53:22,424
but to be Iet down...

1480
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,155
-by an angel--
-I am not an angel.

1481
01:53:27,067 --> 01:53:30,161
I Iive as far from that Iofty perch as any man.

1482
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:32,904
My temper alone, my impatience....

1483
01:53:33,974 --> 01:53:37,933
Perhaps I should not Iist all my faults,
in case I am too persuasive.

1484
01:53:38,011 --> 01:53:41,913
You are the one
who is so admirably able and strong.

1485
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:53,089
I am tired of being strong.

1486
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:56,189
As am I.

1487
01:53:56,930 --> 01:54:00,422
Weakness is tiring,
but strength is exhausting.

1488
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:06,065
You see, I cannot save you...

1489
01:54:07,441 --> 01:54:09,341
for I need saving, too.

1490
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:13,745
What are you proposing?

1491
01:54:14,648 --> 01:54:15,945
Only this:

1492
01:54:16,883 --> 01:54:20,410
that we save ourselves together.

1493
01:54:34,468 --> 01:54:37,995
Nicholas, please. Think of the others.
People might see.

1494
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:41,407
I don't care.

1495
01:54:57,357 --> 01:54:58,483
Noggs?

1496
01:55:41,902 --> 01:55:43,096
My God.

1497
01:56:06,226 --> 01:56:08,126
Ten thousand...

1498
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:11,024
pounds.

1499
01:56:49,736 --> 01:56:51,966
Who bade you enter this house?

1500
01:56:52,772 --> 01:56:57,038
-I have no business with you.
-AIas, we have business with you.

1501
01:56:58,745 --> 01:57:01,976
We have come
to report a tragedy in your family.

1502
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:04,982
-Has something happened to my niece?
-No, sir.

1503
01:57:05,085 --> 01:57:07,519
Though we do bring news of a death.

1504
01:57:07,587 --> 01:57:10,249
Don't tell me it's her brother's death?

1505
01:57:11,291 --> 01:57:13,486
That would be too welcome to be true.

1506
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,858
Sorry to disappoint you, Uncle.

1507
01:57:16,129 --> 01:57:19,326
But it will not be the Iast unhappy
development for you this night.

1508
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:20,764
You know nothing.

1509
01:57:20,834 --> 01:57:23,359
Every word I will say to you
is based on information...

1510
01:57:23,436 --> 01:57:25,631
from an unimpeachable source.

1511
01:57:26,172 --> 01:57:27,434
This man...

1512
01:57:28,341 --> 01:57:30,866
who'd sell his soul for a drink?

1513
01:57:31,411 --> 01:57:32,969
This is a good beginning.

1514
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:36,038
To tamper with a fellow Iike this,
whose every word is a Iie!

1515
01:57:36,082 --> 01:57:38,073
Who made me a fellow Iike this?

1516
01:57:38,585 --> 01:57:41,952
If I'd sell my soul for a drink,
why wasn't I a thief?

1517
01:57:42,088 --> 01:57:43,316
Swindler?

1518
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:46,691
Here, you, Nickleby!

1519
01:57:49,195 --> 01:57:51,720
You say they tampered with me.

1520
01:57:52,866 --> 01:57:56,302
Who was it tampered
with the Yorkshire schoolmaster...

1521
01:57:56,836 --> 01:57:59,202
to take Smike away from them?

1522
01:58:02,642 --> 01:58:05,338
You're Iistening now, aren't you?

1523
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:10,616
You are an eavesdropping,
drunken scoundrel.

1524
01:58:11,117 --> 01:58:14,553
I deny the charge,
but ask regardless, what of it?

1525
01:58:15,822 --> 01:58:18,290
I'm back, Mr. Nickleby.

1526
01:58:21,861 --> 01:58:23,488
What have we now?

1527
01:58:25,632 --> 01:58:27,031
Do you know who this is?

1528
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,728
We are satisfied
Mr. Brooker speaks the truth.

1529
01:58:30,704 --> 01:58:32,228
A common thief.

1530
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:34,967
A beggar. A convict!

1531
01:58:36,242 --> 01:58:38,267
Were you not once married?

1532
01:58:42,182 --> 01:58:43,240
What?

1533
01:58:56,196 --> 01:58:58,187
There's no crime in that.

1534
01:58:58,732 --> 01:59:01,428
But you desired the marriage
to be kept secret…

1535
01:59:01,501 --> 01:59:03,492
for if your wife's father had known…

1536
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:07,563
he would have changed his will
and denied you his fortune,

1537
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:15,573
Mr. Brooker also tells us
your wife had a child.

1538
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:18,147
Your child.

1539
01:59:20,086 --> 01:59:23,886
Because the marriage was secret,
this, too, had to be kept secret...

1540
01:59:24,024 --> 01:59:25,321
and you sent her away.

1541
01:59:25,392 --> 01:59:27,519
Hush, my dear.

1542
01:59:28,128 --> 01:59:29,857
Don't mind it now.

1543
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:32,430
Let me raise your head.

1544
01:59:35,869 --> 01:59:37,029
There.

1545
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:43,108
So the child was put out to nurse, far away,

1546
01:59:44,944 --> 01:59:49,005
His mother never saw him,
and she grew tired of the deception,

1547
01:59:50,216 --> 01:59:52,548
So she eloped with another man.

1548
01:59:52,886 --> 01:59:56,253
Soon thereafter, she came into her money.

1549
01:59:57,557 --> 01:59:59,787
You, naturally, pursued her...

1550
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:02,427
Ieaving me in charge of the boy.

1551
02:00:03,296 --> 02:00:07,130
I was told to bring him here, which I did,
keeping him in the garret,

1552
02:00:07,567 --> 02:00:09,535
Neglect made him sickly,

1553
02:00:10,770 --> 02:00:12,567
Mr, Brooker consulted a doctor…

1554
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:16,405
who said he must be removed from the city
for a change of air…

1555
02:00:16,843 --> 02:00:18,401
or he would die.

1556
02:00:20,914 --> 02:00:23,815
But he did die. I know that.

1557
02:00:24,684 --> 02:00:26,447
At Iast I can say it.

1558
02:00:26,986 --> 02:00:31,252
I told you that the boy had died,
but he had not.

1559
02:00:33,426 --> 02:00:36,759
I had heard, like most men,
of Yorkshire schools,

1560
02:00:37,464 --> 02:00:40,456
So I took the child to one
kept by a man named Squeers,

1561
02:00:42,535 --> 02:00:45,766
I was able to pay the fees myself,
but then my troubles took over…

1562
02:00:45,839 --> 02:00:48,307
and I was sent away out of this country,

1563
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:52,238
When I returned, nearly eight years later,
I sought you out,

1564
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:54,474
But you repulsed me,

1565
02:00:55,048 --> 02:00:56,982
So I found out your clerk…

1566
02:00:57,083 --> 02:01:00,541
and showed him there were good reasons
for communicating with me,

1567
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,217
I told him my story,

1568
02:01:02,322 --> 02:01:05,723
But just to be sure that the boy
I was thinking of was the same boy…

1569
02:01:07,227 --> 02:01:10,993
I went to Devonshire,
and knew at once that it was,

1570
02:01:14,067 --> 02:01:15,557
Did Squeers...

1571
02:01:16,703 --> 02:01:18,603
know who the child was?

1572
02:01:20,206 --> 02:01:21,230
No.

1573
02:01:22,175 --> 02:01:24,405
I told him his name was Smike.

1574
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:39,425
Then the crippled boy...

1575
02:01:43,163 --> 02:01:44,494
is my son.

1576
02:01:45,331 --> 02:01:47,697
Was your son.

1577
02:01:49,469 --> 02:01:53,530
That boy, whose Ioving cheerfulness
and sweetness of heart...

1578
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:56,871
could have been
the Iife-saving comfort you need...

1579
02:01:57,177 --> 02:01:59,543
as all your fortune falls away...

1580
02:01:59,879 --> 02:02:02,370
that boy now sleeps in the ground...

1581
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:05,617
by my father.

1582
02:03:41,881 --> 02:03:45,408
Nearer and nearer draws the time

1583
02:03:45,652 --> 02:03:48,951
the time that shall surely be

1584
02:03:49,289 --> 02:03:54,226
when the Earth shall be filled
with the glory of God

1585
02:03:55,328 --> 02:03:59,765
as the waters cover the sea

1586
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:09,169
Ring on.

1587
02:04:12,845 --> 02:04:15,541
For births that Iead to early deaths...

1588
02:04:17,850 --> 02:04:21,013
for marriages made in hell...

1589
02:04:24,324 --> 02:04:26,952
and for the coming in of every year...

1590
02:04:28,161 --> 02:04:31,255
that brings this cursed world
closer to its end.

1591
02:04:37,971 --> 02:04:39,962
Would that it had come...

1592
02:04:44,477 --> 02:04:45,967
before tonight.

1593
02:04:58,524 --> 02:05:02,688
What can we do to work God's work

1594
02:05:03,329 --> 02:05:06,890
to prosper and increase

1595
02:05:06,966 --> 02:05:11,096
the brotherhood of all mankind

1596
02:05:11,637 --> 02:05:15,004
the reign of the Prince of Peace?

1597
02:05:21,414 --> 02:05:25,180
What can we do to hasten the time

1598
02:05:25,585 --> 02:05:29,316
the time that shall surely be

1599
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:32,214
when the Earth shall be filled

1600
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:36,192
with the glory of God

1601
02:05:37,163 --> 02:05:39,324
as the waters

1602
02:05:39,399 --> 02:05:42,800
cover the sea?

1603
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:51,470
In every life, no matter how full
or empty one's purse…

1604
02:05:52,278 --> 02:05:53,905
there is tragedy,

1605
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,477
It is the one promise life always fulfills,

1606
02:05:58,151 --> 02:06:00,619
Thus, happiness is a gift…

1607
02:06:01,187 --> 02:06:06,022
and the trick is not to expect it,
but to delight in it when it comes…

1608
02:06:06,726 --> 02:06:09,524
and to add to other people's store of it,

1609
02:06:10,797 --> 02:06:12,992
What happens if, too early...

1610
02:06:13,699 --> 02:06:15,326
we Iose a parent...

1611
02:06:15,802 --> 02:06:19,761
that party on whom we rely
for only everything?

1612
02:06:20,773 --> 02:06:24,072
What did these people do
when their families shrank?

1613
02:06:24,644 --> 02:06:28,808
They cried their tears,
but then they did the vital thing:

1614
02:06:29,749 --> 02:06:33,549
They built a new family, person by person.

1615
02:06:34,053 --> 02:06:37,545
They came to see
that family need not be defined...

1616
02:06:37,623 --> 02:06:40,558
merely as those
with whom they share blood...

1617
02:06:40,726 --> 02:06:44,287
but as those for whom
they would give their blood.

1618
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:49,060
It is in that spirit
that we offer this heartfelt toast...

1619
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:51,899
to the brides and grooms.

1620
02:06:53,139 --> 02:06:55,004
The brides and grooms.

1621
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:39,284
We are going to Iive in the old house again.

1622
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:42,952
And we will walk and sit here every day...

1623
02:07:43,422 --> 02:07:45,754
soon, I hope, with our children.

1624
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:50,356
We will always be with you...

1625
02:07:50,997 --> 02:07:53,795
and you with us, dearest Father...

1626
02:07:56,169 --> 02:07:57,534
and cousin.

1627
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,147
