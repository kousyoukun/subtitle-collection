1
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:57,861
"Dear Mother.
I hope you are keeping well...

2
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,741
and not worrying too much about me.

3
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,501
You mustn't think that any of us
are going to be killed...

4
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,341
for they are collecting
such a force here...

5
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:08,661
that an attack would be insane.

6
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:11,381
The Massachusetts men
passed through here this morning.

7
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:16,021
How grand it is to meet the men
from all the states, east and west...

8
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:18,061
down here, ready to
fight for their country...

9
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,221
as the old fellows did
in the Revolution.

10
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:24,901
But this time we must make it
a whole country...

11
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:28,541
for all who live here,
so that all can speak.

12
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,941
Before this war began...

13
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:36,381
many of my regiment
had never seen a Negro.

14
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:39,741
Now the roads are choked
with the dispossessed.

15
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:43,141
We fight for men and women...

16
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:46,181
whose poetry is not yet written,
but which will presently...

17
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:49,421
be as enviable
and as renowned as any.

18
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:54,781
Last night we heard
of yet another defeat.

19
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,821
But we are not disheartened.

20
00:02:56,901 --> 00:03:00,021
I am honored to be part
of such a splendid company.

21
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:04,381
They have made me captain,
of which I am enormously proud.

22
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:07,581
You would think it strange to see me
giving orders to a hundred men...

23
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,581
most of whom are older than I am.

24
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,861
Thank you for sending
my volume of Emerson.

25
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,381
His words come home to me
like truth--

26
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:21,701
'A deep man, ' he says, 'believes
that the evil eye can wither...

27
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:24,181
that the heart's blessing
can heal...

28
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:27,501
and that love
can overcome all odds. '

29
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,821
My dearest love to Father.

30
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,421
Your son, Robert. "

31
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:53,021
Charge!
Company, torward!

32
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,261
Charge!
Company, torward!

33
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,701
- Charge!
- Fire!

34
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,221
Fire!

35
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,421
Aim!

36
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,061
Fire!

37
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,701
Stand. Fire!

38
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,341
Steady, boys!

39
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:48,421
- Forward!
- Fire!

40
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,501
Forward, men!

41
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,221
For God's sake, come on!

42
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,821
Robert, come on!
We must tall back!

43
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,821
No! Forbes!

44
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,341
Forbes!

45
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,101
Charge!

46
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,581
Fire!

47
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,021
You all right there, Captain?

48
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,101
Please! Not my leg!

49
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:31,021
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!

50
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,021
Stop!

51
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:38,861
No! Wait!

52
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,861
- No!
- Hold on!

53
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:45,421
So it's your neck?

54
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:49,101
The surgeons are busy,
but I'll fix you up.

55
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,101
- Let me know if I hurt you.
- Stop!

56
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,301
Ah, this is nothing.

57
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:57,301
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?

58
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,901
I heard it from a triend
who's a dispatch rider...

59
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:04,341
who got it trom one ot Stanton's clerks
in the War Ottice.

60
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,621
He says Lincoln is gonna issue
an emancipation proclamation.

61
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:10,621
Gonna free the slaves.

62
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:14,461
- What?
- Maybe not in the border states...

63
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,741
but he will free some, anyway.

64
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,781
My God.

65
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,781
He said he would have done it sooner,
only he was waiting tor a big victory...

66
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,061
which is, I guess, what this is.

67
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,541
Oh, my God!

68
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:29,541
Please don't cut anymore, please!

69
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,861
Please!

70
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,101
This might hurt you, Captain.
"m sorry.

71
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:07,421
Dashing.

72
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,861
- Robert.
- Thomas.

73
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:38,861
Captain Shaw.
I was so proud when l heard.

74
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:42,141
They had no choice.
All the other otticers are dead.

75
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:45,101
- And Forbes?
- lmpossible, as always.

76
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:47,541
He's here somewhere.

77
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,061
How about you?

78
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:51,981
Working tor your tather,
helping him with the resettlement...

79
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:54,021
tor the Freedmen's Relief Association.

80
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:58,021
There's a shortage of housing.
Robert! Are you all right?

81
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:00,021
Yes. "m sorry.

82
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,981
Darling, there's someone
who wishes to meet you.

83
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,461
General Hunter rounded up
a bunch ot slaves...

84
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,061
called them contraband
and put them in camps like cattle.

85
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,981
The War Department decided
to issue them pikes rather than guns.

86
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,621
Ot course they deserted.
So would I.

87
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:22,901
Robert. Governor,
you know my son Robert.

88
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:25,981
- Good to see you again.
- Governor Andrew.

89
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,781
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?

90
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,581
Mr. Douglass.

91
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,621
I understand you were at Antietam.

92
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:49,181
A great and a terrible day.

93
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,341
I could use your help.

94
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,061
The governor is proposing to raise
a regiment ot Negro soldiers.

95
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:02,181
No. It was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass--

96
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,981
We will offer pride and dignity...

97
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:07,261
to those who have known
only degradation.

98
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:11,221
- Colored soldiers. Just think of it.
- Wonderful.

99
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:14,021
I've submitted your name
to be commissioned colonel...

100
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,421
of the 54th Massachusetts lntantry.

101
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,061
Thank you, Governor.
That's--

102
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,061
lt's a wondertul idea.

103
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,301
Excuse me.

104
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:41,301
Well done, Shaw.

105
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,861
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.

106
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:05,381
What's the matter?
Too much punch?

107
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:14,421
I know how much you'd like to
make colonel, but a colored regiment?

108
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,781
You know how popular that would be?

109
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,661
Handing out guns
to a thousand coloreds?

110
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,341
Hey, Robert.

111
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:38,221
What's wrong?

112
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,901
I'm gonna do it.

113
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:51,741
You're not serious.

114
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:59,301
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?

115
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,061
And you?

116
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,701
Can you picture me
in charge ot a regiment?

117
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:15,821
Picture me in charge ot anything.

118
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:19,901
I would be honored to have you.

119
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,901
Then you're an idiot.

120
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:31,781
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?

121
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:34,421
So it seems.

122
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:36,581
Then I am your first volunteer.

123
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:49,101
Present arms!

124
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,581
How do we look, Colonel?
We gonna whup the Secess'?

125
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,501
When do we get the blue suit?

126
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:59,101
Yeah, the blue suit.

127
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,741
Ready to whip them Rebs.

128
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:12,661
When are we gonna get to fight?

129
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,661
Are we really gonna get to tight
this time?

130
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,941
Attention!

131
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:33,101
Morning.

132
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:38,981
Good morning, gentlemen.

133
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:42,301
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.

134
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,301
I am your commanding otticer.

135
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,181
It is a great pleasure
to see you all here today.

136
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:57,101
It is my hope that the same courage...

137
00:15:57,181 --> 00:16:00,741
spirit and honor...

138
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:03,221
which has brought us together...

139
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,661
will one day restore this Union.

140
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,901
May God bless us all!

141
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:19,101
Form companies?

142
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:21,461
We will commence
with forming companies.

143
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,461
Company otficers, take charge.

144
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:30,061
You recruits will report
to your respective otticers...

145
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:34,421
by the letter of your company
in aIphabetical order...

146
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:39,221
which is in the top lett-hand corner
of your muster sheet.

147
00:16:57,341 --> 00:17:00,541
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.

148
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,141
Name's SearIes. Thomas Searles.

149
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,981
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?

150
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:08,741
lt's a collection ot essays--
Fourier, Emerson...

151
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:11,381
all the transcendentalists.

152
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,381
It got pictures?

153
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,821
- Teach me?
- Yes, "d be happy to.

154
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:34,261
Look at what's walking in here!

155
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:36,261
I'd rather have a hog
than a nigger.

156
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:39,741
- At least you could eat the hog!
- Getting dark mighty earIy around here.

157
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,781
Show us a little dance,
nigger boys!

158
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,501
Sergeant of the Guard,
post your sentry.

159
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:09,501
Yes, sir!

160
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:22,221
Wait, no. That's my space, nigger.

161
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,221
I sleep better close by the door.

162
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:27,381
I preter a space
with more reading light.

163
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,301
Oh, I like it when niggers
talk good as white folk.

164
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,141
I'd be happy to teach you.

165
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,781
It would be my pleasure.

166
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:40,661
Look, snowtlake, I ain't got nothing
to learn trom no house nigger.

167
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:45,221
I am a tree man,
as was my tather.

168
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:48,541
Good. Move your free black ass
before I bust it up.

169
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:50,701
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.

170
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,661
lt's all right.

171
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,661
I'll be fine over here.

172
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:57,941
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.

173
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:03,981
Wonder when they gonna
give us the blue suit.

174
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:07,821
Ain't no blue suit tor the black
soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.

175
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:11,461
Well, we soldiers now.

176
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,101
Where you from, field hand?

177
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:15,901
South Carolina.

178
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:18,501
You ought to know better, boy.

179
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,981
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.

180
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,981
What's your name?

181
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:40,941
I said what's your name, boy?

182
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:44,021
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?

183
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,181
He's mute.

184
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:50,341
You mean this child can't talk?

185
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,941
Hey, come over here, hon.

186
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:02,061
Dummies and tield hands.
Ain't that a bitch?

187
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,941
What about you, buck?
Whereabouts you from?

188
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:09,901
I'm trom around Tennessee.

189
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:12,741
Ran away when I was 12 years old,
and l ain't never look back.

190
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:15,101
What you doing since then?

191
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,221
I run for president.

192
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:23,981
I didn't win though.

193
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,301
Boy.

194
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:00,901
Major? Forbes.
That's you.

195
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:02,501
- Thomas.
- Hello.

196
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:05,061
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.

197
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,781
- Thomas Searles.
- Captain.

198
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:12,221
So how was your meal?

199
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:14,501
The remoulade was a trifle tart...

200
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:17,061
but the souftle tor dessert
more than made up for it.

201
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,061
And your comrades?

202
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:25,101
Charming. Extraordinary
conversationalists, every one.

203
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:26,861
Major Forbes!

204
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:31,301
- A word, please.
- Oh, excuse me, Thomas.

205
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,141
Yes, Robert?

206
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:41,341
I won't permit
that kind ot fraternization.

207
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:45,181
- lt's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.

208
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,501
You're right, ot course.

209
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,701
I've sent tor help.

210
00:21:52,741 --> 00:21:54,981
These men need a proper teacher.

211
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:59,541
For God's sake, you march like
a bunch ot crippled old goats!

212
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:01,941
We're gonna be here day and night
till we get this right!

213
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:05,581
One, one. Company, halt.

214
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,741
About-face!

215
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:12,341
You are ugly Mexican-Atrican
tucking whores!

216
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:15,061
We're gonna work on this
day and night, gentlemen!

217
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:17,781
Forward at the haIt step. March!

218
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:20,701
One! You halt-wit black bastard.

219
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:22,701
Is it true they cut your balls off
at birth?

220
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:26,541
I'll work on you
till I get you broken.

221
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:28,341
Company, halt!

222
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:30,981
Do you not know your right
from your lett?

223
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,981
No, sir.

224
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,141
How many here do not know
right trom left?

225
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:41,861
Jesus, have pity.

226
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,741
This is your tront!

227
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:47,021
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this--

228
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,661
Now you're learning, boy-o.

229
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:53,461
Company, torward march!

230
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:55,781

- Two!
- One! Two!

232
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,181
You bloody Hindus, get it right!

233
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:09,261
Stop. Start it again.
In each rank! Count!

234
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:14,021
Lett. Left, right, lett!

235
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,261
Right, torward, march!

236
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:20,581
Lett. Get your goddamn hand
out ot your pocket!

237
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:27,221
Bonny Prince Charlie!
Are you a gentleman?

238
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:29,221
Are you a member ot congress
or something?

239
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:31,461
Or are you the bloody
prince ot Africa?

240
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,861
Don't look at me!
Look straight ahead!

241
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:35,861
I'll heat your ass up, boy-o!

242
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:39,621
The lrish are not noted
tor their tondness tor the coloreds.

243
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,901
What about the uniforms?

244
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:44,461
Still no word.

245
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,461
Ritles?

246
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,981
See to it.

247
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,581
You're a big buck, aren't you?
You've got a lot to learn!

248
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,381
You haven't had a master like me!

249
00:23:56,461 --> 00:24:00,021
"Dear Mother.
The men learn very quickly.

250
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:02,941
Faster than white troops,
it seems to me.

251
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:06,021
They are almost grave
and sedate under instruction...

252
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,581
and they restrain themselves.

253
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:12,501
But the moment they are dismissed
from drill...

254
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:17,581
every tongue is relaxed
and every ivory tooth is visible...

255
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:20,981
and you would not know from the sound
of it that this is an army camp.

256
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:26,941
They must have learned this from long
hours of meaningless, inhuman work...

257
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:28,941
to set their minds free so quickly.

258
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:32,381
It gives them great energy.

259
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:34,821
There is no doubt
that we will leave this state...

260
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:37,861
as fine a regiment
as any that has marched.

261
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:40,861
As ever, your son, Robert. "

262
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,221
They've done it.

263
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,501
Assemble the men.

264
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:53,621
Attention!

265
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:55,501
Attention!

266
00:24:56,981 --> 00:24:58,901
BattaIion!

267
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:07,821
In accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes...

268
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,821
you men are advised...

269
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:15,461
that the Confederate Congress
has issued a proclamation.

270
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:19,861
It reads:

271
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:24,061
"Any Negro taken in arms...

272
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:27,061
against the Confederacy...

273
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:31,101
will immediately be returned
to a state ot slavery.

274
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:37,501
Any Negro taken in Federal unitorm...

275
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:40,821
will be summarily put to death.

276
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:50,181
Any white otticer taken
in command ot Negro troops...

277
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:55,821
shall be deemed as inciting
servile insurrection...

278
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,621
and shall likewise be put to death."

279
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:10,021
Full discharges will be granted
in the morning...

280
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,021
to all those who apply.

281
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:17,821
Dismissed.

282
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,221
It you're not here in the morning...

283
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:26,221
I understand.

284
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:36,741
Still want that blue suit, nigger?

285
00:27:57,101 --> 00:28:00,741
- Good morning, Major.
- Sir! Formed and ready, sir.

286
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:02,741
How many are lett?

287
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:08,821
Attention!

288
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:12,101
Battalion!

289
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:32,421
Glory hallelujah.

290
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,541
Company, halt!

291
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:47,221
You're not dismissed, boy-o!
Get up!

292
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:52,181
You'll tall out when I say
and not betore. Understand? Get up!

293
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,581
Sergeant Major.

294
00:29:03,461 --> 00:29:05,781
- Sir!
- At ease, Sergeant.

295
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,541
I have no doubt
that you are a fair man, Mulcahy.

296
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,661
I wonder if you are
treating these men too hard.

297
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:22,021
You disagree.

298
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:27,461
- You may speak treely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?

299
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,501
We grew up together, yes.

300
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:33,381
Let him grow up some more.

301
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:38,501
- I see.
- Will that be all, sir?

302
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,421
Dismissed.

303
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:08,061
.57 caliber Entield ritle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.

304
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,661
Sharts.

305
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,861
One, one, nine, one, one.

306
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,701
Can you handle that?

307
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,701
I can knock something down
with this.

308
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,221
Trip.

309
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:21,821
One, two, one, nine, two.

310
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,221
- Beautitul.
- Hawkins.

311
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:28,381
One, two, one, eight, six.

312
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,861
- Jefterson.
- Yes, sir!

313
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:32,861
Robert.

314
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:37,741
Finally.
There's a rumor going around...

315
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:40,461
that we're to be used
only for manual labor.

316
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,461
I can't believe the things we hear.

317
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:48,941
lt's not true, is it? I mean,
about not being allowed to tight.

318
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,981
The men are living tor that day.

319
00:30:51,061 --> 00:30:53,021
I know l am.

320
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,821
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.

321
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:01,781
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.

322
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,421
For God's sake, come on!

323
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:35,901
- Good shot!
- Do that again!

324
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,741
Give him your weapon.
Do that again.

325
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:42,821
- One dime he can't do it.
- Dime on each ot you!

326
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,421
That's a bet!
Go on, boy.

327
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:47,501
Go ahead, Sharts.

328
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:56,381
- That's a dime on each ot you!
- Double or nothing!

329
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:01,661
Attention, company!

330
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:05,141
Attention, company!

331
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:07,661
As you were.

332
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:09,661
Front and center.

333
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:16,741
You are a good shot, Private.

334
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:19,061
Thank you, sir.
Squirrel hunting.

335
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:24,621
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.

336
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,141
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.

337
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:31,541
Reload.

338
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:40,381
Faster.

339
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:44,421
Faster.

340
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:53,381
Discharge your weapon.

341
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,741
Discharge your weapon.

342
00:32:57,661 --> 00:33:00,141
Do it!

343
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:04,581
Now, do it again. Only this time,
I want it done quickly.

344
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:10,821
A good man can fire three aimed shots
in a minute.

345
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:16,501
Major Forbes, give me
your Colt revolver.

346
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:18,501
- What?
- Your gun.

347
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:21,661
Give it to me.

348
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:27,661
Faster.

349
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,661
Reload.

350
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:32,741
Quickly. Faster!

351
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:37,501
Faster! Load.

352
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,061
Do it! Do it!

353
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,741
Teach them properly, Major.

354
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,381
Yes, sir.

355
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,141
Attention, company!

356
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,221
Ready!

357
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:21,821
Aim!

358
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:23,941
Fire!

359
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,661
Good morning, Major.
You're up early.

360
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:47,861
I want to talk to you.

361
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:49,861
Certainly.

362
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:54,581
If you wouldn't mind
getting down trom your horse.

363
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:12,461
- Better?
- Why do you treat the men this way?

364
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:17,261
How should I treat them?

365
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:20,061
Like men?

366
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:26,461
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?

367
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:31,701
He's not a very good soldier.
"m getting these men ready tor battle.

368
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:35,541
Robert, they're already as good
as the Seventh ever was.

369
00:35:35,581 --> 00:35:37,181
They march well.
They're disciplined.

370
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,421
- No thanks to you.
- I beg your pardon?

371
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:41,101
You heard me.

372
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:46,261
Who do you think you are,
acting the high-up colonel?

373
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:51,301
You seem to torget I know you
and so does Thomas.

374
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:01,061
If you don't believe in
what we're doing here...

375
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:03,101
maybe you shouldn't be part ot it.

376
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:05,901
Part of what?

377
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:07,581
Huh?

378
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:13,301
Lett, right! Little tinger
along the seams ot your trousers?

379
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:16,381
Marching is probably all
they'll ever get to do, Robert.

380
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:20,981
It is my job...

381
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:23,941
to get these men ready.

382
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,781
And I will.

383
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:31,261
They have risked their lives to be here.
They have given up their freedom.

384
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:36,021
l owe them as much as they have given.
I owe them my freedom...

385
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,661
my lite, if necessary.

386
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:40,741
Maybe so do you, Cabot.

387
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,421
I think you do.

388
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:56,341
Develop! En garde.

389
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,341
Thrust! Develop!

390
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,221
You're not at dancing school!
Take his head otf!

391
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:11,101
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What have we here?

392
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:14,261
Bonny Prince Charlie
and his toy bayonet.

393
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:17,861
You're not reading now.
Go on. Get over!

394
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:20,821
- Now stab me.
- What?

395
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:22,901
Stab me.

396
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:28,581
Come on. Stab! Not tickle.
Hit me!

397
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:31,701
Come on! You prissy schoolgirl!

398
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:33,941
You're the worst soldier
in this company! Hit me!

399
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:47,581
No shame, son. Get up.

400
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:53,541
- I said get up!
- Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.

401
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:57,141
Sergeant, deal with that man.

402
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:06,941
I'll tell you a wee secret, son.
Learn to keep your mouth shut.

403
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,181
Save it, son.
Save it.

404
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:17,581
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcahy.

405
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:19,541
Robert.

406
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:25,621
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment in private, it I may.

407
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:33,381
Enlisted men wishing to speak
to their commanding officer...

408
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:35,381
must first get permission.

409
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:38,301
You understand, Private?

410
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:44,221
Yes, sir.

411
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:50,021
En garde! Thrust! Develop! Recover!

412
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:02,021
You better put some oomph
into that, boy-o!

413
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:11,501
Oh, my, my, my.

414
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:13,901
Some things never change.

415
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:16,901
I guess the whole world
hate the nigger.

416
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,461
Boy, if you don't quit
that drumming in here--

417
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:24,061
Honey, why don't you take your drum
on outside and practice?

418
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:30,621
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.

419
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:34,981
He a swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.

420
00:39:35,061 --> 00:39:37,781
But he in the same boat
with us.

421
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:41,061
Secess' come, take him, kill him too.

422
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:43,141
Huh. Not him.

423
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:44,901
He a swell.

424
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:47,661
He just a boy.

425
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:52,101
He a weak white boy.

426
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,941
Beating on a nigger
make him feel strong.

427
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:58,541
Ain't that right, snowflake?

428
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:03,741
You know, he ain't never been
to no West Point.

429
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:07,781
Onliest reason he in charge
is 'cause his mommy and daddy tixed it.

430
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:09,781
Ain't that so?

431
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:20,181
You thought he was difterent,
didn't you?

432
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:22,181
Hmm?

433
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,381
What you think now?

434
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,421
You just thought you was so smart,
didn't you?

435
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:35,821
You in the real school now, though,
ain't you?

436
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:39,381
What you gonna do? Cry?

437
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:47,541
Yeah. He sure enough learning now,
ain't he?

438
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:52,701
Attention, company!

439
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:55,221
Forward, march!
Right face.

440
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:57,781
Oh, shit.

441
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:03,221
Man say there's a tarm
ain't but two or three miles trom here.

442
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:09,381
Said the lady over there
give him biscuits and gravy.

443
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,861
She said, it he bring his triends,
she feed them too.

444
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:18,861
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, buck?

445
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:22,341
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myselt some real shoes.

446
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:26,261
I'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.

447
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:29,221
Nigger, is you a old man or old woman?
I forget.

448
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,381
All right.

449
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,061
ColIard greens.

450
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,421
Corn bread.

451
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:51,741
Come on. Dream.

452
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:54,981
I'm waiting on you.

453
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:10,261
"Dear Mother. News today
of the defeat at Fredericksburg.

454
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:14,381
If things continue to go badly,
I wonder if l might not end my days...

455
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:17,781
as an outlaw leader
of a band of fugitive slaves.

456
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:22,221
Try as I may,
I don 't know these men...

457
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:24,981
their music, their camaraderie--

458
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:28,021
which is different from ours.

459
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:31,581
I am placed in a position where,
if l were a man of real strength...

460
00:42:31,661 --> 00:42:33,781
I might do a great deal.

461
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:37,141
But I am afraid I shall show
that I'm not of much account.

462
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,941
I don't want to stand in their way
because of my own weakness.

463
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:46,621
I miss Christmas on the Shaw Island
and the smell of the sea. "

464
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:53,261
lt's Thomas.

465
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,661
I just wanted to say--

466
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:08,821
I wanted to say--

467
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:14,581
Merry Christmas, Robert.

468
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,461
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

469
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:00,901
You're Shaw, aren't you?
Merry Christmas.

470
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:02,901
Kendrick, division quartermaster.

471
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:05,341
This sorry piece of work is Haggis.

472
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,061
He writes vouchers.

473
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:08,901
Pleasure.

474
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:13,261
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, very well. Thank you.

475
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:17,421
That's all right. Brass are all up
to Division, planning the next disaster.

476
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:19,741
You're among triends.

477
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:21,901
How much longer do you figure
they'll last?

478
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:24,821
I hear they're deserting
ten at a time.

479
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:28,421
Oh, you're misintormed.
We haven't had a single incident.

480
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:31,101
I tigure the nigs never had it so good.

481
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:33,621
Three square a day,
a root over their heads.

482
00:44:33,701 --> 00:44:37,221
They gotta know nobody's
gonna let them fight. Am I right?

483
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:41,021
Yes, of course.

484
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:44,021
It there's anything you need--

485
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:46,061
a bottle for the cold nights--

486
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:50,021
Actually, I put in a requisition
tor shoes two weeks ago...

487
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:51,901
and I haven't heard anything.

488
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,341
Well, provisionally speaking...

489
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:57,741
we're extremely limited as to tootwear.

490
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,861
That kind ot item has to be reserved...

491
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:03,261
for those units
whose tighting readiness...

492
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:06,341
supersede yours.

493
00:45:06,381 --> 00:45:07,821
You understand.

494
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:13,141
Yes, I understand.

495
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:23,061
- Excuse me.
- Stop by tomorrow.

496
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:27,061
I have got the most delicious
local jam. Myrtle berry, isn't it?

497
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:29,741
- Blueberry.
- Right, right.

498
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:31,541

501
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:51,581
We've caught a deserter.

502
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:08,901
Oh, Lordy, this is bad.

503
00:46:08,981 --> 00:46:11,261
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?

504
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,941
lt'll be all right...

505
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:16,781
won't it?

506
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,741
Re-torm your ranks!

507
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:23,421

509
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,381

00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:43,901
The prisoner is to be tlogged
betore the entire regiment.

514
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:46,301
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.

515
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:51,941
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcahy.
- At your pleasure, Colonel.

516
00:46:56,021 --> 00:47:00,341
Never question my authority
in front ot others.

517
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:02,501

You really think you can keep
700 Union soldiers...

551
00:51:42,221 --> 00:51:44,581
without proper shoes
because you think it's tunny?

552
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:47,381
Where would that power come trom?

553
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:49,621

571
00:53:46,661 --> 00:53:49,421
Attention, battalion!

578
00:54:14,901 --> 00:54:17,141
That ain't tair.

579
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,621

A coIored soldier stop a bullet

590
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:58,541
And for less money too!

591
00:54:58,581 --> 00:55:02,141

If you men will take no pay...

598
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,141
then none of us will.

599

Welcome home, boy.

607
00:58:59,821 --> 00:59:03,101
Don't worry about it, buck.

for the good vittles
and these beautiful clothes.

644
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:22,141
Tell true, old man.
This year, every day like Christmas.

645
01:02:22,221 --> 01:02:24,141
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.

646
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:32,501
My country, 'tis of thee

647
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:36,821
Sweet land of liberty

648
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:40,421
Of thee I sing

649
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:44,861
Land where my father died

650
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:49,261
Land of the pilgrims' pride

651
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:53,261
From every mountainside

652
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:56,901
Let freedom ring

653
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:02,501
Splendid.

654
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:06,021
They've been working for weeks
in anticipation ot your arrival.

655
01:03:06,101 --> 01:03:08,261
We're all very excited
to have you here, Shaw.

656
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:10,941
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.

657
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:15,581
Hired a group ot New Englanders to teach
our colored how to read and write.

658
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:19,221
Just your sort ot people,
I should think.

659
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:22,301
Your regiment should enjoy
their stay here.

660
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:27,301
Yes, "m sure we'll have a fine time,
but that's not why we're here.

661
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:30,901
Yes, well, can't promise you
much action.

662
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:35,221
Just having the coloreds around seems to
have scared the bejesus out of the Rebs.

663
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:37,741
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.

664
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:40,501
I'd like you to meet
some of our instructors.

665
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,701
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.

666
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:44,741
- lt's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- A pleasure.

667
01:03:44,781 --> 01:03:47,381
Dr. Rogers ot Philadelphia.

668
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:51,261
- I know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.

669
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:55,421
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.

670
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:57,621
He's your brigade commander.

671
01:03:57,661 --> 01:03:59,621
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.

672
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:02,821
Colonel Montgomery's
a real jayhawker trom Kansas.

673
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:05,101
Contraband regiment
is his brainchild.

674
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:09,141
You didn't think yours were the only
coIoreds around, did you, Colonel?

675
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,821
I did actually.

676
01:04:10,901 --> 01:04:14,941
Well, "m sure they'll do just tine.
Have they seen any mischief?

677
01:04:15,021 --> 01:04:16,541
No, sir.

678
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:20,581
I'm hiking a company over
to the Georgia coast in the morning.

679
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:25,181
We'll be foraging for supplies.
I could use a hand.

680
01:04:25,221 --> 01:04:27,581
That is, it you think
your men are up to it.

681
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:33,421
- They are indeed, sir.
- Good. Very good.

682
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:36,061
- A pleasure.
- Good night.

683
01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:38,581
Beg to report, Colonel, sir.

684
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,941
The troop is fed
and bedded down for the night, sir.

685
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:45,141
Very good, Corporal.
Pass the word along to "A" Company.

686
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:47,461
We'll be going into action
in the morning.

687
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,421
Very good, sir.

688
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:08,821
Your men march handsomely, Colonel.
My compliments.

689
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:10,341
Thank you, sir.

690
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:13,661
I am surprised at how well
you handle them.

691
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,661
See, I am from Kentucky originally.

692
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:19,861
We owned a few ourselves,
so it comes naturally to me.

693
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:24,541
- You are trom Boston, are you not?
- Yes.

694
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:29,741
It is impossible
to imagine Boston with slaves.

695
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:48,541
Company, halt!

696
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:53,301
- Halt!
- Shoulder arms!

697
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:56,901
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.

698
01:05:56,981 --> 01:05:59,941
Well, alI right!
You hear that, boys?

699
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:02,061
Let's clear her out!

700
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,341
What are you doing?

701
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:10,941
Liberating this town
in the name of the Republic.

702
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:13,661
The musket, Massa Colonel?
Never shoot it. Shoot now?

703
01:06:13,741 --> 01:06:15,861
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Go ahead.

704
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:19,821
Shoot the lady, boys!

705
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:24,901
Don't shoot!
We ain't Secess' here!

706
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,501
That man is a civilian.

707
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:29,221
That man is Secess',
and Secess' is all the same, son.

708
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:40,101
Look around. You really think anybody's
gonna put these boys into real combat?

709
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:42,261
Do you?

710
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,981
They're little children, for God's sake.
They're little monkey children.

711
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:48,861
You just gotta know
how to control them.

712
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:56,221
Please, let go! Oh, God!

713
01:06:57,341 --> 01:06:59,621
You see what I mean?
Children!

714
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:06,101
- Animal! Leave her aIone!
- Hey, boy!

715
01:07:06,181 --> 01:07:07,661
Take your hands oft the white lady!

716
01:07:17,661 --> 01:07:20,581
That would not have been necessary
it that Secess' woman hadn't started it.

717
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,381
They'll never learn.

718
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:26,981
Secess' has got to be
swept away by the hand ot God...

719
01:07:27,021 --> 01:07:29,621
like the Jews of old.

720
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:31,781
And now I'll have to burn this town.

721
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:36,821
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!

722
01:07:39,261 --> 01:07:42,141
TeIl your men to set torches
and prepare to tire the buildings.

723
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:44,301
I will not.

724
01:07:46,101 --> 01:07:48,101
That is an order.

725
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:51,741
You will do it or tace charges
tor disobeying your superior otficer.

726
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:55,661
It is an immoral order, and by articles
ot war I am not bound to obey it.

727
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:58,621
Well, you can just explain that
at your court-marital...

728
01:08:00,021 --> 01:08:02,781
after your men
are placed under my command.

729
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:18,181
First squad, second platoon.

730
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:22,181
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to tire the town.

731
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:25,981
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!

732
01:08:52,981 --> 01:08:55,381
Right face!

733
01:08:58,061 --> 01:09:00,861
Forward march!

734
01:09:00,941 --> 01:09:04,141
The colors, Sergeant Major.

735
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,141
Change the colors.

736
01:09:07,741 --> 01:09:09,381
What you lookin' at,
biscuit eaters?

737
01:09:09,461 --> 01:09:12,301
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?

738
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,301
You ain't nothin'!

739
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:35,581
"Dear Father. I need your help.

740
01:09:38,701 --> 01:09:41,381
Despite my many requests,
it has become clear...

741
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:44,581
that we are to be
used only for manual labor.

742
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,821
Morale is low.

743
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:52,541
The men 's good humor
darkened by idleness and despair.

744
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:57,261
Why keep drilling if they're never given
the opportunity to prove themselves?"

745
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:58,741
Attention!

746
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:02,781
"l have written to Governor Andrew...

747
01:10:02,861 --> 01:10:05,301
as well as to
the General Staff in Washington.

748
01:10:05,341 --> 01:10:08,981
But I feel that only a letter
directly from you to Lincoln himself...

749
01:10:09,061 --> 01:10:11,381
can have the desired effect.

750
01:10:12,461 --> 01:10:14,741
I can think of no other course.

751
01:10:17,221 --> 01:10:19,261
I am sure you both pray,
as I do...

752
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,381
that all this
has not been in vain. "

753
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:24,781
Look like we're goin' the wrong way.

754
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:28,301
Hey. Hey, come on now.
Buck up, boys!

755
01:10:28,381 --> 01:10:30,701
Hey, buck up now! Come on!

756
01:10:30,781 --> 01:10:33,741
Someday they're gonna
let the 54th get into it, see?

757
01:10:33,821 --> 01:10:35,741
And all your troubles
would be over, huh?

758
01:10:35,821 --> 01:10:38,701
Come on now. Cheer up! Hey!

759
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:43,781
- What'd you say, boy?
- "Boy"?

760
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:45,581
- Let me tell you--
- Shut up, Trip--

761
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:47,941
Would you get up off me, snowtlake?

762
01:10:50,021 --> 01:10:52,421
See, let me explain
something to you.

763
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:56,661
The way I tigure, l tigure this war
would be over a whole lot sooner...

764
01:10:56,701 --> 01:11:00,061
it you boys just turn right on around
and head on back down that way...

765
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:02,701
and you let us head on up there
where the real tightin' is.

766
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:04,741
Them men dyin' up that road.

767
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:08,501
It wouldn't be nothin' but Rebs dying,
it they let the 54th in it.

768
01:11:08,581 --> 01:11:10,101
- Listen--
- Hold it!

769
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:14,741
As you were, Trip! As you were!

770
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:18,581
You men move on.

771
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:23,381
Stripes on a nigger.
That's like tits on a bull.

772
01:11:25,221 --> 01:11:28,701
You're lookin' at a higher rank,
Corporal. You'll obey and like it.

773
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:31,621
- Make me.
- I'll make you.

774
01:11:33,221 --> 01:11:36,701
- What the helI is goin' on here?
- Attention!

775
01:11:36,741 --> 01:11:40,781
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.

776
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:43,741
- Ain't no cause tor that, sir.
- What's that, Sergeant?

777
01:11:43,781 --> 01:11:47,781
It's just a soldiers' fight, sir.

778
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,781
- All right. You men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!

779
01:11:53,861 --> 01:11:55,061
Move it!

780
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:59,701
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!

781
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:04,021
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.

782
01:12:04,061 --> 01:12:06,141
Go strum a banjo, boy.

783
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:07,661
Come on.

784
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:15,141
I've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.

785
01:12:18,021 --> 01:12:19,461
Thank you.

786
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:23,941
Yeah, button up that collar.

787
01:12:24,981 --> 01:12:27,421
Suck in that gut.

788
01:12:27,461 --> 01:12:29,581
Tuck in them big black lips.

789
01:12:29,621 --> 01:12:32,541
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.

790
01:12:32,621 --> 01:12:35,061
I don't have to listen to this.

791
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:38,341
Where you goin', boy?

792
01:12:39,501 --> 01:12:43,301
- Let me by.
- Let you by?

793
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:45,701
Let you by?

794
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:49,261
Let me tell you something, boy.

795
01:12:49,341 --> 01:12:52,341
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like 'em.

796
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:55,181
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.

797
01:12:55,221 --> 01:12:58,141
But you ain't never
gonna be nothin' to him...

798
01:12:58,181 --> 01:13:02,341
but an ugly-ass chimp
in a blue suit.

799
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,381
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.

800
01:13:07,781 --> 01:13:11,261
What we gonna do about it?
Want to fight me, boy?

801
01:13:11,301 --> 01:13:14,301
Huh? What you gonna
do about it?

802
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:20,261
You want to fight me, don't you?
Don't you?

803
01:13:24,621 --> 01:13:26,741
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!

804
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:28,541
Get your hands otf me,
gravedigger.

805
01:13:28,581 --> 01:13:30,981
Goddamn it. Does the whole world
gotta stomp in your face?

806
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:34,261
- Nigger, get your hands ott me.
- Ain't no niggers here.

807
01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:36,701
So the white man give you
a couple ot stripes...

808
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:39,221
next thing you know, you hollerin'
and orderin' everybody around...

809
01:13:39,261 --> 01:13:40,901
like you the massa himself.

810
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:43,821
Nigger, you ain't nothin'
but the white man's dog.

811
01:13:45,981 --> 01:13:47,901
And what are you?

812
01:13:47,981 --> 01:13:50,741
So full ot hate
you wanna fight everybody...

813
01:13:50,821 --> 01:13:53,221
'cause you've been whipped
and chased by hounds.

814
01:13:53,301 --> 01:13:55,821
That might not be livin',
but it sure ain't dyin'.

815
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:59,981
And dying's what these white boys
been doin' tor goin' on three years now.

816
01:14:00,021 --> 01:14:03,461
Dyin' by the thousands.
Dyin' for you, tool!

817
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:05,781
I know, 'cause l dug the graves.

818
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:08,101
And all the time "m diggin',
"m asking myselt, "When?

819
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:10,261
When, O Lord,
is it gonna be our time?"

820
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:14,021
Time's comin' when
we're gonna have to ante up.

821
01:14:14,061 --> 01:14:17,661
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!

822
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,381
You watch who you call a nigger.

823
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:24,301
It there's any niggers around here,
it's you.

824
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:28,141
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass,
swamp-running nigger.

825
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:30,461
It you ain't careful,
that's all you ever gonna be.

826
01:14:34,341 --> 01:14:37,181
You men go on back to business.

827
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:01,701
Ah, Shaw.

828
01:15:03,421 --> 01:15:04,861
Sit down.

829
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:14,261
Well, Colonel,
what can I do for you?

830
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:19,021
You can give me and my regiment
a transter to combat command.

831
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:21,701
Couldn't do it, Colonel.

832
01:15:21,781 --> 01:15:24,261
You're much too valuable
to my operations here.

833
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:39,421
May I sit?

834
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:43,261
Thank you. Major.

835
01:15:53,061 --> 01:15:55,141
I've written a letter
to my father...

836
01:15:56,381 --> 01:16:00,741
asking him to press Governor Andrew
and President Lincoln.

837
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:03,221
But I don't have to wait
for all that, do l?

838
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:09,381
Colonel Montgomery, would you
bring that ashtray over here?

839
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,901
But valuable to your operations here,
do you say?

840
01:16:15,981 --> 01:16:19,301
Your foraging,
your depredations?

841
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:24,021
Yes, "ve become quite a student
ot your operations in this region.

842
01:16:24,061 --> 01:16:27,141
Thirty-four mansions,
I think it was, pillaged and burned...

843
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:30,941
under Colonel Montgomery's expedition
of the Combahee.

844
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:34,941
Four thousand bales of cotton
smuggled through the lines...

845
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:37,101
with payment to parties unknown...

846
01:16:37,141 --> 01:16:39,701
except by you.

847
01:16:39,741 --> 01:16:43,621
False quartermaster requisitions.
Major Forbes here has seen the copies.

848
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:45,621
Yes, indeed.

849
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:50,381
Along with confiscated valuables
shipped north as personal baggage.

850
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:53,541
Shall I go on?

851
01:16:54,621 --> 01:16:56,101
Can you?

852
01:16:58,461 --> 01:17:01,421
I can report you
to the War Department.

853
01:17:02,461 --> 01:17:05,981
Oh, yes. I can do that.

854
01:17:13,781 --> 01:17:18,621
Let you take your regiment
out to fight?

855
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:24,901
That's what you want, isn't it?
Show what they can do.

856
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:29,341
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?

857
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:31,221
When?

858
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:37,541
Just as soon as
I can write the orders.

859
01:17:41,901 --> 01:17:43,301
Major.

860
01:17:55,141 --> 01:17:56,581
Double-quick!

861
01:18:02,821 --> 01:18:07,061
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!

862
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:11,181
All right, men, form a tiring line.
Over here.

863
01:18:11,261 --> 01:18:13,941
Form a tiring line right here!

864
01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:28,301
Front rank, kneel!

Cease tire! Recover!

872

Pour it in!

882
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:37,381
Charge!

883
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:51,981
Look out, boy! Look out!

884
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:11,301
Fire!

885
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:26,941
They're turnin' tail!

886
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,901
Run, you Rebs!

887
01:22:44,661 --> 01:22:46,581
Deploy skirmishers, Captain.

888
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:50,061
Re-torm your ranks!
Re-form your ranks!

889
01:23:04,101 --> 01:23:06,821
Fall in! On the double!

890
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:11,301
- Form Company.
- Thomas!

891
01:23:17,941 --> 01:23:19,741
How do, CoIonel?

892
01:23:21,181 --> 01:23:22,701
Hurts, doesn't it?

893
01:23:25,581 --> 01:23:27,541
Well, "m extremely jealous.

894
01:23:27,621 --> 01:23:31,021
You'll be back in Boston before me,
sitting by the tire...

895
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:34,301
reading Hawthorne,
cup of decent coftee.

896
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:36,061
I'm not going back.

897
01:23:37,621 --> 01:23:42,421
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.

898
01:23:45,741 --> 01:23:49,381
Robert, promise me...

899
01:23:49,461 --> 01:23:52,541
that you won't send me back.

900
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:56,781
Promise me!

901
01:23:58,981 --> 01:24:03,061
All right. All right.

902
01:24:28,701 --> 01:24:30,141
Colonel Shaw!

903
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:32,381
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?

904
01:24:32,461 --> 01:24:35,861
Lee was turned back in Pennsylvania
at Gettysburg...

905
01:24:35,941 --> 01:24:39,221
now Grant's taken Vicksburg,
and alI on the Fourth of July.

906
01:24:39,261 --> 01:24:41,221
- My God!
- Yeah!

907
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:43,981
It looks like it'll all be over
by Christmas.

908
01:24:44,061 --> 01:24:46,701
- So, how did they do?
- SpIendid. Just splendid.

909
01:24:46,741 --> 01:24:49,301
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.

910
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:52,461
Give me the details.
I'll wire it in.

911
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:54,661
I don't think we got
a prayer ot making the paper.

912
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:56,901
I'll talk to you later
in your tent.

913
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:15,421
As you were.

914
01:25:20,501 --> 01:25:24,301
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

915
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:29,101
You fought very well
yesterday, Trip.

916
01:25:29,141 --> 01:25:33,701
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended
that you receive a commendation.

917
01:25:33,781 --> 01:25:35,741
Yes, sir?

918
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:39,821
Yes, and I think you should bear
the regimental colors.

919
01:25:43,661 --> 01:25:45,301
Well--

920
01:25:46,381 --> 01:25:48,061
lt's considered quite an honor.

921
01:25:52,261 --> 01:25:53,381
Why not?

922
01:25:59,581 --> 01:26:01,581
Well, "m...

923
01:26:04,221 --> 01:26:06,981
wantin' to say somethin', sir,
but l--

924
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:10,341
Go ahead.

925
01:26:12,941 --> 01:26:15,221
AIl right. See--

926
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:23,461
I ain't tightin' this war
tor you, sir.

927
01:26:25,261 --> 01:26:26,701
I see.

928
01:26:28,501 --> 01:26:31,381
I mean, what's the point?

929
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:33,621
Ain't nobody gonna win.
lt's just gonna go on and on.

930
01:26:33,701 --> 01:26:36,461
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.

931
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:38,461
Somebody's gonna win.

932
01:26:40,741 --> 01:26:42,981
Who?

933
01:26:43,061 --> 01:26:47,861
I mean, you get to go on back
to Boston to a big house and all that.

934
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:53,421
What about us?
What do we get?

935
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:00,981
Well, you won't get anything
it we lose.

936
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:10,141
What do you want to do?

937
01:27:12,181 --> 01:27:13,621
I don't know, sir.

938
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:17,221
It stinks, I suppose.

939
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:21,301
Yeah, it stinks bad.

940
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:24,981
And we all covered up in it.
Ain't nobody clean.

941
01:27:31,101 --> 01:27:33,941
Be nice to get clean though.

942
01:27:35,581 --> 01:27:37,181
How do we do that?

943
01:27:43,261 --> 01:27:46,101
We ante up and kick in, sir.

944
01:27:48,821 --> 01:27:52,021
But I still don't
wanna carry your tlag.

945
01:27:56,981 --> 01:27:58,941
No one will ever take Charleston
without tirst...

946
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:01,941
silencing the torts
which protect its harbor.

947
01:28:02,021 --> 01:28:06,261
And the first one that must
be taken is that, Fort Wagner.

948
01:28:08,941 --> 01:28:11,461
Wagner mounts a ten-inch Columbiad...

949
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:14,181
three smoothbore 32-pounders...

950
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:16,621
a 42-pound Carronade...

951
01:28:16,701 --> 01:28:21,701
a 10-inch Coast Mortar
and tour 12-pound Howitzers...

952
01:28:21,781 --> 01:28:25,221
plus a garrison
of about a thousand men.

953
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:27,821
As many ot you gentlemen
may be aware...

954
01:28:27,901 --> 01:28:31,221
for the last tour days
our navy has weakened Wagner...

955
01:28:31,261 --> 01:28:33,301
with a constant barrage.

956
01:28:33,381 --> 01:28:36,821
Headquarters has determined a time
for our attack.

957
01:28:36,901 --> 01:28:42,501
We will proceed with a direct
trontal assault tomorrow at dusk.

958
01:28:42,581 --> 01:28:46,101
The problem, gentlemen,
is the approach.

959
01:28:46,141 --> 01:28:48,741
The ocean and the marsh
leave only a narrow strip ot sand...

960
01:28:48,821 --> 01:28:53,061
a natural defile, through which we can
only send one regiment at a time.

961
01:28:53,141 --> 01:28:56,661
Our best hope is that that leading
regiment can keep the Rebs occupied...

962
01:28:56,741 --> 01:29:00,181
long enough for reintorcements
to exploit the breach.

963
01:29:00,221 --> 01:29:05,901
Needless to say, casualties
in the leading regiment may be extreme.

964
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:08,741
General Strong.

965
01:29:11,381 --> 01:29:13,861
The 54th Massachusetts...

966
01:29:13,901 --> 01:29:16,941
requests the honor ot leading
the attack on Fort Wagner.

967
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:28,461
lt's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?

968
01:29:29,181 --> 01:29:30,621
Yes, sir.

969
01:29:31,581 --> 01:29:33,941
You and your men
haven't slept tor two days.

970
01:29:35,781 --> 01:29:37,221
That's right, sir.

971
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:39,861
And you think they have the strength
to lead this charge?

972
01:29:44,381 --> 01:29:47,461
There's more to fighting
than rest, sir.

973
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:50,701
There's character.

974
01:29:51,741 --> 01:29:53,821
There's strength ot heart.

975
01:29:57,301 --> 01:30:01,621
You should have seen us
in action two days ago.

976
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:03,981
We were a sight to see.

977
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:08,981
We'll be ready, sir.

978
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:12,341
When do you want us?

979
01:30:31,661 --> 01:30:35,221
O Lord, O Lord

980
01:30:35,261 --> 01:30:38,541
Lord, Lord, Lord

981
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:45,061
He packed in the animals
two by two

982
01:30:45,101 --> 01:30:47,821
An ox, a camel and a kangaroo

983
01:30:47,861 --> 01:30:50,461
Packed them in that ark so tight

984
01:30:50,501 --> 01:30:53,701
I couldn't get no sleep that night

985
01:30:53,741 --> 01:30:56,221
Grown-up sons
Shem and Ham

986
01:30:56,301 --> 01:30:58,501
Tell me about God's master plan

987
01:30:59,981 --> 01:31:05,501
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

988
01:31:25,461 --> 01:31:30,021
- Tomorrow we goin' to battle.
- All right.

989
01:31:30,101 --> 01:31:34,741
So, Lordy, let me fight
with the ritle in one hand...

990
01:31:34,821 --> 01:31:36,861
and the Good Book in the other.

991
01:31:36,941 --> 01:31:39,581
- Yeah!
- Amen!

992
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:46,221
That if I should die
at the muzzle of the ritle...

993
01:31:46,261 --> 01:31:51,141
die on water or on land...

994
01:31:51,221 --> 01:31:56,581
I may know that You,
blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.

995
01:31:56,661 --> 01:31:58,381
With Jesus!

996
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:03,741
And I have no fear. Amen.

997
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:10,461
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

998
01:32:23,421 --> 01:32:27,781
Lord, we stand betore You
this evenin'...

999
01:32:27,861 --> 01:32:30,421
to say thank you.

1000
01:32:30,501 --> 01:32:34,101
We thank You, Father,
tor Your grace...

1001
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:36,741
and Your many blessings.

1002
01:32:36,781 --> 01:32:39,141

and lett all my young'uns
and my kinfolk in bondage.

1004

among those that are fightin'
against our oppression!

1013
01:33:16,581 --> 01:33:20,301
We want 'em to know, Heavenly Father,
that we died for freedom.

1014

We ask these blessings

1015

- Trip! Come on!

1016
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:45,541
You better get

Go on. Let it out.

01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:02,781
I ain't much

1044
01:38:49,901 --> 01:38:51,981
I wonder if you might

1045

Personal things.
