1
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:05,165
Ah! We made it.

2
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,043
<i>I gotta go, I gotta go!
I gotta go!</i>

3
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:16,083
Last one out's
a rotten cheese!

4
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:23,007
Just breathe that air!
Very Alpsy.

5
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,450
Look! Look! Horses!

6
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,810
Let's go riding!
Can we please?

7
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:29,082
Can we?

8
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,165
Chelsea, chill. We've got all
month to ride the horses.

9
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:33,285
Whoa!

10
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,281
I know! It's the Matterhorn!
Isn't it amazing?

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,640
No, I mean this LCD screen!

12
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,801
Thirty-three megapixel resolution
with 24.7 million colors!

13
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,404
It's like we're there!

14
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,520
Skipper, we are there.

15
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,446
Oh, yeah. Nice mountains.

16
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,887
But on this baby
I can zoom in!

17
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,439
Barbie!

18
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,522
Aunt Marlene!

19
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:56,558
Skipper!

20
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,523
Stacie!

21
00:02:58,597 --> 00:02:59,645
Chelsea!

22
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:02,363
Welcome to the Alpine 
Riding Academy!

23
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,563
Hello, Barbie.

24
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:09,404
- Hello, Max.
- Barbie!

25
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,523
Whoa!

26
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:11,600
Oh, Marie!

27
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:14,236
Hi, Marie!
You're really here!

28
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:18,519
Please excuse my sister.
She was raised by squirrels.

29
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:20,280
lam so glad you're all here!

30
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:22,196
Please, come inside.

31
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:27,522
Barbie, I love the hand-tooled detail
on your luggage. It's awfully smart.

32
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:28,521
Thanks.

33
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:30,275
I got a suitcase just like it!

34
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:32,274
Except mine is covered
with scorpions.

35
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,920
Get out of the way!

36
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:43,518
Ooh!

37
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,116
This is it.

38
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:48,360
The flowers were my little touch.

39
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,679
And I picked off most of the bugs.

40
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:52,871
Most of the bugs?

41
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, and I put sweets on all of your
pillows, just like in a hotel!

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,510
Oh, 'course, that was three days ago

43
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,076
and some of them melted,
and Popcorn ate the rest,

44
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,754
but you can still smell them
when you sleep.

45
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,389
Thank you, children.
Popcorn!

46
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,714
Now back to your chores.

47
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,152
I got dibs on the top bunk!

48
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,349
No, me!

49
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,068
One, two, three, shoot.

50
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,275
Yes!
No!

51
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:25,675
The room's perfect, Aunt Marlene.
And I can't wait to find my horse!

52
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:28,586
Your champion horse!
Barbie's gonna win

53
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,315
the Pacific Steeplechase with it!

54
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:32,747
Well, I don't know about that.

55
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:34,230
Of course you'll win.

56
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,546
You're only the best rider
on the West Coast.

57
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:40,347
Thanks, but that depends a lot
on finding just the right horse.

58
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:43,150
The horse of your dreams, hmm?

59
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:44,625
Every rider has one.

60
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,153
Something like that.

61
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:50,789
Well, I believe we raise the finest jumping
horses in all of Switzerland.

62
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,544
I'm certain you'll find one
here that is to your liking.

63
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:55,871
Have you got one
that looks like this?

64
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,945
My, that's quite a horse.

65
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:01,103
Isn't it?

66
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:03,142
I hope I brought enough glitter.

67
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:04,823
When can we get started?

68
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:05,981
How about now?

69
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:07,066
Yay!
Woo-hoo!

70
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,310
Let's go!

71
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,586
Skipper? Don't you want
to see the horses, too?

72
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,908
You guys go ahead.
I need to update my blog.

73
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:18,904
You used to love horses. When you were
younger we couldn't get you off them.

74
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,940
Well, I guess people change.

75
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,226
And right now, all my peeps are at
Tech-Con, trying out the latest gear,

76
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,064
while I'm stuck here
listening to cows yodel.

77
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:38,498
So, first time on a horse, is it?

78
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:40,059
Yeah, it's my first,

79
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:43,257
but it won't take me long to
ace it, like I do every sport.

80
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:46,338
Still, you might want
to go slowly at first.

81
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,864
Thanks, but not too slow.

82
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,176
Did I mention I'm kind of
a natural jock?

83
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:54,460
Yes. We caught it the first time.

84
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,536
We'll match Chelsea and Stacie
with their horses first.

85
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,699
Girls, meet your teachers.

86
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:07,456
Ooh, I want that one! Or that one!
Can I have two?

87
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:08,975
Can we pick whichever horse 
we want?

88
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:12,936
No, no, cherie. The beginning
riders never pick their horses.

89
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:15,622
Huh?
The horses pick you.

90
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,620
Excuse me?

91
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:18,652
<i>You'll see.</i>

92
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,817
Step into the corral and...

93
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,659
Then stand really still.

94
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,730
Aw.

95
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,053
It's okay, Chels.

96
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,208
Looks like you've got
a new bestie, Stace.

97
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:57,528
What's her name?

98
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:00,329
Stacie, meet Pepper.

99
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:02,808
Nice to meet you, Pepper.

100
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:19,445
Aw.

101
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:30,288
It looks like you, too, 
have been chosen, Chelsea.

102
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:32,411
Meet Dash.

103
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:39,842
Where's the rest of her?

104
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,683
I'm afraid that's all there is.

105
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:44,087
But Dash is a very sweet pony.

106
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,766
And she seems to really like you.

107
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,283
But she's so little.

108
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:51,126
Why can't I have a big horse 
like Stacie's?

109
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:52,970
Chelsea, give Dash a chance.

110
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,408
There'll be plenty of time
for big horses

111
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,801
when you're a little bigger.

112
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,124
Hmm.

113
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:01,360
Catastrophe!
Disaster! Calamity!

114
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,524
<i>C'est choquant,
quelle horreur!</i>

115
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,207
Madame Marlene,

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,602
we are ruined!

117
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,560
What is it this time, Etienne?

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,564
Look at these fly bonnets!

119
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,078
Just look at them!

120
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,243
So?
"So?" I ordered them in aubergine

121
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,805
to match the halters!
But look! Look!

122
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,721
Would you call that aubergine? 
Hmm?

123
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,756
Um, no?

124
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:29,958
He has a point.
That is so not aubergine.

125
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:33,276
You see? The child is
clearly offended!

126
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:37,884
How are we supposed to win a
tournament with clashing fly bonnets?

127
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,563
Even the flies will
be laughing at us!

128
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,522
Tournament? I like the sound of that.

129
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:47,315
The annual tournament between our academy
and all the other local riding schools.

130
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,562
And the prize money is substantial.
This year we're hosting.

131
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:55,043
But not if our horses are
too embarrassed to take the field!

132
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:56,640
I'd better take care of this.

133
00:08:57,114 --> 00:09:00,200
Max, Marie, you get
Stacie and Chelsea started.

134
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,673
Barbie, you of course
may choose your own horse.

135
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:05,597
Look over the thoroughbreds
in the stable.

136
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,992
Every one's a prize jumper.

137
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:13,320
Did you see the stitching? I specifically
asked for a cross-hatch stitch.

138
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,959
This is not a cross
or even a hatch...

139
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,190
Who was that?

140
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,711
That was Monsieur Etienne,
our riding master.

141
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:25,798
Is he always like that?
Like he just bit into a lemon.

142
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,233
Pretty much.
He's a good teacher, though.

143
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:31,637
Go!

144
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:35,109
Come on, girl!
Good girl.

145
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,069
She's all yours.

146
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:38,629
Hmph.

147
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:40,992
Okay! So how do I get on this thing?

148
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:45,269
Ah, yes! Well, before we begin, I thought
it might be instructive to review

149
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:48,709
the history of the English,
or eventing, saddle.

150
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,750
Is that necessar...

151
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:54,274
Here you'll see the gullet, the
cantle, the girth buckle, the...

152
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,069
What my brother's trying to say is,

153
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,866
stick your foot in here and
throw your leg over the horse.

154
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,944
That's the big thing right there.

155
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,512
Got it. Thanks.

156
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,945
Right. Of course. Who needs four
hundred years of tradition?

157
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:08,671
Fine. Just jump on
and kick her into drive.

158
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:13,183
Wait!

159
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:16,312
First time on a horse?
Definitely video-worthy.

160
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:20,431
Look at that style,
that confident approach!

161
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:26,352
"As the future champion approaches, the
animal humbly yields to its new master."

162
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:28,868
Whoa!

163
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:35,181
Look! Alpine has a new trick rider!

164
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:36,830
What do you call that move?

165
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,380
"The mud dive?"

166
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:41,900
Whoa!

167
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:48,183
Hey, Marie, if that's 
your best rider,

168
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,383
our winning streak
seems pretty safe!

169
00:10:56,377 --> 00:11:01,027
Hey, if you're looking up "world's
greatest rider," I'm right here.

170
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:05,902
Actually, I was just looking
up "doofus." See, right here.

171
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,221
She got you good, Jonas!

172
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,297
How droll.

173
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:17,259
Don't mind them.

174
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:20,221
<i>They're from Ecole Montagne, the
riding school just down the road.</i>

175
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:23,540
They're just trying to get under our
skin, with the tournament coming up.

176
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:27,015
'Course, it doesn't really matter.
We always lose anyway.

177
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:28,738
Usually to them.

178
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,062
You never know.
This year could be different.

179
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:34,417
Statistically speaking, we're
bound to win within... Hmm...

180
00:11:34,813 --> 00:11:36,341
Sixty-three years.

181
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:40,454
Now that I'm on the team,
we'll cream those creeps!

182
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:42,140
Whoa! Ugh!

183
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:44,976
Yep.

184
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,296
Classic.

185
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,449
Why, hello, Sebastian.

186
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,849
Hello, Popcorn.

187
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:43,453
Now, run along.

188
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:46,772
Sorry that took so long, 
Barbie dear.

189
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:48,844
Monsieur Etienne can be a bit...

190
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,409
Temperamental at times.

191
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,009
I noticed.

192
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:56,412
He's worth it. We're hoping he can
lead us to our first tournament win

193
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:57,683
in 11 years.

194
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,047
I'm sure you've got
lots of good riders.

195
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,084
We did once,

196
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:06,131
but frankly, enrollment has been
incredibly low these last few years.

197
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:09,689
So have you found
your horse yet?

198
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,530
Every one in this group is
from champion stock.

199
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,529
I'm just not sure.

200
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,645
This one seems nice.

201
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,881
Ah, Finian.
Excellent choice!

202
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:26,448
His sire was winner
of the Virginia Gold Cup,

203
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,363
so he'll be right
at home in America.

204
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,759
You two would make
an excellent team.

205
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:34,006
Hmmm... Maybe.

206
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:52,283
Ugh.

207
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:54,519
Ugh.

208
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:02,844
Ahh!

209
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,923
Huh? Oh, a goat.
What's that?

210
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:08,999
Oh, no, you don't,
you grabby goat!

211
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:15,718
Wakey wakey!

212
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,160
Oh, hi, Barnaby.

213
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:20,318
You know him?
He's eating my blanket!

214
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:23,753
Yes, he likes wool. Last
week he ate all my socks.

215
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,959
It's a miracle he's still alive.

216
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:35,032
Breakfast in twenty minutes!
Hope you like Kartoffelkuchen.

217
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,678
No, no, no, no,
no, no, mamselle.

218
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,157
We swoop with the curry comb,
not attack. Hmm?

219
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,509
Long curving motions...

220
00:14:56,988 --> 00:15:00,348
Comme ca...
And swoop, oui?

221
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,151
And swoop, yes?

222
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:05,753
Bend the knees and swoop!

223
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,795
Got it. Swoop.
Swoop. Bend...

224
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:10,026
Hey!

225
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,390
Gimme a break!
I'm new at swooping!

226
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:17,670
Perfect! Dash, you're going
to be so pretty!

227
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:19,670
Don't you think so, Chels?

228
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,473
Oh!

229
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:30,267
I can't wait to get out
and feel the wind in my hair.

230
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:33,827
Ah...

231
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:35,628
Yipee-ka-yay.

232
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:43,949
Ow!

233
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:45,505
O-W.

234
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:48,021
Hyah!

235
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:53,385
Ah. Ah. Reign back,
Mademoiselle Barbie!

236
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:55,784
No faster than a walk, please.

237
00:15:55,861 --> 00:16:00,302
<i>We must make certain everyone is
riding at the same pace, n'est-ce pas?</i>

238
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,219
Whoa!

239
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:21,702
Skipper, Stacie.
Did you see that?

240
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,061
See what?
That horse!

241
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,105
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:31,017
I guess... Nothing.

243
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:34,296
Nothing at all.

244
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:39,097
- Any dessert? Anything to eat?
- No more for me!

245
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:41,779
Anybody like a cup of tea? 
Yes?

246
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,824
Now tell me the truth, Barnaby.

247
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,095
Doesn't clover taste 
better than wool?

248
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:50,898
I'm glad you agree.

249
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,577
That's the horse!

250
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:10,132
<i>Elle fait des gateaux</i>

251
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:12,739
<i>Papa est en bas</i>

252
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:15,851
<i>Il fait du chocolat</i>

253
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:19,617
<i>Fais do do, Reynaud</i>

254
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,014
<i>Mon petit frere</i>

255
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,890
<i>Fais do do</i>

256
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,738
<i>T'auras du lolo</i>

257
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,169
Oh. Mademoiselle Barbie,
you startled me!

258
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,891
I'm sorry. I was enjoying 
your singing.

259
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,168
So was Reynaud.

260
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:43,052
Oh, ha, um, it is nothing.
it calms him down.

261
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:47,050
Monsieur Etienne,
may I ask you a question?

262
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,815
About the academy logo?

263
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:50,410
Logo?

264
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,373
You know, the sign
in front? The horse.

265
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,007
Ah, that.

266
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,454
What can I say?
It is a horse.

267
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:01,925
Well, yes, of course. But a very
unusual horse, wouldn't you say?

268
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,608
I mean, those markings.

269
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:05,450
Why the interest?

270
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:10,525
It's just I don't know, I feel like
I've seen that horse somewhere.

271
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:13,443
That is highly doubtful.

272
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,443
The horse you speak
of does not exist.

273
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,691
It doesn't?
But, the sign...

274
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:23,728
ls of a fable of an ancient
herd called, "The Majestique."

275
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,927
They were said to roam wild
somewhere in these mountains.

276
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:30,329
The story is that
they are descended from a

277
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:34,003
breed created over a
thousand years ago,

278
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:38,085
<i>especially for the princesses
of the Kieburg royalty</i>

279
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,648
<i>and fiercely loyal to them.</i>

280
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,921
<i>They protected them from harm,
and the princesses were just</i>

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,564
<i>as devoted and protective
of them.</i>

282
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:50,567
<i>A strong fearless breed.</i>

283
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,000
<i>They were said to have
such superb jumping skill,</i>

284
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:59,318
<i>that they almost
seemed to fly.</i>

285
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:07,598
<i>They are known by the strange
pink streak in their manes.</i>

286
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:11,845
<i>The smartest, the fastest, the
bravest horses ever known to man!</i>

287
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,676
Many doubt that they
were ever real,

288
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:21,484
since none has ever been
caught, or even photographed.

289
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,438
But what about the painting?

290
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:25,762
Hmm. What of it?

291
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:29,883
There are also paintings
of fairies and mermaids, non?

292
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:33,435
So, you don't think the
Majestique horses are real?

293
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:34,872
Mmm...

294
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:37,914
Once,
when I was a child,

295
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:40,158
I thought I saw...

296
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:41,679
Nonsense!

297
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,074
Foolish twaddle!

298
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:46,153
You have always believed
in fairy tales, Etienne.

299
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,752
Philippe! How dare
you defile my stable!

300
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,237
You, you festering boil
on a baboon's backside!

301
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,110
And you are the hair
of a pig's nostril!

302
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,352
I spit on the toe of your uncle!

303
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,914
I stuff your nose
with cabbages!

304
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,835
Uh, hi, my name's Barbie.

305
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,198
I gather you two know each other.

306
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,434
Excusez-moi, mademoiselle.

307
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:14,074
I am Monsieur Philippe, riding master
extraordinaire of L'Ecole Montagne.

308
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:15,797
Enchante.

309
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,390
I speak up, only because
this pig of a dog of a mule,

310
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,549
fills your head with
phooey-hooey.

311
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,275
There is no such breed as the
Majestique and there never was.

312
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,272
No horse is that remarkable.

313
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,910
They are merely dumb beasts,
meant to serve their masters.

314
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,875
And fear the riding crop!

315
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:40,914
But why do you ask
about Majestiques?

316
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:42,145
Have you...

317
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:44,629
Seen something?

318
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:46,633
Me? Um. er...

319
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:50,272
How could I see something
that doesn't exist?

320
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:56,509
Yes. Of course.
Utter foolishness!

321
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:59,669
Etienne, it is chilly.

322
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:01,586
Maman says to wear your sweater.

323
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:04,145
Tell her the soup was yummy.

324
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,705
And how was the baguette?

325
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,430
I did not receive a baguette.

326
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:08,462
Exactly.

327
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:42,058
Hmm.

328
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:44,579
Come on, Finian.
Let's go home.

329
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:56,944
What is it?

330
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,536
Whoa!

331
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,022
Finian, come back!

332
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:11,293
Oh, boy.

333
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:11,526
So you are real!

334
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,091
I knew it!

335
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:16,527
Thank you.

336
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,364
Hmm, my hero.

337
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:34,928
Again.

338
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:36,923
Straighten up, mamselle Stacie.

339
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,530
Legs pressed together,
weight forward.

340
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:44,642
<i>Ah, tres bien.</i>

341
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:48,407
Now pull your horse
back to a walk, then stop.

342
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,001
Whoa.

343
00:23:51,202 --> 00:23:52,162
Whoa!

344
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,161
Whoa, whoa!

345
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:55,888
Don't you know how to whoa?

346
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,843
<i>Non, non, non, mamselle.
We do not yank the reins.</i>

347
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,125
You will only make her...

348
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,644
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

349
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,202
<i>Oh, les enfants.</i>

350
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:14,599
Aunt Marlene,

351
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:16,366
I need a new horse.

352
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,125
Mine is busted.

353
00:24:18,478 --> 00:24:20,846
No, Stacie, Pepper is your horse,

354
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,802
and she chose you for a reason.

355
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:25,682
Yeah, 'cause she craves
my public humiliation.

356
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,965
She won't do anything
I tell her to.

357
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:29,398
Of course she will...

358
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:31,484
When she wants to.

359
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:45,556
Hiya!

360
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,192
Hiya!

361
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,274
I know you're here somewhere...

362
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,350
It's all right.

363
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:02,154
Everything's going
to be just fine.

364
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:05,467
Let me help you, okay?

365
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:09,113
Wow, you really did get
stuck, didn't you?

366
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:11,668
That must hurt.

367
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,385
Easy girl, easy.

368
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:16,823
That's it.

369
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,982
<i>Fais do do</i>

370
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,225
<i>T'auras du Iolo</i>

371
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:31,949
<i>Fais do do</i>

372
00:26:32,582 --> 00:26:35,702
<i>Ma petite soeur</i>

373
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:37,866
<i>Fais do do</i>

374
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,506
<i>T'auras du lolo</i>

375
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,258
Oh, you're bleeding.

376
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:06,502
I just want to help you.

377
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,098
It's okay.

378
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:22,896
I owe you this for the wolves.

379
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:29,734
You're so majestic.

380
00:27:30,455 --> 00:27:32,734
I think I'll call you...

381
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:34,735
Majesty-

382
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:41,098
Okay, one more, Barnaby.

383
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:43,253
And this time a little
more presidential.

384
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,136
Hey, tech girl!

385
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:49,696
Ever put that
thing down?

386
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:52,535
Oh look, Barnaby,
you have a visitor.

387
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:56,378
Did you come to have your
official portrait taken,

388
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,539
monkey DOV?

389
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,660
Ohh! That one will
look good on a baboon.

390
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:03,095
Don't you think?

391
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,415
Ha! You may be good
with a tablet,

392
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,134
but I'll bet I can
outride you any day.

393
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,530
You're on! I'll bring the bananas.

394
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,209
Right now, I have some work
to do on your portrait.

395
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:16,409
See ya!

396
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,569
Is he looking?

397
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:21,489
Don't look!

398
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,291
Dinner in a second!

399
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,615
Oh. Chelsea!

400
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:37,895
Shh. I'm hiding from Dash.

401
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:39,286
Oh.

402
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:43,969
Why are we
hiding from Dash?

403
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,052
'Cause she keeps
eating my hair!

404
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,486
It looks fine to me.

405
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:51,609
Yeah, but she follows
me around everywhere

406
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:57,406
and nibbles on my pigtails and gets
horse slobber all over my head.

407
00:28:58,563 --> 00:28:59,688
I see.

408
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:05,170
Oh, does your hair
smell like candy?

409
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:07,922
Marshmallow Tresses Shampoo.

410
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,490
My favorite.

411
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:12,885
It's made with real
live marshmallows!

412
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,001
Ah. Well,
that explains it.

413
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:17,529
Dash loves marshmallows, too.

414
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,560
She does?

415
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,289
Oh my, yes.

416
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,840
In fact,

417
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:24,401
you two have lots
of things in common.

418
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,608
She loves pretty ribbons,
and things that glitter,

419
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,128
and anything pink.

420
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,482
Perhaps you should give
her another chance.

421
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,366
I don't know.

422
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,567
She really, really
likes you, Chelsea.

423
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:42,009
And you know, I'll bet she'd
look wonderful in sparkly bows.

424
00:29:43,318 --> 00:29:44,278
You think?

425
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:45,838
Hmm,

426
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:47,878
maybe I could pretty her up.

427
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:52,322
We could start with a manicure
and then braid her hair.

428
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:53,437
Oh...

429
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:56,044
And then I could use
the sparkles and then...

430
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,683
Hmm?

431
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:17,354
Hmm.

432
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,197
Yeah! Way to go!

433
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:48,269
I got this.

434
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:55,910
Excellent form,
Marie, as always!

435
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:58,436
Pity you are too
young to compete, hmm?

436
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:01,355
Mamselle Stacie, you are next.
Remember,

437
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:03,597
you and your mount are as one.

438
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:05,672
You must be the horse!

439
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:06,828
Ah!

440
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,748
Now, allez-vous!

441
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:21,347
All right!
Now we're talking!

442
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,549
Oh man, lam so good at this!

443
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:37,671
Whoa!

444
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:40,783
Ugh, yuck!

445
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:43,905
<i>Mamselle Stacie.</i>

446
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:49,227
Perhaps I did not explain.

447
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:53,505
You are supposed to jump through
the hedge with the horse.

448
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:02,461
And that's for this year's 
holiday card.

449
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:14,979
Hiya!

450
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:23,658
Bonjour, mamselle. Now,
show me what you've found!

451
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:33,977
It's classical.
So boring!

452
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:36,305
You see in races they put
roses on the horses...

453
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:37,697
I don't care what they're for.

454
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,215
Since Mother left it
to us to decide,

455
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:46,584
I think the theme for the dance should
be "Alpine Primroses in Summertime."

456
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,139
I was thinking
"Robot Samurai."

457
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:55,261
What does that have to
do with a horse show?

458
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:58,215
What do you think robot
Samurai ride around on,

459
00:32:58,334 --> 00:32:59,414
skateboards?

460
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:01,021
Really?

461
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:03,094
You can't put a robot on a
horse it would fall off!

462
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:06,013
Mmm.

463
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:11,056
Horse!

464
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,299
Ahh!

465
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:29,321
Whoa!

466
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:38,601
All right!

467
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,609
Woo-hoo!

468
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:33,077
Where are you taking me?

469
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:55,952
Majestiques!
A whole herd of them!

470
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:39,472
Something wrong, Aunt Marlene?

471
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:40,953
It's nothing, dear.

472
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:43,265
Have you had your lunch yet?

473
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:44,389
Something is wrong.

474
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,473
Please tell me. I'm a teenager,
so I'll never let this drop.

475
00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:54,224
I'm afraid it's nothing
you can help with.

476
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:57,944
The fact is I may have
to sell the academy.

477
00:36:58,104 --> 00:36:59,871
Sell it? But why?

478
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:03,143
Too many bills,
too few students.

479
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:06,544
I have tried to hold on,
but two weeks ago,

480
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:10,670
<i>I got an offer for the place from
Madame Cheynet, of Ecole Montagne.</i>

481
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,825
No doubt Philippe's idea.

482
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:16,022
He has never forgiven
Etienne for coming here.

483
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:20,862
And if we don't win the tournament
prize money, I'll have to accept.

484
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:25,703
You're not going to do it,
are you?

485
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:30,740
Alpine has been in our family for generations.
I was born here.

486
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:33,627
I'd be crushed to lose it.

487
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,348
But I may have no choice.

488
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,739
They are giving me until
Tuesday to accept their offer.

489
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:42,580
But won't winning the race
bring in new students?

490
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:45,306
Of course, that would be wonderful!

491
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:48,986
But truthfully, we haven't
won a tournament in 11 years.

492
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:51,225
This year you've got a secret weapon,

493
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:53,140
the Roberts sisters!

494
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:56,499
Can you hold off the sale, just
until after the tournament?

495
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,977
I can try.
But, Skipper, really.

496
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:02,461
No time to talk! I've got
to see a girl about a race!

497
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,578
Way to go, Barbie!
Skipper!

498
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,294
That is one awesome horse!

499
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:33,061
Oh, Skipper, it was amazing!
We were flying!

500
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:36,700
Soaring! This is the horse I've
been looking for all my life!

501
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:41,536
But you can't say a word about her.
Not until I say so.

502
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,018
Barbie, something's happened.

503
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,453
Promise you won't!

504
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:48,016
Pinky pledge!

505
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:51,530
When exactly are we
too old for that?

506
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:53,689
Never!

507
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:58,090
Okay, my beautiful Majesty.
See you tomorrow. Go on now.

508
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,691
Majesty, I like that.

509
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:07,851
But look, there's something
I really need to tell you.

510
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:12,492
Lose the academy?
That's terrible!

511
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,248
Poor Aunt Marlene.

512
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:17,851
Exactly. Which is why Alpine
has to win this tournament.

513
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:21,974
I'm even violating my strict anti-involvement
policy by entering dressage.

514
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:24,326
Well that's perfect, you're
fantastic at dressage!

515
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,929
And that's why you have to
run in the steeplechase.

516
00:39:27,004 --> 00:39:30,126
You riding Majesty would totally
demolish the competition!

517
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:34,733
Skipper, I can't. Etienne is
riding for Alpine. It's tradition.

518
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,649
And besides, Majesty
needs to stay a secret,

519
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:40,688
at least till I get her
back to Malibu.

520
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:42,172
A secret? Why?

521
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:46,243
Because Philippe will recognize what she
is and know there must be more like her.

522
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:51,007
After we leave, I don't want her
herd hunted down and broken.

523
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:54,169
So Majestiques need
to stay a fairy tale.

524
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,242
But what about the steeplechase?

525
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:59,048
What about us winning the
tournament for Aunt Marlene?

526
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:01,208
Look, Etienne is a champion rider.

527
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,081
And remember, there's more
than one event.

528
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:07,286
With you doing dressage, I'm sure
Alpine's got everything they need.

529
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:33,678
Stacie?

530
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:35,764
You're not practicing
for Saturday?

531
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:39,676
Yeah, I dunno, I'm kinda off
horseback riding for now.

532
00:40:39,795 --> 00:40:43,364
Really? But aren't you signed
up for the cross-country trial?

533
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:45,799
Actually,

534
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,044
I was thinking about dropping out of that.
It's not really my thing.

535
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:55,639
Okay, Stacie, what's wrong? Since
when don't you like to compete?

536
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:58,995
Oh, face it, Barbie,
I stink at riding.

537
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,953
I just don't get it. I've always
aced everything I've tried!

538
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:11,280
Skateboards, mountain bikes,
wakeboarding, skysurfing, motorcross.

539
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:13,435
So why can't I control a horse?

540
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:16,353
Stacie, your horse
isn't a skateboard.

541
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:20,355
She's a living, breathing
being, with her own feelings.

542
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,398
Yeah. She's made her feelings
very clear to me.

543
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:28,879
Well, maybe you should try to work with her
instead of just trying to control her.

544
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,470
Make friends, find out 
what she wants.

545
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,194
Make friends with a horse? Like
what, take her to a movie?

546
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,514
You know what I mean.
Just try it.

547
00:41:39,828 --> 00:41:43,276
Oh, and, these sugar cubes 
won't hurt.

548
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:52,071
Hi, I'm Stacie! You know, the
girl you've been trying to maim?

549
00:41:55,187 --> 00:41:57,555
Here, have some cavities.

550
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:11,593
Hey!

551
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:13,629
She likes them!
Got any more?

552
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:26,863
<i>Welcome to the 108th Annual
Inter-Academy Equestrian Tournament!</i>

553
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:31,592
<i>And, as always, we start things
off with the perennially popular</i>

554
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,703
<i>pretty pony parade!</i>

555
00:42:37,381 --> 00:42:41,626
Isn't Dash pretty? And we
both smell like marshmallows!

556
00:42:59,899 --> 00:43:02,462
You're up next, Skipper.
We're all behind you!

557
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:06,063
Hey, tech girl. Don't tell me you
found an app for riding that thing.

558
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:09,858
No app needed. We're doing
this strictly old school.

559
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:15,460
<i>Next up in the
dressage competition,</i>

560
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:18,384
<i>riding for Alpine, Skipper
Roberts on Juniper.</i>

561
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,054
<i>And first place goes to
Miss Skipper Roberts of Alpine!</i>

562
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:20,368
Boo!

563
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:24,572
Perhaps I should acquire
one of those tablets.

564
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:34,448
<i>Our next event will
be the cross-country competition.</i>

565
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:37,888
<i>Stacie Roberts on Pepper, now heading
for the double rails of number seven.</i>

566
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:41,175
<i>And the jump is good!</i>

567
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:44,886
<i>Now approaching jump eight,
the lighthouse.</i>

568
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:48,130
<i>Immediately followed by the
fickle frank at number nine.</i>

569
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,413
<i>A smooth landing for
Miss Roberts and Pepper.</i>

570
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,528
<i>Moving strongly now, and they
beautifully adapt to the corners.</i>

571
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:56,884
<i>Now, jumping over
the brush fence at 10!</i>

572
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:01,724
<i>Uh-oh, a run-out,
that'll cost them points.</i>

573
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:10,202
<i>But they recover nicely
and go for the triple bar!</i>

574
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:16,486
<i>A clean jump. Heading now for the final
and most challenging jump, the keyhole!</i>

575
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:21,486
Okay, we're friends now right? We go
through this jump together this time,

576
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:23,209
not just me.

577
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,841
Pretty please?

578
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,643
<i>A Perfect jump!</i>

579
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:43,927
<i>And here comes
the judges' decision.</i>

580
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:48,319
<i>First place, Stephanie Coda and
King's Cross of Ecole Montagne!</i>

581
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:57,082
<i>In second place, Stacie
Roberts and Pepper of Alpine!</i>

582
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:06,280
Second place? Not bad.
But next year, we hammer them.

583
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:15,359
<i>And that concludes
the opening day competitions,</i>

584
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:20,077
<i>with Ecole Montagne and Alpine
Academy tied for first place.</i>

585
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:25,641
<i>Tomorrow, the final event, the spectacular
steeplechase at Bernwald Racetrack.</i>

586
00:46:25,713 --> 00:46:30,242
<i>And don't forget the inter-academy formal
dance tonight, right here at Alpine!</i>

587
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:32,675
That's the best we've done in years.

588
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,597
What a great day for Alpine!

589
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:36,800
And a long one at that.

590
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:39,911
I suggest we all have a little
rest before the dance.

591
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:44,352
Where's my blue pantyhose?
My shoes shrunk!

592
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,874
Nobody move.
How does my hair look?

593
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,477
You're too little for lipstick!
No fair!

594
00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:00,997
Barnaby!
My shoe!

595
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:06,473
You might as well throw him the other
one, maybe he can chew it to match.

596
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:08,675
Um, does this look funny?

597
00:47:22,346 --> 00:47:23,306
Tuck it in!

598
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:24,585
Turn around!

599
00:47:26,984 --> 00:47:28,427
Much better.

600
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:32,185
Is that, is that me?

601
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:37,071
I love it!

602
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:46,988
Would you like a glass of
punch? It's very tasty.

603
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:50,751
There you go, and one for you. There you go.
Would you like some?

604
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:51,782
Yes? All right.

605
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:54,222
Oh, how are you?

606
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:56,070
I know, isn't it beautiful?

607
00:47:56,142 --> 00:47:57,102
Good to see you again.

608
00:47:57,262 --> 00:47:58,745
Good evening, Etienne.

609
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:01,549
Konnichiwa. That's "hello"
in Samurai!

610
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,787
Oh my.

611
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,661
What interesting decor.

612
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,829
I knew you'd love it.

613
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:13,265
Don't ask.

614
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,140
There we go.

615
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,743
Yes, I was out riding today.

616
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:18,980
Well, I think that it's going to be
quite a bit easier now...

617
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:20,225
Whoa.

618
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,501
Look, the Odd Squad is staring.

619
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,785
Pretend they're not there.

620
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,824
I love this song!
Marie, come dance with me!

621
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:10,860
Hey, nerd girl. You weren't too
bad at the dressage trials today.

622
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:14,052
Thanks. Boy, that
first prize is heavy.

623
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:16,217
Yeah, yeah.
You got lucky.

624
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:22,171
You, uh, want to dance?

625
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,977
I wouldn't want to step on
your little second-place feet.

626
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:26,930
I'll take a chance.

627
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,010
Whoa. What were the odds of that?

628
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:41,048
You didn't see that coming?

629
00:49:57,847 --> 00:50:02,211
That is my punch you are drinking,
you stuffed sauerkraut sausage!

630
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:06,245
It's mine, you pompous
pickled pudding!

631
00:50:06,325 --> 00:50:07,285
Creampuff!

632
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:08,444
Bon bon for brains!

633
00:50:08,524 --> 00:50:09,452
Chocolate mousse!

634
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:12,166
I think I'm losing my appetite.

635
00:50:22,924 --> 00:50:25,924
Oh, Stacie, I'm going out 
to the corral.

636
00:50:26,003 --> 00:50:28,567
Yeah, yeah, that's nice.
Have fun.

637
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:35,242
I'll be right back.

638
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:17,278
Chelsea!

639
00:51:17,357 --> 00:51:18,481
Chelsea?
Chelsea!

640
00:51:22,836 --> 00:51:23,797
Chelsea!

641
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:26,524
Hang on, Chelsea!

642
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:29,522
Etienne!

643
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,274
Chelsea!

644
00:51:37,634 --> 00:51:38,834
Chelsea?
Chelsea?

645
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:42,082
Chelsea, can you hear me?

646
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:47,113
Chels...

647
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:49,482
Dash! Stop!

648
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:51,320
I'm okay.

649
00:51:53,712 --> 00:51:57,476
She's okay, just a little
shaken. She'll be fine.

650
00:51:58,392 --> 00:52:00,192
Chelsea, why on Earth?

651
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:05,039
I just wanted to ride a big horse,
like you and Barbie and Stacie do.

652
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,358
Oh, Chelsea.

653
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:11,152
I think you've done quite
enough riding for one day.

654
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,877
Let's get you inside.

655
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:16,189
And Etienne, we'll need to get
a doctor to look at your arm.

656
00:52:18,748 --> 00:52:20,397
Thank goodness she's okay.

657
00:52:21,108 --> 00:52:23,990
But what about our horses?
They're all gone.

658
00:52:24,548 --> 00:52:26,993
The race!
We must go after them!

659
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:30,152
How? It's dark, and we don't
know which way they went.

660
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:31,308
I can track them.

661
00:52:32,786 --> 00:52:34,947
Jonas, you know how to do that?

662
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:36,348
I know these hills like
Skipper knows her tablet.

663
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:38,434
My friends said we could
use their horses.

664
00:52:38,746 --> 00:52:39,913
Let's go!

665
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:42,954
We'll call the neighboring farms and ask
them to keep a lookout for the runaways.

666
00:52:43,265 --> 00:52:44,554
I'll help!

667
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:02,945
Come on, this way!

668
00:53:07,263 --> 00:53:09,629
Hmm.
What is it?

669
00:53:09,703 --> 00:53:11,428
These tracks...

670
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:14,791
You see that set of prints?

671
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:17,469
That horse is coming from a different
direction than the others.

672
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,427
Then it joins the rest here.

673
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,825
Huh, it's not wearing horseshoes.

674
00:53:21,901 --> 00:53:25,544
Exactly. Then it appears to lead
the herd away, in that direction.

675
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:51,381
I'm afraid that's it.

676
00:53:51,457 --> 00:53:54,218
The prints lead onto
these rocks, and then vanish.

677
00:53:54,296 --> 00:53:55,256
Sorry.

678
00:53:55,337 --> 00:53:59,582
Now what? The race is in a few
hours, and Alpine's got no horses.

679
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:02,461
Aunt Marlene might as well
kiss the school goodbye.

680
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:06,337
Wait! I know where they might be!

681
00:54:16,216 --> 00:54:17,894
Good job, Majesty!

682
00:54:19,253 --> 00:54:23,378
I wonder if she babysits. Four sugar cubes
an hour and all the hay she can eat.

683
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:25,178
That horse...

684
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:27,337
The one with the pink mane.

685
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:30,820
What breed is it?

686
00:54:31,293 --> 00:54:32,940
A very special one.

687
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:35,256
And they're our secret. 
Okay?

688
00:54:36,092 --> 00:54:38,176
Looks like the steeplechase 
is still on!

689
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,891
Monsieur Philippe.
What a pleasant surprise.

690
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:56,291
You think you're very clever, don't you?
And you! Traitor! Turncoat!

691
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,573
Do not bother returning to L'Ecole!

692
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:01,416
Mamselle Barbie, I owe you
a debt of gratitude.

693
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:04,975
I believe you have found a place I have
searched for since I was a child...

694
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,411
The Valley Of The Majestiques.

695
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:11,976
Majestiques? But Monsieur, you
said they were fairy tales!

696
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,890
That was for my brother's benefit.

697
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:19,928
I have always known they were real.
And worth a king's ransom.

698
00:55:20,206 --> 00:55:23,326
And now, I know they
are somewhere on Alpine land.

699
00:55:23,605 --> 00:55:25,973
As you've said,
this is Alpine land.

700
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:29,853
Well, after today's race, this land
will belong to Ecole Montagne,

701
00:55:29,965 --> 00:55:33,085
and soon I will have all the
time in the world to find them.

702
00:55:33,484 --> 00:55:36,452
Unless, of course, Monsieur
Etienne leaves you in the dust.

703
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:41,649
Oh, didn't you hear? My brother's
broken arm will keep him from riding.

704
00:55:42,762 --> 00:55:44,684
But do not worry.
Once this land is mine,

705
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:48,048
I may let you look 
at the Majestiques...

706
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:50,447
For a price.

707
00:55:54,282 --> 00:55:56,201
We have to win that race.

708
00:55:58,042 --> 00:55:59,928
<i>Day two of the tournament,</i>

709
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:04,090
<i>and we're here at Bernwald Racetrack
for the concluding event,</i>

710
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:07,521
<i>the annual 3.2 kilometer
steeplechase.</i>

711
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,204
<i>Alpine Academy and Ecole Montagne
are tied going into this race.</i>

712
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,879
Aren't Barbie and Skipper coming?

713
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,083
They'll make it here
in time! I just know it!

714
00:56:19,038 --> 00:56:22,487
<i>Riding for Centre
Equestre, Jason Randall.</i>

715
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:28,606
<i>Riding for Ecole Montagne, Monsieur
Philippe Cheynet, on Hurricane!</i>

716
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,558
You lose again, Etienne!

717
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:36,840
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, an announcement.</i>

718
00:56:36,996 --> 00:56:39,997
<i>Alpine Academy will
not be racing this year.</i>

719
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:41,720
lam sorry, Marlene.

720
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:43,796
We tried our best.

721
00:56:43,876 --> 00:56:46,036
<i>As we approach the top
of the hour, registration is now...</i>

722
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,441
<i>Wait a moment!
There's a late entry!</i>

723
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:50,957
<i>Riding for Alpine is</i>

724
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:53,316
<i>Barbie Roberts,
on Majesty!</i>

725
00:56:57,634 --> 00:56:59,915
Etienne! Is that...

726
00:56:59,994 --> 00:57:00,998
Yes.

727
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,953
A Majestique.

728
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:07,202
Easy, now. Easy.

729
00:57:07,273 --> 00:57:10,000
The saddle's not so bad.
You'll get used to it.

730
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:15,513
Whoa, it's okay Majesty.

731
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:30,475
That's a beautiful horse, Ms. Roberts.
It will not be yours much longer.

732
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:33,590
We will see, Monsieur.

733
00:57:35,029 --> 00:57:37,310
Wow! It's like they're real!

734
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:49,588
<i>Rider's ready!</i>

735
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:54,832
<i>The wire is up,
and they're off!</i>

736
00:58:01,107 --> 00:58:03,594
Easy,easy.
It's all right.

737
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:09,715
<i>Teacher's Pet takes the lead, Prima
Donna in second, Way to Go in third!</i>

738
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,106
<i>Majesty is rearing
at the gate.</i>

739
00:58:19,744 --> 00:58:22,111
That's it. Settle.
It's okay.

740
00:58:23,424 --> 00:58:24,592
Hiya!

741
00:58:30,263 --> 00:58:32,150
Come on, Majesty.
You can do it!

742

<i>Way To Go moving
into the number two spot</i>

743

<i>as riders head for
the first water ditch!</i>

744
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,902
<i>Raclette is down!</i>

745
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,906
You can do this, girl! It's
just like the glacier streams!

746
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:06,907
We love you, Barbie!

747
00:59:08,857 --> 00:59:10,985
<i>Rounding the turn to
jump four, it's Creme Brulee and</i>

<i>Way to Go leading the pack,
with Prima Donna dropping back,</i>

749
00:59:13,937 --> 00:59:16,020
<i>followed by Teacher's Pet
with Hurricane gaining.</i>

750
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,298
<i>Oh, dear. Teacher's Pet
has spilled its rider!</i>

751
00:59:24,976 --> 00:59:26,656
Go, you mangy beast!

752
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:40,816
<i>Hurricane passes Prima Donna
and challenges Creme Brulee for second</i>

<i>as they come
to the hedge jump.</i>

754
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,978
<i>Majesty still trailing
in last place.</i>

755
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:52,173
<i>What's this? Creme Brulee
is out of the race!</i>

756
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:56,336
That is just plain wrong. Come
on, Majesty, let's show him!

757
01:00:00,611 --> 01:00:04,332
<i>Making a late charge, Majesty
rockets to overtake Prima Donna!</i>

<i>Barbie Roberts is down! The
saddle has come off her horse!</i>

762
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,971
<i>It looks like Miss Roberts and
Majesty are out of the race!</i>

763
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:42,888
He can't stop us.
Come on, Majesty.

764
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:45,289
Born free, ride free!

765
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,132
<i>Hurricane now
closing in on Way To Go.</i>

766

<i>Hurricane and Way To Go

01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:11,403
<i>Oh, Way To Go stumbles!</i>

<i>Just one more jump before another
victory for Ecole Montagne.</i>

771
01:01:21,921 --> 01:01:24,409
Alpine and the
Majestiques are mine!

772
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:29,207
<i>Wait a moment. Barbie Roberts is
back in the race and gaining fast!</i>

773
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,322
<i>Philippe Cheynet
takes the jump!</i>

774
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,362
<i>What's this? Unbelievable!</i>

775
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:07,004
<i>Barbie Roberts and Majesty
down the stretch!</i>

<i>Philippe Cheynet furiously
trying to take back the lead.</i>

777
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:12,079
<i>It's Majesty and
Hurricane down the stretch!</i>

778
01:02:18,394 --> 01:02:23,794
<i>And the winner for Alpine Academy
is Barbie Roberts on Majesty!</i>

779
01:02:34,472 --> 01:02:36,839
You did it, Majesty,
you did it!

780
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:45,512
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!
The overall Tournament Cup goes to</i>

781
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,599
<i>Alpine Equestrian Academy!</i>

782
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:55,990
It is an outrage! I should
have won that race!

783
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,390
I was unfairly distracted!

784
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,790
By what?
Your own cheating?

785
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:03,750
We saw what you did,
you penguin's patoot!

786
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:06,797
And you are the lint in a
baboon's belly button!

787
01:03:08,108 --> 01:03:09,189
Here we go again.

788
01:03:09,268 --> 01:03:12,192
Taisez-vous!
Ow!

789
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:15,509
Now go to your room!
You are on Ie time out!

790
01:03:15,627 --> 01:03:18,868
But Maman!
He started it!

791
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:28,146
<i>You were magnifique!</i>

792
01:03:30,105 --> 01:03:31,829
Uh, thank you, uh...

793
01:03:31,904 --> 01:03:35,865
<i>Madame Cheynet,
the owner of Ecole Montagne.</i>

794
01:03:36,306 --> 01:03:39,348
Bridgette, I won't be
needing to sell Alpine.

795
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:41,387
<i>Felicitations, Marlene.</i>

796
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:45,268
lam most happy for you.

797
01:03:45,385 --> 01:03:46,627
Maman...

798
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:50,426
This horse...
Thelegendu.

799
01:03:50,862 --> 01:03:54,432
I know.
Isn't she beautiful?

800
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:57,950
<i>Come, mon chouchou.
I made soup.</i>

801
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,106
Do I get a baguette this time?

802
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,468
Thank you.
I love it.

803
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,865
Here's Stacie's last bag. Popcorn
and I packed the rest of her stuff.

804
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:20,503
Hey, where is Popcorn?

805
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:24,024
on.

806
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:27,898
Well, I think
that's everything.

807
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,383
I just want to thank you
again, Aunt Marlene.

808
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:32,258
This has been the
best summer ever.

809
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:35,021
No, I thank all of you.

810
01:04:35,177 --> 01:04:37,905
Once Skipper posted her
video of the race online,

811
01:04:38,218 --> 01:04:39,778
our enrollment tripled!

812
01:04:39,858 --> 01:04:43,665
I think we'll be teaching
riders for many years to come.

813
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:46,856
At school, I signed up a
whole bunch of students

814
01:04:46,936 --> 01:04:49,020
for riding and dressage lessons,

815
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:53,219
and one wants to learn to play the
banjo, but I signed him up anyway.

816
01:04:56,774 --> 01:04:58,258
Well, that's the last of it.

817
01:04:58,334 --> 01:05:01,858
Thanks for helping. You're not a bad guy!
Sometimes.

818
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:04,614
Careful, you almost
said something nice to me.

819
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:08,374
And since you like
marshmallow shampoo so much,

820
01:05:08,453 --> 01:05:11,977
I'm gonna send you my next
favorite, Scent O' S'mores.

821
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:16,372
Yeah, me too. And I'm sorry
about all those things I said.

822
01:05:16,652 --> 01:05:19,139
You really are a great pony.
And just my size.

823
01:05:20,052 --> 01:05:22,616
Okay, I admit it.
I'm gonna miss you.

824
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:27,012
Even though you gave my sister years'
worth of embarrassing pictures of me,

825
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:29,179
you're still a very cool horse.

826
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:37,969
See you in Malibu, Majesty. I think
you're gonna like California.

827
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:40,174
You have chosen an
amazing horse, Barbie.

828
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:44,489
I am certain you and she will
win many, many races together.

829
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:05,610
Barbie?
Aren't you excited?

830
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,774
No. No, I won't do it.

831
01:06:09,405 --> 01:06:11,927
Barbie, what are you doing?

832
01:06:12,086 --> 01:06:15,892
Letting her go. I can't, Aunt Marlene.
I just can't.

833
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,767
She belongs here with her family.

834
01:06:18,884 --> 01:06:20,608
I could never take
that away from her.

835
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:25,446
That decision comes from your heart.
I think it's the right one.

836
01:06:34,682 --> 01:06:38,250
I'll never forget you.
Never. Now go.

837
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,887
If you come back,
I know she will come back.

838
01:07:09,718 --> 01:07:10,678
Come on, Barbie!

839
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,006
This thing won't drive itself!

840
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,042
Okay, now, who's got 
the boarding passes?
