1
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,130
Ah! We made it.

2
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,431
I gotta go, I gotta go! I gotta go!

3
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,515
Last one out's a rotten cheese!

4
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,735
Just breathe that air! Very Alpsy.

5
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,284
Look! Look! Horses!

6
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,744
Let's go riding! Can we please?

7
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,071
Can we?

8
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,286
Chelsea, chill. We've got all month to ride the horses.

9
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,454
Whoa!

10
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,621
I know! It's the Matterhorn! Isn't it amazing?

11
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,082
No, I mean this LCD screen!

12
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,420
Thirty-three megapixel resolution with 24.7 million colors!

13
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,092
It's like we're there!

14
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,298
Skipper, we are there.

15
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,351
Oh, yeah. Nice mountains.

16
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,895
But on this baby I can zoom in!

17
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,514
Barbie!

18
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,644
Aunt Marlene!

19
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,724
Skipper!

20
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,773
Stacie!

21
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,943
Chelsea!

22
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,777
Welcome to the Alpine Riding Academy!

23
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,201
Hello, Barbie.

24
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,121
- Hello, Max. - Barbie!

25
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,288
Whoa!

26
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,411
Oh, Marie!

27
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,160
Hi, Marie! You're really here!

28
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,627
Please excuse my sister. She was raised by squirrels.

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,461
lam so glad you're all here!

30
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,460
Please, come inside.

31
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:35,015
Barbie, I love the hand-tooled detail on your luggage. It's awfully smart.

32
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,057
Thanks.

33
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,885
I got a suitcase just like it!

34
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,970
Except mine is covered with scorpions.

35
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,987
Get out of the way!

36
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,697
Ooh!

37
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,362
This is it.

38
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,745
The flowers were my little touch.

39
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,164
And I picked off most of the bugs.

40
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,450
Most of the bugs?

41
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,754
Oh, and I put sweets on all of your pillows, just like in a hotel!

42
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,416
Oh, 'course, that was three days ago

43
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,093
and some of them melted, and Popcorn ate the rest,

44
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,842
but you can still smell them when you sleep.

45
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,676
Thank you, children. Popcorn!

46
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,056
Now back to your chores.

47
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,600
I got dibs on the top bunk!

48
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,847
No, me!

49
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,683
One, two, three, shoot.

50
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,985
Yes! No!

51
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,659
The room's perfect, Aunt Marlene. And I can't wait to find my horse!

52
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,695
Your champion horse! Barbie's gonna win

53
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,497
the Pacific Steeplechase with it!

54
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,033
Well, I don't know about that.

55
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,580
Of course you'll win.

56
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,996
You're only the best rider on the West Coast.

57
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,959
Thanks, but that depends a lot on finding just the right horse.

58
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,881
The horse of your dreams, hmm?

59
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,421
Every rider has one.

60
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,013
Something like that.

61
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,848
Well, I believe we raise the finest jumping horses in all of Switzerland.

62
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,722
I'm certain you'll find one here that is to your liking.

63
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,148
Have you got one that looks like this?

64
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,396
My, that's quite a horse.

65
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,604
Isn't it?

66
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,731
I hope I brought enough glitter.

67
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,484
When can we get started?

68
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,692
How about now?

69
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,823
Yay! Woo-hoo!

70
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,119
Let's go!

71
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,536
Skipper? Don't you want to see the horses, too?

72
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,001
You guys go ahead. I need to update my blog.

73
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,169
You used to love horses. When you were younger we couldn't get you off them.

74
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,291
Well, I guess people change.

75
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,762
And right now, all my peeps are at Tech-Con, trying out the latest gear,

76
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,720
while I'm stuck here listening to cows yodel.

77
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,602
So, first time on a horse, is it?

78
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,229
Yeah, it's my first,

79
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,565
but it won't take me long to ace it, like I do every sport.

80
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,777
Still, you might want to go slowly at first.

81
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,412
Thanks, but not too slow.

82
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,824
Did I mention I'm kind of a natural jock?

83
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,247
Yes. We caught it the first time.

84
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,455
We'll match Chelsea and Stacie with their horses first.

85
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,796
Girls, meet your teachers.

86
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:21,799
Ooh, I want that one! Or that one! Can I have two?

87
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,384
Can we pick whichever horse we want?

88
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,516
No, no, cherie. The beginning riders never pick their horses.

89
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,315
Huh? The horses pick you.

90
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,400
Excuse me?

91
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,476
You'll see.

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,733
Step into the corral and...

93
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,655
Then stand really still.

94
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,585
Aw.

95
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,965
It's okay, Chels.

96
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,641
Looks like you've got a new bestie, Stace.

97
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,017
What's her name?

98
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,937
Stacie, meet Pepper.

99
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,523
Nice to meet you, Pepper.

100
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
Aw.

101
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,181
It looks like you, too, have been chosen, Chelsea.

102
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,395
Meet Dash.

103
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,145
Where's the rest of her?

104
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,063
I'm afraid that's all there is.

105
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,570
But Dash is a very sweet pony.

106
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,322
And she seems to really like you.

107
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,903
But she's so little.

108
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,911
Why can't I have a big horse like Stacie's?

109
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,833
Chelsea, give Dash a chance.

110
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,377
There'll be plenty of time for big horses

111
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,829
when you're a little bigger.

112
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,209
Hmm.

113
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,584
Catastrophe! Disaster! Calamity!

114
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,840
C'est choquant, quelle horreur!

115
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,595
Madame Marlene,

116
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,094
we are ruined!

117
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,134
What is it this time, Etienne?

118
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,224
Look at these fly bonnets!

119
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,847
Just look at them!

120
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,189
So? "So?" I ordered them in aubergine

121
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,862
to match the halters! But look! Look!

122
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,946
Would you call that aubergine? Hmm?

123
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,069
Um, no?

124
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,406
He has a point. That is so not aubergine.

125
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,867
You see? The child is clearly offended!

126
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,671
How are we supposed to win a tournament with clashing fly bonnets?

127
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,466
Even the flies will be laughing at us!

128
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,552
Tournament? I like the sound of that.

129
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,507
The annual tournament between our academy and all the other local riding schools.

130
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,893
And the prize money is substantial. This year we're hosting.

131
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:16,565
But not if our horses are too embarrassed to take the field!

132
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,232
I'd better take care of this.

133
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,945
Max, Marie, you get Stacie and Chelsea started.

134
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,566
Barbie, you of course may choose your own horse.

135
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,572
Look over the thoroughbreds in the stable.

136
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,070
Every one's a prize jumper.

137
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,625
Did you see the stitching? I specifically asked for a cross-hatch stitch.

138
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,378
This is not a cross or even a hatch...

139
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,748
Who was that?

140
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,419
That was Monsieur Etienne, our riding master.

141
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,638
Is he always like that? Like he just bit into a lemon.

142
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,178
Pretty much. He's a good teacher, though.

143
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,727
Go!

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,348
Come on, girl! Good girl.

145
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,392
She's all yours.

146
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,019
Hmph.

147
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,483
Okay! So how do I get on this thing?

148
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,943
Ah, yes! Well, before we begin, I thought it might be instructive to review

149
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,529
the history of the English, or eventing, saddle.

150
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,660
Is that necessar...

151
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,334
Here you'll see the gullet, the cantle, the girth buckle, the...

152
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,207
What my brother's trying to say is,

153
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,123
stick your foot in here and throw your leg over the horse.

154
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,291
That's the big thing right there.

155
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,926
Got it. Thanks.

156
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,505
Right. Of course. Who needs four hundred years of tradition?

157
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,349
Fine. Just jump on and kick her into drive.

158
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,054
Wait!

159
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,316
First time on a horse? Definitely video-worthy.

160
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,612
Look at that style, that confident approach!

161
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:51,785
"As the future champion approaches, the animal humbly yields to its new master."

162
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,411
Whoa!

163
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,994
Look! Alpine has a new trick rider!

164
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,712
What do you call that move?

165
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,331
"The mud dive?"

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,001
Whoa!

167
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,553
Hey, Marie, if that's your best rider,

168
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,847
our winning streak seems pretty safe!

169
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,946
Hey, if you're looking up "world's greatest rider," I'm right here.

170
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:33,031
Actually, I was just looking up "doofus." See, right here.

171
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,535
She got you good, Jonas!

172
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656
How droll.

173
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,875
Don't mind them.

174
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,962
They're from Ecole Montagne, the riding school just down the road.

175
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,424
They're just trying to get under our skin, with the tournament coming up.

176
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,048
'Course, it doesn't really matter. We always lose anyway.

177
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,845
Usually to them.

178
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,269
You never know. This year could be different.

179
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,768
Statistically speaking, we're bound to win within... Hmm...

180
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,774
Sixty-three years.

181
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,063
Now that I'm on the team, we'll cream those creeps!

182
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,821
Whoa! Ugh!

183
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,779
Yep.

184
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,155
Classic.

185
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,543
Why, hello, Sebastian.

186
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,088
Hello, Popcorn.

187
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,761
Now, run along.

188
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,222
Sorry that took so long, Barbie dear.

189
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,383
Monsieur Etienne can be a bit...

190
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,057
Temperamental at times.

191
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,725
I noticed.

192
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,274
He's worth it. We're hoping he can lead us to our first tournament win

193
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,601
in 11 years.

194
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,065
I'm sure you've got lots of good riders.

195
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,189
We did once,

196
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:38,410
but frankly, enrollment has been incredibly low these last few years.

197
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,121
So have you found your horse yet?

198
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,083
Every one in this group is from champion stock.

199
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,253
I'm just not sure.

200
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,546
This one seems nice.

201
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,920
Ah, Finian. Excellent choice!

202
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,597
His sire was winner of the Virginia Gold Cup,

203
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,595
so he'll be right at home in America.

204
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,093
You two would make an excellent team.

205
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,480
Hmmm... Maybe.

206
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,540
Ugh.

207
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,872
Ugh.

208
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,551
Ahh!

209
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,721
Huh? Oh, a goat. What's that?

210
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,971
Oh, no, you don't, you grabby goat!

211
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,978
Wakey wakey!

212
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,483
Oh, hi, Barnaby.

213
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,775
You know him? He's eating my blanket!

214
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,358
Yes, he likes wool. Last week he ate all my socks.

215
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,658
It's a miracle he's still alive.

216
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,119
Breakfast in twenty minutes! Hope you like Kartoffelkuchen.

217
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, mamselle.

218
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:30,021
We swoop with the curry comb, not attack. Hmm?

219
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,516
Long curving motions...

220
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,520
Comme ca... And swoop, oui?

221
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,401
And swoop, yes?

222
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,156
Bend the knees and swoop!

223
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,329
Got it. Swoop. Swoop. Bend...

224
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,613
Hey!

225
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,121
Gimme a break! I'm new at swooping!

226
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,584
Perfect! Dash, you're going to be so pretty!

227
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,669
Don't you think so, Chels?

228
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,678
Oh!

229
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,722
I can't wait to get out and feel the wind in my hair.

230
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,434
Ah...

231
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,311
Yipee-ka-yay.

232
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,989
Ow!

233
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,612
O-W.

234
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,236
Hyah!

235
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,829
Ah. Ah. Reign back, Mademoiselle Barbie!

236
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,332
No faster than a walk, please.

237
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:40,042
We must make certain everyone is riding at the same pace, n'est-ce pas?

238
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,299
Whoa!

239
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,359
Skipper, Stacie. Did you see that?

240
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,820
See what? That horse!

241
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,994
What are you talking about?

242
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,074
I guess... Nothing.

243
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,493
Nothing at all.

244
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,499
- Any dessert? Anything to eat? - No more for me!

245
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,296
Anybody like a cup of tea? Yes?

246
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,471
Now tell me the truth, Barnaby.

247
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,840
Doesn't clover taste better than wool?

248
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,806
I'm glad you agree.

249
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,814
That's the horse!

250
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,864
Elle fait des gateaux

251
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,583
Papa est en bas

252
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,828
Il fait du chocolat

253
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,756
Fais do do, Reynaud

254
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,255
Mon petit frere

255
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,211
Fais do do

256
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,181
T'auras du lolo

257
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,931
Oh. Mademoiselle Barbie, you startled me!

258
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,770
I'm sorry. I was enjoying your singing.

259
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,144
So was Reynaud.

260
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,194
Oh, ha, um, it is nothing. it calms him down.

261
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,365
Monsieur Etienne, may I ask you a question?

262
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,204
About the academy logo?

263
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,868
Logo?

264
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,958
You know, the sign in front? The horse.

265
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,661
Ah, that.

266
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,213
What can I say? It is a horse.

267
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,876
Well, yes, of course. But a very unusual horse, wouldn't you say?

268
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,631
I mean, those markings.

269
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,551
Why the interest?

270
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,844
It's just I don't know, I feel like I've seen that horse somewhere.

271
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,888
That is highly doubtful.

272
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,973
The horse you speak of does not exist.

273
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,360
It doesn't? But, the sign...

274
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:09,612
ls of a fable of an ancient herd called, "The Majestique."

275
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,948
They were said to roam wild somewhere in these mountains.

276
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,497
The story is that they are descended from a

277
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,327
breed created over a thousand years ago,

278
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,585
especially for the princesses of the Kieburg royalty

279
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,258
and fiercely loyal to them.

280
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,713
They protected them from harm, and the princesses were just

281
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,470
as devoted and protective of them.

282
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,601
A strong fearless breed.

283
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:42,224
They were said to have such superb jumping skill,

284
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,728
that they almost seemed to fly.

285
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,362
They are known by the strange pink streak in their manes.

286
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,790
The smartest, the fastest, the bravest horses ever known to man!

287
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,872
Many doubt that they were ever real,

288
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,843
since none has ever been caught, or even photographed.

289
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,924
But what about the painting?

290
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,304
Hmm. What of it?

291
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,601
There are also paintings of fairies and mermaids, non?

292
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,306
So, you don't think the Majestique horses are real?

293
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,806
Mmm...

294
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,976
Once, when I was a child,

295
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,316
I thought I saw...

296
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,904
Nonsense!

297
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,357
Foolish twaddle!

298
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,569
You have always believed in fairy tales, Etienne.

299
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,322
Philippe! How dare you defile my stable!

300
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,955
You, you festering boil on a baboon's backside!

301
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,910
And you are the hair of a pig's nostril!

302
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,247
I spit on the toe of your uncle!

303
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,919
I stuff your nose with cabbages!

304
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,965
Uh, hi, my name's Barbie.

305
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,429
I gather you two know each other.

306
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,846
Excusez-moi, mademoiselle.

307
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,685
I am Monsieur Philippe, riding master extraordinaire of L'Ecole Montagne.

308
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,482
Enchante.

309
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,231
I speak up, only because this pig of a dog of a mule,

310
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,480
fills your head with phooey-hooey.

311
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:18,452
There is no such breed as the Majestique and there never was.

312
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,577
No horse is that remarkable.

313
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,329
They are merely dumb beasts, meant to serve their masters.

314
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,377
And fear the riding crop!

315
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,675
But why do you ask about Majestiques?

316
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,959
Have you...

317
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,549
Seen something?

318
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,639
Me? Um. er...

319
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,434
How could I see something that doesn't exist?

320
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,938
Yes. Of course. Utter foolishness!

321
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,232
Etienne, it is chilly.

322
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,234
Maman says to wear your sweater.

323
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,903
Tell her the soup was yummy.

324
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,529
And how was the baguette?

325
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,327
I did not receive a baguette.

326
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,403
Exactly.

327
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,438
Hmm.

328
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,067
Come on, Finian. Let's go home.

329
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,962
What is it?

330
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,794
Whoa!

331
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,430
Finian, come back!

332
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,927
Oh, boy.

333
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,740
So you are real!

334
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,370
I knew it!

335
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,954
Thank you.

336
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,385
Hmm, my hero.

337
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,144
Again.

338
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,225
Straighten up, mamselle Stacie.

339
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,029
Legs pressed together, weight forward.

340
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,274
Ah, tres bien.

341
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,200
Now pull your horse back to a walk, then stop.

342
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,863
Whoa.

343
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,116
Whoa!

344
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,201
Whoa, whoa!

345
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,003
Don't you know how to whoa?

346
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,082
Non, non, non, mamselle. We do not yank the reins.

347
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,420
You will only make her...

348
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,048
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

349
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,058
Oh, les enfants.

350
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,514
Aunt Marlene,

351
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,357
I need a new horse.

352
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,192
Mine is busted.

353
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,029
No, Stacie, Pepper is your horse,

354
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,069
and she chose you for a reason.

355
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,072
Yeah, 'cause she craves my public humiliation.

356
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,453
She won't do anything I tell her to.

357
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,947
Of course she will...

358
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,123
When she wants to.

359
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,797
Hiya!

360
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,489
Hiya!

361
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,345
I know you're here somewhere...

362
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,752
It's all right.

363
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,676
Everything's going to be just fine.

364
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,130
Let me help you, okay?

365
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,933
Wow, you really did get stuck, didn't you?

366
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,598
That must hurt.

367
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,431
Easy girl, easy.

368
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,975
That's it.

369
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,569
Fais do do

370
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,908
T'auras du Iolo

371
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,748
Fais do do

372
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,662
Ma petite soeur

373
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,918
Fais do do

374
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,714
T'auras du lolo

375
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,313
Oh, you're bleeding.

376
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,781
I just want to help you.

377
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,445
It's okay.

378
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,878
I owe you this for the wolves.

379
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,009
You're so majestic.

380
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,138
I think I'll call you...

381
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,223
Majesty-

382
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,859
Okay, one more, Barnaby.

383
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,107
And this time a little more presidential.

384
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,199
Hey, tech girl!

385
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,825
Ever put that thing down?

386
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,787
Oh look, Barnaby, you have a visitor.

387
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,794
Did you come to have your official portrait taken,

388
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,004
monkey DOV?

389
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,301
Ohh! That one will look good on a baboon.

390
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,798
Don't you think?

391
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,260
Ha! You may be good with a tablet,

392
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,096
but I'll bet I can outride you any day.

393
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,595
You're on! I'll bring the bananas.

394
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,389
Right now, I have some work to do on your portrait.

395
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,683
See ya!

396
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:30,978
Is he looking?

397
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:32,980
Don't look!

398
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,160
Dinner in a second!

399
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,711
Oh. Chelsea!

400
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,088
Shh. I'm hiding from Dash.

401
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,540
Oh.

402
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,424
Why are we hiding from Dash?

403
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,596
'Cause she keeps eating my hair!

404
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,133
It looks fine to me.

405
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,390
Yeah, but she follows me around everywhere

406
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:10,435
and nibbles on my pigtails and gets horse slobber all over my head.

407
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,815
I see.

408
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,533
Oh, does your hair smell like candy?

409
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,403
Marshmallow Tresses Shampoo.

410
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,038
My favorite.

411
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,579
It's made with real live marshmallows!

412
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,785
Ah. Well, that explains it.

413
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,422
Dash loves marshmallows, too.

414
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,497
She does?

415
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,299
Oh my, yes.

416
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,917
In fact,

417
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,587
you two have lots of things in common.

418
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,932
She loves pretty ribbons, and things that glitter,

419
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,517
and anything pink.

420
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,973
Perhaps you should give her another chance.

421
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,937
I don't know.

422
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,275
She really, really likes you, Chelsea.

423
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,948
And you know, I'll bet she'd look wonderful in sparkly bows.

424
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,316
You think?

425
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,942
Hmm,

426
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,070
maybe I could pretty her up.

427
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,704
We could start with a manicure and then braid her hair.

428
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,867
Oh...

429
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,586
And then I could use the sparkles and then...

430
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,980
Hmm?

431
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,809
Hmm.

432
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,802
Yeah! Way to go!

433
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,049
I got this.

434
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,016
Excellent form, Marie, as always!

435
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,651
Pity you are too young to compete, hmm?

436
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,696
Mamselle Stacie, you are next. Remember,

437
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,032
you and your mount are as one.

438
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,197
You must be the horse!

439
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,402
Ah!

440
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,532
Now, allez-vous!

441
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,543
All right! Now we're talking!

442
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,054
Oh man, lam so good at this!

443
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,567
Whoa!

444
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,812
Ugh, yuck!

445
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,069
Mamselle Stacie.

446
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,617
Perhaps I did not explain.

447
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:14,080
You are supposed to jump through the hedge with the horse.

448
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,419
And that's for this year's holiday card.

449
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,473
Hiya!

450
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,524
Bonjour, mamselle. Now, show me what you've found!

451
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,284
It's classical. So boring!

452
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,712
You see in races they put roses on the horses...

453
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,164
I don't care what they're for.

454
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,834
Since Mother left it to us to decide,

455
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:09,431
I think the theme for the dance should be "Alpine Primroses in Summertime."

456
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,139
I was thinking "Robot Samurai."

457
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,481
What does that have to do with a horse show?

458
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,561
What do you think robot Samurai ride around on,

459
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,811
skateboards?

460
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,487
Really?

461
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,648
You can't put a robot on a horse it would fall off!

462
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:29,693
Mmm.

463
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,952
Horse!

464
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,334
Ahh!

465
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,571
Whoa!

466
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,247
All right!

467
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,384
Woo-hoo!

468
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,058
Where are you taking me?

469
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,912
Majestiques! A whole herd of them!

470
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,295
Something wrong, Aunt Marlene?

471
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,841
It's nothing, dear.

472
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,253
Have you had your lunch yet?

473
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,424
Something is wrong.

474
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,726
Please tell me. I'm a teenager, so I'll never let this drop.

475
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,681
I'm afraid it's nothing you can help with.

476
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,560
The fact is I may have to sell the academy.

477
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,569
Sell it? But why?

478
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,982
Too many bills, too few students.

479
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,527
I have tried to hold on, but two weeks ago,

480
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,831
I got an offer for the place from Madame Cheynet, of Ecole Montagne.

481
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,079
No doubt Philippe's idea.

482
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,412
He has never forgiven Etienne for coming here.

483
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,459
And if we don't win the tournament prize money, I'll have to accept.

484
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,509
You're not going to do it, are you?

485
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,761
Alpine has been in our family for generations. I was born here.

486
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,771
I'd be crushed to lose it.

487
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,608
But I may have no choice.

488
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,145
They are giving me until Tuesday to accept their offer.

489
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,107
But won't winning the race bring in new students?

490
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,950
Of course, that would be wonderful!

491
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,788
But truthfully, we haven't won a tournament in 11 years.

492
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,123
This year you've got a secret weapon,

493
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,121
the Roberts sisters!

494
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,624
Can you hold off the sale, just until after the tournament?

495
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,207
I can try. But, Skipper, really.

496
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,840
No time to talk! I've got to see a girl about a race!

497
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,990
Way to go, Barbie! Skipper!

498
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,822
That is one awesome horse!

499
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,751
Oh, Skipper, it was amazing! We were flying!

500
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,546
Soaring! This is the horse I've been looking for all my life!

501
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,589
But you can't say a word about her. Not until I say so.

502
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,135
Barbie, something's happened.

503
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,632
Promise you won't!

504
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,348
Pinky pledge!

505
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,012
When exactly are we too old for that?

506
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,263
Never!

507
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:36,853
Okay, my beautiful Majesty. See you tomorrow. Go on now.

508
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,694
Majesty, I like that.

509
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,032
But look, there's something I really need to tell you.

510
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,871
Lose the academy? That's terrible!

511
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,702
Poor Aunt Marlene.

512
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:57,460
Exactly. Which is why Alpine has to win this tournament.

513
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,759
I'm even violating my strict anti-involvement policy by entering dressage.

514
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,212
Well that's perfect, you're fantastic at dressage!

515
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,927
And that's why you have to run in the steeplechase.

516
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,260
You riding Majesty would totally demolish the competition!

517
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:15,065
Skipper, I can't. Etienne is riding for Alpine. It's tradition.

518
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,148
And besides, Majesty needs to stay a secret,

519
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,275
at least till I get her back to Malibu.

520
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,822
A secret? Why?

521
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:27,069
Because Philippe will recognize what she is and know there must be more like her.

522
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:32,036
After we leave, I don't want her herd hunted down and broken.

523
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,335
So Majestiques need to stay a fairy tale.

524
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,495
But what about the steeplechase?

525
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,422
What about us winning the tournament for Aunt Marlene?

526
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,675
Look, Etienne is a champion rider.

527
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,627
And remember, there's more than one event.

528
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:49,012
With you doing dressage, I'm sure Alpine's got everything they need.

529
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,535
Stacie?

530
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,711
You're not practicing for Saturday?

531
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,791
Yeah, I dunno, I'm kinda off horseback riding for now.

532
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,636
Really? But aren't you signed up for the cross-country trial?

533
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,176
Actually,

534
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,601
I was thinking about dropping out of that. It's not really my thing.

535
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:39,437
Okay, Stacie, what's wrong? Since when don't you like to compete?

536
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,936
Oh, face it, Barbie, I stink at riding.

537
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,193
I just don't get it. I've always aced everything I've tried!

538
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:55,749
Skateboards, mountain bikes, wakeboarding, skysurfing, motorcross.

539
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,996
So why can't I control a horse?

540
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,038
Stacie, your horse isn't a skateboard.

541
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,212
She's a living, breathing being, with her own feelings.

542
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,386
Yeah. She's made her feelings very clear to me.

543
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:14,100
Well, maybe you should try to work with her instead of just trying to control her.

544
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,803
Make friends, find out what she wants.

545
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,686
Make friends with a horse? Like what, take her to a movie?

546
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,148
You know what I mean. Just try it.

547
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,115
Oh, and, these sugar cubes won't hurt.

548
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:38,287
Hi, I'm Stacie! You know, the girl you've been trying to maim?

549
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,005
Here, have some cavities.

550
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,644
Hey!

551
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,767
She likes them! Got any more?

552
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:14,570
Welcome to the 108th Annual Inter-Academy Equestrian Tournament!

553
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:19,499
And, as always, we start things off with the perennially popular

554
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,702
pretty pony parade!

555
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:29,964
Isn't Dash pretty? And we both smell like marshmallows!

556
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,694
You're up next, Skipper. We're all behind you!

557
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,447
Hey, tech girl. Don't tell me you found an app for riding that thing.

558
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,406
No app needed. We're doing this strictly old school.

559
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,248
Next up in the dressage competition,

560
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,298
riding for Alpine, Skipper Roberts on Juniper.

561
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:09,480
And first place goes to Miss Skipper Roberts of Alpine!

562
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,937
Boo!

563
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,321
Perhaps I should acquire one of those tablets.

564
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:27,619
Our next event will be the cross-country competition.

565
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:31,206
Stacie Roberts on Pepper, now heading for the double rails of number seven.

566
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,634
And the jump is good!

567
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,504
Now approaching jump eight, the lighthouse.

568
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,887
Immediately followed by the fickle frank at number nine.

569
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,311
A smooth landing for Miss Roberts and Pepper.

570
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:48,560
Moving strongly now, and they beautifully adapt to the corners.

571
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,017
Now, jumping over the brush fence at 10!

572
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,064
Uh-oh, a run-out, that'll cost them points.

573
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,906
But they recover nicely and go for the triple bar!

574
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:11,459
A clean jump. Heading now for the final and most challenging jump, the keyhole!

575
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,672
Okay, we're friends now right? We go through this jump together this time,

576
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,469
not just me.

577
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,171
Pretty please?

578
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,436
A Perfect jump!

579
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,074
And here comes the judges' decision.

580
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:44,655
First place, Stephanie Coda and King's Cross of Ecole Montagne!

581
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:53,793
In second place, Stacie Roberts and Pepper of Alpine!

582
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:03,385
Second place? Not bad. But next year, we hammer them.

583
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,853
And that concludes the opening day competitions,

584
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:17,774
with Ecole Montagne and Alpine Academy tied for first place.

585
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:23,576
Tomorrow, the final event, the spectacular steeplechase at Bernwald Racetrack.

586
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:28,373
And don't forget the inter-academy formal dance tonight, right here at Alpine!

587
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,912
That's the best we've done in years.

588
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,914
What a great day for Alpine!

589
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,212
And a long one at that.

590
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,458
I suggest we all have a little rest before the dance.

591
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,088
Where's my blue pantyhose? My shoes shrunk!

592
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,890
Nobody move. How does my hair look?

593
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,690
You're too little for lipstick! No fair!

594
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,446
Barnaby! My shoe!

595
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,156
You might as well throw him the other one, maybe he can chew it to match.

596
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,454
Um, does this look funny?

597
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,711
Tuck it in!

598
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,045
Turn around!

599
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,050
Much better.

600
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,970
Is that, is that me?

601
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,066
I love it!

602
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,407
Would you like a glass of punch? It's very tasty.

603
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:52,332
There you go, and one for you. There you go. Would you like some?

604
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,407
Yes? All right.

605
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,951
Oh, how are you?

606
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,878
I know, isn't it beautiful?

607
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,954
Good to see you again.

608
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,668
Good evening, Etienne.

609
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,592
Konnichiwa. That's "hello" in Samurai!

610
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,970
Oh my.

611
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,966
What interesting decor.

612
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,226
I knew you'd love it.

613
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,809
Don't ask.

614
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,765
There we go.

615
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,437
Yes, I was out riding today.

616
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,770
Well, I think that it's going to be quite a bit easier now...

617
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,069
Whoa.

618
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,614
Look, the Odd Squad is staring.

619
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,995
Pretend they're not there.

620
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:40,379
I love this song! Marie, come dance with me!

621
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,873
Hey, nerd girl. You weren't too bad at the dressage trials today.

622
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,202
Thanks. Boy, that first prize is heavy.

623
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,458
Yeah, yeah. You got lucky.

624
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,668
You, uh, want to dance?

625
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,595
I wouldn't want to step on your little second-place feet.

626
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,631
I'll take a chance.

627
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,228
Whoa. What were the odds of that?

628
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,354
You didn't see that coming?

629
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:09,423
That is my punch you are drinking, you stuffed sauerkraut sausage!

630
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,631
It's mine, you pompous pickled pudding!

631
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,715
Creampuff!

632
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,924
Bon bon for brains!

633
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:16,975
Chocolate mousse!

634
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,804
I think I'm losing my appetite.

635
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:34,152
Oh, Stacie, I'm going out to the corral.

636
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,908
Yeah, yeah, that's nice. Have fun.

637
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,870
I'll be right back.

638
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,705
Chelsea!

639
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:28,960
Chelsea? Chelsea!

640
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,503
Chelsea!

641
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,347
Hang on, Chelsea!

642
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,475
Etienne!

643
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,473
Chelsea!

644
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,186
Chelsea? Chelsea?

645
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,572
Chelsea, can you hear me?

646
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,819
Chels...

647
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,288
Dash! Stop!

648
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,206
I'm okay.

649
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:09,626
She's okay, just a little shaken. She'll be fine.

650
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,458
Chelsea, why on Earth?

651
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:17,513
I just wanted to ride a big horse, like you and Barbie and Stacie do.

652
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,932
Oh, Chelsea.

653
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:23,887
I think you've done quite enough riding for one day.

654
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,687
Let's get you inside.

655
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:29,142
And Etienne, we'll need to get a doctor to look at your arm.

656
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,528
Thank goodness she's okay.

657
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,275
But what about our horses? They're all gone.

658
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,407
The race! We must go after them!

659
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,702
How? It's dark, and we don't know which way they went.

660
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:44,907
I can track them.

661
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,703
Jonas, you know how to do that?

662
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,163
I know these hills like Skipper knows her tablet.

663
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,339
My friends said we could use their horses.

664
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,881
Let's go!

665
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,052
We'll call the neighboring farms and ask them to keep a lookout for the runaways.

666
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,720
I'll help!

667
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,898
Come on, this way!

668
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,871
Hmm. What is it?

669
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,745
These tracks...

670
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,252
You see that set of prints?

671
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,046
That horse is coming from a different direction than the others.

672
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,089
Then it joins the rest here.

673
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,588
Huh, it's not wearing horseshoes.

674
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:41,468
Exactly. Then it appears to lead the herd away, in that direction.

675
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,411
I'm afraid that's it.

676
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,369
The prints lead onto these rocks, and then vanish.

677
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,452
Sorry.

678
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:16,962
Now what? The race is in a few hours, and Alpine's got no horses.

679
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,965
Aunt Marlene might as well kiss the school goodbye.

680
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,006
Wait! I know where they might be!

681
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,060
Good job, Majesty!

682
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,778
I wonder if she babysits. Four sugar cubes an hour and all the hay she can eat.

683
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,654
That horse...

684
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,907
The one with the pink mane.

685
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,539
What breed is it?

686
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,750
A very special one.

687
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,165
And they're our secret. Okay?

688
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,210
Looks like the steeplechase is still on!

689
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,513
Monsieur Philippe. What a pleasant surprise.

690
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:16,101
You think you're very clever, don't you? And you! Traitor! Turncoat!

691
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,481
Do not bother returning to L'Ecole!

692
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,446
Mamselle Barbie, I owe you a debt of gratitude.

693
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,158
I believe you have found a place I have searched for since I was a child...

694
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,698
The Valley Of The Majestiques.

695
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:32,458
Majestiques? But Monsieur, you said they were fairy tales!

696
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,498
That was for my brother's benefit.

697
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,750
I have always known they were real. And worth a king's ransom.

698
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,295
And now, I know they are somewhere on Alpine land.

699
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,055
As you've said, this is Alpine land.

700
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:51,101
Well, after today's race, this land will belong to Ecole Montagne,

701
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:54,472
and soon I will have all the time in the world to find them.

702
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,983
Unless, of course, Monsieur Etienne leaves you in the dust.

703
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:03,402
Oh, didn't you hear? My brother's broken arm will keep him from riding.

704
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,566
But do not worry. Once this land is mine,

705
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,075
I may let you look at the Majestiques...

706
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,577
For a price.

707
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,578
We have to win that race.

708
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,465
Day two of the tournament,

709
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,804
and we're here at Bernwald Racetrack for the concluding event,

710
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:30,382
the annual 3.2 kilometer steeplechase.

711
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:35,266
Alpine Academy and Ecole Montagne are tied going into this race.

712
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,057
Aren't Barbie and Skipper coming?

713
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,397
They'll make it here in time! I just know it!

714
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,989
Riding for Centre Equestre, Jason Randall.

715
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:52,371
Riding for Ecole Montagne, Monsieur Philippe Cheynet, on Hurricane!

716
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,491
You lose again, Etienne!

717
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,958
Ladies and gentlemen, an announcement.

718
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,250
Alpine Academy will not be racing this year.

719
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,046
lam sorry, Marlene.

720
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,211
We tried our best.

721
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,548
As we approach the top of the hour, registration is now...

722
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,054
Wait a moment! There's a late entry!

723
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,678
Riding for Alpine is

724
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,139
Barbie Roberts, on Majesty!

725
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,020
Etienne! Is that...

726
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,150
Yes.

727
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,233
A Majestique.

728
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,619
Easy, now. Easy.

729
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,538
The saddle's not so bad. You'll get used to it.

730
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,287
Whoa, it's okay Majesty.

731
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,890
That's a beautiful horse, Ms. Roberts. It will not be yours much longer.

732
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,138
We will see, Monsieur.

733
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,018
Wow! It's like they're real!

734
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,822
Rider's ready!

735
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,290
The wire is up, and they're off!

736
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:31,428
Easy,easy. It's all right.

737
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,810
Teacher's Pet takes the lead, Prima Donna in second, Way to Go in third!

738
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,261
Majesty is rearing at the gate.

739
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,739
That's it. Settle. It's okay.

740
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,324
Hiya!

741
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,207
Come on, Majesty. You can do it!

742
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,082
Way To Go moving into the number two spot

743
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,043
as riders head for the first water ditch!

744
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:19,718
Raclette is down!

745
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:31,196
You can do this, girl! It's just like the glacier streams!

746
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,452
We love you, Barbie!

747
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,706
Rounding the turn to jump four, it's Creme Brulee and

748
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,625
Way to Go leading the pack, with Prima Donna dropping back,

749
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,957
followed by Teacher's Pet with Hurricane gaining.

750
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,460
Oh, dear. Teacher's Pet has spilled its rider!

751
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,048
Go, you mangy beast!

752
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:12,814
Hurricane passes Prima Donna and challenges Creme Brulee for second

753
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,443
as they come to the hedge jump.

754
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:17,155
Majesty still trailing in last place.

755
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,658
What's this? Creme Brulee is out of the race!

756
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:29,000
That is just plain wrong. Come on, Majesty, let's show him!

757
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:37,338
Making a late charge, Majesty rockets to overtake Prima Donna!

758
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,769
Way to Go in first. Barbie Roberts on Majesty

759
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,267
continues a spectacular come from behind,

760
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:50,692
challenging reigning champion Philippe Cheynet on Hurricane for second!

761
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:04,198
Barbie Roberts is down! The saddle has come off her horse!

762
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,205
It looks like Miss Roberts and Majesty are out of the race!

763
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,545
He can't stop us. Come on, Majesty.

764
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,050
Born free, ride free!

765
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,186
Hurricane now closing in on Way To Go.

766
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:44,788
Hurricane and Way To Go are neck and neck.

767
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,282
Oh, Way To Go stumbles!

768
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,335
Way To Go at the inside fence refusing the jump.

769
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,461
Philippe Cheynet now firmly in first place.

770
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:57,627
Just one more jump before another victory for Ecole Montagne.

771
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,845
Alpine and the Majestiques are mine!

772
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:05,847
Wait a moment. Barbie Roberts is back in the race and gaining fast!

773
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,569
Philippe Cheynet takes the jump!

774
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,697
What's this? Unbelievable!

775
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,264
Barbie Roberts and Majesty down the stretch!

776
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,809
Philippe Cheynet furiously trying to take back the lead.

777
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,558
It's Majesty and Hurricane down the stretch!

778
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:02,775
And the winner for Alpine Academy is Barbie Roberts on Majesty!

779
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,379
You did it, Majesty, you did it!

780
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:25,423
Ladies and gentlemen! The overall Tournament Cup goes to

781
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:28,642
Alpine Equestrian Academy!

782
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,350
It is an outrage! I should have won that race!

783
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,810
I was unfairly distracted!

784
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:41,355
By what? Your own cheating?

785
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,442
We saw what you did, you penguin's patoot!

786
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,619
And you are the lint in a baboon's belly button!

787
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,113
Here we go again.

788
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:53,245
Taisez-vous! Ow!

789
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,704
Now go to your room! You are on Ie time out!

790
01:05:56,828 --> 01:06:00,207
But Maman! He started it!

791
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,883
You were magnifique!

792
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,724
Uh, thank you, uh...

793
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:17,933
Madame Cheynet, the owner of Ecole Montagne.

794
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,565
Bridgette, I won't be needing to sell Alpine.

795
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,692
Felicitations, Marlene.

796
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,738
lam most happy for you.

797
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,156
Maman...

798
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,118
This horse... Thelegendu.

799
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:37,294
I know. Isn't she beautiful?

800
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,963
Come, mon chouchou. I made soup.

801
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,212
Do I get a baguette this time?

802
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,104
Thank you. I love it.

803
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:01,731
Here's Stacie's last bag. Popcorn and I packed the rest of her stuff.

804
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,483
Hey, where is Popcorn?

805
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,154
on.

806
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,196
Well, I think that's everything.

807
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,785
I just want to thank you again, Aunt Marlene.

808
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,741
This has been the best summer ever.

809
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,624
No, I thank all of you.

810
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,630
Once Skipper posted her video of the race online,

811
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,583
our enrollment tripled!

812
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:28,637
I think we'll be teaching riders for many years to come.

813
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,965
At school, I signed up a whole bunch of students

814
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,221
for riding and dressage lessons,

815
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,601
and one wants to learn to play the banjo, but I signed him up anyway.

816
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,855
Well, that's the last of it.

817
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:47,610
Thanks for helping. You're not a bad guy! Sometimes.

818
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,483
Careful, you almost said something nice to me.

819
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:54,404
And since you like marshmallow shampoo so much,

820
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,162
I'm gonna send you my next favorite, Scent O' S'mores.

821
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,746
Yeah, me too. And I'm sorry about all those things I said.

822
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,631
You really are a great pony. And just my size.

823
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,257
Okay, I admit it. I'm gonna miss you.

824
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:13,841
Even though you gave my sister years' worth of embarrassing pictures of me,

825
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,101
you're still a very cool horse.

826
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:25,268
See you in Malibu, Majesty. I think you're gonna like California.

827
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,566
You have chosen an amazing horse, Barbie.

828
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:32,067
I am certain you and she will win many, many races together.

829
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,093
Barbie? Aren't you excited?

830
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,391
No. No, I won't do it.

831
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,679
Barbie, what are you doing?

832
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:04,816
Letting her go. I can't, Aunt Marlene. I just can't.

833
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,811
She belongs here with her family.

834
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,733
I could never take that away from her.

835
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,780
That decision comes from your heart. I think it's the right one.

836
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,131
I'll never forget you. Never. Now go.

837
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,994
If you come back, I know she will come back.

838
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:01,948
Come on, Barbie!

839
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,375
This thing won't drive itself!

840
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,399
Okay, now, who's got the boarding passes?
