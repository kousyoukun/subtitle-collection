00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,800
THE GLASS ARTIST

2
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,580
It is a wonderful store.
They sell so many beautiful things.

3
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,320
GLASS EXHIBITION
OCTOBER 26TH

4
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,840
Shade the text more.
And use brighter colors.

5
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,920
Make it look more enigmatic.

6
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,960
Well, but the rest
looks perfect...

7
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,700
More enigmatic, eh?

8
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,340
Did you hear, Mahiya? Our son
wants it to look more enigmatic.

9
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,570
Years ago, I was the one
who told you what to do, Vincent.

10
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,020
Get to work.

11
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,620
Vincent!

12
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,200
Enough with the trains.

13
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,000
Did you see what I just did?

14
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,080
I wet the brush
and I don't use too much paint.

15
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,690
- To make it look transparent.
- Like glass!

16
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,480
And then I add color.

17
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,420
Your mother never managed to draw anything...

18
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,220
All his designs
stayed in his head...

19
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,370
Time to manufacture it.

20
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,510
- What do you think?
- It looks great!

21
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,970
The most fun follows.

22
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,340
And now we soak it in cold water.

23
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,200
You see? It's easy.

24
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,100
WAR IS DECLARED!
Troops disembark in the Great Gorge

25
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,280
Your turn.
Blow, Vincent.

26
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,940
- But... I'm going to burn.
- This end does not burn.

27
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,480
Blow, son.

28
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,000
You have good lungs!
Thank goodness!

29
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,880
Go get some air.
You have done very well.

30
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,850
Yes!

31
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,650
Blue Djinn! Are you there?

32
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,080
You seem to be in a bad mood today.

33
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,170
Why are you in a bad mood?

34
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Let's see if they catch up with me! Quickly!

35
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,310
You're not going to win today, Malik!

36
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,310
I don't understand why you want to
to play with those guys.

37
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,850
You are not like them.

38
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,540
But if you would maybe let me
let me go to school...

39
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,540
And why do you want to waste
time at school?

40
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,090
A glass artist does not need
to know more than making glass,

41
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,710
reading, writing,
counting and some chemistry...

42
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,850
- But I would like to...
- And I'm already teaching you that!

43
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,050
Vincent?

44
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,400
Vincent!

45
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,540
Yes, Dad?

46
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,220
Those sketches and designs
you want to exhibit...

47
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,600
You have to order them.

48
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,800
It will take time for the gallery to
time to catalog them.

49
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,600
Oh, I'll see what I can do.

50
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,020
These are not bad at all.

51
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,970
Oh, the Djinn...

52
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,600
Ah...

53
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,940
What?

54
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,590
VINCENT OLIVER
405 - Business District
76589 - Beaumont Road

55
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,220
Dear Vincent,

56
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,740
I hope you are well.

57
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,660
I know that when I left
we were not in the same "syntony".

58
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,450
Just look, even to express myself
I think of music...

59
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,420
I will never forget the day I
I arrived at Waterfront Village.

60
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,170
That day I ran away and came across
for the first time with the glassware.

61
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,200
I had never seen
anything so beautiful.

62
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,800
It was magical.

63
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,350
Don't you find it curious...

64
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,430
...that you have found
the glassware just in time

65
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,440
to catch that crystal flower

66
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,400
and get to know you?

67
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,200
- Many would say it was...
- Fate.

68
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,970
Alliz? Alliz!

69
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,910
Where did that little girl go?

70
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,770
Enough with the games!

71
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,020
Ten.

72
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,140
The best fabrics
at the best price!

73
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,650
Mine are the best!
Go ahead! Buy them!

74
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Dad, can you buy me
some Gulab-yamun?

75
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,680
Dad, tell me how
you and mom met.

76
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,410
You know that story
story better than I do.

77
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,480
- Please, Dad.
- It's all right.

78
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
- Your mom was...
- A glass artist?

79
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,540
- That's right, Vincent. And he turned to your grandfather...
- My grandfather?

80
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,150
Yes, to my father, to look for work.

81
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,310
- He had never met...
- A woman who made crystal.

82
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,720
That's right! And I wasn't going to hire a

83
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,020
- until you see...
- ...some of his works.

84
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,280
And they were the best I had ever seen!

85
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,800
Yes! He loved
to tell me that story.

86
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,650
Go on, Dad.

87
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:50,480
Your mother was a born artist
and your grandfather valued that.

88
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,650
So he...

89
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,870
My dad had been sent
to protect the province

90
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,800
in the event that
war came to the South.

91
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,710
Everyone expected a lot from him.

92
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,880
It wasn't easy for me
to be Colonel Amano's daughter.

93
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,940
We were the center of attention.

94
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,080
Go away! We don't want your war here!

95
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,910
Get out of our town!

96
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,940
- Hey, why don't you shut up?
- Respect our army!

97
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,600
The Great Gorge is
a disputed territory.

98
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,480
It has many riches and very good
very good agricultural land.

99
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,100
OLIVER GLASSWARE

100
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,520
They claim it, we claim it.
That's why we are at war.

101
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,220
It is foolishness...

102
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,420
But then, whose land is it?

103
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:26,570
Vincent, the only land I care about
is the one where our glassware is.

104
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,370
And the beach below...
And its beautiful sand.

105
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,420
Did you find anything?

106
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,620
I asked you to throw this in the oven!

107
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,250
Ovens are for glass only.

108
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,540
My dad could have asked to be
sent to a big city.

109
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,650
But on a reconnaissance mission
stumbled upon the town of Waterfront.

110
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,600
He said it had its own
very cozy charm of its own,

111
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,740
and that's why he wanted to take us there.

112
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,080
I was more excited about the Faculty of Music
of the Municipal Academy.

113
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,940
Oh, Colonel Amano! Mrs. Amano!
How nice to see you again!

114
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,540
Good morning, Director Bhatti.
It is also a pleasure to see you.

115
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,620
Sorry if we are too early.

116
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,820
Not at all. I do not tolerate
latecomers.

117
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,170
Oh, this must be Alliz!
Welcome to our school, my dear.

118
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,880
How are you doing, Director Bhatti?

119
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,700
Ah, this is our music director,
Professor Ansari!

120
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,480
Good morning, Alliz.
I can't wait to hear you play.

121
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,510
Who is she?

122
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,140
I had never seen it before.

123
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,020
- Isn't she the colonel's daughter?
- Is she really?

124
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Oh, right.

125
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,020
According to my mother, he used his influence
to get her admitted to college.

126
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,310
According to my mom,
your mom knows everything.

127
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,140
Sadia, if you would shut your big mouth
you would realize how good she is!

128
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,400
It's amazing!

129
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,400
Djinn?

130
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,540
Is it you?

131
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,910
Are you following me?

132
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,870
I thought that that noisy viola was
the howling of the Djinn in the cave!

133
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,880
- It sounds as if it hurts your stomach....
- It's a violin, not a viola!

134
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,340
And the only one who seems to have
your stomach is rumbling is you!

135
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,150
Hey!

136
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,820
It's the Djinn!

137
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,710
I don't know what that is...

138
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,220
A Djinn?

139
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,350
Hey!

140
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,970
Djinns are spirits
made of fire without smoke.

141
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,200
They have special powers!

142
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,570
What do you mean by "special powers"?

143
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,340
The Djinns move
between their world and ours.

144
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,220
They can transform into animals
and sometimes even humans.

145
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,700
I once thought the postman's cat
the letter carrier's cat was a Djinn.

146
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,770
I thought I saw
spitting fire.

147
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,770
But it was just a little ball of hair.

148
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,170
Yuck, it was disgusting.

149
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,770
Some Djinns are good
and others are bad.

150
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,420
And in almost every town there is one.

151
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,110
The one in this village
lives in this cave.

152
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,250
And is this Djinn good or bad?

153
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,650
That's what I want to find out.

154
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,710
Always trying to chase strangers away
from this beach and this sand...

155
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,710
So it sure is good.

156
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,340
And what is so special about this arena?

157
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,340
What's so special about it?

158
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,020
Don't you know it's the
best sand in the world?

159
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,540
Is that so?

160
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,620
That's why my great-great-great-grandfather
founded the glassworks here.

161
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,100
It is made of silica,
that's why it's so white.

162
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,220
And what does glass have to do
glass have to do with sand?

163
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,450
You really don't know that glass
is made from sand?

164
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,370
How is it possible that glasses, bottles and even crystal
glass roses are made from this?

165
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,000
- Oh, Alliz...
- Eh?

166
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,370
- You know my name!
- Oh! Uh...

167
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,170
The sand merges with other things...

168
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,080
There is a formula, but it has to be
be done right or it will break.

169
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,800
- You're making it up.
- If you want I can show it to you...

170
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,400
I have to go.

171
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,540
See you later, Vincent!

172
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,850
He also knows my name...

173
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,620
Yummy!

174
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,200
Yes, it is tasty.

175
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,770
"If you know how to cook sand
you'll know how to bake anything."

176
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,140
Dad...

177
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,140
Mmm?

178
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,200
Colonel Amano's daughter doesn't believe
that the crystal came from the sand...

179
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,080
- So I was wondering if...
- Would you like to invite the Colonel's daughter?!

180
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,250
How did you think of that, son?

181
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,820
What if it burns with one of the furnaces?

182
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,650
Or if you get splinters in your hand?

183
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,540
Your father would shut us down!
That's what the army does!

184
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,680
It's okay, Dad.

185
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,140
And Professor Ansari has given me
some sheet music to get me up to speed...

186
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,770
Well, in my previous internship...

187
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,680
Behave yourself!

188
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,280
Haven't you considered
playing the flute?

189
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,820
I wish... But this was
in my attic and I had no choice.

190
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,170
My father always says
that if an instrument is...

191
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,650
Hello!

192
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,940
Alliz!

193
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,650
What are you doing here?

194
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,080
- Deliveries from my dad.
- He knows how to make glass, right?

195
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,970
Aha.

196
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,220
Penni, this is Vincent.

197
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,850
Good afternoon, Penni.

198
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,740
He claims that the glass
is made with sand.

199
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,110
But I don't believe him.

200
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,820
So he's going to prove it to me
by showing me the glassware.

201
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,680
Oh, when can I go?

202
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,280
- Today, tomorrow, next week?
- Friday. Go Friday.

203
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,110
- Can I come too?
- I really doubt you'd like it, Penni.

204
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,050
It's as if the sun lived there....

205
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,970
I thought the same thing when I was a kid.

206
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,110
But, even if it is very hot,
it takes a long time to melt

207
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,110
and let those bubbles go.

208
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,740
Do you see it? There are still some left.

209
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,250
Manufactures something.

210
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,200
I have never made
anything by myself, but...

211
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,020
I can try.

212
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,740
- Ah, you'll get burned!
- Only if I'm not careful.

213
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,340
Now we give it "a spontaneous touch".
Something fun.

214
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,200
"A spontaneous touch..."

215
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,570
It looks amazing, Vincent!

216
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,020
Hello?

217
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm back, Vincent!

218
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,450
Vincent?

219
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,450
He wasn't supposed to be back yet!

220
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,910
Hi, Vincent! I'm back!

221
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,420
Hello?

222
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,910
Didn't you hear me, Vincent?

223
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,910
Colonel Amano's daughter...

224
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,570
I'm Alliz.
How are you, Mr. Oliver?

225
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,910
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave, Alliz.

226
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,000
Shall I go to my room?

227
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,510
What do you think?

228
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,970
Not bad at all...

229
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,420
What is he doing here?

230
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,480
- Hey, did you bring us something, "crystal boy"? Let's see.
- Watch out!

231
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,540
Vincent.

232
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,880
- Oh, hello, Alliz.
- Good afternoon, Alliz.

233
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,860
Am I invisible or what?

234
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,080
Did you say something, Penni?

235
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,020
Do you... Do you know him?

236
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,900
Vincent is my oldest
oldest friend in this town.

237
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,540
We have known each other for a long time.

238
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,400
Let's go! I want to
eat some Gulab-yamun.

239
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,770
Yes, why not? Come on.

240
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,800
See you later, guys.

241
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,140
Goodbye, Tarek.

242
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,200
Kader, Navid... Wait for me.

243
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,910
Thousands of worlds
in one place!

244
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,940
One day I will make you something
I promise you!

245
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,770
Thousands of worlds...

246
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,170
Hello! Hello!

247
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,420
Let's make it a great closing!
With the heart!

248
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,000
Malik!

249
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,740
OLIVER GLASSWARE

250
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,200
Now people only buy glasses...

251
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,480
- You used another color.
- We're out of copper.

252
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,170
The army plunders everything in its path...

253
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,570
- Maybe I should start making glasses....
- You won't learn anything if you just make glasses.

254
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,420
- Did you really like it, Dad?
- Of course I did!

255
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,670
I wish I could play
as well as you do!

256
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,420
But that will never be possible...

257
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,000
Your father, the General, says that
soldiers don't have time for the violin.

258
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,970
Ah, yes...
That's the way it is, Nadia.

259
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,680
It's time for you to go to sleep, Alliz.
to go to sleep, Alliz.

260
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,800
Dad instilled in me a love
for art and music.

261
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,220
He worked so hard
to protect us

262
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,880
that I would do anything
to see him happy.

263
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,910
I always felt
so proud of him.

264
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,200
Even when the war was raging and the enemy was gaining ground
and the enemy was gaining ground,

265
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,770
he was always striving
to maintain morale.

266
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,740
One, two, one, two...

267
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,710
One, two, one, two...

268
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,480
Platoon, stop!

269
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,420
- Reza, take over.
- Yes, sir!

270
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,710
It's about time!

271
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,510
Mrs. Amano!

272
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
But look who it is, Alliz.

273
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,080
Good afternoon, Mrs. Amano.
Oh, hello, Alliz.

274
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,820
Good afternoon, Malik.
You look very handsome in that uniform.

275
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,450
Doesn't he look handsome
in your uniform, Alliz?

276
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,570
We were going to have chai tea.
Why don't you join us?

277
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,800
I insist.

278
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,650
When they started recruiting,
I was one of the first to enlist.

279
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,700
You are such a noble young man!

280
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,150
I know. Besides...

281
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,110
Freshly baked cake, Mrs. Amano.

282
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,360
It's our famous freshly baked apricot
freshly baked apricot pie.

283
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,540
Compliments of the house, I guess.

284
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,920
Of course!

285
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,020
It is an honor to welcome Colonel Amano's daughter and wife to my cafeteria.
of Colonel Amano in my cafeteria.

286
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:11,000
- Of course! How kind of you, Mrs. Popolzai.
- Yes, we thank you for your kindness.

287
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,620
Mrs. Popolzai, daddy sent me
to deliver your glasses to you.

288
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,740
Vincent?

289
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,450
Hey! Look everybody!
It's the son of that cowardly pacifist!

290
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,740
The pacifist's son...

291
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,050
What a disgrace...

292
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,050
We don't want people like you here...

293
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,970
But, Dad, it's one of your favorites...!

294
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,970
You never wanted to sell it!
You like it very much!

295
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,970
You need colors to work with.

296
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,170
- Dad?
- Mmm?

297
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,600
The Young Recruits...

298
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,250
Yes?

299
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,970
It's just that most of the
the kids in the village have already enlisted...

300
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,000
For his parents
should not have allowed them to do so.

301
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,250
Mother, come and see!

302
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,180
What the hell?!

303
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,510
- Don't get in the way, Lina!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

304
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,180
Oh, Alliz!

305
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,470
- Dad!
- Daughter!

306
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,200
We miss you so much!

307
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,620
I brought you a present, Alliz.

308
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,880
Something worthy of your talent.

309
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,050
A very special violin.

310
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,940
An important General
also wanted it...

311
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,940
But I won it
in a Carrom game.

312
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,970
It has someone's name written on it.

313
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,820
Alliz, that instrument
is a spoil of war.

314
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,250
Owning such a violin is extremely rare.

315
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,620
Don't think about it so much.
Just feel grateful.

316
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,420
Every time dad came home,
it was like partying.

317
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,540
But now I know that
war is no party.

318
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,940
It is a disease...

319
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,010
...that spreads and infects
everyone.

320
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:44,000
19435-1419 equals...

321
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,200
But what the hell...?

322
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,570
Open up, Mr. Oliver!

323
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,170
Yes! Yes! I heard!

324
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,220
Colonel Amano?

325
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,970
- You have no right to enter...!
- Of course he does.

326
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,600
- I've come to talk business.
- Business?

327
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,400
- I have nothing to discuss with the army!
- At ease, soldiers!

328
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,570
Rest.

329
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,340
It is in your best interest to listen to me, Tomás.

330
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,650
Have.

331
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,060
I think it is better not to
not to involve your child.

332
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,230
He and I don't keep secrets from each other...
And we never will.

333
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,770
- What's that?
- I've never seen anything like it before.

334
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,540
Precisely because it is secret.

335
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,610
It is called "Mercury Rectifier".

336
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,900
It will help us propel our new... amphibious
new... amphibious aircraft.

337
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,970
As you will notice, the glass
of this housing is damaged.

338
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:31,020
Surely a master craftsman
like you will be able to repair it.

339
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,810
Listen! We will not help you
manufacture weapons of war!

340
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,100
Isn't there some way
to dissuade you, Mr. Oliver?

341
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,620
What do you think?

342
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,350
Let go of me now, you bunch of
brainless puppets!

343
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,740
Let him go!

344
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,400
Vincent, no!

345
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,280
I wouldn't do it if I were you, kid.

346
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,020
Let me go! Let me go now!

347
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,110
Tomás Oliver, will be sent to the
Army Training Center

348
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,570
and from there it will go directly to the front.

349
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,490
No... You can't!

350
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,600
Let me go now!

351
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,970
Vincent can't stay here alone!

352
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,480
He has no one else
to take care of him!

353
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,110
And he is not yet ready to
to take care of the glassware.

354
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,940
Then the best solution would be...

355
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,450
It is well...

356
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,400
- But I want something in return.
- Do you think you are in a position to negotiate?

357
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,940
Provide me with all the
necessary materials

358
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,600
for Vincent to complete his training.

359
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,740
Utensils, chemicals...

360
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,020
According to my research, only one type of crystal can be
one type of crystal at a time...

361
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,540
Which favors the product
but delays production!

362
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,110
As you will understand, the glass for these housings requires a special formula.
requires a special formula.

363
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,970
And this assignment is top secret.

364
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,340
That's what I was getting at.

365
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,000
And those rectifiers
would be a great danger

366
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,480
should they ever fall into enemy hands.
into enemy hands.

367
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,770
Clearly.

368
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,620
What if we tried the usual?
It would be a good front, wouldn't it?

369
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,250
You will be provided with everything you need
to manufacture the housings.

370
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,450
As well as what you requested.

371
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,750
- Careful!
- Yes, daddy.

372
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,850
- Hold it.
- I've got it.

373
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,510
Well...

374
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,420
We already delivered a part...
Sorry, Vincent.

375
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,570
- I think I heard something.
- What is it?

376
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,340
W-We are under attack?

377
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,620
Over there!
See those symbols?

378
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,170
Don't worry.
They are one of us.

379
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,110
Congratulations, Mr. Oliver... And Vincent.

380
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,530
The housings they manufactured
for the mercury rectifiers

381
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,970
have been approved by
the engineers of our Army.

382
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,710
Vincent had nothing to do with it.

383
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,370
There are fewer empty shelves
since the last time I was here.

384
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,940
Can I take a closer look?

385
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,140
Be careful not to break anything.

386
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,280
This one conveys a lot of calm.
The colors are beautiful!

387
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,370
- How was this possible?
- The blue color comes from copper...

388
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,340
And the green of iron.

389
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,510
Well, I must congratulate you, Mr. Oliver.
It is an exquisite piece.

390
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,910
I didn't make it.
Vincent did.

391
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,920
He has his mother's talent.

392
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,400
- I want this part.
- You will have to pay for it.

393
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,420
Of course!

394
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,220
How could you buy anything
from that pacifist?!

395
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,880
My dear, I doubt that a 14 year-old boy
can be called a "pacifist" anymore.

396
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,370
Vincent...

397
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:45,390
I brought you this sculpture as a gift
for I have bad news for you.

398
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
The war is not going well...

399
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,380
Our garrison in the Great Gorge has been decimated...
has been decimated...

400
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,910
And the enemy has regrouped...

401
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,420
Because of that, I must leave for the north
with the rest of my battalion.

402
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,420
Tomorrow.

403
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,110
Are you going to the Grand Gorge?

404
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,620
Alliz, a few Young Recruits will join us to serve
will accompany us to serve

405
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,910
as errand boys and orderlies,
including your friend, Malik Khan.

406
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,770
Attention! Listen to me!
I have something to tell you!

407
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,880
Citizens! As a soldier myself,
today I would like to thank you

408
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,020
for his sacrifice in allowing us to take his children
to take us to his children and brothers and sisters,

409
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,170
- their husbands and fathers to the...
- And their daughters.

410
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:38,910
Of course! And their daughters,
to war.

411
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,190
Our enemies are more determined
more determined than ever,

412
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,310
but they underestimate the love
we have for our land.

413
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,770
I promise you that I will not rest
until I give you back your loved ones...

414
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,280
Safe and victorious!

415
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,540
It's time, my love.

416
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,540
- I'm almost envious that you can leave here.
- Not now...

417
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,740
- I'm doing this for you, Alliz.
- What is it?

418
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,850
- Then go to war.
- For me? That's ridiculous!

419
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,420
- Someday, I will win your affection.
- My love?

420
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,940
- All soldiers. Last call.
- No! Dad!

421
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,500
Time to go!

422
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,370
Dad, please don't go.
Please don't leave me!

423
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,410
Be brave, my child.

424
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,910
- Be brave.
- But, Dad...

425
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,710
- Great job, Vincent.
- Thank you, Dad.

426
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,910
Oh, I'll go!

427
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,140
I must get some air.

428
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,420
Alliz?

429
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,850
Hello, Vincent.

430
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,250
Doesn't it bother you to be
you being seen here?

431
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,110
We are not very popular...

432
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,850
So many wonderful objects!

433
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,080
- Did you make this one?
- How did you know?

434
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:14,880
It was easy to guess.

435
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,880
- This one too?
- Aha.

436
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,000
My father bought one of your pieces.

437
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,940
Yes... It was one of the few
we have sold lately.

438
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,200
Are you making a new one?
Can I see it?

439
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,000
The last time I visited
the workshop, I was kicked out.

440
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,850
- I'm afraid it won't be possible...
- One look and that's it.

441
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,740
Dad, we have visitors!

442
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,510
Look who's here, Dad...
It's Alliz Amano.

443
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,850
Yes... Uh...

444
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,340
Good morning, Mr. Oliver.

445
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,420
Ms. Amano...

446
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,400
Would you like to stay for
for chai tea?

447
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,340
And Director Bhatti
tried to catch her...

448
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,450
And why didn't you open the window
so that it would fly away?

449
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,560
He did open it, but I didn't look at it....

450
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,640
So he flew
over his head,

451
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,700
and when he raised his eyes,
guess what?

452
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,170
- No way...
- Yes, it was!

453
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,420
Shh! A little respect!

454
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:55,200
You should not be witnesses to this....
None of us.

455
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,110
Curfew is almost upon us...
You'd better go back to your homes.

456
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,860
Alliz! Over here! Quickly!

457
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,280
Vincent!

458
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:10,850
Let's go.

459
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,760
Let's wait for them to give the "all clear" signal
as we were taught in school.

460
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,310
I was very afraid...

461
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,970
Me too.

462
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
I have never seen bombs...

463
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:27,620
- My dad must be worried.
- My mom too, I think.

464
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,970
The square is very quiet...

465
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,940
Oh, I could use some Gulab-yamun
some Gulab-yamun.

466
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,340
Malik always says he misses
Mrs. Abasi's Gulab-yamun.

467
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,020
- Malik?
- Uh-huh.

468
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,340
It must be horrible for him
to be so far away from home...

469
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,170
- So far from...
- How do you know that?

470
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,340
What? Oh, it's just that
he usually sends me letters.

471
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,200
But he hasn't written to me for months...
Neither has my dad.

472
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,800
- And how long has he been sending you letters?
- For some time now.

473
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,920
Malik missed his home
missing his home

474
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,540
and my dad asked me
to write to him.

475
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,880
And I imagine that someday
you will marry him.

476
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,080
What are you talking about?

477
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,620
Did a bomb
hit your head?

478
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,370
You will marry Malik Khan...

479
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:17,280
And you will be the wife of a military man
just like your mother.

480
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,740
What's wrong with that?
My father is a very brave man

481
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,720
who went to war, just like Malik,
unlike you...

482
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,940
Go ahead, say it!

483
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,590
Don't tell me what to say
or who I should marry or not!

484
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,600
I'm not marrying anyone!

485
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,020
I am going to become
a great violinist...

486
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,950
But for all your talent,
you will never be an artist.

487
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,850
What do you mean, I'll never be...?
What do you mean?

488
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,500
You don't create, you only interpret
what someone else composed.

489
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,250
What I do is original,
it comes from my imagination.

490
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,510
When I play the violin
I do it with all my heart.

491
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,500
I was promised a place
at the Conservatory of the capital

492
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,450
after graduating from school.

493
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,740
Alliz... That's great...

494
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:07,880
You may be an artist, Vincent...
But at what cost to your country?

495
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,310
Do you think I'm... a coward?

496
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,740
I return this to you.

497
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,770
I'll walk you home.

498
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,710
Alliz, the soldiers have been looking for you
searched for you everywhere!

499
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,420
Don't worry, Mother.
I'm here.

500
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,450
Alliz, we have received word that
your father is missing in action.

501
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,370
They believe him... dead.

502
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,110
No...

503
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,450
Good morning, Vincent!

504
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:44,080
- Congratulations on your art exhibition.
- Thank you, Riza.

505
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,370
- My wife and I will travel to the capital to see it.
- We are very proud of you, Vincent.

506
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,050
Thank you very much, madam.

507
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,710
Courtesy of the house, Vincent.
To celebrate the occasion.

508
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,220
Thank you very much.

509
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,050
I couldn't believe that
my dad had died.

510
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,250
Whenever he left,
he found a way to come back...

511
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,370
He always looked forward to hearing me play.

512
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,800
So I kept playing... for him.

513
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,940
You have done very well!
I think you're ready for the recital.

514
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,170
That night there will be only one

515
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:34,370
performed by our talented violinist, Alliz Amano
violinist, Alliz Amano.

516
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,880
Thank you very much, Professor Ansari.

517
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,200
That's great, Alliz.

518
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,710
I wish I could play
as well as you do!

519
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,590
But for all your talent,
you will never be an artist.

520
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,110
- Good morning, Tomás.
- Good morning, Dom.

521
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,340
If you bring me bills, you'd better go.

522
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,110
I just brought the mail.

523
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,480
- Who sent Vincent a letter?
- Yes, who knows?

524
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:35,820
I am invited to Alliz's recital.
She reserved a seat for me.

525
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,050
"You must show this invitation
in order to enter."

526
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,300
How elegant!

527
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,770
One day I will make you something
I promise you!

528
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,510
No! No, no, no, no...

529
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,410
- Vincent?
- No way! Ah!

530
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:46,000
There is no more gold! Now what will I use to make the body, legs and hook?
the body, the legs and the hook?

531
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,420
Maybe there's some back here....
No, there isn't either!

532
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,080
No... No!

533
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,110
Yeah, yeah, son.
We'll think of something.

534
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,800
There is plenty of gold here.

535
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,080
You can't melt mom's headdress....

536
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,020
She had fragile lungs
and she should not have dedicated herself to this profession...

537
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:14,170
But he realized what a big role his talent would play in his life.
his talent would play in his life.

538
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,370
And that's what I would want
you to do.

539
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,710
This coat is too patched!

540
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,220
Maybe there is something else to wear.

541
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,580
Aside from your mother's old dress,
it's the best there is.

542
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,480
You look presentable.

543
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:50,970
Vincent...

544
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,710
Aren't you forgetting something?

545
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,800
Thank you, Dad.

546
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,940
Go and have the time of your life.

547
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,280
- Hold it right there!
- No, please! I'm late!

548
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,700
Stay where you are.

549
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,400
Don't you know about the curfew?

550
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,560
- Are you a soldier?
- No, I'm...

551
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,940
We were informed that there are soldiers without identification
on the outskirts of the city...

552
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,970
For sure deserters who
are wanted by both sides.

553
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,970
They may be dangerous and desperate.
That is why we were ordered to be alert.

554
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,850
- You're a deserter, aren't you?
- What?

555
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,820
No, I was simply invited to the recital.

556
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,600
Wait a minute, I know you!
You are the son of that lunatic.

557
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,280
- And who invited you to the recital?
- Alliz Amano...

558
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,740
- The colonel's daughter.
- Colonel Amano's daughter? He invited you?

559
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,510
That's right, look.

560
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,050
What have you got there, eh?
Let me see!

561
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
My stomach is upset.

562
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,740
RESERVED

563
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,420
- Be careful!
- Give it back, Sheriff!

564
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,650
- But I don't know what's in it...
- Just give it back to him!

565
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,480
No, not yet...
Please don't...

566
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,540
Okay, you can go now.

567
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,880
Oh, ah... Could I have my invitation
my invitation, please?

568
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,820
Are you from here?

569
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,710
Catch it!

570
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,600
No! No...

571
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,500
What's wrong with you, you idiot!

572
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,850
What's wrong with me?
Please think.

573
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:03,770
Who could invite someone like him or
like his cowardly father to the recital?

574
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,420
It sure is a sham!

575
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:08,200
- And if not?
- Well, it hadn't occurred to me....

576
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:28,970
Good evening.
I'm here to listen to the recital.

577
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,020
- You're late!
- It's just that...

578
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:34,480
Since you've just started,
I think I can place you in the back...

579
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,220
- Your invitation?
- It's just that...

580
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,250
Some guards stopped me by the station....
They took it away from me!

581
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,000
Without an invitation, no one gets in!

582
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,390
We were asked to be very cautious!
There are deserters on the prowl!

583
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,800
- But Alliz Amano invited me...
- No invitation, no one gets in!

584
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,100
It is a special occasion.

585
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,800
- No invitation...!
- ...no one gets in.

586
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,770
I understand.

587
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,480
RESERVED

588
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,880
There she is!
Please talk to her, Mrs. Amano.

589
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,880
Alliz, what's taking you so long?
It's time to go on!

590
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,570
I just need a moment...

591
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,620
Think of all the people
who want to hear you play.

592
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,850
You, Colonel Amano's daughter!
Do you want to let them down?

593
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,170
No.

594
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,050
Or your dad?

595
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,250
Then come out, Alliz.
And dedicate it to your dad.

596
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,140
Ladies and gentlemen, having heard our talented
our talented young women

597
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,350
I know you will agree that
the musical future of our country

598
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,720
is in good hands.

599
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:57,700
And now I would like to introduce
our best student: Alliz Amano.

600
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,820
A long time ago...

601
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:07,170
Some time ago, someone told me that
a real artist must create.

602
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,050
So I composed this.

603
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,200
The deserters?

604
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,480
Colonel Amano...

605
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,970
Dad...

606
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,850
I'm sure you've heard about
how brave Malik was,

607
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,740
what was in the newspapers.

608
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,170
But much more happened.

609
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:40,770
The platoons of my father's battalion had been fighting on other fronts for years.
had been fighting on other fronts for years.

610
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,770
And they were sent to make a last-ditch effort
to control the Great Gorge.

611
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,140
It was a territory that neither side was
was willing to cede.

612
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,620
Don't stop!

613
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:57,650
Be brave, soldiers,
like those who preceded you!

614
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,750
- They sure weren't that soaking wet....
- You said it yourself.

615
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,110
Advance, soldiers! Advance!

616
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,900
Quickly! Keep moving!

617
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,310
No...

618
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:43,600
Pray!

619
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:16,710
- Move!
- Move fast!

620
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,850
Colonel Amano...

621
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,050
No!

622
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,110
Colonel...

623
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:38,000
Colonel... Don't worry, I'm here.

624
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,510
Boy... What about my soldiers?

625
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:53,670
Navid!
I found Kader!

626
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,600
Malik had given me back
to my dad...

627
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,250
I owed him everything.

628
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,620
See what a real hero looks like, my dear,
because in your mirror you won't see one.

629
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,820
Penni! Tarek!

630
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,940
- Oh, good afternoon, Vincent.
- And Alliz? Where is she?

631
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,280
He leaves town
with his parents...

632
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,570
...And with Malik.

633
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,740
Alliz?

634
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,100
Alliz!

635
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,940
What the hell?

636
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,370
- Let me talk to Alliz.
- He is not here!

637
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,770
May I speak to the Colonel?

638
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,080
That will not be possible!

639
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,450
Let me talk to her, please!

640
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:46,400
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Alliz! Alliz, please come out!

641
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Let go of me!

642
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,800
Go now!

643
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,300
- Mother?
- Mmm?

644
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:02,120
I heard screams.

645
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,470
Don't worry, Alliz.

646
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,050
It was just the soldiers
chasing away a tramp.

647
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,420
I hope that fuss
didn't upset you, Dad.

648
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,650
- I am going to help you.
- With what?

649
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:48,140
I have lost Alliz
because of this war...

650
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:49,940
I want it to end!

651
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,750
- We have to increase production!
- We had already discussed this.

652
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:58,510
I don't need your help.
Besides, you have your own work to do.

653
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,650
Then I will run away from here...
And join the army.

654
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,080
Add this to the lot
of rectifiers.

655
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,370
It will help the glass to temper.

656
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:16,050
A spoil of war...
Just like me.

657
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,800
What did you do with the marjor sculpture?

658
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,800
I sold it to Dom.

659
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,420
The letter carrier?
And what would he want it for?

660
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,600
To give a gift to his mother.

661
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,050
Alliz!

662
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,850
How are you doing, Mr. Oliver?

663
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,140
Can I help you with anything, my dear?

664
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:31,420
- Well, well...
- I'm afraid Vincent is not here.

665
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:36,600
- I don't know what's gotten into that young man lately.
- Oh, it's all right.

666
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,020
May I give this to you, please?

667
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:47,620
I'm leaving... tonight.

668
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,940
C-I understand.

669
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,090
I will deliver it tomorrow.
We still have pending orders...

670
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,050
Thank you very much... for everything.

671
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,970
You are always welcome here, my dear.

672
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,140
Hey, hurry up!
Put it down now!

673
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,020
Slowly!
Slowly!

674
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,800
Vincent...! You've been acting very strange lately...

675
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:47,700
- What's going on?
- We have to leave.

676
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,480
Hey, Oliver!
Put that box down now!

677
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,250
What's the matter, son?
You can tell me.

678
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:59,370
Those people and their damn war...
They despise us...

679
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,820
But you'll see...
You'll see!

680
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:06,050
Vincent... What did you do?

681
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:10,270
I made some minor adjustments
to their precious rectifiers.

682
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:07,650
Vincent! I know things have been tough,
but don't let the hatred consume you!

683
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,710
We have to be better than them.

684
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,970
I just wanted to stop them from taking off....

685
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:22,800
What is happening?

686
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,140
Turn it back up!

687
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:37,400
- Hey, put it back down!
- What do you think you're doing?

688
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:10,700
But what have I done?

689
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:31,000
I'm so sorry, Dad...
I'm so sorry, dad.

690
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,310
Oh, my son...

691
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,710
This is ridiculous!

692
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,050
Quick! Get us out of here!

693
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:07,770
Dad, it has to be thrown!

694
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,600
- It must be destroyed!
- Wait!

695
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:15,800
Vincent, wait!

696
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,870
DAD!

697
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:54,710
Vincent...?

698
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:35,080
I miss you, Vincent.
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.

699
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,400
You were never a coward.

700
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:41,400
You were right.
A true artist must create.

701
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:46,940
Because without art and music, what else is left in this world full of conflict and war?
in this world full of conflict and war?

702
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:49,510
I wish you could have attended my recital....

703
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,740
I had a surprise in store for you.

704
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,740
By the time you read this,
I will have already left town.

705
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,020
But I want you to know
that I will be waiting for you.

706
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,880
I love you, Vincent.

707
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:37,650
GLASS EXHIBITION

708
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,310
Ladies and Gentlemen!

709
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:16,820
The moment of the evening has arrived
in which I must congratulate the artist...

710
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:19,250
To my son, Vincent Oliver.

711
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:24,340
Perhaps not many people know that
glass is made from sand.

712
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:29,540
Have you ever held sand in your hand
and stared at every grain?

713
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:34,450
What if I told you that every grain
of sand in the world is unique?

714
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,850
How do I know?

715
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,650
Well, I don't know!

716
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:43,740
Because for that I would have to examine
every grain of sand on the planet.

717
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:45,740
And I doubt that he will succeed in doing so.

718
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,820
Maybe my eyesight is no longer
as good as it used to be...

719
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,050
But there is one thing of which
I am sure of.

720
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,510
That there is only one Vincent Oliver.

721
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:01,420
There is no one else with his imagination,
his skill and his passion for glass,

722
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,080
with all its infinite and
and magnificent possibilities.

723
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:07,970
Vincent, I always pushed you
to be the best artist.

724
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:10,140
I hope it has brought you
brought you happiness.

725
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,200
- Say a few words, Vincent!
- Say a few words! Say a few words!

726
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,910
I am touched to see you all here.

727
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,110
Thank you very much, Dad.

728
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:24,080
For being my teacher,
my father and my friend.

729
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,400
My friend...

730
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,910
The crystal will always
will always be part of my life.

731
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,080
My mother, Mahiya,
was also a glass artist.

732
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,900
One day, he walked into my grandfather's
my grandfather's glass shop, looking for a job.

733
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,600
His works were the most beautiful
ever seen.

734
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,910
- I'll make some chai tea.
- I'll make some chai tea.

735
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,620
"It's like the sun lives there..."
