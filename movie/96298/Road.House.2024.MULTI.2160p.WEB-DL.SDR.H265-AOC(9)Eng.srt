1
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,510
Hi, excuse me.

2
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,010
Yeah, I'm looking for Carter Ford.

3
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,640
Do you mind pointing him out to me?

4
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,900
I hope he's not the bald one.

5
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,190
Guy with the ink.

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,400
He's takin' all comers.

7
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,130
Come on!

8
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,300
A little back-of-the-envelope arithmetic says

9
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,350
that's six in a row for the illustrious Carter Ford.

10
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,430
Who wants to get in there, make it seven, huh?

11
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,810
Who wants to do it?

12
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,890
It's winner-take-all tonight, y'all.

13
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,520
It's just a bunch of money in a bucket.

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,270
Carter Ford's got six. Who's gonna get one?

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,650
I'm gonna tape you. Arms flat.

16
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
Someone step in. - No?

17
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,780
Let's get this goin'! Now, who wants to see another fight?

18
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,030
- Fucking guy. - You ever done this before?

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,620
- Who the fuck is this? - All right, a superhero.

20
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,250
Close it up! Come on.

21
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,480
Jesus, Carter. You know who that is?

22
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,400
Nah. Nope.

23
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm not fightin' that fucking guy. No fuckin' way!

24
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,620
No fuckin' way. There's no fuckin' way.

25
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,700
Yeah, fuck you.

26
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,830
I don't give a fuck. I'm not...

27
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,410
- He's that fucking guy. - You ain't gonna fight for your money?

28
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,660
Why would I fight that guy?

29
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,790
- Keep your fuckin' money! - All right, get outta here.

30
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,290
I don't want your fuckin' money.

31
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,000
- You know who the fuck he is? - Let's go.

32
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,920
I'll fight any fuckin' one of you. I'll fuckin' beat your ass.

33
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,340
You fuckin' fight him!

34
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,170
- Get your ass back in there! - I'm not fightin' that fucking guy.

35
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,680
You can all go fuck yourselves! Fuck you!

36
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,890
Fuck you!

37
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,180
Fuck you too!

38
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,350
- Fuck that shit! Bullshit! - Get out! Get out!

39
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,980
There you go. Here's your money.

40
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,900
- No! Come on. - I don't make the rules, honey.

41
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,910
Hey! Dalton!

42
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,870
Where you goin'?

43
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,000
You just lost me 500 bucks, asshole.

44
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,380
You sure you thought this all the way through?

45
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,020
Hey, where you goin'?

46
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,020
You're not gonna take your knife?

47
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,070
Shit.

48
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,290
Excuse me.

49
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,510
It's a nice little scam you got goin' on in there.

50
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,640
All you need is for the opponent to know who you are...

51
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,010
Where is it?

52
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,390
Know your history, and then they'll be too afraid to fight.

53
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,190
- That's fuckin' brilliant, man. - Yeah.

54
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,650
Yeah, well, beats workin'.

55
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,440
You know, it actually took me a second to recognize you.

56
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,490
Oh... Oh, God.

57
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,820
Um, do you need a ambulance or something?

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Nope.

59
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,740
You know you got a big-ass knife stickin' outta you?

60
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,330
Can you hold this?

61
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,830
Sure.

62
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,330
It's gonna bleed when I take it out.

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,630
Oh, shit!

64
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,470
It's gonna leave a nasty scar...

65
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,140
but it's easier this way.

66
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,220
- Wow, it seems like you do this a lot. - Huh?

67
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,560
Yeah.

68
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,810
Patience and a keen interest in the result...

69
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,690
that's all it takes.

70
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,650
So listen, I own a roadhouse.

71
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,200
Out in the Florida Keys.

72
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
A roadhouse, huh?

73
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,660
Hemingway used to drink there.

74
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,450
You know... Ernest Hemingway?

75
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,580
Good for you.

76
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,950
It's always been a rowdy place.

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,410
People come to blow off steam.

78
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,130
But lately it's been attractin' the wrong clientele.

79
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,540
Come in every night. They trash the place.

80
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,000
The cops are no fuckin' help.

81
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,090
All my fuckin' bouncers have ran off.

82
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,340
Hand me that.

83
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,180
Anyway, I finally decided I needed some outside help.

84
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,140
A friend of mine suggested I come talk to some guy named Carter Ford.

85
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,560
Yeah, well... Carter seems good with his hands.

86
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,230
No, you'd be better.

87
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,770
I can pay you good money. 5k a week... just for a month.

88
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,190
And I can put you up.

89
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,530
I'm all booked up. Sorry.

90
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,070
'Scuse me? I mean, it's 20 grand.

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,410
And judging by your car, you need that shit.

92
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,700
Well, I like my car.

93
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,040
Okay, that's gotta be more than you're makin' for...

94
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,410
whatever the hell you call this.

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,880
Try Carter.

96
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,250
Look, at least let me text you my number.

97
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,420
I don't have a phone, so...

98
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,510
Well, hold on.

99
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,300
I'll write it down on a pen and paper, just like our ancestors did.

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm Frankie.

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Think about it.

102
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,390
You have a good night, ma'am.

103
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,900
This ain't the Holiday Inn, pal.

104
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,360
I'll move it. I'm movin'.

105
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,750
He's movin' and a shakin'.

106
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,210
Benjamin gets blocked by Calvino with 30 seconds down.

107
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,250
An overhand right landed by the challenger

108
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,760
with a straight left-left-right combination.

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,180
And Benjamin is lifting up the champion and pushing him away!

110
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,800
There's 16 left to go in the round.

111
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,600
And now here comes Calvino. He lands a right.

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,810
Couple of shots landed by the challenger.

113
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,150
Benjamin landing some lefts and rights. Calvino hits high.

114
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,270
And a left on the challenger, bringin' the thunder.

115
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,570
And a knee to the body by Cal...

116
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
right hand, and then a knee to the body by...

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,430
Maybe not.

118
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,380
WYBS 106.4 for the Florida Keys...

119
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,380
parts of Havana, Cuba, and the vessels at sea...

120
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,050
and 102.8 in Key West.

121
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,160
Did you see Fred on your way in?

122
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,670
What's that?

123
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,460
Fred, the tree on the bridge?

124
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,750
Not the main bridge, but the old one beside it.

125
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
The historic Seven Mile Bridge?

126
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,550
He grows right in the middle of the road.

127
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,550
Did you see him?

128
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,930
I can't say that I did.

129
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,230
You know, that whole bridge is closed. You can't get to it...

130
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,310
but big old tree just kinda pops outta nowhere.

131
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,360
Well, that's Fred the tree.

132
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,320
And...

133
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,820
got a book on him, if you're interested.

134
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,910
It's full of local color and all. It's great for tourists.

135
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,530
I'm Charlie, by the way.

136
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,120
Hey, Charlie.

137
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,880
You run this bookstore all on your own?

138
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,090
No.

139
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,380
I am one of the owners, though.

140
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,220
What brings you to Glass Key?

141
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,850
I'm here to work at a bar.

142
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,680
- Bartending? - No.

143
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,310
What other job is there at a bar?

144
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,100
Well, the owner's havin' a little trouble, I guess, and I'm...

145
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,860
just here to clean it up.

146
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,980
That kinda sounds like the plot to a western.

147
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,240
Like...

148
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,450
"Local townsfolk send for a hero to help clean up the rowdy saloon."

149
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
You know that crap?

150
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,160
Charlie, leave this poor man alone.

151
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,370
Yeah, I'm sorry. She gets excited about sellin' books and trees...

152
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,290
and Fred and all that... Hi, I'm Stephen.

153
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
- Dalton. - Mmm-hmm.

154
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,500
Oh, he's here to work at the Road House.

155
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,760
- Uh... Really? - See, the owner, uh, Frankie...

156
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,470
she told me it was a roadhouse, but she never told me the name.

157
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,310
It's just the Road House.

158
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,140
Oh, so no name?

159
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,520
Ah, well, no, well, yeah.

160
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,060
Kinda. It's the Road House.

161
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,690
It's just up the highway, past mile marker 77.

162
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,200
Well, thank you for the book but...

163
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,160
- I'm on a budget. - No, no.

164
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,330
Keep it, please.

165
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,450
It's on us.

166
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Thank you.

167
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,960
Welcome to Glass Key.

168
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Thanks, Stephen.

169
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,520
But just like five more minutes till they get here.

170
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,190
I can't wait!

171
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,350
- You guys wanna go now? - Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

172
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,360
No! Every single time. Every...

173
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,320
- He's bothering you? - Yeah, he wants free drinks again.

174
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,610
You're not gettin' free shit, Reed.

175
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,410
You gotta fuckin' pay like everybody else, man.

176
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,280
If you... Okay. This is the last one, I swear.

177
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,410
- That's it. - I appreciate you.

178
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,410
- Last one, though. - Last one.

179
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
You're not gettin' any more for free, I swear to God.

180
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,500
- Swear to God, this bum. - 17.

181
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,040
- Okay. - Hiya.

182
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,630
I'll get a black coffee.

183
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,300
Oh, uh... Yeah, we don't have that. Sorry.

184
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,640
What're you drinkin'?

185
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,390
It's, uh, Cuban coffee.

186
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,390
Okay.

187
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,890
It's... very different.

188
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,190
- Yeah. - Can I have one of those?

189
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,730
Sure. Okay.

190
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,490
Hey.

191
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Hey.

192
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,910
I know who you are.

193
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,960
Elwood Dalton.

194
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,670
Big fan, man.

195
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,000
What you doin'? Just keep it cool, man.

196
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,130
When am I not cool?

197
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,930
Hey, I'm a big fan. You didn't know who he is.

198
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,300
Here you go.

199
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,470
Thank you, ma'am.

200
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,020
Yikes.

201
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,810
Yeah.

202
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,230
- I really like that. - Good.

203
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,900
Yeah.

204
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,660
Nice place you got here.

205
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,450
Peaceful.

206
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,460
Fuck you, motherfucker!

207
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,050
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

208
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Hey!

209
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
Hey!

210
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,990
Get out, man. Go. Get the fuck out.

211
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Get the fuck...

212
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,660
- Hey! - Fuck you!

213
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,620
You're fuckin' out, man. Get the fuck out.

214
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,210
Wow, it's like a morgue in here.

215
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,220
Hey.

216
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,310
Cleanup! Aisle four.

217
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,810
Get the fuck outta here, bro.

218
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,860
Hey, asshole. You've been playing long enough.

219
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,440
Give me a turn. Give me a turn.

220
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,610
Oh, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

221
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,030
- Just let go. - Hey, get me a drink.

222
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,070
- Let go! - I'm not holding you.

223
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,280
Hey, hey, hey, come on! Chill out.

224
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,620
Chill out! Chill out!

225
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,080
Oh, Billy.

226
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,580
You're that stupid?

227
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,960
- Stop. - You didn't learn, did you?

228
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,080
We'll whoop your ass.

229
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,460
You didn't learn? You want another black eye?

230
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,960
- I'll give you another one right here. - No, I don't want another one.

231
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,590
- It's Billy, right? - Yeah.

232
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,050
There's some thirsty customers waitin' for you.

233
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,260
- I can handle these gents. - Okay.

234
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,510
Who the fuck are you, Mr. Smiley?

235
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,350
- Mr. Smiley? - Yeah.

236
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,730
You've had this idiot grin since I walked in.

237
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,020
So, are you happy?

238
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Are you stupid?

239
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,650
Or get punched in the face too many times?

240
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,320
Honestly, it's probably the punching thing.

241
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,070
Can I talk to you guys outside for a second?

242
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,530
Nah. I got some work to do.

243
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,330
Another one.

244
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,420
Those are your bikes out there, right?

245
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,330
Yeah. Mine's the red one on the right.

246
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,640
- Wait, what the fuck? - Wait up.

247
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,430
Hey, asshole!

248
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,720
Stop right there.

249
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,150
I just wanted to get you outside

250
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,400
so I could ask you and your friends respectfully...

251
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,150
to leave the premises.

252
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Oh, we'll leave.

253
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,110
After I fucking kill you.

254
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,570
Sure.

255
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,620
Uh, before we start...

256
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,240
do you have insurance?

257
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,290
What?

258
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,750
Like, you have medical insurance?

259
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,710
Your coverage good? Like, you have dental?

260
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,830
Oh, ha-ha! Yeah. I'm not the one that's gonna fuckin' need it.

261
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,130
Okay.

262
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,540
Sure.

263
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,050
- Hey, Frankie? - Yeah?

264
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,300
Is there a hospital nearby?

265
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,300
Literally, who gives a shit?

266
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,050
Shut the fuck up and fight, asshole!

267
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,380
Is there a hospital nearby?

268
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,090
- Is it like, too far? Is it close? - What?

269
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,810
About, like, 25 minutes, I'd say.

270
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,560
Like, depending on the traffic, what time of day and stuff.

271
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,810
Moe?

272
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,020
- Shut the fuck up! - Right.

273
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,350
Hey, what's your name?

274
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,850
- Dell. - Dell?

275
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,320
You don't have to do this, man. I... You don't...

276
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,280
You don't have to lose, you're gonna lose in front of all your friends.

277
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,610
"In front of"?

278
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,410
Oh, they're not here to just watch.

279
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,780
Oh, well, that's hardly fair.

280
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,910
Life's not fair.

281
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,910
- I just slapped you. Are you all right? - Shit. What?

282
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,830
- What? - What the fuck?

283
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,920
Damn! Damn!

284
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,590
Fuck him up. Come on, do it again!

285
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,010
Fuck him up!

286
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,170
Oh, shit!

287
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Let's call this a draw.

288
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,390
What the fuck's a draw?

289
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,890
It's kinda like a win, man.

290
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,640
- Like, I win? - It's a tie, Dell.

291
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,270
Yeah, like, we win together, you know?

292
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,350
Fuck you!

293
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,360
Fuck, man.

294
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm gonna kill you!

295
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,170
Holy fuck.

296
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,210
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

297
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,920
I think you broke my arm.

298
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,090
I definitely broke your arm.

299
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,430
But the good news is the hospital's only 20 minutes away.

300
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,430
Okay. I said 25. Okay?

301
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,680
God, I don't think I can ride like this. Fuck!

302
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,180
Hey, Frankie?

303
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,100
- Yeah? - You got a car I could borrow?

304
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,850
I do, yeah, but not for them.

305
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,600
Come on. These guys need medical attention.

306
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,150
Oh, yeah? I don't give a shit.

307
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,440
I'm gonna sue you.

308
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,950
Bump.

309
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,410
Shit.

310
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,910
I think he's probably got a concussion...

311
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,920
and then he's got knee damage, possibly a dislocation.

312
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,170
And then the one, that one, I think needs...

313
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,960
Thanks for the ride, man.

314
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,960
Is that one a friend of yours?

315
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,590
Uh, no, I just broke his arm.

316
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
Hey.

317
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,110
Before you go, I really wanted to say thank you for all the new patients.

318
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,950
Um... you're welcome.

319
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,540
I just love when my ER's packed full of irresponsible idiots.

320
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,410
That way, the normal people with real emergencies have nowhere to go.

321
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,460
But that's not something you'd care about...

322
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,880
being a rage-filled dickhead who likes to hurt people for fun.

323
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,500
"Dickhead"?

324
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,670
Well, technically, I hurt people for money.

325
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,470
And how is that better?

326
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,890
I guess it's not. I'm just clarifying.

327
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,980
You know I'm supposed to call the cops on guys like you, right?

328
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,440
Well, you definitely should.

329
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,730
Only, I don't think they really care about rage-filled dickheads around these parts.

330
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,070
You're bleeding.

331
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,610
Oh, shit.

332
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,120
Oh, uh, no, that's just... It's fine.

333
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Let me see it.

334
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,000
All right.

335
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,630
So, you like to fight?

336
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,220
You ever win?

337
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,520
No one ever wins a fight.

338
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,860
Then, why do you do it?

339
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,110
It's not infected, but I'll need to suture this.

340
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,990
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.

341
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,330
Why not?

342
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,490
It's my fault. I wanna pay for it.

343
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,500
Fine.

344
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,340
Can I?

345
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,230
Someone left their car in the emergency area.

346
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,230
Please move it. License plate...

347
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,560
Cephalexin.

348
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,110
Oh, no, I don't need anything for the pain.

349
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,900
It's an antibiotic.

350
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,230
Do the full cycle.

351
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,570
Hey, doc, thank you.

352
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,780
Sorry for all the trouble.

353
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,740
Tell it to my staff. They're the ones with all the extra work tonight.

354
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,880
Hey, what are you whittling?

355
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,590
A stick.

356
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,630
Yeah, but what's it gonna be?

357
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,880
A smaller stick.

358
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,180
Is that him?

359
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,930
You have a good night, ma'am.

360
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,640
Again, I'm sorry for the trouble.

361
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Thanks.

362
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,020
Yeah, that's him.

363
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,150
That's the guy.

364
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,860
He threw in little bits of everything. What? The Krav Maga...

365
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,490
judo, jujitsu, you know, like, the slap.

366
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,450
What's that? Subak? Right?

367
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,450
Hey, slugger.

368
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,750
Here it is. One week's salary.

369
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,580
In cash, as requested.

370
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,500
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

371
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,670
Thank you.

372
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,050
Got a beautiful spot here, Frankie.

373
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,970
You bet your ass it's beautiful.

374
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,300
I mean, look at this.

375
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,760
Imagine having a drink right there with somebody special, you know?

376
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,510
Hell, you could even get married here.

377
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Divorced, too.

378
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,560
Then you can come back and drown your sorrows.

379
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,480
I mean, it's a whole "circle of life" thing.

380
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,940
Oh. That's one hell of a sales pitch.

381
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,070
Yeah.

382
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,190
Look, I know the Glass Key ain't what it once was.

383
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
But...

384
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,160
I think this place could be something really special.

385
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,240
Can I ask you a question?

386
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,410
Sure.

387
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,540
Why is it called the Road House?

388
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,750
What do you mean?

389
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,500
Isn't roadhouse one word?

390
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,340
Yeah, that's the joke.

391
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,920
It's a roadhouse.

392
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,300
But it's called the Road House. Get it?

393
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,390
Still unresolved.

394
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,970
Well, I don't know. My uncle had a unique sense of humor.

395
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,350
Hey, so, there's this cute hotel in town.

396
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,480
I mean, it's the only hotel in town but luckily, it's cute.

397
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,860
Well, you know, I saw that there was a houseboat for sale at the marina...

398
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,860
so I thought maybe I'd go check that out, but...

399
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,410
That old tub?

400
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,870
It barely floats.

401
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,870
You know it?

402
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,990
Yeah, I know it.

403
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,750
It's mine. It came with the bar.

404
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,540
Listen, you are more than welcome to stay there...

405
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,250
but I highly advise you sleep with a snorkel.

406
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,290
- Okay. - Also...

407
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,670
watch out for the crocodile.

408
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,300
- The what? - I shit you not,

409
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,420
it killed Shantsie last year.

410
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,420
Who?

411
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,510
The dock master's Pomeranian.

412
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,590
Oh, um... and heads up...

413
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,850
My uncle named the boat, too.

414
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,370
You're the poor soul Frankie's got bunkin' on this frying pan?

415
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,700
Uh, yeah, I am.

416
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,910
Yeah, well...

417
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,880
you best watch out for that damn croc.

418
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,030
Welcome to the undisputed

419
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,660
UFC middleweight

420
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,330
championship of the world!

421
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,080
Introducing first, the challenger...

422
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:29,090
Elwood Dalton!

423
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,220
Dalton. Dalton!

424
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,760
There's no doorbell.

425
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,510
Probably 'cause it's a boat.

426
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,850
I should put something on.

427
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,100
Don't worry about it.

428
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
I got brothers.

429
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,480
I figured you wouldn't have a chance to get breakfast, so...

430
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,860
I brought some food.

431
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,780
Love what you've done with the place.

432
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,950
Help you unpack?

433
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,830
Uh, no, I just have this suitcase.

434
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,210
Okay.

435
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,380
Let's see, we got tostadas.

436
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,090
Breakfast burrito.

437
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,640
And empanadas.

438
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,100
- Ah. Thank you, ma'am. - Yeah.

439
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,980
Uh, look. So um...

440
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,820
We've been through a lot of you guys.

441
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,650
You know, there's Arthur. And then, Bennett, and...

442
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,610
this guy, Chris, who, like, I thought...

443
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,320
might last a little while...

444
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,950
but he's ex-Marine, just, huge guy.

445
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,660
But, um, total idiot.

446
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,120
Lasted less than two days.

447
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,830
I was gonna leave after that...

448
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,170
but now you're here.

449
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm hoping you're different.

450
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,300
Maybe it'll get better.

451
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,880
Thank you for the food.

452
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,850
Good morning, Dalton.

453
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,770
Morning.

454
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,820
Hey, Dalton.

455
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
How you doin'?

456
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,280
Hiya, Charlie.

457
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,620
Hey.

458
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,830
Um, what can I do for you, partner?

459
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,000
Kinda wondering if maybe you had a computer around these parts I could use.

460
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,460
Mmm-hmm! Over there.

461
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,760
Not gonna lie, I was kinda worried you came here to return Fred the Tree.

462
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,880
Why would I do that?

463
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,550
How else am I supposed to learn about the Keys' famous six-toed cats?

464
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,550
Good point.

465
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,100
And I have some good news.

466
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,100
I found your life story.

467
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,150
I don't know if that's good news.

468
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,150
Death at the Double X by Martin Holly.

469
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,990
Paperback western from the 1950s.

470
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,110
- Oh, right. A western. - Mmm-hmm.

471
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,370
"The intrepid Wade Waco never met a scoundrel...

472
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,330
"he couldn't bring to justice.

473
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,370
"But then again..."

474
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,790
"Wade had never stepped foot in the Double X..."

475
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,210
"A saloon, red-hot with rustlin',"

476
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,210
"cheatin', robbin', and murder."

477
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,050
You're intrepid, right?

478
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,590
Honestly, I couldn't tell ya.

479
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,590
It's four zeros.

480
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Okay.

481
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,140
Yeah. That work?

482
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,390
Yeah.

483
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,060
- Bring those back! - Shut the fuck up!

484
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,070
God damn it! I'm sick of this!

485
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,400
Shut your ass up.

486
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,360
- Bring those back or pay for them! - Get back in there!

487
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,280
Whatcha gonna do, huh?

488
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,160
Go back in there!

489
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,700
Big talk. What a fuckin' loser.

490
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Hey!

491
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,910
Get out of here, all of you!

492
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,790
Why don't you go find your daddy?

493
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Now!

494
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah, okay.

495
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,250
Go on.

496
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,960
Go!

497
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Oh, shit.

498
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,680
All right. Let's see it.

499
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,060
Fuck you.

500
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,240
What're you doing with that bat?

501
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,450
I hate those a-holes.

502
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,580
Where's your dad?

503
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,170
He's just at his other job.

504
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,380
It's kinda hard to make a living on selling books.

505
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,090
Yeah.

506
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,680
The bookstore was actually my mom's idea.

507
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,390
And where's she?

508
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,600
She died last year.

509
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,520
I'm sorry to hear that.

510
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,940
Shit happens.

511
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,520
Only here, it always happens on a beautiful day.

512
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,870
Hey, you working tomorrow?

513
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,620
- Yeah, no, it sounds good. - Make it work?

514
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,790
Yeah, no, I got you.

515
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,840
Hey, can you cover me next Thursday?

516
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,090
Thursday, that's...

517
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,510
Hey, there he is.

518
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,510
How was your first night at sea?

519
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,840
I think I liked it.

520
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,430
Yeah, but I did have some strange dreams.

521
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,970
Boat dreams.

522
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,640
It's the rockin' of the ocean.

523
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,020
It'll mess all your sleep patterns and shit up, I swear to God.

524
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,190
- It's fun, right? - Yeah.

525
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,400
See you, Frankie.

526
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,690
Hey, Dalton.

527
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Smell you later, Carl.

528
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,110
- Uh, Frankie? - Yeah?

529
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,330
Was there, like, a town meeting or something?

530
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,660
- How does everybody know my name? - Yeah, uh...

531
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,790
that's just how it is around here, man. I mean, it's a gossipy sort of island.

532
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,020
Mr. B. Sorry, we're late.

533
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,940
Yeah, not at all. Glad you're here.

534
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,280
Because if you're here, that means you're not somewhere else fucking shit up.

535
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,740
You, let's finish this. I got half a fucking shave.

536
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,200
Mr. B, maybe you should hold off on that shave till we get to shore.

537
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,740
- It's pretty rough. - Relax.

538
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,660
Captain assured me it's gonna be smooth sailing, right?

539
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,170
- Smooth sailing? - Yes, boss!

540
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,500
Smooth sailing.

541
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,420
Also, what the fuck do you care?

542
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,090
Right.

543
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,170
Anyway, I don't know what you heard.

544
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,800
What I heard is that you're all a bunch of fucking pussies.

545
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,800
That's what I heard.

546
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,850
Scared of some bouncer asshole. That's what I heard.

547
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,310
Actually, sir, it was Dell.

548
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,680
He wasn't sure how to handle it.

549
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,190
Okay, let me talk to this genius, Dell, then.

550
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,560
You can't.

551
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,770
And why is that?

552
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,240
He's still in the hospital.

553
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,240
He's got a concussion.

554
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,860
Son of a bitch!

555
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,070
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,160
It's fine. It's fine. Okay. Okay.

557
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,490
Let's keep the wrist nice and loose, okay?

558
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,200
- Sounds good? Perfect. - Okay.

559
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,410
You can go ahead.

560
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,630
Can someone just tell me or remind me

561
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,920
whose idea was it to hire these dumb fucks in the first place?

562
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,010
- Yours, boss. - Here's the fucking thing!

563
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,930
You're all supposed to have this job done by now.

564
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,850
I still think we could scare 'em off.

565
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,180
Are you, I... What did I say?

566
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,770
I said keep it loose, okay? Hands loose.

567
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,520
I get it. It's a little bouncy, but keep it nice and loose.

568
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,440
That's all you have to do, okay? Easy.

569
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,610
Okay?

570
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,990
You, tell me about this bouncer.

571
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,790
Oh, uh...

572
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,080
Yeah, uh, I don't know, man. He's um...

573
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,710
He's kinda strange, you know?

574
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,920
What do you mean, strange?

575
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,500
Yeah. I mean, you know, he's...

576
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,210
He acts all nice and shit, like he's Mister Rogers or something.

577
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,380
But then, man, he hauls off, he hauls off.

578
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,260
He beats the living shit outta you.

579
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,930
So, really interesting guy overall.

580
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,810
That was a brilliant analysis.

581
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,600
Sam, throw these dum-dums overboard.

582
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:23,270
Well, maybe if you just told us why you want to tear down the Road House?

583
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,940
Great idea!

584
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,980
Let me bring you in on all my business dealings.

585
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,530
Get the fuck outta here.

586
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,860
Go to the house. Enjoy your fucking selves.

587
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,160
I'll be in touch.

588
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,620
Well, maybe it's time we get your old man involved.

589
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,880
Captain! Let me talk to you for a second.

590
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,390
Hey, everybody. I know we're at a bar right now,

591
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,220
but do y'all mind if I take y'all to church?

592
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,610
Yo, what the fuck kinda music is this?

593
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,440
Yo, play some fucking Stones or something.

594
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,990
Get off the fucking stage!

595
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,530
Yo! This ain't fuckin' high school garage band!

596
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,120
Get off the fuckin' stage!

597
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,660
The fuck is wrong with you, bro?

598
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,620
Sit the fuck down, you drunk motherfucker.

599
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,540
The fuck you're gonna do about it? Mind your fuckin' business!

600
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,040
This fuckin' music sucks!

601
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,460
That guy's got a knife under his shirt. The one in red.

602
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,710
I ain't fuckin' scared of you, motherfucker.

603
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,090
- Sit the fuck down. - Sit your ass down.

604
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
Do you wanna handle it?

605
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,430
No, just sit your ass down.

606
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,590
Me?

607
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,600
I ain't fuckin' scared of you.

608
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,890
- Back the fuck up. - Get the fuck out.

609
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,140
Back the fuck up outta of my face, bitch!

610
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,190
When he takes it out,

611
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,560
you just take a big step back and pop him in the face.

612
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,360
You can do it.

613
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,900
Okay. Okay.

614
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,200
Hey! All right, hey!

615
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,540
- You're fucking out, man. - Get the fuck off!

616
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,250
You're fuckin' out, man.

617
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,170
Stay the fuck outta this!

618
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,540
What now, bitch? What's up?

619
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,220
Motherfucker!

620
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,640
Ahh! Fuck!

621
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,520
Billy, chair.

622
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,820
You brought a concealed knife in here and that is a no-no.

623
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,530
- Billy. - Ow! Fuck, man! My arm!

624
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,940
You got him.

625
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,700
Chill. Chill, dude, chill.

626
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,030
You fucking chill. Don't fucking ever do that again.

627
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,450
Get off of me.

628
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,460
Get the fuck outta here, man.

629
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,250
Get the fuck outta here.

630
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,000
- Jesus, what the fuck, man? - Get out.

631
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,420
- I will fuck you up! - Oh, fuck!

632
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,090
You know, I think I'm getting pretty good at this.

633
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,920
You're a natural. Don't forget to lift with your knees.

634
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,300
Lift with my knees.

635
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,090
Pool table. Guy in green.

636
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,690
Hey, back up. Back the fuck up.

637
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,190
It's a good thing he can do that.

638
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,820
'Cause, you know, he's a pretty crap bartender.

639
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,230
It's cool.

640
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,070
Everyone relax.

641
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,400
Don't fucking do that.

642
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,720
- Hey, you're Reef, right? - Yeah.

643
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,180
You were quick to back Billy up the other day.

644
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,140
Yeah, I mean, I don't like bullies, so...

645
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,940
Those scars on your knuckles there?

646
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,770
Old habit. Used to box some in college.

647
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Still hit the bag?

648
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,360
Every now and then. Why?

649
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,430
Yo, ladies, get off the table.

650
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,610
Hey, man!

651
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,990
What are you doing?

652
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,540
Get up!

653
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,340
Back the fuck up, man! Hey!

654
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,760
Back away!

655
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Julius!

656
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,950
Hey, you was right. That was mad therapeutic.

657
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,570
Yeah, but remember, lift with your knees.

658
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,240
- Always lift with your knees. - Sure.

659
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Hello?

660
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,080
Hey! One for the road.

661
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,080
Yeah, I think even the road is drunk at this point.

662
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,500
- What? - I'll call you a cab.

663
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,300
- No, no. Boo! - Yeah.

664
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,630
Boo!

665
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,010
Hey! No.

666
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,930
- Fuck, no! - Just one. One!

667
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,100
What?

668
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,220
Hey, there, again.

669
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,810
"Again"?

670
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,400
Uh... Nope.

671
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,440
We've, um, never met.

672
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,410
All right. Watch your step.

673
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,160
Pick these up in the morning, Jim.

674
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,340
Later, Dalton.

675
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,470
We'll be back.

676
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,650
First fighter to the scale.

677
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,940
The challenger, Elwood Dalton!

678
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,910
Man, this guy makes me laugh, 'cause he's a fucking joke!

679
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,250
- You fuck! - Just a little slap.

680
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,790
You're fucking dead.

681
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,790
- You're fucking dead. - Wow.

682
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,860
Fucking boat dreams.

683
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,970
Thank you.

684
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,680
You're here.

685
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,310
I am. Best conch chowder in the Keys, so I've read.

686
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,440
Conch.

687
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,440
Sorry, what?

688
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,730
It's conch, not con-ch.

689
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,780
Nice haircut, Ellie. Really suits you.

690
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,780
Oh, fuck you, Frank.

691
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,740
I should've let that burst appendix kill you.

692
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,910
My hairdresser.

693
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,870
I cut my own hair now.

694
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,870
People seem a little aggressive around here.

695
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,290
Look, I should warn you.

696
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,710
I grew up in Glass Key

697
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,840
and people have a certain way of getting things done around here.

698
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,510
Loyalties, family ties run deep.

699
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,180
Even the cops aren't always as helpful as they should be.

700
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,680
If you cause trouble to the wrong people, you could get hurt or worse.

701
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,940
None of this is covered in my Fred the Tree book.

702
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,610
You sure?

703
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,150
You read the whole thing?

704
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,240
You know that conchs produce pearls?

705
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,370
Yes.

706
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,910
And that they have ornate spiral...

707
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,660
Shells. Yes, everyone knows that.

708
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:04,250
That one in every 15,000 produces a pink pearl.

709
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,000
Sounds romantic.

710
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,960
Unless you're a conch.

711
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,960
Because what actually happens

712
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,510
is the conch gets a bit of grit inside its shell,

713
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,930
which causes extreme irritation.

714
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,470
"Extreme irritation"...

715
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,310
that leads to something beautiful.

716
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,850
How is that not romantic?

717
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,280
Enjoy your conch chowder.

718
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,990
I like your hair. Did a nice job.

719
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,490
Fuck Frank.

720
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,170
That's my uncle.

721
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,380
Just kidding. That's my uncle.

722
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,630
Funny one, huh?

723
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,390
Yeah. I mean, I didn't get the dude.

724
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,140
I don't know. But now that I'm older,

725
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,100
I think I'm startin' to appreciate him more.

726
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,560
I mean, he was a tough bastard.

727
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
You know?

728
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,690
He had to be to do what he did.

729
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,230
Build this place...

730
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,320
in the '60s in the South?

731
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,120
That dude didn't fuck around.

732
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,540
I wanna be worthy of that.

733
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,710
Hey, want a ride?

734
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,920
No. You have a good night, Laura.

735
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,300
- I'm gonna walk. - Okay.

736
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,630
Damn it, Dell!

737
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,380
- Shut up. Just shut up! - My fucking truck!

738
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,210
Come on, get the fuck off this truck!

739
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,590
It sucks! I can't drive this shit. Move!

740
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,630
No, no!

741
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,430
Forget about the truck. We got him!

742
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,190
You're really an asshole.

743
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,490
Yeah, I haven't heard that one before.

744
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

745
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,130
You're a real pain in my ass.

746
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,300
Okay.

747
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,220
I was hoping tonight would look more like an accident.

748
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,640
Drunk driver. Less questions that way.

749
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,640
But...

750
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,100
I'mma just shoot you.

751
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,690
Can I ask you a question?

752
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,360
Why all the fuss?

753
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,980
I mean, I'm just some guy.

754
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,320
Oh, hell, it ain't you. It's the Road House!

755
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,120
Come on, man!

756
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,390
Fuck! Help.

757
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,970
Fuck!

758
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,770
So, you're gonna kill me now?

759
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,020
Why would I kill you?

760
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,780
Well, that was stupid. I'm just gonna go right back up.

761
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Oh, shit!

762
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,740
Help me! Fuck!

763
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:48,830
Hang on! Hang on.

764
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:52,540
Hang on, I got you! I got you. I got you!

765
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,620
- Fuck you! - Hold on. Hold on.

766
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,270
Won't find the body.

767
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,480
Crocs hide their food.

768
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:15,980
I didn't know that.

769
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,980
That's why no one believed me about Shantsie.

770
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,530
My dog.

771
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,950
Damn croc got him, too.

772
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,620
Hey. What'd that asshole want with you anyways?

773
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,670
Must've got in the way of his business.

774
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,800
Oh, yeah? What's his business?

775
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,880
Hell, I don't know.

776
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,220
Drugs, probably.

777
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,970
I mean, that's all we got around here.

778
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,930
Why do you think they call it the Keys?

779
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,690
Deliveries by boat to the back of the Road House. And...

780
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,020
- No, it's... You're... No. - Can you... zoom?

781
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,570
No, you...

782
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,530
- I don't know how these things work. - No. You wanna zoom in?

783
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,360
Okay, there. Zoomed.

784
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,820
But Glass Key's here.

785
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,370
Okay, just wait.

786
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,410
That's... Right there is the back deck, right? Of the Road House?

787
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,370
So, if you wanted to get deliveries by boat...

788
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,920
Then you'd be plumb out of luck.

789
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,040
Why?

790
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,590
Because of the reefs.

791
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,420
You see, this area by the Road House, it's just not deep enough.

792
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,800
Boats would run aground.

793
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,720
All right. So, you can't get deliveries and...

794
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,100
it's close to the highway, so there's no privacy.

795
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,520
This is kind of sounding more like a mystery-western...

796
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,480
instead of a straight-up shooting-western. Know what I mean?

797
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,230
Yeah, it kinda is.

798
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,830
Hey!

799
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,750
Is that a good bookstore?

800
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,420
Yeah, I like it.

801
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,500
Yeah. Sure looked like you and that girl were having a grand time in there.

802
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,590
Hey.

803
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,590
Hey!

804
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,010
Get in the car. Boss wants to have a word with you.

805
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,180
Who's your boss?

806
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,470
Brandt.

807
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,310
Brandt?

808
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,520
Yeah, Ben Brandt.

809
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,980
And he's waiting. So, you're gonna get in the car or not?

810
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,820
- I don't think so. - Hey, stop. Stop!

811
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,900
You did see that I have a fucking gun, right?

812
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,360
Yeah. You made a pretty big point of showin' it to me.

813
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,490
Okay, so get in the fucking car!

814
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,540
You don't understand how this works, do you?

815
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,120
Yeah, I do.

816
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,000
But you have a gun, tucked in your waistband.

817
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,960
So, it's really not that intimidating, is it?

818
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,290
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

819
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,170
I mean, all I have to do is break your index and your middle finger

820
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,010
and you wouldn't be able to hold that gun.

821
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,970
Technically, you'd be able to hold it but you wouldn't be able to fire it.

822
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,930
So it's really not that big of a threat, is it?

823
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,100
Fuck this.

824
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,560
Motherfucker!

825
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,730
Fuck you!

826
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,810
You cocksucker, motherfucker!

827
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,650
You broke my fucking finger!

828
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,820
You see what I mean? It's really painful.

829
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,530
You're not like a piano player or anything, are you?

830
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,700
Fuck you.

831
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,530
You don't have a gun, too, do you?

832
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,990
I think I left it in the car.

833
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,750
Tell your boss, if he wants to talk to me,

834
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,000
I work at the Road House, and I'm there every night.

835
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,000
- Damn it! - Okay.

836
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,960
And your friend is gonna need a doctor now.

837
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,840
But the good news is, there is a hospital. It's only 25 minutes away.

838
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,260
- Hi, guys. - Hey, Frankie.

839
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,900
Holy shit. You scared the shit out of me.

840
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,690
That was kind of my intention.

841
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,480
I heard about Dell.

842
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:52,530
Are you okay?

843
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,200
I... Yeah, I'm fine.

844
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,490
Listen, Dell was a piece of shit.

845
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,740
Okay? He and his friends terrorized us for months.

846
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,120
And I know we shouldn't be happy that he's dead

847
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,960
and the fact that I am happy is a huge problem.

848
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,670
And it's something I'm gonna work on.

849
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
But...

850
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,170
I don't know.

851
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,140
I just don't get why he was so focused on the Road House.

852
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,430
What do you mean?

853
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:24,060
I mean, you just said he terrorized this place for months.

854
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,650
Shit, man. I don't know.

855
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,020
I mean, some of these guys, they get real territorial.

856
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,990
Who knows why these assholes do what they do?

857
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,990
But if I were you, I wouldn't read too much into it.

858
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,660
So, you think it's nothing?

859
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,580
Put it this way. I hope you didn't lose any sleep over it.

860
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,790
Well, I did.

861
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,170
Uh, a little.

862
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,810
What happened to your fingers?

863
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,890
He broke them. The bouncer.

864
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,140
He broke your fingers?

865
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,730
Yeah, when he took my gun.

866
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,110
Okay.

867
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,940
That's great. Great work.

868
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,860
At least you didn't get eaten by a crocodile.

869
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,030
You find that funny?

870
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,160
You find this fucking amusing? I'm not amused.

871
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,080
Put that fucking down! It's expensive.

872
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,330
This fuckin' bouncer...

873
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,790
is standing in the way of my fuckin' dreams.

874
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,670
He's fucking killin' me.

875
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,130
And you're here laughing

876
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,630
as everything I've been trying to build is going down the drain.

877
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,520
Hello. This is a prepaid call from...

878
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,730
Say yes, shithead.

879
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,690
An inmate at Florida Correctional Institution.

880
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,020
This call is subject to recording and monitoring.

881
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,650
To accept charges, say yes.

882
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,000
Go get my phone.

883
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:27,560
- My love! - Goodbye!

884
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,450
Hello. This is a prepaid call from

885
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,030
an inmate at Florida Correctional...

886
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,040
- Yes. Knox? It's Gerald Brandt.

887
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,620
Where are you?

888
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,670
Clothes shopping.

889
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,670
What the fuck do you care?

890
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,960
I got a serious fucking problem in Florida.

891
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,460
Hang on.

892
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,020
Knox! Hello? Knox!

893
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,480
- So, what do you need? Knox...

894
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,440
- my idiot son is fucking things up. - Yes?

895
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:21,690
- Yeah. I need your help.

896
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,990
I'll leave right away.

897
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,040
Ahoy.

898
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,290
Nice boat.

899
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,750
Ex-boyfriend's.

900
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,040
But I know where he hides the spare key.

901
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,920
I'm kidding. He lets me use it.

902
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,510
He's a cop.

903
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,840
Feeling brave?

904
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,230
Where are we going?

905
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,960
We're here.

906
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,670
In the middle of the ocean?

907
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,640
Uh, you need any, uh...

908
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:32,890
Come on.

909
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:35,520
Wait, why are...

910
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,600
Come on, grab the cooler.

911
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,320
All right.

912
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,910
They're not gonna find that guy's body.

913
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,280
Crocs hide their food.

914
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,750
Do they teach that in kindergarten around here?

915
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,500
They do.

916
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,050
This is why I warned you.

917
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,640
You obviously stepped on someone's toes.

918
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,560
Some guy named Brandt.

919
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,310
Who told you that?

920
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:23,770
Why?

921
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,690
Do you know him?

922
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,280
He comes from one of those old Florida families.

923
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,030
They built most of Glass Key.

924
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,370
So, where are you from?

925
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,750
Me?

926
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,210
Montana.

927
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,260
Where in Montana?

928
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,180
Missoula.

929
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,770
Is it a nice place?

930
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,480
Look, I think maybe we should head back.

931
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,690
We just got here.

932
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,570
Let's head back.

933
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,700
I was just asking simple questions.

934
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:14,280
I just didn't think this through. I didn't realize this was a date.

935
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,040
What's wrong with you?

936
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,040
You're a nice person.

937
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,500
You don't wanna know me.

938
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,470
Don't tell me what I want.

939
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,020
You think we don't have the Internet out here?

940
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,270
I know what happened.

941
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,780
And you know this is a date.

942
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,990
Who put those fuckin' bikes in me way?

943
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,370
Who the fuck are you?

944
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,540
Thank you, God.

945
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,000
Sandwiches.

946
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,420
I'm fucking famished.

947
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,970
Jesus. He knocked all the fuckin' bikes over.

948
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,760
Now you got a big-ass problem, bucko.

949
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:57,850
No shit.

950
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,470
First off...

951
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,310
I'm gonna need more than three sandwiches.

952
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,640
I wasn't done talkin'.

953
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,100
Actually, that's where you're wrong, lad.

954
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,360
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

955
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
Pull up.

956
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,150
Are you fucking kidding me?

957
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,160
What the fuck are you doing?

958
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:24,290
Hey, Mr. Brandt. Just putting up a hammock.

959
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,960
It's my father's house. It's not a goddamn Airbnb.

960
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,420
Right, but you told us to enjoy ourselves.

961
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,590
- No, I didn't. - You did. On the boat.

962
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,710
And if I fucking did, I didn't mean it.

963
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,130
Okay.

964
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,670
Where are your idiot friends?

965
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,470
They went to make some food.

966
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,760
In case you're hungry.

967
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,260
Clean this shit up! Who are these people?

968
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,350
Get out of here!

969
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:52,980
I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?

970
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,280
Hey.

971
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,150
I got a message for you.

972
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,070
From your father.

973
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,530
A message? My father? And what...

974
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,160
What is this "message"?

975
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,870
You're Ben, right? Jerry's son?

976
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,800
This is where I'll store my stuff.

977
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,090
And that master bedroom up there is mine.

978
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,880
What are you talking about?

979
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,720
Who are you?

980
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,180
Your da says you've been fucking things up.

981
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,980
He asked me to lend a hand.

982
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,400
How would my father know?

983
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,440
He's in a prison, rotting in a cell.

984
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:35,530
Don't be silly. Your father has spies everywhere.

985
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,070
Well, you can tell my father...

986
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,820
I don't need your fuckin' help.

987
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,200
- I have it all under control. - No, you don't.

988
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,160
Yes, I have people out there right now...

989
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,160
cleaning up this final issue, and that's all...

990
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,540
Whatever you say.

991
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,670
- So, where's this bouncer asshole? - Okay.

992
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:54,960
Can we just take a minute?

993
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:59,130
You can't go and shoot this guy in the middle of town fucking square.

994
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,720
You understand that, right?

995
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,640
This is a delicate situation.

996
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,060
So, if we're gonna kill this guy...

997
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:11,690
If? He's already dead.

998
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,980
Once Knox is on the job, it's over, baby.

999
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,610
It's just a matter of when.

1000
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,780
Yeah, you're right. I'm sure.

1001
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,320
I'm sure you're amazing. Amazing.

1002
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:26,450
Um, I'm gonna try to do this the easy way one more time.

1003
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,330
- Is that okay? Yeah. Thank you. - You do your thing. You do your thing.

1004
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
- After that, you can set it all on fire. - My man. My man.

1005
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,210
- Wonderful. Yeah. - God bless, God bless.

1006
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,090
Who the fuck is...

1007
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,890
I'll be seeing you soon.

1008
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,930
I know where you live.

1009
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,850
Mr. Dalton.

1010
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,110
Yeah?

1011
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,030
We have a few questions about the other night.

1012
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:02,280
Need you to come with us.

1013
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,910
Sure. Why not?

1014
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,690
Is that him?

1015
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,150
Elwood P. Dalton.

1016
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,290
Elwood?

1017
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,380
Most people call me Dalton, sir.

1018
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,760
Most people call me Big Dick.

1019
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,800
I'm not gonna do that.

1020
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:14,310
Your name reminds me of that Johnny Cash song.

1021
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,480
Yeah? Which one?

1022
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,060
"A Boy Named Sue."

1023
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,570
Dad gave his son a girl's name...

1024
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,690
so he'd grow up tough.

1025
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,240
Are you tough, son?

1026
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,740
Your deputy says you had some questions for me.

1027
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:32,120
Listen up, Elwood...

1028
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,370
I'm the sheriff of all of Monroe County.

1029
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,580
But Glass Key is special. Do you know why?

1030
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,130
I'm stumped, sir.

1031
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,720
My children were raised here.

1032
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,010
All the people that live here now are like family, you understand?

1033
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:52,810
Yeah. So, you like Glass Key?

1034
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:57,310
I'd like you to leave here, my friend.

1035
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,440
You don't want to be my friend.

1036
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,610
Well, in that case...

1037
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,400
there are a few ways this can go.

1038
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,820
I can arrest you.

1039
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,120
For what?

1040
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,790
Doesn't matter. We'll lose the paperwork. We'll find you someday.

1041
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:18,250
Likely, the very same day you get shanked in the yard.

1042
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,000
That way, it will be ironic.

1043
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:23,710
It will make a good song.

1044
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,470
Elwood doesn't really rhyme with much, but...

1045
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,260
I mean, if it's a catchy tune.

1046
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:35,350
Get him out of the car!

1047
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,810
Get out of the fucking car!

1048
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,860
- All right. All right. All right. - Get out!

1049
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:00,790
You have a death wish, son?

1050
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,890
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1051
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,140
Come on, Dalton.

1052
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,150
He's my father.

1053
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,530
My mom died and I moved away from the Keys...

1054
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,070
changed my name, took her maiden name.

1055
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,280
I don't know why I ever came back.

1056
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,910
The man you talked about, Ben Brandt...

1057
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,620
His father is Gerald Brandt.

1058
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,380
My dad used to work for him.

1059
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,670
He put a lot of money into Glass Key.

1060
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,590
Owned a fleet of charter boats that ran tours.

1061
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,260
And drugs.

1062
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,100
Until he was gone.

1063
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,310
He's in prison now.

1064
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,690
And I guess, now my father works for his fucking son.

1065
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,120
You have to leave Glass Key.

1066
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,500
It's kinda sad, you know.

1067
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,960
I bet this was a nice town once.

1068
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,290
Nice towns are overrated.

1069
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,170
And how much damage are we supposed to do here?

1070
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:33,180
Enough to make sure he gets the message.

1071
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,570
Charlie, out the back. Quick!

1072
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,780
Out the back!

1073
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,830
- Hey, what's going on? - Hey.

1074
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,210
Ellie called twice.

1075
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,250
Said I needed to text her if you showed up.

1076
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,880
Also, you're late, which...

1077
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:52,420
is a first.

1078
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:53,800
Had a little mix-up...

1079
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,220
with the sheriff.

1080
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,550
A mix-up?

1081
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,890
What are we talkin' about?

1082
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:00,890
Yeah, what are we talking about?

1083
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:03,930
I'm curious, actually, to hear what you were gonna tell her.

1084
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,930
Hey, Laura.

1085
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,230
Can I have a vodka neat, please?

1086
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,400
Yeah.

1087
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,940
I'm Ben Brandt.

1088
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,410
You...

1089
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,620
you must be Dalton.

1090
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,080
- Let me guess. It's your turn now. - My turn?

1091
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,710
You know, to threaten me. Tell me to get out of town.

1092
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,920
Like your buddy, Big Dick.

1093
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,630
No. No, I get the impression that you can't be threatened.

1094
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,430
I wish you could be, but...

1095
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,800
I'd even bribe you, if I thought money would work.

1096
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,390
Really? How much we talking?

1097
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,270
You're funny. You're funny.

1098
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,940
See, I can't help but wonder what an outsider like you...

1099
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:58,320
thinks you're doing here.

1100
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,240
I don't know, Ben.

1101
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:02,990
What are any of us doing here anyway?

1102
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,160
Well, I belong here, you know.

1103
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,540
I helped build this town. My father helped it grow.

1104
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:10,670
You know, created schools...

1105
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,790
repaired parks, paved streets...

1106
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,300
That was before he went to prison, I'm assuming.

1107
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,890
It is a complicated story.

1108
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:24,050
But I'm not here to talk about my family's history.

1109
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,180
I actually have a question.

1110
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:31,390
They keep taking this off YouTube, but I tracked it down.

1111
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,190
You know, anyhow, it is the fucking Internet.

1112
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:37,440
And I keep watching it over and over again.

1113
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,030
And there's just one thing I don't get.

1114
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,740
Here you are, fighting this guy.

1115
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,280
He's your friend, right?

1116
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,200
That's what I heard, that he was your friend.

1117
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,000
And then this happens, right here.

1118
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,500
Yeah, he's done.

1119
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,000
Everybody can see. Thank you.

1120
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,750
Right here.

1121
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,880
Bam!

1122
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,840
See that last hit? That's the one...

1123
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:04,050
In my opinion, that's the one...

1124
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,800
that did it.

1125
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,310
That was definitely the one that did it.

1126
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,610
It was.

1127
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,320
So, I guess my question is...

1128
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:23,860
Why?

1129
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:28,910
Right? It can't be just some competitive thing, you...

1130
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,410
you've won the fight.

1131
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,420
You can back off now.

1132
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,880
But you... you don't.

1133
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,220
You just keep...

1134
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:47,680
punching and punching and punching.

1135
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,850
So, why?

1136
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,690
Why don't you just stop?

1137
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,710
You have a good night.

1138
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,650
Make it hurt as much as possible.

1139
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,360
You can burn the place down.

1140
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,110
Hey, nice suit.

1141
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,740
You look like a shitty pimp on Easter.

1142
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,240
Then again, you always had bad taste.

1143
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:53,160
Thank you. It's Cleopini, Frankie. I went to Italy to get it fucking fitted.

1144
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:55,330
It's a long way to go to still look like dog shit.

1145
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,250
- God. - What are you doin' at my place?

1146
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,420
None of your goddamn business.

1147
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,040
What are you doin' at my place?

1148
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,920
Anything I fucking want.

1149
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,210
- That's the truth. - Oh, really?

1150
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,180
All right, lads. Let's go.

1151
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,760
- Get out of my goddamn window! - Fuck you!

1152
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,720
It's been a while since I've been clubbin'.

1153
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,000
Just what I thought.

1154
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,540
This roadhouse is mine.

1155
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,800
Hey, fellas.

1156
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:51,550
Looks like you're havin' a smashing night!

1157
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,110
Hey, beautiful.

1158
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:08,070
- I'm Knox. - Howdy.

1159
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,610
Let's dance.

1160
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,740
Hey! That's my fucking girl, bro. What are you doin'?

1161
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:14,870
Fuck, man!

1162
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:17,080
I love this song, baby. Don't you?

1163
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,710
I guess.

1164
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,260
I hate this song!

1165
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,900
- Hello, band. - Back up.

1166
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,030
Hey, calm the fuck down!

1167
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,690
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1168
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,950
Man, why don't we just take it outside...

1169
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,410
Fuck!

1170
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:53,490
Hey, hey, don't do it!

1171
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,350
Bar fight!

1172
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,560
Bar fight!

1173
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,860
Oh, my God!

1174
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,370
Motherfucker!

1175
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,930
Dalton!

1176
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,260
Dalton!

1177
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,430
Dalton!

1178
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,600
Dalton!

1179
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:07,770
All right.

1180
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:11,030
Oh, hey, man. Good to see you.

1181
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,780
Dalton!

1182
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,200
Dalton!

1183
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:22,950
What?

1184
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,460
It's about fuckin' time.

1185
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:28,710
That's what!

1186
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,460
You know, I got sent here special.

1187
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,800
Just for you.

1188
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,180
But you brought all your friends with you?

1189
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:40,010
I thought you might miss havin' an audience.

1190
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,390
I was trying to be thoughtful.

1191
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,140
Like on pay-per-view.

1192
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,060
25 quid.

1193
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,650
Watch me pulp your face!

1194
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:52,820
Well, I guess I'm gonna lose, then.

1195
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,410
Don't be like that.

1196
01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:00,580
Here. I've got a tip for ya.

1197
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,580
Don't let no one get this close.

1198
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,500
There he is.

1199
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,260
The world's most notorious fighter, Dalton.

1200
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,050
Put'er there.

1201
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,490
There's something wrong with you.

1202
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,120
Me, too.

1203
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,130
Dex, this is serious! Are you a cop or what? We need help!

1204
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:17,340
I sent two cars already, El. It's the best I could do.

1205
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,260
Dalton. Dalton.

1206
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,930
Hey! Are you okay?

1207
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,890
Ellie! Billy's really hurt.

1208
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,060
Ellie!

1209
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,650
- Come on, it's okay. Sit down. - Fuck!

1210
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,110
He fucked him up really bad.

1211
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,940
- I'm here. What happened? - Hit him with the golf club.

1212
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,700
That Irish fuck broke my back.

1213
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,410
Fuck.

1214
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:29,780
Hey. What, are you leaving?

1215
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,830
You're a funny one, Frankie.

1216
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,250
Okay. I mean, yeah...

1217
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,460
I know I wasn't totally honest with you, all right?

1218
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,250
Brandt wants to take the Road House away from me.

1219
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,170
You see that? All up and down the highway?

1220
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,470
Brandt owns all of that.

1221
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,010
And he wants to level it and...

1222
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,550
build some bullshit resort for a bunch of rich assholes.

1223
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,560
And he needs the Road House to do it. But I'm not gonna let that happen.

1224
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,640
I'm the last holdout, man.

1225
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:56,100
You should keep holdin' out.

1226
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,730
Hey. Brandt's out of money.

1227
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,570
And he's borrowing from shady guys.

1228
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,480
And when he doesn't pay them back...

1229
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,070
they're gonna fucking end him.

1230
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,990
All right, well, fuck that guy.

1231
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:08,360
So, what? You're leaving now?

1232
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,700
Frankie, I told you from the jump...

1233
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,540
you should've hired that other guy.

1234
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:16,540
They scared you off?

1235
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,670
Are you really that afraid?

1236
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:20,210
Yes, I am afraid.

1237
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,340
More than you could ever understand.

1238
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:37,310
Things didn't exactly go to plan, Mr. B.

1239
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,150
Knox didn't kill the bouncer.

1240
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,110
Most of our guys are pretty banged up.

1241
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:49,320
Also, the wrong cops showed at the Road House, so...

1242
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,780
Big Dick can't help us there.

1243
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,290
What do you want me to do?

1244
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,460
I want you to get me another bottle from the galley.

1245
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,130
Hey, it's not safe in there.

1246
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,550
Where's the little girl? That little girl and her father.

1247
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,220
Ambulance took 'em to the hospital.

1248
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,510
Now get out of there!

1249
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,440
I didn't hear a car.

1250
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,020
Yeah, well, I walked.

1251
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,520
From the bookstore.

1252
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,820
So, you got our little message?

1253
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,070
I sure did.

1254
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:54,820
Was that your idea?

1255
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:56,780
Yeah, she's a cute girl.

1256
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,450
She's kinda stubborn.

1257
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,700
Bit like you.

1258
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
You know...

1259
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,790
the funny thing is...

1260
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,920
I was already leaving.

1261
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:13,130
We finally scared you off, huh?

1262
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,800
Uh, not exactly.

1263
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:17,930
Just as long as you're scared.

1264
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,730
I just broke the hyoid bone in your throat.

1265
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,690
Probably also collapsed your trachea.

1266
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,980
Either way, you won't be able to breathe anymore.

1267
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:39,240
You know, it's strange. Somebody else asked me if I was afraid today.

1268
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,700
I am afraid.

1269
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:46,210
I'm afraid of what happens when somebody pushes me too far.

1270
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,290
Somebody just like you.

1271
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,340
'Cause I know what happens next.

1272
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,930
Oh, fuck. Okay.

1273
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:06,850
Hey. Hey, man.

1274
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,480
Wow, he looks heavy.

1275
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,150
Good for you. Um...

1276
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:12,610
Hey, man, I was just... I was just leaving...

1277
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,570
you know, for good.

1278
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,400
Turns out these guys...

1279
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:19,450
not as nice as I thought they were initially.

1280
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,490
I just like riding motorcycles, man...

1281
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:24,080
but it's really hard to do in South Florida without a group.

1282
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,290
Hey, man.

1283
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,330
You're not gonna kill me or anything, right?

1284
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,500
Where's Brandt?

1285
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:34,210
Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you, man. They don't tell me much. You know.

1286
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,670
Kinda the last one to find out about everything...

1287
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,590
which is kinda weird position to be in.

1288
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,430
But I overheard some of Brandt's guys talking and...

1289
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,180
I guess there's a meeting at Harvest Key.

1290
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,470
Brandt's getting some of the money that he needs for something.

1291
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,480
It's at 5:00 a.m.

1292
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,230
Which I think is early for a meeting. Am I right?

1293
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,020
Okay.

1294
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:56,820
I'll see you. Thank you for no more violence.

1295
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,360
Good luck with the guy.

1296
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,980
Let him go.

1297
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:29,770
- Fuck off! - Stop!

1298
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,780
That's enough! Stop!

1299
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,080
All right, all right, we're good.

1300
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,250
You wanna count it?

1301
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,390
Hey!

1302
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,000
Oh, hey, you're awake.

1303
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,540
My boat.

1304
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:22,170
Yeah. You're gonna be short one sheriff's boat.

1305
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,670
Sorry.

1306
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:26,430
Jesus! Did you just kill him?

1307
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,260
Oh, no.

1308
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,560
He's already dead. I killed him hours ago.

1309
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,770
Is that my gun?

1310
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,430
Yep, sure is.

1311
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,440
Wait. You don't have to do this.

1312
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,110
I wish I didn't.

1313
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:42,480
But I'm angry.

1314
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:46,490
It takes a lot to get me angry, but when I am...

1315
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:49,280
I just can't let go. I wish I could...

1316
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,910
but your boss and Brandt really pissed me off.

1317
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,790
They'll know those bullets didn't kill him.

1318
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,590
It'll just confuse 'em.

1319
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,590
I'll tell 'em it was you.

1320
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,510
Oh, okay!

1321
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,640
You know what though?

1322
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,470
There's a real possibility you won't remember any of this anyway.

1323
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,470
Wait, wait, what?

1324
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:17,230
When you've been fighting as long as I have,

1325
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,980
you know the power of a concussion.

1326
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:20,730
- Wait. - A real whack can really knock...

1327
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,690
the short-term memory out of ya.

1328
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,230
Something about how it takes a memory...

1329
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,240
a couple of minutes to get to the long-term part of your brain.

1330
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,110
I don't know. Anyway, you and I have only been talking for about a minute and half.

1331
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,410
I don't understand.

1332
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,120
What's that over there?

1333
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:34,540
Hello, this is Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Williams.

1334
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,450
How can I help you?

1335
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,410
Yes, hi. I just thought you should know that there's a dead body...

1336
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:40,130
and a suspicious sheriff's deputy stranded on Harvest Key.

1337
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:41,170
Excuse me?

1338
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,710
Yeah, you'll need to get there quick 'cause I already called the local news.

1339
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,960
Can I get a name and callback number just in case we get...

1340
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:53,640
Sheriff.

1341
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:03,520
I just wanna talk.

1342
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,360
Are you here to arrest me again?

1343
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,360
Dalton, listen. It's Ellie.

1344
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:09,950
They have her.

1345
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,120
Brandt's got her.

1346
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,950
Wants his money. The money you took.

1347
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,660
I didn't take any money.

1348
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,410
My deputy told me.

1349
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,080
You were talking some shit about short-term memory.

1350
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,670
Shit.

1351
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:25,130
Yeah, I did take it.

1352
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,920
You need to give it back to him.

1353
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,680
Right, you told him I took it?

1354
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:33,260
It doesn't matter. He blames me anyway.

1355
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,640
He thinks I'm lying.

1356
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:37,100
It was my deputy in charge of the goddamn money.

1357
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:40,230
If my daughter means anything to you, you'll help me get her back.

1358
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,310
Dalton, listen.

1359
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:48,030
He wants the money by noon, or he says he'll kill her.

1360
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:49,280
I believe him.

1361
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:51,820
Please help me.

1362
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,790
Okay.

1363
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,710
Oh, thank God. Let's get the money...

1364
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,960
It's not here.

1365
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,800
How long will it take?

1366
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,970
I don't know. I hid it. It's gonna take a while.

1367
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,390
Where should I meet you?

1368
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,010
I like polishing my boat.

1369
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:18,220
Nothing makes me happier than to see it all shiny and...

1370
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,730
Oh, hold on, I'll call you back. Shit. Hey!

1371
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:21,980
Fuck you doing, man?

1372
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,650
- That's my boat, buddy. Get off! - Great, you're here.

1373
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,520
You must be the ex-boyfriend. I'm just looking for the key.

1374
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,030
Ellie told me to come get the boat.

1375
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:31,320
Here they are. Bingo!

1376
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,740
You're that bouncer asshole, aren't you?

1377
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:36,410
Yes, I am that "bouncer asshole."

1378
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,830
You see this right here, pal? I'm a cop, you idiot.

1379
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,450
Don't worry. I'll bring it right back.

1380
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,120
No. Hey, you're not goin' anywhere, man.

1381
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,250
Hey!

1382
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:47,000
You're in trouble. Back it up.

1383
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:50,170
It's fine. I'll be back in a couple hours, all right?

1384
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:52,050
Nothing is fine about this.

1385
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,640
Okay. Okay. You got two hours.

1386
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,970
Bring that back without a scratch on her, you got it?

1387
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,890
Not one scratch.

1388
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,850
Come on, it's water. How am I gonna get a scratch on it?

1389
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:42,390
All right. Let's see what this is about.

1390
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,440
Where the fuck is everyone?

1391
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,050
Thank you, sir.

1392
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,560
Come here.

1393
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,140
Money's not on the boat, if that's what you're looking for.

1394
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:26,270
Oh, yeah?

1395
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,690
Man, you were supposed to bring the money with you.

1396
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:29,980
Brandt's gonna be disappointed.

1397
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:31,940
That's okay. I'll just tell him you took it.

1398
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:33,110
Oh, yeah?

1399
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,610
Let's go.

1400
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:41,950
Oh, this guy.

1401
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,670
Nice boat.

1402
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:01,680
- Looks expensive. - Yeah.

1403
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:04,060
It used to be my old man's.

1404
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:06,850
I got it when he went away.

1405
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:10,560
Along with all his obligations...

1406
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,560
all his debts.

1407
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,570
So, yeah.

1408
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,490
It's fuckin' expensive.

1409
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:18,530
Speaking of which,

1410
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,320
where's my goddamn money?

1411
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,320
Oh, I gave it to him.

1412
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,280
- You fucker! - Hey, calm down.

1413
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,200
Sam.

1414
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,160
Why do you keep wasting my time?

1415
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,250
Honestly, you were told the girl's life depended on it.

1416
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:34,340
So, where's my fucking money?

1417
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:40,010
I don't see Ellie anywhere.

1418
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:42,300
And this guy looks pretty comfortable for a guy

1419
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:44,140
who just had his daughter kidnapped.

1420
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,350
There's no kidnapping, dumb-ass.

1421
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:49,480
Ohh! A double-cross.

1422
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:51,900
You actually believed that Ben took my daughter?

1423
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,020
We are partners, idiot.

1424
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:57,110
Yeah, about that. I did kinda take her.

1425
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,990
- What? - Another double-cross.

1426
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,110
What the fuck, Ben?

1427
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:01,450
I wouldn't do that.

1428
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,660
Big Dick, sit down.

1429
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:06,700
Sit the fuck down!

1430
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,580
How was I supposed to know I could trust you, huh?

1431
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,920
Once I get my money, you can have her.

1432
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:13,210
Son of a bitch!

1433
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,630
Boys, do you want me to give you a second?

1434
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:15,790
- Hey... - Stop.

1435
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:17,800
Just stop!

1436
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,720
I'm trying to build somethin'.

1437
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,100
You keep on pushin' me

1438
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:30,350
and just pushin' me.

1439
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,440
And I just... Fuck, it's funny.

1440
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,440
It's like... I'm just like, "Fuck!"

1441
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:38,070
- He's noisy. - Yes.

1442
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:40,190
He is noisy. He is.

1443
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,830
Now I'm gonna have to have Sam here hurt you.

1444
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,660
- Oh, no. Please. - Oh, yes.

1445
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,660
- Please, no. - Don't look at me like that.

1446
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,750
Now, if that doesn't work, I'll have to get Ellie.

1447
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,920
And shit will get real crazy, real fast.

1448
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,630
- Hey, wait, goddammit. Wait! - Stop. Sit down.

1449
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:05,640
Oh, my God, this fucking psycho again.

1450
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:10,970
Do not let that maniac on the boat.

1451
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:15,270
I do know one guy who's gonna be pretty pissed about this whole betrayal thing.

1452
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,770
And who is that?

1453
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,940
Oh, just some asshole cop.

1454
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:23,200
What the hell is he doing?

1455
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,030
Shit.

1456
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:27,120
What the fuck is he doing?

1457
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:43,510
Motherfucker!

1458
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:49,220
Ellie? Ellie!

1459
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,350
Fire!

1460
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,650
Ellie!

1461
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:57,940
Abandon ship!

1462
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,570
Ellie!

1463
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:03,650
Hey!

1464
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:13,040
Ellie!

1465
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,170
Ellie!

1466
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:22,800
Ellie!

1467
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:27,300
Ellie.

1468
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,100
Hey, dickhead!

1469
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,860
Get off the boat!

1470
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:52,580
- Hey, asshole! - Watch out!

1471
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:54,200
You're gonna die!

1472
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,250
Go, Ellie, go. I'll be right behind you. Go.

1473
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,260
I'm gonna fucking...

1474
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:18,140
Oh, fuck.

1475
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,610
You got shit taste in boyfriends, El.

1476
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:25,360
- Don't fucking move! - Fuck you!

1477
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,530
I'll just destroy the fucking Road House myself.

1478
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,890
There ya are.

1479
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:54,220
Let me help you.

1480
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:04,020
Lookie here.

1481
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,320
- Our own little octagon. - What?

1482
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:08,860
Who taught you shapes?

1483
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,220
Your fucking boyfriend!

1484
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:35,100
Let's pick him up.

1485
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:54,280
You motherfucker!

1486
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:01,910
Fuck!

1487
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:06,790
Jesus.

1488
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,790
Dalton.

1489
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:13,760
You trying to kill us?

1490
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,300
No. Get off!

1491
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,770
Ellie! You always...

1492
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:24,440
You're such an idiot!

1493
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:36,240
Dalton, come on!

1494
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,520
Wait here.

1495
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,520
Oh, God.

1496
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:30,600
Fucking fishing spear?

1497
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:31,770
I'm done! I'm done!

1498
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:37,990
Let's stop.

1499
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:39,530
Oh, come on.

1500
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,240
I'm done.

1501
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:44,950
Shit.

1502
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:50,580
You broke my fuckin' nose.

1503
01:42:52,830 --> 01:42:54,670
Everything I fuckin' worked for...

1504
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,880
all gone because of a fucking bouncer!

1505
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,650
Shit.

1506
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:31,460
Looks like I fucked up your leg.

1507
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,620
You're a shit driver.

1508
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,080
Wrong side of the road.

1509
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,830
Be nice.

1510
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,980
This piano is out of tune.

1511
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,390
Sounds pretty good to me.

1512
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:49,640
You gonna kill me now?

1513
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:52,100
I thought we had to be friends first.

1514
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:45,070
Kill him!

1515
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:48,610
Fucking joke.

1516
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,120
Do it!

1517
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:56,830
Do your fucking job!

1518
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,750
What does it take to shut you up?

1519
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:32,880
I'm sorry.

1520
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:51,480
It's time for you to go, Dalton.

1521
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,320
You were never here.

1522
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:55,150
I got you covered.

1523
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:04,120
Go.

1524
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:07,790
You have to go.

1525
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,040
Okay.

1526
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:49,670
It's not so bad.

1527
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,670
Yeah, no, it's fixable.

1528
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,840
- Definitely. - Yep.

1529
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,380
It's fixable. This is...

1530
01:49:56,970 --> 01:49:58,050
-"Fixable"? - Yep.

1531
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:59,510
There's a truck in the bar.

1532
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,640
That is correct.

1533
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,140
But as soon as this is clear and we...

1534
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:04,270
Little elbow grease.

1535
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:05,600
It's gonna be good as new.

1536
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,600
Watch out for the pufferfish, please.

1537
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:10,150
- Come on, move it. - Hey.

1538
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,230
- Yeah? - Are you guys open today?

1539
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:18,110
Yeah. We're always open.

1540
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:20,410
Let's go.

1541
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:22,530
Swing around.

1542
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,700
Let me get this.

1543
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:43,930
Hey.

1544
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:49,850
So, this is it? You're just gonna...

1545
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,940
You're just gonna ride off into the sunset?

1546
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:56,360
That's always how the story ends, right?

1547
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,910
No, not always.

1548
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:05,280
Sometimes the hero stays and...

1549
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:07,040
makes his own little homestead.

1550
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:10,210
I don't think I'm the hero in this particular story, Charlie.

1551
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:16,710
So, maybe you're not the hero.

1552
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,380
I got news for you.

1553
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:22,720
You ain't the villain either.

1554
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:32,350
Charlie!

1555
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:57,090
- You good? - Yeah, I'm good.

1556
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:59,260
- Shut up, man. - You better stay on your toes.

1557
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:01,130
- Don't matter if he gone. - Shut up.

1558
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:41,610
Come on, you pussy!

1559
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:22,690
Stop that man!
