{\an8}<i>"the worst kids

5
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,419

6

{\an8}<i>They stole.</i>

7

{\an8}Come back here!

8
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,604
{\an8}<i>They smoked cigars.</i>

9
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,484
<i>Even the girls.</i>

10
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,694
{\an8}<i>They hit little kids.</i>

11
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,864
{\an8}<i>Even if the little kids
were bigger than them.</i>

12
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,408
Hey!

13
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,540
{\an8}<i>They took
the Lord's name in vain.</i>

14
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,835
Oh, my God!

15
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,008
<i>They cussed teachers.</i>

16
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,264
{\an8}<i>They even set fire</i>

17
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,768
<i>to Fred Shoemaker's old,
broken-down tool shed.</i>

18
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,478
{\an8}<i>To be fair, the shed was ugly</i>

19
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,523
{\an8}<i>and was about
to fall over anyway.</i>

20
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,191
{\an8}<i>My father said, "Burning it down</i>

21

it was a good thing,</i>

23
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,323
<i>"they wouldn't have
done it at all."</i>

24
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,951
<i>They were just
so all-around awful,</i>

25
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,370
{\an8}<i>you could hardly believe
they were real.</i>

26
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,455
{\an8}<i>No one knew
why they were that way.</i>

27
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,792
{\an8}<i>It seemed they just came out
of the womb mean.</i>

28
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,085
{\an8}<i>And speaking of that womb,</i>

29
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,754
{\an8}<i>us kids have never
seen their parents.</i>

30
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,090
<i>Some thought they'd given up
and run away.</i>

31
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,552
{\an8}<i>My theory was that they were the
first parents to be kidnapped</i>

32
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,180
<i>tied up,
and robbed by their own kids.</i>

33
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,056
<i>Ralph,</i>

34
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,975

39
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,527
{\an8}<i>All the same,
except for different sizes</i>

40
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,112
{\an8}<i>and different
black-and-blue marks</i>

41
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,155
{\an8}<i>where they had
clonked each other.</i>

42
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,283
{\an8}Okay, everybody,
find your seats.

43
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,618
I hope you're ready
for Show and Tell.

44
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,371
{\an8}My first Shower-and-Teller
will be...

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,456
Me.

46
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,501
{\an8}Okay. Ollie Herdman is first.

47
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,211
{\an8}I'm... Wait.

48
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,588
{\an8}It's my cat.

49
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,673
{\an8}Spike.

50
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,692
{\an8}What's all the fuss about?

51
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,530
{\an8}I can't see. I can't see.

52
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,616
<i>That's me.</i>

53
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,034
Hey!

54
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,745
<i>Did I mention they stole?</i>

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,334
What do you want?

56
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,586
This necklace?

57
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,880
Or your neck? Hmm?

58
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,256
<i>I chose my neck.</i>

59
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,590
<i>I usually avoided trouble,</i>

60
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,428
<i>but apparently my favourite
locket got her attention.</i>

61
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,515
<i>Imogene was their
unchallenged leader.</i>

62
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,518
<i>She struck mortal fear
into anyone in her path,</i>

63
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,645
<i>including adults.</i>

64
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,813
<i>She especially
didn't like Alice.</i>

65
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,565
- Hey, Nits.
- Ow!

66
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,983
<i>Probably because Alice</i>

67
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,153
<i>was the exact opposite
of Imogene.</i>

68
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,072
<i>All the way down to her...</i>

69
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,366
Your hands
smell like soap again.

70
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,659
Hiding your nits?

71
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,412
It was head lice, and it was
one time at summer camp.

72
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,415
<i>But Imogene never forgets.</i>

73
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,798
- The Herdmans are just...
- I know.

74
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,759
The Herdmans are absolutely

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,929
the worst kids
in the history of the world.

76
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,059
What'd they do now, dear?

77
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,311
<i>My mum gave me that locket.</i>

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,397
Nothing.

79
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,482
The usual.

80
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,316
Set something on fire?

81
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,986
Dump soapy water
down a school hallway?

82
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,573
Steal your lunch and then punch
you for not havin' any sweets?

83
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,616
Something like that.

84
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,743
Do your homework tonight.
Big day tomorrow.

85
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,954
- Gettin' the Christmas tree.
- Great, Dad.

86
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,041
I'm sure the Herdmans
will find some way to ruin it.

87
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,211
That's not very jolly.

88
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,550
God, this is a selfish prayer.

89
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,636
I know
I shouldn't pray it, but...

90
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,054
can you send the Herdmans

91
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,724
somewhere far away
until I grow up?

92
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,061
Somewhere without many people.

93
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,857
Maybe an island
with no people at all.

94
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,110
And violent,
dangerous creatures.

95
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,615
Either do that, or make me
invisible until college.

96
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,950
That would fix it.

97
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,661
Thanks, God.

98
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,248
Sorry for this awful prayer.

99
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,375
<i>We figured the Herdmans
were headed straight for Hell</i>

100
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,377
<i>by way of the state prison</i>

101
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,713
<i>until they got mixed up
with my mother,</i>

102
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,841
<i>our church,
and our big Christmas pageant.</i>

103
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,059
<i>That's my family.</i>

104
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,561
<i>My dad, Bob,
full-time accountant,</i>

105
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,647
<i>my mum, Grace, full-time mum,</i>

106
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,234
<i>my brother, Charlie,
full-time smart alec.</i>

107
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,154
Every year.

108
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,782
Okay. Honey.

109
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,954
Little help, please. Sweetheart?

110
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>Normal family in a normal town.</i>

111
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,462
<i>And this is our town.</i>

112
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,631
<i>It doesn't have much.</i>

113
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,383
<i>The one thing our town
was known for</i>

114
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,593
<i>was our church's annual
Christmas pageant.</i>

115
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,680
<i>It was a big deal.</i>

116
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,015
<i>Even bigger this year
because of the anniversary.</i>

117
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,726
<i>I'll tell you everything
you need to know</i>

118
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,521
<i>about the Emmanuel Annual.</i>

119
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,940
<i>This is the very first one,</i>

120
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,067
<i>the year our church
in our town opened.</i>

121
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,778
<i>Legend has it, the pageant
used to mean something</i>

122
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,947
<i>and that everyone in town
was excited to see it.</i>

123
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,448
<i>They wanted to be reminded</i>

124
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,158
<i>of the beauty
of the Christmas story</i>

125
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,246
<i>But I'm not sure the pageant
was all that beautiful any more.</i>

126
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,664
<i>This is us last year.</i>

127
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,708
<i>That's Alice,
you met her earlier,</i>

128
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,835
<i>in her third year playing Mary.</i>

129
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,545
<i>And that's Mrs Armstrong,</i>

130
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,839
<i>who's directed the pageant
for forever</i>

131
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,718
<i>and makes sure
nothing ever changes, ever.</i>

132
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,554
<i>In my opinion,
after the 74th same old pageant,</i>

133
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,640
<i>it had all the depth and joy
of a recycled Christmas card.</i>

134
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,184
<i>But keeping it the same</i>

135
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,395
<i>is exactly how the town
wanted it.</i>

136
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,731
<i>Because it was the 75th,</i>

137
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,399
<i>there was even more attention
than normal.</i>

138
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,359
<i>People from other towns
were coming.</i>

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,652
<i>Former cast members.</i>

140
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,237
<i>It was even in the paper.</i>

141
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,281
<i>And the Ladies Aid
was helping with the costumes</i>

142
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,825
<i>to make them nicer than normal.</i>

143
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,587
- Is that level?
- Tilting to the left.

144
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,130
- How about... How about now?
- Oh, that's worse.

145
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,381
<i>- Finally...</i>
- What?

146
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,509
<i>...in local news,
'tis the season to remind you</i>

147
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,595
<i>of the annual Christmas pageant
in the town of Emmanuel,</i>

148
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,181
<i>which will actually fall on
Christmas Day this year.</i>

149
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,099
They're advertising on TV now?

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,351
Attendance and giving
are down at church.

151
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,894
The town needs visitors.

152
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,523
I think they're desperate.

153
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,899
Okay, just tell me
when it's right.

154
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,108
You don't have to tell me
it's wrong.

155
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,401
I'll just assume
that it's wrong,

156
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,237
and you tell me
if it stops being wrong.

157
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,322
That's level.

158
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,698
These are kind of hot.

159
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,784
- Hold on.
- What?

160
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,663
- There.
- They got...

161
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>So, it's time to tell you
something about my mum.</i>

162
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,545
<i>It's hard to sum up what
she does in a single sentence.</i>

163
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>Whether it was doing our annual
Christmas decorating together</i>

164
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,341
<i>or making sure we participated
in the Christmas pageant,</i>

165
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,093
<i>even if we didn't want to,</i>

166
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,262
<i>she kept our family on track.</i>

167
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,931
<i>That was her main focus in life,</i>

168
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,686
<i>but that was about to change
right now.</i>

169
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,064
- Careful.
- What's going on?

170
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,318
- Is that a Herdman fire?
- That's the Armstrong house.

171
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,157
<i>Oh, no.</i>

172
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,827
<i>Mrs Wendelken. Alice's mum,</i>

173
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,162
<i>the queen bee
of the town supermums,</i>

174
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,998
<i>whose single glance...</i>

175
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,291
<i>That's the one.</i>

176
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,709
<i>...could make my mum feel small.</i>

177
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,212
- Tuck in your shirt. Oh.
- It's under my coat.

178
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:49,965
You're gonna be okay.

179
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,885
Helen, are you in much pain?

180
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,721
- Yes. Terrible.
- I'm so sorry. What happened?

181
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,556
I took a spill. Never mind how.

182
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,808
Broke both of her legs.

183
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,685
- Both of them?
- Yes, both.

184
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,729
Call Mr Armstrong
at the factory.

185
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,480
And shut off the cooker
under my potatoes

186
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,108
or the whole house'll burn down.

187
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,153
Inform the Ladies Aid,
I will not be at the meeting.

188
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,821
We need to find a replacement
for the bazaar.

189
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,907
- Okay, that's a lot.
- And the Potluck Committee.

190
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,241
And the Beautification
Committee.

191
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,703
- Of course.
- And the Christmas pageant.

192
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,998
I'll need someone
who can follow my plan.

193
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,500
- Rebecca?
- Yes.

194
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,960
You could do that.
Especially because of Alice.

195
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,962
I can't, obviously.

196
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,131
I'm too busy with my job
and the other committees.

197
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,718
But don't worry, Helen.
We'll find someone.

198
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,637
I suppose I could try.

199
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,555
That's okay, Grace.

200
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,267
The pageant is an especially
big deal this year.

201
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,478
You can bring the biscuits.
That's your thing.

202
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,022
I'm sorry, "my thing"?

203
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,441
Bringing the biscuits
is "my thing"?

204
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:54,071
Well, your shop-bought brand
from last year were so tasty.

205
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,949
You'll be great.

206
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,117
We'll find someone, Helen.

207
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,415
<i>One other thing about my mum,</i>

208
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,792
<i>she preferred
keeping life simple.</i>

209
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:11,212
<i>But if one of the judgy
town mums challenged her,</i>

210
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,005
<i>she'd try anything.</i>

211
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,090
<i>Even...</i>

212
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,968
- Mrs Armstrong?
- You did what?

213
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,055
You volunteered to direct
the Christmas pageant?

214
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,223
She needed help.

215
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,141
Mrs Wendelken was gonna find...

216
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,685
Mrs Wendelken doesn't have
to do everything

217
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,771
and those ladies need to know
I am perfectly capable...

218
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,897
You realize that Armstrong woman

219
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,775
is gonna be calling this house
ten times a day?

220
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,528
You didn't give her
our phone number, did you?

221
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,446
You promised
she would never have it.

222
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,615
After Mrs Wendelken said that
I could just bring biscuits,

223
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,867
it was all a blur.

224
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,034
Now I guess I have to attend.

225
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,413
And watch Charlie the shepherd
wearing my bathrobe again.

226
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,040
Oh, no. Did somebody die?

227
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,418
It's worse than that, son.

228
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,132
Your mum is running
the Christmas pageant.

229
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,676
I bet you all think
this is really funny,

230
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,304
but the Christmas pageant
is a tradition,

231
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:04,265
and it's important
and I can manage it just fine.

232
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,601
In fact, I told Mrs Armstrong

233
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,563
it's going to be the best
Christmas pageant ever.

234
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,567
I wonder who that is.

235
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,613
<i>This was not good.</i>

236
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,948
<i>The pageant
had to be great this year</i>

237
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,992
<i>and as much as I admired her
for stepping up,</i>

238
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,203
<i>Mum had never done
anything like this before</i>

239
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,747
<i>and didn't know what
or who she was up against.</i>

240
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,750
<i>I couldn't stand to see her fail
in front of the whole town.</i>

241
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,586
<i>- But...</i>
- You got this, Mum.

242
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,008
God, please make it
a good pageant

243
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,801
so Mum doesn't get blamed.

244
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,803
<i>Now, why did I spend
so much time</i>

245
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,847
<i>telling you
all about the Herdmans</i>

246
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,850
<i>and our town's lather,
rinse, repeat Christmas pageant?</i>

247
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,354
<i>What could one possibly
have to do with the other?</i>

248
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,606
<i>You'll see.</i>

249
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,858
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

250
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,695
As you know, once a month,
we ask the Sunday School

251
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,156
to be in service
for the first 15 minutes

252
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,742
and do something special.

253
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:08,580
Sing a song, act out a parable,
or recite some Bible verses.

254
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,666
Before we bring them up,

255
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,917
I'm sure you heard about

256
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,088
Mrs Armstrong's
unfortunate accident.

257
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,922
She is recovering.

258
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:23,303
But I want to be sure to give
special mention to Grace,

259
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,349
for volunteering
to direct the Christmas pageant.

260
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,604
We are all very grateful,

261
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,064
especially with
all the attention

262
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,774
the pageant
is getting this year.

263
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,152
So good luck. No pressure.

264
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,280
All right, this month,

265
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,865
Ms Warren asked the kids

266
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,451
to share what they liked best
about church.

267
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,744
Ms Warren.

268
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,495
Go ahead, sweetie.

269
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,164
So just up there.
Yep, big voice.

270
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,333
What I like best
about Sunday School

271
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,170
is the good feeling I get
when I go there.

272
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,552
All right, Minnie, you're up.
Go ahead. Voice loud.

273
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,806
I love to sing hymns,
and I love Jesus.

274
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,018
So cute.

275
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,270
Charlie, how 'bout you?

276
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,526
What I like best
about church is...

277
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,738
there aren't any Herdmans here.

278
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,418
Charlie'll tell you some
other things he likes next time.

279
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,714
Happy Sunday.

280
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,261
What?
There are other things I like,

281
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,639
but she said,
"What you like best."

282
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,059
And what I like best
is no Herdmans.

283
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,771
Hey, that's not a very
Christian sentiment.

284
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,733
It's the truth. And you say,
"Always tell the truth."

285
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,405
When your dad says that,

286
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,910
he means not
at the expense of kindness.

287
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,703
- Nailed it.
- Pulled that out of your...

288
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,039
<i>The truth was,
the last three days in a row,</i>

289
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,502
<i>Leroy Herdman stole the dessert
from Charlie's lunch box.</i>

290
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,420
Give it up, Charlie!

291
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,758
<i>Why Charlie? I guess
it was his turn this month.</i>

292
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,854
{\an8}<i>Day three of the siege,
Charlie surrendered.</i>

293
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,065
Fine, take it. I don't care.

294
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,984
I get all the snacks I want
from church, anyway.

295
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,944
What kinds of snacks?

296
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:50,741
Chocolate cake, sweetie bars,
biscuits, Kool-Aid, ice cream,

297
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,495
doughnuts, popcorn balls.

298
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,665
So go ahead. Church gives me
everything I need.

299
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,292
Too bad you'll never know.

300
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,004
You'd melt if you ever
showed up in a church.

301
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,592
<i>Charlie's lie couldn't have
backfired more spectacularly.</i>

302
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,427
{\an8}<i>That Sunday was our food drive.</i>

303
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,013
Good morning. Thank you
for coming. Nice to see you.

304
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,014
Hello.

305
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,309
Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

306
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,397
You sure we got the right place?

307
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,524
They're here.

308
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,110
Oh, my goodness.

309
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,362
We can do this.

310
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,323
Just keep smiling.

311
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,743
- Where do you get the cake?
- Cake?

312
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,912
Yeah. Right over there,
that's it.

313
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,623
Good idea, Leroy.
We can work with this.

314
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,875
Are you here for Sunday School?

315
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,921
A-ha! More school, he says.
I knew there'd be a catch.

316
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,464
Come on, let's get outta here.

317
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,926
No, no, no.
It's not like regular school.

318
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,137
You'll learn about Jesus
and you'll sing songs about Him.

319
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,223
- Are your parents here?
- Mum's working.

320
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,058
We were told
there'd be desserts.

321
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,101
Free desserts to anyone
who wants 'em.

322
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm sure I could rustle you up
something special

323
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,691
after service,
if you'd like to stay.

324
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,069
I will show you where it is.

325
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,405
Oh, boy.

326
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,411
<i>Jesus loves me, this I know</i>

327
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,915
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

328
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,796
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

329
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,760
Beth, you'd be happy
to have them sit by you, right?

330
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,264
Great. Come now.

331
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,071
Well, we haven't melted yet.

332
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,322
<i>So they stayed.</i>

333
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,283
<i>Jesus loves me...</i>

334
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,910
<i>They didn't sing any hymns.</i>

335
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,871
<i>For the Bible...</i>

336
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,289
Our Father, who art in heaven...

337
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,457
<i>...or say prayers.</i>

338
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,294
Baby Jesus...

339
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,298
<i>But they did practise
their drawing skills.</i>

340
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,765
{\an8}<i>And made a little money.</i>

341
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,392
{\an8}All right, kids.

342
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,394
We're going to be starting
rehearsals soon

343
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,188
for our Christmas pageant.

344
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,815
So please be sure
to let your parents know

345
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,276
they'll need to stay after
church with you next week

346
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,694
for all the details.

347
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,071
I do hope you'll be
in the choir again this year.

348
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,741
- Your voice, it's so...
- Grief, Alice.

349
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,034
I'm not gonna try and play Mary

350
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,203
just because my mum's
running the pageant.

351
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,747
We want all of you to be there.

352
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,957
Hey, what's a pageant?

353
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,584
- It's a play.
- A play?

354
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,503
You know, like a film.

355
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,839
- But in front of people.
- A film, huh?

356
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,885
<i>The Herdmans
were big filmgoers.</i>

357
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,595
Come here, you little...

358
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:58,930
<i>Though they never paid
their own way.</i>

359
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,265
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop! Stop! Stop!

360
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,684
Hey. Hey, hey, hey...
Don't... Stop. Stop.

361
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,229
Stop fighting. Hey!
Hey, hey. Okay. Okay.

362
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,814
Hey! Enough! Dude. Hey!

363
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,701
Everyone shows up to watch.

364
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,120
It's about Jesus.

365
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,709
Everything here is.

366
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,627
<i>After that comment,</i>

367
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,964
<i>I figured she didn't care much
about the Christmas pageant.</i>

368
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,339
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

369
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,091
And at summer camp,
they have a super-fast boat.

370
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,009
It's way faster than a car.

371
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,427
I've only ever been on a canoe.

372
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,304
And then there's this raft
we dive off of.

373
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,682
- I can do the swan dive.
- Sounds fun.

374
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,184
And then you get eaten
by a bear.

375
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,898
So, Nits, Wallflower,
you ready for this?

376
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,234
I'm gonna be in your pageant
this year.

377
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,653
- You're what?
- Nits heard me.

378
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,030
I'm gonna be in your Bible play.

379
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,616
What?
You can't be in the pageant.

380
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,786
I'm gonna be Baby Jesus's mum.

381
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,955
You're too dirty to play Mary,
Imogene Herdman.

382
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,498
Everyone knows.

383
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,584
Alice!

384
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,670
- Who's Mary?
- Baby Jesus's mum.

385
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,672
Which everyone knows except you.

386
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,382
And I'm always Mary
in the pageant

387
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,510
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

388
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,223
Sweetie, you're gonna tell 'em
you don't wanna do it.

389
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,349
You want me to be Mary.

390
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,976
And why would I do that?

391
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,353
'Cause if you don't,
then next spring,

392
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,397
when the pussy willows come out,

393
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,940
I'm gonna stick a pussy willow

394
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,942
so far down
your pretty little ear,

395
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,570
they won't be able
to get it out.

396
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,907
It'll sprout there
and grow and grow.

397
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,700
And you'll spend
the rest of your life

398
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,871
with a pussy willow bush
growing right out of your head.

399
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,373
<i>Believe it or not,
she'd done it before.</i>

400
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,419
- Get off me! Ow!
- Okay. Just one sec. One sec.

401
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,590
What?

402
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,475
What are you lookin' at?

403
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,603
Why would you even
want to be in the pageant?

404
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:11,772
None of your business.

405
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,116
<i>While the little kids
were all tired,</i>

406
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,785
<i>and the big kids
were all hungry,</i>

407
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,246
<i>and the mothers all wanted
to go home and cook dinner</i>

408
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,872
<i>and the fathers
all wanted to go home</i>

409
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,249
<i>and watch the game on TV,</i>

410
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,336
<i>the Herdmans sat quietly,
waiting for my mum to begin.</i>

411
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:39,257
<i>And I was praying for a miracle
that Imogene would stay quiet</i>

412
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,967
<i>and the Herdmans wouldn't burn
anything down</i>

413
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,218
<i>and ruin my mum's rehearsal</i>

414
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,137
<i>and embarrass us
in front of everyone.</i>

415
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,266
<i>Okay, that's three miracles.</i>

416
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,020
Well, hello, everyone.

417
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,774
This won't take very long.

418
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,526
All right, just a moment.

419
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:02,905
This is from
a lot of calls this week.

420
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,991
Okay.

421
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:08,035
First, as Mrs Armstrong
always says,

422
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,498
"There are no small parts,
only small actors."

423
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,170
What does that mean?

424
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,839
I honestly don't know.

425
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,841
Okay, we don't have
many rehearsals,

426
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,136
so you must all try
to be present at every one.

427
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,724
- What if we get sick?
- You won't get sick.

428
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,019
Now, you little children
over here,

429
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,396
you will be angels.

430
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,106
"The older boys and girls
will be shepherds

431
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:40,110
"and guests at the inn
and members of the choir.

432
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,653
"And we need Mary and Joseph,

433
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,573
"the Three Wise Men,
and the Angel of the Lord.

434
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:49,785
"They aren't hard parts,
but they're important parts.

435
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,998
"So those kids must absolutely
come to every rehearsal." Oh.

436
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,625
What if they get sick?

437
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,002
- They won't get sick either.
- But what if they do?

438
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,505
Nobody is getting sick, David.

439
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,465
"We always start with Mary.

440
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:05,092
"We must choose Mary carefully

441
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,471
"because Mary
is the mother of Jesus.

442
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:12,476
"She should be a sweet,
happy little girl, who..."

443
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,355
Okay, enough of this.

444
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,358
I know many of you would like
to play Mary in our pageant,

445
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,652
but we only need one.

446
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,278
Imogene, do you have a question?

447
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,073
No. I wanna be Mary.

448
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,784
And Ralph wants to be Joe.

449
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,452
<i>It was like a detective film</i>

450
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,121
<i>where a nice little old lady
shoves a gun in the bank window</i>

451
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,373
<i>and says,
"Give me all your money,"</i>

452
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,874
<i>and you can't believe it.</i>

453
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,835
<i>My mother couldn't believe it.</i>

454
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,004
We have to give
everyone a chance.

455
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,216
Does anyone else
wanna volunteer for Joseph?

456
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,470
Elmer? You usually
like playing Joseph.

457
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,597
<i>Elmer hated playing Joseph.</i>

458
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,057
<i>But his dad was the minister,</i>

459
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,893
<i>so he made him
when nobody else volunteered.</i>

460
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,981
<i>Nobody else ever volunteered.</i>

461
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,819
Well, that's very surprising.
Anybody else?

462
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,322
All right.

463
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,575
Ralph will be our Joseph.

464
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,328
Would anyone else
like to volunteer for Mary?

465
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,331
Alice, don't you want to
volunteer this year?

466
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,626
No.

467
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,714
Anybody?

468
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,675
<i>Mum was in a terrible spot.
The worst.</i>

469
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:31,721
<i>The parents, the pageant,
the church, the whole town,</i>

470
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,308
<i>they'd blame Mum
if the pageant imploded.</i>

471
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,435
<i>Would I step up to help?</i>

472
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:39,979
<i>What I would do next
would determine</i>

473
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,649
<i>the fate of the pageant
to this very day.</i>

474
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,367
Okay.

475
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:56,121
Imogene will be our Mary.

476
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:03,252
We have Wise Men next.

477
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,213
Leroy, Claude and Ollie
wanna play them.

478
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:08,174
Okay, now we have to give
everyone a chance, Imogene.

479
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,426
Everyone's had their chance.

480
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,721
They've had
all kinds of chances.

481
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,389
- And the Angel of the Lord?
- Gladys.

482
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,683
Me!

483
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,438
Robby! Robby!

484
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,649
Michelle.

485
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,776
You raise that hand.

486
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,530
Suppose that's that, then.

487
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,282
We need the shepherds.

488
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,660
Charlie, you're in.

489
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,410
David and Robby?

490
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,747
I just remembered,
we're going to Philadelphia.

491
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,375
- We are not!
- I'll probably be sick.

492
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,585
I'll put you both down
for probably.

493
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,838
Mum, Gladys Herdman
hits too hard.

494
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,799
My goodness, Gladys isn't going
to hit anyone.

495
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,884
What an idea!

496
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:54,595
The Angel of the Lord visits
the shepherds in the field

497
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,681
and tells them
that Jesus is born.

498
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:58,057
And hits them.

499
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,059
I don't wanna hear
another word about it.

500
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,395
No shepherds
will quit or get sick.

501
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:03,981
Or go to Philadelphia.

502
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:05,649
Ow!

503
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,862
<i>I felt terrible for my mum.
And some of it was my fault.</i>

504
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,823
<i>Here she was, five minutes
into covering for Mrs Armstrong</i>

505
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:16,784
<i>and the Herdmans had hijacked
the entire pageant.</i>

506
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,495
<i>I'd been afraid
it'd be the same old thing,</i>

507
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:22,207
<i>and now I'd do anything for it
to be boring again.</i>

508
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,794
<i>Word about what happened
spread faster</i>

509
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,714
<i>than a Herdman-set grass fire.</i>

510
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,924
<i>Kids told their parents,
parents called their neighbours</i>

511
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,802
<i>and neighbours
called their relatives.</i>

512
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,355
How could you let this happen?
How could...

513
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,941
How could...

514
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:49,902
How could...

515
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,570
Does anyone have a paper bag?

516
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,905
It's not fair
that a whole family

517
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,156
who doesn't even
go to our church

518
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,033
just barged in and took over
the pageant.

519
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,618
Injustice was done.

520
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,580
We all agree it was a travesty.

521
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,082
Because the Herdmans volunteered
for the pageant?

522
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,293
She is referring
to the grievous assault

523
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,296
on the impartial
casting process yesterday.

524
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:13,090
With all due respect,
nothing about the process

525
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,177
has ever been impartial,
Mrs Armstrong.

526
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:18,638
And as for a grievous assault,

527
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,225
I literally pleaded with
your children to participate.

528
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,436
We were paralysed with shock.

529
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,021
But you spoke.

530
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,190
It came in waves.

531
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,069
I'm sorry, but we're using

532
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,112
really big words
to talk about a pageant

533
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,198
where the kids
just have to stand

534
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,700
in the same spot
they stand in every year.

535
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,161
We take it seriously.

536
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:45,957
So do I, Mrs Slocum,
that's why I volunteered.

537
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,503
Judging by who you cast as Mary,
you apparently don't.

538
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,214
Rebecca,

539
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,132
is it possible that,
as Alice's mum,

540
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,553
you have a personal interest
in who plays Mary?

541
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,805
The pageant is sacred.

542
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,431
Wait.

543
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:03,933
The pageant is sacred?

544
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,102
- Obviously.
- It's about community.

545
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,937
- And fundraising.
- And Mother Mary.

546
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,481
- And tradition.
- What do you all suggest?

547
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:13,067
That I kick the Herdmans
out of the Christmas pageant

548
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,862
and keep them out of the church?

549
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,030
Yes.

550
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,257
I mean,
I can't just kick 'em out.

551
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,051
But they're right. It might be
a disaster with the Herdmans.

552
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,971
Now, that's a pageant
I'd actually like to see.

553
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,890
Mother Mary puffin' on a cigar,

554
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,601
the shepherds clobbering
each other with their hooks.

555
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,478
Five bucks say
they burn down the manger.

556
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,521
Why'd you have to tell 'em

557
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,356
they'd get food at church, dummy?

558
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,566
'Cause I didn't think
they'd actually

559
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,109
walk into a church building!

560
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,987
I'm surprised
they didn't burst into flames.

561
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,698
Sorry I didn't volunteer.

562
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:02,492
Did I ruin the pageant?

563
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:06,455
Oh, my goodness, no! Honey...

564
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:11,792
Beth, I will tell you
what I told those condescending,

565
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,920
hyper-controlling
busybodies from church,

566
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,546
that while Helen Armstrong
might be surprised

567
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,839
the sun rises every morning

568
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,508
even though she's not there
to supervise it,

569
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,134
she is not the only woman
in the world

570
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,636
who can run a Christmas pageant.

571
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,304
And if they don't think
I can do it,

572
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,972
they are in for a big lesson.

573
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,350
You said all that?

574
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,060
Well, not all of it.

575
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,979
- Any of it?
- Never mind.

576
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,398
<i>It was the night
of the first rehearsal.</i>

577
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,193
<i>The big night for Mum to prove
she could make this work.</i>

578
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,737
<i>I was ready to help
in any way I could.</i>

579
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:42,031
<i>But first, as usual,
the kids were sent outside</i>

580
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,116
<i>while the parents
had prayer time together.</i>

581
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,786
<i>I think it was less about prayer
than that they wanted us all</i>

582
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,372
<i>to get our energy out
so we'd behave later.</i>

583
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:50,666
<i>But then...</i>

584
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,347
Now.

585
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:23,866
Stop.

586
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,744
Hey, kids. They'll be ready
for you in a minute.

587
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,205
Have a good rehearsal.

588
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,686
<i>The first rehearsal
was usually about as much fun</i>

589
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,646
<i>as a three-hour ride
on the school bus.</i>

590
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,982
<i>And just as noisy and crowded.</i>

591
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,194
<i>But after what we'd just faced,
no one made a sound</i>

592
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,029
<i>and we just waited
quietly to see</i>

593
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,656
<i>what awful thing
the Herdmans might do next.</i>

594
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,117
This is why they shouldn't
have shown up.

595
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:10,328
Didn't Reverend Hopkins
talk about when Jesus said,

596
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,371
"Suffer the little children
come unto me"?

597
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,416
Yeah, well, Jesus wouldn't have
suffered Herdmans.

598
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,835
- Okay.
- Mum?

599
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,504
Do you need help with anything?

600
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,673
Today, we're going to ignore
everything except blood.

601
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,927
I'm gonna start soon. Now,
go sit down next to Imogene.

602
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,346
Mum!

603
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,016
Your quiet might rub off on her.

604
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,398
Okay, quiet down, everyone.

605
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,611
Good, then.

606
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,071
Okay.

607
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:49,033
Welcome, everyone.
We're glad to see all of you.

608
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,993
<i>That might've been
the biggest lie ever said</i>

609
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,495
<i>right out loud in the church.</i>

610
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:53,871
First, the easy part.

611
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,790
Let's separate
everyone into angels

612
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,334
and shepherds
and guests at the inn.

613
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,670
Who were the shepherds?
Where'd they come from?

614
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,380
- What's an inn?
- It's like a motel

615
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,090
where people go
to spend the night.

616
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,591
What people? Jesus?

617
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,427
Oh, honestly!
Jesus wasn't even born yet!

618
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,263
Mary and Joseph went there.

619
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,181
- Why?
- What happened first?

620
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,518
- Begin at the beginning.
- The very beginning?

621
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,311
<i>That really scared everyone
because the beginning</i>

622
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,063
<i>would be</i> The Book of Genesis,

623
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,857
<i>where it says
"In the beginning."</i>

624
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,068
<i>And if we started there,
we'd be here for years.</i>

625
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,405
Let's start at the beginning
of the Christmas story.

626
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,741
We've all heard it
a million times.

627
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:33,328
I think it's a good idea
for all of us to hear it again.

628
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,373
It's a good reminder
of what Christmas is all about.

629
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,876
"And Joseph also
went up from Galilee,

630
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:42,837
"out of the city of Nazareth
into Judea,

631
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:46,175
"unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem,

632
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,343
"because he was of the house
and lineage of David,

633
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:53,431
"to be taxed with Mary,
his espoused wife,

634
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,391
"being great with child."

635
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,102
- "Great with child"?
- Pregnant, stupid.

636
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,187
Ralph, that's enough.

637
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,522
It's not very nice to say that
Mary was pregnant.

638
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,107
My mother wouldn't want us
talking about that.

639
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,192
<i>It was true.</i>

640
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,818
<i>Mrs Wendelken didn't like</i>

641
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,904
<i>cats having kittens
or birds laying eggs,</i>

642
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:11,032
<i>and she didn't let Alice play
with anyone who had two rabbits.</i>

643
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,117
Will ya shut up?

644
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,243
I wanna hear.

645
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,620
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

646
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,164
<i>The Herdmans were famous
for never sitting still</i>

647
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:20,374
<i>and never paying attention
to anyone,</i>

648
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,835
<i>teachers, parents, police.</i>

649
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:25,296
<i>Yet something about
the Christmas story</i>

650
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,215
<i>had them hanging on every word.</i>

651
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,550
Mary and Joseph
had to go in the stable

652
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:33,221
because there was no room
for them at the inn.

653
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:36,182
My God! Not even for Jesus?

654
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,851
We don't use God's name
that way, Imogene.

655
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:42,438
What's a manger?
Is that like a bed for the baby?

656
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,190
Why would they have
a bed in a barn?

657
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,943
Well, that's the point,
actually, Leroy.

658
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,945
They didn't have
a bed in a barn.

659
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,446
They had to use
whatever was there.

660
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,657
What would you do
if you had a new baby

661
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,200
and no bed to put the baby in?

662
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,827
We put Gladys
in a drawer.

663
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,288
There you go.

664
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,581
Mary put the Baby Jesus

665
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,875
in a stone feeding trough
for animals.

666
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,503
What were the wadded up clothes?

667
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,713
You said she wrapped Him
in wadded-up clothes.

668
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,132
Swaddling clothes.

669
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:13,302
They used to wrap their babies
tightly in a big piece of fabric

670
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,553
so they couldn't move around.

671
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,390
They tied Him up
and put Him in a box?

672
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,891
Where was Child Welfare?

673
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,189
"And, lo, the Angel of the Lord
came upon them

674
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,024
"and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them."

675
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,277
Shazam!

676
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,279
Shazam?

677
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,738
Out of the black night

678
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,242
with horrible vengeance,
the Mighty Marvo!

679
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,245
That's the most
she's ever spoke.

680
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,247
It's a comic book.

681
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,666
Oh.

682
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,584
Well, then, yes.

683
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,086
I think the Angel of the Lord

684
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,255
is kind of like
a comic book hero.

685
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:55,845
"Now, when Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea,

686
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:59,557
"in the days of Herod the King,
behold,

687
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:03,144
"there came Wise Men
from the east to Jerusalem."

688
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:06,355
That's you, Leroy.
Claude, Ollie, pay attention.

689
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,066
Wise how?
They teachers or somethin'?

690
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,027
No, dumbbell,
they're like presidents.

691
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,112
Let's not hit.

692
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,448
But that's close.
They were kings.

693
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,741
Well, it's about time.

694
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:20,369
Maybe someone'll finally tell
that innkeeper where to get off

695
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,247
and get the baby
out of the barn.

696
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,834
"And when they were come
into the house,

697
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,628
"they saw the young child

698
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,379
"with Mary, His mother,

699
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,632
"and fell down
and worshipped Him.

700
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,342
"And when they had
opened their treasures,

701
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:39,889
"they presented unto Him gifts,
gold, frankincense, and myrrh."

702
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,933
Hold on. What's that stuff?

703
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,643
Oils and perfume.

704
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:47,772
Oil? What sort of cheap king
hands out oil?

705
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,650
You'd get better presents
at the firemen's shelter.

706
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:53,486
It was King Herod, actually.

707
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,614
He sent the Wise Men
to find the Baby Jesus.

708
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:59,242
Was it him that sent
the crummy presents?

709
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,993
It was worse than that, actually.

710
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,663
Herod planned on putting
the Baby Jesus to death.

711
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,373
- My God!
- Imogene.

712
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:06,791
Who's playing this Herod, anyway?

713
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,709
We don't show Herod
in our pageant.

714
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,753
- What?
- What?

715
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,588
- Come on!
- No!

716
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,674
You gotta show him getting
beat up in the end.

717
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:15,758
Charlie can be Herod.

718
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,635
- I don't wanna be Herod.
- No!

719
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,220
Somebody oughta get
the innkeeper too.

720
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:22,432
- Gladys, use your angel powers.
- No, honey, I don't think we...

721
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:31,149
All right, that's enough.
That's enough! That's enough.

722
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,360
Okay, okay.

723
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,073
Please, I need you all
to settle down.

724
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,410
- Maybe Jesus can kill Herod.
- Shazam!

725
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,893
- Nice painting, huh?
- I guess.

726
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:11,522
That Mary, she was a tough one.

727
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:12,608
Tough?

728
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,610
Yeah, she went
through quite a lot

729
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:18,530
and overcame big challenges
to bring a child into the world.

730
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,618
Doesn't look tough.

731
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:24,995
Just looks sweet and pretty.

732
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,582
Yeah. In that painting,
I guess, yeah.

733
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:34,254
What do they have the name of
our town above the painting for?

734
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,672
Do you know what Emmanuel means?

735
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:37,758
No.

736
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:40,761
It means "God with us."

737
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,805
That's what Baby Jesus was.

738
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:45,807
And you're...

739
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:50,061
The character
you volunteered to play

740
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:51,563
helped make that happen.

741
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:53,982
Pretty neat.

742
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,277
I guess.

743
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,533
Anyways...

744
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:04,868
look, I...

745
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:11,333
You all asked
a lot of good questions tonight.

746
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,046
And it made me wonder...

747
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:20,174
if maybe you might enjoy
watching the Christmas pageant

748
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:21,343
more than being in it.

749
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,554
You know, you could really

750
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,764
absorb it all,
see all the details.

751
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,141
You know what I mean?

752
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,564
No. I'm gonna do this.

753
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,402
I think my character
should've set fire to that inn.

754
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:40,695
Yeah. Maybe in the play,

755
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,198
you can chase the innkeeper
to the next country.

756
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,202
Imogene...

757
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,663
I really need them to behave.

758
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,456
If you could help me with that,

759
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,000
I can make sure you have
all the dessert you want

760
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,294
when the pageant is over.
What do you think?

761
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:57,671
Heard that before.

762
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:00,966
Imogene, let's go!

763
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,010
Gotta go.

764
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:17,816
Oh!

765
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,986
- What happened to you?
- Herdmans.

766
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,698
They tried to kill me... again.

767
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,658
That's show business, pal.

768
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:35,417
I'm at a loss.

769
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,794
I don't see any bruises.
That's a victory.

770
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:41,797
We didn't even rehearse. She
just told the Christmas story.

771
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,299
The Herdmans had never heard it.

772
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,343
Just suppose you didn't know
anything about it,

773
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:46,802
and somebody told you.

774
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,889
I'd be more confused
about Santa Claus.

775
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,475
What would you think?

776
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,810
Well, the whole thing's
a hospitality nightmare.

777
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,854
Pretty pathetic that
a pregnant woman shows up

778
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,940
and the only room you can find
for her is in the stable.

779
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,816
That's exactly
what the Herdmans said.

780
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,152
I never thought about it before.
It is pathetic.

781
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,196
We hear all about
this warm stable

782
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,616
with animals
and the sweet-smelling hay.

783
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,077
My cousins grew up on a farm.

784
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,370
Nothing sweet about that smell.

785
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:14,205
I have to admit.

786
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:17,708
Deep down, those kids
might just have good instincts.

787
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:20,003
They wanted to burn
Herod alive, Mum.

788
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:22,631
I said, "Deep down."

789
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:26,551
They picked the right villain.
That's something, right?

790
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:29,054
What did happen to Herod?
I don't even know.

791
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,766
Who would be calling at this...

792
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,394
- Mrs Armstrong.
- Mrs Armstrong.

793
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,312
It's the fifth time this hour.

794
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,315
Wendelken told her that you
haven't axed the Herdmans yet.

795
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,402
She needs to know
what's taking so long.

796
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,404
Sweetheart, the smell of this

797
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,740
just reminds me
that you're busy.

798
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:51,702
God...

799
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:55,037
I just have a feeling

800
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:57,124
this is gonna be
a real disaster.

801
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:00,878
You awake, kiddo?

802
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:10,052
How you doin' with all this?

803
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,639
Are we sure Mum can't replace
the Herdmans?

804
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:14,932
I think it's a little late
for that.

805
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:18,520
And it's all my fault, because
I didn't raise my stupid hand.

806
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:22,607
There was a man much
wiser than me that once said,

807
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,484
"You can't add
a single hour to your life

808
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,987
"by being anxious
about anything."

809
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,865
And that includes putting on
a Christmas pageant.

810
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:31,909
He hadn't met the Herdmans.

811
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,453
Actually...

812
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,080
he knows them
better than anyone.

813
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:41,709
Anyway, would you come with me
in the morning to do something?

814
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,045
What kinda something?

815
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,380
Sort of an errand.

816
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,049
I think it'd be good
for you to go.

817
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,134
And the whole family.

818
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,136
Somethin' I want you to see.

819
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,472
Okay.

820
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,266
Get some sleep.

821
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,601
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

822
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,728
Evan. You got it?

823
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:01,813
Yeah.

824
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:08,779
- Thanks, Bob.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

825
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:14,451
- What's all this for?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

826
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,418
I never knew you were
a Secret Santa.

827
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:25,878
Well, it's not exactly a secret.

828
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,713
The Church
Charitable Works Committee

829
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,215
has been doing this for decades.

830
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,802
It's a good way to get out of
our comfort zone and step up.

831
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,345
Plus, I thought you all would be

832
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:36,557
especially interested
in one of my stops.

833
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,775
I think some of your classmates
live here.

834
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:51,070
Really?
This is one of your stops?

835
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,739
You never told me
you visited the Herdmans.

836
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,284
Didn't seem of note
until this year.

837
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,786
- Beth, you wanna come?
- That wouldn't be a good idea.

838
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:00,413
Okay.

839
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:03,917
But we all need to remember
Christmas comes for everyone.

840
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:26,105
- It's the ham man!
- I want some!

841
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,357
- It's ham day!
- Give me some ham! Give it!

842
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:29,567
Ham day!

843
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:31,195
Hey! Hey! Hey!

844
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,613
That ham's for Christmas eatin'

845
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,615
and if any of you
touch it before then,

846
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:38,327
I will invent a torture
just for you!

847
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:43,248
- Is your mum home?
- Not when the sun's up.

848
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:48,085
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's fine. I know how to cook.

849
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:49,171
I'm sure you do.

850
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,885
Well, please let her know
I stopped by.

851
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:56,970
I got the biggest ham
for you guys.

852
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:04,603
Merry Christmas.

853
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,070
Give it to me!
I want the first bite!

854
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,739
Give it to me!
Back off, Imogene!

855
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,908
Get off me, Ralph!

856
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,536
Back up! Back up!

857
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,416
No mum or dad home.

858
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,835
Reverend Hopkins says
they don't know

859
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,461
where their mum is
half the time.

860
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,505
I heard, when Gladys turned two,

861
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,674
Mr Herdman climbed
on a railroad train

862
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,259
and never came back.

863
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,137
- Nobody could blame him.
- All right, Beth, that's enough.

864
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,976
I can't believe I listened
to those women.

865
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:46,854
What's on your mind?

866
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:50,439
What's on my mind is that

867
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,192
Mrs Armstrong
and Mrs Wendelken

868
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:55,445
and everyone else can stuff it.

869
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:57,947
Whoa.

870
00:44:57,948 --> 00:44:59,032
After all,

871
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,160
they raised their hands,
and no one else did.

872
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:04,162
And that's that.

873
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:32,231
Ow! What?

874
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:33,859
How do you get a book
out of the library?

875
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:36,819
Well, you have to have a card.

876
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,529
- Do you have one?
- Yeah.

877
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,615
Give it to me.

878
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:43,284
It doesn't
really work like that.

879
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:44,995
I'll be right with you.

880
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,331
Oh, my.

881
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,250
I don't keep any money here,
if that's what you're after.

882
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,837
This is the library, right?
Where the books are?

883
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,839
We need the one
with Jesus in it.

884
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,424
And His mum.

885
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,719
- And the Wise Men.
- And stupid Herod.

886
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:03,262
It's the one they use in church.

887
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,472
You mean the Bible?

888
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,265
Hi, Mrs Graebner.

889
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:09,018
Imogene and her brothers
would like to get library cards.

890
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,103
Me too!

891
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:12,063
And her sister.

892
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,231
Beth!

893
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:14,315
Oh, phew!

894
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,275
- I thought that...
- Calm down, lady.

895
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,819
We just need to look
some stuff up.

896
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:22,573
Imogene and Ralph are playing
Mary and Joseph in the pageant.

897
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,952
I'm aware. I bought tickets.

898
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,954
Before I found out about it.

899
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,622
They haven't
offered any refunds.

900
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:33,584
And now, you want library cards?

901
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:34,670
You?

902
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:37,589
To check out Bibles?

903
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:42,636
Now I've seen everything.
Herdmans in the library.

904
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,683
There's the Christmas story.

905
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:51,311
Where's the pictures?

906
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:05,533
Some of these words are weird,
but this stuff is gold.

907
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:08,911
- Ralph, go find a Herod book.
- How?

908
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:10,204
I'll show you
the card catalogue.

909
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:12,957
Don't buy anything!

910
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,085
It's not that kind of catalogue.

911
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:21,133
Beth's mum was right.
This Mary is kind of tough.

912
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:28,264
<i>The Herdmans searched through
book after book,</i>

913
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:30,474
<i>looking up every question
that came to mind.</i>

914
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:33,019
<i>My fingers were sliced up
like a turkey sandwich</i>

915
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,314
<i>from all the times I went back
to the card catalogue.</i>

916
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:49,036
- Pictures.
- Pictures in lots of books.

917
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:52,622
<i>I'd had plenty
of homework assignments</i>

918
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,415
<i>where I had to go to the library</i>

919
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,376
<i>but I don't think I was ever
as interested in anything</i>

920
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:59,670
<i>as Imogene
was in the Christmas story.</i>

921
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,297
Do you hear me?

922
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:04,551
The shepherds were just minding
their business, and boom!

923
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,721
Yeah, I get it.
We're Wise Men, though.

924
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:10,598
We just walk up
with a box of junk.

925
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,392
Why are you making us
do all this?

926
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,232
Ollie, what's that film
you like with the whale?

927
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,608
<i>Land Ho!</i>

928
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,610
You think that captain guy
in <i>Land Ho!</i>

929
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:24,403
just made up
how to build a raft?

930
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,696
- No way.
- That's right.

931
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:27,366
He had to read up.

932
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,742
I thought we were
doing this for cake.

933
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,327
It's about the cake, too.

934
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:34,122
But it's also, like,
we get to make a film.

935
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,418
In the films we watch,
the actress gets to...

936
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:43,673
All the actors and actresses
get to be someone else.

937
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:46,843
They get to change who they are
and live a different life.

938
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:49,554
They can get away
from their miserable lives

939
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:51,473
and become someone new.

940
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,559
That's what we get to do.

941
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,144
Yeah.

942
00:48:57,145 --> 00:49:00,064
So I get to be a king.

943
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:02,525
Yeah. On Christmas Eve, you do.

944
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:04,694
No way Gladys can be an angel.

945
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,028
Yes, I can!

946
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:07,447
You can at least try.

947
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:12,369
Great. And I just get to be
some poor guy married to you.

948
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:16,122
He's someone important enough

949
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:17,790
that they wrote about him
in books.

950
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:21,837
And I get to be
a sweet, pretty...

951
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:28,259
Then we can get
all the food they got.

952
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,305
Plus, now I got a book licence!

953
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:34,850
You chokin' over there?

954
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:37,560
I should go home.

955
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,146
Nobody asked you to stay.

956
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,817
Claude likes his licence.

957
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:48,238
<i>That was about as close
to a thank you as I'd ever get.</i>

958
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:54,494
Sorry I'm late.

959
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,079
All right,
let's get into our groups.

960
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,248
Angels, you are...

961
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,128
Oh. Okay, good.
And everyone else...

962
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:08,425
Well... thank you
for being on time.

963
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:11,010
Yes, Claude?

964
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:13,639
- Can we hang Herod?
- No, Claude.

965
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,684
No one's going to die
in this pageant.

966
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,687
We have a lot of work
to do tonight,

967
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:23,857
- so let's get to it.
- Excuse me.

968
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:28,570
Why are they still here?

969
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:31,532
Because they're
in the pageant, Rebecca.

970
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,658
And that's how
it's going to stay.

971
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:34,825
Oh, really?

972
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:36,536
And what would you like
me to tell

973
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:39,539
Mrs Armstrong, Mrs Slocum
and the other mothers?

974
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,748
You can tell them

975
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:43,669
it's going to be the best
Christmas pageant ever.

976
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:46,797
I'm gonna make it work
with the Herdmans.

977
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,550
Places, everyone.

978
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,604
Isn't the Angel of the Lord
supposed to say something?

979
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:04,940
Hey!

980
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:08,484
<i>Yeah, they were still Herdmans</i>

981
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:09,819
<i>and some people</i>

982
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,947
<i>were not going to forget that
for a minute.</i>

983
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:25,711
Go. Go, go.

984
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,671
Get away from the baby!

985
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:31,716
Imogene, the Wise Men
are here to honour Him

986
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:33,843
not harm Him, for heaven's sake.

987
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:36,345
What if we didn't go home
a different way?

988
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:38,556
What if we tell the king
where the baby was?

989
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:41,727
- Old Herod would murder him.
- He would not!

990
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:43,978
<i>I thought about it
later, though,</i>

991
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:46,189
<i>and I decided
that if Herod, a king,</i>

992
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,525
<i>set out to murder Jesus,
a carpenter's baby son,</i>

993
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:52,111
<i>and he did know where he was,
he would do it.</i>

994
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,447
<i>So, Leroy gave us something
to think about.</i>

995
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:55,948
- Stop!
<i>- No Jesus. Ever.</i>

996
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,783
Okay. Let's just take it down
a notch, okay?

997
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,619
Stand up. Stand up.
I can't hear you guys

998
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,037
when you're all talking at once.

999
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:03,748
<i>Alice clearly didn't think
anything from the Herdmans</i>

1000
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:05,041
<i>was worth thinking about.</i>

1001
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:07,168
Is there a way
to make her smile?

1002
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:08,586
No, she doesn't do that.

1003
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:10,797
<i>But at least others
seemed to be trying...</i>

1004
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:13,592
<i>in unexpected ways.</i>

1005
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,895
Okay. Places, everyone!

1006
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,565
Who do I talk to about rewrites?

1007
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,902
I heard about rewrites
in the films.

1008
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:38,283
Okay, God.

1009
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,245
Now it's getting
even more scary.

1010
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,830
So please do something
to help Mum

1011
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:46,166
and save the pageant.

1012
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,210
That's all.

1013
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,254
Amen.

1014
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:55,341
<i>The last rehearsal</i>

1015
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,052
<i>was also the night
before the potluck supper.</i>

1016
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:00,471
<i>So the whole church
was full of kids and parents</i>

1017
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:02,515
<i>and the members
of the Potluck Committee.</i>

1018
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:06,143
<i>Which meant Mrs Slocum had
a chance to do a little spying</i>

1019
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:08,438
<i>to find something
to disapprove of.</i>

1020
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:13,944
Hello, Mrs Slocum.

1021
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:15,737
Hi!

1022
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,322
Sorry about all this.

1023
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:20,825
It's just, with so much to do
this time of year,

1024
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:23,160
the Potluck Committee
decided to come in tonight

1025
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:24,996
to get the food ready.

1026
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:26,414
I hope we won't bother you.

1027
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:27,498
You won't.

1028
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:28,749
We won't even be
near the kitchen.

1029
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,251
You won't even know we're here.

1030
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:31,669
<i>Mum was wrong.</i>

1031
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,423
<i>Everybody knew we were there
before the evening was over.</i>

1032
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:39,594
Okay, everybody,
this will be a dress rehearsal.

1033
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:40,970
Who knows what that means?

1034
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:42,555
- Costumes.
- Dress-up.

1035
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:44,974
Yes, for some of you.

1036
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:47,393
I don't have any kinda costume.

1037
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:51,022
Just wear your dad's bathrobe.
That's what I always do.

1038
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:52,607
My dad doesn't have a bathrobe.

1039
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:54,317
Then what does he wear
around the house?

1040
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,860
His underwear.

1041
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:56,944
All right.

1042
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:59,780
That's okay. This year,
because of the anniversary,

1043
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:02,159
Ladies Aid has helped
with nicer costumes.

1044
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:09,374
Yeah.

1045
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:23,639
You can be sweet.

1046
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,060
Hello, Imogene.

1047
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:31,021
Aren't you supposed to be
in costume?

1048
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:32,689
I will be.

1049
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:34,525
- I'm playing Mary.
- Oh.

1050
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,527
I couldn't tell.

1051
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:40,364
You don't look like any Mary
I've seen before.

1052
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:46,161
Well, gotta go prepare
the potluck dinner.

1053
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:49,039
It's for 500 people.

1054
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:01,217
It makes my eyes glow
in the light.

1055
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:04,095
Now, the main point
of a dress rehearsal

1056
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:05,555
isn't costumes.

1057
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:08,266
It's about getting through
the show without stopping.

1058
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:09,851
- Got it?
- Got it.

1059
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,102
- Got it.
- Okay.

1060
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,063
I'm gonna sit upstairs
in the audience.

1061
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:16,482
Take it away!

1062
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:17,693
Yay!

1063
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,319
Yes.

1064
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:23,365
Big smiles.

1065
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,784
Hang on to the railing.

1066
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,036
That's good.

1067
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:32,040
Oh, good grief.
Everyone, it's showtime!

1068
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:36,127
Imogene. What's wrong?
Where's your costume?

1069
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:37,629
Where's the baby?

1070
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,548
There is no baby.
We're using a doll.

1071
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:41,717
Yeah, I know.

1072
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,510
'Cause you couldn't get
a real one 'cause of me.

1073
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:46,305
- No.
<i>- It was true.</i>

1074
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,307
<i>We had lots of babies
offered in the beginning.</i>

1075
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:52,561
<i>All the way from Eugene Sloper,
who was a promising option,</i>

1076
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:57,648
<i>up to Junior Cottle,
who was almost four.</i>

1077
00:55:57,649 --> 00:55:59,525
<i>His father said
he could scrunch up.</i>

1078
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,861
Heard we need a baby.
I can help.

1079
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:03,905
Really? That's great. Who?

1080
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:05,364
They've always got
two or three babies

1081
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:07,241
in carriages at the supermarket.

1082
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:08,535
I'll just take one.

1083
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:11,829
Imogene, I hope you're kidding.

1084
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,749
You know you can't just walk off
with someone's baby.

1085
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,709
<i>I doubt Imogene did know that.</i>

1086
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,754
<i>She walked off
with everything else.</i>

1087
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:23,424
<i>But when all the parents
heard about the Herdmans,</i>

1088
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,843
<i>they withdrew their babies.</i>

1089
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,101
<i>- We had hope.</i>
- Hello?

1090
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:36,437
<i>Bernice Toole was fostering
a three-month-old.</i>

1091
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,649
No, it doesn't matter
that she's Chinese!

1092
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,817
- Thank you, Bernice!
- Yes!

1093
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,402
<i>But then the baby got adopted</i>

1094
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:46,405
<i>and Bernice said it was too soon
to ask to borrow a kid back.</i>

1095
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:48,242
<i>- So, that was that.</i>
- Where is it?

1096
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,661
I think Beth brought it in
from the car.

1097
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:53,330
Let's go check with her.

1098
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:55,748
<i>Imogene's brothers
had hidden the doll</i>

1099
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:58,084
<i>because they didn't think
it looked like Jesus,</i>

1100
00:56:58,085 --> 00:56:59,293
<i>whatever that meant.</i>

1101
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,964
<i>But after a fruitless search,
we had to start.</i>

1102
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:07,885
<i>- Away in a manger
- O little town of Bethlehem...</i>

1103
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:10,012
<i>- No crib for a bed...
- How still we see...</i>

1104
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:11,264
Stop. Stop.

1105
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:14,643
Back row,
"Away in a manger" comes first.

1106
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,478
I've got the baby.

1107
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,940
Finally. No thanks to you jerks.

1108
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:23,109
Don't touch him!
It's Baby Jesus.

1109
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,611
Now, Imogene, you're not
supposed to say anything.

1110
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:28,698
Then, Wise Men, you're supposed
to quietly leave!

1111
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:32,243
This is important, everyone.
Remember what I said?

1112
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:35,329
Nobody says anything
in our pageant

1113
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,832
except for the Angel of the Lord

1114
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,500
and of course,
the singing choir.

1115
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:41,210
Mary, Joseph, and the others

1116
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:43,921
create a lovely picture
for us to look at

1117
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:46,507
while we think about Christmas
and what it means.

1118
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:47,925
What does it mean?

1119
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,468
I'm starting to forget.

1120
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,513
Okay, let's take it from the...

1121
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,974
Imogene, you can't wear earrings
during the performance.

1122
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,726
You know Mary
didn't wear earrings.

1123
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:59,103
- I have to wear these.
- Why is that?

1124
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:01,731
I got my ears pierced and I
don't want 'em to grow together.

1125
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:03,107
They're not gonna grow together
in an hour and a half.

1126
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,984
Well, I'd better leave 'em in.

1127
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:07,153
- The doctor said that?
- What doctor?

1128
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:09,489
- Who pierced your ears?
- Gladys.

1129
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:13,243
All right.

1130
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:16,579
We'll find a smaller pair
for the pageant.

1131
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,539
Let's take it from the top.
Okay, so...

1132
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,541
I think I ought to tell them
what I named him.

1133
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,835
No. Remember,
Mary doesn't name the baby.

1134
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,421
I told you. I named him!

1135
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:27,590
No. No!
Joseph doesn't name him either.

1136
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:31,010
God sends an angel to tell Mary
what his name should be.

1137
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:32,471
I would've named him Bill.

1138
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:36,599
Wait, Gladys told Mary
what to name her baby?

1139
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,267
No, Gladys is the angel

1140
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:40,144
that comes to the shepherds
and says,

1141
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:41,646
"Unto you a child is born."

1142
00:58:41,647 --> 00:58:44,732
Unto me! Not them. Me.

1143
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,734
I'm the one who had the baby.

1144
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:49,529
It just means
that Jesus is for the world.

1145
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:54,743
Unto all of us a child is born,
even the poor people, like...

1146
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,831
you know, the shepherds
you're playing.

1147
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:03,168
Why didn't they let Mary
name her own baby?

1148
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,087
What'd the angel do,
just walk up and say,

1149
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,673
"Name Him 'Jesus'"?

1150
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:10,258
- Yes.
- That's not right.

1151
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:11,926
The angel says,

1152
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:15,471
"His name shall be called
Wonderful, Counsellor...

1153
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:19,642
"Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
The Prince of Peace."

1154
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:22,061
My God! He'd never get out
of the first grade

1155
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:23,897
if he had to write all that.

1156
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:29,152
I'm so sorry.

1157
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:32,406
I was passing by
and thought I'd take a peek.

1158
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,617
I'd better check
on that applesauce cake.

1159
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,249
Imogene, I told you not to take
the Lord's name in vain.

1160
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,836
How can you be Mary
if you're offending everyone?

1161
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:48,880
I think we need to take a break.

1162
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:51,215
Let's meet back here
in five minutes

1163
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:52,551
and we'll start over.

1164
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,763
I told you
it would be a disaster.

1165
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:03,853
I just want you to know
I'm happy to take over

1166
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:05,314
the part of Mary at any time.

1167
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,192
That's good to know, Alice.

1168
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:12,236
Imogene, can I...

1169
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:13,404
I'm going to the loo,

1170
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,908
and I'm changing out
of this silly costume.

1171
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,959
There she is. Need anything?

1172
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,838
It's kind of... all wrong.

1173
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:32,925
Like,
everything's falling apart.

1174
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,427
I'm not sure it was really
together in the first place.

1175
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,430
Can't we just put Alice
in as Mary?

1176
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:40,723
We can't let
the Herdmans ruin this

1177
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,684
for the church or embarrass you.

1178
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:46,938
I think Imogene's head
is doing a number on her.

1179
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:48,898
Just need
to get through this rehearsal.

1180
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:50,234
We can do this.

1181
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:52,860
Fire!

1182
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,446
What now?

1183
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,115
Why? Why?

1184
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:00,410
Thick smoke
coming from the bathroom!

1185
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,580
Okay. Okay. okay. Everyone,
grab each other's hands.

1186
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,290
Grab your neighbour's
hands and...

1187
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,292
All right, Beth,
lead the chain out.

1188
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:09,961
Everyone, grab your coats.

1189
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:12,213
Alice? Alice!

1190
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:13,673
Beth, honey...

1191
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:15,633
Everyone, come on. Come on.

1192
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:16,927
Are you okay, dear?

1193
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,263
I smelled smoke
when I walked in.

1194
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,057
You smelled smoke
in the bathroom?

1195
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:24,935
Go with your dad.

1196
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:29,647
- Do we know what happened?
- Herdmans happened.

1197
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:31,232
Come on. Come on, angels.

1198
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,068
- Imogene, are you okay?
- Yep.

1199
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,114
Step aside.
Another Herdman fire.

1200
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:39,907
- I'm scared.
- I know, dear. I know. I know.

1201
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:42,118
Herdmans? In church?

1202
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,037
Yep. All of them.

1203
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:46,414
Lord have mercy on us all.

1204
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:49,042
What a train wreck.
Nothing but trouble.

1205
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,721
Beth, I want you to go
and find the Herdmans, okay?

1206
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,848
- Okay. All right.
- Okay, go grab 'em.

1207
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:07,519
Imogene? Imogene?

1208
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:18,196
And you saw Imogene Herdman
in the bathroom?

1209
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,488
She was there.

1210
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:21,365
And it's well-known
those kids smoke.

1211
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:22,950
So that's what happened.

1212
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,244
Mum, I can't find the Herdmans.

1213
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:27,288
Well, they were just here,
weren't they?

1214
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,582
I looked everywhere.
They're gone.

1215
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:32,251
And then Dianna sees
Imogene standing there.

1216
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:34,004
The place is filled with smoke.

1217
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:38,049
Hello? She smokes.
She started the fire.

1218
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,967
This needs to be the last straw.

1219
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:42,554
Let's not jump
to conclusions, Rebecca.

1220
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,556
Wouldn't that be refreshing?

1221
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,059
Her Mary did this!

1222
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,977
And a million
other things, Reverend.

1223
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,812
Would you like to hear?

1224
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:55,150
- What happens now, Mum?
- I honestly don't know.

1225
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:57,528
Now will they call it off?

1226
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,238
They might try.

1227
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:04,075
Grace said the Angel of the Lord
is like a comic book hero.

1228
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,160
Is this what I think it is?
A Herdman thing?

1229
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,120
I heard they talk about
underwear the whole time.

1230
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:10,081
Excuse me. The Herdman children

1231
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:12,166
don't talk about underwear
during rehearsals.

1232
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,251
That was another boy.

1233
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:16,963
Alice says they talked about
Jesus being murdered.

1234
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:18,673
That is in the Bible.

1235
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:20,550
Well, they really
shouldn't be here.

1236
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:21,634
- No.
- I agree.

1237
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:23,261
When there's smoke,
there's fire.

1238
01:03:23,262 --> 01:03:27,224
- As in, literally.
- Okay, okay, everyone. Please.

1239
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:33,479
You're the one who's been doing
all the work, not them.

1240
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,483
If you can tell me
this will be fine, I trust you.

1241
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:40,571
I'm sorry,
I can't tell you that.

1242
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:43,990
Reverend Hopkins,
we found the source.

1243
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,200
Yes, sir?

1244
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:48,661
My applesauce cake!

1245
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:51,289
But I saw the smoke
coming from the bathroom.

1246
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:53,207
That's why I called.

1247
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,959
There was no fire
in the bathroom.

1248
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,005
But while everyone was out here,
the cake burned up.

1249
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:01,632
Thank you, gentlemen.
Go home, everyone.

1250
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,342
We're done here. Okay?

1251
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,888
That is a wrap
on dress rehearsal.

1252
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:11,101
Did I say that right?
"It's a wrap"?

1253
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,438
Yeah, you said it right.

1254
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:18,650
No one even says sorry?

1255
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:22,196
Let's go home.

1256
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:38,253
Hi, sweetheart.

1257
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:40,380
Hey.

1258
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,265
I think you're doing
a great job, Mum.

1259
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:54,019
Thanks, sweetheart.

1260
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:57,773
Although I don't think
anyone else agrees with you.

1261
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:04,112
Probably not.

1262
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:09,701
I just thought
I could do it somehow.

1263
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:12,620
And that it could be
the best one ever,

1264
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:14,248
even with the Herdmans.

1265
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:18,335
Is it still too late
to replace them?

1266
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:20,796
I don't think
that'd be right, honey.

1267
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:24,507
I also don't think it's right

1268
01:05:24,508 --> 01:05:27,135
the way those women talk
about the Herdmans.

1269
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,807
Don't forget.

1270
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,812
The whole point of the story...

1271
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:41,315
is that Jesus
was born for the Herdmans

1272
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,068
as much as He was for us.

1273
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:47,655
We'd be missing
the point of all of it

1274
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:49,282
if I turned them away.

1275
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:50,993
But what if they ruin it
for you?

1276
01:05:53,412 --> 01:05:54,872
They probably will.

1277
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,585
But it's not about me.

1278
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:10,053
You're doing a great job, Mum.

1279
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:16,602
Let's see what happens
tomorrow night first.

1280
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,057
What is it, hon?

1281
01:07:07,736 --> 01:07:08,737
Mum?

1282
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:11,782
I prayed about it,
and I agree with you.

1283
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:15,244
You have to stick
with the Herdmans.

1284
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:17,746
Thanks, honey.

1285
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:21,874
But I can't get a call through
to the Herdman house.

1286
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,544
Is it disconnected?

1287
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:25,629
I don't think so.

1288
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:29,173
I hope they didn't hear what
people were saying about them.

1289
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:32,094
Wait. Did Imogene quit?

1290
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,222
- I don't know.
- How could she quit?

1291
01:07:35,848 --> 01:07:38,432
- She can't do that to you!
- It'll be all right, Beth.

1292
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:41,353
Alice knows how to play Mary.
It'll be fine.

1293
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:45,398
Or, well, you know,
it'll be what it's always been.

1294
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:47,150
It can't be
what it's always been!

1295
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,113
Beth, where are you going?

1296
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:53,406
Beth?

1297
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,783
<i>Explain this one to me.</i>

1298
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:58,077
<i>Before, the only way
for the pageant to work</i>

1299
01:07:58,078 --> 01:07:59,662
<i>was without the Herdmans.</i>

1300
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:02,373
<i>Now, the only way for it to work
was with them.</i>

1301
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:05,209
<i>Maybe my mum didn't lead
committees or run a business</i>

1302
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:07,420
<i>or wear a power dress
while shopping</i>

1303
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:10,590
<i>but she did the right thing
when no one else would.</i>

1304
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:12,758
<i>So now, I had to.</i>

1305
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:17,055
<i>And that meant facing
Imogene Herdman alone.</i>

1306
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:41,955
Hi, Gladys.

1307
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,376
I need to talk to Imogene.

1308
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:53,091
Okay, then.

1309
01:08:57,386 --> 01:08:58,638
What do you want?

1310
01:08:58,639 --> 01:08:59,972
<i>After all that riding,</i>

1311
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:01,933
<i>you'd think I'd have
figured out what to say.</i>

1312
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,143
<i>There were a million things
running through my head.</i>

1313
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:07,103
<i>But when she opened the door,
all I could get out was...</i>

1314
01:09:07,104 --> 01:09:08,357
Hey.

1315
01:09:09,858 --> 01:09:10,859
Wait!

1316
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:15,862
- Why'd you leave last night?
- It was cold out.

1317
01:09:15,863 --> 01:09:18,115
They were trying to figure out
what happened.

1318
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:21,077
Bunch of idiots standin' around,
scratchin' their bums.

1319
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:23,579
They figured out we did it,
then started lookin'.

1320
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,871
No, no, they burned a cake.

1321
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:27,250
Doesn't matter what happened.
They knew it was me.

1322
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:29,836
They think you smoke cigars.
They just assumed...

1323
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,295
Of course they did.

1324
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:34,840
Well, were you smoking a cigar?

1325
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:36,092
Yes.

1326
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:37,636
Oh.

1327
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:41,597
Well, you shouldn't smoke.

1328
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:43,809
- Got it. Bye.
- Wait!

1329
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:47,269
- Are you gonna do the pageant?
- Nope.

1330
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,855
- What?
- I'm not doin' it.

1331
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:51,190
But I thought you wanted
to be someone else.

1332
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,525
Like in a film.

1333
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:54,778
Things changed. Bye.

1334
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,283
- Do you mind?
- Yes. I mind. I mind a lot!

1335
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:04,662
My mother stood up for you.
She fought for you.

1336
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:07,707
The town practically
hates her for it.

1337
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:11,586
But she did it anyway.
Because she cares about you.

1338
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:12,670
What do you care?

1339
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:15,465
You didn't want me
in the pageant anyway.

1340
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,009
Right?

1341
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:20,095
- Things changed.
- Really?

1342
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,932
My mum needs you to be Mary.

1343
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:26,852
Okay?

1344
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:29,813
Yes, I told her
not to let you do it.

1345
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,150
She gave you a chance.

1346
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:35,985
People are coming from all over

1347
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:37,904
and it's too late
to change all the parts

1348
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:40,489
and hope it's just the same old,
boring pageant...

1349
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,574
I can't do it!

1350
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,492
I'll never be the girl
in the painting.

1351
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:45,661
But we can't have
a painting on stage.

1352
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:46,996
We need a real person.

1353
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:50,958
- Alice will do it.
- Right. "Alice'll do it."

1354
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:53,002
Everyone loves Mary

1355
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:55,838
because she's sweet
and she's pretty.

1356
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:57,299
And I'll never be...

1357
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:04,973
You don't think you can be sweet
because you're so tough.

1358
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,684
Toughest kid
in the world, right?

1359
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:13,065
But if you quit the pageant,
you won't be sweet or tough.

1360
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:16,275
Besides, Mary,

1361
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:18,195
the real Mary,

1362
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:21,155
didn't care
what anyone thought of her

1363
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:24,076
and did the hard thing,
even though it was scary.

1364
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:29,498
You're kinda
like that, actually.

1365
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,461
Please show up.

1366
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:37,589
For my mum?

1367
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:43,011
Even if it's just to make
everyone angry?

1368
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:49,059
I'm sorry. I'm a Herdman.
I'm just not her.

1369
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:04,491
At least our candles
will look perfect.

1370
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:07,870
Well...

1371
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:09,913
we're here.

1372
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:14,585
You made it. Be proud of that.

1373
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:16,503
Right, Beth?

1374
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:20,299
We've never once
run through the whole thing.

1375
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:22,884
I don't know
what's gonna happen tonight.

1376
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:24,135
If the Herdmans show up,

1377
01:12:24,136 --> 01:12:26,137
it might be the first
Christmas pageant in history

1378
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,347
where Joseph and the Wise Men
get in a fight

1379
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:31,143
and Mary lights a cigar
and hightails it with the baby.

1380
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,687
- Do you mind?
- No.

1381
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:38,066
- Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1382
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:40,026
He doesn't mean it.

1383
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,694
It's what they say
in the theatre.

1384
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:44,198
Mrs Armstrong wrote about it
in her book of notes.

1385
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:46,949
Hey, look at you.

1386
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,243
Too tight.

1387
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:52,164
You look great.
You can go backstage.

1388
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:57,711
Don't think they're coming.

1389
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:08,096
I think I need Alice.

1390
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,060
Understood.

1391
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,145
Alice?

1392
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:21,068
You may need to play
Mary tonight.

1393
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,425
- All right, here we go.
- Yeah.

1394
01:13:46,426 --> 01:13:48,302
Shirley's wing poked me.

1395
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:50,763
It's okay, sweetheart. When
she turns around, just duck.

1396
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:51,932
Okay.

1397
01:13:58,438 --> 01:14:00,941
Mary and Joseph
are dressed and ready to go.

1398
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:03,652
That's great, Alice.

1399
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:36,852
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

1400
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:44,026
<i>For 75 years,</i>

1401
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:48,822
<i>the pageant
has been an opportunity</i>

1402
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:54,369
<i>to remind us who Christmas
is supposed to be about.</i>

1403
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:57,748
<i>This year,</i>

1404
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,336
<i>it's turned out a little
different than we planned.</i>

1405
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:06,548
<i>Which, I'll admit,
is a first for this pageant.</i>

1406
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:13,680
<i>Honestly...</i>

1407
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,646
<i>...so much has happened
to get us here...</i>

1408
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:25,859
<i>...that I don't quite know
what's gonna happen tonight.</i>

1409
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:30,739
<i>But maybe
that's not a bad thing.</i>

1410
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:35,077
<i>Because Mary and Joseph
weren't so sure either.</i>

1411
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:40,541
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

1412
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:44,086
<i>And Merry Christmas.</i>

1413
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,479
- Are you okay?
- I have no idea.

1414
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:04,773
Okay.

1415
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:27,795
<i>Away in a manger</i>

1416
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:31,591
<i>No crib for a bed</i>

1417
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:35,469
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

1418
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,806
<i>Laid down His sweet head</i>

1419
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:40,850
<i>The stars in the bright sky...</i>

1420
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:42,186
What is she doing?

1421
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,228
<i>Looked down where He lay...</i>

1422
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:46,105
What's wrong?

1423
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:49,775
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

1424
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:53,696
<i>Asleep on the hay</i>

1425
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:57,825
<i>The cattle are lowing</i>

1426
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:01,162
<i>The Baby awakes</i>

1427
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:04,875
<i>But little Lord Jesus...</i>

1428
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:16,845
What is she wearing?

1429
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:19,096
She brought something from home.

1430
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:21,098
She said
if she was going to do this,

1431
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:23,434
she was gonna look
like the real Mary.

1432
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:25,312
They look like refugees.

1433
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:28,565
Yeah.

1434
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,276
They do.

1435
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:37,156
<i>"In the days of Caesar Augustus,</i>

1436
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:38,783
<i>"a decree went out</i>

1437
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:41,202
<i>"that all the world
should be taxed</i>

1438
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:44,623
<i>"and Joseph went to Bethlehem
with Mary, his wife..."</i>

1439
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:58,135
<i>O little town of Bethlehem</i>

1440
01:17:58,136 --> 01:18:02,974
<i>How still we see thee lie</i>

1441
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:07,895
<i>Above thy deep
and dreamless sleep</i>

1442
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:12,692
<i>The silent stars go by</i>

1443
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:17,154
<i>Yet in thy dark streets shineth</i>

1444
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:21,409
<i>The everlasting light...</i>

1445
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,035
Why are you burpin' the doll?

1446
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:25,747
It's how I helped Gladys
when she was a baby.

1447
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,126
<i>Are met in thee tonight...</i>

1448
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:32,086
I never!

1449
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:34,797
Burping the Baby Jesus
as if He had colic.

1450
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,883
That certainly
wasn't in the programme.

1451
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:38,301
Well, I like it.

1452
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:40,720
You think the Baby Jesus
didn't need to burp?

1453
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:41,805
He's...

1454
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:43,764
<i>"And in that region,</i>

1455
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:45,683
<i>"there were shepherds
in the field,</i>

1456
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:48,604
<i>"keeping watch
over their flocks by night."</i>

1457
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:58,279
<i>While shepherds watched
their flocks by night</i>

1458
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:03,242
<i>All seated on the ground</i>

1459
01:19:03,243 --> 01:19:08,372
<i>The Angel of the Lord came down</i>

1460
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:13,545
<i>And glory shone around</i>

<i>"And an Angel of the Lord
appeared to them."</i>

1462
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:30,687
<i>And an Angel of the Lord
appeared to them.</i>

1463
01:19:38,654 --> 01:19:39,738
Hey!

1464
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:45,410
Unto you a child is born!

1465
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:52,417
What are you waiting for?
Go see the baby!

1466
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:14,189
Hurry up!

1467
01:20:36,378 --> 01:20:40,840
<i>We three kings of orient are</i>

1468
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:44,595
<i>Bearing gifts we traverse afar</i>

1469
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:47,763
<i>Field and fountain</i>

1470
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:49,515
<i>Moor and mountain...</i>

1471
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,434
I knew this would happen.

1472
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:54,605
They don't have the frankincense
or the myrrh or the gold.

1473
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:56,731
<i>They brought something different</i>

1474
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:58,942
<i>and I knew right away
where it came from.</i>

1475
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:01,987
They probably
don't even like ham.

1476
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:05,741
Yes, they do. They love ham.

1477
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,163
My ham's in the play.

1478
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,958
<i>"And when Jesus was born,</i>

1479
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:19,712
<i>"there came Wise Men
from the east to worship Him,</i>

1480
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:23,926
<i>"bringing gifts of gold
and frankincense and myrrh."</i>

1481
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,896
They're supposed to leave.
They're ruining the whole thing.

1482
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,105
It makes perfect sense

1483
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:40,316
for the Wise Men
to sit down and rest.

1484
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:42,109
They came a long way.

1485
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,570
You expect them
to hand over the ham and leave?

1486
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:46,406
They didn't bring ham!

1487
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:56,624
<i>What Child is this who
laid to rest</i>

1488
01:21:56,625 --> 01:22:01,462
<i>On Mary's lap, is sleeping?</i>

1489
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:03,589
<i>Whom angels...</i>

1490
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:06,300
<i>As for ruining the whole thing,</i>

1491
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:07,385
<i>it seemed to me</i>

1492
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:10,848
<i>that the Herdmans had improved
the pageant, a lot.</i>

1493
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:14,809
<i>Just by doing
what came naturally.</i>

1494
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:17,395
<i>Like burping the baby,
for instance.</i>

1495
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:19,856
<i>Or thinking a ham
would make a better present</i>

1496
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:21,900
<i>than a lot of perfume or oil.</i>

1497
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,746
<i>Usually by the time
we got to</i> Silent Night,

1498
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:37,707
<i>I was fed up
with the whole thing,</i>

1499
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,710
<i>couldn't wait for it to be over.</i>

1500
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:43,088
<i>But I didn't feel
that way this time.</i>

1501
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:49,552
<i>I almost wished
for the pageant to go on</i>

1502
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:51,053
<i>with the Herdmans in charge,</i>

1503
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:53,307
<i>just to see what else they'd do.</i>

1504
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:36,350
<i>I realised I'd never really
seen the Nativity before.</i>

1505
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:41,605
<i>But Imogene was helping me
see it more clearly than ever.</i>

1506
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:57,286
<i>Silent night</i>

1507
01:23:57,287 --> 01:24:00,456
<i>Holy night</i>

1508
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:04,210
<i>All is calm</i>

1509
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:07,422
<i>All is bright</i>

1510
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:12,844
<i>Round yon Virgin
Mother and Child...</i>

1511
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:14,680
<i>And then it happened.</i>

1512
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:17,765
<i>Everyone had been waiting
all this time</i>

1513
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:21,435
<i>for the Herdmans to do something
absolutely unexpected.</i>

1514
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:23,187
<i>And sure enough...</i>

1515
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:24,273
Look.

1516
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:30,487
She's crying.

1517
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:33,574
Mary is crying.

1518
01:24:39,997 --> 01:24:41,539
<i>In that moment...</i>

1519
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:45,168
<i>Imogene Herdman experienced
the real Christmas story</i>

1520
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:46,712
<i>for the very first time.</i>

1521
01:24:50,841 --> 01:24:52,885
<i>And so we did, too.</i>

1522
01:26:00,786 --> 01:26:03,956
<i>Lord at thy birth</i>

1523
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:09,962
<i>Well...</i>

1524
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:13,841
<i>it was the best
Christmas pageant ever.</i>

1525
01:26:38,115 --> 01:26:39,116
Take a bow.

1526
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:44,288
Bow. They're clapping for you.

1527
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:12,941
Thank you.

1528
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:50,478
<i>Everyone agreed
it was the best ever,</i>

1529
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:53,190
<i>but nobody seemed to know
why exactly.</i>

1530
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:55,525
<i>One thing I did know,</i>

1531
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:56,692
<i>because of my mum</i>

1532
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,986
<i>and her understanding
of the Christmas story,</i>

1533
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:02,407
<i>the Herdmans finally got
what they needed most all along.</i>

1534
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,409
<i>A community.</i>

1535
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,829
<i>But they gave us something
we needed all along, too.</i>

1536
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:10,957
<i>For years, I thought about
the wonder of Christmas</i>

1537
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:14,210
<i>and the mystery of Jesus's birth
and never really understood it.</i>

1538
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:18,298
<i>But now, it didn't seem
so mysterious after all.</i>

1539
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,009
<i>When Imogene asked me
what the pageant was about,</i>

1540
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,178
<i>I told her it was about Jesus.</i>

1541
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,473
<i>But that was just part of it.</i>

1542
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:29,100
<i>It was about a new baby</i>

1543
01:28:29,101 --> 01:28:31,310
<i>and His dirt-poor
mother and father</i>

1544
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:33,145
<i>who were in a lot of trouble.</i>

1545
01:28:33,146 --> 01:28:36,232
<i>No money, no place to go,
no doctor,</i>

1546
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:38,402
<i>nobody they knew, no respect.</i>

1547
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:43,407
<i>But they were the ones God chose
to help change the world.</i>

1548
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:49,538
<i>As for Imogene,</i>

1549
01:28:50,414 --> 01:28:53,625
<i>Christmas seemed
to come over her all at once.</i>

1550
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:22,738
Thanks for coming back.

1551
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:24,656
You made me.

1552
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,035
I don't think so.

1553
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:33,332
Here's your ham. Great prop.

1554
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:37,544
It wasn't a prop.
It was a gift from the boys.

1555
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:43,133
And...

1556
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:45,427
I have something else.

1557
01:29:47,387 --> 01:29:49,389
I figured it was time
to return this.

1558
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:00,192
Thanks.

1559
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:05,030
So, now that
the pageant is over,

1560
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:08,909
you probably don't plan
on coming here again.

1561
01:30:10,202 --> 01:30:12,663
But maybe you could come
next week?

1562
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:17,167
As long as there's snacks.

1563
01:30:23,549 --> 01:30:25,050
It's exactly right.

1564
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:27,177
Right?

1565
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:29,096
What's that?

1566
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:31,098
The painting.

1567
01:30:32,891 --> 01:30:35,102
<i>What did she mean
"exactly right"?</i>

1568
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:37,104
<i>I don't know.</i>

1569
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:46,446
I think Imogene liked the idea
of the Mary in the painting.

1570
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:49,825
All pure-looking.

1571
01:30:50,659 --> 01:30:52,578
As if she never
did anything else

1572
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:55,914
except have Jesus
on Christmas Eve.

1573
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:00,252
Imogene once told me,

1574
01:31:01,253 --> 01:31:03,005
"I'm not her."

1575
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:06,633
But to me...

1576
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:11,638
Mary will always
look like Imogene Herdman.

1577
01:31:15,017 --> 01:31:16,226
That's why...

1578
01:31:17,644 --> 01:31:21,106
we still use this blanket
even after all these years.

1579
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:29,907
So, everyone,

1580
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:31,991
now that you know

1581
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:35,204
why the pageant
is so important to us...

1582
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:40,042
I don't know, would anybody
like to play a part?

1583
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:44,086
Wow, that is so many hands!

1584
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:45,213
Thankfully,

1585
01:31:45,214 --> 01:31:49,635
we have a lot of parts
and there are no small parts.

1586
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:53,471
Okay, so, parents, if you wanna,

1587
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,015
take everybody down
to the sanctuary,

1588
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:57,558
we'll get everybody sorted.

1589
01:31:57,559 --> 01:31:58,935
We'll assign you roles

1590
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:01,980
and we will have
our very first rehearsal.

1591
01:32:02,523 --> 01:32:03,857
Okay, get out of here.

1592
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:51,738
Can I try those?

1593
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:02,124
Well, those were Gladys' wings.

1594
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:04,876
She won't let anyone else
wear them.

1595
01:33:04,877 --> 01:33:10,257
But if you run on downstairs,
we'll find you a whole new set.

1596
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:30,777
"Hey. Unto you a child is born."
