1
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,293
You done
with your breakfast?

2
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,427
Yeah.

3
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,528
Let's do this thing.

4
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,873
I'll see you later.
Okay.

5
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,242
Drive safe.
Bye, Mom.

6
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,242
- You got your lunch?
- Yeah.

7
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,495
Mrs. Peterson?

8
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,104
Yes. Can I, um,
help you?

9
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,503
My name is David,
Mrs. Peterson.

10
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,805
I, uh...

11
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,778
I knew your son Caleb.

12
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,145
We trained together
and served together

13
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,844
and, uh, well, we came
to be good friends.

14
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,719
Oh, um...

15
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,816
Would you like
to come inside?

16
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,126
Thank you, ma'am.

17
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,298
So, are you sure
I can't get you anything?

18
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,573
Mmm-hmm. Maybe just some
water would be nice.

19
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,746
How did you get here?

20
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,383
I ran.

21
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,979
I needed the exercise.

22
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,090
From the bus station,
I mean, in town.

23
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,222
You ran that whole way?

24
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,489
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,255
Here you go.

26
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,834
All right.
Thank you, ma'am.

27
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,248
When did you get out?

28
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,441
Well, I was discharged
on Wednesday

29
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,713
and I came straight here
from Fort Kennilworth.

30
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,585
You came straight
here first thing?

31
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:09,219
Yeah. I wanted to come by sooner,
but I couldn't get leave.

32
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,884
Why?

33
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,338
Well, I was discharged
'cause I was wounded.

34
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,798
I was in a military
hospital for a bit,

35
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,197
so it wasn't really
the kind of thing

36
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,736
you could get leave from.

37
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,565
Ah, but don't worry, it was just
a bit of shrapnel in my back.

38
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,902
I'm right as rain now.

39
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,603
No, I meant, urn, why did
you come here first thing?

40
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,613
Ah, well, like I said, me and
your son Caleb, we were, uh...

41
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,641
We were pretty close.

42
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,050
I was with him
when he died.

43
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,254
Really?
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:46,793
And one of the things he asked
was for me to check on you all.

45
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,291
You and your whole
family here. Uh...

46
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,499
He wanted me to tell you
that he loved you.

47
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,567
He specifically wanted me
to tell each one of you that

48
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,734
he loved you and

49
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,270
he was thinking of you guys
up until the end.

50
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,840
I said I'd do that
and so, here I am.

51
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,951
Would you
excuse me, please?

52
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,451
That's me.

53
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,393
Right there.

54
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,495
Well, I'll be...

55
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,975
I remember that day.

56
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,812
It wasn't my intention
to upset you, ma'am.

57
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,383
I probably should
have called first,

58
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,717
but I don't own
a cell phone yet

59
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,314
and, um, I guess,
I just wasn't thinking.

60
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,555
I'm going to be
on my way now,

61
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,357
but I'd like it if
we could exchange e-mails...

62
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,488
Wait. No.

63
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,230
Anna, Caleb's sister,
she works nights,

64
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,392
and she sleeps late.

65
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,492
And I know she would
love to meet you.

66
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,164
Would you stay
a little while longer?

67
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,240
Oh, you're not just saying
that to be polite now?

68
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,331
'Cause you don't need to be.

69
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,345
No, I'm not.
Please, stay. It's...

70
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,677
It's nice having you here

71
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,207
and I would love to hear
more about you and Caleb.

72
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,411
Well, all right.

73
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,921
...Caleb and me,
we figure that sounds, uh,

74
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,534
more like a challenge
than anything else.

75
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,602
So, uh, that night
after he falls asleep,

76
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,648
we kind of crept over to his
cot with a tube of superglue.

77
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,807
Oh, no!

78
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,780
We didn't do anything
too bad to him,

79
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,717
though, uh, we could have, you know.

80
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,921
Hey, there you are.
Anna, this is David.

81
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,786
Very nice to meet you.

82
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,728
Caleb told me
a lot about you.

83
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,399
David just got
discharged this week.

84
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,128
He was a friend
of your brother's.

85
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,929
You knew Caleb?

86
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,566
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,400
"Yes, ma'am"

88
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,065
Okay.

89
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,237
So, um,
where are you staying?

90
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,739
Well, I noticed a motel off the
highway on the way here...

91
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,843
No, no, no, no. You will stay
with us while you're here.

92
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,978
Oh, no.
I couldn't put you all out.

93
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,455
Nonsense. We would love to have you.
We have plenty of room.

94
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,788
In fact, you can
stay in Caleb's old room.

95
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,790
We insist.

96
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,763
Well, I won't argue.

97
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,927
Just for tonight, though.

98
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,033
Well, I've got to
head to the diner.

99
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,971
It was really
great meeting you.

100
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,136
Likewise.
Very nice meeting you.

101
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,676
I guess
I'll see you later.
Bye.

102
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,834
Um...

103
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,005
Can I show you to your room?

104
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,337
Great.

105
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,678
There are clean towels
in the bathroom

106
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,153
if you'd like
to freshen up.

107
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,853
Mrs. Peterson, are you sure you're
comfortable with me staying in here?

108
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,357
Of course.

109
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,963
I mean, it's not like
it's going to any use.

110
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,296
I think it could be
a good thing for us.

111
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,009
Uh...

112
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,372
I'm gonna go and let
you get settled in.

113
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,378
If you need anything,
just holler.

114
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,477
Oh, my God!

115
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,079
Fucking pussy.

116
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,643
Oh, my God!

117
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,144
Oh.

118
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,656
Oh, it's okay,
little baby, don't cry.
Aw.

119
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,910
Hey, there.

120
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,321
How was your day?

121
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,577
It was good.

122
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,647
Great.

123
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,325
...giving him a chance,
it's that I don't like the idea of

124
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,628
some random guy off the
street being invited to stay

125
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,432
in my house with my family.

126
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,608
So, you knew my brother?

127
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,550
I did, pretty well, yeah.

128
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,821
He wanted me to tell you
that he loved you.

129
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,993
Oh. Thanks.

130
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,158
Even though he says
he was friends with Caleb.

131
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,166
He's in the photograph
of Caleb's squad.

132
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,360
You saw the photograph.

133
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,491
He was not a stranger.
You know what?

134
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,696
What if he has the PTSD

135
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,998
or whatever it's called?

136
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,471
Some of these guys come back with
mental health problems, Laura.

137
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,872
Did you take
that into account?

138
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,637
What if Caleb had
come back different?

139
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,302
Did you take
that into account?

140
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,984
Wow, that is...
Hmm...

141
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,717
Your parents are
fighting about me.

142
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,982
Yeah. They argue a lot.

143
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,021
Huh.

144
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,223
You look like
you got hit or something.

145
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,271
Yeah, yeah, I got hit with
a football in gym class.

146
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,366
Yeah, that can happen.

147
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,339
Yeah.

148
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,082
No, no, you're right,
you're right. Let's talk to him.

149
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,077
Hi, great, okay.

150
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,751
David, we're very happy
to have you here.

151
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,585
I'm gonna have
a beer before dinner.
Can I offer you one?

152
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,250
Well, no, thank you.
No. Okay. Suit yourself.

153
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,022
And dinner is gonna
be ready in an hour.

154
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,290
So, Luke, why don't you
do some homework.

155
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,389
<i>Okay-</i>

156
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,696
David, can I get
you anything?

157
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,067
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Peterson, I'm fine.

158
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,967
<i>Yeah, hit this.</i>

159
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,208
Look out... Shit.

160
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,608
No...

161
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,153
Now? No, I'm good,
but thank you.

162
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,627
So, that friend of your
brother's,
is he sticking around?

163
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,720
I don't know.
I hope not.

164
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,659
Why? You said
you liked him.

165
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,625
I said he seemed nice.
That's not the same thing.

166
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,397
Oh, okay.

167
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,239
Why don't you like him?

168
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,500
I don't not like him.

169
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:20,972
It's just, I...

170
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,078
I mean, you kind
of knew Caleb.

171
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,248
We've all...

172
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,685
I just know Mom and Dad
have been trying to move on

173
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,825
and it's not like they don't have
enough reminders in this town.

174
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,019
Yeah.

175
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,258
I don't know, that seems
pretty normal to me.

176
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,769
You know, like, your kid dies.
That's hard.

177
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,267
Yeah.

178
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,751
Guess we just don't need
a walking, breathing reminder

179
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,780
of him right now,
you know?

180
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,111
Yeah. Totally.

181
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,615
I've got to go.

182
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,353
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

183
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,622
Stop. I can't...
What!

184
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,844
No, no.
Let's just hang out,
like, a little bit longer.

185
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,158
I can't.
Just a little bit longer.

186
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,495
I can't. Mmm-mmm.
I have to go.

187
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,365
You don't have to go.
Yes, I do.

188
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,228
But I'm sure
we can find some time
at Kristen's tomorrow, okay?

189
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,829
Hmm.

190
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,312
Stop, I have to go.

191
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,974
The sine is the angle
of the ship's anchor cable,

192
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,551
so the cable is
the hypotenuse,

193
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,847
and what we need
to find out

194
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,855
is the distance down
to the ocean bottom,

195
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,925
so that's the opposite.
Do you see?

196
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,524
Not really.

197
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,600
So, you're kind
of smart, huh?

198
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,505
I guess so.

199
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,873
Hey, how was work?

200
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,070
Good. Not too busy.

201
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,841
David, sure I can't
get you a beer?

202
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,278
You know, I will have one.
Thank you.

203
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,183
- I'll take one, too.
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.

204
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,551
I'm 21 in a month.

205
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,954
You can have all the
beer you want then,

206
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,047
assuming you buy it yourself.

207
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,261
Are you helping him
with his homework?

208
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,360
Well, not exactly.

209
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,574
Hey, don't go.
Stick around,
be sociable.

210
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,037
Ugh, I'm kind of tired.
I think I'm gonna lay down.

211
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,470
Okay. Suit yourself.

212
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,812
But Allan,
his name's Allan,

213
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,380
he's only been
there for, what,

214
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,051
like, four years,
but he's got a degree,

215
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:52,789
so, boom, suddenly he's
regional manager and I'm not.

216
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,489
And that's okay.
I mean, it's okay.

217
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,731
But I know Laura,
I know she's worried.

218
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,932
She wonders if I'm ever,

219
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,339
ever going to
make any money.

220
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,638
Your wife seems
to respect you, sir.

221
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,973
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

222
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,248
It is what it is,
you know.

223
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,585
What about you, though?
What about you?
What are your plans?

224
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,618
Figured I'd get on
a bus tomorrow,

225
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,960
head down to Florida
or something

226
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,154
and start looking
for work.

227
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,422
I've done construction
work before.

228
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,259
So, I'm sure
I'll find something.

229
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,356
No, no, no, no, no.
That's crazy.

230
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,199
That's crazy.
You don't know
where you're going.

231
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,826
Stay here for
a couple more days.

232
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,700
No. No, I can't.

233
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,838
I couldn't impose on your
hospitality any longer, sir.

234
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,170
You're not...
Impose on our...

235
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,006
And "sir"?
You're calling me "sir" now?

236
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,205
You gotta stop with the "sir,"
my name's Spencer.

237
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,282
You gotta call me Spencer,
for God sakes.

238
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,442
Okay-
Okay-

239
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,780
All right.
Okay.

240
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,615
So you're
sticking around, right?

241
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,956
You stick around
at least till you know
where you're going.

242
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,651
Well,
maybe just a couple
more days, all right.

243
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,220
Cool, excellent.
It's a deal.

244
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,534
Let's have a couple more
of these to celebrate,

245
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,536
and then I've got
to get off to bed.

246
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,298
God, you can put
your liquor away.

247
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,340
I guess so.

248
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,242
I'm tired.
Are you tired?

249
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,474
No, I don't need
much sleep.

250
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,216
What are you doing here?

251
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,782
I told your mom
I could pick you up
from school today.

252
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:00,917
That cool?

253
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,117
Yeah.

254
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,589
Don't you, like,
have any friends?

255
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,061
I have lots of friends.

256
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,270
Just not, like, here.
Like, online.

257
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,476
Oh.

258
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,222
What are you waiting for?

259
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,891
I want you to show me
who hit you yesterday.

260
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,897
I got hit with a football.

261
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,595
Yeah.

262
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,272
What are you going to do?

263
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,597
Nothing bad.

264
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,104
Over there.

265
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,411
All of them?

266
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,917
Well, most of them
give me a hard time.

267
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,650
Those two guys,
Mike and Ian,
are the worst.

268
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,623
Those guys are
real assholes.

269
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,596
Can we go now?

270
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,492
Yes.

271
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,276
What are you doing?

272
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,345
They're going to a bar?

273
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,318
Uh, yeah,

274
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,661
this place will
serve you if you're on
the football team.

275
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,628
Well, I could use a drink.

276
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,289
How about you?

277
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,990
No.

278
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,686
You coming?

279
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,548
No.

280
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,019
Well, I'll be inside
if you change your mind.

281
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,950
What the fuck?

282
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
Hey, Luke.

283
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,093
Maybe it's his
boyfriend or something?

284
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,301
Excuse me.

285
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,042
I'm gonna need
to see some ID.

286
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,912
You ID all of them?

287
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,322
What can I get you?

288
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,660
Do you know how
to make a fireball?

289
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,063
Cinnamon schnapps
and Tabasco sauce.

290
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,762
That's my drink of choice.
Let me get one of those.

291
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,765
A Coke here
for my brother,

292
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,634
and I can't help
but notice

293
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,073
that those ladies over there
are drinking cheap beer.

294
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,303
That seems
like a shame to me.

295
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,743
I'd like to buy each one
of them a blowjob shot.

296
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,114
Are you serious?
I am, yes.

297
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,527
Do you wanna buy
anything for their fellas?

298
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,459
Do I look like I'd like to buy
something for their fellas?

299
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,625
Might be the polite
thing to do.

300
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,263
Sure, okay, fine.

301
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,264
I'm gonna get each one of
those guys a cosmopolitan.

302
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,606
Mister, I don't know
what you're going for,

303
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,369
but, uh,
I was thinking a beer.

304
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,510
No. Blowjob shots
for the ladies,

305
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,671
and a cosmopolitan
for each of the guys.

306
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,310
You keep
the change on that.

307
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,140
You got it.

308
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,522
Are you, like, rich?

309
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,553
Cash is easy to get.

310
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,126
He doesn't need to
be in costume

311
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,984
to make an ass out of himself.

312
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,665
Here's your Coke,
here's your fireball.

313
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,168
Got their shots and
cosmos coming right up.

314
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,301
Thank you.

315
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,143
You want to try it?

316
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,646
Sure.

317
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,685
God!

318
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,062
It's like hot peppers.

319
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,758
Ugh, you drink that?

320
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:13,996
Yep.

321
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:17,997
Ah!

322
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,707
How do you do that?

323
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,677
You get used to it.

324
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,590
From that
table over there.

325
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:43,860
That fucking guy?

326
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,026
They look annoyed.

327
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,527
Yep.

328
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,971
Thanks for the drink.

329
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,471
You're welcome.

330
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:57,874
<i>Mmm.</i>

331
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,639
I don't want it, though.
You can have it.

332
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,936
Well, maybe you prefer this.

333
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,564
Ow! My eyes!

334
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,501
Hey, you...

335
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,009
Hey, Luke.

336
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,839
Luke.

337
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,684
Cool.

338
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,458
You guys should
get out of here.

339
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,544
Call the police
and tell them the truth.

340
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,507
A gang of high school
kids came in here

341
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,000
and demanded
you serve them drinks.

342
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,668
Well, you tried to ID them,

343
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,366
but, uh, they threatened
to cause trouble.

344
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,468
There was a fight.

345
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,137
You didn't really get a good
look at the other guys.

346
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,175
Otherwise, I imagine you
and this place

347
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,714
could get into trouble
for serving minors.

348
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,339
<i>I</i> mean,

349
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,850
this is what happens.

350
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,643
Here.

351
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,162
For the damages.

352
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,617
Luke!
What happened?

353
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,193
I got into a fight
with some guys at school.

354
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,853
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

355
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,793
Some seniors
were picking on me.
It's no big deal.

356
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,006
Why were they
picking on you?

357
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,541
I don't know, okay.
I'm just going to go
to my room, all right.

358
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,701
Is he all right?

359
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,205
Yes, ma'am, he's fine.

360
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:37,899
Did he get in trouble
at the school?

361
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,476
No, no one saw.
It's just the usual
high school stuff, you know.

362
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,643
I told him I'd teach him
some self-defense

363
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,237
when he's feeling up to it.

364
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,075
I'm sure that's exactly
what he needs.

365
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,919
Well, l am very relieved
that you were there.

366
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,120
I'm going to get ready
for Kristen's.

367
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,718
Anna, can we talk
in the kitchen?

368
00:26:58,884 --> 00:26:59,885
Sure.

369
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:01,587
Excuse us.

370
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,290
What?

371
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,236
Invite him to the party.

372
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,606
- Why?
- 'Cause he's lonely, sweetie.

373
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,166
Caleb would
really love that

374
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,507
Really? You're going
to pull that card?

375
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:17,945
Yes.

376
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,116
David, would you like to come
to the party with me tonight?

377
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,111
Sure, that sounds nice.

378
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,491
Great. I'm going to
leave around 7:00.

379
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,158
All right.

380
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,658
Luke, I need
to take a shower.

381
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,594
Luke!

382
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,032
Luke, come on,
I need to...

383
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,103
I'm sorry, uh...

384
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,508
Um, no, I'm sorry,

385
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,381
I thought Luke was in there.

386
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,513
Oh, I guess I better
go get dressed.

387
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,186
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,125
You should, um,
probably do that.

389
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,080
So, um, this isn't
a big deal or anything,

390
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,575
but this isn't
just Kristen's place.

391
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,816
My boyfriend, Zeke,
lives here, too.

392
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,921
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend.

393
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,594
Yeah, well,
neither do my parents.

394
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,755
And I wouldn't mind
keeping it that way,
if that's cool with you.

395
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,198
I won't say anything.

396
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,531
It's none of my business.

397
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,043
Hi.
Hey.

398
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,206
Hey, who's this?

399
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,512
Um, this is David, he was
friends with my brother Caleb.

400
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,111
I told you about him.
How do you do?

401
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,122
Mmm, fine, thank you.

402
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,529
Zeke's inside smoking.
He was waiting for help
to carry the kegs.

403
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,696
I'll bring them in.

404
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,925
Where are they?

405
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:22,570
They're in Zeke's van.
It should be unlocked.

406
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,411
Anna?

407
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,217
No. I can't tonight.
I wish.

408
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,228
What? Really?

409
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,054
What? Your houseguest?

410
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,290
Yeah, he's...

411
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,923
Where do
you want these?

412
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,439
Well, you can
set them right here.

413
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,078
My man,
welcome to the party.

414
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,349
Craig, no.

415
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,117
It's fine.
He's a big boy.

416
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,649
Sure.

417
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,428
Thanks.

418
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,979
Thank you.

419
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:51,950
Excuse me.

420
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:56,955
Thank you.

421
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,833
You all right?

422
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,302
Yeah, I'm fine.

423
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,134
You wanna...

424
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,204
Yeah, let's go.

425
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,991
God damn it.

426
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,657
Who are they?

427
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,661
No. That's my ex.
The one I was just
telling you about.

428
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,675
Hey, I need
to talk to you.

429
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,913
I'm busy right now, Drew.

430
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,710
I've been
calling you all week,

431
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,184
and then I hear you're
having a party tonight?

432
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,411
What the fuck?

433
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,247
I'm talking to my friend.
You're being rude.

434
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,517
All right, listen, just...

435
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:56,515
Come here...

436
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,687
Motherfucker!

437
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,301
Get him out of here.

438
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,315
Sorry about your picture.

439
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,313
No, don't worry about it.

440
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,211
Did you, um...

441
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,416
Did you want to see
the rest of the house?

442
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,253
Are you okay?

443
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,422
Yeah. Why?

444
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,021
Seems like you're
not really into this.

445
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:08,654
Oh, I am.

446
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,439
Oh...

447
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:20,941
You are.

448
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,459
Hey, there they are.

449
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,022
Who have you got? I got a queen.
He's got a king.

450
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,491
Sit down.

451
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,965
Thought you guys left your own
party, found something better.

452
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,134
Want some?
No, I'm good.

453
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,901
I just...

454
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,809
I wanted to say
we support you guys.

455
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,642
If you need anything,
you just let me know.

456
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,680
Support us how?

457
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,413
I mean, you know,
we support you,

458
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,322
like, "Go America!" right?

459
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,862
But you wouldn't support us
by, like, enlisting?

460
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,522
Aw...

461
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,068
Shit, man, they don't want
me in there.

462
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,601
No, I can't, you know.

463
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,900
I've got bad asthma.

464
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,242
It'd make it
real hard to...

465
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,400
Hard to what?

466
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:33,276
Hey, man,
I mean, I just...

467
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,079
What'?

468
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,778
I'm just
fucking with you, man.

469
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,883
Fuck, man.

470
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,085
Oh, you think that's
funny, huh, Kristen?

471
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,625
I'll be right back.

472
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,464
Nice piece of ass there, huh?

473
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,295
Could you get me a gun?

474
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,707
A gun?

475
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,374
Yeah, I can get you a gun.

476
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,878
What do you
need a gun for?

477
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,714
I'm a soldier, man.
I like guns.

478
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,315
Yeah. I know a guy.

479
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,747
You got cash?

480
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,045
I do.

481
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,919
Fuck it.
Give me your number.

482
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,223
I'm using a burner right now.

483
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,385
Number's on the back.

484
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,231
Soldiers like guns.

485
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,933
Landing a gig
is huge for me.

486
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,637
What's the big deal
if I go on tour?

487
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,297
It's, like,
three weeks, max.

488
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,739
Why don't you trust me
for, like, five seconds?

489
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,773
I don't know. Maybe...

490
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,604
I've given you no reason
not to trust me.
I'm done with this.

491
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,005
Come on.

492
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,585
You ready to go?
Sure.

493
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,265
I'll drive.
No, I'm fine.

494
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,039
I'll drive.

495
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,474
You're stoned.

496
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,340
And how are you
more sober than me?

497
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,440
I'm bigger than you.

498
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,135
Please, put on your seat belt.

499
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,693
Do you want to talk about it?
No.

500
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,995
It's just...

501
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,103
It's nothing. I mean,
we got into an argument.

502
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,502
It's old stuff.

503
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,206
You know, I used to love
that he was in a band.

504
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,408
But now I'm saving
money for college,

505
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,586
and he just
isn't moving on.

506
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,211
I mean, he doesn't
even have a job.

507
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,917
Well, he's a drug dealer.

508
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,854
Okay.
He's not a drug dealer.

509
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:41,701
Yeah. He sells drugs sometimes to,
like, friends for extra cash.

510
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,773
Well, if he's messing
things up with you,
then he's a fool,

511
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,036
and you don't need
to worry about it.

512
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,712
No. I'm serious.

513
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,044
I mean, hell,
if I'd had a girl
like you back home,

514
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,744
I wouldn't have gone over to the
Middle East to get shot at.

515
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,887
Thank you.

516
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,830
I like this music.

517
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,602
You do?

518
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,979
It's, uh, just a mix
that I made.

519
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,953
I can make you one
if you wanted.

520
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:35,186
Yeah? Can you put
this song on it?

521
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,425
Yeah, I can do that.

522
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,182
So, um, good night.

523
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,778
Good night.

524
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,453
Thanks for inviting me out.

525
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,790
Yeah, no problem.

526
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:09,814
Good night.

527
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,308
No.
I want to proceed
as we discussed.

528
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,902
No one will be able
to recognize me.
That's important.

529
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,646
What do you mean,
"Dental records"?

530
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,116
An orthodontist?
No, I don't need that.

531
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,081
Fingers, yes.

532
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,421
As soon as possible.
I'm off the grid for now.

533
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,687
But there are people
trying to look for me.

534
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:29,095
I understand
it'll take some time,
but this is urgent.

535
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,865
I just need a new face.

536
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,763
I'll keep this phone
in case anything comes up
and you need to reach me.

537
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,465
All right. Copy that.

538
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,944
Yeah, his name is
David Andersen Collins.

539
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,208
I can tell you the unit that
he served in if that helps.

540
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,784
No, nothings wrong. Um...

541
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,548
He was friends with my brother
and we heard that he was back,

542
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,181
so, uh, any contact
information would be great.

543
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,350
Okay, ma'am.
I'll call you when
we have any details.

544
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,187
Good bye.

545
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,541
Tell Fort Kennilworth
that David Collins is dead.

546
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,037
Just give them
the official version.

547
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,152
We'll take it from here.

548
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,088
Next week I'm meeting
with the rest of the board

549
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:29,057
to discuss the future
of our work with the military,

550
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,751
in light of Project
Aegolius' dissolution.

551
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,597
Richard has more information
on that subject. Richard?

552
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,727
I can't get into
too many details,

553
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:41,997
nor would you want me to.

554
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,900
However, I can say that...

555
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,010
Sorry to interrupt.
Somethings come up.

556
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,906
My apologies, but you'll
have to excuse me.

557
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,353
When did Fort
Kennilworth receive this call?

558
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,550
About an hour ago, sir.

559
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,683
Have you
lD'd the caller?

560
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:07,091
Not confirmed, but she gave
her name as Anna Peterson.

561
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,756
Peterson.

562
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:11,197
As in Caleb Peterson?

563
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,698
His sister.

564
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,369
Home address is in there.

565
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,699
Book me on
the next flight.

566
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,034
If we need to charter
something, do it.

567
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,699
And I'm gonna need
some shooters.

568
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,210
If anyone asks
what's happening,
what do I tell them?

569
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,212
Make something up.

570
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:28,042
No one outside this circle
can know that any of
our subjects are still active.

571
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,779
If KPG gets
any blowback on this,

572
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,785
you and I will both
be hung out to dry.

573
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,150
You got that?
Mmm.

574
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,546
Call me when you
got the plane booked.

575
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,904
I'm not late, am l?

576
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,319
No, no.
You're just on time.

577
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,248
Good.

578
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,412
Look, before
we get started,

579
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,823
I just want to make sure that
you've got some cash on you.

580
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,359
No offense.

581
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,495
That should be good?

582
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:20,762
It'll do.

583
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:23,801
Let's get started.

584
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,706
Let's start
with this.

585
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,280
I mean,
it's a standard Beretta.

586
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,678
I'm sure you're
familiar with it.

587
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,945
In my opinion,
if you've seen one of these,
you've seen them all.

588
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,389
But this baby,
this here is

589
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,618
a 9-millimeter
Witness Elite.

590
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,126
It's a very similar weapon
to the Beretta,

591
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,786
but I prefer the recoil.

592
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,627
I mean, it's got absolutely
no kick at all.

593
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:04,635
You army?

594
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,204
Yes, sir.

595
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,579
I'm navy, myself.

596
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,219
Yeah, that's fine.

597
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,355
You want the Elite?

598
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:22,864
Oh, I'll take 'em all.

599
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,233
All the handguns?

600
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:29,405
No. Everything.
All your guns.

601
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,099
Shit.

602
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,067
That's what
I was thinking.

603
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,941
Look, man, if you've brought
money for all of them,

604
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,842
<i>I'll</i> cut you a deal.
You can take 'em
all off my hands.

605
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,349
No, I'm going to kill you.

606
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,543
Hey, what the fuck, David?

607
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,518
Now, you listen to me
one fucking second...

608
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,920
Wait, wait, wait.

609
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,925
No, no, no, no.

610
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,179
Hello?

611
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,581
Yeah, thanks
for calling me back.

612
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:02,693
What?

613
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,599
Hey, Mom, can I talk
to you for a second?

614
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,002
Sure, sweetie,
what's going on?

615
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,601
Um, I called the army base

616
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,870
that David said
that he was just
discharged from,

617
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,607
I wanted to ask about him.

618
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:19,511
- What?
- Why would you do that?

619
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,346
Spencer?

620
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:29,780
I need a drink.

621
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,123
Why? What happened?
I'm getting a drink, honey.

622
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,327
They found Allan,
you know my boss, Allan?

623
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,490
He'd been missing from
work for a couple of days,

624
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,794
everybody got very worried,

625
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,799
so one of his friends
went over and broke
into his house.

626
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,869
And they found him
and his girlfriend dead.

627
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,535
They'd both taken a bunch
of prescription pills,

628
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,873
it was like they committed
suicide together or something.

629
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,469
Oh, my God!

630
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,013
But that doesn't make any sense.
He was...

631
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,641
No. The guy
was totally normal.

632
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,479
But the police are investigating.
You know, it's, uh...

633
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,550
Doesn't look like
it was a break-in.

634
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:01,884
There was no forced entries.

635
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,084
She, uh... The girl...
She had, uh...

636
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,819
She had bruises
on her body.

637
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,539
I don't know
what that means.

638
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,591
Anyway, uh, we will
leave it for the police

639
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,499
to tell us exactly
what happened.

640
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,935
I don't know.

641
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,902
Damn thing is this makes
me regional manager.

642
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:28,378
Yeah. As soon as
Corporate found out,
they called me.

643
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,213
Right away they want me
to start tomorrow.

644
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,186
And they're offering
me Allan's salary.

645
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:34,687
So...

646
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,124
Well, that's, uh...

647
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,693
Yeah.

648
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:40,423
Careful what you wish for.

649
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:44,188
David.

650
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:47,967
I'm sorry to interrupt

651
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,599
No. Don't be silly.
It's fine.

652
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:55,706
Um, I'm having a drink.
Would you join me?

653
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,302
Oh, sure.

654
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,543
I'll be right back.

655
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,655
Hello?
Hey, Anna?

656
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,560
It's Craig, babe.
They just found him
out at the quarry.

657
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,327
He's dead.
Someone shot him.

658
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,059
What?

659
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,169
Do they know who did it?

660
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,498
I don't really have
all the details yet.

661
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,304
Um, can you meet up later?

662
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:28,468
Yeah, of course.

663
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,128
Um, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

664
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:34,906
What is it?

665
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,518
Oh, shit. Fuck.

666
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,529
Babe, I got to go, all right.
I'll call you back.

667
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,646
Hello?

668
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,441
I just heard from Zeke.

669
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,303
How are you doing?

670
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,941
I just don't get it.

671
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,610
Who'd want to hurt Craig?

672
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,624
Yeah, I know. Can you
sit down for a second?

673
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:18,516
Yeah.

674
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:22,286
So, how does
this work again?

675
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,396
Uh, first you make
a hole at the top,

676
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:27,132
so you can reach in and
scoop all the guts out.

677
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,068
Oh, man.

678
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,034
Your parents' knives suck.

679
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,133
Yeah.

680
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:40,980
That's better.

681
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,979
Do you carry that with you,
like, all the time?

682
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,814
Oh, this thing? Sure.

683
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:51,155
Why?

684
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,660
I don't know.

685
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,424
Just in case.

686
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,997
I called the army base that
David said that he was from.

687
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,940
They told me that
David Collins died a week ago.

688
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:10,075
He was in some military
hospital in Arizona.

689
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,341
There was a fire
from oxygen tanks.

690
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,848
About 20 people died,
David Collins was one of them.

691
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,514
Does David have any ID?
Credit cards?

692
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,291
I've never seen
him use a wallet.

693
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:25,694
What about his phone?
He has a burner, right?

694
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,696
Why don't you check some
of the numbers he's called?

695
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,092
Your brother
knows computers.

696
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,030
Have him look
some of them up.

697
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,466
Yeah. That's a good idea.

698
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,697
Hey, Kristen. I think that couple's
been done for a bit.

699
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,068
I've got it. Thanks.

700
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,307
Call me after work, okay?

701
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,906
Take care of yourself.
You, too.

702
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,050
Do you want
some advice, Luke?

703
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,144
Sure.

704
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:57,790
Never let anyone
pick on you.

705
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,252
Otherwise, you'll carry it with
you the rest of your life.

706
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,895
Those kids at school,
they're bigger than you?

707
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,255
Yeah.

708
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,263
Then bring
a knife to school.

709
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,505
If they take it off of you
and beat you up,

710
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,920
you go around
their houses at night

711
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,565
and burn them down
with their families inside.

712
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,166
What's the worst
they can do?

713
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,278
Yeah. Okay.

714
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:24,249
Here. You keep it.

715
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,117
You're giving this to me?

716
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,157
Yeah, man, it's yours.
I've got others.

717
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,247
Thanks.

718
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,625
Hey.

719
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,858
Mom and Dad around?

720
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:37,091
No.
They went to the store.

721
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,259
Your mom's making
pumpkin pie.

722
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,331
That's cool.

723
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,155
Shit.

724
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:05,021
Fuck!

725
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,062
Fuck.

726
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,508
Oh, my God!

727
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:58,936
Hello.

728
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,605
Hey, it's, uh, me.

729
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,440
Hey.

730
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:10,047
What?

731
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:15,686
They found the gun that
killed Craig in your van?

732
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,135
Yeah, it was wiped clean.

733
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:23,425
Um, I guess they just got an
anonymous tip or something.

734
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,240
But you're innocent!

735
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:29,276
Anna, I know, but' um,
then they searched my room,

736
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,243
and they found some
other stuff. You know.

737
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,872
So, it looks like
I'm actually gonna be
here for a little while.

738
00:54:37,241 --> 00:54:38,777
I love you, all right?

739
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,720
Yeah, I know.
I gotta go.

740
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,591
<i>Okay -</i>

741
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,122
Love you, bye.

742
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,952
Honey, you okay?

743
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,418
I, um...

744
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,527
My friend Craig
was killed today.

745
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,600
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

746
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,935
How? What happened?

747
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,003
He was shot.
I don't know.

748
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,373
And they arrested
Zeke for it.

749
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,641
- Zeke?
- I'm sorry, honey.

750
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:43,145
But if they arrested
your ex-boyfriend,

751
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,948
it was probably for
a very good reason.

752
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,715
We all know Zeke
was never exactly
a pillar of this community.

753
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:52,324
He's not my ex-boyfriend,
Dad, he's my boyfriend.

754
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:54,721
I never stopped seeing him.

755
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,525
I'm 20 years old,
I can date who I want.

756
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,963
As long as you live in
this house,
you cannot.

757
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,023
Oh, you know
nothing about him!
Nothing!

758
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,501
I know he's a drugged-out
punk junkie...
Really, Dad!

759
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,560
...who started
dating my daughter

760
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,640
when she was 17 years old,
is what I know.

761
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:08,307
Right.

762
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,036
What about him?

763
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,484
Everybody's best friend.

764
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,515
I called the military base
that he said he was from

765
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:20,919
and they told me
he was dead.

766
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,356
Ah, that's military
intelligence for you.

767
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,058
Right. Ask to see his ID.

768
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,669
He's not David Collins, okay.
We don't know who he is.

769
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,910
I was part of a special forces
unit when I was injured,

770
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:47,038
so they should be
providing a cover story

771
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:48,708
if any civilians
ask about me.

772
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,513
That's a good thing.

773
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:54,386
But I did get
my dog tags back.

774
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,785
Uh...

775
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,721
They're right here.

776
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,695
I don't like to
wear them because, uh...

777
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,390
Well, I don't know,
but, um...

778
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,366
I like having them
with me, though, you know.

779
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:13,064
As for ID, I don't
have a current license,

780
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:16,405
but, uh, I've got
my documents in my bag.
Should I go...

781
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,213
No, no, no.
That won't be necessary.

782
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,610
Anna Peterson,
you owe him an apology
right now.

783
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,745
No fucking way.
You watch your mouth,
young lady.

784
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,084
I am very sorry
about your friend Craig.

785
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,648
That's a terrible thing
that happened.

786
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,757
As far as it goes
with Zeke Hastings
and his crew,

787
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,160
I have it on
very good authority

788
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:36,788
they're nothing but
a bunch of pot dealers.

789
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:38,924
You wanna know why Zeke
was arrested for murder?

790
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,991
Because he probably
did it, that's why.

791
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,437
- Fuck you!
- Ugh.

792
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,730
Hey, now, Anna.

793
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,405
I'm sorry, honey.
David, I'm terribly sorry.

794
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:55,139
No, that's okay.
She's, uh... She's upset.

795
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,411
I probably should
have explained

796
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,981
the, uh, special forces
thing earlier,

797
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:08,928
it's just, we're not really
supposed to talk about it.

798
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,129
No. I understand.

799
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,666
Uh...

800
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,135
I could use a drink.
How about you, David?

801
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:18,769
Yes, please.

802
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:40,117
What?

803
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,824
Hey.

804
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,848
I just wanted
to <i>say,</i> uh...

805
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,352
I just wanted
to say how sorry
I am about Craig.

806
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:17,399
He seemed like
a really cool guy.

807
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:23,065
And Zeke getting arrested...
Again, I'm very sorry.

808
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,363
I know you don't need me here
at this stressful time.

809
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,005
I'm not helping,
which is a shame,

810
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,714
because I promised
Caleb I would do

811
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,841
anything I could
to help your family.

812
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,175
But just so you know,

813
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,584
I'll be moving on
in a couple of days.

814
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,213
So, you don't need to put up
with me much longer, okay?

815
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,964
Okay.

816
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,034
<i>Okay-</i>

817
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,644
Good.

818
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,384
What is this?

819
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,748
Is this the CD
you made me?

820
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:15,879
Um, yeah.

821
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,089
Is it done?

822
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,219
Yeah.

823
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,390
Well, thank you.

824
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,301
I can't wait
to listen to it.

825
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,059
I want every contractor
within a 100-mile radius.

826
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,279
And I don't care
where they come from.

827
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:47,083
KPG, ex-military, whatever.

828
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:49,817
I'll need a team mobilized by the
time l land.

829
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:51,824
I'll give them the necessary
mission specs in person.

830
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,656
We can't risk
a leak on this.

831
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:56,458
Good luck.

832
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,534
You took a picture
of Davids phone?

833
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,873
Yeah. I paid for a reverse
directory thing

834
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,503
to look the number up online.

835
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,776
It said it was this unlisted
landline of a doctor in Miami.

836
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,284
His name's Peter Boddington.

837
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,944
Except he's not
a doctor anymore.

838
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,014
He lost his license
two years ago

839
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:23,471
after performing
a face lift on a woman
while he was drunk.

840
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:26,494
So, David knows the guy?
I mean, maybe it's
his uncle or something.

841
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,391
That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

842
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:30,055
I need to talk to the police.

843
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,030
The cops found those
drugs in Zeke's room,

844
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,965
so they think
they've got their guy.

845
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,503
So, what do you
need me to do?

846
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:38,538
Get any information
you can on this guy.

847
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,806
Do you really think
David killed Craig
and that other guy?

848
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,978
Yeah. I do.

849
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:48,980
Okay. I'll see if
I can find anything.

850
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,212
Thank you, Luke.

851
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:22,279
I'm sorry. I'll show you some
magic tricks later. Just...

852
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:23,673
Um...

853
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,697
- Hey, faggot.
- Oh. Whoa.

854
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:52,375
Hey, what's that
you're looking at?

855
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,244
Oh...

856
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,909
Are you looking for
someone to do your
sex change operation?

857
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:06,151
You little fucking bitch...

858
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:11,896
That's right, bitches.

859
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,243
God damn it.

860
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,618
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

861
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:36,658
Mrs. Peterson?
Yes, that's right.

862
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,919
Mr. Alston will see you now.
Please, step inside.

863
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,655
Okay.
Just a second.

864
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,091
What happened?

865
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,096
This kid called me
a faggot,

866
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,935
so l, uh,

867
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,977
broke a yardstick
on his face.

868
01:03:58,635 --> 01:03:59,636
<i>Okay -</i>

869
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:01,604
Awesome.

870
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,283
I'll go in with you.

871
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:09,979
<i>Okay -</i>

872
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,216
Is it this way?
Yes.

873
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:17,359
Due to our school's
zero tolerance
policy on violence,

874
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:20,128
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to expel your son.

875
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,667
That's pending
the decision of the board,

876
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,535
but I'm afraid
it's fairly certain.

877
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,505
But...
I'm sorry.

878
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,343
What did the kid call him?

879
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:32,736
What?

880
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,390
You know, the kid,
the one Luke
hit in the face.

881
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,008
What did he call Luke?

882
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:39,485
I don't think that's relevant
to this conversation.

883
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,317
Did he call him a faggot?

884
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,760
I believe that's the word that was
used, yes.
But that's no excuse...

885
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,761
So, that makes it
a hate crime.

886
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,658
What?
A hate crime.

887
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,230
And I'd like to know
how many others

888
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:58,238
have been perpetrated
against her son
under your watch.

889
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:02,909
A gay student targeted
with physical violence
finally defends himself,

890
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,672
and you're... What?

891
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,205
Suspending him?

892
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,607
We could
consider suspension.

893
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,185
No. You couldn't.

894
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:14,344
I'll be interested to see
what the board makes of you

895
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,688
when this is in front of the entire
country, not to mention our lawyers.

896
01:05:19,182 --> 01:05:20,923
Do you want to sue them?

897
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,221
I... I don't, uh...

898
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,026
We're suing you
and the school board.

899
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:32,567
I didn't even know
he was gay.

900
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,407
What about
after-school detention?

901
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:43,544
For how long?

902
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:45,442
A month.

903
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,484
That seems fair.

904
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,785
After-school detention.

905
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,157
We'll put him to work
helping the prom committee

906
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,729
set up for
the Halloween dance.

907
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,130
We'll agree to that

908
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:01,903
But I do not want
to hear anything further

909
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,729
about this young man
being harassed.

910
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,067
We understand each other?

911
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:07,670
I believe we do, Mr...

912
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,143
Who are you?

913
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:12,577
I'm a friend of the family.

914
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,186
After-school detention
for a month.

915
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:28,986
That's it?
Yeah.

916
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:34,028
See you later.
Oh, David?

917
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,159
Can I talk to you
for a second?

918
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:41,371
I'm going to step out into the hall
with Luke for a moment, if that's okay.

919
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,534
Oh, certainly.

920
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,673
So, she thinks
you killed Craig.

921
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,306
And she's trying to make
a case to the police

922
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:51,646
so they'll let
her boyfriend go.

923
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,219
Anna told you all this?
Yeah.

924
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:57,148
Do you think
I killed Craig?

925
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,126
I don't care.

926
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:01,356
But that's why

927
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,522
she wanted me to
check out that plastic
surgeon in Florida.

928
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,361
She wanted to know what
the connection was there.

929
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:09,301
Yeah, I mean,
why would I need
a plastic surgeon, right'?

930
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,700
To change your appearance.

931
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,004
Like, the bones
in your face.

932
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:16,172
And maybe scar up your fingers
so you don't have prints.

933
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:19,040
I mean, at least
that's what I figured.

934
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,576
I know you're not
really David Collins,

935
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:24,015
I looked him up right
after Anna said that.

936
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,349
So, maybe you don't want
people 10 know
who you are.

937
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,818
A doctor who would
do that sort of thing

938
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,913
is probably pretty rare.

939
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:31,653
I mean, there's probably
rules against it.

940
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,854
But that doctor, well,
I guess he needs the money,

941
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:36,488
so he'd do
that kind of work.

942
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,333
That's an interesting theory.

943
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,867
I'm not going to
tell anyone about it.

944
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,408
And nobody
will believe Anna.

945
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,204
She doesn't have
anything against you.

946
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:53,681
You killed Dad's boss,
too, right?

947
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:57,181
I don't care. I'm not
going say anything.

948
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,946
Why not?

949
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,717
Because we're friends.

950
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:05,615
Right?

951
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:11,894
Yeah. Of course we are.

952
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:15,297
<i>Okay -</i>

953
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,394
I just wanted you to know.

954
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,574
Did Anna tell anyone
else about this?

955
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,480
I don't know.

956
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:29,281
Her friend, Kristen, maybe'?

957
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:31,908
<i>Okay-</i>

958
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,748
Thank you.

959
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:51,561
You know, David,
I really...

960
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,439
I wanna thank you.

961
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,171
I don't know what
I would have done
if you hadn't been here.

962
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,142
And I don't... I don't
mean just for today,

963
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,240
I mean everything.

964
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:06,150
I am... I'm really grateful.

965
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,626
Really, Mrs. Peterson.
It's no problem.

966
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:16,594
I'll go get the rest.

967
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,294
Thank you, David.

968
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,835
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you Anna Peterson?

969
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:09,642
Uh, no. No,
she's working at the diner.

970
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:11,376
I'm her mother.

971
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:13,545
What's she...
Did she do something?

972
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:14,849
No, it's fine, ma'am.

973
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:16,754
But your daughter, she put in
a call to Fort Kennilworth

974
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:19,383
a couple of days ago
asking about a man
named David Collins.

975
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:21,325
Yes. Oh, that's right,
she did.

976
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:25,395
You wouldn't
happen to have seen anyone

977
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:26,694
resembling this man,
would you?

978
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,833
This is, um... David.

979
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,944
Ma'am, when was
the last time you saw him.

980
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:42,206
Well, he just went inside.

981
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:33,723
No!

982
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,633
Stop the girl! Get back here.

983
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:00,917
Get him!

984
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:29,946
Oh, shit!

985
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:20,171
No, no, no, no.
Ah! David, what...

986
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,736
What is happening, David?

987
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:24,243
Who are those men?

988
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,540
I really am sorry
about this, Mrs. Peterson.

989
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,843
I'm afraid I haven't been
fully honest with you.

990
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,542
What do you mean?

991
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:35,112
It would take too long
to explain.

992
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:39,553
I wanted to help.

993
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:42,162
I considered it my mission
to assist you all
while I was here.

994
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,195
There were just
too many complications.

995
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:49,264
What are you talking about?

996
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:52,134
David, why are those men
trying to kill you?

997
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:53,802
It doesn't matter.

998
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,143
Did you...

999
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:06,942
Did you even
know my son?

1000
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,284
I did.

1001
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:12,285
Yes.

1002
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:15,091
We were in
the same program.

1003
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:20,397
And he would understand
what I have to do here.

1004
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,497
He's here in the...

1005
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,583
I'm sorry.

1006
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,822
I'm going in.

1007
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:47,254
Give me 15 seconds
of cover, then hold.

1008
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:20,358
Fuck!

1009
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:44,908
Fuck.

1010
01:15:58,721 --> 01:15:59,995
What the...

1011
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,328
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1012
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:38,928
David.

1013
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:42,602
I'm really sorry
about this, sir.

1014
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,490
I think he's dead.

1015
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,852
Military police.
I'm gonna need
your vehicle.

1016
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,985
What?

1017
01:17:36,085 --> 01:17:37,792
Are the keys in it?
Yes, but...

1018
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:01,454
Excuse me,
are you Anna Peterson?

1019
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:03,313
Yes.

1020
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:05,120
My name is Major Carver.

1021
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,221
Military police. I need you
to come with me, please.

1022
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,224
Okay. What's going on?

1023
01:18:09,318 --> 01:18:10,854
It's about David,
Miss Peterson.

1024
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,113
He is not who
you think he is.

1025
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:13,623
And we need to go now.

1026
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:16,458
<i>Okay -</i>

1027
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:19,638
ls everything all right?

1028
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,702
I think so.
I'll call you later, okay?

1029
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:22,797
Miss Peterson.

1030
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,790
Hey-
Hey.

1031
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:18,392
Is Anna working?

1032
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,730
Um, she just left.

1033
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,260
Oh, yeah?

1034
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,931
Where was she going?

1035
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,237
I'm not sure exactly.

1036
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,930
To pick up Luke?

1037
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:29,903
Um...

1038
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,544
I think that
she's going...

1039
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,601
Never mind.

1040
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:10,611
What?

1041
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,985
Okay. Copy.
We're on our way.

1042
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:16,749
What?

1043
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,324
We're going to
the rec center
to get your brother.

1044
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:20,689
The police couldn't
send a car there.

1045
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:21,955
They've got
their hands full.

1046
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,261
Okay. You need to
tell me what's going on.

1047
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:27,032
Who are you?

1048
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:28,863
What? You came here
for David?

1049
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,163
Yes.

1050
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,303
The soldier
you know as David

1051
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:36,365
was one of the subjects
of a medical experiment.

1052
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,277
While we had him under study,
he killed several people
and escaped.

1053
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,315
Then he burned their bodies
to confuse us.

1054
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:44,051
We thought he'd died
in the fire initially.

1055
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:45,517
By the time we figured out
what he'd done,

1056
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:46,608
the trail was cold.

1057
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:47,845
Maybe you shouldn't
have tested

1058
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,354
your procedures
on a psychopath.

1059
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,780
By all accounts,
he was an ideal soldier.

1060
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:55,617
I don't know.

1061
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,357
I need to call my brother.

1062
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,869
Mr. Peterson,
is that a cell phone?

1063
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,468
Didn't I say,
"Phones off“?

1064
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,302
Hand it over.

1065
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,874
You can have it back
after detention.

1066
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,651
Luke, I need you
to call me
when you get this.

1067
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,188
Okay? It's important.

1068
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,061
Where are those
cop cars going?

1069
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:36,067
Somebody attacked your diner
right after we left it.

1070
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,600
It was called in
as an explosion.

1071
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,770
Is anyone alive?

1072
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,237
I don't know.

1073
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,604
It's possible that
he'd leave some wounded
to keep them busy.

1074
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,911
Wait. Where are my parents?

1075
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:53,712
You haven't said
anything about my parents.

1076
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,124
They're both dead.

1077
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:02,059
He killed them
before we could stop him.

1078
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,697
I'm sorry.

1079
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,958
<i>No.</i>

1080
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:11,935
David has neurological
conditioning, Miss Peterson,

1081
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,631
designed to protect both him
and the experiment.

1082
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:18,869
If he feels like his identity
may be compromised,

1083
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,716
he's programmed to
clean up all loose ends.

1084
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:27,615
I doubt he could
stop himself now
even if he wanted to.

1085
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,991
It's why we need to
get you and your brother
somewhere safe.

1086
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,079
Miss Peterson,
we need to go.

1087
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:01,743
Miss Peterson?

1088
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,085
Uh...

1089
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,624
Yeah, let's go
get my brother.

1090
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:33,949
What the hell is this?

1091
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,814
For the fall dance, they do
this Halloween maze thing.

1092
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,350
Stay close to me.

1093
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:06,043
God damn it! What in the hell?

1094
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:07,677
Who's in here?

1095
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:10,714
Military police!

1096
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:11,892
I'm here for Luke Peterson.

1097
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,482
How do I get
through this maze?

1098
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,997
Left, right,
right, left, left,

1099
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,531
right, left,
then straight.

1100
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:21,690
Got it?

1101
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:22,891
Yeah.

1102
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,050
Luke!
Uh, excuse me.

1103
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:50,027
But you're interrupting
detention right now.

1104
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:52,923
Who are you exactly?

1105
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:56,959
What's going on?

1106
01:24:57,059 --> 01:24:58,697
We need to go.
Your sister...

1107
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:00,629
Oh, shit.

1108
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:12,493
Who else is in here?

1109
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,611
No one. It's just us two.

1110
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:14,881
Where are the lights
controlled from?

1111
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,251
There's a DJ booth
in the back.

1112
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:19,924
We need to get
out of here. Now.
Where's the back exit?

1113
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:21,823
It's this way.
Uh, follow me.

1114
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:25,227
Come on.
Uh...

1115
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,775
Just this way.

1116
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,579
Slow down.

1117
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:59,432
Run! Go out
the other way! Go!

1118
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:40,634
Hello, sir.

1119
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,116
You shouldn't
have followed me.

1120
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:27,175
I don't know
what you expected.

1121
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:34,686
Shit.

1122
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,594
Anna, I don't know
what's going on,
but David wouldn't hurt us.

1123
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,229
Luke, I need you to trust me.

1124
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:45,770
Just come on.
What?

1125
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:57,939
Shit.

1126
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:00,375
Come on.

1127
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:15,826
I need you
to hide in here. Okay?

1128
01:28:15,991 --> 01:28:17,299
What? No way.

1129
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:19,769
Anna, look, David
was probably
just after that army guy.

1130
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:20,932
Let's just...

1131
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:22,268
Let's go talk to him.

1132
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:23,732
Luke.

1133
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:27,677
He killed Mom and Dad.

1134
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:32,083
No, he didn't.
You're just saying that.

1135
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:37,119
What?

1136
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:41,754
Mom and Dad are...

1137
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,187
Please, Luke.

1138
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:46,365
Okay, you need
to hide in there.

1139
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:48,692
I'm going
to lead him away.

1140
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:51,997
You can't come out unless
you hear me or the police.

1141
01:28:57,766 --> 01:28:59,336
I'm going to
come back for you.

1142
01:29:12,147 --> 01:29:14,286
I'm really sorry
about this, guys.

1143
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:18,362
I tried to think of
another way to do it.

1144
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:25,736
Any other solution.

1145
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:37,505
Luke!

1146
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:42,584
Come on out, buddy.

1147
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,325
I'm not going to hurt you.

1148
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,284
You killed my parents.

1149
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:30,089
I did.

1150
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:32,587
Yes.

1151
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:12,466
<i>Ow!</i>

1152
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:33,715
Stop it.
It'll be over in a second.

1153
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:53,939
Hey, Luke.

1154
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:25,377
You did the right thing.

1155
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:31,207
I don't blame you.

1156
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:38,987
Don't feel bad.

1157
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:56,636
Thank you.

1158
01:33:57,065 --> 01:33:58,271
You okay?

1159
01:33:58,333 --> 01:33:59,505
Yeah. Are you?

1160
01:34:00,335 --> 01:34:01,643
Yeah.

1161
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:32,978
Follow the light.

1162
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:37,675
You both feeling okay?

1163
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:42,110
We're fine.

1164
01:34:42,544 --> 01:34:44,217
Great. I'll be right back.

1165
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:57,192
Copy that.

1166
01:34:58,459 --> 01:34:59,870
What's the deal?

1167
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:01,338
Guess there's
two bodies inside,

1168
01:35:01,396 --> 01:35:02,875
both of them
pretty badly burned.

1169
01:35:02,964 --> 01:35:04,966
One of the guys said
their teeth are missing,

1170
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,138
got knocked out,
so I don't know
what the deal is.

1171
01:35:07,302 --> 01:35:08,838
As soon <i>as</i>
we get the all clear,
you can go in.

1172
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:09,904
<i>Okay -</i>

1173
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:41,912
What the fuck!
