1
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:04,911
Master Li is here!

2
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:07,811
Master Li is here!

3
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:22,512
Shu Lien!

4
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:30,433
Li Mu Bai is here!

5
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:39,864
How's everything? Fine. Please come in.

6
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:54,076
Mu Bai, it's been too long.

7
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:55,376
It has.

8
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,006
How's business? Good.

9
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:00,007
And how are you? Fine.

10
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:07,147
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.

11
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:10,098
He said you were practicing deep meditation.

12
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,448
The mountain must be so peaceful...

13
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:15,698
I envy you.

14
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,569
My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.

15
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:24,039
I left the training early.

16
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,960
Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.

17
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,790
During my meditation training...

18
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,721
I came to a place of deep silence...

19
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:39,131
I was surrounded by light...

20
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:43,391
Time and space disappeared.

21
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:48,192
I had come to a place my master had never told me about.

22
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,233
You were enlightened?

23
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:53,953
No.

24
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:57,563
I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.

25
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:03,253
Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.

26
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:06,204
I couldn't bear it.

27
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:08,714
I broke off my meditation.

28
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:10,705
I couldn't go on.

29
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:15,175
There was something... pulling me back.

30
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:17,766
What was it?

31
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:23,426
Something I can't let go of.

32
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:28,777
You're leaving soon?

33
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:33,197
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery

34
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,567
to Peking.

35
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,278
Perhaps I could ask you

36
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:40,078
to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

37
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,509
The Green Destiny sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?

38
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,129
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.

39
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,220
I don't understand. How can you part with it?

40
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,960
It has always been with you.

41
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,430
Too many men have died at its edge.

42
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:08,601
It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.

43
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:13,482
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.

44
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:18,872
It's time for me to leave it behind.

45
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:21,963
So what will you do now?

46
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,993
Come with me to Peking.

47
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:30,174
You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself.

48
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,914
It'll be just like old times.

49
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:38,344
First I must visit my master's grave.

50
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,845
It's been many years since...

51
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:44,565
Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death.

52
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:47,776
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

53
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,786
I must pray for his forgiveness.

54
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:55,496
Join me once you have finished.

55
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,987
I can wait for you in Peking.

56
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,617
Perhaps.

57
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:08,918
Ok. Pass.

58
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:10,668
Thanks.

59
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,759
Let's go into the city.

60
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,700
Everything got here safely. I'm much obliged.

61
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,900
Just doing my job.

62
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:34,451
Sun Security has been the best since your father started it.

63
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:38,831
You're a credit to his memory.

64
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,082
Thank you.

65
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,292
I mean it.

66
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,956
This is Li Mu Bai's personal sword,

67
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,507
a great hero's weapon.

68
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:30,007
He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.

69
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:33,387
It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

70
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:34,678
Sir Te...

71
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:37,148
it has brought him as much trouble as glory.

72
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:40,098
Help him to leave these troubles behind.

73
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,029
Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.

74
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,319
All right.

75
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,279
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

76
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,250
Governor Yu has arrived.

77
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,610
I must change.

78
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,300
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.

79
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,421
Please accept our thanks.

80
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:04,171
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest.

81
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:08,172
Now, Shu Lien...

82
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,392
tell me something.

83
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:13,102
And forgive me for prying.

84
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:16,022
Your father was a great friend to me,

85
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:19,393
and I think of you as my own daughter.

86
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,643
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

87
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:25,203
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword

88
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,744
and his warrior days...

89
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,914
Maybe he's trying to tell you something?

90
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:32,744
I don't know...

91
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:37,335
Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other.

92
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:39,715
All these years, it's a shame...

93
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:44,045
...neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other.

94
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:48,636
You're both wasting precious time.

95
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:54,266
I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

96
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,857
When it comes to emotions,

97
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:02,107
even great heroes can be idiots.

98
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:07,868
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.

99
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,989
I'll give him an earful!

100
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,640
Sir Te said to leave the sword in here.

101
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:28,851
Who are you?

102
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,851
I'm your guest today.

103
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:38,322
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

104
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:41,862
This is Sir Te's study. You are here to?

105
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:46,952
I was just looking for a quiet corner.

106
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,213
I am Sir Te's head servant.

107
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,253
And this is another of our guests.

108
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:07,605
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!

109
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,475
The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal.

110
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:14,696
Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons.

111
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:17,186
You're just not used to handling it.

112
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,906
But, I have had much practice.

113
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,197
As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.

114
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,367
They'd let me play with their weapons.

115
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,037
The scabbard is so beautiful.

116
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:31,748
Beautiful but dangerous.

117
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:35,538
Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.

118
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,139
It's 400 years old.

119
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,059
Exquisite!

120
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,809
You said it belongs to...

121
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,180
My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

122
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,520
Li Mu Bai!

123
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,900
The famous warrior?

124
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:57,161
Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?

125
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,731
You're too young to understand.

126
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:02,451
You're a sword fighter too?

127
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:03,542
Yes, I am.

128
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,532
But I prefer the machete.

129
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:10,042
Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

130
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:12,633
Really?

131
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:18,013
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!

132
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:22,093
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust,

133
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:24,974
integrity... Without rules,

134
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:27,524
we wouldn't survive for long.

135
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:30,224
I've read all about people like you.

136
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:33,235
Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!

137
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:36,365
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.

138
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,075
But you're just like the characters in the stories.

139
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:43,576
Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds...

140
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:45,876
They tell you all about that in those books?

141
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,086
You know what I mean.

142
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:52,417
I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.

143
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,547
So I heard. Congratulations.

144
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:04,148
It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?

145
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,269
You're not married, are you?

146
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:09,729
What do you think?

147
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,109
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.

148
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,910
You're probably right.

149
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,693
Go ahead, Governor Yu.

150
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,455
2 feet 9 inches long.

151
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,665
1 inch wide.

152
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:09,216
The handle is 1 inch deep, 2.6 inches wide.

153
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:13,046
7 tenths of an inch thick.

154
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,846
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

155
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:18,637
You can tell the design

156
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:21,267
dates back to before the Chin era.

157
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:24,447
Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty.

158
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:28,108
Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

159
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:31,488
A sword by itself rules nothing.

160
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:33,948
It comes alive only through skillful manipulation.

161
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:38,379
I see your point. Please continue.

162
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:41,629
The Imperial Court isn't the problem.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,500
With royalty and officials everywhere,

164
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,510
the Royal Guard keeps security tight.

165
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,671
But Peking is not like the West.

166
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:57,181
Here, you'll find all sorts of characters.

167
00:12:57,351 --> 00:13:00,391
Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order.

168
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,772
Don't depend only on the court.

169
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:06,532
Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld

170
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,452
can ensure your position.

171
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,743
Be strong yet supple.

172
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:17,953
This is the way to rule.

173
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:47,447
Governess...

174
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,397
Let me do it.

175
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:55,458
Please sit.

176
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:58,708
I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?

177
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:00,258
Put them down.

178
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:09,139
I heard you met Shu Lien today.

179
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,440
Do you know her?

180
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,930
She's one of those.

181
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,610
Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

182
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,941
I'll socialize with whomever I please.

183
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:25,241
Don't invite danger into your father's house.

184
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:29,192
I'm tired now!

185
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,792
Go to bed then.

186
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,952
Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.

187
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:42,293
God knows what the future will bring.

188
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:45,133
It'll be just the same.

189
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,594
Enough! I'm tired.

190
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:53,974
Autumn is coming.

191
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,305
I'll shut the windows for you.

192
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:25,218
Chilly, eh? Yes, Master Bo.

193
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:26,995
Someone help!

194
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:28,665
Stop him!

195
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,245
He's on the roof!

196
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,296
The sword's been stolen!

197
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:37,886
Stop thief!

198
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:05,539
Stop him!

199
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,339
It's Jade Fox!

200
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,660
We must avenge Mother!

201
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,000
Do something! He's getting away!

202
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:20,211
Return the sword and I'll let you go.

203
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:27,182
You've been trained at Wudan?

204
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,062
You're mistaken.

205
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:36,943
We're just street performers. We were rehearsing.

206
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:37,903
Father!

207
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:39,983
You were rehearsing?

208
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:41,903
Who are you trying to fool?

209
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:43,864
Where did that thief go?

210
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,965
Governor Yu's house!

211
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:40,367
Get down here!

212
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,099
Give back the sword!

213
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:14,557
Sir Te awaits you.

214
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:21,388
I'm sure the thief is in the Yu household.

215
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,648
How dare you imply?

216
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:24,439
Enough!

217
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,290
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

218
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,670
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

219
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:46,721
But the sword could be in his compound.

220
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:55,062
Then someone's trying to set him up.

221
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,472
We should inform Li Mu Bai.

222
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:08,614
What is it?

223
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,834
Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

224
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:17,965
Let me see.

225
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:26,596
Someone is after a Jade Fox.

226
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,976
Preposterous, looking for her here!

227
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,970
Where are they? I don't know.

228
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:12,101
I haven't seen them in two days.

229
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,737
There's a Miss Shu Lien here to see you.

230
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,327
Miss is busy right now.

231
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:09,787
I'll tell her.

232
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,627
Show her in.

233
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:21,838
This spells trouble.

234
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,969
I have a guest.

235
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,480
This way please.

236
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:41,741
I've missed you.

237
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:42,741
How so?

238
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:44,571
I'm bored...

239
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:52,922
You're doing calligraphy?

240
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:56,472
I'll write your name.

241
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,003
Just for fun.

242
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:27,006
I never realized my name looks like "sword".

243
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:32,006
You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

244
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,467
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

245
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,177
Please.

246
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:44,978
Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near.

247
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:47,278
You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.

248
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:51,228
I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better.

249
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:56,369
My parents are arranging everything.

250
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:00,669
The Gous are a very powerful family.

251
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,000
My marrying one will be good for my father's career.

252
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,840
You are fortunate to marry into such a noble family.

253
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,381
Am I?

254
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:13,761
I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.

255
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:15,421
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

256
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,142
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

257
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,352
But to be free to live my own life,

258
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:25,733
to choose whom I love...

259
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:29,363
That is true happiness.

260
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:32,103
Do you think so? Let me tell you a story...

261
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,874
About you and Li Mu Bai?

262
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,284
Yes.

263
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:38,624
Did you know I was once engaged to be married?

264
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:40,244
No, really?

265
00:26:40,414 --> 00:26:42,214
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

266
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:45,465
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.

267
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:47,835
One day, while in battle,

268
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:52,005
he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

269
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:55,766
After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.

270
00:26:55,976 --> 00:26:58,016
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

271
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,646
But how could we dishonor

272
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,437
Meng's memory?

273
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:05,477
So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.

274
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,897
But I have never tasted it.

275
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:13,658
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

276
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:19,208
I am not an aristocrat, as you are...

277
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:24,009
but I must still respect a woman's duties.

278
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:26,299
Don't distance us.

279
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,630
From now on, let's be like sisters.

280
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,600
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.

281
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:15,685
What a godforsaken place!

282
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:20,695
Can't your father be appointed closer to civilization?

283
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:24,646
Jen...

284
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,066
are you listening to me?

285
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,760
Let's go.

286
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,763
Who are you?

287
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:26,013
Wait! I'm a friend!

288
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:32,484
I don't care about your sword.

289
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:34,774
Why were you spying on the Yus?

290
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:37,774
I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

291
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:41,365
I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

292
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:45,815
Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

293
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:50,115
She must have come with them when they transferred here.

294
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:54,706
But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.

295
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,876
This Jade Fox is a woman? Yes.

296
00:29:57,047 --> 00:30:00,047
Then leave her to me.

297
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,757
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.

298
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,467
My wife was quite a martial arts expert.

299
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,018
Jade Fox killed her.

300
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,178
So you see,

301
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,478
this is personal. Leave her to me.

302
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:14,599
It's ready.

303
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,269
I'm ready for anything!

304
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:19,899
Father gets first dip.

305
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,410
They're gone!

306
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,780
What does it say?

307
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,160
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."

308
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:35,011
Good! The fox is out of her hole!

309
00:30:39,892 --> 00:30:42,512
Shu Lien, look who's here.

310
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:51,732
Sir Te believes it's a ploy to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

311
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:55,183
But something is going on at the Yu household.

312
00:30:55,363 --> 00:30:57,023
What have you discovered?

313
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:10,795
Jade Fox?

314
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:12,125
Impossible!

315
00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:15,005
You'd always suspected she'd fled to the West.

316
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:17,636
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!

317
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,756
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?

318
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:27,176
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.

319
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,807
Be careful.

320
00:31:30,987 --> 00:31:33,557
Sir Te requires discretion.

321
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,978
Official business is difficult enough.

322
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:39,688
Don't let personal feelings make it worse.

323
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,078
And I don't know... even this poster...

324
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:45,119
could be some sort of trap.

325
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:49,249
Did you see who posted it?

326
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:50,589
No.

327
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,960
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

328
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,220
On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.

329
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,010
Were you involved?

330
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,171
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.

331
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:04,191
I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.

332
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,901
Have you questioned him yet?

333
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:08,391
No, not yet...

334
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,892
But your men are watching over Yu's compound?

335
00:32:12,112 --> 00:32:14,822
No, I'd already sent them home.

336
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,522
You can blame me for losing the sword,

337
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,913
but please trust that I'll get it back soon

338
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,073
using my own methods.

339
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,913
That's not what I meant.

340
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:27,794
I don't care about the sword.

341
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:31,914
What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?

342
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:35,874
I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.

343
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:39,095
Then, why did you come?

344
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:44,055
Well, we had talked...

345
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:49,226
Pardon my intrusion. Master Li,

346
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:51,196
your room is ready.

347
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:54,157
Thank you.

348
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:57,367
Please, lead the way.

349
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:10,668
The Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.

350
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:12,999
Still no sign of her.

351
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,480
Enough! Show yourself!

352
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,150
Tsai...

353
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:29,861
You dog!

354
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:31,861
You will pay for your stubbornness!

355
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,991
That's what you think, old witch!

356
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:38,201
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.

357
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,862
But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.

358
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:42,542
Father!

359
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,872
Let me avenge my mother's death!

360
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:47,293
You'll soon end up like her, you little whore!

361
00:33:47,463 --> 00:33:49,793
You'll pay for that!

362
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:14,683
She's going to paralyze you!

363
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:22,653
May!

364
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:33,415
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!

365
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:37,955
An ambush!

366
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:43,836
Father, are you all right?

367
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:47,796
Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago.

368
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:50,426
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

369
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:53,467
You don't remember me...

370
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:57,647
But you should remember my master.

371
00:35:57,818 --> 00:35:59,978
You infiltrated Wudan while I was away.

372
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,398
You stole our secret manual

373
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,608
and poisoned our master!

374
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:07,698
Now it's time for you to pay!

375
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:10,909
Your master underestimated us women.

376
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,079
Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he would never teach me.

377
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:17,049
He deserved to die by a woman's hand!

378
00:36:58,214 --> 00:37:00,964
You stole the secrets of Wudan's highest martial arts.

379
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,095
But after ten years of training your moves are still undisciplined.

380
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,725
And today,

381
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:08,595
under a Wudan sword...

382
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:09,466
you will die!

383
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:18,146
Disciple, we'll kill them all!

384
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:19,317
Let's go!

385
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:21,117
Another one!

386
00:37:21,577 --> 00:37:23,617
I must get rid of Tsai!

387
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:30,988
Who are you?

388
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,368
Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?

389
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:38,589
What's it to you?

390
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,299
My name is Li Mu Bai.

391
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,879
The Green Destiny is mine.

392
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:55,681
Jade Fox can't be your master.

393
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:57,771
Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?

394
00:37:57,951 --> 00:37:58,781
I'm just playing around.

395
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,362
Tell me, who is your master?

396
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:30,645
Let's go! We must kill them!

397
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,066
Father!

398
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,439
This is Tsai?

399
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,439
My father.

400
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:11,149
Police inspector from Shaan.

401
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,900
This should be reported to Governor Yu.

402
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,230
The victim is an officer.

403
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,980
You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound?

404
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:25,871
I'd bet my life on it!

405
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,042
Come with me.

406
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:37,422
This needs to be resolved, and quickly.

407
00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:41,842
I'll get into the Yu household and get her.

408
00:39:42,023 --> 00:39:43,813
I'll ferret out Fox and her gang.

409
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:45,223
We must be careful.

410
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:48,813
Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.

411
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:52,074
Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.

412
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,984
It might get Sir Te in trouble.

413
00:39:55,824 --> 00:39:57,324
This is a delicate matter.

414
00:39:57,825 --> 00:40:00,665
Sir Te, can you find some excuse

415
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:03,745
to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

416
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,006
What do you have in mind?

417
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:11,756
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.

418
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:19,767
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.

419
00:40:20,437 --> 00:40:23,607
She's being so considerate.

420
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,688
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.

421
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,648
I heard Sir Te lost something.

422
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:33,028
And now Madam Te's not feeling well...

423
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,569
We know who stole the missing item.

424
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:43,669
If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue

425
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,750
the matter no further.

426
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
That's good.

427
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,470
Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves.

428
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:52,211
It's very embarrassing.

429
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:56,381
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes...

430
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:59,721
that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.

431
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:04,062
But don't be too lenient.

432
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:07,322
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer

433
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:08,943
who turned up in Peking.

434
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:11,943
A murderer?

435
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:12,983
Yes,

436
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:17,243
the very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.

437
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:18,244
Last night,

438
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:21,164
she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.

439
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:24,174
A female criminal! Now that's news!

440
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:27,374
You say she killed a policeman?

441
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,175
Yes, from the West.

442
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:32,925
He went undercover, and followed her here.

443
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:34,886
Maybe the murderer

444
00:41:35,056 --> 00:41:37,636
and the thief are the same.

445
00:41:37,816 --> 00:41:38,726
I doubt that.

446
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:40,436
This thief...

447
00:41:42,607 --> 00:41:44,017
is very unusual.

448
00:41:44,697 --> 00:41:46,437
And most likely smarter than a mere killer.

449
00:41:59,628 --> 00:42:00,738
Greetings, Sir Te.

450
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,539
Hello, Madam Yu.

451
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,879
This is Li Mu Bai,

452
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:07,509
the renowned swordsman.

453
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,259
Delighted to meet you.

454
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,140
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

455
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,800
Congratulations.

456
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:33,622
Why don't you come in?

457
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:35,412
I'm standing guard.

458
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,293
Come in. It's cold.

459
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:45,294
Come in.

460
00:42:45,474 --> 00:42:48,474
We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together.

461
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,247
Isn't it a bit late to be out?

462
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,257
You've brought me the sword?

463
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,458
I do as I please.

464
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:26,888
Where is your master?

465
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:28,218
What's it to you?

466
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,542
Had enough flying?

467
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:01,462
You've got potential.

468
00:44:01,632 --> 00:44:05,882
You've studied the Wudan manual but you don't understand it.

469
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:11,393
You need a real master.

470
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,933
Do you think you are a real master?

471
00:44:14,104 --> 00:44:17,894
Like most things, I am nothing.

472
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:19,944
It's the same for this sword.

473
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:22,524
All of it is simply a state of mind.

474
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:25,405
Stop talking like a monk!

475
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:26,525
Just fight!

476
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,415
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

477
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:29,245
On guard!

478
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:45,887
Real sharpness comes without effort.

479
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,239
No growth.

480
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,570
Without assistance.

481
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,490
No action.

482
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,120
Without reaction.

483
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,210
No desire without restraint.

484
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,000
Now give yourself up and find yourself again.

485
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:18,881
There is a lesson for you.

486
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:25,142
Go ahead.

487
00:45:27,272 --> 00:45:28,022
Why should I?

488
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:32,312
You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny,

489
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:35,403
but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.

490
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:39,773
Why do you want to teach me?

491
00:45:41,414 --> 00:45:43,324
I've always wanted a disciple

492
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:46,994
worthy of Wudan's secrets.

493
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:50,784
And if I use them to kill you?

494
00:45:51,385 --> 00:45:54,465
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

495
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:58,635
Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

496
00:46:00,596 --> 00:46:02,726
Wudan is a whorehouse!

497
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,006
Keep your lessons!

498
00:46:22,998 --> 00:46:24,458
You're home late...

499
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:26,038
or should I say early?

500
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,159
Why are you still here? You killed a policeman.

501
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,089
You should leave!

502
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,760
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

503
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,220
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.

504
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:44,140
Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?

505
00:46:45,021 --> 00:46:47,941
You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me.

506
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:53,191
You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.

507
00:46:54,282 --> 00:46:56,192
Denied your talent...

508
00:46:56,372 --> 00:46:58,822
As master and disciple we will rule.

509
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:00,112
I'll never live as a thief!

510
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,033
You're already a thief.

511
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:03,493
That was just for fun.

512
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:05,663
How can I leave? Where would I go?

513
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:08,333
Wherever we want.

514
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:10,293
We'll get rid of anyone in our way.

515
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:11,384
Even your father.

516
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:12,664
Shut up!

517
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:16,754
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed.

518
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,674
Exciting, isn't it?

519
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,395
I owe you nothing.

520
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:28,645
Yes, you do!

521
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:33,196
You are still my disciple.

522
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:44,797
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual?

523
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:47,868
You couldn't even decipher the symbols!

524
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:52,428
I studied the diagrams.

525
00:47:52,598 --> 00:47:54,548
But you hid the details!

526
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,339
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.

527
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:00,019
You know...

528
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:03,479
you've gone as far as you can go.

529
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,850
I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.

530
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,320
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai,

531
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:16,161
I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.

532
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:20,531
Master...

533
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,332
I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.

534
00:48:26,132 --> 00:48:28,622
You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.

535
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:33,133
But once I realized I could surpass you,

536
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:34,933
I became so frightened!

537
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:38,553
Everything fell apart.

538
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:40,884
I had no one to guide me,

539
00:48:42,104 --> 00:48:44,104
no one to learn from.

540
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,024
Believe me,

541
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:50,275
I've a lesson or two left to teach you!

542
00:50:02,363 --> 00:50:03,313
The sword is back...

543
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:05,573
Are you happy?

544
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:08,694
I admit...

545
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:11,404
getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.

546
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:14,574
But it's not your sword anymore.

547
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,905
You gave it to Sir Te.

548
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:19,575
True.

549
00:50:20,425 --> 00:50:23,755
But I must borrow it for one last mission.

550
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:26,956
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

551
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:35,396
Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?

552
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:38,977
My job was to get the sword back, without embarrassing anyone.

553
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:41,907
I wasn't about to ruin

554
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:44,448
her life, or her father's.

555
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:47,368
You did your job well.

556
00:50:47,538 --> 00:50:50,158
But, this girl...

557
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,569
I saw her last night.

558
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:57,039
I knew she would intrigue you.

559
00:50:57,759 --> 00:50:59,579
She needs direction...

560
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,840
and training.

561
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:06,050
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.

562
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,350
In any case, it will all be over soon.

563
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:12,221
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.

564
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:15,811
That's not for her.

565
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:18,361
She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.

566
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:21,112
But Wudan does not accept women.

567
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,402
For her, they might make an exception.

568
00:51:24,572 --> 00:51:28,492
If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.

569
00:51:29,123 --> 00:51:31,873
It's not our affair.

570
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:36,833
Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.

571
00:51:40,094 --> 00:51:42,054
I thought by giving away the sword,

572
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,174
I could escape the Giang Hu world.

573
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:49,015
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

574
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:52,425
I wish there were something more

575
00:51:52,606 --> 00:51:54,816
I could do to help you.

576
00:52:00,987 --> 00:52:03,447
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

577
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:26,259
Lo?

578
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:27,929
Jen!

579
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:42,691
You shouldn't have come.

580
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:48,492
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days...

581
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,412
it took me a while to get in here.

582
00:52:50,582 --> 00:52:52,492
I can't wait any longer.

583
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:55,292
I was wrong to let you go.

584
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,043
Come back with me.

585
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:59,623
You'll be happy in the desert.

586
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,633
You'll be free there.

587
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,804
You've been looking for me all this time?

588
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,047
Jen...

589
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:32,837
Stop playing with it.

590
00:53:33,387 --> 00:53:35,427
I won't break it.

591
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,700
It's Dark Cloud!

592
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:07,331
Dark Cloud is coming!

593
00:54:22,853 --> 00:54:25,313
Lower the shade, don't let them see you!

594
00:54:43,585 --> 00:54:45,705
Don't touch the women!

595
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:16,869
Let's go!

596
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:36,671
Come get your comb.

597
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:28,907
Hurry back to your mother.

598
00:57:30,144 --> 00:57:31,854
She's mine!

599
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:33,014
Leave her to me!

600
00:57:43,535 --> 00:57:45,075
Come and get it!

601
00:57:45,246 --> 00:57:47,036
Give me back my comb!

602
00:57:48,576 --> 00:57:50,036
Let's stop a moment.

603
00:57:50,206 --> 00:57:51,866
Give it back!

604
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:54,656
You're tired. You need rest.

605
00:58:00,757 --> 00:58:03,707
Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here.

606
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,679
Well, there used to be!

607
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,150
What's your name?

608
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,360
I'm Lo.

609
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:27,660
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

610
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,660
I'm not that tall or big,

611
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:31,621
but I'm quick as lightning.

612
00:58:44,602 --> 00:58:45,842
My comb!

613
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:24,783
If you like that arrow, I can make you a bow.

614
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,244
Great for hunting wild chicken.

615
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,124
They're delicious.

616
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:37,085
You need to eat. Understand?

617
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:41,215
Then you'll have the strength to fight.

618
01:00:43,186 --> 01:00:44,186
Understand?

619
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:56,067
You're eating too fast.

620
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:57,647
Slowly.

621
01:03:03,342 --> 01:03:04,832
You've got quite a temper.

622
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:06,962
It's better this way...

623
01:03:13,513 --> 01:03:14,973
You coward!

624
01:03:17,853 --> 01:03:19,893
Still in a bad mood?

625
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,143
At least you're speaking.

626
01:03:22,694 --> 01:03:23,894
What's your name?

627
01:03:26,694 --> 01:03:29,024
I didn't think the Hans had names like that.

628
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:08,659
Relax.

629
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:12,319
If I had wanted to, I would already have done it.

630
01:04:13,459 --> 01:04:15,829
You must be dying for a bath.

631
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:19,160
Fresh water's hard to get here.

632
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,080
But I managed to bring some up.

633
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,750
You can wear my clothes when you're done.

634
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:26,931
They're clean.

635
01:04:42,863 --> 01:04:44,193
Don't worry.

636
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:50,613
I'll sing, so you'll know where I am.

637
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:53,914
After the bath, you'll be calmer.

638
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:57,704
No more hitting on the head!

639
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:12,913
All this trouble for a comb?

640
01:06:13,963 --> 01:06:15,423
It's mine.

641
01:06:16,543 --> 01:06:19,633
It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

642
01:06:21,054 --> 01:06:24,004
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.

643
01:06:25,604 --> 01:06:27,644
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

644
01:06:30,815 --> 01:06:31,975
I'm sorry...

645
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,635
I guessed wrong.

646
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:35,555
I thought you were a Han.

647
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:39,866
Give me back my comb.

648
01:06:43,786 --> 01:06:46,026
I don't take orders from anyone.

649
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:53,958
Give it back.

650
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:14,047
One night...

651
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:18,847
when I was a boy, I saw a thousand shooting stars.

652
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:22,887
I thought, "Where did they all go?"

653
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:27,398
I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone.

654
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:33,518
I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.

655
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,359
I've been riding in the desert ever since.

656
01:08:38,909 --> 01:08:41,399
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.

657
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,670
He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.

658
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,740
Out here, you always fight for survival.

659
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:53,591
You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.

660
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:56,961
Slowly, your gang becomes your family.

661
01:08:57,852 --> 01:09:01,012
All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people

662
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:03,432
and make my life easier.

663
01:09:04,272 --> 01:09:06,812
So you are still that little boy

664
01:09:06,983 --> 01:09:09,273
looking for shooting stars.

665
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:12,393
I am a man.

666
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:17,073
And now I've found the brightest star of all.

667
01:09:39,306 --> 01:09:41,216
Your father's men are looking for you.

668
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,170
They're still out there, circling closer.

669
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:18,551
Let them look.

670
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:22,101
It is trouble for me.

671
01:10:24,941 --> 01:10:26,571
Don't send me back.

672
01:10:29,612 --> 01:10:31,192
You must decide.

673
01:10:31,372 --> 01:10:34,242
You might get tired of this life.

674
01:10:36,293 --> 01:10:39,073
You might begin to miss your family.

675
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,873
If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.

676
01:10:43,044 --> 01:10:45,334
She would miss us.

677
01:10:50,474 --> 01:10:51,464
Jen...

678
01:10:53,145 --> 01:10:55,015
I want you to be mine forever.

679
01:10:56,105 --> 01:10:57,685
I will make my mark on the world.

680
01:10:57,855 --> 01:11:00,315
I will earn your parents respect.

681
01:11:01,396 --> 01:11:03,056
We have a legend.

682
01:11:03,236 --> 01:11:05,606
Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain,

683
01:11:05,776 --> 01:11:07,906
God will grant his wish.

684
01:11:08,406 --> 01:11:13,236
Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.

685
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:14,957
He didn't die.

686
01:11:15,377 --> 01:11:17,247
He wasn't even hurt.

687
01:11:17,627 --> 01:11:20,377
He floated away, far away, never to return.

688
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:24,958
He knew his wish had come true.

689
01:11:25,838 --> 01:11:28,128
If you believe, it will happen.

690
01:11:29,009 --> 01:11:31,049
The elders say,

691
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:34,139
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true".

692
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:46,901
Keep it safe.

693
01:11:48,031 --> 01:11:50,991
Return it to me when we are together again.

694
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:54,401
I will.

695
01:12:02,092 --> 01:12:05,672
If you don't, I'll come after you.

696
01:12:06,383 --> 01:12:09,223
And I won't let you off so easy.

697
01:12:21,115 --> 01:12:24,525
Wherever I went someone always recognized me.

698
01:12:25,195 --> 01:12:27,105
I really tried.

699
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:32,236
Later, I heard you came to Peking.

700
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:34,746
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

701
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,046
So I came.

702
01:12:37,717 --> 01:12:39,667
I can't let you marry.

703
01:12:43,717 --> 01:12:44,917
Go.

704
01:12:45,977 --> 01:12:47,087
Jen...

705
01:12:49,978 --> 01:12:51,938
Don't ever come back.

706
01:12:52,108 --> 01:12:53,678
So it's over?

707
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:56,219
Yes.

708
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,280
We heard noises.

709
01:13:14,461 --> 01:13:16,091
It was just a cat.

710
01:13:33,773 --> 01:13:36,013
You think Jade Fox will show up?

711
01:13:36,193 --> 01:13:38,103
She's out there,

712
01:13:38,693 --> 01:13:41,533
but I doubt she'll show herself.

713
01:13:41,704 --> 01:13:43,244
We'll keep our eyes open.

714
01:13:43,414 --> 01:13:44,244
Sooner or later,

715
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:47,624
she'll come for the girl.

716
01:14:06,517 --> 01:14:07,297
Jen!

717
01:14:16,988 --> 01:14:18,188
Come with me!

718
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,130
You're mine! Come with me to the desert!

719
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:50,141
Jen!

720
01:14:50,562 --> 01:14:52,772
Come with me to Xin Jiang!

721
01:14:58,242 --> 01:14:58,902
Tell me.

722
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:00,353
Where is Jade Fox?

723
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:02,243
Come with me. Hurry!

724
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:08,713
You thought she'd give it all up and go back West with you?

725
01:15:11,134 --> 01:15:12,504
She's mine.

726
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:13,954
Either way,

727
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:17,754
you are no good to her dead. With the Gou and Yu clans

728
01:15:17,925 --> 01:15:20,765
hunting you, you'll soon be in their hands.

729
01:15:21,095 --> 01:15:22,425
I don't care anymore.

730
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:27,725
If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that.

731
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,856
Don't you want to see her again?

732
01:15:35,237 --> 01:15:36,237
All right.

733
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,867
I'll write you an introduction. Take it to Wudan.

734
01:15:39,037 --> 01:15:40,947
Wait there for news from me.

735
01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:44,528
All right.

736
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,719
When will this end?

737
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:58,759
They take it, they put it back, they take it again.

738
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:02,929
My home is turning into a warehouse.

739
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,020
Come in.

740
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:07,100
Speak!

741
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,650
Jen has run away!

742
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,140
Gou found the wedding chamber empty.

743
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:14,071
Governor Yu requests your assistance.

744
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:15,861
You know the Giang Hu underworld.

745
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:19,781
He wants to find her, and keep her from harm.

746
01:16:21,122 --> 01:16:24,742
Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't worry.

747
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:44,684
What can I serve you?

748
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:48,265
This cup is dirty.

749
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:04,327
Hello.

750
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:08,417
What's your name?

751
01:17:09,427 --> 01:17:10,627
Long.

752
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:14,298
It's young Master Long.

753
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:15,638
My apologies!

754
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:18,648
I'm Iron Eagle Sung

755
01:17:18,808 --> 01:17:20,348
and this is my brother in arms,

756
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:22,269
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

757
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:23,849
What brings you to Huai An,

758
01:17:24,029 --> 01:17:26,399
and where are you headed, Master Long?

759
01:17:27,489 --> 01:17:28,949
Anywhere there's action.

760
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:33,690
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.

761
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,570
Don't bother.

762
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:40,741
You don't seem to understand.

763
01:17:42,751 --> 01:17:44,251
So what if I don't?

764
01:17:45,881 --> 01:17:49,301
We have ways of helping you to understand.

765
01:17:58,023 --> 01:18:00,853
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

766
01:18:03,273 --> 01:18:05,023
He is my defeated foe!

767
01:18:24,046 --> 01:18:25,676
Have some tea.

768
01:18:54,789 --> 01:18:56,069
Shu Lien...

769
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:59,659
The things we touch have no permanence.

770
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,630
My master would say...

771
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,170
there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.

772
01:19:08,351 --> 01:19:12,301
Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.

773
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:17,011
Not everything is an illusion.

774
01:19:17,192 --> 01:19:18,932
My hand...

775
01:19:19,112 --> 01:19:21,352
wasn't that real?

776
01:19:23,322 --> 01:19:27,782
Your hand, rough and callused from practice...

777
01:19:27,953 --> 01:19:31,073
All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.

778
01:19:34,624 --> 01:19:39,374
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons,

779
01:19:39,544 --> 01:19:43,714
full of corruption...

780
01:19:44,965 --> 01:19:47,675
I tried sincerely to give it up

781
01:19:47,845 --> 01:19:50,085
but I have brought us only trouble.

782
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:52,845
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.

783
01:19:53,436 --> 01:19:56,396
You're right, but I don't know what to do.

784
01:19:56,566 --> 01:19:58,776
I want to be with you...

785
01:20:01,157 --> 01:20:02,817
just like this.

786
01:20:04,787 --> 01:20:07,487
It gives me a sense of peace.

787
01:20:25,179 --> 01:20:26,509
Please follow me.

788
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,850
I want a clean room. We have plenty.

789
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,640
Your order?

790
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:37,361
Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs,

791
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:40,021
a little starchy, but keep the sauce light,

792
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:43,321
shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine.

793
01:20:44,202 --> 01:20:46,612
I have to order from a bigger restaurant.

794
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:47,862
Hurry then.

795
01:21:31,297 --> 01:21:32,327
That's him.

796
01:21:41,348 --> 01:21:44,468
I am Iron Arm Mi.

797
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,809
I heard a true master has arrived. I have come to seek a lesson.

798
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,660
You asked for it!

799
01:22:24,103 --> 01:22:25,843
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

800
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:42,905
You have amazing technique!

801
01:22:43,085 --> 01:22:45,405
I am Flying Saber.

802
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:48,585
Are you related to Southern Crane?

803
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:51,836
Southern Duck? I don't eat anything with two feet.

804
01:22:52,006 --> 01:22:54,216
Who could remember such long-winded names?

805
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:57,757
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,

806
01:22:57,927 --> 01:23:00,687
and you don't know his master Southern Crane?

807
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:03,057
Who are you?

808
01:23:04,147 --> 01:23:08,147
I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

809
01:23:09,738 --> 01:23:10,938
Gou?

810
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,238
I hate that name.

811
01:23:13,408 --> 01:23:14,948
It makes me puke!

812
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:18,189
Too bad you're named Gou.

813
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:20,649
You'll be the first to feel my sword today.

814
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:43,222
Hold it!

815
01:23:44,192 --> 01:23:46,862
Don't you know Monk Jing?

816
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,602
A monk, in a place like this? You need a lesson!

817
01:23:49,783 --> 01:23:51,443
Who are you?

818
01:23:52,573 --> 01:23:53,813
Who am I?

819
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:55,233
I am...

820
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:02,994
I am the Invincible Sword Goddess.

821
01:24:04,674 --> 01:24:06,544
Armed with the incredible...

822
01:24:06,714 --> 01:24:08,204
Green Destiny.

823
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:16,715
Be you Li or Southern Crane...

824
01:24:18,306 --> 01:24:19,936
lower your head...

825
01:24:20,106 --> 01:24:21,306
and ask for mercy.

826
01:24:28,107 --> 01:24:30,987
I am the desert dragon.

827
01:24:39,918 --> 01:24:42,538
I leave no trace.

828
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:56,310
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.

829
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,600
Tomorrow...

830
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:03,311
I'll kick over Wudan Mountain!

831
01:25:17,543 --> 01:25:20,573
We politely asked for a friendly match,

832
01:25:20,753 --> 01:25:22,993
but she showed no respect, and attacked us.

833
01:25:23,173 --> 01:25:26,703
Everyone came by to teach her a lesson.

834
01:25:26,884 --> 01:25:29,124
Her sword was just too powerful.

835
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:30,544
I've traveled everywhere,

836
01:25:30,724 --> 01:25:32,764
but never met anyone so uncivilized.

837
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:37,144
She kept accusing me of being Gou Jun Pei's brother.

838
01:25:37,315 --> 01:25:40,265
Who is this Gou, anyway?

839
01:25:41,855 --> 01:25:43,025
Her husband.

840
01:25:55,787 --> 01:25:57,697
We're close to your headquarters.

841
01:25:57,877 --> 01:25:59,247
Go home and check in.

842
01:25:59,417 --> 01:26:00,667
What about you?

843
01:26:00,837 --> 01:26:03,127
I'll look around and catch up later.

844
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:04,168
Not a bad idea.

845
01:26:04,338 --> 01:26:08,258
Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.

846
01:26:34,621 --> 01:26:35,951
Mistress, you're back.

847
01:26:41,752 --> 01:26:43,172
It's you!

848
01:26:44,262 --> 01:26:45,722
How is everything here?

849
01:26:45,883 --> 01:26:46,673
Fine.

850
01:26:46,843 --> 01:26:48,503
You've been gone a while.

851
01:26:48,683 --> 01:26:50,143
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

852
01:26:50,303 --> 01:26:52,303
Your wife was due? Yeah, a baby girl.

853
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:53,223
Good!

854
01:26:53,393 --> 01:26:56,143
I'll be happy if she's half as strong as you.

855
01:26:56,854 --> 01:26:57,934
Mrs. Wu...

856
01:26:58,694 --> 01:26:59,974
You're back!

857
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:02,444
How's the arm? Still sore? Much better.

858
01:27:03,535 --> 01:27:06,365
You've been gone so long.

859
01:27:07,575 --> 01:27:09,735
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.

860
01:27:10,955 --> 01:27:12,865
I'll go and make up his room!

861
01:27:43,069 --> 01:27:44,399
Sister Shu Lien...

862
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,750
Here you must be in proper attire.

863
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:58,460
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying.

864
01:27:59,761 --> 01:28:02,841
I'll give them to you.

865
01:28:04,391 --> 01:28:07,261
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

866
01:28:09,432 --> 01:28:10,382
You, sister...

867
01:28:14,983 --> 01:28:16,523
Look at the trouble you've caused.

868
01:28:16,693 --> 01:28:19,443
Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.

869
01:28:19,613 --> 01:28:22,323
If you think of me as your sister,

870
01:28:22,743 --> 01:28:26,073
let me give you some sisterly advice.

871
01:28:26,244 --> 01:28:29,334
You can run from marriage, but not your parents.

872
01:28:30,414 --> 01:28:31,994
They forced me to marry!

873
01:28:33,255 --> 01:28:36,045
Go back to them first.

874
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:38,205
Then you can decide about Lo.

875
01:28:39,215 --> 01:28:40,295
You know about Lo?

876
01:28:49,106 --> 01:28:52,306
He really loves you.

877
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:57,067
Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.

878
01:29:01,238 --> 01:29:02,568
Where is he now?

879
01:29:02,998 --> 01:29:04,618
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.

880
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:10,579
He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

881
01:29:11,589 --> 01:29:14,209
You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving!

882
01:29:14,589 --> 01:29:16,919
How dare you accuse us!

883
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:19,380
I always knew you had stolen the sword!

884
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:22,010
I've done nothing but protect you and your family.

885
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:24,470
And you've repaid me with nothing but contempt.

886
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,640
Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.

887
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:30,981
We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all!

888
01:29:31,151 --> 01:29:33,021
You're no sister of mine!

889
01:29:35,612 --> 01:29:36,892
What do I care?

890
01:29:37,822 --> 01:29:40,112
You were never a real friend anyway.

891
01:29:40,492 --> 01:29:42,202
But I wonder...

892
01:29:42,372 --> 01:29:44,442
how long could you last as my enemy?

893
01:29:47,003 --> 01:29:47,993
Put the sword down!

894
01:29:59,474 --> 01:30:00,254
Jen!

895
01:30:03,935 --> 01:30:06,145
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

896
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:19,736
Fine... the friendship is over.

897
01:33:33,669 --> 01:33:34,779
Don't touch it!

898
01:33:35,459 --> 01:33:37,039
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

899
01:33:38,589 --> 01:33:40,409
Come and get it if you can.

900
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:43,250
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.

901
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,040
Don't be a sore loser.

902
01:33:51,521 --> 01:33:53,761
Go ahead. Take your pick.

903
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:55,511
I'll wait.

904
01:33:58,231 --> 01:33:59,311
Go ahead.

905
01:34:54,338 --> 01:34:55,708
Give me the sword.

906
01:34:58,218 --> 01:34:58,828
Take it!

907
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:04,799
Stop it!

908
01:35:08,599 --> 01:35:10,429
You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

909
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,100
Not another lecture!

910
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,100
On guard!

911
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,310
Let's end this here.

912
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:18,480
Only the sword will settle this.

913
01:35:54,775 --> 01:35:58,905
I only let you go because I wanted to see the real you.

914
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:08,036
What do you know about a true heart?

915
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:51,268
What do you want?

916
01:37:51,738 --> 01:37:53,978
What I've always wanted, to teach you.

917
01:38:27,482 --> 01:38:28,512
All right.

918
01:38:29,192 --> 01:38:31,772
If you can take back the sword in three moves,

919
01:38:31,952 --> 01:38:33,362
I'll go with you.

920
01:38:38,123 --> 01:38:38,823
Give it back!

921
01:38:38,993 --> 01:38:40,953
Kneel! Never!

922
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:43,493
Then you have no use for the sword.

923
01:39:57,872 --> 01:40:00,832
Sooner or later they'd drag you back to Peking.

924
01:40:01,633 --> 01:40:04,993
Your parents will never accept you again.

925
01:40:08,473 --> 01:40:09,553
But why go home?

926
01:40:10,474 --> 01:40:13,504
We've gone this far, we won't stop now.

927
01:40:13,684 --> 01:40:16,094
You'll always be my Lady.

928
01:40:18,895 --> 01:40:21,735
At last, we'll be our own masters.

929
01:40:22,815 --> 01:40:26,025
We'll be happy. That's the most important thing.

930
01:40:26,195 --> 01:40:28,565
All we have left is each other, right?

931
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:35,406
Lie down and rest.

932
01:40:58,779 --> 01:41:01,439
She's crazy. You should have killed her.

933
01:41:01,609 --> 01:41:03,479
I didn't have the heart.

934
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:06,530
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

935
01:42:17,278 --> 01:42:19,648
Is it me or the sword you want?

936
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,460
You've been drugged.

937
01:42:59,573 --> 01:43:01,313
Where is Jade Fox?

938
01:43:43,908 --> 01:43:45,028
What happened?

939
01:43:46,288 --> 01:43:48,828
Jade Fox drugged her.

940
01:43:48,998 --> 01:43:50,458
How did you get here?

941
01:43:52,879 --> 01:43:55,169
We followed Jade Fox.

942
01:44:25,162 --> 01:44:27,572
And so you die.

943
01:44:29,213 --> 01:44:30,873
And so shall you!

944
01:44:39,344 --> 01:44:41,004
A poisoned needle!

945
01:44:44,975 --> 01:44:47,185
You deserve to die,

946
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:50,525
but the life I was hoping to take...

947
01:44:50,865 --> 01:44:53,185
was Jen's.

948
01:44:54,826 --> 01:44:57,066
Ten years I devoted to you.

949
01:44:57,446 --> 01:44:58,946
But you deceived me!

950
01:45:00,916 --> 01:45:02,786
You hid the manual's true meaning.

951
01:45:03,247 --> 01:45:04,787
I never improved...

952
01:45:07,587 --> 01:45:10,127
but your progress was limitless!

953
01:45:11,508 --> 01:45:12,968
You know what poison is?

954
01:45:14,258 --> 01:45:15,588
An eight-year-old girl,

955
01:45:15,758 --> 01:45:18,878
full of deceit. That's poison!

956
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:24,269
Jen!

957
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:28,189
My only family...

958
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:31,310
my only enemy...

959
01:45:40,121 --> 01:45:41,281
You can't die!

960
01:45:41,461 --> 01:45:43,781
Tell us what poison you used!

961
01:45:45,752 --> 01:45:47,162
You can't die!

962
01:45:47,342 --> 01:45:48,422
Tell us the antidote!

963
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,292
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

964
01:45:51,472 --> 01:45:53,262
She used Purple Yin...

965
01:45:54,803 --> 01:45:56,343
Purple Yin poison.

966
01:45:56,513 --> 01:45:58,143
It goes straight to the heart.

967
01:46:00,893 --> 01:46:04,683
It's the same poison she used to kill my master.

968
01:46:06,314 --> 01:46:09,774
My blood will soon reverse its flow.

969
01:46:10,824 --> 01:46:12,534
There is no antidote.

970
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:16,825
That can't be! Everything has an antithesis!

971
01:46:16,995 --> 01:46:19,115
Why not this?

972
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:20,575
The antidote exists.

973
01:46:21,046 --> 01:46:23,246
She taught it to me.

974
01:46:23,666 --> 01:46:25,996
The formula is simple,

975
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:28,326
but it takes time to prepare.

976
01:46:34,307 --> 01:46:35,257
Trust me.

977
01:46:36,597 --> 01:46:38,427
As you have helped me,

978
01:46:38,597 --> 01:46:40,427
let me help him.

979
01:46:42,358 --> 01:46:43,268
All right.

980
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:47,188
Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can.

981
01:46:47,358 --> 01:46:49,738
Take my horse and go to the compound.

982
01:46:49,909 --> 01:46:52,689
Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!

983
01:46:52,869 --> 01:46:55,819
Spare your energy. I'll be back!

984
01:47:25,863 --> 01:47:26,943
Where is Mrs. Wu?

985
01:47:28,693 --> 01:47:29,643
Stop it!

986
01:47:31,323 --> 01:47:34,073
Shu Lien told me to show you this.

987
01:47:35,124 --> 01:47:36,584
Let her in.

988
01:47:50,686 --> 01:47:53,306
Mu Bai, hold on.

989
01:47:57,516 --> 01:47:59,396
Give me some hope.

990
01:48:24,219 --> 01:48:25,329
Shu Lien...

991
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,800
Save your strength.

992
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:33,720
My life is departing.

993
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:37,101
I've only one breath left.

994
01:48:39,611 --> 01:48:42,021
Use it to meditate.

995
01:48:42,692 --> 01:48:45,152
Free yourself from this world

996
01:48:45,322 --> 01:48:47,812
as you have been taught.

997
01:48:48,782 --> 01:48:50,412
Let your soul rise to eternity

998
01:48:50,582 --> 01:48:53,362
with your last breath.

999
01:48:55,213 --> 01:48:56,753
Do not waste it...

1000
01:48:56,923 --> 01:48:58,793
for me.

1001
01:49:01,634 --> 01:49:03,624
I've already wasted my whole life.

1002
01:49:05,554 --> 01:49:08,124
I want to tell you with my last breath...

1003
01:49:10,265 --> 01:49:12,395
I have always loved you.

1004
01:49:48,349 --> 01:49:52,679
I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side...

1005
01:49:53,730 --> 01:49:55,560
as a condemned soul...

1006
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:02,150
than enter heaven without you.

1007
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:05,531
Because of your love...

1008
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:13,121
I will never be a lonely spirit.

1009
01:51:09,068 --> 01:51:10,258
He's gone?

1010
01:51:39,892 --> 01:51:40,922
Bo...

1011
01:51:41,892 --> 01:51:44,722
please take this sword back to Sir Te.

1012
01:51:51,823 --> 01:51:53,863
Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.

1013
01:51:54,283 --> 01:51:55,983
Lo awaits you there.

1014
01:51:57,654 --> 01:51:59,114
Promise me one thing.

1015
01:51:59,664 --> 01:52:02,494
Whatever path you take in this life...

1016
01:52:02,914 --> 01:52:05,074
be true to yourself.

1017
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:02,207
Do you remember the legend of the young man?

1018
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:06,878
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

1019
01:54:13,559 --> 01:54:15,299
Make a wish, Lo.

1020
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:20,680
To be back in the desert, together again.
