00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,603
(motorcycle rumbling)

22
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,075
- Need some help?

23
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,076
- Yeah, please.

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,410
My boss is on his way,

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,371
but I have no idea
what I'm looking at here.

26
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,498
- Yeah, that's all right.

27
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,584
I dabble.

28
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,961
- You fix cars?

29
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,879
I wouldn't have guessed that.

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,089
- Yeah.

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,341
Don't let this suit fool you.

32
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,426
I only wear it 'cause I have to.

33
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,512
All right, let's have a look.

34
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,931
- [Driver] It started smoking
right before I pulled over.

35
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,683
- [Luke] How long
you been out here?

36
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,517
- [Driver] Too long.

37
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,022
- Look, I think you might
have a bad radiator hose.

38
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,399
It happens with
these old trucks.

39
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,819
Now look, this is a
temporary fix, okay?

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,655
So you, your boss, whoever,

41
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,116
you guys gotta go in and get
this thing properly checked out

42
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,742
when you get a chance,
all right?

43
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,286
- Hey, how much should I
tell my boss this cost?

44
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,413
- Don't worry about it.

45
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,918
Feel free to come
by anytime, okay?

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,004
We'll get you all sorted.

47
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,588
- Appreciate it, man.

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,673
- Happy to help.

49
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,803
(motorcycle rumbling)

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,767
- Too pretty.

51
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,812
Ooh, too many issues.

52
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,482
Oh, now you have potential.

53
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,027
- Wait. Do not ruin this
moment of me thinking

54
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,279
that you're finally
on a dating app.

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,739
- But this one
could complete me.

56
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,824
Well, come on.

57
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,995
It's a 1954 Chevy Bel Air

58
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,914
with a 3.5 liter V8 engine.

59
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,083
Oh, I think I'm in love.

60
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,085
- Speaking of love,

61
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,046
the guy who got his
car serviced yesterday,

62
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:55,008
he not-so-subtly
left you his number.

63
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,468
- Which car?

64
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,345
- Oh, just the fact
that you have to

65
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,180
identify him by his car
says more than you know.

66
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,306
- Oh, come.

67
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,516
- Late model Bronco.
- Oh!

68
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,726
- He was cute.

69
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,894
- Not my type.

70
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,230
The car or the guy.

71
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,858
- Jess, you've got to
put yourself out there

72
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,485
and open yourself up to romance.

73
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,655
- I have my job
and I have my cars.

74
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,868
I have my class, which,
ooh, is starting really soon

75
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,952
and I haven't finished prepping.

76
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,912
So see ya.

77
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:30,752
(upbeat music)
(motorcycle rumbling)

78
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,633
- Good morning.

79
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,634
Hey, Mike.

80
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,593
Thank you.

81
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,430
I know.

82
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,891
Morning.

83
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,226
- [Receptionist] Luke?
- Okay.

84
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,268
- [Receptionist] Your shirt.

85
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,021
- Great.

86
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,069
Okay.

87
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,737
Do you mind?

88
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,989
Thank you.

89
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,032
Okay.

90
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,283
Sorry I'm late.

91
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,459
Yeah, hi, Pete. Good morning.

92
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,669
Morning.

93
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,129
I'm sorry, Dad.
Something came up.

94
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,256
- What's with the shirt?

95
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,966
- Fashion. Young guy thing.

96
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,426
- This was a strategy meeting.

97
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,719
It's kind of essential

98
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,179
that the VP of corporate
strategy be here.

99
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,597
- I planned on being here, Dad.

100
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,810
- You were back under a hood.

101
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,478
- There was a kid.

102
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,230
He was stranded on
the side of the road.

103
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,691
I couldn't just leave him there.

104
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,611
- You're a great kid, Luke,
but you need to stay focused.

105
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,655
You belong here, beside me.

106
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,283
Now, come on.

107
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,452
We need to get
back to my office,

108
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,787
review the sales
figures for the quarter.

109
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,372
- What's that?

110
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,166
Are we looking to
acquire Barro's?

111
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,709
- It's a great location.

112
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,461
That would be a
smart acquisition.

113
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,297
- Are you sure you
wanna do that, Dad,

114
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,674
well, considering the history?

115
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,092
- This is the company's future.

116
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,803
And yours.

117
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,014
Now, come on.

118
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,558
(somber music)

119
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,354
(Jess sighs)

120
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,646
- I heard that.

121
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,815
Keep those nerves in check.

122
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,317
- Is it that obvious?

123
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,318
- You're gonna do great.

124
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,611
What's on the docket today?

125
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,321
- We're gonna start
nice and easy.

126
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,530
I want women to feel comfortable

127
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,991
and confident around their cars.

128
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,659
Like how to change a spark plug.

129
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,828
- Well, I already told Eden

130
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,248
to set side part of her summer
break to take your class.

131
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,333
- Really?

132
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,501
- Yes, of course.

133
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,127
And I can't think
of a better person

134
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,712
to learn from than you.

135
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,591
- Yeah, if only I could
stand up in front of the rest

136
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,259
of the class without
breaking into a cold sweat.

137
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,387
- Yeah, about that.

138
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,764
I was posting on
social media about it.

139
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,521
- What did you do?

140
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,772
- It's good for business.

141
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,110
- Hi there.

142
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,152
Hello.

143
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,530
I'm...

144
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,869
Welcome to Barro's Auto Repair.

145
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,664
I'm Jess Barro.

146
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,084
I'm also the head
auto technician here.

147
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,547
So today we're going
to be talking about

148
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:26,219
the oh-so-useful,
but often misunderstood

149
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,973
spark plug.

150
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,057
Let's begin.

151
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,771
Eden, these are fantastic.

152
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,731
- You think so?

153
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,190
- Yeah.

154
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,276
No wonder your mom says
you're the star of the class.

155
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,486
- Star? Not yet.

156
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,280
I really wanna get picked
to be the photographer

157
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,740
for the school's
paper next year.

158
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,825
My teacher said this
project's my chance to shine.

159
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,412
- Well, you, my friend,
are radiant.

160
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,997
Make sure your teacher's
wearing shades.

161
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,124
- Thanks. If only had an
idea of what to shoot.

162
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,585
(horn honks)

163
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,629
- Well, inspiration
is everywhere.

164
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,215
Come on.

165
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,842
Dad, I love it.

166
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,724
Oh, it's beautiful.

167
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,101
- It is?

168
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,269
- With every restoration,

169
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,188
I'm not looking at what is,

170
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,899
I'm looking at what it could be.

171
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,860
So maybe this one says
showroom floor, 1957.

172
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,908
Or hot pink with shag
upholstery and fuzzy dice.

173
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,160
You know, some of
the best ideas come

174
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,746
when you just throw convention
out the window and go for it.

175
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,873
- My daughter's never been one
for sticking to convention.

176
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,250
- Yeah, well, I guess
I was raised right.

177
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,836
(phone buzzing)

178
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,215
- Excuse me. I
have to take this.

179
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,428
- Well, since I am trying
to raise you right,

180
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
we better get going.

181
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,847
You're gonna be late for class.

182
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,932
- Okay.

183
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,016
See you later, Jess.

184
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,393
- All right, see you
later, superstar.

185
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,478
Can't wait to see
what you come up with.

186
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,480
- Can we find some
middle ground here?

187
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,773
I'll get back to you.

188
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,238
I've gotta go out
for a little bit.

189
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,740
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

190
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,367
I just have to
run a few errands.

191
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,451
- Okay.

192
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,577
I'll hold the fort.

193
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,622
(traffic whooshing)

194
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,172
- I don't know how
to say no to the man.

195
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,550
- Do you know how many people
would jump at the opportunity

196
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,677
to work-
- Suffocate behind a desk?

197
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,595
No. I spend more
time changing typos

198
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,222
than transmissions, man.

199
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,142
- Hey, no one spots an I
before an E like my man Luke.

200
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,936
- Thanks, Pete. I
appreciate that.

201
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,732
You know, my granddad used

202
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,525
to give away oil
changes for free?

203
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,110
I loved that.

204
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,237
I loved working with him
and my dad back then.

205
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,199
It just seemed
like it was small,

206
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,702
but we're doing something
of that mattered, you know?

207
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,537
- Look, in marketing,
the first step

208
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,372
to changing minds is
to find common ground.

209
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,125
Figure out how to talk to your
dad in a way he understands.

210
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,626
Then maybe you can
help him understand

211
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,004
your version of the future.

212
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,672
- Whatever that is.

213
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,090
Anyway, I appreciate it, buddy.

214
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,177
I gotta go.

215
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,386
I got a date tonight.

216
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,387
- Good luck.

217
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,139
- Thank you.

218
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,098
You seen my keys?

219
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,354
- Oh, I'm gonna give
Eden a quick call.

220
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,563
I'll meet you at the bar.

221
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,939
- All right, I'll grab a drink.

222
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,649
- Okay.

223
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,366
- Oh, somebody dropped their...

224
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,494
- Keys.

225
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,955
That would be me.

226
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,374
- Luke.

227
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,127
- It's nice to see you, Jess.

228
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,216
- Fancy.

229
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,133
- Company car.

230
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,637
How are you?

231
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,472
- We don't need to
do the small talk.

232
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,767
- No small talk.
Genuinely asking.

233
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,477
- What are you doing
this side of town?

234
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,062
- I was having a drink
with a friend.

235
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,482
On my way to a date.

236
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,984
You look good.

237
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,736
- You look like you sell bonds.

238
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,738
- I'm gonna choose to
take that as a compliment.

239
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,956
- Well, I guess
I'll see you around.

240
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,041
- Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah.

241
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,260
Is there something else?

242
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,261
- My keys.

243
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,472
- Right.

244
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,640
Enjoy your date.

245
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,017
- I'll try my best.

246
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,186
It's good seeing you, Jess.

247
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,064
- Mm-hm.

248
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,573
- Who was that?

249
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,659
- That is Luke.

250
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,120
- The Luke?

251
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,372
Wow. He's...

252
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,208
- I'm gonna get us a table.

253
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,209
- I'm just saying.

254
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,338
Are you ever gonna tell me

255
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,006
what happened between
the two of you?

256
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,467
- No, I already told
you it doesn't matter.

257
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,843
- Clearly it does.

258
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,433
Something about Luke's dad
cutting Ray out of Tune Up Wiz?

259
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,270
- Yeah.

260
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,106
So it was back when Luke
and I were in college

261
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,735
and Luke's grandfather
wanted his dad and my dad

262
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,487
to be partners, take
over the company.

263
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,696
- Okay.

264
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,073
- [Jess] But Luke's dad refused.

265
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:39,908
- Oh.

266
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,956
But you broke off with
Luke because of that?

267
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,416
How does that make any sense?

268
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,710
- So Luke knew his father's plan

269
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,045
to cut my dad
outta the business,

270
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,130
and he said absolutely nothing.

271
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,049
My dad was completely
blindsided.

272
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:59,386
By the time he found out,
there was nothing he could do.

273
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,929
So he started over.

274
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,265
From scratch.

275
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,392
- Yikes.

276
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,938
(upbeat music)

277
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,192
- Hello?

278
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,485
Anybody here?

279
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,569
Hello?

280
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,363
- Oh, hi there.

281
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,364
Sorry.

282
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:25,829
Wait, are you...

283
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,081
You're Wayne LaRoche
from "Road Renegades."

284
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,000
My dad and I used to watch
that show all the time.

285
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,836
- And you are Jessica Barro.

286
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,295
- How do you know my name?

287
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,922
- Well, you did a
restoration for my friend.

288
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,757
A '66 Pontiac GTO in...

289
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,675
- Marina Turquoise.

290
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,718
- That's the one.

291
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,344
Blew me away.

292
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,804
- Thank you.

293
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,556
- Which is why I think
you're perfect for this.

294
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,557
- Perfect for what?

295
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,726
- Hey guys, come on in.

296
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,185
Come on.

297
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,940
Don't worry. They don't bite.

298
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,734
Oh, and none of this
footage is gonna be used

299
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,110
without your permission.

300
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,153
- My permission?

301
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,446
- We're doing
a competition show

302
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,031
for car restorers called
"American High Gear."

303
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,615
Look, Jess, when
I saw your work,

304
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,617
I had to meet the
genius behind it.

305
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,411
- Ah, well, if you could see

306
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,830
behind the grease on my
face, I'd be blushing.

307
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,665
- So I've been
scouting contestants.

308
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,209
And to be frank, it's all men.

309
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,794
I think having
a woman in the show

310
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,755
would inspire a lotta people.

311
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,506
- Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

312
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,468
Sorry, can we just cut the
cameras for a second, please?

313
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,303
- Of course. Yeah.

314
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,266
So we're gonna be shooting

315
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,727
at the Classic
Car Fest in Alden.

316
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,437
Do you know it?

317
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,814
- Yeah. I used to go there
all the time, actually.

318
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,940
- Well, it's gonna be fantastic.

319
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,818
Beautiful cars, packed audience.

320
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,030
And did I mention
top prize is $50,000?

321
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,119
- Look, I really appreciate it,

322
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,580
but not exactly a TV type.

323
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,749
- With all due respect,
that's why you're perfect.

324
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,917
I mean, you're authentic,

325
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,168
you're brilliant at what you do,

326
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,878
and I can't think
of anyone better.

327
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,007
- I appreciate it, but
I'm really busy here.

328
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,801
Good luck with it though.

329
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,761
Sounds fun.

330
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,971
- Sure.

331
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,349
Look, if you change
your mind, call me.

332
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,018
Our contestants are staying
at the Pinefield B&B.

333
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,978
- I used to stay there
all the time as a kid.

334
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,605
- No kidding!

335
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,108
See, it was meant to be.

336
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,410
Jess, I really do
think it'd inspire

337
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,120
a lot of people
seeing you up there.

338
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:36,042
Just think about it, okay?

339
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,255
- Okay.

340
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,381
- You're great.

341
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,551
Okay, guys, let's go.

342
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,137
(gentle music)

343
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,056
Good job, buddy.

344
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,937
(Jess laughs)

345
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,820
- And he's going on and
on about my restorations.

346
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,864
You remember the '66 GTO?

347
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,240
- In Marina Turquoise?

348
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,700
What a beauty.
- What a beauty.

349
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,621
Ah, I don't know, though.
I'd rather not.

350
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,875
Large crowds, I mean,
all those people.

351
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,418
It's not exactly my forte.

352
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,462
- You do whatever
you feel is right.

353
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,630
(gentle music)

354
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,842
- You okay?

355
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,469
Been acting really weird.

356
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,599
- Yeah, it's fine.

357
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,435
- Dad, you can talk to me.

358
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,062
You know that, right?

359
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,815
- That call I got was
from our landlord.

360
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,900
- Okay.

361
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,234
- He's raising our rent.

362
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,447
You know how competitive shop
space is downtown right now.

363
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,782
- Yeah.

364
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,116
- Apparently he's getting offers

365
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,369
from tenants willing
to prepay for the year.

366
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,288
He wants us to do the same.

367
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,123
- That's insane.

368
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,584
- We don't have that
kind of reserve.

369
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,378
- Okay.

370
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,671
What about a loan?

371
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,632
- It's tough.

372
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,096
Hey, I don't want you
to worry about it.

373
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,430
I'll figure it out.

374
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,685
- No, no, it's just
that TV producer today,

375
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,400
he said the winner of the
competition gets $50,000.

376
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,068
Go a long way towards our rent.

377
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,823
- I think it sounds like
a great opportunity.

378
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,034
Not for the garage, but for you.

379
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,664
You are the best
mechanic I know.

380
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,250
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm your father.

381
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,670
- I don't know, Dad.

382
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,756
Being a woman in this
business is hard enough.

383
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,176
I can't handle the pressure
of trying to prove myself.

384
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,595
- You don't have to
prove anything to anyone.

385
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,055
Your work speaks for itself.

386
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,186
I'm just saying.

387
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,022
(gentle music continues)

388
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,441
(bright music)

389
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,655
(kids laughing)

390
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,950
* Baby, baby, I've been
meaning to tell you *

391
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:18,747
* And it's taken
me far too long *

392
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,374
* You make every
day a happy day *

393
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:26,838
* I'm so lucky that
you came along *

394
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,006
* So if I have *

395
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,883
(engine sputtering)

396
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,259
- Hey, there.

397
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,095
Need a hand?

398
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,058
- Not unless you got
a new car battery.

399
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,018
- Oh, I think it's
the alternator.

400
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,644
- I know my way around a car.

401
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,355
It's the battery.

402
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,148
- Hey, would you try
something for me?

403
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,068
- Sure.

404
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,611
- You got a radio
installed in there?

405
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,737
- [Driver] Yeah.
- Okay.

406
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,573
Hop on in, turn her on.

407
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,951
Set the radio to AM and
then find a low frequency,

408
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,203
something with no music.

409
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,454
- [Driver] Okay.

410
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,247
- All right, now step
on the accelerator

411
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,668
and tell me if you hear
a high-pitched noise.

412
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,629
(car ringing)

413
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:11,383
- You know, I think it
might be the alternator.

414
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,636
- That is a handy trick.

415
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,806
I see we both trained
under my granddad.

416
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:20,892
- Luke.

417
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,728
What are you doing here?

418
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,940
- I convinced my dad to
get a Tune Up Wiz booth.

419
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,275
You know, strategy.

420
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,404
Bar charts, pie charts,
various kinds of charts.

421
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:36,157
- Wow. You got that
corporate lingo down.

422
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,117
- You think so?

423
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,118
- Yeah. No.

424
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,620
- Oh, okay.

425
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,205
What are you doing here?

426
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,333
- Uh, I'm just here to
check out classic cars.

427
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,962
- Yeah, it's the festival.

428
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,131
It's been a minute.

429
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,215
Can't help but
remember all the times

430
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,800
we used to run around here.

431
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,969
Hey, do you remember that
time we hopped the fence?

432
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,597
- You know, I'd rather not.

433
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,932
- Sorry. Of course.

434
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,395
Enjoy the festival, Jess.

435
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,479
- Yeah.

436
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,481
Yeah, you too.

437
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,817
Don't get motor oil on
your fancy sports coat.

438
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,196
- What, this old thing?

439
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,906
It was on sale.

440
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,949
- I can tell.

441
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,580
(melancholy music)

442
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,643
(people chattering)

443
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,895
- [Wayne] Jess!

444
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:47,979
You made it.

445
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,356
- Happy to be here.

446
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,982
Looks like you've
got your hands full.

447
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,859
- Oh, you have no idea.

448
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,778
One of our contestants
dropped out just this morning.

449
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,945
- Seriously?

450
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,697
- I wouldn't joke about that.

451
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,908
Thankfully we found
a replacement here

452
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,326
at the festival.

453
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,078
- Well, I guess if you're
looking for car people,

454
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,621
this is the place to find them.

455
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,456
- That's for sure.

456
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,625
Oh, here comes
our replacement now.

457
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,796
- Jess?

458
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,631
- Wait, you're
in the competition?

459
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,809
- So, is everything okay?

460
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,230
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

461
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,314
Me first.

462
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,982
I'm so sorry.

463
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,485
It's just, I didn't realize
he was gonna be on the show too.

464
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,696
- So what's the issue?

465
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,448
- Well, you know,
it's a really long story.

466
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,449
Tragic one, really.

467
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,992
- Wait, wait, wait.

468
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,911
Is this...

469
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:45,829
Are you two...?

470
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,707
- Oh, we're not dating.

471
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,334
- But you were.

472
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,336
Oh, this is television gold.

473
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,005
- No, no, no, no. It's not gold.

474
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,715
It's not even bronze.

475
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,887
- You never said you were
a contestant on the show.

476
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,515
- Well, you said you
were manning a booth.

477
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,850
- I was manning a booth

478
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,226
until this lovely
gentleman approached me

479
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,769
desperate for
another contestant.

480
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,813
But if it's a problem,
I can bow out.

481
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,065
Unless you're not afraid
of a little competition.

482
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,650
- Oh, please.

483
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,111
I'm just afraid you can't
handle losing to me.

484
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,780
(Kevin slurping)

485
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,201
- Oh, don't mind us.

486
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,661
- We're your fellow contestants.

487
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,122
- Is this show about car
restoration or couples therapy?

488
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,793
- I guess it's on.

489
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:34,878
- Oh, it's on.

490
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,255
(upbeat music)

491
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,049
- [Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen!

492
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,675
Take your seats!

493
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,929
"American High Gear" will
begin in five minutes.

494
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,099
(contestants chattering)

495
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,559
- Don't be nervous.

496
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,440
There's no shame
in losing to me.

497
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:59,194
- Look, the only thing I'll
be losing is your number.

498
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,155
(audience laughing)

499
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,699
(upbeat music)

500
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,993
- Welcome to
"American High Gear."

501
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,163
(audience cheering)

502
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,500
The show that separates the
hot rods from the clunkers.

503
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,544
I'm your host, Wayne LaRoche.

504
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,171
Over the next week,

505
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,716
we'll put our contestants'
restoration skills to the test.

506
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,718
The three finalists
will then compete

507
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,054
for a winner-take-all
championship round,

508
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:30,934
which will determine America's
top classic car restorer.

509
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,602
(audience cheering)

510
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,479
Let's meet our
contestants, shall we?

511
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,607
First up, we got Kevin from
White Plains, New York.

512
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:41,528
Next we've got Ike from
Tupelo, Mississippi.

513
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,823
Then we have Clark from
Minnetonka, Minnesota.

514
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,618
Last, but definitely not least,
got Luke and Jess

515
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,994
who both actually hail

516
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,247
from right here
in Detroit, Michigan.

517
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,623
- Happy to be-
- Happy to be-

518
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,125
- I'm so sorry.
- I insist.

519
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,459
- You always insist.

520
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,294
- Ooh, looks like these
two have some history.

521
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,838
(audience cheering)

522
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,297
All right, folks,

523
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,633
before you are some of the
most iconic cars to restore.

524
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,052
From a 1970 Chevy Chevelle

525
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,930
to a 1966 Ford Thunderbird.

526
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,516
- That Thunderbird's
gonna be tough.

527
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,518
Not enough time to
fix a car that bad.

528
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,186
- Maybe for some.

529
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,646
- Now, for our opening round,

530
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,940
the contestants will
have two minutes

531
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,568
to sand down a
randomly-selected car hood

532
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,986
from one of these vehicles.

533
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,237
Now, the winner
will get to choose

534
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,822
which vehicle to restore

535
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,741
and then assign another
vehicle of their choice

536
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,159
to the next ranked competitor.

537
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,119
These will then be the
contestants' vehicles

538
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,204
for the rest of the show.

539
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,458
Contestants, take
your positions.

540
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,002
Go.
You got it.

541
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,046
- Just pretend it's
your computer mouse.

542
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,339
- Appreciate your concern.

543
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,175
(audience cheering)

544
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,637
- Oh, and to up the ante,

545
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,057
we've souped up the motors
in your orbital sanders.

546
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,309
So hold on tight, because
we're moving fast.

547
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,522
Three, two, one, go!

548
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:03,151
(upbeat music)

549
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,196
- They're not even here.

550
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,115
(sanders buzzing)

551
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:12,243
- Woo, it's got some torque.

552
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,412
- I've changed over 100 diapers,

553
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,872
this is nothing.

554
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,123
(sanders buzzing)
(upbeat music continues)

555
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,917
- Man, I'm on fire.

556
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,673
- Oh no.

557
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,049
- I got it.
- It's all right.

558
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,259
No, no, no, no, it's fine.
Do your thing.

559
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,552
It's all the way
on the other side.

560
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,970
- I got it.
- [Luke] You sure?

561
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,222
- [Jess] Yep. Here.
- Okay. Okay.

562
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,306
- Here.
- Turn it off.

563
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,474
- Cable.
- Watch the cord.

564
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,726
- Okay.
- My cord's around your cord.

565
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,311
Jess, Jess, just let it go.
- Luke! Luke!

566
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:39,688
Luke, just stop.

567
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,898
(hood clatters)
(crowd gasping)

568
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,192
- [Wayne] 10 seconds remaining.
10 seconds.

569
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,986
- Here, I got the horse.

570
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,283
- Three, two, one...

571
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,410
That's time!

572
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,078
(audience cheering)

573
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,163
Well, folks, it looks like
our Michigan mechanics ran

574
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,164
into some troubles.

575
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,165
But hey, it's okay.

576
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,250
It's still anybody's round.

577
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,628
Judges, please tally
up your scores.

578
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,131
We'll be right back after
a short commercial break.

579
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,176
And the results are in.

580
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:13,096
In first, our new dad, Ike.

581
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,014
Congratulations, Ike.

582
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,976
All right, contestants,
it's time to decide

583
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,646
which car you'll be foisting
on your competition.

584
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,907
- Luke assigned me
the '66 Thunderbird.

585
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,118
That's the most beat-up car
of the group to restore.

586
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,746
- Oh, that's not very
gentlemanly of him, is it?

587
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:40,040
- No, it's rude.

588
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:43,126
- Or, no, you
should be flattered.

589
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,669
- What?

590
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:45,879
- Because he knows
you're the only one

591
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,297
on that stage that
can handle it.

592
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,675
- Well, I can and I will.

593
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,803
You know, that's not even
the worst part, though.

594
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,805
The worst part is the only
reason he's ahead of me

595
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,932
on the leaderboard is
because my nerves got to me.

596
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,893
I see the crowd,
I completely freeze.

597
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,062
- Yeah, everybody gets nervous.

598
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,607
Just try not to topple over
a massive car hood next time.

599
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,649
- Oh, you're mean.

600
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,069
(Tori laughs)

601
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,948
You know, that's
not even really it.

602
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:20,288
I feel like when my mom died,

603
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,457
I lost like a really
big part of myself.

604
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,170
That part of me that felt
like I could do anything

605
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,506
and I could be anyone.

606
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:33,426
(melancholy music)

607
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,720
I just feel really
lonely sometimes.

608
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,890
- Hey, but you know that
we are all here for you.

609
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,184
We love you and support you.

610
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,560
- Thanks.

611
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,062
- I'm gonna be in
that crowd tomorrow.

612
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,855
So you're good.

613
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,609
You okay?

614
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,195
- Yeah, it's just,
it's tragic, really.

615
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:57,075
I'm gonna have to
show 'em who's boss.

616
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:57,867
- That's my girl.

617
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,829
(glasses clinking)

618
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,295
(insects chirring)

619
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,839
- I think the universe
is punishing me

620
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,465
for stepping outside
of my comfort zone.

621
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:13,591
- Just worry about
your own work.

622
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,551
Don't let it get to you.

623
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,721
Boy, I wish I could
be there to watch,

624
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,472
but, ah, I gotta keep
things running here.

625
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,390
- It's fine.

626
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,309
It'll be good to
see a friendly face.

627
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,020
- You're gonna have
lots of friendly faces

628
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,105
once they get to
know you, honey.

629
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:27,939
I love you.

630
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,399
- I love you too, Dad.

631
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,693
Come on!

632
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,821
Where there is the
power on this thing?

633
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,409
We can just pull it.

634
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,077
- If you're taking
that up to your room,

635
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,287
could I get one last cup?

636
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,001
- What are you doing up?

637
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,794
- Was on my way to the gym

638
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,130
when I came across
this attempted robbery.

639
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,673
May I?

640
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:54,883
- Be my guest.

641
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,220
(machine beeps)

642
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,224
Clever.

643
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,186
Thank you.

644
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,398
- I'm sorry about today.

645
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,691
That was a disaster.

646
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,443
- It's not entirely your fault.

647
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,570
I was on edge.

648
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,323
- It's kinda fun, though,
doing this together again.

649
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,949
Takes me back.

650
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:23,286
Remember that time in college

651
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,830
when we stripped the
'54 Caddy to the studs?

652
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,667
- We almost broke my dad's
hoist in the process.

653
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,502
I remember.

654
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,545
He does too.

655
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:33,880
He forgives you, by the way.

656
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,383
- He's a good man.

657
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:43,348
- Well, I'm gonna head up

658
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,895
and finish studying on
the '66 Thunderbird.

659
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,438
Cheap move, by the way.

660
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,315
- It's only 'cause I knew
you could handle it.

661
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,526
- Oh, you're going
down, Luke Childs.

662
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,361
Get your beauty rest.

663
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:59,739
(bright music)

664
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,950
(birds chirping)

665
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,035
- I got some great photos at
the festival this morning.

666
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,537
- What? That's amazing.
- Good.

667
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,705
- Maybe you'll find something

668
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,331
that will inspire your project.

669
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,709
- Well, I mean my teacher
told us to make a statement,

670
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,003
to express who we are.

671
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,838
- You should snap some shots

672
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,631
of the dirty laundry
on your bedroom floor.

673
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:17,841
- Mom, stop it. Stop.

674
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,884
- I mean, it's accurate
representation.

675
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,928
- It's okay.

676
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,221
All great artists suffer,

677
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,389
but they find their
way eventually.

678
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,099
- Yeah.

679
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,517
- Or they're driven crazy
by their ex-boyfriends

680
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,643
and go completely insane.

681
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,939
- Whose ex-boyfriend?

682
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,733
- What's that?
Uh...

683
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,776
- Mine.
- Teri's!

684
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:40,572
- Ah.

685
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:41,656
I'll see you at the competition.

686
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:42,782
- Mm-hm.

687
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,409
- [Luke] Okay.
- Okay.

688
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,454
- [Teri] That wasn't
awkward at all.

689
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,499
- What was that?

690
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,460
Wonder why they kept you
both in the competition.

691
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,586
Great tension.

692
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,628
- What tension?

693
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,005
- Romantic tension.

694
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:59,090
Oh, they must be eating it up.

695
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,385
- Yeah. There's no
romantic tension.

696
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,929
I just wish she'd forgive
me, stop blaming me.

697
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,515
- Well, maybe she's
not blaming you.

698
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,726
She just doesn't think
you took her side.

699
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,102
- I didn't take anybody's side.

700
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:13,646
- Maybe that's the problem.

701
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:24,074
- Welcome to day two of
"American High Gear."

702
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,576
(audience cheering)

703
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,829
Now, to be a top
restoration mechanic,

704
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,665
you can't just know
your way around cars.

705
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,084
No, you need to be encyclopedic

706
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,003
about tools, parts, and systems.

707
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,964
- Hey, here's to not toppling
car hoods today, huh?

708
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,592
- Huh? Okay.

709
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,969
- All right.

710
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,763
- Oh, too slow.

711
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:47,639
(audience laughing)

712
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,474
- Uh-oh.

713
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,184
It looks like our
Michigan mechanics are
at it again, folks.

714
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,268
Play nice, you two.

715
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,399
Now contestants, remember,

716
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,818
every second section is
an elimination round,

717
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,820
which means we'll
be saying goodbye

718
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,571
to whoever loses in trivia.

719
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,490
Here we go.

720
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:06,324
Buzzers at the ready?

721
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,992
- Yep.

722
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,953
- Question number one.

723
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,831
How many volts should a
healthy battery register

724
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,332
on a multimeter?

725
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,375
Jess?

726
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,418
- 12.6.

727
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,460
- Correct.

728
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:19,754
(audience cheering)

729
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,758
Looks like somebody's
batteries are charged.

730
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,385
Second question.

731
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,887
What kind of power is produced
in the engine cylinder

732
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:30,640
as a result of fuel combustion?

733
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:31,850
Luke.

734
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:32,809
- It's indicated power, Wayne.

735
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:35,103
- Correct! Wow.

736
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,522
Michigan contestants are
off to a blazing start.

737
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,523
Look out, folks.

738
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:39,733
- You're lucky
I taught you that.

739
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:40,900
- Yeah. Okay.

740
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,569
- Rear traction control.

741
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,154
- Electronic control unit.

742
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,447
- The scrub radius.

743
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,699
- Wayne, that's a
catalytic converter.

744
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,034
- Four of them.

745
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,202
- 14.7 parts air
to one part fuel.

746
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,163
- Three degrees before
top dead center.

747
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:54,998
- Oh, that's four
degrees, Clark.

748
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,249
Four degrees. Sorry, big guy.

749
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,627
- Spring-loaded Muncie shifter.

750
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,046
- Flywheel.

751
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,797
- [Wayne] Jess, you buzzed in.

752
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,715
(upbeat music)

753
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:04,799
- Oh.

754
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,593
- We're waiting.

755
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:16,102
- You know this.

756
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,229
- Camshaft. It's camshaft.

757
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,732
- Oh, camshaft is correct,

758
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,234
but I'm sorry, you're just
a little bit too late.

759
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:27,447
Now, adding up today's points
with the previous days.

760
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,282
- It's all right.
You're all right.

761
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,701
- Luke and Jess have
climbed up from yesterday.

762
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,578
Kevin is now in fourth,

763
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,790
which sadly means
we'll be saying goodbye

764
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,875
to our friend Clark.

765
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,294
I know, I know.

766
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:45,090
(audience clapping)

767
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,633
We'll miss you, pal.

768
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,259
But hey folks, still
anybody's game.

769
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:52,764
Until next time for
"American High Gear,"

770
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,933
Wayne LaRoche.

771
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:58,103
- And Clark.

772
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,562
- And we're out.

773
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:00,605
(bell rings)

774
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:01,648
Good job.

775
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,607
Great job.

776
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:07,821
- You okay?

777
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:10,740
- We'll find out.

778
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,869
- You know, I gotta say,

779
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:16,246
as the only female contestant,

780
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,831
Jess is more than
holding up her own

781
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,416
but you see those
nerves showing?

782
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,168
I mean, that's death on TV.

783
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,337
Anyway, with these
elimination rounds,

784
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,840
she continues like this
she's not gonna last,

785
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,800
which would be a real shame.

786
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:32,053
(crowd chattering)

787
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,805
- Well, that was rough.

788
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,682
- It's okay.

789
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,231
Om...

790
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,821
Om...

791
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,659
(gentle music)

792
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,038
- How exactly is this helping?

793
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,874
- We are centering ourselves

794
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:05,045
and we are connecting
you to the voice inside.

795
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,629
- Oh, I can hear that voice.

796
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,340
It's saying stop
sitting cross-legged.

797
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:09,341
You're getting sciatica.

798
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:10,508
- Focus, Jess.

799
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,843
We're almost zen.

800
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:17,057
Om...

801
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,893
(football thudding)

802
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,689
- I mean, does he have to
play football right there?

803
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,691
- New plan. Get on your feet.

804
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:27,609
- No.

805
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,860
- Come on. Up.

806
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:34,574
And arms up and oh!

807
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:35,658
Release the tension.

808
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,911
Let it all out!

809
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,210
- Well, this was a good idea.

810
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,503
- What's going on over there?

811
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:48,129
- They're centering themselves.

812
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,381
I do that most mornings

813
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,715
before my first
round of video games.

814
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,175
- That does not surprise me.

815
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,551
- Whatever works.

816
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:55,679
It seems like Jess
could use a reset.

817
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,888
- Yeah, Jess is all right.

818
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,640
She's the strongest
person I know.

819
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,975
- I don't doubt it.

820
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,311
But what exactly is
going on between you two?

821
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,772
I'm sensing some hurt feelings.

822
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,774
- Yeah, we got
some healing to do.

823
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,360
- Well, she better heal quick.

824
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:13,822
I don't intend on losing in
any of these elimination rounds

825
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:16,241
and she's next on
the chopping block.

826
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,200
- All right, Kevin.

827
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,076
Slow down.

828
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:21,621
- This is ridiculous...
- Ly effective.

829
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,289
- I'm gonna take
your word for it.

830
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,082
- Okay. Sit down again.

831
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:29,754
We have got to figure out
what is holding you back.

832
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,506
What happens to you when
you get up on that stage?

833
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:32,549
- I don't know, okay?

834
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,092
I lose my nerve.

835
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,678
- Jess, I have seen you
at work in the zone.

836
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,680
You can accomplish anything.

837
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,724
- I just feel so much pressure.

838
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:45,145
- Yes, there has
been a lot going on,

839
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,688
but it's all gonna work out.

840
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:48,857
- Not if I don't win.

841
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:49,816
- Stop it.

842
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:53,403
Has your father gotten this far?

843
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,948
Survived this long with giving
up when things get tough?

844
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,993
If you win, great.

845
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,746
If you don't, we
will figure it out.

846
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:06,207
And that vulnerability
that you see as a weakness,

847
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:08,877
honey, that is your strength.

848
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,255
That sensitivity is what
makes you an artist.

849
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,133
You're stronger than you know.

850
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,638
Om!

851
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,183
- No, I'm not doing it.

852
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,769
- When it comes to
restoring a classic car,

853
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,937
it can take a rigorous
search through vintage parts

854
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:30,565
to find the exact
piece you need.

855
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:31,816
- Missed you at breakfast.

856
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,151
- I hope you didn't fill up,

857
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,778
because you're about
to eat my dust.

858
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:35,987
(audience laughing)

859
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,572
- There she is.

860
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,574
- Today, our contestants are
gonna replace their headlights,

861
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,284
install a new battery,

862
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:44,162
and rewire whatever they
need to turn them on.

863
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,792
- Yikes. It's not gonna be
easy with that Thunderbird.

864
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,168
The housing on the lights

865
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,545
is gonna have to fit
the grill just right.

866
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,131
- I know.

867
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:57,676
- Good.

868
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:00,804
- So, first team to fire
up their lights wins.

869
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:03,306
- Teams?
- That's right.

870
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,642
Just to make things a
little bit more challenging

871
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,603
we've broken our competitors
up into teams of two.

872
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,564
So Kevin, Ike, you're
on the Skylark.

873
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:13,942
Jess, Luke, you're
on the Thunderbird.

874
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,363
- Well, looks like we're
in this thing together.

875
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,115
I got your back.

876
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,117
- Prove it.

877
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:25,328
- Contestants,
on your marks, get set,

878
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,663
go.

879
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:31,292
(upbeat music)
(audience cheering)

880
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,880
- If you wanna hold my hand,
you can just ask.

881
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:38,675
- Your hands are so soft.
What? No tools at the office?

882
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:39,676
(audience laughing)

883
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:40,468
- It figures.

884
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,014
- Boom!

885
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:44,764
This'll work.

886
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:47,100
- See anything?

887
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,018
- What do you got?

888
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:48,977
- I got two pin.

889
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,312
- Great. We're missing a three.

890
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:52,063
Keep looking.

891
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:54,774
Bingo. Got it.
- Okay.

892
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,819
(audience cheering)

893
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,030
- Keep it going, guys.

894
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:01,740
It's still anyone's
game. Let's go.

895
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,954
- This is the Jess I remember.

896
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,247
- Then let's win this thing.

897
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,917
- Fire 'em up.

898
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,421
(audience cheering)

899
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,339
(audience groans)

900
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,548
- Uh-oh.

901
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,966
Misfire on the Thunderbird.

902
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,468
Looks like they're not done
troubleshooting just yet.

903
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,011
- No! We blew a fuse.

904
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,638
Hey, I saw one
in the parts pile.

905
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,890
Go see if you can find.

906
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,266
- It's just gonna keep blowing

907
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,601
unless we figure out
what's wrong with the wiring.

908
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:30,643
- Didn't you gimme
the Thunderbird

909
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:31,770
'cause you knew
I could handle it?

910
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:34,272
Luke, trust me.

911
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,607
I know what I'm doing.

912
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:36,649
- Yes, ma'am.

913
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:38,026
- Come on, Kevin.

914
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:41,613
- Signal switch.

915
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:42,781
- Keep it going,
gang. Keep it going.

916
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,783
- And the signal relay.

917
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,078
Directional relay.

918
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,747
Nope.

919
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,248
The trunk relay.

920
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,626
(upbeat music continues)

921
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:55,752
- [Luke] Got it.

922
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,880
- [Jess] Got it?
- [Luke] Yeah.

923
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,423
- It's gonna be a close one.

924
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,633
- All right, fuse is in.

925
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:02,550
Give it a go.

926
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:03,635
- Hit it.

927
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:07,430
(upbeat music continues)

928
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,183
(audience cheering)

929
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,852
(Jess laughs)

930
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:13,937
- We did it!

931
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,780
- Leaderboard time.

932
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,241
Remember, judges have
awarded points according

933
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,575
to how teams place,

934
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,661
but they've also
tripled the points

935
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,287
to those who've
gone the extra mile

936
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,455
with their craftsmanship.

937
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,416
- Craftswomanship.

938
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:35,500
- And let's take a look.

939
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:39,879
And that's it for today.

940
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,757
For "American High
Gear," I'm Wayne LaRoche.

941
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,300
We'll see you next time.

942
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:46,886
(upbeat music)

943
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,479
- Dad, I wanna talk to
you about something.

944
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:59,315
I think you should
reconsider acquiring Barro's.

945
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:01,693
There's a lot of other
shops that we could get.

946
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,111
- Barro's is in
a prime location.

947
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,488
If we don't nab it,
one of our competitors will.

948
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,949
- But why not help them?

949
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,368
When grandad was alive, all the
shop owners knew each other.

950
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,038
We were competitors,
but we were friends.

951
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,042
Jess is also on the show.

952
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:21,379
- I think you're
letting your feelings

953
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,007
for Jess cloud your judgment.

954
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,676
Right, do me a favor,
leave this with me.

955
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,553
Acquisitions are
all about timing

956
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,889
and I don't want Ray
learning of this offer

957
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,682
until it's properly presented.

958
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:33,975
- What are you asking me?

959
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:35,352
You're asking me not to
mention this to Jess?

960
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:36,895
- Well, there's a lot
of factors that go

961
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,688
into our decision
to acquire a shop.

962
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,316
- And I'm asking you to make
our history one of them.

963
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:44,819
Dad, for me.

964
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,573
- All right, I hear you.

965
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,201
I'll put my finger on
the pause button for now.

966
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:54,537
Now come on, you get out
there and you make us proud.

967
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:55,538
- Yeah, sure.

968
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:58,083
Okay.

969
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:04,255
(people chattering)

970
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,345
It's a great job today.

971
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,306
You really pivoted out there.

972
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,601
Next generation of
auto techs right here.

973
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,231
These two, it's your influence.

974
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:23,108
- I mean that's why I
used to love coming here

975
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:24,317
with our families.

976
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,570
Surrounded by auto enthusiasts.

977
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:30,740
A sense of connection.

978
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:33,493
- Speaking of connection,

979
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,078
did you hear about
the social activity

980
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,496
that Wayne's got slated for us?

981
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,750
It's a way for the
contestants to bond.

982
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:46,631
- Do I wanna know?

983
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,635
(upbeat music)

984
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:03,523
I can't believe this place
is still around.

985
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,859
I haven't been roller
skating in forever.

986
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,779
- That's our song.
Do you hear it?

987
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,364
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

988
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:15,076
- That is not the attitude
of a 7th-grade champion.

989
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,745
If I recall correctly,

990
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:21,624
we dominated a very, very real
roller skating competition.

991
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:24,294
- Okay, well, that's because
there was one other couple

992
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,130
and they dropped out
when both of them fell.

993
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,465
- I don't know about all that.

994
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:31,301
But what I do know
is that you and I.

995
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:33,928
Three, four, here we go.

996
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,221
Boom, one, two.

997
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:37,974
Let's go.

998
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:38,933
Here we go.

999
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,893
One, two.

1000
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,856
* Let's have a little fun *

1001
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:48,151
* When the music
starts playing *

1002
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:51,321
* We're gonna have
a little fun, yeah *

1003
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:56,284
* Can you hear what I'm saying *

1004
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,376
* The weekend's almost here *

1005
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:08,963
* And I'm just waiting
for the moment that *

1006
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:12,217
- Ready to lose, old man?

1007
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:15,929
- I'm gonna fold
you like a onesie.

1008
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,848
- What a strange and
fantastic comeback.

1009
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:22,977
Here we go. Pizza
and ranch dressing.

1010
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,189
Just like the old days.
- Thank you.

1011
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:29,359
Hm. Can't believe you
remembered our old routine.

1012
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,736
- I still practice
every night before bed.

1013
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:32,737
You don't?
- Really.

1014
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,280
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1015
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:35,865
Well, I mean, that's smart

1016
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:38,284
because you never know
when a big business deal's

1017
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:40,245
gonna come down to a
winner-take-all skate off.

1018
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:41,996
It's good life choices.

1019
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:44,207
- Don't get me started
on life choices.

1020
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:48,294
- Come on, you're
getting through.

1021
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:49,379
You're doing fine.

1022
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:50,839
- As if you think that.

1023
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,924
- You're working for your dad.
I'm working for my dad.

1024
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,259
We're both doing
the best we can.

1025
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,094
- Except you're
doing what you love,

1026
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:58,388
and I'm stuck in
an office playing

1027
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,390
with spreadsheets
and having meetings.

1028
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:02,475
- Yeah, it's like a
spreadsheet video game.

1029
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:04,436
It's fun.
- The greatest.

1030
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:09,232
- Okay, fine, it's not
exactly apples to potatoes.

1031
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:11,818
- No, it's not apples
to potatoes at all.

1032
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,237
I got sucked into
this thing, you know?

1033
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:15,613
Couldn't say no.

1034
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,409
- Well, I mean, you can say no.

1035
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,287
But...

1036
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:26,750
How's your mom?

1037
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,294
- Mom is good.

1038
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,755
She moved to Arizona
after the divorce.

1039
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:32,922
- Oh.

1040
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:34,883
- Still talks about you a lot.

1041
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,259
- Oh yeah?

1042
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,303
- I wish it would
stop, honestly.

1043
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:42,098
But, you know, in
this competition,

1044
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,017
you remind me a lot of your mom.

1045
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:45,268
- We're talking about

1046
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,644
the same mom, right?
- Same mom, yes.

1047
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:47,854
- My mom. Okay.

1048
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:48,938
Yeah. Yeah.

1049
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,607
My mom who could just walk

1050
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:54,611
in front of a group of
people and not break a sweat.

1051
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:56,613
My mom lit up every
room she walked into.

1052
00:44:56,654 --> 00:45:00,825
I can just barely get my
words out when it's my turn.

1053
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:06,956
- I know it might
feel like that,

1054
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:09,334
but I don't see it that way.

1055
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,794
Your mother was fierce.

1056
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:12,128
She was strong.

1057
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,963
She was the kinda person
who would stand up

1058
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:15,298
to any fear in front of her.

1059
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,676
And that's what you're doing.

1060
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:22,305
I'm just saying, your mom
was an impressive woman.

1061
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:23,473
So are you.

1062
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:29,479
- Thank you.

1063
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:31,439
Even if you're lying,
it sounds nice.

1064
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:36,611
(birds chirping)

1065
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,989
- I'm really proud of you, Jess.

1066
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:41,658
- Dad, it's only
the first round.

1067
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,077
I'm barely out of last place.

1068
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,371
- Not just yesterday.
Everything.

1069
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,499
Being in the competition,
putting yourself out there.

1070
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,710
I haven't seen this side
of you in a long time.

1071
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:54,963
- You know, it's funny

1072
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,966
because I have spent years
avoiding this kind of situation,

1073
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:01,928
but now that I'm in it, I
just, I wanna go for it.

1074
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,304
- That's good.

1075
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:05,306
It really is.

1076
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:07,767
Do you think working with Luke

1077
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:09,936
has had something
to do with that?

1078
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:12,188
- Dad, I'm fighting for the
future of the garage, okay?

1079
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,106
I don't have time for feelings.

1080
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:17,027
If there were any.

1081
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:24,409
Speaking of the garage,
did you hear any news?

1082
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,539
- I talked to the landlord,
but he's holding firm.

1083
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:32,334
- You know, if I win this thing,

1084
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,918
it's gonna solve
all our problems.

1085
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,880
- Nothing solves all problems,
but don't worry about that.

1086
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:38,465
I've applied for a loan.

1087
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:41,259
For now, enjoy the moment.

1088
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:43,428
That's all I care about.

1089
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,013
- No, I'm not gonna
let you down, Dad.

1090
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:47,432
- You never could.

1091
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:53,563
- [Luke] So there I
am, parts everywhere,

1092
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:54,731
trying to put it
all back together

1093
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,191
when the customer shows up.

1094
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,275
- [Audience] Uh-oh.

1095
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,110
- Yeah. Uh-oh was right, Wayne.

1096
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:03,615
So he's standing in the doorway

1097
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:06,326
and I look like I just
committed automotive murder.

1098
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,036
And a single tear
rolls down his cheek

1099
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,830
and he goes, "Just came
in for an oil change."

1100
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,251
- Ouch. That is quite the
first day on the job, Luke.

1101
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:17,921
- That's quite the last day too.

1102
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:20,131
- True.

1103
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:21,424
- Folks, if you're
just joining us,

1104
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:22,967
we're doing a quick Q&A
with our contestants

1105
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:24,844
to get to know them just
a little bit better.

1106
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:27,222
Now, Jess, I understand that
you grew up around cars.

1107
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:28,598
What is it exactly

1108
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,975
that you love about
restoring old classics?

1109
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:35,397
- Ah, well, I've loved classic
cars from a very young age.

1110
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:38,441
Their charm, their design.

1111
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,819
I love the way that they
demand that you get in there

1112
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,988
and you get your hands dirty.

1113
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,157
If I really, really
think about it,

1114
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:50,161
I love what these
cars represent.

1115
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:53,998
Cars are at the center of so
many of my favorite memories.

1116
00:47:56,334 --> 00:48:00,088
Family outings and road trips.

1117
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,883
Going to restaurants,

1118
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:05,010
drive-ins.

1119
00:48:08,346 --> 00:48:10,015
Car is what makes
those memories happen.

1120
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:18,106
Memories fade and
cars deteriorate, but,

1121
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:24,195
I mean, if I can be
just a small part

1122
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,616
in restoring those memories
and keeping them alive,

1123
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:31,953
then that means
everything to me.

1124
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:34,289
(gentle music)

1125
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:47,260
You got anyone special
coming to cheer you on?

1126
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,636
- My buddy Pete's coming later.

1127
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,265
- What? That's it?

1128
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:53,391
Nobody else?

1129
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:56,561
- I don't have a
special cheering section

1130
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:57,896
if that's what you're asking.

1131
00:48:59,814 --> 00:49:01,232
Last date I went on
was a disaster.

1132
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:05,111
I knew within the first two
minutes it wasn't a match,

1133
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:09,866
which made the next five, six
hours just super romantic.

1134
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,749
How about you? You
seeing anybody?

1135
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:21,127
- No. After my last
string of dates,

1136
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:24,839
which I would rate
from bad to horrible,

1137
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:25,924
pretty much given up.

1138
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:30,178
- Well, at least I can't
say you're a quitter.

1139
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,846
- Okay. All right, fine.

1140
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:35,684
I haven't given up, but when
I know I'll know, you know?

1141
00:49:39,187 --> 00:49:41,856
Oh, speaking of knowing,

1142
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,818
you know the first car
I restored completely

1143
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:47,237
on my own was a Dart.

1144
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:48,405
I painted it purple.

1145
00:49:48,446 --> 00:49:49,823
- I remember.

1146
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:51,616
You were an artist
with a spray gum.

1147
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:52,784
Probably still are.

1148
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:55,704
How often are you
restoring these days?

1149
00:49:55,745 --> 00:50:00,375
- Ah, it's a side
thing, but I love it.

1150
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:03,545
- Doesn't have to be
a side thing, you know?

1151
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:04,671
Could expand it.

1152
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:05,964
- Yeah, well, that's the dream.

1153
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,759
Eventually, but right now
I've gotta help my dad

1154
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,761
with basic services.

1155
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,304
It's our bread and butter.

1156
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:20,186
Besides, I don't think
I have it in me

1157
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:23,189
to be the front person of
my own restoration biz.

1158
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,108
- Jess, you're a natural.

1159
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:29,237
They'd be lining up
around the block for you.

1160
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:32,198
- Yeah, well, that can't
happen soon enough.

1161
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,074
- What do you mean?

1162
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:37,871
Jess, you know you
can talk to me.

1163
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:39,456
I am happy to listen.

1164
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:47,213
- We're having some financial
problems at the garage.

1165
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:52,010
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

1166
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,428
That's why I joined
the competition.

1167
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,265
If I don't win,
I dunno what we'll do.

1168
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:01,770
- Jess, there's something
you should probably know-

1169
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:03,271
- You know, it's funny because,
for the first time,

1170
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,065
I actually feel like
things will work out.

1171
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:07,233
I mean, I joined the
competition to save the garage,

1172
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:08,943
but it sort of feels
like something more.

1173
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:12,364
- That's great.

1174
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:14,240
- At least that's what
I keep telling myself

1175
00:51:14,282 --> 00:51:16,159
because I really can't
handle any more pressure.

1176
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,913
- Right.

1177
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:22,248
(upbeat rock music)

1178
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,709
- Our competitors are
racing head-to-head

1179
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,419
to diagnose and to repair.

1180
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:31,216
But it looks like Jess is
speeding to the top of the pack.

1181
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:33,218
- Hey, Hercules, feel free
to give us a hand over here.

1182
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:34,636
- If I do that,

1183
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:36,054
and then you're coming
to me every time

1184
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:38,264
you need to open
a jar of pickles.

1185
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,727
- And that's a costly
fumble for Mike.

1186
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,437
Hold on to those tools, folks.

1187
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,064
It all comes down to this.

1188
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:48,775
Now, since the scores
are so neck to neck,

1189
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,528
the first three contestants
to fire up their engines

1190
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:53,196
will be moving on
to the last round.

1191
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:56,157
Whoever comes in
last, walks home.

1192
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,534
- Socket.

1193
00:51:57,575 --> 00:51:59,536
Hey, Luke, you
took my 3/4 socket.

1194
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:01,121
- Yeah, but I also gave it back.

1195
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:02,080
- It's not here.

1196
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:09,004
- [Luke] There we go.

1197
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:19,556
- Ooh, this is close.

1198
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:21,141
Jess is getting close.

1199
00:52:21,182 --> 00:52:23,601
(car sputtering)

1200
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,231
- Yes!

1201
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:30,442
- Look out!

1202
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:31,526
- Whoa!

1203
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:36,197
- Thanks.

1204
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:38,700
- Yeah. You okay?

1205
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,618
- Mm-hm.

1206
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,369
- Good.

1207
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,247
- I am sorry, Ike,

1208
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,833
but that fumble cost
you precious time

1209
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,126
putting you in last place,

1210
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,712
which means it's
Luke, Kevin, and Jess

1211
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:52,505
moving on to the final round.

1212
00:52:52,547 --> 00:52:55,842
(audience clapping)

1213
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:58,345
- Nina, Daddy's coming home.

1214
00:52:58,386 --> 00:53:00,722
- Lots to be proud of,
Nina, lots to be proud.

1215
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:03,016
Until next time for
the final round.

1216
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:04,517
For "American High Gear,"

1217
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,602
I'm Wayne LaRoche.

1218
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,021
And we're out!

1219
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,647
- We'll miss you, Ike.

1220
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,694
- That's on making
it to the finals.

1221
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:16,780
You two are like a dream team.

1222
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:18,031
- We you make a
pretty good team.

1223
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:19,115
- We're not a team.

1224
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,201
- Not a team. No, not a team.

1225
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:22,494
Just meant in the
competition, right?

1226
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:23,745
- Right.

1227
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,038
- It's kinda like
a sport, you know?

1228
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,414
There's no "I" in team.

1229
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:29,250
There is a me if you
switch letters around.

1230
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:30,502
I'm gonna stop.

1231
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:31,878
This is Pete.

1232
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,797
He's the director of
marketing at Tune Up Wiz

1233
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:34,714
and my friend.
- Hey.

1234
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:35,799
- Nice to meet you.

1235
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,883
- Nice to meet you.

1236
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:38,718
I love a good comeback story.

1237
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,637
- Thanks.
- But, hey, I better head back

1238
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,430
to the office before your dad
notices I've been at lunch

1239
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,682
for 2 1/2 hours.

1240
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:45,308
- Right. Yeah. Let me
walk you to your car.

1241
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,893
I'm gonna be right back.
- Let's go.

1242
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:48,228
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

1243
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:49,229
- Bye.

1244
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,231
- Hey!

1245
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:52,357
Yeah.

1246
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:55,068
(people chattering)

1247
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:58,947
- Yeah, yeah. I can't
keep doing this.

1248
00:53:58,988 --> 00:54:00,156
- What you talking about?

1249
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:01,616
You're killing it out there.

1250
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:03,118
I think you could
win this thing.

1251
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,704
- And put Jess's dad
completely outta business?

1252
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:07,539
- What?

1253
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,709
- They need the prize money
to keep Barros's doors open.

1254
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,584
- Are you serious?

1255
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:13,670
- Yeah.

1256
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:15,547
- You should tell her what's
happening with your dad.

1257
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:17,257
It'd be worse if she
finds out on her own.

1258
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:18,967
- I know. I know.
I want to.

1259
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:22,095
I tried, but she doesn't
need the added pressure.

1260
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:25,432
I don't know how I keep finding
myself in this situation.

1261
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:27,142
- The universe
provides, my friend.

1262
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:30,228
- I don't know what
that means, Pete.

1263
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,688
Did you read that
on a fortune cookie?

1264
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,565
- No.

1265
00:54:33,606 --> 00:54:34,607
Okay, look, one time, yes.

1266
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:35,942
But I'm serious.

1267
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,778
We attract the things
we need to overcome,

1268
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,946
- Right. Yeah.

1269
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:41,865
Thank you for that, Yoda.

1270
00:54:41,906 --> 00:54:43,616
I'm gonna attract
her hating me more.

1271
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:44,826
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1272
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:46,119
- She won't if you're honest.

1273
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,621
She's a good person
and so are you.

1274
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:49,497
Don't forget that.

1275
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:52,000
I'll see you around.

1276
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:54,919
- Thanks, buddy.

1277
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:57,756
(people chattering)

1278
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,635
- Eden's photo
exhibition is tonight.

1279
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:03,803
She keeps checking in with me

1280
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:04,929
to make sure that you're coming.

1281
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:06,556
- Of course. I wouldn't miss it.

1282
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:08,391
- Good, good.

1283
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:09,893
- Early afternoon and
we're already done.

1284
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:11,144
I can get used to this.

1285
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,064
- Well, hi.
- [Luke] Hi.

1286
00:55:14,105 --> 00:55:15,315
- I'm Terry.
- I'm Luke.

1287
00:55:15,357 --> 00:55:17,025
- I work for Ray and this one.

1288
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,818
- Yes, I've heard a lot
about you from Jess.

1289
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,987
- Lies, all of it.

1290
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:21,988
No, I'm just kidding.

1291
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,198
- Right. Of course.

1292
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:24,449
- No.

1293
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:26,326
Didn't you used to go to
high school with Jess?

1294
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:27,577
- Yes I did.

1295
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,537
And I have the frosted
tipped hair to prove it.

1296
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:33,416
- Well it just so happens

1297
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,001
that my daughter goes
to the same high school.

1298
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:36,670
- Is that right?

1299
00:55:36,711 --> 00:55:39,381
- Yeah. And tonight she's having
a photojournalism exhibit.

1300
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:43,259
Yeah. You wouldn't wanna come?

1301
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:44,969
I mean, Jess is gonna be there.

1302
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:46,513
You could join her.

1303
00:55:46,554 --> 00:55:48,181
You could go back to your
old stomping grounds.

1304
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,766
- I would love that. Thank you.

1305
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,184
- Yeah. Great.

1306
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:52,560
- [Luke] Yeah.
- It's a date.

1307
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:56,690
- Great. I'm gonna
go frost my tips.

1308
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,443
- Okay.

1309
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:01,903
He's cute.

1310
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:03,029
- Yeah. Teri, I know
what you're doing.

1311
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,823
Luke and I had our time.

1312
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,241
We're just friends now.

1313
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:08,201
- You know what, Jess?

1314
00:56:08,243 --> 00:56:11,121
It's really easy
to shut people out.

1315
00:56:11,162 --> 00:56:13,790
The real challenge is opening
yourself back up again.

1316
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:16,292
Taking a chance.

1317
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:19,087
I will see you both tonight.

1318
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:31,307
(people chattering)

1319
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:34,436
- Wow. It's so different.

1320
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:36,438
Almost erases the trauma
of failing algebra.

1321
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:39,190
- Wow. These kids
are so talented.

1322
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:40,692
- Yeah.

1323
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,277
- Takes some guts to put
your heart on display.

1324
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:44,779
- No guts, no glory, right?

1325
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:45,780
- Jess!

1326
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:47,073
- Eden.

1327
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,117
Oh, this is Luke.

1328
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:50,326
- Nice to meet you.

1329
00:56:50,368 --> 00:56:52,078
- Oh, I know who you are.

1330
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,122
- Okay.

1331
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,206
- Well, I'm glad you're here.

1332
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:56,207
- Are you kidding?

1333
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:57,500
I wouldn't miss it.

1334
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:58,960
You're gonna be a famous
photojournalist one day

1335
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,962
and I wanna be able to say
I was at your first exhibit.

1336
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:02,630
- Well, I'm one step closer.

1337
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:03,798
My teacher loved the exhibit.

1338
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,468
I got the job on
the school's paper!

1339
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:08,970
- Oh, congratulations.
I knew you could do it.

1340
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,138
- And it's thanks to you.

1341
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,306
- What do you mean?

1342
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,724
- Well, come on. I'll show you.

1343
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:23,151
I kept searching for an idea
that expressed who I was.

1344
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:26,696
You know, a belief or cause,

1345
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:29,532
but then I realized it was
staring me right in the face.

1346
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:33,661
I wanted to inspire
people to be themselves,

1347
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:36,623
strong and proud because
that's who you are to me.

1348
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,167
What do you think?

1349
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:40,085
- I love it.

1350
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:42,295
Thank you.

1351
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:45,507
(gentle music)

1352
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,884
- Okay, well, I'll
see you guys later.

1353
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:56,726
- Wanna get some air?

1354
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:57,852
- Sure.

1355
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:02,607
(rain pattering)

1356
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:06,611
- Remember it was pouring
rain during homecoming?

1357
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,029
- Yeah. It didn't
stop us from dancing

1358
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:09,072
in this field right here.

1359
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:12,575
Or that kid from sliding
and slipping all the way

1360
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:13,702
down the bleachers.
- Down the bleachers.

1361
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:15,745
- What's that kid's name again?

1362
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,872
- Derek.
- Derek.

1363
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:19,207
- Derek.
- Come on.

1364
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:21,126
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman.

1365
00:58:25,463 --> 00:58:27,007
- My granddad sold
him his first car.

1366
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:29,551
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1367
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:32,095
- I did not know that.

1368
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:35,015
- Yeah, he used to always
say that most important part

1369
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:37,183
of a car was the person
behind the wheel.

1370
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,604
- He had an amazing spirit.

1371
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:43,732
- Yeah, he really did.

1372
00:58:43,773 --> 00:58:47,777
That's exactly how I'd run
the company if were up to me.

1373
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:51,781
- Yeah, well, it's
not up to you.

1374
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:52,907
Not now anyway.

1375
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:55,827
- Yeah.

1376
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:06,504
- You know, when we broke up,
it was really hard for me.

1377
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:11,176
- Me too.

1378
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:21,019
(gentle music)

1379
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:22,437
* Think about the things *

1380
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:26,316
* Think about the
things you said *

1381
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:27,567
* I have never been *

1382
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:31,821
* Never been the kind, babe *

1383
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:36,743
* But if it's all
the same to you *

1384
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:42,957
* I'm gonna lock you in,
throw the key away *

1385
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:44,334
- What are you doing?

1386
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:47,212
- It stopped raining.
Gimme your umbrella.

1387
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:52,008
* No I'm not ready *

1388
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:55,845
* I can never let you
go, just let you go *

1389
00:59:55,887 --> 00:59:58,264
* Just let you go like that *

1390
00:59:58,306 --> 01:00:02,686
* I'm not ready, ready *

1391
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:05,522
* Just look around *

1392
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:07,607
(gentle music)

1393
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:08,817
- Well, it's been quite a ride,

1394
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:11,027
but it all comes down to this.

1395
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:12,320
The final round.

1396
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,531
(audience clapping)

1397
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:16,116
Now the scores have
all been cleared,

1398
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:18,618
so each contestant has an
equal chance of winning.

1399
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,036
The final challenge

1400
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,497
will be to complete your
vehicle's restoration

1401
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:25,291
with a custom paint
job within two days.

1402
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,835
- [Audience] Wow!

1403
01:00:26,876 --> 01:00:28,503
- The judges will
not only assess

1404
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:31,256
for quality, but creativity.

1405
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:32,590
- Let's do this!

1406
01:00:32,632 --> 01:00:34,300
- Contestants, have at it.

1407
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,470
- You two have been
fun to chill with,

1408
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:39,597
but now it's go time.
You're going down.

1409
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:43,268
(upbeat music continues)

1410
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:47,731
- Whatever happens, one
of us has to beat Kevin.

1411
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:50,358
- Absolutely.

1412
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,027
- My money's on you.

1413
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:55,530
(gentle music)

1414
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:58,033
- Well, I've got a
lotta work to do,

1415
01:00:58,074 --> 01:01:00,201
so I'm gonna get going,

1416
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:02,287
but I'll see you later.

1417
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:04,039
- Promise?

1418
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:14,674
- When I got your text
inviting me for drinks,

1419
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:17,260
I assumed you'd meant to
send it to a different Ray.

1420
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:21,097
- Yeah, well, it's
been a while, huh?

1421
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:24,893
So I hear that Jess
made it to the finals.

1422
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:26,436
Yeah. You must be very proud.

1423
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:28,271
- You were never
one for small talk,

1424
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:31,274
so what's this really about?

1425
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:34,986
- I wanna buy your garage.

1426
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:40,116
- I appreciate that, but
the garage isn't for sale.

1427
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:41,785
- Oh, come on Ray.

1428
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:44,412
I sense that Jess wouldn't be
involved in this competition

1429
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:45,705
if you didn't need the money.

1430
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:48,375
It's a generous offer.

1431
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:53,129
There's enough there you to
be able to retire comfortably

1432
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:54,798
and for Jess to
make a fresh start.

1433
01:01:57,175 --> 01:01:58,385
- The answer's no.

1434
01:01:58,426 --> 01:01:59,386
- Come on, Ray.

1435
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:03,014
Don't make this about the past.

1436
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:05,767
You could lose your
entire business.

1437
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:07,519
This is a way out.

1438
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,229
- I have no intention
of losing it.

1439
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,648
I have my best employee on it.

1440
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,026
I bet everything I have
every time on Jess.

1441
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:19,864
You know, you might consider
betting more on your son.

1442
01:02:21,282 --> 01:02:22,158
Nice seeing you, Steven.

1443
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:29,499
(upbeat music)

1444
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:32,168
(fire crackling)

1445
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,967
- Is this reserved?

1446
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:42,178
Can anyone sit here and
stare pensively at the fire?

1447
01:02:43,638 --> 01:02:44,723
- Please, join me.

1448
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:50,562
- Didn't wanna join
the party, huh?

1449
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:51,938
Kevin's in there.

1450
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,189
He is teaching everybody
a great dance movie

1451
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:54,065
called the lawnmower.

1452
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,152
- Okay. I gotta see that.

1453
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:01,489
Huh, looks like he's
moved on to flossing.

1454
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:03,158
That's exactly what
I hoped it would be.

1455
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:05,869
- He's good, right?

1456
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:09,372
- I was just thinking

1457
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:11,041
about the time when went
camping at Lakeport.

1458
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:15,337
- I'd never seen as many stars.

1459
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:21,217
It was really good to get
away after my mom's passing.

1460
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:25,055
You were always there for me.

1461
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:28,183
- Until I wasn't.

1462
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:33,688
I wanted to tell you
what my father was doing

1463
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,106
with your dad and the business,

1464
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:40,320
and maybe I didn't fully
comprehend what was happening,

1465
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:44,532
but more likely I
didn't have the courage

1466
01:03:44,574 --> 01:03:45,909
to stand up to him,

1467
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:47,202
to stand up for you.

1468
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:53,249
And my goodness do I regret it.

1469
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,882
It takes a lotta courage
to do what you're doing.

1470
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,425
Getting up on that
stage every day,

1471
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:05,512
knowing how scared you are.

1472
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:08,973
Maybe if you could
be that brave,

1473
01:04:12,435 --> 01:04:13,269
I can too.

1474
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:19,025
- I don't know if
I'm that brave.

1475
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:25,240
As much as it pains
me to say this,

1476
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,956
I don't think I could do
this crazy thing without you.

1477
01:04:37,293 --> 01:04:41,297
- I never thought that I'd
get you back in my life.

1478
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,885
You know, I never
wanted to lose you.

1479
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:53,059
(gentle music)

1480
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:27,886
* I see you, baby, acting cool *

1481
01:05:27,927 --> 01:05:31,848
* Ain't no doubt
gonna make you mine *

1482
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,809
* I wanna kiss you
and hold you tight *

1483
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:39,773
* Whoa, there's a fire burning *

1484
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:41,983
* I know you can feel it *

1485
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,903
* I can see it in your eyes *

1486
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:46,154
* All right *

1487
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:47,155
(upbeat music continues)

1488
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:51,242
* And it feels so good *

1489
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:54,412
* Say you love what you do *

1490
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,373
- And where there's
Motown, there's a Jess.

1491
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,541
- Can't paint without it.

1492
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,753
It was my mom's favorite.

1493
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:03,797
- Oh, I know.

1494
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:06,383
- Paint's done.

1495
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:07,509
- There's no way.

1496
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,802
- Yeah, I'm waiting
for it to dry.

1497
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:10,011
- Okay. I gotta see this.

1498
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,930
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I gotta see it.

1499
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,348
- No, no, no, no.
Patience, my friend.

1500
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,393
There are dividers for a reason.

1501
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,479
- You free later?

1502
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:21,940
Some things I wanna
talk to you about.

1503
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:22,899
- Yeah.

1504
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:24,359
That sounds more serious

1505
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:25,819
than the color of paint
you're gonna choose.

1506
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:26,820
- Maybe slightly.

1507
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:29,489
- Okay.

1508
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,116
Well, listen, my dad
and Eden and Teri

1509
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:34,869
are gonna come for lunch,
but how about dinner?

1510
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:36,746
- Yeah, it's a date.

1511
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:37,706
- Okay. Good.

1512
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:42,627
There are just a couple
more things I have to grab.

1513
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:44,879
But hey, no peeking.

1514
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:47,298
- No peeking? No promises.

1515
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:53,805
Okay.

1516
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,473
- [Steven] Hey, Luke.

1517
01:06:55,515 --> 01:06:58,685
- Dad, what are you doing here?

1518
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,186
- You said you wanted to talk.

1519
01:07:00,228 --> 01:07:01,604
So what's on your mind, son?

1520
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,406
- You know I want the
best for you, right?

1521
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:14,242
And I appreciate everything
that you've built,

1522
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:16,036
but I think something
needs to change here.

1523
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:18,455
- What are you getting at?

1524
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:21,249
- That if Barro's is in trouble

1525
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:22,792
and you don't want
our competitors

1526
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:25,462
to have their location,
then I think, given our history,

1527
01:07:25,503 --> 01:07:28,256
the least we can do is help
them get back on their feet.

1528
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:30,467
- That's just not how
our business works, son.

1529
01:07:30,508 --> 01:07:32,969
Look, I need someone on my side

1530
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:36,014
that I can trust in leadership.

1531
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:37,932
And that person is you.

1532
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:40,268
- I appreciate that.

1533
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:44,314
But I wanna be building
community like Ray and Jess.

1534
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:47,400
- Look, I know you wanted me
to hold off, but I went ahead

1535
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:49,235
and I presented
Ray with an offer.

1536
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:51,905
- What?
- He turned me down.

1537
01:07:53,656 --> 01:07:55,325
He seems to have lost
sight of what's imminent.

1538
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,911
I tried to reason with him.
But he won't let go of the past.

1539
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,747
- Okay, so what now?

1540
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,082
- Well, I spoke to his landlord.

1541
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:03,333
I made a conditional deposit

1542
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,543
on a multi-year
lease for the garage.

1543
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:08,254
It will take effect if
he defaults on his rent.

1544
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:10,131
I'm protecting your future.

1545
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:11,633
- [Luke] I appreciate that.

1546
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:13,468
- [Steven] I'm just leaving
the rest of it to fate.

1547
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,178
- Hey, Teri, can you
hang on a second?

1548
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,055
- If he can't come
up with the money,

1549
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,431
he's gonna be out anyway.

1550
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:21,142
He'll be forced to
sell the business.

1551
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:22,477
I mean, at least this way,

1552
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:24,437
we ensure that he
lands on both feet.

1553
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,981
This is what makes
the most sense.

1554
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:29,317
- Yeah. Hey, I'm here.

1555
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,320
Did you know Tune Up Wiz was
trying to buy the garage?

1556
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,822
- How do you know about that?

1557
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:35,740
- So it is true?

1558
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:38,827
- Luke's father made an offer,
but your dad refused it.

1559
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:41,788
Unfortunately, the bank has
rejected his loan application.

1560
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,581
So he's looking for things

1561
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:45,375
that he can sell
to raise the money.

1562
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,794
- Well, if we can't, Steven's
gonna take over our lease

1563
01:08:47,836 --> 01:08:48,837
and kick us out anyway.

1564
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:52,757
You know, hey, can
I call you back?

1565
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,593
(people chattering)

1566
01:08:59,639 --> 01:09:02,350
(melancholy music)

1567
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:09,733
(phone ringing)

1568
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,778
- Pick up, Jess.

1569
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,905
- [Jess] Hey, this is Jess
from Barro's Auto.

1570
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:18,366
(Luke sighs)

1571
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:25,707
(paint gun clicking)

1572
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:26,833
Who's done this?

1573
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:33,757
What is your issue?

1574
01:09:33,798 --> 01:09:36,426
(compressor clacking)

1575
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:37,427
(compressor whirring)

1576
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:40,347
(paint gun hissing)

1577
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:50,607
No.

1578
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,075
Okay.

1579
01:10:00,116 --> 01:10:02,952
(people chattering)

1580
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:09,959
- Luke.

1581
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:16,966
(somber music)

1582
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:19,678
What?

1583
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,432
(Jess gasping)

1584
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,692
- It was an accident.

1585
01:10:33,733 --> 01:10:35,026
- What happened?

1586
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:37,278
- The compressor,
it wasn't working.

1587
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,406
I was distracted.

1588
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:40,699
Jess, I am so sorry.

1589
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:50,083
- Did you enter the competition
to keep me from winning

1590
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,210
so your father could
buy the garage?

1591
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:53,378
- What?

1592
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,547
- I overheard your dad's plan.

1593
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:02,470
- No, that's not why I entered.

1594
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:05,473
I just found out.

1595
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:07,642
I knew he wanted to acquire
the garage, but I didn't...

1596
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:09,561
- I know what he's
planning, Luke.

1597
01:11:12,814 --> 01:11:14,566
So you knew he wanted
to buy the garage

1598
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:16,317
and you stay in the competition

1599
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:17,610
so I don't win the prize money.

1600
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:22,073
And you want me to believe
this was an accident?

1601
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:25,035
- I never wanna hurt you,
Jess. Please believe that.

1602
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:25,869
- That's just it.

1603
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:31,833
I don't think that I can.

1604
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,878
(somber music continues)

1605
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:49,059
- Hey.

1606
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,518
I'm not really too sure
why you wanted me here.

1607
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,355
- Dad, please take a seat.

1608
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:56,316
I think it's time that you
and I had a very real talk.

1609
01:11:58,401 --> 01:11:59,235
- Go ahead.

1610
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:03,365
- I want you to call
off the plan for Ray's

1611
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:04,908
and I want you to help them.

1612
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:06,493
- You already know
I can't do that.

1613
01:12:06,534 --> 01:12:08,036
- He was your partner.

1614
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:09,579
The Barros are
practically family.

1615
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:11,748
Do you really think that
granddad would've wanted this?

1616
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,833
- Your grandfather wanted
this company to grow.

1617
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:16,711
That's all I'm trying to do.

1618
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:18,963
- He would never have wanted
you to treat a friend this way.

1619
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:26,554
- Because of that friendship.

1620
01:12:26,596 --> 01:12:29,432
Ray's gonna be better
off and so is Jess.

1621
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,893
- This should not be
your decision to make.

1622
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:34,312
And I know you have it in
you to be better than this,

1623
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,940
but if you can't see that
this is the right thing to do,

1624
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,568
then I can't be a part of it.

1625
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:43,238
Any of it.

1626
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:44,197
This is my resignation.

1627
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,198
- Whoa, whoa.

1628
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,282
Hey, Luke. Luke, wait.

1629
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:50,704
Hey, you think of your future.

1630
01:12:50,745 --> 01:12:52,622
- That's exactly
what I'm doing, Dad.

1631
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:56,876
I may have lost the most
important person to me,

1632
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:00,088
but I'm gonna do
everything that I can

1633
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,923
to make sure she doesn't
lose the most important

1634
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:03,133
thing to her.

1635
01:13:10,223 --> 01:13:11,933
- Let's just take a
moment and think, okay.

1636
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,643
The competition isn't over yet.

1637
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:15,645
- It is for me.

1638
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:19,774
I can't prep and paint
a car before the finale.

1639
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:21,151
I let everybody down.

1640
01:13:21,192 --> 01:13:22,777
- You did great, Jess.

1641
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:24,904
I'm sure you would've won.

1642
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:26,698
- Can I have a word
alone with Jess?

1643
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,074
- Absolutely.

1644
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:30,243
Come on, you.
Let's take a walk.

1645
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:31,828
(waterfall whooshing)

1646
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,913
- I'm guessing this isn't
just about the garage.

1647
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:38,168
- When Luke joined
the competition,

1648
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:43,423
I felt all these memories
just come flooding back to me.

1649
01:13:45,675 --> 01:13:46,968
The way he let me down,

1650
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,429
the way he changed your life.

1651
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:50,805
- I'm fine, Jess.

1652
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,432
- Yeah, but it upset me.

1653
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,936
Then something amazing happened.

1654
01:13:59,105 --> 01:14:01,232
I started seeing
the old Luke again,

1655
01:14:01,274 --> 01:14:03,360
the one I fell in love with.

1656
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:05,653
And it was such a
relief, you know,

1657
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,823
because I started
feeling this part

1658
01:14:08,865 --> 01:14:10,367
of me coming back again.

1659
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:12,452
But it wasn't real.

1660
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:18,291
And I never should've
let him back in.

1661
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,209
- Sure.

1662
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:23,004
And that way you can
just move through life

1663
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:24,923
without ever hitting
a bump in the road?

1664
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,719
Your mom and I weren't perfect.

1665
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:32,222
We hit lots of bumps
along the road,

1666
01:14:32,263 --> 01:14:33,890
but through it all,

1667
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:37,060
she always brought
out the best in me.

1668
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:43,191
This competition was never
just about cars for me, Jess.

1669
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,238
- Well, cars don't cause pain.

1670
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:50,990
- They also don't love.

1671
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:55,745
Maybe it was an accident.

1672
01:14:55,787 --> 01:15:00,250
I just, I don't see
sabotage in Luke's heart.

1673
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:04,004
(waterfall whooshing)

1674
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:04,879
Come here.

1675
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:08,091
It's okay.

1676
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:14,389
- [Jess] Mr. Childs?

1677
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:15,890
- Hey, Jessica.

1678
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:17,517
- Somebody was saying
you wanted to see me.

1679
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:20,979
- I'd really like to talk
if you'd just have a seat.

1680
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:23,023
- Sure.

1681
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:30,780
- Look, I really need
to explain myself.

1682
01:15:30,822 --> 01:15:33,241
My dad and I were
very different people,

1683
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:38,121
and in many ways he was
actually a lot like your dad.

1684
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:41,750
And I wanted to have
a different kind

1685
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,752
of relationship with Luke.

1686
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:47,172
You know, in my effort to
bring us closer together,

1687
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:49,174
I seem to have driven
him further away.

1688
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:57,182
I made Luke choose
between you and my family.

1689
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:00,185
And that was a big mistake.

1690
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:05,315
Luke would never do anything
to hurt you or your dad.

1691
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:08,860
He's a good man.

1692
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,820
In many ways, he's a
better man than me.

1693
01:16:12,155 --> 01:16:14,908
I'm deeply sorry for what I did.

1694
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:16,618
(gentle music)

1695
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:17,494
- Thank you.

1696
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:20,955
I really needed to hear that.

1697
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,212
(phone ringing)

1698
01:16:27,253 --> 01:16:28,338
- Come on.

1699
01:16:29,964 --> 01:16:31,508
- Hey, I wanna talk.

1700
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:34,594
- Sure.

1701
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:35,804
I'm just trying to reach Wayne.

1702
01:16:35,845 --> 01:16:37,389
I'm dropping out
of the competition.

1703
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,432
- No, Luke, you don't have-
- The paint was an accident,

1704
01:16:39,474 --> 01:16:41,726
but my hesitation to tell
you about my dad wasn't.

1705
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:43,853
I don't blame you
for not believing me.

1706
01:16:43,895 --> 01:16:45,480
- Look, Luke, I
talked to your father

1707
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:46,523
and-
- I resigned.

1708
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:48,983
- That was a big step.

1709
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:50,694
- Yeah, it was the
right thing to do.

1710
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:53,738
At the end of the day,

1711
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,615
I wanna like the person
I see in the mirror.

1712
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,076
- Good.

1713
01:16:59,994 --> 01:17:01,246
'Cause I like that guy too.

1714
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:04,958
- Still?

1715
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,084
- Yes. Still.

1716
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:11,506
Because he reminds me
to believe in myself,

1717
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:13,299
and he always has.

1718
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:16,302
And that guy, he
reminds me who I can be

1719
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:17,637
when I'm not hiding.

1720
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,350
Plus he's really
fun to be around

1721
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:25,061
and I would miss him if he
wasn't in the competition.

1722
01:17:27,313 --> 01:17:29,107
- We're still talking
about me, right?

1723
01:17:30,316 --> 01:17:32,152
Are you sure you
want me to stay in?

1724
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:34,070
- Yes. I don't
want some pity win.

1725
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:36,197
That's not who I am.

1726
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,658
And Luke, I know you
didn't do it on purpose.

1727
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,411
- Okay.

1728
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:42,829
- Luke, I couldn't
do this without you.

1729
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:45,957
Please, please stay.

1730
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:49,127
- I've ruined your car.

1731
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,296
What are you gonna do?

1732
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:53,840
- Figure it out.

1733
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:56,801
(upbeat music)

1734
01:17:56,843 --> 01:17:58,178
- All right, folks,

1735
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:00,555
the moment we've all
been waiting for!

1736
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:03,308
The final restoration reveal.

1737
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,351
Who's ready?

1738
01:18:04,392 --> 01:18:07,103
(audience clapping)

1739
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:10,899
All right, first up.

1740
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:13,943
Mr. Big Gulp himself, Kevin.

1741
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:15,737
(fingers snapping)

1742
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:18,615
(audience clapping)

1743
01:18:20,575 --> 01:18:23,995
That is an impressive
showroom shine, Kev.

1744
01:18:24,037 --> 01:18:26,623
- Great job, Kevin.
It's beautifully done.

1745
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:28,625
- Precision. It's who I am.

1746
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,210
(audience clapping)

1747
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:33,129
- Next up, Michigan's
favorite son, Luke.

1748
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:40,470
(audience clapping)
(audience member whooping)

1749
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:43,848
Very impressive.

1750
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,475
Motor City will be proud.

1751
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:46,601
Well done, Luke.

1752
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,103
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

1753
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:50,230
- Now Jess, before
we reveal your car,

1754
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:52,732
I heard you ran into
a little snag when one

1755
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:55,568
of the contestants accidentally
sprayed paint on it.

1756
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:56,444
Is that true?

1757
01:18:58,279 --> 01:19:01,241
- Well, it's just a couple of
bumps along the road, Wayne,

1758
01:19:01,282 --> 01:19:03,118
but it wouldn't be a
journey without them.

1759
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:07,163
- All right, let's reveal it.

1760
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:13,503
(audience clapping)
(upbeat music)

1761
01:19:30,687 --> 01:19:31,646
Wow.

1762
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:37,652
The judges have
locked in their votes.

1763
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:42,490
Folks, your first winner ever
for "American High Gear" is

1764
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:47,537
Jess Barro!

1765
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:52,417
(audience cheering)
(uplifting music)

1766
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:01,968
And that's it for your first
season of "American High Gear."

1767
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:04,012
I'm Wayne LaRoche.

1768
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,680
We'll see you next time.

1769
01:20:05,722 --> 01:20:06,765
- Oh, too slow.

1770
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:12,228
(uplifting music continues)

1771
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:18,068
- My girl, you rocked it.

1772
01:20:19,778 --> 01:20:21,613
So proud of you.

1773
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:23,365
Look at this thing!

1774
01:20:23,406 --> 01:20:25,784
(gentle music)

1775
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:30,914
- I'm so proud of you. Jess.

1776
01:20:30,955 --> 01:20:32,540
- Barro's Auto lives on.

1777
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,460
You have no idea how
happy that makes me.

1778
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:37,754
- Okay. I gotta see this.

1779
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:44,803
- And your support.

1780
01:20:47,263 --> 01:20:50,725
- Well, it's the
least I could do.

1781
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:53,436
(glasses clinking)

1782
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:54,896
- All right, you guys. Come on.

1783
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:56,022
Get in front of Luke's car.

1784
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,190
Come on.
- Okay.

1785
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:58,608
- Hey Ray, congratulations.

1786
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:02,362
You were right to
have faith in Jess.

1787
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:05,615
- Your son's pretty
exceptional too.

1788
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:08,702
I see a lotta your dad in him.

1789
01:21:12,288 --> 01:21:15,125
- When my father said
that he wanted us both

1790
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:18,211
to run Tune Up Wiz,
I was pretty hurt.

1791
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:22,173
I thought he didn't have faith
in me to run the company,

1792
01:21:22,215 --> 01:21:23,216
but it's okay.

1793
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:25,385
I now realize that,

1794
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,429
well, he wanted the values

1795
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:29,723
that you both shared
to carry on as well.

1796
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:33,685
I think it's time that
Tune Up Wiz invested more

1797
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,478
into this community.

1798
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,647
I think it would be
great for longevity.

1799
01:21:39,816 --> 01:21:40,817
It would honor our history.

1800
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:46,823
- Why don't you
and I grab a coffee

1801
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:47,782
in the next few days and...

1802
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:49,451
- Yeah.

1803
01:21:49,492 --> 01:21:51,953
- Talk about it.

1804
01:21:51,995 --> 01:21:54,122
- That sounds really good.

1805
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:55,415
Thanks, pal.

1806
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:02,630
- Yes!

1807
01:22:02,672 --> 01:22:04,132
- Fantastic job, Jess.

1808
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:05,759
You really came into your own.

1809
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,970
So much so that the
network wants to see more,

1810
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:10,305
possibly even your own show.

1811
01:22:11,556 --> 01:22:14,184
- Are you kidding?
Have you met me?

1812
01:22:14,225 --> 01:22:15,477
- You're authentic,
you're sincere,

1813
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:18,104
you elevate this craft
into an art form.

1814
01:22:18,146 --> 01:22:20,357
Any ideas of what a
show might look like?

1815
01:22:20,398 --> 01:22:24,235
- Actually, I think I may.

1816
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:27,572
- Three.

1817
01:22:29,407 --> 01:22:32,118
- Welcome to "Community Garage,"

1818
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:35,038
the show that breathes
new life into old rides

1819
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,166
for the benefit of
organizations in needs.

1820
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,585
Thanks to our
sponsor, Tune Up Wiz,

1821
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:45,173
today we'll be restoring
this beautiful 1954 Bel Air

1822
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,925
to be sold at auction

1823
01:22:46,966 --> 01:22:48,843
with proceeds going to a rebuild

1824
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:50,261
of our local community center.

1825
01:22:51,554 --> 01:22:54,015
I will be giving it a
stylish new exterior

1826
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:57,268
while my crack mechanic, Luke
here, rebuilds the engine

1827
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,562
so it runs as good as new.

1828
01:22:59,604 --> 01:23:00,689
- As good as new?

1829
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:02,899
Better than new
if I can swing it.

1830
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:05,193
- So we'll see you
after the break.

1831
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:06,611
We are just getting started.

1832
01:23:08,905 --> 01:23:09,906
- Great job, guys.

1833
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:11,032
- Thank you, Wayne.

1834
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:12,158
Appreciate it, pal.

1835
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,493
First episode.

1836
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:14,619
Buckle up.

1837
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:17,831
- Yeah, it's gonna
be a wild ride.

1838
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:20,375
(upbeat music)
