大家好  我是约翰尼·卡什

00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:17,112
*我听见火车驶来  正经过拐弯处*
*I hear the train a comin'. It's rolling round the bend*

3
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:21,442
*我不知道有多久没见过阳光*
*And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when*

4
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:27,282
*我被关在福尔森监狱  度日如年*
*I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on*

5
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:36,472
*但那火车继续驶向圣安东*
*But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone*

6
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:41,502
*我小的时候  妈妈对我说*
*When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son*

7
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:45,662
*"做个乖孩子  别玩枪"*
*Always be a good boy. Don't ever play with guns"*

8
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:52,062
*但我在里诺枪杀了一个男人  就为了看他死去*
*But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die*

9
00:00:54,182 --> 00:01:00,732
*当我听见汽笛鸣响  我低头哭泣*
*When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry*

10
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,242
我还有15分钟
I got another 15.

11
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,692
今天不行  轮到你了
Not today, you don't. You're up.

12
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:45,512
你知道协议的
You know the deal.

13
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,872
成功完成任务
Successfully complete the mission,

14
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:49,112
你就能减刑十年
you get ten years off your sentence.

15
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:51,752
You fail to follow my orders in any way

16
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:54,120
你以任何方式不听我命令
You fail to follow my orders in any way

17
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,122
你以任何方式不听我命令

18
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:57,402
我就引爆你颅底的炸弹装置
and I detonate the explosive device in the base of your skull.

19
00:01:57,932 --> 00:01:59,172
乖狗狗
Good dog.

20
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:00,932
我们是秘密行动组
We are a black ops unit.

21
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:03,552
意味着你在这里见到的一切都没发生过
Meaning, nothing you see here ever happened.

22
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:04,542
学者
Savant.

23
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,022
你的指挥官是瑞克·弗莱格上校

24
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:08,992
还是你喜欢被称为德林
Or would you rather be called Durlin?

25
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:10,932
最好根本没人喊我
I'd rather not be called at all.

26
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:14,362
但只要能离开这鬼地方  我愿意干任何事
But I'll do anything to get out of this hellhole.

27
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:19,312
欢迎来到"任何事"
Well, welcome to "anything."

28
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:26,142
这就是大名鼎鼎的自杀小队
So this is the famous Suicide Squad.

29
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:28,582
其实我们觉得这名号很侮辱人
Well, we consider that term degrading.

30
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:30,902
官方名称是X特遣队
The official term is "Task Force X."

31
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:32,252
不管你喜欢他们还是讨厌他们
And love 'em or hate 'em,

32
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,712
这群人就是你接下来几天的亲兄弟姐妹了

40
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:16,212
各位  抱歉我来晚了  上大号去了
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late. Had to go number two.

41
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,552

00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:22,772
阿镖
Hey, Boomer.

45
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,652
你怎么又回监狱了  小哈
What are you doing back in prison, Harls?

46
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:26,912
我路怒症发作了  在银行里
I got road rage. In a bank.

47
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:28,912
真不好意思  借过一下
Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

48
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,422
-翻过来  不对  -这里吗
- Turn it around. There. No. - There? Here?

49
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,792
插进去  这下你安全了
Put it in there. Now you're safe.

50
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:34,722
好的
All right.

51
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:35,852
谢了
Thanks, man.

52
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:39,472
准备起飞  走吧
Prepare for liftoff. And away we go.

53
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:48,432
-哈莉和TDK  -迪格尔
- Harley and T.D.K... - Digger.

54
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,912
他们之前合作过吗
...have they worked together before?

55
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:50,792
没有  我很期待
Not yet. I'm excited.

56
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,072
学者是做什么的来着
What does Savant do again?

57
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:53,362
他叫布莱恩·德林
It's Brian Durlin.

58
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:55,812
他是武器专家  擅长肉搏战
He's an expert in weapons and hand-to-hand combat.

59
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:58,182
我赌20块他会挂掉
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20 on him that he's gonna bite it.

60
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:00,012
我也是  还有黄鼠狼
Me too. And Weasel,

61
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,052
-阿镖和蒙格尔  -对  我觉得...
- Boomer and Mongal. - Yeah, I think...

62
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:03,482
蒙格尔是外星人还是某种神
Is Mongal an alien or some type of god?

63
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:04,542
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

64
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:05,612
确保一切准备就绪
Just making sure everything was ready to go.

65
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,782
会议开得很好  各位
Good meeting, everybody.

66
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:09,192
就是很普通  很轻松的晨会
Just our normal, casual morning meeting.

67
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:10,552
我有件事要处理呢
Yeah, I just gotta, uh, do this thing.

68
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:12,282
没什么奇怪之处
Nothing weird about it.

69
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,622
-好的  -对
- Okay. - Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,342
弗莱格
Flag.

71
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,162
我们五分钟后空降
Yeah, we're T-minus five from the drop.

72
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:21,802
上校  把全队人马安全送到海滩
Get the whole team safely to that beach, Colonel.

73
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,092
到那里你会收到进一步命令
You will receive further orders once there.

74
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:41,502
小哈  我们身处肉店的冷冻库
We're in a butcher's freezer, Harls,

75
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,742
周围都是挂在钩子上的死猪
surrounded by dead hogs hangin' on hooks.

76
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,742
只是他们还不知道
Only they don't know it yet.

77
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:49,072
别逗他了  阿镖
Leave him alone, Boomer.

78
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:51,492
TDK全称是什么
What does T.D.K. stand for?

79
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,462
什么
What?

80
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:55,422
你叫TDK  对吗
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

81
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:56,382
是的
Yeah.

82
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,322
这几个字母代表什么
And it stands for what?

83
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:00,922
代表我
It stands for me.

84
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:02,152
名字就是这个用途
It's what a name is.

85
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,912
你的名字是由字母组成的
Your name is letters?

86
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,052
所有名字都是由字母组成的  白痴
All names are letters, dickhead.

87
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,472
我喜欢你的口音
I love your accent.

88
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,812
美国女人都喜欢异国口音
American women all love accents.

89
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:17,482
没错  因为我们自己没口音
We do. 'Cause we don't got none.

90
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:21,772
-这是只狗吗  -什么
- Yo, is this a dog? - What?

91
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:23,962
这玩意是只狗吗
Is this thing a dog?

92
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,452
-狗  -对
- A... A dog? - Yes.

93
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,832
你觉得它是哪种狗  伙计
What kind of dog do you think it is, mate?

94
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:31,002
不知道  我对品种又不熟悉
I don't know, I'm not familiar with all the breeds.

95
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,522
我猜是阿富汗猎犬
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

96
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:34,562
阿富汗猎犬什么时候还长拇指了
Since when does an Afghan Hound have bloody thumbs?

97
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,762
天啊  难道是狼人
Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

98
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,722
我一直很想见见狼人
I've wanted to meet a werewolf forever.

99
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:40,122
他们居然让我坐在狼人旁边
Yo, they sat me next to a werewolf?

100
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:40,622
这样不对
That's not right.

101
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:43,192
放我出去  我可应付不了狼人
Yo, let me out. I do not fuck with werewolves.

102
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:45,532
他不是狼人  好吗
Hey, hey, he's not a werewolf, okay!

103
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,892
他是黄鼠狼  他不会伤人
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

104
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:49,232
这么说也不对  毕竟他杀过27个儿童
I mean, he's not harmless, he's killed 27 children,

105
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:50,752
但我们说服了他...
but, you know, we got him to...

106
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:52,812
他应该同意执行这任务
I think he's agreed to do this.

107
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:53,822
不管怎么样
Whatever the case,

108
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,762
所有人就位  准备空降
just everyone get into position to drop.

109
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:17,492
放纵生活  至死是小丑

110
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,342
有人查过黄鼠狼会游泳吗
Did anyone check on whether Weasel could swim?

111
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,312
黄鼠狼死了  再说一次
The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

112
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,692
黄鼠狼死了
the Weasel is dead.

113
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,042
东北方向安全  游向岸边
Northeast, all clear. Approach the shore.

114
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:45,892
完毕
Over.

115
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:48,062
学者  保持原位
Savant, hold your position.

116
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:49,502
收到
Roger that.

117
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,512
一群外行
Amateurs.

118
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,572
沃勒  我们安全抵达海滩了
Waller, we're on the beach and dry.

119
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:36,792
-黑守卫  趴下  你...  -你们好
- Blackguard. Get down, you... - Hey, guys! Hey.

120
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:37,832
这里到处都是士兵
...there's fucking soldiers everywhere!

121
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,542
你可以出来了  只有我一个人
You can come out now, it's just me.

122
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,132
黑色守卫在搞什么
What the fuck is Blackguard doin'?

123
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,872
是我联系你的
I'm the one who contacted you.

124
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,542
这也是安排好的吗  搞什么
Is this what's supposed to happen? What the fuck?

125
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:45,872
黑色守卫  回到你的位置上去
Blackguard, get back into your position.

126
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:48,202
快看  我把所有人都带来了  看
Look, look. I brought everybody, look.

127
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:49,932
他们都在我后面
They're right behind me.

128
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,662
兄弟
Hey, guys.

129
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:55,772
我们不是说好了吗
We got a deal, right?

130
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:58,412
沃勒  我们中套了
Waller, we're made.

131
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,342
联系你们的人是我
I'm the one who called you.

132
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,632
黑色守卫出卖了我们
Blackguard sold us out.

133
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:10,722
他和柯多马堤斯部队勾搭上了
He contacted the fucking Corto Maltese Army!

134
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,312
沃勒  我们需要撤退
Waller, we need to retreat.

135
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,352
不行  弗莱格
Negative, Flag.

136
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,902
此次任务十分重要
The mission is too important.

137
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:18,122
你们是个很坚强的团队
This is a tough group.

138
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,282
-你们可以的  -那行吧
- You can make it. - Okey-doke.

139

249
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:39,652
他们可以帮你望风

250
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,522
这就是你的建议

256
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:51,952
放过她吧  好吗
so you can lay off of her, okay?

257
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:52,892
我也想跟她断了
Oh, I tried to lay off her,

258
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,022
但后来她把亲子鉴定搞出来了

259
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:56,632

I can't believe you don't care that I stole,

263
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,272
而是我怎么被抓了
only that I got caught!

264
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:07,752
我才不管你有没有被抓
I don't only care that you got caught,

265
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,102
我在乎的是你居然为了
I care that you got caught for stealing

266
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:12,242
偷电视手表这种破玩意被抓

我身上仅剩的善良已经被我的父亲榨干了
I ever had in me had been wrung out bare by my old man.

275
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:38,852
我还告诉过你离开去做你自己该做的事
And I also told you to go out there and do your own thing

276
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:40,042
和我以及我这类人
and stay far away

277
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,952
保持距离  是不是
from me or anyone like me, didn't I?

278
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:45,622
那么既然你知道我没什么好东西能给你
So, why are you here when you and I both know

279
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:48,032
你为什么要来这里
I have nothing good to offer you?

280
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:52,132
因为我的开庭日马上到了
Because my court date is coming up,

281
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,582
沃勒女士说也许你可以帮我一把
and Miss Waller said maybe you could help me out.

282
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,082
为了逼我参加你的傻逼行动
To get me to lead your shite fucking mission,

283
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:01,122
你要把我14岁的女儿送进监狱吗
you're gonna send my 14-year-old daughter to prison

284
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,022
不
No.

285
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,192
你女儿已经16岁了  杜布瓦
Your daughter is 16, DuBois.

286
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:07,092
你真是年度最佳父亲
You're a real father of the year.

287
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:09,012
行啊  我告诉你  泰拉就需要长长记性
Fine. You know what, Tyla needs to grow up anyway

288
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,622
要不她跟她那个傻妈一样没脑子
'cause she's a little ditzy like her fucking mother.

289
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,762
在少管所待一年也没问题
So, a year in juvie, no fucking problem.

290
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:16,222
不是少管所  在路易斯安那州年满16岁
Not juvie. Being 16 in the state of Louisiana

291
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,472
意味着在某些情况下
means that under the right circumstances,

292
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,632
她可以被当作成年人来审判
she could be tried as an adult.

293
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,132
而且如果定罪
And, if convicted,

294
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,632
她可能会被送到我们美梦监狱
could be sent right here to old Belle Reve.

295
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:28,382
在这里你永远不知道像她这种
And in here, well, you never know what might happen

296
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:30,162
柔弱的小东西会有什么下场
to a frail young thing like that.

297
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,002
说起来真不好意思
Shames me to say

298
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,042
我们这里的死亡率
that we have the highest mortality rate

299
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:37,842
是全美国监狱系统里最高的
in the entire U.S. prison system.

300
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:43,492
你竟敢威胁我的女儿
You're threatening my fucking daughter!

301
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:45,122
我在保护我的国家
I'm protecting this country.

302
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:47,102
-大家退下  -沃勒女士  我...
- Everyone stand down. - Miss Waller, I...

303
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:48,392
退下
Stand down!

304
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,762
我本来也不想采取这种极端方式...
I wouldn't take such extreme measures...

305
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:57,722
极端  是啊  确实有点极端
Oh, extreme? Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

306
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,822
但是这次任务的重要程度
...if this mission weren't more important

307
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:01,012
远远超出了你的想象
than you could possibly imagine.

308
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:02,292
去你妈的任务
Fuck your mission.

309
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:04,472
你有必需的军事经验
You have the military experience necessary,

310
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:06,822
而且你的心理侧写表明
and everything in your psychological profile tells me

311
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:08,572
你具有作为领队的一切特征
you have what it takes to be a leader.

312
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,292
不  我才不是什么领队
No, I'm no fucking leader!

313
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,792
我会把你打造成一个领队
Then I'll make you one.

314
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,842
你到底是加入  还是退出
Are you in or out?

315
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:25,942
很好  来见见你的队员
Good. Let's meet your team.

316
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,132
-来吧  -去你妈的
- Come on. - Fuck me, man.

317
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:32,042
走吧
Let's go.

318
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,682
她打算杀死他女儿吗
She was gonna kill his kid?

319
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:38,542
小队的每一个队员
Each member of the team is chosen

320
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:41,742
都是因为他或她的独特技能挑选出来的
for his or her own completely unique set of abilities.

321
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:46,692
这是克里斯托弗·史密斯  外号和平使者
This is Christopher Smith, known as Peacemaker.

322
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:49,232
任何东西落到他的手里都能变成致命武器
In his hands, anything is a deadly weapon.

323
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:51,082
他的父亲是一名士兵
His father was a soldier who trained his son

324
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,192
从儿子出生起就开始训练他杀人
how to kill from the moment he was born.

325
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:55,442
-你是在搞笑吗  -什么
- Are you having a laugh? - What?

326
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:56,912
你刚刚明明说每一个队员都是因为
You just said each member of the team is chosen

327
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:59,822
独特的技能被选中的  他的技能和我一模一样
for their unique abilities. He does exactly what I do.

328
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:00,812
但是更好
But better.

329
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,172
我总是能命中目标靶心
I always hit my targets dead center.

330
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:03,302
我比你更加命中
I hit them more in the center.

331
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,642
你没法更加命中靶心
Well, you can't hit something more in a center.

332
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:06,402
-我用更小的子弹  -什么
- I use smaller bullets. - What?

333
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:07,592
它们会从你的弹孔里钻过去
They go inside your bullet holes

334
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,802
连边都碰不到
without even touching the side.

335
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:11,402
下一位是鲨鱼王
Next up is King Shark.

336
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:12,862
我日
Holy shit.

337
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:14,332
搞什么
What the fuck?

338
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:15,112
《当代神话》

339
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:15,992
有人声称
Some people claim

340
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:16,572

不管怎么样  他非常强壮而且致命
Whatever the case, he's strong and deadly.

343
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:22,622
它会说话吗
Does it talk?

344
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:24,342
书  读了
Book read.

345
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:26,522
书  拿倒了
Book's upside-down.

346
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,342
看见了吗  它在假装读书
See that? It's pretending to read a book.

347
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,552
好聪明  我  好喜欢书
So smart, me. Enjoy book so much.

348
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:33,982
你们小心点
Be a mite careful,

349
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,432
他最近爱上吃人肉了
as he's developed a taste for human meat.

350
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,452
下一位是克莱奥·卡索

352
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:44,302
安静
Settle down!

353
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,432
怎么  我们请不起捕鼠者一代吗
What, we couldn't afford Ratcatcher 1?

354
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:48,252
他死了  这是他女儿
He's dead. This is his daughter.

355
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,862
卡索  你要加入我们吗
Cazo, will you be joining us?

356
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:52,742
我刚刚才醒
I just woke up.

357
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:55,252
我大清早的精神不好
I don't function well early in the morning.

358
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,422
非常抱歉打扰你了
My deepest apologies for disturbing you.

359
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,802
没关系的
Hmm, it's all right.

360
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,762
赶紧滚过来
Get your ass out here!

362
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:13,992
没门
Oh, no way.

363
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,282
-它可不能加入我们  -她可以控制老鼠
- That's not coming with us. - She controls rats.

364
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:20,042
我知道  我看出来了  真是个恶心的超能力
I know, I caught that. It's a disgusting superpower.

365
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:22,842
它叫塞巴斯蒂安  跟大家问好  塞巴斯蒂安
This is Sebastian. Say hello, Sebastian.

366

能量缓冲器
A power dampener.

370
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:36,332
他们管他叫波点人

他朝人扔波点

喂  波点人
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

376
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:50,492
我还想让你去我家孩子生日派对上助兴呢
I was hoping you'd entertain my kid's birthday party.

377
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:51,992
你个娘娘腔
You fucking pussy!

378
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:56,172
这些就是我的士兵吗
These are soldiers?

379
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,812
我们要开简报会
We need to debrief.

380
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:07,942
妈的
Fuck.

在过去的一百多年里

388
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:19,922
这个国家都被赫雷拉家族的铁腕所统治
the country has been ruled with an iron fist by the Herrera family.

389
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:23,822
但一周之前  这个家伙
But, a week ago, this guy,

希尔维奥·卢纳将军和他的得力助手

所有赫雷拉家族的人都被公开吊死了

395
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:42,832
尽管美国政府从不肯定

396
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:45,512
赫雷拉政权的暴虐行为
the excesses of the Herrera regime,

397
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:48,582
他们之前对美国也没有敌意
they were non-antagonistic toward the U.S.

398
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:52,582
不过卢纳却是激进的反美派
Luna, however, is virulently anti-American.

399
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:54,132
所以你想让我们杀了卢纳
So, you want us to kill Luna?

400
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:55,052
不
No.

401
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:57,452

409
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:12,412
但落入卢纳政权以后

410
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:17,152
该计划可能会让美国和全世界陷入动荡

00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:21,612
你们的任务就是去秘密潜入约顿海姆
Your mission is to infiltrate Jotunheim

412
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:25,072
消除"海星计划"的所有痕迹
and destroy every trace of Project Starfish.

413
00:23:25,222 --> 00:23:26,692
我们该怎么潜进去
How are we supposed to get in?

414
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:29,022
盖乌斯·格里夫斯  别名思考者
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

415
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:32,332
是负责"海星计划"的遗传学家
is a geneticist in charge of Project Starfish.

416
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:35,032
下班后  他会去一个名为可爱猫咪的
After hours, he hangs out at a gentlemen's club

417
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:37,912
男士俱乐部消遣
known as La Gatita Amable.

418
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:41,182
采用一切必要手段请格里夫斯帮助你们
Get Grieves to help you by whatever means necessary

419
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:43,142
他可以帮你们潜入约顿海姆
and he can get you into Jotunheim.

420
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:45,852
还有问题吗
Any questions?

421
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:49,072
那是什么
What is that?

422
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:52,002
那个是投影仪
That is an overhead projector.

423
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,562
你现在还会用它吗
Do you ever use it anymore?

424
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:54,872
不  基本不用了
No, not really.

425
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,892
那你为什么不扔掉它呢
So, why don't you just throw it away?

426
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:57,922
和平使者
Peacemaker?

427
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,462
海星也是表示屁眼的俚语
Starfish is a slang term for a butthole.

428
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:03,212
你觉得这是否有什么关联
Think there's any connection?

429
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:06,742
没有
No.

430
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:08,952
没有
No...

431
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:09,842
纳纳塞
Nanaue.

432
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:10,922
关联
...connection.

433
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:12,302
手
Hand.

434
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:16,122
是的  那是你的手  纳纳塞  非常棒
Yes, that is your hand, Nanaue, very good.

435
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:20,552
我们都死定了
We're all gonna die.

436
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:22,562
希望如此
I hope so.

437
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:25,742
我的天
Oh, for fuck's sake.

438
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:40,232
现在

439
00:24:49,342 --> 00:24:51,772
控制中心  南部有骚动
Control, we have a disturbance south of here.

440
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:53,702
血腥运动  那是为了声东击西
It's just a diversion, Bloodsport.

441
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,452
好了  我们穿过丛林前往山谷
All right, we cut through the jungle to get to the valley.

442
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,642
他们在城市边缘都没有封锁线吗
Don't they have blockades at the city limits?

443
00:24:58,702 --> 00:24:59,632
据说是的
That's the word.

444
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:02,642
我们怎么进去  尤其还跟着这个笨鱼头
How we getting in? Especially with Charlie the Tuna here.

445
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,092
我他妈怎么知道
How the hell am I supposed to know?

446
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:05,342
你是队长
You're the leader.

447
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:06,732
你得做决定啊
You're supposed to be decisive.

448
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:07,862
那我决定你应该吃下
And I've decided that you should eat

449
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:09,702
一大袋小鸡鸡  你觉得如何
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

450
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:11,432
你真幽默  但如果这个沙滩上
You're being facetious, but if this whole beach

451
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:12,802
全部铺满了小鸡鸡
was completely covered in dicks

452
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:13,702
然后有人告诉我
and somebody said I had to eat

453
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:15,622
要是你吃光了所有的小鸡鸡就能获得自由
every dick until the beach was clean for liberty,

454
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:16,922
我绝对会说没问题
I would say no problemo.

455
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:19,942
为什么会有人在沙滩上铺满小鸡鸡
Why would someone put penises all over the beach?

456
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,352
天晓得疯子为什么干疯事
Who knows why madmen do what they do?

457
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:22,532
你知道我怎么想的吗
Well, you know what I think?

458
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:23,992
我觉得自由只是
I think liberty is just your excuse

459
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:25,322
让你可以随心所欲的借口
to do whatever you want.

460
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,992
不论是去吃一沙滩的小鸡鸡还是去杀人
Whether that's to eat a beach full of dicks or killin' folk.

461
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:33,212
是吗
Oh, yeah?

462
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,962
至少我不会像你一样为了钱去杀人
At least I don't kill men for money like you.

463
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:38,432
又开始了
Oh, here we go.

464
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:40,622
你的皮肤好像有点不对劲
There's something wrong with your skin.

465
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,702
起了疹子而已
It's just a rash.

466
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,202
这能叫疹子
That's a rash?

467
00:25:57,882 --> 00:25:59,042
不
Oh, no.

468
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:04,272
你
You...

469
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:07,292
是唯一
are the only one...

470
00:26:08,562 --> 00:26:12,432
适合拿上我标枪的人
fit to carry my javelin.

471
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:23,142
拿上它去给
Carry it for...

472
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:46,962
拿它去给谁
Carry it for who?

473
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:49,032
给什么东西  什么情况
For what? What the heck?

474
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:50,642
我到底给把这玩意给谁
Who am I supposed to carry it for?

475
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,562
不准动  不然就打死你

476
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:54,962
这也太郁闷了
This is so frustratin'.

477
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:56,622
他刚刚告诉我为了某个原因要带上他的标枪
He just told me I have to carry this javelin

478
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:58,962
可他没解释原因就挂了
for a reason, but he didn't say why!

479
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:05,172
沃勒  沃勒  沃勒
Waller? Waller. Waller!

480
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:16,182
好了  我们在这扎营吧
All right, we'll camp here,

481
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,012
明天我们直接出发去城里
and tomorrow we'll go straight through to the city

482
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,782
这样天黑前就能到达可爱猫咪俱乐部了
to get to La Gatita Amable by nightfall.

483
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:33,372
什么
What?

484
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:53,632
你睡觉是有多沉
How deep of a sleeper are you?

485
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:56,822
我刚刚做了一个有史以来最棒的梦
I was having the most wonderful dream.

486
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:58,532
如果你梦到的是鲨鱼王吃了你
If it was you about to be eaten by King Shark,

487
00:28:58,532 --> 00:28:59,532
那你绝对是个神经病
then you're psychic.

488
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:01,382
我不相信他会那么做
I don't believe he would do that.

489
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:03,592
他的眼睛看着很善良
He has very kind eyes.

490
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,062
我很饿
Hungry.

491
00:29:09,412 --> 00:29:10,942
你个混蛋
You bastard!

492
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:27,582
好了  别再召唤老鼠了
All right, calm down with the rats!

493
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:30,302
-怎么了  -我不太喜欢老鼠
- What? - I have a thing with rats.

494
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,082
-你不太喜欢老鼠  -是的
- You have a thing with rats? - Yes.

495
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,202
-那你还和我组队  -又不是我主动要求的
- And you're on a team with me? - Not something I asked for!

496
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:36,972
你冲着我笑什么
What are you laughing at me for, man?

497
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,662
你他妈为什么只穿着内裤
Why the fuck are you in your underwear?

498
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,432
紧身三角裤[白鬼]  认真的吗
Tighty-whities? Really?

499
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:41,612
-这么说就有点种族歧视了  -没有
- Now, that's just racist. - No.

500
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:42,282
没有歧视
It's not racist.

501
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,482
-那就是紧身三角裤  -不是吧
- They're tighty-whities. - Oh, come the fuck on.

502
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:47,962
血腥运动有老鼠恐惧症
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

503
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:49,082
什么
What?

504
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:51,172
你没告诉我
You didn't tell me

505
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:53,162
你害怕老鼠  杜布瓦
you had a fear of rats, DuBois?

506
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:56,282
我是个杀手  我为什么要告诉你我怕什么
I'm an assassin! Why would I share my liabilities?

507
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:57,572
我的天
For fuck's sake.

508
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:00,622
它想送你一片好看的树叶
Aw. He's offering you a pretty leaf

509
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,782
来表明它不想伤害你
to show you he means no harm.

510
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:04,642
我他妈要一片叶子干什么用
Why the fuck would I want a leaf?

511
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:07,612
赶快把这些老鼠赶走
Just get the rats out of here!

512
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:15,932
-天呐  -酷
- Oh, fuck's sake. - Huh. Cool.

513
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:22,112
我们现在要杀了这个大傻蛋吗
Hey, we gonna kill Megalodouche now, or what?

514
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,922
纳纳塞是你们小队最强壮的
Nanaue's the strongest member of your team.

515
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,932
你们需要它来进入约顿海姆
You need him to get into Jotunheim.

516
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:27,472
如果我们得时时刻刻注意
Yeah, well, we can't function as a team

517
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:28,372
不被自己人吃掉蛋蛋
if we gotta watch our back

518
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:30,482
我们可没法作为一个小队合作
from one of our own eatin' our bollocks.

519
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:36,842
纳纳塞  你会吃你的朋友吗
Nanaue, would you eat your friends?

520
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:40,032
我没朋友
I no friends.

521
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:42,582
你没有朋友吗
You have no friends?

522
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:48,892
如果有的话  你会吃他们吗
If you did, would you eat them?

523
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:49,822
会
Yes.

524
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:57,342
不会
No?

525
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:00,372
那么  我们能当你的朋友吗
Then, can we be your friends?

526
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,522
得了吧
Come on.

527
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:03,582
他明显在骗你
He's obviously lying.

528
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:09,392
如果我因为把赌注压在爱上而死
If I die 'cause I gambled on love,

529
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:12,902
那就算死了也是值得的
it will be a worthy death.

530
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:15,512
好朋友
Friends.

531
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:25,512
你真是个小傻子
You are a little idiot.

532
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:38,262
天哪  天哪  我真是一把好手
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I'm good at my job.

533
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:39,112
我找到他了
I found him.

534
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:40,132
来看看
Check it out.

535
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:43,132
看  就在这  往北一英里
Look, right here, a mile north.

536
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:45,352
X特遣队
Task Force X,

537
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:47,272
你们有一项额外的任务指令
you have an additional mission directive.

538
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:49,242
我们找到了瑞克·弗莱格上校
We've located Colonel Rick Flag.

539
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,602
他被敌人俘虏了
He's been taken by the enemy.

540
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:51,692
瑞克·弗莱格
Rick Flag?

541
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:52,872
我知道  你们曾经在古拉克那支
I know, you both served

542
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:55,942
抓获了阿夫拉尔·卡达姆的特种部队一起服役过
on special forces in Qurac that took down Avral Kaddam.

543
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:58,172
弗莱格就是最初推荐你的人
Flag was the one who initially recommended you.

544
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,902
你在柯多马堤斯还有其他特工小队
You had other operatives in Corto Maltese

545
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,072
却不告诉我们
and didn't tell us?

546
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,712
之前保密是因为没有战术优势  现在有了
There was no tactical advantage, now there is.

547
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:09,172
我把地点上传到了你的信息传输系统里
I've uploaded the location on your MTS.

548
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:13,282
采用极端武力解决俘虏他的人
Terminate his captors with extreme prejudice.

549
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:18,032
杀了所有你见到的人  他们都是极度危险的人
Kill anyone you see. These are dangerous people.

550
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:20,852
前往市里前先救出弗莱格
Recover Flag before moving on to the city.

551
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,652
那就是他们关押弗莱格的地方
That's where they're holding Flag.

552
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,322
没有比用一场大屠杀开启一天更美妙的事了
Nothing like a bloodbath to start the day.

553
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,582
他们叫你和平使者呢
They call you Peacemaker?

554
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:34,522
我全身心地珍惜和平
I cherish peace with all my heart.

555
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:35,592
无论要杀多少男人  女人  小孩
I don't care how many men, women,

556
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:37,282
只要能得到和平  在所不惜
and children I need to kill to get it.

557
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,892
我还以为你是最疯的
I thought you were the crazy one.

558
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:42,672
我确实是
I am.

559
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,202
好了
All right.

560
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:45,422
我们行动吧
Let's get it.

561
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:49,792
老大
Boss.

562
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:51,582
谢谢
Gracias.

563
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:39,922
不  不  不
No, no, no!

564
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:10,922
没有一击致命
Non-lethal.

565
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:11,952
你输了
You lose.

566
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,062
爆炸式压缩子弹
Exploding compression bullets.

567
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:19,232
没人喜欢臭显摆的家伙
No one likes a show-off.

568
00:35:19,232 --> 00:35:22,162
除非他们显摆的东西酷毙了
Unless what they're showing off is dope as fuck.

569
00:35:24,742 --> 00:35:27,272
操  那确实
Fuck. That's true.

570
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:44,222
他的确会朝别人扔波点
He does throw polka dots at people.

571
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:47,572
很抱歉  看起来这么华丽
I'm sorry it's so... flamboyant.

572
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:49,792
挺酷的  我觉得嘛
It looks cool. I think.

573
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:51,352
我不喜欢杀人
I don't like to kill people,

574
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:53,912
但如果我假装他们是我妈妈  那就轻松多了
but if I pretend they're my mom, it's easy.

575
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:55,502
信息量太多了  大哥
T.M.I., mate.

576
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:05,872
杜布瓦
DuBois?

577
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:07,352
弗莱格
Hey, Flag.

578
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,232
你在这里干什么
What the hell are you doing here?

579
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:13,112
沃勒跟我们说你被...
Waller told us that you were...

580
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,042
你在喝茶吗
Are you drinkin' tea?

581
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:18,292
这是索尔·索里娅
This is Sol Soria,

582
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:19,942
她是自由战士的领袖
she's the leader of the freedom fighters,

583
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:22,472
那支想扳倒当下政府的反抗军
the resistance trying to take down the current government.

584
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,712
他们救了我的命
They saved my life.

585
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:31,742
为什么我的人没提醒我你们来了
Why did my people not alert me of your arrival?

586
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:34,862
我们一个人都没看见
We didn't see any people.

587
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:35,962
没错  我一路上一个人都没看见
Yeah, I didn't see anybody on the way...

588
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:36,862
外面根本没人
There's no one out there.

589
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,592
我们来的时候他们已经走了
They were gone when we got here.

590
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:41,102
我在脑子里把他们想成是妈妈然后杀了他们
I turned them into my mother in my head and killed them.

591
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:02,012
典型的美国人  凭借着武力闯进来
Typical Americans. Just run in, guns blazing.

592
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:04,702
我知道  太操蛋了
I know, this is messed up.

593
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,522
-这些家伙  他们...  -这个是干吗用的
- These guys, they're... - What's this one do?

594
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,972
他们就是帮白痴
They're fucking idiots,

595
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:13,572
但现在我们的目标和你一致
but right now our objectives align with yours.

596
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,042
如果约顿海姆里有
If Jotunheim contains the technology

597
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,632
我们的情报机构声称的那项技术
our intelligence says it does,

598
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:19,462
那就很可能被用在柯多马堤斯的人民身上
then it could be used on the people of Corto Maltese

599
00:37:19,472 --> 00:37:20,922
也可以被用在美国人身上
as well as Americans.

600
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:23,852
这就是为什么我们需要你的帮助
That's why we need your help

601
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:26,012
来进入那座城市  这样我们就能阻止他们
to get into the city so we can stop 'em.

602
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,812
那只老鼠在向我挥手吗
Is that rat waving at me?

603
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:36,712
看上去是的
It appears it is.

604
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,852
为什么
Why?

605
00:37:39,582 --> 00:37:41,322
我猜是因为它很友善
I'm gonna guess because it's friendly.

606
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:46,912
卢纳和苏亚雷斯谋杀了我全家
Luna and Suarez murdered my entire family.

607
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:51,482
为了阻止他们  我愿意与魔鬼交易
I'd make a deal with the Devil to stop them.

608
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:57,902
我会帮助你的人进入德尔马山谷
Your people will have our help getting to Valle Del Mar

609
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,962
逮捕这个盖乌斯·格里夫斯
to apprehend this Gaius Grieves.

610
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:21,452
-怎么回事  -你杀害了我的雇员
- What is this? - You slaughtered my staff!

611
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:23,912
他们对赫雷拉效忠
They were loyal to the Herreras.

612
00:38:24,162 --> 00:38:26,592
你对谁效忠  思考者
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

613
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:28,852
他们叫你"思考者"  没错吧
They call you "Thinker", yes?

614
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:32,752
脸上的那堆东西是为了让你的大脑更强
All that shit in your face is to make your brain good?

615
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:35,202
没错  让我的大脑更强
Yes, makes my brain good.

616
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,932
你是在用讽刺的语气跟我说话吗  臭婊子
Are you being sarcastic with me? Puta!

617
00:38:39,422 --> 00:38:42,142
我要让你变得和你雇员一样
I shall do to you as we did to your employees.

618
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:43,232
马特奥
Hey. Mateo!

619
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:45,022
别像个小孩一样

620
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:50,862
这是什么
What is this?

621
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:54,842
"海星计划"
Project Starfish.

622
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:57,672
这是我这三十年来
It's been the primary focus of my experiments here

623
00:38:57,682 --> 00:39:00,022
研究的首要重心
for the past 30 years.

624
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,372
看看这些鲁莽的美国人

625
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:05,882
没有任何防范措施就把这个怪物带进了机舱

626
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:09,472
这是  这是在干什么
Here. What... What is it doing here?

627
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:14,192
它在生小宝宝
It is having little babies.

628
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:15,802
这些不是它的孩子
Not progeny,

629
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,382
是它自己的延伸
extensions of itself.

630
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:20,942
它们寄生在宿主身上
They take hosts,

631
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,312
那些宿主则变成了它中枢器官的一部分
and those hosts in turn become part of the central being.

632
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:29,562
它以这些宿主的意识为食
It feeds on their consciousnesses.

633
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:34,372
变得更大  更强
Grows larger, more powerful.

634
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:41,662
那么
So...

635
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:47,592
"海星计划"现在在哪
where is this Project Starfish now?

636
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:59,802
关于怪物的传言是真的

637
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:04,682
如果把这个怪物放在美国

638
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:07,152
肯定能摧毁他们

639
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:08,602
不  马特奥

640
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:12,902
有了这么强大的武器  整个世界都将对我们另眼相待

641
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,532
我们会变成超级大国  马特奥

642
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,932
非常好的主意  总统
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

643
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:22,072
但是据我所知
But as I've noted,

644
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:25,352
我已经研究这个怪物30年了
I've been working with the beast for 30 years.

645
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:30,282
只有我能控制它
And there's no one but me capable of controlling it.

646
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,702
这样的话
Well, then...

647
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,302
欢迎加入
welcome to the team.

648
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:43,212
卡米拉
Si, Camila.

649
00:40:43,212 --> 00:40:44,582
总统
Presidente.

650
00:40:44,682 --> 00:40:47,482
您要找的犯人找到了

651
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,832
与此同时
哈莉

652
00:40:49,832 --> 00:40:51,572
你们犯了个严重的错误
哈莉
You are making a big mistake

653
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:52,592
你们不该把我扔在这里
哈莉
throwing me down here!

654
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:54,072
等我马上出去
哈莉
I will be outta here soon enough

655
00:40:54,072 --> 00:40:54,212
与此同时
哈莉

656
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:55,790
我一定把你们全部干掉
哈莉
and I will kill every last one of you,

657
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,152
我一定把你们全部干掉
and I will kill every last one of you,

658
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:59,822
柯多马堤斯  马拉斯
Colto Maltese-tezios. Maltese-els.

659
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:02,442
马慕斯  还是柯多阿慕斯来着
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

660
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:06,592
不管你们叫什么  我说到做到
Whatever you Mario Kart-racing d-bags are called!

661
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:08,722
拜托了
Please.

662
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:10,842
换上这个
Put this on.

663
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:30,742
我就是位公主
I'm a princess.

664
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:55,022
奎茵小姐
Senorita Quinn,

665
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:58,142
我代表希尔维奥·埃莱乌特里奥·卢纳总统
on behalf of the entire staff of Our Honorable General

666
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:00,202
全体员工
Presidente Silvio Eleuterio Luna,

667
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:01,982
很荣幸为您服务
it's a pleasure to serve you.

668
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:04,232
谢谢
Gracias.

669
00:42:05,882 --> 00:42:10,092
妈妈说要从后往前数
My mother said to count back again.

670
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:12,292
十  九
Ten, nine,

671
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,712

672
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:16,872
五  四  三
five, four, three,

673
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:21,312
二  一  克罗内尔  我赢了
two, one. Ha! Coronel, beat that...

674
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:31,592
请原谅我的唐突  奎茵小姐
Forgive my appearance, Senorita Quinn.

675
00:42:33,032 --> 00:42:36,572
我倾慕于您
I have admired you from afar

676
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,352
已经很多年了
for many years now.

677
00:42:39,112 --> 00:42:40,312
小姐
Senorita.

678
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:42,602
我
Me?

679
00:42:42,662 --> 00:42:46,382
您是我和我人民的英雄
You're a hero to me, as well as to my people.

680
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:48,372
你让我有点糊涂了
I think you might got me confused.

681
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:50,432
哈莉·奎茵的热情和
Harley Quinn's fire and rebellion

682
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:52,092
面对美国压迫时的反抗精神
in the face of American oppression

683
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:54,732
让我的国家尤为敬佩
is something to which my entire country aspires.

684
00:42:55,622 --> 00:42:56,872
我准备了午餐
I have prepared lunch.

685
00:42:58,552 --> 00:43:00,612
可以赏光与我共进午餐吗
Would you be so kind as to join me?

686
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,782
好的  当然
I'm so kind, sure.

687
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:04,632
你让我干什么
You want me to what?

688
00:44:06,762 --> 00:44:08,112
嫁给我
To marry me.

689
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,452
你开玩笑吧
You're joshing.

690
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:12,342
我能跟你说实话吗  哈莉
Might I be frank, Harley?

691
00:44:13,252 --> 00:44:14,362
可以啊
You might be.

692
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:17,532
好  你听我说
Good, listen.

693
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:20,762
从我掌权以来  大部分人很支持我
Since I took control, the majority love me.

694
00:44:20,762 --> 00:44:24,102
但是有一些人
But some find me to be

695
00:44:24,892 --> 00:44:26,802
无法接受我的领导
an unacceptable leader.

696
00:44:27,662 --> 00:44:29,952
这都是群什么傻逼
What kinds of dicks would find that?

697
00:44:29,952 --> 00:44:31,882
他们看不到你有多优秀吗
Don't they know how awesome you are?

698
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:33,452
你有没有给他们看那些小鸟
Have you shown them the birdies?

699
00:44:33,452 --> 00:44:35,072
对你和你那个世界的人来说
It may sound archaic

700
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,542
这可能有点老掉牙
to someone from your part of the world,

701
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,282
但是我的人民  柯多马堤斯人
but my people, the Corto Malteseans,

702
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:40,402
他们非常传统
they're very old-fashioned.

703
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:42,742
柯多马堤斯人  我怎么忘了
Corto Malteseans, of course.

704
00:44:42,822 --> 00:44:44,392
而我是个单身汉
And I am a bachelor.

705
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:47,202
所以他们希望你能有个家吗
So they want you to get hitched?

706
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:49,672
我的人民觉得你是合适的新娘人选
My people say you would make the perfect wife.

707
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:51,132
因为  你知道的
Because, you know,

708
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:53,352
你象征着反抗美国的热潮
you symbolize anti-American fervor.

709
00:44:56,732 --> 00:44:58,502
但我是很浪漫的人  哈莉
But I am a romantic, Harley.

710
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:02,622
我当时同意跟你见面是为了安抚他们
I agreed to meet with you just to appease them.

711
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:07,392
但是  跟你接触了这么多天以来
However, upon spending the day with you,

712
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:12,342
我发现自己几乎无法正常思考
I find myself hardly able to think straight.

713
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:16,442
-你就是完美  -你太性感了
- You are perfect in every... - You are so freaking hot.

714
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:42,432
哈莉·卢纳
Harley Luna.

715
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:46,442
我喜欢这个名字
I like the ring of that.

716
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:12,742
那是约顿海姆吗
That's Jotunheim?

717
00:46:15,592 --> 00:46:19,652
二战后  纳粹来这里寻求避难所
Nazis came here seeking asylum after World War II.

718
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:24,422
他们建造了约顿海姆
They built Jotunheim to continue

719
00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:26,432
继续他们恶毒的实验
their unorthodox experiments.

720
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:31,992
直至赫雷拉家族接受了悬赏
Until the Herrera family accepted the bounty

721
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:33,542
把他们消灭殆尽
and killed them all.

722
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:37,512
许多年前  这里出现了关于怪物的传言
Many years ago, the rumors began of a beast.

723
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:42,132
这些恐怖传言帮助了赫雷拉家族
These dark rumors helped the Herrera family

724
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:43,802
他们把政敌及他们的家人
They would send their political enemies

725
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:46,162
送去了城堡中
and their families to the fortress,

726
00:46:46,162 --> 00:46:47,382
这些人再也没有回来
never to return.

727
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:51,782
我最近才知道
I have recently learned

728
00:46:52,282 --> 00:46:53,952
这并不是谣言
these were not rumors.

729
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:56,502
他们利用这个怪物
They were murdering thousands

730
00:46:56,792 --> 00:47:00,352
已经在各种邪恶实验中谋害了上千人的性命
in bizarre experiments with this creature.

731
00:47:01,742 --> 00:47:02,722
它现在在你手上
Well, it must be a big relief

732
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:04,522
你一定轻松了不少吧
to got it in your hands now, huh?

733
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:06,642
当然
Absolutely.

734
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:11,572
现在轮到我们的敌人该害怕了
Now, it is our enemies who shall be fearful.

735
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:15,752
如果任何人敢反对
If anyone dares to say a negative word

736
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,502
他们如今的新总统
about their new president today,

737
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:22,692
他们的父母  孩子  所有他们爱的人
their parents, their children, and anyone they ever loved

738
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:26,812
都会被送去约顿海姆  成为怪物的美餐
will be sent to Jotunheim to feed the beast.

739
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:29,432
抱歉
I'm sorry.

740
00:47:32,472 --> 00:47:34,182
最近我对自己发誓
Recently, I made a promise to myself

741
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:35,922
下次我再交男朋友的时候
that the next time I got a boyfriend,

742
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:37,332
我会仔细关注任何危险信号
I'd be on the lookout for red flags.

743
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:38,702
一旦发现存在
And if I saw any,

744
00:47:38,712 --> 00:47:40,202
我要做健康的选择
I would do the healthy thing

745
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,592
把他杀死
and I would murder him.

746
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:46,512
比如杀害小孩
And killing kids?

747
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:49,622
就是个危险信号
Kind of a red flag.

748
00:47:50,962 --> 00:47:52,062
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

749
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:53,152
我知道你想要说
I know what you're tryin' to say.

750
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,952
哈莉  你不能直接离开我吗
"Harley, why not just leave?"

751
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:57,052
然后我会说  你为什么朝我大喊大叫
And I'd say, "Why are you screaming at me?

752
00:47:57,052 --> 00:47:59,092
我又不是聋子  我就站在这
"I'm not deaf. I'm standing right here."

753
00:47:59,472 --> 00:48:00,592
然后我会说
And then I'd say,

754
00:48:01,722 --> 00:48:05,212
当你选男人的品味和我一样差的时候
"When your taste in men is as bad as mine,

755
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:08,652
他们不会就这样默默离开你
they don't just go away quietly.

756
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:13,432
他们会割破你的轮胎  之后杀掉你的小狗
"They slash your tires and they kill your dogs and

757
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:14,702
还会告诉你  你喜欢的音乐
tell you that the music you like

758
00:48:14,702 --> 00:48:16,082
根本算不上真正的音乐
ain't real music at all."

759
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:18,132
所有这残忍的一切
And all the cruelty...

760
00:48:24,992 --> 00:48:27,072
会将你的心慢慢撕碎
...tears you apart after a while.

761
00:48:40,092 --> 00:48:41,972
你真的很帅
You were real pretty and all,

762
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:46,122
愿你两腿之间美丽的猛兽
and R.I.P. To that absolutely beautiful monster

763
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,752
能得到安息
between your legs, but...

764
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,072
但总而言之
all in all...

765
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:54,372
我觉得你现在脑子里
I think you're more pretty like this

766
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:58,172
没有那些腐坏的念头  看上去更加帅气了
with all those rotten thoughts emptied from your head.

767
00:49:01,432 --> 00:49:03,222
真不敢相信这玩意居然有子弹
I can't believe this thing had a bullet.

768
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:07,532
举起手

769
00:49:07,532 --> 00:49:08,782
好  好  好  我明白
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

770
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:10,992
好  好  好  我明白
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

771
00:49:17,992 --> 00:49:22,532
将军们一致同意将由你来继任总统  参谋长

772
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:27,412
除了反抗军以外  应该没有反对的声音

773
00:49:27,912 --> 00:49:30,372
希尔维奥就像我的兄弟

774
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,792
但是他一直以来太浪漫主义

775
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:37,132
他希望这个世界能正视他

776
00:49:39,512 --> 00:49:41,762
但是他却忙着和自己的鸟玩

777
00:49:49,062 --> 00:49:51,602
俄罗斯  美国  中国

778
00:49:52,862 --> 00:49:55,692
在被野兽咬到前  都不屑正视我们

779
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:09,712
苏亚雷斯总统

780
00:50:09,892 --> 00:50:11,252
我们怎么处理奎茵

781
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,712
我会套取她知道的情报

782
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:17,002
但是我怀疑她并不是美国派来的最后一员

783
00:50:17,002 --> 00:50:19,922
去城里搜索美国人  然后

784
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:24,252
带自杀小队成员的人头来见我

785
00:50:27,962 --> 00:50:29,142
你到底在干什么
What the hell are you doin'?

786
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:33,772
我们累了  上校  我们需要休息
We're tired, Colonel. We need a rest.

787
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:35,212
一帮该死的业余人士
Goddamn hobbyists.

788
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:36,942
我们不能停下来
We cannot stop.

789
00:50:37,062 --> 00:50:38,782
我们得抓紧时间  如果你要帮助我的人民
We need to hurry if you're going to help my people.

790
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:40,912
等等  我们不是为了帮助你的人民
Hey. We're not here to help your people.

791
00:50:41,262 --> 00:50:43,012
但她说的没错  我们要继续前进
But she's right, we gotta keep moving.

792
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:45,172
我背朋友
I carry friend?

793
00:50:45,882 --> 00:50:47,722
没关系  纳纳塞
It's okay, Nanaue.

794
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:52,592
他脸上又开始了
It's happening to his face again.

795
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:54,372
-没什么  我滑倒了  -等一下
- It's nothing, I slipped. - Hey...

796
00:50:54,462 --> 00:50:57,482
诺曼·贝茨  如果那玩意会传染  我们需要知道
Norman Bates, if that shit's contagious, we need to know.

797
00:50:57,482 --> 00:50:58,452
不会的
It's not.

798
00:51:00,132 --> 00:51:01,642
-那是什么  -这是
- What is it? - It's a...

799
00:51:04,382 --> 00:51:06,202
这是一种跨维度病毒
It's an interdimensional virus.

800
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:09,782
什么玩意
Fuck is that?

801
00:51:11,132 --> 00:51:13,342
我母亲是星辰实验室的科学家
My mother was a scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs,

802
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:14,972
她执着于让我
and she was obsessed with turning me

803
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:17,582
和我的兄弟姐妹变成超级英雄
and my brothers and sisters into superheroes.

804
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:21,002
她感染了我
She infected me.

805
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:24,552
现在  如果我不一天两次排出波点
Now, if I don't, you know, expel the dots twice a day...

806
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,412
会怎么样
Then what?

807
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:30,382
它们会将我吞噬
They'll eat me alive.

808
00:51:32,142 --> 00:51:34,122
你的兄弟姐妹怎么样了
What happened to your brothers and sisters?

809
00:51:36,892 --> 00:51:38,092
有些活了下来
Some lived.

810
00:51:38,412 --> 00:51:39,442
有些
Some...

811
00:51:41,752 --> 00:51:42,882
死了
died.

812
00:51:43,822 --> 00:51:46,552
那你妈妈呢  现在她在哪
And your mom, where is she now?

813
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:52,942
无处不在
Everywhere.

814
00:52:00,732 --> 00:52:03,462
好了  继续走
Okay. Let's move out.

815
00:52:03,462 --> 00:52:04,912
快点  我们要抓紧了
Come on, we must hurry,

816
00:52:04,912 --> 00:52:06,802
不然我们就赶不上我的接头人了
or we'll be late to meet my contact.

817
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:17,322
*我听见那些人在说着什么*
*I heard the men saying something*

818
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,002
*船长说他们给了你丰厚的报酬*
*The captains tell they pay you well*

819
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:23,902
*他们说他们需要船员*
*And they say they need sailing men to*

820
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:26,672
*在今天为他们指路  带他们离开*
*Show the way and leave today*

821
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:30,052
*是你问  要多久*
*Was it you that said How long*

822
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:40,652
-给我看你的许可证  -好的  等一下

823
00:52:46,192 --> 00:52:47,242
你在找人吗

824
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:48,912
我没有  只是...

825
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:51,202
稍等一下

826
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:54,122
你从哪里来

827
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:55,912
怎么说呢  我...

828
00:52:57,332 --> 00:52:58,332
稍等...

829
00:52:58,332 --> 00:52:59,252
我看看

830
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,092
开门

831
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:05,462
里面有什么

832
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:06,302
下车  快点

833

你是米尔顿吗
Are you Milton?

835
00:53:23,172 --> 00:53:24,822
是
Si.

836
00:53:28,492 --> 00:53:30,302
米尔顿会开车送你穿过小镇
Milton will drive you through town

837
00:53:30,302 --> 00:53:31,752
然后到可爱猫咪俱乐部

838
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:33,742
箱子里有你们所有人的衣服
There are clothes in the boxes for all of you

839
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:35,022
方便你们混进去

840
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:38,122
也就是说  那个行走的鲨鱼
That said, the walking tiburon

841
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:39,752
不可以出现

842
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,552
我穿伪装
I wear disguise.

843
00:53:42,162 --> 00:53:45,322
你也要伪装啊
Oh, you're going to wear a disguise.

844
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,052
对
Si.

845
00:53:46,052 --> 00:53:47,632
他在学西班牙语

846
00:53:47,652 --> 00:53:49,402
什么样的伪装
And what kind of disguise?

847
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:52,092
-假胡子  -嗷
- Fake mustache. - Oh.

848
00:53:52,102 --> 00:53:54,932
假胡子可不行  伙计
Yeah, fake mustache isn't gonna cut it, mate.

849
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:01,952
会有许多士兵监视约顿海姆
There's gonna be a lot of soldiers watching Jotunheim.

850
00:54:03,132 --> 00:54:04,062
如果他们发现我们...
If they discover us there...

851
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:06,702
让我们祈祷他们不会  不然我们都得死
Let's pray they do not, or you will all be dead.

852
00:54:06,712 --> 00:54:07,902
如果发现了
If they do,

853
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,382
那城堡的防御肯定会减弱
that'll leave the palace vulnerable.

854
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:13,792
卢纳和其他将军
Luna and the other generals

855
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,282
将会失去保护
will be left without protection.

856
00:54:23,452 --> 00:54:25,522
你是个好人  弗莱格上校
You're a good man, Colonel Flag.

857
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:31,702
你看起来还是和自己一模一样
You still look exactly like yourself.

858
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:33,522
这是我见过最失败的假胡子
That's the worst fake mustache I've ever seen.

859
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:35,922
如果你骗了我们  我们就得杀掉你
And if you had fooled us, we'd have to kill you,

860
00:54:36,312 --> 00:54:37,962
长着胡子的鲨鱼样家伙
shark-shaped bloke with a moustache

861
00:54:37,962 --> 00:54:39,442
不能悄悄靠近我们
creeping up on us like that.

862
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:42,642
你  你
You, you.

863

他一直想接近你
He always wants to be near you.

864

我觉得他感受到了你好的一面
I think he senses good in you.

865
00:54:53,402 --> 00:54:55,342
我可没有什么好的
Yeah, there's no good in me.

866
00:55:00,402 --> 00:55:01,502
该死
Damn.

867
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:03,972
我这周末要和克雷参议员打高尔夫
Supposed to play golf with Senator Cray this weekend.

868
00:55:03,972 --> 00:55:05,652
我会看起来像个傻子
I'm gonna look a fool.

869
00:55:06,492 --> 00:55:07,692
沃勒  接入

沃勒  你收到了吗
Waller, do you copy?

872
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:14,392
我们失去联系了
We're losing connection.

873
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,342
沃勒
Waller.

874
00:55:19,852 --> 00:55:21,012

你在吗
You there?

877
00:55:24,802 --> 00:55:25,932
军队一定在城市各处
The military must have put

878
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,792
安置了信号干扰器
signal jammers around the city.

879
00:55:28,362 --> 00:55:29,192
你的讯号中断了
Your comms are down,

880
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,052
但我们仍然可以启动炸弹
but we can still activate the bombs,

881
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:33,452
更别提你女儿的事了
not to mention what will happen to your daughter.

882
00:55:33,452 --> 00:55:35,062
所以  别搞花活
So, no funny business.

883

关于他女儿的那些事
Hey, uh, all that stuff about his daughter,

887
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,802
你不会真的这么干的  对吧
you wouldn't really do that, right?

888
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,912
你根本不知道老娘要干什么  约翰
You don't know half of what I would do, John.

889
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:10,812
干什么
What?

890
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,112
你为什么这么怕老鼠
Why are you so afraid of rats?

891
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:19,092
你又为什么这么爱它们呢  捕鼠者二代
Why are you so in love with them, Ratcatcher 2?

892

你知道我怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

893
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:24,902
我觉得你有很严重的恋父情结
I think you have a serious case of daddy issues.

894
00:56:25,152 --> 00:56:28,272
我可没到恋父的地步

895
00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:39,182
尽管他是个天才
Although he was a genius...

896
00:56:41,972 --> 00:56:44,292
我们在葡萄牙街头流离失所
we lived homeless in the streets of Portugal

897
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:45,712
都是因为他的

898
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:49,952
负担
burdens.

899

他制造了我现在使用的机器
He built the machines I employ today...

900
00:56:56,702 --> 00:56:59,362
还教了我召唤老鼠的秘诀
...and taught me the secrets of calling the rats.

901
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,972
他们给我们送来小饰品维持生计
They brought us trinkets to live on.

902
00:57:07,412 --> 00:57:09,002
晚上它们给我们温暖
And they kept us warm at night,

903
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,642
让我们不至于被冻僵
when we would have frozen.

904
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:16,082
-但是最终  -爸爸
- But eventually... - Papa.

905
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:18,232
爸爸  醒醒
Papa, wake up.

906
00:57:18,232 --> 00:57:19,982
我爸爸的负担
My father's burdens

907
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:22,992
重到难以承受
became too heavy to carry.

908
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:24,542
不
No.

909
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:25,922
不要走  爸爸
No, Papa.

910
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:28,582
-他还是走了  -爸爸  醒醒
- And he was gone. - Papa, wake up.

911
00:57:33,922 --> 00:57:36,582
我带着他的机器来到了美国
I took his machinery and came to America.

912
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:38,572
美国梦啊
That is the dream, right?

913
00:57:40,472 --> 00:57:41,952
但是我被捕了
But I was arrested

914
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:45,332
因为持械抢劫银行  你相信吗
for armed bank robbery, do you believe it?

915
00:57:45,582 --> 00:57:47,732
政府认为老鼠是一种武器
The state considered the rats a weapon.

916
00:57:51,352 --> 00:57:52,502
怎么了
What?

917
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:57,212
你让我想起了我女儿
You remind me of my daughter,

918
00:57:58,592 --> 00:58:00,002
她是我来这里的原因
the reason I'm here.

919
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:04,092
你为什么这么怕老鼠
Why are you so afraid of rats?

920
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:06,352
我父亲
My old man.

921
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:09,532
我小时候
When I was a lad,

922
00:58:09,932 --> 00:58:11,582
只要我没有完成好任务
if I didn't finish a task right,

923
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:13,752
他就会惩罚我
he would dole out the punishment.

924
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:19,912
有一天  他把我锁在箱子里24小时
And one day, he just locked me in a crate for 24 hours.

925
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:24,362
里面全是饥肠辘辘的老鼠
And it was full of starvin' rats.

926
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:28,692
我父亲并不是个完美的人
As imperfect my father was...

927
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,922
但他爱我
he loved me.

928
00:58:38,102 --> 00:58:40,192
我希望让你也感受到这份爱
I wish I could give that to you.

929
00:58:43,472 --> 00:58:44,872
你不用担心
Don't you worry, yeah?

930
00:58:45,312 --> 00:58:47,092
我会带你活着离开这里
I'm going to get you out of here alive.

931
00:58:48,152 --> 00:58:51,252
是我会带你活着离开这里
I'm gonna get you out of here alive.

932
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,662
先生们  到地方了

933
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:15,722
*也许我一直在朝着南方倒退*

934
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:17,372
在一个星期二晕了车

任何地方都有可能藏着美国人

974
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:03,382
让我进去

975

01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:35,032
就算有我帮忙  你觉得就能进得了约顿海姆吗
Even with my help, you think you can get into Jotunheim?

983
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:37,292
如果不行的话  我们可有只大白鲨
Well, if we can't, I've got a Great White

984
01:02:37,292 --> 01:02:39,122

别担心

但你们必须向我们出示身份证

993
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:09,822

把他从后门带出去

在平板上找到我的位置  半小时后见
Find my coordinates in the pad and meet me in half an hour.

你的装备能操控动物的行为  很聪明

麻烦你安静点

看你慌张的样子

I'm guessing that you are not the alphas of this battalion.

1017
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:36,482
你想尝尝一群愤怒的老鼠爬上你屁股的滋味吗
Do you want a dozen angry rodents crawling up your ass?

1018
01:04:37,202 --> 01:04:39,112
我的回答可能没法让你满意
My answer might not be what you expect.

1019
01:04:40,962 --> 01:04:42,112
走  快走
Go, go!

1020
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:50,162
*有时我不介意下雨*

活不久了
Not for long.

苏亚雷斯少将在审讯时

1027
01:05:10,402 --> 01:05:12,272

1036
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:51,682
但那是概率的问题
But it's a matter of chance,

1037
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:54,142
没法一定成功
and cannot be wielded with certainty.

1038
01:05:55,322 --> 01:05:57,692
-他们都这么说  -他们

1054
01:08:29,562 --> 01:08:32,722
和你一起来到了柯多马堤斯

你怎么把六十九个人带进...

1059
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:11,722
没有好妈妈来拯救我
Won't some sweet mama come and rescue me...

1060
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:34,572
你在逗我吧
You gotta be kiddin' me.

1061
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:35,872
你为了一个打扮成宫廷小丑的神经病
You're gonna risk the entire mission

1062
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:37,752
不惜拿这整个行动去冒险
for a mental defective dressed as a court jester.

1063
01:09:37,752 --> 01:09:39,792
你自己头上还戴马桶圈呢
This coming from a guy that wears a toilet seat on his head.

1064
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:41,252
我们不会抛下任何一个人
We don't leave one of our own behind.

1065

你没意见吗

有  但弗莱格还戴着肚兜时我就在他引起了
No, but I've been around Flag when he's got a rag in his mouth.

好  我们从三楼进入
All right, we'll enter through the third floor,

1071
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,272
走内部楼梯  然后下到地窖
go to the inner staircase, and then down to the cellar

1072
01:09:58,272 --> 01:10:00,062
他们通常在那里关押囚犯
where they usually keep their detainees.

1073
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:01,432
希望哈莉还活着
Hopefully, Harley's still alive.

1074
01:10:01,982 --> 01:10:04,142
这不是马桶圈  这是自由的灯塔
It's not a toilet seat, it's a beacon of freedom!

1075
01:10:11,112 --> 01:10:13,032
她醒来时告诉我

1076
01:10:13,532 --> 01:10:16,832
看看砍掉她的手指能不能唤起她的记忆

1077
01:14:10,272 --> 01:14:11,022
你好
Hola.

1078
01:14:20,242 --> 01:14:21,452

01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,692
纳纳塞  别上通讯器

1085
01:15:00,702 --> 01:15:03,192
上校  我瞄准了办公室里唯一的一个人
Colonel, I got a clean shot on the only one in the office.

1086
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:04,402
只等你下令
Just give the word.

1087
01:15:13,302 --> 01:15:15,712
开火倒计时  三  二
Fire on three, two...

1088
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:16,962
你们在干什么
What are you guys doing?

1089
01:15:18,512 --> 01:15:21,502
我  你  我们来救你的
I... You. We're here to save you.

1090

你是来  救我的
You were gonna... save me?

1091
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:28,552
而且是个很好的计划
It was a really good plan, too.

1092
01:15:29,352 --> 01:15:31,812
我可以回到里面去  你们还可以继续
Well, I can go back inside, and you can still do it.

1093
01:15:31,812 --> 01:15:33,312
领情了
That's patronizing.

1094
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:35,562
不  不是
Yeah, no, it's not...

1095
01:15:37,442 --> 01:15:39,822
这个标枪是怎么回事
Uh, what's with the javelin?

1096
01:15:39,822 --> 01:15:41,282
我在等上帝告诉我
I'm waitin' for God to tell me.

1097
01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:42,622
耶稣基督

We find out any information you give us is false, you die.

1111
01:16:14,822 --> 01:16:17,652
如果我们发现你有个性化车牌
If we find out you have personalized license plates,

No.

1116
01:16:22,362 --> 01:16:23,992
如果你咳嗽不捂嘴
If you cough without covering your mouth...

1117
01:16:23,992 --> 01:16:26,482
哈莉  最后这三项不算数
Harley. Those last three aren't things.

1118
01:16:26,702 --> 01:16:28,452
虽然  可能不需要说
Although, probably don't need to say this,

1119
01:16:28,452 --> 01:16:29,792
但是这并不意味着
but that isn't an open invitation

1120
01:16:29,792 --> 01:16:31,372
你就可以咳嗽不捂嘴
for you to cough without covering your mouth.

1121
01:16:31,372 --> 01:16:33,292
好  我们需要你来开面包车
All right, we're gonna need you to drive the minibus,

1122
01:16:33,292 --> 01:16:35,992
带着我们所有人  通过前门的守卫
with all of us inside, past the guards at the front gate.

1123
01:16:36,002 --> 01:16:38,632
一通过大门  我们就要用你通过视网膜扫描
Once through the gate, we'll use you to get through the retinal scanner.

1124
01:16:38,632 --> 01:16:40,962
到处都有监控摄像头
There are security cameras everywhere.

1125
01:16:41,052 --> 01:16:42,632
都会处理好的
They're being dealt with.

1126
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:55,862
我们会除掉那里的士兵  然后进入
We'll neutralize the soldiers there and enter.

1127
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:58,442
我们一进去就分成小队
Once we're inside, we separate into teams.

1128
01:16:58,442 --> 01:17:00,522
我在走来走去
I am walking back and forth.

1129
01:17:00,822 --> 01:17:04,282
好  你要带我和捕鼠者二代去"海星计划"
Okay. You're gonna lead me and Ratcatcher 2 to Project Starfish.

1130
01:17:04,282 --> 01:17:05,912
我和你一起  因为我不信任这个人
I'm going with you 'cause I don't trust this guy.

1131
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:07,532
不不不  你和我一起
No, no, no, you're coming with me.

1132
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:10,202
我们需要对军火非常专业的人来放炸药
Our munitions expertise are needed to place the explosives

1133
01:17:10,202 --> 01:17:13,072
从一层开始  一路布置到楼上
starting at the first floor, going all the way to the top.

1134
01:17:13,372 --> 01:17:15,872
一旦任务完成  我们就把它炸了
Once we're clear, we blow the tits off that thing,

1135
01:17:16,252 --> 01:17:17,162
然后回家
and go home.

1136
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:19,962
这是自杀行为
This is suicide.

1137
01:17:19,962 --> 01:17:21,462
这算是我们的特长了
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1138
01:17:22,592 --> 01:17:23,422
没错
Yeah.

1139
01:17:30,352 --> 01:17:31,842
真是疯了
This is insane.

1140
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,262
你不能拿
Yeah, no.

1141
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:23,812
我好喜欢下雨
I love the rain.

1142
01:18:24,192 --> 01:18:26,992
就好像天使们射了我们一身似的
It's like angels are splooging all over us.

1143
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:28,152
这是个很好的掩护
It's good for cover.

1144
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:29,982
你说得也没错
Yep, that too.

1145
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:47,062
你他妈的
Son of a bit...

1146
01:20:07,382 --> 01:20:10,002
输入紧急代码  快点
Input the emergency code. Now!

1147
01:20:10,432 --> 01:20:11,462
快点啊
Well, go on then!

1148
01:20:14,512 --> 01:20:15,802
快点  快点

1149
01:20:27,062 --> 01:20:28,692
他们砸坏了  不能用了

1150
01:20:30,652 --> 01:20:32,072
把冲车开过来

1151
01:20:39,082 --> 01:20:39,992
好了  小波点
Okay, Pokey.

1152
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:42,992
你拿一个炸弹  你也拿一个
You get a bomb, you get a bomb.

1153
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:44,962
我和哈莉会在二层和你汇合
Harley and I will meet you up on the second floor.

1154
01:20:44,962 --> 01:20:46,662
明白吗  好的
Yeah? All right.

1155
01:20:53,092 --> 01:20:54,552
注意  注意

1156
01:20:54,672 --> 01:20:56,882
所有楼内安全人员注意

1157
01:20:57,342 --> 01:20:59,222
现在有九名入侵者

1158
01:20:59,222 --> 01:21:01,472
包括盖乌斯·格里夫斯博士

1159
01:21:01,642 --> 01:21:04,222
找到他们  一律射杀

1160
01:21:04,732 --> 01:21:06,392
行动  行动

1161
01:21:07,812 --> 01:21:09,232
把悍马开过来

1162
01:21:10,062 --> 01:21:11,112
开过来

1163
01:21:11,362 --> 01:21:12,402
快点

1164
01:21:15,942 --> 01:21:17,862
再来  倒车  快点

1165
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:19,032
快点  快点

1166
01:21:20,122 --> 01:21:21,332
再撞一次  先生

1167
01:21:21,332 --> 01:21:22,162
快

1168
01:21:29,632 --> 01:21:31,122
该死的  纳纳塞
God damn it, Nanaue.

1169
01:21:32,342 --> 01:21:33,122
不行
No!

1170
01:21:34,132 --> 01:21:35,502
别玩了
Quit bein' a play baby.

1171
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:37,752
和平使者
Peacemaker.

1172
01:21:38,972 --> 01:21:40,382
其实你捏得很棒
It's actually very nice.

1173
01:21:40,772 --> 01:21:42,222
快粘到墙上去吧
Just put it against the wall.

1174
01:21:44,102 --> 01:21:45,432
看起来一点也不像我
It looks nothin' like me.

1175
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,012
快点  快走
Move. Move it.

1176
01:21:50,112 --> 01:21:51,022
这边走
This way.

1177
01:22:06,912 --> 01:22:11,082
苏亚雷斯总统  约顿海姆安全主管的电话

1178
01:22:11,922 --> 01:22:12,712
是我
Si.

1179
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,962
快走  出发
Vamonos. Vamonos!

1180
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:45,242
肮脏的小秘密

1181
01:23:03,972 --> 01:23:05,012
我的上帝
Good God.

1182
01:23:05,392 --> 01:23:06,722
如果上帝真的存在
If God existed,

1183
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:09,892
这不正是他一点也不仁慈的证明吗
wouldn't this be proof that he wasn't good at all?

1184
01:23:10,772 --> 01:23:12,392
这到底是什么东西
What the hell is this?

1185
01:23:12,652 --> 01:23:15,232
你们不是要找"海星计划"吗
I thought you were looking for Project Starfish.

1186
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,312
格里夫斯  你带人来看我们了吗
You've brought us visitors, have you, Grieves?

1187
01:23:19,322 --> 01:23:21,952
你是来救我逃离那个疯子的吗
Have you come to save me from that madman?

1188
01:23:21,952 --> 01:23:24,032
他把我关在这里三十年
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1189
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:25,612
折磨我
Tortured me.

1190
01:23:25,912 --> 01:23:28,412
随心所欲地折磨我
Had his way with me.

1191
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:10,742
我管它叫"征服者斯塔罗"
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

1192
01:24:11,172 --> 01:24:12,872
这个名字是反讽
That's meant to be derisive.

1193
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:15,042
抱歉  老朋友
Sorry, old chum.

1194
01:24:15,172 --> 01:24:16,592
这两位是来杀你的
These two are here to kill you.

1195
01:24:16,592 --> 01:24:17,962
我实在无能为力
It's out of my hands.

1196
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,082
我们得帮助这些人
We need to help these people.

1197
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:21,382
亲爱的  不可能
Impossible, dear.

1198
01:24:21,552 --> 01:24:23,712
海星下的他们都是尸体了
They're corpses below those stars.

1199
01:24:24,262 --> 01:24:25,212
他们是谁
Who are they?

1200
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,552
各个时期权贵者手下的炮灰而已
The fodder of powerful men through every age.

1201
01:24:29,812 --> 01:24:30,972
异议分子
Dissidents,

1202
01:24:31,732 --> 01:24:33,102
记者
journalists,

1203
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,432
政敌
political rivals,

1204
01:24:35,692 --> 01:24:38,272
还有他们的爱人
and their loved ones.

1205
01:24:40,152 --> 01:24:41,782
别这样
Oh, please,

1206
01:24:41,782 --> 01:24:45,152
别一副如临大敌的样子  弗莱格
unclutch your fucking pearls, Flag.

1207
01:24:45,412 --> 01:24:48,082
我们听命于同一个主人
We serve the same master.

1208
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:49,742
我们是被派来阻止你的
We were sent here to stop you.

1209
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:51,492
孩子
Child,

1210
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,782
你的政府派你来这里
your government didn't send you here

1211
01:24:53,882 --> 01:24:56,792
不是来保护世界不受外星科技侵害
to protect the world from alien technology.

1212
01:24:56,842 --> 01:25:00,762
你的政府派你们来  是为了掩盖他们的罪行
Your government sent you here to cover up their part in it.

1213
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,832
你是个该死的骗子
You're a goddamn liar.

1214
01:25:03,382 --> 01:25:07,222
是该死的美国宇航员找到的斯塔罗
American goddamn astronauts found Starro.

1215
01:25:07,222 --> 01:25:10,142
一群花花公子美国傻佬
Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.

1216
01:25:10,142 --> 01:25:11,682
虽然那时冷战已经结束
Although the Cold War was ended,

1217
01:25:11,682 --> 01:25:13,522
你们的政府看到了
your government saw the potential

1218
01:25:13,522 --> 01:25:16,402
将如此强大的怪物武器化的潜力
in weaponizing such a powerful beast,

1219
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:18,072
但是又不想
but banish the thought of

1220
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:21,312
在美国的土地上进行这些实验
any such experiments being held on American soil.

1221
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:24,492
你们的人民一直对科学进步
Your people have always been squeamish

1222
01:25:24,492 --> 01:25:26,942
所必要的牺牲
about the sacrifices necessary

1223
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,492
过于束手束脚
for scientific advancement.

1224
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:30,492
所以
So,

1225
01:25:31,662 --> 01:25:33,412
美国和柯多马堤斯政府
the United States made a secret deal

1226
01:25:33,412 --> 01:25:35,212
达成了一项秘密协议
with the Corto Maltese government

1227
01:25:35,212 --> 01:25:37,632
在这里进行他们的非法实验
to conduct their illegal experiments here

1228
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:38,832
就在约顿海姆
in Jotunheim.

1229
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,332
他们还聘请了我来进行监督
And they hired me to oversee them.

1230
01:25:41,342 --> 01:25:43,052
结果现在  仅仅因为
And now, because of

1231
01:25:43,052 --> 01:25:45,432
一场小打小闹的军事政变
a run-of-the-mill fucking military coup,

1232
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,842
他们就要毁掉30年的辛苦成果
they're gonna destroy 30 years' worth of efforts.

1233
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:48,752
是啊
Yeah!

1234
01:25:49,392 --> 01:25:50,842
你才是真正的受害者
You're the real victim here.

1235
01:25:51,182 --> 01:25:51,852
你来这里干什么
The hell you doing here?

1236
01:25:51,852 --> 01:25:53,882
你应该在楼上布置炸药的
You're supposed to be upstairs planting explosives.

1237
01:25:54,022 --> 01:25:55,342
我说过我不信任他
I told you I didn't trust him.

1238
01:25:56,602 --> 01:25:58,602
你的记录都存在那些电脑里吗
Your records are located in those computers?

1239
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,442
上校  你要干什么
Colonel, what are you doing?

1240
01:26:04,402 --> 01:26:07,072
我参军是为了报效祖国
I joined the military to serve my country,

1241
01:26:07,072 --> 01:26:08,652
不是成为一个傀儡
not to be its puppet.

1242
01:26:09,782 --> 01:26:11,152
你要干什么
What are you doing?

1243
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,162
你要把那些记录给谁看
Who are you going to show that to?

1244
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:19,202
媒体  人们有权知道发生了什么事
The press. Goddamn people deserve to know.

1245
01:26:19,422 --> 01:26:21,252
我受够了帮他们掩盖肮脏的小秘密
I'm tired of coverin' up their dirty little secrets.

1246
01:26:21,252 --> 01:26:23,292
这次这群狗娘养的该完蛋了
This time these sons of bitches are gonna be held account...

1247
01:26:24,342 --> 01:26:25,722
上校  我不能让你这样做
I can't let you do that, Colonel.

1248
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,722
-你说什么  -我很抱歉
- Excuse me? - I'm truly sorry.

1249
01:26:27,722 --> 01:26:29,012
沃勒女士让我负责确保
Miss Waller charged me with makin' sure

1250
01:26:29,012 --> 01:26:30,432
那些记录不能被带出去
those records don't leave this building.

1251
01:26:30,432 --> 01:26:31,802
果然  我早该猜到的
Of course, I shoulda known.

1252
01:26:32,352 --> 01:26:34,852
沃勒永远都有备用计划
Waller's always got a backup.

1253
01:26:34,852 --> 01:26:36,892
拜托了伙计  我不是针对你
Come on, man, this isn't personal.

1254
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:39,512
举枪对着我就是在针对我
Holdin' a gun on me is pretty fucking personal.

1255
01:26:40,572 --> 01:26:41,522
那是怎么回事
What is that?

1256
01:26:42,442 --> 01:26:44,022
上校  把那个硬盘给我
I'm gonna need that drive, Colonel.

1257
01:26:45,532 --> 01:26:47,732
那群蠢蛋把炸药炸早了
Those morons set off the explosives too early.

1258
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:49,032
给我硬盘
Hand over the drive!

1259
01:26:49,032 --> 01:26:50,322
快走  快点
Let's go, come on!

1260
01:26:51,622 --> 01:26:53,282
他们在孩子身上做实验
They experimented on children.

1261
01:26:53,372 --> 01:26:55,332
没人说他们做得对
No one is sayin' what they did was right.

1262
01:26:55,332 --> 01:26:57,412
他们在小孩子身上做实验
They experimented on children!

1263
01:26:57,502 --> 01:26:58,372
那些信息一旦泄露
That information gets out,

1264
01:26:58,372 --> 01:27:00,202
将会引起国际化事件
it causes an international incident!

1265
01:27:00,462 --> 01:27:02,752
为了维护和平  可以付出一切代价
Keepin' the peace is worth any price,

1266
01:27:02,962 --> 01:27:04,882
包括牺牲掉像您这样的英雄的生命  长官
including the life of a hero like yours, sir,

1267
01:27:04,882 --> 01:27:06,042
所以拜托了
so please...

1268
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,132
别逼我这样做
don't make me do this.

1269
01:27:48,422 --> 01:27:50,042
你们都做了什么
What have you people done?

1270
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:07,482
塞巴斯蒂安  快来
Sebastian, come!

1271
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:43,472
好  我们得冷静
Okay, we gotta calm down.

1272
01:28:43,482 --> 01:28:45,902
我们  我们谈一谈
Let's all just... Let's talk about this.

1273
01:28:45,902 --> 01:28:47,612
我知道在你的目的
I understand where you're coming from.

1274
01:28:47,612 --> 01:28:48,862
我越界了
I crossed a line.

1275
01:28:48,862 --> 01:28:50,532
好吗  我越界了
Okay, I crossed a line!

1276
01:28:50,532 --> 01:28:52,652
我意识到了  但我准备好改变了
I realize that, but I'm ready to change.

1277
01:28:52,662 --> 01:28:54,702
我准备好改变了
I am ready to change.

1278
01:28:54,702 --> 01:28:56,982
我不是有意伤害你的
And I didn't mean to hurt you...

1279
01:30:46,852 --> 01:30:49,012
混蛋
You motherfucker.

1280
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:29,682
和平使者
Peacemaker.

1281
01:31:31,272 --> 01:31:32,682
真是个笑话
What a joke.

1282
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:07,052
克利奥
Cleo.

1283
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,052
把硬盘给我
Give me back the drive.

1284
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:34,412
我跟你说了那些信息不能传出去  操
I told you that information can't get out. Fuck!

1285
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:37,212
好  好  毁掉硬盘
So, okay, okay, destroy the hard drive.

1286
01:32:37,212 --> 01:32:38,622
为什么要杀我
Why kill me?

1287
01:32:45,722 --> 01:32:47,092
因为我做事彻底
Because I'm thorough.

1288
01:32:50,352 --> 01:32:51,392
老天
Oh, my...

1289
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:52,552
抱歉  孩子
Sorry, kid.

1290
01:32:53,062 --> 01:32:54,562
不  不
No, no...

1291
01:32:54,562 --> 01:32:54,602
八分钟之前
No, no...

1292
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:57,522
八分钟之前

1293
01:33:04,382 --> 01:33:05,702
好了  部队来了
All right, troops are coming.

1294
01:33:05,702 --> 01:33:07,922
这一层好了  然后还有九层  走了
This floor, and then nine floors left. Let's go!

1295
01:33:07,922 --> 01:33:08,752
快
Come on!

1296
01:34:30,602 --> 01:34:32,572
新笨朋友
New dumb friends.

1297
01:34:45,432 --> 01:34:46,882
该死  等一下
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1298
01:35:14,562 --> 01:35:16,552
有人知道是什么情况吗
Has anyone got eyes or ears on any more?

1299
01:35:16,552 --> 01:35:18,012
他们杀了米尔顿
They killed Milton!

1300
01:35:20,212 --> 01:35:21,882
米尔顿还跟着我们吗
Milton was still with us?

1301
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,832
-你以为他在哪  -我不知道
- Where'd you think he was? - I don't know.

1302
01:35:23,842 --> 01:35:25,502
我以为他留在车里了
I thought he stayed back with the bus.

1303
01:35:25,612 --> 01:35:26,702
米尔顿来干什么
What was Milton gonna do?

1304
01:35:26,702 --> 01:35:27,992
他一直在帮我们
He was helping us!

1305
01:35:29,732 --> 01:35:30,962
-谁是米尔顿  -什么
- Who's Milton? - What?

1306
01:35:30,962 --> 01:35:32,962
我不记得有个米尔顿
I don't remember any Milton.

1307
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:36,372
操  他一直跟我们在一起
Fuck! He has been with us the whole time.

1308
01:35:36,422 --> 01:35:39,342
有个叫米尔顿的人一直跟我们在一起
Somebody named Milton has been with us

1309
01:35:39,592 --> 01:35:40,452
对
Yes!

1310
01:35:40,512 --> 01:35:42,422
没有吧  我想我会注意到
I don't think so. I think I would've noticed

1311
01:35:42,422 --> 01:35:44,242
有个叫米尔顿的人和我们一起
if a guy named Milton's been with us.

1312
01:35:44,242 --> 01:35:46,722
这个名字不是很常见
It's not a very common name.

1313
01:35:46,722 --> 01:35:48,922
我不觉得我见过米尔顿
I don't think I've ever even met Milton.

1314
01:35:49,672 --> 01:35:51,532
你在开玩笑吗
Are you messing around right now?

1315
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:52,872
他是个很好的人
He was a really nice guy,

1316
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:55,242
他牺牲了自己来帮助我们
and he sacrificed himself to help us.

1317
01:35:55,852 --> 01:35:56,992
而现在你看看他
And now look at him.

1318
01:35:57,722 --> 01:35:58,722
他死了
He's dead.

1319
01:36:00,982 --> 01:36:04,712
那个人啊  米尔顿  米尔顿
Oh, that guy! Milton, Milton.

1320
01:36:09,242 --> 01:36:11,732
所以你和米尔顿的世纪之恋是何时开始的
So, when did this great love affair with Milton start?

1321
01:36:11,732 --> 01:36:13,282
我从一开始就喜欢他了  好吗
I liked him from the beginning, okay?

1322
01:36:13,282 --> 01:36:15,022
我只是在这之前什么都没说
I just didn't say anything until...

1323
01:36:17,422 --> 01:36:18,482
不
No!

1324
01:38:13,622 --> 01:38:16,282
哈莉  拉我一把
Harley! Give a hand!

1325
01:38:17,052 --> 01:38:20,262
开火  开火

1326
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:38,842
快  快
Vamos. Vamos.

1327
01:39:04,302 --> 01:39:05,972
带我们离开  快

1328
01:40:13,642 --> 01:40:15,762
操  操
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1329
01:40:18,462 --> 01:40:20,342
滚
Oh, fuck off!

1330
01:40:42,162 --> 01:40:43,192
抱歉  孩子
Sorry, kid.

1331
01:40:43,752 --> 01:40:45,492
不不不
No, no, no.

1332
01:41:41,752 --> 01:41:42,922
更小的子弹
Smaller bullets.

1333
01:41:48,462 --> 01:41:50,532
他杀了弗莱格上校
He killed Colonel Flag.

1334
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:54,332
他想把这个分享给媒体
He wanted to share this with the press.

1335
01:41:54,332 --> 01:41:56,032
这是"海星计划"
It's proof the American government

1336
01:41:56,042 --> 01:41:59,012
背后一直是美国政府的证据
was behind Project Starfish the whole time.

1337
01:42:50,262 --> 01:42:52,042
我想它是想出来
I think it's trying to get out.

1338
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:53,892
-什么  -斯塔罗
- What? - Starro the...

1339
01:43:24,812 --> 01:43:27,532
自杀小队VS征服者斯塔罗

1340
01:43:29,192 --> 01:43:30,952
这是什么鬼玩意

1341
01:43:34,952 --> 01:43:36,992
开火  开火

1342
01:44:26,992 --> 01:44:29,102
护住脸
Cover your faces!

1343
01:45:17,012 --> 01:45:19,512
好
Si.

1344
01:45:22,312 --> 01:45:23,812
苏亚雷斯死了

1345
01:45:24,232 --> 01:45:26,312
那就是说我是总统了

1346
01:45:31,322 --> 01:45:32,362
将军们

1347
01:45:32,902 --> 01:45:35,952
我们柯多马堤斯人民

1348
01:45:36,402 --> 01:45:38,112
接管政府了

1349
01:45:38,322 --> 01:45:40,282
退位

1350
01:45:53,172 --> 01:45:54,282
那他妈是什么
What the fuck is that?

1351
01:45:55,362 --> 01:45:56,292
伙计们
Hey, guys?

1352
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,432
该死  有
Oh, shit, there's...

1353
01:46:19,442 --> 01:46:21,802
这座城市是我的
This city is mine.

1354
01:46:52,192 --> 01:46:54,492
沃勒女士  信号恢复了
Miss Waller, I think the feed is back up.

1355
01:46:57,362 --> 01:46:58,842
我的天  沃勒女士
Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

1356
01:46:59,382 --> 01:47:02,062
有怪兽
We've got a freaking kaiju up in this shit!

1357
01:47:11,502 --> 01:47:12,712
X特遣队  回话
Task Force X, come in.

1358
01:47:12,712 --> 01:47:13,702
你们在吗
Are you there?

1359
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:21,202
屏蔽我们通信的信号干扰器
Whatever signal jammers were blocking our communications

1360
01:47:21,202 --> 01:47:23,082
肯定是在你们刚毁掉的那栋建筑里
must have been in the building you just demolished.

1361
01:47:23,082 --> 01:47:26,312
嗯  我们这边出了点小问题  沃勒
Yeah, well, we've got a mite issue over here, Waller.

1362
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:28,552
是"海星计划"  沃勒女士
It's Project Starfish, Miss Waller.

1363
01:47:28,732 --> 01:47:29,782
它在朝市中心行进
It's headed towards the city,

1364
01:47:29,782 --> 01:47:32,832
我想它想尽可能的捕食人类
and I think it wants to feed on as many people as it can.

1365
01:47:37,352 --> 01:47:38,482
和我们无关
Not our problem.

1366
01:47:38,482 --> 01:47:40,772
如果你们已经毁掉了约顿海姆和里面的记录
If you've destroyed Jotunheim and the records within,

1367
01:47:40,772 --> 01:47:42,462
目标就完成了
you've achieved the objective.

1368
01:47:42,472 --> 01:47:45,142
柯多马堤斯不再是美国的盟友
Corto Maltese is no longer a U.S. ally.

1369
01:47:45,332 --> 01:47:47,012
如果非要说的话  白宫会认为
If anything, the White House will consider

1370
01:47:47,012 --> 01:47:50,292
在敌国挑起动乱是个好进展
fomenting disruption in a hostile nation a positive development.

1371
01:48:23,792 --> 01:48:24,972
你听到她的话了
You heard what she said.

1372
01:48:46,312 --> 01:48:47,332
操
Fuck.

1373
01:48:53,192 --> 01:48:54,972
血腥运动脱离任务
Bloodsport is off mission.

1374
01:48:55,022 --> 01:48:55,972
搞什么
What the...

1375
01:48:57,062 --> 01:48:58,422
她会杀了你的
She'll kill you, you know.

1376
01:48:58,982 --> 01:49:00,162
那是她的事
That's her business.

1377
01:49:00,912 --> 01:49:03,802
我就知道塞巴斯蒂安感觉到你的好是有道理的
I knew Sebastian sensed good in you for a reason.

1378
01:49:04,102 --> 01:49:06,082
让那老鼠离我远点
Just keep that fucking rat away from me.

1379
01:49:06,682 --> 01:49:08,632
捕鼠者也脱离了任务
Ratcatcher is also off mission.

1380
01:49:08,742 --> 01:49:10,812
血腥运动  捕鼠者  回来
Bloodsport, Ratcatcher, turn around.

1381
01:49:10,812 --> 01:49:12,462
去哪  朋友们
Where go, friends?

1382
01:49:13,322 --> 01:49:14,292
纳纳塞
Nanaue!

1383
01:49:16,182 --> 01:49:18,512
我知道我拿这标枪要干什么了
I know what I'm carrying the javelin for.

1384
01:49:28,882 --> 01:49:30,302
柯瑞尔  回来
Krill, turn around now!

1385
01:49:30,572 --> 01:49:32,322
快回来  该死
Turn back now, God damn it!

1386
01:49:35,452 --> 01:49:36,592
-打开  -沃勒女士
- Open it. - Miss Waller...

1387
01:49:36,592 --> 01:49:37,632
打开
Open it!

1388
01:49:39,162 --> 01:49:40,962
你们在干什么  X特遣队
What are you doing, Task Force X?

1389
01:49:46,772 --> 01:49:47,722
操
Fuck!

1390
01:49:50,362 --> 01:49:52,102
快回来  该死
Turn around now, God damn it!

1391
01:49:52,102 --> 01:49:54,012
你们这群蠢货
You dumb pieces of shit!

1392
01:49:54,832 --> 01:49:56,242
一群混蛋
Motherfuckers!

1393
01:49:57,472 --> 01:50:00,222
X特遣队  这他妈是
God damn it, Task Force X, this is your last

1394
01:50:00,222 --> 01:50:01,832
最后一次警告
motherfucking warning!

1395
01:50:06,632 --> 01:50:09,522
我的天  你他妈干了什么
Oh, my God! What the fuck did you do?

1396
01:50:11,532 --> 01:50:12,952
看看这些人  约翰
All those people, John.

1397
01:50:13,872 --> 01:50:15,012
这些孩子

沃勒知道我们背叛了她
Waller knows we double-crossed her,

1533
02:11:12,812 --> 02:11:13,792
她为了报复
and she's getting back at us

1534
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:16,262
把这个混蛋推给我们
by saddling us with this douchebag.

1535
02:11:16,262 --> 02:11:17,142
嗯
Yep.

1536
02:11:17,542 --> 02:11:20,062
我听说他在柯多马堤斯是个英雄
I heard he was sort of a hero down in Corto Maltese.

1537
02:11:20,062 --> 02:11:22,422
你听说的是这样吗  可根本不是这样
Oh, is that what you heard? Because not quite.

1538
02:11:24,332 --> 02:11:25,602
你们要他做什么
What do you guys want him for?

1539
02:11:26,942 --> 02:11:29,692
拯救一下这个操蛋的世界  仅此而已
Just to save the fucking world, that's all.
