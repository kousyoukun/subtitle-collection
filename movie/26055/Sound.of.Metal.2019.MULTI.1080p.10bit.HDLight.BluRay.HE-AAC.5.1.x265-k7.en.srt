No matter
how loud I made the test,

165
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,186
I could have put it at 1 1...

166
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,855
you were still going to miss

167
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,567
70 to 80 percent
of the words that I said.

168
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,735
- Okay.
- That is not good.

169
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah, I see that, so, what--?

170
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,324
What can we do about it?
How do I get it back?

171
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:18,102
Well, um, you have
to understand something here.

172
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:23,917
Whether or not this is related
to your exposure to noise

173
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,087
or it's an autoimmune issue...

174
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,714
doesn't really matter.

175
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,466
I understand I got a problem.

176
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,593
I'm asking you
what I can do about it.

177
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,220
Well, what you can do
about it first

178
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,332
is to eliminate all exposure
to loud noises.

179
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,768
And then, we can run some tests,

180
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:46,047
and we can determine exactly
what is going on with your ears.

181
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,776
And if we do, then we can
have our other conversations.

182
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,260
You could have what?

183
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,264
Well, there are implants
that bypass the cochlea.

184
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,910
You said implants?

185
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,369
- Yes.
- Those work?

186
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,872
For people with
severe hearing loss

187
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,208
or complete deafness,
yes, they help.

188
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,627
Well, then let's do that.

189
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,046
Well, it's not that simple.

190
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,923
Uh, it's a very
involved process,

191
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,424
and it's quite costly.

192
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,676
- How much is it?
- Well, they can run

193
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,888
between 40 and 80,000 dollars,
depending,

194
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,956
and they are not
covered by insurance.

195
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,356
Okay.

196
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,714
And, um...

197
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,777
like, when can you do it?

198
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,278
You got them in stock now?

199
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,156
Mr. Stone, your hearing...

200
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,909
is deteriorating rapidly.

201
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,268
Am I right?

202
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,063
And over the next few days...

203
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,960
or even hours,
it's going to continue.

204
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,879
And the hearing
that you have lost

205
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,298
is not coming back.

206
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,635
<i>You have to understand,</i>

207
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,137
<i>your first responsibility...</i>

208
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,789
<i>is to preserve
the hearing you have.</i>

209
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,303
Ruben, what the fuck?

210
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,578
Ruben!

211
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,381
I can't hear anything.

212
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,549
What?

213
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,845
I can't hear anything.

214
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,652
Yes, it will come back.

215
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,904
I have to--

216
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,907
There's, like, a surgery.

217
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,970
- What?
- It's simple. It's all it is.

218
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,139
There's an implant.
They put it in your shit.

219
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,373
It's like a--

220
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,186
Okay? It'll come back.
It's fine, Lou.

221
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,921
It's like 40 grand, 80 grand,
whatever, but it's--

222
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,024
It will come back.

223
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,360
- Till then, we just keep going.
- No.

224
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,278
- Lou. Listen to me.
- No.

225
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,906
Let's play tomorrow, see
what it's like. Let's try it.

226
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,450
I'm gonna be like a click track.
You can play to me.

227
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,785
- No.
- Huh? You can adj--

228
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,853
It's different,
but it is what it is, Lou.

229
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,088
Lou, we have a--
Lou, we have a tour booked.

230
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,072
- It's not safe.
- We have a tour booked.

231
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,759
- We have a tour booked, Lou.
- No.

232
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,594
It doesn't matter.
It's not safe!

233
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,662
- We have a tour booked!
- It's not safe!

234
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,891
- Ruben!
- I fucking knew it.

235
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,041
I'm going back.

236
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,942
Yo!

237
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,801
Buddy, you got a smoke, please?

238
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,666
This is ridiculous.

239
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,651
He's sleeping.

240
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,695
Hi. Hi, Hector?

241
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,616
Hi, this is Lou. Ruben's having
a bit of trouble right now.

242
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,267
- Hey, Hector, what's up?
- He's had some hearing problems.

243
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,789
Yeah, I mean,
I can put him on,

244
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,439
but he won't
be able to hear you.

245
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,399
Okay.

246
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,819
Talk to him. Talk to him.

247
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,241
Hey, Hector,
what's going on, man?

248
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,720
It's Ruben. I'd say it's good
to hear your voice,

249
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,680
but I can't hear a word
you're saying,

250
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,432
so this is completely pointless.

251
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,101
Lou wanted me to call you
because I had a cigarette.

252
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,979
Uh, you know,
not great, not ideal,

253
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,357
but considering
the circumstances,

254
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,882
which are pretty fucked up...

255
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,237
you know, understandable.
I'd say understandable.

256
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,405
For everyone
apart from Lou, it seems.

257
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,533
Um, I got this, bro.

258
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,952
You'd probably be asking
me if I'm steady right now,

259
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,703
if I'm feeling level.

260
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,665
Not completely, but I'm cool.

261
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,167
You'd tell me serenity
is something you get

262
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,879
when you, uh, stop wishing
for a different past.

263
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,297
Bro, I love you, man.

264
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,550
Oh, my manager wants
the phone back,

265
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,034
so I gotta go.
Okay, love you, bro.

266
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,289
Hey. Yeah, he--
He can't hear a word.

267
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,461
Well, if you get him to a group,
then how's he gonna hear?

268
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,966
Okay.

269
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,387
Okay, thanks, Hector. Thank you.

270
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,032
When? When--?

271
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,909
Okay, yeah,
I'll make sure it's on loud.

272
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,311
Okay, thank you so much.
Thank you.

273
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,855
Okay, bye.

274
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,822
He's gonna call back.

275
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,618
What did he say?
Write it down. What did--?

276
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,792
He'll call back.

277
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,173
He's gonna call back.
That's all? Fucking Hector.

278
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,385
What are we gonna do now?

279
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,854
What do you wanna do, Lou?

280
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,023
Huh?

281
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,270
Fuck this.

282
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,804
It's Hector.

283
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,059
Hey.

284
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,436
Yeah, he's here.

285
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,399
Not so good.

286
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,279
Oh, o-- Okay.

287
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,866
Uh, yeah, what is it, and...?

288
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:57,162
- What? What's the plan?
- Uh...

289
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,060
Well, we're in Missouri,
so that's gonna take a few days.

290
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,585
I don't really know.

291
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,673
No, no, no,
we'll leave right away.

292
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,259
Okay, yeah.

293
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,530
Okay, thank you so much.
I really, really appreciate it.

294
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,763
Thank you.

295
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,724
No, yeah, I'll tell him.

296
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,892
Okay, bye.

297
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,399
What?

298
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,321
He's found a place.

299
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,610
Is that him?

300
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,289
Ruben.

301
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,084
I'm sorry. I don't know that--
I'm Ruben.

302
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,312
This is Lou.

303
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,772
Hi, I'm-- I'm Lou.

304
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,065
I'm sorry, I read lips.

305
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,483
- My name is Lou.
- Lou.

306
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,092
- I'm Joe.
- Hi, Joe.

307
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,571
Mind if I borrow him
for a minute?

308
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,697
No.

309
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,949
You mind watching
my beast here for me

310
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,326
- while we have a talk?
- Oh, okay.

311
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,662
Lou, this is Luis.

312
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,189
He's my hearing dog.
He let me know you were here.

313
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,651
I named him after Luis Aparicio
from the White Sox in '59.

314
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,255
You wanna be friends,
give him these.

315
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,989
- Oh, sure. Yeah.
- Okay?

316
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,013
Yo, what about--?
Lou, you coming?

317
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,055
No, no, no, you.

318
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,289
- You sure?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,416
- I won't belong, okay?
- Okay.

320
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,669
You be a good boy.

321
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,671
Okay, uh...

322
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,214
Test.

323
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,716
Oh.

324
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,526
Okay. So, it works.

325
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,529
Is this okay for you?

326
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,091
Yeah, can you hear me?

327
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,051
No, I'm gonna read your lips.

328
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,720
I might miss some things,
but I'm gonna try, okay?

329
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,764
- Okay.
- Try to speak clearly.

330
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,789
Yeah.

331
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,544
How are you, Ruben?

332
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,632
I'm okay.

333
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,139
You're an addict?

334
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,850
Yep.

335
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,062
What sort of drugs?

336
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,357
What did I take?

337
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,192
Mm-hmm.

338
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,655
Everything.

339
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,949
Um...

340
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,077
mainly heroin.

341
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,204
Heroin.

342
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,043
Have you thought about using
since you lost your hearing?

343
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,434
Today is not a good day.

344
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,903
I'm not thinking clear today.

345
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,616
Let's talk about me.

346
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,327
I'm an alcoholic.

347
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,473
I lost my hearing
in the Vietnam War

348
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,248
when a bomb
exploded near me.

349
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,728
I still remember the music
I was listening to

350
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,003
when that bomb went off.

351
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,714
After that...

352
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,050
I lost everything else.

353
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,969
My wife. My kid.

354
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,157
Not because of being deaf,
mind you, Ruben.

355
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,391
It was the beer.

356
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,020
How long you been clean?

357
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,958
- Four years.
- Four?

358
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,192
Mmm.

359
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,112
And you need
some help right now?

360
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,115
You know,
I should check on Lou.

361
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,285
How long you two been together?

362
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,996
Four years.

363
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,397
You play music, right?

364
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,208
-No?

365
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,459
No, not anymore.

366
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,294
Not until I get the implant.

367
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,528
Implant.

368
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,549
Yeah, sorry, you know about
these implants they got now?

369
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,301
It's like a--
They have implants.

370
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,827
I know, yes.

371
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,014
Expensive.

372
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,832
Yeah, thank you.
Yes, they are.

373
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,042
So...

374
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,897
you should understand that, uh,

375
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,423
this is a deaf community.

376
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,802
Not just my program, but we're
part of a larger deaf community.

377
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,514
And my program,
and the people in it,

378
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,369
they benefit tremendously
from that deaf community.

379
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,480
We work with them,
and they work with us.

380
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,877
But it's very important,
if you wanna be here,

381
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,945
to understand that we're looking
for a solution to...

382
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,697
To this.

383
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,325
Not this.

384
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,164
Why don't you go
invite Lou in here?

385
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,336
Sure.

386
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,340
Lou!

387
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,390
This guy wants to talk to you.

388
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,100
Okay.

389
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,416
Well, I think it's important

390
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,668
that you stay here
with us right now, Ruben.

391
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,420
Learn some sign language...

392
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,154
find some solid ground.

393
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,657
What do you think?

394
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,803
Man, that sounds great, but we
don't have a lot of money now.

395
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,723
Well, sometimes our church
sponsors deaf people in need,

396
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,518
and right now,
you fit the bill, Ruben.

397
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,936
We're really not

398
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,521
- churchgoing people.
- Sorry, I read--

399
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,964
Sorry, Ruben, I read lips.
I can't-- What'd you say?

400
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,360
We're not religious,
either of us.

401
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,403
- Oh.
- Very much not into religion.

402
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,113
No offense, you know.

403
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,282
Religion plays no part in this,
Ruben.

404
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,702
The church helps people in need,
not religious people.

405
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,038
The important thing
is that you wanna stay here.

406
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,540
Mmm.

407
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,274
- Yeah.
- Lou...

408
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,985
do you think Ruben needs
help right now?

409
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,135
You understand if, uh,
Ruben were to stay here,

410
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,995
he'd have to do it on his own.

411
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,641
Members live in a house
separate from the outside world.

412
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,293
No contact to the outside world.
No phones.

413
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:50,398
I've found that in all cases,
that's the way it works best.

414
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,384
Yo, hold up a minute, okay?
Let me catch up. Okay?

415
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,262
Can you help
Ruben commit to that, Lou?

416
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,658
Wanna try this
for a couple days?

417
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,059
We have our own home.
We can stay in the RV.

418
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,163
I'm sorry to say, that's not
the way it works here.

419
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,814
Well, that's a problem, then.

420
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,067
Do you have anywhere you can be
during this time, Lou?

421
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,381
Yo, that's that, man.
We're done.

422
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,717
We're done. Thanks a lot
for your time, bro.

423
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,368
Appreciate it, okay?
We're out, baby. Let's go.

424
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,750
Hey.

425
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,086
Lou, ahem,
I'm thinking we should

426
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,672
still go hit our fucking show
in Dayton, okay?

427
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,175
I can fucking watch you
for cues.

428
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,927
It was rocky last time,
but we weren't on the same page.

429
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,971
Now you know what's up.
I can fucking watch you.

430
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,622
And I know this shit inside out.

431
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,434
Okay? Yo, I can
fucking make it work

432
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,251
until we have enough
for surgery.

433
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,671
Okay? We're gonna get there.

434
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,108
Yo, seriously, we're good to go.

435
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,010
Hmm?

436
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,638
Hey, I'll deal with this shit.

437
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,033
I'll deal with it.
You know I will.

438
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,893
It's just money.
You know that, right? Huh?

439
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,730
Come here.

440
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,248
Ruben!

441
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,001
Ruben!

442
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,337
Ruben! Stop it!

443
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,512
Ruben!

444
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,947
Look at me, I'm not going back
to that fucking place, okay?

445
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,011
I know, I know. I'm--

446
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,833
Well, then fucking support me!

447
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,045
How's about that?
Fucking support me, Lou! Huh?

448
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,194
- You don't wanna be here?
- Of course I do.

449
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,780
I knew it. I fucking knew it.
I knew this was coming.

450
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,557
I fucking knew it. This is
about the fucking album, huh?

451
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,244
What happened?
You get a better offer?

452
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,163
- What are you talking about?
- Huh?

453
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,790
I can't hear you. I can't
fucking hear you, understand?

454
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,793
I can't-- I'm fucking deaf!
I'm fucking deaf!

455
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,862
No fucking hearing! Okay? Okay?

456
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,970
No, what I need is
a fucking gun in my mouth.

457
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,206
What I need is a fucking gun
in my fucking mouth, okay?

458
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,522
Look, I'm sorry.

459
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,691
Lou, I'm just fucked up, Lou.
I just need a little--

460
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,675
I need a minute to think, okay?

461
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,223
There's gotta be
another way. Lou?

462
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,870
Hello?

463
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,103
Hey.

464
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,899
Oh, really?

465
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,444
- Oh.
- Who is that?

466
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,240
Okay, well, I need to get ready.
Okay, no, I'll get a cab.

467
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,951
Yeah, it's fine.

468
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,161
Okay, bye.

469
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,664
What's going on?

470
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,644
Huh? What's going on?

471
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,462
I'm getting on a plane. You're
gonna go back to that place.

472
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,613
Slow down, okay? Slow down.

473
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,658
Yo, chill, dude, we're gonna be
a minute. Just chill, okay?

474
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,684
Ahem, just slow down a minute.

475
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,580
Lou. Lou.
This is so fucked up.

476
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,333
Who's gonna be looking out
for you over there? Hmm?

477
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,752
- Who's gonna look out for you?
- It's okay.

478
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,671
I need more of a plan, Lou.

479
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,713
- Ruben.
- I need--

480
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,489
I need more from you, Lou!

481
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,541
I need more of a plan, Lou.

482
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,793
You can't just fucking--

483
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,448
Aw, Jesus! Lou, come on.

484
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,974
Ruben, Ruben.

485
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,412
You hurt yourself?

486
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,187
Ruben, you hurt yourself...

487
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,023
you hurt me.

488
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,834
I'll hurt myself too.

489
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,860
- I'll hurt myself too.
- Don't say that.

490
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,945
Promise.

491
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,884
Say it, Ruby, or all of this
is for shit! Say it! Promise!

492
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,219
Go back there right now!
Promise! Say it!

493
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,913
- I'll promise if you--
- No! Say it! Promise!

494
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,003
- Go back to that place.
- Only if-- I need--

495
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,213
I need you to wait for me.

496
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,275
Okay? You're it for me, Lou.

497
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,153
You're my fucking heart.
You're it for me, okay?

498
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,803
You gotta wait for me.

499
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,271
Fuck.

500
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,085
Listen to me, listen, listen.

501
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,736
When you get there,
I need you to--

502
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,299
I need you to write to me, okay?

503
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,159
Yeah? Will you write me
and tell me you're okay?

504
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,304
Huh? Promise me.

505
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,807
And, listen, if it's bullshit,
you just get your ass back here.

506
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,602
I'll fix it. I swear to God.
You know I'll fucking fix this.

507
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,587
It's not that hard, okay?
Just come back here.

508
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,569
- I love you.
- My fucking heart.

509
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,678
Okay?

510
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,306
Motherfucker.

511
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,684
Oh, motherfucker.

512
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,586
Motherfucker.

513
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,157
Oh, fuck.

514
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,249
Oh...

515
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,715
Fuck.

516
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,467
Motherfucker.

517
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,066
What's up?

518
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,611
Yo. Hey.

519
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,517
You want my car keys?

520
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,696
If I ask for them back,
I want them back, okay?

521
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,160
We're not doing that.

522
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,334
<i>God, grant me the serenity</i>

523
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,878
<i>to accept the things
I cannot change,</i>

524
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,422
<i>the courage to change
the things I can,</i>

525
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,783
<i>and the wisdom
to know the difference.</i>

526
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,987
Your name.

527
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,716
My name's Ruben.

528
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,384
I'm an addict.

529
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,035
I have four years clean now.

530
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,806
I'm sorry,
I don't talk sign language.

531
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,040
That's it.

532
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,884
My name is Shaheem.

533
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,553
I'm a heroin addict.

534
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,267
Fuck.

535
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,508
Okay.

536
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,906
What?

537
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,700
What?

538
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,120
Okay.

539
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,096
I know!

540
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,915
Um, I don't-- Sorry.

541
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,772
Ruben.

542
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,107
Ruben.

543
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,587
Okay.

544
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,395
Oh.

545
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,581
Okay.

546
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,045
Yeah.

547
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,995
Uh, I'm coming, okay?

548
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,371
One minute.

549
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,439
I'll be back.

550
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,932
Fuck.

551
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,590
Oh, hey, Joe.

552
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,305
What was that all about,
Ruben?

553
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,226
What, with your roof?

554
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,581
I was fixing your roof.
One of the eaves is--

555
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,190
I was trying to fix your roof.

556
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,693
You don't need
to fix anything here.

557
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:46,885
Okay.

558
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,501
I've got a little assignment
for you, okay?

559
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,669
You get up early, right?

560
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,297
Yeah, pretty early, yeah.

561
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,261
I'll have hot coffee
waiting for you at 5:30.

562
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,972
Early enough for you?

563
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,496
I don't know, I guess.

564
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,813
Okay, 5.

565
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,190
And I'll, uh...

566
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,776
provide a room for you.

567
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,463
- What for?
- And there's nothing

568
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,590
that needs to be
accomplished in this room.

569
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,408
All I want you to do is just...

570
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,786
sit.

571
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,668
All I ask is if and when
you cannot just sit...

572
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,396
you turn yourself
to the pen and paper

573
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,256
that I'm gonna supply for you.

574
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,800
And I want you to...

575
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,469
write.

576
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,324
Doesn't matter what you write,
how you write,

577
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,326
whether
it's spelled correctly...

578
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,645
or if it's just
a big, pthht, mess.

579
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,024
I don't care.
No one will read it, okay?

580
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,213
But I want you
to keep writing continuously,

581
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,990
without stopping,
until you feel like you can...

582
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,619
sit again.

583
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,029
Does it have to be writing?

584
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,890
Writing, yes. No drawing.
Writing, yes.

585
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,249
And if...
sometime in the future,

586
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:44,002
it feels like it's a little bit
too difficult for you,

587
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:45,694
you should come and find me.

588
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,655
I'll be in my apartment...

589
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,284
doing the same thing as you,
okay, Ruben?

590
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,291
I'll be writing too.

591
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,837
Okay.

592
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,720
Mmm, nice.

593
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,078
Nice, nice, nice.

594
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,456
So fucking stupid.

595
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,382
So fucking stupid.

596
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,888
You fucking idiot.

597
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,778
What a fucking idiot.

598
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:33,800
Yeah!

599
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,432
I feel a little bit old today.

600
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,061
You are old.

601
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,608
I love your name sign, "Ruben."

602
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:37,423
That first day you were here...

603
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,324
you reminded me of an owl.

604
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,330
Owl.

605
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:59,344
And you've become very important
to a lot of people around here.

606
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,222
You know? It's true.

607
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,058
Thank you.

608
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,187
I'd like to offer you...

609
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:14,067
a way that maybe you can
continue on here with us.

610
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,171
I imagine
you're starting to think

611
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,364
about the future a little bit?

612
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,616
- Future?
- Future.

613
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,618
I know I am.

614
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,183
But, uh, I do think
there's a way

615
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,292
you could maybe stay
and work here...

616
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,253
uh, maybe with my program.

617
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:38,466
Maybe...
with the kids at school.

618
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,010
Maybe both.

619
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:46,599
Anyway...

620
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,853
you, uh, think about it,
you know?

621
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:13,144
What the fuck?

622
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,202
Her?

623
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:17,954
Yeah.

624
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,628
Heh, yeah. Cute.

625
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,007
What do you think, huh?
Yo, what do you think?

626
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,676
This?

627
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,154
<i>All?</i>

628
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,388
Yeah.

629
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:39,284
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, yo, it's easy.

630
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,893
It's easy. Just slowly.

631
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,289
Yo. It's for her, huh?

632
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,149
It's for her. We need money.
We need money.

633
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,986
Huh? It's for us.

634
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,449
I'm leveling with you.
It's for her.

635
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,030
Yo. For this...

636
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,825
for this, remember, it's, uh--

637
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,743
It's cash, okay? Not check.

638
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,687
Cool. Yo, you okay?

639
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:26,564
Sure?

640
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,447
Hi, is that Prince Audiology?
Can you hear me?

641
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:06,831
It's Stone. Ruben Stone.

642
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,251
Stone. S-T-O-N-E.

643
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,503
I'm confirming an appointment.

644
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:18,342
Yeah, I can hold.

645
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:46,948
- 50, listen--
- What did you say?

646
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,074
- Write it down.
- Yeah.

647
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,600
I can't hear you. Write it down.

648
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:15,042
- I got a proposition for you.
- What's that?

649
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:17,646
What if I give it to you
at this price?

650
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,633
But on one condition.

651
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,264
I have the option of coming back
to you within eight weeks.

652
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,325
Okay?

653
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:33,269
I get to buy it back off you
for 10 percent more than this.

654
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,830
Everything has to be
in its current condition.

655
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,148
Everything has to be exactly
like it is now.

656
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,568
Hmm? What do you think?

657
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,632
- Why would you wanna do that?
- I can't hear you. I'm deaf.

658
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:48,534
So it's take it or leave it.
What's it gonna be?

659
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,804
<i>Okay?</i>

660
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,670
You're back.

661
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,091
Come on. Have a seat here.

662
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,063
Um...

663
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:25,649
I did the deed.

664
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,610
The deed?

665
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,575
Surgery.

666
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,419
How'd you get the money?

667
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,630
I sold my RV and other shit.

668
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,736
- Okay.
- Look, Joe.

669
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,015
I really don't wanna
explain myself right now, okay?

670
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,703
It's time, okay?

671
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,896
It's time.
We gotta do something.

672
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:05,999
Right?

673
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:08,192
Try and save my fucking life.

674
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,213
So that's what I'm doing, okay?

675
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,324
No one else is gonna
save my life. Right?

676
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,970
If I just sit here
and diddle around,

677
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,496
what am I gonna have? Nothing.

678
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,331
Okay?

679
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:25,101
And all this shit,
what does it matter?

680
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,978
What does it matter?
It just passes.

681
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:30,881
Yo, if I disappear,
like, who cares?

682
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,068
Nobody cares, man. Seriously.

683
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,386
Yo, and that's okay.
That's life.

684
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,347
That's life.

685
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,075
No, for real, okay?

686
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,036
It just passes. It just fucking--

687
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,686
Fucking passes.

688
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,651
I wonder, uh...

689
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:54,112
all these mornings
you've been sitting in my study.

690
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,031
Sitting.

691
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:00,786
Have you had any...

692
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,915
moments of stillness?

693
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,672
Because you're right, Ruben.

694
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,734
The world does keep moving,
and it can be a...

695
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,843
damn cruel place.

696
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,805
But for <i>me...</i>

697
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:26,037
those moments of stillness,

698
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:29,648
that place,
that's the kingdom of God.

699
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:35,654
And that place...

700
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,282
will never abandon you.

701
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:42,911
But...

702
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:49,501
...I see you've made
your choice, right?

703
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,671
Yeah.

704
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,800
And I sincerely hope...

705
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,761
that it brings you
happiness, Ruben.

706
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:11,874
You know
what I was wondering?

707
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,483
I don't know if it's possible...

708
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:17,404
But, uh,

709
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,550
I need money to--

710
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,660
Just to buy back my RV,
you know?

711
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:27,765
You know, me and Lou,
it's where we live.

712
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,082
It's our home.

713
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,269
You know?

714
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,128
And I can totally pay you back.

715
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:37,066
Just, um, now I've got
an issue with time.

716
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:45,932
Ruben...

717
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,563
I don't understand the situation
that you put yourself in...

718
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:54,816
but from where I'm sitting...

719
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:58,862
you look and sound
like an addict.

720
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,073
No, no. Yo, no.

721
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,343
I'm not. It's not a--

722
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,178
I'm not an--

723
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:06,721
It's fine, okay?

724
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:09,289
My situation, it's cool, okay?

725
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,810
Seriously,
my girlfriend's dad is rich.

726
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,063
He'll give me the money, okay?

727
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,881
This is nothing. You can't
imagine how nothing this is.

728
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,234
Seriously.

729
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,468
Okay?

730
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,114
I'm fucking stupid.
I'm sorry to ask.

731
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:27,057
I'm sorry, okay?

732
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,643
Okay.

733
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:38,318
I'm just gonna stay just...

734
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:44,533
three or four weeks
until they... activate.

735
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,291
Ruben...

736
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,398
as you know, everybody here
shares in the belief

737
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:01,192
that being deaf
is not a handicap,

738
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,009
not something to fix.

739
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,389
It's pretty important
around here.

740
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,643
All these kids...

741
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:14,855
all of us...

742
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,274
need to be reminded of it...

743
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,401
every day.

744
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:27,617
And my house is a house built on
that belief and built on trust.

745
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,581
And when that trust
is violated...

746
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,666
things happen.

747
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,550
And I can't have that.

748
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,263
There are too many others
to consider.

749
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:52,559
And so...

750
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:56,563
in your current state,
at this time...

751
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:01,401
I'm gonna have to ask you
to pack up your bags today...

752
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:05,071
and find another place
to be, Ruben.

753
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:20,879
Cool.

754
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,565
Are you ready?

755
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:30,902
Okay.

756
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:41,746
Here we go.

757
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,634
Can you hear me?

758
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:02,952
- Say again.
- Can you hear me?

759
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,019
Oh!

760
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,730
How does it sound?

761
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,711
Uh, it sounds weird.

762
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:15,131
Okay, well, let's try

763
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:16,632
making an adjustment.

764
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:23,806
How about now? How is that?

765
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:26,583
Oh, that's bad. It, um...

766
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:31,087
It's bad.

767
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,443
Do you want to describe
what you're hearing?

768
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,760
It's, um...

769
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:41,139
It's like... high. High.

770
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,059
Um...

771
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,604
Um...

772
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,482
can you change the--?

773
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:55,904
Well, I can try
and make another adjustment.

774
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:01,910
How's that?

775
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:10,061
Okay. Ruben, this is not sound
like you remember,

776
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:12,271
and it's the implant
in your head

777
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:13,898
that's tricking your brain

778
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:16,466
into thinking
you're actually hearing...

779
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:21,221
when in reality,
your ears aren't working still.

780
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:27,703
So I would suggest
that you take it easy

781
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:29,562
for the next few weeks and...

782
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:31,523
just...

783
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:35,819
get adjusted
to how things sound.

784
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,158
Just take your time.

785
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,908
Yeah, hi. Is that, um--?

786
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,369
Is Lou there?

787
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,998
Who is <i>this?</i>

788
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,459
It's-- It's Ruben.

789
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:00,880
It's Ruben.

790
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:04,509
<i>- Ah.</i>
- Mmm.

791
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:24,696
Hey.

792
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,031
<i>Bonjour.</i> Uh...

793
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:29,325
- Ruben.
- Come in.

794
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:36,040
You are hungry, Ruben?

795
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,211
Yes?

796
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,559
Louise is not here.

797
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,832
Ah, you are hearing?

798
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:01,375
- You are hearing?
- Yeah.

799
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,276
I-- I had an operation.

800
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:05,320
Wow, yes?

801
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,951
Oh, what is this? What--?

802
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:15,872
Oh, that's very good. Louise
told me your wish for this.

803
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,293
Oh.

804
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:24,881
And so, uh...

805
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,110
So you're back
to your drums now?

806
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:30,779
Uh... not yet.

807
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:32,489
I gotta-- I gotta, um--

808
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:35,159
I gotta deal with
some stuff first, you know?

809
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,769
Just gotta--
Gotta settle some things.

810
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:41,064
Yes. Settle? Like what?

811
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:42,982
You know, just, like--

812
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,462
Just getting back into it
and also some financial stuff.

813
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,464
- Yes.
- You know, just gotta figure it out.

814
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:49,614
Mm-hmm.

815
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:54,011
Yes. And Louise knows
that you're here?

816
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:55,536
No. No.

817
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,663
So it's a big surprise.

818
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:07,006
Well, Louise has been
quite busy, you know?

819
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:08,800
Mm-hmm.

820
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:11,528
We're doing a party.

821
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:14,365
So she'll be back home tonight.

822
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:16,140
That's most certainly.

823
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:23,332
Oh, you want--?

824
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:25,316
I'm gonna make you some eggs.

825
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,670
Oh, no. I'm good. Do you need
any help with any of this?

826
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:30,255
No, no.

827
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,656
You need some eggs.

828
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,200
Thanks.

829
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:38,496
Where did you grow, Ruben?

830
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:41,975
- Where did I grow up?
- Yes.

831
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:44,436
Um, like, all over, you know?

832
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,295
Texas, California.

833
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:48,423
Arizona, Virginia.

834
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:50,401
Yeah. All over.

835
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:52,135
Why so many places?

836
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,781
I was, like, uh--

837
01:38:55,805 --> 01:38:57,991
My mom was a nurse
in the military.

838
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,785
- Mm-hmm.
- You know,

839
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:01,602
so she'd get moved around.

840
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:05,523
- And your father too?
- No. I mean, I don't know.

841
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:07,817
I see.

842
01:39:11,404 --> 01:39:13,531
Uh, I must be honest, I...

843
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:17,344
did not always have
good feelings for you, Ruben,

844
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,786
all these years.

845
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,582
I confide, it is like if one...

846
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:28,004
had stolen something precious.

847
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,066
You understand?

848
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:34,302
But I know it's not you
that took Louise from me.

849
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:37,889
Her mother did that.

850
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:42,911
She took Louise
when she left me.

851
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:46,272
And she took her again
when she killed herself.

852
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:52,278
And Louise must have
come back home then...

853
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,739
but she was hating me so much.

854
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:56,866
What could I do?

855
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:59,619
And you, you...

856
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:06,268
Well, you gave her
a place to go... then.

857
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:09,170
And this is a good thing.

858
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,734
Do you see, I didn't like you
much at the time,

859
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,402
but now I thank you.

860
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:17,261
I want to say to you that.

861
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,809
But anyhow, you're gonna be
so happy to see how Louise...

862
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,145
is doing great now.

863
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,148
And that's the most important.

864
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:31,692
Isn't it?

865
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:35,738
Hmm? Okay.

866
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:22,493
Whoa.

867
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:25,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

868
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:26,622
Hi.

869
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:30,835
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah. Loud and clear.

870
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:34,064
Oh, look at you, Lulu.

871
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,506
Holy shit.

872
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:38,443
Look at you, huh?

873
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:40,428
- What?
- You look different.

874
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:46,100
Whoa, no scratching, huh?

875
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:48,185
Oh, yeah.

876
01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:50,521
That's good.

877
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:53,566
Mwah.

878
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:12,060
Does it feel weird?

879
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:13,895
Yeah. Does it look weird?

880
01:42:13,919 --> 01:42:15,439
No.

881
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:17,298
No, it doesn't.
It looks really neat.

882
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,425
Mmm.

883
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:23,012
- So crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

884
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:25,616
How'd you do it?

885
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,141
Just worked some magic.

886
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,228
I have to talk to you about it.

887
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,082
I had to just
move some things around.

888
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:36,233
Louise, <i>tu descends?</i>

889
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:39,212
Um,

890
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:41,572
did Richard tell you about
this party thing tonight?

891
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:43,383
Oh, shit. Yeah.

892
01:42:43,407 --> 01:42:45,427
Yeah, I have to go,
sort some things out.

893
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:47,203
- No, it's great. It's cool.
- Yeah.

894
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:50,039
- Go do your thing.
- Okay.

895
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,768
Do you need anything?

896
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:54,293
No, I'm good.

897
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,462
I'll just be downstairs.

898
01:43:54,395 --> 01:43:57,541
- Hey.
- Ruben, <i>mon petite ami.</i>

899
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,751
Hi. Hi, what's up?

900
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:01,253
Good. How are you?

901
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:03,112
- Say again?
- How are you?

902
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:05,072
How are you?

903
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:08,260
- Did you get some food?
- Huh?

904
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,011
Did you get some food?

905
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:11,805
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You okay?

906
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,391
- Mm-hmm. You?
- Yeah, yeah.

907
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,211
It's okay.

908
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:21,797
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

Hey.

937
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:24,099
Are you okay?

938
01:48:24,123 --> 01:48:25,624
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

939
01:48:57,406 --> 01:48:59,426
Um, sorry.

940
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:01,136
I just need some water. Ahem.

941
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:07,708
Are you okay?

942
01:49:08,292 --> 01:49:10,103
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

943
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:11,813
Yeah, it's just
a little dry in here.

944
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:20,637
Hey, that was, uh--
That was pretty cool tonight.

945
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:24,701
- You sounded fucking great.
- Yeah, right.

946
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:26,995
What, you're telling me
you weren't feeling it?

947
01:49:27,019 --> 01:49:28,455
- You were in it.
- Well, yeah.

948
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:30,498
Straight up. You sounded
amazing singing that.

949
01:49:30,522 --> 01:49:32,357
That's my dad's stuff, but...

950
01:49:33,275 --> 01:49:35,795
- And you're speaking French now.
- Oh, my God. Barely.

951
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:37,404
I didn't know you could do that.

952
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:41,867
Well, I've mostly forgotten,
but it's coming back a little.

953
01:49:43,035 --> 01:49:45,013
Yeah, I was thinking, like,
do you remember--?

954
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:46,830
You remember this place at all?

955
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:49,708
I didn't, but...

956
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:52,145
it's so disconcerting,

957
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:55,631
the things that your memory
holds onto without you knowing.

958
01:49:57,382 --> 01:49:59,819
My mom and I never really
talked about this place.

959
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:02,721
It was always some
weird dreamy idea, but...

960
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,992
I mean,
now it's come back a little.

961
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:07,226
Right.

962
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:09,728
Yeah.

963
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:14,358
I told everyone about
our little gypsy life together.

964
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:16,961
I miss it.

965
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,922
We gotta get back into it.

966
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:20,715
You know?
We gotta get back on it.

967
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:23,843
We gotta get back in the
fucking-- In the groove, huh?

968
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:27,138
Don't you think? I gotta go
get the Airstream sorted.

969
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:28,556
What do you mean, "sorted"?

970
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:31,392
I just got a shit ton
of things to do, you know?

971
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:33,186
Right.
Like, with the tour stuff?

972
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,604
- The tour, everything.
- Yeah.

973
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:35,939
We just gotta get back on it.

974
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:38,399
You know, everything.
The album, the tour.

975
01:50:38,423 --> 01:50:40,008
The... You know?

976
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:43,387
Yeah.

977
01:50:49,685 --> 01:50:50,686
Hey.

978
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:20,924
