戒指

151
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,850
扫把

152
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,520
细菌

153
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,750
生命

154
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
队伍

155
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,950
盖子

156
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,730
盖子

157
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,220
这是你的测试表  鲁本
This is your chart, Ruben.

158
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,410
在你能听到的音量下
Now, as far as the volume that you can hear,

159
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,370
你的右耳听力水平是28%
you, on your right ear, were 28%,

160
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,070
左耳水平是24%
and on your left ear, you were 24%.

161
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,000
-什么  -你的左耳
- It's what? - In the left ear,

162
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,760
听力水平是24%
you came in at 24%.

163
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,400
好
Okay.

164
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,480
不管我把测试音量调到多大
No matter how loud I made the test--

165
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,960
就算音量破格  你也还是听不见
I could have put it at 11-- you were still going to miss

166
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,730
我说的词里的70%到80%
70% to 80% of the words that I said.

167
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,770
好
Okay.

168
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,910
这可不妙
That is not good.

169
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,730
嗯  我能看出来
Yeah, I see that.

170
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,740
所以
So, what...

171
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,120
我们该怎么做
What can we do about it?

172
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,390
我该怎么恢复听力
How do I get it back?

173
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,870
这个...
Well, um...

174
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,340
你得明白一件事
you have to understand something here.

175
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,040
不管这是因为
Whether or not this is related to

176
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,080
你经常接触噪音
your exposure to noise

177
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,940
还是因为自身免疫
or it's an autoimmune issue

178
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,880
这都不重要
doesn't really matter.

179
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,530
我明白我有问题
I understand I got a problem.

180
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,650
我是在问你该怎么做
I'm asking you what I can do about it.

181
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,430
首先你能做的就是
Well, what you can do about it first

182
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,680
彻底避免接触大音量噪音
is to eliminate all exposure to loud noises.

183
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,030
然后我们再做一些检查来确诊
And then we can run some tests and we can determine exactly

184
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,430
你的耳朵到底怎么了
what is going on with your ears.

185
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,960
如果确诊了  我们就能讨论下一步措施
And if we do, then we can have our other conversations.

186
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,070
我们就能什么
We can have what?

187
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,590
有一些植入设备可以绕过耳蜗
Well, there are implants that bypass the cochlea.

188
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,020
你说植入设备
You said implants?

189
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,540
-对  -管用吗
- Yes. - Those work?

190
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,960
对于听力严重受损或者
For people with severe hearing loss or

191
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,310
完全失聪的人来说  确实有用
complete deafness, yes, they help.

192
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,770
那就这么办吧
Well, then let's do that.

193
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,160
没那么简单
Well, it's not that simple.

194
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,460
这是个很耗时的过程  而且花费不菲
Uh, it's a very involved process, and it's quite costly.

195
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,740
要花多少钱
How much is it?

196
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,810
花费可达四万到八万美元
Well, they can run between $40,000 and $80,000,

197
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,160
而且保险不报销
depending, and they are not covered by insurance.

198
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,080
好
Okay.

199
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,860
那...
And, um...

200
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,890
你什么时候能做
Like, when-when can you do it?

201
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,330
现在有货吗
You got 'em in stock now?

202
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,970
斯通先生  你的听力
Mr. Stone, your hearing

203
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,180
正在急剧衰退
is deteriorating rapidly.

204
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,290
我说的对吗
Am I right?

205
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,360
在接下来的几天
And over the next few days,

206
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,830
甚至几小时里  还会继续恶化
or even hours, it's going to continue.

207
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,050
而你已经损失的听力
And the hearing that you have lost

208
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,390
是没法恢复的
is not coming back.

209
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,730
你必须明白
You have to understand

210
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,180
你的首要任务
your first responsibility

211
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,900
是保护现在仅存的听力
is to preserve the hearing you have.

212
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,120
鲁本  搞什么
Ruben, what the fuck?

213
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,680
-我什么都听不见  -什么
- I can't hear anything. - What?

214
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,270
我什么都听不见
I can't hear anything.

215
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,120
{\an8}会恢复吗

216
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,770
对  会恢复的
Yes, it'll come back.

217
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,990
我得...
I have to...

218
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,970
就是做个手术
There's, like, a surgery.

219
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,550
什么
What?

220
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,120
很简单  没什么的  就是把植入设备
It's simple. It's all it is. There's an implant.

221
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,310
放进脑袋里
They put it in your shit.

222
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,260
就像...
It's like a...

223
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,800
听力会恢复的
Okay, it'll come back.

224
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,350
没事的  露
It's fine, Lou.

225
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,250
大概要四万到八万  但是...
It's, like, 40 grand, 80 grand, whatever, but it's...

226
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,950
会恢复的
it'll come back.

227
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,670
在那之前  我们就继续表演  好吗
Till then, Lou, we just keep going, okay?

228
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,240
-不  不  -露  听我说
- No. No. - Lou. Listen to me.

229
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,940
我们明天试试  看看情况如何
Let's play tomorrow, let's see what it's like.

230
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,090
我们试试  好吗
Let's try it, okay?

231
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,560
我来打节拍
I'm gonna be like a click track.

232
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,740
你跟着我唱
You can play to me.

233
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,120
-不行  -你可以调整...
- No. - Huh? You can adj...

234
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,270
会不太一样  但就是这么回事  露
It's different, but it is what it is, Lou.

235
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,240
露  我们...我们的巡演都安排好了
Lou, we have a t... Lou, we have a tour booked.

236
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,170
-这不安全  -我们的巡演都安排好了
- It's not safe. - We have a tour booked.

237
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,880
-我们的巡演都安排好了  露  -不
- We have a tour booked, Lou. - No.

238
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,730
-这不重要  这不重要  -我们有巡演
- It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. - Yes, we do.

239
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,640
-这不安全  这不安全  -我们的巡演都安排好了
- It's not safe, it's not safe. - We have a tour booked!

240
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,230
-鲁本  -我就知道
- Ruben. - I fucking knew it.

241
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,230
能给我支烟吗
You got a smoke, please?

242
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,700
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

243
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,520
他睡了
He's sleeping.

244
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,530
赫克特
Hi, Hector?

245
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,190
我是露
Hi. This is Lou.

246
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,750
鲁本现在...有点麻烦
Ruben's having a bit of... a bit of trouble right now.

247
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,020
-他...  -赫克特  你好吗
- He's... - Hey, Hector, what's up?

248
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,200
他有点听力问题
He's got some hearing problems.

249
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,760
对  我可以把电话给他
Yeah, I mean, I can put him on,

250
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,420
但他听不见你说的话
but he won't be able to hear you.

251
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,440
好
Okay.

252
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,940
跟他说  跟他说
Talk to him. Talk to him.

253
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,350
赫克特  你好吗  兄弟
Hey, Hector, what's going on, man?

254
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,930
我是鲁本
It's Ruben.

255
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,910
我也想说很高兴听到你的声音
I'd say it's good to hear your voice,

256
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,880
但你说的话我一个字也听不见
but I can't hear a fuckin' word you're saying right now.

257
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,490
所以这毫无意义
So this is completely pointless.

258
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,050
露想让我给你打电话  因为我抽了支烟
Lou wanted me to call you because I had a cigarette.

259
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,050
是不太好  不太理想  但是
You know, not great, not ideal, but...

260
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,870
考虑到目前的情况相当操蛋
considering the circumstances, which are pretty fucked up,

261
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,070
这也完全是可以理解的
you know, understandable.

262
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,330
我觉得可以理解
I'd say understandable,

263
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,820
除了露以外  大家应该都能理解
for everyone apart from Lou, it seems.

264
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,690
我没问题  兄弟
I got this, bro.

265
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,040
我知道你大概想问我现在情绪如何
I know you'd probably be asking me if I'm steady right now,

266
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,810
头脑清不清楚
if I'm feeling level.

267
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,770
不是特别清楚  但还行
Not completely, but I'm cool.

268
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,150
你大概会说当自己不再幻想
You'd tell me serenity is something you get

269
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,980
改变过去后  人就会获得内心的平静
when you, uh, stop wishing for a different past.

270
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,370
兄弟  我爱你  老兄
Bro, I love you, man.

271
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,650
我的经纪人要把手机拿回去
Oh, my manager wants the... wants the phone back,

272
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,710
所以我不说了
so I got to go.

273
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,200
好  爱你  兄弟
Okay, love you, bro.

274
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,450
对  他一个字也听不见
Yeah, he- he can't hear a word.

275
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,470
他又听不见  你带他去互助会有什么用
Well, if you get him to a group, then how is he gonna hear?

276
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,680
好
Okay.

277
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,430
好  谢谢  赫克特  谢谢你
Okay, tha- thanks, Hector, thank you.

278
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,000
什么时候  什么时候
When? When?

279
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,900
好  行  我会把音量调大
Okay, yeah, I'll make sure it's on loud.

280
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,270
好  非常感谢  谢谢
Okay, thank you so much. Thank you.

281
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,680
好  再见
Okay, bye.

282
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,470
他会再打过来
He's gonna call back.

283
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,250
他说了什么
What did he say?

284
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,890
写下来  告诉我他说了...
Write it down. Tell... what did he...

285
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,300
"会再打过来"
"Call back."

286
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,990
他会再打过来  就这样
He's gonna call back - that's all?

287
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,480
该死的赫克特
Fuckin' Hector.

288
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,300
我们现在怎么办
What are we gonna do now?

289
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,710
你想怎么做  露
What do you want to do, Lou?

我们在密苏里州  要花几天才能到
Well, we're- we're in Missouri, so that's gonna take a few days.

298
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,430
我不太清楚
I don't... I don't really know.

299
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,800
不不不  我们马上就出发

308
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,520

322
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,420
好吧
Well, okay.

323
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,110
露  这是路易

324
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,010
它是我的助听犬
He's my hearing dog.

325
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,310
它告诉我你们到了
He let me know you were here.

326
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,870
它的名字取自59年白袜队球员
I named it after Louie Aparicio

327
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,750

好了
Okay.

340
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,630
这个能用
So, it works.

341
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,440
你看这个可以吗
Is this okay for you?

342
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,050
可以  你能听见我说话吗
Yeah, can you hear me?

343
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,160
不能  我读你的唇语
No. No, I'm gonna read your lips.

344
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,630
可能会漏掉一些  但我尽量  好吗
I might miss some things, but I'm gonna try, okay?

345
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,820
-好  -你说话尽量吐字清晰
- Okay. - Just try, try to speak clearly.

346
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,780
好
Yeah.

347
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,320
你好吗  鲁本
How are you, Ruben?

348
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,250
{\an8}你好吗  鲁本

349
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,160
我还好
I'm okay.

350
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,770
你有毒瘾吗
You're an addict?

351
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,680
有
Yeah.

352
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,990
哪种毒品
What sort of drugs?

353
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,210
我吸哪种毒品
What'd I take?

354
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,990
来者不拒
Everything.

355
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,030
主要是海洛因
Mainly heroin.

356
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,400
海洛因
Heroin.

357
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,030
你失去听力后  想过要吸毒吗
Have you thought about using since you lost your hearing?

358
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,490
今天不太好过
Today is not a good day.

359
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,130
我头脑不清楚
I'm not thinking clear today.

360
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,600
聊聊我的情况吧
Let's talk about me.

361
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,690
我酗酒
I'm an alcoholic.

362
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,500
越战的时候  一枚炸弹在我身边爆炸
I lost my hearing in the Vietnam War

363
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,310
我因此失去了听力
when a bomb exploded near me.

364
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,750
我还记得那枚炸弹爆炸时
I still remember the music I was listening to

365
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,280
我在听的音乐
when that bomb went off.

366
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,160
在那之后  我失去了一切
After that, I lost everything else -

367
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,070
我的妻子  我的孩子
my wife, my kid.

368
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,030
注意  鲁本  那不是因为我聋了
Not because of being deaf, mind you, Ruben.

369
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,610
而是因为酗酒
It was the beer.

370
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,020
你戒毒多久了
How long you been clean?

371
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,060
四年了
Four years.

372
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,130
四年
Four?

373
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,150
你现在需要帮助吗
And you need some help right now?

374
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,060
我应该去看看露
Yo, I should check on Lou.

375
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,240
你们俩在一起多久了
How long you two been together?

376
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,770
四年
Four years.

377
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,460
你搞音乐  对吗
You play music, right?

378
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,250
-不  -不
- No. - No?

379
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,490
现在不搞了
No, not anymore.

380
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,260
我得先去装植入设备
Not until I get the implant.

381
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,520
-植入设备  -对
- Implant? - Yeah.

382
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,670
抱歉  你了解现在的植入设备吗
Sorry, you know about these implants they got now?

383
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,380
就是  他们有植入设备
It's like... it's like, uh... th- they have implants.

384
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,890
我知道  对
I know. Yes.

385
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,920
很贵
Expensive.

386
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,970
对  谢谢  确实很贵
Yeah. Thank you. Yes, they are.

387
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:47,770
好了
So...

388
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,940
你要明白
You should understand that, uh,

389
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,660
这是个失聪人士社区
this is a Deaf community.

390
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,010
不只是有我的项目  我们属于
Not just my program, but we're part

391
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,250
{\an8}你要明白  鲁本
这是个失聪人士社区  不只是有我的项目
我们属于一个更大的失聪人士社区

392
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,920
一个更大的失聪人士社区
of a larger Deaf community.

393
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,800
我的项目  和参加项目的人
And my program, and the people in it,

394
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,380
都从这个失聪人士社区中受益良多
they benefit tremendously from that Deaf community.

395
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,090
我们同他们合作
We work with them,

396
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,610
他们也同我们合作
and they work with us.

397
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,420
但有一点很重要
But it's very important,

398
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,740
如果你想留在这里
if you want to be here,

399
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,240
你要明白  我们想要解决的
to understand that we're looking for a solution to...

400
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,980
是思想的问题
to this...

401
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,580
而不是听力的问题
not this.

402
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,860
你叫露也进来吧
Why don't you go invite Lou in here?

403
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,210
好
Sure.

404
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,060
露
Lou!

405
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,510
他想跟你谈谈
This guy wants to talk to you.

406
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,150
好
Okay.

407
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,510
我觉得你现在应该
Well... I think it's important

408
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,480
留在我们这里  鲁本
that you stay here with us right now, Ruben,

409
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,250
学点手语
learn some sign language,

410
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,210
踏踏实实地适应
find some solid ground.

411
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,540
你怎么想
What do you think?

412
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,780
听起来很好
Man, it sounds great,

413
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,690
但我们现在没多少钱
but we don't have a lot of money right now.

414
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,080
我们的教会有时会资助需要帮助的失聪人士
Well, sometimes our church sponsors deaf people in need,

415
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,000
而现在
and right now,

416
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,630
你符合条件  鲁本
you fit the bill, Ruben.

417
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,060
我们真的不是那种
We're really not

418
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,470
-会去教堂的人  -抱歉  我得读...
- churchgoing people. - Sorry, I-I read...

419
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,020
抱歉  鲁本  我得读唇语  我没...
Sorry, Ruben, I read lips. I can't...

420
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,970
你刚才说什么
What'd you say?

421
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,840
我们两个都不信教
We're not religious, either of us.

422
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,580
对宗教完全不感兴趣
Very much not into religion.

423
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,080
无意冒犯
No offense, you know.

424
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,380
宗教与此无关  鲁本
Religion plays no part in this, Ruben.

425
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,710
教会帮助
The church helps

426
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,880
有需要的人  而不是信教的人
people in need, not religious people.

427
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,090
重要的是你想留在这里
The important thing is that you want to stay here.

428
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,480
好吧
Yeah.

429
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,440
露
Lou?

430
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,990
你觉得鲁本现在需要帮助吗
Do you think Ruben needs help right now?

431
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,330
你要明白如果...
You understand, if, uh...

432
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,200
鲁本打算留在这里
Ruben were to stay here,

433
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,790
他就得靠自己了
he'd have to do it on his own.

434
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,630
大家都住在与外界隔绝的房子里
Members live in a house separate from the outside world.

435
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,180
与外界没有联系

我发现无论怎样  这都是最好的办法
I've found that in all cases, that's the way it works best.

438

你想...你想先试几天吗
You want... you want to try this for a couple days?

我们有自己的家
We have our own home.

443

我们可以住在房车里
We can stay in the RV.

444
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,380
不  很遗憾  我们这里
No, I'm sorry to say, that's not the way

445
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,470
不允许这样  鲁本
that it works here, Ruben.

446
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,880
那就有问题了
Well, that's a problem, then.

447
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,140
这段时间里你有地方可去吗  露
Do you have anywhere you can be during this time, Lou?

448
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,160
就这样吧  不说了
Yo, that's that, man. We're done.

449

我觉得我们还是应该去
I'm thinking we should still go hit

455

参加达顿的演出

Okay? I can... I can fuckin' watch you for cues.

457

我知道上次有点不顺  但我们...
I know it was rocky last time, but we did...

458
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,980
我们没提前说好
we weren't on the same page.

459
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,920
现在你知道怎么回事了  我可以看着你
Now you know what's up, I can fuckin' watch you.

460
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,630
我对谱子了如指掌
And I know this shit inside out.

461

好吧  我肯定能搞定
Okay, yo. I can fuckin' make it work

直到我们赚够钱做手术

我想帮你修好
I was trying to fix your roof.

你在这里不需要修任何东西

616
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:53,810
好吧
Okay.

617
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,020

准备好热咖啡
at 5:30.

624
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,830
够不够早
Early enough for you?

625
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,330
我说不好  也许吧
I don't know. I guess.

626
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,790
好吧  那就5点
Okay, 5:00.

627
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,000
我还会
And I'll, uh,

628
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,760
为你准备一个房间
provide a room for you.

629
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:29,340
做什么
What for?

630
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,680
在那个房间里你什么也不用完成
And there's nothing that needs to be accomplished in this room.

631
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,600
我想让你做的只是
All I want you to do is just...

632
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,600
静坐
sit.

633
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,900
我所要求的只是  你坐不住的时候
All I ask is if and when you cannot just sit,

634
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
就拿起笔和纸
you turn yourself to the pen and paper

635
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,240
我会为你准备好纸笔
that I'm going to supply for you.

636
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,490
我希望你
And I want you to...

637
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,410
写东西
write.

638
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,340
你写什么  怎么写
Doesn't matter what you write, how you write,

639
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,910
拼写对不对  这些都不重要
whether it's spelled correctly.

640
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,790
哪怕你就是
Or if it's just a big...

641
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,710
瞎写
mess.

642
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,170
我不在乎
I don't care.

643
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,050
不会有人看的
No one will read it, okay?

644
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,220
但我要你一直写下去
But I want you to keep writing

645
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,400
不要停下
continuously without stopping

646
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,050
直到你感觉自己能...
until you feel like you can...

647
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,520
坐得住了
sit again.

648
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,010
-一定得写东西吗  -写  没错
- Does it have to be writing? - Writing, yes.

649
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,990
不能画画  要写东西
No drawing. Writing, yes.

650
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:48,430
如果到了某个时候
And if... sometime in the future,

651
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:50,710
你觉得这对你来说有点太难了
it feels like it's a little bit too difficult for you,

652
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,590
你就来找我
you should come and find me.

653
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,640
我会在我的公寓里
I'll be in my apartment

654

655
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,150
我也会在写东西
I'll be writing, too.

656
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:10,610

01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,650
你已经变得非常重要
to a lot of people around here.

723
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,680
你知道吗  是真的
You know? It's true.

724
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,880
谢谢
Thank you.

725
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,250
我想给你提供
I'd like to offer you a...

726
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,230
一个机会
a way that

727
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:21,500
让你能继续留在我们这里
maybe you can continue on here with us.

728
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:24,240
我想你已经开始考虑
I imagine you're starting to think

729
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,560
自己的未来了吧
about the future a little bit?

730
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,940
-未来吗  -未来
- Future? - Future.

731
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,680
我知道我在考虑
I know I am.

732
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,010
不过  我确实觉得
But, uh... I do think there's a way

733
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:38,330
有办法让你留在这里工作
you could maybe stay and work here,

734
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,330
也许是参与我的项目
uh, maybe with my program,

735
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,710
也许是...
maybe...

736
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,760
在学校帮助孩子们
with the kids at school.

737
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:47,990
也许两种都行
Maybe both.

738
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,510
不管怎样
Anyway...

739
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,120
你...
you, uh...

740
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,330
你考虑一下

很简单的  只要慢慢来
It's easy. Just... slowly.

758
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,400
这是为了她
It's for her, huh?

759
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,280
这是为了她
It's for her.

760

我们需要钱  我们需要钱

这是为了我们
It's for us.

762
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,500
我跟你说实话
I'm leveling with you.

763
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,550
这是为了她
It's for her.

764
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,980
这些
For-for this?

765
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,040
这些  记住
For this, remember it's, uh...

766

是普林斯听觉矫治吗
Hi. Is that Prince Audiology?

774
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,640
你能听见我说话吗
Can you hear me?

775
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:10,290
{\an8}下午好  有什么能帮助您的吗

01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,160
鲁莽的鲁  本来的本
R-u-b-e-n,

779
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,470
斯通  斯文的斯  通常的通

我要确认预约
I'm confirming an appointment.

781
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,920
{\an8}好的  斯通先生  请您...

782
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,390
好  我可以等
Yeah, I can hold.

783
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:53,640
听我说
So, listen.

784
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,150
-你说什么  写下来  -好
- What did you say? Write it down. - Yeah, yeah.

785
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:56,520
我听不见你说话  写下来
I can't hear you. Write it down.

786
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,930
我有个提议
I got a proposition for you.

787
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,370
什么提议
What's that?

788
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,840
我就这个价卖给你
What if I give it to you at this price...

789
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,940
但附加一个条件如何
but on one condition?

790
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:35,470
我可以选择在八周内再次联系你
I have the option of coming back to you within eight weeks.

791
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,800
行吗  从你手上赎回来
Okay? I get to buy it back off you

792
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,660
再多给你10%的利息
for ten percent more than this.

793
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,830
但一切都得维持原状
But everything has to be in its current condition.

794
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,320
现在什么样到时候就要什么样
Everything has to be exactly like it is now.

795
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,900
你觉得可以吗
What do you think?

796
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:51,220
你何必这么做呢
Why would you want to do that?

797
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,690
老兄  我听不见你说话  我聋了
Dude, I can't hear you. I'm deaf.

798
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,780
要么接受  要么拉倒
So it's... take it or leave it.

799
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,780
你怎么决定
What's it gonna be?

800
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:38,180
{\an8}乔
我没事
我明天就回来
不用担心
鲁本

801
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:15,690
{\an8}手术很顺利  鲁本
我们绕过了你的耳道
所以这段时间你完全听不到声音

802
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:36,770
{\an8}四周后你要回来激活设备

803
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:11,950
你回来了
You're back?

804
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,960
坐吧
Have a seat here.

805
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,420
谢谢
Thank you.

806
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,870
我做了
I did the deed.

807
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:35,640
做了什么
The deed?

808
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,470
手术
Surgery.

809
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,430
你从哪弄来的钱
How'd you get the money?

810
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:55,880
我卖了房车和其它有的没的
I sold my RV and other shit.

811
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,920
-好吧  -听我说  乔
- Okay. - Look, Joe,

812
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:04,190
我现在真的不想做太多解释
I really don't want to explain myself right now.

813
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,390
可以吗
Okay?

814
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:08,660
是时候了  好吗
It's time. Okay?

815
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:11,020
是时候了  我得做点什么
It's time. I got to do something.

816
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:12,810
好吗
Right?

817
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:15,550
我在拯救我的人生
Trying to save my f-fuckin' life.

818
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,770
这就是我在做的事
So, that's what I'm doing.

819
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,420
行吗  因为没人会救我
Okay? No one else is gonna save my life.

820
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:22,620
不是吗
Right?

821
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,080
如果我坐在这里无所事事
If I just sit here and diddle around,

822
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,510
我能得到什么  我会一无所有
what am I gonna have? Nothing.

823
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,170
好吗
Okay?

824
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:31,160
还有这一切
And all this shit?

825
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,580
重要吗  有什么意义
Like, what does it matter? What does it matter?

826
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:33,820
反正都会过去的
It just passes.

827
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,550
如果我消失了
If I disappear,

828
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,200
有谁会在意
like, who cares?

829
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:40,230
没人会在意
Nobody cares, man.

830
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,150
真的
Seriously.

831
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:42,290
但没关系
Yo, and that's okay.

832
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:43,590
这就是人生
That's life.

833
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,370
这就是人生
That's life.

834
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:48,120
我是认真的  好吗
No, for real. Okay?

835
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,250
都会过去的
It just passes.

836
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,740
他妈的说过去就过去了
It just fucking... fucking passes.

837
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,400
我在想
I wonder, uh...

838
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,190
你在我的书房待了那么多个上午
all these mornings you've been sitting in my study,

839
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,840
坐在那里
sitting,

840
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,320
你有没有
have you...

841
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,050
感受到过
had any...

842
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,580
片刻的
moments of...

843
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:12,140
平静呢
stillness?

844
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:18,710
因为你说得对  鲁本
Because you're right, Ruben.

845
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,580
世界在不断前进
The world does keep moving,

846
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:22,690
同时它也是个
and it can be a damn...

847
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,130
很残酷的地方
cruel place.

848
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,720
但对我而言
But for me...

849
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:33,080
那些平静的时刻
those moments of stillness,

850
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,480
那个地方
that place, that's the...

851
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,970
就是天国
kingdom of God.

852
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,940
那个地方
And that place

853
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,540
永远都不会抛弃你
will never abandon you.

854
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:49,920
但是
But...

855
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,970
我看到你已经做出了选择
I see you've made your choice.

856
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:56,690
是吗
Right?

857
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,170
是的
Yeah.

858
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:03,990
我也衷心希望
And I sincerely hope

859
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,960
你的选择能带给你幸福  鲁本
that it brings you happiness, Ruben.

860
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,220
谢谢
Thank you.

861
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,470
我在想  乔  不知道能不能...
I was wondering, Joe. I don't know if it's possible...

862
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:26,190
我需要钱
but, uh, I need money

863
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:29,540
赎回我的房车
to... just to buy back my RV.

864
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:30,940
就这样
You know?

865
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,160
我和露
You know, me... me and Lou.

866
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,810
那是我们的住所
This is where we live.

867
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,110
是我们的家  我们的家
It's our home. Our home.

868
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:40,550
我绝对会还钱给你
And I can... I can totally pay you back.

869
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:41,900
只是
Just, uh...

870
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,290
现在时间紧迫
Now I got an issue with time.

871
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:52,660
鲁本
Ruben.

872
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,630
我不知道你让自己陷入了何种境地
I don't understand the situation that you've put yourself in,

873
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:00,230
但是
but...

874
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:01,940
在我看来
from where I'm sitting...

875
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,850
你现在的行为举止像是毒瘾犯了
you look and sound like an addict.

876
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,280
不是  我没有
No, I don't. Yo, no.

877
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,470
我没有
I'm not... It's not...

878
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,480
犯毒瘾
Not an addi...

879
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,710
我没事
It's fine. Okay?

880
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,620
我的情况很好  好吗
My situation, it's cool. Okay?

881
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:19,970
真的  我女友她爸很有钱
Seriously, my girlfriend's dad is rich,

882
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:21,660
他可以给我钱
he can give me... give me the money.

883
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,990
这没什么的
Okay? This is nothing.

884
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:25,080
根本就不是事儿
You can't imagine how nothing this is.

885
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:26,770
真的
Seriously.

886
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,130
我太蠢了  很抱歉我问你借钱
I'm fucking stupid. I'm-I'm sorry to ask.

887
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,330
对不起  好吗
I'm sorry. Okay?

888
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,440
好
Okay.

889
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,340
拜托  我能在这里
Please, can I stay here for just...

890
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:48,830
再住三四周吗
three, four weeks?

891
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:49,780
等他们
Till they...

892
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,860
激活设备
activate?

893
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,070
鲁本
Ruben.

894
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:04,330
你也知道  这里的人
As you know, everybody here

895
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:06,070
都坚信
shares in the belief that

896
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:08,080
失聪不是残疾
being deaf is not a handicap.

897
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:10,350
不需要修复
Not something to fix.

898
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,440
这一点对这里的人很重要
It's pretty important around here.

899
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:18,680
这些孩子
All these kids...

900
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:21,940
我们所有人
all of us,

901
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,480
每天都需要将此
need to be reminded of it

902
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,390
铭记在心
every day.

903
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:33,320
我的机构以这一信念为根基
And my house is a house built on that belief,

904
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,950
以信任为根基
and built on trust.

905
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:39,610
当那份信任被打破
And when that trust is violated,

906
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,560
会产生后果
things happen.

907
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,580
而我不能容忍
And I can't have that.

908
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,350
我还有许多其他人
There are too many others

909
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,490
需要关照
to consider.

910
01:27:58,740 --> 01:27:59,650
所以
And so,

911
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:03,640
鉴于你目前的状况
in your current state, at this time...

912
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:08,570
我只能请你今天就打包好行李
I'm going to have to ask you to pack up your bags today

913
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,320
另找住处  鲁本
and find another place to be, Ruben.

914
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:27,700
行
Cool.

915
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:34,340
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

916
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:37,810
好
Okay.

917
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:48,600
开始了
Here we go.

918
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:01,460
你能听见吗
Can you hear me?

919
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,090
再说一遍
Say again.

920
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,350
你能听见吗
Can you hear me?

921
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,690
听起来怎么样
How does it sound?

922
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:18,360
听起来怪怪的
Sounds weird.

923
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:23,740
好的  我来调整一下
Okay, well, let's try making an adjustment.

924
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:30,320
现在如何  还行吗
How about now? How's that?

925
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:32,450
不行
That's bad.

926
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,120
就是...
It's...

927
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:37,620
不行
It's bad.

928
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:42,630
你能形容一下你听到的声音吗
Do you want to describe what you're hearing?

929
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,380
就是...
It's...

930
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:48,470
又高又尖
It's, like, high. High.

931
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:57,310
你能调一下吗
Can you change the...

932
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,110
我可以试着再做一下调整
Well, I can try and make another adjustment.

933
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:08,490
现在怎么样
How's that?

934
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:13,540
好的
Okay.

935
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:17,080
鲁本  这不是你记忆中的声音
Ruben, this is not sound like you remember,

936
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:19,330
你脑内的植入设备
and it's the implants in your head

937
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:21,750
让你的大脑以为
that's tricking your brain into thinking

938
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,760
你真的听见声音了
that you're actually hearing,

939
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:28,800
但实际上你的听力并没有恢复
when in reality your ears aren't working still.

940
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:34,600
我建议你在接下来的几周里
So, I would suggest that you take it easy

941
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,650
放轻松
for the next few weeks and...

942
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,310
就是...
just...

943
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,190
适应一下你听到的声音
get adjusted to how things sound.

944
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:49,320
慢慢来
And just take your time.

945
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,400
哪位
Oui?

946
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,240
你好
Bonjour?

947
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,910
你好  那个...
Yeah. Hi. Is that...

948
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:56,530
露在家吗
Is... is Lou there?

949
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,200
什么  你是谁
Hein? C'est qui?

950
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,160
你是谁
Who... who is this?

951
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:03,620
我是鲁本
This is Ruben.

952
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:05,790
谁
Qui?

953
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,840
鲁本
It's Ruben.

954
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:33,990
你好
Bonjour...

955
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:36,450
-我是鲁本  -请进
- Ruben. - Come in.

956
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,040
你肚子饿了吧  鲁本
You are hungry, Ruben?

957
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:46,960
饿了吧
Yes?

958
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:01,850
露易丝不在
Louise is not here.

959
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,140
你能听见了吗
You are hearing?

960
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:07,970
你能听见了吗
Y-You are hearing?

961
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:10,440
能  我做了个手术
Yeah. I-I had an operation.

962
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:12,440
是吗
Yes?

963
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:18,950
这是什么  我瞧瞧
What is this? Wait.

964
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:23,410
这太好了  露易丝告诉我你想做这个手术
That's very good. Louise told me your wish for this.

965
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:31,090
那么
And so...

966
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:35,380
你又回去打鼓了吗
So, you're back to your drums now?

967
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:39,180
还没有  我得  我得
Not yet. I got to... I got to...

968
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,890
我得先处理一些事情
I got to deal with some stuff first, you know?

969
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:45,060
得把一些事情安排妥当
Just got to... got to settle some things.

970
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,770
好的  安排
Yes, settle...

971
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:48,270
安排什么
Like what?

972
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:49,770
就是
You know, just like...

973
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,730
重回以前的生活  还有一些钱的问题
just getting back into it and also some financial stuff.

974
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:55,780
-好的  -我得把一切都处理好
- Yes. - You know, I just got to figure it all out.

975
01:37:57,650 --> 01:37:58,490
好
Yes.

976
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:01,070
露易丝知道你来了吗
And Louise knows that you're here?

977
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:02,450
不  她不知道
No. No.

978
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,160
要给她个大惊喜  对吗
So, it's a big surprise, oui?

979
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:13,880
露易丝最近很忙
Well, Louise has been quite busy, you know?

980
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:19,430
我们要开个派对
We're doing a party, so...

981
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,390
她今晚会回来
she'll be back home tonight.

982
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,310
这是一定的
That's most certainly.

983
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:32,730
你要不要...我给你做点鸡蛋
You want... I'm going to make you some eggs.

984
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,060
不用  我不吃了
Oh, no, I'm good.

985
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:35,820
需要我帮忙吗
Do you need any help with any of this?

986
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,740
不  不用
No, no.

987
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,570
你得吃点鸡蛋
You need some eggs.

988
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:40,900
谢谢
Thanks.

989
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:45,830
鲁本  你是在哪里长大的
Where did you grow, Ruben?

990
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:48,280
我在哪里长大的
Where did I grow up?

991
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:51,000
-对  -很多地方
- Yes. - Like, all over.

992
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,330
德克萨斯州  加利福尼亚州
You know, Texas, California,

993
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,750
亚利桑那州  弗吉尼亚州
Arizona, Virginia.

994
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:57,500
很多地方
Yeah. All over.

995
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,380
为什么这么多地方
Why so many places?

996
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:02,470
因为...
It was... like...

997
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:05,260
我妈是军队护士
my mom was a nurse in the military.

998
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:08,890
所以她总是要跟着部队辗转
You know? So she kept moving around.

999
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:10,560
你的父亲也是吗
And your father, too?

1000
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,310
不是
No.

1001
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:12,770
我是说  我不知道
I mean, I don't know.

1002
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:14,650
我明白了
I see.

1003
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:20,870
我得坦诚告诉你
I must be honest, I...

1004
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:24,320
鲁本  这些年来  我并不总是
did not always have good feelings for you, Ruben,

1005
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,660
对你有好感
all these years.

1006
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,700
说实话我感觉像是
I confide it is like if one...

1007
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:35,000
被人偷走了宝贵的东西
had stolen something precious.

1008
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:37,460
你能明白吗
You understand?

1009
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:41,590
但我知道并不是你把露易丝从我身边抢走的
But I know it's not you that took Louise from me.

1010
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,680
是她的母亲
Her mother did that.

1011
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,640
她离开我的时候带走了露易丝
She took Louise when she left me.

1012
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:53,730
她自杀的时候又一次让她与我疏远
And she took her again when she killed herself.

1013
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:59,570
那时露易丝只能回家
And Louise must have come back home then,

1014
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,950
但她非常恨我
but she was hating me so much.

1015
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,660
我能怎么办
What could I do?

而你  你...
And you... you...

1017
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,450
你给了她一个逃离我的去处

这是好事
this is a good thing.

1020
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,760
你能明白吗  我当时不怎么喜欢你
Don't you see, I didn't like you much at the time,

1021
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,380
但如今我感谢你

这就是我想说的
I want to say to you that.

1023
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,470
总之
But anyhow,

1024
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:31,760

01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,270
这才是最重要的事
And that's the most important.

1027
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,690
不是吗
Isn't it?

1028
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:42,990
好
Okay.

1029

01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:37,920
能  清清楚楚
Yeah. Loud and clear.

1031

1032
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:42,500
天啊
Holy shit.

1033
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,550
瞧瞧你
Look at you, huh?

1034
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:48,130
-怎么了  -你看起来不一样了
- What? - You look different.

1035
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:53,220
你没挠自己
No scratching, huh?

1036
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:54,890
是啊
Oh, yeah.

1037
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,560
太好了
That's good.

1038
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,630
会感觉很奇怪吗
Does it feel weird?

1039
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,790
是的  看起来奇怪吗
Yeah. Does it look weird?

1040
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:21,840
不会
No.

1041
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:24,500
不奇怪  看起来很棒
No, it doesn't. It looks really neat.

1042
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,260
这太疯狂了
So crazy.

1043
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,260
你怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

1044
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,220
只是施了点魔法
Just worked some magic.

1045
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,270
我得和你说一下
I have to talk to you about it.

1046
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,390
我不得不卖了些东西
I had to just move some things around.

1047
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:42,690
露易丝  下来好吗
Louise, tu descends?

1048
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:48,650
理查德有没有告诉你今晚有个派对
Did Richard tell you about this party thing tonight?

1049
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:50,570
对了  他说过

好
Okay.

你有什么需要的吗
Do you need anything?

1055
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:01,080
没有  不用
No, I'm good.

1056
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,290
我就在楼下
I'll just be downstairs.

1057
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,940

你吃东西了吗

1062
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:16,320

我想许个愿

1065
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:15,090
我希望我的女儿和我一起唱一首歌

爸爸  不要

1067
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:18,890

1089
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,220
今晚的派对
That was... that was...

1090
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:27,760
挺棒的
pretty cool tonight.

1091
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:30,720
你唱得太好听了
You sounded fucking great.

1092
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,300
-得了吧  -怎么了
- Yeah, right. - What?

1093
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:33,890
别告诉我你唱的时候没动感情
You're telling me you weren't feeling it?

1094
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:35,480
-你当时很投入  -好吧
- You were in it. - Well, yeah, well, that's...

1095
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,520
毫无疑问  你那么唱歌好听极了
Straight up, you sounded amazing singing like that.

1096
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,230
那是我爸写的歌
It's my dad's stuff, but...

1097
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:41,980
你现在会说法语了
And you're speaking French now?

1098
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:42,860
老天  只会一点点
Oh, my God, barely.

1099
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,490
我都不知道你会说法语
I didn't know you could do that.

1100
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:46,690
我都快忘光了  不过
Well, I've mostly forgotten, but...

1101
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:49,200
开始慢慢捡起来了
it's coming back a little.

1102
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,120
我刚才还在想  你记得吗
Yeah, I was thinking, like, do you remember...

1103
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,660
记得这个地方吗
you remember this place at all?

1104
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:56,750
之前不记得  但是
I didn't, but...

1105
01:49:57,830 --> 01:49:59,790
我自己都不知道有些事情
so disconcerting the things that

1106
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:02,970
还在记忆中留存  挺让人困惑的
your memory holds onto without you knowing.

1107
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:05,340
我也不知道  我...
I don't know, my...

1108
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,800
我妈从没跟我说起过这个地方
my mom and I never really talked about this place.

1109
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,220
我脑中只有模糊的奇怪印象  但是
It was always some weird, dreamy idea, but...

1110
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:12,980
现在慢慢开始想起来了
I mean, now it's come back a little.

1111
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:14,100
好
Right.

1112
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:16,640
嗯
Yeah.

1113
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,730
我跟大家讲了我们吉普赛人式的生活
I told everyone about our little gypsy life together.

1114
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:23,730
我很怀念
I miss it.

1115
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:25,940
我们得重回那种生活
We got to get back into it.

1116
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:27,650
我们要回到那种生活
You know? We got to get back on it,

1117
01:50:27,650 --> 01:50:29,200
我们要找回那种
we got to get back in the fuckin'...

1118
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,570
那种状态  对吗
in the groove, huh?

1119
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:31,860
你说呢
Don't you think?

1120
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:34,120
我得把房车的事搞定
I got to go get the Airstream sorted.

1121
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,370
搞定什么
What do you mean "sorted"?

1122
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:37,950
就是  就是有一大堆事情要做
I just, I just got a shit ton of things to do.

1123
01:50:37,950 --> 01:50:40,240
-是吧  -嗯  是说巡演的事吗
- You know? - Right. Like, with the tour and stuff?

1124
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:41,620
-是啊  巡演什么的  -嗯
- Yeah, the fuckin' tour, everything. - Yeah.

1125
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:42,870
我们得重回以前的生活
Like, we just got to get back on it,

1126
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:43,630
一切都要继续
