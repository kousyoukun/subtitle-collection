1
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,262
I want to eat

2
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:28,607
and violent

3
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,283
:

4
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,662
let me get there

5
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,668
let me, let me

6
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,714
:

7
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,301
let me get there

8
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,931
:

9
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:46,722
Lulu!

10
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,951
Mmm.

11
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,036
Lou.

12
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,204
Stop.

13
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,371
Lou, it’s up time.

14
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,623
Mm-hmm.

15
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,129
Up time.

16
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,090
Huh?

17
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,217
-Yeah.
-Come on.

18
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,179
Come on, stop that.

19
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,389
We got to get right to it
for grizzle. Remember?

20
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,599
Okay.

21
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,478
Yo, I got some smoothie for you.

22
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,188
You’re gonna fuckin’ hate it.

23
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,273
But it’s healthy.

24
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,275
Want some?
I wouldn’t recommend it.

25
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,236
-It’s disgusting.
-Mm-mm.

26
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,289
Okay, poops.

27
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,332
Dance time.

28
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,900
:

29
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:32,870
for something

30
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,674
in our lives

31
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,928
-

32
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,558
Yes!

33
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:02,774
-

34
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,118
-No?
-

35
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,119
Nah? No?

36
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,329
Okay.

37
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,586
And I would do
anything for love

38
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,630
RUBEN:

39
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,007
What’s the thing that
he won’t do in that song?

40
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,675
What’s left for him to not do?

41
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,760
LOU:
Anal.

42
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,846
-

43
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,558
RUBEN: I used to imagine
Jeff Goldblum was my dad.

44
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,435
Saw him in The fucking Fly,
I was like,

45
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,103
"Yo, that must be what
my dad looks like."

46
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,564
Also explains a lot,
’cause the dude’s fucking weird.

47
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,857
But he looks like me, man.

48
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,525
-It’s true, yeah.
-Yeah!

49
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,194
You kind of look
like Jeff Goldblum.

50
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,112
RUBEN: Why is it okay to, like,
use a toothpick in public

51
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,031
but not floss?
Have you ever tried that?

52
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,325
-LOU: To floss my teeth in
public? No. -To floss in public.

53
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,452
Like, you’re just at the dinner
table, you just pull out some...

54
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,120
LOU: I used to imagine
my funeral a lot

55
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,331
when I was a kid...
at school in math.

56
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,832
RUBEN:
Fun!

57
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,542
LOU: I used to daydream
about my funeral.

58
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,461
Then I’d make myself cry!

59
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,755
Uh, yeah, I think
I’d get cremated.

60
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,756
What about you?

61
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,174
RUBEN:
Cremated...

62
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,926
or, like, just fed to the birds,
you know?

63
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,719
LOU:
Well, you know, now you can get

64
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,014
ashes put into tattoo ink.

65
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,058
-My face on your back.
-RUBEN: Your face?

66
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,810
LOU:
Where the clown is.

67
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,270
-RUBEN: What?
-LOU: Yeah.

68
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,523
RUBEN:

69
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,326
Yo, we don’t need to... we don’t
need to put ’em all out.

70
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,829
I know, but we just need
to fill ’em up a little bit.

71
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,372
-Okay.
-That’s good.

72
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,375
You want to put out...
put out some different ones?

73
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,502
Hmm?

74
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,296
That’s the face of a sale.

75
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,301
Okay, this one costs, uh,
50 bucks extra because...

76
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,886
-It’s an original artwork.
-I’m gonna spit on.

77
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,638
-A $50... Oh!
-Okay, a hundred bucks.

78
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,515
-That’s ten grand.
-

79
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,393
-Did you guys sound-check?
-No, not yet.

80
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,686
We’re going on at...

81
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,438
-5:00?
-Did Margaret sound-check yet?

82
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,023
Yo, you sound-checked yet?

83
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:06,940
No.

84
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,608
Not looking forward to it.

85
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,985
Terrified.

86
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,695
Half my shit is broken down.

87
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,991
-

88
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,212
-

89
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,930
:
Ah.

90
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,974
Ah.

91
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,356
:
Ah.

92
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,109
Ah.

93
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,867
It’s... it’s probably
a two out of ten

94
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,203
in terms of his hearing.
He can’t...

95
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,663
He’s having trouble
even communicating with me.

96
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,708
It-it’s...

97
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,199
I got to see a doctor?

98
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,618
He... he can see you now.

99
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,746
-What?
-He can see you right-right now.

100
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,165
-Now?
-Yes, I-I...

101
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,214
Hey, Lulu. Uh, sorry
I had to run out, baby.

102
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,132
I got to deal
with some shit, okay?

103
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,926
Don’t worry about anything,
okay?

104
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,933
WOMAN:
Mr. Stone?

105
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,229
Oh. Oh, yeah.

106
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,234
:
Ah.

107
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,823
:
Okay, how is that volume?

108
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,741
Is the volume loud enough?

109
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,784
Good.

110
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,202
Can you hear me?

111
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,413
: What?
-You can hear me okay?

112
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,206
-Volume-wise?
-I can hear you.

113
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

114
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,918
I’m gonna say these words.

115
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,088
I want you to repeat them
back to me.

116
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,882
I’m gonna start
with just your right ear.

117
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,593
Okay?

118
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,137
Bass.

119
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,016
Bass.

120
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,311
Mess.

121
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,897
Car.

122
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,234
Mop.

123
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,154
:
Noisy.

124
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,572
DOCTOR:
Search.

125
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,616
Throat.

126
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,035
-Ditch.
-Fish.

127
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,244
Talk.

128
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,662
T...

129
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,751
Ring.

130
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,586
Broom.

131
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,046
Germ.

132
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,801
DOCTOR:
Life.

133
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,556
Team.

134
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,270
Lid.

135
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,985
Lid.

136
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,823
This is your chart, Ruben.

137
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,452
Now, as far as the volume
that you can hear,

138
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:56,081
you, on your right ear,
were 28%,

139
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,875
and on your left ear,
you were 24%.

140
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,877
-It’s what?
-In the left ear,

141
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,128
you came in at 24%.

142
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,171
Okay.

143
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,132
No matter how loud
I made the test--

144
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,552
I could have put it at 11--
you were still going to miss

145
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,556
70% to 80% of the words
that I said.

146
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,683
Okay.

147
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,684
That is not good.

148
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,810
Yeah, I see that.

149
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,561
So, what...

150
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,979
What can we do about it?

151
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,272
How do I get it back?

152
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,649
Well, um...

153
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,069
you have to understand
something here.

154
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,822
Whether or not
this is related to

155
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,907
your exposure to noise

156
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,035
or it’s an autoimmune issue

157
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,704
doesn’t really matter.

158
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,414
I understand I got a problem.

159
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,541
I’m asking you
what I can do about it.

160
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,085
Well, what you can do
about it first

161
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,548
is to eliminate all exposure
to loud noises.

162
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,844
And then we can run some tests
and we can determine exactly

163
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,722
what is going on with your ears.

164
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,641
And if we do, then we can have
our other conversations.

165
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,226
We can have what?

166
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,939
Well, there are implants
that bypass the cochlea.

167
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,816
You said implants?

168
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,359
-Yes.
-Those work?

169
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,862
For people with
severe hearing loss or

170
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,114
complete deafness,
yes, they help.

171
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,949
Well, then let’s do that.

172
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,994
Well, it’s not that simple.

173
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,913
Uh, it’s a very involved
process, and it’s quite costly.

174
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,623
How much is it?

175
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,501
Well, they can run
between $40,000 and $80,000,

176
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,297
depending, and they are not
covered by insurance.

177
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,471
Okay.

178
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,972
And, um...

179
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,808
Like, when-when can you do it?

180
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,310
You got ’em in stock now?

181
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,520
Mr. Stone, your hearing

182
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,024
is deteriorating rapidly.

183
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,859
Am I right?

184
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,946
And over the next few days,

185
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,908
or even hours,
it’s going to continue.

186
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,952
And the hearing
that you have lost

187
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,288
is not coming back.

188
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,625
:
You have to understand

189
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,044
your first responsibility

190
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,880
is to preserve
the hearing you have.

191
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,837
-

192
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,215
-

193
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,376
-LOU: Ruben, what the fuck?

194
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,619
Yes, it’ll come back.

195
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,329
I have to...

196
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,873
There’s, like, a surgery.

197
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,542
What?

198
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,794
It’s simple. It’s all it is.
There’s an implant.

199
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,171
They put it in your shit.

200
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,714
It’s like a...

201
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,050
Okay, it’ll come back.

202
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,384
It’s fine, Lou.

203
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,219
It’s, like, 40 grand,
80 grand, whatever,

204
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,512
but it’s...

205
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,805
it’ll come back.

206
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,515
Till then, Lou,
we just keep going, okay?

207
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,268
-No. No.
-Lou. Listen to me.

208
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,770
Let’s play tomorrow,
let’s see what it’s like.

209
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:29,854
Let’s try it, okay?

210
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,230
I’m gonna be like a click track.

211
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,482
You can play to me.

212
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,900
-No.
-Huh? You can adj...

213
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,818
It’s different,
but it is what it is, Lou.

214
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:45,119
Lou, we have a t...
Lou, we have a tour booked.

215
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,747
-It’s not safe.
-We have a tour booked.

216
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,749
-We have a tour booked, Lou.
-No.

217
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,459
-It doesn’t matter.
It doesn’t matter. -Yes, we do.

218
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,628
-It’s not safe, it’s not safe.
-We have a tour booked!

219
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,007
-Ruben.
-I don’t fucking...

220
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,349
:
Yo!

221
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,226
You got a smoke, please?

222
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,049
This is ridiculous.

223
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,433
He’s sleeping.

224
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,392
Hi.

225
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,643
Hi, Hector?

226
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,186
Hi. This is Lou.

227
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,355
Ruben’s having a bit of...
a bit of trouble right now.

228
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,523
-He’s...
-Hey, Hector, what’s up?

229
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,483
He’s got some hearing problems.

230
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,528
Yeah, I mean, I can put him on,

231
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,530
but he won’t be able
to hear you.

232
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,907
Okay.

233
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,201
Talk to him. Talk to him.

234
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,623
Hey, Hector,
what’s going on, man?

235
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,875
It’s Ruben.

236
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,501
I’d say it’s good
to hear your voice,

237
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,587
but I can’t hear a fuckin’ word
you’re saying right now.

238
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,172
So this is completely pointless.

239
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,008
Lou wanted me to call you
because I had a cigarette.

240
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,678
Uh, you know,
not great, not ideal, but...

241
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:29,682
considering the circumstances,
which are pretty fucked up,

242
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,975
you know, understandable.

243
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,310
I’d say understandable,

244
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,270
for everyone apart from Lou,
it seems.

245
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,230
Um, I got this, bro.

246
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,858
I know you’d probably be asking
me if I’m steady right now,

247
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,777
if I’m feeling level.

248
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,529
Not completely, but I’m cool.

249
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,782
You’d tell me serenity
is something you get

250
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,702
when you, uh, stop wishing
for a different past.

251
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,204
Bro, I love you, man.

252
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,289
Oh, my manager wants the...
wants the phone back,

253
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,540
so I got to go.

254
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, love you, bro.

255
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,544
Hey.

256
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,713
Yeah, he-he can’t hear a word.

257
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,844
Well, if you get him to a group,
then how is he gonna hear?

258
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,182
Okay.

259
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,520
Okay, tha-thanks, Hector,
thank you.

260
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:17,980
When? When?

261
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,774
Okay, yeah,
I’ll make sure it’s on loud.

262
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,068
Okay, thank you so much.
Thank you.

263
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,154
Okay, bye.

264
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,788
He’s gonna call back.

265
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,249
What did he say?

266
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,917
Write it down.
Tell... What did he...

267
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,967
"Call back."

268
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,929
He’s gonna call back--
that’s all?

269
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,556
Fuckin’ Hector.

270
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,768
What are we gonna do now?

271
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,821
What do you want to do, Lou?

272
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,281
Huh?

273
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,677
RUBEN:
Fuck this.

274
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,769
It’s Hector.

275
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,984
Hey.

276
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,402
Yeah, he’s here.

277
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,531
Not so good.

278
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,996
Oh. Okay.

279
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,042
Uh, yeah, what-what...
what is it and...

280
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,835
What? What’s the plan?

281
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,129
Uh...

282
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:08,257
Well, we’re-we’re in Missouri,
so that’s gonna take a few days.

283
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,760
I don’t... I don’t really know.

284
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,972
No, no, no,
we’ll leave right away.

285
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,642
Okay, yeah.

286
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,101
Okay, thank you.

287
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,645
Thank you so much.
I really, really appreciate it.

288
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,271
Thank you.

289
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,440
No, yeah, I’ll tell him.

290
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,441
Okay.

291
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,068
Bye.

292
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,365
What?

293
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,287
He’s found a place.

294
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,993
RUBEN:
Is that him?

295
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,214
Ruben.

296
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,216
Hi. I don’t...
I’m sorry, I don’t know that.

297
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,884
I’m Ruben.

298
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,219
Yeah, this is Lou.

299
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,678
Hi. I’m... I’m Lou.

300
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,055
I’m sorry, I read lips.

301
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,181
M-My name is Lou.

302
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,059
-Lou. I’m Joe.
-Hi, Joe.

303
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,728
-You mind if I borrow him
for a minute? -No.

304
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,939
All right, you mind
watching my beast here for me

305
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,232
while we have a talk?

306
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,358
Well, okay.

307
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,527
-Lou, this is Louie.
-Oh.

308
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,861
He’s my hearing dog.

309
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,155
He let me know you were here.

310
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,990
I named it after Louie Aparicio

311
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,034
-from the White Sox in ’59.
-Okay.

312
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,661
You want to be
best friends with him,

313
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,204
-give him one of these.
-Oh, sure.

314
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,039
-Okay?
-Yeah.

315
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:30,751
RUBEN:
Yo, what about...

316
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,086
Lou, you coming?

317
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,170
No, no, you.

318
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,588
-You sure?
-Yeah.

319
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,882
-I won’t be long, okay?
-Okay.

320
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,636
JOE:
You be a good boy!

321
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,179
Okay. Uh...

322
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,930
Test.

323
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,558
Oh.

324
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,615
Okay.

325
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,576
So, it works.

326
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,329
Is this okay for you?

327
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,497
Yeah, can you hear me?

328
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,458
No.
No, I’m gonna read your lips.

329
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,543
I might miss some things,
but I’m gonna try, okay?

330
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,004
-Okay.
-Just try, try to speak clearly.

331
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,589
Yeah.

332
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,510
How are you, Ruben?

333
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,182
I’m okay.

334
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,104
You’re an addict?

335
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,191
Yeah.

336
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,028
What sort of drugs?

337
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,281
What’d I take?

338
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,575
Mm-hmm.

339
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,499
Um...

340
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,710
Mainly heroin.

341
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,170
Heroin.

342
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:43,342
Have you thought about using
since you lost your hearing?

343
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,984
Today is not a good day.

344
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,661
I’m not thinking clear today.

345
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,916
Let’s talk about me.

346
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,293
I’m an alcoholic.

347
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,421
I lost my hearing
in the Vietnam War

348
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,674
when a bomb exploded near me.

349
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,759
I still remember the music
I was listening to

350
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:26,969
when that bomb went off.

351
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,558
After that,
I lost everything else--

352
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,769
my wife, my kid.

353
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,980
Not because of being deaf,
mind you, Ruben.

354
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,356
It was the beer.

355
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,570
How long you been clean?

356
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,323
Four years.

357
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,825
-Four?
-Mmm.

358
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,494
And you need some help
right now?

359
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,706
Yo, I should check on Lou.

360
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,251
How long you two been together?

361
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,963
Four years.

362
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,342
-

363
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,905
You play music, right?

364
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,323
-No.
-No?

365
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,532
No, not anymore.

366
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,284
Not until I get the implant.

367
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,536
-Implant?
-Yeah.

368
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,039
Sorry, you know about
these implants they got now?

369
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,375
It’s like... it’s like, uh...
th-they have implants.

370
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,419
I know. Yes.

371
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:43,504
Expensive.

372
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,757
Yeah. Thank you.
Yes, they are.

373
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,258
So...

374
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,012
You should understand that, uh,

375
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,389
this is a Deaf community.

376
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,849
Not just my program,
but we’re part

377
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,935
of a larger Deaf community.

378
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,814
And my program,
and the people in it,

379
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,275
they benefit tremendously
from that Deaf community.

380
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,944
We work with them,

381
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,445
and they work with us.

382
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,448
But it’s very important,

383
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,950
if you want to be here,

384
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,451
to understand
that we’re looking for

385
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,245
a solution to...

386
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,122
to this...

387
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,290
...not this.

388
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,130
Why don’t you go
invite Lou in here?

389
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,427
Sure.

390
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,806
Lou!

391
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,857
This guy wants to talk to you.

392
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,775
Okay.

393
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,114
Well... I think it’s important

394
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,658
that you stay here
with us right now, Ruben,

395
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,410
learn some sign language,

396
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,412
find some solid ground.

397
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,956
What do you think?

398
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,458
Man, it sounds great,

399
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,209
but we don’t have
a lot of money right now.

400
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,879
JOE: Well, sometimes our church
sponsors deaf people in need,

401
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,714
and right now,

402
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,507
you fit the bill, Ruben.

403
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,925
Uh, we’re really not

404
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,510
-churchgoing people.
-Sorry, I-I read...

405
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,095
Sorry, Ruben, I read lips.
I can’t...

406
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,472
What’d you say?

407
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,975
We’re not religious,
either of us.

408
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,393
Very much not into religion.

409
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:22,811
No offense, you know.

410
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,105
Religion plays no part
in this, Ruben.

411
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:26,648
The church helps

412
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,692
people in need,
not religious people.

413
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:31,069
The important thing is that
you want to stay here.

414
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,529
Mmm.

415
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,655
Yeah.

416
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,907
Lou?

417
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,493
Do you think Ruben
needs help right now?

418
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,415
You understand, if, uh...

419
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,125
Ruben were to stay here,

420
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,960
he’d have to do it on his own.

421
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,631
Members live in a house
separate from the outside world.

422
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,090
No contact to the outside world,

423
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,134
no phones.

424
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:57,387
I’ve found that in all cases,
that’s the way it works best.

425
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,097
Yo, hold up a minute, okay?

426
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,350
Let me catch up. Okay?

427
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,228
Can you help Ruben commit
to that, Lou?

428
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,689
You want... you want to
try this for a couple days?

429
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:08,607
We have our own home.

430
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,526
We can stay in the RV.

431
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,236
No, I’m sorry to say,
that’s not the way

432
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,153
that it works here, Ruben.

433
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,197
Well, that’s a problem, then.

434
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,033
Do you have anywhere you can be
during this time, Lou?

435
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,538
Yo, that’s that, man.
We’re done.

436
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,580
We’re done.

437
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:24,706
Thanks a lot for your time, bro.

438
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,874
Appreciate it, okay?

439
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,334
We’re out, baby. Let’s go.

440
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,865
Hey.

441
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,660
I’m thinking
we should still go hit

442
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,161
our fuckin’ show in Dayton.

443
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,372
Okay? I can... I can
fuckin’ watch you for cues.

444
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,499
I know it was rocky last time,
but we did...

445
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,959
we weren’t on the same page.

446
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,961
Now you know what’s up,
I can fuckin’ watch you.

447
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,005
And I know this shit inside out.

448
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,631
Okay, yo.
I can fuckin’ make it work

449
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,968
until we have enough
for surgery.

450
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:18,886
Okay?

451
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,013
We’re gonna get there.

452
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,432
Yo, seriously, we’re good to go.

453
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,975
Lou.

454
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,060
Hmm?

455
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,062
Hey, I’ll deal with this shit.

456
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,147
I’ll deal with it.

457
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,940
You know I fucking will.
It’s just money.

458
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,859
You know that, right? Huh?

459
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,196
Come here.

460
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,923
Ruben!

461
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,636
Ruben! Ruben!

462
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,179
Stop it!

463
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,062
Ruben!

464
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,738
-

465
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,620
Lou, look at me.
I’m not going back

466
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,580
to that fuckin’ place, okay?

467
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,000
I know. I know.

468
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,001
I’m...

469
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,299
Well, then fuckin’ support me.

470
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,344
How’s about that?
Fuckin’ support me, Lou.

471
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,262
Huh?

472
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:46,974
You don’t want to be here?

473
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,685
-Of course I do.
-I knew it.

474
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,812
I fuckin’ knew it.
I fuckin’ knew this was coming.

475
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,146
I fuckin’ knew it.

476
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,523
This is about
the fuckin’ album, huh?

477
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,525
What happened?
You get a better offer?

478
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,859
-What are you talking about?
-Huh?

479
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,152
-What are you saying?
-I can’t hear...

480
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,029
I can’t hear you.
I can’t fucking hear you!

481
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,657
Do you understand me?
I can’t. I’m fuckin’ deaf.

482
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,616
I’m fucking deaf!

483
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,534
No fucking hearing!

484
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,203
Okay? Okay?

485
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,168
No, what I need... what I need
is a fucking gun in my mouth.

486
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,629
What I need is a fucking gun
in my fucking mouth!

487
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:18,714
Okay?!

488
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,262
Look, I’m sorry.

489
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,805
Lou, I’m just fucked up
a little.

490
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,057
I just need a little...
I need a minute to think.

491
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,142
Okay?

492
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,312
There’s got to be another way.

493
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:35,188
Lou?

494
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,068
Hello?

495
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,737
Hey.

496
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:44,865
Oh, really?

497
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,451
Oh.

498
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,785
Who is that?

499
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,412
Okay, well, I need to get ready.

500
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,956
Okay. No, I’ll get a cab.

501
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,208
Yeah, it’s fine.

502
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,627
Okay, bye.

503
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,130
What’s going on?

504
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,131
Huh?

505
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,175
What’s going on?

506
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,509
I’m getting on a plane,

507
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,095
and you’re gonna go back
to that place.

508
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,186
Just slow down, okay?
Slow down.

509
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,021
Yo, chill, dude.
We’re gonna be a minute.

510
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,440
Just chill. Okay?

511
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,525
Just slow down a minute.

512
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,319
Lou. Lou.

513
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,779
This is so fucked up.

514
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,697
Who’s gonna be looking out
for you over there? Hmm?

515
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,324
-Who’s gonna look out for you?
-It’s okay.

516
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,825
-Don’t say that guy.
-It’s okay. It’s okay.

517
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,744
Lou, I need...
I need more of a plan, Lou.

518
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,870
-Ruben.
-I need...

519
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,914
I need more from you, Lou.

520
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,216
I need more of a plan, Lou.

521
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,218
You can’t just fuckin’...

522
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,522
Ah, Jesus. Lou, come on.

523
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,774
Ruben. Ruben.

524
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,318
You hurt yourself...

525
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,612
Ruben, you hurt yourself,

526
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,988
you hurt me.

527
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,699
I’ll hurt myself, too.
I’ll hurt myself, too.

528
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,743
Don’t say that.

529
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,203
Promise.

530
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,497
Say it, Rubi,
or all of this is for shit.

531
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,623
Say it! Promise!

532
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,999
Go back there right now.

533
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,417
Promise, say it!

534
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,379
-I’ll promise if you...
-No, say it, promise.

535
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,259
Go back to that place.

536
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,594
I... only if... I need...

537
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,721
I need you to wait for me.

538
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,099
Okay? You’re it for me, Lou.
You’re my fuckin’ heart.

539
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,517
You’re it for me.

540
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,270
Okay? You got to wait for me.

541
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,612
Fuck.

542
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:51,867
Listen to me. Listen, listen.

543
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,953
When you get there,
I need you to...

544
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,247
I need you to write to me, okay?

545
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,792
Yeah? Will you write me
and tell me you’re okay?

546
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,169
Huh? Promise me?

547
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,587
And listen, if it’s...

548
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,755
if it’s bullshit,
you just get your ass back here.

549
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,257
I’ll fix it, I swear to God.

550
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,508
You know I’ll fuckin’ fix this.

551
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,343
This is not that hard, okay?

552
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,304
Just come back here.

553
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,475
-I love you.
-You’re my fucking heart.

554
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,810
Okay?

555
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,731
Motherfucker.

556
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,900
-Oh, motherf...
-

557
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,452
-Fuck.
-

558
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,665
:
Motherfucker.

559
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,548
Oh.

560
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,139
Fuck.

561
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,017
Motherfucker.

562
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,490
RUBEN:
What’s up?

563
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,201
Yo.

564
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,619
Hey.

565
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:28,982
You want my car keys?

566
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:43,204
If I ask for ’em back,
I want ’em back, okay?

567
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,543
We’re not doing that.

568
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,036
Your name.

569
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:07,664
My name’s Ruben.

570
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,374
I’m an addict.

571
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,751
I have four years clean now.

572
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:13,294
I’m sorry I don’t...

573
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,629
talk sign language.

574
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,131
That’s it.

575
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:27,475
My name is Shaheem.

576
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,478
I’m a heroin addict.

577
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,773
Oh...

578
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,399
:
Fuck.

579
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,539
What?

580
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,502
Okay.

581
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,146
:
I know, right?

582
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,130
Um, I don’t...

583
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,048
Sorry.

584
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:31,988
Ruben.

585
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,073
Ruben.

586
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,277
Oh.

587
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,546
Okay.

588
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,595
Yeah.

589
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:16,509
-

590
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,976
-

591
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,526
Uh, I’m coming.

592
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,486
Okay? One minute.

593
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,737
I-I’ll... I’ll be back.

594
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,315
Fuck.

595
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,055
Oh, hey, Joe.

596
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,437
What was that all about, Ruben?

597
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,068
Oh, with your roof?

598
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,444
I was fixing your roof.

599
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:41,946
It’s, like,
one of the eaves is...

600
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,115
:
I was trying to fix your roof.

601
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,118
You don’t need to fix
anything here.

602
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,214
I’ve got a little, uh...

603
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,466
assignment for you. Okay?

604
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,803
You get up early, right?

605
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,680
Yeah, pretty early, yeah.

606
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,850
I’ll have hot coffee

607
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,351
waiting for you

608
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,186
at 5:30.

609
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,522
Early enough for you?

610
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,485
I don’t know. I guess.

611
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,654
Okay, 5:00.

612
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,656
And I’ll, uh,

613
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,742
provide a room for you.

614
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,577
What for?

615
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,580
And there’s nothing that needs
to be accomplished in this room.

616
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,499
All I want you to do is just...

617
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,419
...sit.

618
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:45,134
All I ask is if and when
you cannot just sit,

619
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,511
you turn yourself
to the pen and paper

620
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:49,930
that I’m going to supply
for you.

621
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,099
And I want you to...

622
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,935
...write.

623
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,189
Doesn’t matter what you write,
how you write,

624
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,357
whether it’s spelled correctly.

625
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,610
Or if it’s just a big...

626
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,403
...mess.

627
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,280
I don’t care.

628
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,908
No one will read it, okay?

629
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,993
But I want you to keep writing

630
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:12,912
continuously without stopping

631
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,790
until you feel like you can...

632
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,086
...sit again.

633
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,520
-Does it have to be writing?
-Writing, yes.

634
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,397
No drawing. Writing, yes.

635
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:47,613
And if...
sometime in the future,

636
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,908
it feels like it’s a little bit
too difficult for you,

637
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,953
you should come and find me.

638
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,330
I’ll be in my apartment

639
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,625
doing the same thing as you,
okay, Ruben?

640
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:06,757
I’ll be writing, too.

641
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,220
Okay.

642
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,283
-

643
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,751
Mmm, nice.

644
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,795
-Nice, nice, nice.
-

645
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,005
So fucking stupid.

646
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,765
:
It’s so fucking stupid.

647
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,271
You fucking idiot.

648
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:40,744
What a fucking idiot.

649
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,004
Hey.

650
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,424
You think he’s okay?

651
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:44,595
You okay?

652
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,305
-No.
-Not feeling better?

653
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,723
Come on over.

654
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:51,226
Look at those flowers.

655
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,030
He’s quick.

656
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,253
All right, come here, my friend.

657
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,965
See, I knew he had it.

658
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,283
A, B, C,

659
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,660
D, E, F,

660
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:50,869
G, H, I, J,

661
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,080
K, L, M, N--

662
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,414
R, S, T,

663
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:55,415
U, V, W,

664
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:56,959
X, Y, Z.

665
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:02,756
He won.

666
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,883
-No, no, he won.
-It was close.

667
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:06,635
No, he won. You can go again
if you want to.

668
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:08,762
Again! Again! Again! Again!

669
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,060
A, B, C, D,

670
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,186
G, H, I,

671
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,354
J, K, L,

672
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,773
T, U, V, O, Q--

673
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,941
R, S, T,

674
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,150
U, V, W,

675
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,735
X, Y, Z.

676
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:24,945
Yes!

677
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:28,824
See?

678
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:30,576
Good job! You did it!

679
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:18,999
No, I thought...

680
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,419
I thought you said
you were smart.

681
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,087
But your wife and your daughter

682
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:26,381
are better, right?

683
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,675
See? He knows!

684
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:33,930
-He already knows.
-

685
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:45,692
I don’t like it
completely shaved.

686
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:48,028
I prefer it with a little hair.

687
01:05:58,497 --> 01:06:00,749
Whoa, not too much.

688
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:01,792
Natural, got it.

689
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,627
Trimmed and all, ya know?

690
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,508
Lovely.

691
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:10,759
Who is she?

692
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:16,890
Okay, okay.

693
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,354
Where do you want it?

694
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:27,442
-Right here.
-

695
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:34,282
I like it.

696
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:46,962
Cool. Thank you.

697
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:06,857
My bad.

698
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:09,443
Watch me.

699
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,404
Slowly.

700
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:30,148
I feel a little bit old today.

701
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:34,027
You are old.

702
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:37,864
I love your name sign...

703
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:39,115
Ruben.

704
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,246
That first day you were here,

705
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,123
you reminded me of an owl.

706
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,711
-O-W-L?
-Owl.

707
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:52,921
Fuck you.

708
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,599
And you’ve become very important

709
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:07,060
to a lot of people around here.

710
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,772
You know? It’s true.

711
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:12,607
Thank you.

712
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:16,820
I’d like to offer you a...

713
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,113
a way that

714
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,575
maybe you can continue on here
with us.

715
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,077
I imagine you’re starting
to think

716
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,746
about the future a little bit?

717
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,082
-Future?
-Future.

718
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,459
I know I am.

719
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:36,172
But, uh... I do think
there’s a way

720
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:39,217
you could maybe stay
and work here,

721
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,137
uh, maybe with my program,

722
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,889
maybe...

723
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,432
with the kids at school.

724
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,768
Maybe both.

725
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,107
Anyway...

726
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,484
...you, uh...

727
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,278
you think about it, you know?

728
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,485
What the fuck?

729
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:24,966
-

730
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,168
Her?

731
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,086
Yeah.

732
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,051
Yeah.

733
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,261
Cute.

734
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,722
What do you think, huh?

735
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:36,973
Yo, what do you think?

736
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,808
This?

737
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,351
All?

738
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:42,729
Yeah.

739
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:44,814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

740
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,274
Wait, yo, it’s easy.

741
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,234
It’s easy. Just... slowly.

742
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,237
Yo. It’s for her, huh?

743
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:52,322
It’s for her.

744
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,616
We need money. We need money.

745
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,452
Huh? It’s for us.

746
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,497
I’m leveling with you.

747
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,124
It’s for her.

748
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:22,602
Yo.

749
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:24,020
For-for this?

750
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,105
For this, remember it’s, uh...

751
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,482
it’s, uh... cash.

752
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:28,775
Okay? Not check.

753
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:29,776
Cool.

754
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,069
Yo.

755
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,570
You okay?

756
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:34,030
Sure?

757
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,537
Hi. Is that Prince Audiology?

758
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,289
Can you hear me?

759
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,211
It’s Stone, Ruben Stone.

760
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,630
R-U-B-E-N,

761
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,216
Stone, S-T-O-N-E.

762
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,802
I’m confirming an appointment.

763
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:26,392
Yeah, I can hold.

764
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,521
So, listen.

765
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,314
-What did you say?
Write it down. -Yeah, yeah.

766
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,650
I can’t hear you.
Write it down.

767
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:20,798
I got a proposition for you.

768
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:22,467
What’s that?

769
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,635
What if I give it to you
at this price...

770
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,266
...but on one condition?

771
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,811
I have the option
of coming back to you

772
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:35,980
within eight weeks.

773
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:38,774
Okay?
I get to buy it back off you

774
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,610
-for ten percent more than this.
-

775
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,653
But everything has to be
in its current condition.

776
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:46,365
Everything has to be
exactly like it is now.

777
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:47,700
Hmm?

778
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,494
What do you think?

779
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:51,204
:
Why would you want to do that?

780
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,747
Dude, I can’t hear you.
I’m deaf.

781
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,665
So it’s... take it or leave it.

782
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:56,918
What’s it gonna be?

783
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,985
-

784
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:11,636
You’re back?

785
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:16,349
Have a seat here.

786
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,517
Thank you.

787
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:30,154
Um...

788
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,907
...I did the deed.

789
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:36,160
The deed?

790
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:41,832
Surgery.

791
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:53,177
How’d you get the money?

792
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:56,514
I sold my RV and other shit.

793
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,726
-Okay.
-Look, Joe,

794
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:04,313
I really don’t want to
explain myself right now.

795
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:05,731
Okay?

796
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:08,609
It’s time. Okay?

797
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:11,737
It’s time.
I got to do something.

798
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,114
Right?

799
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:15,616
Trying to save
my f-fuckin’ life.

800
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:19,078
So, that’s what I’m doing.

801
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,789
Okay? No one else is
gonna save my life.

802
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:23,624
Right?

803
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,292
If I just sit here
and diddle around,

804
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:28,212
what am I gonna have?
Nothing.

805
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:29,505
Okay?

806
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:30,965
And all this shit?

807
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,717
Like, what does it matter?
What does it matter?

808
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,218
It just passes.

809
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,219
Yo.

810
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:36,804
If I disappear,

811
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:38,472
like, who cares?

812
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:40,224
Nobody cares, man.

813
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,267
Seriously.

814
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,393
Yo, and that’s okay.

815
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,644
That’s life.

816
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:45,813
That’s life.

817
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:48,023
No, for real. Okay?

818
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:49,400
It just passes.

819
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,652
It just fucking...
fucking passes.

820
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,284
I wonder, uh...

821
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:01,787
all these mornings
you’ve been sitting in my study,

822
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:04,790
sitting,

823
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:06,584
have you...

824
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,586
had any...

825
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,421
moments of...

826
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:12,506
stillness?

827
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:19,138
Because you’re right, Ruben.

828
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,639
The world does keep moving,

829
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:22,683
and it can be a damn...

830
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:24,477
cruel place.

831
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,521
But for me...

832
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,027
...those moments of stillness,

833
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:35,446
that place, that’s the...

834
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,198
kingdom of God.

835
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:43,496
And that place

836
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:45,247
will never abandon you.

837
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,002
But...

838
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,800
I see you’ve made your choice.

839
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:56,967
Right?

840
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,262
Yeah.

841
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:04,433
And I sincerely hope

842
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:07,311
that it brings you happiness,
Ruben.

843
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,525
Thank you.

844
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:21,200
I was wondering, Joe.
I don’t know if it’s possible...

845
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:26,580
...but, uh, I need money

846
01:25:26,664 --> 01:25:29,959
to... just to buy back my RV.

847
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,210
You know?

848
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,003
You know, me... me and Lou.

849
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:34,713
This is where we live.

850
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:38,008
It’s our home. Our home.

851
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:40,761
And I can...
I can totally pay you back.

852
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:42,012
Just, uh...

853
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:44,348
Now I got an issue with time.

854
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:53,148
Ruben.

855
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:59,154
I don’t understand the situation
that you’ve put yourself in,

856
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,698
but...

857
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,658
from where I’m sitting...

858
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:05,828
you look and sound
like an addict.

859
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,497
No, I don’t. Yo, no.

860
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:10,249
I’m not... It’s not...

861
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:12,167
Not an addi...

862
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:13,752
It’s fine. Okay?

863
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:16,755
My situation, it’s cool. Okay?

864
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:19,717
Seriously,
my girlfriend’s dad is rich,

865
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,468
he can give me...
give me the money.

866
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:22,928
Okay? This is nothing.

867
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:25,472
You can’t imagine
how nothing this is.

868
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:27,182
Seriously.

869
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:32,104
I’m fucking stupid.
I’m-I’m sorry to ask.

870
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,440
I’m sorry. Okay?

871
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:37,443
Okay.

872
01:26:43,449 --> 01:26:47,036
Please, can I stay here
for just...

873
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,913
three, four weeks?

874
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:50,581
Till they...

875
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,458
activate?

876
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:01,216
Ruben.

877
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,261
As you know, everybody here

878
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,055
shares in the belief that

879
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,349
being deaf is not a handicap.

880
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:11,060
Not something to fix.

881
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,772
It’s pretty important
around here.

882
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:20,194
All these kids...

883
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:22,363
all of us,

884
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:25,115
need to be reminded of it

885
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,784
every day.

886
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:33,165
And my house is a house
built on that belief,

887
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,376
and built on trust.

888
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:40,130
And when that trust is violated,

889
01:27:40,214 --> 01:27:42,299
things happen.

890
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:51,058
And I can’t have that.

891
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:54,228
There are too many others

892
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:56,438
to consider.

893
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:00,234
And so,

894
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:03,529
in your current state,
at this time...

895
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:09,743
I’m going to have to ask you
to pack up your bags today

896
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:12,579
and find another place to be,
Ruben.

897
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,053
Cool.

898
01:31:33,197 --> 01:31:34,907
Are you ready?

899
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,368
Okay.

900
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:49,296
Here we go.

901
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,430
-

902
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,184
:
Can you hear me?

903
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:09,107
:
Say again.

904
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:11,068
: Can you hear me?
-Whoa.

905
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:14,321
How does it sound?

906
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,533
Uh, sounds weird.

907
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:23,872
Okay, well, let’s try
making an adjustment.

908
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,796
:
How about now? How’s that?

909
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:32,589
Oh, that’s bad.

910
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:34,675
Um...

911
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:38,553
It’s bad.

912
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:42,557
: Do you want to
describe what you’re hearing?

913
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:44,935
It’s, um...

914
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:47,646
It’s, like, high.

915
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:48,939
High.

916
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,525
Um...

917
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:55,696
Um...

918
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,031
:
Can you change the...

919
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:03,161
Well, I can try and make
another adjustment.

920
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:09,209
:
How’s that?

921
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,131
Okay.

922
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:17,009
: Ruben, this is
not sound like you remember,

923
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,303
and it’s the implants
in your head

924
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:21,471
that’s tricking your brain
into thinking

925
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:25,892
that you’re actually hearing,
when in reality

926
01:33:25,976 --> 01:33:28,186
your ears aren’t working still.

927
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,693
So, uh, I would suggest
that you take it easy

928
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:37,279
for the next few weeks and...

929
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:39,197
just...

930
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:42,784
get adjusted
to how things sound.

931
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:49,666
And just take your time.

932
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,077
-

933
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,162
:
Oui?

934
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:51,872
Bonjour?

935
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:54,833
:
Yeah. Hi. Is that, um...

936
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:57,586
Is... is Lou there?

937
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:59,421
Hein? C’est qui?

938
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:01,381
Who... who is this?

939
01:36:02,716 --> 01:36:04,134
This is Ruben.

940
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:06,470
:
Qui?

941
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:08,472
It’s Ruben.

942
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:12,392
-Oh.
-Hmm.

943
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:31,661
Hey.

944
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:34,581
Bonjour, uh...

945
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,875
-Ruben.
-Come in.

946
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:43,548
You are hungry, Ruben?

947
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,594
RICHARD:
Yes?

948
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,525
Uh, Louise is not here.

949
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:06,196
Uh, you are hearing?

950
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:07,864
Y-You are hearing?

951
01:37:07,948 --> 01:37:10,992
Yeah. I-I had an operation.

952
01:37:11,076 --> 01:37:12,744
Wow. Yes?

953
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:19,543
Oh. What is this? Wait.

954
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:20,835
Oh, that’s very good.

955
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:23,338
Louise told me
your wish for this.

956
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:27,467
Oh.

957
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:31,846
And so, uh...

958
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:35,141
So, you’re back
to your drums now?

959
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:37,686
Uh... not yet.

960
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,437
I got to... I got to, um...

961
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:41,856
I got to deal with
some stuff first, you know?

962
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,235
Just got to...
got to settle some things.

963
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,153
Yes, settle...

964
01:37:47,237 --> 01:37:48,530
Like what?

965
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,615
You know, just like...

966
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:53,451
just getting back into it
and also some financial stuff.

967
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:55,620
-Yes. -You know, I just
got to figure it all out.

968
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:56,580
Mm-hmm.

969
01:37:57,831 --> 01:37:59,332
Yes.

970
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:01,001
And Louise knows
that you’re here?

971
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,169
No. No.

972
01:38:03,253 --> 01:38:04,629
So, it’s a big surprise, oui?

973
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:13,471
Well, Louise has been
quite busy, you know?

974
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:16,308
Mm-hmm.

975
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:19,477
We’re doing a party, so...

976
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:21,354
she’ll be back home tonight.

977
01:38:21,438 --> 01:38:23,523
That’s most certainly.

978
01:38:28,987 --> 01:38:30,447
Oh, you want...

979
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,699
I’m going to make you some eggs.

980
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:33,908
Oh, no, I’m good.

981
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:35,869
Do you need any help
with any of this?

982
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:37,037
No, no.

983
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,622
You need some eggs.

984
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,541
Thanks.

985
01:38:43,627 --> 01:38:45,879
Where did you grow, Ruben?

986
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,131
Where did I grow up?

987
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,925
-Yes.
-Um... like, all over.

988
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:53,887
You know, Texas, California,

989
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,388
Arizona, Virginia.

990
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:57,390
Yeah. All over.

991
01:38:57,474 --> 01:38:59,559
Why so many places?

992
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,687
It was... like, uh...

993
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,939
my mom was a nurse
in the military.

994
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,775
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

995
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,943
So she kept moving around.

996
01:39:09,027 --> 01:39:10,445
And your father, too?

997
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:11,446
No.

998
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:13,615
I mean, I don’t know.

999
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:15,158
I see.

1000
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:21,122
Uh, I must be honest, I...

1001
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:24,334
did not always have
good feelings for you, Ruben,

1002
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,878
all these years.

1003
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:29,964
I confide it is like if one...

1004
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:34,969
...had stolen something
precious.

1005
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:38,056
You understand?

1006
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:40,141
But I know it’s not you
that took

1007
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:42,018
Louise from me.

1008
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:44,854
Her mother did that.

1009
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:49,901
She took Louise
when she left me.

1010
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,903
And she took her again

1011
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,155
when she killed herself.

1012
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:59,703
And Louise must have
come back home then,

1013
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:02,414
but she was hating me so much.

1014
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:04,708
What could I do?

1015
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:06,960
And you... you...

1016
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,423
Well, y-you gave her
a place to go.

1017
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:14,592
Then, and...

1018
01:40:14,676 --> 01:40:16,678
this is a good thing.

1019
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:20,515
Don’t you see, I didn’t like you
much at the time,

1020
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:22,392
but now I thank you.

1021
01:40:22,475 --> 01:40:24,227
I want to say to you that.

1022
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:28,398
But anyhow,

1023
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:31,526
you’re gonna be so happy
to see how Louise

1024
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:34,070
is going great now.

1025
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:35,947
And that’s the most important.

1026
01:40:37,866 --> 01:40:39,409
Isn’t it?

1027
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:41,828
Hmm?

1028
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:43,747
Okay.

1029
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:28,792
Whoa.

1030
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,420
:
Whoa.

1031
01:41:32,504 --> 01:41:34,297
Hi.

1032
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:36,257
Can you hear me?

1033
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:38,343
Yeah. Loud and clear.

1034
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:41,054
Oh, look at you, Lulu.

1035
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:43,181
Holy shit.

1036
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:45,600
Look at you, huh?

1037
01:41:45,683 --> 01:41:47,393
-What?
-You look different.

1038
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:53,483
Whoa, no scratching, huh?

1039
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:56,319
Oh, yeah.

1040
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:58,154
That’s good.

1041
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,092
Does it feel weird?

1042
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,802
Yeah. Does it look weird?

1043
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:22,345
-No.
-

1044
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:25,181
No, it doesn’t.
It looks really neat.

1045
01:42:25,265 --> 01:42:26,933
Mmm.

1046
01:42:27,767 --> 01:42:29,978
-So crazy.
-Mm-hmm.

1047
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:32,522
How’d you do it?

1048
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:34,649
Just worked some magic.

1049
01:42:36,693 --> 01:42:39,153
I have to talk to you about it.

1050
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:41,698
I had to just move
some things around.

1051
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:44,367
RICHARD:
Louise, tu descends?

1052
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,160
Um...

1053
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:49,330
Did Richard tell you
about this party thing tonight?

1054
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:50,748
Oh, shit, yeah.

1055
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,542
Yeah, I just have to go
and sort some things out.

1056
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,168
-No, it’s great. It’s cool.
-Yeah.

1057
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:56,462
Go do your thing.

1058
01:42:56,546 --> 01:42:58,047
Okay.

1059
01:42:58,131 --> 01:42:59,591
Do you need anything?

1060
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,885
No, I’m good.

1061
01:43:01,968 --> 01:43:04,095
I’ll just be downstairs.

1062
01:44:01,486 --> 01:44:02,820
Hey. What’s up?

1063
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:06,157
:
Ruben, mon petite ami.

1064
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,117
What’s up?

1065
01:44:08,201 --> 01:44:10,620
-Come again?
-How are you?

1066
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:12,330
How are you?

1067
01:44:13,748 --> 01:44:14,999
Did you get some food?

1068
01:44:15,083 --> 01:44:17,251
-Hmm?
-Get some food?

1069
01:44:17,335 --> 01:44:19,420
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1070
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:10,638
:
I would like to make a wish.

1071
01:45:10,722 --> 01:45:14,767
I would like my daughter
to sing a little song with me.

1072
01:45:14,851 --> 01:45:16,185
Papa, no.

1073
01:45:16,269 --> 01:45:19,689
This is my right...
It’s my birthday!

1074
01:45:19,772 --> 01:45:20,898
Come.

1075
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:23,234
-Oh!
-

1076
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,486
Some of you knew

1077
01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:27,405
Louise’s mother,

1078
01:45:27,488 --> 01:45:29,866
and know that I wrote songs
for her.

1079
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:31,367
Many.

1080
01:45:31,451 --> 01:45:34,912
And this was your favorite
when you were little.

1081
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:36,914
Do you remember?

1082
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:27,001
Hey.

1083
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:31,172
You okay?

1084
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:32,965
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

1085
01:49:06,332 --> 01:49:08,459
I just need some water.

1086
01:49:12,964 --> 01:49:15,216
-Are you okay?

1087
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:16,968
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

1088
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:18,678
Yeah, it’s just
a little dry in here.

1089
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:26,435
Hey, that was... that was, uh...

1090
01:49:26,519 --> 01:49:28,813
pretty cool tonight.

1091
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:30,815
You sounded fucking great.

1092
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:32,233
-Yeah, right.
-What?

1093
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:34,026
You’re telling me
you weren’t feeling it?

1094
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:35,736
-You were in it.
-Well, yeah, well, that’s...

1095
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,822
Straight up, you sounded amazing
singing like that.

1096
01:49:37,905 --> 01:49:40,741
It’s my dad’s stuff, but...

1097
01:49:40,825 --> 01:49:42,702
-And you’re speaking French now?
-Oh, my God, barely.

1098
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:44,870
I didn’t know you could do that.

1099
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:46,872
Well, I’ve mostly forgotten,
but...

1100
01:49:46,956 --> 01:49:49,917
it’s coming back a little.

1101
01:49:50,001 --> 01:49:52,003
Yeah, I was thinking,
like, do you remember...

1102
01:49:52,086 --> 01:49:53,796
you remember this place at all?

1103
01:49:55,381 --> 01:49:57,633
I didn’t, but...

1104
01:49:57,717 --> 01:49:59,760
so disconcerting the things that

1105
01:49:59,844 --> 01:50:04,098
your memory holds onto
without you knowing.

1106
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:05,474
I don’t know, my...

1107
01:50:05,558 --> 01:50:06,976
my mom and I never really
talked about this place.

1108
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:09,812
It was always some weird,
dreamy idea, but...

1109
01:50:09,895 --> 01:50:11,314
-I mean,

1110
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:12,982
now it’s come back a little.

1111
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:15,818
Right.

1112
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:18,112
Yeah.

1113
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:22,533
I told everyone about
our little gypsy life together.

1114
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,452
I miss it.

1115
01:50:24,535 --> 01:50:26,078
We got to get back into it.

1116
01:50:26,162 --> 01:50:27,705
You know?
We got to get back on it,

1117
01:50:27,788 --> 01:50:29,248
we got to get back
in the fuckin’...

1118
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:30,708
-in the groove, huh?
-Mm.

1119
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,001
Don’t you think?

1120
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:34,128
I got to go get
the Airstream sorted.

1121
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:35,588
What do you mean "sorted"?

1122
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:38,049
I just, I just got a shit ton
of things to do.

1123
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,967
-You know? -Right.
Like, with the tour and stuff?

1124
01:50:40,051 --> 01:50:41,344
-Yeah, the fuckin’ tour,
everything. -Yeah.

1125
01:50:41,427 --> 01:50:43,012
Like, we just got to
get back on it,

1126
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:44,138
-you know, everything.
-Mm-hmm.

1127
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:45,556
The album, the tour...

1128
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,558
the-the... you know?

1129
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:51,062
Yeah.

1130
01:50:56,734 --> 01:50:58,444
Hey.

1131
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:28,641
It’s okay, Lou.

1132
01:51:28,724 --> 01:51:30,684
What?

1133
01:51:34,563 --> 01:51:36,148
It’s okay.

1134
01:51:40,736 --> 01:51:42,446
What’s okay?

1135
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:51,414
You saved my life.

1136
01:51:53,999 --> 01:51:56,502
You made it...

1137
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:58,587
you made it beautiful.

1138
01:52:02,174 --> 01:52:03,926
So it’s okay.

1139
01:52:05,761 --> 01:52:07,221
What?

1140
01:52:08,431 --> 01:52:10,558
:
Why are you saying this?

1141
01:52:17,565 --> 01:52:19,775
You saved my life, too, Rubi.

1142
01:53:37,269 --> 01:53:39,563
-

1143
01:57:29,752 --> 01:57:33,964
but I can’t hear anything

1144
01:58:16,006 --> 01:58:19,176
in Durrow now

1145
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:32,481
something to say

1146
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:39,363
really it

1147
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:54,586
I can’t hear anything

1148
01:59:39,172 --> 01:59:41,133
CHILD:
Yay.

1149
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,909
-

1150
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:15,083
