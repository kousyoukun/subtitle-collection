That is not good.

172
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:17,488
Yeah, I see that.
So what...

173
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:19,949
What can we do about it?

174
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:21,367
How do I get it back?

175
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,743
Well, um...

176
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,830
You have to understand
something here.

177
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:28,582
Whether or not this is related to

178
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,085
your exposure to noise

179
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,629
or it's an autoimmune issue

180
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:35,714
doesn't really matter.

181
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,842
I understand I got a problem.

182
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,844
I'm asking you what I can do
about it.

183
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:42,221
Well, what you can do
about it first

184
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:44,682
is to eliminate all exposure

185
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,934
to loud noises.

186
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,894
And then we can run some tests

187
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,563
and we can determine exactly

188
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:53,148
what is going on with your ears.

189
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,819
And if we do, then we can have
our other conversations.

190
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:58,237
We can have what?

191
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:00,739
Well...
there are implants

192
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:02,825
that bypass the cochlea.

193
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:04,702
You said implants?

194
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,328
- Yes.
- Those work?

195
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,873
For people with severe
hearing loss or

196
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:09,874
complete deafness,

197
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,167
yes, they help.

198
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,960
Well, then let's do that.

199
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:14,503
Well...

200
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,172
it's not that simple.

201
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:17,965
Uh, it's a very involved process

202
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:18,923
and it's quite costly.

203
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:20,968
How much is it?

204
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:22,428
Well, they can run between forty

205
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,555
and eighty thousand dollars
depending, and...

206
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,224
they are not covered
by insurance.

207
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,355
Okay.

208
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,690
And, um...

209
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,652
Like, when,
when can you do it?

210
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,321
You got 'em in stock now?

211
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:41,238
Mr. Stone,

212
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:42,531
your hearing...

213
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,993
is deteriorating rapidly.

214
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:47,661
Am I right?

215
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:51,165
And over the next few days,

216
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,209
or even hours,

217
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,877
it's going to continue.

218
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:57,880
And the hearing that you have lost

219
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:00,299
is not coming back.

220
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:03,552
[muffled]
You have to understand

221
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:06,096
your first responsibility

222
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:09,058
is to preserve
the hearing you have.

223
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:18,818
[loud music]

224
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:48,097

[panicked breathing]

228
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:28,304
Ruben, what the fuck?

229
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,435
[muffled speaking]

230
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:02,463
Yes, it'll come back.

231
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:04,256
I have to...

232
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,675
There's like a surgery.

233
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:09,220
What?

234
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:10,888
It's simple.
It's all it is.

235
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,015
There's an implant.
They put it in your shit.

236
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,558
It's like a...

237
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:16,644
Okay, it'll come back.

238
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:18,395
It's fine, Lou.

239
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,105
It's like forty grand,
eighty grand, whatever,

240
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,565
but it's...

241
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,025
...it'll come back.

242
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,693
Till then, Lou,
we just keep going, okay?

243
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,070
- No.
- Lou?

244
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:27,279
- No.
- Listen to me.

245
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:28,906
Let's play tomorrow,
let's see what it's like.

246
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:30,074
Let's try it, okay?

247
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:31,909
I'm gonna be like a click track.
You can play to me.

248
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:32,952
No.

249
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:34,328
Huh? You can adj...
It's different,

250
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:35,830
but it is what it is, Lou.

251
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:43,671
Lou, we have a t...

252
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:44,880
Lou, we have a tour booked.

253
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:45,798
It's not safe...

254
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:47,675
We have a tour booked.

255
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,510
- We have a tour booked, Lou.
- No.

256
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:51,053
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

257
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:52,304
- Yes, we do.
- It's not safe, it's not safe.

258
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:53,639
We have a tour booked!

259
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:57,017
- Ruben.
- I don't fuckin'...

260
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,442
Yo!

261
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,154
You got a smoke, please?

262
00:21:11,073 --> 00:21:14,076
[muffled]

263
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,935
This is ridiculous.

264
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:48,402
He's sleeping.

265
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:50,488
Hi.
Hi, Hector?

266
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:51,739
Hi, this is Lou.

267
00:21:51,864 --> 00:21:53,616
Ruben's having a bit of...

268
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,742
a bit of trouble right now.

269
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:55,910
- He's...
- Hey, Hector, what's up?

270
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,661
He's got some hearing
problems.

271
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:00,873
Yeah, I mean I can put him on,

272
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:02,708
but he won't be able
to hear you.

273
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:04,919
Okay.

274
00:22:05,044 --> 00:22:05,836
Talk to him.

275
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:07,379
Talk to him.

276
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,927
Hey, Hector,
what's going on, man?

277
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,303
It's Ruben.

278
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:15,846
I'd say it's good
to hear your voice,

279
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,890
but I can't hear a fuckin' word
you're saying right now.

280
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,600
So this is completely pointless.

281
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:22,228
Lou wanted me to call you
because I had a cigarette.

282
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:23,812
Uh...
you know...

283
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:25,689
not great, not ideal, but...

284
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,441
considering the circumstances,

285
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,068
which are pretty fucked up.

286
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:30,986
You know, understandable.

287
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:32,530
I'd say understandable,

288
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,573
for everyone apart from Lou,
it seems.

289
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:35,491
Um...

290
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:36,700
I got this, bro.

291
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:39,078
I know you'd probably be asking
me if I'm steady right now,

292
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,996
if I'm feeling level.

293
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,122
Not completely,

294
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:43,874
but I'm cool.

295
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,252
You'd tell me serenity
is something you get

296
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:47,920
when you, uh,

297
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,630
stop wishing
for a different past.

298
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:51,340
Bro, I love you, man.

299
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,634
Oh, my manager wants the phone back,

300
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:54,635
so I gotta go.

301
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,011
Okay, love you, bro.

302
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:58,597
Hey.

303
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,349
Yeah, he can't hear a word.

304
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,022
Well, if you get him to a group,
then how is he gonna hear?

305
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,360
Okay.

306
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:16,740
Okay, tha... thanks, Hector,
thank you.

307
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:17,992
When? When?

308
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,077
Okay, yeah,
I'll make sure it's on loud.

309
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:22,246
Okay, thank you so much,
thank you.

310
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,249
Okay, bye.

311
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:33,799
He's gonna call back.

312
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:36,302
What did he say?

313
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:37,928
Write it down. Tell... What did he...

314
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:46,145
"Call back."

315
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:50,107
He's gonna call back... that's all?

316
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:51,567
Fuckin' Hector.

317
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,779
What are we gonna do now?

318
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:06,874
What do you wanna do, Lou?

319
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,459
Huh?

320
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:15,674
[muffled]

321
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:29,355
Fuck this.

322
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:36,028
[phone vibrating]

323
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:38,781
It's Hector.

324
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,037
Hey.

325
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:46,413
Yeah, he's here.

326
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,709
Not so good.

327
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,631
Oh...

328
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:57,091
Okay.

329
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,008
Uh...

330
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:58,926
yeah, what, what,

331
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,970
what is it and...

332
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:02,137
What?

333
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:03,556
What's the plan?

334
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:04,431
Uh...

335
00:25:05,724 --> 00:25:07,393
Well, we're, we're in Missouri,

336
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:08,269
so that's gonna take

337
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:10,938
a few days.
I don't... I don't really know.

338
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:13,482

I'm an alcoholic.

I lost my hearing in

I still remember the music
I was listening to

411
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:26,981
when that bomb went off.

412
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:29,775
After that,

413
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:32,111
I lost everything else...

414
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:33,654
my wife,

415
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,573
my kid.

416
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,284
Not because of being deaf,
mind you, Ruben.

417
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:39,368
It was the beer.

418
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,165
How long you been clean?

419
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,293
Four years.

420
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:48,961
- Four?
- Mmm.

421
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:52,506
And you need some help
right now?

How long you two
been together?

You play music, right?

426
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,210
- No.
- No?

427
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,294
No, not anymore.

428
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:32,296
Not until I get the implant.

429
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:33,797
Implant?

430
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:36,425
Yeah. Sorry, you know about
these implants they got now?

431
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,760
It's like... it's like, uh...

432
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:39,303
they have implants.

433
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:41,013
I know. Yes.

434
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:43,516
Expensive.

435
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,685
Yeah, thank you,
yes, they are.

436
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,062
So...

437
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:51,857
You should understand
that, uh...

438
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:53,400
this is a Deaf community,

439
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:55,694
not just my program,
but we're part

440
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:58,364
of a larger Deaf community.

441
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:00,032
And my program,

442
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:01,867
and the people in it,

443
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:02,868
they benefit

444
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:05,162
tremendously from that Deaf community.

445
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:06,747
We work with them

446
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,457
and they work with us.

447
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:09,875
But...

448
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,168
it's very important,

449
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:12,753
if you want to be here,

450
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:14,463
to understand
that we're looking for

451
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:15,840
a solution to...

452
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:17,633
to this...

453
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:20,302
...not this.

454
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:25,850
Why don't you go
invite Lou in here?

455
00:33:30,145 --> 00:33:32,064
Sure.

456
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,651
Lou!

457
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,869
This guy wants to
talk to you.

458
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,495
Okay.

459
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:51,292
Well...

460
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,670
I think it's important that you stay here
with us right now, Ruben,

461
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:56,088
learn some sign language,

462
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:58,132
find some solid ground.

463
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:00,968
What do you think?

464
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:02,761
Man, it sounds great,

465
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:04,930
but we don't have
a lot of money right now.

466
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:06,182
Well, sometimes our church

467
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:07,933
sponsors deaf people in need, and

468
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:08,851
right now,

469
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,519
you fit the bill, Ruben.

470
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:12,021
We're really not

471
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:13,522
- churchgoing people.
- Sorry, I... I read...

472
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,065
Sorry, Ruben, I read lips.
I can't...

473
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:16,484
What'd you say?

474
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:18,736
We're not religious,

475
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:19,904
either of us.

476
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:21,405
Very much not into religion,

477
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,032
no offense, you know.

478
00:34:23,157 --> 00:34:25,117
Religion plays no part
in this, Ruben.

479
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:26,660
The church helps

480
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:28,704
people in need,
not religious people.

481
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,956
The important thing is that
you want to stay here.

482
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:31,874
Mmm.

483
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,501
Yeah.

484
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:34,835
Lou?

485
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,213
Do you think Ruben
needs help right now?

486
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,302
You understand, if, uh...

487
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,137
Ruben were to stay here,

488
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:46,972
he'd have to do it on his own.

489
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:49,224
Members live in a house

490
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,518
separate from the outside world.

491
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:52,102
No contact to the outside world,

492
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:54,063
no phones.

493
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,648
I've found that
in all cases,

494
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,398
that's the way it works best.

495
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:58,983
Yo, hold up a minute, okay?

496
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:00,110
Let me catch up.

497
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,362
Okay?

498
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,240
{\an8}Can you help Ruben commit
to that, Lou?

499
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:07,576
You want, you want to
try this for a couple days?

500
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:08,619
We have our own home.

501
00:35:08,744 --> 00:35:10,412
We can stay in the RV.

502
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:11,664
No, I'm sorry to say,

503
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:13,165
that's not the way
that it works here, Ruben.

504
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,209
Well, that's a problem, then.

505
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:18,045
Do you have anywhere you can
be during this time, Lou?

506
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:22,007
Yo, that's that, man.
We're done.

507
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:23,384
We're done.

508
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,718
Thanks a lot for
your time, bro.

509
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:25,678
Appreciate it, okay?

510
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:27,346
We're out, baby.
Let's go.

511
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:57,626
Hey.

512
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:59,044
Lou...

513
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:01,672
I'm thinking
we should still go hit

514
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:03,174
our fuckin' show
in Dayton.

515
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:05,342
Okay? I can, I can
fuckin' watch you

516
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:06,218
for cues.

517
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:08,053
I know it was rocky last time
but we did...

518
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:09,054
we weren't on the same page.

519
00:36:09,138 --> 00:36:10,890
Now you know what's up,
I can fuckin' watch you.

520
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:12,933
And I know this shit
inside out.

521
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:15,269
Okay, yo.
I can fuckin' make it work

522
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:17,646
until we have enough
for surgery.

523
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,940
Okay?
We're gonna get there.

524
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,943
Yo, seriously,
we're good to go.

525
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:24,695
Lou.

526
00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:26,655
Hmm?

527
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:28,908
Hey, I'll deal with this shit.

528
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:30,159
I'll deal with it.

529
00:36:30,284 --> 00:36:31,744
You know I fucking will.
It's just money.

530
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:32,953
You know that, right?

531
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,871
Huh?

532
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,417

Ruben!

538
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:01,607

00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:10,074
Ruben!

541
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,215
Lou, look at me,
I'm not going back

542
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,675
to that fuckin' place,
okay?

543
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:31,303
I know.

544
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,013
I know.
I'm...

545
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:39,103
Well, then fuckin'
support me.

546
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,356
How's about that?
Fuckin' support me, Lou.

547
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:43,440
Huh?

548
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:46,986
You don't want to be here?

549
00:37:48,154 --> 00:37:49,280
Of course I do.

550
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:50,447
I knew it.
I fuckin' knew it.

551
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:51,782
I fuckin' knew this was coming.

552
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:52,825
I fuckin' knew it.

553
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,535
This is about
the fuckin' album, huh?

554
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:57,037
What happened?
You get a better offer?

555
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:58,247
- What are you talking about?
- Huh?

556
00:37:58,372 --> 00:37:59,165
- What are you saying?
- I can't hear,

557
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,417
I can't hear you.
I can't fucking hear you!

558
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,502
Do you understand me?
I can't, I'm fuckin' deaf.

559
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:04,920
I'm fucking deaf!

560
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:06,130
No fucking hearing!

561
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,214

Okay?

563
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:15,097
No, what I need, what I need is
a fucking gun in my mouth.

564
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:17,433
What I need is a fucking gun
in my fucking mouth!

565
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:18,517
Okay?!

566
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,482
Look, I'm sorry.

567
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,026
Lou, I'm just fucked up a little.

568
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:29,153
I just need a little...
I need a minute to think.

569
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,154
Okay?

570

[phone ringing]

571
00:38:32,198 --> 00:38:34,074
There's gotta be another way.

572
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,201
Lou?

573
00:38:38,704 --> 00:38:39,497
Hello?

574
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,207
Hey.

575
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:44,877
Oh, really?

576
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,546
Oh.

577
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,881
Who is that?

578
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,091
Okay, well,
I need to get ready. Okay.

579
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,468
No, I'll get a cab.

580
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,095
Yeah, it's fine.

581
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,640
Okay, bye.

582
00:38:58,682 --> 00:39:00,351
What's going on?

583
00:39:00,768 --> 00:39:01,727
Huh?

584
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,479
What's going on?

585
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:06,649
I'm getting on a plane
and you're gonna go back to that place.

586
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:13,614
Just slow down, okay?

587
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:14,615
Slow down!

588
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,033
Yo, chill dude,
we're gonna be a minute.

589
00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:17,535
Just chill.
Okay?

590
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:19,995
Just slow down a minute.

591
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,622
Lou.

592
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:23,707
Lou.
This is so fucked up.

593
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,501
Who's gonna be looking out
for you over there?

594
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:26,544
Hmm?

595
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:27,795
- Who's gonna look out for you?
- It's okay.

596
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,255
- Don't say that guy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

597
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,548
Lou, I need, I need more
of a plan, Lou.

598
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:31,757
- Ruben.

599
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:33,968
I need more from you, Lou.

600

I need more of a plan, Lou.

601
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,272
You can't just fuckin'...

602
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:57,366
Ah, Jesus.

603
00:39:57,449 --> 00:39:58,450
Lou, come on.

604
00:39:58,534 --> 00:39:59,326
Ruben.

605
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:00,828
Ruben.

606
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:03,372
You hurt yourself...

607
00:40:03,455 --> 00:40:05,166
Ruben. You hurt yourself,

608
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,001
you hurt me.

609
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:08,711
I'll hurt myself, too.

610
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:09,753
I'll hurt myself, too.

611
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:11,046
Don't say that.

612
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,507
Promise.

613
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:15,301
Say it, Rubi,
or all of this is for shit.

614
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:16,719
Say it!
Promise!

615
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,220
Go back there right now.

616

No, say it, promise.

619
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:27,479
Go back to that place.

620
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,231
I, only if, I need...

621
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,150
I need you to wait for me.

622
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:34,153
Okay? You're it for me, Lou.
You're my fuckin' heart.

623

You're it for me.

Okay?
You gotta wait for me.

Listen to me, listen, listen.

627
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,173
When you get there,
I need you to,

628
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,384
I need you to write to me, okay?

629
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,802
Yeah?
Will you write me

630
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,304
and tell me you're okay?

631
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,306
Huh? Promise me?

632
00:41:02,431 --> 00:41:03,766
And listen, if it's...

633
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,768
If it's bullshit, you just get
your ass back here.

634
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:07,228
I'll fix it, I swear to God.

635
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:08,479
You know
I'll fuckin' fix this.

636
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,147
This is not that hard, okay?

637
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:11,899
Just come back here.

638

You want my car keys?

651

If I ask for 'em back,

652
00:43:41,382 --> 00:43:42,925
I want 'em back, okay?

653

We're not doing that.

01:14:53,462 --> 01:14:55,047
We need money.

851
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:57,091
Huh?
It's for us.

852
01:15:00,302 --> 01:15:01,595
I'm leveling with you.

853
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,013
It's for her.

854
01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:23,659
Yo.
For this... for this?

855
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:25,077
For this,

856
01:15:25,161 --> 01:15:26,704
remember it's, uh... it's, uh...

857
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:28,789
cash.
Okay? Not check.

858
01:15:29,165 --> 01:15:29,957
Cool.

859
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,041
Yo?

860
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,084
You okay?

861
01:15:32,668 --> 01:15:34,044
Sure?

862
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:04,552
Hi, is that Prince Audiology?

863
01:17:04,677 --> 01:17:05,886
Can you hear me?

864
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,226
It's Stone, Ruben Stone.

865
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:13,894
R-U-B-E-N,

866
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:17,231
Stone, S-T-O-N-E.

867
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:19,483
I'm confirming an appointment.

868
01:17:24,071 --> 01:17:25,364
Yeah, I can hold.

869
01:18:09,825 --> 01:18:12,828
[piano muffles]

870
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:53,661
So, listen.

871
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:55,162
- What did you say? Write it down.
- Yeah, yeah.

872
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:56,664
I can't hear you.
Write it down.

873
01:19:19,103 --> 01:19:20,813
I got a proposition for you.

874
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,815
What's that?

875
01:19:23,107 --> 01:19:24,650
What if I give it to you
at this price...

876
01:19:27,486 --> 01:19:29,947
...but on one condition.

877
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,243
I have the option
of coming back to you

878
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:35,619
within eight weeks.

879
01:19:36,412 --> 01:19:37,371
Okay?

880
01:19:37,454 --> 01:19:40,332
I get to buy it back off you
for ten percent more than this.

881
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:42,960
But everything has to be
in its current condition.

882
01:19:43,043 --> 01:19:45,421
Everything has to be exactly
like it is now.

883
01:19:46,505 --> 01:19:47,590
Hmm?

884
01:19:47,923 --> 01:19:49,133
What do you think?

885
01:19:50,259 --> 01:19:51,260
Why would you want
to do that?

886
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:52,761
Dude, I can't hear you.
I'm deaf.

887
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:54,680
So... It's...
take it or leave it.

888
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:56,182
What's it gonna be?

889
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:06,901
[low rumble]

890
01:20:38,182 --> 01:20:41,060
[drill whirring]

[silence]

892
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:11,650
You're back?

893
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,113
Have a seat here.

894
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:18,309
Thank you.

895
01:22:29,084 --> 01:22:29,877
Um...

896
01:22:31,504 --> 01:22:33,547
...I did the deed.

897
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:35,925
The deed?

898
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:42,306
Surgery.

899
01:22:51,023 --> 01:22:52,566
How'd you get the money?

900
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:54,527
I sold my RV

901
01:22:54,693 --> 01:22:55,694
and other shit.

902
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:00,741
- Okay.
- Look, Joe,

903
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:01,700
I really

904
01:23:01,784 --> 01:23:03,994
don't want to explain myself
right now.

905
01:23:04,495 --> 01:23:05,496
Okay?

906
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:08,749
It's time.
Okay?

907
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,960
It's time.
I gotta do something.

908
01:23:11,961 --> 01:23:12,962
Right?

909
01:23:13,128 --> 01:23:14,088
Trying to save my f...

910
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:15,589
fuckin' life.

911
01:23:17,591 --> 01:23:18,676
So, that's what
I'm doing.

912
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:20,970
Okay? No one else is gonna
save my life.

913
01:23:21,887 --> 01:23:22,888
Right?

914
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:26,016
If I just sit here and diddle around,

915
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:27,226
what am I gonna have?
Nothing.

916
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:29,144
Okay?

917
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:32,565
And all this shit?
Like, what does it matter? What does it matter?

918
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:33,566
It just passes.

919
01:23:34,066 --> 01:23:34,984
Yo.

920
01:23:35,067 --> 01:23:36,318
If I disappear,

921
01:23:36,819 --> 01:23:38,070
like, who cares?

922
01:23:38,821 --> 01:23:40,072
Nobody cares, man.

923
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:41,198
Seriously.

924
01:23:41,323 --> 01:23:42,283
Yo, and that's okay.

925
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:43,450
That's life.

926
01:23:44,451 --> 01:23:45,411
That's life.

927
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,872
No, for real. Okay?

928
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,165
It just passes.

929
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,082
It just fuckin'...

930
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,375
fucking passes.

931
01:23:56,422 --> 01:23:58,132
I wonder, uh...

932
01:23:58,716 --> 01:24:01,010
all these mornings
you've been sitting in my study,

933
01:24:02,011 --> 01:24:03,095
sitting,

934
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,515
have you...

935
01:24:07,016 --> 01:24:08,017
had any...

936
01:24:09,226 --> 01:24:10,477
moments of...

937
01:24:10,853 --> 01:24:12,354
...stillness?

938
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,777
Because you're right, Ruben,

939
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:20,529
the world does keep moving,

940
01:24:20,613 --> 01:24:22,656
and it can be a damn...

941
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:23,741
...cruel place.

942
01:24:25,618 --> 01:24:26,869
But for me...

943
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,248
those moments of...

944
01:24:31,624 --> 01:24:33,042
...stillness,

945
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,502
that place,

946
01:24:34,585 --> 01:24:35,419
that's the...

947
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,213
...kingdom of God.

948
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,135
And that place

949
01:24:43,677 --> 01:24:45,262
will never abandon you.

950
01:24:48,724 --> 01:24:50,017
But...

951
01:24:53,729 --> 01:24:54,772
I see you've made your

952
01:24:54,855 --> 01:24:55,773
choice.

953
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,982
Right?

954
01:24:58,359 --> 01:24:59,527
Yeah.

955
01:25:01,987 --> 01:25:03,948
And I sincerely hope

956
01:25:04,657 --> 01:25:06,826
that it brings you happiness, Ruben.

957
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,399
Thank you.

958
01:25:17,628 --> 01:25:18,671
I was wondering, Joe.

959
01:25:18,754 --> 01:25:20,381
I don't know if it's possible,

960
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:24,552
but, uh...

961
01:25:25,177 --> 01:25:26,637
I need money,

962
01:25:26,971 --> 01:25:27,763
to, uh...

963
01:25:27,888 --> 01:25:29,306
just to buy back my RV.

964
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,141
You know?

965
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,269
You know, me...
me and Lou.

966
01:25:33,352 --> 01:25:34,895
This is where we live.

967
01:25:35,062 --> 01:25:37,940
It's our home. Our home.

968
01:25:38,482 --> 01:25:39,275
And I can...

969
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,484
I can totally pay you back.

970
01:25:41,026 --> 01:25:42,194
Just, uh...

971
01:25:42,903 --> 01:25:44,196
Now I got an issue with time.

972
01:25:51,871 --> 01:25:52,997
Ruben.

973
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,669
I don't understand the situation
that you've put yourself in.

974
01:25:59,378 --> 01:26:00,504
But...

975
01:26:00,754 --> 01:26:02,131
from where I'm sitting...

976
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,924
you look

977
01:26:04,008 --> 01:26:04,842
and sound

978
01:26:04,884 --> 01:26:05,843
like an addict.

979
01:26:06,468 --> 01:26:07,303
No, I don't.

980
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:08,304
Yo, no.

981
01:26:08,971 --> 01:26:09,889
I'm not...

982
01:26:09,972 --> 01:26:10,806
It's not...

983
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,807
Not an addi...

984
01:26:12,892 --> 01:26:13,809
It's fine. Okay?

985
01:26:13,893 --> 01:26:14,852
My situation,

986
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:15,811
it's cool.

987
01:26:15,936 --> 01:26:16,770
Okay?

988
01:26:17,354 --> 01:26:19,940
Seriously, my girlfriend's dad is rich,

989
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:21,650
he can give me...
give me the money.

990
01:26:21,901 --> 01:26:23,068
Okay?
This is nothing.

991
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:24,862
You can't imagine how nothing this is.

992
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:26,780
Seriously.

993
01:26:29,783 --> 01:26:30,743
I'm fucking stupid...

994
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:32,077
I'm... I'm sorry to ask.

995
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:33,162
I'm sorry.

996
01:26:33,496 --> 01:26:34,455
Okay?

997
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:36,624
Okay.

998
01:26:43,797 --> 01:26:45,841
Please can I stay here for just...

999
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,719
three, four weeks?

1000
01:26:48,844 --> 01:26:50,012
Till they...

1001
01:26:50,888 --> 01:26:51,805
activate?

1002
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:00,189
Ruben.

1003
01:27:01,732 --> 01:27:02,775
As you know,

1004
01:27:03,442 --> 01:27:04,276
everybody here

1005
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,903
shares in the belief that

1006
01:27:05,986 --> 01:27:07,905
being deaf is not a handicap.

1007
01:27:08,447 --> 01:27:10,366
Not something to fix.

1008
01:27:12,743 --> 01:27:14,453
It's pretty important
around here.

1009
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:18,707
All these kids...

1010
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:22,002
all of us,

1011
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,505
need to be reminded of it

1012
01:27:25,381 --> 01:27:26,590
every day.

1013
01:27:30,344 --> 01:27:31,136
And my house

1014
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:33,430
is a house built on that belief,

1015
01:27:33,556 --> 01:27:34,890
and built on trust.

1016
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,854
And when that trust is violated,

1017
01:27:40,396 --> 01:27:41,730
things happen.

1018
01:27:48,779 --> 01:27:50,823
And I can't have that.

1019
01:27:52,324 --> 01:27:54,368
There are too many others

1020
01:27:54,451 --> 01:27:55,452
to consider.

1021
01:27:58,831 --> 01:27:59,623
And so,

1022
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:01,917
