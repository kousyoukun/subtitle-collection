1
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:03,532
Time.

2
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,199
Time, it has been proposed is the fourth dimension.

3
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:13,899
And yet, for mortal man, time has no dimension at all.

4
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:19,651
We are like horses with blinders
seeing only what lies before us.

5
00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:26,815
Forever guessing the future... and fabricating the past.

7
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:31,355
- Brilliant.
- Quite right, Your Grace.

8
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:41,635
How, you ask, can we lift these shackles
and live not in the moment
but in the glorious expanse of time's continuum?

10
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:46,620
Listen, and I shall tell you.

11
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:55,566
The secret lies in the enduring power
of our achievements... - Yes! - ... our creations!

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:09,024
As the pyramids testify to the Egyptians...
so my glorious erection shall represent...
... our culture in perpetuity.

16
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:14,996
Behold, rising before you
the greatest erection on the Continent.

17
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:22,827
The greatest erection of the age!
The greatest erection on the planet!

19
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,099
- Hold this.
- Of course.

20
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:44,053
For the Herald, Your Grace. I understand
you'll be making an important announcement tonight.

21
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,918
Good afternoon, ladies.
Please, excuse me, please.

22
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,824
- And the Perrier-Jouet should be chilled.
You understand? Chilled. - Yes, sir.

23
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:20,251
Leopold! Leopold, where have you been?

24
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:21,966
Leopold!

25
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:26,438
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past 5:00! He's not even dressed!

26
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:30,911
- He'll be ready, my lord. I assure you.
- I don't want him ready. I want him resplendent!

27
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:33,837
Ah, Miss Blaine.

28
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,683
You dance like a... like a herd of cattle.

29
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:43,743
You are a rare woman
who lights up a room simply by leaving it.

30
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:47,631
Might you be rich, Miss Blaine? You see..

31
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:51,885
... whilst I am the third Duke
the little secret of those of us in the Royal Court...

32
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:56,157
...apart from our general uselessness
is our massive indebtedness.

33
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,385
It's always been your misfortune, Leopold...
... that you so thoroughly amuse yourself
with the sound of your own voice.

35
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,486
In a life as stagnant as mine 
that I can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary marvel.

37
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:18,060
- Please don't touch that.
- The device you were jabbering about.

38
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:20,485
To take priests to the bell tower.

39
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:23,370
To take anyone, Uncle, to the floor they so desire.

40
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:27,340
Buildings continue to climb.
Soon they will outstrip the stamina of our legs.

41
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:33,610
You speak of progress and invention.
Yet what I offer you downstairs is reality.

43
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,411
Take a wife. Marry.

44
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:40,633
Marriage... marriage is the promise of eternal love.

46
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:44,854
As a man of honor, I can not
promise eternally what I have never felt momentarily.

47
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:53,382
Born into privilege, yet perversely ashamed of it.
That is your tragedy. My God!
If my brother could only see you, he'll be heartbroken.

49
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,932
- You are no duke!
- Of course I'm not.

50
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,941
The monarchy is dead, Uncle.
We are relics. That is reality.

51
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:06,005
The new Royals are men of accomplishment.
Men like Roebling, with his bridge..
... Edison, with his lamp, Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...

53
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,349
Those men made themselves from nothing!

54
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:15,033
You, on the other hand, were born
with everything and from it, fashioned nothing.

55
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:20,134
As of tonight, I wash my hands of you.

56
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,066
Take a good look at your dance card, Leopold.

57
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:27,699
A wealthy bride is your only surety.

58
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:53,489
Your Grace, may I present
Miss Tree of the Trees of Schenectady, sir.

59
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:57,209
Miss Tree?

60
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:06,740
It's an honor to be
making your royal acquaintance, Your Highness.

61
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,369
Shall we?

62
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,006
I've never been to England... but...

63
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,889
Father's teeth were made there.

64
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,877
He's quite rich, your father?

65
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,438
Oh, yes..

66
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,273
Many dreams, all useless.

67
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,158
Who are you?

68
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,267
No, no, no.

69
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:03,891
Please, wait, no.
I don't want to harm you. Stop! Please!

70
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:05,893
Sir, wait!

71
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:07,294
Please stop! Please!

72
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:11,488
Stop! Leopold!

73
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:16,684
Pardon me. Pardon me.

74
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:20,948
Go! Go!

75
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:37,526
Stop, sir! Please!

76
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,493
Oh, my God.

77
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:09,875
No!

78
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:13,761
Let go!

79
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,359
Just let go. It's okay!

80
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:20,453
You don't understand! Let go!

81
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:27,631
- Oh!
- I don't want to hurt you! Let go!

82
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:44,914
What?

83
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:49,731
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be.

84
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:58,728
It's just that... if a guy like that can get a girl like you,
what's left for a guy like me?

86
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:01,129
A guy like that can get a girl like me.

87
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,096
But a girl like me will never love him.

88
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Are you saying you love me?

89
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:07,608
It's possible.

90
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,376
Turn it up higher.

91
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:28,108
Some more, turn it up higher.

92
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:33,554
I've never felt so happy.

93
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:50,404
That's right, you can just leave it blank, Ok?

94
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:53,605
It's really just about what you're feeling. All right?

95
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,024
Guy in the windbreaker right there.

96
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:59,357
Two ladies right in front of him.

97
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:01,903
Hey.

98
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,163
So how did you think it went?

99
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:06,248
Well, if I had to guess, mid 60's.

100
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,302
Why don't they love it?

101
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,052
- She's not likeable.
- She's right.

102
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:12,263
Absolutely. I can do some trims
where she sleeps with her boss.

103
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,114
- Cut that whole section.
- Excuse me?

104
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:17,042
Excuse me. What are you talking about?

105
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:19,598
- The movie, Richard, your movie?
- I'm aware of that.

106
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:20,598
Look, I want to say something.

107
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:24,553
I think Julie is likeable.
Very likeable in this picture. And real.

109
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,529
What, excuse me, you've never made a mistake in your life?

110
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,062
You have no flaws? You never slept with the wrong guy?

111
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:33,078
I'm not the protagonist in a major motion picture.

112
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,035
Let me tell you something, you people,
you are sucking the life out of American cinema.

113
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,580
Richard, come on.

114
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:42,521
It's a comedy. But it's also a drama.
It can be about something.

115
00:12:45,742 --> 00:12:49,080
"You are sucking the life out of American cinema."

116
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:52,244
"You are sucking the life out of American cinema"?

117
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:55,250
- Maybe he's got a point, though?
- What?

118
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,342
Well...

119
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:59,610
Don't you ever think
that what we do is a bit... crass?

120
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:04,774
We find out what regular people think
and we pass on their wisdom.

121
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:08,281
That's what we do.
Is that crass? Is that cold? I don't think so.

122
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:13,996
We make peanut butter creamier.
We make cereal crunchier.
Sit-coms funnier. Boring movies shorter.

124
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:16,356
We made Smuckers get the seeds out of their jam.

125
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:19,457
We did that. If you ask me, we're heroes.

126
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:24,594
It just goes with the territory that every once in a while
some pompous jerk sticks his head out of his cave&says...

128
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,466
"Hey, I like seeds in my jam. Without seeds it's just jelly."

129
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:30,730
"You people are sucking the life out of my condiments."

130
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:32,879
I say to him... this is what I say to him, Darcy...

131
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,216
You, baby, are one percent of one percent.

132
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,669
Your opinion is irrelevant.

133
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,715
I went out with a visionary like you for four years.

134
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,746
And I had to pay his rent?!

135
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:46,721
Because he couldn't stoop down
and get a job, like the rest of us?

136
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:48,717
- This is not about Stuart.
- Yes it is!

137
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:52,693
It is about Stuart. It's about
anybody who can't face up to reality.

138
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:55,732
I don't care if it's crass.
Just give me the number. Give me the bottom line.

139
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,581
Give me the truth straight up, no chaser.

140
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:55,591
<i>Bart!</i>

141
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:03,719
<i>Quiet!</i>

142
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,177
Oh my God!

143
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:47,075
We must remember, Bart...
... that sometimes, it is okay to color outside the lines.

145
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:57,630
- Hello?
- My Palm Pilot. You still have it.

146
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,222
Kate, it's 1:00 in the morning.

147
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,437
And clearly you're awake, so what is the infraction?

148
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,716
Look, Kate, I don't know where your Palm Pilot is.

149
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:07,997
And I can't do this right now.
Not now. I'm expecting a call.

150
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:29,314
Oh, Bart. Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

151
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,616
She is not a happy person.

152
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,016
Goddamn it!

153
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:50,590
- You know what, Stuart? You know what? I'm...
- Kate... Please. I've got somebody here, okay?

155
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:52,262
I know. I saw her.

156
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,144
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did!

157
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:56,877
It's a him, if that's any kind of consolation to you.

158
00:16:56,878 --> 00:17:00,747
So, look, now that you know
I'm not getting laid, just go to bed, okay?

159
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:03,758
Nuh-uh, don't. Do not hang up
on me, Stuart. Don't do that.

160
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,635
Kate, please.

161
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:09,771
I beg of you. Something big is happening.

162
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,585
Something... that validates my entire life.

164
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:17,175
"Something that validates your entire life."
What could that possibly be?

165
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,851
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes.

166
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,732
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

167
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,194
- No, you're not.
- Ye...

168
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:26,870
Okay.

169
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,251
I found it.

170
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:34,438
- What did you find?
- A portal.

171
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,695
A crack in the fabric of time.

172
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,833
It was over the East River, Kate,
just where I said it would be.

173
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:45,348
- You found the portal?
- A portal into April 28th, 1876.

174
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:51,774
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge...
... and took a walk in 1876 today.

176
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,500
I followed my great-great grandpa, around old New York.

177
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,558
- Are you listening?
- Avidly.

178
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,423
This here's the twist, Kate. Here's the kicker.

179
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:03,904
<i>What's the kicker?</i>

180
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:07,500
He followed me home.

181
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:09,530
- Your great-great grandfather...
- Yes.

182
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:12,255
- Viscount of Buffalo.
- No, he's not a viscount...

183
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:14,387
- The Duke of Buffalo...
- No, the Duke of Albany.

184
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:17,803
- Albany followed you home through a crack in time.
- I told you about him. He's a brilliant engineer.

185
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:21,152
He patented the counterweight pulley.
He invented the elevator, for Christ's sake.

186
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:24,108
You know what, Stuart? You know what?
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

187
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,237
I haven't been for a whole month now.

188
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,269
- You can tell me the truth.
- I am telling you the truth, Kate.

189
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,456
You can tell me you went and picked up
a transvestite in Times Square. I don't care.

190
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:39,604
You know what, Kate?
This is it, right here. This is it, in a nutshell. Our downfall.

191
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:41,917
You never... not once... believed in me.

192
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:46,950
Oh, I did, Stuart. I did, for four years. And I got burnt.

193
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:50,408
Okay, you want to know who he is?
I'll tell you who he is.

194
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:55,555
He is a hacker. High end. English.
I know him from Columbia.

195
00:18:55,556 --> 00:18:58,594
He's in town for the Mac Expo at the Javits.

196
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:02,668
We went out, got a little sloppy on Guinness
and he passed out on my couch.

197
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,470
- And that's the truth?
- Mm-hmm. That's the truth. Okay? Are you happy now?

198
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:11,047
Is that plausible enough for u and your little focus group?

199
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:13,785
You know what, Stuart?

200
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,299
I blew my best years on you.

201
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,241
Those were your best?

202
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,614
Look...

203
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,406
I'm sorry.

204
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,501
I have to go.
You'll get your Pilot in the morning.

205
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:47,205
Orange alert.

206
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:59,703
What is it?

207
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:06,182
Bart! No!

208
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:12,326
Bart, stop!

209
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:16,590
It's okay.

210
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,229
- You?
- It's okay.

211
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:25,451
- Where am I?
- Well, um, there's not an easy explanation for that.

212
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:29,756
If it's a ransom you seek, my uncle won't pay a cent.
Except, perhaps, for my demise.

213
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:32,180
No. no. You're not being kidnapped. Bart, quiet!

214
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:34,521
I can scarcely see, thanks to your spray.

215
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:39,120
My eyes feel like Steak au Poivre.
So I ask you again, where the hell am I?

216
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:45,926
<i>As far as I'm concerned...</i>

217
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:51,200
<i>you might be Jack the Ripper!</i>

218
00:21:52,420 --> 00:22:00,095
And you would have me believe
that I'm being detained at present in the hereafter?
The time to come? Yes. Bart, quiet! He needs a walk.

220
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:05,441
And you would have me believe that you are my progeny.
A product of a marriage unmade. Yes.

223
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:09,492
Oh! And you would have me believe
that you have found a crack in time.

224
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:13,464
You, of all people, should understand.
I mean, you're a scientist. You invented the elevator.

225
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:16,849
What is an elevator?
What the hell are you talk... Where the hell am I?!

226
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:22,868
I told you... you haven't actually gone anywhere.
You're still in New York. That, sir, is not New York!

228
00:22:22,952 --> 00:22:24,414
I'm afraid it is.

229
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:28,887
- No, Kate.
- Hello. Hello there. What's your name?

230
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,351
Leopold.

231
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:36,997
Tell me something. I'm having trouble with my G-5.
How much RAM do I need to properly run OS 9.6?

233
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,842
Clearly, the Mac Expo is out.

234
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:45,398
So you must be a man out of time? Or Sergeant Pepper?

235
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:49,076
- You know what? Actually, we could use a little privacy.
- Stuart, I want my Palm Pilot.

236
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:52,463
- I'm not... I'm serious. Maybe later on, Kate.
- I just want my Palm Pilot, Stuart!

237
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:56,224
- No. No.
- Hey, give me my Palm Pilot! Give it to me.

238
00:22:57,562 --> 00:22:58,732
This is madness.

239
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:01,951
This is madness. Who was that?
I feel as if I've seen her...

240
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:05,922
Women have changed since your time, Leo.
They've become dangerous.

241
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:08,346
It's on the landing!

242
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:14,323
You say this is no kidnapping.
You say you mean no harm.

243
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:17,879
Then why is it, sir,
you will not unlock the door?

244
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,848
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry about her. I'm...

245
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:27,573
Look, with all due respect
I can't let you just go running around free out there, okay?

246
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,166
This is New York City. It's not such a safe place anymore.

247
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:34,764
Look at you. You look like some sort
of psychotic escapee from a Renaissance faire.

248
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:38,442
I understand you have some anxiety
but you have to trust me.

249
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,908
I'm going to get you home, okay?

250
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:44,085
I promise.

251
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:45,883
Bart!

252
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:52,027
The portal opens up again next week. Monday.

253
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,953
I know that, because it was my back-up
in case I didn't make it last night.

254
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:58,757
It's on a cycle, you know?
Kind of like, uh... total eclipse.

255
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,972
Once every 20 years. You understand?

256
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:04,442
Generally, I understand everything.
Since I've met you, nothing.

257
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:09,124
I can only assume I'm in a nightmare
brought on by agita, or else I am dead.

258
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,718
You're not dead. Come here. Sit down. Here.

259
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:18,027
Want some milk in yours?

260
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:22,040
Bart, can I just have...

261
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,720
Sorry. He's really got to go out.

262
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:36,544
I'll be honored if you took a look at those.

263
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:41,433
Um, I'll explain everything when I get back.
He's got to go out or he's going to drop a bomb in there.

264
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:42,939
Come on. Let's go.

265
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:47,647
Back in five.

266
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:03,557
One quick trip to Spectra, Bart...
... and you and I will be Nobel Laureates.

268
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:11,604
Come on, Bart.

269
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,805
Hey, let's go.

270
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,163
Come on.
Let's go.

271
00:25:23,837 --> 00:25:24,841
Oh, Jesus!

272
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:29,378
Oh, God.

273
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,899
Good boy, Bart!

274
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:32,841
Stay!

275
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:35,769
Stay, Bart! Stay!

276
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,591
Oh, Bart, please stay!

277
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:21,294
Stuart, you forgot the pointy thing!

278
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,537
Stuart...

279
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:40,770
Look, this is not complex.
He gave me the Palm Pilot but he forgot the pointy thing.

280
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,945
- I've been warned about you.
- Oh. Really?

281
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:45,594
And what, pray tell, did the great disappointment say?

282
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:47,768
- That you were dangerous, though you hardly look it.
- Oh, really?

283
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:50,335
A lady in trousers isn't dangerous, merely plain.

284
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,964
- I take it you're a career woman.
- Yeah, market research.

285
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:55,281
Mm. Fine avocation for women, research.

286
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:57,409
Perfect for the feminine mind.

287
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:01,464
You're a trip, Lionel.

288
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:10,725
I myself once courted a librarian in Sussex.

289
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:15,327
Good for you.

290
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:21,090
I must confess I feel as though
we've met on a previous occasion.

291
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:25,072
Well, Lionel, seeing as
I've never met a single friend of Stuart's.

292
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:29,967
I'm not even sure he's ever had any.
I really don't see how that's possible.

293
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,389
Oh, man! Bart!

294
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:38,959
He just made Lake Erie out there.
You just can't toss a dog out into the hall like that.

295
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:42,600
- You can't do that.
- I assure you, I did not.

296
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:46,107
- Let's go.
- I beg your pardon?

297
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:47,988
Come on. Let's go!

298
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:50,580
Bart...

299
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:56,181
Look, pal, I don't care how many elevators you got.
This one's in my building.

300
00:27:56,516 --> 00:27:57,770
Hang-hang on a second.

301
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:01,448
Sorry about the elevator, Miss Kate.
I've got them on the phone right now.

302
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:03,956
Hey, Gracy. This is Lionel, Stuart's friend.

303
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:05,209
How do you do?

304
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:08,641
Ten minutes? I need someone here right now.

305
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,279
- Watch it, man.
- I beg your pardon.

306
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:41,910
Hey, what are you doing?

307
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:44,125
You need to be going that way. There's an electron...

308
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:46,675
Hello? Hello? There's an electronics store. Hello?

309
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,762
I'm sorry, miss.

310
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:51,147
There's a patch of grass across the street.
Take him there. He'll do his business.

311
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,781
Can you give this to Stuart, please? It's his cable bill.

312
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:15,516
They haul our furniture and cradle our children
but this morning, from the Battery to the Bronx...
elevators have mysteriously...

314
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:30,273
So sorry.

315
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,822
- I do beg your pardon.
- Stupid!

316
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,719
I beg your pardon.

317
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,960
Are you going to remove that?

318
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:53,721
I beg your pardon?

319
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:56,356
Pick it up and put it in the trash.

320
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,827
Absolutely not.

321
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:06,567
Maybe you don't understand.
It's against the law to leave it there.

322
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:12,065
Are you suggesting, madam,
there exists a law compelling gentlemen
to lay hold of canine bowel movements?

324
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,792
I'm suggesting you pick the poop up
and throw it away now.

325
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:19,899
I refuse. Respectfully.

326
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,376
All right. What's your name, fancy pants?

327
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:32,858
Leopold... Alexis Elija Walker...
... Thomas Garrett Mountbatten.

330
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:41,693
All right, Stuart. Have a nice day.

332
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:50,237
I appreciate you putting in a good word for me
but J.J.'s not back from London.

333
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:55,272
- Right. Bye. What's with the elevators?
- It's happening everywhere.

334
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,202
Darci.

335
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,902
Last page.

336
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:11,353
Sorry.

337
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:13,934
Did everyone live happily ever after?

338
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,398
He lost his leg to gangrene waiting for her on the island.

339
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,228
- But they're together now.
- Wonderful.

340
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:22,956
- Oh, look, you got your Palm Pilot back.
- A nightmare.

341
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,814
Okay, so who do I owe?

342
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:29,312
Okay, Bobby at Hasbro. Reeves at Crunch.

343
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:32,573
And the finals came in for "Love for Sale."
The call with the studio's at 4:00.

344
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,506
The margarine thing's in 15 in the conference room.

345
00:31:34,507 --> 00:31:36,806
J.J. wants to talk to you before that.
Oh, and one more thing.

346
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:44,626
I remember that you told me to start thinking ahead...
... so I know your brother's getting back from his retreat
tomorrow and if you want something in the fridge... Darci...

349
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:47,659
Can you tell me why I'm upset right now?

350
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:49,843
Because, uh...

351
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:55,008
J.J. called this morning.
That is why I have a cell phone. So you can call me...

352
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,674
Kate, Kate, he didn't call.
He just popped his head in here and spoke two sentences.

353
00:31:58,745 --> 00:31:59,841
So he's back?

354
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:02,476
Margo says he's going to make
a big announcement about the merger next week.

355
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:05,636
Margo? What does she know?
How does she know anything about anything?

356
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,832
Oh. All right.

357
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:13,601
So he popped his head in here.
All right, so you have to tell me exactly what he said, Darci.

358
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:15,885
You have to start at the beginning and tell me...

359
00:32:15,886 --> 00:32:19,356
He said, "Tell Kate I'm going to sit in on Farmer's Bounty."

360
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,942
J.J.

361
00:32:22,823 --> 00:32:25,205
- Good morning, Kate.
- Good morning.

362
00:32:25,455 --> 00:32:26,835
I'll see you in there.

363
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,821
Good Lord, it still stands.

364
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:55,778
The world has changed all around it
but Roebling's erection still stands!

365
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:58,812
That, my friend, is a miracle.

366
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,821
- What?
- It's a miracle, man!

367
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:03,494
It's a bridge.

368
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:06,670
Tell me when did they adapt it for steam engines?

369
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:10,140
The fire brigade.

370
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,233
I don't know how it happened. I found him in a shaft.

371
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,361
Stuart!

372
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:33,166
Leopold, what are you doing out here?

373
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:35,131
Get back inside!

374
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:42,320
They're taking him to Goodman Memorial.

375
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:49,175
Fresh creamery butter.

376
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:52,560
Is there anything more comforting?

377
00:33:52,770 --> 00:34:01,175
There is and I know you will agree
when you try Farmer's Bounty...
... with the essence of real butter in every bite.

379
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:07,651
Your first choice. However, 45% of our demo
circled "shifty" as his key descriptor. Not good.

381
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:14,715
This is what I say. Everybody should be trying Farmer's
Bounty with the real, rich, creamy taste of real butter.

383
00:34:14,798 --> 00:34:18,017
Try it, and you will be losing pounds. Poof! Boom! Voila!

384
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:26,418
Your second choice. Unfortunately,
the group found him obnoxious, abrasive
and a whopping 72% found him just plain creepy.

386
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:29,846
The spot rolls out in four days. We have to...

387
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,312
The product is shipping.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

388
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:34,068
We have to do another session. Tomorrow.

389
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:38,165
I had my assistant book the response room at National
so we can decide then and there.

390
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:44,016
- Kate, are you all right?
- You okay?

391
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,444
- I'm fine.
- Geez, Kate, I'll ask for a decaf.

392
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:53,777
Monica, I need you to call Barney's.
I need a white blouse, size small in Kate's office by lunch.

394
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,253
Oh, dear.

395
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:13,067
Hi, you've reached Stuart. Please leave a message.

396
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:17,999
Leopold? Leopold, look,
don't be frightened. This is Stuart, okay?

397
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,842
Is it Bell's talking telegraph?

398
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:24,645
- I saw a prototype at last year's faire.
- I need you to pick up the handset, Leo.

399
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:28,826
You pick up the green handset,
because I need to talk to you...

400
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:31,165
Are-are you there? Hello?

401
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:33,967
Leopold, thank God. Listen, they're taking me to X-Rays.

402
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:36,935
Everything's going to be fine
but you have to stay in the apartment,
do you understand me?

403
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,944
Oh, Stuart, I saw Roebling's bridge today.

404
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:43,456
- I saw it... complete.
- Yes, yes, but listen to me.

405
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:46,633
You can't go out again.
You have to stay in the apartment.

406
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:49,818
- Stay in the apartment? For how long?
- Leo, I'll be back tonight. I promise.

407
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:51,518
No more field trips.

408
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,036
Would you...

409
00:35:53,037 --> 00:35:56,402
Hel... hello? Stuart?

410
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:57,406
Hello?

411
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,413
Blast!

412
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:04,417
Hello.

413
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,443
Hello.

414
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:08,141
Who are you?

415
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:13,634
Hector. My mom works late on Wednesdays...
... so I watch TV with Stuart.

417
00:36:15,401 --> 00:36:17,274
Want some Pirate's Booty?

418
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:24,000
Excuse me, J.J., I wanted to thank you
for the shirt. That was very nice.

419
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:25,757
Come in, come in.

420
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:27,262
Yeah. Uh-huh.

421
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:29,728
Absolutely.

422
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,155
Oh, good, good. Yeah, she's here right now. I'll tell her.

423
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:35,789
Okay... okay. Bye.

424
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:38,130
Sit down.

425
00:36:38,924 --> 00:36:42,268
That was Barry. He was thrilled
with your work at the screening last night.

426
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:44,149
Oh, good. Good.

427
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:53,637
You're a rarity among women, Kate.

428
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,062
I'm sorry?

429
00:36:56,312 --> 00:37:00,692
You don't cling to illusion.
You don't get caught up in emotion.

431
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,543
You don't do pretty.

432
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:05,843
I don't?

433
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:08,936
You skew male. You're like a man.

434
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:15,081
A man who understands women their desires, their needs.

435
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:20,514
You understand them but you're not really one of them.

436
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:26,700
- You don't mind my being frank, do you?
- No. I don't. No.

437
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:30,379
Edamame?

438
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:41,874
Kate?

439
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:59,012
- But one day, he lowered the Jolly Roger...
- Stu?

440
00:37:59,095 --> 00:38:02,147
...and set sail in search another kind of treasure.

441
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:06,912
Not money, not jewels, not gold... but a bride.

442
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:15,355
Despite his being a ruffian of the brine
fearless in his plunder and merciless with the sword
the Pirate King was also lonely.

444
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,619
You see, he had never met a lady.

445
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:21,584
He never met a girl?

446
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:26,014
No. Not a girl, not a lady,
not even his own mother.

447
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,561
So what happened?

448
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:33,747
As with all comedies the most ridiculous thing imaginable
the Pirate King fell in love
with the major general's daughter.

450
00:38:34,257 --> 00:38:37,113
I had the good fortune to see the premiere
last month at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.

451
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,328
Since when is Penzance at the Fifth?

452
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:47,335
Is it your habit, sir
to simply enter a conversation without introduction?

453
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,941
Whoa, you are deep in it.

454
00:38:50,317 --> 00:38:53,703
It's cool. I'm an actor, too. I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.

455
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,113
Kate McKay, senior vice president.

456
00:38:57,198 --> 00:38:59,204
Darci, it hasn't happened.

457
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:05,882
All he did was dangle a carrot.
Until he makes a decision the pressure's doubled.
When's he going to make a decision?

459
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,194
We're having dinner tomorrow
to discuss it further at Commune.

460
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:10,156
- Kate?
- Yeah.

461
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,918
I have Stuart on the line. No!
He says he's... No! ... in the hospital.

462
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:20,350
I got the number of a specialist.
A bone guy -- he did David Cohn's elbow...
so he'll check on you tomorrow.

463
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,392
No, you're not listening to me, Kate.
I can't be here tomorrow.
I can't be here today. I have to go home now.

464
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:29,193
Leopold is just sitting alone in my apartment.
God knows what could happen to him.

465
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:30,280
Do you realize he got outside today?

466
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:31,952
Of course he did... I made him walk your dog.

467
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:32,871
What?

468
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,090
No, Kate, you can't do that! He can't go outside!

469
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:39,643
Jesus Christ, Kate. He's from 1876, Kate.

470
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:44,366
He doesn't know our customs. If something were
to happen to him it could be catastrophic.

471
00:39:44,669 --> 00:39:46,574
His mere presents has already caused an occlusion.

472
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:47,617
Occlusion!

473
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:51,385
If he doesn't go back on Monday, I may cease to exist!

474
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,628
I'm his decedent, Kate,
along with God knows how many other people.

475
00:39:56,629 --> 00:40:01,950
If he doesn't go back to April 28, 1876,
he doesn't get married, he doesn't have children,
and you want to know what?

477
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:05,001
What happened with the elevators today,
well, that's going to seem like a walk in the park. Stuart!

478
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,204
This is embarrassing. It's embarrassing now, all right?

479
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,041
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

480
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:12,333
But there happens to be a lot going on with me right now.

481
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,299
Someone has to keep an eye on him.

482
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:16,890
Stuart, he's a grown man.

483
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:18,625
He's a grown man. He's fine.

484
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:22,155
- He can take care of himself.
- No. Wait. Aah! - I'm going.

485
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:23,620
Kate, please.

486
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,592
Just take this to Spectra, okay? Get it developed.

487
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,642
You'll see... I'm telling the truth. Tell Manny it's important.

488
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:32,273
You want double prints?

489
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:36,369
That's not funny, Kate. This is not a joke.

490
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:40,424
You need help, Stuart. You need help.

491
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:08,225
# I'm very good at integral and differential calculus #
# I know the scientific names of beings animalculous #
# In short, in matters vegetable, animal and mineral #
# I am the very model of a modern major-general #

491
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:09,888
Charlie?

492
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,651
Hey, Kate!

493
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:16,288
Can I see you downstairs for a minute?

494
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:19,047
I invited someone to dinner.
He's up there all alone.

495
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,261
Stuart's in the hospital.
I didn't think you'll
have such a problem...

496
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,062
No, you didn't think, Charlie.
You didn't think.

497
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:26,654
You came home early,
one day early from actor camp.

498
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:29,497
Okay, it's not actor camp and yeah,
I came home a day early, all right?

499
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,461
There was this tai chi broad
who kept trying stick her fingers...

500
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:36,268
No, this is the point. You immediately
march upstairs to my
ex-boyfriend's apartment...

501
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:39,570
- ...and you invite his freakish friend...
- See, that's what it's about.
It's not that I went up there.

502
00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:42,246
- It's that it was your ex-boyfriend...
- No, it's not about Stuart.

503
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:45,296
Greetings, Kate. Charles.

504
00:41:45,423 --> 00:41:46,426
Hey, Leo.

505
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:48,641
Be nice.

506
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:15,058
- So, when's Stuart getting back?
- Couple days, maybe a week.

507
00:42:15,142 --> 00:42:17,232
He promised me that he would
return late this evening.

508
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:20,993
Well, maybe he will, Leopold.
He's so big on keeping his promises...

509
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,044
May I have the next course?

510
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,132
There is no next course.

511
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:42,770
Where I come from the meal is
the result of reflection and study.

512
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:46,795
Menus are prepared
in advance timed to perfection.

513
00:42:46,952 --> 00:42:51,927
It is said, without the culinary arts
the crudeness of reality
would be unbearable.

514
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:54,602
We had a saying in the McKay house:

515
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:58,573
"You shake and shake the ketchup bottle.
None will come, and then a lot'll."

516
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:04,969
- What is that?
- I beg your pardon?

517
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:06,264
Why are you standing?

518
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:08,813
I'm accustomed to stand
when a lady leaves the table.

519
00:43:18,135 --> 00:43:21,438
Tell me, Charles when Stuart and your
sister were engaged...

520
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:24,488
...did you happen to read his papers on
the temporal universe?

521
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,494
I spent the morning perusing them,
and must confess...

522
00:43:26,578 --> 00:43:29,713
Stuart and I were never engaged.
Not even close.

523
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:31,219
But I did read...

524
00:43:31,636 --> 00:43:32,681
Thank you.

525
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:35,690
But I did read his papers however,
to show support.

526
00:43:35,774 --> 00:43:37,739
Is Stuart still trying
to make a time machine?

527
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:40,749
That's the beauty of it,
he discovered no machine was necessary.

528
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:44,002
All one had to do was to develop
formula to forecast portals...

529
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:46,516
...natural windows in the fabric of time.

530
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:49,944
Apparently, Stuart located
one utilizing modern...

531
00:43:54,793 --> 00:43:57,260
Utilizing modern theories
of weather prediction.

532
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,345
What's a portal?

533
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,604
An opening which exists for but a moment.

534
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:02,902
This explains why one must jump
through it from a height...

535
00:44:02,986 --> 00:44:07,584
in order to achieve the required velocity.
The speed of gravity, to be exact.
It's quite brilliant.

536
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,349
You are so method. You don't even break
for a second, do you? It's unbelievable!

537
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:16,989
Oh, stop it, please! No more! Stop, please?
I beg you. I'm tired. Can you go away?

538
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:19,079
Can you just go away?
Can you go away?

539
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:22,381
- She's drunk, Leo.
- Oh, shut up, Charlie!

540
00:44:22,464 --> 00:44:24,721
And you, can you go upstairs?
Can you go away?

541
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:27,730
I am truly sorry if I have
offended you in any way.

542
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,072
Goodnight, Charles.

543
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,126
Goodnight, Leo.

544
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:40,522
What the hell was that?

545
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:44,158
He thinks he's from
the 19th century, Charlie.
He thinks he's a duke.

546
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:45,203
I know.

547
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:46,709
- Isn't that cool?
- No.

548
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,216
Kate, he's in character.
He is an actor.

549
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,056
Oh, really? For what show?

550
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:55,069
You know that just because someone
doesn't have a paying gig...

551
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:58,161
...it doesn't mean they're not
working on their craft.

552
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:44,098
What's going on here?

553
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:47,858
I think there's something
wrong with his, uh...

554
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,574
...thing.

555
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,007
- Give me that telephone.
- No.

556
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,599
- Give it to me.
- No, I need to...

557
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:01,319
What do you expect me to do?
You took away my cell phone.

558
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:04,704
- They're not allowed on hospital property.
- I have to make a phone call!

559
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:06,962
You're not going to make one now.

560
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,681
No, no, you don't understand.
This is a very important phone call.

561
00:46:10,765 --> 00:46:13,316
I have to leave this hospital now.
I can't be here anymore.

562
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:16,158
Mr. Besser, I am tired of telling you this.

563
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:20,797
You are not going nowhere
until Dr. Feinstein signs your release!

564
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,390
Did you ever take any
earth science, Esther, hmm?

565
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:25,228
You look like a smart woman.

566
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:29,612
Ever hear of the time-space continuum?
Sounds important, doesn't it? Well, it is.

567
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:32,375
You want to know something, Esther?
It's broken! Okay?

568
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:34,131
And I'm the only guy who can fix it.

569
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:37,349
So why don't you go down the hall there
and get on your little telephone...

570
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:39,356
...and call Dr. Feinstein...

571
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:41,780
- Goodnight, Mr. Besser.
- You tell him that...

572
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,292
You tell him that I...

573
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:54,697
<i>Point the toes, pull your shoulders back.</i>

574
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:58,249
<i>Take a deep breath in and then exhale
into downward-facing dog.</i>

575
00:47:04,603 --> 00:47:07,404
Oh, be quiet!
Be quiet... oh!

576
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:23,999
Bart, shut up!

577
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:29,140
- That thing is a damned hazard!
- It's just a toaster!

578
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:33,570
Well, insertion of bread into that
so-called toaster produces
no toast at all...

579
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:36,663
...merely warm bread!
Inserting the bread
twice produces charcoal.

580
00:47:36,747 --> 00:47:40,217
So, clearly, to make proper toast
it requires one and a half insertions...

581
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,142
...which is something for which
the apparatus doesn't begin to allow!

582
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:48,577
One assumes that when the
General of Electric built it
he might have tried using it.

583
00:47:48,786 --> 00:47:52,004
One assumes the General might
take pride in his creations...

584
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:54,596
...instead of just foisting them
on an unsuspecting public.

585
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,933
You know something?

586
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:59,110
Nobody gives a rat's ass...

587
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:02,580
...that you have to push
the toast down twice.
You know why?

588
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:06,132
Because everybody pushes
their toast down twice!

589
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,679
Not where I come from.

590
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,145
Oh, because where you come from...

591
00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:13,656
...toast is the result
of reflection and study.

592
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,037
Yes, you mock me.

593
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,059
But perhaps one day,
when you've awoken
from a pleasant slumber...

594
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,224
...to the scent of a warm brioche smothered
in marmalade and fresh creamery butter...

595
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:26,238
...you'll understand that life
is not solely comprised
of tasks, but tastes.

596
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:29,373
Say that again.

597
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:34,097
Pardon me?

598
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:36,814
- Did they start yet?
- Yes.

599
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,652
Session list.

600
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:41,621
Leopold, Darci.
Darci, Leopold.

601
00:48:41,704 --> 00:48:44,087
I'll like him to read.
Can you tack him on at the end?

602
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,514
And, Leopold, go with Darci.
She'll take you to the greenroom
and explain everything.

603
00:48:48,434 --> 00:48:50,441
I need to work out.
I need a place I can work out.

604
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:52,655
If I could get Mr. Duke?
Is he ready? Where is he?

605
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,665
Oh, my God, look at this.
Let's skip this one.

606
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,173
Mr. Duke, right here on the floor.

607
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:01,726
Excuse me, that's your mark, right there.
Just stand on that tape line.

608
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:04,694
Look, forget this guy.
I can't waste any more time, J.J.

609
00:49:04,777 --> 00:49:06,784
We need to make a decision now.

610
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:09,835
All right, we've got
plenty of good choices.
Let's cut it off, Kate.

611
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,093
That would be a mistake, J.J.

612
00:49:12,803 --> 00:49:15,102
Kate, the client wants to move on.

613
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,195
We should see this last guy.
It'll... Two minutes!

614
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,704
I think he looks like the Quaker Oats guy.

615
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:25,134
Well, Phil, it's really not
about what you think.
It's about what they think.

616
00:49:25,217 --> 00:49:27,851
They've been in a coma
all day and now look at them.

617
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:31,487
To them, this guy is a dream.

618
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:35,041
He's handsome, honest, courteous.

619
00:49:35,124 --> 00:49:39,137
Stands when you walk in a room.
Brings you brioche in bed.

620
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:41,644
If you eat his margarine...

621
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,198
...maybe your hips will shrink
and he'll come to your door.

622
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:49,573
I take it this is to be delivered
in direct address as on Geronimo.

623
00:49:49,574 --> 00:49:51,998
- Geronimo?
- He means Geraldo.

624
00:49:52,596 --> 00:49:53,600
Exactly.

625
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:57,947
Okay, everyone... quiet please.
And action.

626
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:05,763
Start talking, bud.

627
00:50:08,229 --> 00:50:10,695
Fresh creamery butter.

628
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:14,081
Is there anything more comforting?

629
00:50:15,173 --> 00:50:16,595
I say there is.

630
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:20,738
And perhaps you'll agree when you sample
fat-free Farmer's Bounty...

631
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,614
...with the genuine essence
of creamery butter in every bite.

632
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:28,667
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty
you shall receive butter's...

633
00:50:28,836 --> 00:50:33,559
...luxurious comfort in your mouth
without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

634
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,134
Not bad, Kate.
Where'd you find him?

635
00:50:38,223 --> 00:50:39,602
He lives in my building.

636
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:43,394
Where do I sign?
Right here, and here.

637
00:50:46,768 --> 00:50:49,110
- That was spectacular, Kate.
- Thanks, J.J.

638
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:51,617
A lot to talk about tonight at dinner.

639
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:56,174
- Nice work, Mr. Margarine.
- Thank you.

640
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,353
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.

641
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:05,161
Yes!

642
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,543
Yes! Yes!

643
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:09,592
Yes!

644
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:18,400
- You seem pleased.
- Oh, you did so great in there!

645
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:19,542
Man!

646
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,331
You are going to be on a
national television spot!

647
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:29,730
I take it you're dining
with that man tonight.

648
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,056
Huh? Oh, yeah, J.J.
He's my boss.

649
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:36,971
You require a chaperone.
His intentions are obvious.

650
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:39,353
I'm alone with you.
Do I need a chaperone?

651
00:51:39,438 --> 00:51:42,322
We're not courting, Kate.
If we were, as a man of honor...

652
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:44,789
...I would have informed you
of my intentions in writing.

653
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:05,688
Good day.

654
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:08,823
Hey!

655
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:12,543
- Kate, why don't we take one of these.
- They're for tourists.

656
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,392
- Sorry, she doesn't seem interested.
- Oh, hey, hello. Hello.

657
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:20,401
Hey! Hey!

658
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,540
Hey! Hey, you...

659
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,424
Kate!

660
00:52:27,759 --> 00:52:29,848
Hey, you asshole!

661
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,407
I'm going to get you!

662
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:51,124
Hey! Asshole!

663
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,551
Goddamn it.

664
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:10,936
- Give me your hand.
- What?

665
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,232
Your hand, woman!

666
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:31,586
What do you think you're doing?

667
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,739
I warn you, scoundrel
I was trained to ride
at the King's Academy...

668
00:54:06,823 --> 00:54:09,750
...and schooled in weaponry
by the palace guard.
You stand no chance.

669
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:14,682
Where you run, I shall ride and when
you stop, the steel of this strap
will be lodged in your brain.

670
00:54:39,427 --> 00:54:41,684
Your boyfriend's a very good rider.

671
00:54:42,144 --> 00:54:43,147
Yeah.

672
00:55:03,044 --> 00:55:04,423
Are you for real?

673
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,472
Pardon me?

674
00:55:07,267 --> 00:55:08,646
Are you for real?

675
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:11,363
I believe so.

676
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:14,372
You're a duke.

677
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,343
I was born a duke.

678
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,601
I've never felt like one.

679
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:28,834
Stay. Sit.

680
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:32,011
On your feet. Stay.

681
00:55:38,658 --> 00:55:39,661
Stay.

682
00:55:40,748 --> 00:55:41,750
Good boy.

683
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:51,908
I'm off to dinner.
What are you two doing?

684
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:56,088
I don't know. Maybe we'll
watch the rest of the game
or go out or something.

685
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:57,149
Oh, thank you.

686
00:55:58,053 --> 00:56:01,605
Kate, may I repeat my offer
to serve as a chaperone?

687
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,532
No, thank you, Leopold.

688
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:06,914
Charles, don't you find this inappropriate?
As her brother, I would think...

689
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:11,094
As her brother, I would think
that my sister would
invite me to an audition.

690
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:13,351
Could be just me, though.
Seems kind, but...

691
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:14,688
Charlie.

692
00:56:15,734 --> 00:56:17,741
You're not exactly
a margarine spokesperson.

693
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:20,290
- I can't sell butter, Kate?
- I don't mean to be insulting...

694
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:23,217
It's insulting. I'm an actor.
You don't have faith in me to sell butter?

695
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,220
No. No. I'm sorry.

696
00:56:24,303 --> 00:56:25,933
I can do British, Kate. I'm an actor.

697
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:28,148
- I can be anybody!
- You're a very, very good actor.

698
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:30,058
- I am a good actor.
- You are.
- Okay, fine.

699
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:33,361
all right.
A Victorian dude who's never...

700
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:36,299
- ...seen a Mets game watching TV.
- Okay.

701
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:40,271
Scene... I say, are those little people
in that box of phosphorous?

702
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:44,117
Crikey, I believe it is!
This game's more beguiling than cricket!

703
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:49,215
Good golly, oh, Jesus!
It looks like Mike Piazza just hit a game!

704
00:56:49,675 --> 00:56:54,105
<i>How about Canadian? Oh, right on.
Right on, you like butter, huh?
Yeah, what's that aboot?</i>

705
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,168
- Good night.
- Good night.

706
00:56:58,453 --> 00:57:03,762
<i>...all those people up in that stadium.
Know what they probably could go for?
Some margarine!</i>

707
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:08,903
When your friend walked in
in that outfit I was getting
a little nervous for you there.

708
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:14,713
"If you eat his margarine,
maybe your hips will shrink."
It's brilliant.

709
00:57:14,797 --> 00:57:16,804
You saved Phil from his own ambivalence.

710
00:57:16,887 --> 00:57:20,022
I knew it was the way to go... in my gut.

711
00:57:20,606 --> 00:57:22,572
I'm counting on that gut.

712
00:57:22,714 --> 00:57:26,101
Can I get a bottle of your
95 Lynch-Bages and a bottle of Evian?

713
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,599
I'll tell you one thing... your
friend is going to be bigger
than Mr. Whipple.

714
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:34,275
You're not sleeping with him, are you?

715
00:57:35,195 --> 00:57:36,199
No.

716
00:57:37,723 --> 00:57:38,726
No.

717
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:44,851
Leo. Leo, come on. Come here.

718
00:57:46,022 --> 00:57:47,024
How's it going, man?

719
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:56,072
See the girl with the long brown hair?
That's Patrice.

720
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:59,606
- She's lovely.
- She's mine.

721
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:00,860
Congratulations.

722
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:15,031
Hey, everybody, this is Leo!
Leo, this is everybody.

723
00:58:15,114 --> 00:58:17,078
- What's up? Dennis.
- Hello.

724
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:19,420
Shelby, Allison, Monica.

725
00:58:19,627 --> 00:58:23,348
And this,
this is the insatiable Patrice.

726
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,953
- Hey, Charlie.. Hey.
- How do you do?

727
00:58:26,954 --> 00:58:29,211
- Patrice, let me assist you.
- Thanks.

728
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:32,711
You got it?
I was going to get it.

729
00:58:38,603 --> 00:58:40,401
Let me get that for you.

730
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:44,834
There you go.

731
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:47,367
You look nice tonight. Very...

732
00:58:49,004 --> 00:58:50,634
Like a Judy Blume book.

733
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:57,415
That's good, because I thought for a moment
that body of water here was a moat.

734
00:58:57,583 --> 00:59:01,261
No, that's a pond.
The gardens are devastating.

735
00:59:01,386 --> 00:59:04,145
They are.
They're very, very beautiful. Ooh.

736
00:59:04,576 --> 00:59:07,418
- You'll have to come
and see them firsthand.
- Right, right.

737
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:11,294
After the merger I'm going to be stuck
over there, setting things up.

738
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:15,557
I'll be craving a little face time
from my new top honcho in New York.

739
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:20,113
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you should come visit.

740
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:23,708
- I'll fly you over for the weekend.
- Oh, yeah, I heard that.

741
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:28,013
The other part... the part before that.
The part about the top honcho.

742
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,062
I didn't understand that, that part.

743
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,326
How about catching an opera Saturday?
La Boheme's at the Met.

744
00:59:36,123 --> 00:59:38,589
Okay, so she comes back...
the audience is about to leave...

745
00:59:38,672 --> 00:59:42,560
...she comes back on stage and she
starts squirting the audience
with this turkey baster...

746
00:59:42,643 --> 00:59:44,065
...filled with this pine mist.

747
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:47,409
And she's screaming
"Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"

748
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:51,170
But no tears.
Just raw human passion.

749
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,300
- Isn't Willem Dafoe part of that group?
- Yeah, and he did this
monologue about how...

750
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:58,819
...all the best things in life are
hidden in people's basements.

751
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,283
Like the Louvre.

752
01:00:04,923 --> 01:00:06,762
I'm sorry.
You were saying, Charles?

753
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,270
- Just...
- No, what about the Louvre?

754
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:11,527
Tell us what you were going to say.

755
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:12,698
Well...

756
01:00:12,781 --> 01:00:16,000
...only a fraction of the
Louvre is on the walls.
The rest is in the basement.

757
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:18,758
- You've been in the
basement of the Louvre?
- Oh, yes.

758
01:00:19,469 --> 01:00:21,727
I was an art history major at Vassar.

759
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:25,154
And so, what's down there?

760
01:00:25,237 --> 01:00:30,212
Well, that's where the real show begins.
Unspoiled by dilettante.

761
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:34,934
DaVinci, Michelangelo, David, Chardin.

762
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,535
"Allow me to assist you, Patrice.
Oh, let me light that for you, Monica."

763
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:46,127
"What, this? This is my family crest.
Been in the family for..."
Oh, in the basement?

764
01:00:46,128 --> 01:00:48,812
"What do they have in the basement?
Why, the works of da Vinci...

765
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:51,696
...Michelangelo, Chardin, David...

766
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:56,546
...all surrounded by great coral
sponges to absorb the moisture."

767
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:00,417
Just for the record, I was working it.

768
01:01:00,418 --> 01:01:03,459
I was in the zone and I
would have gotten her number

769
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,788
if you hadn't turned the evening
into a guided tour of the Louvre.

770
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,336
My apologies.

771
01:01:10,255 --> 01:01:14,896
Let's get one thing straight. Patrice,
she thought you were cute...
probably gay and cute.

772
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:17,780
- And cute, Leo, that's the kiss of death.
- Perhaps.

773
01:01:17,863 --> 01:01:20,915
- Perhaps? Certainly.
- I believe this is her number.

774
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,094
As I see it, Patrice has not an inkling of
your affections. And it's no wonder.

775
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:27,352
You, Charles, are a merry-andrew.

776
01:01:27,895 --> 01:01:30,402
- A what?
- Everything plays a farce to you.

777
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,577
Women respond to sincerity.

778
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:35,432
This requires pulling
one's tongue from one's cheek.

779
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:39,222
No one wants to be romanced by a buffoon.

780
01:01:39,223 --> 01:01:41,982
- Now, that number rings her.
- Yes.

781
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:46,441
- So ring her tomorrow.
- I can't. She gave the number to you.

782
01:01:46,442 --> 01:01:49,695
Only because I told her of your affections.

783
01:01:50,216 --> 01:01:52,307
Wha-What did you say?

784
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,065
Merely that you admired her
but you were hesitant
to make an overture...

785
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:57,949
...since you'll been told
she was courting another.

786
01:01:58,492 --> 01:02:00,708
Shit. That's good!

787
01:02:01,377 --> 01:02:04,679
- Wha-What did she say?
- She handed me the napkin.

788
01:02:08,399 --> 01:02:11,994
- Charles, it's quite late.
- No, no, no, she won't be home yet.

789
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:15,088
I get her machine,
I leave a message ball's in her court.

790
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:20,186
You're ladling calculation upon comedy.
The point is, to keep
the ball in your court.

791
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:24,367
You're right. You're right.

792
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:27,836
- Okay.
- Nothing need be done till tomorrow.

793
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,511
Tomorrow.
Then I make my move.

794
01:02:30,594 --> 01:02:34,106
An overture, Charles.
Make your intentions known.

795
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:37,073
Think of pleasing her, not vexing her.

796
01:02:37,158 --> 01:02:38,370
No vexing.

797
01:02:38,495 --> 01:02:42,131
You're intoxicated. We should retire.
I'm sure Kate will be home.

798
01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:45,058
- I doubt it.
- But it's nearly midnight.

799
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:50,199
- You like her, don't you?
- Who?

800
01:02:50,492 --> 01:02:51,495
Kate.

801
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:54,295
- You do!
- Oh, Charles, Charles.

802
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:56,259
You like my sister!

803
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:58,976
Well, you made your
intentions known, right?
Right?

804
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:02,906
- You've been drinking.
- Leo, Commune... right around the corner.

805
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:05,497
We could stop in,
you could give me a couple of pointers...

806
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,674
...pull out a chair or two you could
throw out a gesture here or there.

807
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:11,599
Yeah, see, it's one thing with Patrice.
You don't give a shit.

808
01:03:11,683 --> 01:03:15,446
It's a whole other ball of wax
when it's a girl you like, huh?

809
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:18,488
Yeah, who's the merry-andrew now?

810
01:03:21,226 --> 01:03:23,777
You want to vex my sister!

811
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:28,070
I have to confess that
I'm a little bit confused.

812
01:03:28,823 --> 01:03:30,035
No. Thank you.

813
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,884
When you asked me to dinner tonight
I was under the impression
that we were here to discuss...

814
01:03:34,967 --> 01:03:38,060
- The merger.
- Yes. Right. Yes.

815
01:03:38,394 --> 01:03:41,446
- And a possible promotion.
- Yes.

816
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:43,536
Yes, that, too.

817
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:48,594
And, well, dinner is winding down
and we haven't really discussed...

818
01:03:48,844 --> 01:03:52,439
...anything even remotely relevant
to what I thought we came here to...

819
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:57,288
I don't believe I've ever
seen you this flustered, Kate.
You haven't even kissed me yet.

820
01:03:59,504 --> 01:04:01,719
Yeah.
Right. Well...

821
01:04:02,848 --> 01:04:05,356
I like you, J.J., I do.
I like you quite a bit.

822
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:09,452
Um, as a matter of fact
I think you would agree that a working...

823
01:04:09,536 --> 01:04:13,382
...a successful working relationship
requires a great deal of...

824
01:04:13,673 --> 01:04:16,516
What exactly is our working relationship?

825
01:04:16,684 --> 01:04:17,937
Hi, Kate!

826
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:20,445
Hi, Charlie.

827
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:23,329
Well... what are you doing here?

828
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,340
- We just thought we'll
come by to say hi. J.J., right?
- Right.

829
01:04:26,423 --> 01:04:28,889
- Kate. Might I have a word with you?
- Now?

830
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:32,232
- In private.
- No! No.

831
01:04:32,317 --> 01:04:34,072
Mr. Margarine.

832
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:37,374
Please... please join us.

833
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:40,425
- And where did you say it is?
- In Sussex.

834
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,056
- Near Ballmour.
- Yes.

835
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:44,940
- Built in the 18th century.
- Early 18th century.

836
01:04:45,023 --> 01:04:47,029
Really? Are you quite sure?

837
01:04:49,162 --> 01:04:51,628
- Yes.
- He's got pictures, Leopold.

838
01:04:51,712 --> 01:04:53,843
Perhaps you were swindled,
because I can assure you...

839
01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:57,396
...as of the late 19th century
there's nothing but farmland near Ballmour.

840
01:04:57,479 --> 01:04:59,403
- You're mistaken.
- That's not possible.

841
01:04:59,485 --> 01:05:02,455
Well, it's quite possible,
Leopold, that you are mistaken.

842
01:05:02,538 --> 01:05:05,422
No, it is not.

843
01:05:05,505 --> 01:05:08,599
...the only manor house in the county.
I know because I grew up there.

844
01:05:08,682 --> 01:05:10,898
Leopold, it wasn't...

845
01:05:11,065 --> 01:05:13,447
- Leo, do you enjoy opera?
- I do. And do you?

846
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,373
Oh, yes.
It keeps... keeps me alive.

847
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:20,302
- Do you have a favorite?
- Boheme. La Boheme.

848
01:05:20,637 --> 01:05:25,110
I've seen it 12 times.
That's... that's how
I learned to speak French.

849
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:27,367
- You speak French?
- Fluently.

850
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:38,611
What did he say?

851
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:47,639
"How sweet your face looks gently
encircled by the soft moonlight."

852
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,482
Oh, I like that.

853
01:05:50,565 --> 01:05:53,993
From the opening scene of Boheme.
A stunning duet.

854
01:05:54,202 --> 01:05:57,128
- Andre sings it to Mimi.
- Andre...

855
01:05:57,588 --> 01:06:00,263
I invited Kate to the Met next week.
She's never been.

856
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:03,857
Patrone is singing Andre,
and she turned me down.

857
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:06,114
Can you explain that, Leopold?

858
01:06:07,202 --> 01:06:08,205
Well...

859
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:12,468
La Boheme is one of man's
great achievements and
should not be missed.

860
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:15,844
But perhaps Kate resists on moral grounds.

861
01:06:16,163 --> 01:06:17,166
How so?

862
01:06:17,442 --> 01:06:19,490
- Should we get the check?
- Well...

863
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,040
...some feel that to court
a woman in one's employ...

864
01:06:22,124 --> 01:06:26,555
...is nothing more than a serpentine effort
to transform a lady to a whore.

865
01:06:30,944 --> 01:06:31,988
J.J.

866
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:38,342
This guy's charming, Kate.

867
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,066
The Duke of Margarine thinks me a serpent.

868
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,490
- No, he doesn't.
- No, not a serpent.

869
01:06:45,573 --> 01:06:48,542
That's too grand a word.
Simply a braggart and a cad...

870
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:51,802
...who knows less French
than I, if that's possible.

871
01:06:53,558 --> 01:06:57,946
And by the way there's
no Andre in Boheme...
it's Rudolfo.

872
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:00,957
And though it takes place in France
it's rarely played in French...

873
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,634
...as it is written in Italian.
Good night.

874
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:14,490
Sorry.

875
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:27,549
Kate, might I have a word?

876
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,646
- Morning.
- Hi.

877
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,740
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

878
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:33,000
- You want to read...
you want to read your paper?
- No, thank you, Charlie.

879
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:36,720
I want to go to work and try and
clean up this mess you made.

880
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:38,769
You sure you don't...

881
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:50,054
Kate...
Uh, Kate!

882
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,196
- What?
- I-I just thought maybe you'll want
a-a kiwi for-for-for the subway.

883
01:08:55,822 --> 01:09:00,002
- That's a papaya, Charlie.
- Oh. You're right. Okay.

884
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:04,955
But while using the product...

885
01:09:04,956 --> 01:09:08,856
...80% found the product too soft to be...

886
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:10,787
<i>...effective.</i>

887
01:09:10,871 --> 01:09:14,884
<i>This, of course, presents a conundrum
for us marketeers.</i>

888
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:22,495
<i>How do we maintain a soft feel
on the exterior of a plastic wrap
or pack while retaining...</i>

889
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:27,255
<i>...the useful tensile strength
in the sheets?</i>

890
01:09:27,256 --> 01:09:29,554
<i>Now, I'm going to suggest
to the Summer Soft people...</i>

891
01:09:29,639 --> 01:09:32,052
<i>...to scale back to a limited
release of the product...</i>

892
01:09:32,053 --> 01:09:36,033
<i>...in the mid-Atlantic states,
where we can refine the product...</i>

893
01:09:36,034 --> 01:09:38,118
<i>...on the basis of extensive...</i>

894
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:42,555
<i>Dearest Katherine...</i>

895
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:45,983
<i>I behaved as an imbecile last night...</i>

896
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:48,448
<i>...animated in part by drink...</i>

897
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:52,838
<i>...in part by your beauty and
in part by my own foolish pride.</i>

898
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:56,181
<i>And for that I am profoundly sorry.</i>

899
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:58,690
<i>Please accept as a gesture of apology...</i>

900
01:09:58,773 --> 01:10:02,200
<i>...a private dinner on the
rooftop tonight at 8:00.</i>

901
01:10:04,207 --> 01:10:06,548
<i>Okay, where are we on Farmer's Bounty?</i>

902
01:10:07,092 --> 01:10:08,094
<i>Kate?</i>

903
01:10:09,098 --> 01:10:10,812
<i>Care to share with us?</i>

904
01:10:13,069 --> 01:10:14,490
Farmer's Bounty?

905
01:10:14,866 --> 01:10:16,120
Where we are.

906
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:18,796
Where we are is good.

907
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:21,721
Um, as you know,
we found our spokesperson.

908
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:25,609
The response room final showed
a 96 in the top two boxes.

909
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:28,410
His key female descriptors...

910
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:32,924
were "handsome", "romantic"
with several write-ins of...

911
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:34,804
"What a hunk."

912
01:10:38,065 --> 01:10:39,068
Great.

913
01:10:44,836 --> 01:10:45,840
J.J.?

914
01:10:46,216 --> 01:10:47,111
J.J., hi.

915
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:49,581
Um, listen, I just want to apologize again

916
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:54,418
for what happened last night.
There was no need
for things to get that way.

917
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:55,955
I appreciate that.

918
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:58,421
So... everything's okay?

919
01:10:59,592 --> 01:11:00,637
Yes, Kate.

920
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,928
I didn't jump; I fell.

921
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,754
There's a difference...
a subtle difference,
but nonetheless a difference.

922
01:11:08,795 --> 01:11:11,882
- So, why did you fall down there?
- Because there was no elevator.

923
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,498
And you feel that was your fault?

924
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:14,619
Look...

925
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,097
You know what, I'm sorry.

926
01:11:30,098 --> 01:11:33,374
I got to concede that you
are a very busy man...

927
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,803
...and I'm sure there are plenty
of people clamoring for your
particular brand of attention.

928
01:11:36,886 --> 01:11:38,767
Unfortunately, I am not one of them.

929
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:42,404
So if you don't mind,
would you please unlock this door?

930
01:11:42,487 --> 01:11:45,036
I'm concerned you might
be a danger to yourself.

931
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,381
And in such cases...

932
01:11:48,464 --> 01:11:52,644
- Will someone please open... Aah! Aah!
- ...state law requires
that I keep you under...

933
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:56,657
Fuck!

934
01:11:57,828 --> 01:11:59,960
Everything all right, Dr. Geisler?

935
01:12:00,044 --> 01:12:02,468
Yes, Gretchen. Everything's fine.

936
01:12:03,973 --> 01:12:08,445
Stuart, I'm going to prescribe
something called Prolixin.

937
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:12,332
It's a mild antipsychotic.
Nothing too strong.

938
01:12:16,554 --> 01:12:19,981
"I was wondering... I was wondering
if you would like to accompany me..."

939
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:23,744
"If you've already been
previously engaged I understand."

940
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:29,554
Tonight at 7:00, 7:30.
Please don't be late.

941
01:12:31,978 --> 01:12:35,406
I got to talk to you about this, okay?
’Cause there's some shit
here that just cannot be said.

942
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:38,080
Did you assemble a bouquet for Patrice?

943
01:12:38,165 --> 01:12:41,467
Look, you just can't tell a woman she's...
"gracefully serene".

944
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,306
No, no, this will not do.

945
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,023
Wha... Why?
What is wrong with this one?

946
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:49,075
The orange lily implies extreme hatred.

947
01:12:49,158 --> 01:12:52,586
The begonia and lavender
danger and suspicion, respectively.

948
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:55,177
Every flower has a meaning, Charles.

949
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,768
Might I suggest the amaryllis...

950
01:12:57,852 --> 01:13:01,196
...which declares the recipient
a most splendid beauty.

951
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:03,704
Or the cabbage rose.

952
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:10,583
Darci!

953
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:17,456
- What is this?
- It's a reply to Leopold's invitation.

954
01:13:18,836 --> 01:13:20,090
You're going, right?

955
01:13:20,174 --> 01:13:21,745
I haven't decided yet.

956
01:13:21,746 --> 01:13:24,797
Oh, you haven't decided if you want
to have dinner on your rooftop with a duke?

957
01:13:25,566 --> 01:13:29,118
Who thinks he's from 1876! No!

958
01:13:29,203 --> 01:13:32,004
- And I would appreciate it if...
- Kate, come on, okay?

959
01:13:32,005 --> 01:13:33,853
I don't know what
this guy did to piss you off...

960
01:13:33,854 --> 01:13:36,571
...but that is the best apology letter
in the history of mankind.

961
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:40,257
Just sign it, Kate.
It's 4:30. We'll fax it.

962
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:43,957
Kate McKay's office.

963
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,298
They hung up.

964
01:13:49,516 --> 01:13:51,231
Hi. Is Patrice there?

965
01:13:52,653 --> 01:13:54,035
Hey, Patrice?

966
01:13:54,036 --> 01:13:56,251
Hi. It's me, Charlie.

967
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,757
- Hey, Charlie.
- I was just calling to find out...

968
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:03,269
...if you got my flowers... your flowers.

969
01:14:03,938 --> 01:14:06,237
I was calling to see if you got
the flowers I sent you.

970
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,533
Yeah, I did.

971
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:11,671
And I was just wondering if you would
like to go to a movie tonight...

972
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:16,059
...and maybe afterwards perhaps
accompany me to dinner?

973
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:20,072
I mean, I...
I understand completely
if you're otherwise engaged.

974
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:23,960
But, uh, you know,
I just wanted to say that, um...

975
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:26,133
Yeah?

976
01:14:30,606 --> 01:14:33,406
I wanted to say that you've, uh...

977
01:14:35,246 --> 01:14:37,294
...you've made an impression on me.

978
01:14:40,261 --> 01:14:42,126
And-and it-it's not
just the way you look...

979
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:47,059
I mean, which are great. Your looks are,
you know, top-top shelf. But, uh...

980
01:14:51,256 --> 01:14:53,345
I don't know, it's, um...

981
01:14:54,934 --> 01:14:55,936
What?

982
01:14:59,196 --> 01:15:00,367
You're graceful.

983
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:04,380
You know, the way you move and speak.

984
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:09,313
I mean, some people have a way
with words and, you know, you...

985
01:15:09,898 --> 01:15:10,902
...you do.

986
01:15:13,869 --> 01:15:16,418
The bottom line is, I like you.

987
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:23,148
Patrice?

988
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:25,572
What about 7:00?

989
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:28,791
7:00?

990
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:31,758
7:00 would be heaven. Okay.

991
01:15:31,843 --> 01:15:33,723
See you then.

992
01:15:34,467 --> 01:15:36,808
It worked! It worked cool!

993
01:15:37,029 --> 01:15:41,167
Who's going out with Patrice?
Charlie's going out with Patrice!
Charlie's going over there.

994
01:15:41,594 --> 01:15:44,009
Oh, better go get ready.
Better go get changed.

995
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:47,743
Shouldn't change too much, though
’cause she likes me for who I am.

996
01:15:55,925 --> 01:15:58,391
- Hey.
- Charlie, you look fantastic.

997
01:15:58,512 --> 01:15:59,808
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

998
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:02,734
I got a date.
I got to go.

999
01:16:03,068 --> 01:16:04,572
- Bye.
- Bye.

1000
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,591
- Kate?
- Yeah?

1001
01:16:12,347 --> 01:16:13,686
Um, have a good time tonight.

1002
01:16:15,524 --> 01:16:16,528
Bye.

1003
01:17:03,301 --> 01:17:04,639
My God.

1004
01:17:08,234 --> 01:17:09,614
This is beautiful.

1005
01:17:11,536 --> 01:17:13,834
The very word for which I was searching.

1006
01:17:16,677 --> 01:17:17,680
May I?

1007
01:17:36,825 --> 01:17:38,747
She was a real romantic, my mom.

1008
01:17:38,832 --> 01:17:41,799
When Prince Charles and Lady Di
got married, she had a party.

1009
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:44,558
She made crumpets and jam.

1010
01:17:44,641 --> 01:17:47,776
It was like a Super Bowl party,
but for moms.

1011
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:49,657
She cried for a week.

1012
01:17:49,741 --> 01:17:52,499
I don't know the story
of Prince Charles and Lady Di.

1013
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:56,303
Oh, you don't want to.
It's a cautionary tale. Further proof.

1014
01:17:56,428 --> 01:17:58,937
- Of what?
- You can't live a fairy tale.

1015
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:20,589
I'm not very good with men.

1016
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,022
Perhaps you haven't found the right one.

1017
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:33,464
Maybe.

1018
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:37,477
Or, uh, maybe the whole love
thing is just a grown-up
version of Santa Claus...

1019
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,779
just a myth we've
been fed since childhood...

1020
01:18:40,904 --> 01:18:45,125
...so we keep buying magazines
and joining clubs...

1021
01:18:45,502 --> 01:18:48,762
...and doing therapy and
watching movies with hit pop songs...

1022
01:18:48,845 --> 01:18:50,559
...played over love montages...

1023
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,524
...all in this pathetic attempt...

1024
01:18:52,607 --> 01:18:56,285
...to explain why our love Santa
keeps getting caught in the chimney..

1025
01:18:59,463 --> 01:19:02,012
Otis always told me love is a leap.

1026
01:19:03,309 --> 01:19:06,528
Lamentably, I was never inspired to jump.

1027
01:19:08,659 --> 01:19:13,675
By my 30th birthday, I had,
according to my uncle, become
a blemish on the family name.

1028
01:19:14,093 --> 01:19:17,813
So he brought me to this country
with the proviso I marry an American.

1029
01:19:17,897 --> 01:19:20,990
A girl with a good deal of, um...

1030
01:19:22,328 --> 01:19:23,331
Charm?

1031
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,128
Money.

1032
01:19:25,797 --> 01:19:29,768
Since my parents died our family fortune
had become, shall we say, depleted.

1033
01:19:31,022 --> 01:19:35,787
I would be married now
if I hadn't followed Stuart.
I was to announce a bride that night.

1034
01:19:37,919 --> 01:19:38,922
Who?

1035
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:44,481
I don't know.

1036
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:49,414
Someone.
One of them.

1037
01:20:01,619 --> 01:20:02,790
What are you doing?

1038
01:20:03,134 --> 01:20:05,005
I'm just cleaning up.

1039
01:20:05,974 --> 01:20:07,973
Would you do me the honor of a dance?

1040
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:11,192
Please?

1041
01:20:40,032 --> 01:20:41,956
I am not much of a dancer.

1042
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:44,087
You're doing famously, then.

1043
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:03,148
Leopold...

1044
01:21:04,361 --> 01:21:05,698
...this was lovely.

1045
01:21:07,286 --> 01:21:12,177
But I don't know if I can leap
even if I am inspired.

1046
01:21:14,282 --> 01:21:16,915
People might think I'm brave, but I'm not.

1047
01:21:17,621 --> 01:21:20,186
The brave are simply those
with the clearest vision...

1048
01:21:20,187 --> 01:21:22,008
...of what is before them.

1049
01:21:22,009 --> 01:21:26,299
Glory and danger alike and
notwithstanding, go out to meet it.

1050
01:21:47,205 --> 01:21:48,209
Hey.

1051
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:49,688
Morning, Charles.

1052
01:21:50,425 --> 01:21:52,139
How was your evening with Patrice?

1053
01:21:52,906 --> 01:21:53,909
Good.

1054
01:21:54,579 --> 01:21:55,581
Nice.

1055
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:57,740
How was yours?

1056
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,663
Good.

1057
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,417
Nice.

1058
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:16,591
So, Leo, don't you think it's
time you tell me who you are?

1059
01:22:18,849 --> 01:22:20,814
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1060
01:22:21,148 --> 01:22:24,700
...it's a blast doing the
duke thing with you 24/7, but...

1061
01:22:25,494 --> 01:22:28,379
...I don't want to see
Kate go through Stuart:
The Sequel.

1062
01:22:28,797 --> 01:22:31,765
I know she seems pretty tough
but she hasn't had it that easy.

1063
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:35,443
She's always getting
stuck with people who
don't hold up their end.

1064
01:22:36,279 --> 01:22:37,283
Like me.

1065
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,211
- I just don't...
- I understand, Charles.

1066
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:43,678
- You do?
- Yes.

1067
01:22:44,262 --> 01:22:45,266
So...

1068
01:22:46,854 --> 01:22:47,857
...who are you?

1069
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,461
I am the man who loves your sister.

1070
01:23:02,404 --> 01:23:03,908
Okay, door's open.

1071
01:23:04,661 --> 01:23:06,082
Shut the lid.

1072
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:07,963
Push the drawers in.

1073
01:23:08,924 --> 01:23:10,305
Close the door, and...

1074
01:23:10,805 --> 01:23:12,311
...you push this button.

1075
01:23:12,436 --> 01:23:16,031
A word to the wise:
Don't press that till she wakes up.

1076
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,204
So she sees you doing it.

1077
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:20,962
Oh, clever.
The proverbial tree in the woods.

1078
01:23:21,047 --> 01:23:23,095
If a man washes a dish
and no one sees it...

1079
01:23:23,179 --> 01:23:24,850
- Did it happen?
- Right.

1080
01:23:38,394 --> 01:23:40,776
- A cup of coffee, my dear.
- Thank you.

1081
01:23:44,078 --> 01:23:45,081
Breakfast?

1082
01:23:52,313 --> 01:23:56,075
Nine-grain toast with strawberries
and mascarpone, madame.

1083
01:23:58,248 --> 01:23:59,252
It's...

1084
01:23:59,461 --> 01:24:01,300
...apparently low...

1085
01:24:02,386 --> 01:24:04,059
...in polyunsaturates.

1086
01:24:14,676 --> 01:24:15,846
It's really good.

1087
01:24:18,104 --> 01:24:19,190
It's good.

1088
01:24:23,453 --> 01:24:25,042
What should we do today?

1089
01:24:31,312 --> 01:24:33,569
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

1090
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:36,160
Thank you. No.

1091
01:24:38,418 --> 01:24:41,302
You know what makes me happy?
You don't look good in those.

1092
01:24:41,385 --> 01:24:44,772
They're so completely
inappropriate for you.

1093
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:05,087
Kate.

1094
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:06,967
Kate, Kate, come.

1095
01:25:10,144 --> 01:25:11,189
Leopold?

1096
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:13,153
Leopold?

1097
01:25:13,656 --> 01:25:16,498
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It boggles the mind
that it is still here.

1098
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:19,758
This is my uncle's home.
Well, was. This is where I lived.

1099
01:25:19,925 --> 01:25:20,971
Good Lord.

1100
01:25:21,054 --> 01:25:23,938
A portrait of my parents... and me.

1101
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:28,410
Uh... uh, Leopold?

1102
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:34,263
Look, I just don't think that we should
just be barging around here like that.

1103
01:25:35,558 --> 01:25:36,562
Leopold?

1104
01:25:50,523 --> 01:25:51,860
My old quarters.

1105
01:26:03,355 --> 01:26:04,651
What are you doing?

1106
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:17,734
The place where I put
everything I most cared for.

1107
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:25,718
Things I didn't want my uncle to touch.

1108
01:26:36,503 --> 01:26:37,839
My mother's ring.

1109
01:26:40,098 --> 01:26:41,644
Oh, it's beautiful.

1110
01:26:52,554 --> 01:26:54,643
You know, I live on an island...

1111
01:26:55,897 --> 01:26:58,447
...connected to everything by bridges...

1112
01:26:59,074 --> 01:27:01,039
...and I never cross them.

1113
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:05,227
I've lived here for ten years, and I've...

1114
01:27:05,668 --> 01:27:08,176
...never been to the other side
of anything.

1115
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,778
You've never traveled?

1116
01:27:11,697 --> 01:27:12,701
No.

1117
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:26,704
Do you...

1118
01:27:27,707 --> 01:27:28,711
What?

1119
01:27:32,527 --> 01:27:34,813
Do you miss where you're from?

1120
01:27:43,054 --> 01:27:44,259
In a way, I...

1121
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:46,809
I miss...

1122
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,213
I miss its rhythm.

1123
01:27:51,338 --> 01:27:52,550
It was slower?

1124
01:27:53,914 --> 01:27:55,335
Quite a bit slower.

1125
01:27:56,206 --> 01:27:58,128
- Like today?
- Yes.

1126
01:28:11,984 --> 01:28:14,784
- Do you hear that, Leopold?
Do you hear that music?
- Yes.

1127
01:28:15,017 --> 01:28:18,235
Have you ever seen
the movie Breakfast a Tiffany's?

1128
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,658
- Uh, no.
- "No."

1129
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:23,343
Not yet.

1130
01:28:25,183 --> 01:28:28,776
- You see that guy
down there with the light on?
- Mm-hmm.

1131
01:28:28,777 --> 01:28:31,726
He listens to the soundtrack...

1132
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:37,564
...of Breakfast at Tiffany's every night
until exactly midnight.

1133
01:28:37,765 --> 01:28:41,317
And then he turns his light off...
goes to sleep.

1134
01:29:04,868 --> 01:29:09,030
Oh, that means it's Sunday.
Oh, I don't want it to be Sunday.

1135
01:29:10,117 --> 01:29:14,130
I want more of this.
More 1876.

1136
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:18,519
But, Kate, you don't work on Sundays.
We can have more.

1137
01:29:19,815 --> 01:29:24,246
Well, oh, no, ’cause Sunday
is the day before
the day I work, so...

1138
01:29:25,207 --> 01:29:27,046
...it gets poisoned.

1139
01:29:28,216 --> 01:29:29,220
I see.

1140
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:34,988
Besides, tomorrow is the day
we shoot your commercial.

1141
01:29:47,569 --> 01:29:48,573
Kate.

1142
01:29:51,415 --> 01:29:52,460
Would you...?

1143
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:56,055
Might you ever...

1144
01:29:57,643 --> 01:29:58,855
...consider...?

1145
01:30:11,981 --> 01:30:13,360
It's time for bed.

1146
01:30:21,176 --> 01:30:24,144
- I'm so relaxed.
- That's all right.

1147
01:30:45,546 --> 01:30:48,430
- You're tucking me in.
- Yes.

1148
01:30:50,143 --> 01:30:51,607
Huh, you're my Otis.

1149
01:30:52,234 --> 01:30:53,697
Yes, Your Grace.

1150
01:31:02,099 --> 01:31:03,144
Oh, wait.

1151
01:31:03,895 --> 01:31:06,154
Hey, hey, don't... don't go upstairs.
Stay.

1152
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:54,557
I love you, Kate McKay.

1153
01:32:07,097 --> 01:32:08,904
Scone, Your Grace?

1154
01:32:08,905 --> 01:32:10,494
Ah, thank you, Millard.

1155
01:32:11,507 --> 01:32:14,892
- And you brought the Farmer's Bounty?
- But of course.

1156
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:20,473
Ah! Fresh creamery butter.

1157
01:32:20,723 --> 01:32:22,981
Is there anything more comforting?

1158
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:24,652
I say there is...

1159
01:32:25,322 --> 01:32:29,628
...and perhaps you'll agree when
you sample fat-free Farmer's Bounty...

1160
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:33,976
...with the genuine essence
of creamery butter in every bite.

1161
01:32:34,602 --> 01:32:37,278
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty...

1162
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:41,039
...you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort in your mouth...

1163
01:32:41,123 --> 01:32:43,715
...without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

1164
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,477
- Farmer's Bounty.
- Now, on this one

1165
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:50,235
...take a bite and smile.

1166
01:32:54,248 --> 01:32:56,543
And... cut! All right, check gate.

1167
01:32:56,544 --> 01:33:00,232
Good enough for me.
Can we get a Dedo up here and something...

1168
01:33:00,353 --> 01:33:02,192
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

1169
01:33:02,357 --> 01:33:05,282
Is this an actual sample
of Farmer's Bounty?

1170
01:33:05,367 --> 01:33:06,788
Yeah. Why?

1171
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:11,553
- This tastes like saddle soap.
- Well, that's not really
your concern, now, is it?

1172
01:33:11,678 --> 01:33:15,147
Not my concern?
This product tastes like raw suet.

1173
01:33:15,231 --> 01:33:18,199
- How is that not my concern?
- Hey, pal, it's a paycheck!

1174
01:33:18,283 --> 01:33:20,038
- Wait a minute.
- Paycheck?

1175
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:23,466
A... This is an outrage!
Don't worry about the taste. Come back.

1176
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:26,643
- We need another shot.
- Something that brings
the light up on this...

1177
01:33:32,704 --> 01:33:33,790
Leopold.

1178
01:33:34,584 --> 01:33:35,630
Leopold!

1179
01:33:37,093 --> 01:33:38,012
Leopold!

1180
01:33:38,095 --> 01:33:41,607
Leopold, what's going on?
What are you doing?
They-they need you back in there.

1181
01:33:41,732 --> 01:33:42,694
Do they?

1182
01:33:42,778 --> 01:33:46,121
Yeah. They have to shoot
the rest of the spot.
They're not finished yet.

1183
01:33:46,205 --> 01:33:47,793
Well, I want no part of it.

1184
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:52,057
- Why?
- Have you tasted it?

1185
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,899
- Farmer's Bounty?
- Yes, Farmer's Bounty.

1186
01:33:55,192 --> 01:33:57,532
- Yeah, I've tasted it.
- It's revolting.

1187
01:33:57,838 --> 01:33:59,121
I know.

1188
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:03,134
You know it's revolting yet you
have no qualms enlisting
me to endorse it?

1189
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:05,057
It's diet...

1190
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:08,024
...it's supposed to be awful.
I mean, what is the problem?

1191
01:34:08,108 --> 01:34:10,365
The problem is that for no reason
beyond my affection for you...

1192
01:34:10,448 --> 01:34:13,960
...I find myself peddling pond scum
to an unsuspecting public.

1193
01:34:14,252 --> 01:34:17,052
Hey, listen, you know
the stakes are very high for me here.

1194
01:34:17,137 --> 01:34:19,979
- You can't just quit because...
- Yes, I can. And so can you.

1195
01:34:20,146 --> 01:34:23,364
When one finds oneself participating
in an endeavor entirely without merit...

1196
01:34:23,448 --> 01:34:25,455
- ...one withdraws.
- No. No.

1197
01:34:25,831 --> 01:34:28,632
Because sometimes you have to
do things that you don't like.

1198
01:34:28,715 --> 01:34:32,896
Sometimes you have to suck it
up and finish what you
started. It's part of life.

1199
01:34:33,313 --> 01:34:34,777
You sound like my uncle.

1200
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,783
Look, Leopold...

1201
01:34:36,866 --> 01:34:39,750
...Jansen Foods is a very important
account for my company.

1202
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:42,677
If you don't go back in there
then I get into a lot of trouble.

1203
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,976
Is this what you do at work, Kate?

1204
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:48,069
Research methods to deceive people?

1205
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:50,493
Refine lies until they resemble truth?

1206
01:34:50,577 --> 01:34:52,625
It's no wonder you dread your work week.

1207
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:56,679
- Oh! Man, I don't have time for this.
- What has happened to the world?

1208
01:34:57,599 --> 01:35:00,525
You have every convenience,
every comfort yet no time for integrity.

1209
01:35:00,609 --> 01:35:03,702
No. What I don't have time
for are pious speeches..

1210
01:35:03,785 --> 01:35:07,629
...by 200-year-old men who've
never had to work
a day in their life.

1211
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,188
You have no idea
what I've done with my life.

1212
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:12,980
And you-you have no idea
what I've done with mine!

1213
01:35:12,981 --> 01:35:16,257
I haven't had all that many
comforts and conveniences, Leopold...

1214
01:35:16,298 --> 01:35:19,222
...because I've been
paying dues all of my life...

1215
01:35:19,502 --> 01:35:21,968
...and I'm tired, and I need a rest...

1216
01:35:22,052 --> 01:35:26,524
...and if I have to peddle a little
pond scum to get one then so be it.

1217
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:33,129
Very well.

1218
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,457
We're kidding ourselves, Leopold.

1219
01:35:47,424 --> 01:35:50,769
In point of fact I don't even
really know who you are.

1220
01:35:54,071 --> 01:35:57,247
You still don't believe
I'm the man I say I am?

1221
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,970
We had a great weekend; that's that.

1222
01:36:02,179 --> 01:36:05,105
And now it's Sunday.
It's over.

1223
01:36:25,503 --> 01:36:29,976
There's such a lot of world...

1224
01:36:30,059 --> 01:36:32,735
...to see...

1225
01:37:25,486 --> 01:37:26,490
I know.

1226
01:37:28,848 --> 01:37:31,631
I know, I know, it sounds crazy...

1227
01:37:31,817 --> 01:37:32,904
...talking about...

1228
01:37:33,526 --> 01:37:37,160
...finding a crack in time
under the East River.

1229
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:44,232
But in, in point, in point fact,
Gretchen you know...

1230
01:37:46,715 --> 01:37:49,801
...it is no more crazy than, uh...

1231
01:37:49,802 --> 01:37:52,479
a dog finding a rainbow.

1232
01:37:55,252 --> 01:37:57,258
Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.

1233
01:37:58,301 --> 01:37:59,638
They don't see color.

1234
01:38:00,014 --> 01:38:02,439
- Really?
- Just like we can't see time.

1235
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:04,027
We can feel it.

1236
01:38:05,031 --> 01:38:07,287
Oh... we can feel it passing...

1237
01:38:07,497 --> 01:38:09,753
...but, uh, we can't see it;
it's just a blur.

1238
01:38:10,381 --> 01:38:11,760
It's like, uh...

1239
01:38:12,429 --> 01:38:15,898
...it's like we're riding in a,
in a supersonic train...

1240
01:38:16,483 --> 01:38:19,743
...and the world is just blowing by.

1241
01:38:20,914 --> 01:38:23,548
But imagine if we could stop that train,
Gretchen. Hmm?

1242
01:38:24,551 --> 01:38:26,933
Imagine if we could stop that train...

1243
01:38:27,226 --> 01:38:28,229
...get out...

1244
01:38:28,564 --> 01:38:31,615
...look around and see time
for what it really is.

1245
01:38:32,785 --> 01:38:34,081
A universe...

1246
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:38,971
...a world a thing as unimaginable as...

1247
01:38:39,306 --> 01:38:40,811
...color to a dog.

1248
01:38:41,313 --> 01:38:42,901
And as real...

1249
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:45,826
...and tangible as that chair
you're sitting in.

1250
01:38:47,792 --> 01:38:50,174
Now, if we could see it like that...

1251
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,556
...I mean, really look at it...

1252
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:54,019
...then...

1253
01:38:55,524 --> 01:38:59,453
...maybe we could see
the flaws as well as the form.

1254
01:39:03,048 --> 01:39:04,219
And that's it.

1255
01:39:05,765 --> 01:39:07,019
It's that simple.

1256
01:39:07,521 --> 01:39:09,903
That's all I discovered. I'm just a...

1257
01:39:11,576 --> 01:39:14,538
...just a guy who saw a crack in a chair...

1258
01:39:14,539 --> 01:39:17,799
...that no one else could see.

1259
01:39:18,306 --> 01:39:21,356
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.

1260
01:39:22,485 --> 01:39:23,990
Only, uh...

1261
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:30,092
...none of the other dogs believe me.

1262
01:39:34,565 --> 01:39:35,945
I believe you.

1263
01:40:21,046 --> 01:40:22,425
I can see that some...

1264
01:40:23,471 --> 01:40:25,351
things have...

1265
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:27,901
...happened since I went away.

1266
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:29,573
But...

1267
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:34,715
...you have to go back.

1268
01:41:02,135 --> 01:41:04,811
You understand you'll be going back
to the same day you left...

1269
01:41:05,229 --> 01:41:06,650
- ...April 28.
- Yes.

1270
01:41:06,776 --> 01:41:09,450
So you understand you might
be repeating a few things.

1271
01:41:10,078 --> 01:41:11,874
You might even see me.

1272
01:41:12,293 --> 01:41:14,090
Just don't follow me this time.

1273
01:41:19,817 --> 01:41:20,987
Can I go in?

1274
01:41:25,669 --> 01:41:28,511
- J.J., you asked to see me?
- Come on in.

1275
01:41:31,688 --> 01:41:35,618
I understand you, uh,
put out a fire at the shoot yesterday.

1276
01:41:35,743 --> 01:41:38,334
Guess Mr. Duke's got
a bit of an ego on him, huh?

1277
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:39,755
Yeah.

1278
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:43,094
I'm going to England this week...

1279
01:41:43,838 --> 01:41:45,386
...and I made a decision.

1280
01:41:47,198 --> 01:41:49,539
You're going to be the top New York honcho.

1281
01:41:50,372 --> 01:41:53,549
So, this is going to be your office.

1282
01:41:53,799 --> 01:41:56,015
I'll be making it official tonight.

1283
01:41:58,398 --> 01:42:00,613
Thank you, J.J.
Thank you.

1284
01:42:01,539 --> 01:42:02,661
You earned it.

1285
01:42:03,958 --> 01:42:05,508
I'm heading over to Jansen to sign...

1286
01:42:05,509 --> 01:42:08,889
the buy-out papers, FTC stuff. So...

1287
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:10,896
...I'll see you later at the thing.

1288
01:42:11,941 --> 01:42:13,529
- What did he say?
- I got it.

1289
01:42:13,655 --> 01:42:17,458
- Oh, my God, that's wonderful!
- Just give me one second,
I'm sorry, Darci. One second.

1290
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:25,150
Hi. You've reached Stuart.
Please leave a message.

1291
01:42:25,608 --> 01:42:26,612
Hello?

1292
01:42:27,449 --> 01:42:31,420
Leopold, I-I don't know where you are
but if you're there, please pick up.

1293
01:42:33,056 --> 01:42:34,555
I got it.

1294
01:42:35,767 --> 01:42:37,523
I got the job.

1295
01:42:38,192 --> 01:42:42,748
I'm the new senior vice president at CRG.

1296
01:42:44,002 --> 01:42:45,841
Uh, please call me. I, um...

1297
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:48,892
I'm sorry about the way
things came down yesterday.

1298
01:42:48,975 --> 01:42:50,774
I apologize. I, uh...

1299
01:42:51,525 --> 01:42:53,699
I just really need to see you.
I'll love to see you tonight...

1300
01:42:53,783 --> 01:42:58,047
...but I have this thing
at Farmer's Bounty.
But I'll love to see you later.

1301
01:42:58,924 --> 01:43:00,429
I miss you.

1302
01:43:00,972 --> 01:43:02,310
I miss you.

1303
01:43:05,487 --> 01:43:06,657
Hey, Stuart.

1304
01:43:07,661 --> 01:43:09,124
How you feeling?

1305
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:18,653
Where's Leo?

1306
01:43:20,033 --> 01:43:21,203
He went home.

1307
01:43:51,926 --> 01:43:53,390
He was for real.

1308
01:43:56,817 --> 01:43:58,196
He was for real.

1309
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:11,488
Holy shit!

1310
01:44:13,745 --> 01:44:14,790
Look at this!

1311
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:26,788
Oh, my God.

1312
01:44:34,069 --> 01:44:36,280
Chilled, do you understand? Chilled.

1313
01:44:36,281 --> 01:44:39,288
And be sure to leave another
case of the Chateau Marid.

1314
01:44:39,289 --> 01:44:40,203
Yes, sir.

1315
01:44:40,204 --> 01:44:41,208
Leopold!

1316
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,716
Leopold!
Where have you been?

1317
01:44:44,677 --> 01:44:48,356
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past 5:00! He's not even dressed!

1318
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,069
He'll be ready, my lord, I assure you.

1319
01:44:50,153 --> 01:44:52,829
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!

1320
01:44:52,954 --> 01:44:56,340
Here's the invitation.
You've got your table number,
your car number...

1321
01:44:56,424 --> 01:45:00,686
...and I've got Morty down there the guy
you like. He's on the Madison side.
Also, your phone sheet is in here.

1322
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:02,986
And Stuart called you a couple times. So...

1323
01:45:03,194 --> 01:45:05,535
have a great time tonight.
You look beautiful.

1324
01:45:44,033 --> 01:45:47,503
I don't think this is right.
I'm supposed to be going to 2640 Madison.

1325
01:45:47,711 --> 01:45:49,467
That's where we are, Miss McKay.

1326
01:45:51,892 --> 01:45:53,480
Have a nice evening.

1327
01:45:54,859 --> 01:45:55,862
Hello.

1328
01:45:56,364 --> 01:45:58,203
Hello. Invitation, please.

1329
01:46:04,348 --> 01:46:08,653
They're still plugs.
They're just randomly
seeded with Minoxidil.

1330
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:10,659
- No cornrows.
- Excuse me.

1331
01:46:10,743 --> 01:46:12,958
Hey, Kate. Congratulations.

1332
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,004
Thank you.

1333
01:46:14,087 --> 01:46:15,592
The hell with facelifts.

1334
01:46:15,675 --> 01:46:18,351
I'm into mini-lifts now.
Just a tiny little bit each year.

1335
01:46:18,435 --> 01:46:22,237
I hear they're bringing
back the 840 next year.
So I'm just running out the lease.

1336
01:46:22,321 --> 01:46:24,369
- Kate, congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

1337
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:27,338
- Hey, Kate.
- J.J. Hi, Barry.

1338
01:46:27,421 --> 01:46:29,261
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

1339
01:46:29,262 --> 01:46:31,197
Anyway, I'm just glad
they've got them fixed.

1340
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:33,999
I was going to move
my office down to the lobby.

1341
01:46:36,784 --> 01:46:37,871
Excuse me.

1342
01:46:40,776 --> 01:46:44,119
Kate, don't powder your nose for too long.
I'm going to give this
speech in a couple minutes.

1343
01:46:44,518 --> 01:46:45,688
Okay.

1344
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:52,375
All this time I thought
that I had pretzled fate...

1345
01:46:52,458 --> 01:46:54,967
...and it had to be untwisted.
But what I never considered...

1346
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:57,726
...is that the whole thing is a pretzel.

1347
01:46:57,935 --> 01:47:01,195
A beautiful 4D pretzel
of kismetic inevitability.

1348
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:04,079
Okay, you know what, get off Park
as soon as you can, and then go up Madison.

1349
01:47:04,164 --> 01:47:06,002
I was supposed to go back.

1350
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:09,848
He was supposed to come forward
then he was supposed to
go back again and...

1351
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:12,403
...so was she.

1352
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:16,498
<i>Now it is my pleasure and honor...</i>

1353
01:47:34,041 --> 01:47:36,191
...to take priests to the bell tower.

1354
01:47:36,192 --> 01:47:38,760
You speak of progress and invention.

1355
01:47:38,761 --> 01:47:41,980
But what I offer you
down the stairs is reality.

1356
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:44,757
Take a wife. Marry.

1357
01:47:44,862 --> 01:47:47,415
Let us not bother with this banter, Uncle.

1358
01:47:47,416 --> 01:47:50,634
Tell me whom you want me to marry.
Well, who has the most money.

1359
01:47:51,355 --> 01:47:52,359
Well...

1360
01:47:52,986 --> 01:47:55,786
...that would be Miss Tree
of the Trees of Schenectady.

1361
01:47:55,912 --> 01:47:56,914
Good.

1362
01:47:57,081 --> 01:47:58,168
Consider it done.

1363
01:47:59,214 --> 01:48:02,056
Otis, fetch the ring.
I will announce at midnight.

1364
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:06,529
- Invitation, please.
- Uh, hello. My name is Stuart Besser.

1365
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:09,664
I'm sorry, I know we're not on your list
but his sister is Kate McKay;

1366
01:48:09,748 --> 01:48:12,465
- ...she works here.
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't just let you in.

1367
01:48:16,769 --> 01:48:20,531
...and I learned that there was
one thing that I could do...

1368
01:48:20,615 --> 01:48:24,879
...and it didn't require money
and it didn't require a fancy school.

1369
01:48:25,631 --> 01:48:27,972
I learned that I could please people.

1370
01:48:28,139 --> 01:48:31,190
And there is nothing wrong with that!

1371
01:48:31,274 --> 01:48:33,572
I am a people pleaser, people!

1372
01:48:37,084 --> 01:48:39,884
Thank you so much.
I am so...

1373
01:48:40,051 --> 01:48:40,972
Kate!

1374
01:48:41,055 --> 01:48:43,981
Stuart!
Charlie! What are you doing?

1375
01:48:44,064 --> 01:48:45,695
Take a look at these pictures, Kate.

1376
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:47,451
- No! No-no-no-no!
- Now it's time to introduce the woman...

1377
01:48:47,534 --> 01:48:49,875
...who's going to be holding down
the fort in our New York offices...

1378
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:53,678
...our own little rising star,
Miss Kate McKay!

1379
01:48:53,762 --> 01:48:57,106
- They're introducing me downstairs right now!
- Just listen to me for a second, okay, please?

1380
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:59,155
I'm sorry I was a lousy boyfriend.

1381
01:48:59,238 --> 01:49:02,540
I'm sorry I let you down.
I know all you wanted
was someone you could trust...

1382
01:49:02,624 --> 01:49:05,967
Oh, Stuart, really I can't talk about
our relationship right now.

1383
01:49:06,051 --> 01:49:07,097
Please.

1384
01:49:07,515 --> 01:49:10,231
Maybe we weren't such
a waste of time after all.

1385
01:49:10,357 --> 01:49:13,826
- I mean, maybe there's
a reason I was your guy.
- What are you talking about?

1386
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:18,173
Maybe I was supposed
to help you find your guy...
Leopold.

1387
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:21,768
You got to go back, Kate.

1388
01:49:22,603 --> 01:49:24,109
You got to go back there.

1389
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,161
Go back?

1390
01:49:28,373 --> 01:49:29,375
How?

1391
01:49:29,668 --> 01:49:33,137
You have to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge
within the next 23 minutes.

1392
01:49:33,974 --> 01:49:34,977
Kate?

1393
01:49:36,565 --> 01:49:37,652
Kate!

1394
01:49:37,819 --> 01:49:39,658
Kate, just look at the pictures, okay?

1395
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:58,385
- Is there a... a Kate McKay in the house?
- Yeah.

1396
01:49:58,593 --> 01:50:00,307
- Here I am!
- Kate?

1397
01:50:02,438 --> 01:50:03,944
Here she is. Here she is.

1398
01:50:05,448 --> 01:50:09,002
Well, without further ado
the new senior vice president...

1399
01:50:09,085 --> 01:50:10,249
...of our New York offices.

1400
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:13,218
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen...
Kate McKay.

1401
01:50:18,114 --> 01:50:20,581
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

1402
01:50:21,037 --> 01:50:23,506
- Thank you.
- Quite an entrance, huh?

1403
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:26,432
Thank you, J.J.
Thank you very much.

1404
01:50:27,175 --> 01:50:28,175
Wow.

1405
01:50:29,011 --> 01:50:30,015
Well...

1406
01:50:30,446 --> 01:50:32,033
...it's a great night.

1407
01:50:32,536 --> 01:50:34,166
We here at...

1408
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:40,519
...CRG have always considered ourselves
to be in the "Find what people want"
business and at Jansen...

1409
01:50:40,979 --> 01:50:43,613
...you guys are in the
"Make what people want" business.

1410
01:50:43,696 --> 01:50:46,288
So, imagine what we can do together.

1411
01:50:46,831 --> 01:50:50,635
We'll be able to find out
exactly what people want...

1412
01:50:50,718 --> 01:50:53,143
...and make it for them.

1413
01:50:53,227 --> 01:50:56,362
So... yeah, so our customers...

1414
01:50:57,073 --> 01:51:00,333
...will be able to get exactly...

1415
01:51:07,522 --> 01:51:08,650
...what they...

1416
01:51:12,162 --> 01:51:13,499
...they want.

1417
01:51:40,502 --> 01:51:41,798
And, uh...

1418
01:51:44,305 --> 01:51:46,019
...it's a great thing to...

1419
01:51:46,897 --> 01:51:50,116
...to get what you want.
Uh, it's a really good thing.

1420
01:51:50,241 --> 01:51:53,287
Unless what you thought
you wanted wasn't really...

1421
01:51:53,288 --> 01:51:56,509
...what you wanted
because what you really...

1422
01:51:56,636 --> 01:51:57,639
...wanted...

1423
01:51:59,061 --> 01:52:02,698
...you couldn't imagine,
or you didn't think it was possible.

1424
01:52:04,746 --> 01:52:05,749
But...

1425
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,552
...but what if someone
came along who knew...

1426
01:52:09,636 --> 01:52:11,977
...exactly what you wanted without asking?

1427
01:52:12,061 --> 01:52:13,942
They just knew. Like they could...

1428
01:52:14,358 --> 01:52:16,214
hear your heart beating...

1429
01:52:16,215 --> 01:52:17,929
or listen to your thoughts...

1430
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:21,968
And what if they were sure of themselves...

1431
01:52:22,302 --> 01:52:24,685
...and they didn't have to take a poll...

1432
01:52:24,893 --> 01:52:26,606
...and they loved you...

1433
01:52:27,275 --> 01:52:29,616
...and you hesitated?

1434
01:52:35,385 --> 01:52:36,555
And...

1435
01:52:37,099 --> 01:52:38,478
I have to go.

1436
01:52:40,317 --> 01:52:41,655
I, uh...

1437
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:45,333
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1438
01:52:47,799 --> 01:52:48,803
Kate?

1439
01:52:55,156 --> 01:52:57,246
Stuart, can you tell me...

1440
01:52:57,330 --> 01:53:01,050
...in short, complete sentences
featuring no words over two syllables...

1441
01:53:01,133 --> 01:53:03,265
...why exactly I am in these pictures?

1442
01:53:03,349 --> 01:53:04,854
- Probably not.
- Try.

1443
01:53:04,938 --> 01:53:06,692
- Because you were there.
- I wasn't.

1444
01:53:06,776 --> 01:53:09,326
I would remember.
Believe me, I would
remember if I was there.

1445
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:12,210
- Because you're going to be there.
- If we get there in time.

1446
01:53:12,293 --> 01:53:15,137
These are pictures of the past,
not the future.

1447
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:18,480
Not exactly. Theoretically speaking
if you go to the past in the future...

1448
01:53:18,564 --> 01:53:20,403
...then your future lies in the past.

1449
01:53:20,486 --> 01:53:24,749
And that is a picture of you
in the future in the past.

1450
01:53:24,876 --> 01:53:27,219
We have to make a run for it. Let's go.

1451
01:53:29,724 --> 01:53:31,062
Come on, come on.

1452
01:53:31,689 --> 01:53:33,319
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

1453
01:53:33,403 --> 01:53:37,583
Whoa, where the hell
do you think you're going?
$6.80 on the meter, pal.

1454
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,760
It's going to close, Kate!
Come on!

1455
01:53:49,036 --> 01:53:51,752
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

1456
01:53:52,039 --> 01:53:53,376
The Duke of Albany...

1457
01:53:53,503 --> 01:53:55,592
...will be making
a very important announcement...

1458
01:53:55,849 --> 01:53:58,478
...in 20 minutes from this very stage.

1459
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:00,671
And I believe it shall be
an announcement...

1460
01:54:00,672 --> 01:54:02,182
...that will justify...

1461
01:54:02,183 --> 01:54:03,979
...the playing of a bridal waltz.

1462
01:54:13,823 --> 01:54:15,871
Okay... this is the hard part.

1463
01:54:15,955 --> 01:54:17,460
- What?
- The girder.

1464
01:54:17,543 --> 01:54:20,093
- The girder?
- You have to cross the girder, Kate.

1465
01:54:22,643 --> 01:54:24,356
That girder?

1466
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:28,810
- Stuart, I can't cross that girder.
I can't go across...
- You love him, right?

1467
01:54:28,811 --> 01:54:29,900
What?

1468
01:54:29,901 --> 01:54:31,028
Leopold.

1469
01:54:31,837 --> 01:54:33,552
You love him, right?

1470
01:54:35,604 --> 01:54:36,608
Yeah.

1471
01:54:37,566 --> 01:54:39,573
That's all you need to know.
Now go.

1472
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:41,955
- You'll be fine.
- Katie...

1473
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:43,586
Charlie...

1474
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:46,804
- Charlie, what am I... How are you...
- No, don't worry about me.

1475
01:54:47,891 --> 01:54:49,772
- Now, Kate, now.
- Now?

1476
01:54:49,898 --> 01:54:51,276
The portal's going to close.

1477
01:54:51,611 --> 01:54:52,614
- All right.
- Go.

1478
01:54:54,411 --> 01:54:55,582
- Jesus.
- Whoo!

1479
01:54:56,878 --> 01:54:57,923
Oh, God.

1480
01:54:58,256 --> 01:54:59,260
You can do it.

1481
01:55:00,765 --> 01:55:01,936
Don't look down.

1482
01:55:07,076 --> 01:55:08,080
Shit.

1483
01:55:24,507 --> 01:55:25,636
Charlie...

1484
01:55:28,812 --> 01:55:30,651
I'll love you forever.

1485
01:55:32,324 --> 01:55:33,494
Love you.

1486
01:55:38,301 --> 01:55:39,305
It's okay.

1487
01:55:44,445 --> 01:55:46,368
Lady... lady, what are you doing?

1488
01:55:46,451 --> 01:55:48,458
- Step back, lady.
- It's okay.

1489
01:55:48,543 --> 01:55:51,133
Step back from there, lady.
Come back, lady.

1490
01:55:54,477 --> 01:55:56,693
Central, be advised
This is Breech Post Four.

1491
01:55:56,776 --> 01:55:59,243
I've got a jumper on the southwest
location of the bridge.

1492
01:55:59,326 --> 01:56:03,423
Have a supervisor, ESU and Harbor
respond to this location forthwith.

1493
01:56:23,988 --> 01:56:25,452
Ladies and gentlemen...

1494
01:56:25,535 --> 01:56:29,380
...it is with a glad heart and a bright eye
that I proudly introduce...

1495
01:56:29,464 --> 01:56:32,515
...my beloved nephew Leopold...

1496
01:56:32,682 --> 01:56:34,145
...Duke of Albany.

1497
01:56:34,313 --> 01:56:37,576
Thank you, Uncle Millard.
Thank you.

1498
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:39,559
I'm sorry, madam,
but this is a private affair.

1499
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,710
No, you don't seem to understand.

1500
01:56:41,711 --> 01:56:44,512
I need to get inside.
I need to get inside right now and...

1501
01:56:44,595 --> 01:56:46,309
What seems to be the problem?

1502
01:56:46,694 --> 01:56:48,575
- Are you Otis?
- Well...

1503
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:51,625
...let us proceed.
Please raise your glasses...

1504
01:56:53,274 --> 01:56:55,698
...so we may toast to my bride-to-be...

1505
01:56:56,720 --> 01:57:01,653
...the woman whose welfare and happiness
shall be my solemn duty to maintain.

1506
01:57:02,402 --> 01:57:05,704
The future Duchess of Albany...

1507
01:57:10,595 --> 01:57:12,016
...Kate McKay...

1508
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:19,163
Of the McKays of...?

1509
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:22,716
Massapequa.

1510
01:57:25,768 --> 01:57:26,939
...Massapequa.

1511
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:38,308
- I love you.
- I love you.
