00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,190
主演：梅格·瑞恩

3
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,200
主演：休·杰克曼

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,200


5
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,340
片名：隔世情缘

6
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,340


7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,530
时间,已经被提为第四度空间.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,530
Time, it has been proposed is the fourth dimension.

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,490
And yet, for mortal man,time has no dimension at all.

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,490
但是到现在,对凡人来讲,时间并没有更多的尺度可言.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,590
We are like horses with blinders seeing only what lies before us.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,590
我们就像带着眼罩的马,只能看到我们面前的东西.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,040
Forever guessing the future...

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,040
听,听.永远只能猜测未来,

15
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,110
...and fabricating the past.

16
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,110
拼凑过去.-是他.-谁?

17
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,540
- Brilliant. Quite right, Your Grace.

18
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,540
天才.完全正确,阁下

19
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,770
How, you ask, can we lift these shackles and live not in the moment..

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,770
你们也许要问,我们怎能

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,740
挣脱这些銍酷而生活在广袤的,辉煌的时间的延续中?

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,740
...but in the glorious expanse of time's continuum?

23
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,220
听着,我将要告诉你们.

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,220
Listen, and I shall tell you.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,610
秘密就藏在我们持久完成的动力之中.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,610
The secret lies in the enduring power of our achievements...

27
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,160
我们的创造力!

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,160
- Yes! - ...our creations!

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,180
As the pyramids testify to the Egyptians...

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,180
就像是古埃及金字塔已经被证实

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,180
so my glorious erection shall represent...

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,180
伫立的辉煌将永久代表

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,620
...our culture in perpetuity.

34
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,620
我们的文化.

35
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,430
Behold, rising before you the greatest erection on the continent.

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,430
看啊,在你们后面正在升起的大陆上一个最伟大的建筑.

37
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,900
The greatest erection of the age!

38
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,900
这个时代最伟大的建筑!

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,120
The greatest erection on the planet!

40
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,120
这个星球上最伟大的建筑!

41
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,690
- Hold this. - Of course.

42
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,690
拿着这个.没问题.

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,650
For the Herald, Your Grace. I understand you'll be making an important announcement tonight.

44
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,650
据通报说,阁下.你将在今天晚上公告一个重要的通告.

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,510
Good afternoon, ladies. Please, excuse me, please.

46
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,510
下午好,女士们.对不起,让一让,对不起.下午好.

47
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,420
- And the Perrier-Jouet should be chilled. You understand? Chilled. Yes, sir.

48
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,420
Perrier-Jouet应该被冷冻起来,明白了吗?冷冻起来.-明白,先生.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,850
Leopold!Leopold,你到那儿去了?

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,850
Leopold! Leopold, where have you been?

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560


52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Leopold！Leopold!

53
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,030
Otis,我需要一个解释!已经5点半了!他甚至还没有打扮好!

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,030
Otis, I demand explication! It's half past 5:00! He's not even dressed!

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,510
他马上就好,我的主人.我向你保证.我不是要他马上就好.我是要他光彩照人!

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,510
- He'll be ready, my lord. I assure you. - I don't want him ready. I want him resplendent!

57
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,430
Ah, Miss Blaine.

58
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,430
哈,Blaine小姐.

59
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,280
你跳舞就像是......就像是一群小牛.

60
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,280
You dance like a... like a herd of cattle.

61
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,340
You are a rare woman who lights up a room simply by leaving it.

62
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,340
你是少有的那种女人她点亮房间然后只是简单的离去.

63
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,230
Might you be rich, Miss Blaine? You see..

64
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,230
可能会富裕,Blaine小姐?你瞧,

65
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,480
我是第三公爵我们两个在皇室的一点小秘密是

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,480
...whilst I am the third Duke the little secret of those of us in the Royal Court...

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,750
...apart from our general uselessness is our massive indebtedness.

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,750
除了无用的求婚外是受到最大的恩惠.

69
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,970
这就是你最大的不幸了Leopold

70
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,970
It's always been your misfortune, Leopold...

71
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,980
如此完全的自娱自乐用你自己讲出来的话.

72
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,980
...that you so thoroughly amuse yourself with the sound of your own voice.

73
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,950
在我乏味的生活中

74
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,950
In a life as stagnant as mine..

75
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,080
我能够始终的自娱自乐真是一种让人惊叹的变化.

76
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,080
...that I can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary marvel.

77
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,660
Hmm.请不要摸那个东西.你谈到的那个设备.

78
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,660
- Please don't touch that.  The device you were jabbering about.

79
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,080
把牧师带到钟楼的那个设备.

80
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,080
To take priests to the bell tower.

81
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,970
To take anyone, Uncle, to the floor they so desire.

82
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,970
能带任何人,叔父...到他们想到的那一层.

83
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,940
Buildings continue to climb. Soon they will outstrip the stamina of our legs.

84
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,940
建筑物在不停地升高.不久它们就会超出我们小腿能承受的高度.

85
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,990
你在说一种进步和发明.

86
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,990
You speak of progress and invention.

87
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,210
现在我叫你下楼这才是现实.

88
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,210
Yet what I offer you downstairs is reality.

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,010
找个老婆,结婚.

90
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,010
Take a wife. Marry.

91
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
结婚...

92
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Marriage...

93
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,230
结婚是永恒爱情的一种诺言.

94
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,230
...marriage is the promise of eternal love.

95
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,450
As a man of honor, I can not promise eternally what I have never felt momentarily.

96
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,450
作为一个男人,我不能为永恒许下诺言我从来没有感觉到是短暂的

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,630
出生在一个特权阶层,却感到无比的羞耻.那就是你的悲剧所在.

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,630
Born into privilege, yet perversely ashamed of it. That is your tragedy.

99
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,980
上帝啊,如果我的兄弟还在能够看到你这样,他会心碎的.

100
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,980
My God! If my brother could only see you, he'll be heartbroken.

101
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,530
你不像是个公爵!当然,我不是.

102
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,530
- You are no duke! - Of course I'm not.

103
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,540
君主政治已经死了,我的叔父.我们只是遗迹,这就是现实.

104
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,540
The monarchy is dead, Uncle. We are relics. That is reality.

105
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,880
The new Royals are men of accomplishment. Men like Roebling, with his bridge..

106
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,880
那些真正的新贵应该是..作出成绩的人们.象Roebling和他建的桥,

107
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,600
...Edison, with his lamp, Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...

108
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,600
爱迪生和他的灯发动机,闹钟, Westinghouse...

109
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,940
Those men made themselves from nothing!

110
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,940
这些人从一无所有做起!

111
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,630
你,从另方面看,生下来就拥有了一切从拥有一切开始,直到一无所有

112
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,630
You, on the other hand, were born with everything and from it, fashioned nothing.

113
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,730
As of tonight, I wash my hands of you.

114
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,730
从今晚开始,我再也不管你了.

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,660
好好看一下你的舞伴名单, Leopold.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,660
Take a good look at your dance card, Leopold.

117
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,290
A wealthy bride is your only surety.

118
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,290
一个有钱的新娘才是你唯一的保证.

119
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,080
Your Grace, may I present Miss Tree of the Trees of Schenectady, sir.

120
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,080
阁下,请允许我为你介绍Tree小姐Schenectady家族的tree小姐,先生

121
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,800
Miss Tree?

122
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,800
Tree小姐?

123
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,340
It's an honor to be making your royal acquaintance, Your Highness.

124
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,340
非常的荣幸和你相识,阁下.

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Shall we?

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
可以吗?

127
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I've never been to England... but...

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
我从未去过英格兰...但...

129
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Father's teeth were made there.

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,480
我父亲小时候去过那里

131
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,470
你父亲相当有钱是吧？

132
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,470
He's quite rich, your father?

133
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,030
Oh, yes..

134
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,030
额，是啊..

135
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,870
许多的梦,都是没有价值的.

136
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,870
Many dreams, all useless.

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,750
你是谁?

138
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,750
Who are you?

139
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,860
不,不,不.

140
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,860
No, no, no.

141
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,490
好的, ...请,等等, 别..我不想伤害你.

142
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,490
Please, wait, no. I don't want to harm you. Stop! Please!

143
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,490
先生，等一下

144
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,490
Sir, wait!

145
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,890
Please stop! Please!

146
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,890
站住! 请!

147
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
等等,先生!站住，Leopold

148
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Stop! Leopold!

149
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,280
Pardon me. Pardon me.

150
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,280
原谅我.原谅我.

151
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,540
Go! Go!

152
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,540
走! 走!

153
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,120
站住,请等等先生!

154
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,120
Stop, sir! Please!

155
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,090
哦,我的天哪.

156
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,090
Oh, my God.

157
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,470
别!

158
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,470
No!

159
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,360
放开!

160
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,360
Let go!

161
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,950
Just let go. It's okay!

162
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,950
放开.没事的!

163
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,050
你不会明白的!放开!

164
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,050
You don't understand! Let go!

165
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,230
哦!我不想伤害你!放开!

166
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,230
- Oh!  I don't want to hurt you! Let go!

167
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,010
What?

168
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,010
什么？

169
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,830
- I'm sorry.  Well, you should be.

170
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,830
对不起。你一定会

171
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,420
It's just that...

172
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,420
只是…

173
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,820
如果有人敢那样做，就能得到你这样的女孩

174
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,820
if a guy like that can get a girl like you, what's left for a guy like me?

175
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,220
A guy like that can get a girl like me.

176
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,220
那样的男人能得到我

177
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,190
But a girl like me will never love him.

178
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,190
但我这样的女孩不会爱上他

179
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
你是说你爱我?

180
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
Are you saying you love me?

181
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,700
It's possible.

182
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,700
可能的

183
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,470
Turn it up higher.

184
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,470
高潮了

185
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
还有，高潮了

186
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
Some more, turn it up higher.

187
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,650
I've never felt so happy.

188
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,650
我从没这么高兴过

189
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,500
That's right, you can just leave it blank, Ok?

190
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,500
对的，如果你不晓得怎样写你可以不填，好吗?

191
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,700
这正是你真实的感受，对吗?

192
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,700
It's really just about what you're feeling. All right?

193
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,120
Guy in the windbreaker right there.

194
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,120
穿防风上衣的男子在那边

195
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,450
Two ladies right in front of him.

196
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,450
两位女士在他前面

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,000
Hey.

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,000


199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,260
So how did you think it went?

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,260
你觉得怎么样？

201
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,340
我想，也就中场60分钟

202
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,340
Well, if I had to guess, mid 60's.

203
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,400
他们为什么不喜欢看?

204
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,400
Why don't they love it?

205
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,150
She's not likeable.  She's right.

206
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,150
她不可爱。-她很好

207
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,360
Absolutely. I can do some trims where she sleeps with her boss.

208
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,360
绝对好。有些整理的地方 她和她的老板睡觉

209
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,210
剪掉那些部分。-抱歉

210
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,210
- Cut that whole section.  Excuse me?

211
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,140
Excuse me. What are you talking about?

212
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,140
-抱歉，你们在讨论什么?

213
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,690
- The movie, Richard, your movie?  I'm aware of that.

214
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,690
讨论电影，里查，你拍的电影。我知道

215
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,690
我想说

216
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,690
I want to say something.

217
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,250
I think Julie is likeable. Very likeable in this picture.

218
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,250
我想朱丽很可爱．.．在这画面很可爱

219
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,650
And real.

220
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,650
也很真实

221
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,620
请问，你一生中…从来没有犯错吗?

222
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,620
What, excuse me, you've never made a mistake in your life?

223
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,160
You have no flaws? You never slept with the wrong guy?

224
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,160
没有缺陷吗?没有和睡错人吗?

225
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,170
I'm not the protagonist in a major motion picture.

226
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,170
我不是动作画面的主角

227
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,130
我来告诉你，你们吸取了美国电影的糟粕

228
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,130
Let me tell you something, you people, you are sucking the life out of American cinema.

229
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,680
Richard, come on.

230
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,680
理查德,别

231
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,620
It's a comedy. But it's also a drama. It can be about something.

232
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,620
这是喜剧,但是同时也是连续剧，这有其他意外的东西!

233
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,180
"You are sucking the life out of American cinema."

234
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,180
你们吸取了美国电影的糟粕

235
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,340
吸取了美国电影的糟粕？

236
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,340
"You are sucking the life out of American cinema"?

237
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,350
不认为他带有这样的思想吗?什么？

238
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,350
- Maybe he's got a point, though? - What?

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
好吧

240
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Well...

241
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,710
Don't you ever think that what we do is a bit... crass?

242
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,710
你不认为我们所做的有点太愚钝，冷酷了吗？

243
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,870
We find out what regular people think and we pass on their wisdom.

244
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,870
我们发现正常人所想的我们是传递着他们的智慧

245
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,380
那就是我们所做的。那是愚钝?冷酷吗?我不这样认为

246
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,380
That's what we do. Is that crass? Is that cold? I don't think so.

247
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,950
我们就像是花生酱一样温柔，我们制作的是像谷物一样的脆弱的

248
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,950
We make peanut butter creamier. We make cereal crunchier.

249
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,090
Sit-coms funnier. Boring movies shorter.

250
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,090
连续剧。

251
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,450
我们让史马克把种籽从果酱里分离出来

252
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,450
We made Smuckers get the seeds out of their jam.

253
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,550
We did that. If you ask me, we're heroes.

254
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,550
我们就这样做的，如果你要问我，我会说我们是英雄

255
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,120
It goes with the territory every once in a while some pompous jerk...

256
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,120
只是把这个领域每个方面

257
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,690
sticks his head out of his cave and says...

258
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,690
把他脑子里的一些华而不实的东西抛弃而且说

259
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,560
"Hey, I like seeds in my jam. Without seeds it's just jelly."

260
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,560
“嘿，我喜欢在果酱里有种子的”“没有种子那就成了果冻了”

261
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,830
"You people are sucking the life out of my condiments."

262
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,830
“你们那就不符合我的调味品”

263
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,970
你知道我对他说了什么吗?这就是我对他说的，戴思

264
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,970
I say to him... this is what I say to him, Darcy...

265
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,310
You, baby, are one percent of one percent.

266
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,310
你是百分之一中的百分之一

267
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,760
你的意见是你不切题的

268
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,760
Your opinion is irrelevant.

269
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,810
I went out with a visionary like you for four years.

270
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,810
我像这样已经幻想4年

271
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,840
And I had to pay his rent?!

272
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,840
我并且必须给他付租金

273
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,820
Because he couldn't stoop down and get a job, like the rest of us?

274
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,820
因为他不能像我们一样找到工作?

275
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,810
这和史超活无关。是这样!

276
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,810
- This is not about Stuart. Yes it is!

277
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,790
It is about Stuart. It's about anybody who can't face up to reality.

278
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,790
这和史超活有关。这和任何不能面对事实的人都有关

279
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,830
I don't care if it's crass. Give me the number. Give me the bottom line.

280
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,830
我不在乎是否愚钝，给我韵律，给我底线…

281
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,680
直接给我事实，而不是把我当成猎人

282
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,680
Give me the truthstraight up, no chaser.

283
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,690
Bart!

284
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,690
巴特!(狗名)

285
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,810
别动!

286
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,810
Quiet!

287
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,270
哦,我的天那.

288
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,270
Oh my God!

289
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,560
We must remember, Bart...

290
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,560
一定要记着,巴特

291
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,170
...that sometimes, it is okay to color outside the lines.

292
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,170
有些时候一定要站线上的外面.

293
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,730
喂?║我的掌上电脑在你那儿吗?.

294
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,730
- Hello? - My Palm Pilot. You still have it.

295
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,320
Kate,现在是早晨1点钟了.

296
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,320
Kate, it's 1:00 in the morning.

297
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,530
很显然你还醒着在,你又在干什么坏勾当?

298
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,530
And clearly you're awake, so what is the infraction?

299
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,410
听着,Kate,我不知道你的掌上电脑那儿.

300
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,410
Look, Kate, I don't know where your Palm Pilot is.

301
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,090
And I can't do this right now. Not now. I'm expecting a call.

302
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,090
我现在也没法给你找.我在等一个电话.

303
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,410
Oh, Bart. Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

304
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,410
哦,巴特.哦,对不起,宝贝.

305
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,710
她不是个快乐的人.

306
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,710
She is not a happy person.

307
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,110
Goddamn it!

308
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,110
该死!

309
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,670
- You know what, Stuart?You know what? I'm... - Kate...

310
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,670
你知道吗,斯图亚特?你知道吗? 我...Kate...

311
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,690
别.... 我这儿有个人, 好吗?

312
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,690
Please. I've got somebody here, okay?

313
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,360
我知道,我看见她了.

314
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,360
I know. I saw her.

315
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
- No, you didn't.  Yes, I did!

316
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
没有,你没看见.是,我看见了!

317
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,970
It's a him, if that's any kind of consolation to you.

318
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,970
是个男的, 如果这样可以给你一点安慰.

319
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,840
So, look, now that you know I'm not getting laid, just go to bed, okay?

320
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,840
听着,你现在知道了我没有给你撒谎,上床睡觉吧,好吗?

321
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,850
Nuh-uh, don't. Do not hang up on me, Stuart. Don't do that.

322
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,850
别,别,别挂掉我的电话,斯图亚特.别那样做.

323
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,730
Kate,别这样.

324
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,730
Kate, please.

325
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,870
I beg of you. Something big is happening.

326
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,870
我求你了,有大事发生了.

327
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
Something...

328
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
事情

329
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,680
关系到我的一生...

330
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,680
...that validates my entire life.

331
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,270
"Something that validates your entire life.  What could that possibly be?

332
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,270
事情也关系到你的一生...可能会是什么事情?

333
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,950
- Are you sitting down? - Yes.

334
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,950
你是坐着的吗?是.

335
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,830
-不,你没有.-是,我坐着.

336
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,830
- No, you're not.  Yes, I am.

337
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,290
- No, you're not.  Ye...

338
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,290
不,你没有.是...

339
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,970
Okay.

340
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,970
好吧.

341
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,350
I found it.

342
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,350
我找到了.

343
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,530
- What did you find? - A portal.

344
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,530
你找到什么了?入口.

345
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,790
A crack in the fabric of time.

346
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,790
时间构造的入口.

347
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,930
就在东河的上面,Kate就是我曾经说过可能是入口的那儿.

348
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,930
It was over the East River, Kate, just where I said it would be.

349
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,440
- You found the portal? A portal into April 28th, 1876.

350
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,440
你找到入口了?一个到1876年4月28日的入口.

351
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,100
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge...

352
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,100
今天我从布鲁克林大桥跳入

353
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,870
然后到1876 年去散了一会儿步.

354
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,870
...and took a walk in 1876 today.

355
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,600
I followed my great, great grandpa, around old New York.

356
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,600
我跟随着Albany(纽约州府)的公爵,环绕了旧纽约州一周.

357
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,650
- Are you listening? Avidly.

358
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,650
你在听吗?非常急切.

359
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,520
现在事情有了突变Kate.这儿来了个捣蛋鬼.

360
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,520
This here's the twist, Kate. Here's the kicker.

361
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,000
什么捣蛋鬼?

362
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,000
What's the kicker?

363
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,600
He followed me home.

364
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,600
他跟我回到家了.

365
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,630
你爷爷的爷爷...是的

366
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,630
- Your great-great grandfather...  Yes.

367
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,350
- Viscount of Buffalo.  No, he's not a viscount...

368
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,350
(水牛城)的公爵...

369
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,480
- The Duke of Buffalo...  No, the Duke of Albany.

370
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,480
不,是Albany(纽约州府)的公爵.

371
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,900
...公爵跟你回家了穿过时间的裂缝.他是个杰出的工程师.

372
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,900
- Albany followed you home through a crack in time.  He's a brilliant engineer.

373
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,250
He patented the counterweight pulley. He invented the elevator, for Christ's sake.

374
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,250
他获得了平衡力滑车的专利.他发明了电梯.

375
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,200
You know what, Stuart? You know what? I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

376
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,200
你知道吗,斯图亚特?你知道吗?我再也不是你的女朋友了.

377
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,330
I haven't been for a whole month now.

378
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,330
我已经有一个多月不再是了.

379
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,360
- You can tell me the truth.   I am telling you the truth, Kate.

380
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,360
你可以告诉我实情是什么.我正在告诉你实情,Kate.

381
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,550
你可以告诉我你...到时代广场穿着女士衣服走了一圈.我不在乎.

382
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,550
You can tell me you went and picked up a transvestite in Times Square. I don't care.

383
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:36,700
知道吗,Kate?就是这一点.就是这一点,核心所在.我们两个分手的原因

384
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:36,700
You know what, Kate?║This is it, right here. This is it, in a nutshell. Our downfall.

385
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,010
You never... not once... believed in me.

386
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,010
你从来没有,哪怕是一次--相信过我.

387
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,050
Oh, I did, Stuart. I did, for four years. And I got burnt.

388
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,050
哦,我相信过,斯图亚特.我相信了四年.║终于看清了.

389
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,500
Okay, you want to know who he is? I'll tell you who he is.

390
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,500
好了,你想知道他是谁?我告诉你他是谁.

391
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,650
He is a hacker. High end. English.I know him from Columbia.

392
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,650
他是个黑客.英国人.我在哥伦比亚大学认识的.

393
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,690
He's in town for the Mac Expo at the Javits.

394
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,690
他现在在这个城市做苹果电脑出口.

395
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,760
We went out, got a little sloppy on Guinness and he passed out on my couch.

396
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,760
我们一块儿出去喝了点?啤酒然后他脑袋发昏睡在我的沙发上.

397
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,570
那就是真相?Mm-hmm. 那就是真相.好了吗?你现在高兴了?

398
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,570
- And that's the truth? - Mm-hmm. That's the truth. Okay? Are you happy now?

399
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,140
Is that plausible enough for you and your little focus group?

400
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,140
那样更合乎情理吗?对你或者对你那一小群朋友来讲?

401
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,880
You know what, Stuart?

402
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,880
知道吗,斯图亚特?

403
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,390
我把我最好的年华花在你身上了.

404
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,390
I blew my best years on you.

405
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,340
Those were your best?

406
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,340
那就是你最好的?

407
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,710
Look...

408
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,710
听着...

409
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,500
对不起.

410
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,500
I'm sorry.

411
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,600
I have to go. You'll get your Pilot in the morning.

412
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,600
我得挂了.你早晨会拿到你的掌上电脑的.

413
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,300
Orange alert.

414
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,300
橘色警告.

415
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,800
哦!Otis(人名)!Otis!

416
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,800
What is it?

417
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,280
Bart! No!

418
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,280
巴特,别闹!

419
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,420
Bart, stop!

420
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,420


421
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,690
It's okay.

422
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,690
没事了

423
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,320
- You? It's okay.

424
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,320
你？-别激动.

425
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,550
- Where am I?  Well, um, there's not an easy explanation for that.

426
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,550
-我在什么地方?哦.um,真是不容易给你解释这个问题.

427
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,850
如果你是想要赎金的话,我的叔父会付钱给你的.也许,除了我死亡以外

428
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,850
If it's a ransom you seek, my uncle won't pay a cent. Except, perhaps, for my demise.

429
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,280
No. no. You're not being kidnapped. Bart, quiet!

430
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,280
不,不,你没有被绑架.巴特,安静!

431
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,620
I can scarcely see, thanks to your spray.

432
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,620
由于你那个喷雾器我几乎什么都看不到.

433
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,220
My eyes feel like Steak au Poivre. So I ask you again, where the hell am I?

434
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,220
我的眼睛就像是.....糊满了洋芋泥.所以我再问你一次,我在该死的什么地方?!

435
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,020
As far as I'm concerned...

436
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,020
就如我所担心的,

437
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,300
you might be Jack the Ripper!

438
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,300
你也许是个变态杀手!

439
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,270
那你是要我相信我被留在了未来?还没有到来的时间中?

440
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,270
And you would have me believe that I'm being detained at present in the hereafter? The time to come?

441
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,190
Yes. Bart, quiet! He needs a walk.

442
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,190
是的.巴特,安静!他需要散散步.

443
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,530
And you would have me believe that you you are my progeny.

444
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,530
哦,那你还需要....让我相信你是我的后裔

445
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,540
一个我还没谱的婚姻的产物？

446
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,540
A product of a marriage unmade.

447
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
Yes.

448
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
是的

449
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,590
Oh! And you would have me believe that you have found a crack in time.

450
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,590
哦！你还要我相信你发现了一个时间裂缝。

451
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,560
你,在所有的人中是最应该相信的.我是说,你是一个科学家.你发明了电梯.

452
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,560
You, of all people, should understand. I mean, you're a scientist. You invented the elevator.

453
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,940
What is an elevator? What the hell are you talk... Where the hell am I?!

454
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,940
电梯是什么东西?你到底在讲什么啊...我究竟在该死的什么地方?!

455
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,410
I told you... you haven't actually gone anywhere. You're still in New York.

456
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,410
我告诉你...你实际上那儿都没有去.你还在纽约.

457
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,960
先生,这儿不是纽约!

458
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,960
That, sir, is not New York!

459
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,510
I'm afraid it is.

460
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,510
我恐怕这儿就是.

461
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,980
- No, Kate.  Hello. Hello there. What's your name?

462
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,980
别Kate.嗨,嗨,你.你叫什么名字?

463
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,450
-Leopold.
Leopold.

464
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,450


465
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,210
Tell me something. I'm having trouble with my G-5.

466
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,210
-请教 一个问题.我遇到了一点麻烦我用我的G-5的时候.

467
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,090
How much RAM do I need to properly run OS 9.6?

468
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,090
我需要多大的记忆体正确来运行OS 9.6?

469
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,940
Clearly, the Mac Expo is out.

470
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,940
很显然.苹果机专家走了.

471
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,490
So you must be a man out of time? Or Sergeant Pepper?

472
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,490
那你肯定是...时间以外的来人?或者是个海军陆战队战士?

473
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,170
-知道吗?实际上我们可以保留一点隐私.斯图亚特,我要要我的掌上电脑.

474
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,170
- You know what? Actually, we could use a little privacy. Stuart, I want my Palm Pilot.

475
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,560
我不是....我是认真的.晚点吧,Kate.我只是要我的掌上电脑,斯图亚特!

476
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,560
- I'm not... I'm serious. Maybe later on, Kate. I just want my Palm Pilot, Stuart!

477
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,320
- No. No. Hey, give me my Palm Pilot!║Give it to me.

478
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,320
不,不.嗨,把我的掌上电脑还给我!还给我.

479
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,830
This is madness.

480
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,830
简直是疯了

481
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,050
This is madness. Who was that? I feel as if I've seen her...

482
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,050
简直是疯了.她是谁?-我觉得像是我以前见过她...

483
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,020
Women have changed since your time, Leo. They've become dangerous.

484
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,020
女人从你那个时代开始已经发生变化了,Leo.她们开始变得更加危险了.

485
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,440
It's on the landing!

486
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,440
我给你抛下来了!

487
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,420
你说这不是绑架.你说这不会有危险.

488
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,420
You say this is no kidnapping. You say you mean no harm.

489
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,970
Then why is it, sir, you will not unlock the door?

490
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,970
那为什么,先生,把门窗关上?

491
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,940
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry about her. I'm...

492
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,940
对不起,好吧?对不起主要是对她.....

493
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,670
听着, 出于对你的尊重我不能让你就这样在外面自由自在的行走,行吗?

494
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,670
Look, with all due respect I can't let you just go running around free out there, okay?

495
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,260
This is New York City. It's not such a safe place anymore.

496
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,260
这是纽约城.这儿再也不是一个安全的城市了.

497
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,860
Look at you. You look like some sort of psychotic escapee from a Renaissance faire.

498
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,860
你看你自己.就像是一个从文艺复兴时期精神病院跑出来的病人.

499
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,540
I understand you have some anxiety but you have to trust me.

500
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,540
我知道你肯定感觉到有点焦虑但是你一定要相信我.

501
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,000
我肯定把你送回家,好吗?

502
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm going to get you home, okay?

503
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,180
I promise.

504
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,180
我保证.

505
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,980
Bart!

506
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,980
巴特!

507
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,120
The portal opens up again next week. Monday.

508
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,120
入口下个星期一还会打开.

509
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,050
I know that, because it was my back-up in case I didn't make it last night.

510
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,050
我知道,因为我以防万一做了准备我昨夜还没有做完我的工作.

511
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,850
这是一个回圈,知道吗?就像是...日全蚀.

512
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,850
It's on a cycle, you know? Kind of like, uh... total eclipse.

513
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,070
每20年来一次.你明白了吗?

514
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,070
Once every 20 years. You understand?

515
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,540
一般来讲,我什么都明白.自从我遇到你以后,什么都不知道了.

516
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,540
Generally, I understand everything. Since I've met you, nothing.

517
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,220
I can only assume I'm in a nightmare brought on by agita, or else I am dead.

518
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,220
我只能假设自己在一场梦魇之中带来的这些焦虑或者我已经死了.

519
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,810
You're not dead. Come here. Sit down. Here.

520
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,810
你还没有死.过来,坐下.这儿.

521
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,120
Want some milk in yours?

522
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,120
想要加点牛奶吗?

523
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,140
巴特,我能不能..........

524
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,140
Bart, can I just have...

525
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,820
Sorry. He's really got to go out.

526
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,820
对不起,它确实是需要外出散步了.瞧这些.

527
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,640
I'll be honored if you took a look at those.

528
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,640
嗯...你把这些东西看看我会很高兴的.

529
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,530
嗯,我回来后可以给你解释这一切.它一定要出去了要不它就会在这儿丢炸弹(拉屎)了.

530
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,530
Um, I'll explain everything when I get back. He's got to go out or he's going to drop a bomb in there.

531
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,030
Come on. Let's go.

532
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,030
来吧,我们走吧.

533
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,740
Back in five.

534
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,740
五分钟后回来.

535
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,260
One quick trip to Spectra, Bart...

536
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,260
来一个短的光际旅行,巴特

537
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,650
你和我就将会赢得诺贝尔桂冠

538
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,650
...and you and I will be Nobel Laureates.

539
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,700
Come on, Bart.

540
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,700
过来，巴特.

541
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,900
嗨，我们走.

542
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,900
Hey, let's go.

543
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,260
-过来.我们走!

544
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,260
Come on. Let's go.

545
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,940
Oh, Jesus!

546
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,940
噢!

547
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,470
噢,天哪!

548
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,470
Oh, God.

549
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,990
Good boy, Bart!

550
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,990
好孩子,巴特!

551
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,940
Stay!

552
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,940
坚持住!

553
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,860
Stay, Bart! Stay!

554
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,860
坚持住,巴特!

555
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,690
Oh, Bart, please stay!

556
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,690
坚持住!噢,巴特,请坚持住!

557
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,390
Stuart you forgot the pointy thing!

558
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,390
斯图亚特你忘了把掌上电脑的笔给我!

559
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,630
Stuart...

560
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,630
斯图亚.....

561
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,870
Look, this is not complex. He gave me the Palm Pilot║but he forgot the pointy thing.

562
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,870
听着，这并不复杂.他把掌上电脑还给我但是忘了把笔给我.

563
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,040
- I've been warned about you. Oh. Really?

564
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,040
我要警告你.噢，是吗?

565
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,690
And what, pray tell, did the great disappointment say?

566
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,690
天知道你要说些什么让人失望的话?

567
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,860
你刚才很危险,尽管你自己不觉得.噢，是吗?

568
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,860
- That you were dangerous, though you hardly look it.  Oh, really?

569
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,430
A lady in trousers isn't dangerous, merely plain.

570
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,430
-一个穿着裤子的女士不危险只是简朴.

571
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,060
我猜想你是个职业妇女是，搞市场研究.

572
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,060
- I take it you're a career woman.  Yeah, market research.

573
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,380
Mm. Fine avocation for women, research.

574
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,380
对妇女来讲是个很好的职业，研究.

575
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,500
Perfect for the feminine mind.

576
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,500
对女士的智力来讲非常好.

577
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,560
Huh.你在旅行,Lionel.

578
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,560
You're a trip, Lionel.

579
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,820
I myself once courted a librarian in Sussex.

580
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,820
我曾经向Sussex（苏赛克斯郡）的一个图书管理员求婚

581
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,420
Good for you.

582
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,420
喔.那很好啊.啊!

583
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,190
我必须坦白我觉得我们在先前的那一个场合见过.

584
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,190
I must confess I feel as though we've met on a previous occasion.

585
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,170
Well, Lionel, seeing as I've never met a single friend of Stuart's.

586
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,170
喔,Lionel,看起来..我从来没有见过斯图亚特的其他朋友--

587
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,060
I'm not even sure he's ever had any. I really don't see how that's possible.

588
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,060
我甚至觉得他是否有其他朋友--我真的不明白怎么会有那种可能.

589
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,480
噢，天哪，巴特!

590
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,480
Oh, man! Bart!

591
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,050
He just made Lake Erie out there. You just can't toss a dog out into the hall like that.

592
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,050
它刚在那儿撒了泡尿.你不能把狗象那样扔在巷道里.

593
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,700
- You can't do that. I assure you, I did not.

594
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,700
你不能那样做.我保证，我没有.

595
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
我们走吧.说什么?

596
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
- Let's go. I beg your pardon?

597
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,080
Come on. Let's go!

598
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,080
走吧.我们走!

599
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,680
Bart...

600
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,680
巴特...

601
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,280
Look, pal, I don't care how many elevators you got. This one's in my building.

602
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,280
听着，伙计,我不在乎你要修多少电梯.在这幢楼的电梯.

603
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,870
Hang-hang on a second.

604
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,870
挂在那儿不动了.

605
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,540
电梯的事情实在对不起，kate小姐.我马上打电话叫人来修.

606
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,540
Sorry about the elevator, Miss Kate. I've got them on the phone right now.

607
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,050
Hey, Gracy. This is Lionel, Stuart's friend.

608
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,050
咳y,Gracy.这是Lionel,斯图亚特的朋友.

609
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,300
How do you do?

610
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,300
你好吗?

611
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,740
Ten minutes? I need someone here right now.

612
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,740
十分钟?我要人马上就过来修.

613
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,370
- Watch it, man.  I beg your pardon.

614
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,370
-你小心点儿,伙计.实在对不起.

615
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,010
Hey, what are you doing?

616
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,010
咳，你在干什么?

617
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,220
You need to be going that way. There's an electron...

618
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,220
你应该朝那个方向走.那儿有一个电子.....

619
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,770
喂?喂? 那儿有一个电子商店.喂?

620
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,770
Hello? Hello? There's an electronics store. Hello?

621
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,860
I'm sorry, miss.

622
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,860
对不起，小姐.

623
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,240
There's a patch of grass across the street. Take him there. He'll do his business.

624
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,240
街那边有一个草坪.把它带到那儿，它自己会在那儿方便的.

625
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,880
请把这个交给斯图亚特吧?这是他的有线电视帐单.

626
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,880
Can you give this to Stuart, please? It's his cable bill.

627
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,560
They haul our furniture and cradle our children but this morning, from the Battery to the Bronx...

628
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,560
他们搬走我们的家具把婴儿放入摇篮今天早晨在纽约布朗克斯区的

629
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,610
elevators have mysteriously...

630
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,610
电梯不可思议的..........

631
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,370
So sorry.

632
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,370
真是对不起.

633
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,920
- I do beg your pardon.  Stupid!

634
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,920
我真的请你原谅.笨蛋

635
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,810
I beg your pardon.

636
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,810
我请你原谅.

637
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,060
你不打算把它弄走吗?

638
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,060
Are you going to remove that?

639
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,820
I beg your pardon?

640
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,820
对不起?

641
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,450
Pick it up and put it in the trash.

642
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,450
把它捡起来扔到垃圾桶去.

643
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,920
Absolutely not.

644
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,920
决不.

645
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,660
Maybe you don't understand. It's against the law to leave it there.

646
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,660
看来你没有听明白.把它留在这儿是违法的.

647
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,620
Are you suggesting, madam, there exists a law..

648
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,620
你的意思是，女士，有这样一个法律

649
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,160
可以强制一个绅士把狗粪弄走吗?

650
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,160
...compelling gentlemen to lay hold of canine bowel movements?

651
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,890
I'm suggesting you pick the poop up and throw it away now.

652
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,890
我建议现在你把狗粪弄走把它扔到垃圾筒去.

653
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,990
I refuse. Respectfully.

654
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,990
我拒绝. （恭敬的）.

655
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,470
那好吧.你叫什么名字，花痴?

656
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,470
All right. What's your name, fancy pants?

657
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,950
Leopold...Leopold...

658
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,950


659
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,960
Alexis Elija Walker..Alexis Elija Walker...

660
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,960


661
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,950
Thomas Garret Mountbatten（姓名）.

662
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,950
...Thomas Garrett Mountbatten.

663
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,640
All right, Stuart.

664
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,640
好了，斯图亚特.

665
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,790
Have a nice day.

666
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,790
祝你愉快.

667
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,330
我很感谢你给我说的这些好话，但是J.J.还没有从伦敦回来.

668
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,330
I appreciate you putting in a good word for me but J.J.'s not back from London.

669
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,370
- Right. Bye. What's with the elevators? - It's happening everywhere.

670
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,370
好的，再见.电梯怎么了?到处都在发生.

671
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,300
Darci（名字）.

672
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,300
Darci.

673
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,000
Last page.

674
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,000
最后一页.

675
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,450
Sorry.

676
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,450
对不起.

677
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,030
Did everyone live happily ever after?

678
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,030
最后是否都过得很快乐?

679
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,490
他在岛上等并且他失去了一只腿.

680
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,490
He lost his leg to gangrene  waiting for her on the island.

681
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,320
- But they're together now.  Wonderful.

682
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,320
但最后他们终于在一起了.太精彩了.

683
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,050
- Oh, look, you got your Palm Pilot back.  A nightmare.

684
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,050
喔，瞧，你把你的掌上电脑拿回来了.一场梦魇.

685
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,910
Okay, so who do I owe?

686
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,910
好了，我欠下些什么要做的?

687
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,410
Okay, Bobby at Hasbro. Reeves at Crunch.

688
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,410
好吧，Bobby在Hasbro等你.

689
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,670
And the finals came in for "Love for Sale." The call with the studio's at 4:00.

690
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,670
摄影棚在4点有个电话.

691
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
有关黄油销售的会议在15分钟后在会议室召开.

692
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
The margarine thing's in 15 in the conference room.

693
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
J.J. wants to talk to you before that. Oh, and one more thing.

694
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
在这些事情之前J.J.有话要给你讲.对了，还有一件事.

695
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,470
I remember that you told me to start thinking ahead...

696
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,470
我记得你告诉我做事要提前考虑

697
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,670
所以我告诉你你的兄弟明天

698
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,670
...so I know your brother's getting back..

699
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,720
- ...from his retreat tomorrow and if you want something in the fridge... - Darci...

700
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,720
从夏令营回来了另外你是否需要从冰箱中拿点..-Darci..什么?

701
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,750
Can you tell me why I'm upset right now?

702
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,750
你能告诉我为什么现在我很沮丧吗?

703
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,940
那是因为,.....

704
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,940
Because, uh...

705
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,100
J.J. called this morning. That is why I have a cell phone. So you can call me...

706
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,100
J.J.早晨给我打了电话.这就是我为什么会有个手机.因此你可以先打电话给我..

707
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,770
Kate, Kate, he didn't call. He just popped his head in here and spoke two sentences.

708
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,770
Kate, Kate,他没有打到这儿他只是在这儿晃了一下讲了几句话.

709
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,940
那他回来了?

710
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,940
So he's back?

711
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,570
Margo说他将要做一个重大声明关于下周的合并.

712
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,570
Margo says he's going to make a big announcement about the merger next week.

713
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,730
Margo? What does she know? How does she know anything about anything?

714
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,730
Margo?她知道些什么?她怎么会知道这些事那些事?

715
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,930
喔，好了，

716
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,930
Oh. All right.

717
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,700
So he popped his head in here. All right, so you have to tell me exactly what he said, Darci.

718
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,700
那他来过这儿了？.好的，那你告诉我他到底讲了些什么，

719
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,980
你从头开始讲给我听...

720
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,980
You have to start at the beginning and tell me...

721
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,450
He said, "Tell Kate I'm going to sit in on Farmer's Bounty."

722
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,450
他说, "告诉Kate我将代理农场产品"

723
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
J.J...J.J.

724
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040


725
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,300
- Good morning, Kate.  Good morning.

726
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,300
早晨好, Kate.早晨好.

727
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,930
我在办公室见你.

728
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,930
I'll see you in there.

729
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,920
我的上帝,它还立在那儿.

730
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,920
Good Lord, it still stands.

731
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,870
The world has changed all around it but Roebling's erection still stands!

732
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,870
它周围的世界已经变了但是它却还在那儿立着!

733
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,910
瞧，我的朋友，这是个奇迹.

734
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,910
That, my friend, is a miracle.

735
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,920
- What?  It's a miracle, man!

736
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,920
什么?这是个奇迹，伙计!

737
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,590
It's a bridge.

738
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,590
这是个桥.

739
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,770
Tell me when did they adapt it for steam engines?

740
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,770
告诉我...是什么时候让它适应蒸气机的?

741
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,240
The fire brigade.

742
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,240
消防队.

743
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,330
I don't know how it happened. I found him in a shaft.

744
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,330
我不知道这是怎样发生的.我在电梯井里找到他.

745
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,460
斯图亚特!

746
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,460
Stuart!

747
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,260
Leopold, what are you doing out here?

748
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,260
Leopold,你在这儿干什么?

749
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,230
Get back inside!

750
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,230
快回去，进里面去!

751
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,420
They're taking him to Goodman Memorial.

752
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,420
他们把他送到好主人纪念馆去(地名?医院?).

753
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,270
Fresh creamery butter.

754
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,270
新鲜的精炼黄油.

755
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,660
Is there anything more comforting?

756
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,660
还有什么令人鼓舞的事情?

757
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,050
There is and I know you will agree when you try Farmer's Bounty...

758
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,050
有我知道你们一定会赞同当你们在试用农场产品的时候

759
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,270
...with the essence of real butter in every bite.

760
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,270
在你咬每一口的时候都会感受到黄油的清香.

761
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,280
Your first choice. However, 45% of our demo circled "shifty"...

762
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,280
你的第一选择.不管怎样,45%的人都觉得

763
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,750
他的语调非常的令人难受.这个不行.

764
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,750
...as his key descriptor. Not good.

765
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,260
This is what I say. Everybody should be trying Farmer's Bounty..

766
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,260
这就是我为什么说.每个人都应该试试农场产品

767
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,810
...with the real, rich, creamy taste of real butter.

768
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,810
有着真正的,浓浓的奶油香味的黄油.

769
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,110
Try it, and you will be losing pounds. Poof! Boom! Voila!

770
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,110
试试吧,你的体重会随之减轻 oof! Boom! Voila(表示惊叹的语气词)!

771
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,040
Your second choice. Unfortunately, the group found him obnoxious, abrasive..

772
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,040
你的第二选择.不幸的是,观众发现他表情让人讨厌

773
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,510
有72%的人觉得他让人毛骨悚然.

774
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,510
...and a whopping 72% found him just plain creepy.

775
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,940
The spot rolls out in four days. We have to...

776
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,940
广告在四天内就将播出我们必须.....

777
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,410
The product is shipping. What the hell am I supposed to do?

778
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,410
我到底该怎么做才行啊?

779
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,160
我们只有明天再做一个片断.

780
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,160
We have to do another session. Tomorrow.

781
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,260
I had my assistant book the response room at National so we can decide then and there.

782
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,260
我的助手已经预定了答复的时间和地点在电视台，所以我们可以在那儿给他们答复

783
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,110
Kate,你没事吧?没事吧?

784
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,110
- Kate, are you all right?  You okay?

785
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,540
我没事.天,Kate,我要一杯咖啡.

786
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,540
- I'm fine. Geez, Kate, I'll ask for a decaf.

787
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,630
Monica, I need you to call Barney's. I need a white blouse, size small...

788
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,630
Monica,我要你给巴尼打个电话.我要一件短上衣,小号的

789
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,870
...in Kate's office by lunch.

790
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,870
午饭的时候送到kate的办公室.

791
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,350
-哦,安逸.

792
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,350
Oh, dear.

793
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,160
Hi, you've reached Stuart. Please leave a message.

794
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,160
嗨,你接通了斯图亚特的电话.请你留下消息.

795
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,090
Leopold? Leopold, look, don't be frightened. This is Stuart, okay?

796
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,090
Leopold? Leopold,听着,别害怕.我是斯图亚特,明白吗?

797
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,940
这就是贝尔可以讲话的电报?

798
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,940
Is it Bell's talking telegraph?

799
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,740
- I saw a prototype at last year's faire.  I need you to pick up the handset, Leo.

800
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,740
我去年看到过他的原型机.我要你把话机的听筒拿起来,Leo.

801
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,920
You pick up the green handset, because I need to talk to you...

802
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,920
把那个绿色的听筒拿起来,我有话要给你讲...

803
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,260
Are-are you there? Hello?

804
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,260
你听到了吗?-喂?

805
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,060
Leopold, thank God. Listen, they're taking me to X Rays.

806
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,060
-Leopold,谢天谢地.听着,他们要把我送去做x光透视.

807
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,030
Everything's going to be fine but you have to stay in the apartment, do you understand me?

808
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,030
不会有什么事情的但是你必须就待在房子里明白了吗?

809
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,040
哦,斯图亚特,我今天看到大桥了.

810
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,040
Oh, Stuart, I saw Roebling's bridge today.

811
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,550
- I saw it... complete.  Yes, yes, but listen to me.

812
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,550
我看到了... 清清楚楚的.知道,知道,你听我讲.

813
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,730
You can't go out again. You have to stay in the apartment.

814
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,730
你不能再出去了.你一定要待在房子里.

815
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,910
待在房子里?待好久?Leo,我晚上就回来.

816
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,910
- Stay in the apartment? For how long? - Leo, I'll be back tonight. I promise.

817
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,610
No more field trips.

818
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,610
我保证,再也不会有这种考察旅行了.

819
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,130
Would you...

820
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,130
你是否...

821
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,500
喂... 喂?斯图亚特?

822
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,500
Hel... hello? Stuart?

823
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Hello?

824
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
喂?

825
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,510
Blast!

826
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,510
该死!

827
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,510
喂.

828
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,510
Hello.

829
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,540
Hello.

830
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,540
喂.

831
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,240
你是谁?

832
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,240
Who are you?

833
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,250
Hector(名字)我妈妈星期三工作到很晚

834
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,250
Hector. My mom works late on Wednesdays...

835
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,730
...so I watch TV with Stuart.

836
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,730
所以我就到斯图亚特这儿看电视.

837
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,370
Want some Pirate's Booty?

838
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,370
要不要点薯片?

839
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,100
Excuse me, J.J., I wanted to thank you for the shirt. That was very nice.

840
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,100
对不起J.J.,我来谢谢你给的上衣.非常好看.

841
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,850
进来,进来.

842
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,850
Come in, come in.

843
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,360
Yeah. Uh-huh.

844
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,360
是,啊哈.

845
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,820
绝对是.

846
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,820
Absolutely.

847
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,250
哦,好的,好的.是,她就在这儿.我会告诉她的.

848
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,250
Oh, good, good. Yeah, she's here right now. I'll tell her.

849
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,880
Okay... okay. Bye.

850
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,880
好的... 好的.再见.

851
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,230
Sit down.

852
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,230
坐下.

853
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,360
That was Barry. He was thrilled with your work at the screening last night.

854
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,360
是Barry(名字)来的电话.他对你昨天晚上在摄影棚的拍摄感到非常激动.

855
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,240
Oh, good. Good.

856
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,240
哦,好,好

857
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,730
你是女人中少有的那一种,Kate.

858
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,730
You're a rarity among women, Kate.

859
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,160
I'm sorry?

860
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,160
对不起?

861
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,660
You don't cling to illusion. You don't get...

862
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,660
你不靠想像办事.你也不

863
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,790
受情绪的影响.

864
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,790
...caught up in emotion.

865
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,640
You don't do pretty.

866
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,640
你也不打扮.

867
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,940
I don't?

868
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,940
我不?

869
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,030
你倾向个男人.你更像个男人.

870
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,030
You skew male. You're like a man.

871
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:12,180
A man who understands women their desires, their needs.

872
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:12,180
一个了解女人的男人--她们的愿望,需要.

873
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,610
You understand them but you're not really one of them.

874
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,610
你了解她们但你不是她们中的一员.

875
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,800
你不会介意我的这种直率吧?不,不会的.

876
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,800
- You don't mind my being frank, do you? - No. I don't. No.

877
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,470
Edamame?

878
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,470
来点乳酪?

879
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,970
Kate?
Kate?

880
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,970


881
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,110
但是有一天,他放下了海盗旗-斯图?

882
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,110
- But one day, he lowered the Jolly Roger... - Stu?

883
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,240
...and set sail in search another kind of treasure.

884
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,240
-开始出航去寻找另外一种宝藏.

885
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:04,010
不是金钱,不是珠宝,不是黄金...而是新娘.

886
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:04,010
Not money, not jewels, not gold... but a bride.

887
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,060
Despite his being a ruffian of the brine fearless in his plunder...

888
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,060
不管浓浓的海水对他进行怎样的侵蚀

889
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,450
...and merciless with the sword the Pirate King was also lonely.

890
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,450
还有刀剑对他的攻击海海盗王仍然觉得孤独.

891
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,710
You see, he had never met a lady.

892
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,710
明白吗,他从来没有见过一个女士.

893
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,680
他从来没有见过姑娘?

894
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,680
He never met a girl?

895
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,110
No. Not a girl, not a lady, not even his own mother.

896
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,110
不,不仅是姑娘l, 女士,甚至是他自己的母亲.

897
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,660
So what happened?

898
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,660
-那最后发生了什么?

899
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,460
-就像所有的喜剧一样最滑稽的事情是...

900
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,460
As with all comedies the most ridiculous thing imaginable...

901
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,840
the Pirate King fell in love with the major general's daughter.

902
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,840
海盗王爱上了陆军少将的女儿.

903
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,210
I had the good fortune to see the premiere last month at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.

904
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,210
上个月正好我有机会看了首映式在第五大道的剧院.

905
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,420
从什么时候起剧院搬到第五大道了?

906
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,420
Since when is Penzance at the Fifth?

907
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,430
Is it your habit, sir to simply enter a conversation without introduction?

908
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,430
这就是你的习惯吗?先生?不加一点介绍就直接加入到别人的对话中?

909
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,040
Whoa, you are deep in it.

910
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,040
哇,你刚才太沉迷了.

911
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,800
It's cool. I'm an actor, too. I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.

912
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,800
太好了,我也是个演员.我是查理.住在楼下.

913
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,210
Kate McKay, senior vice president.

914
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,210
Kate McKay,(名字)副总裁.

915
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,300
Darci, it hasn't happened.

916
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,300
Darci,还没有开始啊.

917
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,730
他刚才做的只是在你面前挂个胡萝卜.直到他作出最后的决定

918
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,730
All he did was dangle a carrot. Until he makes a decision..

919
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,980
- ...the pressure's doubled.  When's he going to make a decision?

920
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,980
现在是双倍的压力.他什么时候会作决定?

921
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,290
我们明天中午午餐的时候..进行一次更亲密的讨论.

922
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,290
We're having dinner tomorrow to discuss it further at Commune.

923
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,250
- Kate?  Yeah.

924
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,250
-Kate?-是.

925
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,670
-斯图亚特的电话在一线上-不!

926
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,670
- I have Stuart on the line.  No!

927
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,760
-他说他  不！

928
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,760
- He says he's...  No!

929
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,010
在医院里.

930
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,010
...in the hospital.

931
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,290
Leopold is just sitting alone in my apartment right now. God knows what could happen to him.

932
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,290
Leopold现在一个人在我的公寓里.天知道在他身上会发生些什么事情.

933
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,380
Do you know he got outside today?

934
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,380
你知道他今天到外面去了吗?

935
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,050
Of course he did... I made him walk your dog.

936
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,050
当然知道--我让他带你的狗出去溜溜.

937
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,970
What?

938
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,970
什么?

939
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,190
No, Kate, you can't do that! He can't go outside!

940
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,190
别,Kate,你不能那样做!他不能到外面去!

941
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,740
天哪,我的上帝,Kate.他是从1876年来的, Kate.

942
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,740
Jesus Christ, Kate. He's from 1876, Kate.

943
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,460
他不了解我们这个社会.如果在他身上发生什么事情的话

944
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,460
He doesn't know our customs. If something were to happen to him it could be catastrophic.

945
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,670
His mere presents has already caused an occlusion.

946
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,670
-他唯一的去咯已经关闭

947
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,710
Occlusion!

948
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,710
关闭

949
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,480
If he doesn't go back on Monday, I may cease to exist!

950
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,480
如果他星期一不回去，我也许就要消失

951
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,720
我是他的后代，Kate，上帝知道有多少这样的人

952
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,720
I'm his decedent, Kate, along with God knows how many other people.

953
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,530
如果他不能回到1876年4月28日

954
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,530
If he doesn't go back to April 28, 1876,

955
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,050
he doesn't get married, he doesn't have children, and you want to know what?

956
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,050
他就不能够结婚他就不会有小孩,你想知道会是什么样吗?

957
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,100
What happened with the elevators today, well that's going to seem like a walk in the park. - Stuart!

958
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,100
会对今天的电梯造成什么样的影响这就看起来像是在公园的一次散步.斯图亚特!

959
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,300
This is embarrassing. It's embarrassing now, all right?

960
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,300
这真是让人尴尬了.太让人尴尬了,行吗?

961
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,140
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

962
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,140
我很同情你的伤

963
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,430
But there happens to be a lot going on with me right now.

964
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,430
但是对我来说碰巧的事太多了

965
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,390
一定要有人看住他.

966
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,390
Someone has to keep an eye on him.

967
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,990
Stuart, he's a grown man.

968
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,990
斯图亚特,他是个成年人了.

969
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,720
He's a grown man. He's fine.

970
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,720
他是个成年人,他没事.

971
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,250
他可以照顾他自己.-不,等等,啊哈!║-我走了.

972
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,250
- He can take care of himself.  No. Wait. Aah!  I'm going.

973
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,720
Kate, please.

974
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,720
Kate,请别.

975
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,690
Just take this to Spectra, okay? Get it developed.

976
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,690
把这个带给Spectra, 好吗?继续开发一下.

977
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,740
你就会看到我告诉你的是真实的.告诉Manny这很重要.

978
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,740
You'll see... I'm telling the truth. Tell Manny it's important.

979
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,370
You want double prints?

980
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,370
你要我把它印两份吗?

981
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,460
That's not funny, Kate. This is not a joke.

982
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,460
这不好笑,Kate.这不是个笑话.

983
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,520
You need help, Stuart. You need help.

984
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,520
你需要帮助了,斯图亚特.你需要帮助了.

985
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
Charlie?

986
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
查理?

987
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,750
Hey, Kate!

988
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,750
嗨,Kate!

989
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,380
下来我要和你谈几分钟?

990
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,380
Can I see you downstairs for a minute?

991
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,140
I invited someone to dinner. He's up there all alone.

992
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,140
我邀请了人来吃晚饭.

993
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,360
Stuart's in the hospital. I didn't think you'll have such a problem...

994
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,360
他一个人在楼上.斯图亚特在医院里.我没有想到你有这样的问题...

995
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,160
不,你没有想到,查理.你没有想到.

996
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,160
No, you didn't think, Charlie. You didn't think.

997
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,750
You came home early, one day early from actor camp.

998
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,750
你这么早回家,从你那个夏令营回来.

999
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,590
Okay, it's not actor camp and yeah, I came home a day early, all right?

1000
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,590
好了,那不是夏令营我就是回来早了一点罢了,行了吧?

1001
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,560
不就是上楼...-弹了一会儿钢琴...

1002
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,560
There was this tai chi broad who kept trying stick her fingers...

1003
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,360
No, this is the point. You immediately march upstairs to my ex-boyfriend's apartment...

1004
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,360
不,这不是我要说的.你回来就立刻上楼跑到我前男朋友的房间

1005
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,670
然后又邀请他那个异想天开的男朋友...瞧,那就是关于这些.不是因为我上了楼.

1006
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,670
- ...and you invite his freakish friend...  See, that's what it's about. It's not that I went up there.

1007
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,340
主要是关于你的前男友...不,不是说斯图亚特.

1008
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,340
- It's that it was your ex-boyfriend...  No, it's not about Stuart.

1009
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,390
Greetings, Kate. Charles.

1010
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,390
你好啊,Kate.查理.

1011
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Hey, Leo.

1012
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
嗨,Leo.

1013
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,740
表现好点.

1014
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,740
Be nice.

1015
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:12,150
那么,斯图亚特什么时候回来?几天,也许一周吧.

1016
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:12,150
- So, when's Stuart getting back?  Couple days, maybe a week.

1017
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,330
He promised me that he would return late this evening.

1018
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,330
他向我保证最迟今天晚上就回来.

1019
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:18,090
Well, maybe he will, Leopold. He's so big on keeping his promises...

1020
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:18,090
瞧,也许他会,Leopold.他就是这么会许愿.

1021
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,140
May I have the next course?

1022
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,140
我可以要下一道菜吗?

1023
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,230
There is no next course.

1024
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,230
没有下一道菜了.

1025
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:39,870
Where I come from the meal is the result of reflection and study.

1026
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:39,870
哈.我来的那个地方食品都是烹饪研究的结果.

1027
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,890
Menus are prepared in advance timed to perfection.

1028
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,890
菜谱是在开饭之前早就准备妥当了.

1029
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:49,020
It is said, without the culinary arts the crudeness of reality would be unbearable.

1030
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:49,020
这就是说,没有经过厨师的精心烹饪现代的天然食品简直令人难以接受.

1031
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,700
我们在McKay(kate)的房子里你只有说:

1032
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,700
We had a saying in the McKay house:

1033
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,670
"You shake and shake the ketchup bottle. None will come, and then a lot'll."

1034
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,670
"你摇摇番茄酱的瓶子.就这样了."

1035
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,060
- What is that? I beg your pardon?

1036
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,060
你这是干吗?对不起(什么意思)?

1037
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,360
你站起来干吗?

1038
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,360
Why are you standing?

1039
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,910
I'm accustomed to stand when a lady leaves the table.

1040
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,910
我习惯站起来当一个女士离开桌子的时候.

1041
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,530
Tell me, Charles when Stuart and your sister were engaged...

1042
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,530
告诉我,查理你的姐姐什么时候和斯图亚特订婚的?

1043
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,580
...did you happen to read his papers on the temporal universe?

1044
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,580
你是否看过他的那些资料关于暂时的宇宙空间的那些?

1045
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,590
I spent the morning perusing them, and must confess...

1046
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,590
我花了一个早晨仔细看了,我不得不承认...

1047
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,810
Stuart and I were never engaged. Not even close.

1048
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,810
斯图亚特和我从来没有订过婚.没有那么近过.

1049
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,310
我看过...

1050
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,310
But I did read...

1051
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,780
Thank you.

1052
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,780
谢谢.

1053
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,790
我看过那些资料不管如何,表示支持.

1054
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,790
But I did read his papers however, to show support.

1055
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,830
Is Stuart still trying to make a time machine?

1056
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,830
斯图亚特还在试验..制造时间机器?

1057
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,840
That's the beauty of it, he discovered no machine was necessary.

1058
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,840
干得最漂亮的是--他发现...根本不需要时间机器.

1059
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,100
All one had to do was to develop formula to forecast portals...

1060
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,100
所有需要做的是去发现规律预报出入口在那儿--

1061
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,610
在时间构造上的一个自然的视窗.

1062
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,610
...natural windows in the fabric of time.

1063
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,040
很显然,斯图亚特找到了一个利用现代的...

1064
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,040
Apparently, Stuart located one utilizing modern...

1065
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,360
Utilizing modern theories of weather prediction.

1066
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,360
哈!利用现代的天气预报的理论.

1067
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
What's a portal?

1068
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
什么入口?

1069
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,700
An opening which exists for but a moment.

1070
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,700
一个在短时间内打开并存在的视窗.

1071
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,000
This explains why one must jump through it from a height...

1072
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,000
这就可以解释为什么他必须从很高的地方跳下--

1073
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,680
以便达到一个很高的速度来完成.地心引力的速度,这需要很精确.真是太精彩了.

1074
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,680
in order to achieve the required velocity. The speed of gravity, to be exact. It's quite brilliant.

1075
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,440
You are so method. You don't even break for a second, do you? It's unbelievable!

1076
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,440
你太文绉绉了.你简直不想停一下,是吗?真是不可思议!

1077
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:14,080
Oh, stop it, please! No more! Stop, please? I beg you. I'm tired. Can you go away?

1078
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:14,080
哦,请别说了!不要再说了,请别说了?我求你了,我累了.你该走了?

1079
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,170
你走了好不好?你走了吧?

1080
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,170
Can you just go away? Can you go away?

1081
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,480
她喝醉了,Leo.哦,闭嘴,查理!

1082
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,480
- She's drunk, Leo.  Oh, shut up, Charlie!

1083
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,820
And you, can you go upstairs? Can you go away?

1084
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,820
还有你,你上楼去行不行?你也走吧?

1085
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,830
如果我在那样事上冒犯了你我真的很抱歉!.

1086
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,830
I am truly sorry if I have offended you in any way.

1087
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,170
Goodnight, Charles.

1088
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,170
晚安,查理.

1089
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,220
Goodnight, Leo.

1090
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,220
晚安,Leo.

1091
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,620
What the hell was that?

1092
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,620
这是什么意思?

1093
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,250
他认为他自己是从19世纪来的,查理.他认为自己是个公爵.

1094
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,250
He thinks he's from the 19th century, Charlie. He thinks he's a duke.

1095
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,300
I know.

1096
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,300
我知道,

1097
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,800
你不觉得很酷吗?不.

1098
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,800
- Isn't that cool? - No.

1099
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,310
Kate, he's in character. He is an actor.

1100
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,310
Kate,他在演某个角色.他是个演员.

1101
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,150
哦,是吗?演那一出戏?

1102
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,150
Oh, really? For what show?

1103
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,160
You know that just because someone doesn't have a paying gig...

1104
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,160
你知道吗这是因为..有人没有付清公演的费用

1105
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,260
...it doesn't mean they're not working on their craft.

1106
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,260
这并不意味着平常就不能扮演自己的角色.

1107
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,190
What's going on here?

1108
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,190
这儿怎么了?

1109
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,950
I think there's something wrong with his, uh...

1110
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,950
我想是他那儿有什么东西不对了, 哇...

1111
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:46,670
...thing.

1112
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:46,670
-东西.

1113
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
- Give me that telephone.  No.

1114
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
把电话给我.不.

1115
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,690
把它给我.不,我需要.....

1116
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,690
- Give it to me. No, I need to...

1117
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,410
What do you expect me to do? You took away my cell phone.

1118
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,410
你想我会干吗?你把我的手机拿走了.

1119
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,800
手机在医院里不允许使用.我必须要打个电话!

1120
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,800
- They're not allowed on hospital property.  I have to make a phone call!

1121
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,060
You're not going to make one now.

1122
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,060
你现在不能打.

1123
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,780
No, no, you don't understand. This is a very important phone call.

1124
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,780
不,不.你不明白.这是一个很重要的电话.

1125
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,410
I have to leave this hospital now. I can't be here anymore.

1126
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,410
我现在就要离开医院.我再也不能在这儿呆了.

1127
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,250
Besser先生我很烦老给你讲这些.

1128
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,250
Mr. Besser, I am tired of telling you this.

1129
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,890
You are not going nowhere until Dr. Feinstein signs your release!

1130
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,890
你那儿都不能走直到Feinstein医生给你签了出院证明!

1131
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,490
你是否了解过地球科学,Esther(名字),?

1132
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,490
Did you ever take any earth science, Esther, hmm?

1133
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,320
你看起来是个聪明女人.

1134
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,320
You look like a smart woman.

1135
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,710
Ever hear of the time-space continuum? Sounds important, doesn't it? Well, it is.

1136
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,710
是否听说过时空联合体?听起来很重要,是不?哦,确实是.

1137
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,470
You want to know something, Esther? It's broken! Okay?

1138
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,470
还想知道些其他事吗,Esther?时空破了!明白吗?

1139
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,230
And I'm the only guy who can fix it.

1140
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,230
我是那个唯一可以修复的人.

1141
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,440
So why don't you go down the hall there and get on your little telephone...

1142
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,440
所以为什么你不下楼去拿起你的小电话

1143
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,450
...and call Dr. Feinstein...

1144
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,450
给Feinstein医生打个电话...

1145
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,880
晚安Besser(斯图亚特)先生.你告诉他...

1146
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,880
- Goodnight, Mr. Besser.  You tell him that...

1147
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,390
You tell him that I...

1148
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,390
告诉他我......

1149
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,790
Point the toes, pull your shoulders back.

1150
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,790
手指向脚趾,肩膀向回收.

1151
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,340
作一个深呼吸现在向外呼气然后头朝后.

1152
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,340
Take a deep breath in and then exhale into downward-facing dog.

1153
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,500
Oh, be quiet! Be quiet... oh!

1154
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,500
哦,安静!安静... 喔!

1155
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,090
巴特,闭嘴!

1156
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,090
Bart, shut up!

1157
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:26,240
这个东西太危险了!这不过是个烤面包机!

1158
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:26,240
- That thing is a damned hazard!  It's just a toaster!

1159
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,670
Well, insertion of bread into that so-called toaster produces no toast at all...

1160
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,670
就是把面包插进去所以叫烤面包机根本就烤不出面包来--

1161
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,760
...merely warm bread! Inserting the bread twice produces charcoal.

1162
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,760
只是把面包加热!把面包插入两次,烤出焦黄的面包.

1163
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,310
这么清楚的说明如何正确烤出面包实际上需要插入一个和另外半个

1164
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,310
So, clearly, to make proper toast it requires one and a half insertions...

1165
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,240
看起来按说明书上说的用这个装置根本就不工作!

1166
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,240
...which is something for which the apparatus doesn't begin to allow!

1167
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:45,670
假如说这个电子设备的厂家在生产它之前他就应该先试用它.

1168
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:45,670
One assumes that when the General of Electric built it he might have tried using it.

1169
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,100
另外他应该为他的创造发明感到骄傲

1170
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,100
One assumes the General might take pride in his creations...

1171
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,690
...instead of just foisting them on an unsuspecting public.

1172
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,690
而不是用它来糊弄大众.

1173
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,030
You know something?

1174
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,030
你知道吗?

1175
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,210
没有人象你那样做

1176
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,210
Nobody gives a rat's ass...

1177
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,680
...that you have to push the toast down twice. You know why?

1178
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,680
你应该把面包片插下去两次.知道为什么吗?

1179
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,230
Because everybody pushes their toast down twice!

1180
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,230
因为每个人都是把面包片插两次!

1181
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,770
不是我来的那个地方那样.

1182
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,770
Not where I come from.

1183
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,240
哦.对了,你是来自于

1184
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,240
Oh, because where you come from...

1185
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,750
面包是烹饪研究的结果的那种地方.

1186
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,750
...toast is the result of reflection and study.

1187
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,130
是的,你在嘲笑我.

1188
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,130
Yes, you mock me.

1189
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,150
But perhaps one day, when you've awoken from a pleasant slumber...

1190
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,150
但是,当有一天早晨从美梦中醒过来的时候

1191
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,320
鼻子里闻到热乎乎的奶油蛋糕和上面涂着的柠檬香味的果酱还有新鲜的黄油的时候

1192
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,320
...to the scent of a warm brioche smothered in marmalade and fresh creamery butter...

1193
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,330
你就会知道什么才是真正的生活了这不是你需要做的什么事情只是一种享受.

1194
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,330
...you'll understand that life is not solely comprised of tasks, but tastes.

1195
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,470
Say that again.

1196
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,470
再说一遍.

1197
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,190
Pardon me?

1198
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,190
什么意思?

1199
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,910
-他们开始了吗?-是的.

1200
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,910
- Did they start yet? - Yes.

1201
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,750
Session list.

1202
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,750
安排时刻表.

1203
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,720
Leopold, Darci. Darci, Leopold.

1204
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,720
Leopold,这是Darci.Darci,这是Leopold.

1205
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,180
我想让他试一试.你可以在最后安排他试一试吗?

1206
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,180
I'll like him to read. Can you tack him on at the end?

1207
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:44,610
And, Leopold, go with Darci. She'll take you to the greenroom and explain everything.

1208
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:44,610
Leopold,跟着Darci去.她会把你带到演员休息室给你解释一切的.

1209
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,540
I need to work out. I need a place I can work out.

1210
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,540
我要策划一下.我需要一个地方策划一下.

1211
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,750
If I could get Mr. Duke? Is he ready? Where is he?

1212
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,750
可以叫公爵先生过来了吗?他准备好了吗?他在那儿?

1213
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,760
Oh, my God, look at this. Let's skip this one.

1214
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,760
哦,天哪,看这些.这一点跳过不要.

1215
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,270
Mr. Duke, right here on the floor.

1216
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,270
公爵先生,就站在这儿.

1217
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,820
-对不起,-这儿有个标记,就站这儿.就站在这个摄像线上.

1218
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,820
Excuse me, that's your mark, right there. Just stand on that tape line.

1219
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,790
Look, forget this guy. I can't waste any more time, J.J.

1220
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,790
听着,忘了这些家伙.我再也不能浪费时间了, J.J.

1221
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,880
We need to make a decision now.

1222
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,880
我们现在需要作决定了.

1223
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,930
All right, we've got plenty of good choices. Let's cut it off, Kate.

1224
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,930
好的,我们现在有大量的选择了.kate,我们开始吧.

1225
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,190
这是个错误, J.J.

1226
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,190
That would be a mistake, J.J.

1227
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,200
Kate,客户要求开始拍了.

1228
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,200
Kate, the client wants to move on.

1229
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,290
We should see this last guy. It'll... Two minutes!

1230
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,290
我们该看看这最后一个家伙.要..两分钟!

1231
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,800
我看他像个贵格会教徒.

1232
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,800
I think he looks like the Quaker Oats guy.

1233
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:22,230
行了Phil,这不管你的想法如何.主要是看客户的想法如何.

1234
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:22,230
Well, Phil, it's really not about what you think. It's about what they think.

1235
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,950
他们在这儿昏搞了一天了现在你看他们.

1236
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,950
They've been in a coma all day and now look at them.

1237
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,580
To them, this guy is a dream.

1238
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,580
这个家伙对他们来讲是个梦想.

1239
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,140
He's handsome, honest, courteous.

1240
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,140
他很英俊,诚实,有礼貌.

1241
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,230
Stands when you walk in a room. Brings you brioche in bed.

1242
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,230
出镜你就会看到.他会让你带着奶油蛋卷上床去吃.

1243
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,740
If you eat his margarine...

1244
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,740
如果你吃他她推荐的人造黄油

1245
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,290
...maybe your hips will shrink and he'll come to your door.

1246
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,290
也许你会扭扭屁股然后再去排队购买.

1247
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,670
I take it this is to be delivered in direct address as on Geronimo.

1248
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,670
我就像是直接去上门送货那样?高呼勇敢.

1249
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,090
- Geronimo?  He means Geraldo.

1250
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,090
高呼勇敢?他的意思是像个英雄那样.

1251
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,700
Exactly.

1252
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,700
对.

1253
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,040
好了, 大家都-- 请安静.开拍.

1254
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,040
Okay, everyone... quiet please.  And action.

1255
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,860
Start talking, bud.

1256
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,860
讲话啊,伙计.

1257
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,790
Fresh creamery butter.

1258
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,790
新鲜的农场黄油.

1259
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,180
Is there anything more comforting?

1260
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,180
还有什么让你更感觉舒服的东西?

1261
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,690
I say there is.

1262
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,690
我告诉你还有.

1263
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,830
And perhaps you'll agree when you sample fat-free Farmer's Bounty...

1264
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,830
当你尝试了农场产品后

1265
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,710
你一定会同意我的说法每咬一口都会感受到

1266
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,710
...with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite.

1267
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,760
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty you shall receive butter's...

1268
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,760
真正的新鲜黄油.货真价实的,口感舒适的农场产品

1269
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:30,650
...luxurious comfort in your mouth without adding to the luxury of your waistline.

1270
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:30,650
你将放心,大胆的享受新鲜黄油而不但心增加你的腰围.

1271
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,230
不错啊, Kate.你在那儿找到他的?

1272
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,230
Not bad, Kate. Where'd you find him?

1273
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,700
He lives in my building.

1274
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,700
他住在我那幢楼.

1275
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,490
Where do I sign? Right here, and here.

1276
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,490
签在那儿?这儿,和这儿.

1277
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,210
刚才干得太漂亮了,Kate.谢谢,J.J.

1278
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,210
- That was spectacular, Kate. Thanks, J.J.

1279
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,710
A lot to talk about tonight at dinner.

1280
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,710
晚上晚餐的时候我们再谈.

1281
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,270
- Nice work, Mr. Margarine. Thank you.

1282
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,270
干得好,黄油先生.谢谢.

1283
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,450
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.

1284
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,450
这身服装真是个好主意.

1285
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,260
Yes!
Yes!

1286
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,260


1287
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,640
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

1288
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,640


1289
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,690


1290
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,690
Yes!
Yes!

1291
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:15,500
- You seem pleased. Oh, you did so great in there!

1292
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:15,500
你看起来很高兴.哦,你刚才在那儿干得太漂亮了!

1293
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:16,640
Man!

1294
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:16,640
伙计!

1295
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:22,430
你将上国家电视台的广告时段了!

1296
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:22,430
You are going to be on a national television spot!

1297
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,830
I take it you're dining with that man tonight.

1298
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,830
我猜你晚上要和那个男人去吃晚饭吧.

1299
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,150
Huh? Oh, yeah, J.J. He's my boss.

1300
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,150
什么?啊,是的, J.J.他是我的老板.

1301
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,070
你需要一个陪伴.他的意图太明显了.

1302
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,070
You require a chaperone. His intentions are obvious.

1303
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,450
I'm alone with you. Do I need a chaperone?

1304
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,450
我和你一起去.我需要一个陪伴吗?

1305
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,420
We're not courting, Kate. If we were, as a man of honor...

1306
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,420
我不是在向你献慇勤.如果是,作为一个男人

1307
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,880
我会把我的想法通过书信的方式通知你.

1308
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,880
...I would have informed you of my intentions in writing.

1309
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,780
Good day.

1310
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,780
你好.

1311
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,920
Hey!

1312
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,920
嗨!

1313
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,640
Kate,我们为什么不坐这个.那些是给游客准备的.

1314
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,640
- Kate, why don't we take one of these.  They're for tourists.

1315
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,490
- Sorry, she doesn't seem interested.  Oh, hey, hello. Hello.

1316
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,490
对不起,她对这个不感兴趣.哦,咳,喂,喂.

1317
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,500
Hey! Hey!

1318
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,500
咳!咳!

1319
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,640
咳!咳,你.....

1320
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,640
Hey! Hey, you...

1321
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
Kate!
Kate!

1322
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520


1323
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,940
Hey, you asshole!

1324
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,940
咳,你这个流氓!

1325
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,500
I'm going to get you!

1326
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,500
我要抓到你的!

1327
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,220
Hey! Asshole!

1328
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,220
咳!流氓!

1329
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,650
Goddamn it.

1330
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,650
该死.

1331
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,030
把手伸给我.什么?

1332
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,030
- Give me your hand.  What?

1333
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,330
Your hand, woman!

1334
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,330
你的手,女士!

1335
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,680
你以为你在干什么?

1336
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,680
What do you think you're doing?

1337
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,830
我警告你,无赖!我在皇家军队学习过骑术

1338
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,830
I warn you, scoundrel I was trained to ride at the King's Academy...

1339
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,850
...and schooled in weaponry by the palace guard. You stand no chance.

1340
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,850
在皇家护卫队学习过武器使用.你没有机会.

1341
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,780
Where you run, I shall ride and when you stop, the steel of this strap will be lodged in your brain.

1342
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,780
你跑到哪儿,我就骑到哪儿你只要一停下来,这根铁链子就会挂到你的脑袋上.

1343
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,780
Your boyfriend's a very good rider.

1344
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,780
你的男朋友是个好骑手.

1345
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
是的.

1346
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
Yeah.

1347
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,520
这是真的吗?

1348
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,520
Are you for real?

1349
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,570
Pardon me?

1350
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,570
什么?

1351
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,740
Are you for real?

1352
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,740
这是真的吗?

1353
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,460
我想是的.

1354
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,460
I believe so.

1355
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,470
你是一个公爵.

1356
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,470
You're a duke.

1357
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,440
我出生在一个公爵家庭.

1358
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,440
I was born a duke.

1359
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,700
I've never felt like one.

1360
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,700
我从来没有感觉自己像是个公爵.

1361
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,930
待着别动,坐下.

1362
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,930
Stay. Sit.

1363
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,110
On your feet. Stay.

1364
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,110
屁股坐下,待着.

1365
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,760
Stay.

1366
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,760
待着

1367
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,850
好孩子.

1368
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,850
Good boy.

1369
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm off to dinner. What are you two doing?

1370
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:49,000
我要走了去吃晚餐.你们两个一会儿干吗?

1371
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,180
I don't know. Maybe we'll watch the rest of the game or go out or something.

1372
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,180
不知道.也许我们就在这儿看比赛或者出去逛逛.

1373
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,240
哦,谢谢你.

1374
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,240
Oh, thank you.

1375
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,700
Kate, may I repeat my offer to serve as a chaperone?

1376
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,700
Kate,我可以再说一次你是否需要一个陪伴吗?

1377
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,630
No, thank you, Leopold.

1378
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,630
不用,谢谢你,Leopold.

1379
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,010
Charles, don't you find this inappropriate? As her brother, I would think...

1380
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,010
查理,你不觉得这样不是太恰当吗?作为他的兄弟我想应该是..........

1381
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:08,190
As her brother, I would think that my sister would invite me to an audition.

1382
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:08,190
作为他的兄弟我想应该是...我姐姐应该要我去作为听众.

1383
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,450
Could be just me, though. Seems kind, but...

1384
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,450
而且只有是我.看起来像是,但是.....

1385
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
-查理.

1386
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
Charlie.

1387
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,840
You're not exactly a margarine spokesperson.

1388
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,840
你不是黄油发言人.

1389
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,390
- I can't sell butter, Kate? I don't mean to be insulting...

1390
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,390
我不能够卖黄油, Kate?我不是想对你无礼...

1391
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,310
这就是无礼,我是个演员.你不信任我也可以做卖黄油的广告?

1392
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,310
It's insulting. I'm an actor. You don't have faith in me to sell butter?

1393
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,320
No. No. I'm sorry.

1394
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,320
不,不.对不起.

1395
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,030
I can do British, Kate. I'm an actor.

1396
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,030
我能扮成英国人, Kate.我是个演员,

1397
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,240
可以扮成任何人!你是个很棒,很棒的演员.

1398
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,240
- I can be anybody!  You're a very, very good actor.

1399
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,150
- I am a good actor.  You are.  Okay, fine.

1400
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,150
-我是个好演员.-你是.好了,行了

1401
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,460
all right. A Victorian dude who's never...

1402
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,460
就这样.一个维多利亚的公爵从来没有

1403
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,390
- ...seen a Mets game watching TV.  Okay.

1404
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,390
看过电视里的比赛.好了.

1405
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,370
Scene... I say, are those little people in that box of phosphorous?

1406
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,370
场景(查理用英国口音模仿)我说就是这些小人在那个盒子里?

1407
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,210
Crikey, I believe it is! This game's more beguiling than cricket!

1408
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,210
哎呀,我真的相信!

1409
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:46,310
(查理用英国口音的模仿)

1410
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:46,310
Good golly, oh, Jesus! It looks like Mike Piazza just hit a game!

1411
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,200
How about Canadian? Oh, right on. Right on, you like butter, huh? Yeah, what's that aboot?

1412
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,200
加拿大口音如何?哦,行啊.行啊,你喜欢黄油,是吗?是啊,那个如何?

1413
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,260
晚安.晚安.

1414
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,260
- Good night. Good night.

1415
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:00,860
...all those people up in that stadium. Know what they probably could go for? Some margarine!

1416
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:00,860
...当所有的人走进运动场,知道他们是去干什么吗?一些黄油!

1417
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,000
When your friend walked in in that outfit I was getting a little nervous for you there.

1418
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,000
当你的朋友穿着那身制服走进来的时候我还真的有点为你担心.

1419
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,810
"If you eat his margarine, maybe your hips will shrink." It's brilliant.

1420
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,810
"如果你吃了这个黄油,也许你就会扭扭屁股."真是太精彩了.

1421
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,900
你让Phil从他那难堪的境地中解脱出来.

1422
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,900
You saved Phil from his own ambivalence.

1423
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,120
我知道只有这种方法--靠我的直觉.

1424
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,120
I knew it was the way to go... in my gut.

1425
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,670
I'm counting on that gut.

1426
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,670
我靠的就是你的这种直觉.

1427
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:23,200
是否要给你们上点面包和一瓶35年的酒?

1428
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:23,200
Can I get a bottle of your 95 Lynch-Bages and a bottle of Evian?

1429
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,690
I'll tell you one thing... your friend is going to be bigger than Mr. Whipple.

1430
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,690
我要告诉你你那个朋友将会比Whipple先生更伟大.

1431
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,370
You're not sleeping with him, are you?

1432
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,370
谢谢.你没有和他一起睡觉吧,是吗?

1433
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,290
没有.

1434
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,290
No.

1435
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,820
没有.

1436
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,820
No.

1437
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,950
Leo. Leo, come on. Come here.

1438
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,950
Leo. Leo,过来,到这儿来.

1439
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,120
怎么样,伙计?

1440
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,120
How's it going, man?

1441
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,170
See the girl with the long brown hair? That's Patrice.

1442
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,170
看见那个长着棕色的长发女孩没有?那是Patrice(名字).

1443
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:56,700
- She's lovely. She's mine.

1444
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:56,700
她很可爱.她是我的.

1445
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:57,960
恭喜你啊.

1446
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:57,960
Congratulations.

1447
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,130
Hey, everybody, this is Leo! Leo, this is everybody.

1448
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,130
咳,兄弟们,这是Leo!Leo,这是我的朋友们.

1449
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,170
- What's up? Dennis. Hello.

1450
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,170
干吗呀?邓尼斯.

1451
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,520
Shelby, Allison, Monica.

1452
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,520
Shelby, Allison, Monica.(人名)

1453
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,440
And this, this is the insatiable Patrice.

1454
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,440
这个是不知足的Patrice.

1455
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,050
- Hey, Charlie.. Hey. How do you do?

1456
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,050
咳,查理.咳.你好?

1457
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:26,310
- Patrice, let me assist you. Thanks.

1458
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:26,310
Patrice,让我来帮你.谢谢.

1459
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,810
You got it? I was going to get it.

1460
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,810
你拿到了?

1461
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,500
Let me get that for you.

1462
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,500
我正准备去拿.我来帮你点.

1463
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,930
给你.

1464
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,930
There you go.

1465
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,460
You look nice tonight. Very...

1466
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,460
今晚你看起来真漂亮.非常...

1467
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,730
像是个封面女郎.

1468
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,730
Like a Judy Blume book.

1469
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:54,510
这不错啊,我看了看这儿的水就像是护城河的水.

1470
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:54,510
That's good, because I thought for a moment that body of water here was a moat.

1471
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,360
No, that's a pond. The gardens are devastating.

1472
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,360
不,是池塘的水.花园太漂亮了了.

1473
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,240
They are. They're very, very beautiful. Ooh.

1474
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,240
是的.它们真是太漂亮了.

1475
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,510
你应该亲自过去看看.对,对.

1476
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,510
- You'll have to come and see them firsthand. Right, right.

1477
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:08,390
After the merger I'm going to be stuck over there, setting things up.

1478
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:08,390
合并之后合并之后,我就会被安排在那边工作.

1479
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,650
I'll be craving a little face time from my new top honcho in New York.

1480
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,650
在纽约我的新老板手下工作我就更渴望有能和你见面的机会.

1481
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,210
你在说什么?我是说你该来参观一下.

1482
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,210
- What are you saying? I'm saying you should come visit.

1483
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,800
- I'll fly you over for the weekend. Oh, yeah, I heard that.

1484
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,800
或者我飞到你这儿来过周末.哦,是的,这个我听到了.

1485
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,110
The other part... the part before that. The part about the top honcho.

1486
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,110
另一部分--开始的那一部分.新老板前的那一部分.

1487
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,160
I didn't understand that, that part.

1488
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,160
我没有明白你讲的那一部分.

1489
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,420
How about catching an opera Saturday? La Boheme's at the Met.

1490
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,420
星期六有没有空去看一场歌剧?La Bohtes at the Met.(歌剧名)

1491
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,680
Okay, so she comes back... the audience is about to leave...

1492
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,680
然后,她走了回来--观众已经打算走了--

1493
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:39,660
她重新回到台上并开始重新表演想感动观众用她那

1494
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:39,660
...she comes back on stage and she starts squirting the audience with this turkey baster...

1495
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,160
...filled with this pine mist.

1496
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,160
充满了松脂油的喷雾器想弄出眼泪来.

1497
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,500
And she's screaming "Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"

1498
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,500
并且开始大叫"不要性骚扰,不要性骚扰!"

1499
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:48,270
但是却一滴眼泪都没有.只是人的那种原始的激情.

1500
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:48,270
But no tears. Just raw human passion.

1501
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:52,400
- Isn't Willem Dafoe part of that group? Yeah, and he did this monologue about how...

1502
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:52,400
是不是Willem Dafoe的那一段戏?是的,他发表了一通

1503
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,910
...all the best things in life are hidden in people's basements.

1504
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,910
人类最好的东西都藏于地下室中的论断.

1505
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,380
像是卢浮宫.

1506
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,380
Like the Louvre.

1507
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,860
I'm sorry. You were saying, Charles?

1508
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,860
对不起.刚才说的,查理?

1509
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,370
就刚才..不,卢浮宫怎么样?

1510
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,370
- Just... No, what about the Louvre?

1511
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,620
告诉我们你刚才打算要讲的.

1512
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,620
Tell us what you were going to say.

1513
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,790
Well...

1514
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,790
哦.

1515
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,100
...only a fraction of the Louvre is on the walls. The rest is in the basement.

1516
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,100
在卢浮宫只有一小部分东西是挂在墙上的.其余的都在地下室放着.

1517
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,850
你曾经到过卢浮宫的地下室?啊,是的.

1518
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,850
- You've been in the basement of the Louvre?  Oh, yes.

1519
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,820
I was an art history major at Vassar.

1520
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,820
我在Vassar学院主修的是艺术史.

1521
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,250
And so, what's down there?

1522
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,250
那,下面有些什么东西?

1523
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:27,310
Well, that's where the real show begins. Unspoiled by dilettante.

1524
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:27,310
实际上,下面才是些真东西.一些没有被业余爱好者损坏的东西.

1525
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,030
DaVinci, Michelangelo, David, Chardin.

1526
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,030
达芬奇,米开朗基诺，大卫,但丁.

1527
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,630
"Allow me to assist you, Patrice. Oh, let me light that for you, Monica."

1528
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,630
"让我来帮帮你,Patrice."我来帮你点烟Monica."这是干什么?"只是我朋友们的聚会.

1529
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:43,220
"What, this? This is my family crest. Been in the family for..." Oh, in the basement?

1530
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:43,220
"就是朋友聚会...哦,到了地下室?

1531
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,910
"What do they have in the basement? Why, the works of da Vinci...

1532
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,910
"地下室里有些什么?"为什么达芬奇

1533
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,790
"米开朗基诺,但丁,大卫的作品

1534
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,790
...Michelangelo, Chardin, David...

1535
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,640
...all surrounded by great coral sponges to absorb the moisture."

1536
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,640
都被一些巨大的海绵包围着以便吸收水气."

1537
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,510
Just for the record, I was working it.

1538
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,510
只是想重复你刚才的话,我正在努力.

1539
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,550
I was in the zone and I would have gotten her number

1540
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,550
我刚好讲到那个地方我想要她的电话号码

1541
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,880
如果不是你把整个晚上变成卢浮宫的导游外.

1542
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,880
if you hadn't turned the evening into a guided tour of the Louvre.

1543
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,430
My apologies.

1544
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,430
我向你道歉.

1545
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:11,990
我就给你直说了吧.Patrice认为里你很可爱--也许是爽朗又可爱.

1546
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:11,990
Let's get one thing straight. Patrice, she thought you were cute... probably gay and cute.

1547
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,880
- And cute, Leo, that's the kiss of death.  Perhaps.

1548
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,880
Leo,那可是死亡之吻.-也许.

1549
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,010
-也许? 当然.我想这就是他的号码.

1550
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,010
- Perhaps? Certainly.  I believe this is her number.

1551
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,190
在我看来,Patrice对你的表现根本没有兴趣.这也难怪.

1552
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,190
As I see it, Patrice has not an inkling of your affections. And it's no wonder.

1553
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,450
You, Charles, are a merry-andrew.

1554
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,450
你,查理,就像是个小丑.

1555
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,500
- A what? Everything plays a farce to you.

1556
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,500
一个什么?你就是在表演一出滑稽剧.

1557
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,670
女人只对诚心实意作出反应.

1558
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,670
Women respond to sincerity.

1559
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,530
This requires pulling one's tongue from one's cheek.

1560
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,530
这就要求不要乱嚼舌头,瞎表演.

1561
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:36,320
No one wants to be romanced by a buffoon.

1562
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:36,320
没人想和小丑罗曼蒂克.

1563
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,080
现在,这个号码就可以打给她.好的.

1564
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,080
- Now, that number rings her.  Yes.

1565
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,540
- So ring her tomorrow. I can't. She gave the number to you.

1566
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,540
-那就明天打给她吧.我不能.她把号码给的你.

1567
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,790
她给我是因为我告诉她你的想法.

1568
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,790
Only because I told her of your affections.

1569
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,400
那,你给她说了什么?

1570
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,400
Wha-What did you say?

1571
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:52,160
Merely that you admired her but you were hesitant to make an overture...

1572
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:52,160
不过说了你很喜欢她但是你对主动约会感到踌躇不安

1573
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,040
...since you'll been told she was courting another.

1574
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,040
知道某人告诉你有人向她求婚.

1575
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,800
该死,真是太好了!

1576
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,800
Shit. That's good!

1577
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,770
- Wha-What did she say? She handed me the napkin.

1578
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,770
那她说什么?她把写有号码的餐巾递给了我.

1579
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:09,090
查理,现在太晚了.不,不.不.她还没有回家.

1580
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:09,090
- Charles, it's quite late. No, no, no, she won't be home yet.

1581
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:12,180
I get her machine, I leave a message ball's in her court.

1582
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:12,180
她有留言机,我给她留个言

1583
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:17,280
要想向她献慇勤.你得找个高兴的时候.要点就是:欲速则不达.

1584
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:17,280
You're ladling calculation upon comedy. The point is, to keep the ball in your court.

1585
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:21,460
你说得对,你说得对.

1586
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:21,460
You're right. You're right.

1587
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,930
好了.明天前什么都别做.

1588
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,930
- Okay. Nothing need be done till tomorrow.

1589
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,610
Tomorrow. Then I make my move.

1590
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,610
明天，明天我就行动.

1591
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,200
An overture, Charles. Make your intentions known.

1592
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,200
主动出击,查理.向她表明你的意图.

1593
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,170
想想如何让她高兴而不是让她烦恼.

1594
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,170
Think of pleasing her, not vexing her.

1595
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,470
No vexing.

1596
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,470
不让她烦恼.

1597
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:39,230
You're intoxicated. We should retire. I'm sure Kate will be home.

1598
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:39,230
你已经陶醉了.我也该退休了.我想Kate应该回家了.

1599
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,150
我看不一定.但现在快午夜了.

1600
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,150
- I doubt it. But it's nearly midnight.

1601
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,290
- You like her, don't you? Who?

1602
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,290
你喜欢她，是吗?-谁?

1603
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,590
-Kate.
Kate.

1604
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,590


1605
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,390
你就是!-噢，查理，别说了.

1606
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,390
- You do! Oh, Charles, Charles.

1607
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,350
You like my sister!

1608
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,350
你喜欢我姐姐!

1609
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,070
Well, you made your intentions known, right? Right?

1610
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,070
好啊，你现在搞清楚自己的想法了,对吧?-对吧?

1611
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,000
-你喝醉了.Leo,别...他们就在那儿附近.

1612
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,000
- You've been drinking. Leo, Commune... right around the corner.

1613
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,590
We could stop in, you could give me a couple of pointers...

1614
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,590
我们可以去看看,你可以找个什么理由

1615
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,770
然后在那儿坐下--随便说点什么.

1616
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,770
...pull out a chair or two you could throw out a gesture here or there.

1617
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,690
Yeah, see, it's one thing with Patrice. You don't give a shit.

1618
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,690
对了，你看，这和我与Patrice是一回事.你一点也不够大胆.

1619
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,540
就和刚才一样当你遇到一个你喜欢的女孩时?

1620
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,540
It's a whole other ball of wax when it's a girl you like, huh?

1621
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,580
Yeah, who's the merry-andrew now?

1622
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,580
你现在变成小丑了?

1623
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,870
你想让我的姐姐不高兴!

1624
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,870
You want to vex my sister!

1625
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,170
我不得不坦白的说我自己有点糊涂了.

1626
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,170
I have to confess that I'm a little bit confused.

1627
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,130
No. Thank you.

1628
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,130
不，谢谢.

1629
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:31,980
当你叫我今晚来吃饭的时候我的感觉是我们在这儿会讨论...

1630
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:31,980
When you asked me to dinner tonight I was under the impression that we were here to discuss...

1631
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,160
合并的事.是，对，是的.

1632
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,160
- The merger. Yes. Right. Yes.

1633
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,540
- And a possible promotion. Yes.

1634
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,540
和晋升的可能性.是的.

1635
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,630
是的,是那样.

1636
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,630
Yes, that, too.

1637
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,690
但是，现在晚餐快要结束了我们还没有讨论到

1638
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,690
And, well, dinner is winding down and we haven't really discussed...

1639
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,530
...anything even remotely relevant to what I thought we came here to...

1640
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,530
任何切题的事情那些我来这儿以前想到的事情...

1641
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,380
我简直没有想到会看到你这样的激动，Kate.你甚至还没有吻过我.

1642
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,380
I don't believe I've ever seen you this flustered, Kate. You haven't even kissed me yet.

1643
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,810
是.对.那是.....

1644
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,810
Yeah. Right. Well...

1645
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,450
I like you, J.J., I do. I like you quite a bit.

1646
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,450
我喜欢你, J.J.,真的.我真的有点喜欢你.

1647
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:06,550
但是事实上我想你会同意那是种工作.......

1648
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:06,550
Um, as a matter of fact I think you would agree that a working...

1649
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:10,480
一种成功的工作关系是一种在相互合作中产生的.....

1650
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:10,480
...a successful working relationship requires a great deal of...

1651
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,610
What exactly is our working relationship?

1652
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,610
非常愉快的工作关系?

1653
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,030
Hi, Kate!

1654
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,030
嗨, Kate!

1655
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,540
嗨,查理.

1656
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,540
Hi, Charlie.

1657
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,420
Well... what are you doing here?

1658
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,420
你们怎么到这儿来了?

1659
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,440
我们只是从这儿路过-顺便进来打个招呼.-J.J., 行吗?-行.

1660
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,440
- We just thought we'll come by to say hi. J.J., right?  Right.

1661
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,980
我可以和你讲句话吗?现在?

1662
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,980
- Kate. Might I have a word with you? Now?

1663
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,330
- In private. No! No.

1664
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,330
-私下讲.不，不.

1665
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,170
黄油先生.

1666
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,170
Mr. Margarine.

1667
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,470
请... 请和我们一起吧.

1668
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,470
Please... please join us.

1669
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,520
- And where did you say it is? In Sussex.

1670
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,520
你刚才说那是在什么地方?-在苏克斯郡.

1671
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,150
-靠近巴勒莫.-对.

1672
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,150
- Near Ballmour. Yes.

1673
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,040
-是18世纪建造的.早于18世纪.

1674
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,040
- Built in the 18th century. Early 18th century.

1675
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,120
Really? Are you quite sure?

1676
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,120
是吗?你这么肯定?

1677
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,720
- Yes. He's got pictures, Leopold.

1678
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,720
是的.他有照片，Leopold.

1679
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,940
Perhaps you were swindled, because I can assure you...

1680
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,940
也许你在骗人,因为我可以象你保证

1681
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,490
...as of the late 19th century there's nothing but farmland near Ballmour.

1682
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,490
应该是在19世纪以后那时靠近巴勒莫那儿什么都没有只有农田.

1683
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,500
-你搞错了.-那不可能.

1684
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,500
- You're mistaken.  That's not possible.

1685
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,550
是吗，确实是那样,Leopold,你搞错了.

1686
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,550
Well, it's quite possible, Leopold, that you are mistaken.

1687
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,520
不，我没有错.

1688
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,520
No, it is not.

1689
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,690
...那是那个郡唯一的一个庄园.我知道是因为我在那儿长大的.

1690
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,690
...the only manor house in the county. I know because I grew up there.

1691
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,990
Leopold, it wasn't...

1692
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,990
Leopold,它是.....

1693
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,540
- Leo, do you enjoy opera? I do. And do you?

1694
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,540
Leo,喜欢歌剧吗?-喜欢，你喜欢吗?

1695
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,470
-噢，喜欢.歌剧让我..感觉到生活.

1696
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,470
Oh, yes. It keeps... keeps me alive.

1697
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,400
你有什么喜爱的歌剧吗?Bohne. La Bohne.

1698
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,400
- Do you have a favorite? Boheme. La Boheme.

1699
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:22,210
I've seen it 12 times. That's... that's how I learned to speak French.

1700
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:22,210
我看了12遍了.那个剧让我.. 让我开始学说法语.

1701
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,460
你会讲法语?很流利.

1702
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,460
- You speak French? Fluently.

1703
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,710
What did he say?

1704
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,710
他刚才说什么?

1705
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,730
"How sweet your face looks gently encircled by the soft moonlight."

1706
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,730
"你的脸在温柔的月光下看起来是多么的漂亮."

1707
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,580
Oh, I like that.

1708
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,580
噢，我喜欢.

1709
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,090
From the opening scene of Boheme. A stunning duet.

1710
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,090
这是Bohne那场剧的第一个场景.一个令人眩晕的二重唱.

1711
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,220
- Andre sings it to Mimi. Andre...

1712
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,220
Andre唱给Mimi的.Andre...

1713
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,360
I invited Kate to the Met next week. She's never been.

1714
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,360
我要请Kate下礼拜见面.她不会来.

1715
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,950
Patrone is singing Andre, and she turned me down.

1716
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,950
我向她示爱她却让我失望.

1717
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,210
你可以解释这是为什么吗，Leopold?

1718
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,210
Can you explain that, Leopold?

1719
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,300
是这样..

1720
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,300
Well...

1721
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,560
La Boheme is one of man's great achievements and should not be missed.

1722
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,560
歌剧中的男主角是个有抱负的男人确实不会让女士失望.

1723
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:12,940
But perhaps Kate resists on moral grounds.

1724
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:12,940
但是也许Kate拒绝是有她自己的道德基准.

1725
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,260
为什么?

1726
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,260
How so?

1727
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,590
- Should we get the check? Well...

1728
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,590
我们结帐了吧?

1729
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:19,140
...some feel that to court a woman in one's employ...

1730
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:19,140
有人觉得自己是上司就可以向蛇一样的去纠缠自己的下属

1731
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:23,650
就一定能够得逞？.

1732
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:23,650
...is nothing more than a serpentine effort to transform a lady to a whore.

1733
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,080
J.J.
J.J.

1734
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,080


1735
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,440
这个家伙很有魅力, Kate.

1736
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,440
This guy's charming, Kate.

1737
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,160
黄油公爵认为我是一条毒蛇.

1738
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,160
The Duke of Margarine thinks me a serpent.

1739
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,590
- No, he doesn't. No, not a serpent.

1740
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,590
-不，他不是-不，不是条毒蛇.

1741
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,640
That's too grand a word. Simply a braggart and a cad...

1742
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,640
那样说太过火了.最多就是个自夸和粗俗的人而已

1743
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,900
有谁会比我知道更多的法语.

1744
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,900
...who knows less French than I, if that's possible.

1745
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:55,040
顺便说一下在那出歌剧中没有Andre这个人.

1746
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:55,040
And by the way there's no Andre in Boheme... it's Rudolfo.

1747
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,050
And though it takes place in France it's rarely played in French...

1748
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,050
尽管这事发生在法国但歌剧很少在法国上演,

1749
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,730
...as it is written in Italian. Good night.

1750
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,730
而且它是用意大利文写的.晚安.

1751
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,590
Sorry.

1752
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,590
对不起.

1753
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,640
Kate, might I have a word?

1754
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,640
Kate,可以给你讲句话吗?

1755
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,740
- Morning. Hi.

1756
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,740
-早晨好.-嗨.

1757
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,840
- You want some coffee?  No, thanks.

1758
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,840
-要不要点咖啡?-不,谢谢.

1759
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,100
- You want to read... you want to read your paper?  No, thank you, Charlie.

1760
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,100
你要不要读一下...读一下你的报纸再走?不了,谢谢,查理.

1761
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,820
我要去上班了那吃点这个你洗干净了的水果.

1762
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,820
I want to go to work and try and clean up this mess you made.

1763
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,860
You sure you don't...

1764
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,860
你肯定你不要..

1765
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,150
Kate...噢, Kate!

1766
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,150
Kate... Uh, Kate!

1767
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,290
- What? - I-I just thought maybe you'll want a-a kiwi for-for-for the subway.

1768
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,290
-什么?-我-我-只是想也许你想要个狝猴桃可以在地铁上吃.

1769
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,100
- That's a papaya, Charlie. Oh. You're right. Okay.

1770
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,100
那是蕃木瓜,查理.哦.你说得对,好吧.

1771
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,050
But while using the product...

1772
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,050
在我们使用这个产品的时候

1773
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:05,950
80%的人发现这个产品太硬以至于不能...

1774
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:05,950
...80% found the product too soft to be...

1775
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,880
起到有效的作用.

1776
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,880
...effective.

1777
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:11,980
现在,这个给我们的市场研究人员推出了一个新的课题.

1778
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:11,980
This, of course, presents a conundrum for us marketeers.

1779
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:19,590
我们怎样能够在用保鲜膜存放东西的时候

1780
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:19,590
How do we maintain a soft feel on the exterior of a plastic wrap or pack while retaining...

1781
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:24,350
...the useful tensile strength in the sheets?

1782
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:24,350
让外面感觉到是柔软的质地利用塑胶的扩展张力?

1783
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,650
Now, I'm going to suggest to the Summer Soft people...

1784
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,650
现在我建议将现有的产品在夏季

1785
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:29,150
投放到欧美市场

1786
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:29,150
...to scale back to a limited release of the product...

1787
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:33,130
以便我们能够根据使用情况对这个产品继续开发

1788
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:33,130
...in the mid-Atlantic states, where we can refine the product...

1789
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,210
...on the basis of extensive...

1790
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,210
根据使用情况再定...

1791
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,650
亲爱的Katherine...(凯塞琳kate的全称)

1792
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,650
Dearest Katherine...

1793
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,080
I behaved as an imbecile last night...

1794
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,080
我昨晚由于在晚会上喝了点酒表现出极度的愚蠢

1795
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,540
...animated in part by drink...

1796
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,540
在某种程度上讲是因为你的美丽

1797
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,930
另反面也是因为我自己愚蠢的自得.

1798
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,930
...in part by your beauty and in part by my own foolish pride.

1799
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,280
And for that I am profoundly sorry.

1800
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,280
对那些所作所为我深深的表示歉意.

1801
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,790
Please accept as a gesture of apology...

1802
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,790
请把这作为我的道歉吧

1803
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:59,300
今晚8点在楼顶我为你准备的晚餐.

1804
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:59,300
...a private dinner on the rooftop tonight at 8:00.

1805
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,640
Okay, where are we on Farmer's Bounty?

1806
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,640
好了,我们的农场产品怎样了?

1807
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,190
Kate?
Kate?

1808
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,190


1809
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,910
要不要拿出来给我们看看?

1810
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,910
Care to share with us?

1811
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,590
Farmer's Bounty?

1812
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,590
农场产品?

1813
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,220
讲到这个.

1814
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,220
Where we are.

1815
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,890
讲到这个非常好.

1816
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,890
Where we are is good.

1817
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,820
Um, as you know, we found our spokesperson.

1818
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,820
嗯,就如你们知道的那样,我们找到了一个产品代言人.

1819
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,700
The response room final showed a 96 in the top two boxes.

1820
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,700
市场的反应率上升了96%.

1821
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,510
His key female descriptors...

1822
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,510
女性中对他的描述是...

1823
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,020
英俊,罗曼蒂克

1824
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,020
were "handsome", "romantic" with several write-ins of...

1825
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,900
有人在调查表中写的是"真是个漂亮英俊的男人"

1826
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,900
"What a hunk."

1827
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,160
太好了.

1828
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,160
Great.

1829
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:42,940
J.J.?  J.J.?

1830
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:42,940


1831
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,210
J.J., hi.

1832
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,210
J.J.,嗨.

1833
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,680
Um, listen, I just want to apologize again

1834
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,680
嗯,听着,我只是想再给你道个歉

1835
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:51,510
for what happened last night. There was no need for things to get that way.

1836
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:51,510
为昨天晚上发生的事情.不要再记着昨天那些事情了.

1837
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,050
I appreciate that.

1838
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,050
谢谢你.

1839
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,520
那... 你没事吧?

1840
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,520
So... everything's okay?

1841
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,730
没事, Kate.

1842
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,730
Yes, Kate.

1843
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,020
I didn't jump; I fell.

1844
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,020
我没有跳,我只是感觉.

1845
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,850
There's a difference... a subtle difference, but nonetheless a difference.

1846
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,850
有点不一样--很微妙的感觉,但反正不一样.

1847
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,980
- So, why did you fall down there? Because there was no elevator.

1848
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,980
那么你是如何掉下去的呢?因为电梯没有在那儿.

1849
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,590
And you feel that was your fault?

1850
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,590
你觉得那是你自己的错误?

1851
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,710
你看...

1852
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,710
Look...

1853
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,190
You know what, I'm sorry.

1854
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,190
你知道吗,我很抱歉.

1855
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:30,470
I got to concede that you are a very busy man...

1856
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:30,470
我不得不承认你是个非常忙的人

1857
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,900
...and I'm sure there are plenty of people clamoring for your particular brand of attention.

1858
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,900
而且外面还有很多的病人在等着你需要你特别的治疗.(马丁医生,精神病学家)

1859
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,860
Unfortunately, I am not one of them.

1860
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,860
不幸的,我不是他们其中之一.

1861
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:39,500
So if you don't mind, would you please unlock this door?

1862
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:39,500
如果你不介意,麻烦你打开这扇们?

1863
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:42,130
我只是担心你会伤害你自己.

1864
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:42,130
I'm concerned you might be a danger to yourself.

1865
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,480
And in such cases...

1866
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,480
你这种病例

1867
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,740
- Will someone please open... Aah! Aah! ...state law requires that I keep you under...

1868
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,740
-喂?!-本州的法律要求置留你在...有人可以帮我打开... 啊!啊!

1869
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,750
靠！

1870
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,750
Fuck!

1871
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,060
Everything all right, Dr. Geisler?

1872
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,060
没事吧,Geisler医生?

1873
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,560
Yes, Gretchen. Everything's fine.

1874
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,560
没事Gretchen.很好,没事.

1875
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:05,540
斯图亚特,我要给你用一种叫做普洛宁锌的药.

1876
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:05,540
Stuart, I'm going to prescribe something called Prolixin.

1877
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,430
It's a mild antipsychotic. Nothing too strong.

1878
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,430
一种温和的精神病类药.药效不会太厉害.

1879
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:17,080
"I was wondering... I was wondering if you would like to accompany me..."

1880
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:17,080
"我只是在想..."我只是在想你是否愿意和我一起....

1881
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,840
"如果你事先已经有安排..我明白.

1882
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,840
"If you've already been previously engaged I understand."

1883
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,650
Tonight at 7:00, 7:30. Please don't be late.

1884
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,650
今晚7点半.请不要迟到了.

1885
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:32,500


1886
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:32,500
我有话要给你讲,行吗?因为你写的那些东西中有一些我讲不出来.

1887
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,180
你给Patrice买了一束花没有?

1888
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,180
Did you assemble a bouquet for Patrice?

1889
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:38,560
听着,你不能这样说一位女士..."雅致,文静."

1890
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:38,560
Look, you just can't tell a woman she's... "gracefully serene".

1891
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,400
No, no, this will not do.

1892
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,400
不,不,这个不行.

1893
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,120
Wha... Why? What is wrong with this one?

1894
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,120
为什么?这个为什么不行?

1895
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:46,170
The orange lily implies extreme hatred.

1896
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:46,170
橙色的百合花暗示着极端的憎恨.

1897
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,680
The begonia and lavender danger and suspicion, respectively.

1898
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,680
秋海棠和熏衣草分别代表危险和疑心.

1899
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:52,270
每样花都有自己的意义,查理.

1900
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:52,270
Every flower has a meaning, Charles.

1901
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,860
Might I suggest the amaryllis...

1902
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,860
我建议用桂顶红,

1903
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,290
...which declares the recipient a most splendid beauty.

1904
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,290
它代表宽容与接受它总是光彩照人.

1905
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:00,800
或者用蔷薇花.

1906
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:00,800
Or the cabbage rose.

1907
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,680
Darci! Darci!

1908
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,680


1909
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,550
- What is this? It's a reply to Leopold's invitation.

1910
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,550
-这是什么?-这是个答复-给Leopold的邀请函的答复

1911
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,190
你要去,对吧?

1912
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,190
You're going, right?

1913
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,840
I haven't decided yet.

1914
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,840
我还没有确定.

1915
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,890
Oh, you haven't decided if you want to have dinner on your rooftop with a duke?

1916
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,890
哦,你还没有确定是否要..到楼顶上去和公爵吃饭?

1917
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:26,210
Who thinks he's from 1876! No!

1918
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:26,210
谁会认为他是来自于1876年!不!

1919
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,100
不过我还是要感谢...Kate,行了,好吧?

1920
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,100
- And I would appreciate it if...  Kate, come on, okay?

1921
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,950
我不知道到底他为什么让你觉得讨厌

1922
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,950
I don't know what this guy did to piss you off...

1923
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:33,670
...but that is the best apology letter in the history of mankind.

1924
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:33,670
但是我知道那封道歉信是人类历史上最完美的一封.

1925
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,350
-签了吧, Kate.现在才4点半,我给他传真过去.

1926
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,350
Just sign it, Kate. It's 4:30. We'll fax it.

1927
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,050
Kate McKay's office.

1928
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,050
Kate McKay办公室.

1929
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,390
They hung up.

1930
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,390
他们挂了.

1931
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,330
Hi. Is Patrice there?

1932
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,330
嗨,是Patrice吗?

1933
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,130
嗨, Patrice?

1934
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,130
Hey, Patrice?

1935
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,350
Hi. It's me, Charlie.

1936
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,350
嗨.是我,查理.

1937
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,850
- Hey, Charlie. I was just calling to find out...

1938
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,850
嗨,查理.

1939
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,360
...if you got my flowers... your flowers.

1940
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,360
我打电话给你只是想知道你是否收到我的花-你的花.

1941
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,330
I was calling to see if you got the flowers I sent you.

1942
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,330
我打电话给你看你是否收到我送给你的花.

1943
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,630
Yeah, I did.

1944
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,630
对,是我送的.

1945
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:08,770
同时我想问你是否愿意今晚出去和我看一场电影

1946
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:08,770
And I was just wondering if you would like to go to a movie tonight...

1947
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:13,150
...and maybe afterwards perhaps accompany me to dinner?

1948
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:13,150
然后看完电影后再和我一起去吃晚饭?

1949
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:17,170
I mean, I... I understand completely if you're otherwise engaged.

1950
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:17,170
我是说...我非常清楚有人在追求你.

1951
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:21,060
But, uh, you know, I just wanted to say that, um...

1952
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:21,060
但是,你知道,我只是想给你说...

1953
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,230
Yeah?

1954
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,230
啥？

1955
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,500
I wanted to say that you've, uh...

1956
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,500
我是想说...你.....

1957
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,390
...you've made an impression on me.

1958
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,390
你给我留下了很深的印象.

1959
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,220
And-and it-it's not just the way you look...

1960
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,220
我..我是说你看起来--

1961
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:44,150
I mean, which are great. Your looks are, you know, top-top shelf. But, uh...

1962
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:44,150
我是说你很漂亮.你看起来是最完美的.但是...哦...

1963
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,440
I don't know, it's, um...

1964
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,440
我不知道该说什么,你是...

1965
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,030
什么?

1966
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,030
What?

1967
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:57,460
你很优雅.

1968
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:57,460
You're graceful.

1969
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:01,480
You know, the way you move and speak.

1970
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:01,480
知道吗,你走路,你说话的样子.

1971
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:06,410
我的意思是,其他人也许会有更好的语言来描述

1972
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:06,410
I mean, some people have a way with words and, you know, you...

1973
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,000
知道吗,就是这样.

1974
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,000
...you do.

1975
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,510
最后我要说的是,我喜欢你!.

1976
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,510
The bottom line is, I like you.

1977
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,240
Patrice? Patrice?

1978
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,240


1979
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,670
What about 7:00?

1980
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,670
7点如何?

1981
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,890
7点?

1982
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,890
7:00?

1983
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,850
7:00 would be heaven. Okay.

1984
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,850
7点简直太好了.

1985
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,820
See you then.

1986
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,820
到时候见.

1987
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,900
真的有用!

1988
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,900
It worked! It worked cool!

1989
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,260
真是有用,太酷了!谁会和Patrice外出约会?查理会和Patrice去约会!查理会去.

1990
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,260
Who's going out with Patrice? Charlie's going out with Patrice! Charlie's going over there.

1991
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:41,100
Oh, better go get ready. Better go get changed.

1992
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:41,100
哦,最好赶紧去准备.赶紧去换身衣服.

1993
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:44,840
不要搞得太复杂因为她是喜欢我这个人.

1994
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:44,840


1995
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,490
查理,你看起来太棒了.

1996
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,490
- Hey. Charlie, you look fantastic.

1997
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,900
- Yeah?  Yeah.

1998
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,900
-是吗-是的.

1999
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:59,830
I got a date. I got to go.

2000
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:59,830
我要去约会.我要走了,

2001
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,670
再见.再见.

2002
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,670
- Bye.  Bye.

2003
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,690
- Kate?   Yeah?

2004
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,690
Kate?什么?

2005
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,780
嗯,今晚过一个愉快的晚上.

2006
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,780
Um, have a good time tonight.

2007
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,620
Bye.

2008
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,620
再见.

2009
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,730
My God.

2010
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,730
我的天.

2011
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,710
真是太美了.

2012
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,710
This is beautiful.

2013
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:10,930
真是不知道如何用语言来描述.

2014
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:10,930
The very word for which I was searching.

2015
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:14,780
May I?

2016
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:14,780
可以吗?

2017
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,840
我的妈妈非常的罗曼蒂克.

2018
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,840
She was a real romantic, my mom.

2019
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,890
When Prince Charles and Lady Di got married, she had a party.

2020
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,890
当查理斯王子和戴安娜公主结婚的时候她办了个晚会.

2021
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:41,650
她做了些煎饼和果酱.

2022
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:41,650
She made crumpets and jam.

2023
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,870
就像是美国超级橄榄球赛时那样的晚会.

2024
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,870
It was like a Super Bowl party, but for moms.

2025
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,750
She cried for a week.

2026
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,750
她还为此苦了一个星期.

2027
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,590
I don't know the story of Prince Charles and Lady Di.

2028
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,590
我不知道这个故事查理斯和戴安娜女士的故事.

2029
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,400
哦,你不会想知道的.这是一个有寓意的故事.证明...

2030
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,400
Oh, you don't want to. It's a cautionary tale. Further proof.

2031
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,030
- Of what?  You can't live a fairy tale.

2032
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,030
证明什么?你不能生活在童话中.

2033
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,680
I'm not very good with men.

2034
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,680
我和男士不一定能相处很好.

2035
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,120
Perhaps you haven't found the right one.

2036
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,120
也许你还没有找到一个合适的罢了.

2037
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,560
Maybe.

2038
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,560
也许.

2039
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,570
Or, uh, maybe the whole love thing is just a grown-up version of Santa Claus...

2040
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,570
或者所有的爱情故事都是圣诞老人的翻版

2041
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,870
都是我们从小受到的童话感染的结果

2042
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,870
just a myth we've been fed since childhood...

2043
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,220
...so we keep buying magazines and joining clubs...

2044
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,220
所以我们不停的买杂志参加各种俱乐部

2045
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,860
...and doing therapy and watching movies with hit pop songs...

2046
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,860
接受各种治疗还有看电影,唱摇滚

2047
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,650
把自己置身于爱情的蒙太奇中

2048
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,650
...played over love montages...

2049
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:49,620
...all in this pathetic attempt...

2050
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:49,620
所有的这种努力都是想从圣诞老人的烟囱中

2051
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,380
...to explain why our love Santa keeps getting caught in the chimney..

2052
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,380
找回童年时的那种梦想.

2053
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,110
Otis总是给我说爱情是一种飞跃.

2054
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,110
Otis always told me love is a leap.

2055
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,620
Lamentably, I was never inspired to jump.

2056
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,620
令人惋惜的是我还从来没有这样的灵感.

2057
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:10,770
By my 30th birthday, I had, according to my uncle, become a blemish on the family name.

2058
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:10,770
在我30岁的时候,按照我叔叔的说法我成了我家族的败类.

2059
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:14,910
So he brought me to this country with the proviso I marry an American.

2060
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:14,910
于是他把我带到了这个国家附带条件是我必须在这儿.

2061
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:18,090
A girl with a good deal of, um...

2062
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:18,090
和一个有很多(钱)的美国姑娘结婚...

2063
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,430
Charm?

2064
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,430
迷人的?

2065
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,220
Money.

2066
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,220
钱.

2067
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:26,860
Since my parents died our family fortune had become, shall we say, depleted.

2068
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:26,860
自打我父母死了以后我们家的财产逐渐耗尽了.

2069
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:32,880
I would be married now if I hadn't followed Stuart. I was to announce a bride that night.

2070
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:32,880
如果不是跟着斯图亚特来这儿我应该已经结婚了.那天晚上我要宣布谁是我的新娘.

2071
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:36,020
谁?

2072
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:36,020
Who?

2073
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,580
I don't know.

2074
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,580
我不知道.

2075
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,510
Someone. One of them.

2076
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,510
某人.她们其中之一.

2077
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,890
你干吗?

2078
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,890
What are you doing?

2079
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,100
我把它倒掉.

2080
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,100
I'm just cleaning up.

2081
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,070
Would you do me the honor of a dance?

2082
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,070
愿意和我跳个舞吗?

2083
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,290
请?

2084
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,290
Please?

2085
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,050
我不太擅长跳舞.

2086
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,050
I am not much of a dancer.

2087
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:41,180
You're doing famously, then.

2088
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:41,180
你马上就会跳得很好的.

2089
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,240


2090
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,240
Leopold, NLeopold...

2091
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,790
这真是太可爱了.

2092
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,790
...this was lovely.

2093
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,270
But I don't know if I can leap even if I am inspired.

2094
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,270
但是我不知道我是否能有一个飞跃即使是我有这样的灵感.

2095
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,010
People might think I'm brave, but I'm not.

2096
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,010
也许人们认为我很勇敢,但其实我不是.

2097
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,280
The brave are simply those with the clearest vision...

2098
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,280
勇敢有一个更简单的解释

2099
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,100
尽管喜悦和危险同在.

2100
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,100
...of what is before them.

2101
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:23,390
Glory and danger alike and notwithstanding, go out to meet it.

2102
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:23,390
直接勇敢的面对就行了.

2103
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,300
嗨.

2104
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,300
Hey.

2105
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,780
Morning, Charles.

2106
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,780
早晨好,查理.

2107
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,230
昨天傍晚和Patrice过得怎样?

2108
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,230
How was your evening with Patrice?

2109
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
很好,

2110
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Good.

2111
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:52,680
不错.

2112
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:52,680
Nice.

2113
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:54,840
你过得怎样?

2114
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:54,840
How was yours?

2115
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,760
Good.

2116
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,760
很好,

2117
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:58,510
Nice.

2118
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:58,510
不错.

2119
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,690
好了,Leo,你不觉得现在该告诉我你到底是谁了吗?

2120
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,690
So, Leo, don't you think it's time you tell me who you are?

2121
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,910
你什么意思?我是说...

2122
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,910
- What do you mean? I mean...

2123
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,800
...it's a blast doing the duke thing with you 24/7, but...

2124
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,800
你那个公爵的故事确实是让人难以接受

2125
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,470
...I don't want to see Kate go through Stuart: The Sequel.

2126
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,470
我真不想看到kate又出现和斯图亚特分手事再现.

2127
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:28,860
I know she seems pretty tough but she hasn't had it that easy.

2128
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:28,860
我知道她看起来相当的坚强但是她能挺过来也不容易.

2129
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:32,540
She's always getting stuck with people who don't hold up their end.

2130
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:32,540
她是那种经常无法摆脱自己过去的人.

2131
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:34,380
Like me.

2132
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:34,380
就像我,

2133
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,310
- I just don't... I understand, Charles.

2134
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,310
我经常...我明白,查理.

2135
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,770
- You do?  Yes.

2136
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,770
你明白?是的.

2137
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,360
那...

2138
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,360
So...

2139
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:44,950
...who are you?

2140
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:44,950
你到底是谁?

2141
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,560
I am the man who loves your sister.

2142
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,560
我是一个男人,一个爱你姐姐的男人.

2143
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,000
好了,门打开.

2144
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,000
Okay, door's open.

2145
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,180
Shut the lid.

2146
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,180
盖上盖子.

2147
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,060
Push the drawers in.

2148
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,060
把衣服放进去.

2149
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,400
关上门,然后

2150
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,400
Close the door, and...

2151
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,410
...you push this button.

2152
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,410
你按这个按钮.

2153
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:13,130
A word to the wise: Don't press that till she wakes up.

2154
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:13,130
给你出个点子在她醒来之前不要按.

2155
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,300
这样她就可以看见你在洗衣了.

2156
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,300
So she sees you doing it.

2157
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,060
Oh, clever. The proverbial tree in the woods.

2158
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,060
哦,聪明.谚语这样说的:一个男人洗碟子,

2159
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,190
If a man washes a dish and no one sees it...

2160
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,190
就好比树在森林里那是没人能够看见的...

2161
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,950
有用吗?有用.

2162
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,950
- Did it happen? Right.

2163
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:37,870
- A cup of coffee, my dear. Thank you.

2164
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:37,870
来杯咖啡,亲爱的.谢谢.

2165
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:42,180
Breakfast?

2166
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:42,180
早餐?

2167
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:53,170
Nine-grain toast with strawberries and mascarpone, madame.

2168
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:53,170
一片涂着草莓酱和义大利乳酪的面包,女士.

2169
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,350
It's...

2170
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,350
那是...

2171
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,400
...apparently low...

2172
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,400
很显然没有

2173
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,150
...in polyunsaturates.

2174
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,150
一点脂肪.

2175
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:12,940
It's really good.

2176
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:12,940
真是太好了.

2177
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,290
It's good.

2178
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,290
太好了

2179
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,140
今天我们干什么?

2180
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,140
What should we do today?

2181
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,660
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

2182
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,660
哦,别,别.....

2183
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,260
谢谢,别.

2184
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,260
Thank you. No.

2185
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:38,400
You know what makes me happy? You don't look good in those.

2186
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:38,400
你知道为什么让我笑吗?

2187
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,870
They're so completely inappropriate for you.

2188
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,870
你带上那个不好看.那个眼镜一点也不适合你.

2189
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,180
Kate. Kate.

2190
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,180


2191
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:04,060
Kate, Kate,过来.

2192
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:04,060
Kate, Kate, come.

2193
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,280


2194
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,280
Leopold? Leopold?

2195
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,250
Leopold? Leopold?

2196
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,250


2197
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,590
嗨,你要干什么?真没想到它还立在那儿.

2198
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,590
- Hey, what are you doing?  It boggles the mind that it is still here.

2199
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,850
This is my uncle's home. Well, was. This is where I lived.

2200
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,850
这是我叔叔的家.曾经是.这是我住过的地方.

2201
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,070
Good Lord.

2202
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,070
天哪.

2203
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,030
我父母的肖像画...还有我.

2204
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,030
A portrait of my parents... and me.

2205
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,510
Uh... uh, Leopold?

2206
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,510
哦... 哦, Leopold?

2207
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:31,360
Look, I just don't think that we should just be barging around here like that.

2208
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:31,360
听着, 我只是觉得我们不应该就这样鲁莽的闯进来.

2209
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:33,660


2210
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:33,660
Leopold? Leopold?

2211
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,960
My old quarters.

2212
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,960
我的卧室.

2213
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:01,750
What are you doing?

2214
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:01,750
你干吗?

2215
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:14,830
The place where I put everything I most cared for.

2216
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:14,830
我放我最秘密的东西的地方.

2217
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,810
Things I didn't want my uncle to touch.

2218
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,810
那些我不想要我叔叔看到的东西.

2219
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,930
My mother's ring.

2220
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,930
母亲的戒指.

2221
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:38,740
哦,真漂亮.

2222
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:38,740
Oh, it's beautiful.

2223
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:51,740
You know, I live on an island...

2224
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:51,740
知道吗,我住在一个岛上

2225
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,540
...connected to everything by bridges...

2226
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,540
所有的东西都通过大桥与外界连接

2227
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,130
我却从来没有走过那大桥.

2228
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,130
...and I never cross them.

2229
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,320
I've lived here for ten years, and I've...

2230
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,320
我在这儿住了十年

2231
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,270
...never been to the other side of anything.

2232
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,270
我却从来没有到过桥的那一边去看看.

2233
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:07,870
你从来没有旅行过?

2234
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:07,870
You've never traveled?

2235
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:09,800
没有.

2236
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:09,800
No.

2237
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,800
Do you...

2238
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,800
你想......

2239
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,810
什么?

2240
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,810
What?

2241
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,910
Do you miss where you're from?

2242
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,910
你思念你来的那个地方吗?

2243
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:41,350
In a way, I...

2244
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:41,350
某种程度上来讲,我........

2245
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,900
我想,..

2246
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,900
I miss...

2247
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,310
I miss its rhythm.

2248
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,310
我想念那种节奏.

2249
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,650
It was slower?

2250
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,650
很慢吗?

2251
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,430
Quite a bit slower.

2252
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,430
非常慢.

2253
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,220
- Like today? Yes.

2254
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,220
就像今天?对.

2255
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,880
- Do you hear that, Leopold? Do you hear that music?  Yes.

2256
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,880
无论你到那儿,我将跟随着你(歌词)..听到了吗, Leopold?-听到那音乐了吗?-是.

2257
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:15,330
看过那部电影吗-《帝凡尼的早餐》?

2258
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:15,330
Have you ever seen the movie Breakfast a Tiffany's?

2259
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,750
- Uh, no.  "No."

2260
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,750
哦,没有."没有."

2261
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:20,440
Not yet.

2262
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:20,440
还没有.

2263
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,870
你看见下面亮灯那儿那个家伙吗?嗯.

2264
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,870
- You see that guy down there with the light on? - Mm-hmm.

2265
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:28,820
He listens to the soundtrack...

2266
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:28,820
他每天晚上都听

2267
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:34,660
...of Breakfast at Tiffany's every night until exactly midnight.

2268
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:34,660
"在帝凡尼的早餐"中的那首曲子

2269
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:38,410
直到午夜.然后他关掉灯睡觉.

2270
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:38,410
And then he turns his light off... goes to sleep.

2271
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:06,130
Oh, that means it's Sunday. Oh, I don't want it to be Sunday.

2272
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:06,130
哦,现在是星期天了.我不想是星期天.

2273
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:11,230
我想更多的这样的日子.更多的1876年.

2274
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:11,230
I want more of this. More 1876.

2275
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:15,610
但是,kate,星期天不是不上班吗.我们还可以有更多.

2276
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:15,610
But, Kate, you don't work on Sundays. We can have more.

2277
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:21,340


2278
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:21,340
不,不.因为星期天是....我又要工作的前一天...

2279
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,140
...it gets poisoned.

2280
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,140
我已经中了毒了.

2281
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:26,320
I see.

2282
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:26,320
我明白.

2283
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:32,080
Besides, tomorrow is the day we shoot your commercial.

2284
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:32,080
另外,明天我们还要拍你那条商业广告.

2285
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,670
Kate.

2286
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,670
Kate.嗯?

2287
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:49,560
你是否愿意...?

2288
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:49,560
Would you...?

2289
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,150
Might you ever...

2290
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,150
你是否.....

2291
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:55,950
...consider...?

2292
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:55,950
...考虑...?嗯?

2293
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,460
It's time for bed.

2294
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,460
该上床睡觉了.

2295
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:21,240
- I'm so relaxed.  That's all right.

2296
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:21,240
我太放松了.没事.

2297
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,530
- You're tucking me in.  Yes.

2298
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,530
你把我抱进来的.是的.

2299
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,700
哈,你是我的Otis(仆人的名字).

2300
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,700
Huh, you're my Otis.

2301
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:50,790
Yes, Your Grace.

2302
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:50,790
是,大人.

2303
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:00,240
哦,等等.

2304
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:00,240
Oh, wait.

2305
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:03,250
Hey, hey, don't... don't go upstairs. Stay.

2306
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:03,250
嗨,嗨,别......别上楼去.待在这儿

2307
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,650
I love you, Kate McKay.

2308
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,650
我爱你, Kate McKay.

2309
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,000
烤饼,大人?

2310
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,000
Scone, Your Grace?

2311
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,590
Ah, thank you, Millard.

2312
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,590
哦,谢谢, Millard.

2313
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,990
- And you brought the Farmer's Bounty?  But of course.

2314
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,990
你给我拿来的是"农场产品"?当然.

2315
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,570
啊!新鲜的黄油.

2316
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,570
Ah! Fresh creamery butter.

2317
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,080
Is there anything more comforting?

2318
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,080
还有什么让人更舒服的东西?

2319
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:21,750
I say there is...

2320
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:21,750
我告诉你,有!

2321
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:26,720
也许你会赞同我的说法每咬一口都会感受到

2322
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:26,720
...and perhaps you'll agree when you sample fat-free Farmer's Bounty...

2323
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:31,070
...with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite.

2324
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:31,070
真正的新鲜黄油

2325
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,370
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty...

2326
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,370
货真价实的,口感舒适的农场产品.

2327
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,130
你将放心,大胆的享受新鲜黄油

2328
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,130
...you shall receive butter's luxurious comfort in your mouth...

2329
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,810
...without adding to the luxury of your waistline.

2330
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,810
满足你的饕餮快感而不担心增加你的腰围.

2331
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,570
- Farmer's Bounty.  Now, on this one

2332
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,570
-农场产品.现在,就这样

2333
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,330
咬一口,再微笑.

2334
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,330
...take a bite and smile.

2335
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:53,640
And... cut! All right, check gate.

2336
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:53,640
现在.. 停!好了,检查胶片.

2337
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,330
Good enough for me. Can we get a Dedo up here and something...

2338
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,330
-够好了.

2339
01:32:57,450 --> 01:32:59,290
哦,对不起.对不起.

2340
01:32:57,450 --> 01:32:59,290
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

2341
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:02,380
Is this an actual sample of Farmer's Bounty?

2342
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:02,380
这就是农场产品拿来的样品吗?

2343
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,880
是啊,怎么了?

2344
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,880
Yeah. Why?

2345
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:08,650
这个尝起来就像是洗马鞍的肥皂.那个不是你现在操心的问题,对吧?

2346
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:08,650
- This tastes like saddle soap. Well, that's not really your concern, now, is it?

2347
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:12,240
Not my concern? This product tastes like raw suet.

2348
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:12,240
不是我操心的?这个产品尝起来就像是生的羊板油.

2349
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:15,290
- How is that not my concern? Hey, pal, it's a paycheck!

2350
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:15,290
为什么不是该我关心的?嗨,伙计,这只是拿钱办事!

2351
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,130
-等一下.-拿钱办事?

2352
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,130
- Wait a minute. Paycheck?

2353
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:20,560
A... This is an outrage! Don't worry about the taste. Come back.

2354
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:20,560
这... 这是一种欺骗!不要操心口感问题.回来.

2355
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:23,740
- We need another shot.  Something that brings the light up on this...

2356
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:23,740
我们还要拍另外一个镜头.

2357
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,890


2358
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,890
Leopold.

2359
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,730
Leopold!

2360
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,730


2361
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,110
Leopold!

2362
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,110


2363
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:38,700
嗨! Leopold,到底怎么了?你干什么啊?他们需要你回到摄影棚去.

2364
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:38,700
Leopold, what's going on? What are you doing? They-they need you back in there.

2365
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:39,790
Do they?

2366
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:39,790
他们需要?

2367
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:43,220
Yeah. They have to shoot the rest of the spot. They're not finished yet.

2368
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:43,220
对,他们还要拍其他的镜头.他们还没有拍完.

2369
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,890
Well, I want no part of it.

2370
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,890
哦,我不想再拍了.

2371
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:49,150
- Why? Have you tasted it?

2372
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:49,150
为什么?你尝过吗?

2373
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:51,990
- Farmer's Bounty? Yes, Farmer's Bounty.

2374
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:51,990
农场产品?对,农场产品.

2375
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:54,630
是啊,我尝过了.这让人恶心.

2376
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:54,630
- Yeah, I've tasted it. It's revolting.

2377
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,220
I know.

2378
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,220
我知道.

2379
01:33:56,890 --> 01:34:00,230
You know it's revolting yet you have no qualms enlisting me to endorse it?

2380
01:33:56,890 --> 01:34:00,230
你知道这很恶心你还仍然要我来干这个事情?

2381
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:02,150
It's diet...

2382
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:02,150
这是食品

2383
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,120
...it's supposed to be awful. I mean, what is the problem?

2384
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,120
即使是它有点难吃我是说到底是什么问题?

2385
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,460
The problem is that for no reason beyond my affection for you...

2386
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,460
问题就是....我受你的影响

2387
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:11,060
我发现我自己在愚弄大众.

2388
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:11,060
...I find myself peddling pond scum to an unsuspecting public.

2389
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,150
嗨,听着,你知道吗我把我的事业全押在这上面了.

2390
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,150
Hey, listen, you know the stakes are very high for me here.

2391
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:17,070
- You can't just quit because...  Yes, I can. And so can you.

2392
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:17,070
你不能就这样不干了，因为...是，我能，你也能.

2393
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:20,460
当一个人发现自己干的事情是不值得干的时候他可以...

2394
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:20,460
When one finds oneself participating in an endeavor entirely without merit...

2395
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,550
撤退不干.不，不，

2396
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,550
- ...one withdraws. No. No.

2397
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:25,730
Because sometimes you have to do things that you don't like.

2398
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:25,730
因为有的时候你不得不干一些你自己不愿意干的事情.

2399
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:29,990
有些时候你不得不忍着点干完你已经开始干的事情.这是生活的一部分.

2400
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:29,990
Sometimes you have to suck it up and finish what you started. It's part of life.

2401
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:31,870
你说的话就像是我叔父说的.

2402
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:31,870
You sound like my uncle.

2403
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:33,880
Look, Leopold...

2404
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:33,880
听着,Leopold

2405
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,850
森食品公司是我们公司的一个重要客户.

2406
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,850
...Jansen Foods is a very important account for my company.

2407
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:39,770
If you don't go back in there then I get into a lot of trouble.

2408
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:39,770
如果你不回去继续拍我会惹上很大的麻烦.

2409
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:42,070
这个就是你在做的工作, Kate?

2410
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:42,070
Is this what you do at work, Kate?

2411
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:45,160
市场研究，蒙骗大众?

2412
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:45,160
Research methods to deceive people?

2413
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:47,590
Refine lies until they resemble truth?

2414
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:47,590
装饰谎言掩盖真实?

2415
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:49,720
It's no wonder you dread your work week.

2416
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:49,720
这让我明白了你为什么你害怕你每周的工作.

2417
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:53,770
- Oh! Man, I don't have time for this.  What has happened to the world?

2418
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:53,770
噢，算了。我没有时间给你说这些.这个世界到底发生了什么变化?

2419
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:57,620
You have every convenience, every comfort yet no time for integrity.

2420
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:57,620
现在有这么多的方便的舒适的东西享受但却没有时间表现诚实.

2421
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,800
No. What I don't have time for are pious speeches..

2422
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,800
不，我现在没有时间在一个不会整天工作的

2423
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,720
200岁的人面前说这些大话.

2424
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,720
...by 200-year-old men who've never had to work a day in their life.

2425
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:06,280
You have no idea what I've done with my life.

2426
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:06,280
你不会知道我的生活会是怎么样的.

2427
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:10,080
And you-you have no idea what I've done with mine!

2428
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:10,080
那你，你也不会知道我的生活是怎么样的!

2429
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,350
我能够有这样方便舒适的生活Leopold,

2430
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,350
I haven't had all that many comforts and conveniences, Leopold...

2431
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:16,320
...because I've been paying dues all of my life...

2432
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:16,320
是因为我整天忙碌的工作

2433
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,060
...and I'm tired, and I need a rest...

2434
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,060
我现在累了，很想休息

2435
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:23,620
但是如果我必须为生活去沿街叫卖的话我还是得去.

2436
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:23,620
...and if I have to peddle a little pond scum to get one then so be it.

2437
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,220
Very well.

2438
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,220
那好吧.

2439
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,550
We're kidding ourselves, Leopold.

2440
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,550
我们在骗自己Leopold.

2441
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,860
In point of fact I don't even really know who you are.

2442
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,860
事实上我甚至还不知道你是谁.

2443
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:54,340
You still don't believe I'm the man I say I am?

2444
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:54,340
你还是不相信我就是我告诉你的那样?

2445
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,070
We had a great weekend; that's that.

2446
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,070
我们过了一个愉快的周末就那样.

2447
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:02,200
现在是星期天了.都结束了.

2448
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:02,200
And now it's Sunday. It's over.

2449
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:27,070
There's such a lot of world...

2450
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:27,070
有这样一个世界需要

2451
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:29,830
去了解（歌词）...

2452
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:29,830
...to see...

2453
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:23,590
I know.

2454
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:23,590
我知道.

2455
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:28,730
I know, I know, it sounds crazy...

2456
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:28,730
我知道，我知道,这听起来有点疯狂--

2457
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:30,000
...talking about...

2458
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:30,000
我说的在...

2459
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:34,260
在东河上发现了时间的裂缝.

2460
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:34,260
...finding a crack in time under the East River.

2461
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,330
但是重点是，事实上是, Gretchen（人名）你知道吗...

2462
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,330
But in, in point, in point fact, Gretchen you know...

2463
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:46,900
...it is no more crazy than, uh...

2464
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:46,900
这不比一只狗

2465
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,570
发现了彩虹更疯狂.

2466
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,570
a dog finding a rainbow.

2467
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:54,350
Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.

2468
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:54,350
狗是色盲,Gretchen.

2469
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,730
它们看不见颜色.

2470
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,730
They don't see color.

2471
01:37:57,110 --> 01:37:59,530
是吗?就像我们看不见时间一样.

2472
01:37:57,110 --> 01:37:59,530
- Really? Just like we can't see time.

2473
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,120
We can feel it.

2474
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,120
我们可以感觉时间.

2475
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,380
Oh... we can feel it passing...

2476
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,380
噢... 我们可以感觉时间的流逝

2477
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,850
但是我们不能看见，这是模糊的.

2478
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,850
...but, uh, we can't see it; it's just a blur.

2479
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,860
It's like, uh...

2480
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,860
这就像是, 嗯...

2481
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,990
...it's like we're riding in a, in a supersonic train...

2482
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,990
就像是我们坐在超音速的列车上

2483
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:16,840
整个世界在我们旁边晃过.

2484
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:16,840
...and the world is just blowing by.

2485
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:20,640
But imagine if we could stop that train, Gretchen. Hmm?

2486
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:20,640
但是如果想像我们可以让列车停下,Gretchen.如何?

2487
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:24,030
Imagine if we could stop that train...

2488
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:24,030
想像我们可以停下列车

2489
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,320
下车去，

2490
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,320
...get out...

2491
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:28,710
...look around and see time for what it really is.

2492
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:28,710
到处看看，看看时间到底是什么样子.

2493
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,180
A universe...

2494
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,180
是宇宙，

2495
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:36,070
世界这就象

2496
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:36,070
...a world a thing as unimaginable as...

2497
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,910
...color to a dog.

2498
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,910
颜色对一只狗来讲

2499
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:40,000
And as real...

2500
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:40,000
是不可想像的事情.

2501
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,920
时间就会是可触摸的东西，就像是你现在坐着的椅子.

2502
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,920
...and tangible as that chair you're sitting in.

2503
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:47,270
Now, if we could see it like that...

2504
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:47,270
现在，如果你能够看到

2505
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:49,650
...I mean, really look at it...

2506
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:49,650
我是说真正的看到时间

2507
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:51,110
那，

2508
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:51,110
...then...

2509
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:56,550
...maybe we could see the flaws as well as the form.

2510
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:56,550
你就可以看到时间的裂缝是怎样生成的.

2511
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:01,310
And that's it.

2512
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:01,310
就是那样了.

2513
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,110
It's that simple.

2514
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,110
就这么简单.

2515
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,000
That's all I discovered. I'm just a...

2516
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,000
那就是我所发现的.我只是...

2517
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:11,630
...just a guy who saw a crack in a chair...

2518
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:11,630
我只是那个可以看到裂缝的人

2519
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:14,890
而其他的人看不到.

2520
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:14,890
...that no one else could see.

2521
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,450
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.

2522
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,450
我就是那只可以看到彩虹的狗.

2523
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,090
Only, uh...

2524
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,090
只是...

2525
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:27,190
...none of the other dogs believe me.

2526
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:27,190
只是其他的狗不相信我.

2527
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,040
I believe you.

2528
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,040
我相信你.

2529
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,520
I can see that some...

2530
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,520
我看到

2531
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:22,450
发生了一些事情.

2532
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:22,450
things have...

2533
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:25,000
...happened since I went away.

2534
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:25,000
..从我走了以后

2535
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:26,670
But...

2536
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:26,670
但...

2537
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:31,810
你必须回去.

2538
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:31,810
...you have to go back.

2539
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,910
You understand you'll be going back to the same day you left...

2540
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,910
你明白你必须回去回到你离开的那一天

2541
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,750
- ...April 28. Yes.

2542
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,750
4月28日.是的.

2543
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:06,550
那你知道你也许会重复一些事情.

2544
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:06,550
So you understand you might be repeating a few things.

2545
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:08,970
You might even see me.

2546
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:08,970
你还会看到我.

2547
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:11,190
Just don't follow me this time.

2548
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:11,190
只是这次不要跟着我了.

2549
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:18,080
Can I go in?

2550
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:18,080
可以进来吗?

2551
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,610
- J.J., you asked to see me?  Come on in.

2552
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,610
J.J., 你想要见我?进来.

2553
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:32,710
I understand you, uh, put out a fire at the shoot yesterday.

2554
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:32,710
我知道你昨天..在拍片的时候救了场.

2555
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,430
我猜估计是公爵先生的自我意识作怪?

2556
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,430
Guess Mr. Duke's got a bit of an ego on him, huh?

2557
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,850
Yeah.

2558
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,850
是的.

2559
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:40,190
I'm going to England this week...

2560
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:40,190
我这周到英国去

2561
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:42,480
...and I made a decision.

2562
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:42,480
我已经决定了.

2563
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:46,630
你将当纽约分公司的头儿.

2564
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:46,630
You're going to be the top New York honcho.

2565
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:50,640
那。这就是你的办公室了.

2566
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:50,640
So, this is going to be your office.

2567
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:53,110
我今晚将正式公布这事.

2568
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:53,110
I'll be making it official tonight.

2569
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,710
Thank you, J.J. Thank you.

2570
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,710
谢谢你, J.J.谢谢.

2571
01:41:58,630 --> 01:41:59,760
You earned it.

2572
01:41:58,630 --> 01:41:59,760
你应得的.

2573
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:02,600
我把全盘买下NFTC东西的合同

2574
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:02,600
I'm heading over to Jansen to sign...

2575
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,980
the buy-out papers, FTC stuff. So...

2576
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,980
交给Jeshen去签字了.好了

2577
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:07,990
那我们晚点见.

2578
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:07,990
...I'll see you later at the thing.

2579
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,620
-他说什么?-我得到了.

2580
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,620
- What did he say? I got it.

2581
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:14,550
- Oh, my God, that's wonderful! Just give me one second, I'm sorry, Darci. One second.

2582
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:14,550
哦，天哪,太好了!等一下,对不起，Darci.等一下.

2583
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:22,250

嗨，斯图亚特.

2610
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:03,750
Hey, Stuart.

2611
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,220
感觉如何?

2612
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,220
How you feeling?

2613
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:15,750
Where's Leo?

2614
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:15,750
Leo到那儿去了?

2615
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:18,300
他回家了.

2616
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:18,300
He went home.

2617
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,490
He was for real.

2618
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,490
他是真的.

2619
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,290
He was for real.

2620
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,290
他是真的.

2621
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,580
Holy shit!

2622
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,580
天哪，该死!

2623
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:11,890
快看这个!

2624
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:11,890
Look at this!

2625
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:23,880
Oh, my God.

2626
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:23,880
哦，我的天.

2627
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,380
冷冻，明白吗?冷冻.

2628
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,380
Chilled, do you understand? Chilled.

2629
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:36,380
And be sure to leave another case of the Chateau Marid.

2630
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:36,380
必定要离开另外一个城堡.

2631
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,300
是的，先生.

2632
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,300
Yes, sir.

2633
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,300
Leopold!
Leopold!

2634
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,300


2635
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,810
Leopold! Where have you been?

2636
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,810
Leopold!你到那儿去了？!

2637
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:45,450
Otis, I demand explication! It's half past 5:00! He's not even dressed!

2638
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:45,450
Otis,我需要一个解释!现在已经5点半了!他还没有打扮好!

2639
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,160
He'll be ready, my lord, I assure you.

2640
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,160
他马上就好。我的主人,我保证.

2641
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:49,920
我不是要马上就好.我是要他光彩照人!

2642
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:49,920
I don't want him ready. I want him resplendent!

2643
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:53,440
Here's the invitation. You've got your table number, your car number...

2644
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:53,440
这个是邀请函.你的桌号，汽车牌号

2645
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,780
我已经通知了那个家伙.他在麦迪森大楼.还有，你的来电的清单.

2646
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,780
...and I've got Morty down there the guy you like. He's on the Madison side. Also, your phone sheet is in here.

2647
01:44:57,870 --> 01:45:00,080
And Stuart called you a couple times. So...

2648
01:44:57,870 --> 01:45:00,080
斯图亚特打了好几次电话给你.

2649
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,630
have a great time tonight. You look beautiful.

2650
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,630
祝你过一个愉快的晚上.你看上去漂亮极了.

2651
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:44,600
我觉得我们没有走对地方.我想我们是要到麦迪森2640号.

2652
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:44,600
I don't think this is right. I'm supposed to be going to 2640 Madison.

2653
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:46,560
That's where we are, Miss McKay.

2654
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:46,560
就是这儿了,McKay小姐.

2655
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:50,580
Have a nice evening.

2656
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:50,580
晚上好.

2657
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:52,960
嗨.

2658
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:52,960
Hello.

2659
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:55,300
Hello. Invitation, please.

2660
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:55,300
你好.请出示邀请函,

2661
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,750
They're still plugs. They're just randomly seeded with Minoxidil.

2662
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,750
好的.

2663
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:07,750
对不起.

2664
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:07,750
- No cornrows. Excuse me.

2665
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,050
Hey, Kate. Congratulations.

2666
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,050
嗨，Kate.恭喜你.

2667
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,100
Thank you.

2668
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,100
谢谢.

2669
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,690
The hell with facelifts.

2670
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,690


2671
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:15,450
I'm into mini-lifts now. Just a tiny little bit each year.

2672
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:15,450


2673
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:19,330
I hear they're bringing back the 840 next year. So I'm just running out the lease.

2674
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:19,330


2675
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:21,460
-Kate,恭喜你.-谢谢你，Bob.

2676
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:21,460
- Kate, congratulations.  Thanks, Bob.

2677
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:24,430
- Hey, Kate. J.J. Hi, Barry.

2678
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:24,430
嗨, Kate.-恭喜-J.J.嗨, Barry.

2679
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,360
谢谢，非常感谢.

2680
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,360
- Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you very much.

2681
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,290
Anyway, I'm just glad they've got them fixed.

2682
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,290
不管怎样，他们终于把它修好了.

2683
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:31,090
要不我都准备把办公室搬到过道去了.

2684
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:31,090
I was going to move my office down to the lobby.

2685
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:34,970
对不起.

2686
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:34,970
Excuse me.

2687
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:41,210
Kate,不要走得太远了.我马上就要做个发言再过几分钟.

2688
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:41,210
Kate, don't powder your nose for too long. I'm going to give this speech in a couple minutes.

2689
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:42,780
Okay.

2690
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:42,780
好的.

2691
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:49,470
All this time I thought that I had pretzled fate...

2692
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:49,470
我原来考虑的所有事情都是一个谜团

2693
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:52,060
现在都解开了.但是为什么我从来没有想到过

2694
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:52,060
...and it had to be untwisted. But what I never considered...

2695
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:54,820
本来这个事情就是一个谜团.

2696
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:54,820
...is that the whole thing is a pretzel.

2697
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:58,290
A beautiful 4D pretzel of kismetic inevitability.

2698
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:58,290
一个漂亮的4D的谜团，一个不可逃避的命运.

2699
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:01,170
好了，你知道吗,在公园停车尽快赶到麦迪森楼去.

2700
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:01,170
Okay, you know what, get off Park as soon as you can, and then go up Madison.

2701
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,100
I was supposed to go back.

2702
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,100
我应该马上赶回去.

2703
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:06,940
He was supposed to come forward then he was supposed to go back again and...

2704
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:06,940
他却要到未来来，然后他应该马上又回去...

2705
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:09,500
...so was she.

2706
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:09,500
她也是.

2707
01:47:11,570 --> 01:47:13,590
Now it is my pleasure and honor...

2708
01:47:11,570 --> 01:47:13,590


2709
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:33,290
...to take priests to the bell tower.

2710
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:33,290
...把神甫带到钟楼上.

2711
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:35,860
你在谈进步与发明.

2712
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:35,860
You speak of progress and invention.

2713
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:39,080
But what I offer you down the stairs is reality.

2714
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:39,080
但是我叫你下楼，这才是现实.

2715
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,850
Take a wife. Marry.

2716
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,850
找个妻子.结婚.

2717
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:44,510
Let us not bother with this banter, Uncle.

2718
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:44,510
我们不要再开玩笑了,叔父.

2719
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:47,730
告诉我你想让谁与我结婚.那一个钱最多.

2720
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:47,730
Tell me whom you want me to marry. Well, who has the most money.

2721
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:49,450


2722
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:49,450
Well...

2723
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,880
...that would be Miss Tree of the Trees of Schenectady.

2724
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,880
那应该是tree小姐，Schenectady家族的tree小姐.

2725
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:54,010
好的.

2726
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:54,010
Good.

2727
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,260
Consider it done.

2728
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,260
决定好了.

2729
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:59,150
Otis,去把戒指拿来.我会在午夜宣布我的决定.

2730
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:59,150
Otis, fetch the ring. I will announce at midnight.

2731
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:03,620
- Invitation, please. Uh, hello. My name is Stuart Besser.

2732
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:03,620
请出示请柬.噢，你好.我叫斯图亚特.贝塞耳.

2733
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:06,760
I'm sorry, I know we're not on your list but his sister is Kate McKay;

2734
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:06,760
对不起，我知道我们没有在名单上但是他的姐姐是Kate McKay;

2735
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,560
她在这儿工作.对不起，我不能让你们进去.

2736
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,560
- ...she works here. I'm sorry, sir, I can't just let you in.

2737
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:17,630
...and I learned that there was one thing that I could do...

2738
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:17,630
...我知道了我能够做一件事情...

2739
01:48:17,710 --> 01:48:21,970
...and it didn't require money and it didn't require a fancy school.

2740
01:48:17,710 --> 01:48:21,970
这不需要金钱这也不需要更多的训练.

2741
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:25,070
I learned that I could please people.

2742
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:25,070
我知道了我可以让人们高兴.

2743
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:28,290
And there is nothing wrong with that!

2744
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:28,290
这一点没错!

2745
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:30,670
I am a people pleaser, people!

2746
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:30,670
我是个开心大众的人, 大众!

2747
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:36,980
非常感谢.我很...

2748
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:36,980
Thank you so much. I am so...

2749
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,070
Kate!
Kate!

2750
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,070


2751
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:41,080
Stuart! Charlie! What are you doing?

2752
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:41,080
斯图亚特!查理！你们来干什么?

2753
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,790
看一下这些照片，Kate.

2754
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,790
Take a look at these pictures, Kate.

2755
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:44,550
- No! No-no-no-no! Now it's time to introduce the woman...

2756
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:44,550
不! 不－不－不!现在，我要给你们介绍以为女士

2757
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:46,970
...who's going to be holding down the fort in our New York offices...

2758
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:46,970
她将负责我们在纽约的公司

2759
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:50,770
我们刚刚升起的一颗新星,Kate McKay小姐!

2760
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:50,770
...our own little rising star, Miss Kate McKay!

2761
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:54,200
- They're introducing me downstairs right now!  Just listen to me for a second, okay, please?

2762
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:54,200
你们听我说好吧?他们在楼下开始介绍我了!

2763
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:56,250
I'm sorry I was a lousy boyfriend.

2764
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:56,250
对不起我曾是个糟糕的男朋友.

2765
01:48:56,330 --> 01:48:59,640
对不起我曾经让你失望.我知道你想要的只是一个可以信赖的人...

2766
01:48:56,330 --> 01:48:59,640
I'm sorry I let you down. I know all you wanted was someone you could trust...

2767
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:03,060
Oh, Stuart, really I can't talk about our relationship right now.

2768
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:03,060
喔，斯图亚特，真的我现在不能在这儿谈我们的关系如何.

2769
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,190
Please.

2770
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,190


2771
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:07,330
我们不应该再浪费时间了.

2772
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:07,330
Maybe we weren't such a waste of time after all.

2773
01:49:07,450 --> 01:49:10,920
我是说，对你来讲我还是一个有用的人.你在讲什么啊?

2774
01:49:07,450 --> 01:49:10,920
- I mean, maybe there's a reason I was your guy.  What are you talking about?

2775
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:15,270
Maybe I was supposed to help you find your guy... Leopold.

2776
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:15,270
也许我可以帮助你找到你的那个朋友... Leopold.

2777
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:18,860
You got to go back, Kate.

2778
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:18,860
你应该回到过去, Kate.

2779
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,200
你应该回到那儿去.

2780
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,200
You got to go back there.

2781
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,260
Go back?

2782
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,260
回去?

2783
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:26,470
怎么回去?

2784
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:26,470
How?

2785
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,230
You have to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes.

2786
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,230
你只有从布鲁克林大桥跳下去在未来的23分钟以内.

2787
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:32,070
Kate? Kate?

2788
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:32,070


2789
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,750
Kate!

2790
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,750


2791
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:36,750
Kate, just look at the pictures, okay?

2792
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:36,750
Kate,你看一下照片行吗?

2793
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,480
- Is there a... a Kate McKay in the house? - Yeah.

2794
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,480
房子里是不是有一个Kate McKay?

2795
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:57,400
啊，我在这儿!Kate?

2796
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:57,400
- Here I am!  Kate?

2797
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:01,040
Here she is. Here she is.

2798
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:01,040
她来了，她来了.

2799
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:06,100
那，我就不在啰嗦了

2800
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:06,100
Well, without further ado the new senior vice president...

2801
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,340
我们纽约公司的新的副总裁.

2802
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,340
...of our New York offices.

2803
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:10,310
她来了, 女士们先生们-- Kate McKay.

2804
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:10,310
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen... Kate McKay.

2805
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:17,680
你没事?没事.对不起.

2806
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:17,680
- You okay?  Yeah. I'm sorry.

2807
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:20,600
谢谢你.特殊的入场,是吗?

2808
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:20,600
- Thank you. Quite an entrance, huh?

2809
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:23,530
Thank you, J.J. Thank you very much.

2810
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:23,530
谢谢, J.J.谢谢你们.谢谢你们. 谢谢.

2811
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:25,270
Wow.

2812
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:25,270
啊，

2813
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:27,110
Well...

2814
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:27,110


2815
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,130
...it's a great night.

2816
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,130
真是一个美好的夜晚.

2817
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:31,260
We here at...

2818
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:31,260
我们在

2819
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:37,610
CRG总是认为自己的宗旨是能够发现“大众的需求”

2820
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:37,610
...CRG have always considered ourselves to be in the "Find what people want" business and at Jansen...

2821
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:40,710
...you guys are in the "Make what people want" business.

2822
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:40,710
而在Jansen公司,你们这些人的宗旨是总是能够满足：大众的需求“

2823
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:43,380
So, imagine what we can do together.

2824
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:43,380
那，可以想像如果是我们合作.

2825
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:47,730
我们就可以共同去找到顾客的需要

2826
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:47,730
We'll be able to find out exactly what people want...

2827
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:50,240
...and make it for them.

2828
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:50,240
然后一起去满足他们.

2829
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,460
So... yeah, so our customers...

2830
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,460
这样.... 我们的顾客...

2831
01:50:54,170 --> 01:50:57,430
我们的顾客，就将获得最直接的...

2832
01:50:54,170 --> 01:50:57,430
...will be able to get exactly...

2833
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:05,750
...what they...

2834
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:05,750
嗯...他们...

2835
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:10,590
...they want.

2836
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:10,590
...他们的需要.

2837
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,890
和，嗯...

2838
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,890
And, uh...

2839
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,110
...it's a great thing to...

2840
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,110
...这是最好的事情...

2841
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:47,210
...to get what you want. Uh, it's a really good thing.

2842
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:47,210
能够得到你想要的东西.这是最好的事情.

2843
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:50,380
除非是你觉得你想要的不是真实的

2844
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:50,380
Unless what you thought you wanted wasn't really...

2845
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:53,600
...what you wanted because what you really...

2846
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:53,600
你想要的因为那确实是你所...

2847
01:51:53,730 --> 01:51:54,730
...wanted...

2848
01:51:53,730 --> 01:51:54,730
...想要的

2849
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,790
...you couldn't imagine, or you didn't think it was possible.

2850
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,790
你简直不能想像或者根本没有想到这是可能的事

2851
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:02,840
But...

2852
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:02,840
但是...

2853
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:06,650
...but what if someone came along who knew...

2854
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:06,650
但是如果来了这么一个人他不用询问就知道

2855
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:09,070
你心里在想什么?

2856
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:09,070
...exactly what you wanted without asking?

2857
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,040
They just knew. Like they could...

2858
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,040
他就是知道.就像是他能够...

2859
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:13,310
听到你心跳的声音

2860
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:13,310
hear your heart beating...

2861
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:15,020
或者可以感觉到你的思想.

2862
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:15,020
or listen to your thoughts...

2863
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:19,060
And what if they were sure of themselves...

2864
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:19,060
如果他是那样的感到对自己的确定

2865
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,780
...and they didn't have to take a poll...

2866
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,780
还有对自己的信心

2867
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:23,700
还有他爱你...

2868
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:23,700
...and they loved you...

2869
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:26,710
还有你却感到踌躇?

2870
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:26,710
...and you hesitated?

2871
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,650
嗯...

2872
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,650
And...

2873
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:35,570
还有.. 我必须走了.

2874
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:35,570
I have to go.

2875
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:38,750
I, uh...

2876
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:38,750
我，...

2877
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,430
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

2878
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,430
我必须走了.

2879
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:45,900
Kate? Kate?

2880
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:45,900


2881
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:54,340
Stuart, can you tell me...

2882
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:54,340
斯图亚特，你可以告诉我吗

2883
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:58,150
...in short, complete sentences featuring no words over two syllables...

2884
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:58,150
说短点，简单点不要拖泥带水

2885
01:52:58,230 --> 01:53:00,360
...why exactly I am in these pictures?

2886
01:52:58,230 --> 01:53:00,360
为什么我在这些照片里?

2887
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,950
- Probably not.  Try.

2888
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,950
也许不.想想.

2889
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:03,790
- Because you were there. - I wasn't.

2890
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:03,790
-因为你在那儿-我不在.

2891
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:06,420
我应该记得.相信我, 我应该记得-如果我在那儿.

2892
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:06,420
I would remember. Believe me, I would remember if I was there.

2893
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:09,310
- Because you're going to be there.  If we get there in time.

2894
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:09,310
-因为你正打算去那儿.如果我们准时到那儿.

2895
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,230
These are pictures of the past, not the future.

2896
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,230
这些是过去的照片，不是将来.

2897
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:15,580
不完全.理论上讲如果你在将来回到过去

2898
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:15,580
Not exactly. Theoretically speaking if you go to the past in the future...

2899
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:17,500
...then your future lies in the past.

2900
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:17,500
那你的将来就存在于过去之中.

2901
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:21,840
And that is a picture of you in the future in the past.

2902
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:21,840
这就是照片上的你既在将来，又在过去.

2903
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:24,310
我们必须跑过去了，我们走.

2904
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:24,310
We have to make a run for it. Let's go.

2905
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:28,160
Come on, come on.

2906
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:28,160
快点，快点.

2907
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:30,410
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

2908
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:30,410
我们走，我们走，快点!

2909
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:34,680
噢，你们在就想这个样子走了?6.80的车费，伙计.

2910
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:34,680
Whoa, where the hell do you think you're going? $6.80 on the meter, pal.

2911
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,860
It's going to close, Kate! Come on!

2912
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,860
就要关了, Kate!快点!

2913
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:48,850
女士们，先生们,请大家注意?

2914
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:48,850
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?

2915
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:50,470
Albany的公爵将在20分钟后

2916
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:50,470
The Duke of Albany...

2917
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,690
...will be making a very important announcement...

2918
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,690
在这个地方

2919
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:55,570
...in 20 minutes from this very stage.

2920
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:55,570
作出一项重要的声明.

2921
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:57,770
And I believe it shall be an announcement...

2922
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:57,770
我相信这个声明能够

2923
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:59,280
配合我们

2924
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:59,280
...that will justify...

2925
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,070
...the playing of a bridal waltz.

2926
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,070
播放的婚礼华尔滋舞曲.

2927
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,970
好了..这是最困难的一个部分.

2928
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,970
Okay... this is the hard part.

2929
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:14,560
- What? The girder.

2930
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:14,560
-什么?-那个大梁.

2931
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:17,190
- The girder? You have to cross the girder, Kate.

2932
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:17,190
大梁?你必须走到大梁那边去, Kate.

2933
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:21,450
那个大梁?

2934
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:21,450
That girder?

2935
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,910
- Stuart, I can't cross that girder. I can't go across... You love him, right?

2936
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,910
斯图亚特，我走不到大梁那边去.-我不敢过去..-你爱他，对吧?

2937
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:27,000
What?

2938
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:27,000
什么?

2939
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,120


2940
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,120
Leopold. Leopold.

2941
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:30,650
You love him, right?

2942
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:30,650
你爱他，是吧?

2943
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:33,700
是.

2944
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:33,700
Yeah.

2945
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:36,670
那就是你要知道的,现在过去.

2946
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:36,670
That's all you need to know. Now go.

2947
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:39,050
- You'll be fine.  Katie...

2948
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:39,050
-你会没事的.-Katie...

2949
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:40,680
Charlie...

2950
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:40,680
查理...

2951
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:43,900
- Charlie, what am I... How are you... No, don't worry about me.

2952
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:43,900
查理,我该......你怎么办...别，别为我担心.

2953
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:46,870
-现在, kate，现在.-现在?

2954
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:46,870
- Now, Kate, now. Now?

2955
01:54:46,990 --> 01:54:48,370
The portal's going to close.

2956
01:54:46,990 --> 01:54:48,370
入口就要关闭了.

2957
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:49,710
- All right. Go.

2958
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:49,710
-好吧.-走.

2959
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,680
-天哪.-哇!

2960
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,680
- Jesus. Whoo!

2961
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:55,020
Oh, God.

2962
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:55,020
噢，上帝.

2963
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:56,360
你可以做到.

2964
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:56,360
You can do it.

2965
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:59,030
Don't look down.

2966
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:59,030
不要看下面.

2967
01:55:04,170 --> 01:55:05,180


2968
01:55:04,170 --> 01:55:05,180
Shit.

2969
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,730
Charlie...

2970
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,730
查理...

2971
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:27,750
我永远爱你.

2972
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:27,750
I'll love you forever.

2973
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:30,590
爱你.

2974
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:30,590
Love you.

2975
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,400
It's okay.

2976
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,400
没事的.

2977
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:43,460
Lady... lady, what are you doing?

2978
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:43,460
女士... 女士,你在干什么?

2979
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:45,550
- Step back, lady. It's okay.

2980
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:45,550

Step back from there, lady. Come back, lady.

2983
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,790
Central, be advised This is Breech Post Four.

2984
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,790
总台，注意这是四号巡逻员.

2985
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:56,340
I've got a jumper on the southwest location of the bridge.

2986
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:56,340
我这儿有一个跳桥的人在大桥的西南位置.

2987
01:55:56,420 --> 01:56:00,520
立即出动NESU和港口救护队到这个位置.

2988
01:55:56,420 --> 01:56:00,520
Have a supervisor, ESU and Harbor respond to this location forthwith.

2989
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,550
Ladies and gentlemen...

2990
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,550
女士们，先生们

2991

...it is with a glad heart and a bright eye that I proudly introduce...

2992
01:56:22,630 --> 01:56:26,480

2994
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:29,610
自豪的介绍我的侄儿Leopold,

Albany公爵.

2997

Thank you, Uncle Millard. Thank you.

2998
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:34,670
谢谢.谢谢你,Millard叔叔.谢谢.

2999
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:36,650
对不起，女士这是一个私人的聚会.

3000
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:36,650
I'm sorry, madam, but this is a private affair.

3001
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,810
No, you don't seem to understand.

3002
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,810
不，你看来没有弄明白.

3003
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:41,610
I need to get inside. I need to get inside right now and...

3004
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:41,610
我需要进去.我需要现在就进去..

3005
01:56:41,690 --> 01:56:43,400
What seems to be the problem?

3006
01:56:41,690 --> 01:56:43,400
到底有什么事情?

3007
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:45,670
- Are you Otis? Well...

3008
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:45,670
你是Otis吗?好了,

3009
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,720
...let us proceed. Please raise your glasses...

3010
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,720
让我们继续.请大家举杯...

3011
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:52,790
...so we may toast to my bride-to-be...

3012
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:52,790
为我未来的新娘....

3013
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:58,750
...the woman whose welfare and happiness shall be my solemn duty to maintain.

3014
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:58,750
一个尽职的，能使生活更美满的女人

3015
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:02,800
The future Duchess of Albany...

3016
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:02,800
-噢!-未来的公爵夫人是...

3017
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:09,110


3018
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:09,110
Kate McKay....Kate McKay...

3019
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:16,260
家族是......?

3020
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:16,260
Of the McKays of...?

3021
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,810
Massapequa.  Massapequa.

3022
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,810


3023
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,030


3024
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,030
Massapequa. ...Massapequa.

3025
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,400
I Love You.I Love You.

3026
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,400
我爱你.我爱你.

3027
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:22,700
If I caught the world
in a bottle

3028
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:27,400
And everything was still
beneath the moon

3029
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:33,900
Without your love,
would it shine for me?

3030
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:37,490
If I was smart as Aristotle

3031
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:42,370
And understood
the rings around the moon

3032
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:47,870
What would it all matter
if you loved me?

3033
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:53,510
Here in your arms where
the world is impossibly still

3034
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:57,220
With a million dreams
to fulfill

3035
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:02,350
And a matter of moments
until the dancing ends

3036
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:07,980
Here in your arms when
everything seems to be clear

3037
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:11,730
Not a solitary thing
would I fear

3038
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:17,570
Except when this moment comes

3039
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:21,370
If I caught the world
in an hourglass

3040
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:25,700
Saddled up the moon
so we could ride

3041
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:31,250
Until the stars grew dim

3042
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:35,880
Until...

3043
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:39,180
One day
you?l meet a stranger

3044
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:44,180
And all the noise
is silenced in the room

3045
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:49,810
to some mystery

3046
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:53,650
In the moonlight
and everything shatters

3047
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:58,360
known her all your life

3048
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:04,120
in history

3049
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:09,920
Here in your arms where
the world is impossibly still

3050
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,540
With a million dreams
to fulfill

3051
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:18,590
And a matter of moments
until the dancing ends

3052
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:24,350
Here in your arms when
everything seems to be clear

3053
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:28,140
Not a solitary thing
do I fear

3054
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:33,690
Except when this moment

3055
02:00:37,070 --> 02:00:41,110
Oh, if I caught the world
in an hourglass

3056
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:45,620
Saddled up the moon
and we would ride

3057
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:51,290
Until the stars grew dim

3058
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:58,550
Until the time
that time stands still

3059
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:05,010
Until...
