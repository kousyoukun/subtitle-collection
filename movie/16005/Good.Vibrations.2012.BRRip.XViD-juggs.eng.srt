1
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,920
# I wandered so aimless
Life filed with sin

2
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:14,800
# I wouldn't let my
dear saviour in

3
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:19,555
# Then Jesus came like
a stranger in the night

4
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:24,976
# Praise the Lord, I saw the light

5
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:30,064
# I saw the light, I saw the light

6
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:34,652
# No more darkness
No more night

7
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:39,365
# Now I'm so happy
No sorrow in sight

8
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:44,704
# Praise the Lord,
I saw the light

9
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:48,416
Once upon a time,
in the city of Belfast,

10
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,377
there lived a boy named
Terry, with a "Y".

11
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,715
# I saw the light, I saw the light #

12
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,634
And everything in Terry's
garden was rosy.

13
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:02,430
Well, nearly everything.

14
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:03,639
Fenian lovers!

15
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,348
Fuck off back to England!

16
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,766
Commie bastard!

17
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:08,059
Go on, get him.

18
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,937
My dad's not a communist,
he's a socialist!

19
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,815
And then Terry was Terri with an "I".

20
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:17,736
Is he gonna be blinded?

21
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,823
He's going to be fine.
I'm afraid it will mean a glass eye.

22
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,784
He's just gonna see
things differently.

23
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,934
What a fucking nightmare!

24
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:34,686
Mind you your language.

25
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,980
And they call this a revolution?

26
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,983
Meanwhile, there was
another day of rioting

27
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,985
across the city,
with petrol bombs...

28
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,071
Some people did call it a revolution.

29
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:49,284
Some people called it "The Troubles",
an equally useless word.

30
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:54,622
I'd been going out in this
town since I was 15.

31
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:59,210
I saw Roy Orbison at the Ritz.
I saw the Rolling Stones at the Ulster Hall.

32
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:04,923
I saw Dylan. I saw Hendrix. I saw the Who.
The Animals. I saw the Kinks.

33
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,850
I saw everyone. Everyone
who came to Belfast, that is,

34
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,727
and everyone did come.

35
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:21,106
Until they stopped coming.

36
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,444
Here.

37
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:29,865
- I thought we said ten?
- Ten for the whole night.

38
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,116
That's you finished.

39
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:33,035
Why?

40
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,454
Why? Look around you.

41
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:38,415
Nobody wants to go out any more.

42
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,083
She does.

43
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:08,194
A proper record collection should
have a track for every moment,

44
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:12,823
and this was the moment
for The Shangri-Las.

45
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,540
Are you here on your own?

46
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:25,627
I was out for a walk
and heard the music.

47
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:27,879
Thought I'd come in and see
if it was as lively as it sounded.

48
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,969
It wasn't always like this.

49
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:38,598
There were nights you had to queue
here just to get on the guest list.

50
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:43,728
I don't mean to be cheeky, but you don't
look like a man with that many friends.

51
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:45,438
Hmm.

52
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:49,734
You wanna know the truth of it?
I still have lots of friends.

53
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:56,449
Lots ofanarchist friends,
and Marxist friends,

54
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:01,203
and socialist friends, and pacifist friends,
and feminist friends and...

55
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,830
friends who were fuck-all.

56
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:17,511
And then the first shot was fired,

57
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:19,888
the first bomb exploded,

58
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:25,144
and suddenly I didn't have any more
Marxist or feminist or anarchist friends.

59
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:28,939
I just had Catholic friends
and Protestant friends.

60
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,322
And I don't consider myself either.
So...

61
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,366
So now nobody likes you?

62
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:44,996
So now I'm just a bit more choosy
about my friends.

63
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,751
Anyway, you're one to talk.
Where's your gang?

64
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:54,213
They don't like dancing
as much as I do.

65
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,758
Have you a pen?

66
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:01,262
I'm an English student.
It's compulsory.

67
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,561
Stick your name at the top of that.

68
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,363
Are you Martian?

69
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:24,075
Stop it, it's Ruth. R-U-T-H.

70
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:29,623
Well, R-U-T-H, congratulations.

71
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,043
You're the first name
on my new guest list.

72
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:43,553
D'you wanna come back
to my mum and dad's?

73
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:46,223
No. D'you wanna go back
to my mum and dad's?

74
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:47,432
No.

75
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,149
They say when you marry,
you marry your partner's friends, too.

76
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:59,652
Eric told Ruth she'd get
the arse end of that deal.

77
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,947
She laughed.
I don't think he was joking.

78
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:05,783
Eric and I had been
comrades since our teens.

79
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:08,452
It was one of those special bonds.

80
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:10,704
Part pharmaceutical,
part philosophical.

81
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:13,999
See, what baffles me...

82
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:18,754
Jamaica and Belfast have
got so much in common.

83
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,843
Cops and soldiers

84
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,973
giving people grief day in, day out.

85
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:33,644
Armed gangs wandering the streets,
murdering people for fuck-all.

86
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:38,232
Only they've got reggae,
and what have we got?

87
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,358
Shite?

88
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:41,943
Utter shite.

89
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:47,615
We stood side by side against
the dark forces on our streets,

90
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,285
especially the ones who
used to be our friends.

91
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:51,911
Marty. Ned.

92
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:54,581
- Forgotten about those.
- No kiddin'?

93
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,751
Does it not get lonely being
the last man standing?

94
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,592
Do your feet a favour, take 'em
out dancing like you used to.

95
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,388
See you around.

96
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:13,308
Fucking hope not.

97
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,272
Ruth's friends, now, Dave and Marilyn?
Dead odd people.

98
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,274
People you could talk to.

99
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:26,361
Tell you another thing I hate,
that word "communities".

100
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:29,197
Whenever anybody in Northern
Ireland says "community",

101
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:30,907
what they're really saying is "side".

102
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,493
- You're dead right, it's false
consciousness. - Whereas "collective"...

103
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:36,371
People of all religions and none
working to a common end.

104
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,041
Er, mind your feet there, Dave.

105
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,292
Turk.

106
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,505
Don't tell me.
It's Hank Williams' birthday?

107
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,425
Roy Rogers'?
Desperate Dan's?

108
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,010
Nice hat, Eric.

109
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:52,220
Terri. Are these all your clothes?

110
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:54,681
These are my clothes.
All those are my records.

111
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,099
- Terri.
- Where do you want them?

112
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:59,018
- Back room for now.
- All of them?

113
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:00,311
Terri.

114
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,899
Just came round to tell you I'm
clearing off to London for a while.

115
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:10,404
Don't take it so hard.
You're still special.

116
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,991
Got lifted the other night.

117
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,791
Couple of our old anti-war
pals were there.

118
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,293
That fucker Marty?

119
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,754
No, the other crowd.

120
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:34,595
Except, of course, they're all
a bit more pro-war these days.

121
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,265
Fuck me!

122
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,935
Told me I was lucky it wasn't a bullet.

123
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:45,438
- For what? Dealing a bit of blow?
- It's not the drugs.

124
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:48,024
It was me. It's you, Terri.

125
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:50,443
They let on like they're rebels.

126
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,155
But we show them up to be
just cops in balaclavas.

127
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:04,708
They want us off the streets.

128
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,645
You are everything to me.

129
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,984
I'll settle for being the
most important.

130
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:37,865
And who could argue with that?
It was so simple.

131
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:42,035
Swap rings, get a mortgage,
normal life.

132
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:46,206
I forgot, though,
where we were living

133
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,917
and what was passing for normality.

134
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,390
Just leave him.
Get in, will ya?

135
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,685
Terri, you say you knew this fella?

136
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,395
From the '60s.

137
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,023
He was a prick back then
and he's a prick now.

138
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,609
Only now he's a prick with a gun.

139
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:24,202
D'you think maybe it's time
we got out of here?

140
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,122
That's what they expect!
That's what they want!

141
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,648
Terri?

142
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,235
- Say that again.
- I wanna open a record shop.

143
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,444
On Great Victoria Street?

144
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,618
Bomb Alley?

145
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,917
Aye, you'll have to use
a bit of imagination.

146
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,254
So, wholefood shop down here,

147
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:20,506
I'll have the People's Printing
Press on the top floor

148
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,466
and your shop here in the middle.

149
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:25,845
Fucking brilliant!

150
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,347
Do you know how long it's been
since I had someone in here

151
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:30,641
telling me he wanted
to open something?

152
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,770
I don't suppose you've
any collateral?

153
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,105
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

154
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:39,024
These people won the
Nobel Prize, Dave.

155
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,611
One million pounds to promote
peace and love in Northern Ireland.

156
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:46,657
I and I is bringing reggae
to the people of Belfast.

157
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,992
Good luck.

158
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,457
One love.

159
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:31,659
Fucking hippies!

160
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,376
It's thought that these 10
became targets for revenge

161
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,879
following the shooting dead
of three Roman Catholics

162
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:46,840
from the same area in
a bar on Saturday night.

163
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:50,928
Following the murders, the mother of one
of the victims appealed for no retaliation,

164
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:54,056
but despite that appeal,
retaliation was swift.

165
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:57,225
Politicians across the divide have
expressed their condemnation of...

166
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,353
- What's that?
- I got a job.

167
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,190
...fears of further revenge attacks.
The murders are further evidence...

168
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,233
- Truant officer?
- Don't say anything.

169
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,945
...on either side are far from over.

170
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,698
To date, more than 1,000 people
have been killed in The Troubles,

171
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:16,702
many in circumstances that should
remind the terrorists' claims

172
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:19,372
that they have no wish
to harm innocent people.

173
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:20,706
The question of a...

174
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:31,759
You haven't anything a
bit more substantial?

175
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:35,388
You mean like a house?

176
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,392
It was pretty straightforward.
The 40 quid swung it.

177
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:43,729
But here, I might be home a bit late.
I've a wee problem to sort out first.

178
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:01,413
- Hello?
- Marty? Terri Hooley.

179
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:37,448
There were people in our town who
shot people because of their religion.

180
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,118
There were people in our town that
shot people because of their politics,

181
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:43,370
or because of something they'd said

182
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:46,290
or something someone
said they'd said.

183
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:49,668
There were people who shot people to
make sure their guns were working right.

184
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,296
Why doesn't everybody sit down?

185
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:57,009
Some of those people were sitting
in that bar when I walked in.

186
00:16:57,135 --> 00:17:00,220
And some more of them
had walked in behind me.

187
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,724
You know the old saying about
the devil and the long spoon?

188
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:16,652
Thought for a bunch of cunts like you
a few LPs ought to do the trick.

189
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,160
Well, don't all dive in at once.

190
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,264
Stick it out.

191
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:49,936
Right, now, everybody happy?

192
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:54,106
Okay. Now, can I ask you
something in return?

193
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,026
See, when this shop opens,
there's to be no coming round

194
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:01,363
looking a donation for the
Republican prisoners

195
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,032
or the Loyal Orange Widows.

196
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:09,371
Oh, and another thing,
there's to be no trying to kill me.

197
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,082
Anybody.

198
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,047
Now, what about one for the road?

199
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:33,811
That was some performance there, son.

200
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,230
- I try my best.
- Mmm-hmm.

201
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:41,110
You see them ones there,
you don't need to worry about them.

202
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:44,947
Even the crazies remember a time
before it was like this.

203
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:52,580
It's the ones coming up behind
that you need to look out for.

204
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:56,750
It'll take more than a few
LPs to buy them off.

205
00:18:57,752 --> 00:19:00,337
- You underestimate my record collection.
- Mmm?

206
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,633
Yeah, right.

207
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,795
Cheers!

208
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:48,634
Are you actually open?

209
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,052
Aye, we're open.

210
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,311
- What's your name?
- Pugwash.

211
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,063
Pugwash, get that down you.
Cheers.

212
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:22,376
I was sure there were
people like us around.

213
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:25,003
They'd just fallen down the cracks.

214
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:28,130
But we had reggae on our side,

215
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:32,134
and country, and folk,
and blues, and rockabilly

216
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:36,472
and every kind of crazy, brave
and beautiful record on our shelves.

217
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:41,018
It was only a matter of time
before we smoked 'em out.

218
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,532
Great choice!

219
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:57,827
Too Many Saviours On My Cross.

220
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:05,876
It'd have been wasted
on him anyhow, Terri.

221
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,711
You're probably right.

222
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,381
That's right, missus.

223
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:13,032
And if you've got any sense...

224
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,826
I said if you've got any sense,
you'll boycott the place.

225
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,723
Right.

226
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:24,352
Don't let the name fool you.

227
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,771
"Good Vibrations. "

228
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:29,774
Naked capitalism is what it is!

229
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:34,112
Fuck's sake, Dad!

230
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:44,581
Hey. Boys!

231
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:45,790
Run!

232
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,790
Just the one today, Terri.

233
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:32,794
Ah, Pugwash, beehives
and teenage suicide.

234
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,254
We obviously share the
same taste in women.

235
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:36,798
Three pound.

236
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,468
Have you Orgasm Addict?

237
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:44,263
- I think you've got the wrong shop.
- Buzzcocks?

238
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:45,473
- Definitely the wrong shop.
- Fuck Off?

239
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,809
- What? - "If you don't
wanna fuck me, fuck off. "

240
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:49,185
The Electric Chairs.

241
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:59,862
I thought this was supposed
to be a record shop.

242
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:06,118
- I'll order them.
- Mmm-hmm.

243
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:10,122
Now, here you go.
Hot off the press.

244
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:12,791
Here, stick that up for us.

245
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:15,502
A gig?
Who's putting this on?

246
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:16,837
Us.

247
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:20,298
And those records? Where
are you hearing all this stuff?

248
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,843
- Peel.
- John Peel?

249
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,638
Last time I heard,
he was playing Pink Floyd.

250
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:37,149
Sorry, boys.

251
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:47,908
If I'd known you were gonna drag me down
here, I'd never have printed that thing.

252
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:54,665
You know they used The Pound
as a morgue on Bloody Friday?

253
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,375
Fuck's sake, Dave.

254
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,544
There'll be nobody there!

255
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:00,379
# You're talking shit

256
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:02,756
# Oh, baby, baby,
can't you see the light?

257
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,718
# You're just talking about
somebody else's life

258
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:11,223
# You're such a bore
Can't stand you no more

259
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:15,186
# Think I'm gonna throw
up in your face

260
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:22,234
# You're a disease, babe
You're a disease

261
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:27,864
# You're a disease, babe,
your face a disease

262
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:29,908
# I don't wanna catch

263
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:35,079
# You're a disease, babe,
you're a disease

264
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:40,793
# You're a disease, babe,
your face a disease

265
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,754
# I don't wanna catch! #

266
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,928
We're The Outcasts.
Thank you very much!

267
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,145
Cops!

268
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:03,399
Ah, yes, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.

269
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:05,776
The boys in battle green.

270
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:09,655
We had a bit of history,
them and me.

271
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:12,908
You see, if we find so much as two
cigarette papers in the same room,

272
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:14,910
it will be an ex-record shop.

273
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:19,998
Of course, they had some serious shit to be
dealing with out on the streets of Belfast.

274
00:25:20,124 --> 00:25:21,750
You'd have thought their hands
would have been full.

275
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:24,670
Pinkie, that your own hair?
Let's see some ID, love.

276
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:27,673
- What age are you?
- 18.

277
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,966
Mmm-hmm, and what's your name?

278
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:33,095
Excuse me, Officer. I'd like
to report a civil war outside.

279
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:34,471
Step away!

280
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:37,641
No, no, no, you take your time.

281
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:40,978
The shootings, the bombings,
the intimidation,

282
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,605
that can all wait while you smell her
breath to see if she's been drinking.

283
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:46,315
Right, you three,
stay where you are.

284
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:49,819
As for you, I've warned you
once already. Step away!

285
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:52,613
Right, so...

286
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:55,658
We hate the cops.

287
00:25:57,869 --> 00:25:59,662
We hate the cops.

288
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,824
S- S R-U-C! S-S R-U-C!

289
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:23,640
S- S R-U-C! S-S R-U-C!

290
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:27,689
S- S R-U-C! S-S R-U-C!
S- S R-U-C!

291
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:11,899
# You drive your daddy's car

292
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:16,737
# But you drove us all too far

293
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:21,950
# You got so many friends

294
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:27,289
# But they'll see you in the end

295
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:35,690
# Big time, you ain't
no friend of mine

296
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:40,651
# Big time, you ain't
no friend of mine

297
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:52,772
# You've always got
some money

298
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:57,485
# But you never buy the drinks

299
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:02,907
# You always dress
so slick and neat

300
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:10,581
# And everybody thinks

301
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:15,904
# Big time, you ain't
no friend of mine

302
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:20,594
# Big time, you ain't
no friend of mine

303
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,410
# Big time, you ain't
no friend of mine

304
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:30,370
# Big time, you ain't
no friend of mine

305
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:52,664
# You're just big, big time

306
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,627
# You are just big, big time #

307
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,565
Rudi! Rudi!
Rudi! Rudi!

308
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,234
You might be needing this.

309
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,871
Boys, where have
you been all my life?

310
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,748
Do we know you?

311
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,834
Terri Hooley. I run a record shop,
and that Big Time song...

312
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,586
# Big time, you ain't no friend... #

313
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,713
I want that in my shop.

314
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,340
- You can want all you like.
- Uh-huh.

315
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:46,841
You mean you haven't recorded it?

316
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,177
Recorded it, aye.

317
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,554
Who's gonna come to
Belfast to sign us?

318
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:53,223
Just the way it is.
We don't care.

319
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:57,185
Fuck's sake!
Raise your expectations!

320
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:00,313
I'll do it, I'll put it out.

321
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:02,232
- You're pissed.
- So what?

322
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:04,567
- I'll put that record out.
- How?

323
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,195
I dunno. How hard can it be?

324
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:09,989
Whatever you think, mate.

325
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:14,410
I'll be in touch next week, fellas.
You're making a record!

326
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:18,248
You can't just go charging
into something like that!

327
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:20,082
Anyway, we're meant
to be a collective.

328
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,251
We are.
You're printing the sleeves.

329
00:30:22,377 --> 00:30:24,169
Here, will you record us, too?

330
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:25,587
I'm not that fucking pissed.

331
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:32,177
You'll never believe
what I've just seen!

332
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:37,182
These kids, they don't give a shit!

333
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,434
You have to hear them!

334
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,770
Now? What time is it?

335
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:44,064
I don't know. 4:00.

336
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,109
You have to hear them.

337
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:53,282
Everybody has to hear them.

338
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:54,741
Right.

339
00:30:57,453 --> 00:30:59,745
Have you still your shoes on?

340
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:12,216
Everybody.

341
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:16,637
# Praise the Lord, I saw the light

342
00:31:16,722 --> 00:31:20,892
# I saw the light, I saw the light

343
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:25,313
# No more darkness
No more night

344
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:29,942
# I am so happy
No sorrow in sight #

345
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:32,236
I finally understood what
converted Peel

346
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,989
from Pink Floyd and all
that prog rock shit.

347
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:39,826
John Peel. Greatest
radio DJ of all time.

348
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,995
He got what it was all about.

349
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:45,582
The revolutionary power
of the 7" single.

350
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:49,002
That's why all the big companies'll tell
you there's a secret to making 'em.

351
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:54,007
Come on, it'll be brilliant.

352
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:56,009
Aye, okay. Christ.

353
00:31:58,346 --> 00:31:59,846
Are you the owner?

354
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:02,766
He just nipped out.

355
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,517
I phoned earlier. Terri Hooley.

356
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,103
So when can you fit us in?

357
00:32:07,188 --> 00:32:08,647
I don't know, we're pretty busy.

358
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:10,857
Oh, you're joking me?

359
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,860
We've a couple of flute bands
coming in next week

360
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:16,029
and a jingle for
cheese-and-onion crisps.

361
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:20,032
Is that what you had in mind
when you started up?

362
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:22,284
Flute bands and crisp commercials?

363
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:23,702
Times we live in.

364
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:25,704
I have to put the dinner
on the table somehow.

365
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:36,173
And what about your,
er, rock-and-roll soul?

366
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:43,847
How do you feed that?

367
00:33:07,871 --> 00:33:10,581
I can give you an hour on Tuesday
after next. 10:00 okay?

368
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,417
In the morning?

369
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:15,503
Come on, we're music people.

370
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:19,716
Zoot Sims, Dreams.
This brings back memories.

371
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:24,095
Amazing, isn't it? Bit of cardboard
and some pressed plastic.

372
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:27,598
All that magic, 14p.

373
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:30,393
- 14p to buy?
- 14p to make yourself.

374
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:34,856
That's recording.

375
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,568
Wall-of-sound production values,

376
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:47,075
top-of-the-range pressing facilities

377
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:52,039
and the sleeves are taken care of.

378
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,298
- 14p?
- And we sell 'em for 50p.

379
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,300
How many were you
thinking of doing?

380
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:04,718
3,000.

381
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:06,803
Trust me.

382
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:13,143
Up your hole, EMI.

383
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:15,978
Oh, I thought you were sending it
to EMI and Polydor?

384
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:18,439
I know, but up their hole anyway.

385
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:21,817
We made it. We cracked the code.
We did it without them.

386
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,446
Out of my way!

387
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:28,324
Look at that!

388
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:30,117
We'd made the records.

389
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,829
Now all we had to do was convince
3,000 people to buy them.

390
00:34:34,623 --> 00:34:38,667
It was Northern Ireland.
Some resistance was to be expected.

391
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:42,088
There was still a circuit of sorts.

392
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:45,758
I know what you're thinking, but don't
be fooled by the collars and the sideburns.

393
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,803
These guys had balls.

394
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:51,806
This guy ended up in Thin Lizzy.

395
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:54,016
This guy

396
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,309
ended up in Wings.

397
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:58,853
These guys...

398
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,041
You're barred.

399
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:23,169
You can't bar us! We've never
even been in here before.

400
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,505
Well, for giving me lip,
you're definitely barred now.

401
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:27,799
I know people.
I could have you shot.

402
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:29,551
I know the same people you know.

403
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:31,302
I could have you sent to bed
without your supper.

404
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,019
You're laughing now,
but I swear to fuck

405
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:43,647
sooner or later I'm gonna get you.

406
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,404
Power to the people.

407
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,574
Right, back to business.

408
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,422
What, them squirrely-looking bastards
you see glue-sniffing in Cornmarket?

409
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,425
Doesn't "punk" mean
"fruit", anyway?

410
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:12,759
I don't want that kind
of carry-on here.

411
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:15,761
And they all have their own place.
They've got that shite-hole, The Pound.

412
00:36:15,846 --> 00:36:18,890
One night a week.
They need a place to call their own.

413
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:33,863
Better stage than The Pound, and all.

414
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,793
How many does this place hold
on a good night?

415
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:50,463
How the fuck would I remember?

416
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:51,797
I can. About 200.

417
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,634
Some of these kids are only wee.

418
00:36:55,801 --> 00:37:00,472
I'd say 250, once the word spreads.

419
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:05,310
Three or four nights a week.

420
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:19,658
D'you know what this place
is starting to remind me of?

421
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:21,117
What?

422
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,285
Itself.

423
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:37,925
Pass us the salt there.

424
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,134
Please.

425
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:41,845
- Please.
- This is lovely.

426
00:37:42,138 --> 00:37:43,681
Oh, the potatoes are George's own.

427
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:46,433
You should get him to take you
round the garden after dinner.

428
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:49,853
So you're a shop owner and a
record-company boss now, are you?

429
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,438
How's your work going?

430
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:53,857
Break your heart,
some of those estates.

431
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:55,651
There's kids in their teens
have already given up.

432
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,363
This is the same man that used to
march round the town with me, shouting,

433
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:02,866
"Property is theft!
Property is theft!"

434
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:05,536
Catch yourself on, Dad.
It's not like you think.

435
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:08,163
All I've promised these kids
is to get them heard.

436
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:11,333
I've sent the record out to every
record company in London.

437
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,542
And?

438
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:15,169
And I'm still waiting on them
getting back to me.

439
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:16,462
Of course you are.

440
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,799
It's the most rotten
industry there is.

441
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,155
Bribes, payola, cartels.

442
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:27,209
Get involved in that, you'll either
end up a crook or you'll go broke.

443
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:29,392
- I'll never be a crook. - It's the
parents need the talking-to, isn't it?

444
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,811
Not the kids. The kids'll only
go as far as they're let.

445
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:35,398
Actually, I'm taking a couple of groups
out on the road next month.

446
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,650
- What?
- Just a few dates.

447
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,987
It's just to let people see
what's going on here.

448
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:43,573
Are you sure it's wise driving a
van round this country at night?

449
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,491
Look at those poor fellas
that got murdered.

450
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:49,711
Oh, don't talk to him.
He's an impresario.

451
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:52,906
The Lew Grade of
Great Victoria Street.

452
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,585
How many elections is
it you've lost, anyway?

453
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:57,836
Ten?

454
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:02,382
Did it ever occur to you there might
be more than one alternative?

455
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,053
More gravy, anyone?

456
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,559
Watch your step, lads.

457
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:13,935
Are these the Rudi roadies?

458
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,022
- Ha-fucking-ha.
- Meet your new label-mates.

459
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,232
You've changed your tune.

460
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,568
Well, I'll have grown old
waiting on them changing theirs.

461
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:23,445
Anyone else coming on this tour?

462
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,780
- Tearjerkers.
- Can we come?

463
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,615
- These two.
- Let's go.

464
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,202
- Uncle Terri!
- Yeah!

465
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,786
Cheeky bastards.

466
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,956
Wait. Does anybody know
how to drive this fucking thing?

467
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,418
We're your fucking stars.
You can't ask us to drive.

468
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,878
Yeah!

469
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,971
Where the fuck are we?

470
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,015
We're on the road to Damascus.

471
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,938
Hello, Damascus, we're Rudi.

472
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:28,275
# Watching you is what I got to do

473
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:33,488
# To ensure my piece of mind

474
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:38,201
# Every day and every single night

475
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:42,330
# I have to keep a watch on you

476
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:48,586
# I spy, I spy you
# Walking down the street

477
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:53,132
# I spy, I spy him
# It's just a lie

478
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,520
# Ah, ah, ah

479
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:57,833
# Ah, ah, ah

480
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:00,294
# Ah, ah, ah

481
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:02,823
# Ah, ah, ah

482
00:42:11,484 --> 00:42:16,112
# To meet a friend
That's what you expect

483
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:20,408
# To meet a friend for
old time's sake

484
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:26,039
# I spy, I spy you
# Walking down the street

485
00:42:26,499 --> 00:42:31,336
# I spy, I spy him
# It's just a lie #

486
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:49,270
People keep handing me
these fucking things.

487
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:51,689
They wouldn't be doing that if they
knew what happened to Big Time.

488
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:53,023
Or what didn't happen.

489
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:57,236
Hasn't happened yet. I'm still
waiting on calls from London.

490
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,821
Maybe when we get back.
Wait till you see.

491
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:01,740
I don't know where half
of them came from.

492
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,826
- Everybody out of the fucking van!
- Ah, Jesus.

493
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,869
- Out, out, out!
- Everybody out!

494
00:43:06,037 --> 00:43:07,955
- I said fucking out!
- Put your hands up!

495
00:43:08,248 --> 00:43:09,832
Whoa!

496
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,292
- Put your hands up!
- Whoa.

497
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:12,793
Search 'em, lads.

498
00:43:13,003 --> 00:43:14,461
What the fuck have we here, eh?

499
00:43:14,963 --> 00:43:17,006
A fucking scarecrow convention?

500
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,592
Listen, fellas, we've just
been playing a few dates.

501
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:22,177
- We're on our way back home
to Belfast. - Oh, yeah?

502
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:24,346
And where are you
all from in Belfast?

503
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:25,514
- East.
- West.

504
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,890
- East.
- South.

505
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:28,099
- South.
- North.

506
00:43:28,225 --> 00:43:31,561
Hey, are you taking the mick, Mick?

507
00:43:34,064 --> 00:43:38,151
You're telling me some of these fuckers are
Protestant and some of them are Catholic?

508
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,361
Never occurred to me to ask.

509
00:43:43,073 --> 00:43:45,074
You ever think of setting
up a political party?

510
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:49,912
You don't wanna know what
I think of political parties.

511
00:43:50,372 --> 00:43:51,998
You don't wanna know
what we do, either.

512
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:57,337
All right, let 'em back on their bus.

513
00:43:57,921 --> 00:44:00,089
Right, boys, back on board.

514
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,054
Jesus.

515
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,347
We're getting reports on the radio.

516
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:10,557
You might wanna watch yourselves
going west into Belfast.

517
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:13,727
And north. Bit of trouble
in the east as well.

518
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:15,270
What about the south?

519
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:17,939
You should be okay
if you get going now.

520
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:19,291
Any calls while I was away?

521
00:45:19,543 --> 00:45:20,876
Nothing.

522
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:25,214
What's it take to get noticed
by these wankers?

523
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,765
Don't fucking start.

524
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:56,327
Well?

525
00:45:57,872 --> 00:46:02,500
"Dear Mr Hooley,
go fuck yourself. " Again.

526
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:08,005
I thought making the record
was supposed to be the hard part.

527
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:10,758
- Ah, that's Belfast.
- No. It's London.

528
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,718
May as well be the moon.

529
00:46:12,844 --> 00:46:16,555
Look, Terri, you've still got the shop.
Maybe it's time to let this go.

530
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:18,515
Yeah, maybe.

531
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:28,567
- Youse looking for something?
- Aye, you.

532
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,986
- Billy here sent you a tape ages ago.
- The Undertones.

533
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,697
- And we haven't heard a thing.
- I've a shop to run. I'm a busy man.

534
00:46:33,782 --> 00:46:35,032
Have you listened to it yet?

535
00:46:36,201 --> 00:46:39,495
Great. We trek all the way down here from
Derry and you haven't even listened to it?

536
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:41,705
I didn't say that.
Jesus, you Derry ones.

537
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:43,665
So did you like it?

538
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:46,542
- It wasn't bad.
- Wasn't bad?

539
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:48,544
Now, there's no way that
you listened to it, then,

540
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:50,004
because every song
on that tape's a hit.

541
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:53,382
It's too early in the morning for this shit.
Where's my fags?

542
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:54,592
Have youse any fags?

543
00:46:57,304 --> 00:46:58,930
Call yourselves punks?

544
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:00,765
- Have you any fags?
- I smoked 'em all on the bus.

545
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:04,477
Steer the ship while I'm away, Pugwash.

546
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:07,772
I still think you're bluffing.

547
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:08,981
Bluffing?

548
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:11,359
Does your ma still dress you?

549
00:47:12,444 --> 00:47:14,195
Look, the thing is...
What d'you say your name was?

550
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:15,947
Feargal. Feargal Sharkey.

551
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:18,991
Feargal, the thing is, Good Vibrations
isn't really a proper label.

552
00:47:19,117 --> 00:47:21,202
If we don't get a record out soon,
it'll be too late.

553
00:47:21,453 --> 00:47:23,204
We're breaking up.

554
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:26,373
Oh, now don't lay that on me.

555
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:29,209
Look, all I wanted was to
open a record shop.

556
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:30,377
Yeah, but you put out Rudi.

557
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:32,462
- I know, but that was...
- And The Outcasts.

558
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:40,512
# I'm a little intellectual
Someone who knows it all

559
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:44,015
# I could be your summer special
You could be my New York doll

560
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,352
# My doll

561
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:49,437
# My doll #

562
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:54,734
Stop, stop, stop...

563
00:47:55,027 --> 00:47:58,113
All I'm getting in here
is echo, echo, echo.

564
00:48:00,908 --> 00:48:02,075
Hard going?

565
00:48:02,368 --> 00:48:05,327
Never been in a proper studio
till two hours ago,

566
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:07,496
and now they're all Phil Spector.

567
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:10,332
So what do you think?

568
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:13,002
Are we just gonna cut
our losses here?

569
00:48:13,587 --> 00:48:15,170
Cut our losses?

570
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,715
You didn't hear the
track before this one.

571
00:48:28,143 --> 00:48:30,769
It's the best thing I ever recorded.

572
00:48:31,354 --> 00:48:32,980
The best thing anyone in
this city ever recorded.

573
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:08,473
Stop staring at us like that.

574
00:49:09,892 --> 00:49:11,976
You mad, one-eyed bastard.

575
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:16,564
Thank you all for answering the call.

576
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,942
Right, now, are you watching?

577
00:49:19,818 --> 00:49:22,736
You line the record up
with the top edge like this.

578
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:27,115
Then fold along the
bottom line like this.

579
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,994
Then fold down here
and fold down here.

580
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,162
And there you have it.

581
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:34,164
Magic.

582
00:49:34,457 --> 00:49:39,878
Again, here. Here.
Here. And here.

583
00:49:40,254 --> 00:49:41,380
Right?

584
00:49:41,464 --> 00:49:42,631
Now, let's get started.

585
00:50:20,168 --> 00:50:21,711
I think you've enough in there.

586
00:50:21,795 --> 00:50:23,462
Just in case.

587
00:50:24,715 --> 00:50:27,550
Calm. You'll be grand.

588
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,969
I'm glad you think so.

589
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:32,638
They'll never have
met anyone like you.

590
00:50:32,723 --> 00:50:34,640
I know I hadn't.

591
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:36,350
Still haven't.

592
00:50:37,477 --> 00:50:40,938
- I just don't wanna give them
any excuse. - You won't.

593
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:46,067
Gotta get in to work.

594
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:51,698
Ruth was right.
It was only London.

595
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,997
And what's London
ever given us?

596
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,125
Apart from Ray Davies.

597
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:04,085
And Joe Meek.
And John Lydon.

598
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:06,838
And The Clash. And, er,
fuck, Abbey Road.

599
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:27,941
Holy fuck.

600
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:30,819
I know.

601
00:51:30,904 --> 00:51:34,364
Amazing how far a bit of charm and
labyrinthine narcotics connections

602
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:36,366
will get a young man.

603
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,914
Have you had a lot of dealings
with the music people?

604
00:51:42,082 --> 00:51:43,248
Fuck's sake, Terri.

605
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:46,376
That's like asking a vet if he's
had his hand up a cow's arse.

606
00:51:56,262 --> 00:51:59,181
Hey, something to help
you on your way?

607
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:06,813
Better not. Can't afford
to fuck this up.

608
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:12,068
You'll fuck it up if
you're too tense.

609
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,529
You need to go in there
like you mean it.

610
00:52:15,197 --> 00:52:16,322
Good point.

611
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:33,965
- Where are the guns?
- Sorry?

612
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:36,634
- The guns, the bombs, the tanks.
- Tanks?

613
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:39,970
And the rage? I get told,
"Here's a punk band from Belfast. "

614
00:52:40,054 --> 00:52:41,721
- Derry!
- I think, "Great.

615
00:52:41,806 --> 00:52:44,432
"No more pissing around.
This is gonna be darkness.

616
00:52:44,517 --> 00:52:46,351
"Proper darkness. "

617
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:50,564
And then I get this.

618
00:52:50,773 --> 00:52:51,898
Nihilism.

619
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,278
If anything, sounds like they're
having too good a time.

620
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,240
- They're no oil paintings, are they?
- No.

621
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,910
Do they have any good-looking friends?

622
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:07,414
And we love it when bands
sing in regional accents.

623
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,876
But could they not pick
another region?

624
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:15,005
- It's shit.
- Shit?

625
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:17,382
- Yes, shit.
- It's not shit.

626
00:53:17,466 --> 00:53:18,633
- Yes, it is.
- Isn't.

627
00:53:18,718 --> 00:53:20,009
- Is!
- It's not!

628
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:22,678
- Is.
- No.

629
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:28,475
This... This, this is shit!

630
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,603
Cathy, get security up here now!

631
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:34,106
This, this here...
This one, this is shit!

632
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:39,445
And this! This one,
this really is fucking shit!

633
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:42,406
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

634
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:47,453
Fascist pigs!
Nazi fucking bastards!

635
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:56,420
Here.

636
00:53:57,756 --> 00:53:59,255
- Take it.
- No, thank you.

637
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,882
Take it!

638
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:04,677
What is wrong with you people?

639
00:54:04,762 --> 00:54:10,099
Is there not one person in this city who
recognises genius when it's handed to them?

640
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:23,404
It's just that all packages
have to be signed in.

641
00:54:23,948 --> 00:54:25,281
Security.

642
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,076
It's a piece of vinyl.

643
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,619
New regulations.

644
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:31,079
Well, can you not just sign for it?

645
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:32,538
I'm afraid not.

646
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:36,167
I've come all the way over from Belfast,
and to tell you the truth,

647
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:39,127
I've fucked up a bit today.

648
00:54:39,629 --> 00:54:40,754
Sorry.

649
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:43,006
Please.

650
00:54:43,132 --> 00:54:44,216
No.

651
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:01,525
Terri? Terri Hooley?

652
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,653
I don't believe it.

653
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:07,572
Me neither.

654
00:55:07,657 --> 00:55:09,032
Is this man a friend of yours?

655
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:13,120
I was doing a story in Belfast at New Year
and, er, wandered into his record shop.

656
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:16,456
He had a 13th Floor Elevators album.

657
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:17,999
Easter Everywhere.

658
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:21,085
International Artists deleted it
after the year it was released.

659
00:55:21,295 --> 00:55:23,921
I'd searched all over London for it.

660
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:27,049
What are you doing here?

661
00:55:27,634 --> 00:55:31,095
So, yes, that's one from the
Temple City Kazoo Orchestra,

662
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:35,099
which I'm dedicating to anyone
with a dog or who is feeling down.

663
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:37,810
This is BBC Radio 1,
the John Peel Radio Show...

664
00:55:37,894 --> 00:55:39,270
I can't listen to this.

665
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:41,355
It's only been four nights.

666
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,690
It's my fault.

667
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:45,818
I should have run up those stairs
and handed it over myself.

668
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:48,321
Would have been worth
being arrested.

669
00:55:49,698 --> 00:55:52,116
Did it ever occur to you
I might be listening to that?

670
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,037
...get all of this stuff out of the
morning papers, incidentally.

671
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:04,044
Terri.

672
00:56:08,049 --> 00:56:09,549
Terri!

673
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:18,058
You missed it.

674
00:56:18,434 --> 00:56:20,143
Isn't that the best thing
you've ever heard?

675
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:23,521
It's so good I'm gonna do
something I've never done before.

676
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:42,122
# Are teenage dreams so hard to beat?

677
00:56:43,124 --> 00:56:46,502
# Every time she walks
down the street

678
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:50,089
# Another girl in the
neighbourhood

679
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:53,425
# Wish she was mine,
she looks so good

680
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,387
# I wanna hold her,
wanna hold her tight

681
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,514
# Get teenage kicks right
through the night #

682
00:57:02,435 --> 00:57:04,269
Hello? Dave!

683
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,898
I know, isn't it fantastic?
Twice in a row.

684
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:13,695
John fucking Peel!

685
00:57:14,948 --> 00:57:17,657
# I wanna hold you,
wanna hold you tight

686
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:21,369
# Get teenage kicks
right through the night

687
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:40,138
# Are teenage dreams
so hard to beat?

688
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:43,599
# Every time she walks
down the street

689
00:57:43,684 --> 00:57:47,186
# Another girl in the
neighbourhood

690
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:50,314
# Wish she was mine,
she looks so good

691
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:53,443
# I wanna hold her,
wanna hold her tight

692
00:57:53,527 --> 00:57:56,653
# Get teenage kicks right
through the night #

693
00:57:56,779 --> 00:58:01,283
Terri, there's a fella on the phone
says he's from Sire Records in London.

694
00:58:02,827 --> 00:58:05,620
Terri? The fella's hanging on here.

695
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:10,041
Tell him, if he wants to talk to me,

696
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:12,878
he can come over here and do it.

697
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:21,845
Seymour Stein was
knocked out by Kicks.

698
00:58:22,472 --> 00:58:23,889
Kicks?

699
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,142
He turned to me straight away and said,
"I want that band. "

700
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:30,854
That's how he was with the Ramones...
"I want that band. "

701
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:33,899
Well, I tell you, Paul, you don't have
to sell Seymour Stein to me.

702
00:58:34,025 --> 00:58:37,902
This is the man The Shangri-Las phoned
when they wanted to go back into the studio.

703
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:40,070
You know that all came to nothing.

704
00:58:40,197 --> 00:58:44,658
But still, they called him.
The Shangri-Las!

705
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:57,087
Seymour!
I've got the band here.

706
00:58:57,214 --> 00:58:59,423
- I'm passing you over to...
- Mickey.

707
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:00,674
Mickey.

708
00:59:02,427 --> 00:59:05,596
How are you, Mr Stein?

709
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,557
Aye, Paul told us about the offer.

710
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:12,603
Well, tell you the truth,
we'd be looking at a bit more.

711
00:59:12,687 --> 00:59:14,771
- What? How much more?
- A lot more.

712
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:17,941
Same as the Rich Kids got from EMI.

713
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:20,610
Rich Kids, EMI? You know
what I'm offering you...

714
00:59:29,286 --> 00:59:31,246
Hey, we've come all the way
over here to make a deal...

715
00:59:31,372 --> 00:59:33,790
- What are you talking about?
- ... and we want to make a deal.

716
00:59:36,794 --> 00:59:38,461
Should you not be in
there advising us?

717
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:44,217
You boys should be advising me.

718
00:59:45,928 --> 00:59:48,263
I thought for a moment back there
the whole thing was off.

719
00:59:49,473 --> 00:59:51,558
Never seen him quite so angry.

720
00:59:51,642 --> 00:59:53,642
Well, you got your band,
didn't you?

721
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:57,145
- What about you, Terri?
- What about me?

722
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,940
Well, you recorded Kicks.
It's on your label.

723
01:00:00,149 --> 01:00:03,151
You've got the wrong
idea about me, Paul.

724
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:06,405
People who wouldn't piss on me when
I was hauling the record around London

725
01:00:06,489 --> 01:00:09,116
have been calling me up,
offering me 20,000 for it.

726
01:00:09,158 --> 01:00:11,326
Told them all to fuck off.

727
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:13,287
Twenty thousand?

728
01:00:13,997 --> 01:00:16,164
Well, we can talk about this later.

729
01:00:16,291 --> 01:00:17,833
We can talk about it now.

730
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:21,795
Getty's as much a part of
Good Vibrations as I am. They all are.

731
01:00:23,172 --> 01:00:25,424
How much is that van you
were looking at, Getty?

732
01:00:26,092 --> 01:00:29,511
550, but I reckon I can
get him down to 500.

733
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:33,681
All right then, Paul.
500 quid.

734
01:00:36,977 --> 01:00:39,270
Are you sure you don't
wanna talk about it later?

735
01:00:41,523 --> 01:00:45,860
Five hundred quid and a signed
photo of The Shangri-Las.

736
01:00:52,451 --> 01:00:53,618
Okay.

737
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:58,151
It's like my dad used to say,

738
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,799
"If they can't buy you,
they can't own you. "

739
01:01:00,834 --> 01:01:04,128
And it's not like that song was mine.
Teenage Kicks didn't belong to me.

740
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:05,630
It belonged to everybody.

741
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:10,051
And anyway, Rudi and The Outcasts
were gonna be even bigger.

742
01:01:11,011 --> 01:01:12,177
Well, weren't they?

743
01:01:14,722 --> 01:01:18,308
First time in, Undertones
and Teenage Kicks.

744
01:01:27,193 --> 01:01:29,319
Does that make you think
a wee bit of the Beach Boys?

745
01:01:30,237 --> 01:01:33,323
Makes me think of that large
hole in Terri's bank account.

746
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:36,409
You're starting to sound
like an accountant.

747
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:39,204
You're turning me into one.

748
01:01:40,915 --> 01:01:43,667
Look at the state
of those trousers.

749
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:47,087
How come they're on
TV and we're not?

750
01:01:47,213 --> 01:01:50,423
You write some new songs
and I'll get you on TV.

751
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:03,560
Better be getting on here, anyway.

752
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:04,853
Me, too.

753
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:06,355
Aye, hold on.

754
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:09,608
Terri Hooley?

755
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,276
Yeah.

756
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:13,070
The Godfather of Belfast Punk?

757
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,615
We would like to make
an interview with you.

758
01:02:18,743 --> 01:02:22,121
So it all started for
you in 1977-'76?

759
01:02:22,247 --> 01:02:24,873
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
way before that.

760
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:29,878
Here. Wait till I tell you.
It's in the '60s.

761
01:02:34,133 --> 01:02:36,092
Auf Wiedersehen, guys.

762
01:02:43,308 --> 01:02:44,809
Brought you your lunch.

763
01:02:45,269 --> 01:02:46,436
Thanks.

764
01:02:51,817 --> 01:02:53,484
About last night.

765
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:56,487
You know me,
once I get started.

766
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,322
Why d'you think I never
let you get started?

767
01:03:08,834 --> 01:03:10,333
I'm pregnant.

768
01:03:20,136 --> 01:03:21,303
Well?

769
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:24,473
I'm gonna be a daddy.

770
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:30,937
It's unbelievable.

771
01:03:35,651 --> 01:03:37,027
That's brilliant.

772
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:40,113
D'you remember the day
we moved into the house?

773
01:03:40,865 --> 01:03:43,283
- You told me I was everything.
- And you didn't want to be.

774
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:44,618
That's not what I said.

775
01:03:45,453 --> 01:03:46,620
I said...

776
01:03:46,704 --> 01:03:49,164
You'd settle for being the
most important thing.

777
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:56,212
From now on, we'll both have to settle
for being the second most important.

778
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:37,085
The first time you're told
you're gonna be a father,

779
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:40,839
in the middle of all that joy and
excitement and anticipation,

780
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,676
who doesn't shite themselves, too?

781
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:50,223
But it was all gonna be absolutely fine.

782
01:04:50,266 --> 01:04:52,725
All I had to do was
work twice as hard,

783
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:55,603
and make sure nothing
fell through the cracks.

784
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:00,900
# Every time I see you
It makes me realise

785
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:07,782
# The pressure's on

786
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,616
# Every single day

787
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:20,377
# The pressure's on

788
01:05:20,461 --> 01:05:22,045
# Every single day

789
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:32,973
This is, er, Terri Hooley.

790
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:35,767
Yes, that Terri Hooley.

791
01:05:37,812 --> 01:05:39,646
Well, that's very nice
of you to say so.

792
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:45,611
I've been watching your show.
Some decent bands on.

793
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:48,487
Come on. How about putting
on a really great one?

794
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:54,911
Brian, got some great news.

795
01:05:55,579 --> 01:05:59,457
# The pressure's on

796
01:05:59,499 --> 01:06:01,167
# Every single day

797
01:06:03,003 --> 01:06:05,004
- Youse over from London?
- Yeah.

798
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,757
Brilliant. Youse want a drink?

799
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:10,343
Hey, couple of pints
of horse piss, please.

800
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:27,609
# The pressure's on

801
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,486
# Every single day

802
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:38,870
# The pressure's on

803
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,331
# Every single day

804
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:48,345
# The pressure's on for me and you

805
01:06:48,511 --> 01:06:51,217
# The pressure's on me and you

806
01:06:51,372 --> 01:06:53,980
# The pressure's on me and you

807
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:57,639
# The pressure's on me and you #

808
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,196
How did you manage that?

809
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:18,575
What are you crying about?
Didn't I say I'd get you on TV?

810
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,537
Aye, to promote the record.

811
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,747
Where's the fucking record?

812
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,585
Did you phone the pressing plant?
Did they get the master?

813
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:33,257
Those useless bastards.

814
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,093
You knew months ago
we were gonna be on.

815
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,761
All you had to do was put
the record out on time.

816
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,263
All?

817
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,725
I've the shop.

818
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,393
The Harp.

819
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,769
You lot.
The Outcasts.

820
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,688
Bank manager breathing
down my neck.

821
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:51,774
Oh, oh, and a wife who's about
to have a baby any day now.

822
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,943
It was our big chance,
and you fucked it up.

823
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,789
Come on to fuck out of this.

824
01:08:17,634 --> 01:08:18,801
You going after them?

825
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,636
Am I fuck!
I'm going to the Siouxsie gig.

826
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,971
That's not for another six hours.

827
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:23,806
Didn't say I was going straight
to the Siouxsie gig.

828
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,766
Would you not be better
going home first?

829
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:30,479
"My wife about to
have a baby any day. "

830
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:33,648
The prison officer's murder
has been claimed

831
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:38,653
by the IRA in retaliation for what it calls
the inhuman treatment of their colleagues

832
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:40,197
in the Maze Prison.

833
01:08:40,323 --> 01:08:44,201
Loyalist paramilitaries, meantime,
have threatened to step up their attacks

834
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:45,952
on the Catholic population.

835
01:08:46,621 --> 01:08:48,830
Now, two years ago,
troubles sparked

836
01:08:48,956 --> 01:08:53,293
between police and fans when
London punk rock band, The Clash,

837
01:08:53,377 --> 01:08:55,003
came to the Ulster Hall.

838
01:08:55,171 --> 01:08:58,507
Tonight, the venue plays host
to another London band...

839
01:09:01,177 --> 01:09:04,137
How are you, Ruth?
Terri?

840
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,055
No, you just missed him, love.
He was here all afternoon.

841
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:09,683
...hostilities between punk-music
fans and the authorities,

842
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,894
or have things moved
on in the interim?

843
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,688
Our reporter, David Kappa,
is outside the hall

844
01:09:14,815 --> 01:09:18,150
with Belfast's own punk godfather,
Terri Hooley.

845
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:22,363
I have to laugh at the great and
good when they talk about punks

846
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:24,031
being a menace to society.

847
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:26,242
We should be thanking 'em,
not hassling them.

848
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:29,829
These kids aren't the
problem for Belfast.

849
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:32,164
These kids are the solution.

850
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:00,358
Please pick up.

851
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:08,908
Getty?
Are you not at the gig?

852
01:10:10,744 --> 01:10:12,704
You have to come and get me.

853
01:10:13,914 --> 01:10:16,457
Getty? This baby's coming.

854
01:10:33,474 --> 01:10:35,934
Just a couple more minutes, Ruth.
Look, I can see the gates.

855
01:11:15,349 --> 01:11:16,807
How long have you been here?

856
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:19,810
Ten minutes.

857
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:23,314
You should have woken me.

858
01:11:23,482 --> 01:11:26,317
Sleep when the baby sleeps,
that's what my mum says.

859
01:11:42,459 --> 01:11:43,667
What do you think?

860
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,127
She looks like her mummy.

861
01:11:48,047 --> 01:11:50,840
- She's gorgeous.
- This is your daddy.

862
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:53,343
He's an old charmer.

863
01:11:54,011 --> 01:11:55,220
Do you wanna hold her?

864
01:11:56,681 --> 01:11:59,182
My hands are shaking too much.
Probably drop her.

865
01:12:01,185 --> 01:12:02,686
It's just nerves.

866
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:11,987
I couldn't get the champagne, Terri,
but if you shake this, it'll pop to fuck.

867
01:12:12,029 --> 01:12:14,239
Right, that's it.
Out, out, all of you.

868
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:17,367
Right now. Out. Thank you.
Out, please.

869
01:12:17,743 --> 01:12:19,703
- Move! - I can't believe you
brought them with you.

870
01:12:20,705 --> 01:12:22,538
Sure, they're practically family.

871
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:24,873
But they're not, Terri.

872
01:12:26,584 --> 01:12:28,377
We're your family.

873
01:12:36,678 --> 01:12:39,263
I can't do this any more.
I need to get out of Belfast for a while.

874
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:40,764
Out of Belfast?

875
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:44,059
A friend of Marilyn's has
a house in Helen's Bay.

876
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,399
Are you telling me
you're leaving me?

877
01:12:50,442 --> 01:12:52,693
I'm telling you everything's
different now.

878
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,529
I love being with you.

879
01:12:57,907 --> 01:13:00,409
But I'm not afraid to do this
on my own if I have to.

880
01:13:01,036 --> 01:13:02,118
You won't have to.

881
01:13:03,454 --> 01:13:06,372
Terri! Terri! Terri!

882
01:13:06,874 --> 01:13:10,460
I need you to get those lads
off my ward this minute!

883
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:16,090
I have to go.

884
01:13:18,635 --> 01:13:19,927
You do.

885
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:43,492
...Belfast this afternoon...

886
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:44,910
...since 1969.

887
01:13:44,952 --> 01:13:46,828
...five deaths are confirmed...

888
01:13:46,954 --> 01:13:49,956
...were blown to pieces.
Others lost limbs...

889
01:13:56,339 --> 01:14:00,133
...will continue their attacks
against so-called economic...

890
01:14:00,176 --> 01:14:02,636
...more than five thousand
bomb explosions...

891
01:14:02,678 --> 01:14:04,262
...the security forces...

892
01:15:00,192 --> 01:15:02,026
- Hello?
- Ruth?

893
01:15:09,201 --> 01:15:10,410
Hello?

894
01:15:11,036 --> 01:15:12,203
Ruth.

895
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:38,104
You're drinking too much.

896
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,856
Dave, I always drink too much.

897
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:42,691
Everybody we know
drinks too much.

898
01:15:42,734 --> 01:15:44,401
Well, this is different.
There's something...

899
01:15:44,527 --> 01:15:46,069
Something what?

900
01:15:48,948 --> 01:15:51,241
You're carrying on like
one of Led Zeppelin.

901
01:15:54,412 --> 01:15:55,787
That's low.

902
01:16:00,084 --> 01:16:02,711
Anything else you'd like to say
while you're about it?

903
01:16:04,547 --> 01:16:07,382
I just think we have to try
to hold things together.

904
01:16:08,468 --> 01:16:09,760
Oh, do we?

905
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:13,430
And will you tell us when
we can take a piss, Dave?

906
01:16:13,473 --> 01:16:15,807
Or scratch our fucking arse?

907
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:19,435
Stalinist.

908
01:16:21,772 --> 01:16:22,939
Stalinist?

909
01:16:25,108 --> 01:16:26,609
Your dad's right.

910
01:16:29,154 --> 01:16:31,405
What are you talking about, my dad?

911
01:16:32,491 --> 01:16:34,617
You take on too much
because you love the glory.

912
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:38,454
You're not a socialist at all.
You're a one-man fucking show.

913
01:16:39,748 --> 01:16:41,791
T - E - R - R capital I.

914
01:16:51,593 --> 01:16:53,344
Forgot your brandy.

915
01:16:55,764 --> 01:16:58,139
Your situation is really quite grave.

916
01:16:58,182 --> 01:16:59,683
It's not just the overdraft.

917
01:16:59,809 --> 01:17:01,768
It's the accrued interest
on the original loan.

918
01:17:02,353 --> 01:17:03,812
It's your tax returns.

919
01:17:03,854 --> 01:17:05,647
I can't stress it enough.

920
01:17:05,773 --> 01:17:09,150
You are in real danger
of defaulting.

921
01:17:09,652 --> 01:17:12,487
You risk losing the shop
and your collateral.

922
01:17:14,282 --> 01:17:15,657
Ruth.

923
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,035
Our house.

924
01:17:20,538 --> 01:17:22,539
For God's sake, Terri,
why didn't you tell me?

925
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,333
All those mornings...

926
01:17:26,002 --> 01:17:28,878
Kids running away...
The fucking rain.

927
01:17:29,005 --> 01:17:31,381
I was telling myself,
"This is all right.

928
01:17:31,507 --> 01:17:34,009
"This was what allowed
us to open the shop. "

929
01:17:34,802 --> 01:17:36,177
And all the time...

930
01:17:37,512 --> 01:17:39,680
- It was our house.
- It was one moment.

931
01:17:41,683 --> 01:17:43,392
I wasn't thinking.

932
01:17:44,185 --> 01:17:45,853
I never thought.

933
01:17:46,521 --> 01:17:47,980
I just did it.

934
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:52,359
It's the same as with Big Time,
I just did it.

935
01:17:53,028 --> 01:17:55,195
Same as with the tour,
I just did it.

936
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:58,824
Teenage Kicks, the Harp,
I just did it.

937
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,702
It's how I operate.
It's who I am.

938
01:18:02,537 --> 01:18:04,371
And you know what?

939
01:18:05,165 --> 01:18:06,915
I haven't done too badly.

940
01:18:08,209 --> 01:18:10,085
Open your eye, Terri.

941
01:18:38,822 --> 01:18:40,323
We saw your light on.

942
01:18:42,826 --> 01:18:44,911
Thought I told you
you were barred.

943
01:18:48,749 --> 01:18:50,792
Fuck away off and find some
old ladies to frighten.

944
01:18:51,835 --> 01:18:54,671
You're very funny.
Isn't he, Hatchett?

945
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:56,505
- Isn't he very funny?
- Oh, aye.

946
01:18:56,756 --> 01:18:58,256
Actually, this is a business call.

947
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:00,175
Me and Hatchett's in a band now.

948
01:19:00,259 --> 01:19:01,426
- Aren't we, Hatchett?
- We are.

949
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:02,928
Tight wee unit.

950
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:06,431
Fuck's sake!
Behave.

951
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:10,602
Thought you might be in
interested in our demo tape.

952
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:13,438
We were gonna call it The Only
Good Wog's A Dead Wog,

953
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:15,816
and then we thought,
The Only Good Taig...

954
01:19:15,942 --> 01:19:18,944
And then we thought,
The Only Good One's A Dead One.

955
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:21,279
Covered pretty much everything.

956
01:19:22,949 --> 01:19:25,951
I'd sooner sell bog rolls
than Nazi shite like that.

957
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:28,537
You'll sell what I tell you to sell.

958
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:30,288
I'm used to getting me own way.

959
01:19:33,459 --> 01:19:36,127
Ask the fellas you used to say
would put me to bed.

960
01:19:38,714 --> 01:19:41,465
You made such a big deal
about not letting me in here.

961
01:19:42,342 --> 01:19:45,720
And look at it. It's fuck-all.
You're fuck-all.

962
01:19:46,054 --> 01:19:47,888
You're fucking lost.

963
01:20:34,518 --> 01:20:35,852
Open your eye.

964
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:39,522
Very funny. The other one.

965
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:46,362
That must have been some door.

966
01:20:48,032 --> 01:20:50,033
What was it, a car ferry?

967
01:20:51,285 --> 01:20:53,411
Don't suppose there's any point
in me mentioning the police?

968
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:56,246
They'd probably wanna
buy the door a drink.

969
01:20:56,372 --> 01:21:00,042
I never knew a wee boy as bad at
keeping his head out of harm's way.

970
01:21:00,543 --> 01:21:02,586
And what does Ruth
think about all this?

971
01:21:04,255 --> 01:21:05,422
Here.

972
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:08,550
Did your mother send
you out with that?

973
01:21:09,093 --> 01:21:11,470
Thought I'd better offer
before she put the window in.

974
01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:15,057
She's getting herself worked up
about me and Ruth.

975
01:21:15,099 --> 01:21:17,476
She has very strong
views on marriage.

976
01:21:18,269 --> 01:21:21,063
She wouldn't have stayed with me
all these years otherwise.

977
01:21:38,997 --> 01:21:41,958
You remember that dig you had at me
about all those elections?

978
01:21:43,585 --> 01:21:45,253
- Dad, look, I'm...
- It wasn't ten.

979
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:47,755
It was 12.

980
01:21:48,173 --> 01:21:49,340
The Returning Officer used to say

981
01:21:49,424 --> 01:21:51,843
if I was a horse, they would
have shot me after the sixth.

982
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:54,428
But do you know what?

983
01:21:54,972 --> 01:21:58,349
I have friends and comrades
living all over this city.

984
01:21:59,101 --> 01:22:00,601
And do you know what else?

985
01:22:01,478 --> 01:22:04,146
In every election I increased my vote.

986
01:22:07,484 --> 01:22:11,320
Victory doesn't always look
the way other people imagine it.

987
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:46,646
Right.

988
01:22:47,982 --> 01:22:49,983
Couple of apologies are in order.

989
01:22:52,652 --> 01:22:54,486
- Brian, do you wanna start?
- Who...

990
01:22:54,654 --> 01:22:55,905
I'm only messing you.

991
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:58,657
Dave?

992
01:22:59,326 --> 01:23:00,743
I hold my hand up.

993
01:23:01,077 --> 01:23:03,495
I've taken me eye off the ball,
but there's no time to argue.

994
01:23:04,164 --> 01:23:05,664
It's time to focus.

995
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:08,500
We got a gig to organise.

996
01:23:09,836 --> 01:23:12,087
- A gig?
- A Good Vibrations gig.

997
01:23:12,672 --> 01:23:14,340
- A fundraiser?
- Yeah, a fundraiser.

998
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:17,384
No harm to you, Terri,
but unless you're charging

999
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:18,552
a hundred quid a head,

1000
01:23:18,678 --> 01:23:20,846
I don't think a night at the Harp's
gonna save you.

1001
01:23:20,931 --> 01:23:22,348
Who said anything about the Harp?

1002
01:23:22,432 --> 01:23:23,766
At The Pound, then.

1003
01:23:24,601 --> 01:23:25,768
Ooh, the Students' Union.

1004
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:29,688
Try Ulster Hall.

1005
01:23:32,191 --> 01:23:33,399
Why not?

1006
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:36,527
Well, because the Ulster Hall
holds 2,000 people.

1007
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:40,198
I know how many people it holds.
I've been in it often enough.

1008
01:23:44,787 --> 01:23:46,204
Okay, we'll call in favours.

1009
01:23:46,246 --> 01:23:48,206
We'll get Siouxsie back to headline.

1010
01:23:48,707 --> 01:23:51,417
Oh, fuck it, er, we'll call The Clash,
Stiff Little Fingers...

1011
01:23:51,543 --> 01:23:53,962
Fucking show bands.
We don't need them.

1012
01:23:54,588 --> 01:23:58,466
It's a Good Vibrations gig.
It's gonna be Good Vibrations bands.

1013
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:02,303
Terri, we're talking 2,000 people.
Be realistic.

1014
01:24:02,721 --> 01:24:03,763
What?

1015
01:24:03,889 --> 01:24:07,225
Like you were realistic when you
brought us round this place?

1016
01:24:18,611 --> 01:24:20,612
How many posters do
you think you'll need?

1017
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:30,747
We're fucking back!

1018
01:25:27,345 --> 01:25:30,014
Northern Ireland, for reasons
best known to itself,

1019
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:33,016
is the last great stronghold
of the punk world.

1020
01:25:33,309 --> 01:25:36,478
The Ulster Hall bill tonight represents
the largest-ever gathering here

1021
01:25:36,562 --> 01:25:39,689
of homebred punk and
New Wave bands on one stage.

1022
01:25:46,697 --> 01:25:48,490
Where the fuck is everyone?

1023
01:25:48,824 --> 01:25:51,659
It'll be all right. They'll come.

1024
01:25:53,913 --> 01:25:56,164
You know we've
hardly sold a ticket?

1025
01:26:03,506 --> 01:26:07,342
- It's John fucking Peel.
- Always nice to get the full name.

1026
01:26:09,345 --> 01:26:11,512
I can't believe you're here.

1027
01:26:11,554 --> 01:26:14,515
You gave me the best two minutes
and 28 seconds of my life.

1028
01:26:14,557 --> 01:26:15,933
How could I not come?

1029
01:26:16,351 --> 01:26:17,684
I'm just glad I got here in one piece.

1030
01:26:18,353 --> 01:26:20,854
- Rough journey?
- Oh, no, the flight was fine.

1031
01:26:21,022 --> 01:26:22,439
I mean getting through the
doors of this place.

1032
01:26:27,237 --> 01:26:29,530
You mean you haven't had a look
out the front?

1033
01:26:36,454 --> 01:26:38,413
Can you not just throw
the doors open?

1034
01:26:38,706 --> 01:26:40,707
I'd be within my rights
to shut them altogether.

1035
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,917
Half of them are full drunk

1036
01:26:42,043 --> 01:26:43,919
and the other half are trying
to run in without paying.

1037
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:45,629
Terri!

1038
01:26:46,464 --> 01:26:47,631
Hey, he's on the guest list.

1039
01:26:48,424 --> 01:26:49,632
Come on, move your arse!

1040
01:26:49,716 --> 01:26:51,050
What about my mates?

1041
01:26:51,301 --> 01:26:52,718
Hurry up, hurry up.

1042
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:25,334
- It's too many.
- Ah, don't worry, it'll be fine.

1043
01:27:27,087 --> 01:27:28,254
Jesus Christ.

1044
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:50,775
Rudi! Rudi! Rudi!

1045
01:28:02,997 --> 01:28:04,497
You're a good audience.

1046
01:28:04,624 --> 01:28:07,542
People always say
Belfast is the best audience.

1047
01:28:07,627 --> 01:28:09,501
And now here's your best band.

1048
01:28:09,628 --> 01:28:10,836
The Outcasts.

1049
01:28:22,557 --> 01:28:24,683
# I was born in 1959

1050
01:28:25,227 --> 01:28:27,394
# I see no point being alive

1051
01:28:28,188 --> 01:28:30,314
# I see no point in keeping clean

1052
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:32,983
# I see no point in anything

1053
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,363
# Mummy always
seemed to be there

1054
01:28:38,031 --> 01:28:40,324
# To wash and scrub
little Jackie's hair

1055
01:28:40,867 --> 01:28:42,826
# To pick the dandruff
from his scalp

1056
01:28:43,495 --> 01:28:45,579
# And give him pills
when he's ill

1057
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:52,001
# Mummy doesn't seem to realise

1058
01:28:54,505 --> 01:28:57,715
# Little Jackie is now a problem child

1059
01:28:59,802 --> 01:29:02,387
# She asks the doctor,
"What's wrong with him?"

1060
01:29:02,596 --> 01:29:04,931
# The doctor says

1061
01:29:05,474 --> 01:29:07,350
# Another teenage rebel

1062
01:29:08,185 --> 01:29:09,519
# Another spotty problem kid

1063
01:29:10,729 --> 01:29:12,605
# Another teenage rebel

1064
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,441
- Cool, Terri, great night.
- All right, Terri? Thanks, mate.

1065
01:29:20,364 --> 01:29:22,240
# Another teenage rebel #

1066
01:29:23,826 --> 01:29:26,119
Isn't it incredible?

1067
01:29:26,662 --> 01:29:28,578
It's fucking unbelievable.

1068
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:32,124
- Best night ever.
- Terri, we've made a loss.

1069
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,919
We have packed out
the Ulster Hall

1070
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:38,213
and we've somehow
made a fucking loss.

1071
01:29:40,091 --> 01:29:41,550
Your man at the front says

1072
01:29:41,634 --> 01:29:44,303
you had the longest guest list
in the Hall's entire history.

1073
01:29:44,387 --> 01:29:46,805
Longer than all the other
guest lists put together,

1074
01:29:46,889 --> 01:29:49,558
and all of it, apparently,
carried in your head.

1075
01:29:51,269 --> 01:29:52,519
Terri.

1076
01:29:53,604 --> 01:29:56,982
The whole point of tonight
was to raise money for your shop.

1077
01:29:57,984 --> 01:29:59,359
No, Dave.

1078
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:02,195
No, it wasn't,
not the whole point.

1079
01:30:03,072 --> 01:30:06,866
Money couldn't buy
what we've just done.

1080
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:24,091
You and your guest lists.

1081
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:39,440
I'm sorry.

1082
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:43,861
Sure, it's only bricks.

1083
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:48,823
Terri! Terri! Terri!

1084
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:55,830
You're wanted.

1085
01:31:00,378 --> 01:31:02,212
But you still owe me 40 quid.

1086
01:31:15,518 --> 01:31:18,436
I've made some bad
decisions in my life.

1087
01:31:18,521 --> 01:31:21,231
I haven't been on the
winning side very often.

1088
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:24,692
But there were no winning
sides back then. So...

1089
01:31:25,151 --> 01:31:29,696
Like my dad said, the trick was
to get yourself on the right side.

1090
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:30,989
The side of the angels.

1091
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:34,618
Hey, Terri is our leader.
Terri is our...

1092
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:38,831
No leaders.
No godfathers.

1093
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:43,544
Thank you for coming.

1094
01:31:48,049 --> 01:31:50,884
When I look out at youse
all gathered here,

1095
01:31:52,011 --> 01:31:54,763
it confirms something
I've always felt.

1096
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:57,766
When it comes to punk,

1097
01:31:58,476 --> 01:32:02,062
New York has the haircuts,

1098
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:06,732
London has the trousers,

1099
01:32:07,276 --> 01:32:10,528
but Belfast has the reason!

1100
01:32:16,493 --> 01:32:19,537
Good Vibrations isn't a record shop.

1101
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:21,122
It's not a label.

1102
01:32:21,832 --> 01:32:23,624
It's a way of life!

1103
01:32:32,092 --> 01:32:36,012
We're gonna do an old
Sonny Bono number...

1104
01:32:36,096 --> 01:32:37,555
because we fucking can.

1105
01:32:57,408 --> 01:33:00,660
# Why can't I

1106
01:33:01,996 --> 01:33:05,248
# Be like any guy?

1107
01:33:06,334 --> 01:33:11,338
# Why do they try
to make me run?

1108
01:33:13,132 --> 01:33:14,925
# Son of a gun

1109
01:33:15,468 --> 01:33:18,345
# What do they care

1110
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,599
# About the clothes I wear?

1111
01:33:24,434 --> 01:33:29,230
# Why get their kicks
from making fun?

1112
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:36,612
# Well, this world's
got a lot of space

1113
01:33:37,614 --> 01:33:41,158
# And if they don't like my face

1114
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:47,623
# It ain't me who's
going anywhere

1115
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:53,128
# No, for I don't care

1116
01:33:54,089 --> 01:33:56,298
# If they laugh at me

1117
01:33:58,552 --> 01:34:01,178
# If that's the fare

1118
01:34:03,591 --> 01:34:09,240
# I have to pay to
be free, then, baby

1119
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:12,105
# Laugh at me

1120
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,859
# And I'll cry for you

1121
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:19,737
# And I'll pray for you

1122
01:34:21,407 --> 01:34:25,702
# And I'll do all the things

1123
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:29,956
# That the man upstairs
says to do

1124
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,500
# I'll do it all for you

1125
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:36,629
# I'll do it all for you

1126
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:43,719
# It's gotta stop someplace

1127
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:48,265
# It's gotta stop sometime

1128
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:03,864
# Laugh at me #
