1
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,655
The lore tells us
of a valiant few

2
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,366
who stood above the fray
and fog.

3
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,952
My, what weapons
they must have wielded.

4
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,246
Which brings us
to our current exhibit,

5
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,915
the mythical staff of the gods.

6
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,625
In Homer's tale,

7
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,921
the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.

8
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,966
Oh.
Welcome, proud soldiers.

9
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,134
What did I say?

10
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,593
Museums are fun.

11
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,555
Amusement parks for the brains.

12
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,307
- Whoa!
- Okay,

13
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,683
there's no reason to get pushy.

14
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,102
Everyone will get a chance
to see it.

15
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,603
Carved from a heartwood

16
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,106
not seen in over 2,000 years,

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,442
the two halves
of this ancient replica

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,736
were recently discovered in,
of all places,

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,364
a waste processing plant
outside of Philadelphia.

20
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,782
So strong, they reportedly broke

21
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,743
three trash compactors.

22
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,037
Okay, um, friends,
that's enough.

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,456
I'm, I'm sort of the star
of the show here...

24
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,333
Stop!

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,500
Stop! Sir!

26
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,462
Sir!

27
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,882
Hey!

28
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,342
Hey, what are you doing?

29
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,764
Unleash the chaos.

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,855
Unleash the chaos.

31
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,574
Unleash the chaos.

32
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,135
Wait,
wait. Move, move, move!

33
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,930
No, no!

34
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,766
Help me!

35
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,373
No!

36
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,334
Ladies, please just let me go.

37
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,674
Oh, my God! Look out!

38
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,887
Turns out museums are fun.

39
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,518
Let's have more of it.

40
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,646
We can do nothing while
the staff remains sundered.

41
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,148
The champions of this realm
outnumber us.

42
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,318
Human champions are still humans

43
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,111
and we are gods.

44
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,031
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

45
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,325
To protect the power
of the gods,

46
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,119
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

47
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,957
the strongest, most keenly
intelligent champions

48
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,334
this realm has ever witnessed.

49
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm an idiot.

50
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,005
I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

51
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,757
Like, what am I even
contributing?

52
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,676
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

53
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,843
with a lightning bolt on it

54
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,971
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

55
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,724
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

56
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,101
and Batman is so cool!

57
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,228
And I'm just me.

58
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,711
And I can't say this
to anyone else,

59
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,249
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader,

60
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,108
but I feel like

61
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,276
a fraud.

62
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,652
You understand I'm a...

63
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,113
pediatrician,

64
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,825
right?

65
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,910
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

66
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,662
by another patient,
Billy Batson.

67
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,038
It doesn't matter.

68
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,873
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

69
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,834
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

70
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,335
All right, look.

71
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,980
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

72
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,880
but it sounds to me like

73
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,717
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

74
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,012
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

75
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,514
so if you don't mind me asking,

76
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,558
how well do you remember
your childhood?

77
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,059
Like it was today.

78
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,937
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

79
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,480
I mean, I never met my dad.

80
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,942
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

81
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,545
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

82
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,612
ran away from 11 homes,

83
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,904
got into a lot of fights.

84
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,197
Then I was abducted by a wizard

85
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,741
who gave me superpowers

86
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,468
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

87
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,660
That's not a small amount.

88
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,120
A doctor conjured seven demons

89
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,580
and held my whole family
hostage,

90
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,099
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

91
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,833
and then everybody
got superpowers,

92
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,686
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,396
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

94
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,340
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

95
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,884
Right?
Rejected by your parents,

96
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,469
then by the system,

97
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,180
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

98
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,848
I never said I was rejected
by my city.

99
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,393
"Rejected by city."

100
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,354
That's the Tribune.
Nobody reads the Tribune.

101
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,106
- I do.
- Anyway, okay, well, um...

102
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,859
I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.

103
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,447
There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...

104
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,783
- Hostage situation?
- Yeah.

105
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,210
I suck balls at this.

106
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,713
Why do we always have
to play war games?

107
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,507
Hey, it's practice
for our other job.

108
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,467
I'm serious.

109
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,678
Military strategy,
multiple team members,

110
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,513
each with a special skillset

111
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,890
unleashed against
an unknown enemy.

112
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,558
I know how it sounds,

113
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,411
but the house keeps getting
struck by lightning, Leo.

114
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,104
I'm telling you.

115
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,956
Besides, you're the one
always talking about teamwork.

116
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,441
But we don't need guns!

117
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,276
Darla?

118
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,486
This is it.
This is big time.

119
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,072
- We are the guns.
- Darla!

120
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,591
Why were there Skittles
in my pockets?

121
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,701
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

122
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,327
It was.

123
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,079
Hmm, she's very moody lately.

124
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,081
Why do you think
I put Skittles in her pocket?

125
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,333
- Oh.
- Whoo! Ole.

126
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,626
Is this an army of unicorns

127
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,420
- killing Genghis Khan?
- Yes.

128
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,130
Unicorns aren't real.

129
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,340
It's called speculative
history, Eugene. Look it up.

130
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,484
Billy, you can't just leave.

131
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,176
Your guy's gonna die!

132
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,970
Whoo!

133
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,724
- See?
- Yes.

134
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,100
I told you you would get into it

135
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,560
if you gave it a chance.

136
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,854
Yeah, I'm really starting
to see the appeal.

137
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,607
What's going on?

138
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,826
Dude, what are you doing?

139
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,453
Possible 10-99 in progress.

140
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,013
Multiple reports of cracking
on roadway.

141
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,873
Fraying suspension cables.

142
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,167
All units
to the Ben Franklin Bridge.

143
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,294
Yeah.
It's crazy music, Freddy.

144
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,629
It is, isn't it?
Very urgent melody to it.

145
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,857
We should see it performed live.

146
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,299
I was thinking the same thing.

147
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,735
I feel like we can get tickets
to that concert.

148
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,594
Two. Maybe not six.

149
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,804
All or none. That's the rule.

150
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,640
Yet I'm still gonna
walk backwards now.

151
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,226
So, now's your last
and final chance.

152
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,103
Billy Batson, come with me.

153
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,813
No, no, no!

154
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,816
Man, it sure is a beautiful
day in Philadelphia!

155
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,194
Is it though?

156
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,070
- Almost finished.
- Again?

157
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,364
- Okay.
- This better be good.

158
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,161
Whoa, whoa!
Where's everyone going?

159
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,788
Um...

160
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,872
To fight crime?

161
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,043
- Okay.
- Bye, Mom.

162
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,544
Bye, Mom.

163
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,588
- Bye.
- Bye, Rosa.

164
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,258
Give it time.

165
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,893
You guys ready?

166
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,479
Shazam!

167
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,380
Oh, my God.

168
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,466
It's gonna break!

169
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,095
Run!

170
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,443
♪ I need a hero ♪

171
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,614
♪ I'm holding out for a hero
Till the end of the night ♪

172
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,698
♪ He's... ♪

173
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,914
No, no, no.

174
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,757
No way, shut up!
Did I just save you

175
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
while you were listening
to this song?

176
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,970
No! I got you, I got you.

177
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,320
No need to panic.
Captain Everypower is here.

178
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,988
Oh.

179
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,078
I'm just kidding,
it's real easy.

180
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,214
Hi!

181
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,551
Oh, my gosh. Kittens!

182
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,180
Oh! They're so cute!

183
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,393
Did she just leave us?

184
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,896
Okay, let's go.

185
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,691
- Okay.
- No, no, no, I got ya!

186
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,445
That's my sidekick.
Captain Everypower Junior.

187
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,238
Hey! Junior?

188
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,698
You're gonna
wanna hold on tight.

189
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,970
Everyone's safe.

190
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,054
Awesome job, Mary.

191
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,474
Circle up, fam!

192
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,857
All right, here's the situation.

193
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,401
We have one more job to do

194
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,653
and that's to keep this bridge
from collapsing.

195
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,866
The Ben Franklin
Bridge has collapsed.

196
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,534
Fortunately, there are
no casualties.

197
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,244
Thanks in part
to our local heroes,

198
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,746
one with me now.

199
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,331
It's great to be here, Nancy.

200
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,542
What can I say?
It's all in a day's work.

201
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,270
Right. Well, how do you feel
about being dubbed

202
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,338
the Philadelphia Fiascoes?

203
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,340
Given that that's not
an official title,

204
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,300
we feel nothing about it.
That is not our name.

205
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885
Right, but
the important thing is...

206
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,804
What is wrong with these people?

207
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,432
Have you ever no...

208
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,518
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

209
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,370
Yeah, you should.
God only knows what they're up to.

210
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,164
Probably drugs, right?
Probably taking selfies

211
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,397
while vaping on TikTok.

212
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,482
Oh.

213
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,112
Is that a kitten?

214
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,613
No.

215
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,810
I'm gonna name you Tawny.

216
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,828
"Destroy bridge"?
What?

217
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,622
Not saving is different
than breaking. Am I wrong?

218
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,458
Am I wrong about this? Also,
we saved countless lives.

219
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,378
A hundred sixty-two.
It's countable.

220
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,380
Emotionally countless,

221
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,463
Mary.

222
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,009
Where's Eugene?

223
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,427
Where he always is.

224
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,013
Mapping out the Room of Doors.

225
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,643
Eugene!

226
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,146
Hey, buddy! Where you at?

227
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,108
Hey, Eugene.

228
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,530
Hello? We have a meeting,
Eugene.

229
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,578
Oh.

230
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,123
You're late.

231
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,042
Do not go in there.

232
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,423
All right, fam-jam,
let's jump in.

233
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,094
All right, big day,

234
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,931
big bridge,
kind of a couple blunders, right?

235
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,094
But we're gonna meditate
on those mistakes right now.

236
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Mary?

237
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,106
Organic chem is my meditation.

238
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,526
Said nobody with friends ever,
really.

239
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,154
In point of fact,
I'd have friends

240
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,697
if I had gone to college.

241
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,491
In point of fact
is exactly the kind of

242
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,825
smart thing that a smart person

243
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,220
who doesn't need
to go to college says.

244
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,745
So,

245
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,205
let's go back to the tape.

246
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,957
Now, guys, as you can see,

247
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,793
we started off real, real,
real, real strong, right?

248
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,545
Right up top, all that
cohesiveness, energy,

249
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,256
terrific!

250
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,467
Oh, sorry, Coach.
Gotta fly IRL.

251
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,945
No, no, no, I'm not done
with the presentation.

252
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,512
I know. And I love
these daily recaps.

253
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,847
I just gotta spread my wings
a bit before dinner.

254
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,034
- It helps keep me loose!
- Okay, fine, fine. No recap.

255
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,452
We'll go have a group hang
in the air. That sounds great.

256
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,061
I gotta test this slime
for toxicity

257
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,272
'cause I'm starting to...
tingle.

258
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,275
Oh. The, uh, Phillies game
just came on

259
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,319
so I'm gonna go ahead
and, uh, watch baseball.

260
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,488
It's right that I give
Tawny back.

261
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,866
Oh, come on!
What is happening?

262
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,952
What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!

263
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,287
If you say you have to work...

264
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,788
I have to work.

265
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,999
Why do you even have a job?

266
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,309
Wonder Woman doesn't have a job!

267
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,793
- Stop.
- No, seriously.

268
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,062
Do you think she wears
a ponytail and glasses

269
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,546
and, like, nobody recognizes her

270
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,065
and she's, like, an accountant
or something?

271
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,550
Just stop.
You are holding on too tight.

272
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,344
Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes

273
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,847
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

274
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,765
Or me wanting to go to college

275
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,309
means I'm abandoning the family.

276
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,852
Oh. Okay, cool,

277
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,812
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

278
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,022
Yeah.

279
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,815
Do you really not see yourself?

280
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,574
You turn 18 in five months.

281
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,909
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

282
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,454
Victor and Rosa are saints,
yes, but you're about to age out

283
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,372
of the foster system
just like I did.

284
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,125
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

285
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,208
Do you?

286
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,088
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

287
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,008
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

288
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,093
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

289
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,806
I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job.

290
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,475
I want to contribute.

291
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,352
At some point, Billy, like

292
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,687
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

293
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
leave home.

294
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,946
Nothing lasts forever.

295
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,875
I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

296
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,215
So, clearly, some things
do last forever.

297
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,086
Leave me to die.

298
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,423
Oh, but we come bearing gifts.

299
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,685
Magic.

300
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,562
Impossible.

301
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,814
This realm was sealed off
from magic.

302
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,485
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

303
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,280
From every god in this realm.

304
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,781
From me.

305
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,870
Do you not remember
what you took?

306
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,831
What my particular power was?

307
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,333
The power of elements.

308
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,004
No. I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

309
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,006
from entering the human realm.

310
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,258
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if...

311
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,718
Someone broke this?

312
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,929
How did...

313
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,639
Where is the Champion?

314
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,392
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

315
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,769
and yours that will mend it.

316
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,981
I told you
I would die before I help you.

317
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,377
Now, say the word.

318
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,630
Never. Never!

319
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,256
Never say never.

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,390
Say the word.

321
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,776
Say the word. Say the word.

322
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,320
Shazam!

323
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,144
Now we get to have our fun.

324
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,482
Fun is for children, dear.
We are at war.

325
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,979
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my goodness.

326
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,063
- I am so sorry!
- I'm so sorry!

327
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,463
No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry!

328
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,649
No, it's totally my fault.
Are you okay?

329
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,692
- I'm okay, yeah.
- Okay, yeah.

330
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,342
- I'm always okay.
- Good.

331
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,721
Uh, actually, do you...
do you know where this is?

332
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,930
Miss Saunders!

333
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,308
Yeah, absolutely

334
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,952
is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

335
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,662
Oh, no, no worries. If it
makes you feel any better

336
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,913
it's nothing compared
to the amount

337
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,147
that you're blushing right now.

338
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,523
Oh, I blush when I'm confident.

339
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,066
There she is.

340
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,277
- Hey.
- New girl. First period.

341
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,529
- Yeah.
- I'm Brett. This is Burke.

342
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,323
Listen, if you need anything
at all,

343
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,241
we're your guys. We got it.

344
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,327
Brett and Burke Breyer.

345
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,721
They got it all. I mean, what is it,
narcissistic personality disorder,

346
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,538
chlamydia, they got it.

347
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,498
Plenty of it to go around, too.

348
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,335
This is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid.

349
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,253
Fanboy here thinks
he's a big boy now.

350
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,772
Yeah, he doesn't know
where he belongs.

351
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,399
Sure I do. I don't belong
in that trash can.

352
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,026
'Cause that's... I'll smell
like human garbage,

353
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,970
do you realize that?
And that's your brand, guys!

354
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,263
Down goes Freeman.

355
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,473
Hey, hey! Look!

356
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,268
- Now I'm a superhero.
- Nice!

357
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,731
What is this thing doing here?

358
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,232
Janitors.

359
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,460
Get up, man.
What are you doin'?

360
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,818
Come on.

361
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,254
You're gonna want
to get this fixed, huh?

362
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,197
Yeah, that's probably
why you fell.

363
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,782
Yeah.
Bye, new girl.

364
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,991
Jeez, thanks Mr. Geckle.

365
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,618
Don't sweat it. That trash can

366
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,501
was like a second home to me
when I went here.

367
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,207
Hey.

368
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,833
You knew those guys
were gonna hit you,

369
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,752
but you stepped in anyway.

370
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,962
You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.

371
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,255
The funnier I am,

372
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,966
the more I get punched.

373
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,636
Well, it made me laugh.

374
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:32,846
So...

375
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,727
Hero.

376
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,150
You gonna walk me to class,
or what?

377
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,544
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

378
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,654
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes!

379
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,072
Thanks.

380
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,449
So, from the top.

381
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,661
What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

382
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,748
Yeah. Um, it's real inside
baseball, but basically,

383
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,251
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

384
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,253
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

385
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,297
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

386
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,716
- That was you?
- Yeah.

387
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,509
And they're still dicks to you?

388
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,028
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

389
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,430
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

390
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,806
You seem pretty cool to me.

391
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,642
Freddy!

392
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,063
Is my name.

393
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,858
Sorry, that was weird
and loud. I'm Freddy,

394
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,484
he said in a normal voice.

395
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,568
I'm Anne.

396
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,864
Anne.

397
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,450
- Nice!
- Bullseye.

398
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,118
Hey, you gotta fix
that crutch, bro!

399
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,121
What?

400
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,577
Good, little one.
Well done.

401
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,497
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

402
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
Wow. Um...

403
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,602
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

404
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,522
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

405
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,774
Romantic setting

406
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.

407
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,820
I mean, you went all out.

408
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,948
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

409
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,658
I'm just not sure

410
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,719
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

411
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,287
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

412
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,834
I promise this is
not about you. Okay? Look...

413
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,797
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

414
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,420
You and me.

415
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:14,007
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies.

416
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,177
She-zam.

417
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,555
I guess I'm just afraid
that I'm...

418
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,890
gonna let 'em all down.
You know?

419
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,679
That I'm gonna let you down.

420
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,733
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

421
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:32,985
Let's try this crazy thing.

422
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,319
Maybe we'll, uh...

423
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,575
seal it with a kiss?

424
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,673
Billy Batson!

425
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,967
You are a fool of a champion.

426
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,094
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

427
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,488
What happened
to her beautiful face?

428
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,139
Also, aren't you,
like, dead-ass dead?

429
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,391
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

430
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,393
The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

431
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,644
Daughters of Atlas?

432
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,146
They're coming to unmake
your world

433
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,107
and torture mankind
for all eternity

434
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,860
- in the Pit of Endless Agony.
- Okay, I feel like maybe

435
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,045
I should be writing
all this down.

436
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,195
- Quiet!
- Okay, okay.

437
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,197
You don't know what you've done.

438
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,241
I regret ever choosing you.

439
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,951
Because of you,

440
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,054
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

441
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,580
They will be hunting
for you now.

442
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,663
Hunting your family.

443
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,085
Hmm?

444
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,005
Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy.

445
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,466
The fate of your world
depends on it.

446
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,801
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

447
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,095
the daughters of Atlas
to do is...

448
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,159
Hey, Freddy?

449
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,799
Nope, over it.
Done it.

450
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,134
Check fraud? What,
are you kidding me?

451
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,804
Armored car heist?

452
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,139
I think I got that in the bag.

453
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,851
Shazam!

454
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,524
Whoo!

455
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,238
Bon appetit.

456
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,074
Hi.

457
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,743
- Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
- Hi.

458
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,161
Um, you wanna show me

459
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,038
where you were sitting
when it happened?

460
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,750
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

461
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,585
- Yeah. Follow me.
- Okay, yeah.

462
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,879
So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

463
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,552
So I was sitting, yeah...

464
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,013
Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting

465
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,347
right there.

466
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,598
- Here?
- Right there, yeah.

467
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,227
Oh, sorry.
Overbearing brother.

468
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,312
Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister.

469
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,596
Always has to know where I am.

470
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,898
Right.

471
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,275
I feel that, clearly.

472
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,901
Always thinks she knows
better, too.

473
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,504
Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

474
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,321
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

475
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,574
No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone...

476
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,451
Constantly breathing
down your neck.

477
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,345
- From the moment you wake up!
- 'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

478
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,747
No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.

479
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,558
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

480
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,625
No!

481
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,880
Oh! Billy! What...

482
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,381
What a coinkidink! Um...

483
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,383
I was just telling
my friend Anne

484
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,261
- what a great guy you are.
- We need to talk.

485
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,904
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

486
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,681
- He's a great talker.
- Freddy.

487
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,975
I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back. -Okay.

488
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,896
Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

489
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,189
The skin peeled off his face.

490
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,066
He turned into a literal
pile of ash.

491
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,234
- Yeah, seems definitive.
- I dunno.

492
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,446
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

493
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,007
and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.

494
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,699
Could be
astral projection powers.

495
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,993
- What's that?
- Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

496
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,846
- from the great beyond?
- That's it, I'm calling

497
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,330
an emergency meeting
after school.

498
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,373
- I want you there.
- Where else am I gonna go?

499
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,750
- What?
- Dude.

500
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,213
Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!

501
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,857
All right? It was already
like that and, and, and...

502
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,317
What is that, the Tribune?
It's fake news!

503
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,801
Freddy, we only have one rule.

504
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,177
All or none.

505
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,613
And it's a stupid rule,
by the way.

506
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,222
I have a girl talking
to me, Billy.

507
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,057
A girl. For the first time
in my life!

508
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,077
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

509
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,727
but I'll never find out

510
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,121
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

511
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,522
Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

512
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,608
Okay. Mmm.

513
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,860
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

514
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,362
Total control freak.

515
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,863
I think you guys
would get along.

516
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,740
Think you'd love her, actually.

517
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:49,950
Look, look, look. Fam,

518
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,493
I know it sounds crazy.

519
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,203
And, and obviously I don't know

520
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,205
exactly what this all means

521
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,873
but, but he was super aggro

522
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,976
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

523
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,460
He was yelling about all this

524
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,021
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

525
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,631
Do you have to talk so loud?

526
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,633
Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not
that loud.

527
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,427
I think this is
a perfectly acceptable indoor voice volume.

528
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,887
What is the deal?
Are you okay?

529
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,974
- Yeah.
- Why do you have sunglasses on?

530
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,697
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

531
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,813
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

532
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,607
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

533
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,652
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

534
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,613
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

535
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,949
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

536
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,492
No, she...

537
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,035
Yeah, can we get back on track?

538
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,662
Listen, he's yelling at me

539
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,664
and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas

540
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,624
are coming to hunt us.

541
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,042
So, check out what I found.

542
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,726
"The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring

543
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,962
of the Titan Atlas..."

544
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,505
which is obvious,

545
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,718
but also Nyx, the Goddess
of Night and Death.

546
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,137
Well, good things
can happen at night.

547
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,805
And death.

548
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,640
Let me see this.

549
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,690
"The daughters
guard the mythic Tree of Life

550
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,402
which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

551
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,362
which gave birth to their realm

552
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,822
protected by a...

553
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,950
- dragon."
- Hey, now.

554
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,219
And I am suddenly here for this.

555
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,745
I know, right?

556
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,181
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

557
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,998
- On the other hand, dragon!
- Dragon!

558
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,708
Mary. What are we doin'?

559
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,502
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

560
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,088
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

561
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,840
and, and, and look,

562
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,676
I often think that you think
better than me.

563
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,388
The wizard did not exactly give
me a tutorial here, guys, okay?

564
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,474
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

565
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,559
That, that room of doors,
or that violin

566
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,229
that is, like, constantly burning
which is super weird but also

567
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,792
definitely keeps
the lair cozy, right?

568
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,858
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

569
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,194
And it's not like
I'm not tryin'.

570
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,446
But I really,
really need your help.

571
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,451
Uh, I might know somebody
that can help.

572
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,583
Shut up. That lights up?

573
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,671
Shut up.

574
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,497
So, I'm mapping out
the entire lair

575
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,207
and you withhold this?

576
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,041
And you have really
been holding out on us.

577
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,125
Jeez Louise, dude.

578
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,505
- Whoa!
- "Whoa" what?

579
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,173
- "Whoa" what?
- Look!

580
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,591
Hey, Steve.

581
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,345
What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

582
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,029
Yeah, I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

583
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,682
He totally
looks like a "Steve."

584
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,229
"'Crime and Punishment, '
a book report by Pedro Pena?" -Yeah.

585
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,690
Pedro.

586
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,651
- Dude, that's cheating.
- I mean, he knows everything.

587
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,154
- Hmm.
- Seriously. Ask him.

588
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,655
You can just ask him stuff?

589
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,157
- Pretty much.
- Slick. Okay, cool.

590
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,868
Steve, we're looking
for information

591
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,911
about the daughters of Atlas.

592
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,955
Can you please help us
with that?

593
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,214
- These are book titles.
- Okay.

594
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,775
Let's just all pick a book,
or something.

595
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,177
Where's Freddy?
I mean, obscure mythology?

596
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,970
Definitely his thing.

597
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,598
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

598
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,647
You know I've actually never,
never been up here.

599
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,067
Don't lie.
This is where you hang out

600
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,402
with your superhero friends,
isn't it?

601
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,797
No, actually, why would they ever have
to... Why would they ever come here?

602
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,501
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

603
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,367
Do you actually know those guys?

604
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,495
Or is this like
a "Canadian girlfriend" situation?

605
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,847
Oh, you mean Collette?
Well, she and I

606
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,456
aren't really exclusive,
as of now.

607
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,118
Do you wanna meet one of them?

608
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,796
Meet, like how?

609
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,214
Like, face-to-face, right now.

610
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,716
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

611
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,051
And today is your lucky day,

612
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,011
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

613
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,347
Her?

614
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,932
- No, the male hot one.
- Him?

615
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,810
What? Him?

616
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,746
Look, I mean, it's all
subjective, right? But, um...

617
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,814
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

618
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,649
so... It's no big deal.

619
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,651
Is this a joke, Freddy?

620
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,445
'Cause I didn't mean
to make you actually prove it, really.

621
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,659
No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

622
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,512
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

623
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,622
So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

624
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,666
Hey, Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

625
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,460
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

626
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,729
Remember that time
I saved your life?

627
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,838
No, no, no, the other time.

628
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,339
Yeah.

629
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,800
Well, I'm calling in that favor.

630
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,394
You must be Anne.

631
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,188
Oh, my God.

632
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,233
Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

633
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,111
I am, actually. Yeah.
How are you...

634
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,033
You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,

635
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,201
but that kid,

636
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,744
he's the real hero.

637
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,872
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

638
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,540
I've never met anyone like him.

639
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,917
He's... genuine

640
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,670
and warm and funny.

641
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,338
- That's a lot of nice things.
- Yeah.

642
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,633
How did you two meet?

643
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,801
Comic Con.

644
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,803
- What's Comic Con?
- What?

645
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,138
According to this,

646
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,474
gods considered humans servants,

647
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,392
toys to be played with,

648
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,852
children to be punished.

649
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,481
Thanks, Steve.

650
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,025
Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

651
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,651
I'm reading about that
right now.

652
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,320
So, apparently, all of this

653
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,447
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

654
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,449
So Atlas, uh, the father

655
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,743
of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,

656
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,666
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

657
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,289
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

658
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,209
but also to take powers away
from others.

659
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,754
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

660
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,591
Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

661
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,218
But when things got bad,

662
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,221
a council of human wizards
got together and they

663
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,639
stole the staff from Atlas.

664
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,474
And they used that to take
his powers away.

665
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,035
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

666
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,536
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,

667
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,395
this is the wizard that I know!

668
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,605
What do these say?

669
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,529
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

670
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,239
Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,

671
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,907
Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,

672
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,284
Speed of Mercury." These are
the powers they stole.

673
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,619
No.

674
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,706
Whoa, guys, look!

675
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,333
This is what the name means.

676
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,894
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

677
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,836
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

678
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,048
If I may point out one
of the powers that may be possibly MIA.

679
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,591
Boop.

680
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,717
I'm sorry,

681
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,594
are you very unsubtly implying

682
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,305
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

683
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,182
- Solo Man?
- Yeah.

684
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,935
Well, maybe it comes later.

685
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,937
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

686
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,021
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah.

687
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,398
This is very, very hurtful.

688
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,667
I just want you all
to know that.

689
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,109
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

690
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,569
Oh.

691
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,320
What else have we learned, fam?

692
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:28,783
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

693
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,162
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

694
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,290
magical sphere

695
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,166
sealing it away forever.

696
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,419
Cut off from magic.

697
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,546
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

698
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,716
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

699
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,053
A bizarre and gruesome scene
unfolded

700
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,847
in Athens, Greece this morning.

701
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,992
Two women dressed in what
appears to be ancient Greek...

702
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,077
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's the wizard's
staff. How did they get that?

703
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,853
So, all those statues
used to be people.

704
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,857
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

705
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,025
where Greece is at?

706
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,196
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

707
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,281
You want it back?

708
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,245
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

709
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,581
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

710
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,790
- You know?
- What?

711
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,250
What do you mean,
"What?" What?

712
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,936
- You just left it there?
- We were all there.

713
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,046
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

714
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,797
You're welcome, by the way.

715
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,191
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

716
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,217
super bad-guy stuff with it,
okay?

717
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,802
You broke the staff,

718
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,721
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

719
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,014
Which we now know.

720
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,974
We also now know
what they look like,

721
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,827
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

722
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,852
- coming a...
- Three.

723
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,935
What?

724
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,482
Atlas had three daughters.

725
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,859
Kalypso, Hespera,

726
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,694
Anthea.

727
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,238
Anne... thea.

728
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,369
You know, I'm not
just a superhero.

729
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,663
I'm a super listener.

730
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,040
And...

731
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,249
I sense...

732
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,170
that you may have feelings
for Freddy.

733
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,089
Just wanna know
when he's coming back.

734
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,633
Don't want him to get hurt.

735
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,678
Oh, well, Anne...
I mean, we can't choose

736
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,429
the people we fall for.

737
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,056
What?

738
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,766
I'm not talking about that.

739
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,602
If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger.

740
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,729
Whoa! Look who you're with.

741
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,398
What could possibly
be dangerous?

742
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,481
Us.

743
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,361
Okay.

744
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,029
I see how it is.

745
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,113
Let's dance.

746
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,660
Oh, my God.

747
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,743
Freddy?

748
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,371
Ow!

749
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,914
Oh, Freddy, I, I didn't know.

750
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,416
I never meant
for you to get hurt.

751
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,334
Oh, I'm not the one
who's gonna get hurt.

752
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,168
Shazam!

753
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:47,796
Shazam!

754
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,924
Shazam.

755
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,009
- What's going on up here?
- Mis...

756
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,761
Freddy, are you all right?

757
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,762
Get back inside.
Just get back inside, Mr. Geckle.

758
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,014
I'm okay. Go back inside.

759
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,516
Who are you?
Do you have kids here?

760
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,952
What are you doing?
Don't hurt him.

761
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,520
I won't touch him.
You have my word.

762
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,323
Mr. G. Wha...

763
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,847
What did she say?
What are you doing?

764
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,203
What are you doing?

765
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,913
What are you...
no, no, no!

766
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,182
Stop, stop, stop! Wait,
wait, wait! Hey, no, no, no!

767
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,626
Wait, no, no, no!

768
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,132
I forgot how easily they burst.

769
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,341
Why would you do that?

770
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,343
Like grapes.

771
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,514
What the... Huh?

772
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,739
Now, child, tell us where
to find the others.

773
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,449
No need.

774
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,247
Clip his wings, Anthea.

775
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,984
Ow.

776
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,783
Wait.

777
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:42,829
There are more.

778
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,754
- Perfect. We take them all.
- No.

779
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,381
That's not why we're here.

780
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,591
We're here for the seed
of life. Yield, sister.

781
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,426
We stick to the plan we have.

782
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,594
Father would never yield.

783
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,179
And Father is dead.

784
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,849
Now, you know your place,
sister.

785
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,517
Or I will show it to you.

786
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,855
We do this our way, not theirs.

787
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,531
Make one move...

788
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,787
and I will snap
this child's neck.

789
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,775
Oh, Freddy.

790
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,783
Billy, no!

791
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,320
Billy, stay back!

792
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,083
They're using the staff
to take our powers.

793
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,249
What? What?

794
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:08,932
Sorry!

795
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,853
I'm sorry,

796
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,355
I'm sorry, just,
just save yourself.

797
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,983
No, no, all or none.
We stick together.

798
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,902
And that you will
because you cannot leave.

799
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,364
Let's see how you like being
sealed off in a dying world.

800
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,033
No!

801
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,201
No!

802
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,284
Freddy!

803
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,379
From
City Line Avenue in the north

804
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,423
to the western shore
of the Schuylkill River

805
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,799
to Cobbs Creek.

806
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,718
The unidentified barrier appears

807
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,344
to be in the shape of a dome

808
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,472
with no one allowed
into the city or out

809
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:52,351
with some suggesting
this strange magical element

810
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:57,356
may be the doing, or undoing,
of the Philadelphia Fiascoes.

811
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,710
- Holy sh...
- Shh!

812
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,255
I'm trying to sleep.

813
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,674
It is the only escape
from the tortures here.

814
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,885
Okay. Bleak.

815
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,346
Wait a second.

816
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,599
Hagrid beard, Batman voice.

817
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,226
You're the wizard.
You're the wizard! Oh, my...

818
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,787
You're back! Billy told me
all about you.

819
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,897
Billy? You know Billy Batson?

820
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,540
Billy Batson. Yeah,
he's my best friend.

821
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,442
I'm... I'm Freddy Freeman,
Captain Everypower.

822
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,360
Well, used to be.
It's complicated now.

823
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,987
She... It's complicated.

824
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,531
That halfwit Billy
gave you the powers of Shazam?

825
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,618
Yeah, he did. And he said
that you turned into ash, but, but didn't?

826
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,954
Once I gave him the power,

827
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,707
I could no longer remain
in my realm.

828
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,417
But death would have
been a luxury

829
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,419
compared to being trapped
in this cell

830
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,880
with the knowledge
of my failure, and with you.

831
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,256
Mostly with you.

832
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,525
A little more sarcastic
than Billy said,

833
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,301
but, hey, all good.

834
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,529
- Let's just get out of here.
- "Let's just get out of here."

835
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,763
Yeah, sure.

836
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,515
I sound nothing like that,
but okay.

837
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,933
Here's what we've got, um...

838
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,393
A cranky wizard
with a cynical streak

839
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,372
and a precocious young man with an
encyclopedic knowledge regarding magical shit.

840
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,359
There is no way these sisters
are keeping us in here.

841
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,242
These prison bars,
they're probably enchanted!

842
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,364
- What spells do you know?
- Please, stop talking.

843
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,573
How about an arcane focus?

844
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,200
I don't even know what that is.

845
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,286
Fine, then let's make a potion.

846
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,497
Like a potion of, um, giant
strength or diminution.

847
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,249
Oh! Gaseous form!

848
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,793
Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.

849
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,213
I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.

850
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,007
We will die here, Freeby.

851
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,969
It's Freddy, by the way.
"Freeby"? Where do you even...

852
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,470
The sooner you accept it,

853
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,597
the easier it will be.

854
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,225
Is this a tooth?
There's a tooth in here!

855
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,935
Hmm.

856
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,405
"Power
of elements. Power of chaos.

857
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,574
Power of axis."

858
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,159
These are primordial forces.

859
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,077
I don't know how we fight
powers like this.

860
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,996
I tell you how we fight it.

861
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,539
With the wisdom of...

862
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,709
- Solomon.
- Exactly.

863
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,586
We, we set up a meeting.

864
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,046
Yeah, we tell 'em we want
to negotiate.

865
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,257
Offer up our powers for Freddy.

866
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,176
But then we grab one of them

867
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,011
and that's what we really use
to trade!

868
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,637
But what if they steal
our powers?

869
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,848
No, they won't, 'cause we know
how they work now.

870
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,493
You know what I mean? If they just
point that staff at us, we dodge.

871
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,103
Like dodgeball.

872
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,355
- Hmm.
- Dude, I suck at dodgeball.

873
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,399
Well, maybe Pedro sucks
at dodgeball,

874
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,859
but not Super Pedro.

875
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,111
No, Super Pedro also sucks
at dodgeball.

876
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:52,156
Fine. Listen, all I know is that
there's five of us and three of them.

877
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,533
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

878
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,162
Okay.

879
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,247
So, Steve says that this paper

880
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,458
is a stack of magical parchment.

881
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,418
You write a message
on the magical paper

882
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,421
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

883
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,007
and then the paper folds
into a...

884
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,468
Oh, my God, yes!

885
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,304
A paper bird.

886
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,972
And it flies to the god.

887
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,849
Well, that's kinda cute.

888
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,978
Hey, what about demigods? Uh,
you know, like, Wonder Woman?

889
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,272
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

890
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:28,609
Did the pen just shrug?

891
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,737
Hey, Steve, do I just
dictate to...

892
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,865
I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

893
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,075
All right.

894
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,370
Letter...

895
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,332
Letter, writing a letter.
No, no, no!

896
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,000
I was just talking out loud.

897
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,044
That's not a part
of the letter. Wad that up, too.

898
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,672
Maybe if you try

899
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,799
- speaking from the heart.
- Hmm.

900
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,676
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

901
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,845
violence is not the answer."

902
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,369
Child,

903
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,454
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

904
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,956
Honesty.

905
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,626
Yeah, wow, very, um,
ironic subject choice.

906
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:29,753
The other Champions...

907
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,172
are they children like yourself?

908
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:34,049
What even is a child?

909
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,885
I mean, I know I shave,
like, every week-ish.

910
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,595
Yes or no?

911
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,806
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

912
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:44,393
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

913
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,896
- Give us their names.
- The names of the Champions?

914
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,109
Um, well, there's
Brett Breyer, and, uh, Burke Breyer.

915
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,527
Are you guys taking
this stuff in?

916
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,029
Writing this down? No?

917
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,280
They drive a Dodge Ram.

918
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,531
He's lying.

919
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,075
That's your superpower,
not mine.

920
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,879
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

921
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,121
One of you.

922
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,247
Probably you.

923
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,500
Hold him.

924
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,880
Don't...
What's happening?

925
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,214
What is that?
What's she doing?

926
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,758
Power of chaos.

927
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,177
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

928
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,846
Oh.
My mind is already trash,

929
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,182
so I'd actually like
to see you try.

930
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,392
Because nobody has the balls

931
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,561
to handle what's
inside my brain.

932
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,813
Say their names.

933
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,988
Say their names.

934
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,866
Say their names.

935
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,873
Destiny's Child did it better.

936
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,291
He is stronger than he looks.

937
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,337
- Say their names.
- Stop!

938
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,049
Billy...

939
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,012
Billy Bats...

940
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,267
Billy B...

941
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,811
Stop.

942
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,981
This is from the Champions.

943
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,318
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

944
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,821
violence is not the answer.

945
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,574
Oh, good first sentence.
Thanks, Darla.

946
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,326
- We'd like to make a trade.
- What?

947
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,911
We'll give up our powers

948
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,248
if you give us Freddy,
add 'unharmed.'

949
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,334
Otherwise, they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

950
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,794
Smart, Eugene.

951
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,171
Steve, add 'unharmed'

952
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,549
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

953
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,343
No, 'Sincerely, best'.

954
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,304
Maybe just signed
'The Champions.'

955
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,056
Should we proofread it?

956
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,308
Naw, Steve doesn't
make mistakes,

957
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,768
just writes what you say.

958
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:53,230
Great. I feel good
about this. Me, too.

959
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,191
Anyone else want a Gatorade?

960
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,484
Do we have red?"

961
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,113
What is this Gatorade?

962
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,909
- Is it a weapon?
- Sister.

963
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,912
We need not torture him
any longer. You heard the letter.

964
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,458
- Throw them in the pit.
- Wait.

965
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,002
They want to make a trade.

966
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,256
And we will meet, sister.

967
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,008
But humans are not
to be trusted.

968
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,678
The pit is just a bad name
for a fun place, right?

969
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,431
Right?

970
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,242
Are you hurt?

971
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,828
No, just worthless.

972
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,331
- Well, you must get up.
- For what?

973
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:56,210
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

974
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,212
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

975
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,005
Oh, feelings.

976
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,397
- I see something moving.
- Yeah, I see it, too.

977
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,164
Oh, shit.

978
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,584
What is that?

979
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,961
Ladon.

980
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,255
The guardian
of the Garden of Atlas.

981
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,600
- Run.
- I can't. I can't!

982
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,870
You're okay! You're okay.

983
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,581
I don't feel okay at all.

984
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:18,166
That's the power of the dragon.

985
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,419
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

986
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,796
Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal,

987
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,048
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

988
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,719
Power of axis. Very cool, very,

989
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,637
- very rare.
- Anthea!

990
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,681
I must go.

991
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,642
The door back to your world
is at the center of the labyrinth.

992
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,477
Right, left, left

993
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,063
and then follow
the right-hand wall to the center.

994
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,867
- You'll need this.
- How did you find this?

995
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,483
You once protected me
from the bullies

996
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,611
in your world, Freddy Freeman.

997
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:46,903
Now I've protected you in mine.

998
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,328
Hero.

999
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,497
Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

1000
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,166
I was about to rearrange
those boys'

1001
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,792
internal organs
when you stepped in.

1002
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,462
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1003
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,381
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1004
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:10,052
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

1005
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,723
How lovely for both of you.

1006
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,100
Goddess, we thank you much,
but we must get...

1007
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,895
You should go. My sisters
don't need you anymore.

1008
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,438
All they require now
is the seed.

1009
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,524
- The seed?
- Yes.

1010
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,401
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

1011
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,445
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

1012
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,947
You call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

1013
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,129
Hi, God... No?

1014
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,385
Yo, Low Voltage.

1015
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,055
When you fixing
this dome shit, man?

1016
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,556
Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry, sir.

1017
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,933
I have a plan.

1018
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,434
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1019
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,198
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

1020
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,521
No, these sandwiches?

1021
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,748
No, these sandwiches
are important.

1022
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,190
They're, they're for a meeting.

1023
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,527
Yeah, sure, Colonel Cheesesteak.

1024
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,194
Colonel?

1025
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,031
Oh, boy, I really need a name.

1026
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,037
Quiet one, she is.

1027
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,665
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1028
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,793
Is that...

1029
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,670
Oh, you're totally serious.
Okay.

1030
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,380
Uh...

1031
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,258
Right, so, look, here's
the thing, um, you're upset.

1032
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,141
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,

1033
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,470
which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.

1034
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,432
But, I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,

1035
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,476
like, really personally and, like,
I don't even know you, lady, right?

1036
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,979
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1037
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,148
and stole all your coin
and then fled,

1038
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,525
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1039
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,570
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

1040
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,071
dropped the money on the ground

1041
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,657
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1042
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,661
Now, imagine it is not money,

1043
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,955
but the lifeblood
of your father.

1044
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,040
The last breath of your mother.

1045
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,460
The power of all the gods,

1046
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,755
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1047
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,424
And now this magic courses
through you,

1048
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,301
and you have the gall

1049
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,845
to believe that you deserve it?

1050
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,349
This is very personal,

1051
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,642
Billy.

1052
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,565
You are very menacing.

1053
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,859
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

1054
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,571
I see the presence
that you have, and that goes a long way.

1055
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,158
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1056
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,118
There is no compromise.

1057
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,120
I knew you were gonna say that.

1058
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,498
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

1059
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,083
Give us back Freddy,
you take down this

1060
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,337
sphere-y dome-y magic bowl thing

1061
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,963
and then, you know,

1062
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,691
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1063
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,925
It's a good offer.

1064
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,134
I'm being serious.

1065
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,804
You play the part of a man,

1066
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,264
but you do not play it well.

1067
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,600
Give us the powers, child.

1068
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,061
All of them.

1069
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,896
You are no leader, Billy.

1070
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,816
You are a lost boy

1071
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:14,110
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1072
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,363
Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1073
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,406
'cause I'm not, like,
super old like you,

1074
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,701
but I think I have
a few experiences that you don't have.

1075
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:25,038
'Cause I've seen all of the
Fast and the Furious movies, lady.

1076
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,706
And let me tell you something.

1077
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,835
It's all about family!

1078
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,467
Family!

1079
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,679
Guys, that was the signal. We practiced
this, like, 12 times. Thank you.

1080
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,764
Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?

1081
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,977
No, human.
You forgot about mine.

1082
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,530
Come on!

1083
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,614
- Let's go.
- Pedro!

1084
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,861
You're wasting my time, boy.

1085
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,068
Yeah.

1086
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,361
Whoo!

1087
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,071
She sure didn't see that coming

1088
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:25,033
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor.

1089
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,826
Uh, Darla, that was, 'cause...

1090
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,371
A euphemism. That was a euphemism.

1091
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,254
No!

1092
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,477
We've taken the power from two

1093
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,354
in your family already.

1094
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,940
And now two more must die,
and for what?

1095
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,484
So you can keep playing soldier?

1096
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,106
My father was Atlas.

1097
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,026
Titan god of stamina
and strength.

1098
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,489
His magic and power
may course through you,

1099
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,868
but you will never
be a true god.

1100
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,911
Oh, yeah? Did your dad
have superspeed?

1101
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,626
Nope!

1102
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,885
You okay? That was fun.
Let's go.

1103
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,849
Come on. Come on, come on.

1104
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,103
Hurry, everyone!

1105
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,187
Let's go, let's go.

1106
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,824
What?

1107
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,161
You thought you were just goin'

1108
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,680
into some regular porta-potty,
didn't ya?

1109
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,873
Which I can somehow still smell.

1110
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,101
Yeah, yeah, it really sticks
around. It's crazy, right?

1111
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,251
- Yeah.
- Like, permeates

1112
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,878
the air.
Doesn't matter. Anyway,

1113
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,338
welcome to the Rock of Eternity.

1114
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,632
Only Champions

1115
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,093
can get in here,
through any door that we want.

1116
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,887
Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.

1117
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,473
Guys, that's what I call
a total success.

1118
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,893
Okay, maybe, like,
a partial total win.

1119
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,812
- Told you I suck at dodgeball.
- Yeah,

1120
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,313
you do, yeah, but you know,

1121
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,749
look, Pedro, we all have
our weak spots.

1122
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,066
You know what I mean?

1123
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,776
And hers...

1124
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,402
lack of strategic thinking.

1125
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,363
Now for the real trade.

1126
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,783
Freddy and the staff,
for your freedom.

1127
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,243
And get rid of the dome.

1128
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,410
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,621
And get rid of the dome.

1130
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,248
'Cause the city
of brotherly love

1131
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,499
is gettin' a little moist.

1132
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,336
Word choice, man.

1133
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,480
Yeah, I regretted it as soon as

1134
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,131
it was coming out of my mouth.

1135
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,132
It's just one of those words...

1136
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,215
I know. I just...

1137
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,140
"Dear daughters
of Asshat-Las."

1138
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,891
Burn!

1139
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,226
I just came up with that.

1140
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,537
Make sure you put a dash
in there, though,

1141
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,437
so it's really clear. Okay.

1142
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,857
Man, it's so good having
Steve cover grammar

1143
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,221
and spelling and stuff,
it makes me sound so much smarter.

1144
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,987
So...

1145
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,030
"A brother for a sister, huh?

1146
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,740
How's that feel?

1147
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,618
Also, how are you
actually sisters,

1148
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,413
because the age difference
is very noticeable,

1149
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,708
and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."

1150
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,127
Even though I don't like you
very much,

1151
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,087
I believe everyone
deserves human rights,

1152
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:07,881
but you don't deserve
strawberry.

1153
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,800
You only get yellow.

1154
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,219
She's gone!

1155
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:16,973
Wait, what?

1156
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,694
I thought we brought her in
too easily.

1157
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,779
She wanted to get caught.

1158
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,241
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1159
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,836
Well, this seemed inevitable.

1160
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,179
Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks, bozo.

1161
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,349
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1162
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,975
I don't know.

1163
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,353
You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,

1164
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,396
you know nothing about magic,
you're just...

1165
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,109
You're the wizard.

1166
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,362
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

1167
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,114
Now let's see if that
girlfriend of yours can be trusted.

1168
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,632
Get back, get back. Get back.

1169
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,513
Okay,
I think the coast is clear. Let's go home.

1170
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:03,871
One moment.

1171
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,291
Did you not see
what she was holding?

1172
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,042
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1173
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,419
What's the big deal?

1174
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,755
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1175
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,590
From the Tree of Life.

1176
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:16,955
Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

1177
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,264
- Billy!
- Billy. Gosh.

1178
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:24,975
Where are you going now?

1179
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,819
Nope.

1180
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:35,902
She's not in there.

1181
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,197
Nope.

1182
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,907
No, no, no.
That's a hard pass.

1183
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,951
- That's a hard pass.
- Yo, Billy,

1184
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,494
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1185
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,264
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1186
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,956
Like an ancient Greek

1187
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,041
- labyrinth?
- Guys...

1188
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,336
porta-potty.

1189
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,087
Mmm.

1190
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,431
Hespera.

1191
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,439
It's over, sisters.

1192
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,025
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1193
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,780
Or we plant it in their realm.

1194
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,200
But that would destroy
their world.

1195
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,577
Just as they destroyed ours.

1196
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,788
You can't be serious.

1197
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,664
- Yes.
- No.

1198
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,208
No, that's not
what we agreed to.

1199
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,959
Anthea, you simpering bore.

1200
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,586
She's right, we've spent ages

1201
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,129
waiting for this moment.

1202
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,547
We have the seed.

1203
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,508
We have the staff
and its powers.

1204
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,967
We are not squandering it

1205
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,844
for your personal satisfaction.

1206
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,889
No, I should go, not you.

1207
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,933
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

1208
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,286
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly sing "sneak thief."

1209
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,705
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy when you walk.

1210
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,980
It's pathetic.

1211
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,107
See?

1212
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,609
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1213
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,778
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1214
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,365
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1215
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,827
That's it.
You nailed it.

1216
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,453
I'll see you on the other side.

1217
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,373
Even if we did, the Tree of Life

1218
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,125
would not thrive in their soil.

1219
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,294
It would despoil, it would
disfigure into something...

1220
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,712
Monstrous?

1221
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:19,173
That is what humans are.

1222
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,176
It is only fitting
that we bring our monsters to their world

1223
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,720
and do to them
as they did to us.

1224
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,017
We agreed to restore balance

1225
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:33,563
and vengeance has
great measure of weight on those scales.

1226
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,649
Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1227
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,609
- No, not all.
- All.

1228
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:42,155
Sister, I fear your rage has
gotten the better of you.

1229
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,406
Why?

1230
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,825
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1231
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,035
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1232
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,413
They actually pray
for order and peace

1233
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,624
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1234
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,918
Anthea, I want you
to take the apple

1235
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,087
and plant it in our garden.

1236
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:00,923
Of course you turn to her.

1237
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,675
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1238
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,345
Where did that even come from?

1239
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,891
- Hi!
- You favor her, Hespera,

1240
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,559
and see how she betrays us.

1241
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:16,832
Deliver him
to his proper fate, sister.

1242
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,983
- No!
- Kill him!

1243
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,197
What is that?

1244
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,073
Great question.
No idea.

1245
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,743
But made you look.

1246
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:29,994
Billy!

1247
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,539
- Oh!
- Oh.

1248
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,333
Your crutch!

1249
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,336
Oh! Shazam!

1250
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,419
- Yes!
- No!

1251
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:45,343
So, we have a lot to talk about.

1252
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,730
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1253
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,234
You are not fit to wield it.

1254
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,652
More fit than you.

1255
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,415
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1256
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,782
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,

1257
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,909
but everyone here
has become weak.

1258
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,204
Ladon, world-eater,

1259
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,582
rise from the pit!

1260
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,051
Go, go, go!

1261
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,445
Captain Everypower! Where's he going?

1262
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,762
What the...

1263
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,403
Victor?

1264
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,531
Victor, wake up.

1265
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,826
Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?

1266
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,452
Dad. We gotta go!

1267
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,656
- We gotta get out of here.
- We have to go right now!

1268
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,915
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1269
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,726
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1270
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,419
Just don't freak out.

1271
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,193
I said don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.

1272
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,857
Rosa, it's Billy, okay?
And that's Eugene,

1273
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,178
- and that's Freddy...
- It's me.

1274
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,573
That's Darla
and that's Mary, obvi,

1275
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,056
and then Pedro,
just normal Pedro.

1276
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,327
Guys, this is no time
for secrets, okay?

1277
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,562
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1278
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,023
- We're superheroes.
- I'm gay.

1279
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,107
Yeah, we know, bud.

1280
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:25,693
- You knew?
- Yeah.

1281
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,988
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1282
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,865
- I'm the wizard.
- Oh, this is the wizard.

1283
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,508
He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

1284
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,303
Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1285
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,328
Put on these clothes.

1286
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,912
This is so weird.

1287
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,205
Yep, yep.

1288
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:40,875
You guys are
the Philly Fiascoes?

1289
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,253
Okay. This is in no way
an acknowledgement of that stupid nickname

1290
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,398
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1291
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,382
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1292
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,801
Dragon?

1293
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,131
You okay?

1294
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,215
Okay.

1295
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,052
I know this is a lot to take in,

1296
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,054
but I promise
to explain it all later.

1297
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,847
Explain what?

1298
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,617
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1299
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,327
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1300
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,520
- Yeah.
- Wait, you bought the house?

1301
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,854
Yeah.

1302
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,238
Run! Go!

1303
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,914
Oh, no.

1304
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:05,835
Get down.

1305
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,378
Okay, that's it!

1306
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:12,299
Again?

1307
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,218
Freddy!

1308
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,682
Hey, hey!
This is what you want, right?

1309
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,656
Come on, we're good.

1310
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,340
We're safe right now.
Let's go. Let's go.

1311
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,683
Mary!

1312
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,687
No.

1313
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,103
Hey. Are you okay?

1314
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:49,854
You okay?

1315
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,357
All right.

1316
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,903
Now, where is this dragon?

1317
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,391
Fitting place for a garden.

1318
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1319
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,297
Go! Let's go, let's go!

1320
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:09,847
Oh, God, I'm slipping!
Slipping!

1321
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,018
My shoe!

1322
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,289
Holy moly.

1323
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,603
You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,

1324
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,189
but it is the least
of our problems right now.

1325
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,985
Your world will not
survive this.

1326
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,278
Yeah, no shit, Merlin!

1327
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,362
He's right.

1328
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,115
Anne!

1329
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,701
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm okay, I'm fine.

1330
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,496
In the God Realm, this tree...

1331
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,832
is a thing of beauty.

1332
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,584
Of peace.

1333
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,087
It was not meant
for the soil of this realm

1334
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,297
and it's become monstrous
by the hand that planted it.

1335
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,424
Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1336
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,593
I must try to sway Hespera.

1337
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,637
Only she can subdue our sister.

1338
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,722
I will give it my all,
or die trying.

1339
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,265
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1340
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,868
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1341
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,394
My sweet Freddy,
I'm ready if need be.

1342
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,021
I've lived a long life.

1343
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:42,665
What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life?"

1344
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:43,524
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1345
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,567
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1346
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,069
Oh?

1347
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,612
You look great.

1348
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:51,197
Oh.

1349
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,205
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1350
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,288
Yeah.

1351
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,591
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1352
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,218
We have to figure something out.

1353
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,595
Take my powers back.

1354
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,013
- No, Billy!
- No, no, no.

1355
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,723
Hey, take my powers back.

1356
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,076
You gave 'em to me, so you can
take 'em back, right?

1357
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,269
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1358
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,538
You think I know
how to fix this, dude,

1359
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,188
but I really don't, okay?

1360
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,566
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1361
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,252
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1362
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,861
which means you know what to do.

1363
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,904
And you were right.

1364
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,157
You picked
the wrong champion, man.

1365
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,093
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1366
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,244
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1367
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,708
And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

1368
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:43,917
No.

1369
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,460
You don't have a shred of wisdom

1370
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,004
in that brain of yours.

1371
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,799
But your heart is wise.

1372
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:54,303
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1373
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:57,931
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1374
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,602
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1375
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,146
with my brothers and sisters.

1376
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,939
But when you shared your powers,

1377
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,775
you did not hesitate.

1378
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:11,153
For you, everyone can be worthy

1379
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,738
if given a chance.

1380
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,158
Now, go fight for your family.

1381
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,410
Go fight for the world.

1382
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,704
I chose right when I chose you.

1383
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,751
Billy?

1384
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,628
Billy, what are we gonna do,
man?

1385
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:30,714
Same thing we
always do, Freddy. Save the God darn world.

1386
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,466
Now, I'm gonna go get that staff

1387
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,301
and I need you to lure
these things away

1388
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,095
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1389
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,931
Wait, wait, wait, Billy, Billy.

1390
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,183
Can I just see you,
before you go?

1391
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,227
Not this version.

1392
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,145
You... You.

1393
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,313
My Billy.

1394
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,528
Shazam!

1395
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,158
Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?

1396
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:02,578
Hey.

1397
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,588
I promise after this

1398
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:13,423
if I don't get eaten
by a dragon,

1399
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,760
I'm not gonna force you
to keep me.

1400
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:19,054
- Okay?
- What?

1401
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,847
I know I age out soon.

1402
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,767
Billy.

1403
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:28,230
My wonderful, kind, brave, son.

1404
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,713
You will never age out
of your home.

1405
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:32,693
Never.

1406
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,283
Now, do me a favor

1407
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,743
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

1408
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:44,246
go kick their ass, okay?

1409
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,581
I love you, Mom.

1410
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,250
Me too.

1411
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,088
Shazam!

1412
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,762
That's gonna take
some getting used to.

1413
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,639
Everybody to the battle wagon!

1414
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:03,974
The battle wagon?

1415
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,077
Trying to get
into the spirit of things.

1416
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,080
Don't you see what
you're doing to these people?

1417
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,164
I do.

1418
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,834
And what I see is just.

1419
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,252
Hespera, look at this tree.

1420
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,921
It is blighted.
It is unnatural here.

1421
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,840
We made a vow
to restore our realm,

1422
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,508
not destroy another.

1423
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,385
A god has answered
their prayers at last.

1424
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,721
They did not know their place,

1425
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,306
so I am showing it to them.

1426
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:47,934
Your fanatical tone
echoes our uncle Hades.

1427
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,020
No. I'm putting an end
to this.

1428
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,197
Hespera.

1429
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,162
No!

1430
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,915
Hespera.

1431
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:13,794
If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,

1432
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,171
then perhaps you should
be human.

1433
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,729
Help, somebody!

1434
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,106
Somebody help!

1435
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,232
Somebody help!

1436
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,264
Okay, now what? There are only
so many minotaurs

1437
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:32,448
I can run over with this van.

1438
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,960
Hey, Steve.

1439
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,131
What are monsters afraid of?

1440
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,094
"The king of beasts."

1441
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,262
Lions?

1442
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:48,430
Unicorns.

1443
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:50,515
Really? I love unicorns.

1444
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,559
Yet, the unicorn
does not love you.

1445
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,603
Guys, unicorns don't exist.

1446
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,521
What?

1447
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:01,151
- Oh, my...
- Ah!

1448
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,028
I guess maybe it's not so crazy.

1449
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,114
The unicorn is the most
fearsome creature of its realm.

1450
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,616
Ruthless and cruel,

1451
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,010
not like the ponies
from your storybooks.

1452
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,494
They loathe humanity.

1453
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:12,120
Is there anything they do like?

1454
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,749
"Dark caverns. Ambrosia"?

1455
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,393
Ambrosia. It's like the nectar
of the gods.

1456
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,085
It's supposed to be sweet,
like honey.

1457
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,378
I have an idea.

1458
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,130
Go, go! Quick, quick.

1459
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:24,841
Guys, get as many of these
people to safety as you can.

1460
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:27,052
Kids?

1461
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:32,766
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go!

1462
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,101
Wizard?

1463
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,186
I'm going with them.

1464
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,062
Freddy?

1465
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:41,398
Anne?

1466
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,152
Anne!

1467
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,236
Anne!

1468
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:51,034
I am not entirely sure
how to parent, here.

1469
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,627
Hey! Khaleesi!

1470
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:16,518
Whoo! That was
really satisfying.

1471
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,601
How was that for you?

1472
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,663
Yeah.

1473
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,873
We love you, Thundercrack.

1474
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:40,417
You're the best, Captain Marvel.

1475
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,211
- Yeah, go, High Voltage!
- Oh, wassup, bro?

1476
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,422
It's Maximum Voltage actually,
amongst other names.

1477
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,257
We're still kinda
workshopping it, so...

1478
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,558
You thought you were
invulnerable.

1479
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,393
But, no.

1480
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,145
Magical fire.

1481
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,063
Magic can kill magic.

1482
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:03,857
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
"Magic kills magic."

1483
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,442
Way ahead of you, lady.

1484
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,586
I'm just trippin' out
because I've never seen

1485
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:07,861
my suit burn like this.

1486
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:10,405
Also, nobody messes
with my town!

1487
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,324
Know what I'm saying?

1488
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,576
I defeated my traitor sister.

1489
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:15,785
A god.

1490
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,871
You think I won't destroy you?

1491
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:06,628
The staff is absorbing it all.

1492
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:08,504
Like a battery.

1493
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:15,970
That's right.

1494
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:18,306
Run!

1495
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,933
This is a terrible idea.

1496
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,185
You don't understand
the savagery, the barbarity.

1497
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:26,606
Oh, no.

1498
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,429
- Hello.
- No.

1499
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,350
It's okay. Come here.

1500
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:08,356
Darla...

1501
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,734
It's okay. Good girl.

1502
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:20,618
- Whoa, watch out!
- Whoa!

1503
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:22,579
Darla!

1504
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:45,852
Taste the rainbow.

1505
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:49,481
Good, isn't it?

1506
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,608
It's the closest to ambrosia
we have.

1507
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:17,633
Good girl.

1508
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,600
Whoa!

1509
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,402
We're gonna need more Skittles.

1510
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:14,732
Taste the rainbow, motherfu...

1511
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:37,005
No, no, no.

1512
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,548
Lady, lady, you can't die!

1513
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,633
Come on, Billy, come on!
Powers, powers, powers.

1514
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:43,970
Medical powers. No.
How-to-fix-dead-people powers.

1515
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,187
Clear?

1516
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:56,232
Whoa! Come on!
One more time. Clear!

1517
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:57,734
Stop! Stop!

1518
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:00,194
Let me go to the Underworld
in peace, please.

1519
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:03,239
Oh, lady, lady,
listen to me, okay?

1520
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:04,657
I don't want anyone else to die.

1521
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,051
Not my family, not Anthea,
not anyone,

1522
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,535
and we can save them.

1523
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,995
This all came
from the tree, right?

1524
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:10,622
I might know a way to destroy

1525
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,081
the tree and the dragon
all in one.

1526
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:15,543
Ladon's powers
are too great, boy.

1527
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,128
Well, not if I can overload
the staff

1528
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,505
- with enough lightning.
- A bomb?

1529
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,067
Is that enough
to kill the dragon?

1530
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,092
And more.

1531
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,512
You would annihilate

1532
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,640
everything that's inside
the dome.

1533
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,018
Well, then I have
one more favor to ask.

1534
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,981
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.

1535
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:38,232
There's shelter ahead.

1536
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:40,568
There's shelter ahead.
Let's go.

1537
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:42,612
Walk, don't run.
There's shelter ahead.

1538
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:44,488
Let's go, let's go.

1539
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:47,784
Keep going. Keep going!

1540
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:49,202
Anne!

1541
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,285
Anne!

1542
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:53,289
Anne!

1543
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,631
Go. Run.

1544
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,883
Watch that rear.

1545
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:17,897
Go, go, go!

1546
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:27,573
Back away!

1547
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:29,951
Run, run, run!

1548
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:40,169
Anne!

1549
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:41,337
Ladon,

1550
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,423
kill the traitor.

1551
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:17,623
Impossible.

1552
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:18,999
Bow him!

1553
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:35,641
I lost it. Freddy, I can't.

1554
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:37,435
What is a god without her power?

1555
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,645
The most powerful thing
about you

1556
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:40,938
is you.

1557
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:42,190
You taught me that.

1558
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:52,325
Kill them!

1559
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:11,844
Boom!

1560
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:14,305
That must be super
disappointing as a dragon.

1561
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,309
Assuming that you are one.

1562
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:20,103
I mean, you fly,
and you breathe fire,

1563
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:22,313
but you're also made of wood
which is a weird flex

1564
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,607
and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.

1565
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:26,984
Freddy, Anthea, don't!

1566
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,490
Ah, made you look!

1567
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:34,158
Oh, lady, that's twice.

1568
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:36,327
And I didn't even need
a flaming violin that time.

1569
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,956
You want the staff?
Come get it.

1570
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,492
Now, Hespera.

1571
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,079
Now, Hespera.

1572
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:24,792
Now. Now.

1573
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:26,979
No.

1574
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,564
No! No!

1575
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:54,006
Remove the dome.

1576
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:56,050
As long as I still breathe,

1577
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:59,553
the dome still stands.

1578
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:03,391
Till I see you
on the other side, sister.

1579
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:48,602
Billy!

1580
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:50,354
- Get out of there.
- I can't.

1581
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:51,522
Billy.

1582
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,149
I have to do this.

1583
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:56,736
Billy, what are you doing?

1584
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,130
You're not supposed
to be in there.

1585
01:41:58,154 --> 01:42:01,365
Yeah, I am.

1586
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,343
I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,

1587
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:05,077
that I didn't deserve my powers,

1588
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:08,062
but there's something
that I can do.

1589
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:09,622
No.

1590
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:12,209
I can save all of you.

1591
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:13,794
But it's all or none!

1592
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:15,629
Yeah.

1593
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,953
All of my family gets to live
and none of them gets hurt.

1594
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:23,304
Freddy, I've never
had a family. You know that.

1595
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,348
Everybody I've ever cared
about, they all left me.

1596
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:27,224
My mom, my dad, everyone.

1597
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,353
So when I found you guys,
I had to hang on

1598
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:31,663
and I've been hanging on
too tight.

1599
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,064
No.

1600
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,707
I should have let you
do your own thing.

1601
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,402
Now it's time for you to fly.

1602
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:39,486
What about you?

1603
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:46,285
I'm Captain Everypower Junior.

1604
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:50,122
Don't you forget it.

1605
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:44,593
We end this now.

1606
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:47,012
Yeah. We do.

1607
01:43:58,023 --> 01:43:59,483
Come on, Billy.

1608
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:28,846
He's got this. We got this.

1609
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,806
He's got this. He's got this.

1610
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:31,932
Billy.

1611
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:37,521
Fly.

1612
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:51,952
Billy.

1613
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,621
Come on, baby.
Come on, let's go!

1614
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:02,755
No!

1615
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:46,798
Whoa!

1616
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:50,718
Ah.

1617
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:56,076
Shazam!

1618
01:47:12,801 --> 01:47:13,801
Billy.

1619
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:17,264
A true god,

1620
01:47:17,348 --> 01:47:19,350
after all.

1621
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:12,778
He did it.

1622
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:21,619
We must go.

1623
01:48:29,086 --> 01:48:30,086
Billy?

1624
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:31,671
Billy?

1625
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:34,090
Billy!

1626
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,969
Billy!

1627
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,931
Billy. Where are you?

1628
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:42,057
Billy!

1629
01:48:44,059 --> 01:48:45,059
Billy?

1630
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:51,108
Billy! Billy.

1631
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:54,862
Billy!

1632
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:55,945
Billy!

1633
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:58,198
Billy!

1634
01:48:58,282 --> 01:48:59,533
Dude, wake up. You did it.

1635
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:04,079
Okay. You're supposed
to wake up.

1636
01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:05,223
It's the part where you wake up

1637
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:06,957
and open your eyes and laugh

1638
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,127
and you're supposed to say
you got me, 'cause you got me.

1639
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,005
Dude. Joke's over, man.

1640
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:14,840
Billy!

1641
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:19,178
Billy. Billy, come on.

1642
01:49:21,722 --> 01:49:23,015
Freddy.

1643
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:27,561
What did you do?

1644
01:49:29,897 --> 01:49:30,981
Wake up, Billy.

1645
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:32,775
- Billy?
- He's over here!

1646
01:49:35,903 --> 01:49:36,903
Billy.

1647
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:40,574
You asshole!

1648
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:44,203
We're a team! We're a team!

1649
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:46,412
Oh, Billy.

1650
01:49:47,748 --> 01:49:49,124
Billy.

1651
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,335
Oh, my baby. No.

1652
01:49:55,964 --> 01:49:57,508
He was a hero.

1653
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:01,595
He was a hero and a god.

1654
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:03,764
And he should be laid
to rest like one.

1655
01:50:08,268 --> 01:50:09,561
Hey, pal.

1656
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:19,464
Will this land ever come back?

1657
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:23,260
The staff is drained of magic.

1658
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:26,179
Only the spark of a god
can restore its power

1659
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,724
and there are no gods left.

1660
01:51:30,309 --> 01:51:31,602
There is one.

1661
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:51,287
What?

1662
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,701
Whoa.

1663
01:52:48,887 --> 01:52:49,888
Whoa.

1664
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:19,959
It's a zombie!

1665
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:23,296
Guys!

1666
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:25,549
What the hell?

1667
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:27,509
You buried me?

1668
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:29,970
In what, like, two minutes?

1669
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:31,054
Oh, Billy!

1670
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:33,932
Hey.

1671
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:36,268
Oh, man. I missed you guys.

1672
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:40,772
Hi. Hey.

1673
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,650
Oh, my God. Hi.

1674
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:45,360
Why didn't anybody tell...

1675
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:47,320
Hi. Sorry, sorry,
I didn't, uh...

1676
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:50,365
I didn't see you there,
I was, um, I was...

1677
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:51,533
I was dead at the time.

1678
01:53:52,617 --> 01:53:53,702
So, you, uh...

1679
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:55,996
you got my bird letter?

1680
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:58,582
Oh, I, uh...

1681
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:01,626
I think you've got something...

1682
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,671
On my...

1683
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:06,173
Where... Oh.

1684
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:07,924
What?

1685
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:09,843
That's a spider.

1686
01:54:09,926 --> 01:54:11,428
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

1687
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,930
Also,
that's really embarrassing.

1688
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:15,223
Yes, it is.

1689
01:54:15,307 --> 01:54:17,684
But it was an amazing thing
you did.

1690
01:54:17,768 --> 01:54:19,644
The sacrifice you made.

1691
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:22,647
You brought this world
back to life.

1692
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:24,858
Maybe this time, gods and humans

1693
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,568
can learn to live in peace.

1694
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:27,651
Yeah.

1695
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:30,947
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

1696
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:34,701
Be well, Billy Batson.

1697
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:39,706
Hey, you know, just because
your father's power

1698
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,291
is surging through me,

1699
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:43,460
that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

1700
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:45,003
and I'm gonna be 18

1701
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:46,797
in, like, five months, so...

1702
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,091
Stick to saving the world, kid.

1703
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:51,093
Yeah, you know, like,
that's... Okay, cool.

1704
01:54:51,176 --> 01:54:52,719
See ya.

1705
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:54,513
What's with our boys
and older women?

1706
01:54:57,432 --> 01:54:59,184
Hey.

1707
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:00,727
Who wants their powers back?

1708
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:04,689
We can do that, right?

1709
01:55:04,773 --> 01:55:05,816
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay, good.

1710
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,067
Good, good, good.

1711
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:08,860
I'd like our house back.

1712
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:10,070
Can we do that?

1713
01:55:12,072 --> 01:55:13,865
- Dinner!
- Coming.

1714
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:16,118
Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.

1715
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:22,207
Anthea.

1716
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:23,559
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

1717
01:55:23,583 --> 01:55:26,211
about that god realm of yours?

1718
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,922
Well, actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

1719
01:55:29,005 --> 01:55:30,924
Spend some time
with the common folk.

1720
01:55:31,007 --> 01:55:32,509
Learn some about your world,

1721
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:35,053
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

1722
01:55:35,137 --> 01:55:36,763
Number one sign of wisdom:

1723
01:55:36,847 --> 01:55:38,640
Admitting there's always
more to learn.

1724
01:55:38,723 --> 01:55:39,975
I'm coming around to it.

1725
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:43,145
I got it.

1726
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:48,566
Whoa.

1727
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,652
Uh, guys?

1728
01:55:51,444 --> 01:55:52,445
Guys!

1729
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:00,954
It's the wizard.

1730
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,624
- Oh, my God!
- No way!

1731
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,334
- Yes.
- Look at this guy!

1732
01:56:06,418 --> 01:56:07,752
Look at him, he's so handsome.

1733
01:56:07,836 --> 01:56:09,171
You pimpin' now, what is this?

1734
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:10,881
- You look amazing.
- You look great!

1735
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,049
Well, I was in the neighborhood

1736
01:56:13,133 --> 01:56:14,718
and, um, I just wanted
to express

1737
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:17,137
my gratitude before I go.

1738
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:21,433
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.

1739
01:56:21,516 --> 01:56:22,976
Not everything.

1740
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:27,731
You were just
in the neighborhood?

1741
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:30,150
Okay, I came for the staff.

1742
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:32,194
Perhaps I will hold
onto it for now.

1743
01:56:32,277 --> 01:56:36,156
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

1744
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,949
before I turn into a pile
of ash.

1745
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:39,492
- Wait, what?
- No!

1746
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,578
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

1747
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:43,455
And besides...

1748
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:46,249
I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

1749
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:48,251
It's time to see your world.

1750
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:49,920
It's been an honor,

1751
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:52,589
a privilege,
watching you all soar.

1752
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:54,025
You know, you're not such
a bad wizard.

1753
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:55,425
Thank you, Jeff.

1754
01:56:55,508 --> 01:56:57,260
It never ends.

1755
01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:59,720
Also,

1756
01:57:01,181 --> 01:57:02,682
what's my superhero name?

1757
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:07,562
Your name is...

1758
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:10,482
Shazam.

1759
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:11,566
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1760
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:17,614
I still think we can beat it.

1761
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,483
My feet hurt.
How much further?

1762
01:59:58,566 --> 01:59:59,776
About ten seconds less

1763
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:01,361
than the last time you asked me.

1764
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:02,946
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

1765
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,280
have parked a little bit closer.

1766
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:05,524
He doesn't know we're coming,

1767
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:06,991
and I didn't want to spook him.

1768
02:00:07,075 --> 02:00:09,369
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

1769
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:10,829
All right, let's go.

1770
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:12,914
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

1771
02:00:12,997 --> 02:00:15,226
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

1772
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,709
we never actually met him

1773
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:19,170
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

1774
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:21,089
Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

1775
02:00:21,172 --> 02:00:23,049
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

1776
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:26,052
I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet. -Shut up.

1777
02:00:26,136 --> 02:00:29,139
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

1778
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,890
but a little immature.

1779
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:32,100
Oh, great.

1780
02:00:33,017 --> 02:00:35,520
Whoo!

1781
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:46,030
- Billy Batson.
- Yeah?

1782
02:00:46,114 --> 02:00:47,782
I mean, no.

1783
02:00:47,866 --> 02:00:49,451
I've never heard that name
in my life.

1784
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:50,928
I don't know who
you're talking about.

1785
02:00:50,952 --> 02:00:52,454
But I'd like to meet that person

1786
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:54,289
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

1787
02:00:54,372 --> 02:00:57,167
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

1788
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,710
but, like, in a dangerous way.

1789
02:00:58,793 --> 02:01:00,628
What the hell
are you talking about?

1790
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:02,797
Relax. We know who you are.

1791
02:01:02,881 --> 02:01:05,008
- How?
- Don't worry about that.

1792
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:07,093
Who are you guys?

1793
02:01:07,177 --> 02:01:08,470
Don't worry about that either.

1794
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:10,305
Look, we've seen
what you can do.

1795
02:01:10,388 --> 02:01:12,015
And we're here
to make you an offer.

1796
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:13,141
How would you like to join

1797
02:01:13,224 --> 02:01:14,350
- the Justice...
- Yes!

1798
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:15,852
A thousand times yes!

1799
02:01:15,935 --> 02:01:17,770
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

1800
02:01:17,854 --> 02:01:19,772
Well, I mean, not this exactly.

1801
02:01:19,856 --> 02:01:20,916
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

1802
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,108
in the dream, but...

1803
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,610
- Ew.
- Huh?

1804
02:01:23,693 --> 02:01:25,820
Well, that was easy.

1805
02:01:25,904 --> 02:01:27,405
Welcome to the Justice Society.

1806
02:01:27,489 --> 02:01:29,449
Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?

1807
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:30,783
The Justice Society?

1808
02:01:30,867 --> 02:01:32,261
Is that different
than the Justice League?

1809
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:33,912
Yes. The Justice Society

1810
02:01:33,995 --> 02:01:35,395
is different
than the Justice League

1811
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:37,207
because of how words work.

1812
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:39,167
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

1813
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,461
- So, that's you guys, right?
- No.

1814
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:43,463
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

1815
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:45,381
He's joking, right?

1816
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:48,718
- No?
- Okay. I'm out.

1817
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:50,762
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

1818
02:01:50,845 --> 02:01:52,805
Can you drive by and get me?

1819
02:01:52,889 --> 02:01:55,308
Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

1820
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:56,702
It's pretty confusing
that there are

1821
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,686
two separate groups
of superheroes

1822
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:00,230
that are totally unaffiliated,

1823
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:02,315
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

1824
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:04,502
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing a rebranding of sorts?

1825
02:02:04,526 --> 02:02:07,320
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,

1826
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:09,197
you got so many options, man.

1827
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:12,283
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

1828
02:02:12,367 --> 02:02:14,035
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

1829
02:02:14,118 --> 02:02:15,495
These are, like, legal terms.

1830
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:18,665
"The Avenger Society."

1831
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:21,668
I like that, for some reason.

1832
02:08:57,229 --> 02:09:01,233
Well, well,
Doctor. We meet again.

1833
02:09:01,317 --> 02:09:03,110
Where in the hell have you been?

1834
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:06,197
To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

1835
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:08,574
one must have patience.

1836
02:09:08,658 --> 02:09:10,076
What are you talking about?

1837
02:09:11,827 --> 02:09:13,663
It's been two goddamn years!

1838
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:18,626
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

1839
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:20,044
A meaningless measure.

1840
02:09:20,127 --> 02:09:22,713
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

1841
02:09:22,797 --> 02:09:26,008
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

1842
02:09:26,092 --> 02:09:28,010
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

1843
02:09:28,094 --> 02:09:30,554
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

1844
02:09:30,638 --> 02:09:33,265
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

1845
02:09:33,349 --> 02:09:36,102
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

1846
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:39,563
I just slither around endlessly.

1847
02:09:39,647 --> 02:09:42,066
But not for long.

1848
02:09:44,944 --> 02:09:46,570
Tell me everything.

1849
02:09:48,155 --> 02:09:50,199
Just one more thing
I need to do.

1850
02:09:50,282 --> 02:09:52,243
What? No!

1851
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:55,371
Oh, goddamn it!
