1
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,958
Black thorns and roses...

2
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,500
..smiles and tears.

3
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,166
They're sown together

4
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,125
and grow so near.

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,083
PANTING

6
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,916
Dima, wait!

7
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,708
SHE EXCLAIMS

8
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,166
-I win.
-All right.

9
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,458
Come. Let's go back.

10
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh, relax.

11
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,791
Sergey?

12
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,541
Sergey?
SHE CHUCKLES

13
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,916
Enjoy yourself for once.

14
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,458
One more time. Please.

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,583
Race you to the rocks.

16
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,250
OK, but you're
going to lose again. Ready?

17
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,583
VEHICLE APPROACHES

18
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,166
Luisa, quick.

19
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,875
Halt. Identify yourself.

20
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,125
GUN COCKS

21
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,333
Stop or I'll shoot.

22
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,041
Popov? It's Sidorov.

23
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,583
Sidorov?

24
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,083
You again.

25
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,250
Kurilka, 0900 hours.

26
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,708
Next time, I'll shoot you.

27
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,625
SPLASHING

28
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,375
Oh! Volodja.

29
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,125
Sergeant Popov's easy.
Two packs of cigarettes.

30
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,458
Life's about who you know.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,958
We can't all have
your connections.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
You could have my connections,
Luisa. You could have them all.

33
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,666
Oh! Oh, bloody rocks!

34
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,291
THEY GIGGLE

35
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,166
DISTANT SHOUTING

36
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,375
SHOUTING: Get up!

37
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,750
Fucking lazy rats.

38
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,125
Slow. Stupid.

39
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,875
Useless little rats.

40
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,458
OFFICER SHOUTS

41
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,291
Faster. Faster.

42
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,541
Attention.

43
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,625
At ease.

44
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,916
Comrade Colonel, second
squadron ready to manoeuvre.

45
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,375
You know, one day the colonel

46
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,041
is going to open his
flight reports

47
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,041
and find your
human-anatomy diagrams.

48
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,750
It's the hardest exam.

49
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,458
Then one more to go -
scientific communism.

50
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,333
I'm not going to have a life.

51
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,666
It'll be worth it in the end.

52
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,708
Let's do the morning report.

53
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,416
HE CLEARS THROAT

54
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,833
Selenov, 1:34.

55
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,708
TYPEWRITER CLACKS

56
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,291
Tokarev, 1:12

57
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,291
You won't reconsider
the colonel's offer?

58
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,125
Give me one good reason.

59
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,916
Two good reasons.

60
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,833
You could make
a career for yourself here,

61
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,208
rather than stack hay
in the middle of nowhere.

62
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,416
What else is there?

63
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,750
Sergey. Luisa. Wait.

64
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,833
Sergey, take our photograph,
for posterity.

65
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,958
Not again.

66
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,291
-I'm going to the canteen.
-Please.

67
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,625
Smile in this one.

68
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,791
Comrade Lieutenant.

69
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,125
We were ordered to take
this photograph

70
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,291
for the weekly journal.

71
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,416
At ease.

72
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,125
Let me take one of all of you.

73
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,375
Move to your right.

74
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,583
Which way to
the commander's office?

75
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,583
Comrade Lieutenant,
I'll show you.

76
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,166
Since the Nato forces increased
surveillance of our border,

77
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,625
I've got four Migs up in
the air around the clock.

78
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,333
We now assume each B-52
is carrying

79
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,291
several
thermonuclear devices.

80
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,083
Should just one slip through,

81
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:33,000
they will be on the direct
air corridor to Leningrad.

82
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:37,000
It will be your duty to prevent
this from happening.

83
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,458
Understood?

84
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,750
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

85
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,541
Welcome, Lieutenant Matvejev.

86
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,291
Dismissed.

87
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,791
Send him in.

88
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,708
So, young man,

89
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,666
I hear you have declined
my offer to stay on.

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,291
What are your plans?

91
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,416
I will return home to find
work, Comrade Colonel.

92
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,041
Very well.

93
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,916
Take the Uazik and drive
the lieutenant

94
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,375
to the officers' block.

95
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,291
You'll be receiving some
additional duties

96
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,958
in your final weeks.

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,166
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

98
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,875
PHONE RINGS

99
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,083
Orderly.

100
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,750
Yes, Comrade Major.

101
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,791
No, he has not returned.

102
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,916
I will report immediately,
Comrade Major.

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Here.

104
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,208
I'm afraid there are
no facilities

105
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,041
to develop photographs here,
Comrade Lieutenant.

106
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,416
Now there are.

107
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,791
You develop photographs too?

108
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,208
Yes, I do.

109
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll finish it myself.

110
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,208
Yes, Comrade Lieutenant.

111
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,666
Permission to leave?

112
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,583
Granted.

113
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,666
Private.

114
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,041
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant.

115
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,958
Matvejev.

116
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,750
Graduating with first-class
honours, eh?

117
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,416
Don't they say those who
do well at flight school

118
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,916
have problems handling their
equipment in the sky?

119
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,083
I was told that one particular
pilot here

120
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,541
has problems in
that department.

121
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,833
Time will tell.

122
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,666
Shit! Volkov is on duty
tonight.

123
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,291
He woke up the second
unit at 0300 hours

124
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,750
because he found a cigarette
butt outside their barracks.

125
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,250
He made them run 10km
into the forest, dig it a grave

126
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,583
and give it a full burial
with honours.

127
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,833
What a dick.

128
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,208
MUSIC PLAYS

129
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,291
What?

130
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,875
At least someone's
getting it tonight.

131
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,333
WINDOW OPENS

132
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,833
Hey, Matvejev.

133
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,666
Kissed my chances goodbye.

134
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,208
Now I see why she didn't
come swimming with us.

135
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,583
What's the matter with you?

136
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,125
I told you. "Like a sister"?

137
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,541
You are in love.

138
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,500
Sergey, do something about it.

139
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,041
Before it's too late.

140
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,541
The safety of the squadron
is paramount.

141
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,125
There will come a day when you
have to choose between

142
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,708
missing your target or
saving your wingman's life.

143
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,583
There's a fine line between
bravery and recklessness.

144
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,083
Tomorrow, we will proceed

145
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,083
with the high-altitude
attack scenario.

146
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,375
That is all.

147
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,875
DOOR OPENS

148
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,500
Private Serebrennikov?

149
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,166
Comrade Lieutenant.

150
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,166
At ease.

151
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,000
Is Luisa here?

152
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,833
No, she went to human
resources, Comrade Lieutenant.

153
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,958
That's fine.
I'll come by later.

154
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,791
Comrade Lieutenant...

155
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,500
permission to ask you
a question.

156
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,083
Would you have time to develop
some photographs later?

157
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,916
You're too soft.

158
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,833
Harder. Harder.
Not one spot left.

159
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,791
A love letter from another
admirer of yours.

160
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,958
It's been opened again.

161
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,458
Mm. Must be such a fun job,

162
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,625
reading all the thrilling
letters from your mother.

163
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,083
Come on. We're playing
durak in the Lenin room.

164
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,000
Sergey.

165
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,750
Get out of your fantasy world.

166
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,833
Maybe later.

167
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,625
NEARBY CHATTER

168
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,833
Take it by the corner...

169
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,041
..and gently...

170
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,583
..place it in the water tray.

171
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,208
Like this, Comrade Lieutenant?

172
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,375
That's better.

173
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,291
And call me Roman.

174
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,583
You...

175
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,541
really see other people,
Sergey.

176
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,791
You capture their essence,
their soul.

177
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,250
I search for
something deeper...

178
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,458
..but I can't quite grasp it.

179
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,416
How do you mean?

180
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,916
When you take a photo...

181
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,708
..there's something in
that very moment

182
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,208
which is gone forever.

183
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,541
A moment that will never
be there again.

184
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,416
Like a ghost
escaping this world.

185
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,625
I didn't know you were
a philosopher.

186
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,250
ROMAN CHUCKLES SOFTLY

187
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,666
I think we need a drink.

188
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,375
So I gave him a lower score.

189
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,250
The radio was practically
melting with his anger.

190
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,916
HE CHUCKLES

191
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,958
He was yelling and threatening
like I'd slept with his wife.

192
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,166
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

193
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,583
You know it?

194
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,000
Tchaikovsky.

195
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,208
When I first heard it,
I was 14.

196
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,625
My best friend Misha was in it.

197
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,250
I've never seen a real ballet.

198
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,541
How could you be
so uncultured coming from Orel?

199
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,125
SERGEY CHUCKLES SOFTLY

200
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,791
I've seen a lot of theatre
before being locked up here.

201
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,125
Now there's no chance.

202
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,416
Let's check the photos.

203
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,416
GLASS SMASHES

204
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,500
Steady there, Private.

205
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,750
I should be getting back.

206
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,041
I shouldn't even be here.

207
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,333
You'd better sleep it off here.

208
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,375
No, I-I can't...

209
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,875
I'll tell the duty officer that
I needed you at the hangar.

210
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,666
No, no, no. I have to go.

211
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,750
I can't stay.

212
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:40,041
Listen. If you turn up at
the barracks like this,

213
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,375
you'll be cleaning the toilets
for a week.

214
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,375
DISTANT SHOUTING

215
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,708
Oh, shit.

216
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,958
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

217
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,791
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

218
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,083
Put your fucking coat on!

219
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,791
Why can't you dress yourself
like any other pig here?

220
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,000
Lebedev.

221
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,250
Did I give you permission to
leave the barracks last night?

222
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,416
No, Comrade Sergeant.

223
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,791
Then why the fuck were
you smoking outside?

224
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,208
What's your problem?

225
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,333
Why the fuck are you staring at
me with those dewy wept eyes?

226
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,583
Are you a pervert?

227
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,708
No, Comrade Sergeant.

228
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,583
Then why the fuck do
you look like one?

229
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,833
What the fuck are you
smiling at?

230
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,208
Go fuck up the pervert.

231
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,708
Go fuck up the pervert.

232
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,583
Are you fucking deaf?

233
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,666
Go fuck up the pederast now!

234
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,208
HOOTER BLARES

235
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,166
To the stations.

236
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,000
PA: This is a combative
exercise.

237
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,375
BUZZER, DOOR OPENS

238
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,083
After I'm done
at the regional HQ,

239
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,625
I want to show you
something.

240
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,541
-What is it?
-You'll see.

241
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,666
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

242
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,833
MUSIC CONTINUES OVER SPEECH

243
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,291
You haven't said a word
since we left.

244
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,416
I hope it wasn't that bad.

245
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,250
No.

246
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,958
I loved it. I'm sorry.

247
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,541
Whenever I used to
watch a play

248
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,125
with my best friend Dima...

249
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,291
..I'd never want it to end.

250
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,541
Dima grew up without a mother
and me without a father.

251
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,583
It sort of created this
invisible bond between us.

252
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,166
We'd write secret letters to
each other

253
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,083
and sign them Valentin.

254
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,291
-Valentin?
-Zubkov.

255
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,750
The fighter pilot who
became an actor.

256
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,541
We wanted to be just like him.

257
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,958
We even promised we'd go to

258
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,083
the same drama school
in Moscow together.

259
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,250
What happened?

260
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,708
It was just a silly dream.

261
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,625
What will you do

262
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,291
after you leave the base?

263
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,625
Go back to the farm,

264
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,208
support my mother, find work.

265
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,166
Couldn't you support her even
better if you studied in Moscow

266
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,125
and got a job at Mosfilm?

267
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,458
I'd never get in.

268
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,166
How do you know?

269
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:50,041
Because they only take 20
people from across the country.

270
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,458
There are hundreds of
conscripts here

271
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,708
but the colonel chose you.

272
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:02,166
"It is not in the stars to hold
our destiny, but in ourselves."

273
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,375
Shakespeare.

274
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,166
Pull over.
This could take a while.

275
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,000
Look.

276
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,000
They're dancing with
each other.

277
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,791
Oh. Shit.

278
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,875
SERGEY SPITS AND COUGHS

279
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,750
That definitely wasn't
a blueberry.

280
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,541
Do you have a girl back home?

281
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,166
No.

282
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:55,958
Do you?

283
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,000
VEHICLE APPROACHES

284
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:04,083
Shit! Border guards.

285
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,750
GUARD SHOUTS

286
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,916
GUN COCKS

287
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,916
GUARD SHOUTS

288
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,333
ENGINE STARTS

289
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,541
VEHICLE PASSES

290
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,125
THUNDER RUMBLES

291
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,708
RAIN INTENSIFIES

292
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,708
What happened to you
last night?

293
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,333
I thought you were going to go
after her,

294
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,625
not ignore her even more.

295
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,458
I had to drive the lieutenant.

296
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,916
That late? We waited for you.

297
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,958
Luisa kept going on and on
about him,

298
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,708
so I told her to stop

299
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,375
and then she got mad at me
and went home.

300
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,875
Where did you drive him?

301
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,125
He went to the theatre.

302
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,333
And then?

303
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,416
Then we were delayed
coming back.

304
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,833
-What?
-Sergey, you've got that look.

305
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,583
No, really. I was on duty.

306
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,708
You've found another girl,
haven't you?

307
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,333
Tell me, who is she?

308
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,458
Swap, anyone?

309
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,083
Kolja, I'll swap with you.

310
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,750
Yes, Sergey.

311
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,333
Come on, Sergey.

312
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,833
-So, how is he?
-Who?

313
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,333
Lieutenant Matvejev.

314
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,375
Not like the other officers.

315
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,875
That's what I thought.

316
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,708
I have to drive him
to Tallinn this weekend.

317
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,458
What do you think?
Where should I take him?

318
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,875
Erm...

319
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,541
I could come and show
him around,

320
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,541
if Lieutenant Matvejev
doesn't mind.

321
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:18,833
Yeah?

322
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,250
-Yeah.
-Of course.

323
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,041
SOLDIER WHISTLES

324
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,625
Stalin is standing in this
field, a green field,

325
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:32,125
and there's this farmer nearby,
and Stalin...

326
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,291
No, the farmer...

327
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,541
If you insist on telling it,
at least do it properly.

328
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:36,666
Dick.

329
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:42,625
A farm worker greets Josef
Stalin at his potato farm.

330
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:45,375
"Comrade Stalin,
we have so many potatoes that,

331
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,708
"piled one on top of
the other

332
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,583
"they would reach
all the way to God,"

333
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,166
the farmer excitedly tells...

334
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,916
Go on, Private Serebrennikov.

335
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,625
Go on. I love a good joke.

336
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,208
Go on.

337
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,166
"But God does not exist,"
replies Stalin.

338
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,833
"Exactly," says the farmer.

339
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,416
"Neither do the potatoes."

340
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,000
HE CHUCKLES

341
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,041
"Neither do the potatoes."

342
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,291
That's a good one.

343
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,583
Follow me.

344
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,958
Telling jokes of that nature
could interfere greatly

345
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,958
with your future prospects.

346
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,500
We have immense responsibility
for how we affect society.

347
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,125
So I'd choose more carefully
which stories you tell.

348
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,250
This will never happen again,
Comrade Major.

349
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,333
I do hope so.

350
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,166
For your own sake.

351
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,750
One more thing.

352
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,041
According to
the orderly's logbook,

353
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:30,125
on your trip to Tallinn, you
returned the Uazik at 22:34.

354
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,291
What was the cause of
such a delay?

355
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,708
The lieutenant was attending
the theatre, Comrade Major.

356
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,500
We were delayed at
the crossing at Risti.

357
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,333
The gates were broken again.

358
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:47,250
I did everything I could to
return as quickly as possible.

359
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,291
Whom did he attend
the theatre with?

360
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,833
The lieutenant was alone,
Comrade Major.

361
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:01,875
I see.

362
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,583
You will report to me

363
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,166
if you notice anything
outside the ordinary.

364
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,208
Understood?

365
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,666
Yes, Comrade Major.

366
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,708
Dismissed.

367
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,166
And the Oleviste church

368
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,375
was the tallest building
in medieval Europe.

369
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,916
..that there is treasure buried
under Mary's chapel.

370
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,833
Sorry.

371
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,375
Thank you.

372
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,458
How do I look?

373
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,458

00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,791

Oh, thank you.

Would you like one?

378
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:40,958
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant.

And this, of course, is the
famous cobbled street

00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,916
where Lenin had his first
pair of boots made.

Which one of these handsome
men are you married to?

388
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,833
-Olga!
-Don't tell me.

389
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,541
This one's your husband, hm?

390
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,083
And this must be your brother.

391
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,500
Olga, these are my colleagues
from the base.

392
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,875
-Oh.
-Yeah.

393
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:14,916

394
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,416
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

395
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,250
-He's so sweet. It's your baby?
-Yes.

396
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,625

Will you help me with my lines?

00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,708
What lines?

418
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,000

You know you'll end up going
back to the farm.

00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,708
No, Luisa, I'm serious.

422
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,166
I sent my application.

423
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,458

Excellent.

-That is all.
-Not quite.

447
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,291
One more thing.

448
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,416
Lieutenant Matvejev,

449
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:48,916
are you familiar with Article
154A of the Criminal Code?

450
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:50,416
No, Comrade Major. I'm not.

451
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,708
Sexual relations of a man
with another man,

452
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,541
which is punishable by
five years' imprisonment

453
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,000
in a hard-labour camp.

454
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,708
I'm not following,
Comrade Major.

455
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:10,291
A report has been received
implying you have engaged in

456
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,166
immoral conduct
with a private.

457
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,291
This is malicious gossip.

458
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,708
Lieutenant Matvejev...

459
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,583
I wouldn't recommend
you interrupt me again.

460
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,666
There was no name of
the private in question.

461
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,583
Give me his name.

462
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,000
There is no name to give.

463
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,291
It is a lie.

464
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,416
I assure you, comrades.

465
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,083
Consider your words,
Lieutenant Matvejev.

466
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,291
Comrade Major...

467
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,208
..who wrote this?

468
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,416
It was delivered anonymously,
unsigned.

469
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:53,458
Without honour.

470
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,375
I trust the lieutenant's word.

471
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,500
Dismissed.

472
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,375

00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:05,458
Lieutenant.

474
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,250
It would be a pity.

475
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,875
So, when you buy
a brand-new Soviet car,

476
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,375
what do you get for free?

477
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,666
I have no idea.

478
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,208
Train and bus timetable.

479
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,833
I have a good one, too.

480
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,583
I have to go.

481
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,833

Listen to me and don't react.

484
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,833
Someone filed a report.

485
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,625
-About us.
-What?

486
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,291
They didn't mention your name
but...

487
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,000
But the KGB know something.

488
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,375

I repeat, this is a red alert.

494
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:28,000
This is not
a training exercise.

495
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,875
-Attention.
-At ease.

496
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:37,000
Comrade Colonel, we have four

00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,666
011 and 023 are escorting.

500
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,208
Rock. 011. 30 seconds
to the border.

501
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,000
Permission to engage?

502
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,583
011. Negative. Do not engage.

503
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,250
I repeat, do not engage.

504
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,375
Ten seconds to the border.

505
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,875
Rock. 011. Awaiting orders.

506
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:57,875
ALARM BLARES

507
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,125
Wait.

508
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,750
Targets diverting
90 degrees north.

509
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,708
011 and 023,
continue escorting.

510
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,666
Rock. 011. Engine malfunction.

511
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,041
011. Status report?

512
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,750
Power at 30, declining.

513
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,000
Cooling negative.

514
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,333
I've lost the engine.

515
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,500
Permission to abort.

516
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,875
All stations, we have
an emergency.

517
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,291
011, drop your weapons
and fuel tanks.

518
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,833
023, mark the coordinates.

519
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,291
Mark. 85km.

520
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,500
10,200.

521
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:36,208
That gives him
a range of 73km.

522
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,916
He'll crash
at least 10km short.

523
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:40,250
011, negative.

524
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:43,416
Proceed to eject
over the sea at 3,000.

525
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:46,125
I can save the plane.
I can fly it at stall speed.

526
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,583
Damn it, he's trying to land.

527
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,791
Matvejev, it's too risky.

528
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,833
I need you to return alive.

529
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,791
Eject. That's an order.

530
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,916
I do not copy.
Parachute negative.

531
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:58,250
Mark. Parachute negative.

532
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,583
Activate the stop net.

533
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:01,958
Duty mechanic to control.

534
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,416
BLEEPING

535
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,208
Duty mechanic to control.

536
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,208
Karamazin, Serebrennikov,
to the net. Go.

537
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,375
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

538
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,458
Come on. Come on.

539
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,208
-Come on!
-What is it?

540
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,708
Shit. The fuse is blown.

541
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,625
SIREN BLARES

542
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,083
The crank!

543
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,416
THEY GROAN

544
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,458
Damn it!

545
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,166
It won't move!

546
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,166
Rock. 011.

547
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,458
Airfield in sight.

548
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,750
Permission to land?

549
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,083
011, permission granted.

550
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,791
Try now!

551
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,875
Come on. Come on.

552
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,125
Faster.

553
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,791
It's going. Run!

554
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,416
SIREN BLARES

555
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,458
CONCERNED CHATTER

556
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,458
Faster. Faster. Get back to
your station, Private.

557
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:45,416
Serebrennikov, let's go.

558
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,833
You! You! You!
Get him out of there!

559
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,916
All clear, Lieutenant Matvejev.

560
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,375
You were very lucky today.
Get some rest.

561
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:47,041
DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN

562
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,375
Comrade Lieutenant?

563
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,000
Up here.

564
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:57,458
DOOR CLOSES

565
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,666
BANGING

566
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,250
THEY GIGGLE

567
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:07,625
MUSIC: June: Barcarolle
by Tchaikovsky

568
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,041
For you.

569
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:40,916
So you won't forget me.

570
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:53,541
We could get the training plane
and fly to Sweden.

571
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,833
Sweden?

572
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,625
Why Sweden?

573
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,416
I don't know.

574
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,500
I don't care...

575
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,416
..as long as we're together.

576
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,000
Sergey, I'm an officer.

577
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,833
I can't leave my motherland.

578
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:29,083
If you get into drama school...

579
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,416
..I'll find something to do
in Moscow, too.

580
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,291
And then we could go to the
cinema whenever we wanted.

581
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,583
And take a cruise on the river

582
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,833
and watch all the shows
at the Bolshoi.

583
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:54,416
And have an ice cream on Arbat,

584
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:57,125
and then throw up on
the American Mountains.

585
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:58,583
That's decided, then.

586
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:00,708
All right, then.

587
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,333
KNOCK AT DOOR

588
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,875
Comrade Major.

589
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:21,916
At ease.

590
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,083
Sounds like you're
having fun in here.

591
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:30,625
Just analysing my flight
report, Comrade Major.

592
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:36,916
Alone?

593
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,083
Yes, Comrade Major.

594
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:41,916
I see.

595
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,375
Where did you develop these?

596
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,333
Just personal photos,
Comrade Major.

597
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,000
Personal.

598
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:21,250
Matvejev...

599
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,791
..if there is the slightest
truth in that report...

600
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,458
..believe me, I will find out.

601
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,250
And nobody can protect you
then, not even Kuznetsov.

602
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:40,333
And I'll personally make sure
that you'll never fly again.

603
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:44,541
Goodnight.

604
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,333
You better
return to the barracks now.

605
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,875
Make sure nobody sees you.

606
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:25,458
Faster!

607
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,250
Move it!

608
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:29,666
Fucking rats.

609
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,208
Move it!

610
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,333
Won't have to listen to him
ever again.

611
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,375
One more day.

612
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:50,916
Good luck.

613
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:06,541
Comrade Lieutenant.

614
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,291
Vasja, wait here.

615
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:13,333
Colonel's orders.

616
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:14,458
Comrade Lieutenant?

617
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:18,250
Comrade Lieutenant?

618
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:19,625
What is it, Private?

619
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,291
I made a plan.

620
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,583
What plan?

621
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:23,916
For Moscow.

622
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:26,458
Get back to your station,
Private.

623
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,875
What?

624
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:29,583
-Last night...
-Listen...

625
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:32,000
Comrade Serebrennikov.

626
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,541
There was no last night.

627
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,583
Nothing ever happened
between us. Nothing.

628
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,750
Understand?

629
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,791
Moscow?

630
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:34,916
Moscow is where I'll be.

631
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,583
I'll hold you to that.

632
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,916
Vasja.

633
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,791
Sergey...

634
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:46,083
don't forget - write to me
after your auditions.

635
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,166
Of course.

636
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,708
Take care.

637
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,833
O, happy dagger.

638
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:45,958
This is thy sheath.

639
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,166
There rust,

640
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,291
and let me die.

641
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,916
LAUGHTER

642
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,750
Let's try again.

643
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,208
THEY IMITATE ANIMAL CRIES

644
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:13,041
If Juliet had just married
Paris, who's smart and wealthy,

645
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,250
the man of wax,

646
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,833
then this terrible tragedy
would never have happened.

647
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:19,208
That's love for convenience.
That's not true love.

648
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:22,500
Oh, really?
And how does true love behave?

649
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,041
You can't stop thinking about
the other person.

650
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,708
You have to be with them
no matter what.

651
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,458
But she could save
both their lives,

652
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,458
and they could still
meet up in secret.

653
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,125
And only live half a life?

654
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:35,333
Romeo doesn't just go
"I defy you stars"

655
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,583
to see her in secret.

656
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:39,250
Not when he's madly in love.

657
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:44,208
I've got to get to my class.

658
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,958
Wait. I'll walk with you.

659
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,625
Have you got time to go over
our scenes later?

660
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:53,250
We could practise at my place.

661
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:57,375
I can't tonight. I have to
practise my monologue.

662
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:01,625
Sergey, there you are.

663
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:02,666
Your friend is here.

664
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,416
I'll see you later.

665
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,791
MUSIC PLAYS

666
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,250
Luisa.

667
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,041
Ooh!

668
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,541
Look at you.

669
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:22,375
You've become so handsome.

670
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,833
All that time in the library.

671
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,916
-Oh.
-Oh, and edible food.

672
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,083
LUISA CHUCKLES

673
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,791
Your mother still looks
so young.

674
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:52,208
How is she?

675
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,291
Oh, she's... She's fine.

676
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,583
Anyway, you've heard
all my news.

677
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:00,833
How is medical school?

678
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:05,416
I deferred.

679
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,208
I'll go next autumn.

680
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,250
Why?

681
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:12,291
I'm still working
for the colonel.

682
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,333
The days are flying by.

683
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,125
Sergey, so much changed
after you left the base.

684
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:31,666
I needed to come and see you.

685
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:36,500
I don't want
anything to change between us.

686
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,375
Of course.

687
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:43,291
-Thanks.
-What is it?

688
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,166
I am to be married...

689
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:53,666
..to Roman.

690
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:00,791
R-Roman?

691
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,333
Well, that's...

692
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,333
You're sure?

693
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,708
Of course.

694
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,916
Of course I'm sure.

695
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,875
That's wonderful.

696
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,208
I'm truly happy for you.

697
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,333
For both of you.

698
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,500
I missed you so much.

699
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:38,125
You will come to our wedding,
won't you?

700
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,500
Sugar?

701
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,541
Yes.

702
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,958
LIVELY MUSIC PLAYS

703
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:25,708
A toast to Sergey.

704
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,166
We are all here today
thanks to you.

705
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,250
Na zdarovje.

706
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,708
-Na zdarovje.
-Na zdarovje.

707
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,333
One more?

708
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,958
SONG FINISHES

709
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,083
Hey-hey!

710
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,250
Gorko!

711
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:00,833
THEY CHANT: Gorko! Gorko!

712
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:04,333
Gorko! Gorko! Gorko!

713
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,875
GUESTS: Two, three, four,

714
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:12,583
five, six, seven!

715
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:15,083
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

716
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,958
Difficult thing to watch

717
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,583
the one you love
swept off their feet.

718
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:44,666
I see what goes on
under my nose.

719
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,291
It's no consolation now but...

720
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:54,958
if he'd never walked
onto my base,

721
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,416
I do believe...

722
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,375
..she would have married you.

723
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,208
Thank you, Comrade Colonel.

724
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,708
Excuse me.

725
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,666
DOOR CREAKS AND CLOSES

726
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:39,458
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

727
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,500
How have you been?

728
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:00,208
Fine.

729
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,166
How is drama school?

730
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,541
It's a lot better
than the base.

731
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:12,916
It's like another world.

732
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:17,458
Have you got a girl?

733
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:27,500
Do you love her?

734
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,083
Of course.

735
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,208
She's given up everything
for you.

736
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,708
I had to protect you.

737
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,875
From what?

738
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:39,583
You know what happens
to men like you.

739
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,791
Men...like me?

740
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:47,083
What are you, then?

741
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,208
I just married
the woman I love.

742
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,375
You really believe that
if you live a lie long enough

743
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,208
-it'll suddenly become true?
-Sergey...

744
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,250
you don't know anything
about me.

745
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,291
Wait.

746
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:02,416
Sergey.

747
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,958
GUESTS CHANT: Gorko! Gorko!
Gorko!

748
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,958
Gorko! Gorko! Gorko!

749
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,833
Gorko! Gorko!

750
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:10,875
I tried...

751
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,416
..so hard...

752
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:15,916
..to forget you.

753
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:19,458
But I can't.

754
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,416
-All these months, I...
-Sergey.

755
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,000
-...waited.
-Sergey.

756
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,250
I thought you'd come.

757
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:30,041
I couldn't.

758
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,125
What are you doing?

759
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,375
DOOR OPENS

760
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:04,416
Comrade Major.

761
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:17,666
Your wife is looking for you.

762
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,458
Thank you, Comrade Major.

763
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,750
I'll be right there.

764
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,791
I must go, Sergey.

765
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,625
We could still go
to Moscow together.

766
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,500
Nobody would have to know.

767
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,791
-Have that ice cream on Arbat.
-Sergey.

768
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:52,333
Luisa is...

769
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:55,166
..pregnant.

770
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,541
"You have sense enough",

771
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:17,250
said Father Zossima.

772
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,708
"Don't give way to drunkenness

773
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,916
"and incontinence of speech.

774
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:27,458
"Don't give way to sensual lust

775
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,916
"and to the love of money.

776
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:31,833
"And above all...

777
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,333
"don't lie."

778
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,250
"You mean about Diderot?"

779
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:39,291
"No, not about Diderot.

780
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:42,250
"Above all, don't lie
to yourself.

781
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,708
"The man who lies to himself...

782
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,833
"and listens to his own lie

783
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,125
"comes to the point

784
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,416
"that he cannot distinguish
the truth within him..."

785
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:53,541
Daddy!

786
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,333
"..or around him.

787
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:59,000
"And so loses all respect for
himself and for others.

788
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,000
"And having no respect...

789
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:04,333
"..he ceases to love."

790
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,750
LUISA: Dinner is ready.

791
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:37,208
It won't be a holiday.

792
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,500
I'll be doing long hours.

793
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,291
You'd be alone in the city
all day.

794
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:43,208
I think it would be
better for you to stay here.

795
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,875
But I don't want
to be stuck here.

796
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:47,250
And he'll miss his daddy.

797
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:49,458
You have your family here
to help you.

798
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,083
Just for a few months.

799
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,625
-Did you think about us?
-Yes.

800
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:53,666
And?

801
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,791
When I finish in Moscow,
they'll promote me.

802
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:58,083
And we can finally get
a bigger apartment.

803
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,583
Do I have a say in this?

804
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:05,791
It's for the best.

805
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,833
Have you seen my jumper?

806
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,000
Which one?

807
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:15,250
The grey winter one.

808
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,083
BOY: Why do you have to go?

809
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:22,541
Serjozha, I'll see you soon.

810
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,625
You are both mean.

811
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:27,916
Serjozha...

812
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:47,833
BANGING

813
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,500
-This one?
-Yes.

814
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:58,250
And that's why I love you.

815
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:06,000
I should just make it
to the train.

816
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,166
See you soon.

817
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,125
Prison, my lord?

818
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,166
Denmark's a prison.

819
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:43,625
Then is the world one?

820
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,333
A goodly one,

821
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:48,500
in which there are many
confines, wards,

822
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:51,708
dungeons.
Denmark being one of the worst.

823
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:55,833
We think not so, my lord.

824
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:58,416
Why, then, 'tis none to you,

825
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:00,125
for there is nothing either
good or bad

826
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,416
but thinking makes it so.

827
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:05,250
To me...

828
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:06,291
it is a prison.

829
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,750
I'm going to read all his
books during the break.

830
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,500
That better not be
all you'll be doing.

831
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:15,458
I'll make sure it won't be.

832
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,250
Or I'll throw his books
into the river again.

833
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:21,458
Sergey? You have a visitor.

834
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:36,291
What are you doing here?

835
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:41,166
I...came to see your play.

836
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:47,333
Did you like it?

837
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,375
The prince...

838
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:56,666
was very good.

839
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:01,916
Thank you.

840
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:17,333
Sergey...

841
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,583
I've been sorting out
my apartment,

842
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:23,708
so I have a week off
before I start at the academy.

843
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:28,041
Why are you telling me this?

844
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:30,458
Didn't you get my letter?

845
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:36,875
How's your wife...

846
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:38,000
and your child?

847
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,875
Come to Sochi with me.

848
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:43,583
I have two tickets.

849
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,875
For the 1800 train.

850
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:52,375
You think you can just turn up
here and I'll drop my life?

851
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:55,333
What was it -
could she not join you?

852
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:57,625
Sergey...

853
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,750
DOOR OPENS

854
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,833
I'll be right there, Ilya.

855
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,625
I've got to get back
to my friends.

856
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:20,291
Why do you think we use
the classics to teach you?

857
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:26,500
Because the characters
of these stories

858
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,583
are not intellectuals.

859
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:33,750
They are living, breathing...

860
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:36,666
..feeling beings...

861
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:41,458
..whom are tender,

862
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,333
with tremble...

863
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,958
..in their hearts.

864
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,708
And I want you to
catch this tremble

865
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,750
to your own heart and soul.

866
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,250
KNOCK AT DOOR

867
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,000
Tea?

868
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,208
PA: Train 505 for Sochi

869
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,958

He's still with that model?

875
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,125
Yeah.

876
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:17,458
And she came with him
to visit Luisa.

877
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:23,166
How is she?

878
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:27,333
Later, Sergey. Later.

879
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,458
Come on! Woohoo!

880
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:08,208
SERGEY PANTS

881
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,625
Roman?

882
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,166
I'm afraid of this dream.

883
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:37,458
Of waking up.

884
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,000
Of losing you.

885
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:45,458
I'm here now.

886
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:53,958
What is it?

887
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:59,791
You remember my best friend,
Dima?

888
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:08,125
On his 13th birthday...

889
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:11,666
..my mother made him
an apple pie.

890
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:16,125
He lived by the school.

891
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:21,833
I wanted him to have it
while it was still warm.

892
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,000
So I ran all the way.

893
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,041
When I arrived...

894
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:33,041
..I heard shouting from inside,

895
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,666
and so I went around
to the window.

896
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,291
My letters were
scattered all over the floor.

897
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:49,083
His father...

898
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,750
had him pinned to the table...

899
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:55,000
..beating him
across the back...

900
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:00,416
..yelling, "No son of mine
will be a fucking faggot."

901
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:07,333
I'll never forget his look...

902
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,041
..of disgust.

903
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,541
And then Dima looked up...

904
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
..and saw me.

905
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:27,583
And I ran away.

906
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,625
I ran away.

907
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,708
He didn't come to school
the next day.

908
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:52,125
There's a lake
in the forest near the village.

909
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,625
They found his body there
three days later.

910
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,250
I've never told this to anyone.

911
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:36,125
I have three rules here.

912
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,000
No vodka,

913
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,250
no parties with loud music,

914
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:41,500
and no girls.

915
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,708
After 11.

916
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,166
SERGEY: This place
is incredible.

917
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,000
Welcome home.

The sickle and the hammer.

921
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,875
First, it cuts off your legs

922
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:25,833
and then it smacks you
in the head.

923
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,500
-A drink?
-Need you ask?

924
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:29,291
Look at this place.

925
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:32,000
Fighter pilots certainly
make lots of money.

935
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:07,333
He'll play Hamlet or Uncle
Vanya the rest of his life.

936
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,416
-Yeah, you are right.
-Nothing wrong with that.

937
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,000
Matvejev. Fuel is running out.

938
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:13,666
Coming right up.

939
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:16,916
Sergey.

940
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,208
Sorry.

941
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,791
Who'd have thought it?

942
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:33,666
Actors and pilots
getting along so well.

943
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:35,375
I can't imagine it
any other way.

944
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:39,750
I knew it.

945
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:41,083
No.

946
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,250
Volodja.

947
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:49,750
-Volodja.
-Get the fuck away from me.

948
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:51,375
-Volodja.
-I knew it.

949
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,666
Zverev should have
investigated my report.

950
01:22:57,166 --> 01:22:58,333
You?

951
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:02,000
You could have got us
sent to prison.

952
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:04,125
How was I supposed to know
it was you?

953
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:08,083
Why would you do this to her?

954
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:10,208
You've ruined her life.

955
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,666
Volodja...

956
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:14,583
-We love each other.
-Stop.

957
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:15,958
Stop it.

958
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,708
-We love...
-Stop it. It is not love.

959
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:20,750
It's disgusting.

960
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:23,916
You make me sick.

961
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:26,916
Fuck this.

962
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,833
You won't tell anyone.

963
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,958
Not Luisa. Not anyone.

964
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:37,625
No.

965
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:39,000
That is your job.

966
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,625
You really think he's going to
leave her

967
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:45,541
and the air force...

968
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:46,666
for you?

969
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:56,833
More Soviet volunteers arrived
in Kabul this week

970
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:58,875
to liberate the people of
Afghanistan.

971
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:01,375
The Afghani children

972
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:05,041
welcomed the Soviet soldiers
with love and national dances.

973
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:06,916
Are you sure?

974
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,041
Yes, I'm sure.

975
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,583
He won't tell her.

976
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:11,916

Sergey, please - go and get
the rest of your stuff.

988
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:55,708
Roman, she can't come here.

989
01:26:00,291 --> 01:26:02,250
I can't tell her to go back.

990
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,916
Then take her to a hotel.

991
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,041
She's my wife.

992
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,958
You're an actor. Act...

993

..like you're just visiting.

994
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,083
I have to pretend every
fucking second of the day

995
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,791
I walk out the door.

996
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:17,833
I will not do it in our home.

997
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:19,416
Just tell her it's not working.

998
01:26:19,458 --> 01:26:21,208
And then what?

999
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,833
What then?

1000
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:25,166
You'll move in with me
at the base?

1001
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:49,958

01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,541
Yes.

1009
01:27:56,583 --> 01:27:58,541
This is Serjozha.

1010
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:00,166
-Hello.
-Hi, Serjozha.

1011
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:01,625
Hi.

1012
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,750
He's definitely got
Roman's eyes.

1013
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:04,875
-Hasn't he?
-Yes.

1014
01:28:04,916 --> 01:28:06,041
Yes.

1015
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:07,416
LUISA CHUCKLES

1016
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:09,125
How have you been?

1017
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:11,250
I was supposed to go to my
mother's for the holidays

1018
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:13,791
but when Roman said that
you were coming,

1019
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:15,333
I just had to stay and see you.

1020
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:19,250
You are always welcome in
our home and you know it.

1021
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:22,541
It's about time that you met
Serjozha too.

1022
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:23,875
Let's see.

1023
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:25,125
SHE GASPS

1024
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,375
Such a big flat. Come on.

1025
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:29,541
SHE EXCLAIMS

1026
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,416
When Roma has
his night flights,

1027
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,083
Serjozha sits by the window

1028
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:06,583
and stares into the night,
waiting for him to come home.

1029
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:07,666
Yeah.

1030
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:16,000
When Roma finishes here,

1031
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:17,916
I'll start my medical school.

1032
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:19,083
Mm.

1033
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,083
And he'll get a transfer.

1034
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:22,541
-Yes.
-Yes.

1035

LUISA CHUCKLES

1036
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:25,708
Of course.

1037
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,958
You have to be with
the ones you love.

1038
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,333
LUISA: Yes.

1039
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:35,916
Sergey...

1040
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:39,416
..is there anybody special
in your life?

1041
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:50,666
Him.

1042
01:29:54,041 --> 01:29:55,250
And you.

1043
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:01,791
And dear Serjozha.

1044
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:05,250
May you have all
the blessings of love.

1045
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:08,833
Nothing and...

1046
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:10,041
And no-one...

1047
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:13,708
..will ever replace you.

1048
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:17,125
To your love.

1049
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:21,000
To being with those
who you truly love.

1050
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:27,000
To your beautiful family.

1051
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:28,416
-Thank you, Sergey.
-Thank you.

You belong with your family.

1061
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,458
You always did.

1062
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,875
I won't be the one to take you
away from your son,

1063
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:40,958
and from Luisa.

-Luisa, let me explain.

-Leave me alone.
-Calm down.

-Get away from me.
-Luisa!

1067
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:55,208
I know now that our love
can only exist

1068
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:56,791
where there is no thought

1069

went home

When?

1084
01:33:03,541 --> 01:33:06,541
Last month,
just before he left Moscow.

1085
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:08,250
Oh, he gave me a letter
for you.

I'm sorry to disturb you.

Do you know how
I might reach Captain Matvejev?

1095
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,375
I must speak with him urgently.

KUZNETSOV SIGHS

1099
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:02,250
He left for Afghanistan
shortly after the New Year.

1100
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:06,583
He was assigned
to escort convoys

from the border
to the compound.

01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,375
Sergey, we lost him.

1104
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:21,333
No.

1105
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,875

By the time you receive
this letter,

1111
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:03,000
I will have left
for Afghanistan.

1112

gave me to consider

are coming to an end.

1114
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:13,375
But what is there to consider?

1115
01:35:14,666 --> 01:35:17,250
I can't choose for fear of
hurting those I love.

1116
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:21,416
I can't divide myself
any longer

1117
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:23,583

-Luisa, I wanted to...
-To what?

1124
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:34,458
To tell me that our friendship
meant nothing to you?

1125
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:41,000
To tell me that you were
sleeping with my husband?

I'm so sorry.

1127
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:51,166
Tell his son
that you are sorry.

1128
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,375
I don't want to hear it.

1129
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:57,250
Since you wanted
to sleep with him so badly...

1130
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:01,041
..why don't you go and lie
next to him in his grave?

Oh, of course -
you don't even know

where your true love is buried.

1133
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,625
Why would they have told you?

1134
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:11,250
You're not his widow.

1135
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:14,041
What were you to him?

1136
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,250
You were nothing.

1137
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:25,125
Then why did he move
to Moscow to be with me?

1138
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:26,416
Stop it.

1139
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:27,500
Stop it, Sergey.

and what I felt
was the same thing.

1144

My love...

..was no lesser than your love.

1146

You made my life a disgrace.

YOU made my life a disgrace.

1148

I trusted you my whole life.

1149
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:48,916
How could I have told you?

LUISA SOBS

How could I have told you?

1152
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,250
I married him.

1153
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:54,625

Hi, Serjozha.

01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:12,833
Did Daddy come back with you?

No.

We already talked about this.

But why?

1171
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:28,500
Because...

The sky.

Please...

1182
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:16,000
don't wait for me.

01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:18,666
Forget me.

1184
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,958
I shall always think of you,
Sergey.

1185
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,375
No matter what life may bring,

1186
01:40:29,416 --> 01:40:32,875
I will always be there
with you.
