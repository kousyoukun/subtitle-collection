1
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,522
我在138街的办公室里工作。
I was working in my office on 138th Street.

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,196
主要是治疗一战中受伤的人，比如我。
Mostly fixing up banged-up guys, like myself, from the Great War.

3
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,948
看到了吗?美丽。

4
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,660
所有的伤害都是世界乐于忘记的。
All from injuries the world was happy to forget.

5
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,081
修整面部，振奋精神，唱歌。
Fixing faces, lifting spirits, singing songs.

6
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,756
花生我的眼睛落在法国了。
Peanuts I left my eye in France.

7
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,887
我经常因为尝试研发新药而被医学委员会留校察看。
And I was constantly on probation with the medical board for trying to make new medicines.

8
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:43,103
我的意思是，我们需要当时还不存在的药物来度过痛苦和紧张的一天。
I mean, we needed medicines that didn't exist yet just to get through the day, with the pain and the nerves.

9
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,897
我希望这是一种更好的药。这就是我要说的。
I hope this is a better pill. That's all I'm saying.

10
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,024
我希望你是对的。
I hope you're right.

11
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,944
有些人比其他人做得更好。
Some worked better than others.

12
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,572
这是我今天的第二天。

14
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,369
维克多，你想尝尝吗?

是的。我下周会试试新的。
Yeah. I'll try the new one next week.

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,207
好吧。这会给你活力。
All right. That gives you zing.

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,336
把裤子穿上，伯特。我帮你修好了。
Put your pants on, Burt. I repaired 'em for you.

18
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,004
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

19
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,342
因为我在战争中受伤，我的背部有一个我讨厌的支架。
Because of my war injuries, I had a back brace I hated.

20
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,904
如果他们不把这地方关了他们就会把你关起来。
They're gonna put you away if they don't close this place down.

21
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,989
那没用，雪莉。
That's not helpful, Shirley.

22
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,848
实验医学。
Experimental medicine.

23
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,475
你看起来不错。
You look good.

24
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,827
-感染怎么样了?-好吧。

25
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,311
好，好，好，好，好。
Good, good, good, good, good.

26
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,520
我明白了。
And I got the message.

27
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,980
还不需要付钱。
No need to pay yet.

28
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,482
伯特，你有留言。

你父母打电话来了。他们不能去度假了。

30
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,320
赫伯·盖兹打电话来问滴耳液的事。
Herb Getz called about the ear drops.

31
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,782

And Harold Woodman called. Meet him at this address.

32
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,950
直接走进去。紧迫。

33
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,174
我和一个律师一起工作，他是我战时最好的朋友，哈罗德·伍德曼。
I worked with an attorney, my best friend from the war, Harold Woodman.

34
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,884

Hey, Burt.

35
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,428

我们有很多未付的账单。

人们依赖我们，依赖我们的生意。

40
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,480
最重要的是，它对你我都很有意义。

And you say it's great medicine for us to get together and sing. Don't you say that?

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,911
这是怎么回事?
Where's this going?

这是一个特定的程序，我知道你喜欢某些程序。

是的。他……他是。没关系。

他是被虫子咬了还是怎么了?

我来看看他。他在哪里?

I don't know what you're doing, and I don't wanna know what you're doing.

两小时后，防腐师就会来了。

78
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,008
发生了什么事?他本来要在晚会上讲话的。

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,595
你会帮我的，是吗?

我不相信他是自然死亡。

我家里没人同意我的看法。

92
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,413
这样的人怎么会死了?
How did a man like this end up dead?

93
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,817
你是说这很可疑?

是的，我告诉你这很可疑。

你愿意和我一起唱吗?
Will you please sing with me?

96
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,047
他说你打仗的时候经常和他一起唱歌。

All right. You have to do the autopsy, and immediately after, meet me at Minters Restaurant.

我要知道你找到了什么。
I need to know what you find.

102
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,577
她为什么说两个小时?
Why did she say two hours?

103
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,078
因为我们在殡仪馆。
Because we're in the mortician.

104
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,580
他们会让他下葬的。

明特餐厅，5点后。

你得把他弄出去。

我们该走了，伯特。

108
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,214
哈罗德?我不知道你在做什么。

莉兹，失陪一下。你好。

00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,567
我一个月至少做两次尸检。
I do at least two autopsies a month.

135
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,445
我这辈子做过两次尸检。
I've done two autopsies my whole life.

136
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:31,409
一个是为了证明我没有在某人的小肠上留下夹子，另一个是为了取下我留在某人小肠上的夹子。
One to prove I didn't leave a clamp on someone's small intestine, the other to remove a clamp I did leave on someone's small intestine.

137
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,995
现在我们知道你对小肠子很在行，伯特。
Now we know you're good with small intestines, Burt.

138
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,080
谢谢你！
Thank you.

139
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,251
你和伯特应该找个时间喝杯咖啡，厄玛。
You know, you and Burt should get coffee sometimes, Irma.

140
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,921
也许你和厄玛应该找个时间喝杯咖啡。
Maybe you and Irma should get coffee sometime.

141
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,214
我们是朋友，米尔顿。
We're friends, Milton.

142
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,426
你知道吗，厄玛，他妻子在家人面前都不替他说话。
You know, Irma, his wife wouldn't stand up for him to her family.

143
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,262
他们已经一年多没住在一起了。
They haven't lived together in over a year.

144
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,390
这就是我的情况。不是现在。
That is my situation. Not now.

145
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,808
我只想看到你快乐。
I just wanna see you happy.

146
00:07:54,891 --> 00:08:00,063
死人会让你意识到时间是短暂的，而爱是真实的，如果你知道它是什么的话。
Dead man makes you realize time is short and love is real, if you know what it is.

147
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,945
-这是怎么回事?——解剖。文书工作。
- What's going on here? - Autopsy. Paperwork.

148
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,242
警察正等着尸体运回停尸间。
The police are waiting for this body to return to the mortuary.

149
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,496
我们越早开始，他就越早出来。
The sooner we start, the sooner he's out.

150
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,165
这两个人必须马上离开。
These two men need to leave immediately.

151
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,501
他们是退伍军人。他们为国家服务。
They're veterans. They served their country.

152
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,585
去麦基餐厅等着。
Go wait at McGee's.

153
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,854
我们会在楼下麦基餐厅。
We'll be downstairs at McGee's.

154
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,046
麦基的。
At McGee's.

155
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,882
厄玛的葡萄牙语。这是不同的。
Irma's Portuguese. That's different.

156
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,057
我不知道你是葡萄牙人。
I didn't know you were Portuguese.

157
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,810
我不是。
I'm not.

158
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,521
你先来还是我先来?
Do you wanna start this or shall I?

159
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,733
只是有点激动，因为我认识他。
Uh, just emotional because I knew him.

160
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,303
如果你愿意，你可以签了这个。
You can just sign this if you want.

161
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,404
不不不不不。
No, no, no, no, no.

162
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,740
-这正是哈罗德需要的——我……我可以帮忙。
- That's what Harold needs. - I... I can help.

163
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,534
他是一个如此善良的人。
He was such a kind man.

164
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,872
好了。
There we go.

165
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,709
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

166
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,170
毫米。
Mm.

167
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,425
没问你过得怎么样。
Um, didn't ask how you were doing.

168
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,595
我的人走了。
My man left.

169
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,182
这种事每天都在发生。
This kind of thing happens every day.

170
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,559
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,894
它很好。
It's fine.

172
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,898
真爱是基于选择，而不是需求。
True love is based on choice, not need.

173
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,194
你需要你的妻子还是选择你的妻子?
Do you need your wife or do you choose your wife?

174
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,570
嗯，不能都是吗?
Well, can't it be both?

175
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,239
不。第二个才是真正重要的。
No. The second one is the one that truly matters.

176
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,033
在一天结束的时候，它是。
At the end of the day, it is.

177
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,368
选择比需求更重要。
Choice matters over need.

178
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,622
我不喜欢一个人。
I don't like to be alone.

179
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,873
啊。
Ah.

180
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,082
这听起来像是“需要”。
That sounds like "need."

181
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,753
我要切开它的胃。看那个。
I'm opening up the stomach. Look at that.

182
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,340
哦,是的。那是一种不同寻常的颜色。
Oh, yeah. That's an unusual color.

183
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,343
——……-是的。
- Something... - Yeah.

184
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,137
在一段时间内给他。
Given to him over a period of time.

185
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,097
——嗯。-很难说多久。
- Hmm. - It's hard to tell how long.

186
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,226
嗯。
Hmm.

187
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,936
他刚从欧洲回来。
He just got back from Europe.

188
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,731
我给他缝合，再取些血样。
I'll close him up and take more blood samples.

189
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,167
明天我会告诉你更多的消息。
I'll have more news for you tomorrow.

190
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,543
我想你还在原来的办公室吧?
I take it you're still at the same office?

191
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,568
是的。
Yeah.

192
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,826
哈罗德说你应该过上更好的生活，但你却放任自己堕落。
Harold says you deserve a better circumstance, but you allowed yourself to be corrupted.

193
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,911
他说你跟着错误的上帝回家了。
He says you followed the wrong God home.

194
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,789
什么?“腐败”?
What? "Corrupted"?

195
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,416
"跟随错误的上帝回家"?他怎么不跟我说?
"Followed the wrong God home"? Why doesn't he say that to me?

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,585
-这是什么意思?-我不知道。
- What does that even mean? - I don't know.

197
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,383
也许你花了热情和急迫，却不知道自己在浪费，直到为时已晚。
Maybe you spent enthusiasms and urgencies you didn't know you were wasting until it was too late.

198
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:38,054
当音乐结束的时候，你没有椅子，即使是在你自己的家里。
You ended up without a chair by the time the music ends, even in your own home.

199
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,015
我们需要这个房间。
We need this room.

200
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,184
太好了，我们都要走了。
That's perfect, 'cause we were just leaving.

201
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,688
莉兹说五点后在敏特见。
Liz said to meet her after 5:00 at Minters.

202
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,357
正确的。但我想和你谈谈厄玛。
Right. But I wanna talk to you about Irma.

203
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,236
我这么做的原因，伯特，是因为我想看到你幸福。
Oh, the reason I pushed that, Burt, is because I wanna see you happy.

204
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,404
我是你的朋友。
And I'm your friend.

205
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:59,200
我的朋友认为我被腐化了，却没有勇气和礼貌当面告诉我。
My friend who thinks I'm corrupted somehow, yet doesn't have the guts or decency to tell it to my face.

206
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,202
你不会想当面听的。
You don't wanna hear that to your face.

207
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,748
你给不让你住在自己公寓里的妻子买了花。
You've got flowers for your wife who won't let you live in your own apartment.

208
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,626
解释“败坏”一词的含义
Explain the word "corrupted"

209
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,337
或者“跟随错误的上帝回家”。
or the term "following the wrong God home."

210
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,755
是你公婆打来的，伯特。
It's your in-laws, Burt.

211
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,050
他们讨厌我们一起工作，更别说我们是朋友了。
They hate that we work together, let alone that we're friends.

212
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,821
我才不听他们说的那些公园大道废话。
Well, I don't listen to any of that Park Avenue garbage from them.

213
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,305
是的，你有。你有那么一点在乎。
Yes, you do. You care a little bit.

214
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,931
只需要一点点，伯特。
And all it takes is a little bit, Burt.

215
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,016
然后他们抓住了你。
Then they got you.

216
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,179
就像我捅那个德国人之前你在战争中留下的那滴血。
Like that drop of blood from the cut you got from the war before I stabbed that German.

217
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,441
那些伤口模糊了你的眼睛，你猜怎么着，你永远失去了这只眼睛。
Those cuts clouded your eye, and guess what, you lost the eye forever.

218
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,032
欢迎来到敏特，先生们。两人桌吗?
Welcome to Minters, gentlemen. Table for two?

219
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:44,662
我们要去见一个人…——嗯。-一个高个子女人，金发…——是的。——严肃的表情。
Uh, we're actually meeting someone... - Uh-huh. - a tall woman, blonde... - Yes. - serious face.

220
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,039
是的。这边请。
Yes. Right this way.

221
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,544
等待。她来过这里。我不知道发生了什么。
Wait. She was here. I don't know what happened.

222
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,005
她是…在这里。
She was... Right here.

223
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,816
-米金斯小姐。-她来了，伙计
- Miss Meekins. - There she goes, pal.

224
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,216
小姐……等待。Meekins小姐。
Miss... Wait. Miss Meekins.

225
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,054
Meekins小姐。Meekins小姐。
Miss Meekins. Miss Meekins.

226
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,597
我们照你说的做了。
We did what you asked.

227
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,766
我们发现了可疑的东西，和你想的一样。
We found something suspicious, just like you thought.

228
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,142
我做不到。我很抱歉。
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

229
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,355
什么……我和一个私人朋友谈过，他是……Voze先生。
What... I spoke to a personal friend, Mr... Mr. Voze.

230
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,357
他说我必须小心。
He said I have to be careful.

231
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,901
——谁?他吓到你了吗?-他说那很危险。
- Who? Did he scare you? - He said it was dangerous.

232
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,045
等待。米金斯小姐，等一下。
Wait. Miss Meekins, wait a second.

233
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,070
我只需要放下它。
I just need to drop it.

234
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,213
离开这条街。来吧。
Come off the street. Come on.

235
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,298
-你认识我父亲。-是的，是的。
- You knew my father. - Yes, yes.

236
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,382
-你认识我父亲。-是的。
- And you knew my father. - We did.

237
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,446
我们爱你的父亲。是的。
We loved your father. Yes.

238
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,802
你知道他常说什么吗，他常说你无法逃避恐惧。
And you know what he used to say is, he used to say you can't run from fear.

239
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,179
你不能让恐惧围着你转。
You can't let fear chase you around.

240
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:30,372
我知道我看起来很害怕，我不应该害怕因为沃兹先生，他只是在提醒我。
I know that I seem afraid, and I shouldn't be because Mr. Voze, he was just cautioning me.

241
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,460
他不是……他是好意。
He wasn't... He meant well.

242
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,670
他是我们家的朋友。
He's a friend of the family.

243
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,879
你发现了什么?
What did you find?

244
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,674
我们认为他可能被下毒了。
We believe that he might have been poisoned.

245
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,217
你知道为什么吗?
Do you know why?

246
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,700
有人在监视我吗?我不能……没关系。它……我不知道我能不能谈这个。
Is somebody watching me? I can't... It's okay. It... I don't know if I can talk about this.

247
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,976
结盟对他们有好处，他知道这一点。
They have interests in an alliance, and he knew that.

248
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,561
但他不会同意的。
But he wasn't gonna go along with it.

249
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,314
他知道些什么。他看到了可怕的东西。
He knew something. He saw something terrible.

250
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,732
他做到了。
He did.

251
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,526
他们知道他会说出去。
And they knew he was gonna tell.

252
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,860
告诉什么?他看到了什么?
Tell what? What did he see?

253
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,945
这是危险的。
It's dangerous.

254
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,615
我认为……Meekins小姐!
I think that... Miss Meekins!

255
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,158
我的天啊!Meekins小姐!
Oh, my God! Miss Meekins!

256
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,705
这两个，他们做到了。在这里。
These two, they did it. Right there.

257
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,540
-米金斯小姐!-她死了。
- Miss Meekins! - She's dead.

258
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,458
——噢!-他们做到了。
- Ow! - They did it.

259
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,602
-就在那儿。-你在撒谎!
- Right there. - You're lying!

260
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,687
这两个。他们所做的。
These two right there. They did.

261
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,771
这两个家伙。在这里。
These two guys. Right there.

262
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,855
不!你做到了!你推了她!
No! You did it! You pushed her!

263
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,357
-他们杀了那个女人-我看见你推她了!
- They killed that woman. - I saw you push her!

264
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,650
-他们杀了她!-我看见你了，先生!
- They killed her! - I saw you, sir!

265
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,675
-他们做到了。-我看到了。
- They did it. - I saw it.

266
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,218
我是律师。这是一位医生。
I'm an attorney. This is a doctor.

267
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
他们两个。我看见他们干的。
Them two. I saw 'em do it.

268
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,446
她雇了我们。这是我们的客户。
She hired us. This is our client.

269
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,531
看他手里拿的是什么。
Look what he's got in his hand.

270
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,390
-他拿了她的钱包!-他拿了她的钱包。
- He's got her purse! - He's got her purse.

271
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,742
你杀了她，还拿走了她的钱包!
You killed her and took her purse!

272
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,685
不。我看见你了。你推了她。
No. I saw you. You pushed her.

273
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:35,106
我是个律师……不，不，不!他的……下车!
I'm an attorney... No, no, no! He's... Get off!

274
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,108
公民逮捕!公民逮捕!
Citizen's arrest! Citizen's arrest!

275
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,110
我们要逮捕一个公民!
We'll make a citizen's arrest!

276
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,739
射他们!
Shoot 'em!

277
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,728
让他们!那两个，就在那儿!
Get them! Those two, right there!

278
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,950
停!
Stop!

279
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,035
停!
Stop!

280
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,872
懦夫!
Cowards!

281
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,334
那个可怜的女孩。哦,上帝。
That poor girl. Oh, God.

282
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,586
来吧。我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go.

283
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,795
在那些车后面!
Behind those cars!

284
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,242
-就是他。-你不能开车。
- That's the man. - You're not driving.

285
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,326
我开车。我们谈过了。
I'm driving. We talked about this.

286
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,727
-就是他。-保持条理。
- That's him. - Stay organized.

287
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,146
我们是一个组织。保持组织。
We're an organization. Stay organized.

288
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,230
他们逃不掉的。
They won't get away.

289
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,399
我们会在这里留意他们的。
We'll keep an eye out for 'em right here.

290
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,568
他们是怎么跟踪我们到这里的?
How the hell did they follow us over here?

291
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,534
加油！加油
Come on, come on.

292
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,037
天啊，这个支架。
God, this brace.

293
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,121
嘿,嘿!
Hey, hey!

294
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
嘿!
Hey!

295
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,169
我觉得他们还在监视我们。
I think they're still watching us.

296
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,754
你认为呢?
You think?

297
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,672
我想是的。
I think so.

298
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,593
天呐这是什么鬼东西?
Holy shit. What fresh hell is this?

299
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:50,139
如果不是很久以前的事，你是不可能来到这里的。
You don't get here without things starting a long time ago.

300
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,816
你想让我去我们最喜欢的树那儿……
You want me to go to our favorite tree...

301
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:09,700
在阿贡森林里把人炸飞
and get bark in the Argonne Forest where they are blowing people up?

302
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,537
这将是光荣的，光荣的。
It will be honorable, glorious.

303
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,621
对家庭有好处。
Good for the family.

304
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,669
但它……很好，伯特。很好。
But it... it's good, Burt. It's good.

305
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,048
当你获得更多的奖牌时，你会更适应这里。
You'll fit in better when you have more medals.

306
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,800
你会和公园大道很合得来的。
You'll fit in on Park Avenue.

307
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,344
人们尊重服兵役。
People respect military service.

308
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,887
我可能会被杀死。
I could be killed.

309
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,931
我们不能那样想。
We cannot think that way.

310
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,391
你当然不会被杀。
Of course you won't be killed.

311
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,311
啊,比阿特丽斯。
Ah, Beatrice.

312
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:44,443
我大老远跑到这儿来可不是为了像条狗一样被人唠嗑的。
I didn't come all the way over here to be talked to like a damn dog.

313
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,154
这是违反国旗的罪行。
It's a crime against the flag.

314
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:52,326
我不认为他们有能力拥有对制服的钦佩和信心。
I don't think they have the ability to possess the admiration or the confidence to wear the uniform.

315
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,578
我们在说谁?
Who are we talking about?

316
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,665
有谁敢挡我的路，我就从背后开枪。
One of these crackers get in my way, I'mma shoot 'em in the back.

317
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,042
我们知道你更喜欢这个。
Well, we know you even like this even more.

318
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,919
我不想再和你说话了。
I was done talking to you.

319
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,363
你永远都不会放过我的。
You'll never be done talking to me.

320
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,422
够了，中士。
That's enough, Sergeant.

321
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,674
是的，长官，米金斯将军。
Yes, sir, General Meekins.

322
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,237
你不用再掺和进来了。
You don't need to be involved anymore.

323
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,385
态度是没用的。
Attitude doesn't help.

324
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,919
所以我才想让你来当医官，伯恩斯坦。
That's why I wanted to bring you on as a medical officer, Bernstein.

325
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,515
Berendsen,先生。
Berendsen, sir.

326
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,559
我很抱歉。我是伍德曼先生。
I'm sorry. This is Mr. Woodman.

327
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,371
这里出了点状况，我想你也许能帮上忙。
Got a situation here that I thought you might be able to help with.

328
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,855
什么情况，先生?
What situation, sir?

329
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,816
伍德曼先生，你为什么不告诉他你为什么在寨子里。
Mr. Woodman, why don't you tell him why you're here in the stockade.

330
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,526
我们为什么在寨子里?
Why are we in a stockade?

331
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,028
不服从。
Insubordination.

332
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,487
你不听话吗?
Were you insubordinate?

333
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,864
——是的。——为什么?
- Yes. - Why?

334
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,909
他们给了我们像那个白痴一样的黑人警察。
They gave us Jim Crow officers like that knucklehead.

335
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,996
但我们拒绝继续，除非他们找到合适的人代替他。
But we refuse to continue till they've replaced him with somebody good.

336
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,706
找个体面又尊重人的人。
Someone decent and respectful.

337
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,417
那是我吗，长官?
Is that supposed to be me, sir?

338
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,919
那就是你，伯伦森。
That is you, Berendsen.

339
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:50,593
我的意思是，你在这种巨大压力下遇到的人与你的生活息息相关。
I mean, the people you meet in these circumstances of tremendous stress are bonded to you for life.

340
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,865
你是那种会让我失血过多然后我不得不从背后开枪的医生吗?
Are you the kind of doctor that's gonna leave me bleeding out and I'll have to shoot in the back?

341
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:00,603
因为让我告诉你，他们手下的警官，他们不在乎我们的死活。
Because let me tell you, the officers that they had, they didn't care whether we lived or died.

342
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,982
我不会让任何人失血过多而死，我也不想背后挨一枪。
I am not gonna let anybody bleed out, and I do not wanna get shot in the back.

343
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,068
我是埃尔米拉一个机械师的儿子。
I am the son of a mechanic from Elmira.

344
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,152
我结婚了。
I am married.

345
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,654
我一半是天主教徒，一半是犹太人。
I'm half Catholic, half Jewish.

346
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,490
我是医生。我在公园大道有个诊所。
I'm a doctor. I have a practice on Park Avenue.

347
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,576
我觉得我的公婆派我来是为了赶我走。
And I think that my in-laws sent me here to get rid of me.

348
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:23,459
听起来不错，除了…姻亲的关系，但也许这就是我可以信任你的原因。
Well, that all sounds pretty good, except that... in-laws part, but maybe that's why I can trust you.

349
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,382
所以，我们要做个约定。
So, we'll make a pact.

350
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,636
你要确保我们不会死。
You see to it that we won't die.

351
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:38,015
我保证你不会被杀。
And I'll make sure you won't get killed.

352
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,602
我们会互相照顾的。
We'll look out for each other.

353
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,605
哈罗德·塞迪斯·伍德曼。
Harold Thaddeus Woodman.

354
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,274
伯特伦Berendsen。
Bertram Berendsen.

355
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,526
-欢迎来到369。-谢谢。
- Welcome to the 369. - Thank you.

356
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,462
这就是我一直在寻找的。
Finally, that's what I've been looking for.

357
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,487
只是尊重一下。
Just some respect.

358
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,657
现在我们去解决这个不幸的制服问题吧。
Now let's go deal with this unfortunate uniform situation.

359
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,618
是啊，我们去处理制服的事吧。
Yeah, let's go deal with this uniform shit.

360
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,745
欢迎加入我的军队。
Welcome to my army.

361
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,706
我们为什么要穿法国制服?
Why are we wearing French uniforms?

362
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,710
美国士兵，他们不想被看到和我们在一起。
The American soldiers, they don't wanna be seen with us.

363
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:11,048
这是可耻的。我以善良和团结的精神奋斗创建了这个团。
It's disgraceful. I fought to create this regiment in the spirit of kindness and unity.

364
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,302
希望在阿贡河的另一边见到你。
Hope to see you on the other side of the Argonne in good shape.

365
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,469
愿上帝与你同在。
God be with you.

366
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,811
我救了哈罗德。
I saved Harold.

367
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,396
他救了我。
He saved me.

368
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,858
有个法国女人救了我们俩。
And there was this French lady saving both of us.

369
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,834
把剩下的给我……不要把它扔掉。
Give me the rest... Do not throw that away.

370
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,978
你为什么要留着它?
Why do you want to keep it?

371
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,003
这是不卫生的。
It's unsanitary.

372
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,166
这不关你的事。
It's none of your business.

373
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,732
Et vous ne portez pas de bonnet en plus!
Et vous ne portez pas de bonnet en plus!

374
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,191
——评论?- Vous ne portez pas de bonnet!
- Comment? - Vous ne portez pas de bonnet!

375
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,300
滚出去!
Get out of here!

376
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,469
滚出去。
Get out of here.

377
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,595
哦啦啦!
Oh la la!

378
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,280
Croyez-moi。
Croyez-moi.

379
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,666
停止这种暴行!
Stop this atrocity!

380
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,505
不雅…犯罪……你是在亵渎……留着这该死的金属!
It's indecent... criminal... and you are blaspheming... by keeping this bloody metal!

381
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,215
-她在亵渎神明?——是的。
- She's blaspheming? - Oui.

382
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,424
我亵渎?
I'm blaspheming?

383
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,592
是的。
Oui.

384
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,512
那金属进去的时候很恶心。
The metal was obscene when it went in.

385
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,473
我把它取出来的时候再兑换。
I redeem it when I take it out.

386
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,892
你宁愿把一切都隐藏起来。
You prefer to keep it all hidden.

387
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,122
它侮辱了上帝……还有死者和伤者的家属。
It insults God... and the families of the dead and the wounded.

388
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,606
不，她说得对。
No, she's right.

389
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,650
不，她说得对。
No, she's right.

390
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,734
谢谢。
Merci.

391
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,694
她可以留着这该死的金属。
She can keep this bloody metal.

392
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,113
——什么?——谢谢。
- Quoi? - Merci.

393
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,656
是的，是的，是的。
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,199
-她说得对。-看到了吗?
- She's right. - You see?

395
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,343
- Vous voyez!好了。——好。
- Vous voyez! Allez. - Allez.

396
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,868
世界万岁!世界万岁!
Tout le monde! Tout le monde!

397
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,161
杜calme !杜calme !

398
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,454
放轻松，哈罗德。

这是有理由的!你们看到!

400
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,748
你们看到!好了。好了。

401
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,543
你好大的胆子!

402
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,919
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

403
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,797
Ca suffit。
Ça suffit.

404
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,549
我不知道发生了什么事。
I don't know what is happening.

405
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,051
Liberté pour nous tous。Arrêtez de mentir!
Liberté pour nous tous. Arrêtez de mentir!

406
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:23,055
Liberté pour nous tous。Arrêtez de mentir!
Liberté pour nous tous. Arrêtez de mentir!

407
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,974
“自由……
Liberté...

408
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,187
伍德曼先生，我想我应该感谢你。
Mr. Woodman, I believe I owe you my gratitude.

409
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,981
哦，你会说英语?
Oh, you speak English?

410
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,191
——是的。-我以为你是法国人。
- Yes. - I thought you were French.

411
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,609
我是瓦莱丽·班登伯格。

412
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,405
-你不是法国人?——没有。

413
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,991
我可以请你喝一杯吗?
May I buy you a drink?

414
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,410
是的。我们……我们可以在这里做吗?
Yes. We... We can do that here?

415
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,787
-我可以。-我们可以…我们可以在这里喝酒吗?
- I can. - We can... We can drink here?

416
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:47,872
哈罗德!
Harold!

417
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,124
-你到底在干什么?-年轻人!
- What the hell are you doing? - Young man!

418
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,208
你要去哪里?
Where you goin'?

419
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,710
他和我在一起很安全。
Oh, he's in safe hands with me.

420
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,798
如果那些密西西比的家伙现在能看到你…协议怎么了?
If those Mississippi crackers could see you now... What happened to the pact?

421
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,134
我在这里失去了一只眼睛。
I lost an eye here.

422
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,065
抽烟斗的女人抽烟斗的女人
A woman who smokes a pipe.

423
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,236
你害怕吗?
Are you intimidated?

424
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,447
现在有一点。
A little bit right now.

425
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:37,338
当你看到一个人，你真的看到了他们，你看到的是曾经的他们。
When you see someone, and you really see them, you see the kid that used to be them.

426
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,259
你看到了他们脆弱的一面。
You see the part of them that's vulnerable.

427
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,640
哈罗德和我从一开始就有这种感觉。
Harold and I had that kind of seeing each other right from the start.

428
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,727
既然战争已经结束了…
Well, now that the war is over...

429
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,982
我只想做一个真正的人。你知道吗?
I just want to be a person. You know?

430
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:01,153
我只想自由自在地四处走走……毫米。
I just want to walk around - free... - Mm.

431
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:05,908
作为一个人。只是…过我自己的生活。
As a person. Just... Just living my life.

432
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,160
这里是欧洲。
Here in Europe.

433
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,205
这就是问题所在。活下去，自由自在。
That's the ticket. Just live and be free.

434
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,958
我强烈推荐它。我已经走遍了欧洲。
I highly recommend it. I've walked around Europe.

435
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,835
它给我带来了奇迹。
It's done wonders for me.

436
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:22,049
不用多说，她就能看穿你的灵魂。
Without even too many words, I mean, she's looking right into your soul.

437
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,552
是啊，你穿得很好。
Yeah, you wear it well.

438
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,640
我们的生命在上帝面前岌岌可危。在这里。
Both our lives were in the balance before God. Right there.

439
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,313
我能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you something?

440
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,773
毫米。
Mm.

441
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,735
你怎么处理从我们身上取出的血淋淋的弹片?
What do you do with the bloody shrapnel that you take from our bodies?

442
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,029
我不能白给你。
I can't give you that for nothing.

443
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,240
你得跟我换一样东西。
You have to trade me something.

444
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,866
这不是免费的。
You don't get that for free.

445
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,702
贸易吗?
Trade you?

446
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,496
好的。多少钱?
Okay. What does it cost?

447
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,999
美丽的东西。
Something beautiful.

448
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,793
活着的意义。
Something to live for.

449
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,838
我现在正看着呢。
I'm looking at that right now.

450
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,181
我已经把我身上的金属弹片给你了。
I already gave you pieces of metal shrapnel from my body.

451
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,394
其实，我从你朋友的身体里提取了更多的金属。
You know, actually, I took a lot more metal from your friend's body.

452
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,313
他叫什么名字?
What's his name?

453
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,732
他叫伯特·伯伦森。
His name is Burt Berendsen.

454
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,816
哦,男孩。
Oh, boy.

455
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:27,031
他一瘸一拐地走着，想起了一段友谊的约定。
And he is hobbling along here, remembering something about a friendship pact.

456
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,450
你还记得吗?还记得我吗?我在这里。
Do you remember that? Remember me? Here I am.

457
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,635
-很高兴见到你，伯特- - - - - -你好。
- Good to see you, Burt. - Hello.

458
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,077
对不起，伯特·伯伦森。
My apologies, Burt Berendsen.

459
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,664
我倒两杯的时候再也不会少了第三杯了。
Never again shall I pour two without a third.

460
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:42,463
伯特，你得帮帮我…-很好。-用美好的东西交换，作为回报，她会向我们展示她如何处理她从我们身体上取下的金属。
Hey, Burt, you gotta help me... - Very good. - trade something beautiful, and in return, she's gonna show us what she does with all the metal she took from our bodies.

461
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,673
她叫瓦莱丽。
Her name is Valerie.

462
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,800
你怎么处理那些弹片，瓦莱丽?
What do you do with all that shrapnel, Valerie?

463
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,845
如果你想知道，你得跟我换一样东西。
If you want to know, you have to trade me something.

464
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,728
-她也是这么说的。-我什么都没有。
- She told me the same thing. - I got nothing.

465
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,057
无意义的歌。
Nonsense song.

466
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,768
这是个好主意。怎么样?
That's a good idea. How about that?

467
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,228
什么是废话歌?
What's a nonsense song?

468
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,106
好吧。
All right.

469
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,444
红色的太阳。
The red sun.

470
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,031
嗯…一些柚子。
Um... Some grapefruit.

471
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,824
他的手帕。
The handkerchief.

472
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:24,088
红日……一些柚子…手帕……当你打电话的时候。
The red sun... some grapefruit... the handkerchief... when you call.

473
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:31,470
看到一张脸…谁的?
To see a face... whose?

474
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:36,975
我的名字……我自己的名字。
My name... my own name.

475
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:42,815
它是生动的，那一刻……去爱，才会存在。
It's vivid, the moment... to love, to be.

476
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,899
你说对了。
You got it.

477
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:50,447
海滩很温暖……天空很冷……死亡是真实的…当我们奄奄一息的时候。
The beach is warm... The sky is cold... Death is real... when we're dying.

478
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:58,455
但是天空……有了朋友是温暖的。
But the sky... is warm with friends.

479
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,966
我从人的身体里取出过这些东西。
I've taken all these pieces out of people's bodies.

480
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,635
看。这个东西更原始。
Look. This is more primitive, this stuff.

481
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,595
看，我要开一个茶话会。
Look, I'm having a tea party.

482
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,391
这是用火药做的。和弹片。
This is made out of gun powder. And shrapnel.

483
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,893
文明的高度。
The height of civilization.

484
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,818
欢迎来到我的世界。
Welcome to my world.

485
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,903
哦，我在化妆。
Oh, I'm doing my makeup.

486
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,613
我只有半张脸吗?
Oh, do I only have half a face?

487
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,865
这是怎么发生的?
How did that happen?

488
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,658
只要我有口红就行。
As long as I have my lipstick.

489
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,536
漂亮。
Pretty.

490
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,122
你得知道你喜欢什么。
You got to know what you love.

491
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:48,338
你得从生活中得到真正的乐趣，否则，如果你任其发展，会有太多该死的麻烦从头到尾地破坏这种生活的乐趣。
And you got to get a real kick out of it, or there's too much damn trouble in it to spoil this affair of living from beginning to end, if you let it.

492
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:53,886
为什么不为美好的事物而活，即使你有点穷?
Why not live it for the beautiful things, even if you were a bit broke?

493
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:01,578
我的比阿特丽斯会怎么想我眼睛不见了的事，还有我背上的伤疤，还有所有的一切?
What will my Beatrice think about the missing eye business, and the scars, and the scars on my back and everything?

494
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,145
我们能做点什么吗，瓦莱丽?
Can we do anything about that, Valerie?

495
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,898
我认识阿姆斯特丹一家医院的捐助者。
I know benefactors in a hospital in Amsterdam.

496
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,108
它们会给你一个新的眼睛。
They'll give you a new eye.

497
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,193
阿姆斯特丹吗?
Amsterdam?

498
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,590
几年前我刚去法国的时候，情况要困难一些。
When I was first going through France a couple of years ago, okay, things were a little more difficult.

499
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,615
我不得不捅了一个人。
I had to stab a guy.

500
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,050
有一次我拿砖头砸了一位女士。
I had to hit a lady with a brick one time.

501
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,075
什么?
What?

502
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,428
——哇。-是啊，说来话长
- Wow. - Yeah, it's a long story.

503
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,662
但有你俩，就小菜一碟了。
But with you two, it will be a cakewalk.

504
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,291
再说了，我现在伪造文件的技术好多了。
And besides, I'm far better at forging documents now.

505
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,336
来吧，伯特。我们去阿姆斯特丹吧。
Come on, Burt. Let's go to Amsterdam.

506
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,420
好的。
Okay.

507
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,465
-谢谢我frères。——勇气!
- Merci mes frères. - Courage!

508
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,426
我是阿姆斯特丹的移交官。
Nous avons I'ordre officiel de transfert pour Amsterdam.

509
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,637

510
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
-谢谢，夫人。- Mais attendez!

511
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,115
Mais qu'est-ce que vous faites?
Mais qu'est-ce que vous faites?

512
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,017
但是…但是…各位先生美女…但是…你们rigolez ?
Mais... Mais... Messieurs dames... Mais... vous rigolez?

513
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,536
是的，是的，夫人。这是très重要的。
Oui, oui Madame. C'est très important.

514
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,978
Mais Madame remettez les clés。
Mais Madame remettez les clés.

515
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,063
谢谢。
Merci.

516
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,155
-你好，我的朋友们。——啊!
- Bonjour mes amis. - Ah!

517
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,366
-你好。-你好。弗吉尼亚州吗?

520
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,831
伦敦,英格兰。
London, England.

521
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:13,507
我们制造最好的假体玻璃，工业玻璃，绝密玻璃，军事玻璃，除了窗户玻璃，所有的玻璃…当然，除非它是防弹的。
We make the finest prosthetic glass, industrial glass, top-secret glass, military glass, every kind of glass except window glass... Unless, of course, it's bulletproof.

522
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:21,557
不要害怕。瓦莱丽小姐的朋友是保罗·坎特伯雷的朋友，他会为你提供终生的坎特伯雷玻璃眼睛。
Have no fear. A friend of Miss Valerie is a friend of Paul Canterbury, who offers you a lifetime supply of Canterbury glass eyes.

523
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,058
还不错。
Not too bad.

524
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,828
如你所见，我也受了同样的伤。
As you can see, I've got the same injury as you.

525
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:29,189
或者你看不见是因为坎特伯雷玻璃的精细工艺。
Or perhaps you can't see due to the fine craftsmanship of Canterbury Glass.

526
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:36,154
让我看看。我相信你是一个……是的，深褐色的。我说的对吗，先生?
Let me see. I believe you are a... Yes, a dark hazel-green. Am I correct, sir?

527
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,364
你是正确的。
You're correct.

528
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,992
万岁。这是我的美国同事，亨利·诺克罗斯。
Huzzah. This is my American colleague, Henry Norcross.

529
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,788
你好!多年来我们一直是瓦莱丽家族的国际生意朋友。
How do you do? We've been friends of Valerie's family through international business for many years.

530
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:49,751
我们在她的冒险之旅中保护了她的安全，作为回报，她也为造福世界做出了贡献。
We've kept her safe on her adventure, and in return, she's helped serve the good of the world.

531
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,546
她到底是怎么做到的?
How did she do that exactly?

532
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:58,778
通过参加各种晚宴和活动，告诉我们她对银行和军队调动的了解，等等。
By attending various dinners and functions, and telling us what she's learned about banks and troop movement, so on and so forth.

533
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,721
啊哈。你是间谍。
Uh-huh. You're spies.

534
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,764
不。没有,先生。
No. No, sir.

535
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:07,060
他在一家玻璃公司工作，而我在财政部工作。
He, uh, works for a glass company, and I work for the Department of the Treasury.

536
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,732
他们是老朋友了。
They're old friends.

537
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,859
他们帮过我，我也帮过他们。
They've helped me out, and I've helped them out.

538
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,222
现在我想他们会帮你的。
Now I think they'll help you out.

539
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,882
就连保罗和我也抽出时间来这里观鸟。
Even Paul and I have found some time to do a little birding here.

540
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,907
我们是狂热的观鸟者。
We're avid birders.

541
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,050
是的。这真的是一种精妙的爱好。
Yes. It's an exquisite hobby, really.

542
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,075
是的。
Yes.

543
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,953
这是非洲灰冠鹤。
This is, uh, the African gray crowned crane.

544
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,038
是的。
Yep.

545
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,707
它们已经灭绝了。
These are extinct.

546
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,375
是的，我们有后两种。
Yes, we have the last two.

547
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,628
尼克巴，鸽子。
The Nicobar, uh, pigeon.

548
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,712
是的。
Yes.

549
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,505
他们一度还活着。
They were alive at one point.

550
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,466
这是北美野鸡。
And this is the North American pheasant.

551
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,386
这是一只北美野鸡，我喜欢称它为野鸡中的农民。
It's a North American pheasant, which I like to call the peasant of pheasants.

552
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,930
你看，它们太常见了。
They're so common, you see.

553
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,848
-但是它们很漂亮。——是的。
- But they are beautiful. - Yes.

554
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,642
它的羽毛真漂亮。
The plumage is really outstanding.

555
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:54,066
所以，你知道，我们很乐意为你的脸付钱，不管你需要什么整容治疗，嗯……顶级的，最好的。
So, you know, we're happy to pay for the faces, whatever cosmetic healing you might need, uh... Top-shelf, nothing but the best.

556
00:28:54,149 --> 00:29:00,113
是的,是的。还有阿姆斯特丹的美好生活，在经历了这一切之后你应该在这里休息和自由。
Yes, yes. As well as a good life here in Amsterdam, where you deserve a rest and some freedom after what you've been through.

557
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:05,619
将来我们需要你们这些好人帮忙的时候，我们会来找你们的。
We'll come a-calling sometime in the future when we need you good people to help us out.

558
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,703
是的。
Yes.

559
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:14,670
因为总有一天我们会对这些制造这场我们无法理解的战争的疯子说“够了”。
Because there will come a time to say "enough" to these madmen who create this war we cannot make any sense of.

560
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,172
这怪物怎么可能再出现呢?
Well, how could this monstrosity repeat itself?

561
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,424
这应该是一场结束所有战争的战争。
It's supposed to be the war to end all wars.

562
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,509
正确的。
Right.

563
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,762
因为梦会重复，因为它会忘记自己。
Because the dream repeats itself since it forgets itself.

564
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,014
这就是为什么它会重复。
That's why it repeats itself.

565
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,766
这是好的部分。
This is the good part.

566
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,935
但不好的部分总有一天会再次出现。
But the bad part will come again one day.

567
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,981
但现在，这是阿姆斯特丹的好地方。
But for now, this is the good part, in Amsterdam.

568
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,128
这些是灯。
These are the lights right here.

569
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,213
它们可能有点棘手。
They can be a little tricky.

570
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,739
你得向上，向下，向上，向下，向上。
You gotta go up, down, up, down, up.

571
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,700
它们会闪烁一会儿。看到了吗?
They'll flicker for a little bit. See?

572
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,368
卢米埃。
Lumière.

573
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,703
我是说，这地方很大。
I mean, it's a big place.

574
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,806
保罗和亨利帮我安排的，但太乱了。
Paul and Henry organized it for me, but it's a wreck.

575
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,831
她是对的。
She was right.

576
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:57,129
-这是精彩的部分。-还有这个水龙头…-太棒了。-我是说，别被吓到。当你用水的时候……它会这样做的。
- This was the good part. - And this tap... - It was fantastic. - I mean, don't let it scare you. When you use the water... it will do that.

577
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,339
整个世界突然变成了我们的牡蛎，它是如此的辉煌。
The world was suddenly our oyster and it was glorious.

578
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,008
这是正常的。
That's normal.

579
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:14,354
是的。阿姆斯特丹是在心脏，一直在那里。
Yeah. Amsterdam is in the heart, and was there all along.

580
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,440
去吧!
Go on!

581
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,734
保罗，让他们看看沙舞!
Paul, show them the sand dance!

582
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,611
沙舞。
The sand dance.

583
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,531
疯狂的大英帝国沙舞。
The crazy British Empire sand dance.

584
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,883
她聪明又疯狂。
She was brilliant and nuts.

585
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,843
但她和我们是一类疯子。
But she was our kind of nuts.

586
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,930
所以条约现在有了三个。
And so the pact now had three.

587
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:56,021
我在阿姆斯特丹呆了一段时间，因为那里的景色很美。
I stayed in Amsterdam for a while because it was glorious there.

588
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,815
他又稳又壮。
He was steady and strong.

589
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,734
她很大胆，很聪明。
She was bold and luminous.

590
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,820
这就是法国人所说的“千钧一发”。
It was what the French call a coup de foudre.

591
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,238
一见钟情。
Love at first sight.

592
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,157
她创造了自己的艺术。
She made her art.

593
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,245
我是他们最好的朋友，用我的新眼睛。
I was their best friend, with my new eye.

594
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,722
我们帮助经过城镇的老兵。——好的。这工作。
We helped vets - passing through town. - Okay. That works.

595
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,255
我们经常去跳舞。
We went dancing all the time.

596
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,008
它是宏伟的。
It was magnificent.

597
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:31,556
在探戈舞厅，你真的会觉得自己在飞翔。
These tango parlors, you really feel like you're flying.

598
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,545
你不能走。我…那边现在太糟糕了。
You can't go. I... It's terrible over there right now.

599
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,863
-你在说什么?-我要见我妻子。
- What are you talking about? - I have to see my wife.

600
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,492
伯特，我有很不好的预感。
Burt, I have a very bad feeling about this.

601
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,744
我…我认为如果你离开是一个不好的预兆。
I... I think it's a bad omen if you leave.

602
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,871
请不要走。
Please don't go.

603
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,625
我成了公园大道的一名医生。
I became a doctor on Park Avenue.

604
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,876
-公园大道。-我结婚了。
- Park Avenue. - I'm married.

605
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,632
我们可以……我们能算出来的，对吧?我们可以……我对公园大道略知一二。
We can... We can figure it out, right? We can... I know a thing or two about Park Avenue.

606
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,218
请不要走。
Please don't go.

607
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,012
瓦莱丽。
Valerie.

608
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,685
让我们现实一点。这不会永远持续下去。
Let's be realistic. This can't last forever.

609
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,728
我们要怎么生活?
How are we supposed to live?

610
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,650
我想念碧翠丝，尽管她和她的家人把我送去了战场。
I missed Beatrice, even though she and her family sent me off to war.

611
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,026
为你的国家服务。
Serve your country.

612
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,822
我第一次见到她是在医学院的慈善活动上
When I first met her, I was at a charity event at medical school.

613
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,551
我看到了这个女人，我见过的最漂亮的女人。
And I see this woman, the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

614
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,802
我的天啊。你真该看看她。
Oh, my God. You should've seen her.

615
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:33,910
我们跳了一整晚。
And we danced all night.

616
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,370
我们都头晕了。我们都笑了。
We were giddy. We were laughing.

617
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,454
我们相爱了。
We were in love.

618
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:40,292
我不知道她是那个给我奖学金的人的女儿。
I had no idea that she was the daughter of the guy who gave me the scholarship.

619
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:50,177
在他眼里，这个有一半犹太人血统的人，就像是在说"你可以拿奖学金，但我女儿，- "不准拿"-听起来很糟糕。
In his eyes, this half Jew, he was like, "You can have the scholarship, but my daughter, - "uh-uh, off-limits." - Sounds bad.

620
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,304
你可以选择你的朋友。
You can choose your friends.

621
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,972
你不能选择你的家庭。
You can't choose your family.

622
00:32:54,848 --> 00:33:01,229
我选择了你。这……我有点尴尬了，因为你可能不这么想。
And I choose you. And this... I'm getting embarrassed, because you might not feel the same way.

623
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:06,860
但这段感情，可能是我生命中最重要的东西。
But this relationship, probably the most important thing in my life.

624
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,030
是的。
Yeah.

625
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,615
我们同意。所以保持。
We do agree. So stay.

626
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,658
但我不能放弃碧翠丝。
But I can't quit Beatrice.

627
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,328
我爱她。
I love her.

628
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,664
当然，他们说你会有奖章。
Sure, they say you'll have medals.

629
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,209
你会和公园大道很合得来的。
You'll fit in on Park Avenue.

630
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,296
这就是我受到的英雄般的欢迎。
Well, this was the hero's welcome I received.

631
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,299
不，我告诉过你，你不能在这里治疗这些病人。
No, I've told you before, you cannot treat these patients here.

632
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,759
这完全不合适。
It's just completely inappropriate.

633
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,930
我之所以认识这些病人是因为你让我上了战场。
The only reason I know these patients is because you made me go to war.

634
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,408
你要明白，这种事不会发生在公园大道上。
You understand, this does not happen on Park Avenue.

635
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,184
而且你服用了太多吗啡。
And you've been taking too much morphine.

636
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,560
你离我女儿远点。
You stay away from my daughter.

637
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,645
你被列入黑名单了。
You are blacklisted.

638
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,981
走了。离开。你必须离开。你必须离开这里。
Go. Leave. You must leave. You must leave here.

639
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,068
不要去公寓。我将……我会给你寄衣服的。
Don't go to the apartment. I'll... I'll send you clothes.

640
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,196
伯特伦,呆!我很抱歉。
Bertram, stay! I'm sorry.

641
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,328
嘿。嘿。嘿，嘿，嘿。
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

642
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,372
我怎么能不帮助老兵呢?
How can I not help the veterans?

643
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,207
嘿。
Hey.

644
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,629
我把诊所搬到了大琼斯街的一条小巷里。
I had relocated my practice to an alley off Great Jones Street.

645
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,259
吃止痛药的时候有点失控了。
It got a little out of control with the pain medicine.

646
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,430
我被强制休息，这是纽约州的恩赐。
And I was given an enforced rest, courtesy of the State of New York.

647
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,723
来吧，伙计。
Come on, buddy.

648
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,226
写信给我朋友，让他们救我出来。
Wrote my friends to help get me out.

649
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,895
不知道这会对他们造成什么影响。
Had no idea what it would do to them.

650
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:28,608
如果你的家人有能力帮伯特出狱，我觉得你应该这么做。
If your family has the kind of influence that can help Burt get out of jail, I think you should do it.

651
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,444
约定就是约定，瓦莱丽。
I mean, the pact is the pact, Valerie.

652
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,031
我告诉过你我逃离了什么，不是吗?
I told you I ran away from something, didn't I?

653
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,449
这就是你需要知道的。
That's all you need to know.

654
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,953
但是，是的，我的家人可能会帮他。
But, yes, my family could possibly help him.

655
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,789
但如果我联系他们，他们就会知道我在哪里。
But if I contact them, they'll know where I am.

656
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:47,752
如果他们知道我在哪里，他们可能会想办法把我拖回去。
And if they know where I am, they will find a way to possibly drag me back.

657
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,297
他们很有说服力。
And they're very persuasive.

658
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,507
他所做的一切都是为了帮助这个团。
All he was doing was trying to help the regiment.

659
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,635
我听说那些人在老家日子不好过。
I hear those guys have it rough back at home.

660
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,473
我想我们都知道这是怎么回事。
I think we both knew where this was headed anyway.

661
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,475
-是的。-你这是什么意思?
- Yeah. - What do you mean by that?

662
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,978
我是说，我们…我们只存在于阿姆斯特丹。
Well, I mean, we... we only exist in Amsterdam.

663
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:11,067
你也说了很多关于你回美国后打算做的事。
You know, and you've spoken a lot about the things that you plan on doing back in America.

664
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,360
也许是时候了。
Maybe it's time.

665
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,780
我说我想成为一名律师。
I said I wanted to become a lawyer.

666
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,907
为人民而战。
To fight for people.

667
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,576
人们喜欢家乡的那些士兵。
People like those soldiers back at home.

668
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:24,414
我想为那些无法反抗的人而战，为那些无法利用法律为自己而战的人而战。
I wanted to fight for people like that who couldn't fight back, who couldn't fight for themselves, to use the law.

669
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,209
你还说你想和我一起住在阿姆斯特丹。
You also said that you wanna live in Amsterdam with me.

670
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,670
是的。
Yes.

671
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,798
我两样都想做。我想回家战斗。
I wanna do both. I wanna go back home and fight.

672
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,551
我想和你待在一起。
And I wanna stay here with you.

673
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,845
我想活下去。我想要真正的生活。
And I wanna live. I wanna truly live.

674
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,514
你怎么能同时拥有这两样东西呢?
How do you have both those things?

675
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,977
有个办法。
There's a way.

676
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,730
但现在我们得帮伯特。
But right now we have to help Burt.

677
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,823
我们会怎么样?我爱你。
What will happen to us? I love you.

678
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,956
我们得帮伯特。
We gotta help Burt.

679
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,001
好的。
Okay.

680
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,172
穿好衣服。
Get dressed.

681
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:33,858
不久之后的一天，她消失了，除了一张便条，没跟哈罗德说一句话。
She vanished, one day soon after, without a word to Harold, except a note.

682
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,154
我突然从监狱里被释放了。
I was suddenly released from jail.

683
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,323
再也没有她的消息。
Never heard from her.

684
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,785
哈罗德回到了纽约。拿到了法律学位。
Harold came back to New York. Got his law degree.

685
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,869
你有权要求赔偿。
You have a claim.

686
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,955
我们一起工作了10多年。
We worked together over 10 years.

687
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,833
好医生和我会好好照顾你的。
The good doctor and I will take good care of you.

688
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:55,004
我们帮别人摆脱了各种麻烦，直到米金斯的案子。
All kinds of trouble we got people out of, until the Meekins case.

689
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,094
这就是我们现在所处的困境。
This was trouble that now we were in, ourselves.

690
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,431
我们很可能无法存活。
And we may very well not survive.

691
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,642
我的天啊。那个可怜的女孩。
Oh, my God. That poor girl.

692
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,018
我受不了了。
I can't bear this.

693
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:12,021
某物出事了，哈罗德。
Something... Something is very wrong, Harold.

694
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,901
你总是对我说的那句话是什么?
What's that thing that you always say to me?

695
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,654
我们会奋战到底的。
We'll fight through it.

696
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,699
不管发生什么，我们都会有办法的。
We'll find a way, no matter what.

697
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,537
谢谢你！我需要这个。
Thank you. I need that.

698
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,583
在那里……你要去哪里?
Where... Where you going?

699
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,544
我们离开这条街会更安全。
It's safer if we can get off the street.

700
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,880
哦……我知道我们在哪里。
Oh... I know where we are.

701
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,841
我知道我们在哪里。不是那个女人，伯特。
I know where we are. Not that woman, Burt.

702
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,929
灯都关了。这是一个惊喜晚餐吗?
The lights are off. Is it a surprise dinner?

703
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,516
她认识莉兹·米金斯那个世界的人。
She knows people from Liz Meekins's world.

704
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,351
这个地方看起来还是老样子。
The place looks the same.

705
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,187
闻起来像樟脑丸，像你的婚姻。
Smells of mothballs, like your marriage.

706
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:53,855
谢谢你,朋友。
Thanks, pal.

707
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,149
如果没有诚实，朋友还有什么用?
What are friends for if not honesty?

708
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,109
火,会被火灼伤。情况如何?
That burns. How we looking?

709
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,821
好吗?
Good?

710
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,699
帮助我。
Help me.

711
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,702
-是直的吗?-是的。
- Is that straight? - Yeah.

712
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,829
哦，我明白了。
Oh, I see.

713
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,748
你在她面前装得真漂亮啊?
You're really putting it on nice for her, huh?

714
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,458
伯特伦吗?
Bertram?

715
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,542
坐下来。放松。
Sit down. Relax.

716
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,835
伯特，别等太久。
Hey, Burt, don't be too long.

717
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:16,920
帮我个忙。
Do me a favor.

718
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,088
-试着乐观一点。——伯特伦?伯特伦吗?
- Try to be optimistic. - Bertram? Bertram?

719
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,426
哦，看看你。
Oh, look at you.

720
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:29,724
没有晚餐。我很抱歉。我很抱歉。这是一个错误。
There is no dinner. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

721
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,185
你为什么邀请我?
Why did you invite me?

722
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,729
因为它是…我有一时的软弱。
Because it was... I had a moment of weakness.

723
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,359
我们变成这样了?一时的软弱?
That's what we've become? A moment of weakness?

724
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,905
不能让我父亲知道我在做这件事因为他会剥夺我所有的特权。
And my father can't even know that I'm doing this because he'll take away all kinds of privileges.

725
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,493
怎么了?
What's wrong here?

726
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:58,169
你还记得我们在晚上，只唱艾米莉·狄金森的诗，一起唱歌，彼此对视吗?
Do you remember when we would have nights, just Emily Dickinson poetry, and singing together and just staring at each other?

727
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,505
-怎么了?-我记得，是的。
- What happened? - I remember, yeah.

728
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,173
这就是为什么我爱你。
That's why I love you.

729
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,052
你摔倒了吗?
Did you fall?

730
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,805
你的背受伤了吗?让我看一下。
Did you hurt your back? Let me take a look at it.

731
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,475
我的背疼了一整天。
My back has been killing me all day.

732
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,018
现在不是时候。
This is not the right time.

733
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,395
只是看了一眼。来吧。
Just a glimpse. Come on.

734
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,408
你曾经如此美丽。
You were once so beautiful.

735
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,660
看在上帝的份上。
Oh, for God's sakes.

736
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:35,039
而现在你变得又丑又丑。
And now you're just hideous and grotesque.

737
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,251
你又丑又畸形。
You're so ugly and deformed.

738
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,128
看着你真是太难受了。
It's so hard to look at you.

739
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,047
你穿得像个女人。
And you wear a corset like a woman.

740
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:48,386
-你很无助。-碧翠丝，我受不了了。
- You're helpless. - Beatrice, I can't do this anymore.

741
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,557
你对我的伤疤这么不正常。
This deviance that you've come to have about my scars.

742
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,978
你是选择我，还是需要我?
Do you choose me or do you need me?

743
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,023
这是什么问题啊?
What kind of a question is that?

744
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:13,119
今天我和一个人聊天，他们说爱是选择一个人，而不是因为其他原因需要他。
I was talking to someone today and they said that love is choosing someone, not needing them for some other reason.

745
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,665
是我们相遇时你需要我，还是你选择了我这个人?
Did you need me when we met, or did you choose me as a person?

746
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,626
是因为我身边的人吗?
Was it the people around me?

747
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:24,297
你还是从纽约北部来的奖学金生时我家族在医学界的声望?
The prestige of my family in medicine when you were a scholarship student from Upstate New York?

748
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,758
还是你选择了我?
Or did you choose me?

749
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,719
只是我吗?
Just me?

750
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,558
我刚才也问过伯特同样的问题。
I asked Burt the exact same question just a little while ago.

751
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,060
哈罗德樵夫。
Harold Woodman.

752
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,561
你为什么拿着女人的钱包?
Why do you have a woman's purse?

753
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:45,068
比尔·米金斯的女儿莉兹，今晚被推到了卡车下面。
Bill Meekins's daughter, Liz, was pushed under a truck tonight.

754
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,487
你是认真的吗?
What, are you serious?

755
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,614
她雇我是因为我们和她父亲关系很好。
She hired me because we were close to her father.

756
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,948
所以她才信任我们。
That's why she trusted us.

757
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,202
不知为何，他们认为是我们干的。
Somehow, they think that we did it.

758
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,871
我们需要一个人。我们需要一些东西。
And we need somebody. We need something.

759
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,290
我们需要有人帮助我们。
We need someone to help us.

760
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,376
“罗斯”这个名字怎么样?
What about the name "Rose"?

761
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:06,089
这是莉斯·米金斯死前说的最后一句话，罗斯先生能帮她。
That's the last thing Liz Meekins said before she died, that a Mr. Rose could help her.

762
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,401
莉兹绝不会认识一个叫罗斯的人。那是犹太人的名字。
Liz would never have known a Rose. That's a Jewish name.

763
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,678
哦。谢谢你，碧翠丝。
Oh. Thank you, Beatrice.

764
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,971
你只有一半。哈罗德，你听错了。
You're only half. Harold, you misheard.

765
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,139
为什么?
Why?

766
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,350
因为必须是"Voze"加" v "
Because it has to be "Voze" with a "V."

767
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,435
那是社会记录上有名的家族。
That's a prominent family in the Social Register.

768
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,272
沃兹一家在最上面。
The Vozes are at the top of it.

769
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,942
伯特，这就是我说的。
Burt, this is what I'm talking about.

770
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,611
我们身处的是你的世界，不是我的。
This is your world that we're in trouble in, not mine.

771
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,785
那是什么?
What's that?

772
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,663
你怎么敢进来?
How dare you come in here?

773
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,831
门没锁。
The door was unlocked.

774
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,514
这还是你登记的地址，对吧?
This is still your listed address, right?

775
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,667
显然如此。
Apparently so.

776
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,795
盖特韦勒警探，什么风把你吹来了?莱姆，你还需要药吗?
Detective Getweiler, what brings you here at this hour? You need more pills, Lem?

777
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:50,299
我知道你和我戴着一样的支架，不像希尔兹先生。
I know you have the same brace as I do, not like Mr. Hiltz.

778
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,386
你的平拱让德国人在莱茵兰看不到你。
Your flat arches stopped the Germans from seeing you in the Rhineland.

779
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,680
你知道我为什么来这里，伯特。
You know why I'm here, Burt.

780
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,143
你和伍德曼在把米金斯家的女人推到卡车下面后逃离了现场。
You and Woodman fled the scene after you pushed the Meekins woman under a truck.

781
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,145
你为什么会认为是我们干的?
Why would you possibly think that was us?

782
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:07,608
没有多少人符合医生和他的黑人律师在地上寻找他的眼睛的描述。
Well, there's not too many people that fit the description of a doctor looking for his eye on the ground with his Black attorney.

783
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,822
死去的女人雇了哈罗德调查她父亲的死。
The woman who died hired Harold to look into her father's death.

784
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,616
我今天下午给他做了尸检。
I did an autopsy on him this afternoon.

785
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,661
他是我们所在兵团的将军，莱姆。
He was the general of the regiment we served in, Lem.

786
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,622
目击者说你推了她。
Witnesses say you pushed her.

787
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,041
不，我们必须离开那里。当时一片混乱。
No, we had to get out of there. It was chaos.

788
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,085
一场打斗爆发了。凶手指着我们。
A fight broke out. The killer pointed at us.

789
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,754
他很擅长当罪犯。
He's very good at being a criminal.

790
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:28,963
我只知道一件事。
Well, I know one thing.

791
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,715
我得给队长一个答案。
I need to give my captain answers.

792
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,176
现在，你们两个是嫌疑人。
And at the moment, you two are the suspects.

793
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,014
你能证明你和莉兹·米金斯有雇佣合同吗?
Can you prove you have an employment contract with Liz Meekins?

794
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,016
她雇你做她的律师吗?
That she hired you to be her attorney?

795
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,410
绝对的。我可以拿给你。
Absolutely. I can get that to you.

796
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:45,938
另外，我可以给你初步尸检报告和比尔·米金斯的遗产文件。
Plus, I can get you the preliminary autopsy report and the Bill Meekins estate papers.

797
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,106
好。
Good.

798
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,902
不，我们得…我们得带你去…-别碰我。——Hiltz。Hiltz Hiltz。
No, we gotta... we gotta take you in... - Get your hands off of me. - Hiltz. Hiltz, Hiltz.

799
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,305
我是律师协会的一员。
I'm a part of the Bar Association.

800
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,362
别碰我。
Don't touch me.

801
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:57,200
我甚至不喜欢这个人是律师。
I don't even like that this man is a lawyer.

802
00:42:58,743 --> 00:42:59,994
哥伦比亚大学法学院。
Columbia Law School.

803
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,141
也许你的平臀弓让你很难理解。
Maybe those flat-ass arches of yours make that hard for you to comprehend.

804
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,750
别跟我说我的扁足。
Don't talk to me about my flat arches.

805
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,836
我要敲碎你的头…希尔兹，不，你不会的。别吵了!
I'll crack your head right... Hiltz, no, you won't. Knock it off!

806
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,380
如果我们找个人为我们做担保呢?
What if we got someone to vouch for us?

807
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,049
社会登记处的人吗?
Someone from the Social Register?

808
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,135
这会引起你们队长的注意吗?
Would that get your captain's attention?

809
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:21,307
像沃兹先生这样认识比尔·米金斯的人。
Someone like Mr. Voze, who knew Bill Meekins.

810
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,852
伯特伦……比阿特丽斯。
Bertram... Beatrice.

811
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,481
我的家人是州医疗委员会的长期成员。
My family are long-standing members of the state medical board.

812
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:34,589
我可以证明这两个男人都是可怕的骗子，对彼此都是，更不用说对警察了。
And I can attest to the fact that both of these men are horrible liars, to each other, let alone to the police.

813
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:41,744
如果你在给他们机会给你他们所提供的一切之前就收留了他们，我担心这可能会让你失去工作。
If you take them in before giving them the chance to give you everything that they've offered, I'm afraid it might cost you your job.

814
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,080
我父亲在市政厅有很多朋友。
My father has a lot of friends at City Hall.

815
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,172
把你答应过的东西都给我们。
Get us everything you promised.

816
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:58,302
明白吗，你和我，我们有共同点。
Understand, you and me, we got something in common.

817
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,972
我们服过役，不像这家伙。
We served, not like this guy.

818
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,933
丢失的钱包怎么办?它去哪了?
What about the missing purse? Where did that go?

819
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,936
这可能……这可能是证据。
This could... This could be evidence.

820
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,080
你拿那个干什么?把它放下。
What are you doing with that? Put that down.

821
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,289
-放回去。-这里面是什么?
- Put that back. - What's in here?

822
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,374
-这是什么?-把它放下。
- What's this? - Put it down.

823
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,458
-我只是说…-放回去。
- I'm just saying... - Put that back.

824
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,692
哦,哦。
Oh-oh.

825
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,070
我很抱歉。我很小心。
I'm sorry. I was being careful.

826
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,822
你怎么了?
What is the matter with you?

827
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,574
他在学习，伯特。
He's learning, Burt.

828
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,534
他,呃…他可以成为一个好侦探。
He, uh... He can be a good detective.

829
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,204
你跟沃兹谈过之后，马上告诉我。
And when you spoke to Voze, you let me know right away.

830
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,206
我不会等那么久的。听到了吗，伯特?
I'm not gonna wait that long. You hear me, Burt?

831
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,749
——是的。-我给你几天时间。
- Yes. - I'll give you a few days.

832
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,311
但如果有必要的话-我会亲自带你来。-我明白。
But if I have to, - I'll bring you in myself. - I understand.

833
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,212
-我还需要一些药。-我知道了。
- And I need some pills too. - I got it.

834
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,172
我很快就会在你办公室见你。
I'll be seeing you in your office pretty soon.

835
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,216
——是的。-但情况很糟糕。
- Yes. - But it's a bad situation.

836
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,135
这很糟糕。
It's very bad.

837
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,349
那真是令人兴奋。
Well, that was exciting.

838
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,458
去拿你的东西，但别在回家的路上被杀了。
Go and get your things, but don't get killed on the way home.

839
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,909
五人委员会，活下去。
Committee of the Five, stay alive.

840
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,869
闭上你的嘴。
Keep your mouth shut.

841
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,288
为什么不直接开车朝我们开枪?
Why not just drive up and shoot us?

842
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,458
五人委员会，永远活着!
Committee of the Five, always alive!

843
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,461
这家伙还想对我们做什么?
What else did this guy have in mind for us?

844
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,670
我们无处不在。
We're everywhere.

845
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,307
所以现在我们必须撒谎才能进入这家伙的房子。
So now we have to lie to get into this guy's house.

846
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,811
怎样做并不重要。我们要去见沃兹先生。
Doesn't matter how. We are gonna see Mr. Voze.

847
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,398
什么是慈善?
What is this charity?

848
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:35,900
这是圣公会的。
Okay, that's the Episcopal one.

849
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,109
门开了，你说?
The door opens and you say?

850
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,194
我说:“你好……”
I say, "Hello..."

851
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,696
我是伯特·伯伦森医生。
My name is Dr. Burt Berendsen.

852
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,950
这位是哈罗德·伍德曼，时尚先生，荣誉勋章获得者。
This is Harold Woodman, Esquire, Medal of Honor recipient.

853
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,550
这是英勇十字勋章，不是荣誉勋章，你知道的。
It's the Croix de Guerre, not the Medal of Honor, and you know that.

854
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,997
十字勋章，是的。对不起。
Croix de Guerre, yes. Sorry.

855
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,258
我们知道圣公会教徒有多爱沃兹先生。
We know how the Episcopalians love Mr. Voze.

856
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,219
他错过了你会很遗憾的。他不在。
He'll be sorry to have missed you. He's not in.

857
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,054
你觉得他什么时候会回来?
Well, when do you think he'll be back?

858
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,514
我不知道。
I don't know.

859
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,450
但也许你可以把那封信交给我?
But perhaps you could leave that letter with me?

860
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,060
我们得把这个直接交给沃兹先生。
We need to hand this directly to Mr. Voze.

861
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,646
是主教的命令。
On orders from the Bishop.

862
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,940
正确的。那你可以留张卡片。
Right. Well, then, you can leave a card.

863
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,733
很抱歉让你们失望了，先生们。
I'm sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen.

864
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,403
不过，你介意吗?
However, do you mind?

865
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:28,703
我看着这个柜子，然后我…我忍不住认出了这些工艺品。
I'm looking at this cabinet, and I... I couldn't help but recognize these crafts.

866
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,746
这些是医院制造的吗?
Are these made in a hospital, over here?

867
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,956
看到了吗?是的。
See? Yes.

868
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,624
看起来像是老兵的作品。是的。
Looks like the works of veterans. Yes.

869
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,543
-都是老兵干的。——正确的。
- All by veterans. - Right.

870
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,211
沃兹的主要慈善事业。
Mr. Voze's primary charity.

871
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,046
他们一直寄来感谢信。
They send them all the time as thanks.

872
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,048
你真是太好了。
That, uh, is very kind.

873
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:45,199
事实上，我们……呃，退伍军人…莉比，能把药给我吗?
And we, in fact... uh, are veterans... Libby, can I have the remedy, please?

874
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:49,306
我双手发麻，神经发冷，剧痛。
I've got that numbness in my hands, and the chills in the nerves and shooting pains.

875
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,391
好吗?
Please?

876
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,185
瓦莱丽，请回你的房间或者上楼去。
Valerie, please go into your room or go back upstairs.

877
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,271
你没看见我们有客人吗?
Can't you see we have company present?

878
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,901
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

879
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,156
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

880
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,242
不。别跟她说话。她身体不舒服。
No. Don't talk to her. She's not well.

881
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,202
瓦莱丽，别跟这些人说话。
Valerie, don't talk to these men.

882
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,539
我不是血友病患者，莉比。我可以和人们交谈。
I'm not a hemophiliac, Libby. I can talk to people.

883
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:18,127
是的，你不是血友病患者，但你有癫痫，你有神经紊乱。不!
Yes, you're not a hemophiliac, but you are epileptic, and you have a nervous disorder. No!

884
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,963
-我们谈了娃娃的事。-我要咬掉你的耳朵。
- We talked about the doll. - I'll bite your ears off.

885
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,841
不!我告诉过你别对娃娃这么做。
No! I told you not to do that with the doll.

886
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,093
-莫兰太太!卡尔顿……-卡尔顿!
- Mrs. Moran! Carlton... - Carlton!

887
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,012
你知道这让我很不安，瓦莱丽。
You know that disturbs me, Valerie.

888
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,764
你好大的胆子!卡尔顿!
How dare you! Carlton!

889
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,015
卡尔顿。
Carlton.

890
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,224
瓦莱丽,诚实。
Valerie, honestly.

891
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,061
我们说过要把我和她单独留在一起。
We spoke about leaving me alone with her.

892
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,271
进来吧。我们可以在这里谈。
Come in here. We can talk in here.

893
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,015
这种巧合怎么可能?
How is this coincidence even possible?

894
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,892
因为这不是巧合。
Because it's not a coincidence.

895
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,854
是我让莉斯·米金斯雇你们俩的。
I told Liz Meekins to hire you two.

896
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,440
你叫莉斯·米金斯雇我们是什么意思?
What do you mean, you told Liz Meekins to hire us?

897
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,525
她是我的朋友。
She's a friend of mine.

898
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,794
她需要一个她可以信任的人。
She needed someone she could trust.

899
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,486
我们社交圈之外的人。
Someone outside our social circle.

900
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,655
这太奇怪了。
This is so strange.

901
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,754
我从没告诉过你我的真名。
I never really told you my real last name.

902
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,450
班登堡是个流动的名字。
Bandenberg was a traveling name.

903
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,702
但这是我们在阿姆斯特丹的协议。
But that was our deal in Amsterdam.

904
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,162
没有关于过去的事。
Nothing about the past.

905
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,624
对吧?
Right?

906
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,127
你住在新泽西?一直以来?
You live in New Jersey? This whole time?

907
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,797
-是的。-这房子真大。
- Yeah. - This is a big house.

908
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,799
-这就是你的生活方式?-是的。
- This is how you live? - Yeah.

909
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,596
不信。
No letter.

910
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,892
-不是打电话。-我很尴尬。
- Not a phone call. - I was embarrassed.

911
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,602
这不是我曾经的样子。
This is not who I once was.

912
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,479
不是你在阿姆斯特丹遇到的人。
It's not who you met in Amsterdam.

913
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,610
你的平衡有什么问题吗?
What's wrong with your balance?

914
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,238
我有神经障碍。
I have a nerve disorder.

915
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:11,407
你以前从来没有过。
You never had that before.

916
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,325
不，她以前从来没有过。
No, she never had that before.

917
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,539
我们在这里是有原因的。
We are here for a reason.

918
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,749
哈罗德，别忘了，这事很紧急。
Harold, let's not forget, it's pretty urgent.

919
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,211
瓦莱丽，你认识汤姆·沃兹吗?
Valerie, do you know Tom Voze?

920
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,046
我当然认识汤姆。
Of course I know Tom.

921
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,756
我们有大麻烦了，瓦莱丽。
We're in a lot of trouble, Valerie.

922
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,300
我们需要他为我们担保。
We need him to vouch for us.

923
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,112
他是个好人，但我不知道他会不会为你担保。
He's a good guy, but I don't know if he's gonna vouch for you.

924
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,138
他避免引起争议。他不喜欢那样。
He avoids controversy. He doesn't like that.

925
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,848
他很容易被吓倒。
He's easily intimidated.

926
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,184
-他是你丈夫吗?-卡尔顿在路上了!
- Is he your husband? - Carlton's on his way!

927
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,310
不，他不是我丈夫。
No, he's not my husband.

928
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,872
他娶了一个在外面大喊着要把你赶出去的女人。
He's married to the woman out there screaming to have you kicked out right now.

929
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:42,897
他是我哥哥。
He's my brother.

930
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:47,443
我们在阿姆斯特丹经历了那么多，结果伯特和我根本不知道你是谁。
After everything we had in Amsterdam, turns out Burt and I have no idea who you are.

931
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,031
你很清楚我是谁。我很清楚你是谁。
You know exactly who I am. I know exactly who you are.

932
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,451
我们三个。伯特。
All three of us. Burt too.

933
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,703
我们都很了解对方。
We know each other the way it counts.

934
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,624
如果你们俩还有协议，那我也是其中一员。
And if you two still have an arrangement, then I'm still part of it.

935
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,042
也许12年后就不会了。
Maybe not after 12 years.

936
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,127
是的，12年后。是的。
Yes, after 12 years. Yes.

937
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,587
因为我最终来到了这里。
Because I ended up here.

938
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,964
我回来是因为你和你。
And I came back because of you and you.

939
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,428
这是真的。
That's true.

940
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,868
我说过你离开阿姆斯特丹后，会有坏事发生。
I told you when you left Amsterdam, something bad would happen.

941
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,578
我说过这是梦中最糟糕的部分。
I said it would be the bad part of the dream.

942
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,645
我没说过吗?
Did I not say that?

943
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,230
这是真的。
It's true.

944
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,314
现在我们到了。
And here we are.

945
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,399
瓦莱丽，卡尔顿在路上了。
Valerie, Carlton's on his way.

946
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,026
打开门。
Open the door.

947
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,361
我们可以摆脱它。
We can get out of it.

948
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,367
这里不一样，所以我不知道。
Well, it's different here, so I don't know about that.

949
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,952
卡尔顿来了，瓦莱丽。
Carlton is coming, Valerie.

950
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,578
我感觉这是卡尔顿。
I have a feeling this is Carlton.

951
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,205
哦,不。
Oh, no.

952
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,040
不。哦，不，不，不。
No. Oh, no, no, no.

953
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:48,837
啊…-卡尔顿。卡尔顿。请。——等待。等待……哦!
Ah... - Carlton. Carlton. Please. - Wait. Wait... Oh!

954
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,009
瓦莱丽，你看到发生了什么吗?
Valerie, do you see what happens?

955
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,053
你怎么可能认识这些人?
How do you possibly know any of these men?

956
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,978
他在那儿。白兰地，莫兰太太。
There he is. The brandy, Mrs. Moran.

957
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,068
不用了，谢谢。我不喝酒。
No, thank you. I don't drink.

958
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,990
我觉得我不会相信一个不爱喝酒的人，尤其是在这种时候。
Well, I don't think I trust a man who doesn't like a drink, especially at a time like this.

959
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,201
我的眼睛在哪里，哈罗德?
Where is my eye, Harold?

960
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,870
-就在这里。——谢谢。
- Right here. - Thanks.

961
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,667
我从没想过两个功勋军人会在我家里被打晕。
I never expected two decorated soldiers to get knocked out in my own home.

962
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,794
不，只有一个，先生。
No, just one, sir.

963
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,381
哦，对了，伍德曼先生。你对卡尔顿来说太快了。
Oh, that's right, Mr. Woodman. You were too fast for Carlton.

964
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,967
我是。
I was.

965
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,803
他们和瓦莱丽谈过了，她身体不太好。
They started talking to Valerie, and she's not well.

966
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,223
求你了，亲爱的女孩，别哭了。
And please, darling girl, stop crying.

967
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,059
她哭是很自然的事，莉比。
It's only natural for her to cry, Libby.

968
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,061
她刚发现她的朋友死了。
She just found out her friend is dead.

969
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,189
我们不能永远瞒着她。
We couldn't keep it from her for forever.

970
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,526
我还没病到不能和人说话的地步。
I'm not so ill that I can't talk to people.

971
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:57,007
你明明知道我认为她应该住院，却把我留在这里和这个病人在一起。-利比。
You leave me here with this invalid when you know very well that I think - she should be hospitalized. - Libby.

972
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:01,011
-这是为她好-如果你再对我说这种话…-我处理不了…对你来说，那里会更好。
- It's for her own good. - If you ever say that - to me again... - I can't handle... It will be a better place for you.

973
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,095
我就送你去医院
I'll put you in a hospital.

974
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,179
我会送你去女巫审判。
I'll send you to a witch trial.

975
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,998
女士们,请。女士们。停止。
Ladies, please. Ladies. Stop.

976
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,587
我很抱歉。很抱歉我提高了嗓门。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I had to raise my voice.

977
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:14,190
她跟这些人说话，好像她认识他们一样。
She was talking to these men like she knows them.

978
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,966
这把我吓坏了。
That terrified me.

979
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,554
你们认识吗?
Do you know one another?

980
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,680
——是的。——没有。
- Yes. - No.

981
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:24,683
——是的。-确实是这样。
- Yes. - We do, indeed.

982
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,101
欧洲。
Europe.

983
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,187
-阿姆斯特丹来的。-医院
- From Amsterdam. - The hospital.

984
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,647
他们说是圣公会慈善机构的。
They said they were from the Episcopal charities.

985
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,816
这有什么道理吗?
Is there any truth to that at all?

986
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,526
-当然。-部分如此。
- Uh, absolutely. - In part.

987
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,611
部分?
In part?

988
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,905
嘿，晚会马上就要到了。
Hey, the gala is coming up.

989
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,239
这基本上是一个老手的活动。
Mostly a veteran event.

990
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,367
但那里可能有圣公会教徒。
But there might be Episcopalians there.

991
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,203
比尔·米金斯是我们的特邀演讲者。
And Bill Meekins was our featured speaker.

992
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:50,959
但我们却陷入了这样一个可怕的境地我们被指控杀害了莉兹·米金斯，无论如何这都不是事实。
But we find ourselves in this terrible situation where we're accused of killing Liz Meekins, which is not true in any way.

993
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:52,586
莉兹提到了"沃兹"这个名字
Liz mentioned the name "Voze,"

994
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,256
所以我们觉得你可能知道是谁在跟踪她能帮我们洗清罪名。
and so we thought you might know who was after her and can help clear our names.

995
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,509
我们的退伍军人。我们尊敬的。
We're veterans. We're respectable.

996
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:03,097
我们不会掺和进来的，除非帮忙。
We wouldn't be involved in any of this, except to help.

997
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,559
比尔·米金斯是一个爱吃全麦饼干的人。
Bill Meekins was a graham cracker of a man.

998
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,604
他的骨子里一点也不吝啬。
Not a mean bone in his body.

999
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,023
那么为什么……我为什么要帮她?
Then why... Why did I have to help her?

1000
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:16,777
为什么我要鼓励她去找我们认识的所有人，然后雇佣这两个人?
Why did I have to encourage her to go around everyone we know and hire these two?

1001
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,278
我确实帮了她，亲爱的。
I did help her, darling.

1002
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,532
我让她在事情变糟之前来找我。
I told her to come to me before it got bad.

1003
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,367
现在看看发生了什么。
Now look what happened.

1004
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,995
是的。看看你做了什么，瓦莱丽。
Yes. Look what you did, Valerie.

1005
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,849
我很抱歉，很不幸，但你不应该卷进来。
I'm sorry, it's unfortunate, but you shouldn't have gotten involved.

1006
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,041
这不是她的错。
It's not her fault.

1007
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,585
-这不是她的错。——汤姆。
- It's not her fault. - Tom.

1008
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:37,589
-这怎么不是她的错?-这不是…-有些事是她的错。——汤姆。汤姆。
- How is this not her fault? - It's not... - Some things are her fault. - Tom. Tom.

1009
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,383
哦,汤姆。
Oh, Tom.

1010
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,009
她生病了。
She's sick.

1011
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,558
我们能找到杀害比尔·米金斯的凶手。
We can find who killed Bill Meekins.

1012
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,185
很可能就是杀了他女儿的人。
It's probably the same people who killed his daughter.

1013
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,854
我们正在调查。
We're looking into it.

1014
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,941
这个信息就能洗清我们的罪名。
And, uh, that information will clear our names.

1015
00:53:56,024 --> 00:54:02,072
验尸报告显示他可能是在欧洲时服用过量药物中毒。
Now, the autopsy indicated that he was possibly poisoned by too many medicines while he was in Europe.

1016
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,075
你知道他和谁一起来的吗，谁派他来的?
Do you know who he was traveling with, who sent him?

1017
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,662
我可以帮你查清楚，但我不能亲自插手。
I can help you find out, but I can't get personally involved.

1018
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,830
你是个胆小鬼，汤姆。
You're a coward, Tom.

1019
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,707
你竟敢叫他胆小鬼。
Don't you dare call him a coward.

1020
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,126
你知道预科学校的孩子们是这么叫他的。
You know that's what he was called by those prep-school kids.

1021
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,295
太残忍了，瓦莱丽，你知道的。
It's cruel, Valerie, and you know that.

1022
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,965
他们想让我参与所有的委员会，俱乐部。
They want me to get involved in all these committees, clubs.

1023
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,134
你知道我是怎么做的吗?
Do you know what I do instead?

1024
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,013
我是一个鸟类观察者。
I'm a bird watcher.

1025
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,931
这就是我的工作。
That's what I do.

1026
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,933
一定很好吧，带你出去。
Mm, it must be good, get you outside.

1027
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,519
你是一个观鸟者。他是荒谬的。
You're a bird watcher. He's ridiculous.

1028
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:37,774
他并不比你和你的电影，刀片，茶杯，你做的那些可怕的东西更可笑。
He's no more ridiculous than you are with your movies, razor blades, teacups, the horrid things you make.

1029
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,526
说真的，瓦莱丽，他们疯了。
Honestly, Valerie, they're demented.

1030
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,652
原谅我。
Excuse me.

1031
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:46,408
你说过你能帮我们找到和他一起去欧洲的人。谁会知道呢?
You said that you could help us find who traveled with him to Europe. Who would know?

1032
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,914
吉尔·迪伦贝克会知道的。你认识他吗?
Gil Dillenbeck would know. Do you know him?

1033
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,374
全国人民都知道他。
The whole country knows him.

1034
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,252
他是美国历史上授勋最多的海军陆战队员。
He's the most decorated Marine in US history.

1035
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,670
-是的。-是的，他是。
- Yeah. - Yes, he is.

1036
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,548
迪伦贝克是米金斯的朋友。
Dillenbeck was friends with Meekins.

1037
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,799
他们都是将军。
They were both generals.

1038
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,551
我从没参过军。
I never got involved in the military.

1039
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,887
我只是经营家族的纺织公司。
I just ran the family's textile company.

1040
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,516
迪伦贝克能告诉你谁和米金斯一起去的。
Dillenbeck can tell you who was traveling with Meekins.

1041
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,327
我不会相信其他人。
I wouldn't trust anyone else.

1042
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,145
而我自己没有接触到这种信息的渠道。
And I don't have access to that kind of information myself.

1043
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,774
-好的，好的。我们见过他两次。-是的。
- Okay, okay. We met him twice. - Yeah.

1044
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:24,530
在比利时和他拍过一次照，还有一次…——华盛顿——红利军行军——在32年夏天。——正确的。
Took a picture with him once in Belgium and another... - D.C. - at the Bonus Army march - in summer '32. - Right.

1045
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,007
我们还留着那些照片，沃兹先生。
We still have those pictures, Mr. Voze.

1046
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,032
是的。正确的。
Yeah. Right.

1047
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,117
他对和谁说话很讲究。
He's very particular about who he'll speak to.

1048
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,998
如果你们见过他，你们是他尊敬的士兵，你们的机会比我大得多。
If you've met him, and you're soldiers he respects, your chances are far better than mine.

1049
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,084
是的，他不信任有钱的人。
Yeah, he distrusts people of means.

1050
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:39,586
如果你见到他，请一定告诉我们。
If you meet him, please do let us know.

1051
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,255
我很想和他握手。
I would love to shake his hand.

1052
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:46,009
莉比在新闻短片里看到了迪伦贝克，她迷上了他。
Libby saw Dillenbeck in the newsreel, and she has a crush on him.

1053
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,719
别傻了，瓦莱丽。
Don't be ridiculous, Valerie.

1054
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,429
你已经谈到了那个新闻短片。
You have talked about that newsreel.

1055
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:50,597
他是个令人印象深刻的人。
He's a very impressive man.

1056
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:51,682
是的，他是。
Yes, he is.

1057
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,141
我正好喜欢那部新闻片。
And I happen to like that newsreel.

1058
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,285
别玩了。别玩了，汤姆。
Don't play it. Don't play it, Tom.

1059
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,662
我们应该在他们走之前放一放。
Oh, we should play it before they go.

1060
00:55:55,686 --> 00:56:00,466
瓦莱丽，吉尔·迪伦贝克也许是你朋友们摆脱麻烦的唯一希望。
Valerie, Gil Dillenbeck is perhaps the one hope your friends have of getting out of all this trouble.

1061
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,114
你想看新闻片吗?
Would you like to see the newsreel?

1062
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,367
哦,很好。
Oh, good.

1063
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:18,333
去年夏天为福利而游行的退伍军人仍在吉尔·迪伦贝克将军的领导下。
The veterans who marched last summer for benefits remain under the leadership of General Gil Dillenbeck.

1064
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:23,589
尽管这位勇敢的将军仍然是他们的代言人，但退伍军人的福利仍然没有支付。
The veterans' benefits are still unpaid, though the brave general remains their spokesperson.

1065
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:27,467
听着，听着，这让我很生气。
Look, look, it makes me so damn mad.

1066
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,053
很多人都说你们是流浪汉。
A whole lot of people speak of you as tramps.

1067
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,598
“流浪汉!你们这些人都是流浪汉。”
"Tramps! You men are tramps."

1068
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,517
这些人是谁，竟敢这么叫你?
Who are these people who dare call you that?

1069
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:36,768
你是士兵。
You're soldiers.

1070
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,771
你们牺牲了自己的生命和四肢。
You sacrificed your lives, your limbs.

1071
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,608
你为你的国家受苦了。
You've suffered that for your country.

1072
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,905
政府把他们赶出了首都。
The government burned them out of the nation's capital.

1073
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,325
退伍军人从未得到过任何福利。
Veterans never got one benefit.

1074
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:57,998
除了你们这些家伙，还有谁为这个国家，为这部法律，为这部宪法，流血牺牲了?
Who in the hell has done all the bleeding for this country, and for this law, and this Constitution anyhow, but you fellows?

1075
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,750
汤姆，它毁了新闻片。
Tom, it ruined the newsreel.

1076
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,918
我很抱歉，亲爱的。我会把它换掉。
I'm so sorry, darling. I will replace that.

1077
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,378
Libby珍贵的新闻短片。
Libby's precious newsreel.

1078
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,089
我们在那里。我们和将军合影留念。
We were there. We took pictures with the general.

1079
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,634
这么英俊的男人。真是个强壮的男人。
Such a handsome man. Such a strong man.

1080
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,178
这才是一个人真正的品质。
Now that is true character in a man.

1081
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,221
汤姆的性格也很好。
Tom is also of excellent character.

1082
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,932
是的，比起政治，他更喜欢观鸟。
And, yes, he prefers birding to politics.

1083
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,684
但它是有意义的。
But it's meaningful.

1084
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,561
你说你会回来的。
You said you'd come back.

1085
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:22,814
为什么?这样你就可以离开我了?
Why? So you could leave me?

1086
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:28,236
我不知道我是不是一场短暂的冒险或者你有没有想过我，瓦莱丽。
I didn't know if I was a fleeting adventure or if you even thought about me at all, Valerie.

1087
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,907
我从没想过别人。不是真的。
I never thought of anyone else. Not really.

1088
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,284
你呢?
What about you?

1089
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,579
不。不是真的。
No. Not really.

1090
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:39,915
真的吗?
Really?

1091
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,084
是的。
Yes.

1092
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,021
你说"尴尬"是什么意思?
And what did you mean, "embarrassed"?

1093
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,085
你这话是什么意思?
What did you mean by that?

1094
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,174
这么多年都不好意思联系我?
Embarrassed to contact me all these years?

1095
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,512
只是看到我这个样子。我…这不是我在阿姆斯特丹时的样子。
Just seeing me like this. I... It's not who I was in Amsterdam.

1096
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,180
为了什么?为了什么?
And for what? For what?

1097
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,099
在这个国家我们不能在一起。
We can't be together in this country.

1098
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,190
你看到那个花园了吗?
You see that garden?

1099
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,361
我每天至少在外面待一个小时。
I spend at least an hour out there every day.

1100
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,946
-哦，太好了。毫米。
- Oh, that's great. - Mm.

1101
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:18,870
看到玫瑰胸脯的巨嘴鸟，黑眼睛的junco，让我想起上帝的绿色大地。
See a rose-breasted grosbeak, a dark-eyed junco, reminds me of God's green earth.

1102
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,038
嗯。
Hmm.

1103
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:37,514
是啊，我不认识那些鸟。但是…有一个来自英国的人违反了观鸟的所有神圣规则，他进入了一种濒临灭绝的鸟类的24个巢穴，取下了24个鸟蛋。
Yeah, I don't know those birds. But... There's this man from England who has violated every sacred rule of birding by going into 24 nests of a near-extinct species of bird to take 24 eggs.

1104
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:43,979
这一切都是为了一个人的自私荣耀为了让他的名字因为一些毫无意义的发现而出现在鸟类书籍上。
All for one man's selfish glorification to get his name in a bird book for some meaningless discovery.

1105
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:52,237
我认为，这种人，很可能会对比尔·米金斯和他的女儿做出可怕的事。
And that is the type of person, I think, who very likely did something awful to Bill Meekins and his daughter.

1106
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,381
我正试着跟你走呢，先生。
I'm trying to follow you here, sir.

1107
00:58:53,405 --> 00:59:01,246
你是说那个人，那个鸟，英格兰，那个巢，还有那本书，是他杀了比尔·米金斯?
You're saying that man, the bird thing, England, the nest, and the book, that he killed Bill Meekins?

1108
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,958
我只是想说明一点。是吗?
I'm trying to make a point. Yeah?

1109
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,793
那种男人。
That type of man.

1110
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,089
好的。我还是不确定。你是什么意思?
Okay. I'm still not certain. What do you mean?

1111
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:16,845
伯伦森医生，你的药和老兵让你看起来是个好人。
Dr. Berendsen, you seem like a good person with your medicines and your veterans.

1112
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,599
你不应该被阻碍。你应该得到帮助。
You shouldn't be hindered. You should be helped.

1113
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:27,272
-但我只是一个人。-长官，我们什么都没做，我们要让警察知道这一点。
- But I'm only one person. - Sir, we didn't do anything, and we need the police to know that.

1114
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,151
也许Dillenbeck。
Maybe Dillenbeck.

1115
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,324
明天好吗?
Tomorrow?

1116
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,427
你明天能再来吗?房子将是空的。
Can you come back tomorrow? The house will be empty.

1117
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:42,412
他们会去另一个家参加莉比的文化讲座，谢谢。
They'll be at the other house for one of Libby's culture talks, please.

1118
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,916
嘘。
Shush.

1119
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,210
“嘘”是什么意思?你们在做什么?
What do you mean, "shush"? What are you guys doing?

1120
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,713
我一直在讨论英国鸟类协会的罪行。
I've been discussing crimes of the bird society of England.

1121
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,673
你哥哥有点古怪。
Your brother's a little kooky.

1122
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:57,260
伯特，我不知道发生了什么，但这绝不是米金斯和他女儿的事。
Burt, I don't know what's happening, but it's far beyond Meekins and his daughter.

1123
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,763
我现在也不相信我的药物了。
And I don't trust my medications now either.

1124
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,975
我们只要找到迪伦贝克就行了。就是这样。
We just have to get Dillenbeck. That's it.

1125
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,061
太好了，带我一起去。
Great, take me with you.

1126
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,563
-瓦莱丽。-我可以来。我可以帮忙。
- Valerie. - I can come. I can help.

1127
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,650
-她可以。这是真的。——伯特。
- She can. It's true. - Burt.

1128
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,401
我们三个，形影不离。
The three of us, we were inseparable.

1129
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,780
我们做事，我们做事，最重要的是，我们活着。
We did things, we got things done, and most of all, we lived.

1130
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:21,076
——哈罗德?-我必须离开这里-求你了-她说得对。
- Harold? - I have to get out of here, - please! - She's right.

1131
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,703
——伯特。她可以帮助我们。-我可以帮忙。
- Burt. She could help us. - I can help.

1132
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:24,788
瓦莱丽?
Valerie?

1133
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:25,997
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1134
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,642
是时候把你的朋友叫到门口了。
It's time to get your friends to the door.

1135
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,334
马林医生要来了。
Dr. Malin's coming.

1136
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,382
谢谢你能来。抱歉给您添麻烦了。
Thank you for coming. Sorry for the trouble.

1137
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,510
谢谢你！这是非常有用的。
Thank you. This turned out very helpful.

1138
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,886
很期待。
Looking forward to this.

1139
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,722
请代我向卡尔顿告别。
Please say goodbye to Carlton for me.

1140
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,352
谢谢你！回头再聊。
Thank you. Talk to you soon.

1141
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,442
瓦莱丽?
Valerie?

1142
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,071
玛琳医生会带着你要的药过来，记得吗?
Dr. Malin will be here with the remedies you asked for, remember?

1143
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,201
你是马林医生吗?
Are you Dr. Malin?

1144
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:04,744
是的。是的，我是。
Yes. Yes, I am.

1145
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:10,500
哦，我是医生。如果你不介意我问一下，以你的专业意见，她的情况如何?
Oh, I'm a doctor. If you don't mind my asking, in your professional opinion, what is her condition?

1146
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,545
遗传性神经紊乱。
Hereditary nervous disorder.

1147
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,674
影响她的血压，平衡，神经和动作。
Affects her blood pressure, her balance, her nerves and movement.

1148
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,218
不，她以前没得过，医生。
No, she never had that before, Doctor.

1149
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,554
它随着年龄的增长而增长。
It advances with age.

1150
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,432
-谢谢。-谢谢你，医生。
- Thank you. - Thank you, Doctor.

1151
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,814
我的上帝。
My God.

1152
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,357
真不敢相信我们见到了瓦莱丽。
I can't believe we saw Valerie.

1153
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,651
-明天第一件事…-她看起来很好。
- First thing tomorrow... - She looks great.

1154
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,589
第一件事……真倒霉，她得了那种病。
First thing... Such bad luck, she got that ailment.

1155
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,532
我们去迪伦贝克，希望能进去。
We go to Dillenbeck's, and we hope we get in.

1156
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,118
迪伦贝克说不行，伯特。
Dillenbeck said no, Burt.

1157
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,453
Dillenbeck说不?
Dillenbeck said no?

1158
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,472
什么叫他拒绝了?你和他谈过了吗?
What do you mean, he said no? Did you talk to him?

1159
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,789
我和他妻子谈过了。
I talked to his wife.

1160
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,833
她说没有。他们的游客太多了。
She said no. They get too many visitors.

1161
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,085
我们……我们必须继续努力。
We... We have to keep trying.

1162
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:58,840
你有没有把……我们见面时的照片?
Uh, did you send, uh, the... the... the photographs of when we met him?

1163
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:02,469
不行，因为你得自己带照片来。
No, because you have to bring the pictures yourself.

1164
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,803
好吧，哈罗德在哪儿?
All right, where is Harold?

1165
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,531
他本该带我去迪伦贝克家的。
He was supposed to take me to Dillenbeck's.

1166
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,265
他几小时前就该来了。
He was meant to be here hours ago.

1167
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,350
我不知道。
I don't know.

1168
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:11,937
但警察来了，他们想和你谈谈。

好的。好吧，一切都要一起来。

厄玛·圣克莱尔也在等着。

1171
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,863
哦,上帝!好吧。

1172
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:26,493
嗯…现在不行。不是现在。

1173
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,873
-哦，得了吧。-你确定这里安全吗，瓦莱丽?-是的，很安全。它很好。
- Oh, come on. - Are you sure - this is safe, Valerie? - Yes, it's safe. It's fine.

他们在另一栋房子里。他们会在那里呆一整天。

1182
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,950

01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,715
把它给我。把它给我。

我下次再做吧。朋友是干什么用的?
Let me do that next time. What are friends for?

1195
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,018
我想不会再有下次了。
I think there will be no next time.

1196
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,269
听我说。
Listen to me.

1197
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,396
我们可能要关闭你的办公室了。
We might have to close down your office.

1198
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,357
莱姆，把办公室关了?

1199
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,317
是的，关闭你的办公室，是的。
Yeah, close down your office, yeah.

1200
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,610
我们需要确凿的证据。
We need hard evidence.

1201
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:45,321
希尔兹警探，你不明白。
Detective Hiltz, look, you don't understand.

1202
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,198
我和莱姆，这个和这个。

1203

告诉他，莱姆。

1204
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:52,370
没错，我们的血液里，大脑里都有金属。想象一下。
Exactly, we got metal in our blood, in our brain. Imagine that.

1205
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,164
你的足弓很平。
You have flat arches.

1206
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,958
你不能发球。我们理解。
You couldn't serve. We understand.

1207
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,269
你们还是我们的头号嫌疑人。
You're still our chief suspects.

1208
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,294
为什么?

1209
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,547
为什么?你知道，你知道这不是我们干的。
Why? You know, you know we didn't do this.

1210
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,923
不，所有人都说是你干的。
No, everyone says you did it.

1211
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:07,010
每个人都说吗?每一个…有一个人。

1212
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,344
-是的。-他做到了。
- Yeah. - He did it.

1213
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:12,640
现在我的队长需要知道你为什么要，秘密地对父亲进行尸检。
Now my captain needs to know why you did that, uh, hush-hush autopsy on the father.

1214
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,684
这件事没有什么秘密可言。
There was nothing hush-hush about it.

1215
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:18,313
莉兹·米金斯授权的。完全合法的。
Liz Meekins authorized it. Completely legal.

1216
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,689
哈罗德可以证实。
Harold can verify that.

1217
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,024
让我们看看尸检结果。
Let's see the autopsy results.

1218
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,544
是的，让我把厄玛·圣克莱尔的尸检报告拿过来。
Yes, let me get the autopsy from Irma St. Clair right in here.

1219
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:27,280
对不起，医生。在海外，我知道他们有增强力量的药物。
Excuse me, Doctor. Overseas, I understand that they have medicines for strength.

1220
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,199
你这里有什么东西可以增强体力吗?
Do you got anything here for strength?

1221
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,909
——什么?——权力?权力。
- What? - Power? Power.

1222
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,221
能给我验尸报告吗是的,但是……-来自Irma St. claire…-希尔兹，等等。
Can I get the autopsy report... Yeah, but... - from Irma St. Clair... - Hiltz, wait.

1223
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,598
城里最好的验尸护士之一?
One of the best autopsy nurses in the city?

1224
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,915
谢谢你！是的，谢谢。
Thank you. Yes, thank you.

1225
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,042
乐观。
Optimism.

1226
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:44,923
我知道自从上次见面后我们都过得很不寻常。
I understand we both had a very unusual time since last we saw each other.

1227
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,716
发生了什么事?
What happened?

1228
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,802
你的外套为什么披在肩上?
Why is your coat over your shoulder?

1229
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,845
这就是我想告诉你的。
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1230
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:55,850
我在提交尸检结果的时候，这个满脸通红的人，一脸怒气……-天啊。
I was filing the autopsy results when this red-faced man - with an angry face... - Oh, God.

1231
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,977
-还有另一个人…-怎么了?
- And this other man... - What happened?

1232
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:03,608
他们把我推倒，打断了我的手腕，然后拿到了尸检结果。
They threw me down, they broke my wrist, and they took the autopsy results.

1233
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,984
他们拿走了一切。
They took everything.

1234
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,778
-但那不是…-做得不好。
- But it wasn't... - That's not well done.

1235
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,029
-我知道。-那是有角度的。
- I know. - That is angulated.

1236
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,657
这需要重新设置，否则情况会非常糟糕。
That needs to be reset, or else that is gonna be very bad.

1237
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,951
嗯…-可以吗?——好的。
Uh... - Can I? - Okay.

1238
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,154
我来帮你拿外套。-让我坐下。谢谢你！
- Let me take your coat. - Let me sit down. Thank you.

1239
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,871
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

1240
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,752
不，这不是…不是一份好工作。
No, this is not... not a good job.

1241
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,546
就是这样。等一等。两个。
That's it. Hold on. Two more.

1242
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:30,802
有一次，你告诉我你是否喜欢西班牙的旋律…——什么?——还是古典音乐?
One time, you were telling me whether you like the Spanish melody... - What? - or was it classical?

1243
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:35,765
经典……就是这样。就是这样。
Classical... That's it. That's it.

1244
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,851
全部完成。没关系。
All done. It's okay.

1245
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:41,521
没关系。好了。
It's okay. All right now.

1246
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,772
——好吗?——是的。
- Okay? - Yes.

1247
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,732
就是这样。我得找个吊绳。
That's it. I gotta get a sling.

1248
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,026
-保持支撑。——是的。
- Just keep that supported. - Yes.

1249
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,988
我很抱歉把你卷进来了。
I'm so sorry that you got mixed up in all this.

1250
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:51,698
我是验尸护士。
I'm an autopsy nurse.

1251
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,575
我卷入了各种各样的事情。
I get mixed up in all sorts of things.

1252
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:56,077
而且，让我离你更近了…
Besides, brought me closer to you and to...

1253
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,456
他们在等我们。
They're waiting for us.

1254
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,585
让他们等待。
Let them wait.

1255
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,387
他为什么在放音乐?
Why is he playing music?

1256
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,471
他喜欢音乐。
He likes music.

1257
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,891
我不知道他现在为什么要弹。
I don't know why he's playing it now.

1258
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,393
你喜欢这种音乐吗?
Do you like this music?

1259
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,355
我吗?我不知道。
Me? I don't know.

1260
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:11,736
比阿特丽斯。
Beatrice.

1261
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:14,989
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

1262
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,449
这个女人是谁?
Who is this woman?

1263
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,037
这是厄玛。我们一起工作。
This is Irma. We work together.

1264
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,372
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

1265
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,918
她是…她是验尸护士。
She's, uh... She's an autopsy nurse.

1266
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,086
别跟我胡扯。
Don't give me that.

1267
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,004
回家。
Come home.

1268
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,590
我会违抗我的家人，这样我们就能在一起了。
I'll defy my family so we can be together.

1269
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:33,883
这是真的吗?
Is this real?

1270
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,636
你为什么偏偏现在在这里?
Why are you here now, of all times?

1271
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,304
你从没来过这里。
Like, you never come here.

1272
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:42,254
因为雪莉是站在我这边的，她会给我打电话告诉我什么时候该保护我丈夫。
'Cause Shirley's on my side, and she calls me and tells me when to protect my husband.

1273
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,619
我父亲控制着你的行医执照
My father controls your medical license.

1274
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:45,979
你知道的。
You know that.

1275
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:58,491
你能让你父母在退伍军人晚会的委员会上签名吗，这样我们就能获得尊重和尊严，你也可以告诉你父母汤姆·沃兹可能会参与进来?
Can you get your parents to put their names on the committee for the gala for the veterans, so we can get respect and dignity, and you can tell your parents that Tom Voze might, uh, get involved?

1276
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,743
嗯，是的。
Well, uh, yes.

1277
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,471
但你要怎么抓到他?你抓不到他的。
But how will you get him? You won't get him.

1278
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,538
我见过他了。
I already met him.

1279
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,082
我介绍过你。
I introduced you.

1280
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:12,422
你没介绍我们认识。你跟我们说了他的事，然后我和哈罗德见了他。
Well, you didn't introduce us. You told us about him, and then me and Harold, we met him.

1281
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,300
真的很抱歉，伯特。
Really sorry, Burt.

1282
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:20,263
我觉得你应该想想你是谁，你想成为什么。
I think you should think about who you are and what you want to be.

1283
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,110
雪莉。不是有益的。
Shirley. Not helpful.

1284
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:35,945
我们需要一个吊绳!
We need a sling!

1285
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,363
尸检结果呢?
Where are the autopsy results?

1286
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:43,536
莱姆，她很可能是被推利兹·米金斯的那个人推的。-我拿到弹弓了。
She was rolled, Lem, quite possibly by the same man - who pushed Liz Meekins. - I got the sling.

1287
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,372
我可以给你描述一下。他大概……你是说它们被偷了?
I can give you a description. He was about... You mean, they're stolen?

1288
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,623
是的，它们被偷了。
Yes, they were stolen.

1289
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,751
那么，结果如何呢?
So, what about the results?

1290
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,711
我可以告诉你结果。我记得他们。
I can tell you the results. I remember them.

1291
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:57,216
我在他的胃里发现了水银，鲁米诺和安眠药，含量很高。
I found mercury, luminol, and somnifene in his stomach, and they were in high amounts.

1292
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,053
我相信是在他生命的最后一周给他的。
I believe they were given to him the last week of his life.

1293
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,222
上周，也就是说可能在船上。
Last week, which means probably on the boat.

1294
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,426
所以我们没有东西可以给队长，对吧?
So, we don't have anything to give our captain, right?

1295
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,353
她刚把证据给你了。
She just gave you the evidence.

1296
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,481
我可以给你一份宣誓书。我一直都在做。
I can give you an affidavit. I do them all the time.

1297
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,648
我被这座城市束缚住了。
I'm bonded by the city.

1298
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:13,900
怎么样?对吧?
How about that? Right?

1299
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,210
-我是说，我们正在做…-还有认证。
- I mean, we are doing... - And certified.

1300
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,736
是的。我们在为你做你的工作。
Yes. We're doing your job for you.

1301
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,446
那死去的女儿呢?
What about the dead daughter?

1302
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,530
把这家伙扔进监狱。
Throw this guy in jail.

1303
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:20,865
让我来处理。
Let me handle this.

1304
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,076
——登月舱。登月舱,登月舱。-这是什么…请不要碰那个。
- Lem. Lem, Lem. - What's this... Please do not touch that.

1305
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,911
-堕落的茶具?-那是艺术。
- Degenerate tea set? - That is art.

1306
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,513
你得把这个处理掉。它是淫秽的。
You gotta get rid of this. It's obscene.

1307
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,890
-那是艺术。-不，那不是艺术
- That's art. - No, that's not art.

1308
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,750
艺术是美丽的，可爱的，发人深省的。
Art is beautiful, lovely, evokes thoughts.

1309
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,876
就是这样。
That's what that is.

1310
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:33,795
-是这样吗?——是的。
- That's what that is? - Yes.

1311
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,924
为什么你要拿一套茶具，一个可爱的茶具，把它变成暴力工具?
Why would you take a tea set, a lovely tea set, and turn it into an instrument of violence?

1312
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,777
-问得好。-这没道理。
- That's a good question. - It makes no sense.

1313
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,428
莱姆，也许是世纪问题。
Perhaps, Lem, the question of the century.

1314
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,973
不要想太多。
Don't think about it too much.

1315
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,308
——登月舱。——伯特。
- Lem. - Burt.

1316
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:49,477
莱姆，友情在哪里?
Lem, where is the camaraderie?

1317
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,646
我们在阿贡河。让我们活下去。
We were in the Argonne. Let's live.

1318
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,606
Voulons温文尔雅。
Voulons vivre.

1319
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,733
新药丸。记住这一点。
New pill. Remember this.

1320
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:56,943
Souviens-toi。
Souviens-toi.

1321
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,778
-你欠我的。——好的。
- You owe me. - Okay.

1322
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,279
但你也欠我的。
But you owe me too.

1323
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,574
把哈罗德和利兹·米金斯的合同给我。
Get me Harold's contract with Liz Meekins.

1324
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,410
我会的。
I will.

1325
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,162
真理是可能的。
Truth is possible.

1326
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:12,834
我想，爱，也许，甚至是可能的。
And I think that love, maybe, is even possible.

1327
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,461
这个药丸起作用了。
And this pill is working.

1328
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,716
真理，爱，还是什么?
Truth, love, what?

1329
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,680
哈罗德有辆车。我只有一只眼睛。
Harold has the car. I only got one eye.

1330
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,849
-他们不让我开车。-我们会找到他们的
- They don't let me drive. - We'll find them.

1331
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:28,933
没关系。
It's okay.

1332
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:40,445
西班牙夫人，我崇拜你从我第一次见到你的那一晚起我的心就一直渴望着你我还能做什么呢?
Lady of Spain, I adore you Right from the night I first saw you My heart has been yearning for you What else could any heart do?

1333
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:44,031
西班牙夫人，我爱你天哪。
Lady of Spain, I love you Oh, my God.

1334
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,075
这听起来很棒。拉里。
This sounds terrific. Larry.

1335
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,702
它没有被取消，对吧?
It's not canceled, right?

1336
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:48,786
不是取消了吧?
It's not canceled, is it?

1337
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,550
-绝对没有取消。-哦，谢谢。
- Definitely not canceled. - Oh, thank you.

1338
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,999
同学聚会太棒了，你要唱歌。
The reunion is a gem, and you're gonna sing.

1339
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,126
我们要表演了!
We are going to perform!

1340
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,046
你要小心。
You be careful.

1341
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,215
弥尔顿!
Milton!

1342
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,553
哈罗德几小时前就该来我办公室了。
Harold was supposed to be at my office hours ago.

1343
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,472
你没事吧?你看起来不太好。
You okay? You don't look good.

1344
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,974
事情变得越来越复杂了，不是吗?
Things have gotten more complicated, haven't they?

1345
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,019
你知道吗，我祖父朝一个人的脸开了一枪。
You know, my grandfather shot a guy in the face.

1346
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,271
他的脸中枪了。
And he got shot in the face.

1347
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,564
不同场合。
Separate occasions.

1348
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,232
不同场合。不是同一个人。
Separate occasions. Not the same guy.

1349
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,151
一切都解决了。
And it all worked out.

1350
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,361
——好。-走吧。
- Good. - Let's go.

1351
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,198
Burt博士。伯特。我神经紧绷。
Dr. Burt. Burt. I got a pinched nerve.

1352
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,326
不,我……我…我还不知道该怎么办。
No, I'm... I... I don't know what to do with that yet.

1353
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,786
我们可以在那里。好的,很好。
We can be right there. Okay, good.

1354
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,333
你去哪儿了?我担心死了。
Where have you been? I've been worried sick.

1355
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,668
我们开车去兜风，发现了很多东西。
We went on a drive and found out a lot of things.

1356
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:43,591
你本来要去见吉尔·迪伦贝克的，却不能开车出去。
Well, you're not supposed to go for a drive, when you're supposed to meet Gil Dillenbeck.

1357
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:47,178
警察在等你答应他们的文件。
And the police are waiting on papers that you promised them.

1358
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,471
有人扇你耳光了吗，伯特?
Did someone slap you, Burt?

1359
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,223
因为你脸上有一块红印。
'Cause you have a red mark on your face.

1360
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,519
我摔倒了，我被扇了耳光，我…卡尔顿打了我一拳。
I fell, I got slapped, I got... Carlton punched me.

1361
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:55,853
是啊，我当时在场。
Yeah, I was there for that one.

1362
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,730
我们也被打了。
We got roughed up too.

1363
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,315
我们的处境很尴尬。
We were in quite a situation.

1364
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,026
求你了，现在不行。在车里。
Please, not now. In the car.

1365
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:05,279
米尔顿，把这些拿给盖特韦勒警探。好吧?
Milton, get these to Detective Getweiler. All right?

1366
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,865
这是莉斯·米金斯的雇佣合同。
This is Liz Meekins's employment contract.

1367
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:12,537
我有说过我预言过一个被关在盒子里的白人会带来极大的麻烦吗?
Did I mention that I predicted extreme trouble from a white man in a box?

1368
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:19,252
然后被一个卡车下的白人女人加了进去。
Then added to by a white woman under a truck.

1369
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,670
重点是什么，弥尔顿?
The point, Milton?

1370
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:25,800
你知道吗，我宁愿因为杀了五个白人男人而受审，而不是一个白人女人。
You know, I'd rather be on trial for killin' five white men than one white woman.

1371
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:30,680
因为这会导致一个或多个黑人死在盒子里。
'Cause this can lead to one Black man or more dead in a box.

1372
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:32,932
拜托，我们走吧。
Please, let's get going.

1373
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,810
我们几小时前就该去迪伦贝克家了。
We should've left for Dillenbeck's hours ago.

1374
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:40,273
这是我们摆脱警察困境的唯一希望。
That's the only hope that we have to get out of this situation with the police.

1375
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,191
我们为什么停在这里?
Why are we stopping here?

1376
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:43,401
这里不是巴克斯县。
This is not Bucks County.

1377
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,753
这还没出城呢。
This is not even out of the city.

1378
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,904
我们要在华尔道夫酒店稍作停留。
We're making a quick stop at the Waldorf.

1379
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,155
迪伦贝克在华尔道夫吗?
Is Dillenbeck at the Waldorf?

1380
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,466
我们不是来见迪伦贝克的。
We're not here to see Dillenbeck.

1381
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,530
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1382
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,135
我们在这里做什么?哈罗德,瓦莱丽!
What are we doing here? Harold, Valerie!

1383
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,078
难以置信!
Unbelievable!

1384
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,305
先生，欢迎光临华尔道夫酒店。
Welcome to the Waldorf Astoria, sir.

1385
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,641
还要多久……我们不会住在华尔道夫的。
How long will... We're not staying at the Waldorf.

1386
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,584
我们今天只有一件事要做，哈罗德。
We had one thing to do today, Harold.

1387
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,752
一件事。试着和吉尔·迪伦贝克谈谈。
One thing. Try to talk to Gil Dillenbeck.

1388
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:06,483
也许还会有个活动…-这就是我的情况…-尊严和…我们今天看到的，伯特。
And maybe have an event with a modicum... - This is my situation... - of dignity and... from my past that we saw today, Burt.

1389
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,527
被扭曲的是我内心的平静，伯特。
And it's my peace of mind that's been twisted, Burt.

1390
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,196
在我们弄清真相之前，迪伦贝克帮不了我们。
Dillenbeck can't help us until we know what's really going on.

1391
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,722
这是怎么回事?
Well, what is going on?

1392
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,682
我不知道，但我们会查出来的。
I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

1393
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:15,766
把钥匙给我。
Give me the keys.

1394
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:16,910
-绝对不行。-给我钥匙。
- Absolutely not. - Give me the keys.

1395
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,437
你不能开车。你不会开车，你这个独眼疯子。
You're not driving. You can't drive, you one-eyed nut.

1396
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,356
哈罗德，这可不明智。
Harold, this is not smart.

1397
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:26,986
至少告诉我这是谁。
At least, just tell me who we're seeing here.

1398
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:28,988
保罗·坎特伯雷。
Paul Canterbury.

1399
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,282
保罗·坎特伯雷?
Paul Canterbury?

1400
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,534
-是的。是的。-那个玻璃眼的家伙?
- Yeah. Yeah. - The glass-eye guy?

1401
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,494
从阿姆斯特丹。恩人吗?
From Amsterdam. The benefactor?

1402
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:37,496
她还在和他们说话，伯特。
She still talks to them, Burt.

1403
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,377
-你好，保罗。-瓦莱丽，你好吗?
- Hello, Paul. - Oh, Valerie, how are you?

1404
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:44,503
给你。
There you are.

1405
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,547
哈罗德。
Harold.

1406
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:47,840
保罗·坎特伯雷。
Paul Canterbury.

1407
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,009
伯伦森，你好吗?
Berendsen, how are you?

1408
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:54,221
给你。深褐色的绿色。
Here you go. Dark hazel green.

1409
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,599
——嗯。-一盒六个。
- Eh. - Box of six.

1410
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:58,684
你真是太好了。谢谢你！
Very kind of you. Thank you.

1411
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,270
啊!
Ah!

1412
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:02,938
这是喝茶时间。
It's teatime.

1413
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,192
只有我喜欢红葡萄酒吗?
Is it just me who fancies claret?

1414
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:09,111
我喜欢一手拿着它，一手拿着茶。
I like to have it going in one hand and tea in the other.

1415
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,197
我们现在有点困境，保罗。
We're in a bit of a predicament, Paul.

1416
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,907
谢谢你抽出时间来见我们。
Thank you for taking the time to see us.

1417
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:18,245
瓦莱丽，作为绅士，我们愿意做任何必须做的事。
Valerie, we're prepared to do anything we must as gentlemen.

1418
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,413
你粗鲁的人!
You bounder!

1419
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,540
你作弊!你真让我恶心!
You cheat! You disgust me!

1420
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,459
历史会救赎我的。
History will redeem me.

1421
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,543
才不会呢。
Like hell it will.

1422
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,004
对不起,每一个人。
Sorry, everyone.

1423
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,342
没关系。酒水我请。字面上。
It's all right. Drinks on me. Literally.

1424
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,012
你好。这边请。
Hello. This way, please.

1425
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:43,979
你记得亨利·诺克罗斯吗?他是那个美国人……他们不需要谈论的联邦雇员，否则我相信他们不会在这里。
You remember Henry Norcross? He's the American... Federal employee they don't need to talk about, or I trust they wouldn't be here.

1426
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:53,030
这一切与英国的“玻璃生意”和华盛顿的融资有什么关系?
What does all of this have to do with a "glass business" in England and, uh, financing in Washington?

1427
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,323
它们是重叠的。
Well, they overlap.

1428
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,676
有很多事情是重叠的，伯伦森。
Lots of things overlap, Berendsen.

1429
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,204
如果你仔细观察，整个世界以最危险的方式重叠在一起。
The whole world overlaps in its most treacherous way if you pay attention.

1430
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,374
你们好，伯特，哈罗德，瓦莱丽。
And hello, Burt, Harold, Valerie.

1431
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,185
-你好，亨利。-你气色不错，亨利
- Hello, Henry. - You're looking good, Henry.

1432
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:10,548
我也很高兴在我们再次聚集在历史正确的一边时见到你们。嗯?
It's good to see you too as we gather here once more on the right side of history. Huh?

1433
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:15,803
保罗，我知道刚才在茶馆有人把饮料泼到你脸上了。——是的。
Paul, I understand you had a drink thrown in your face - in the tea court just now. - Yes.

1434
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,013
只是英格兰的一些旧事，亨利。
Just some old business from England, Henry.

1435
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,474
不，不，不。在你脸上喝一杯就是在我脸上喝一杯。
No, no, no. A drink in your face is a drink in my face.

1436
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:21,660
我想听一听。
I'd like to hear about it, please.

1437
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:23,227
然后我们再谈别的事。
Then we'll get on to new business.

1438
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,897
他是英国鸟类学会的人。
It was someone from the Ornithological Society of Great Britain.

1439
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,941
那些混蛋中的一个，是吧?
Ah, one of those rotten bastards, huh?

1440
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,360
是的。
Yeah.

1441
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,029
什么?
What?

1442
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:39,535
有人给我讲了一个发生在英国鸟类协会的坏事。
I was told a story about a misdeed in the bird society of England.

1443
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,414
我开始怀疑那个故事是不是关于你的。
And I'm starting to wonder if that story is about you.

1444
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:46,125
我们的发现绝非微不足道。
Our discovery was hardly trivial.

1445
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:51,422
是的，我们证明了布谷鸟缺乏建造自己巢穴的能力，礼貌和性格。
Yes, we proved that the cuckoo lacks the capacity, the civility, the character to build its own nest.

1446
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:52,506
哇。
Wow.

1447
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:58,804
这对任何人或任何事来说有什么意义或有趣的呢?
How is that possibly significant or interesting to anybody or anything?

1448
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,474
因为这表明杜鹃是一种寄生鸟。
Because it shows that the cuckoo is a parasitic bird.

1449
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,101
它欺骗了那些筑巢的好鸟。
It tricks better birds who build nests.

1450
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:08,481
布谷鸟破坏宿主的蛋，然后破坏巢穴本身。
Cuckoo destroys the host's eggs, and then destroys the nest itself.

1451
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,358
伯伦森，布谷鸟根本不在乎。好吗?
Berendsen, the cuckoo doesn't give a damn. Okay?

1452
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:17,740
我想说，这是对自然界包括人类在内的寄生破坏行为的深刻阐述。-听着，听着。
I'd say it's a profound statement on the parasitic destructive behavior of nature, - including humans. - Hear, hear.

1453
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,534
在我们今天看到的事情之后，这一点尤其正确。
That is especially true after what we saw today.

1454
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,662
伯特，这是关于我们遭遇的故事。听好了。
Burt, it's the story about what happened to us. Listen up.

1455
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,289
我们一直想告诉你，伯特。
We have been trying to tell you, Burt.

1456
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:27,625
我觉得保罗和亨利也该听听。
And I think Paul and Henry should hear this too.

1457
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:31,504
但我们今天去了一个很奇怪的诊所发现了这个。
But we ended up at a very strange clinic today and we found this.

1458
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,382
这些符号到处都是。
Those symbols were everywhere.

1459
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,843
你以前见过吗?
Have you seen it before?

1460
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,345
五人委员会。
The Committee of the Five.

1461
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:46,310
按照我们的约定，我去见了瓦莱丽，但我们注意到有人在监视我们。
I went to see Valerie as we'd arranged, but then we noticed somebody was watching us.

1462
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:48,153
有人隔着窗帘看着我们。
Someone was watching us through the curtains.

1463
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,148
就是他推了莉斯·米金斯。
That's the man who pushed Liz Meekins.

1464
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:56,028
他一定是等得不耐烦了因为他要走了，然后我们决定跟踪他。
And he must've got bored waiting because he started to leave, and then we decided to follow him.

1465
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,822
他带我们去了罗克兰县。
And he led us to Rockland County.

1466
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,783
去了一栋没有标志的砖房。
To an unmarked brick building.

1467
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,603
他们以为我们是做手术的病人。
They assumed that we were patients for a procedure.

1468
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,128
消毒。
To be sterilized.

1469
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,256
强制绝育诊所。
Ah, a forced sterilization clinic.

1470
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,757
然后我看到了那个人。
Then I saw the man.

1471
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,718
这个红脸男人。推利兹·米金斯的人。
This red-faced man. The man who pushed Liz Meekins.

1472
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:24,014
他看着我，然后说…这是你结束自卑的时刻。
He looked right at me, and he said... This is your moment to end your inferiority.

1473
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:25,683
你要做这个手术。
You're gonna have that procedure.

1474
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,147
不要动!
Don't move!

1475
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:35,568
大便。
Shit.

1476
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:39,405
谁去叫船长!
Somebody call the captain!

1477
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,117
-来吧。-阻止那些人!
- Come on. - Stop those people!

1478
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,035
——帮助!我们需要帮助!-叫舰长!
- Help! We need help! - Call the captain!

1479
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:51,792
瓦莱丽的枪走火的时候，打中了一块玻璃，我们离开了那里，回城里去了。-天啊。
Well, when Valerie's gun finally went off, it hit a glass, and we got out of there - and headed back to the city. - My God.

1480
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,753
我很高兴你没事。
Well, I'm glad you're all right.

1481
01:17:54,837 --> 01:18:00,426
但如果你没有拿到红脸杀手的身份证明，那就毫无用处了。
But if you didn't get the red-faced killer's identification, then it's of no help, whatsoever.

1482
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,844
你在说什么，伯特?
What are you talking about, Burt?

1483
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,446
它与一切都有关系。
It has everything to do with everything.

1484
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,973
今天，所发生的一切，不得不……——如何?-从我开始。
Today, that what happened, has to... - How? - It starts with me.

1485
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:07,141
好吧，从我开始。
Well, it starts with me.

1486
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:14,481
我告诉德克萨斯州朗维尤的一些朋友，不要去这个非常恐怖的诊所，就像我们今天看到的那样。
I told some friends in Longview, Texas, not to visit this very horrifying clinic, a lot like the one we saw today.

1487
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,484
一群暴徒。一群白人追我。
A mob. A mob of white men chased me.

1488
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,153
他们骚扰我。他们想杀我。
They harassed me. They tried to kill me.

1489
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,239
他们没有成功。他们非常不成功。
They were unsuccessful. They were very unsuccessful.

1490
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,658
我离开了德州朗维尤，再也没回头。
I left Longview, Texas, and I never looked back.

1491
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:30,080
不只是你和德州的事，也不只是今天洛克兰的事。
It's not just about you and Texas, nor today in Rockland.

1492
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,960
有一个组织希望在全世界范围内这样做。
There is an organization that wishes to do this all over the world.

1493
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,630
这是什么意思?
What does it mean?

1494
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:46,597
这意味着这个国家有一个阴谋集团和德国的另一个阴谋集团有联系他们支持这些诊所，想要统治世界。
It means there's a cabal in this country tied to another in Germany who supports these clinics, who want to rule the world.

1495
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,183
统治世界?
Rule the world?

1496
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,227
完全正确的。
Exactly correct.

1497
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,272
阴谋集团里有谁?
Who's in the cabal?

1498
01:18:55,689 --> 01:19:01,028
也许问谁是错误的问题。而是要问为什么。
Maybe who is the wrong question to ask. Instead ask why.

1499
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:03,864
去找迪伦贝克。
Go see Dillenbeck.

1500
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:08,452
问他为什么他的同事米金斯将军被杀了。
Ask him why his fellow, General Meekins, was murdered.

1501
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:16,001
迪伦贝克，他一直在领导这个阴谋集团想弄清楚他们是谁，有什么计划。
Dillenbeck, he's been leading on this cabal to find out who they are, what they plan.

1502
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:19,046
五人委员会。
Committee of the Five.

1503
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,549
该组织名为Der Fünf。
The organization named Der Fünf.

1504
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:24,385
五人委员会。
Committee of the Five.

1505
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,788
想弄清楚他们是谁。
Trying to figure out who they are.

1506
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,262
五人委员会。
Committee of the Five.

1507
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:28,681
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1508
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:32,184
我觉得如果迪伦贝克能在你的同学会上发言就太好了。
I think it would be wonderful if Dillenbeck was the speaker at your reunion.

1509
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:36,939
看来你的活动越来越重要了，伯伦森。
Seems your event's becoming rather important, Berendsen.

1510
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:43,946
如果你能让迪伦贝克开口，也许能吸引到阴谋集团中更有影响力的成员。
If you can get Dillenbeck to speak, perhaps it might attract more influential members of the cabal.

1511
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,783
是啊，是街上的杀手还是高层为这一切埋单。
Yeah, the killer from the street or the higher-ups paying for it all.

1512
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:48,993
等等，等等，等等，等等。
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1513
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:59,044
不。我不希望我们的活动，哈罗德和我的活动，被任何人这样利用。
No. I don't want our event, Harold's and my event, to be used like this by anybody.

1514
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,879
使用?不。
Used? No.

1515
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,967
就当这是在保护你所爱的人。
Think of it as protecting what you love.

1516
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,176
好吗?
Okay?

1517
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:09,930
我们在阿姆斯特丹告诉过你我们会来拜访你，现在我们来了。
We told you in Amsterdam we'd come a-calling, and here we are.

1518
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,974
给你。
And here you are.

1519
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,395
我们谈完了吗?
Well, we done here?

1520
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,606
还是你想多聊聊鸟类?
Or you wanna talk more about birds?

1521
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:24,862
你知道吗，很多人认为这是关于…宁静:与自然的宁静或交流
You know, a lot of people assume that it's about the, uh... the tranquility or the communion with nature.

1522
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:32,786
但我发现观鸟是如此迷人，因为它迫使你决定你在看什么。
But I find bird-watching so fascinating because it forces you to decide what you are looking at.

1523
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,874
我在磨练我的鉴别力。
I am honing my art of discernment.

1524
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:41,253
我希望你们相信我，我相信现在是干预的时候了。
And I want you to trust me that I believe now is the time to intervene.

1525
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:51,430
我们请吉尔·迪伦贝克做这次活动的演讲者，他就会像磁铁一样吸引所有的钉子把这个充满背叛的房子推倒在地。
We get Gil Dillenbeck to be the speaker at this event, he will be the magnet that draws all the nails out of the wood and brings this house of treachery down to the ground.

1526
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:52,931
你说呢，伯特?拜托。
So what do you say, Burt? Please.

1527
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,560
请你试试，伯特。
Please try, Burt.

1528
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,609
我不想说"我早告诉过你"
I don't like to say, "I told you so,"

1529
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,237
但这一切比我们所有人想象的都要大得多。
but this is all turning out to be a lot larger than any of us imagined.

1530
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,405
是的。
Yeah.

1531
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:12,034
如果晚会是保罗用的…-你没事吧?-你没事吧?
If the gala is used by Paul... - Are you okay? - You good?

1532
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,620
嗯哼。好吧。它来了又去。我很好。
Mm-hmm. Fine. It comes and goes. I'm fine.

1533
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,704
是吗?
Yeah?

1534
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:22,336
你感觉很好，然后突然眩晕，你感到头晕……它来了又去。
You feel fine, then all of a sudden, vertigo, you get dizzy... It comes and goes.

1535
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,838
首先，他们告诉我，我患有癫痫。
First, they told me that I had epilepsy.

1536
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:29,218
我从来没有发作过，但他们说我有癫痫，而且癫痫迟早会发作。
I'd never had a seizure, but they said I had epilepsy, and the seizures would come sooner or later.

1537
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,970
但如果我服用药物，这是可以避免的。
But that could be avoided if I took medication.

1538
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,138
我就这样做了。
And so I did.

1539
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:37,559
然后我开始出现其他症状，更多的症状，他们说，“这是遗传的。”
And then I started having other symptoms, more symptoms, and they said, "That's hereditary."

1540
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:38,870
“那是你母亲的遗传。”
"That's from your mother's side."

1541
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,355
所以他们给了我新的药物，我一直在服用。
So they gave me new medications, and I kept taking that.

1542
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:50,072
现在一年又一年过去了，我几乎不出家门，我感觉自己像个病人，活不下去了，我……我开始怀疑这一切了。
And now years and years have gone by and I'm barely leaving the house, and I feel like I'm a patient, and I can't live, and I... I'm starting to question all of it.

1543
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:17,724
-你没事吧?——嗯。
- You okay? - Mm-hmm.

1544
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,077
不，别碰我。别抱着我。
No, don't touch me. Don't hold me.

1545
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:26,900
我很好。我能做到，我只需要…我只是需要在这里休息一下，只是……-天啊。你好吗?——婊子。
I'm fine. I can do this, and I just need... I just need a minute here to rest, just... - Oh, God. You good? - Bitch.

1546
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:27,985
-瓦莱丽。-哦，是的。
- Valerie. - Oh, yes.

1547
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:29,403
我很好。
I'm fine.

1548
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,572
看，我在爬楼梯。
Look, I'm doing stairs.

1549
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,824
我上楼梯也不会头晕。
I can go up stairs with no vertigo.

1550
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:37,411
没有眩晕。我很好。我能跑。
No vertigo. I'm fine. I can run.

1551
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,694
-哦，天哪…瓦莱丽!-瓦莱丽!
- Oh, my... Valerie! - Valerie!

1552
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:40,807
带着那个喝醉的女人走!
Collect that drunk woman and go!

1553
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:41,832
我们认识将军。
We know the general.

1554
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:43,101
-我们有照片。-我没事，该死
- We have pictures. - I'm all right, damn it.

1555
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,460
好了，我不要那些照片。
There, I don't want the pictures.

1556
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,254
-快走!-我是医生。
- Go, now! - I'm a doctor.

1557
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:48,547
-现在就走。-我是老兵。
- Go now. - And I am a veteran.

1558
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,899
-你需要一个医生…-谢谢。
- You're gonna need a doctor... - Thank you.

1559
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,609
-等我解决了你。——呼吸。简单呼吸就好。
- When I'm through with you. - Breathe. Just breathe.

1560
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,027
快走，不然我就报警了。
Now, go or I'm gonna call the police.

1561
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,362
-就几分钟…-不，我来吧。我做的事。
- Just a few minutes... - No, I've got it. I do.

1562
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:55,613
-你丈夫的时间。——没有。
- Of your husband's time. - No.

1563
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:59,325
我一定要战胜这些症状-走了…我并没有因此而沮丧。
I have to fight through these symptoms - at some point. - There goes... I'm not getting depressed about it.

1564
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:01,143
我们洗清罪名的唯一机会。
Our one chance to clear our names.

1565
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,645
你得换药，换医生。
You have to change your medicine and your doctor.

1566
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:07,316
狗娘养的。我很好。
Son of a bitch. I was fine.

1567
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,777
也许我该走了。
Maybe it's time for me to leave anyway.

1568
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,154
离开是什么意思?
What do you mean, leave?

1569
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:16,033
就算我们三个把米金斯解决了，坐牢的还是我。
Well, even if we solve Meekins out of the three of us, I'm the one that's going to jail.

1570
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,076
-系统被操纵了。——哈罗德。
- The system's rigged. - Harold.

1571
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,705
我从一开始就告诉过你，这份工作不是个好主意。
I told you from the get-go, this job was a bad idea.

1572
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:26,460
弥尔顿告诉过你这份工作不是个好主意…
Milton told you this job was a bad idea...

1573
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,881
但她得帮我们找到工作。
but she had to get us hired.

1574
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,674
哦,“她”吗?“她得去……”
Oh, "she"? "She had to get..."

1575
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,404
"她"还把你从监狱里救了出来，你好像忘了很多。
"She" also got you out of jail, which you seem to forget a lot.

1576
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,347
你不能现在就不理我。
You can't turn your backs on me now.

1577
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,641
你违反了约定，记得吗?
You broke the pact, remember?

1578
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,935
我毁约了?什么时候?
I broke the pact? When?

1579
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,103
我们告诉过你别走，伯特。
We told you not to leave, Burt.

1580
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:50,400
至少你找到了爱，即使你得不到。
At least you found love, even if you can't get it.

1581
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,237
我从来没那么幸运知道那到底是什么。
I've never been lucky enough to even know what the hell it is.

1582
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,823
这种可怕的痛苦我不希望发生在任何人身上。
And that's a terrible affliction I don't wish on anyone.

1583
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,701
我真希望我从没找到过它。
I wish I never did find it.

1584
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,371
因为太疼了。
Because it hurts too much.

1585
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,124
等等!
Wait!

1586
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,752
将军想见你。
The general wants to meet you.

1587
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:12,589
别搞砸了。
Don't screw this up.

1588
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:13,966
-振作起来。-来吧!
- Straighten up. - Come on!

1589
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,300
扶我走。
Help me walk.

1590
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,788
之前的误会我很抱歉。
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding before.

1591
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,221
不要紧。不要紧。
Never mind. Never mind.

1592
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,224
我们这里有很多不速之客。
We get so many uninvited guests here.

1593
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,768
-当然。-我们不想见到的人。
- Of course. - People we don't want to see.

1594
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:26,603
-对不起。-谢谢。
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.

1595
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,063
我没醉。
I'm not drunk.

1596
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:31,566
小姐，你怎么了?你还好吗?
Uh, young lady, what is wrong with you? Are you all right?

1597
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:35,829
有点眩晕，还有一些其他的…我现在正在停药。
It's a touch of vertigo and a couple of other... I'm coming off some medication at the moment.

1598
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:39,741
我有过眩晕症，但世界一直在转。
I had vertigo once and the world just keeps moving.

1599
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:42,494
我想请你喝一杯，但我们家没有酒。
I'd offer you a drink, but we don't keep alcohol in the house.

1600
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:43,578
哦，那很好。
Oh, that's fine.

1601
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,543
你可以把你的帽子和外套放在那边。
You can put your hat and coats over there.

1602
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,878
你往这边走。
You're going up this way.

1603
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:53,839
我们要赶在另一个客人前面吗?
Are we jumping ahead of another visitor?

1604
01:24:53,922 --> 01:25:00,304
马奎尔先生每个月都来讨论一些我丈夫永远得不到明确答复的问题。
Oh, Mr. Maguire comes every month to discuss something my husband can never get a clear answer about.

1605
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,805
对吧，马奎尔先生?
Right, Mr. Maguire?

1606
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:02,889
啊。
Ah.

1607
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:07,060
我知道什么?
What do I know?

1608
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:12,316
我只是想做鱼汤因为将军曾经在法国做过。
I'm just trying to make bouillabaisse because the general had it once in France.

1609
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:17,154
将军?你的客人来了。
General? Your visitors are here.

1610
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:19,448
你管你丈夫叫“将军”?
You call your husband "General"?

1611
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,408
只在工作日。
Only on the weekdays.

1612
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:23,577
你周末叫他什么?
What do you call him on weekends?

1613
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,289
这是一个非常私人的问题。
That's a very personal question.

1614
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,017
没人教过你礼貌吗?
Were you taught no manners?

1615
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,101
别怪我害我们被赶出来了。
Don't blame me for getting us kicked out.

1616
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,085
-我没有别的意思。-你紧张吗?
- I didn't mean anything by it. - Are you nervous?

1617
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,355
她有一半时间都在开大家的玩笑。
She's pulling everybody's leg half the time.

1618
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:35,422
这就是我爱她的原因。
That's why I love her.

1619
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,257
太荣幸了，先生。
What an honor, sir.

1620
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:40,289
是照片让你改变主意不想见我们了吗?
Um, was it the pictures that made you change your mind about seeing us?

1621
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,513
我怎么知道照片里的人真的是你?
How can I know this is you, really, in the picture?

1622
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:45,849
是的，先生。
Uh, yes, sir.

1623
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,809
好吧，我是医生。
So, well, I'm the doctor.

1624
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,770
她是护士。他是律师。
She's the nurse. He's the attorney.

1625
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:54,483
我们都是在比利时认识的，如果你还记得的话，那是我们第一次见面的地方。
We all met in Belgium, which, if you recall, is where we met for the first time.

1626
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:57,861
还有去年夏天在华盛顿举行的B.E.F.三月。
As well as Washington, last summer, at the B.E.F. March.

1627
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,449
我告诉你一件我记得很清楚的事。
I'll tell you one thing that I can remember quite clearly.

1628
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:09,081
你做了一件…我相信你唱了一首歌。
You did something that... You sang a song, I believe.

1629
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,500
哪一个哪一个，先生?
Which... Which one, sir?

1630
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,335
好吧，这是要你记住的。
Well, that's for you to remember.

1631
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,963
我见了成千上万的人。你才见过我两次。
I met thousands of people. You just met me twice.

1632
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:19,049
所以，你应该记住这首歌。
So, you should remember the song.

1633
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,761
我想让你现在唱，然后我就知道是你了。
I'd like you to sing it now, then I'll know it's you.

1634
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:24,679
唱首歌。
Sing a song.

1635
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,057
你曾见过梦吗-梦游?——走?
Did you ever see a dream - Dream walking? - Walking?

1636
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,977
嗯，我做了是的…你曾听过一个梦吗?说话吗?
Well, I did Yes... Did you ever hear a dream... Talking?

1637
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,062
看到……正确的。
See... Right.

1638
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:34,731
然后我做了哦，不，不。这是……不是这样的。
Then I did Oh, no, no. That's... That's not it.

1639
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:38,318
嗯…是用法语写的吗?
Um... Was it in French?

1640
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:39,820
我一听到就知道了。
I'll know it when I hear it.

1641
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,806
是的。就是这样。
Yes. That was it.

1642
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,516
这是正确的。
That's right.

1643
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,017
我们瞎编的。
We made it up.

1644
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:12,602
这是说不通的。
Well, it's not supposed to make sense.

1645
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:14,438
这只是一首毫无意义的歌。
It's just a nonsense song.

1646
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:16,815
但它让我们感觉很好。
But it makes us feel good.

1647
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,733
-你是医生吗?-是的，先生。
- And you're the doctor? - That's right, sir.

1648
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:22,279
你在一天内疏散了四千人。
And you evacuated 4,000 men in one day.

1649
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,613
你很有名。
You're very famous.

1650
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,073
不同的医生。
Different doctor.

1651
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,661
那是旧金山来的社交男。
That's the social guy from San Francisco.

1652
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,371
我的人生故事。
Story of my life.

1653
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:33,415
不是你?
Not you?

1654
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:37,127
伯特和我在一天内疏散了几千人，长官。
Burt and I did evacuate a couple of thousand men in one day, though, sir.

1655
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:43,091
还有你，先生，你用刀捅了30个德国人，他们叫你黑死病?
And you, sir, you stabbed 30 Germans with your knife, and they called you "Black Death"?

1656
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,177
不，先生，那是黑死病亨利·约翰逊。
No, sir, that was Black Death Henry Johnson.

1657
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,930
但在他们给我这个之前，我确实得到了12个。——哦。
But I did get 12 of 'em - before they gave me this. - Oh.

1658
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,724
我还救了很多人的命。
I also saved a lot of lives.

1659
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:51,933
-真的吗?-是的。
- You did? - Yeah.

1660
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,312
那是件值得骄傲的事。
Well, that's something to be proud of.

1661
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:58,607
他们让你穿那些法国制服真是可耻。
It's shameful they made you wear those French uniforms.

1662
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,370
你应该穿你自己国家的制服。
You should wear your own country's uniform.

1663
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:03,069
从你嘴里传到上帝的耳朵里，先生，谢谢你。
From your mouth to God's ears, sir. Thank you.

1664
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,072
那么，将军?
So, uh, General?

1665
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:08,742
比尔Meekins。
Bill Meekins.

1666
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:15,874
比尔·米金斯是我的朋友，他和他女儿的遭遇真是个悲剧。
Well, Bill Meekins was a friend of mine, and it's a tragedy what happened to him and his daughter.

1667
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,043
没人关心这事真是太丢脸了。
And it's a disgrace that no one cares.

1668
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,003
-哦，我们在乎。——事实上。
- Oh, we care. - Indeed.

1669
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:22,964
其实是已故的伊丽莎白·米金斯雇的我们。
The late Elizabeth Meekins hired us, actually.

1670
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,257
她雇了你?为什么?
She hired you? Why?

1671
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,385
她不相信她父亲是自然死亡。
She didn't believe that her father died of natural causes.

1672
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,095
在从欧洲回来的路上。
On his way back from Europe.

1673
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:32,224
我最后一次和我朋友通话时，他从罗马给我打电话。
The last time I spoke to my friend, he called me from Rome.

1674
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,309
从酒店打电话给我。
Called me from the hotel.

1675
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:37,521
告诉我他看到了什么可怕的东西。
Told me of something monstrous that he had seen.

1676
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,856
使他大为不安。
Disturbed him greatly.

1677
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,693
这就是比尔被杀的原因。
That was why Bill was killed.

1678
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,700
你进来的时候看到楼下那个人了吗?
You see the man downstairs when you came in?

1679
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:56,748
每隔几周，他就会来…-你看到一个包了吗?——嗯。
Every couple of weeks, he comes and he brings... - Did you see a bag? - Mm-hmm.

1680
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,709
他给了我一袋钱。
A bag of money he offers to me.

1681
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,378
钱干什么?
Money for what?

1682
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,172
发表演讲
To give a speech.

1683
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:08,009
他不肯告诉我谁在背后支持他。我问他。
He won't tell me who's behind him. I ask him.

1684
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,387
然后问:“这是谁送的?”
And say, "Who's this from?"

1685
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:11,656
但他没有给我答案。
And he doesn't give me an answer.

1686
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,348
他们付钱让你做他们的喉舌。
They're paying you to be their mouthpiece.

1687
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:14,641
没错，完全正确。
That's right, exactly.

1688
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:17,060
他们知道老兵们也会跟随。
And they know the veterans will follow.

1689
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:19,104
五人委员会。
The Committee of the Five.

1690
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:22,774
有人在试图做一些黑暗而奸诈的事。
Well, somebody is trying to do something dark and treacherous.

1691
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,195
到这里来。
Come here.

1692
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,948
问他愿不愿意在晚会上讲话。
Ask him if he'll speak at the gala.

1693
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,992
进一步推进。就像亨利说的。
Push it further. Like Henry said.

1694
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:36,913
先生，如果这些人要见你…——嗯。
Sir, um, if these guys - are meeting you... - Hmm.

1695
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:46,172
如果你想找出幕后黑手是谁，为什么不更进一步把他们带到我们的重聚晚会上呢?
And you wanna find out who's behind it all, why not go further and lead them to our reunion gala event?

1696
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:49,217
他们可能会以某种方式表现出来。
They might show themselves in some fashion.

1697
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:58,977
马奎尔，你能告诉我，你为什么每个月都来?
Maguire, can you tell me, why do you come every month?

1698
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:02,230
将军，我不能在别人面前说这件事。
Well, General, I can't speak about it in front of other people.

1699
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,899
为什么不呢?我是说，你说没什么好隐瞒的。
Well, why not? I mean, you say there's nothing to hide.

1700
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,901
这是为了一个好的事业。
And it's in the name of a good cause.

1701
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,195
是的，先生，但不是每个人都明白。
Well, yes, sir. But not everyone understands it.

1702
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,948
我不明白的是你代表的是谁。
What I don't understand is who or what you represent.

1703
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:14,159
你能告诉我吗?
Can you tell me?

1704
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:19,039
我无权透露我代表谁，先生。
Well, I'm not at liberty to say who I represent, sir.

1705
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:24,711
但他们都是非常重要的人，他们有一个非常重要的组织会让一切变得更好。
Uh, but they are very important people, and they have a very important organization that's gonna change everything for the better.

1706
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:31,176
正如我告诉过你的，先生，我们的目的是在经济危机时期正确地领导这个国家。
The purpose, as I've told you, sir, is to lead this nation properly in this time of economic crisis.

1707
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,178
白宫里有个瘸子。
There's a cripple in the White House.

1708
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:39,059
罗斯福是软弱的。我们希望你代表退伍军人和新领导层发言。
Roosevelt is weak. We'd like you to speak on behalf of the veterans and new leadership.

1709
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:41,227
这就是选举的意义，马奎尔。
Well, that's what elections are for, Maguire.

1710
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:42,854
你不相信宪法吗?
Don't you believe in the Constitution?

1711
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:46,566
当然，但我们认为现在迫切需要采取行动。
Of course, but we feel that action is urgently needed now.

1712
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:49,819
从一个退休将军那里得到的吗?
From a retired general before the election?

1713
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,404
你想让我当独裁者吗?
Do you want me to be a dictator?

1714
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,490
这是你的大赞助商想要的吗?
Is that what your big sponsors want?

1715
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:56,910
呃,…一个独裁者?
Uh, a... A dictator?

1716
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,245
不，没必要这么说。
No, it doesn't have to be said like that.

1717
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:02,374
总理?这样会更好吗?
Okay, chancellor? Does that make it better?

1718
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,334
这仍然违反宪法。
It still violates the Constitution.

1719
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,920
他们在德国和意大利的老兵身上做了这个实验。
They did this with veterans in Germany and Italy.

1720
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,129
很成功。
Very successful.

1721
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:15,178
先生，五人委员会捐了一万八千人。
18,000, sir, from the Committee of the Five.

1722
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:16,322
健全美元委员会。
Uh, Committee for a Sound Dollar.

1723
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:17,746
-从谁那里?-五人委员会?
- From who? - Committee of the Five?

1724
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,516
健全美元委员会。
Committee for a Sound Dollar.

1725
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:25,230
国家需要你们的领导。
The nation needs your leadership.

1726
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,023
你明白我在说什么吗，先生?
Do you see where I'm going, sir?

1727
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,987
马奎尔先生，我改变主意了。
Mr. Maguire, I've changed my mind.

1728
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,739
我决定由我来演讲。
I've decided I will do the speech.

1729
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,658
这非常令人兴奋。
This is very exciting.

1730
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:44,958
我来选活动。我和比尔·米金斯从他创建的军团中认识的老兵们交谈是最舒服的。我会在他们的聚会上讲话。
I'll choose the event. I'm most comfortable speaking with the veterans Bill Meekins knew from the regiment he created. I'll speak at their reunion.

1731
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:49,963
当然，但是……因为我想见见把钱放进包里的人。
Of course, but... Because I want to see the men who put the money in that bag.

1732
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:53,007
我想看着他们的眼睛，和他们握手。
And I wanna look them in the eye, and I wanna shake their hand.

1733
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:59,347
鉴于我们现在是合作伙伴了，我可以保证你会见到健康美元委员会的各位先生。
Given that we're partners now, I can guarantee that you will meet the distinguished gentlemen on the Committee for a Sound Dollar.

1734
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:03,643
他们会亲自去见你，不过我们可能需要在一个私人房间。
They will be there to meet you personally, although we might need to be in a private room.

1735
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,312
——好的。-谢谢。
- Okay. - Thank you.

1736
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:09,190
这太棒了。这是演讲。
This is wonderful. This is the speech.

1737
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:11,401
马奎尔先生，拿着那个包。
Mr. Maguire, take that bag.

1738
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:12,569
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1739
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:17,323
所以你还是不肯告诉我他们是谁。
So, you still won't tell me who they are.

1740
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:18,908
这是真的吗?
Is that true?

1741
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:21,453
在活动上，先生。
At the event, sir.

1742
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:31,463
谁给我更多的钱，告诉我该说什么……而我在演讲中没有说的话很可能害死了比尔·米金斯和他的女儿。
Whoever offers me more money and tells me what to say... and what not to say in my speech very likely killed Bill Meekins and his daughter.

1743
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,548
他是这一切的幕后黑手。
And is behind all this.

1744
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:42,182
就这样，两名士兵和一名护士发现我们和伟大的，光荣的迪伦贝克将军结成了联盟。
And so, two soldiers and a nurse found ourselves in league with the great honorable, decorated General Dillenbeck.

1745
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:46,227
将军，你真该和汤姆·沃兹谈谈，瓦莱丽的哥哥。
General, you should really speak to Tom Voze, Valerie's brother.

1746
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,193
请到7号生产室。
Production Room 7, please.

1747
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,612
7号生产室，需要机械师。
Production Room 7, mechanic needed.

1748
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,240
从没见过。
Never saw that.

1749
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:01,868
也许是……也许是现代艺术。
Maybe it's... Maybe it's modern art.

1750
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,871
我真想过去看看。
Kinda wanna go over there and take a look at it.

1751
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:08,291
我想在阿姆斯特丹再试一次。
I would like to try again in Amsterdam.

1752
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:10,627
你会吗?
You would?

1753
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:12,712
是的。
Yes.

1754
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:15,256
好吧，希望一切顺利。
Well, let's hope this goes well.

1755
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:17,634
Voze先生。
Mr. Voze.

1756
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:18,968
——伯特。我可以叫你汤姆吗?
- Burt. - May I call you Tom?

1757
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:20,678
-当然。-沃兹夫人。
- Of course. - Mrs. Voze.

1758
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,972
让我给你介绍迪伦贝克将军。
Let me introduce you to General Dillenbeck.

1759
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:24,557
将军。
General.

1760
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:27,852
迪伦贝克将军，很高兴见到你。
General Dillenbeck, it is such a pleasure to meet you.

1761
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:40,406
我认为你是一个有荣誉和力量的人，而且是一个……这样一个……真的很有尊严，很美好，我真的相信你说的一切。
I think you are a man of such honor and strength, and such a... Such a... Truly just so dignified and wonderful, and I truly believe everything that you say.

1762
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,618
嗯…利比。
Uh... Libby.

1763
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:52,168
这样一个……哦,苏……这样一个……str……强……她太兴奋了。
Such a... Uh, su... Such a... str... strong... She's so excited.

1764
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:54,963
非常激动。不当的兴奋。
Very excited. Inappropriately excited.

1765
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:58,049
你曾在电台做过现场直播吗?
Have you ever broadcast live on the radio?

1766
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,343
联欢晚会吗?不,从来没有。
The gala? No, never.

1767
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:02,637
你能想象吗?
Well, can you imagine?

1768
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:15,400
想想你在密歇根的切博伊根或伊利诺伊州的卡本代尔的老朋友们，坐在家里，听着收音机，听着你的歌，伯特。
Think of your veteran friends in Cheboygan, Michigan, or Carbondale, Illinois, sitting at home, listening to the radio, hearing your songs, Burt.

1769
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:18,611
——哇。-还有你的演讲，将军。
- Wow. - And your speech, General.

1770
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,532
马奎尔给我的演讲?
The speech Maguire gave me?

1771
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:26,202
不。不不不不不。你的演讲。
No. No, no, no, no, no. Your speech.

1772
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:28,746
你要做的演讲。
The speech you want to give.

1773
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:31,541
我…我不知道马奎尔是谁。
I... I don't know who Maguire is.

1774
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:35,211
但我要你说出真心话为比尔·米金斯辩护。
But I want you to speak from your heart to vindicate Bill Meekins.

1775
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:40,258
还有那些被遗弃的无声老兵。
And all those voiceless veterans who've been abandoned.

1776
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:41,384
是的。
Yes.

1777
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:48,391
你带路。那些烂苹果，不管他们对比尔·米金斯做了什么，都会暴露的。
You lead the way. And the rotten apples, whatever they did to Bill Meekins, will reveal themselves.

1778
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:53,187
我要按我的方式演讲。我想说出真相。
I'll give the speech my way. I wanna tell the truth.

1779
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,735
诀窍是让五人委员会和马奎尔认为……
The trick was to let the Committee of Five and Maguire think...

1780
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:06,409
将军将为白宫的新领导层发表演讲。
the general would give their speech for new leadership in the White House.

1781
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,995
立即。没有选举。
Immediately. No election.

1782
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,873
骗老兵支持它。
Conning the veterans into supporting it.

1783
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:24,844
而汤姆，如承诺的那样，帮我们摆脱了警察的圈套，让我们非常惊讶的是，警察现在和我们在一起，共同计划阻止这一切。
And Tom, as promised, had gotten us off the hook with the police who now, to our great surprise, were together with us, united in this plan to stop it.

1784
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,473
我们都支持将军。
And we all supported the general.

1785
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:32,477
他在用自己做诱饵。
He was using himself as bait.

1786
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,863
晚上好，美国。
Good evening, America.

1787
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:48,910
我是威尔金·哈茨代尔在一年一度的退伍军人重聚晚会上为您直播。
This is Wilkin Hartsdale broadcasting to you live from the annual Veterans Reunion Gala.

1788
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,331
保罗,亨利。
Paul, Henry.

1789
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:55,750
他是来找你的。他有问题。
He's here for you. He has questions.

1790
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,045
坎特伯雷诺。
Norcross, Canterbury.

1791
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:05,760
我从没见过，乔治·华盛顿这么大的照片。
I've never seen, uh, such a big picture of George Washington.

1792
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:07,387
让我问一个非常简单的问题。
Let me ask a very simple question.

1793
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,763
你们到底站在哪一边?
Whose side are you guys on?

1794
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,348
我们当然是站在你这边的。
We're on your side, of course.

1795
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,142
同一个上帝，不同的教会。
Same God, different church.

1796
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:16,187
同样的女士，不同的衣服。我们是一条船上的。

可怕的悲剧。
Terrible tragedy.

1924
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:58,023
我期待着今晚与你们谈谈海外的商业机会。
I look forward to speaking with you tonight about business opportunities overseas.

1925
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:03,237
由于强有力的领导，我们在慕尼黑的工厂获得了惊人的回报。
Our plant in Munich is getting fantastic returns because of strong leadership.

1926
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,905
知道如何把事情做好。
Knowing how to get things done.

1927
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:06,907
让我们干一杯。
Let's have a toast.

1928
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:10,953
是的，好的。很好。我们是三个人。
Yes, all right. Good. We are the three.

1929
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:13,497
汤姆，你可以是第四个，就像我们在打高尔夫球一样。
Tom, you could be the fourth, like we're playing golf.

1930
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,625
为了好运，我们需要一个合适的第五名。
And for good luck, we need a proper fifth.

1931
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:17,710
将军?
General?

1932
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:22,715
你能进来一下吗?
Won't you please step in?

1933
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,261
敬将军。
To the general.

1934
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:28,405
-将军。-敬将军。
- The general. - To the general.

1935
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:29,430
一般。
To General.

1936
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:37,354
说什么跟着错误的上帝回家。
Talk about following the wrong God home.

1937
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:43,319
还有什么比美国企业建立的独裁政权更不美国的呢?
What's more un-American than a dictatorship built by American business?

1938
01:44:43,402 --> 01:44:46,131
这里有两个属性，将军，如果您想要使用它们的话。
There are two properties, General, if you should ever want to use them.

1939
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:47,448
你或你的家人。
You or your family.

1940
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,659
位于马里兰州的先锋点，贝尔波特化学品的故乡。
Pioneer Point in Maryland, the home state of Belport Chemicals.

1941
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:53,746
这是你和老兵们的好去处。
A great retreat for you or the veterans.

1942
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:55,289
还有一个在东汉普顿。
And another one out in East Hampton.

1943
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:56,600
你和你的家人可能会喜欢。
You and your family might like it.

1944
01:44:56,624 --> 01:45:01,045
我会考虑的，不过我和妻子喜欢泽西海岸的小房子。
I'll think about it, though the wife and I enjoy a little place on the Jersey Shore.

1945
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:03,756
也许你需要更大的想象力，将军。
Maybe you need a larger imagination, General.

1946
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:07,218
所以我们才会在这里。
That's how we all ended up here.

1947
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:11,222
别管这些人，将军。他们认为他们拥有世界。
Never mind these men, General. They think they own the world.

1948
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,057
是时候继续你的演讲了。
It's time to be getting on with your speech.

1949
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:16,644
我们期待您的演讲。
We're looking forward to your speech.

1950
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:40,417
现在，第369届的特邀明星奥吉，出现在眼镜上。
And now, a featured star of the 369th, Auggie, on the glasses.

1951
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,425
那是什么?
What is that?

1952
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:53,013
这是苏黎世最好的创新之一。
This is one of the finest innovations from Zurich.

1953
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:55,641
消除所有的痛苦和焦虑。
Removes all pain, all anxiety.

1954
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:56,725
嗯?
Hmm?

1955
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:01,730
所有不必要的想法占据了头脑。
All needless thoughts that occupy the mind.

1956
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:10,990
我的背疼死了。
My back is killing me.

1957
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:18,831
通常情况下，像我这样的人，我们不得不求助于酒精和吗啡，而这可能会导致上瘾……哦，太快了。
Now, normally, guys like me, we have to turn to booze and morphine, and that can lead to addiction... Oh, that's fast.

1958
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:20,749
这是先进的。
That is advanced.

1959
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,585
哦，那是巨大的能量。
Oh, that is tremendous energy.

1960
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:25,838
-我不疼。-很好，不是吗?
- I feel no pain. - It's good, isn't it?

1961
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,089
这很好。
That is good.

1962
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:29,383
伯特，这事还没完呢。
There's more where this came from, Burt.

1963
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:31,343
我想多了解一点。
I wanna know more about this.

1964
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,679
我想要这种化合物。
I would love to have the chemical compound.

1965
01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:40,644
当我和我的姐妹们在Vril Society聚会时，我们会举办一个séance，在那里我们可以放松一下，它就像一种天线。
When I get together with my sisters at the Vril Society, we hold a séance where we let our hair down, and it acts as a kind of antenna.

1966
01:46:40,728 --> 01:46:42,938
它让我们与更伟大的种族交流。
It allows us to communicate with the greater race.

1967
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:44,898
说实话，他们来自另一个星系。
Honestly, they come from a different galaxy.

1968
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,525
这真的很吸引人。
It's truly fascinating.

1969
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,905
现在是辛森兄弟。
And now, the Hinson Brothers.

1970
01:46:53,824 --> 01:47:05,753
西班牙夫人，我崇拜你从我第一次见到你的那天晚上我就想对你今晚的演讲说一些友好的建议，将军。
Lady of Spain, I adore you Right from the night I first saw you I wanted to say, for your speech tonight, General, some friendly advice.

1971
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:08,505
求你了，求你了，别给他任何友好的建议。
Oh, please, please, please, don't give him any friendly advice.

1972
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,674
是啊，有什么友好的建议吗?
Oh, yeah, well, what's the friendly advice?

1973
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:15,429
今晚，人们将通过广播收听你的演讲。
Tonight, people will be listening to you on the radio.

1974
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:20,100
你永远不会有更多的观众，也不会有更多的人关注你。
You'll never have a bigger audience with more excited attention from everyone.

1975
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:23,062
他们会从你身上寻找灵感。
They'll be looking to you for inspiration.

1976
01:47:23,729 --> 01:47:31,945
记住那些为我们流血牺牲的退伍军人，记住比尔·米金斯，向他致以崇高的敬意。
Remember the veterans who have bled and died on our behalf, and remember Bill Meekins and honor him respectfully.

1977
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:41,288
如果你因为米金斯的死而突发奇想，在复杂的犯罪案件中迷失了方向，这会给你带来不好的影响，我们不希望你这样，将军。
If you improvise and get lost in the woods of some complicated criminal situation over Meekins's death, it will reflect badly on you, and we don't want that for you, General.

1978
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:48,587
将军说得很清楚他会尊重比尔·米金斯并说出真相。
The general was very clear about that he was gonna honor Bill Meekins and tell the truth.

1979
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:51,465
嗯，我就是这个意思。
Well, that's exactly what I mean.

1980
01:47:51,548 --> 01:47:53,676
关注米金斯的优点。
Focus on the good qualities Meekins had.

1981
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:55,928
他的安静和他的善良。
His quietness and his kindness.

1982
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:58,889
这就是我打算用自己的方式去做的。
That's what I intend to do in my own way.

1983
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:08,315
-那是什么?-摸摸这个。
- What is that? - Feel this.

1984
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:09,942
这是海象。
This is walrus.

1985
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:12,945
哦，好软。
Oh, that is soft.

1986
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:15,989
一只海象因此被杀?
A walrus was killed for this?

1987
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:22,496
不，先生，他是老死的。因为他做出了明智的选择，他活得又长又幸福。
No, sir, he died of old age. He lived a long, happy life because he made smart choices.

1988
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:26,333
这是对你的基金会的贡献。
It's a contribution for your foundation.

1989
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:28,961
我没有基金会。
I don't have a foundation.

1990
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:31,630
好吧，也许你应该开始一个。我可以帮你。
Well, maybe you should start one. I can help you.

1991
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:33,966
36000美元,一般。
$36,000, General.

1992
01:48:34,049 --> 01:48:37,553
想想你能用伯伦森医生和他的医疗创新做什么。
Think of everything you can do with Dr. Berendsen and his medical innovations.

1993
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:39,054
有这么多事情要做。
So much to be accomplished.

1994
01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:40,806
你必须拿钱。
You have to take the money.

1995
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:42,516
什么叫我得接?
What do you mean, I have to take it?

1996
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:53,485
听我说。有人，而不是我，会把你的脸和你的名字，登在《纽约时报》上，然后用它来擦他们的狗屁股。
Listen to me. Someone, not me, they will take your face and your name, put it in the New York Times, and wipe their dog's ass with it.

1997
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:57,781
想想你一生中所完成的一切。
Think of everything you've accomplished in your life.

1998
01:48:57,865 --> 01:48:59,992
它会被遗忘，被抹去。
It'll be forgotten, erased.

1999
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:05,247
你会被当成老疯子被历史埋葬。
You'll be treated like an old kook and buried by history.

2000
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:09,918
这就是他们能做的。做正确的演讲。
That's what they can do. Make the right speech.

2001
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:14,548
不然他们会把你变成殉道者说是无政府主义者干的。
Or they'll turn you into a martyr and say an anarchist did it.

2002
01:49:15,591 --> 01:49:17,801
别犯比尔·米金斯那样的错误。
Don't make the mistake like Bill Meekins.

2003
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:20,345
那是一起悲惨的生命盗窃案。
That was a tragic theft of a life.

2004
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:23,223
西班牙夫人，我爱你
Lady of Spain, I love you

2005
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,187
那是欣森兄弟。
That was the Hinson Brothers.

2006
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:30,731
辛森兄弟，他们很棒。
The Hinson Brothers, they were great.

2007
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:32,316
你不同意吗?是的。
Don't you agree? Yes.

2008
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,611
Hinson兄弟。在做，呃，西班牙夫人。
Hinson Brothers. Doing, uh, Lady of Spain.

2009
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:40,908
是的，西班牙夫人。我曾经遇到一位西班牙女士，她把我变成了一个痛苦的绅士。
Yeah, Lady of Spain. I met a lady of Spain once and she turned me into a gentleman of pain.

2010
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:42,326
是的。
Yes.

2011
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:50,834
现在，我要带出来的这位先生是我们团的一名医生我喜欢称他为"朋友"
Now, the gentleman I'm about to bring out right now is a doctor of our regiment and a man I like to call "friend."

2012
01:49:50,918 --> 01:49:53,128
请欢迎伯特·伯伦森。
Please welcome Burt Berendsen.

2013
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:54,963
来吧，伯特。
Come on, Burt.

2014
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:58,383
该你演讲了，伯特。伯特?
Time to give your speech, Burt. Burt?

2015
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:01,220
伯特·伯伦森医生。
Dr. Burt Berendsen.

2016
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,603
我叫伯特·伯伦森。你们大多数人都认识我。
My name is Burt Berendsen. Most of you know me.

2017
01:50:09,686 --> 01:50:13,816
我是埃尔米拉一个机械师的儿子。
I am the son of a mechanic from Elmira.

2018
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:20,280
作为一个孩子，我们很自然地热爱这个世界。
As a child, we love the world, naturally.

2019
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:24,868
我们希望全世界都爱我们。
And we hope the world loves us.

2020
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:32,876
就像我的朋友哈罗德说的，有时我可能跟着错误的上帝回家了。
As my friend Harold said sometimes I might have followed the wrong God home.

2021
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:34,920
但不是这个人。
Well, not this man.

2022
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:39,883
他总是跟着正确的上帝回家。
He always followed the right God home.

2023
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:47,975
Dillenbeck !Dillenbeck !
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

2024

Dillenbeck !Dillenbeck !
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

2025
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,686
Dillenbeck !

Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

2027
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:56,733
Drecksgesicht !Drecksgesicht !
Drecksgesicht! Drecksgesicht!

2028
01:50:56,817 --> 01:50:59,069
Drecksgesicht !Drecksgesicht !
Drecksgesicht! Drecksgesicht!

2029
01:51:04,283 --> 01:51:06,869
听那些外滩混蛋的。
Listen to those Bund bastards.

2030
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:10,080
流血的人，腐烂的人。
Shower of bleeders, rotters.

2031
01:51:11,206 --> 01:51:16,169
如果你们这些用德语对我大喊大叫的人有点勇气，你们就会表现得有尊严。
If you people shouting at me in German had any courage, you would behave with dignity.

2032
01:51:22,885 --> 01:51:24,803
是的!一般Dillenbeck !
Yes! General Dillenbeck!

2033
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:31,310
我在三大洲参加了五场战争。
I fought in five wars on three continents.

2034
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:34,146
我这辈子都被人朝我开枪。我的一生。
People shot at me my whole life. My whole life.

2035
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:36,607
我了解恐惧，也知道如何面对恐惧。
I know fear, and I know facing fear.

2036
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:44,698
但我真正厌恶的一件事，我真正非常厌恶的一件事，就是残忍。
But the one thing I truly detest, the one thing I truly, truly detest, is cruelty.

2037
01:51:46,575 --> 01:52:04,635
有人给我提供了钱，让我成为那些像你们这样的老兵的自封领袖，根据你们的民意要求，不经选举就能成为白宫的某种顾问。
I've been offered money to become the self-appointed leader of the veterans, veterans like you, to be put in the White House without an election as some sort of advisor by popular demand of you.

2038
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:12,225
这些人想让我模仿一个叫墨索里尼的欧洲领导人。
These same people want me to emulate a certain European leader named Mussolini.

2039
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:18,857
他们认为他是这个国家需要的那种领导人。
They think he's the type of leader that this country needs.

2040
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:25,614
那种会撞死小孩却从不停车的领袖。
The type of leader who ran over a child and never stopped his car.

2041
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:34,081
这类领导人的借口是，“一个人在国家事务中有什么关系?”
The type of leader whose excuse was, "What's one person in the affairs of the state?"

2042
01:52:36,792 --> 01:52:39,878
比尔·米金斯将军在那辆车里。
General Bill Meekins was in that car.

2043
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:42,089
他是我的一个朋友。
He was a friend of mine.

2044
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:43,590
他是个好人。
He was a good person.

2045
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:56,895
但当他讲了这个故事，当他打算在这个舞台上再讲一遍的时候，他就变成了另一个在国家事务中毫无价值的人。
But when he told that story, when he intended to tell it again here on this stage, he became another person whose life was worth nothing in the affairs of the state.

2046
01:52:57,646 --> 01:52:59,731
他被谋杀了。
He was murdered.

2047
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:07,114
是的，他被谋杀并蒙羞，就像我今晚在这里讲述这个故事可能会被谋杀或蒙羞一样。
Yes, he was murdered and dishonored, as I might be murdered or dishonored for telling that story here tonight.

2048
01:53:09,241 --> 01:53:11,618
当这种情况发生时，这将成为一个什么样的国家?
What kind of country does this become when that happens?

2049
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:19,918
我成为一名海军陆战队员是为了服务于宪法，它的宗旨是让我们所有人在人类的兄弟情谊中一律平等。
I became a Marine to serve the Constitution, which intends for us all to be equal in the brotherhood of mankind.

2050
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:27,134
但当有权势的人为妨碍他们的人破例时又有什么好处呢?
But what good is it when powerful people make exceptions for the people who stand in their way?

2051
01:53:27,968 --> 01:53:36,184
有些有影响力和权力的人喜欢看到普通人被仇恨激怒，因为这分散了我们对公平和善良的注意力。
Some people of influence and power like it when regular folks are fired up by hatred because it distracts us from the fairness and kindness.

2052
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:44,109
他们不希望我们想太多，这样他们就可以从他们已经拥有的东西中得到越来越多的东西，那是巨大的财富。
They don't want us to think about too much just so they can get more and more of what they already have, which is vast wealth.

2053
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:46,445
这是你的国家。
This is your country.

2054
01:53:46,528 --> 01:53:48,739
这是你的国家。
This is your country.

2055
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,909
别让大人物把它抢走。
Don't let the big men take it away from you.

2056
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:59,166
Dillenbeck !Dillenbeck !
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

2057
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:01,752
Dillenbeck !Dillenbeck !
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

2058
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:03,420
看，是那个人。
Look, it's that guy.

2059
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:05,172
我是银行家的儿子。
I'm the son of a banker.

2060
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:07,799
我是共和党人。
I'm a Republican.

2061
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:10,510
-保罗和亨利在哪里?-这里不行。
- Where's Paul and Henry? - Not here.

2062
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:11,595
我是个保守派。
I'm a conservative.

2063
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:13,072
侦探们呢?你知道他们在哪里吗?
What about the detectives? Do you know where they are?

2064
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:14,306
这里也没有。
Also not here.

2065
01:54:14,389 --> 01:54:19,895
这就是有钱的人只想要更多钱的那种感觉。
That's what it's like when people who have money only think about wanting much more of it.

2066
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:22,272
这就是他们所想的。
That's all that they think about.

2067
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:28,987
他们忘记了是你们出去保护了他们。
And they forget that you are the ones who went out and protected them.

2068
01:54:30,197 --> 01:54:39,372
你失去了一只眼睛或失去了生命，你的家人不得不受苦，尽管他们是把你送上战场的英雄。
You lost an eye or you lost your life, and your family had to suffer, though they were the heroes who sent you off to war.

2069
01:54:42,167 --> 01:54:44,044
朝我开枪的人是个懦夫。
Whoever's shooting at me is a coward.

2070
01:54:44,419 --> 01:54:46,254
我在世界各地都中过枪。
I've been shot at all over the world.

2071
01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:47,547
拿他的枪!
Get his gun!

2072
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,384
我不害怕。我不害怕。
I am not intimidated. I am not afraid.

2073
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:55,305
-你没事吧?-伯特，你没事吧?
- You all right? - Burt, are you all right?

2074
01:54:55,388 --> 01:54:56,515
莱姆，我没事。我很好。
Lem, I'm fine. I'm fine.

2075
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,944
永远的暴君!
Sic semper tyrannis!

2076
01:55:09,027 --> 01:55:10,779
迪伦贝克是个叛徒!
Dillenbeck's a traitor!

2077
01:55:10,862 --> 01:55:13,115
-阻止那个人。- Tom Voze是个伟大的人!
- Stop that man. - Tom Voze is a great man!

2078
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:15,492
汤姆·沃兹是个伟大的人!你有……
Tom Voze is a great man! You have...

2079
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:20,205
打倒那个人。
Keep that man down.

2080
01:55:20,288 --> 01:55:22,541
有罪却合法。问沃兹先生!
Sinful and legal. Ask Mr. Voze!

2081
01:55:27,212 --> 01:55:35,262
我的祖国，美丽的自由之乡，我为你歌唱，Polizei。Polizei。
My country 'Tis of thee Sweet land of liberty Of thee I sing Polizei. Polizei.

2082
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:37,597
别吵了!别吵了!到这里来。
Break it up! Break it up! Come here.

2083
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:44,146
我是老兵，也是爱国者，你个傻瓜。
I'm a veteran and a patriot, you fool.

2084
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:46,398
你杀了莉兹·米金斯，你个混蛋。
You killed Liz Meekins, you son of a bitch.

2085
01:55:47,232 --> 01:55:49,526
据我所知，她父亲也是。
And for all I know, her father too.

2086
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:52,237
美国财政部!每一个人,离开!
United States Treasury! Everyone, leave!

2087
01:55:53,446 --> 01:55:55,615
-你没事吧?-这太可怕了。
- Are you okay? - This is terrible.

2088
01:55:55,699 --> 01:55:57,579
我们从没想过会发生这种事。
We never meant for anything like this to happen.

2089
01:55:57,617 --> 01:55:58,910
这是一种暴行。
This is an outrage.

2090
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:00,036
你会被起诉的。
You're gonna be charged.

2091
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,454
你会被起诉的，汤姆。
You're gonna be charged, Tom.

2092
01:56:01,538 --> 01:56:02,539
你。是的,你。
You. Yes, you.

2093
01:56:02,622 --> 01:56:03,623
不，先生，你搞错了。
No, sir. You are confused.

2094
01:56:03,707 --> 01:56:04,708
不，我没糊涂。
No, I'm not confused.

2095
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:12,299
除了我自己吃的药和挨枪子，这些眼药水是我能站起来感觉不到疼痛的唯一原因。
Between my own pill and getting shot, these eye drops are the only reason I'm standing and I feel no pain.

2096
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:17,470
我的天!看看这房间里发生了什么。
And holy shit! Look what's happening in this room.

2097
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:18,555
一切。
Everything.

2098
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:19,949
五人委员会的枪。
Gun from the Committee of the Five.

2099
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:22,684
他骄傲地叫你的名字，汤姆。
He called you by your name, Tom, with pride.

2100
01:56:22,767 --> 01:56:24,019
我不认识那个人。
I don't know that man.

2101
01:56:24,102 --> 01:56:25,687
我们只是为了活命才和他搏斗。
We just fought that man for our lives.

2102
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:27,123
伯特和我看到他推莉斯·米金斯。
Burt and I saw him push Liz Meekins.

2103
01:56:27,147 --> 01:56:28,148
他是凶手。
He's the killer.

2104
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:30,400
有足够的证据。
There is enough evidence.

2105
01:56:30,483 --> 01:56:40,452
我很遗憾地告诉你今晚在舞台上向迪伦贝克将军开枪的人就是和米金斯在船上的那个人，他的船票是你们基金会买的。
I am sorry to say that the man who took a shot at General Dillenbeck on that stage tonight was the same man on the boat with Meekins, on a ticket purchased by your foundation.

2106
01:56:40,535 --> 01:56:41,679
没有必要提高你的嗓门。
There is no need to raise your voice.

2107
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:43,330
你的，沃兹先生。
Yours, Mr. Voze.

2108
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:44,456
汤姆，发生什么事了?
Tom, what's happening?

2109
01:56:44,539 --> 01:56:45,540
费用是什么?
What are the charges?

2110
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:47,852
指控的对象是你和你邀请的客人。
The charges are against you and the guests you invited.

2111
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:49,878
-五国委员会。-为什么?
- The Committee of the Five. - For what?

2112
01:56:49,961 --> 01:56:51,087
五人委员会。
Committee of the Five.

2113
01:56:51,171 --> 01:56:53,173
密谋贿赂美国将军。
Conspiracy to bribe a United States general.

2114
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:55,550
暗杀未遂。
Attempted assassination.

2115
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:57,844
阴谋推翻美国政府。
Conspiracy to overthrow the US government.

2116
01:56:57,928 --> 01:57:00,639
和独裁者，意大利，德国进行贸易。
Trading with dictators, Italy, Germany.

2117
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:06,228
你的基金会显然与两起谋杀案有关，米金斯和他女儿。
Two murders your foundation apparently seems to be responsible for, Meekins and his daughter.

2118
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:07,812
汤姆，是你干的吗?
Tom, did you do this?

2119
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:09,981
我觉得米金斯的死是不对的。
I felt it was wrong that Meekins died.

2120
01:57:10,065 --> 01:57:11,816
那是一起悲惨的生命盗窃案。
That was a tragic theft of a life.

2121
01:57:12,525 --> 01:57:18,281
但他必须做点什么，因为他没有看到新的生活方式带来的机遇。
But something had to be done because he didn't see the opportunity of the new ways to live.

2122
01:57:18,365 --> 01:57:20,492
他不明白。米金斯不明白。
He didn't understand. Meekins didn't understand.

2123
01:57:20,575 --> 01:57:21,701
你明白吗?
Do you understand that?

2124
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:23,245
好的。你得放慢速度。
All right. You need to slow it down.

2125
01:57:23,745 --> 01:57:27,040
汤姆，别告诉我你和我的药有任何关系。
Tom, please tell me you didn't have anything to do with my medication.

2126
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:31,753
汤姆影响了你的医生，瓦莱丽，就像他以前对你母亲一样。
Tom influenced your doctor, Valerie, as he had done with your mother before.

2127
01:57:35,882 --> 01:57:37,759
-是真的吗?-有一点。
- Is that true? - A little.

2128
01:57:38,385 --> 01:57:39,469
一个小?
A little?

2129
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:41,680
我这么做是为了你好。
I did it for your own good.

2130
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:42,847
你给我下毒?
You poisoned me?

2131
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:45,809
如果你想这么说，好吧。
If that's what you want to call it, fine.

2132
01:57:46,434 --> 01:57:49,729
我是在照顾你，为了你的最大利益。
I was looking after you, your best interests.

2133
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:52,607
你太鲁莽了，像个孩子。
You're reckless, like a child.

2134
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:59,030
听我说。你在欧洲到处跑，说战争的坏话?
Listen to me. You're running around all over Europe and saying bad things about the war?

2135
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,908
和一个黑人交往。
Consorting with a Black man.

2136
01:58:03,201 --> 01:58:10,250
在阿姆斯特丹，和一个为你而战的自由人在一起!
Consorting with a man, a free man, in Amsterdam, that fought for you!

2137
01:58:10,834 --> 01:58:12,419
比如诊所，汤姆?
Like the clinics, Tom?

2138
01:58:13,128 --> 01:58:14,254
诊所是什么?
What clinics?

2139
01:58:14,337 --> 01:58:15,922
五人委员会。
Committee of the Five.

2140
01:58:16,006 --> 01:58:17,882
你知道我在说什么诊所，汤姆。
You know what clinics I'm talking about, Tom.

2141
01:58:17,966 --> 01:58:19,718
强制绝育。
Forced sterilization.

2142
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:20,969
我们走着瞧吧。
We'll see about that.

2143
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:25,181
我们看到了五人委员会的标志——在那里。-别撒谎了!
We saw the Committee of the Five symbol - there. - Stop lying!

2144
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:32,397
汤姆有阴谋并不奇怪，但可怕的是……我的上帝。就在瓦莱丽的眼皮底下。
That Tom had an angle was no surprise, but the horror of it... My God. Right under Valerie's nose.

2145
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:35,483
他们用编造的条件分散她的注意力。
They kept her distracted with the invented condition.

2146
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:41,656
戈林，希特勒的得力助手，还有希特勒本人。
Goering, Hitler's right-hand man, and Hitler himself.

2147
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:43,992
大多数人都不知道他是谁。
Most people didn't even know who he was yet.

2148
01:58:45,327 --> 01:58:50,332
汤姆甚至付钱让戈林在杰弗斯的报纸上写一篇关于雅利安新政府的专栏。
Tom even paid Goering to write a column in the Jeffers papers about the new Aryan government.

2149
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:52,208
不管那是什么。
Whatever that was.

2150
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:58,173
汤姆刚刚完成了带有符号的修剪。
Tom had just finished the topiary with the symbol.

2151
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:00,925
你只能从上面看。
You couldn't see it except from above.

2152
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:06,890
我是说，你一定是某种超级狂热的信徒才能把你的灌木弄成那样。
I mean, you gotta be some kind of super-fanatic believer to make your bushes like that.

2153
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:08,451
别那样看着我，莉比。
Don't you look at me like that, Libby.

2154
01:59:08,475 --> 01:59:09,476
瓦莱丽,亲爱的。
Valerie, darling.

2155
01:59:09,559 --> 01:59:11,895
所有伟大的社会都是这样建立起来的。
All great societies are built this way.

2156
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,689
你和你那些奇怪的雕塑生活在一个梦幻的世界里。
You live in a dream world with your strange sculptures.

2157
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:16,358
这很好。你可以拿走。
And that's fine. You can have that.

2158
01:59:16,441 --> 01:59:18,026
但它不能使世界转动。
But it won't make the world go round.

2159
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:22,697
我很高兴自己不重要，生活在一个有爱和美丽的地方。
I'm very happy to be unimportant and live in a place that has love and beauty.

2160
01:59:22,781 --> 01:59:31,748
艺术和爱，这才是让生命有价值的东西，而你却在创造这个巨大而可怕的未来。
Art and love, that's what makes the life worth living, while you're building this big, gigantic, terrifying future.

2161
01:59:32,499 --> 01:59:34,542
真是浪费你的想象力。
What a waste of your imagination.

2162
01:59:34,626 --> 01:59:38,630
我为我们做了很多，重建德国。
I made plenty, for us, rebuilding Germany.

2163
01:59:39,297 --> 01:59:42,050
我想和世界上最强大的领导人站在一起。
I wanted to stand with the strongest leaders in the world.

2164
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:44,761
但我也很乐意与他们作战。
But I'm also happy to go to war against them.

2165
01:59:45,303 --> 01:59:48,598
另一场战争吗?但我们刚刚都做了。
Another war? But we just did all that.

2166
01:59:49,891 --> 01:59:55,980
你是说这些有钱人会支持独裁者还是反抗独裁者?
You mean to tell me these rich guys will support dictators or fight them?

2167
01:59:56,064 --> 01:59:58,691
他们只相信赚钱。
They believe in nothing but making money.

2168
01:59:59,234 --> 02:00:04,447
所以米金斯才被杀，就因为他不同意也不支持吗?
And that's why Meekins was killed, because he wouldn't go along with that or support it?

2169
02:00:04,531 --> 02:00:05,824
精神错乱!
Insanity!

2170
02:00:06,491 --> 02:00:08,743
我们就这样走了进去。
And we have walked right into it.

2171
02:00:08,827 --> 02:00:10,578
不。哦，不，不，不。
No. Oh, no, no, no.

2172
02:00:11,162 --> 02:00:15,208
——啊……汤姆很快就认为我们是他抓到将军的最好机会。
- Ah... - Tom quickly saw us as his best chance to get the general.

2173
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:20,422
如果你能让吉尔·迪伦贝克这样的人参与你的活动，对我也有帮助。
If you got someone like Gil Dillenbeck involved with your event, it would help me to get involved.

2174
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:25,385
你需要人帮忙吗?你总是……-他总是需要一个人…-瓦莱丽，-你能消停会吗?-在他面前。
So, you need someone? You always... - He always needs someone... - Valerie, - would you give it a rest? - In front of him.

2175
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:28,513
你想利用这些人来抓我。
You thought you'd use these men to get me.

2176
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:34,602
但我利用他们和他们的活动揭露了你阻止了你的计划至少十年。
But I used them and their event to reveal you and stop your plan for at least a decade.

2177
02:00:34,686 --> 02:00:37,230
也许还有两三个，希望如此。
Maybe two or three more, hopefully.

2178
02:00:38,314 --> 02:00:40,650
我们确实阻止了阴谋。
We did stop the plot.

2179
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:42,861
这是真的。
This is true.

2180
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:49,117
五国委员会没有找到他们的美国独裁者。
The Committee of the Five didn't get their American dictator.

2181
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:58,293
我在国会委员会，美国人民的最高代表面前，应传票说出我所知道的……将军在国会作证，
I appeared before the congressional committee, the highest representation of the American people, under subpoena to tell what I knew of... The general testified to Congress,

2182
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:01,087
他们一致认为他是对的。
and they agreed he was right.

2183
02:01:01,838 --> 02:01:04,757
有权势的人想要什么?
What do powerful people want?

2184
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:06,509
这还不够吗?
Is it never enough?

2185
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:08,845
他们做最疯狂的事。
They do the craziest things.

2186
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:17,353
我的天啊!你怎么了?
Oh, my God! What's the matter with you?

2187
02:01:17,437 --> 02:01:18,438
你到底做了什么?
What the hell did you do?

2188
02:01:18,521 --> 02:01:19,999
我的天啊!瓦莱丽，你做了什么?
Oh, my God! Valerie, what have you done?

2189
02:01:20,023 --> 02:01:21,709
你怎么了?你做了什么?
What's the matter with you? What did you do?

2190
02:01:21,733 --> 02:01:25,820
我们有了起诉的所有证据，现在一切都泡影了!
We had everything we needed to prosecute, and now it's all out the window!

2191
02:01:25,904 --> 02:01:27,322
现在这是一个大问题。
It's a huge problem now.

2192
02:01:27,405 --> 02:01:28,448
是的，干得好。
Yes, well done.

2193
02:01:28,531 --> 02:01:33,328
汤姆，我的脸。她毁了我的脸!
Tom, my face. She ruined my face!

2194
02:01:33,411 --> 02:01:36,289
我没办法。它们太可怕了。
I couldn't help it. They're so awful.

2195
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:37,874
女人，你疯了吗?
Woman, have you lost your mind?

2196
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:39,375
我说过她是个麻烦。
I told you she was trouble.

2197
02:01:39,459 --> 02:01:40,853
是啊，那太蠢了，瓦莱丽。
Yeah, that was rather stupid, Valerie.

2198
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:41,979
你会进监狱的，瓦莱丽。
You could go to jail, Valerie.

2199
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:43,630
告诉他们真相，哈罗德。
Tell them the truth, Harold.

2200
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:49,219
你没事吧，瓦莱丽?你颤抖。
Are you all right, Valerie? You're shaking.

2201
02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:54,724
哦，我很好。我只是想一枪打爆汤姆和莉比的脸。
Oh, I'm fine. I was just thinking about shooting Tom and Libby in the face.

2202
02:01:54,807 --> 02:01:57,477
——嗯。-我不会做的。别担心。
- Hmm. - I won't do it. Don't worry.

2203
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,120
嗯，这是个好决定。感谢上帝。
Well, that's a good decision. Thank God.

2204
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:01,415
是的，它会毁了一切。我们就没有案子了。
Yes, it would've bollocksed everything. We'd have no case.

2205
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:04,567
你必须勇敢地面对他们，就像我们所做的那样。
You have to stand up to them, as we had done.

2206
02:02:04,651 --> 02:02:07,195
你必须活出真实的自己。
And you have to live your truth.

2207
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,573
我爱哈罗德。
I love Harold.

2208
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:15,245
他给了我生命中最大的幸福，伯特也是。
He's given me the greatest happiness of my life, as has Burt.

2209
02:02:27,257 --> 02:02:29,509
就在那儿。看那个。
There it is. Look at that.

2210
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:32,470
这就是你面对这个世界的方式。
That's how you face such a world.

2211
02:02:33,555 --> 02:02:37,016
你必须对你的生活充满爱。
You must have love in your heart for your life.

2212
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:40,979
这是爱与恨的较量。
It is love versus hate.

2213
02:02:41,646 --> 02:02:44,440
我爱我的生活和生活中的人。
I love my life and the people in it.

2214
02:02:45,942 --> 02:02:47,151
甚至比阿特丽斯。
Even Beatrice.

2215
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:51,072
而且很清楚，不是葡萄牙语，我爱上了她的厄玛。
And clear, not Portuguese, I'm-in-love-with-her Irma.

2216
02:02:51,155 --> 02:02:52,490
弥尔顿。
Milton.

2217
02:02:52,574 --> 02:02:55,118
雪莉和莫蒂在办公室。
Shirley at the office with Morty.

2218
02:02:55,952 --> 02:02:58,413
挂毯。里面的所有东西。
The tapestry. Everything in it.

2219
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:01,040
甚至我的玻璃眼睛。
Even my glass eye.

2220
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:04,377
迪伦贝克的狗和我们没吃到的鱼汤。
Dillenbeck's dog and the bouillabaisse we didn't get to have.

2221
02:03:05,587 --> 02:03:09,382
我们每个人都有一幅挂毯，属于我们自己的歌剧。
Each one of us is given a tapestry, our own opera.

2222
02:03:09,465 --> 02:03:11,301
这个人和这个人。
This person and this person.

2223
02:03:11,384 --> 02:03:12,802
正在考虑。
Thinking about it.

2224
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,930
光有爱是不够的。
Love is not enough.

2225
02:03:16,014 --> 02:03:18,308
你得为保护善良而奋斗。
You got to fight to protect kindness.

2226
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:21,853
你会对人和事产生依恋。
You get attached to people and things.

2227
02:03:23,021 --> 02:03:25,315
他们可能会让你心碎。
And they might just break your heart.

2228
02:03:25,398 --> 02:03:26,941
但那就是活着。
But that's being alive.

2229
02:03:28,776 --> 02:03:32,572
我很不喜欢的背撑救了我。
My back brace that I so disliked had saved me from this bullet.

2230
02:03:32,655 --> 02:03:34,115
你这个幸运的混蛋。
You lucky bastard.

2231
02:03:34,198 --> 02:03:36,993
我们三个帮助阻止了这个可怕的阴谋。
And we three had helped stop this terrible plot.

2232
02:03:37,076 --> 02:03:38,328
我真不敢相信。
I can't believe that.

2233
02:03:38,411 --> 02:03:42,790
伯特·伯伦森，哈罗德·伍德曼，瓦莱丽·沃兹。
Burt Berendsen, Harold Woodman, and Valerie Voze.

2234
02:03:43,374 --> 02:03:47,754
混蛋,奈文斯……汤姆不会被拘留太久。
Jerks, Nevins... Tom would not stay arrested long.

2235
02:03:47,837 --> 02:03:49,505
那些人从来不会。
Those people never do.

2236
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:51,591
和我的律师谈谈。你会看到。
Talk to my lawyer. You'll see.

2237
02:03:52,383 --> 02:03:55,845
五人委员会从未面临任何指控。
Committee of the Five never faced any charges.

2238
02:03:56,512 --> 02:03:59,349
他们消失了，就像他们会做的那样。
They disappeared, as they can do.

2239
02:04:00,058 --> 02:04:02,435
汤姆和他的朋友们诽谤将军。
Tom and his friends smeared the general.

2240
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:07,857
这是对他们能力的警告。
It was a warning of what they were capable of.

2241
02:04:09,984 --> 02:04:13,446
马奎尔神秘去世，年仅37岁。
Maguire died mysteriously at the age of 37.

2242
02:04:13,988 --> 02:04:15,573
他知道的太多了。
He knew too much.

2243
02:04:16,574 --> 02:04:19,911
瓦莱丽和哈罗德在这个国家已经不安全了。
Valerie and Harold were no longer safe in this country.

2244
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,583
一辈子的朋友就是一辈子的朋友。
Friends for life means friends for life.

2245
02:04:26,918 --> 02:04:28,461
你要不惜一切代价。
You do whatever it takes.

2246
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:30,922
那晚我们就得把他们弄上船。
We had to get them on a boat that very night.

2247
02:04:37,512 --> 02:04:40,181
伍德曼，你应该…谢谢你，亨利。
Woodman, you should... Thank you, Henry.

2248
02:04:40,264 --> 02:04:41,974
我早就知道了。我做了决定。
I'm way ahead of you. I made my decision.

2249
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:43,935
哈罗德和我一起去。
Harold's coming with me.

2250
02:04:44,018 --> 02:04:45,561
不，你和我一起去。
No, you're coming with me.

2251
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:47,438
不，你和我一起去。
No, you're coming with me.

2252
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:53,861
你会再见到我的，伯伦森医生，因为历史会重演。
You'll be seeing me again, Dr. Berendsen, because history repeats itself.

2253
02:04:53,945 --> 02:04:56,489
再见，老朋友。阿姆斯特丹见。
Goodbye, old friend. We'll see you in Amsterdam.

2254
02:04:57,115 --> 02:04:59,242
哦,不。你不会去阿姆斯特丹的。
Oh, no. You're not going to Amsterdam.

2255
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,326
什么?
What?

2256
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:03,788
盖世太保迟早会破门而入的。
It's only a matter of time before the Gestapo kicks down your door.

2257
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:04,872
毫米。
Mm.

2258
02:05:04,956 --> 02:05:06,332
盖世太保是什么?
What's the Gestapo?

2259
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:08,376
——哦。-是啊，你不会想知道的
- Oh. - Yeah, you don't wanna know.

2260
02:05:09,127 --> 02:05:11,546
我们会送你去更安全的地方。
We'll, uh, send you somewhere safer.

2261
02:05:11,629 --> 02:05:13,881
每年这个时候天气都很好。
Beautiful weather this time of year.

2262
02:05:13,965 --> 02:05:16,342
还有蓝头病毒的迁移。
And the blue-headed vireo migration to boot.

2263
02:05:16,426 --> 02:05:18,219
是的。这是一个壮观的鸟类之乡。
Yes. It's spectacular bird country.

2264
02:05:18,302 --> 02:05:19,429
-不是吗?——真的。
- Isn't it, though? - Really.

2265
02:05:19,512 --> 02:05:21,514
-是的。-我嫉妒。
- Yeah. - I'm jealous.

2266
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:22,598
伯特。
Burt.

2267
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:25,268
伯特，跟我们一起去吧?
Burt, why don't you come with us?

2268
02:05:27,103 --> 02:05:28,271
我选择留下。
I choose to stay.

2269
02:05:28,813 --> 02:05:33,776
谁知道呢?也许我会找到新的生活和新的爱情。-希望如此。
Who knows? Maybe I'll find a new life - and a new love. - I hope so.

2270
02:05:34,902 --> 02:05:38,239
因为说到爱，没有什么比清晰更美好的了。
Because when it comes to love, there's nothing quite so good as clarity.

2271
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:39,949
我同意。
I agree.

2272
02:05:41,451 --> 02:05:47,290
我留下来是为了我的国家，这样有一天，我最好的朋友们可以回来。
I stayed to stand up for my country so that one day, my best friends could come back.

2273
02:05:51,002 --> 02:05:52,128
再见,伯特。
Goodbye, Burt.

2274
02:05:56,883 --> 02:05:58,509
再见，我的好朋友。
Au revoir, my good friend.

2275
02:06:01,804 --> 02:06:03,514
高兴点吧，伯特!
Be happy, Burt!

2276
02:06:05,391 --> 02:06:08,019
——亨利。保罗。将军。-谢谢。
- Henry. Paul. General. - Thank you.

2277
02:06:08,102 --> 02:06:09,854
-再见了。——弥尔顿。
- Farewell for now. - Milton.

2278
02:06:10,897 --> 02:06:12,774
我有点希望和朋友们一起跑步。
Part of me wished I did run with my friends.

2279
02:06:17,862 --> 02:06:19,280
但我没有。
But I didn't.

2280
02:06:21,073 --> 02:06:27,872
你希望你的心和你的子民跟随正确的神回家。
You want for your heart and for your people to follow the right God home.

2281
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:56,317
阿姆斯特丹。
Amsterdam.

2282
02:06:57,109 --> 02:06:58,528
阿姆斯特丹。
Amsterdam.

2283
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:17,588
我在国会委员会，美国人民的最高代表面前，应传票说出我所知道的活动，我认为这些活动可能导致企图…
I appeared before the congressional committee, the highest representation of the American people, under subpoena to tell what I knew of activities, which I believe might lead to an attempt...

2284
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:20,174
建立法西斯独裁政权。
to set up a fascist dictatorship.

2285
02:07:20,258 --> 02:07:30,226
据我所知，计划是组建一个退伍军人组织，作为恫吓或俱乐部，至少可以恐吓政府并瓦解我们的民主制度。
The plan as outlined to me was to form an organization of veterans, to use as a bluff or as a club, at least to intimidate the government and break down our democratic institutions.
