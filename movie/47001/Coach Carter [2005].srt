1
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,411
Yeah! Nice job! Nice pass!

2
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:20,792
St. Francis High School
basketball phenom

3
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:23,292
Ty Crane,
who they recruited just last year,

4
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,658
is widely held as
the next LeBron James.

5
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:28,129
We simply know him
as ''The Crane.''

6
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:30,803
Come on.

7
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,413
Come on, y'all!
Timo, let's go man, come on.

8
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:50,851
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,295
Where you at? Where you at?

10
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:04,970
Pick him up! Pick him up!

11
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,605
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

12
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,041
Right here, right here.

13
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,808
- Blue ball!
- Good D, baby!

14
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,680
- Damn!
- What the hell are you doing, y'all?

15
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,879
- You took three steps this way.
- Yo, l put my fist up, man.

16
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,422
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing
the ball, man. Damn.

17
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,924
- Get your man!
- l knew it. l knew it.

18
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,160
Yeah!

19
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,232
St. Francis is up by 22.

20
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,974
Stay out of my way, bitch.
l own you.

21
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,115
- Oh, hell no!
- Bitch!

22
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,217
Let's go! Let's go!

23
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,813
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

24
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,190
- Let me go!
- Hey! Hey!

25
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,522
l'm good. Get off me!

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,395
Get off me, get off me!

27
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,860
That's it! Game's over!

28
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:10,334
Game's over!

29
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:11,902
Crane. Great game, great game.

30
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:16,166
Tell everyone out there what it
feels like to be the next LeBron James.

31
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:19,937
LeBron James?
l'm the only Ty Crane.

32
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:25,444
All right, you heard it here first,
''the only Ty Crane.''

33
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,150
Why do all the benchwarmers
always got something to say?

34
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:29,788
We watching the damn game,
that's why.

35
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,480
- You got a good view, huh?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,659
Ty Crane outscored
our whole team by himself.

37
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,226
- Wonder how that happened.
- We had nothing but 32 points.

38
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,329
l got 1 2 of them.
What did you get, Kenyon?

39
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,328
Just shut up, dog.
The Crane swooped down on you

40
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,660
and delivered a basket of beat-down.
He clowned you, dog.

41
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:45,633
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.
- He had you on lock the whole game.

42
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,273
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth
before l close it for good.

43
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:49,999
You didn't do shit either
the whole game.

44
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,178
What, homey?
l will slap the taste out your mouth!

45
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,404
- Can we all just get along?
- Shut your little ass up!

46
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,673
- You didn't even play!
- That's what l'm talking about.

47
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,613
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!
- You got two points in 1 6 minutes,

48
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,912
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.
- Exactly!

49
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,556
Timo, you was in the whole time,
you never even touched the rock.

50
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,385
You didn't do shit.
You might as well--

51
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:09,926
- Who was you passing the ball to?
- You were playing and didn't do shit!

52
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:19,938
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond
High School all-American, 1 9 72.

53
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,905
Good to see you, sir.

54
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,269
l was really happy to see you
in the stands tonight.

55
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:27,776
l have to tell you, sir,
l haven't made up my mind yet.

56
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:31,979
As l've told you,
it's time for me to step down.

57
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,449
Last few years
have been really tough.

58
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,622
Well, losing's hard, sir.

59
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,758
This isn't about
losing games, Kenny.

60
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:46,260
l can't get them to show up
for school, for practice.

61
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,963
l can't get parents involved, and l'm
done chasing kids in the streets

62
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,637
and pulling them into the gym.

63
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,463
Yeah, it's a tough job.

64
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,834
Richmond is a tough little city.

65
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:59,473
When l saw you here tonight,
l thought, ''l got him. He's in.''

66
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,512
Well, actually,
l was here for another reason.

67
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:05,344
My son plays for St. Francis.

68
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,042
He does?

69
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,250
- Which kid was he?
- Well, you didn't see him.

70
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,722
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.
- That's great. Great school.

71
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,422
What, you wanna go?

72
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,999
- Hey!
- Lyle, bring it!

73
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,432
Let him go. You think everybody's
scared of you? l ain't scared of you!

74
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:28,972
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be
trying to act all hard all the time, man?

75
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,607
God, l'm sick of you, man!

76
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,346
You know, that school was rough
when l went there.

77
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:39,040
lt's way beyond that now.

78
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,948
Well, then, just forget about it.
Don't even discuss it again.

79
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:46,285
l can't quite do that. Coach officially
offered me the job tonight.

80
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:47,687
The clock's ticking.

81
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,761
And when you say ''offering job,''
there's usually money involved.

82
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:54,365
Yeah, there might be
a thousand bucks in it for me.

83
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:55,966
For five months of work?

84
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,104
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

85
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,535
And the team, it's so bad.

86
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:04,539
Those boys,
they're so angry and undisciplined.

87
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,678
And besides, you know,
you don't have the time.

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,370
You're trying to open up
a second store.

89
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,981
Exactly, l don't have the--
Hell, l don't have any time.

90
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:13,209
And you promised to take
your girlfriend to Mexico.

91
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,887
And l'm definitely
keeping that promise.

92
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,318
There's no way
l'm not going to Mexico

93
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:20,584
and hanging out on the beach
with you in your bikini.

94
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:21,988
l can't take that job.

95
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,930
So when do you start?

96
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,403
- You should've spoken to me first.
- Why?

97
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,971
- lt was a personal choice for me.
- So, what happens to me?

98
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:36,699
You still gonna come to my games?

99
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,743
l'll probably miss most of
your games, Damien. l'm sorry.

100
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:41,470
Then l'll go to Richmond
and play for you.

101
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:42,875
No.

102
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,710
Well, why not?

103
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:49,587
- Dad, you've always been my coach.
- This is a great school, Damien.

104
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,615
lt puts you in a great position
for college.

105
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,258
Dad, l'm a freshman!

106
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,052
Just because l'm coaching
at Richmond,

107
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,729
it doesn't change our plans
for your future, all right?

108
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,753
Yo, my man, l need a vial, man.
You got that good dope? How much?

109
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,708
You forgot to bring your lD,
didn't you?

110
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,935
- l forgot it.
- Every day.

111
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:48,976
Good morning. Ken Carter.

112
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:53,985
- Thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

113
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,749
Hey, yo, what's up?

114
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:04,292
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.
- You too, ma'am.

115
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:08,729
lf the offer still stands,
l'd like to coach the team.

116
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,735
Well, l hope you're up for the task.
These young men need discipline.

117
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,475
The job comes with a $1 ,500 stipend

118
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:19,770
and a major time commitment
for the next four months.

119
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,977
- l accept.
- Great.

120
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,749
We're thrilled to have you.
Gentlemen, l hate to be abrupt,

121
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:28,147
but l do have a budget meeting
l need to run to.

122
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,481
Mr. Carter, is there anything
you need from us?

123
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,059
Well, l just need about
25 copies of this document.

124
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,927
- l'm all set.
- Ray, would you see to it

125
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:41,292
that Mr. Carter--?
Coach Carter gets these copies?

126
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,002
- Will do.
- Gentlemen.

127
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:50,040
l'm not saying this is
not gonna be a challenge,

128
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,710
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

129
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:54,903
Just keep in mind,
these are good boys.

130
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:57,378
Guys! Guys!

131
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:59,176
Guys!

132
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,616
Now, as you know, l've been-- Hey!

133
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,380
You know l've been looking
for a new coach

134
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,718
to take over for me this season.

135
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,420
This is Ken Carter.
He went to Richmond.

136
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,155
He was a two-sport all-American.

137
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,698
Still holds records
for scoring, assists, steals.

138
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:20,339
Basketball scholarship to
George Mason University.

139
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,667
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

140
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,868
Now, let's give him
the respect he's due.

141
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,513
- They're all yours, coach.
- Thank you, sir.

142
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,612
Good afternoon, young men.

143
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,689
As Coach White said, l'm your
new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

144
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,660
l guess l need to speak louder
so you can hear me.

145
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,295
l'm Ken Carter,
your new basketball coach.

146
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,795
We hear you, dog.
But we can't see you.

147
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,501
The glare from your
big, black-ass head

148
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,704
is hella shiny, man.
Damn, do you buff it?

149
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:55,272
Oh, you got jokes to go along
with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

150
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,972
First of all, if you need to know
my credentials,

151
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,546
as Coach White said,
they're on the wall there behind you.

152
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:10,388
Secondly, if basketball practice
starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

153
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:15,153
You, shooting the ball.
What's your name, sir?

154
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,296
Jason Lyle, but l ain't no sir.

155
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:19,896
You're not a sir.

156
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,123
Well, are you a madam?

157
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:27,564
- Little bitch. Bitch.
- As of now, you are a sir.

158
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,469
So are the rest of you.

159
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,236
''Sir'' is a term of respect.

160
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:36,006
And you will have my respect
until you abuse it.

161
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:40,643
Mr. Lyle, how many games
did you guys win last season?

162
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,978
Like four wins, 22 losses.

163
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,451
- Sir.
- Sir.

164
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,226
l'm going to give you contracts.

165
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:57,100
lf you sign and honor
your side of them,

166
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,464
we are going to be successful.

167
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:02,038
Damn, do l get a signing bonus
for signing this contract?

168
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:06,007
Yes, sir.
You get to become a winner.

169
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,178
Because if there's one thing l know,
it is this:

170
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,117
The losing stops now.

171
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,648
Starting today, you will play
like winners, act like winners,

172
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:21,691
and most importantly,
you will be winners.

173
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:25,421
lf you listen and learn,
you'll win basketball games.

174
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:28,924
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

175
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,665
...is the key to winning out there.

176
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:36,599
This contract states that you will
maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

177
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,640
You will attend all your classes

178
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:41,609
and you will sit in the front row
of those classes.

179
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,476
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.
- Excuse me.

180
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:47,346
- Did you say something, sir?
- Worm was wondering,

181
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:50,488
are you some country church nigga,
with your tie on and all that?

182
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,282
- Right.
- That's what you wanna say, right?

183
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:53,720
And what is your name, sir?

184
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,958
l'm Timo Cruz, sir.

185
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:59,356
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

186
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,034
what you should both know
is we treat ourselves with respect.

187
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:06,671
We don't use the word ''nigga.''

188
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,773
Are you some preacher man
or some shit?

189
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:11,205
Because God ain't gonna do you
no good in this neighborhood.

190
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,504
- l live in this neighborhood, sir.
- Sir.

191
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:16,705
Can you believe
this uppity Negro, sir?

192
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,909
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

193
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,521
- ...leave the gym right now.
- For what?

194
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:27,557
l'll ask you one last time
to leave the gym

195
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,287
- before l help you leave.
- Before you what?

196
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,127
Do you even know who l am?

197
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,862
From what l can see, a very confused
and scared young man.

198
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:41,505
Scared of who? Scared of you?
l'm supposed to be scared of you?

199
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:44,775
Nigga, l ain't scared of nobody.
l will lay your ass out.

200
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,239
l don't think so.

201
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,741
All right.

202
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,589
What you doing? Get off me!

203
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,621
Teachers ain't supposed
to touch students.

204
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,629
l'm not a teacher.

205
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,226
l'm your new basketball coach.

206
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,147
This ain't over!

207
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:39,596
ls there anybody else
who's not feeling this contract?

208
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,231
Come on, man, where you going?

209
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,662
l don't do high school contracts.

210
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:49,374
Tell us when you need
the real ballers.

211
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:51,668
l will do that, sir.

212
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:53,679
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

213
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:54,373
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

214
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,743
Then l guess we'll have new
leading scorers this season, huh?

215
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,714
Now, l cannot teach you the game
of basketball

216
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:05,914
until your conditioning is at a level
that allows me to do so.

217
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,288
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

218
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:13,631
To the baseline!

219
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,838
l presume you all know
what suicides are.

220
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,271
So...

221
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,777
l saw the St. Francis game
the other night.

222
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:39,015
None of you have a problem
shooting the ball.

223
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:42,885
You all had a problem
getting up and down the court.

224
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,821
lf you are late, you will run.

225
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:50,900
lf you give me attitude,
you will do push-ups.

226
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,239
So you can push-up or shut up.

227
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,907
That's up to you.

228
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,539
- Yo, how many we gonna do?
- Sir.

229
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:02,170
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

230
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:07,444
Let's see how many you can do
in one hour and seven minutes.

231
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,021
Fellas, don't make me
commit homicide.

232
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,757
l said, suicides!
Put your hand on the line!

233
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,828
Put your hand on the line!

234
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:24,035
Damn, l can't keep this shit up, man.
l can barely walk.

235
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:27,673
- l know, my legs is hella sore, son.
- Need some Gatorade or something.

236
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,867
- There go your girl right there, son.
- Yeah.

237
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,638
Hey, what's with you and her homeys?
You gonna try to holler at them?

238
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:37,042
Man, l'm hollering
at both of the friends.

239
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,842
- Both of them?
- Yeah, because l need that.

240
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:42,043
You know, l need variety in my life.
l can't just have one girl.

241
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:43,620
You know what l'm saying?
l need both.

242
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,051
Hey.

243
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:46,520
- What's up, baby?
- How you doing?

244
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,889
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard
about that two-for-one special, right?

245
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:53,994
Two of you, one of me.
Now, that's special.

246
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,895
- Please. Whatever, Worm.
- Yeah, special ed.

247
00:15:58,137 --> 00:15:59,695
- Get your arm off me.
- l like this fox.

248
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,305
You working that chinchilla.
But, look, baby, me and you...

249
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:06,069
You need to tell him to stop playing it
so close. She don't even like him.

250
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:11,210
- Why not? Worm's the man.
- Worm is Worm.

251
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,516
Anyway, l got something
for the baby today.

252
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,735
We don't even know if it's a baby yet.
l mean, it's kind of early.

253
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,630
You ain't even been
to the doctor yet.

254
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:35,932
Hello? l passed the pregnancy test,
Kenyon. Three times.

255
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,177
- These are kind of cute, though.
- l know, l got good taste, right?

256
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,852
Yeah, all right.

257
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:50,049
Precious little shoes.

258
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:53,316
Well, l got a little
somethin'-somethin' for you too.

259
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,219
Thank you.

260
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,095
This definitely is a little something.

261
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:06,496
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

262
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,268
Kenyon!

263
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,739
- What? What's up?
- What are you doing? Give me!

264
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,775
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

265
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,537
You got that for 99 cents?
l've been there.

266
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:18,683
You can get three brooms and a bucket
for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

267
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:21,819
That's like thread.
That's not even half a shoelace.

268
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:25,555
Well, would you like to see me
in this shoelace?

269
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,552
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

270
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:33,459
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

271
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:36,293
Three push-ups and move.
One! Two! Three!

272
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,332
Let's go. Explode!

273
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:41,836
Let me hear you. Let me hear you!
Let me hear it.

274
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,236
Explode! Worm, explode!

275
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:45,808
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

276
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,070
Give me five!
Just give me five! Push!

277
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,306
Push! Go! Go!
Let me hear you!

278
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:54,714
Come on, close out!
Explode! Let's go!

279
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:59,015
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

280
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:05,555
That's ten suicides for the
whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

281
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:07,231
This ain't the track team, man.

282
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,867
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

283
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,536
But you're right.

284
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:15,907
And because you're right,
that's 20 suicides for the entire team

285
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,269
and you get the privilege
of joining Mr. Battle

286
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,310
- with 250 push-ups of your own.
- What, are you serious?

287
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:23,277
- Yeah.
- This is bullshit!

288
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:27,115
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

289
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,843
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

290
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:30,487
Because you gave
such a good answer

291
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,213
and you gave the coach attitude,

292
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:35,952
you win the bonus prize
of 500 push-ups!

293
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,421
And would you like to go
for the grand prize of a thousand?

294
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,828
No, sir.

295
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:47,839
To the baseline!
On my whistle! Let's go!

296
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,837
J.B., come on, baby.

297
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,867
l can't even move, son.
Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

298
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:56,013
- You can't say nothing to him.
- Why can't l say nothing to him?

299
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,506
l'm a white boy? Man, what the--?

300
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,752
Right here. Right here.
Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

301
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:04,112
Where you going, homey?
Where you going, huh?

302
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,483
- l ain't got shit.
- What?

303
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:08,159
Please don't shoot me, man.
Go on, take my bag, dog!

304
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,328
Run your shit, homey!

305
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,796
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

306
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,506
Yo, l'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

307
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:24,403
l'm just playing, B.
Look at you!

308
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:28,778
Damn! l seen y'all
walking from up the block

309
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,472
like somebody put a pipe
in your asses.

310
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,718
You all right, dog?

311
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,547
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

312
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:39,280
but y'all damn sure
look sad without me.

313
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:41,551
But you know what?
l'm gonna watch y'all play.

314
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,193
See y'all get your asses kicked.

315
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:47,695
Yo! l'd love to shoot the shit with
you bitches all night, but l gotta go.

316
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,194
- All right.
- Yo, who that, man?

317
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,165
That's my cousin, Renny.

318
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:53,895
l'm gonna check y'all.
Come on, let's go.

319
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:56,073
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

320
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,640
- No, l'm straight, man.
- You sure?

321
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,674
- Yeah, l'm good.
- All right, my nigga.

322
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,074
- One love.
- All right, Lyle!

323
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:06,240
Don't let nobody else put a pipe
up your ass, or you might like it!

324
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:13,090
Hey, you was scared, huh?
l wasn't scared.

325
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,983
The state only requires
that they have a 2.0 average to play.

326
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:17,685
Now, you got in here
they need a 2.3.

327
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:21,196
lf you have a 2.0, you have to score
at least 1 050 on the SAT

328
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,924
to be eligible
for an athletic scholarship.

329
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:27,467
lf you have a 2.3,
you only need 950.

330
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:30,334
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

331
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,542
lt shouldn't be that hard
to maintain a C-plus.

332
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:36,108
These boys are student athletes.

333
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:38,310
''Student'' comes first.

334
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:42,010
lt says they gotta wear
coat and ties on game days.

335
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:44,746
They don't own ties!
You gonna supply the ties?

336
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,016
There's a Goodwill
and a Salvation Army store

337
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,251
less than two blocks from here.

338
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:51,929
They got a box full of ties
for 50 cents apiece.

339
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:53,995
Yo, man, what you
trying to say, huh?

340
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,660
Oh, we too good to shop at the
Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

341
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:00,303
- Yeah, l ain't that broke.
- This is crazy!

342
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,340
A dress code and they have to sit
in the front row in class?

343
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:08,309
- This is basketball, man!
- And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

344
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:11,447
lf you want to play basketball
on this team,

345
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,380
these are the simple rules
you have to follow

346
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:17,317
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

347
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:20,850
Now, if you decide
to follow these simple rules,

348
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:24,890
l need you and the boys
to sign this contract.

349
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:29,028
They can bring the contracts
to practice tomorrow.

350
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:31,168
lf you come to practice.

351
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:34,529
l wanna thank you all for coming out
and showing your support,

352
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:37,674
and l hope l have your support
the rest of the season.

353
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,672
- Good night.
- Get up and leave like that?

354
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:44,110
Look, l have a hard enough time
getting my nephew to...

355
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:48,582
- How you gonna make them wear ties?
- l want the other coach back!

356
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,826
lt's one of your contracts, sir.
l've amended that contract.

357
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:08,306
You require your players
to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

358
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,168
l've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

359
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:14,606
You require ten hours of community
service, and l've committed to 50.

360
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:19,011
Any unexcused absences, any other
disciplinary issues at school,

361
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:22,381
you can nullify this agreement
and send me to any school you want.

362
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,623
And how many days do l have
to consider this offer?

363
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,190
None.

364
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,986
The second page
is a letter you need to sign

365
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:32,288
that confirms my withdrawal
from St. Francis.

366
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:34,922
- They know l'm leaving.
- What?

367
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,658
- You withdrew from St. Francis?
- l called Richmond.

368
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:40,633
- They expect me there in the morning.
- You called Richmond?

369
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,837
You should have spoken to me
about this.

370
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,176
lt was a personal choice for me.

371
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:51,906
Well, l can fix all that in the morning.

372
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:55,753
Sir, please listen.
All l wanna do is play for you.

373
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:57,980
lf l'm one of the top students
at Richmond,

374
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,689
l mean one of the top in the whole
school, and l have great SATs,

375
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:04,226
l can go to any college
in the country.

376
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,995
l'm asking you to trust me.

377
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,401
You really wanna do this, huh?

378
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,465
Okay.

379
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:21,112
Part of growing up
is making your own decisions

380
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:24,111
and living with the consequences.

381
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,312
3.7.

382
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:35,655
And you will earn every minute
of playing time.

383
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:40,294
Open it, please.

384
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,724
Morning, sir.

385
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:49,871
My name is J. Lyle
They call me wild

386
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:53,869
lt's all right
Kenyon's mom tonight

387
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,172
- Say what?
- You might think l'm wrong

388
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:58,579
But she's got these thongs

389
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:02,248
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
lt's Malcolm X from St. Francis.

390
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,088
- Hey, yo, Malcolm!
- Whatever.

391
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,621
- What's up, man?
- What are you doing here, son?

392
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,387
- l transferred to Richmond.
- Oh, no, son, l think you're just lost.

393
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:13,087
Well, l am actually lost.
Can you tell me how to get to...?

394
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:16,597
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm,
tell your man Fresh Prince here

395
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:19,771
- how to get to his mansion.
- Fresh bitch.

396
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:26,872
l hope seeing you in this hallway mean
l get to see you on the court today.

397
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:32,174
l can't wait. With your five browns.

398
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,885
Everybody up.

399
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,283
Today we're going to play defense.

400
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:43,317
Sorry, sir.

401
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:47,497
Gentlemen, this is a new player,
Damien Carter.

402
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,466
He is my son, and he is late.

403
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,137
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

404
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:55,135
Sir, it's my first day of school,
l had to stay--

405
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,240
Basketball practice starts at 3.

406
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,045
As of 2:55, you are late.
Get changed in the locker room.

407
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:05,148
Do your suicides on the far side
of the court so as not to disturb us.

408
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,682
All right, gentlemen,
give me two lines!

409
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:12,349
Okay, young sirs, we're gonna
take it to the next level.

410
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:15,719
Everything l knew about basketball,

411
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,818
l learned from women.

412
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:22,023
l have a sister, her name's Diane.

413
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:26,498
She was always on my case
about every little thing.

414
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:29,206
Matter of fact, she still is.

415
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:32,707
''Turn down that radio!
You eat the last piece of cake?

416
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,902
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?''

417
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:38,408
She was always in my face.

418
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,775
So when l call ''Diane,''

419
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:44,649
we're gonna play straight
man-to-man pressure defense.

420
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:51,928
Worm! No, no, no, no, sir.

421
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:53,392
Look at your defensive posture.

422
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,965
Come on. Split your man.
Back straight, butt down.

423
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,161
This hand guards against the passing
lane, this hand protects the crossover.

424
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,137
All right? Palms up!
Get your head in the game.

425
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,043
Now we have Delilah.

426
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,643
She was my childhood sweetheart.

427
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,246
Sir, was she hot?

428
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:15,045
Oh, yes, sir.
She was steaming hot.

429
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:20,823
But she was the devil.
That girl was evil.

430
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:24,127
l remember once she tricked me
into stealing brownies

431
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,730
from Christ the King
First Baptist Church bake sale.

432
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,101
She smiled
and got her way out of it,

433
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:33,099
while l damn near had to wear
a pillow on my butt

434
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:34,932
for a month
before l could sit down.

435
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,774
Delilah, gentlemen.
She's our trap defense.

436
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:43,406
Take notes, freshman. This is as
close as you gonna get to playing.

437
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:49,247
Come on, come on. Move, move!
Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!

438
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,426
Now, l know you're all
concerned that

439
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,792
we didn't work
on our offense during practice.

440
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,025
We have all season to do that.

441
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:07,568
But what did we do in practice,
Mr. Stone?

442
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,137
- Run.
- That's right.

443
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,867
So, what do you think l want you
to do on offense tonight?

444
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,473
- Run?
- Correct again.

445
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,911
l want you to run.

446
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:23,247
l want you to run every second
that clock is ticking, all game long.

447
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,455
Put him back on the bench!

448
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:35,928
Rebound! Rebound!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

449
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,896
Nice pass, baby!

450
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:45,771
Push it! Push it!

451
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:48,441
- Screen.
- Screen, baby. Screen. Screen.

452
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:50,744
- Worm.
- Let's go, Worm.

453
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:00,655
Stay alert! Pick him up right there!

454
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,191
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- What's the call, ref?

455
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:06,193
White four, fifth.
He's out of the game.

456
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,695
- Oh, ref, come--
- That's his fifth foul, coach.

457
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:10,834
- Time, sir.
- Time out, white.

458
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:13,504
Bad call, ref!
That was a jump ball, damn it!

459
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,297
- Time out, white.
- Come on, fellas.

460
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,100
Come on, huddle up. Hustle up.
Get over here.

461
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,675
All right. Huddle up, huddle up.

462
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:22,870
- Carter, you're in.
- But, coach, he a freshman.

463
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,810
You wanna coach?

464
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:28,715
All right, take a deep breath, guys.
Come on, deep breaths.

465
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,552
- You tired?
- No, sir.

466
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,551
Those guys are exhausted.

467
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,624
That's why this guy's gonna miss
that free throw.

468
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:38,853
When he does,
Worm and Lyle are our first option.

469
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:42,430
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole.
Everybody attack the boards, got that?

470
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,727
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Richmond on three.

471
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,897
- One, two, three!
- Richmond!

472
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,733
- All right, let's out, all right?
- Step it up, let's go!

473
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,806
Look alive out there.

474
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,406
All right, guys, you're in better shape
than they are. Push it.

475
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,209
Box out, box out.

476
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,717
One shot.

477
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:10,024
Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!

478
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:11,956
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, baby!

479
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,073
All right.

480
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:28,971
Kenyon!

481
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:32,346
- Worm!
- Yo, yo.

482
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,417
Oh, yeah!

483
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,979
Yeah! That's what l'm talking about!

484
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:49,932
- Tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog.
- lt was all you.

485
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:51,432
A win like that don't mean nothing,

486
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,194
because they can't play anyway,
you feel me?

487
00:29:56,675 --> 00:30:00,771
Okay, Shaq, so you dominated
down low tonight. Any thoughts?

488
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:04,776
l dropped a 20-piece.
Kobe played his game.

489
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,144
We the champions
till we ain't the champions no more.

490
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:10,150
- Junior Battle.
- Undefeated until...

491
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:12,083
Yo, man, on the real,

492
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,155
that was the worst game
l've ever seen in my life.

493
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,827
l thought that shit would never end.
l was dying in the bleachers.

494
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,996
That's right, you were in
the bleachers, weren't you?

495
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:20,755
We were on the court
handling our business.

496
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,194
That's right. We 1 -0, bitch.

497
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:26,996
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B,
and y'all barely beat them.

498
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,104
Damn, Timo,
why you throwing salt, man?

499
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,969
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

500
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:34,042
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

501
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,237
l'll knock all y'all off.

502
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:10,308
- Yo. l'll check y'all later, all right?
- All right.

503
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:13,075
Yo. Let's do this.

504
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:22,357
- What's up?
- Here's two bundles.

505
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:25,325
- All right.
- Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

506
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,054
Yo, l got you.

507
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:30,534
- How you doing, man?
- Chilling, man.

508
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,600
You look good.

509
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,132
Got some paper for you.

510
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:38,700
Now we're talking, yeah.

511
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,274
How you living, Timo?

512
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:46,614
l'm good.

513
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,346
- You all right? For real?
- Yeah.

514
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:53,690
- Here, take some.
- l'm all right.

515
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:56,861
No, no, no, take some, please.

516
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:59,863
You did good, man.
You're doing good, bro.

517
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,525
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me, thank you.

518
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:06,327
You earned it.

519
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:11,736
Take a nickel bag, okay?

520
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:15,009
Go get yourself something, man.

521
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:19,641
- l'm gonna see you?
- Yeah, next week.

522
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:20,977
Okay, l'm gonna see you.

523
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,720
- Keep it up.
- Yeah.

524
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:43,571
Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.

525
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:45,736
Rafeca, l see you looking.

526
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:48,845
Ain't nobody
thinking about you, Worm.

527
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:50,947
- Oh, okay.
- Gentlemen,

528
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:53,083
let's review the Hercules game,
shall we?

529
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:55,116
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

530
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,551
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

531
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:00,884
No, sir. l had 1 2 points
and eight assists, sir.

532
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:05,552
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five
turnovers and four missed free throws.

533
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:09,764
Now, we're talking
about fundamentals here.

534
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:14,496
Until we learn them, l'm adding
a practice every morning at 6 a.m.

535
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:18,869
- Six a.m.?
- We shot 56 percent at--

536
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,203
Mr. Cruz.

537
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,046
Are you lost, sir?

538
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,710
What l gotta do to play?

539
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:31,082
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know
the answer to that question.

540
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,485
Now, as l was saying,

541
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:38,527
as a team,
we shot 56 percent from the line.

542
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,528
From now on,
before you leave my gym,

543
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:47,033
you must pay an exit price of 50
made free throws before you can go.

544
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:49,069
- What?
- That's everybody.

545
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:51,401
- Come on.
- That's a lot of free throws.

546
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,247
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

547
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:58,749
Before you can play on this team...

548
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:01,845
...you owe me...

549
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:06,623
...2,500 push-ups...

550
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:08,452
...and 1 ,000 suicides.

551
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,355
- Damn.
- Damn.

552
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:16,228
And they must be
completed by Friday.

553
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:19,266
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.
- He ain't making that.

554
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:23,399
Today's flavor: offense.

555
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:25,576
- Now we talking.
- Now, l have a sister.

556
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,938
Her name is Linda.

557
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,611
Linda is smart, she's political.

558
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,011
Well, actually, she's radical.

559
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,949
Linda's got a big Afro.

560
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:41,023
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

561
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,553
Before we get into that,
let's warm up.

562
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:45,822
Give me a lay-up line.

563
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:47,964
- Let's go.
- All right.

564
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,793
Let's do it.

565
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:52,764
- Damn, how many sisters he got?
- Who knows.

566
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:54,802
- Come on, get two more over here.
- Break it out.

567
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:58,340
- Let's go, guys.
- Energy, guys, energy.

568
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:00,033
We got this, let's go.

569
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,507
- l'm open.
- l got him, l got him.

570
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,271
Right here, right here.
l'm open. l'm open.

571
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,778
l'm sorry.

572
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:06,007
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

573
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:07,309
- Come on.
- lt's not my fault.

574
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,713
- He was early.
- Hey.

575
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,584
Yes, it's important to move
without the ball,

576
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,623
but you gotta be patient
on the weak-side screen.

577
00:35:14,826 --> 00:35:18,853
Set up your man
and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

578
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:21,190
Okay. Switch it up.

579
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,867
We got it, come on.
Let's go. Let's get it.

580
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:27,003
- And call out them picks.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

581
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:32,343
What is your deepest fear,
Mr. Cruz?

582
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:35,102
That you're inadequate?

583
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,078
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

584
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,417
Go home.

585
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,724
All right, l want seven passes
before you shoot.

586
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:50,622
- Seven.
- All right.

587
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:53,928
- l got him. l got him.
- Get that ball in there.

588
00:35:57,268 --> 00:36:00,066
You know your task is impossible
before Friday, right?

589
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:05,574
Move.

590
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,870
Work it, work it.

591
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,446
Run it back.

592
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:35,871
What time your mom getting home?

593
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:37,837
She doesn't get off for another hour.

594
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,716
Oh, that's Myles.

595
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,717
What?

596
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:07,938
Say, ''Hi, Uncle Kenyon.''

597
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,935
Say, ''Hi.''

598
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:11,403
All right, don't worry about it.

599
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,169
He'll go back to sleep
right after his bottle.

600
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:15,607
Right, boo-boo?

601
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:18,179
Yeah, probably in time
for your mom to get home.

602
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:20,851
Or when your cousin get back
from getting her hair fried and dyed,

603
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:23,748
like she can afford all that shit.
lt's her baby anyway.

604
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:27,152
Well, my mother had to work
a double shift,

605
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:28,916
but they cut her overtime.

606
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,425
And my cousin,
don't be trying to dis her.

607
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,392
You said we'd be alone.
You call this alone?

608
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:36,361
Well, that's why we need
our own spot.

609
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:41,335
Did you turn this off?

610
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:44,736
- Yeah, it was boiling.
- Oh, come on.

611
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:46,808
Well, turn it down, not off.

612
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:50,811
This is milk, butter and cheese.
We can't afford to waste this.

613
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:53,344
And hold him up.

614
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:02,923
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

615
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:05,027
All right, Myles, here we go.

616
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,720
Gotta cool off a minute.

617
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,396
Ever think about what you were
gonna do before you were pregnant?

618
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:18,838
What you mean,
going to junior college?

619
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,203
Yeah.

620
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:22,936
l mean, yeah, l thought about it.

621
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:26,148
l could go later, l guess.

622
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:29,013
You have to get some work
after you have the baby.

623
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:31,182
Me too.

624
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:34,184
- So l'll work.
- How you gonna go to school?

625
00:38:34,392 --> 00:38:36,053
Why you asking me
all these questions?

626
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,854
And you gotta put your hands
under his arm.

627
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,896
You gotta sit him on your chest.
Hold him.

628
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:45,535
- l am holding him.
- You ain't doing it right.

629
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:47,204
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

630
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:48,962
Look...

631
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:52,707
l don't know how to do this.

632
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,608
You'll get it.

633
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:58,281
Right?

634
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:05,187
Look, l gotta help my mom
with some stuff.

635
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:08,755
- See you later, all right?
- All right.

636
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:12,853
Call me later, okay?

637
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,959
Later.

638
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,294
All right, keep it riding on somebody.

639
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:22,529
- Don't get lost in there.
- Move it. Move it.

640
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:25,603
Stay with your man.

641
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:28,478
- Box out, box out!
- Position.

642
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:32,213
Guys...

643
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,983
Up. Up.

644
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:35,152
Hey, hey, hey.

645
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,844
You don't get to your man, stand,
watch the ball.

646
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,581
When the ball goes up,
get in good defensive position,

647
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,727
get your body on your man
and explode to the ball.

648
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,294
All right? Let's go.

649
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:47,793
Run it. You got it.

650
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:50,432
- Go on, do it.
- Forward pass. Forward pass.

651
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:52,398
- Work it.
- There you go.

652
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:55,800
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling
a very different story.

653
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:58,407
l wish you would.
Yes, ma'am, l'm here all week.

654
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,711
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?

655
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:03,312
Oh, they're great, ma'am. We're 1 -0.

656
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:04,913
Very good.

657
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,378
How may l help you?

658
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:10,415
Well, l had my boys sign contracts

659
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:13,283
requiring them to meet
certain academic standards.

660
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:16,124
Yes, l believe one of the faculty
members mentioned that.

661
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,192
Very interesting scare tactic.

662
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:22,297
Well, in order for that
to be successful,

663
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,128
l need their teachers to fill out
weekly progress reports

664
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,395
so l'll know how the boys
are doing in their classrooms.

665
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:31,340
- Okay.
- Well, l haven't received anything

666
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:32,736
from their teachers.

667
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:39,647
l don't see how this ties in to your job
as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

668
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:43,719
Well, l took this job with the
understanding l could do it my way.

669
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:45,316
And you can.

670
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:47,286
Our next faculty meeting
is in two weeks.

671
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:48,925
l'll remember to bring it up.

672
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:52,756
Why, that would be great.
Thank you, ma'am.

673
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:55,862
Thank you, sir.

674
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,370
Bring it in, guys.

675
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:02,605
Let's go, hustle up.

676
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:04,604
Yo, bring it in, y'all.

677
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,775
All right, that's it for today.

678
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:10,743
We have a game tomorrow,
so get some rest tonight.

679
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:15,385
And remember,
ties and jackets tomorrow.

680
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,948
Clyde.

681
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,321
Mr. Cruz.

682
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:32,364
l'm impressed with
what you've done.

683
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,103
But you came up short.

684
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:38,104
You owe me 80 suicides
and 500 push-ups.

685
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:42,174
Please leave my gym.

686
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,673
Thanks, Clyde.

687
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,417
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

688
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:52,884
l'll do push-ups for him.

689
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:00,253
You said we're a team.

690
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:04,061
One person struggles,
we all struggle.

691
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:07,330
One player triumphs,
we all triumph, right?

692
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:25,479
l'll do some.

693
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,251
l'll run suicides too.

694
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:06,595
l'll do some too.

695
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:15,767
Clyde, keep count.

696
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:19,943
Call me when they're done.

697
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:26,541
Defense! Defense!

698
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:28,810
Push it. Push it. Move, move!

699
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,282
Let's go.

700
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:32,147
Ball, ball, ball.

701
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:35,489
Ball, ball, ball.

702
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:37,651
- Yeah!
- Go.

703
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:42,627
Move your feet, move your feet.

704
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:44,801
Go, defense. Go.

705
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:47,227
Good job. Good job.

706
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:48,665
- Worm.
- White ball.

707
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:53,037
Palms up, move your feet, right?
Come out. Come out. Come out.

708
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:54,734
- Mr. Cruz!
- Good game, boy.

709
00:43:57,882 --> 00:43:59,509
Hey, hey.

710
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:02,676
What is your deepest fear,
young man?

711
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,048
Go on.

712
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:09,724
Why he keep saying that, ''What's
your deepest fear?'' What that mean?

713
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:12,896
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

714
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,997
Move. Move. Move.

715
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,031
No, one more pass.

716
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,541
Hands up.

717
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:15,652
Three points, Cruz!

718
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:20,659
What the hell are you doing, Cruz?
You allergic to lay-ups?

719
00:45:20,898 --> 00:45:23,128
You do that again and you're going
to be glued to the bench.

720
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:29,001
- Swing it.
- Right here.

721
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:35,710
Come on, last kick.

722
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:38,404
Kick it in. Kick it in. Let's go.

723
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:49,355
You can't guard me, can you?
What you gonna do?

724
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,790
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?
- Delilah. Delilah.

725
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:54,362
Come on, come on, come on.

726
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,066
- Shot.
- Yeah, Jason.

727
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:01,795
Kenyon, pose for me.

728
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:05,533
- Smile.
- Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!

729
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:07,904
Just play the damn game.

730
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:10,705
Linda, Linda, Linda!

731
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:15,285
There he is. Yeah.

732
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:18,387
That's me, baby.
That's me. l did that.

733
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:20,989
l drew that up. Yeah.

734
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:23,521
Run it again.

735
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:27,826
All right, 1 -4, 1 -4.
Linda, Linda, Linda!

736
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:35,564
All day, baby. All day!
Can't stop that.

737
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:37,673
Can't stop that!

738
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:42,768
- Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Worm.

739
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:48,146
Look at that bow. Look at that.

740
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:51,082
l tied that. l tied that shit.

741
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:53,256
Can l get something on the bow?
Let me get some.

742
00:46:54,225 --> 00:46:55,692
Are you crazy?

743
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,251
What is wrong with you?

744
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,726
What's wrong with all of you?

745
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:04,497
Since when is winning not enough?

746
00:47:04,702 --> 00:47:08,069
Playing hard not enough?

747
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:11,942
No, you have to humiliate
your opponent.

748
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:14,941
Taunt him after every score.

749
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:17,880
You won four games last season.

750
00:47:18,082 --> 00:47:19,276
Four.

751
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:22,714
What gives you the right
to taint the game that l love

752
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,616
with trash talk and taunting?

753
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:29,122
What gives you the right to wear
Richmond on your chests

754
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:30,418
and act like punks?

755
00:47:30,628 --> 00:47:33,062
- Coach, they were jawing too.
- So?

756
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:34,889
You can't show some class?

757
00:47:35,132 --> 00:47:37,566
Act like a champion?

758
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:43,234
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

759
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:46,140
On the line. Now.

760
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:49,335
- Damn.
- Oh, man, come on.

761
00:48:05,336 --> 00:48:08,636
Listen, shorty, l'm just gonna be real
with you, okay?

762
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,793
You're my girl.

763
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:14,436
l get out on that court
and everything is just getting crazy,

764
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:17,368
all l gotta do is just think about you.

765
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:18,769
Mr. Lyle.

766
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:21,840
Why aren't you in...

767
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:25,677
- ...geometry?
- l'm going there right now, sir.

768
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,382
- Sir, this is Betty.
- Bella.

769
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:30,451
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

770
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,246
Go to class.

771
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:40,819
Don't forget that these projects
are due at the end of this week.

772
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:44,228
- So if any of you need extra time--
- Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

773
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:46,527
- Yes.
- l...

774
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:49,870
...don't see Junior Battle
in this class.

775
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:52,975
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

776
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:57,170
We rarely see him, but when we do,
it's always special.

777
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:00,648
Thank you.

778
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:05,378
''Surprise arrival to the poll
is Richmond High at 1 9th.''

779
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:08,285
- Top 20, baby.
- We're 1 9th, dog.

780
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:10,756
''The Oilers have posted
a perfect 9-0 mark,

781
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:12,952
winning on the road against
perennial powerhouses

782
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:14,562
Xavier and Baxter Union.''

783
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:20,259
Junior, you should read
the rest of this.

784
00:49:20,504 --> 00:49:22,301
They blowing you up
in this paper.

785
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,868
- Come on, man, read it.
- Man, you know he can't read.

786
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:28,772
- Man, shut up.
- Shut up, Maddux.

787
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:35,410
''Richmond center has been big
as the Oilers are 'boyed.'''

788
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:39,555
Buoyed. The word is ''buoyed.''

789
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:45,221
''Buoyed by Junior Battle's
1 9.8-rebound-a-night numbers.''

790
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:49,093
See, that's my big nigga
right there, son. Hey.

791
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,801
lf you was any bigger,
you'd be my bigger nigga.

792
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:55,438
Sit down. Sit down!

793
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:10,812
''Nigger'' is a derogatory term
used to insult our ancestors.

794
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:14,883
See, if a white man used it,
you'd be ready to fight.

795
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:17,925
Your using it teaches him to use it.

796
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:21,120
You're saying it's cool.
Well, it's not cool.

797
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:23,595
And when you're around me,
l don't wanna hear that shit.

798
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,359
- We clear?
- Yes, sir.

799
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:28,036
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

800
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:29,535
Yes, sir.

801
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:32,969
Mr. Worm,

802
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:35,645
what is it you want
out of this basketball season?

803
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,479
To win that state championship, sir.

804
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:44,713
Well, who won the state basketball
championship last season, Lyle?

805
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:46,986
Hell if l know, sir.

806
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:49,356
Does anybody know?

807
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:53,953
Okay.

808
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:57,025
What's your father do for a living,
Mr. Lyle?

809
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:03,372
My father's in jail, sir.

810
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,037
Well, l'm sorry to hear that, sir.

811
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:11,771
But that doesn't have to be your life.

812
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,550
My point's this:

813
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:17,084
l have four seniors on this team,

814
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:20,256
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

815
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:24,223
All of whom l think can play
basketball at the college level.

816
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:25,792
College.

817
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:29,799
That's a viable option for all of you.

818
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,136
But you have to perform in the
classroom to have that chance.

819
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:36,868
You have to have a vision.

820
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:42,002
Tell me, how do you
see yourselves?

821
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,706
ESPN, baby.

822
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:49,483
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

823
00:51:49,686 --> 00:51:54,180
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't
see you in his classroom very often.

824
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:57,183
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

825
00:51:57,394 --> 00:51:59,385
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

826
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:03,066
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

827
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:05,030
Oh, you can practice,
but you can't play

828
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:08,830
until Mr. Gesek tells me
you're caught up in his class.

829
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:11,506
And that's a shout out
to the rest of you.

830
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,107
You signed a contract.

831
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,005
You made a commitment.

832
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:18,409
Now, l have your schedules and l'll be
getting reports from your teachers.

833
00:52:18,982 --> 00:52:22,816
lf you don't perform in the
classroom, you will not play.

834
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:25,418
What's up with that?

835
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:27,620
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

836
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,027
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

837
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:38,633
Man, this is bullshit!
We won those games, not you.

838
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:41,862
That's 1 ,000 push-ups
for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

839
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:44,266
You wanna try for 2,000?

840
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:06,594
Young man, think about the choice
you're making if you walk out that door.

841
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:17,207
To the baseline.

842
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:24,508
All right. How about LaQuisha,
if it's a girl.

843
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:29,209
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto
called and they want they name back.

844
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:31,512
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

845
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:34,020
You might as well call the baby
Food Stamp.

846
00:53:34,224 --> 00:53:35,816
You're stupid.

847
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:40,554
All right, l was thinking
l could call her Harmony.

848
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:43,732
- l like Harmony.
- Harmony, oh, that's good. l like that.

849
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:47,199
- What did Kenyon say?
- Please, he want a boy.

850
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:49,770
- Figures.
- Speaking of Michael Jordan...

851
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:51,372
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

852
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:55,200
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men,
and men ain't worth the trouble.

853
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:57,778
Don't you have someplace to go?
Something to do?

854
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:01,578
Guess he wants me all to himself.

855
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:02,809
See you later.

856
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,681
Don't forget,
l need your notes for history.

857
00:54:04,888 --> 00:54:08,085
- All right, l got you.
- Yeah. See you later.

858
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,219
l bought us tickets to the dance.

859
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:15,463
Why you telling these
loudmouth girls about the baby?

860
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:17,633
Now everybody's gonna know.

861
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:19,358
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

862
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:22,770
- lt's not people's business, Kyra.
- Why you jumping down my throat?

863
00:54:22,973 --> 00:54:24,406
What's wrong with you?

864
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:29,742
Look, me and coach been talking,
and he thinks l can play college ball.

865
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:30,971
All right, so?

866
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:34,373
So how am l gonna do that
and raise a baby?

867
00:54:37,154 --> 00:54:40,612
l don't know. l mean,
l'm not saying it won't be hard.

868
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:43,223
Hard? lt's already hard.

869
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:44,985
The kid ain't even here yet
and l'm worried

870
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:48,323
about how l'm gonna feed it,
how l'm gonna pay for this and that.

871
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:49,992
Everything.

872
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,368
- l'm not ready.
- So, what are you saying?

873
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:55,663
You want out?
ls that what you're saying?

874
00:54:55,906 --> 00:54:57,373
Go ahead and say it.

875
00:54:57,574 --> 00:55:00,338
Look, if l wanted to be out,
l would've been out by now, Kyra.

876
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:02,239
That's not it at all. l love you.

877
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:03,840
l wanna be with you.

878
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:06,072
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

879
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:07,648
l'm thinking about
what's best for us.

880
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:10,081
You're not trying to think about
what's best for both of us,

881
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:11,879
you're thinking about
what's best for you.

882
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:15,725
You don't want me to have this baby.
You wanna leave Richmond.

883
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:18,759
You wanna go play college ball.
So guess what?

884
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:22,898
We ain't got to be ready enough
for nothing, all right?

885
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,993
l'm ready enough to do what
l gotta do all by my damn self.

886
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:29,205
So you can take these
and go to the dance yourself.

887
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:33,469
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

888
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,168
Look, ma'am, we talked about this.
l don't see what the problem is.

889
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,904
Do you know what the APl is,
Mr. Carter?

890
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:39,446
No, l don't.

891
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,311
The Academic Performance lndex.

892
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:44,544
They judge schools on a scale
of one to ten, ten being the best.

893
00:55:44,755 --> 00:55:47,189
Do you have any idea
where Richmond falls on that scale?

894
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:48,653
No, ma'am, l have no idea.

895
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:51,589
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have
been for the last seven years.

896
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:53,763
The state rewards schools
for their performance.

897
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:56,330
So every year l have less money
to pay faculty and staff.

898
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:59,501
- Look, ma'am--
- Can l ask what it is you want?

899
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:01,603
- l want my boys to go to college.
- College?

900
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:04,500
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates
50 percent of its students,

901
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,005
the higher percentage being girls.

902
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:09,076
Now, in my very educated opinion,
you have 1 5 players on your team,

903
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:11,008
you'll be lucky to graduate
five of them.

904
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:13,011
l'm sorry, ma'am,
but l don't agree with you.

905
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:16,014
Look, these boys signed contracts.
Maybe if you'd read one of them--

906
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:18,687
Your job is to win basketball games,
Mr. Carter.

907
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:23,519
- l suggest you start doing your job.
- And your job is to educate these kids.

908
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:27,322
l suggest you start doing yours.

909
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:42,071
Well...

910
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:44,637
...we had another good week.

911
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:48,181
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

912
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:51,251
But l'm on my own.
You're never here.

913
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,151
- lt gets crazy.
- Look, l appreciate everything you do.

914
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:56,450
And l promise you-- We're closed.

915
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,220
--as soon as the season is over,
l will be here for you.

916
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:00,794
Mr. Carter?

917
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:02,588
- l'm--
- Junior Battle's mother.

918
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,357
Yes, ma'am, l remember you.

919
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:07,229
Willa. Willa Battle.

920
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:09,832
How may l help you, ma'am?

921
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,439
Mr. Carter, l got a phone call today

922
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:14,337
from a coach at a junior college
in Sacramento.

923
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:16,569
Now, they wanna see
Junior play this Friday.

924
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,112
Well, that's great, ma'am,
but Junior broke some rules--

925
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:20,840
And l agree with them.

926
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:23,611
l'm not here to argue
with your rules.

927
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,412
l'm not.

928
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:30,692
Almost two years ago now,

929
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:35,191
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

930
00:57:35,899 --> 00:57:41,235
...killed, and it's been confusing
and hard for me and for Junior.

931
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:44,603
After you lose a son...

932
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:50,736
...every time the phone rings,
your heart stops.

933
00:57:52,716 --> 00:57:55,241
Now, l'm not asking
for special attention.

934
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:59,047
l agree he needs to get straight
with his classes.

935
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:03,218
But the idea of junior college
had never even occurred to my son.

936
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:07,294
Now, l could move to the Hercules
school district, and he could play there.

937
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:12,230
- But moving is not gonna solve--
- But l want him to play for you.

938
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:15,269
Look, l'm not gonna stand here

939
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:18,999
and say l know how it feels
to lose a son, because l don't.

940
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:24,075
And l do appreciate you
putting your trust in me.

941
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:27,080
But l need to hear that from Junior.

942
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,213
He in the car.

943
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:35,722
Junior!

944
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:48,093
Go on.

945
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,808
l'm sorry for what l said and did
at practice,

946
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:59,106
and l promise to get caught up
with my classes, sir.

947
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:06,553
Look me in the eye, sir.

948
00:59:11,394 --> 00:59:14,192
Everything inside me tells me
if l take you back,

949
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:16,956
l'd be making a mistake
and you'll make a fool of me.

950
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,100
No, sir.

951
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:23,603
You owe me 1 ,000 push-ups

952
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:26,469
and 1 ,000 suicides
before you can play.

953
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:29,311
l'll see you at practice tomorrow.

954
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:33,379
Thank you, sir.

955
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:44,222
And you gonna do
every last one of them.

956
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:46,486
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

957
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:48,095
l don't know who you think you are.

958
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:51,698
The next time you make a decision,
you better ask me first.

959
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:54,368
Yo, Junior,
you did your thing tonight, man.

960
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:57,199
- Good looking out, yo.
- Yeah, good shot, Junior.

961
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:00,001
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Gentlemen, listen up.

962
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:04,675
l just received a call from the director
of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

963
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,213
You have been invited.

964
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,908
- Yeah!
- Yeah, baby!

965
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:15,787
Now, l have more good news.

966
01:00:15,992 --> 01:00:18,085
l spoke to Principal Garrison today.

967
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:22,163
She informs me that your teachers will
have your academic-progress reports

968
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,299
prepared by the end
of holiday break.

969
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:25,968
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

970
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:28,065
Yo, not only are our grades
all right, coach,

971
01:00:28,271 --> 01:00:30,933
- but we undefeated, homeboy.
- Yeah!

972
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:35,368
We undefeated
We undefeated

973
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:39,810
We undefeated
We undefeated

974
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:43,816
We undefeated
We undefeated

975
01:00:45,622 --> 01:00:49,114
Big ups to everybody who came out to
the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

976
01:00:49,326 --> 01:00:50,884
Get down!

977
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:16,249
So give it up for the new
kings of Richmond, y'all!

978
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:18,318
Yeah! Give it up, baby!

979
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:20,455
Yo, we 1 2-0, y'all,
and l just wanna say

980
01:01:20,657 --> 01:01:23,319
l wanna see all the beautiful people
up at that tournament.

981
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:25,050
You know!

982
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:28,025
Y'all gonna wanna see the look on
the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

983
01:01:28,264 --> 01:01:29,959
when the Richmond Oilers
roll into town.

984
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,395
Holla!

985
01:02:52,816 --> 01:02:55,148
Kyra, what are you thinking?
You can't drink!

986
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:57,148
- You're pregnant, girl.
- Stop.

987
01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:58,581
lt's soda, all right?

988
01:02:58,788 --> 01:03:00,517
So why don't you just go
back downstairs

989
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:02,588
and find one of your little girlies
to freak with.

990
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:05,022
lt ain't even like that.
Some girl just danced up on me.

991
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:06,889
- That ain't shit.
- Whatever.

992
01:03:07,097 --> 01:03:08,997
You shouldn't be here.
lf you're serious about this,

993
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:10,995
you need to check this bullshit.
Because if not--

994
01:03:11,234 --> 01:03:14,465
lf not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold
my hand through an abortion?

995
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:16,639
- ls that what you want?
- l don't know what l want.

996
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,330
You so damn sure you wanna
have this baby,

997
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:20,065
why don't you tell me how
it's gonna be.

998
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:21,971
Everything's great, right?

999
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:24,806
Your cousin is 1 9 with two kids
already, Kyra.

1000
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:26,379
lt's great?

1001
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,448
lt was great when we
was getting down.

1002
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:30,346
You ain't having no second
thoughts about that.

1003
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:32,851
You loved me
when it came to that.

1004
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:36,985
Look, Kyra, l can't tell you
what to do,

1005
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:40,191
but l look around and l see exactly
how l don't wanna live.

1006
01:03:40,396 --> 01:03:41,693
Paycheck to paycheck?

1007
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:43,398
Dead-end job?

1008
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:45,965
You make it seem like everything's
gonna be all good,

1009
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:48,433
like everything's so wonderful.

1010
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:51,703
You don't care about me.

1011
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:56,073
You just wanna go to college,
play ball and forget about me.

1012
01:03:56,412 --> 01:03:58,812
- Kyra, that's not even how it is.
- l don't care what you say.

1013
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:01,848
- l'm having this baby.
- And then what?

1014
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:03,518
You got everything figured out, right?

1015
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,618
So tell me what comes next.

1016
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:36,016
The third and final day of
the 22nd Bayhill Tournament

1017
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:38,278
finds the host team, Bayhill,

1018
01:04:38,488 --> 01:04:42,652
trying to win the championship against
the surprising Richmond Oilers.

1019
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:44,258
Defense! Defense!

1020
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,859
Get your hands up!

1021
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:53,062
Get that ball!

1022
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:06,848
Richmond uses their last timeout with
1:20 remaining in the fourth quarter

1023
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,382
- and Bayhill up by six.
- Time out!

1024
01:05:12,288 --> 01:05:14,813
Come on, man.
We still in the game. Come on.

1025
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:27,136
Don't panic.

1026
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,838
We're six down with 1 :20 left, right?

1027
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,870
We've been in these guys' ass
the whole game.

1028
01:05:32,075 --> 01:05:33,269
We can do this.

1029
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:35,876
- This is our time, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1030
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:39,140
All right, set up the 1 -4.
Run Candy.

1031
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:40,941
Damien's gonna hit the three.

1032
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:43,744
Kenyon, Lyle,
set a hard screen down here.

1033
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,580
When he hits the three,
go right into Diane.

1034
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:48,051
Pressure the inbound pass.

1035
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:49,885
Suffocate that pass.

1036
01:05:50,093 --> 01:05:51,720
l want the ball back!

1037
01:05:51,928 --> 01:05:53,759
- Come on, baby, lock up.
- Hands in.

1038
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:55,988
- Let's go.
- ''Our time'' on three!

1039
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:58,257
- One, two, three!
- Our time!

1040
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,866
Come on, let's go.

1041
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:09,475
One, two, three, Cougars!

1042
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:11,306
Let's go, guys!

1043
01:06:17,587 --> 01:06:20,147
1 -4! 1 -4! Candy!

1044
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:23,951
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Ball, ball, ball, ball!

1045
01:06:24,694 --> 01:06:26,252
Watch him!

1046
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:31,689
- Watch your back! Come in!
- Watch the screen!

1047
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:33,901
Make the shot, Damien!

1048
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:39,838
Diane! Diane!

1049
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:41,340
Defense!

1050
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,639
Go, go, go. Ball, ball, ball.

1051
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,609
Right there, right there. l got him.

1052
01:06:51,621 --> 01:06:53,555
- Off him, man. Off him.
- Richmond's ball!

1053
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:55,485
Richmond's ball!

1054
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:56,949
Yeah!

1055
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:03,730
Kenyon! Kenyon!
Hattie Jean! Hattie Jean!

1056
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:06,161
Hattie Jean, Hattie Jean,
Hattie Jean!

1057
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:08,461
- D up!
- Check! Check!

1058
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:13,805
- Get there!
- Right there!

1059
01:07:20,183 --> 01:07:21,445
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1060
01:07:22,185 --> 01:07:24,813
Move your feet!
Move your feet!

1061
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:36,794
A foul, ref!

1062
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:43,238
Right wing, Kenyon, wing!

1063
01:07:49,746 --> 01:07:52,374
Richmond takes the lead
for the first time in the game,

1064
01:07:52,582 --> 01:07:55,346
7 8 to 7 6.

1065
01:08:01,023 --> 01:08:04,186
Slow the ball down!
Slow the ball down!

1066
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:08,587
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!

1067
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:13,861
Defense! Defense!

1068
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:24,076
- That's a charge! Driving!
- Basket's good!

1069
01:08:24,814 --> 01:08:29,217
The basket counts,
and the Cougars have tied the game.

1070
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:33,054
That was a bad call, ref!

1071
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,523
- Basket counts! One shot!
- That's a charge!

1072
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:42,960
- Foul's on red five. On the block.
- Don't tie me like that!

1073
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,926
Coach! Please get back in the box.

1074
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:48,194
Please get in the box?
Please get your head in the game!

1075
01:08:48,438 --> 01:08:49,666
Give me a break!

1076
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:52,102
Cruz. ln for Lyle.

1077
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:55,475

1078
01:08:56,012 --> 01:08:57,536
Let's go.

1079
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:01,077
Listen, we got nine seconds left.
Get the ball, push it hard.

1080
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:03,809
The ball's coming to you, Kenyon.
Run Linda. Run Linda.

1081

You be open, all right?
Let's go. You can do this.

Let's go! Let's go!

01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:17,127
One shot.

1086
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:19,760
Backboard D!
Backboard D!

1087
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:35,407
And the Bayhill Cougars take the lead
with nine seconds left.

1088
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:39,019
Go to war, Miss Margaret,

1089
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:40,917
Let's go, let's go!

01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,423

1099
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:45,150

01:10:45,354 --> 01:10:48,118
Rich what? Richmond!

1101
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:50,588

Line up! Line up!
Let's shake hands.

1103
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:56,056
That's what l'm talking
about, coach.

1104
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:59,434
- Way to go, Lyle. Good game, son.

1105
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,034
Ladies and gentlemen,

1108
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:29,895
Hey, number three.

1109
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:38,096

1110
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,703
Okay, cool.

1111
01:11:56,959 --> 01:11:59,257
- All right, come on.
- All right.

1112
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:01,225
Watch his door.

1113
01:12:06,135 --> 01:12:08,695
Yo, yo. Come on, man, let's go.

1114
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:28,381
Load up, load up.

1115
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:47,297
Tonya, guess what.

1116
01:12:47,543 --> 01:12:49,636
We won the whole thing.

1117
01:12:51,113 --> 01:12:53,138
That's right, 1 6-0.

1118
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:55,043
Oh, and here's the best part:

1119
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:57,617
Your second-favorite man was MVP.

1120
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,048
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1121
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:00,916
l shouldn't tell you that.
He should tell you.

1122
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:03,921
l'll wake him up so he can tell you.
Hold on.

1123
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:07,926
Why don't you try their doorbell
with your ghetto self. Move.

1124
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:09,893
Can you reach that?

1125
01:13:17,006 --> 01:13:19,236
- Look at this place.
- Glad you guys could come.

1126
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:21,943
Oh, you know, we try to be
up in here, baby.

1127
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,970
Yo, what's up? This is a nice crib.

1128
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:41,889
Know what? He must be
in somebody else's room.

1129
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:57,369
Like l was saying, you know,
l'm Junior Battle. l'm the man.

1130
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:00,306
- That's what l'm talking about.
- l know.

1131
01:14:00,516 --> 01:14:03,485
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?
- Maybe.

1132
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:17,899
Yo!

1133
01:14:19,034 --> 01:14:20,433
You looking for your team?

1134
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,334
Yes, sir.

1135
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:26,699
Oh, baby. Hard biz.
Know what l'm saying?

1136
01:14:26,942 --> 01:14:30,275
This is my style right here.

1137
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:32,208
Hey, yo, Lyle.
Let me get a coochie juice.

1138
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:34,780

1139
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:36,576
- Yo, Worm!

1140
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:38,413

1141
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,111
l'm open!

1142
01:14:40,556 --> 01:14:42,183
Damien!

1143
01:14:44,627 --> 01:14:49,360
- Damien, are you drunk?
- No. l don't drink.

1144
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:51,430
- Sorry about the thing.
- lt's okay.

1145
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:54,102

1146
01:14:54,303 --> 01:14:57,932

- Why don't we go swimming.

1147
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,005
- We're going swimming?
- Yeah.

1148
01:15:00,242 --> 01:15:01,675
Hey, l'm going swimming!

1149
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:04,835
l'm going swimming!

1150
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:08,549
You're going swimming
with the MVP!

1151
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:10,979
MVP!

1152
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:26,293
This water's probably
cold as hell, shorty. l don't know.

1153
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,834
And swimming ain't my cup of tea,
baby. Know what l'm saying?

1154
01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:31,939
Heated. Probably 90 degrees.

1155
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:34,803
- We don't have bathing suits.
- Right.

1156
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:37,012
Neither do we.

1157
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:41,213
Oh, so it's like that?

1158
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:43,112
Show me the money, then,
know what l'm saying?

1159
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:46,049
- Damn!
- Since it's like that.

1160
01:15:51,827 --> 01:15:55,627
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.

1161
01:15:56,098 --> 01:16:00,000
- Damn!
- You are looking right.

1162
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:02,102
l like that.

1163
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:04,033
You guys coming?

1164
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,538
We're getting in there.

1165
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:10,135
l gotta take my chain off
so it don't turn green.

1166
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:14,078
Oh, man, l can't believe this.

1167
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:16,782
Heaven!

1168
01:16:37,873 --> 01:16:39,534
Excuse me.

1169
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:44,175
- Can l help you?
- l'm Ken Carter,

1170
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,177
coach of the Richmond High
basketball team.

1171
01:16:46,615 --> 01:16:48,105
Richmond?

1172
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:51,445
- You're a little lost, aren't you?
- Well, l'm looking for my son.

1173
01:16:51,654 --> 01:16:55,385
The cab driver told me he dropped
the team off here for a party.

1174
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:57,115
Excuse me.

1175
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:40,892
Oh, my God, is that--?

1176
01:17:41,103 --> 01:17:42,661
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.

1177
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,862
You see your son?

1178
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:47,402
Yes, sir, l do.

1179
01:17:53,148 --> 01:17:54,945
Damien Carter.

1180
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:58,011
Get your ass out of that pool.

1181
01:17:58,721 --> 01:18:00,188
Yes, sir.

1182
01:18:00,322 --> 01:18:02,847
Richmond High players, let's go!

1183
01:18:03,759 --> 01:18:06,284
- Coach!
- Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1184
01:18:06,495 --> 01:18:08,053
Worm?

1185
01:18:09,431 --> 01:18:11,023
What up, coach?

1186
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:13,258
l got somebody l want
you to meet.

1187
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:17,164
Now, l just met her,
but she is fine as hell.

1188
01:18:17,373 --> 01:18:20,171
- Her name is...
- Susan!

1189
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,604
- Susan. He right!
- Oh, shit.

1190
01:18:22,845 --> 01:18:25,643
My daughter, Susan.

1191
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:30,584
You are not going to like
what happens in practice on Monday.

1192
01:18:30,786 --> 01:18:33,016
You think you've run for me before?

1193
01:18:33,222 --> 01:18:37,750
l come to your rooms to celebrate
with you, and you sneak--

1194
01:18:40,729 --> 01:18:43,823
l end up taking a road trip
to the suburbs,

1195
01:18:44,033 --> 01:18:46,593
where l find my
drunk-ass point guard

1196
01:18:46,802 --> 01:18:49,100
on top of Daddy's little princess!

1197
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:53,163
Actually, l was on the bottom, coach.
She was on the top.

1198
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:55,877
Worm, do you wanna be
on this team?

1199
01:18:56,078 --> 01:18:58,672
Because you're about six words
from getting kicked off

1200
01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:01,747
and kicked off the goddamn bus!

1201
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:04,214
Cruz, open your eyes!

1202
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:06,616
Ghetto hoop stars!

1203
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:10,550
Signing autographs
and humping the honeys!

1204
01:19:11,026 --> 01:19:13,859
Well, l'm gonna show you
what humping is.

1205
01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:17,992
Coach, we won the tournament.

1206
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,531
We undefeated.

1207
01:19:19,735 --> 01:19:21,828
l mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1208
01:19:22,037 --> 01:19:23,368
Winners?

1209
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:39,272
Oh, no.

1210
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:42,482
Oh, no, no, no.

1211
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:45,244
Oh, no!

1212
01:20:49,491 --> 01:20:51,118
God--!

1213
01:21:02,271 --> 01:21:04,603
You guys are awesome!

1214
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,578
What's up, Cruz?

1215
01:21:19,788 --> 01:21:20,982
l don't know.

1216
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:23,818
Coach giving us a day off, l guess.

1217
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:28,553
Yo, l don't even know where
the library's even at.

1218
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:30,857
- l bet you don't.
- ''Library's at''?

1219
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:33,296
He don't know
where the library's at.

1220
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,942
Quiet.

1221
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:53,045
Quiet!

1222
01:21:54,089 --> 01:21:57,581
Gentlemen, in this hand,
l hold contracts

1223
01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:00,192
signed by me and signed by you.

1224
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:04,993
ln this hand, l hold academic-progress
reports prepared by your teachers.

1225
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:08,195
We have six players failing
at least one class,

1226
01:22:08,403 --> 01:22:12,499
eight players getting incompletes
based on attendance.

1227
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:15,904
Gentlemen, you have failed to up--

1228
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:18,136
No, l'm sorry.

1229
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,839
We have failed.

1230
01:22:21,216 --> 01:22:23,150
We have failed each other.

1231
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:26,243
Now, there are some of you
who have upheld this contract.

1232
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:29,856
But know that we are a team.

1233
01:22:30,058 --> 01:22:32,959
And until we all meet the terms
of this contract,

1234
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:34,890
the gym will remain locked.

1235
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:36,291
- Locked?
- What?

1236
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:38,693
- What you mean, locked?
- What, like for the day?

1237
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,800
- He must mean for the day.
- Mr. Thompson,

1238
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:44,234
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have
generously volunteered their time

1239
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:45,929
to help us reach our goals.

1240
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:47,766
But, coach, l have a 3.3.

1241
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,375
That's good, sir.

1242
01:22:49,578 --> 01:22:51,603
Do you score all the points
for the team too?

1243
01:22:54,883 --> 01:22:57,647
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1244
01:22:58,453 --> 01:23:01,081
Do you know what Oilers
stands for?

1245
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:06,358
Sir?

1246
01:23:07,162 --> 01:23:09,960
Know that you're not just
walking out on me.

1247
01:23:10,165 --> 01:23:12,190
You're walking out on them.

1248
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:14,901
l had to beg you.

1249
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:19,299
And then l ran all those sprints.

1250
01:23:20,108 --> 01:23:21,575
l did all that shit.

1251
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:25,906
l killed myself for you, sir,
to get back on the team.

1252
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:31,181
This is bullshit.

1253
01:23:54,109 --> 01:23:57,078
You put a lock on the gym and forced
them to meet you in the library?

1254
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,802
- Are you crazy?
- Miss Garrison.

1255
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:01,038
l'm surprised you know
where my office is.

1256
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:02,807
Take the lock off that gym.

1257
01:24:03,051 --> 01:24:04,518
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1258
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,312
Maybe someone on the other end
of that phone

1259
01:24:06,521 --> 01:24:08,216
has a solution to our problem.

1260
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:11,517
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter,
but your methods are a bit extreme.

1261
01:24:11,727 --> 01:24:13,661
You painted an extreme picture.

1262
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:16,695
No one expects them to graduate,
no one expects them to go to college.

1263
01:24:17,132 --> 01:24:19,657
So you take away basketball,
the one area of their lives

1264
01:24:19,868 --> 01:24:21,768
- where they have some success?
- Yes, ma'am.

1265
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,597
And you challenge them
academically?

1266
01:24:23,805 --> 01:24:25,534
- Yes, ma'am.
- And what if they fail?

1267
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:27,834
Then we've failed.

1268
01:24:29,678 --> 01:24:31,669
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter,
both you and l know

1269
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:34,143
that for some of these kids,
this basketball season

1270
01:24:34,349 --> 01:24:36,943
will be the highlight of their lives.

1271
01:24:37,919 --> 01:24:41,514
Well, l think that's the problem.
Don't you?

1272
01:25:06,848 --> 01:25:08,816
- Good morning, Coach Carter.
- Good morning.

1273
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:10,780
Quite the Pandora's box
you've opened.

1274
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:12,419
Oh, l get all the blame now?

1275
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:15,488
Let's just say l'm happy to give you
all the credit.

1276
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:18,921
l've got every news reporter in town
waiting to speak to you.

1277
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:21,823
Got a press conference set up
around the front of the gymnasium.

1278
01:25:22,264 --> 01:25:24,289
Coach Carter has taken the lockout
to the next level

1279
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,228
by canceling last night's game.

1280
01:25:26,435 --> 01:25:29,996
Richmond forfeited the game,
making it their first loss of the season.

1281
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:32,002
And for now,
the lock remains on the gym.

1282
01:25:32,207 --> 01:25:33,970
Here he comes.
Here he comes now.

1283
01:25:34,209 --> 01:25:38,339
Coach Carter! Coach!
Can l get a question?

1284
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,972
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
l'd like to thank you for your patience.

1285
01:25:42,217 --> 01:25:44,981
At this time, l'd like to introduce
Coach Ken Carter.

1286
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,451
You may direct
your questions to him.

1287
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:52,252
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players
whose grades qualify them to play?

1288
01:25:52,461 --> 01:25:54,156
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1289
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:56,694
We support each other
on and off the court.

1290
01:25:56,898 --> 01:25:59,230
Anybody still think coach
bluffing now?

1291
01:25:59,434 --> 01:26:02,028
l feel like running right up
in the middle of all those reporters

1292
01:26:02,237 --> 01:26:04,671
and telling them l think this
is bullshit, son.

1293
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:07,239
Maybe you should've gone
to class, Lyle.

1294
01:26:07,476 --> 01:26:10,206
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog.
My grades are fine, homeboy.

1295
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:13,414
- lt's Junior they should've locked out.
- Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.

1296
01:26:13,615 --> 01:26:16,948
- Why don't you try spelling it, then.
- Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.

1297
01:26:17,152 --> 01:26:19,882
- Junior, if you need help, l'll tutor you.
- Man, l don't need no help.

1298
01:26:20,088 --> 01:26:21,749
Well, he ain't lock us out
for no reason.

1299
01:26:23,091 --> 01:26:25,389
We been tripping lately, man.
All y'all know it.

1300
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:27,960
How do you think the community's
gonna react to this lockout?

1301
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:31,257
l'm not really sure. l hope
they'll support these young men.

1302
01:26:31,466 --> 01:26:33,457
What, man?

1303
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:35,898
No, man, it's just funny, dog,
because, Junior, man,

1304
01:26:36,104 --> 01:26:39,301
you thought it was bad all us knew
your dumb ass was failing science.

1305
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:42,009
Now the whole world about to know
your dumb ass failing science.

1306
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:44,940
- Man.
- Hey, man.

1307
01:26:46,848 --> 01:26:49,817
And you have Fremont this Saturday,
the biggest game on your schedule.

1308
01:26:50,051 --> 01:26:53,885
Now, Richmond is gonna riot
if you forfeit that game.

1309
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:55,647
Saturday is a long way off.

1310
01:26:55,857 --> 01:26:57,791
We'll see what happens.
Thank you all for coming.

1311
01:26:57,993 --> 01:27:00,461
That's all the time l have right now.
l have to get back to work.

1312
01:27:00,662 --> 01:27:03,563
Coach, have you talked to any
of the parents?

1313
01:27:04,533 --> 01:27:06,228
Thank you for your time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1314
01:27:06,434 --> 01:27:09,096
l'd like to remind you that classes
are in session,

1315
01:27:09,304 --> 01:27:11,670
so as you leave campus,
please do so quietly.

1316
01:27:13,308 --> 01:27:14,502
l ain't turning the cheek.

1317
01:27:14,743 --> 01:27:17,143
He come up in my 'hood,
l'm serious, it's on.

1318
01:27:17,345 --> 01:27:19,575
- Young sirs.
- lt's always been like that.

1319
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:21,749
lt's been a long day.

1320
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,942
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1321
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:29,249
Let's take this time to say whatever it is
we want while the doors are closed.

1322
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:33,052
You have the floor.
This is about us.

1323
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:36,594
Man, this shit ain't about us.
This is all about Coach Carter.

1324
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:38,527
We're the basketball team.

1325
01:27:38,733 --> 01:27:42,191
All l see is you on TV,
getting famous, eating that shit up.

1326
01:27:42,404 --> 01:27:44,702
- ls that all you see?
- lt's all l see.

1327
01:27:44,906 --> 01:27:46,669
You ain't lying.

1328
01:27:47,242 --> 01:27:48,800
Well, let me tell you what l see.

1329
01:27:49,778 --> 01:27:54,511
l see a system that's designed
for you to fail.

1330
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:57,544
Now, l know you all like stats,
so let me give you some.

1331
01:27:57,852 --> 01:28:01,549
Richmond High only graduates
50 percent of its students.

1332
01:28:01,756 --> 01:28:06,921
And of those that do graduate,
only 6 percent go to college.

1333
01:28:07,128 --> 01:28:12,088
Which tells me, when l walk down
the halls and l look in your classrooms,

1334
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,566
maybe only one student
is going to go to college.

1335
01:28:17,038 --> 01:28:20,633
''Well, damn, Coach Carter, if l ain't
going to college, where l'm gonna go?''

1336
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:22,968
Now, that's a great question.

1337
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:28,649
And the answer for young
African-American men in here is this:

1338
01:28:28,883 --> 01:28:30,783
probably to prison.

1339
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:35,122
ln this county,
33 percent of black males

1340
01:28:35,323 --> 01:28:39,760
between 1 8 and 24 get arrested.

1341
01:28:40,962 --> 01:28:42,691
So look at the guy on your left.

1342
01:28:43,598 --> 01:28:45,998
Now look at the guy on your right.

1343
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:49,533
One of you is going
to get arrested.

1344
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:51,900
Growing up here in Richmond,

1345
01:28:52,107 --> 01:28:56,737
you're 80 percent more likely
to go to prison than college.

1346
01:28:57,445 --> 01:28:59,913
Those are the numbers.

1347
01:29:00,715 --> 01:29:02,910
Those are some stats for your ass.

1348
01:29:03,685 --> 01:29:06,017
Now, l want you to go home...

1349
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:08,649
...and look at your lives tonight...

1350
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:11,690
...and look at your parents' lives...

1351
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:15,229
...and ask yourself, ''Do l want better?''

1352
01:29:15,964 --> 01:29:18,125
lf the answer is yes,

1353
01:29:18,366 --> 01:29:20,527
l'll see you here tomorrow.

1354
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:23,234
And l promise you...

1355
01:29:24,205 --> 01:29:27,504
...l will do everything in my power

1356
01:29:27,742 --> 01:29:29,437
to get you to college

1357
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:31,908
and to a better life.

1358
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,269
l don't understand this.
lt's a letter, how can it be a number?

1359
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:04,169
How are balancing
those equations coming?

1360
01:30:04,412 --> 01:30:07,381
- l can't do this.
- Hold on. Come on, son.

1361
01:30:07,582 --> 01:30:08,742
Don't give up yet, son.

1362
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:11,748
Here's a story out of California
that's getting national attention.

1363
01:30:11,953 --> 01:30:14,786
The entire boys' basketball team
at Richmond High School

1364
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:16,320
has been benched.

1365
01:30:16,524 --> 01:30:19,049
The highly ranked Oilers have
a perfect season on the court,

1366
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,660
but some players were
in big trouble academically.

1367
01:30:21,863 --> 01:30:25,765
And in an unprecedented move,
Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,

1368
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:29,403
locked the gym and sent his players
straight to the library.

1369
01:30:29,604 --> 01:30:30,764
Now, at the start of the season,

1370
01:30:30,972 --> 01:30:33,566
l understand you made all of
your players sign a contract

1371
01:30:33,808 --> 01:30:35,105
before they could join the team.

1372
01:30:35,343 --> 01:30:37,368
What exactly were the conditions
of that contract?

1373
01:30:37,612 --> 01:30:40,080
The contract states that
the players must maintain

1374
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:41,873
a 2.3 grade point average

1375
01:30:42,117 --> 01:30:44,483
and that the players must
attend all their classes

1376
01:30:44,686 --> 01:30:47,018
and sit in the front row
of those classes.

1377
01:30:47,222 --> 01:30:50,316
Well, Coach Carter, it's an
unusual strategy, and a risky one

1378
01:30:50,525 --> 01:30:52,390
in a sense, in light of
your team's winning record,

1379
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:55,722
but l think there's gonna be a lot of
people out there pleased to learn

1380
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:59,559
that at least somebody still cares
about the concept of a student athlete.

1381
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:01,463
Thanks a lot for joining us today.

1382
01:31:07,776 --> 01:31:08,936
l'm sorry to disturb you.

1383
01:31:09,177 --> 01:31:12,112
l'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond
High School basketball team.

1384
01:31:12,313 --> 01:31:13,439
Oh, yeah.

1385
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:15,308
l need to ask you a favor.

1386
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:18,680
My team is studying in the library,
and l've been trying to tell them

1387
01:31:18,887 --> 01:31:20,855
that brains and beauty
are a perfect combination.

1388
01:31:21,055 --> 01:31:22,022
Know what l'm saying?

1389
01:31:22,223 --> 01:31:23,952
l mean, l'm Worm, baby.

1390
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,059
How would you like
to watch the Worm work?

1391
01:31:26,261 --> 01:31:28,195
Hey, where did you get
that backpack?

1392
01:31:28,396 --> 01:31:29,488
Watch out, Too Short.

1393
01:31:29,697 --> 01:31:35,158
Why study earth science
or history or algebra?

1394
01:31:36,004 --> 01:31:40,771
Getting good grades in those subjects,
combined with basketball skills,

1395
01:31:41,009 --> 01:31:43,978
can get you into college.

1396
01:31:44,212 --> 01:31:47,113
Girl, you should've bought it.
l would've worn it.

1397
01:31:56,591 --> 01:31:59,560
You selfish son of a bitch.
You snake.

1398
01:31:59,761 --> 01:32:01,991
- Miss--
- No, no, don't ''miss'' me, snake.

1399
01:32:02,197 --> 01:32:03,664
Mr. Carter, you remember me?

1400
01:32:03,865 --> 01:32:06,663
Now, after all the things that my son
has been through for your team,

1401
01:32:06,868 --> 01:32:09,063
for you to go lock up
this gym like this, how dare you...

1402
01:32:25,787 --> 01:32:27,277
Open up the damn gym!

1403
01:32:27,488 --> 01:32:29,683
Let the boys play!

1404
01:32:34,662 --> 01:32:36,459
What's up, little cousin?

1405
01:32:36,664 --> 01:32:38,598
How you doing?

1406
01:32:38,967 --> 01:32:40,059
Got something for me?

1407
01:32:42,036 --> 01:32:43,526
That's what l'm talking about.

1408
01:32:54,015 --> 01:32:56,848
Hey, hey. Put it down, man.

1409
01:32:58,786 --> 01:33:00,310
- You Coach Carter, right?
- Yes, sir.

1410
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:02,921
- Yeah? Check this out, man.
- Hey, hold on, man.

1411
01:33:03,124 --> 01:33:04,921
- Yeah. How you like that?
- Oh, hell no.

1412
01:33:05,126 --> 01:33:07,321
- What? What?
- You wanna get out the car?

1413
01:33:07,528 --> 01:33:09,758
- Let's talk about this.
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

1414
01:33:09,964 --> 01:33:11,955
Just open up the gym, man.
Let them boys play.

1415
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:15,959
Trust me, you don't want me
out this car.

1416
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:17,728
Yeah, see? Yeah.

1417
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:19,804
- Get on!
- Don't be no punk.

1418
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,008
Say what you gotta say.

1419
01:33:21,209 --> 01:33:23,234
- Come on back, punk.
- Dad. Relax. Relax, let it go.

1420
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:24,638
No, l ain't letting nothing go.

1421
01:33:24,879 --> 01:33:28,406
These people in Richmond--
Goddamn it!

1422
01:33:28,783 --> 01:33:29,750
- Relax, Dad.
- Damn it!

1423
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:32,852
Relax, relax. Chill out.
lt's over. lt's over. All right?

1424
01:33:33,054 --> 01:33:35,284
He doesn't mean anything. lt's over.

1425
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:36,718
Let it go.

1426
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:39,257
Come on, get back in the car.
Let's go.

1427
01:34:57,572 --> 01:34:59,938
l think you know who she is,
but she's got a friend.

1428
01:35:00,174 --> 01:35:01,801
l mean, dog...
You gotta hook me up.

1429
01:35:02,043 --> 01:35:04,705
Why l always gotta hook him up?
Sound like l'm the Love Connection.

1430
01:35:04,946 --> 01:35:06,846
Just start a conversation.
l'll take care of it.

1431
01:35:07,048 --> 01:35:08,777
- Yeah.
- Yes, girl.

1432
01:35:09,217 --> 01:35:11,014
You don't remember me, do you?
But, see...

1433
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:13,119
l was just ready to duff Duke out.

1434
01:35:13,321 --> 01:35:15,789
- Some serious shit.
- You should have did it, man.

1435
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:18,618
You talking all that shit, just do it.
Know what l'm saying?

1436
01:35:18,826 --> 01:35:20,657
- You let somebody do that to you.
- l let him?

1437
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:22,227
- Yo, Oscar, man.
- What?

1438
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,761
Don't go nowhere. l'll be right out.

1439
01:35:23,965 --> 01:35:25,865
- l gotta talk to you.
- l already told you...

1440
01:35:26,067 --> 01:35:29,161
- No. You guys is kind of passing...
- l know l'm fine.

1441
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:31,964
But l'm not feeling myself,
l'm feeling you.

1442
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,839
Hey, l'm gonna holler at my boys
across the street for a quick minute.

1443
01:35:36,077 --> 01:35:37,271
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

1444
01:35:37,512 --> 01:35:38,979
- All right.
- You know who we are, then?

1445
01:35:39,213 --> 01:35:41,238
- Here they go.
- What do we have here?

1446
01:35:41,482 --> 01:35:43,712
- The Three Stooges from Richmond.
- Punk, punk, punk.

1447
01:35:43,918 --> 01:35:45,317
- Larry, Co and Dummy.
- Bitches.

1448
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,283
Dummy and dumb and dumber.
l mean, what the hell

1449
01:35:47,488 --> 01:35:50,889
is the bitchman from Richmond
doing on our side of the turf?

1450
01:35:51,192 --> 01:35:53,592
You garbage.
l can't believe y'all won.

1451
01:35:53,795 --> 01:35:54,989
- Shut up, woman.
- Don't be--

1452
01:35:55,196 --> 01:35:57,391
l don't understand how y'all won.

1453
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:01,130
- Y'all wack-star niggas.
- Y'all wacked.

1454
01:36:01,335 --> 01:36:02,700
Wacked.

1455
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:04,802
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.

1456
01:36:05,006 --> 01:36:07,839
- l don't wanna hear you talking shit.
- Homey, you a benchwarmer!

1457
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:11,439
Get the hell out my face, whitey!

1458
01:36:14,182 --> 01:36:16,275
Let's do it, homey.
Let's do it, homey.

1459
01:36:16,484 --> 01:36:18,179
- What you trying to do?

1460
01:36:18,853 --> 01:36:21,754
You feel me right now, huh?
You feel me right now?

1461
01:36:21,989 --> 01:36:24,719

1462
01:36:24,926 --> 01:36:27,224
Keep it up the block, homey.

1463
01:36:27,428 --> 01:36:29,589
l'm right here. Right here.

1464
01:36:29,797 --> 01:36:31,662
lt's all good. Y'all brought a gun!

1465
01:36:31,866 --> 01:36:33,265
Pinole!

1466
01:36:33,501 --> 01:36:35,332
Bitch-ass...

1467
01:36:35,536 --> 01:36:37,504
Pinole, right?

1468
01:36:37,939 --> 01:36:41,204
- Are they serious?
- l'll knock his braids out.

1469
01:36:41,809 --> 01:36:44,403
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.

1470
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:46,942
- Know what l'm saying?
- Appreciate the backup.

1471
01:36:47,148 --> 01:36:48,547
Word.

1472
01:36:49,884 --> 01:36:51,408
l'm gonna see y'all later, all right?

1473
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:53,052
- All right, homey.
- Good looking.

1474
01:36:53,254 --> 01:36:54,653
No doubt.

1475
01:36:55,323 --> 01:36:56,915
- l'm gonna check y'all.
- You got this.

1476
01:36:59,127 --> 01:37:01,254
This is my paper, man.
l'm not playing with you.

1477
01:37:01,462 --> 01:37:03,362
Then why don't you stop
getting in my face.

1478
01:37:07,468 --> 01:37:08,935
Renny!

1479
01:37:17,912 --> 01:37:19,903
Renny!

1480
01:37:27,388 --> 01:37:29,015
l can't believe--
He was just standing there.

1481
01:37:29,223 --> 01:37:30,952
- Renny!
- Oh, shit.

1482
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:33,627
- Come on. Help me. Call 91 1 .
- Call 91 1 , man.

1483
01:37:33,828 --> 01:37:35,489
Yo, l need a phone.

1484
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:38,460
l just need you
to stay with me, okay?

1485
01:37:42,103 --> 01:37:43,593
Hold his head up.

1486
01:37:49,577 --> 01:37:52,011
Somebody help me!

1487
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:17,394
- Cruz?
- l wanna come back, coach.

1488
01:38:17,605 --> 01:38:20,597
- What's going on?
- l wanna come back on the team.

1489
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:24,177
What the hell happened?

1490
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,609
They shot him.

1491
01:38:28,883 --> 01:38:30,976
Renny. They shot Renny.

1492
01:38:31,419 --> 01:38:33,148
l mean, we was just there.

1493
01:38:33,354 --> 01:38:35,652
We was just there.
Everything was good.

1494
01:38:35,856 --> 01:38:37,983
- Come inside. Come on.
- Everything was good, coach.

1495
01:38:38,192 --> 01:38:41,025
l mean, you know...

1496
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:42,560
Come inside, son.

1497
01:38:42,763 --> 01:38:45,357
- Come on.
- You don't understand.

1498
01:38:45,566 --> 01:38:48,899
l wanna come back on the team.
What do l gotta do to play?

1499
01:38:49,103 --> 01:38:51,037
Don't worry about that, son.
Just come inside.

1500
01:38:57,645 --> 01:38:59,545
Whatever you want me to do,

1501
01:38:59,947 --> 01:39:01,346
l'll do it, okay?

1502
01:39:01,549 --> 01:39:02,743
Okay. Okay.

1503
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:05,441
Okay. l got you.

1504
01:39:05,653 --> 01:39:07,553
Come on. Come on,
you're back with us now.

1505
01:39:07,755 --> 01:39:09,814
l can't believe they shot him.

1506
01:39:10,024 --> 01:39:11,719
Just come inside now, all right?

1507
01:39:11,926 --> 01:39:13,416
- Come on.
- l just wanna be on the team.

1508
01:39:13,628 --> 01:39:14,617
Come on. Come on.

1509
01:39:15,596 --> 01:39:17,496
Whatever you want me to do,

1510
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:20,223
l'll do it, okay?

1511
01:39:23,838 --> 01:39:26,272
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA

1512
01:39:26,507 --> 01:39:29,135
for participation
in extracurricular activities.

1513
01:39:29,377 --> 01:39:31,402
- Yes, ma'am.
- And according to your contract,

1514
01:39:31,646 --> 01:39:33,876
the players are agreeing
to maintain a 2.3?

1515
01:39:34,081 --> 01:39:36,015
That, among other things.
Yes, ma'am.

1516
01:39:36,217 --> 01:39:38,549
- Other things like...?
- Attending all classes,

1517
01:39:38,753 --> 01:39:40,277
sitting in the front row
of those classes,

1518
01:39:40,488 --> 01:39:42,183
and wearing a tie on game day.

1519
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:45,049
l see. Mr. Carter,

1520
01:39:45,259 --> 01:39:48,023
does the lockout include
practices and games?

1521
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:50,322
And do you have
a set period of time?

1522
01:39:50,531 --> 01:39:52,396
There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1523
01:39:54,835 --> 01:39:57,633
Please. Quiet, please.

1524
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:00,132
That includes practices and games,

1525
01:40:00,341 --> 01:40:02,605
until we as a team
reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1526
01:40:03,344 --> 01:40:04,936
Please, quiet.

1527
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:07,605
Please, quiet.

1528
01:40:07,848 --> 01:40:09,611
Quiet.

1529
01:40:10,151 --> 01:40:11,516
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1530
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:15,712
ln the interest of time, l'd like to open
this board meeting up for comments.

1531
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:18,414
As a teacher, l was offended
when asked by a coach

1532
01:40:18,626 --> 01:40:20,651
to provide progress reports.

1533
01:40:20,861 --> 01:40:24,262
Nowhere in my contract does it say
that l have to do so.

1534
01:40:24,465 --> 01:40:26,057
lt creates more work.

1535
01:40:26,267 --> 01:40:28,531
This lockout has brought
negative media attention

1536
01:40:28,736 --> 01:40:31,500
that questions our abilities
as educators.

1537
01:40:31,806 --> 01:40:35,572
End this madness. End this lockout.

1538
01:40:37,912 --> 01:40:39,641
l'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1539
01:40:39,847 --> 01:40:41,041
That boy lives to play ball.

1540
01:40:41,248 --> 01:40:43,239
Comes to school every day now.

1541
01:40:43,484 --> 01:40:45,850
You take away basketball,

1542
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,486
God knows what he'd be into.

1543
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:52,817
Yesterday, he canceled
the Fremont game.

1544
01:40:53,027 --> 01:40:55,359
Now, that's the biggest game
of the year.

1545
01:40:55,563 --> 01:40:57,497
l have scouts coming
to watch my boy play.

1546
01:40:57,698 --> 01:41:00,792
- Me too.
- These boys are 1 6-0.

1547
01:41:01,001 --> 01:41:04,164
This whole school, this whole
community, is behind this team.

1548
01:41:07,842 --> 01:41:10,037
Everybody goes to every game.

1549
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,677
Basketball is the only thing
that these boys have got.

1550
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,043
Are we gonna let Carter come in here
and take that away from them?

1551
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,844
- No!
- l don't think so.

1552
01:41:19,053 --> 01:41:20,247
Not gonna happen.

1553
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:30,359
- l'd like to make a motion.
- Yes, Mr. Walters?

1554
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:35,031
l move that we remove Mr. Carter
as head basketball coach.

1555
01:41:38,672 --> 01:41:41,334
Order, please. Order.

1556
01:41:41,575 --> 01:41:43,133
This board does not have
the authority

1557
01:41:43,377 --> 01:41:45,402
to terminate employment
of a staff position.

1558
01:41:45,646 --> 01:41:49,980
Then l move we end the lockout
and let the kids play.

1559
01:41:51,218 --> 01:41:52,810
l second the motion.

1560
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:54,385
- Okay.
- lf l may?

1561
01:41:54,588 --> 01:41:55,919
Yes, Mr. Carter.

1562
01:41:56,123 --> 01:41:58,148
You really need to consider
the message

1563
01:41:58,359 --> 01:41:59,986
that you're sending these boys.

1564
01:42:00,327 --> 01:42:04,388
lt's the same message that we
as a culture send to our pro athletes,

1565
01:42:04,598 --> 01:42:07,158
which is that they are above the law.

1566
01:42:07,601 --> 01:42:10,968
Now, l'm trying to teach these boys
the discipline that will inform their lives

1567
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:12,833
and give them choices.

1568
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:17,474
lf you endorse the fact
that 1 5-, 1 6- and 1 7-year-olds

1569
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:21,203
don't have to honor the simple rules
of a basketball contract,

1570
01:42:21,449 --> 01:42:24,543
how long do you think it'll be before
they're out there breaking laws?

1571
01:42:25,786 --> 01:42:28,755
Now, l played basketball
at Richmond 30 years ago.

1572
01:42:28,989 --> 01:42:31,287
lt was the same thing then.

1573
01:42:31,492 --> 01:42:33,858
Some of my teammates
ended up in prison.

1574
01:42:34,061 --> 01:42:36,325
Some of them ended up dead.

1575
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:39,465
l took this job because
l wanted to effect change

1576
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:41,134
in a special group of young men,

1577
01:42:41,335 --> 01:42:45,271
and this is the only way
l know how to do that.

1578
01:42:46,674 --> 01:42:48,733
lf you vote to end the lockout,

1579
01:42:48,976 --> 01:42:52,002
you won't have to terminate me.
l'll quit.

1580
01:42:52,246 --> 01:42:53,645
Good.

1581
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:01,484
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1582
01:43:03,591 --> 01:43:06,287
The board now recognizes
five voting members.

1583
01:43:06,494 --> 01:43:10,328
ln this instance, we will be accepting
the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1584
01:43:10,831 --> 01:43:14,494
Now, l put to those members
the vote on whether or not

1585
01:43:14,702 --> 01:43:16,499
to end the lockout.

1586
01:43:16,704 --> 01:43:18,797
All those in favor
of ending the lockout

1587
01:43:19,006 --> 01:43:22,100
will raise their right hand
when called upon.

1588
01:43:22,343 --> 01:43:26,677
l will vote first
by not raising my hand.

1589
01:43:27,348 --> 01:43:29,942
Principal Garrison?

1590
01:43:33,754 --> 01:43:36,348
Valerie Walker.

1591
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:39,352
Benson Chiu.

1592
01:43:41,729 --> 01:43:43,492
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1593
01:43:45,733 --> 01:43:47,701
And Ms. Nyugen.

1594
01:43:47,902 --> 01:43:50,200
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1595
01:44:05,519 --> 01:44:08,215
The lockout ends with a vote
of 4 to 2.

1596
01:44:08,422 --> 01:44:11,687
lf there's no other business,
this board meeting is adjourned.

1597
01:44:12,393 --> 01:44:13,860
Thank you all for coming.

1598
01:44:31,111 --> 01:44:33,170
Mr. Carter.

1599
01:44:33,414 --> 01:44:35,882
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1600
01:44:37,985 --> 01:44:40,249
Look, l know we haven't always seen
eye to eye,

1601
01:44:40,454 --> 01:44:43,218
but you've done such a great job with
these boys, it seems wrong to just--

1602
01:44:43,424 --> 01:44:47,292
Look. No offense, ma'am,
but all the work l did with those boys

1603
01:44:47,494 --> 01:44:49,189
was negated when they ended
the lockout.

1604
01:44:49,663 --> 01:44:51,062
l don't think that's true, l--

1605
01:44:51,265 --> 01:44:53,199
The board sent the message
loud and clear.

1606
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,163
Winning basketball games
is more important

1607
01:44:55,369 --> 01:44:57,894
than graduating from high school
and going to college.

1608
01:44:58,105 --> 01:45:01,768
l'm sorry, l just can't support
that message.

1609
01:45:49,423 --> 01:45:54,884
Sir, they can cut the chain off the
door, but they can't make us play.

1610
01:45:57,097 --> 01:46:01,056
We've decided we're gonna finish
what you started, sir.

1611
01:46:01,969 --> 01:46:03,766
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.

1612
01:46:04,104 --> 01:46:05,628
We got shit to do, sir.

1613
01:46:19,353 --> 01:46:21,787
Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

1614
01:46:21,989 --> 01:46:24,981
Our deepest fear is that
we are powerful beyond measure.

1615
01:46:25,926 --> 01:46:29,327
lt is our light, not our darkness
that most frightens us.

1616
01:46:29,663 --> 01:46:31,597
Your playing small
does not serve the world.

1617
01:46:31,799 --> 01:46:33,426
There is nothing enlightened
about shrinking

1618
01:46:33,634 --> 01:46:36,364
so that other people
won't feel insecure around you.

1619
01:46:37,337 --> 01:46:40,363
We were all meant to shine,
as children do.

1620
01:46:40,607 --> 01:46:43,576
lt's not just in some of us,
it's in everyone.

1621
01:46:44,011 --> 01:46:46,002
And as we let our own light shine,

1622
01:46:46,246 --> 01:46:49,044
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.

1623
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:52,519
As we are liberated
from our own fear,

1624
01:46:52,953 --> 01:46:55,581
our presence automatically
liberates others.

1625
01:47:01,929 --> 01:47:04,329
Sir, l just wanna say thank you.

1626
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:08,497
You saved my life.

1627
01:47:17,411 --> 01:47:19,811
Thank you, sirs.

1628
01:47:22,349 --> 01:47:24,579
All of you.

1629
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:10,352
Academic-progress reports,
young men.

1630
01:48:10,564 --> 01:48:13,362
These things are...

1631
01:48:13,801 --> 01:48:15,996
...unbelievable.

1632
01:48:16,503 --> 01:48:19,267
l know you've been trying.

1633
01:48:21,408 --> 01:48:24,866
l guess there's only one way
to say this.

1634
01:48:26,313 --> 01:48:28,543
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal.
Let's play ball.

1635
01:48:34,121 --> 01:48:36,351
Rich what? Richmond!

1636
01:48:36,557 --> 01:48:38,957
Rich what? Richmond!

1637
01:48:39,159 --> 01:48:41,150
Rich what? Richmond!

1638
01:49:08,255 --> 01:49:09,950
Hustle back. Get back, get back.

1639
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:13,490
Set it, Worm. Set it.

1640
01:49:14,027 --> 01:49:15,927
Watch baseline.

1641
01:49:16,129 --> 01:49:18,393
- Take it.
- Take it, come on.

1642
01:49:21,034 --> 01:49:23,468
- Yes!
- Find a man. Find a man.

1643
01:49:26,874 --> 01:49:28,774
Swing it, swing it.

1644
01:49:29,409 --> 01:49:31,400
Go, go, go.

1645
01:49:34,014 --> 01:49:36,005
Go, go.

1646
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:37,683
Come on!

1647
01:49:47,728 --> 01:49:48,990
Go Richmond!

1648
01:49:49,463 --> 01:49:51,363
Hold the ball, hold the ball!

1649
01:49:54,167 --> 01:49:57,694
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1650
01:49:57,905 --> 01:50:02,001
five, four, three, two, one,

1651
01:50:02,242 --> 01:50:03,504
see you!

1652
01:50:11,084 --> 01:50:13,279
- Great game, coach.
- Good game.

1653
01:50:17,257 --> 01:50:20,556
Richmond returns from their lockout
and keeps their streak alive

1654
01:50:20,761 --> 01:50:22,058
at 1 7 games.

1655
01:50:22,262 --> 01:50:26,528
A team that won only four games
last year is now a Cinderella team

1656
01:50:26,733 --> 01:50:28,928
that has to be thinking
that there's a chance

1657
01:50:29,136 --> 01:50:31,696
of getting the phone call
to come to the dance.

1658
01:50:31,905 --> 01:50:34,169
ls Richmond headed
for the state tournament?

1659
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:49,348
So, what else y'all gonna do
at the park when you go?

1660
01:50:49,556 --> 01:50:51,547
- Seesaw.
- Seesaw?

1661
01:50:51,758 --> 01:50:53,350
- You're gonna seesaw?
- Yeah.

1662
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:56,188
- Who's gonna push you?
- My mommy's gonna push me.

1663
01:50:56,396 --> 01:50:58,489
Yeah?

1664
01:50:58,699 --> 01:51:00,963
That's good.
l wish l could go with you.

1665
01:51:01,168 --> 01:51:04,069
- Come on, baby.
- But l'll see you later, okay?

1666
01:51:04,271 --> 01:51:06,398
- Bye.
- Bye.

1667
01:51:12,079 --> 01:51:13,239
How you been?

1668
01:51:15,382 --> 01:51:17,111
Good.

1669
01:51:17,718 --> 01:51:19,845
You look good.

1670
01:51:20,053 --> 01:51:23,022
Thank you. So do you.

1671
01:51:23,223 --> 01:51:25,248
Considering.

1672
01:51:29,730 --> 01:51:33,666
You know, everything's been crazy,
with the lockout.

1673
01:51:33,867 --> 01:51:35,334
Yeah, it'll be all right.

1674
01:51:36,336 --> 01:51:38,099
For sure.

1675
01:51:38,305 --> 01:51:40,205
Can we sit down somewhere?

1676
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:03,821
l've been trying to get my head
straight about things.

1677
01:52:04,031 --> 01:52:06,625
A lot of things. Especially us.

1678
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:09,495
- Kenny, l--
- Kyra, just listen.

1679
01:52:10,404 --> 01:52:12,463
Please.

1680
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:19,071
For a long time, it's just been
my moms, my boys and you.

1681
01:52:19,312 --> 01:52:20,836
And that's what l counted on.

1682
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:24,809
l'm trying to count on myself now,
and l'm all right and shit,

1683
01:52:25,018 --> 01:52:29,387
it's just, without you,
nothing good feels as good.

1684
01:52:29,823 --> 01:52:34,419
lt's like l'm missing
some happy part of me.

1685
01:52:45,806 --> 01:52:47,637
l got you something.

1686
01:52:49,643 --> 01:52:51,372
And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.

1687
01:52:53,513 --> 01:52:55,708
Shut up.

1688
01:52:59,486 --> 01:53:01,613
- They gave you a scholarship?
- Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1689
01:53:01,822 --> 01:53:06,521
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1690
01:53:06,726 --> 01:53:08,921
Oh, my gosh.

1691
01:53:09,129 --> 01:53:10,892
l know you gonna kill it up there.

1692
01:53:11,098 --> 01:53:13,566
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1693
01:53:13,767 --> 01:53:16,167
l told them about you and the baby.
They wanna help us.

1694
01:53:28,648 --> 01:53:30,240
Kenyon...

1695
01:53:31,184 --> 01:53:33,243
...there is no more baby.

1696
01:53:37,057 --> 01:53:40,254
l decided not to go through with it.

1697
01:53:41,261 --> 01:53:43,388
Kyra.

1698
01:53:44,064 --> 01:53:46,760
l had a choice to make,

1699
01:53:46,967 --> 01:53:49,401
so l made it.

1700
01:53:49,603 --> 01:53:52,037
For me, Kenny.

1701
01:53:54,541 --> 01:53:57,908
Well, when...?

1702
01:53:58,111 --> 01:54:01,547
Why didn't you tell me?
l would have gone with you.

1703
01:54:06,219 --> 01:54:08,084
l'm so sorry.

1704
01:54:09,289 --> 01:54:12,417
Kyra, l'm so sorry you had to
go through that by yourself.

1705
01:54:14,794 --> 01:54:17,592
My mom went with me.

1706
01:54:19,332 --> 01:54:20,959
But l think that...

1707
01:54:21,168 --> 01:54:26,868
l think you should go to school
and play ball and do your thing.

1708
01:54:27,073 --> 01:54:28,665
You know?

1709
01:54:28,909 --> 01:54:32,345
l want that for you. And that's real.

1710
01:54:33,213 --> 01:54:35,511
l think you should be all you can.

1711
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:39,981
l want you to come with me.

1712
01:54:42,789 --> 01:54:44,654
Kyra, l love you.

1713
01:54:45,258 --> 01:54:46,987
l want you to come with me.

1714
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:50,391
- You serious?
- l'm serious.

1715
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:53,462
- Oh, my God.
- l love you.

1716
01:54:53,667 --> 01:54:55,897
l love you too.

1717
01:55:03,843 --> 01:55:05,037
Ken Carter.

1718
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:09,444
l understand, sir.

1719
01:55:10,283 --> 01:55:12,308
All right. Thank you, sir.

1720
01:55:21,094 --> 01:55:22,618
We're in.

1721
01:55:24,364 --> 01:55:25,956
That's what l'm talking about.

1722
01:55:32,539 --> 01:55:35,474
Guys, guys, guys. Now, listen.

1723
01:55:35,709 --> 01:55:37,973
lt's not gonna be easy.
lt's gonna be a long road.

1724
01:55:38,712 --> 01:55:41,738
- We're a really low seed.
- Who did we get, coach?

1725
01:55:43,617 --> 01:55:45,209
St. Francis.

1726
01:55:45,418 --> 01:55:46,908
St. Francis?

1727
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:50,283
Coach, they ranked number one
in the state.

1728
01:55:51,558 --> 01:55:54,584
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don't worry
about Ty Crane, dog. You'll get him.

1729
01:55:55,028 --> 01:55:58,429
We got this. That's all right, baby.
One game at a time. We got this.

1730
01:55:58,632 --> 01:56:00,463
- All right, guys.
- lt's on.

1731
01:56:09,509 --> 01:56:12,637
- Bring your A game, young man.
- Yes, sir.

1732
01:56:44,144 --> 01:56:48,103
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the first round of the ClF playoffs.

1733
01:56:48,348 --> 01:56:51,784
St. Francis is one of the best
high school teams in the nation,

1734
01:56:51,985 --> 01:56:53,850
with Ty Crane
believed to be a shoo-in

1735
01:56:54,054 --> 01:56:56,750
for the top NBA draft pick next year.

1736
01:56:56,956 --> 01:56:59,447
On the other side of the court
is Richmond,

1737
01:56:59,659 --> 01:57:01,889
a team that's had
a media-worthy season as well.

1738
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:05,230
Richmond High has never played
in a state tournament.

1739
01:57:05,432 --> 01:57:08,765
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1740
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,899
- Settle down, settle down.
- 1 -4!

1741
01:57:19,446 --> 01:57:20,913
Ball, ball.

1742
01:57:21,147 --> 01:57:22,705
Move, move.

1743
01:57:27,387 --> 01:57:29,082
Good shot, baby.

1744
01:57:30,557 --> 01:57:33,117
- Get back, get back.
- Run motion. Run motion.

1745
01:57:33,326 --> 01:57:34,918
Motion 44.

1746
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:40,689
Right here, right here. Swing it.

1747
01:57:43,436 --> 01:57:45,199
Force him left. Force him left.

1748
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:54,468
You gotta force him left.
The baseline's another defender.

1749
01:57:57,183 --> 01:57:58,912
D up!

1750
01:58:03,857 --> 01:58:05,825
Better get somebody else to hold me.
l'm dropping 50.

1751
01:58:08,194 --> 01:58:09,525
Set up!

1752
01:58:13,833 --> 01:58:16,495
Come on. Get on him, get on him.

1753
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:19,761
Get over here and help.
He shouldn't be scoring.

1754
01:58:19,973 --> 01:58:21,634
Get back, get back. Bring it in.

1755
01:58:23,376 --> 01:58:25,571
Get back, get back.
Find your man, find your man.

1756
01:58:25,812 --> 01:58:27,803
Now, watch out. Watch that trap.

1757
01:58:28,047 --> 01:58:31,483
Watch the trap. Motion. Motion.
That's the one.

1758
01:58:33,186 --> 01:58:35,484
That's it. Yes! Yes!

1759
01:58:35,688 --> 01:58:39,249
S-C-O-R-E! Score! Score!

1760
01:58:41,928 --> 01:58:43,725
Ball, ball. Ball, man!

1761
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:53,334
Lyle, stop the ball.
Less talk out there.

1762
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:07,680
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, Richmond!

1763
01:59:07,887 --> 01:59:10,549
You gotta help Junior
on the weak-side pick.

1764
01:59:15,161 --> 01:59:19,393
- Delilah! Delilah!
- Defense! Defense!

1765
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:21,829
- Defense! Defense!
- Delilah! Delilah!

1766
01:59:22,035 --> 01:59:23,502
Delilah! Delilah!

1767
01:59:25,171 --> 01:59:27,765
- Get there, get there.
- Trap, trap, trap. Left side, left side.

1768
01:59:40,353 --> 01:59:43,481
- Use the pick, use the pick.
- l got it.

1769
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:49,322
- Yeah! That's what l'm talking about.
- Foul, number three.

1770
01:59:49,529 --> 01:59:50,587
- Hold up.
- Number three.

1771
01:59:50,797 --> 01:59:53,561
- Mustangs, bring it in. Bring it in.
- Count the basket.

1772
01:59:53,766 --> 01:59:56,098
- Damn.
- Timeout, sir. Time.

1773
01:59:56,302 --> 01:59:58,998
Come here, come here. Damn it.

1774
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:03,306
Come on, guys,
keep up the defense!

1775
02:00:03,543 --> 02:00:06,011
Come on, what you gonna do?

1776
02:00:06,446 --> 02:00:09,142
We still in this game.
Come on, fellas.

1777
02:00:09,949 --> 02:00:13,282
Gentlemen, you told me
you deserved to be here.

1778
02:00:13,486 --> 02:00:15,044
Well, you're not playing like it.

1779
02:00:15,255 --> 02:00:18,122
All season long,
we played our game.

1780
02:00:18,324 --> 02:00:20,724
Right now, you're playing theirs.

1781
02:00:20,927 --> 02:00:24,829
When we step on the floor,
every second that clock is ticking,

1782
02:00:25,031 --> 02:00:27,056
we are pedal to the metal.

1783
02:00:27,267 --> 02:00:29,792
We run the ball.
We pressure the ball.

1784
02:00:30,003 --> 02:00:35,305
And most importantly,
we control the tempo of the game!

1785
02:00:35,542 --> 02:00:40,138
We make them play
Richmond Oiler ball.

1786
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:42,348
Worm, you can take this kid.

1787
02:00:42,582 --> 02:00:44,072
Force him left,
and when he crosses over,

1788
02:00:44,317 --> 02:00:47,343
you jump him.
Damien, push the tempo.

1789
02:00:47,554 --> 02:00:49,886
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.

1790
02:00:50,089 --> 02:00:53,616
Cruz, when you're in the game in
transition, take that jumper you love.

1791
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:56,528
Junior, just keep doing
what you're doing.

1792
02:00:56,729 --> 02:00:58,594
Hold on to that monster.

1793
02:00:58,798 --> 02:01:02,097
You do those things, gentlemen,
and l guarantee you,

1794
02:01:02,302 --> 02:01:06,204
at the end of the game,
we will be there.

1795
02:01:08,708 --> 02:01:10,835
All right, hands in.

1796
02:01:11,077 --> 02:01:13,637
- Game time.
- All right, take control of this game.

1797
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:15,040
Who's gonna win this game?

1798
02:01:15,281 --> 02:01:18,808
One, two, three, Richmond!
Let's go. Let's do this.

1799
02:01:22,755 --> 02:01:25,246
One, two, three, Mustangs!

1800
02:01:32,966 --> 02:01:35,400
- Get up, get up.
- Go, go, go.

1801
02:01:43,476 --> 02:01:44,568
Yes.

1802
02:01:48,348 --> 02:01:50,714
- Reach-in foul.
- That's the only damn one.

1803
02:01:50,917 --> 02:01:54,409
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?
- Good call, ref.

1804
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:57,089
Cruz. ln for Kenyon.

1805
02:01:59,926 --> 02:02:03,327
- Ball, ball, ball, ball.
- Run it, run it, run it.

1806
02:02:17,343 --> 02:02:19,470
Get back, get back!
Everybody get back.

1807
02:02:20,046 --> 02:02:21,775
Yeah! Come on!

1808
02:02:41,934 --> 02:02:43,663
Get back, get back, get back.

1809
02:02:53,146 --> 02:02:54,704
Ref, you gotta call that.
This is my house.

1810
02:02:54,947 --> 02:02:56,972
- Push, push.
- Can we get a call?

1811
02:03:05,491 --> 02:03:08,255
Take care of the ball, man.
l'm gonna catch my breath.

1812
02:03:17,503 --> 02:03:18,765
Come on. Get back, get back.

1813
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:25,471
Swing it right here. l got it.

1814
02:03:29,916 --> 02:03:31,315
Charge.

1815
02:03:33,352 --> 02:03:35,684
- Go get them, boys.
- Yeah, baby.

1816
02:03:35,888 --> 02:03:38,789
Charge, number 30. Red ball.

1817
02:03:38,991 --> 02:03:41,221
Come on, ref,
you wasn't even there.

1818
02:03:46,733 --> 02:03:49,896
- Red ball, red ball. Red, red, red.
- Yes. Yes.

1819
02:03:50,103 --> 02:03:51,400
- Richmond's ball.
- What?

1820
02:03:51,604 --> 02:03:53,970
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1821
02:04:01,447 --> 02:04:02,914
- Red ball.
- Junior, good block!

1822
02:04:03,816 --> 02:04:06,284
- l know that's a foul.
- lt's all ball.

1823
02:04:06,486 --> 02:04:09,046
- What are you talking about?
- What's up, man?

1824
02:04:12,358 --> 02:04:14,326
Knock his bitch ass out.

1825
02:04:14,527 --> 02:04:16,461
Calm down, man.
We're still in the game.

1826
02:04:16,896 --> 02:04:18,022
Come on.

1827
02:04:18,765 --> 02:04:20,255
- Ease back.
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

1828
02:04:23,302 --> 02:04:25,429
Get out of my way, man. Get off me.

1829
02:04:26,839 --> 02:04:29,364
Let's go, let's go.

1830
02:04:29,609 --> 02:04:32,703
All right, baby, it's all us now.
lt's all us. Let's go.

1831
02:04:41,921 --> 02:04:44,890
They're standing on the edge of a cliff.
All we gotta do is push them off.

1832
02:04:45,358 --> 02:04:46,382
We're gonna run Candy.

1833
02:04:46,592 --> 02:04:48,583
Worm, you gotta sell them
the pass to Damien.

1834
02:04:48,795 --> 02:04:51,593
Junior, we come to you
on the weak-side seal.

1835
02:04:51,798 --> 02:04:53,925
But, gentlemen,
just because you deserve this

1836
02:04:54,133 --> 02:04:55,725
doesn't mean they're gonna
give it to you.

1837
02:04:55,935 --> 02:04:59,803
Sometimes you gotta take
what's yours. You ready to do this?

1838
02:05:00,006 --> 02:05:01,530
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

1839
02:05:01,774 --> 02:05:04,106
- All right, hands in.
- Come on, take this.

1840
02:05:04,343 --> 02:05:06,436
Richmond on three.
One, two, three, Richmond!

1841
02:05:13,886 --> 02:05:16,446
- Careful of the foul, all right? Let's go.
- l got you. 1 -4, 1 -4!

1842
02:05:17,557 --> 02:05:20,219
- All right.
- Defense! Mustangs!

1843
02:05:20,426 --> 02:05:22,257
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1844
02:05:25,097 --> 02:05:27,224
Candy! Candy!

1845
02:05:30,970 --> 02:05:32,961
Ball, Damien.

1846
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:40,440
- Move, move.
- Help, help.

1847
02:05:56,863 --> 02:05:58,922
Get back, get back, get back!

1848
02:06:03,336 --> 02:06:04,769
Junior, get back!

1849
02:06:15,681 --> 02:06:17,546
Hands up!

1850
02:06:31,664 --> 02:06:34,394
Yeah, that's what l'm
talking about, baby. Yeah!

1851
02:07:26,385 --> 02:07:29,513
Mustangs! Mustangs!

1852
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:34,226
Hold on, hold on. Let me down,
let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!

1853
02:07:36,929 --> 02:07:39,921
You're real, man.
l mean that. All right?

1854
02:07:40,733 --> 02:07:43,702
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

1855
02:07:56,449 --> 02:07:59,213
Well, not quite
your storybook ending, huh?

1856
02:07:59,418 --> 02:08:01,784
Not for us, anyway.

1857
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:07,184
But you men played like champions.

1858
02:08:07,393 --> 02:08:09,054
You never gave up.

1859
02:08:09,862 --> 02:08:13,958
And champions
hold their heads high.

1860
02:08:14,166 --> 02:08:17,602
What you achieved goes way beyond
the win-loss column

1861
02:08:17,803 --> 02:08:19,600
or what's gonna be written
on the front page

1862
02:08:19,805 --> 02:08:22,330
of the sports section tomorrow.

1863
02:08:22,575 --> 02:08:24,338
You've achieved something
that some people

1864
02:08:24,577 --> 02:08:28,138
spend their whole lives trying to find.

1865
02:08:28,381 --> 02:08:34,342
What you achieved
is that ever-elusive victory within.

1866
02:08:35,654 --> 02:08:37,383
And, gentlemen...

1867
02:08:38,257 --> 02:08:41,693
...l am so proud of you.

1868
02:08:44,964 --> 02:08:48,832
Four months ago, when l took
the job at Richmond, l had a plan.

1869
02:08:49,502 --> 02:08:51,970
That plan failed.

1870
02:08:52,171 --> 02:08:56,972
l came to coach basketball players,
and you became students.

1871
02:08:58,411 --> 02:09:00,743
l came to teach boys...

1872
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,339
...and you became men.

1873
02:09:03,916 --> 02:09:05,713
And for that, l thank you.

1874
02:09:09,622 --> 02:09:12,591
lf someone walked in this door
right now

1875
02:09:12,792 --> 02:09:18,389
and offered me the coaching job
at any school in the state of California,

1876
02:09:18,597 --> 02:09:21,361
you know which team l'd choose?

1877
02:09:21,567 --> 02:09:23,660
St. Francis?

1878
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:26,500
l'm just saying, man.

1879
02:09:27,473 --> 02:09:29,532
Kenyon?

1880
02:09:33,379 --> 02:09:35,711
- Richmond?
- Rich what?

1881
02:09:36,882 --> 02:09:38,850
- Richmond.
- Rich what?

1882
02:09:39,051 --> 02:09:40,211
Richmond.

1883
02:09:40,419 --> 02:09:43,013
- Rich what?
- Richmond.

1884
02:09:43,222 --> 02:09:45,383
- Where we from?
- Richmond!

1885
02:09:45,591 --> 02:09:48,025
- What's my hometown?
- Richmond!

1886
02:09:48,227 --> 02:09:50,252
- What do we love?
- Richmond!

1887
02:09:50,463 --> 02:09:52,727
- Rich what?
- Richmond!
