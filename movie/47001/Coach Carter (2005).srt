1
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,950
Yeah! Nice job! Nice pass!

2
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>St. Francis High School
basketball phenom</i>

3
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,791
Ty Crane,
who they recruited just last year,

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,168
is widely held as
the next LeBron James.

5
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,629
We simply know him
as "The Crane."

6
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,299
Come on.

7
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,901
Come on, y'all!
Timo, let's go man, come on.

8
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,319
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,830
Where you at? Where you at?

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,499
Pick him up! Pick him up!

11
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,132
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

12
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,550
Right here, right here.

13
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,347
- Blue ball!
- Good D, baby!

14
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,182
- Damn!
- What the hell are you doing, y'all?

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,393
- You took three steps this way.
- Yo, I put my fist up, man.

16
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,938
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing
the ball, man. Damn.

17
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,440
- Get your man!
- I knew it. I knew it.

18
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,695
Yeah!

19
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,697
St. Francis is up by 22.

20
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,459
Stay out of my way, bitch.
I own you.

21
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,586
- Oh, hell no!
- Bitch!

22
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,713
Let's go! Let's go!

23
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,299
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

24
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,680
- Let me go!
- Hey! Hey!

25
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,058
I'm good. Get off me!

26
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,935
Get off me, get off me!

27
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,396
That's it! Game's over!

28
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,857
Game's over!

29
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,441
Crane. Great game, great game.

30
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,696
Tell everyone out there what it
feels like to be the next LeBron James.

31
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,449
LeBron James?
I'm the only Ty Crane.

32
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,955
All right, you heard it here first,
"the only Ty Crane."

33
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,666
Why do all the benchwarmers
always got something to say?

34
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,293
We watching the damn game,
that's why.

35
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,003
- You got a good view, huh?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,171
Ty Crane outscored
our whole team by himself.

37
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,757
- Wonder how that happened.
- We had nothing but 32 points.

38
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,843
I got 12 of them.
What did you get, Kenyon?

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,845
Just shut up, dog.
The Crane swooped down on you

40
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,181
and delivered a basket of beat-down.
He clowned you, dog.

41
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,100
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.
- He had you on lock the whole game.

42
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,769
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth
before I close it for good.

43
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,479
You didn't do shit either
the whole game.

44
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,648
What, homey?
I will slap the taste out your mouth!

45
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,901
- Can we all just get along?
- Shut your little ass up!

46
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,153
- You didn't even play!
- That's what I'm talking about.

47
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,114
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!
- You got two points in 16 minutes,

48
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,450
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.
- Exactly!

49
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,119
Timo, you was in the whole time,
you never even touched the rock.

50
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,954
You didn't do shit.
You might as well...

51
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,458
- Who was you passing the ball to?
- You were playing and didn't do shit!

52
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,468
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond
High School all-American, 1972.

53
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,428
Good to see you, sir.

54
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,805
I was really happy to see you
in the stands tonight.

55
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,309
I have to tell you, sir,
I haven't made up my mind yet.

56
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,480
As I've told you,
it's time for me to step down.

57
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,982
Last few years
have been really tough.

58
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,151
Well, losing's hard, sir.

59
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,280
This isn't about
losing games, Kenny.

60
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,786
I can't get them to show up
for school, for practice.

61
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,456
I can't get parents involved, and I'm
done chasing kids in the streets

62
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,166
and pulling them into the gym.

63
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,960
Yeah, it's a tough job.

64
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,337
Richmond is a tough little city.

65
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,966
When I saw you here tonight,
I thought, "I got him. He's in."

66
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,052
Well, actually,
I was here for another reason.

67
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,888
My son plays for St. Francis.

68
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,598
He does?

69
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,810
- Which kid was he?
- Well, you didn't see him.

70
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,272
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.
- That's great. Great school.

71
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,983
What, you wanna go?

72
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,529
- Hey!
- Lyle, bring it!

73
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,949
Let him go. You think everybody's
scared of you? I ain't scared of you!

74
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,495
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be
trying to act all hard all the time, man?

75
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,123
God, I'm sick of you, man!

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,878
You know, that school was rough
when I went there.

77
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,547
It's way beyond that now.

78
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,466
Well, then, just forget about it.
Don't even discuss it again.

79
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,804
I can't quite do that. Coach officially
offered me the job tonight.

80
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,222
The clock's ticking.

81
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,267
And when you say "offering job,"
there's usually money involved.

82
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,854
Yeah, there might be
a thousand bucks in it for me.

83
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,439
For five months of work?

84
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,609
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

85
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,069
And the team, it's so bad.

86
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,072
Those boys,
they're so angry and undisciplined.

87
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,241
And besides, you know,
you don't have the time.

88
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,910
You're trying to open up
a second store.

89
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,537
Exactly, I don't have the...
Hell, I don't have any time.

90
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,748
And you promised to take
your girlfriend to Mexico.

91
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,458
And I'm definitely
keeping that promise.

92
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,877
There's no way
I'm not going to Mexico

93
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,130
and hanging out on the beach
with you in your bikini.

94
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,548
I can't take that job.

95
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,468
So when do you start?

96
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,933
- You should've spoken to me first.
- Why?

97
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,478
- It was a personal choice for me.
- So, what happens to me?

98
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,230
You still gonna come to my games?

99
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,274
I'll probably miss most of
your games, Damien. I'm sorry.

100
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,984
Then I'll go to Richmond
and play for you.

101
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,402
No.

102
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,238
Well, why not?

103
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:49,117
- Dad, you've always been my coach.
- This is a great school, Damien.

104
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,119
It puts you in a great position
for college.

105
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,788
Dad, I'm a freshman!

106
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,581
Just because I'm coaching
at Richmond,

107
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,251
it doesn't change our plans
for your future, all right?

108
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,322
Yo, my man, I need a vial, man.
You got that good dope? How much?

109
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,213
You forgot to bring your ID,
didn't you?

110
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,465
- I forgot it.
- Every day.

111
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,510
Good morning. Ken Carter.

112
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,515
- Thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

113
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,268
Hey, yo, what's up?

114
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,859
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.
- You too, ma'am.

115
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:08,322
If the offer still stands,
I'd like to coach the team.

116
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,285
Well, I hope you're up for the task.
These young men need discipline.

117
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,038
The job comes with a $1,500 stipend

118
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,333
and a major time commitment
for the next four months.

119
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,544
- I accept.
- Great.

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,297
We're thrilled to have you.
Gentlemen, I hate to be abrupt,

121
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,716
but I do have a budget meeting
I need to run to.

122
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,052
Mr. Carter, is there anything
you need from us?

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,598
Well, I just need about
25 copies of this document.

124
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,477
- I'm all set.
- Ray, would you see to it

125
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,854
that Mr. Carter...?
Coach Carter gets these copies?

126
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,524
- Will do.
- Gentlemen.

127
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,571
I'm not saying this is
not gonna be a challenge,

128
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,240
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

129
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,409
Just keep in mind,
these are good boys.

130
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,912
Guys! Guys!

131
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,705
Guys!

132
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,209
Now, as you know, I've been... Hey!

133
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,961
You know I've been looking
for a new coach

134
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,296
to take over for me this season.

135
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,008
This is Ken Carter.
He went to Richmond.

136
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,761
He was a two-sport all-American.

137
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,265
Still holds records
for scoring, assists, steals.

138
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,893
Basketball scholarship to
George Mason University.

139
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,229
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

140
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,440
Now, let's give him
the respect he's due.

141
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,068
- They're all yours, coach.
- Thank you, sir.

142
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,156
Good afternoon, young men.

143
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:38,245
As Coach White said, I'm your
new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

144
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,206
I guess I need to speak louder
so you can hear me.

145
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,834
I'm Ken Carter,
your new basketball coach.

146
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,337
We hear you, dog.
But we can't see you.

147
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,047
The glare from your
big, black-ass head

148
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,216
is hella shiny, man.
Damn, do you buff it?

149
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,803
Oh, you got jokes to go along
with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

150
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,474
First of all, if you need to know
my credentials,

151
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,061
as Coach White said,
they're on the wall there behind you.

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,902
Secondly, if basketball practice
starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

153
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,656
You, shooting the ball.
What's your name, sir?

154
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,826
Jason Lyle, but I ain't no sir.

155
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,411
You're not a sir.

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,663
Well, are you a madam?

157
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:27,044
- Little bitch. Bitch.
- As of now, you are a sir.

158
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,962
So are the rest of you.

159
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,715
"Sir" is a term of respect.

160
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:35,510
And you will have my respect
until you abuse it.

161
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,140
Mr. Lyle, how many games
did you guys win last season?

162
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,477
Like four wins, 22 losses.

163
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,938
- Sir.
- Sir.

164
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,692
I'm going to give you contracts.

165
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,532
If you sign and honor
your side of them,

166
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,909
we are going to be successful.

167
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,578
Damn, do I get a signing bonus
for signing this contract?

168
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:05,541
Yes, sir.
You get to become a winner.

169
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,711
Because if there's one thing I know,
it is this:

170
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,631
The losing stops now.

171
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,177
Starting today, you will play
like winners, act like winners,

172
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,223
and most importantly,
you will be winners.

173
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,935
If you listen and learn,
you'll win basketball games.

174
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,438
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

175
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,149
...is the key to winning out there.

176
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:36,071
This contract states that you will
maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

177
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,115
You will attend all your classes

178
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,076
and you will sit in the front row
of those classes.

179
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,954
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.
- Excuse me.

180
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,832
- Did you say something, sir?
- Worm was wondering,

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,960
are you some country church nigga,
with your tie on and all that?

182
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,753
- Right.
- That's what you wanna say, right?

183
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,213
And what is your name, sir?

184
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,424
I'm Timo Cruz, sir.

185
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,844
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

186
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:04,558
what you should both know
is we treat ourselves with respect.

187
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,185
We don't use the word "nigga."

188
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,312
Are you some preacher man
or some shit?

189
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,731
Because God ain't gonna do you
no good in this neighborhood.

190
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,025
- I live in this neighborhood, sir.
- Sir.

191
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,236
Can you believe
this uppity Negro, sir?

192
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,448
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

193
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,035
- ...leave the gym right now.
- For what?

194
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll ask you one last time
to leave the gym

195
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,792
- before I help you leave.
- Before you what?

196
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,629
Do you even know who I am?

197
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,382
From what I can see, a very confused
and scared young man.

198
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,011
Scared of who? Scared of you?
I'm supposed to be scared of you?

199
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,264
Nigga, I ain't scared of nobody.
I will lay your ass out.

200
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,724
I don't think so.

201
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,232
All right.

202
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,156
What you doing? Get off me!

203
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,161
Teachers ain't supposed
to touch students.

204
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,163
I'm not a teacher.

205
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,791
I'm your new basketball coach.

206
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,677
This ain't over!

207
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,111
Is there anybody else
who's not feeling this contract?

208
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,698
Come on, man, where you going?

209
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,202
I don't do high school contracts.

210
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,871
Tell us when you need
the real ballers.

211
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,164
I will do that, sir.

212
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,876
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

213
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,212
Then I guess we'll have new
leading scorers this season, huh?

214
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,258
Now, I cannot teach you the game
of basketball

215
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,470
until your conditioning is at a level
that allows me to do so.

216
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,849
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

217
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,145
To the baseline!

218
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,363
I presume you all know
what suicides are.

219
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,781
So...

220
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,292
I saw the St. Francis game
the other night.

221
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,545
None of you have a problem
shooting the ball.

222
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,424
You all had a problem
getting up and down the court.

223
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,345
If you are late, you will run.

224
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,390
If you give me attitude,
you will do push-ups.

225
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,727
So you can push-up or shut up.

226
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,395
That's up to you.

227
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,023
- Yo, how many we gonna do?
- Sir.

228
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,735
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

229
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:06,990
Let's see how many you can do
in one hour and seven minutes.

230
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,577
Fellas, don't make me
commit homicide.

231
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,289
I said, suicides!
Put your hand on the line!

232
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,376
Put your hand on the line!

233
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:23,549
Damn, I can't keep this shit up, man.
I can barely walk.

234
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:27,219
- I know, my legs is hella sore, son.
- Need some Gatorade or something.

235
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,390
- There go your girl right there, son.
- Yeah.

236
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,142
Hey, what's with you and her homeys?
You gonna try to holler at them?

237
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,562
Man, I'm hollering
at both of the friends.

238
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,355
- Both of them?
- Yeah, because I need that.

239
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,567
You know, I need variety in my life.
I can't just have one girl.

240
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,151
You know what I'm saying?
I need both.

241
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,570
Hey.

242
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,029
- What's up, baby?
- How you doing?

243
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,408
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard
about that two-for-one special, right?

244
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,495
Two of you, one of me.
Now, that's special.

245
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,416
- Please. Whatever, Worm.
- Yeah, special ed.

246
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,209
- Get your arm off me.
- I like this fox.

247
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,879
You working that chinchilla.
But, look, baby, me and you...

248
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,632
You need to tell him to stop playing it
so close. She don't even like him.

249
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,762
- Why not? Worm's the man.
- Worm is Worm.

250
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,060
Anyway, I got something
for the baby today.

251
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,281
We don't even know if it's a baby yet.
I mean, it's kind of early.

252
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,200
You ain't even been
to the doctor yet.

253
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,454
Hello? I passed the pregnancy test,
Kenyon. Three times.

254
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,714
- These are kind of cute, though.
- I know, I got good taste, right?

255
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,382
Yeah, all right.

256
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,551
Precious little shoes.

257
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,846
Well, I got a little
somethin'-somethin' for you too.

258
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,726
Thank you.

259
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,687
This definitely is a little something.

260
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,068
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

261
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,820
Kenyon!

262
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,281
- What? What's up?
- What are you doing? Give me!

263
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,325
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

264
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,077
You got that for 99 cents?
I've been there.

265
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,247
You can get three brooms and a bucket
for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

266
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,375
That's like thread.
That's not even half a shoelace.

267
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,128
Well, would you like to see me
in this shoelace?

268
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,092
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

269
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,011
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

270
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,847
Three push-ups and move.
One! Two! Three!

271
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,849
Let's go. Explode!

272
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,353
Let me hear you. Let me hear you!
Let me hear it.

273
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,772
Explode! Worm, explode!

274
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,315
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

275
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,609
Give me five!
Just give me five! Push!

276
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,821
Push! Go! Go!
Let me hear you!

277
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,241
Come on, close out!
Explode! Let's go!

278
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,537
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

279
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,127
That's ten suicides for the
whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

280
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,795
This ain't the track team, man.

281
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,423
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

282
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,091
But you're right.

283
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,470
And because you're right,
that's 20 suicides for the entire team

284
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,806
and you get the privilege
of joining Mr. Battle

285
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,851
- with 250 push-ups of your own.
- What, are you serious?

286
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,811
- Yeah.
- This is bullshit!

287
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,648
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

288
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,400
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

289
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,027
Because you gave
such a good answer

290
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,778
and you gave the coach attitude,

291
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,490
you win the bonus prize
of 500 push-ups!

292
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,952
And would you like to go
for the grand prize of a thousand?

293
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,372
No, sir.

294
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,377
To the baseline!
On my whistle! Let's go!

295
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,338
J.B., come on, baby.

296
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,382
I can't even move, son.
Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

297
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,552
- You can't say nothing to him.
- Why can't I say nothing to him?

298
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,013
I'm a white boy? Man, what the...?

299
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,308
Right here. Right here.
Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

300
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,685
Where you going, homey?
Where you going, huh?

301
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,062
- I ain't got shit.
- What?

302
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,731
Please don't shoot me, man.
Go on, take my bag, dog!

303
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,900
Run your shit, homey!

304
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,367
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

305
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,078
Yo, I'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

306
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,956
I'm just playing, B.
Look at you!

307
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,335
Damn! I seen y'all
walking from up the block

308
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,004
like somebody put a pipe
in your asses.

309
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,257
You all right, dog?

310
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,093
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

311
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,845
but y'all damn sure
look sad without me.

312
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,098
But you know what?
I'm gonna watch y'all play.

313
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,766
See y'all get your asses kicked.

314
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:47,229
Yo! I'd love to shoot the shit with
you bitches all night, but I gotta go.

315
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,731
- All right.
- Yo, who that, man?

316
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,692
That's my cousin, Renny.

317
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,443
I'm gonna check y'all.
Come on, let's go.

318
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,612
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

319
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,155
- No, I'm straight, man.
- You sure?

320
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,199
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right, my nigga.

321
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,577
- One love.
- All right, Lyle!

322
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,747
Don't let nobody else put a pipe
up your ass, or you might like it!

323
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,629
Hey, you was scared, huh?
I wasn't scared.

324
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,507
The state only requires
that they have a 2.0 average to play.

325
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,217
Now, you got in here
they need a 2.3.

326
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:20,721
If you have a 2.0, you have to score
at least 1050 on the SAT

327
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,432
to be eligible
for an athletic scholarship.

328
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,935
If you have a 2.3,
you only need 950.

329
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,813
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

330
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,025
It shouldn't be that hard
to maintain a C-plus.

331
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,611
These boys are student athletes.

332
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,779
"Student" comes first.

333
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,491
It says they gotta wear
coat and ties on game days.

334
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,244
They don't own ties!
You gonna supply the ties?

335
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,496
There's a Goodwill
and a Salvation Army store

336
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,749
less than two blocks from here.

337
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,418
They got a box full of ties
for 50 cents apiece.

338
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,462
Yo, man, what you
trying to say, huh?

339
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,132
Oh, we too good to shop at the
Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

340
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,760
- Yeah, I ain't that broke.
- This is crazy!

341
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,846
A dress code and they have to sit
in the front row in class?

342
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:07,809
- This is basketball, man!
- And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

343
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,979
If you want to play basketball
on this team,

344
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,899
these are the simple rules
you have to follow

345
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,818
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

346
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,364
Now, if you decide
to follow these simple rules,

347
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,409
I need you and the boys
to sign this contract.

348
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,539
They can bring the contracts
to practice tomorrow.

349
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,666
If you come to practice.

350
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,044
I wanna thank you all for coming out
and showing your support,

351
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,172
and I hope I have your support
the rest of the season.

352
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,175
- Good night.
- Get up and leave like that?

353
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,595
Look, I have a hard enough time
getting my nephew to...

354
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,058
- How you gonna make them wear ties?
- I want the other coach back!

355
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:04,366
It's one of your contracts, sir.
I've amended that contract.

356
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,828
You require your players
to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

357
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,706
I've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

358
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,126
You require ten hours of community
service, and I've committed to 50.

359
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,547
Any unexcused absences, any other
disciplinary issues at school,

360
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,884
you can nullify this agreement
and send me to any school you want.

361
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,138
And how many days do I have
to consider this offer?

362
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,723
None.

363
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,516
The second page
is a letter you need to sign

364
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,810
that confirms my withdrawal
from St. Francis.

365
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,438
- They know I'm leaving.
- What?

366
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,190
- You withdrew from St. Francis?
- I called Richmond.

367
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,110
- They expect me there in the morning.
- You called Richmond?

368
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,321
You should have spoken to me
about this.

369
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,657
It was a personal choice for me.

370
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,371
Well, I can fix all that in the morning.

371
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,250
Sir, please listen.
All I wanna do is play for you.

372
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,461
If I'm one of the top students
at Richmond,

373
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:01,256
I mean one of the top in the whole
school, and I have great SATs,

374
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,759
I can go to any college
in the country.

375
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,553
I'm asking you to trust me.

376
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,933
You really wanna do this, huh?

377
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,981
Okay.

378
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,651
Part of growing up
is making your own decisions

379
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,612
and living with the consequences.

380
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,827
3.7.

381
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:35,165
And you will earn every minute
of playing time.

382
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,795
Open it, please.

383
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,256
Morning, sir.

384
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,346
<i>♪ My name is J. Lyle
They call me wild ♪</i>

385
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,350
<i>♪ It's all right
Kenyon's mom tonight ♪</i>

386
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,644
<i>♪ - Say what? ♪
♪ - You might think I'm wrong ♪</i>

387
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,063
<i>♪ But she's got these thongs ♪</i>

388
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,817
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
It's Malcolm X from St. Francis.

389
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,652
- Hey, yo, Malcolm!
- Whatever.

390
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,154
- What's up, man?
- What are you doing here, son?

391
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,950
- I transferred to Richmond.
- Oh, no, son, I think you're just lost.

392
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,619
Well, I am actually lost.
Can you tell me how to get to...?

393
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:16,123
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm,
tell your man Fresh Prince here

394
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,293
- how to get to his mansion.
- Fresh bitch.

395
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:26,383
I hope seeing you in this hallway mean
I get to see you on the court today.

396
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:31,680
I can't wait. With your five browns.

397
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,392
Everybody up.

398
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,813
Today we're going to play defense.

399
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,816
Sorry, sir.

400
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,029
Gentlemen, this is a new player,
Damien Carter.

401
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,948
He is my son, and he is late.

402
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,618
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

403
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,620
Sir, it's my first day of school,
I had to stay...

404
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,747
Basketball practice starts at 3.

405
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,584
As of 2:55, you are late.
Get changed in the locker room.

406
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,713
Do your suicides on the far side
of the court so as not to disturb us.

407
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,216
All right, gentlemen,
give me two lines!

408
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,887
Okay, young sirs, we're gonna
take it to the next level.

409
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,265
Everything I knew about basketball,

410
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,351
I learned from women.

411
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,563
I have a sister, her name's Diane.

412
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:26,026
She was always on my case
about every little thing.

413
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,737
Matter of fact, she still is.

414
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:32,241
"Turn down that radio!
You eat the last piece of cake?

415
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,409
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?"

416
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,913
She was always in my face.

417
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,290
So when I call "Diane,"

418
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:44,169
we're gonna play straight
man-to-man pressure defense.

419
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,426
Worm! No, no, no, no, sir.

420
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:52,928
Look at your defensive posture.

421
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,431
Come on. Split your man.
Back straight, butt down.

422
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,685
This hand guards against the passing
lane, this hand protects the crossover.

423
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,688
All right? Palms up!
Get your head in the game.

424
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,607
Now we have Delilah.

425
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,193
She was my childhood sweetheart.

426
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,820
Sir, was she hot?

427
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:14,616
Oh, yes, sir.
She was steaming hot.

428
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:20,372
But she was the devil.
That girl was evil.

429
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,667
I remember once she tricked me
into stealing brownies

430
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:27,296
from Christ the King
First Baptist Church bake sale.

431
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,631
She smiled
and got her way out of it,

432
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,634
while I damn near had to wear
a pillow on my butt

433
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,469
for a month
before I could sit down.

434
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,307
Delilah, gentlemen.
She's our trap defense.

435
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:42,936
Take notes, freshman. This is as
close as you gonna get to playing.

436
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,775
Come on, come on. Move, move!
Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!

437
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,952
Now, I know you're all
concerned that

438
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,371
we didn't work
on our offense during practice.

439
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,624
We have all season to do that.

440
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,127
But what did we do in practice,
Mr. Stone?

441
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:09,671
- Run.
- That's right.

442
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,424
So, what do you think I want you
to do on offense tonight?

443
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,010
- Run?
- Correct again.

444
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,471
I want you to run.

445
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,809
<i>I want you to run every second
that clock is ticking, all game long.</i>

446
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,025
Put him back on the bench!

447
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:35,489
Rebound! Rebound!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

448
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,453
Nice pass, baby!

449
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,290
Push it! Push it!

450
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,960
- Screen.
- Screen, baby. Screen. Screen.

451
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,254
- Worm.
- Let's go, Worm.

452
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,222
Stay alert! Pick him up right there!

453
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,766
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- What's the call, ref?

454
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,769
White four, fifth.
He's out of the game.

455
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:08,272
- Oh, ref, come...
- That's his fifth foul, coach.

456
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,399
- Time, sir.
- Time out, white.

457
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,068
Bad call, ref!
That was a jump ball, damn it!

458
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,903
- Time out, white.
- Come on, fellas.

459
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:17,656
Come on, huddle up. Hustle up.
Get over here.

460
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,241
All right. Huddle up, huddle up.

461
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,411
- Carter, you're in.
- But, coach, he a freshman.

462
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,371
You wanna coach?

463
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,250
All right, take a deep breath, guys.
Come on, deep breaths.

464
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,086
- You tired?
- No, sir.

465
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,088
Those guys are exhausted.

466
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,173
That's why this guy's gonna miss
that free throw.

467
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:38,427
When he does,
Worm and Lyle are our first option.

468
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,930
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole.
Everybody attack the boards, got that?

469
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:44,266
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Richmond on three.

470
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,435
- One, two, three!
- Richmond!

471
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,271
- All right, let's out, all right?
- Step it up, let's go!

472
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,315
Look alive out there.

473
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,944
All right, guys, you're in better shape
than they are. Push it.

474
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,740
Box out, box out.

475
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,283
One shot.

476
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,625
Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!

477
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,543
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, baby!

478
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:21,637
All right.

479
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,518
Kenyon!

480
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:31,897
- Worm!
- Yo, yo.

481
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:34,983
Oh, yeah!

482
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,528
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

483
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:49,456
- Tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog.
- It was all you.

484
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:50,958
A win like that don't mean nothing,

485
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,751
because they can't play anyway,
you feel me?

486
00:29:56,213 --> 00:30:00,300
Okay, Shaq, so you dominated
down low tonight. Any thoughts?

487
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,304
I dropped a 20-piece.
Kobe played his game.

488
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,682
We the champions
till we ain't the champions no more.

489
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,685
- Junior Battle.
- Undefeated until...

490
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,603
Yo, man, on the real,

491
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,689
that was the worst game
I've ever seen in my life.

492
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,358
I thought that shit would never end.
I was dying in the bleachers.

493
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,527
That's right, you were in
the bleachers, weren't you?

494
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,279
We were on the court
handling our business.

495
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,698
That's right. We 1-0, bitch.

496
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,535
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B,
and y'all barely beat them.

497
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,579
Damn, Timo,
why you throwing salt, man?

498
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,456
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

499
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,542
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

500
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,711
I'll knock all y'all off.

501
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,828
- Yo. I'll check y'all later, all right?
- All right.

502
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,581
Yo. Let's do this.

503
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:21,882
- What's up?
- Here's two bundles.

504
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,843
- All right.
- Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

505
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,553
Yo, I got you.

506
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,015
- How you doing, man?
- Chilling, man.

507
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:32,100
You look good.

508
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,602
Got some paper for you.

509
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:38,190
Now we're talking, yeah.

510
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,778
How you living, Timo?

511
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,114
I'm good.

512
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,826
- You all right? For real?
- Yeah.

513
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,163
- Here, take some.
- I'm all right.

514
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,333
No, no, no, take some, please.

515
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,336
You did good, man.
You're doing good, bro.

516
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,091
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me, thank you.

517
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,884
You earned it.

518
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,265
Take a nickel bag, okay?

519
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,518
Go get yourself something, man.

520
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,147
- I'm gonna see you?
- Yeah, next week.

521
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:20,482
Okay, I'm gonna see you.

522
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,235
- Keep it up.
- Yeah.

523
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,046
<i>Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.</i>

524
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,215
Rafeca, I see you looking.

525
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:48,343
Ain't nobody
thinking about you, Worm.

526
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,429
- Oh, okay.
- Gentlemen,

527
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,556
let's review the Hercules game,
shall we?

528
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,600
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

529
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,020
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

530
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,439
No, sir. I had 12 points
and eight assists, sir.

531
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:05,110
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five
turnovers and four missed free throws.

532
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,281
Now, we're talking
about fundamentals here.

533
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:14,036
Until we learn them, I'm adding
a practice every morning at 6 a.m.

534
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:18,373
- Six a.m.?
- We shot 56 percent at...

535
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,710
Mr. Cruz.

536
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,545
Are you lost, sir?

537
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:25,213
What I gotta do to play?

538
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:30,594
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know
the answer to that question.

539
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,013
Now, as I was saying,

540
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:38,060
as a team,
we shot 56 percent from the line.

541
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,063
From now on,
before you leave my gym,

542
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:46,526
you must pay an exit price of 50
made free throws before you can go.

543
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:48,570
- What?
- That's everybody.

544
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,906
- Come on.
- That's a lot of free throws.

545
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,744
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

546
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:58,247
Before you can play on this team...

547
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,416
...you owe me...

548
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,171
...2,500 push-ups...

549
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,006
...and 1,000 suicides.

550
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:09,925
- Damn.
- Damn.

551
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,764
And they must be
completed by Friday.

552
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,767
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.
- He ain't making that.

553
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,938
Today's flavor: Offense.

554
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,107
- Now we talking.
- Now, I have a sister.

555
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,442
Her name is Linda.

556
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:31,113
Linda is smart, she's political.

557
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,532
Well, actually, she's radical.

558
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,451
Linda's got a big Afro.

559
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,539
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

560
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,083
Before we get into that,
let's warm up.

561
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,335
Give me a lay-up line.

562
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:47,462
- Let's go.
- All right.

563
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,298
Let's do it.

564
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:52,259
- Damn, how many sisters he got?
- Who knows.

565
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,303
- Come on, get two more over here.
- Break it out.

566
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,806
- Let's go, guys.
- Energy, guys, energy.

567
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:59,516
We got this, let's go.

568
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,059
- I'm open.
- I got him, I got him.

569
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,811
Right here, right here.
I'm open. I'm open.

570
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,313
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,564
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

572
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:06,857
- Come on.
- It's not my fault.

573
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,275
- He was early.
- Hey.

574
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,153
Yes, it's important to move
without the ball,

575
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,156
but you gotta be patient
on the weak-side screen.

576
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:18,410
Set up your man
and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

577
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,746
Okay. Switch it up.

578
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,373
We got it, come on.
Let's go. Let's get it.

579
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,543
- And call out them picks.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

580
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,882
What is your deepest fear,
Mr. Cruz?

581
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,635
That you're inadequate?

582
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:36,595
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

583
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,933
Go home.

584
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,231
All right, I want seven passes
before you shoot.

585
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,150
- Seven.
- All right.

586
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:53,445
- I got him. I got him.
- Get that ball in there.

587
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,534
You know your task is impossible
before Friday, right?

588
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,123
Move.

589
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,417
Work it, work it.

590
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,004
Run it back.

591
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:35,404
What time your mom getting home?

592
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,364
She doesn't get off for another hour.

593
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,250
Oh, that's Myles.

594
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,252
What?

595
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:07,519
Say, "Hi, Uncle Kenyon."

596
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,479
Say, "Hi."

597
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:10,939
All right, don't worry about it.

598
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:13,734
He'll go back to sleep
right after his bottle.

599
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,152
Right, boo-boo?

600
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,738
Yeah, probably in time
for your mom to get home.

601
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,407
Or when your cousin get back
from getting her hair fried and dyed,

602
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:23,285
like she can afford all that shit.
It's her baby anyway.

603
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:26,705
Well, my mother had to work
a double shift,

604
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:28,457
but they cut her overtime.

605
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:30,959
And my cousin,
don't be trying to dis her.

606
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:32,961
You said we'd be alone.
You call this alone?

607
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,923
Well, that's why we need
our own spot.

608
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:40,844
Did you turn this off?

609
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:44,264
- Yeah, it was boiling.
- Oh, come on.

610
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:46,308
Well, turn it down, not off.

611
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:50,312
This is milk, butter and cheese.
We can't afford to waste this.

612
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,856
And hold him up.

613
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:02,491
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

614
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,618
All right, Myles, here we go.

615
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,287
Gotta cool off a minute.

616
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,963
Ever think about what you were
gonna do before you were pregnant?

617
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,382
What you mean,
going to junior college?

618
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,758
Yeah.

619
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,469
I mean, yeah, I thought about it.

620
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,681
I could go later, I guess.

621
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,559
You have to get some work
after you have the baby.

622
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,727
Me too.

623
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,730
- So I'll work.
- How you gonna go to school?

624
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,607
Why you asking me
all these questions?

625
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:38,402
And you gotta put your hands
under his arm.

626
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,446
You gotta sit him on your chest.
Hold him.

627
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:45,033
- I am holding him.
- You ain't doing it right.

628
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,743
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

629
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:48,495
Look...

630
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,207
I don't know how to do this.

631
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,127
You'll get it.

632
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,796
Right?

633
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:04,761
Look, I gotta help my mom
with some stuff.

634
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,348
- See you later, all right?
- All right.

635
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,436
Call me later, okay?

636
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,563
Later.

637
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:19,860
All right, keep it riding on somebody.

638
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,112
- Don't get lost in there.
- Move it. Move it.

639
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,157
Stay with your man.

640
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:28,035
- Box out, box out!
- Position.

641
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:31,747
Guys...

642
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,540
Up. Up.

643
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:34,708
Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,377
You don't get to your man, stand,
watch the ball.

645
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:40,130
When the ball goes up,
get in good defensive position,

646
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,258
get your body on your man
and explode to the ball.

647
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,844
All right? Let's go.

648
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,346
Run it. You got it.

649
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,932
- Go on, do it.
- Forward pass. Forward pass.

650
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,934
- Work it.
- There you go.

651
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:55,312
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling
a very different story.

652
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,940
I wish you would.
Yes, ma'am, I'm here all week.

653
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,234
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?

654
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,819
Oh, they're great, ma'am. We're 1-0.

655
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,446
Very good.

656
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,906
How may I help you?

657
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,952
Well, I had my boys sign contracts

658
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,788
requiring them to meet
certain academic standards.

659
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:15,624
Yes, I believe one of the faculty
members mentioned that.

660
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,709
Very interesting scare tactic.

661
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,797
Well, in order for that
to be successful,

662
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:24,633
I need their teachers to fill out
weekly progress reports

663
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,928
so I'll know how the boys
are doing in their classrooms.

664
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:30,806
- Okay.
- Well, I haven't received anything

665
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,224
from their teachers.

666
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,147
I don't see how this ties in to your job
as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

667
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:43,193
Well, I took this job with the
understanding I could do it my way.

668
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:44,820
And you can.

669
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,780
Our next faculty meeting
is in two weeks.

670
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,407
I'll remember to bring it up.

671
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:52,244
Why, that would be great.
Thank you, ma'am.

672
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,330
Thank you, sir.

673
00:40:57,874 --> 00:40:59,918
Bring it in, guys.

674
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,129
Let's go, hustle up.

675
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:04,131
Yo, bring it in, y'all.

676
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,301
All right, that's it for today.

677
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:10,262
We have a game tomorrow,
so get some rest tonight.

678
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,891
And remember,
ties and jackets tomorrow.

679
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,477
Clyde.

680
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,820
Mr. Cruz.

681
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,867
I'm impressed with
what you've done.

682
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,578
But you came up short.

683
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:37,581
You owe me 80 suicides
and 500 push-ups.

684
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,668
Please leave my gym.

685
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:45,172
Thanks, Clyde.

686
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,883
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

687
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,387
I'll do push-ups for him.

688
00:41:58,268 --> 00:41:59,728
You said we're a team.

689
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:03,607
One person struggles,
we all struggle.

690
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,860
One player triumphs,
we all triumph, right?

691
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,003
I'll do some.

692
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,756
I'll run suicides too.

693
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:06,128
I'll do some too.

694
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,304
Clyde, keep count.

695
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:19,474
Call me when they're done.

696
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,064
<i>♪ Defense! Defense! ♪</i>

697
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:28,317
Push it. Push it. Move, move!

698
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:29,818
Let's go.

699
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,653
Ball, ball, ball.

700
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,990
Ball, ball, ball.

701
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,159
- Yeah!
- Go.

702
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,164
Move your feet, move your feet.

703
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,291
Go, defense. Go.

704
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,752
Good job. Good job.

705
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,170
- Worm.
- White ball.

706
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:52,507
Palms up, move your feet, right?
Come out. Come out. Come out.

707
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,217
- Mr. Cruz!
- Good game, boy.

708
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:59,014
Hey, hey.

709
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,225
What is your deepest fear,
young man?

710
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,604
Go on.

711
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,274
Why he keep saying that, "What's
your deepest fear?" What that mean?

712
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:12,444
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

713
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:15,530
Move. Move. Move.

714
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,532
No, one more pass.

715
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:27,042
Hands up.

716
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:15,215
Three points, Cruz!

717
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,220
What the hell are you doing, Cruz?
You allergic to lay-ups?

718
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,681
You do that again and you're going
to be glued to the bench.

719
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:28,520
- Swing it.
- Right here.

720
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,235
Come on, last kick.

721
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:37,905
Kick it in. Kick it in. Let's go.

722
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:48,874
You can't guard me, can you?
What you gonna do?

723
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:51,293
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?
- Delilah. Delilah.

724
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:53,879
Come on, come on, come on.

725
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,590
- Shot.
- Yeah, Jason.

726
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:01,386
Kenyon, pose for me.

727
00:46:02,512 --> 00:46:05,098
- Smile.
- Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!

728
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,476
Just play the damn game.

729
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:10,270
Linda, Linda, Linda!

730
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:14,816
There he is. Yeah.

731
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,945
That's me, baby.
That's me. I did that.

732
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,530
I drew that up. Yeah.

733
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:23,075
Run it again.

734
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,371
All right, 1-4, 1-4.
Linda, Linda, Linda!

735
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:35,087
All day, baby. All day!
Can't stop that.

736
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:37,172
Can't stop that!

737
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,302
- Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Worm.

738
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,683
Look at that bow. Look at that.

739
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,602
I tied that. I tied that shit.

740
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,771
Can I get something on the bow?
Let me get some.

741
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,190
Are you crazy?

742
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:57,776
What is wrong with you?

743
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,320
What's wrong with all of you?

744
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:04,032
Since when is winning not enough?

745
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:07,619
Playing hard not enough?

746
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:11,498
No, you have to humiliate
your opponent.

747
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:14,501
Taunt him after every score.

748
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,421
You won four games last season.

749
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:18,839
Four.

750
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:22,259
What gives you the right
to taint the game that I love

751
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:25,178
with trash talk and taunting?

752
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:28,682
What gives you the right to wear
Richmond on your chests

753
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,975
and act like punks?

754
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:32,603
- Coach, they were jawing too.
- So?

755
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,438
You can't show some class?

756
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:37,065
Act like a champion?

757
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:42,738
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

758
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,657
On the line. Now.

759
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:48,869
- Damn.
- Oh, man, come on.

760
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:08,013
Listen, shorty, I'm just gonna be real
with you, okay?

761
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:10,390
You're my girl.

762
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:13,977
I get out on that court
and everything is just getting crazy,

763
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:16,939
all I gotta do is just think about you.

764
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:18,315
Mr. Lyle.

765
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:21,401
Why aren't you in...

766
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:25,239
- ...geometry?
- I'm going there right now, sir.

767
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,950
- Sir, this is Betty.
- Bella.

768
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:29,993
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

769
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:31,787
Go to class.

770
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:40,337
Don't forget that these projects
are due at the end of this week.

771
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:43,799
- So if any of you need extra time...
- Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

772
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,093
- Yes.
- I...

773
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:49,388
...don't see Junior Battle
in this class.

774
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:52,474
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

775
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:56,687
We rarely see him, but when we do,
it's always special.

776
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:00,232
Thank you.

777
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:04,945
"Surprise arrival to the poll
is Richmond High at 19th."

778
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:07,864
- Top 20, baby.
- We're 19th, dog.

779
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:10,325
"The Oilers have posted
a perfect 9-0 mark,

780
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,536
winning on the road against
perennial powerhouses

781
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:14,162
Xavier and Baxter Union."

782
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,835
Junior, you should read
the rest of this.

783
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:21,837
They blowing you up
in this paper.

784
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,424
- Come on, man, read it.
- Man, you know he can't read.

785
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:28,343
- Man, shut up.
- Shut up, Maddux.

786
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:34,975
"Richmond center has been big
as the Oilers are 'boyed."

787
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:39,104
Buoyed. The word is "buoyed."

788
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:44,776
"Buoyed by Junior Battle's
19.8-rebound-a-night numbers."

789
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:48,655
See, that's my big nigga
right there, son. Hey.

790
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:51,325
If you was any bigger,
you'd be my bigger nigga.

791
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:54,995
Sit down. Sit down!

792
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:10,344
"Nigger" is a derogatory term
used to insult our ancestors.

793
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:14,389
See, if a white man used it,
you'd be ready to fight.

794
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:17,434
Your using it teaches him to use it.

795
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:20,646
You're saying it's cool.
Well, it's not cool.

796
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,106
And when you're around me,
I don't wanna hear that shit.

797
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,859
- We clear?
- Yes, sir.

798
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:27,527
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

799
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,029
Yes, sir.

800
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,449
Mr. Worm,

801
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:35,118
what is it you want
out of this basketball season?

802
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:38,956
To win that state championship, sir.

803
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:44,211
Well, who won the state basketball
championship last season, Lyle?

804
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,463
Hell if I know, sir.

805
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:48,840
Does anybody know?

806
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:53,428
Okay.

807
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:56,515
What's your father do for a living,
Mr. Lyle?

808
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:02,896
My father's in jail, sir.

809
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,568
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

810
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:11,280
But that doesn't have to be your life.

811
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:14,074
My point's this:

812
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:16,618
I have four seniors on this team,

813
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,788
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

814
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:23,750
All of whom I think can play
basketball at the college level.

815
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:25,294
College.

816
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:29,298
That's a viable option for all of you.

817
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:33,635
But you have to perform in the
classroom to have that chance.

818
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:36,346
You have to have a vision.

819
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:41,476
Tell me, how do you
see yourselves?

820
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:46,189
ESPN, baby.

821
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:48,984
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

822
00:51:49,192 --> 00:51:53,655
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't
see you in his classroom very often.

823
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,658
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

824
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,869
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

825
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:02,581
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

826
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,583
Oh, you can practice,
but you can't play

827
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,378
until Mr. Gesek tells me
you're caught up in his class.

828
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:11,006
And that's a shout out
to the rest of you.

829
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:12,633
You signed a contract.

830
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,509
You made a commitment.

831
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:17,930
Now, I have your schedules and I'll be
getting reports from your teachers.

832
00:52:18,513 --> 00:52:22,351
If you don't perform in the
classroom, you will not play.

833
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,937
What's up with that?

834
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,147
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

835
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:32,527
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

836
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:38,116
Man, this is bullshit!
We won those games, not you.

837
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:41,370
That's 1,000 push-ups
for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

838
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:43,747
You wanna try for 2,000?

839
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:06,144
Young man, think about the choice
you're making if you walk out that door.

840
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,738
To the baseline.

841
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:24,037
All right. How about LaQuisha,
if it's a girl.

842
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:28,709
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto
called and they want they name back.

843
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,044
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

844
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:33,547
You might as well call the baby
Food Stamp.

845
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,340
You're stupid.

846
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:40,053
All right, I was thinking
I could call her Harmony.

847
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:43,223
- I like Harmony.
- Harmony, oh, that's good. I like that.

848
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:46,685
- What did Kenyon say?
- Please, he want a boy.

849
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:49,271
- Figures.
- Speaking of Michael Jordan...

850
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:50,856
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

851
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:54,693
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men,
and men ain't worth the trouble.

852
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:57,279
Don't you have someplace to go?
Something to do?

853
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,116
Guess he wants me all to himself.

854
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:02,367
See you later.

855
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:04,244
Don't forget,
I need your notes for history.

856
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:07,623
- All right, I got you.
- Yeah. See you later.

857
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,752
I bought us tickets to the dance.

858
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:15,005
Why you telling these
loudmouth girls about the baby?

859
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:17,132
Now everybody's gonna know.

860
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:18,926
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

861
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:22,304
- It's not people's business, Kyra.
- Why you jumping down my throat?

862
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:23,931
What's wrong with you?

863
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:29,269
Look, me and coach been talking,
and he thinks I can play college ball.

864
00:54:29,478 --> 00:54:30,479
All right, so?

865
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,899
So how am I gonna do that
and raise a baby?

866
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:40,113
I don't know. I mean,
I'm not saying it won't be hard.

867
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:42,741
Hard? It's already hard.

868
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,493
The kid ain't even here yet
and I'm worried

869
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:47,829
about how I'm gonna feed it,
how I'm gonna pay for this and that.

870
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,498
Everything.

871
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:51,875
- I'm not ready.
- So, what are you saying?

872
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:55,170
You want out?
Is that what you're saying?

873
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:56,838
Go ahead and say it.

874
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,883
Look, if I wanted to be out,
I would've been out by now, Kyra.

875
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:01,802
That's not it at all. I love you.

876
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:03,387
I wanna be with you.

877
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:05,639
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

878
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,182
I'm thinking about
what's best for us.

879
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,643
You're not trying to think about
what's best for both of us,

880
00:55:09,851 --> 00:55:11,436
you're thinking about
what's best for you.

881
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:15,274
You don't want me to have this baby.
You wanna leave Richmond.

882
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,318
You wanna go play college ball.
So guess what?

883
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:22,406
We ain't got to be ready enough
for nothing, all right?

884
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:25,534
I'm ready enough to do what
I gotta do all by my damn self.

885
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:28,704
So you can take these
and go to the dance yourself.

886
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:33,000
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

887
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,669
Look, ma'am, we talked about this.
I don't see what the problem is.

888
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:37,421
Do you know what the API is,
Mr. Carter?

889
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:38,964
No, I don't.

890
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:40,841
The Academic Performance Index.

891
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:44,052
They judge schools on a scale
of one to ten, ten being the best.

892
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:46,722
Do you have any idea
where Richmond falls on that scale?

893
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,181
No, ma'am, I have no idea.

894
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:51,101
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have
been for the last seven years.

895
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,270
The state rewards schools
for their performance.

896
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,856
So every year I have less money
to pay faculty and staff.

897
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:58,984
- Look, ma'am...
- Can I ask what it is you want?

898
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,194
- I want my boys to go to college.
- College?

899
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:04,072
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates
50 percent of its students,

900
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:05,574
the higher percentage being girls.

901
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:08,619
Now, in my very educated opinion,
you have 15 players on your team,

902
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:10,579
you'll be lucky to graduate
five of them.

903
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:12,581
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I don't agree with you.

904
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:15,584
Look, these boys signed contracts.
Maybe if you'd read one of them...

905
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:18,253
Your job is to win basketball games,
Mr. Carter.

906
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:23,091
- I suggest you start doing your job.
- And your job is to educate these kids.

907
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:26,887
I suggest you start doing yours.

908
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:41,610
Well...

909
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:44,154
...we had another good week.

910
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:47,699
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

911
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,786
But I'm on my own.
You're never here.

912
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:53,664
- It gets crazy.
- Look, I appreciate everything you do.

913
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:55,958
And I promise you... We're closed.

914
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:58,752
...as soon as the season is over,
I will be here for you.

915
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,379
Mr. Carter?

916
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,172
- I'm...
- Junior Battle's mother.

917
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:03,924
Yes, ma'am, I remember you.

918
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:06,802
Willa. Willa Battle.

919
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:09,388
How may I help you, ma'am?

920
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:10,973
Mr. Carter, I got a phone call today

921
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:13,892
from a coach at a junior college
in Sacramento.

922
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,103
Now, they wanna see
Junior play this Friday.

923
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:18,647
Well, that's great, ma'am,
but Junior broke some rules...

924
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:20,399
And I agree with them.

925
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:23,151
I'm not here to argue
with your rules.

926
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,945
I'm not.

927
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:30,242
Almost two years ago now,

928
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:34,746
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

929
00:57:35,414 --> 00:57:40,752
...killed, and it's been confusing
and hard for me and for Junior.

930
00:57:41,878 --> 00:57:44,131
After you lose a son...

931
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:50,262
...every time the phone rings,
your heart stops.

932
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,766
Now, I'm not asking
for special attention.

933
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:58,562
I agree he needs to get straight
with his classes.

934
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:02,816
But the idea of junior college
had never even occurred to my son.

935
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:06,862
Now, I could move to the Hercules
school district, and he could play there.

936
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:11,825
- But moving is not gonna solve...
- But I want him to play for you.

937
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:14,828
Look, I'm not gonna stand here

938
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:18,540
and say I know how it feels
to lose a son, because I don't.

939
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:23,629
And I do appreciate you
putting your trust in me.

940
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:26,632
But I need to hear that from Junior.

941
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:28,759
He in the car.

942
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:35,265
Junior!

943
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,653
Go on.

944
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:55,327
I'm sorry for what I said and did
at practice,

945
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:58,622
and I promise to get caught up
with my classes, sir.

946
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:06,129
Look me in the eye, sir.

947
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,762
Everything inside me tells me
if I take you back,

948
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,556
I'd be making a mistake
and you'll make a fool of me.

949
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:18,642
No, sir.

950
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:23,146
You owe me 1,000 push-ups

951
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:26,024
and 1,000 suicides
before you can play.

952
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,860
I'll see you at practice tomorrow.

953
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:32,948
Thank you, sir.

954
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:43,792
And you gonna do
every last one of them.

955
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:46,044
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

956
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:47,629
I don't know who you think you are.

957
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,216
The next time you make a decision,
you better ask me first.

958
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,885
Yo, Junior,
you did your thing tonight, man.

959
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:56,722
- Good looking out, yo.
- Yeah, good shot, Junior.

960
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,516
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Gentlemen, listen up.

961
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:04,187
I just received a call from the director
of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

962
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:06,732
You have been invited.

963
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,443
- Yeah!
- Yeah, baby!

964
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,324
Now, I have more good news.

965
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,618
I spoke to Principal Garrison today.

966
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:21,663
She informs me that your teachers will
have your academic-progress reports

967
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:23,790
prepared by the end
of holiday break.

968
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,459
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

969
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:27,544
Yo, not only are our grades
all right, coach,

970
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:30,422
- but we undefeated, homeboy.
- Yeah!

the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

975
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,359
Get down!

976
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:15,759
So give it up for the new
kings of Richmond, y'all!

977
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:17,844
Yeah! Give it up, baby!

978
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:19,972
Yo, we 12-0, y'all,

I wanna see all the beautiful people

981

Y'all gonna wanna see the look on
the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

982
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:29,481
when the Richmond Oilers
roll into town.

983
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,900
Holla!

984
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:54,650
Kyra, what are you thinking?
You can't drink!

985
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:56,652
- You're pregnant, girl.
- Stop.

986
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:58,070
It's soda, all right?

987
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:00,072
So why don't you just go
back downstairs

988
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,157
and find one of your little girlies
to freak with.

989
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,576
It ain't even like that.
Some girl just danced up on me.

990
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,453
- That ain't shit.
- Whatever.

991
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:08,538
You shouldn't be here.
If you're serious about this,

992
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,540
you need to check this bullshit.
Because if not...

993
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:14,002
If not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold
my hand through an abortion?

994
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:16,171
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know what I want.

995
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,881
You so damn sure you wanna
have this baby,

996
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,591
why don't you tell me how
it's gonna be.

997
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:21,510
Everything's great, right?

998
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:24,304
Your cousin is 19 with two kids
already, Kyra.

999
01:03:24,554 --> 01:03:25,889
It's great?

1000
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:27,975
It was great when we
was getting down.

1001
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:29,851
You ain't having no second
thoughts about that.

1002
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,354
You loved me
when it came to that.

1003
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:36,483
Look, Kyra, I can't tell you
what to do,

1004
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:39,695
but I look around and I see exactly
how I don't wanna live.

1005
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,196
Paycheck to paycheck?

1006
01:03:41,405 --> 01:03:42,906
Dead-end job?

1007
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:45,450
You make it seem like everything's
gonna be all good,

1008
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:47,911
like everything's so wonderful.

1009
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,206
You don't care about me.

1010
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:55,544
You just wanna go to college,
play ball and forget about me.

1011
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:58,297
- Kyra, that's not even how it is.
- I don't care what you say.

1012
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,383
- I'm having this baby.
- And then what?

1013
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:03,051
You got everything figured out, right?

1014

01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:42,497
- Foul's on red five. On the block.
- Don't tie me like that!

1072
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,459
Coach! Please get back in the box.

1073
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:47,753
Please get in the box?
Please get your head in the game!

1074
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:49,171
Give me a break!

1075
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:51,632
Cruz. In for Lyle.

1076
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:55,010
- Kenyon! Damien!
- Sub, for five.

1077
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,054
Let's go.

1078
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:00,682
Listen, we got nine seconds left.
Get the ball, push it hard.

1079
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:03,393
The ball's coming to you, Kenyon.
Run Linda. Run Linda.

1080
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:05,479
You be open, all right?
Let's go. You can do this.

1081
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,814
Do it. Let's go.
Come on, sirs. Hurry.

1082
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:10,067
Let's go, guys! Let's go!

1083
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,946
Let's go! Let's go!

1084
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:16,698
One shot.

1085
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,368
Backboard D!
Backboard D!

1086
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:35,509
<i>And the Bayhill Cougars take the lead
with nine seconds left.</i>

1087
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:39,096
<i>Go to war, Miss Margaret,
this is a tight one.</i>

1088
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:41,014
Let's go, let's go!

1089
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,517
Linda! Linda!

1090
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:46,019
Watch the pick! Watch the pick!

1091
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:53,819
Stop the ball! Stop the ball!

1092
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:58,282
It's not there! It's not there!
To the hole! To the hole!

1093
01:09:59,866 --> 01:10:01,326
Watch it!

1094
01:10:03,662 --> 01:10:04,913
D up, man!

1095
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:11,837
Yeah!

1096
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:33,900
It's all right, man.

1097
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:39,948
- Nice game. Nice game.
- Good game, coach. Thank you, sir.

1098
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:45,162
<i>♪ Rich what? Richmond! ♪</i>

1099
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:48,123
<i>♪ Rich what? Richmond! ♪</i>

1100
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:50,626
<i>♪ Rich what? Richmond! ♪</i>

1101
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:53,795
Line up! Line up!
Let's shake hands.

1102
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:56,089
That's what I'm talking
about, coach.

1103
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:59,426
- Way to go, Lyle. Good game, son.
- Love you, Dad.

1104
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,094
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now present

1105
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:04,806
the 22nd Annual Bayhill Tournament
championship trophy

1106
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:07,142
to Richmond High School.

1107
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:29,957
Hey, number three.

1108
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:38,131
- Nice game.
- Thank you.

1109
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:44,721
Okay, cool.

1110
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:59,278
- All right, come on.
- All right.

1111
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:01,321
Watch his door.

1112
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:08,787
Yo, yo. Come on, man, let's go.

1113
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:28,432
Load up, load up.

1114
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:47,200
Tonya, guess what.

1115
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:49,536
We won the whole thing.

1116
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:53,040
That's right, 16-0.

1117
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:54,916
Oh, and here's the best part:

1118
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,502
Your second-favorite man was MVP.

1119
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:58,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1120
01:12:59,129 --> 01:13:00,881
I shouldn't tell you that.
He should tell you.

1121
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:03,884
I'll wake him up so he can tell you.
Hold on.

1122
01:13:05,552 --> 01:13:07,888
Why don't you try their doorbell
with your ghetto self. Move.

1123
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:09,848
Can you reach that?

1124
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:19,191
- Look at this place.
- Glad you guys could come.

1125
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:21,902
Oh, you know, we try to be
up in here, baby.

1126
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:25,906
Yo, what's up? This is a nice crib.

1127
01:13:38,669 --> 01:13:41,797
Know what? He must be
in somebody else's room.

1128
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:57,270
Like I was saying, you know,
I'm Junior Battle. I'm the man.

1129
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:00,273
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I know.

1130
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:03,443
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?
- Maybe.

1131
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:17,833
Yo!

1132
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:20,377
You looking for your team?

1133
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:22,296
Yes, sir.

1134
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,633
Oh, baby. Hard biz.
Know what I'm saying?

1135
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:30,178
This is my style right here.
I'm amazing. Feel me, Lyle?

1136
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:32,139
Hey, yo, Lyle.
Let me get a coochie juice.

1137
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:34,683
I got you, dog. I got you.

1138
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:36,476
- Yo, Worm!
- What up, dog?

1139
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,312
- Damien!
- Yeah?

1140
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,022
I'm open!

1141
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,107
Damien!

1142
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:49,281
- Damien, are you drunk?
- No. I don't drink.

1143
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:51,366
- Sorry about the thing.
- It's okay.

1144
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:54,036
- I see you!
- I see you too.

1145
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:57,831
- I see her!
- Why don't we go swimming.

1146
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,916
- We're going swimming?
- Yeah.

1147
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,668
Hey, I'm going swimming!

1148
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:04,838
I'm going swimming!

1149
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:08,508
You're going swimming
with the MVP!

1150
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:10,927
MVP!

1151
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:26,234
This water's probably
cold as hell, shorty. I don't know.

1152
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:28,779
And swimming ain't my cup of tea,
baby. Know what I'm saying?

1153
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:31,907
Heated. Probably 90 degrees.

1154
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:34,743
- We don't have bathing suits.
- Right.

1155
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:36,954
Neither do we.

1156
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:41,124
Oh, so it's like that?

1157
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,043
Show me the money, then,
know what I'm saying?

1158
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:45,963
- Damn!
- Since it's like that.

1159
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,555
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.

1160
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:59,935
- Damn!
- You are looking right.

1161
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:02,104
I like that.

1162
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:04,022
You guys coming?

1163
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,525
We're getting in there.

1164
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:10,112
I gotta take my chain off
so it don't turn green.

1165
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,032
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

1166
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:16,743
Heaven!

1167
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,474
Excuse me.

1168
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,104
- Can I help you?
- I'm Ken Carter,

1169
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:46,106
coach of the Richmond High
basketball team.

1170
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:48,066
Richmond?

1171
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,361
- You're a little lost, aren't you?
- Well, I'm looking for my son.

1172
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:55,282
The cab driver told me he dropped
the team off here for a party.

1173
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,034
Excuse me.

1174
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:40,827
Oh, my God, is that...?

1175
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,621
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.

1176
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:44,831
You see your son?

1177
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:47,334
Yes, sir, I do.

1178
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:54,841
Damien Carter.

1179
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:57,928
Get your ass out of that pool.

1180
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:00,097
Yes, sir.

1181
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,849
Richmond High players, let's go!

1182
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,269
- Coach!
- Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1183
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:08,021
Worm?

1184
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:11,024
What up, coach?

1185
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:13,235
I got somebody I want
you to meet.

1186
01:18:13,568 --> 01:18:17,155
Now, I just met her,
but she is fine as hell.

1187
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:20,158
- Her name is...
- Susan!

1188
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:22,577
- Susan. He right!
- Oh, shit.

1189
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:25,580
My daughter, Susan.

1190
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:30,544
You are not going to like
what happens in practice on Monday.

1191
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:32,963
You think you've run for me before?

1192
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:37,718
I come to your rooms to celebrate
with you, and you sneak...

1193
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,765
I end up taking a road trip
to the suburbs,

1194
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:46,560
where I find my
drunk-ass point guard

1195
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:49,062
on top of Daddy's little princess!

1196
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:53,108
Actually, I was on the bottom, coach.
She was on the top.

1197
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:55,777
Worm, do you wanna be
on this team?

1198
01:18:55,986 --> 01:18:58,613
Because you're about six words
from getting kicked off

1199
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:01,742
and kicked off the goddamn bus!

1200
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:04,202
Cruz, open your eyes!

1201
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,580
Ghetto hoop stars!

1202
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:10,542
Signing autographs
and humping the honeys!

1203
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:13,837
Well, I'm gonna show you
what humping is.

1204
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:17,966
Coach, we won the tournament.

1205
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:19,509
We undefeated.

1206
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,803
I mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1207
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:23,347
Winners?

1208
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:39,172
Oh, no.

1209
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:42,384
Oh, no, no, no.

1210
01:20:42,551 --> 01:20:45,137
Oh, no!

1211
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,018
God...!

1212
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:04,573
You guys are awesome!

1213
01:21:17,919 --> 01:21:19,504
What's up, Cruz?

1214
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:20,881
I don't know.

1215
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:23,717
Coach giving us a day off, I guess.

1216
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,472
Yo, I don't even know where
the library's even at.

1217
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,766
- I bet you don't.
- "Library's at"?

1218
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:33,226
He don't know
where the library's at.

1219
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:49,826
Quiet.

1220
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:52,913
Quiet!

1221
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:57,459
Gentlemen, in this hand,
I hold contracts

1222
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:00,087
signed by me and signed by you.

1223
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:04,925
In this hand, I hold academic-progress
reports prepared by your teachers.

1224
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:08,136
We have six players failing
at least one class,

1225
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:12,432
eight players getting incompletes
based on attendance.

1226
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:15,852
Gentlemen, you have failed to up...

1227
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,105
No, I'm sorry.

1228
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:20,774
We have failed.

1229
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:23,068
We have failed each other.

1230
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:26,154
Now, there are some of you
who have upheld this contract.

1231
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:29,783
But know that we are a team.

1232
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:32,869
And until we all meet the terms
of this contract,

1233
01:22:33,078 --> 01:22:34,788
the gym will remain locked.

1234
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:36,206
- Locked?
- What?

1235
01:22:36,415 --> 01:22:38,625
- What you mean, locked?
- What, like for the day?

1236
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,711
- He must mean for the day.
- Mr. Thompson,

1237
01:22:40,919 --> 01:22:44,131
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have
generously volunteered their time

1238
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:45,841
to help us reach our goals.

1239
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:47,676
But, coach, I have a 3.3.

1240
01:22:47,884 --> 01:22:49,261
That's good, sir.

1241
01:22:49,469 --> 01:22:51,513
Do you score all the points
for the team too?

1242
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:57,519
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1243
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:01,023
Do you know what Oilers
stands for?

1244
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:06,320
Sir?

1245
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:09,906
Know that you're not just
walking out on me.

1246
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:12,159
You're walking out on them.

1247
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:14,870
I had to beg you.

1248
01:23:16,663 --> 01:23:19,249
And then I ran all those sprints.

1249
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,501
I did all that shit.

1250
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:25,839
I killed myself for you, sir,
to get back on the team.

1251
01:23:29,343 --> 01:23:31,094
This is bullshit.

1252
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:56,995
You put a lock on the gym and forced
them to meet you in the library?

1253
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:58,705
- Are you crazy?
- Miss Garrison.

1254
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:01,041
I'm surprised you know
where my office is.

1255
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:02,793
Take the lock off that gym.

1256
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:04,461
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1257
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,254
Maybe someone on the other end
of that phone

1258
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:08,173
has a solution to our problem.

1259
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:11,468
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter,
but your methods are a bit extreme.

1260
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,595
You painted an extreme picture.

1261
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:16,640
No one expects them to graduate,
no one expects them to go to college.

1262
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:19,601
So you take away basketball,
the one area of their lives

1263
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,728
- where they have some success?
- Yes, ma'am.

1264
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,563
And you challenge them
academically?

1265
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:25,482
- Yes, ma'am.
- And what if they fail?

1266
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,776
Then we've failed.

1267
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:31,613
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter,
both you and I know

1268
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:34,074
that for some of these kids,
this basketball season

1269
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:36,868
will be the highlight of their lives.

1270
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:41,415
Well, I think that's the problem.
Don't you?

1271
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:08,775
- Good morning, Coach Carter.
- Good morning.

1272
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:10,736
Quite the Pandora's box
you've opened.

1273
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:12,362
Oh, I get all the blame now?

1274
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:15,449
Let's just say I'm happy to give you
all the credit.

1275
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:18,869
I've got every news reporter in town
waiting to speak to you.

1276
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:21,788
Got a press conference set up
around the front of the gymnasium.

1277
01:25:22,205 --> 01:25:24,249
Coach Carter has taken the lockout
to the next level

1278
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:26,168
by canceling last night's game.

1279
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:29,963
Richmond forfeited the game,
making it their first loss of the season.

1280
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:31,965
And for now,
the lock remains on the gym.

1281
01:25:32,174 --> 01:25:33,925
Here he comes.
Here he comes now.

1282
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:38,305
Coach Carter! Coach!
Can I get a question?

1283
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:41,933
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to thank you for your patience.

1284
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:44,895
At this time, I'd like to introduce
Coach Ken Carter.

1285
01:25:45,103 --> 01:25:47,356
You may direct
your questions to him.

1286
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:52,152
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players
whose grades qualify them to play?

1287
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:54,071
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1288
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,615
We support each other
on and off the court.

1289
01:25:56,823 --> 01:25:59,159
Anybody still think coach
bluffing now?

1290
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:01,995
I feel like running right up
in the middle of all those reporters

1291
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:04,665
and telling them I think this
is bullshit, son.

1292
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:07,209
Maybe you should've gone
to class, Lyle.

1293
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:10,170
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog.
My grades are fine, homeboy.

1294
01:26:10,379 --> 01:26:13,382
- It's Junior they should've locked out.
- Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.

1295
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:16,885
- Why don't you try spelling it, then.
- Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.

1296
01:26:17,094 --> 01:26:19,846
- Junior, if you need help, I'll tutor you.
- Man, I don't need no help.

1297
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,682
Well, he ain't lock us out
for no reason.

1298
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:25,352
We been tripping lately, man.
All y'all know it.

1299
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,896
How do you think the community's
gonna react to this lockout?

1300
01:26:28,105 --> 01:26:31,191
I'm not really sure. I hope
they'll support these young men.

1301
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,402
What, man?

1302
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,862
No, man, it's just funny, dog,
because, Junior, man,

1303
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:39,241
you thought it was bad all us knew
your dumb ass was failing science.

1304
01:26:39,449 --> 01:26:41,952
Now the whole world about to know
your dumb ass failing science.

1305
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,871
- Man.
- Hey, man.

1306
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:49,751
And you have Fremont this Saturday,
the biggest game on your schedule.

1307
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,797
Now, Richmond is gonna riot
if you forfeit that game.

1308
01:26:54,006 --> 01:26:55,549
Saturday is a long way off.

1309
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,718
We'll see what happens.
Thank you all for coming.

1310
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,429
That's all the time I have right now.
I have to get back to work.

1311
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:03,557
Coach, have you talked to any
of the parents?

1312
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:06,226
Thank you for your time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1313
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:09,062
I'd like to remind you that classes
are in session,

1314
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:11,648
so as you leave campus,
please do so quietly.

1315
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:14,484
I ain't turning the cheek.

1316
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:17,112
He come up in my 'hood,
I'm serious, it's on.

1317
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:19,531
- Young sirs.
- It's always been like that.

1318
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,700
It's been a long day.

1319
01:27:21,908 --> 01:27:24,911
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1320
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,207
Let's take this time to say whatever it is
we want while the doors are closed.

1321
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:33,003
You have the floor.
This is about us.

1322
01:27:33,211 --> 01:27:36,548
Man, this shit ain't about us.
This is all about Coach Carter.

1323
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:38,467
We're the basketball team.

1324
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:42,137
All I see is you on TV,
getting famous, eating that shit up.

1325
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:44,640
- Is that all you see?
- It's all I see.

1326
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:46,600
You ain't lying.

1327
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:48,769
Well, let me tell you what I see.

1328
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:54,441
I see a system that's designed
for you to fail.

1329
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:57,444
Now, I know you all like stats,
so let me give you some.

1330
01:27:57,778 --> 01:28:01,531
Richmond High only graduates
50 percent of its students.

1331
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:06,912
And of those that do graduate,
only 6 percent go to college.

1332
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,084
Which tells me, when I walk down
the halls and I look in your classrooms,

1333
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:16,546
maybe only one student
is going to go to college.

1334
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:20,634
"Well, damn, Coach Carter, if I ain't
going to college, where I'm gonna go?"

1335
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:22,970
Now, that's a great question.

1336
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:28,642
And the answer for young
African-American men in here is this:

1337
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:30,727
Probably to prison.

1338
01:28:31,144 --> 01:28:35,065
In this county,
33 percent of black males

1339
01:28:35,273 --> 01:28:39,695
between 18 and 24 get arrested.

1340
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:42,656
So look at the guy on your left.

1341
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:45,951
Now look at the guy on your right.

1342
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:49,496
One of you is going
to get arrested.

1343
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:51,832
Growing up here in Richmond,

1344
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:56,670
you're 80 percent more likely
to go to prison than college.

1345
01:28:57,379 --> 01:28:59,840
Those are the numbers.

1346
01:29:00,716 --> 01:29:02,884
Those are some stats for your ass.

1347
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:06,013
Now, I want you to go home...

1348
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,640
...and look at your lives tonight...

1349
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:11,685
...and look at your parents' lives...

1350
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:15,230
...and ask yourself, "Do I want better?"

1351
01:29:15,939 --> 01:29:18,108
If the answer is yes,

1352
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:20,527
I'll see you here tomorrow.

1353
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:23,196
And I promise you...

1354
01:29:24,197 --> 01:29:27,492
...I will do everything in my power

1355
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:29,411
to get you to college

1356
01:29:29,619 --> 01:29:31,872
and to a better life.

1357
01:29:58,607 --> 01:30:02,235
I don't understand this.
It's a letter, how can it be a number?

1358
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:04,112
How are balancing
those equations coming?

1359
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:07,282
- I can't do this.
- Hold on. Come on, son.

1360
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:08,659
Don't give up yet, son.

1361
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:11,662
<i>Here's a story out of California
that's getting national attention.</i>

1362
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:14,706
<i>The entire boys' basketball team
at Richmond High School</i>

1363
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:16,249
<i>has been benched.</i>

1364
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,960
<i>The highly ranked Oilers have
a perfect season on the court,</i>

1365
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:21,588
<i>but some players were
in big trouble academically.</i>

1366
01:30:21,797 --> 01:30:25,676
<i>And in an unprecedented move,
Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,</i>

1367
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:29,304
<i>locked the gym and sent his players
straight to the library.</i>

1368
01:30:29,513 --> 01:30:30,681
<i>Now, at the start of the season,</i>

1369
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:33,475
<i>I understand you made all of
your players sign a contract</i>

1370
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:35,018
<i>before they could join the team.</i>

1371
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:37,270
<i>What exactly were the conditions
of that contract?</i>

1372
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:39,982
<i>The contract states that
the players must maintain</i>

1373
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,775
<i>a 2.3 grade point average</i>

1374
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:44,361
<i>and that the players must
attend all their classes</i>

1375
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:46,905
<i>and sit in the front row
of those classes.</i>

1376
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:50,200
<i>Well, Coach Carter, it's an
unusual strategy, and a risky one</i>

1377
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:52,285
<i>in a sense, in light of
your team's winning record,</i>

1378
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:55,622
<i>but I think there's gonna be a lot of
people out there pleased to learn</i>

1379
01:30:55,831 --> 01:30:59,459
<i>that at least somebody still cares
about the concept of a student athlete.</i>

1380
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:01,420
<i>Thanks a lot for joining us today.</i>

1381
01:31:07,676 --> 01:31:08,885
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1382
01:31:09,094 --> 01:31:12,014
I'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond
High School basketball team.

1383
01:31:12,222 --> 01:31:13,390
Oh, yeah.

1384
01:31:13,598 --> 01:31:15,225
I need to ask you a favor.

1385
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:18,603
<i>My team is studying in the library,
and I've been trying to tell them</i>

1386
01:31:18,812 --> 01:31:20,772
<i>that brains and beauty
are a perfect combination.</i>

1387
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:21,940
<i>Know what I'm saying?</i>

1388
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,859
I mean, I'm Worm, baby.

1389
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:25,986
How would you like
to watch the Worm work?

1390
01:31:26,194 --> 01:31:28,113
Hey, where did you get
that backpack?

1391
01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:29,406
Watch out, Too Short.

1392
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:35,078
Why study earth science
or history or algebra?

1393
01:31:35,912 --> 01:31:40,667
Getting good grades in those subjects,
combined with basketball skills,

1394
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:43,879
can get you into college.

1395
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:47,007
Girl, you should've bought it.
I would've worn it.

1396
01:31:56,475 --> 01:31:59,436
You selfish son of a bitch.
You snake.

1397
01:31:59,645 --> 01:32:01,938
- Miss...
- No, no, don't "miss" me, snake.

1398
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:03,607
Mr. Carter, you remember me?

1399
01:32:03,815 --> 01:32:06,610
Now, after all the things that my son
has been through for your team,

1400
01:32:06,818 --> 01:32:09,029
<i>for you to go lock up
this gym like this, how dare you...</i>

1401
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:27,214
Open up the damn gym!

1402
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:29,591
Let the boys play!

1403
01:32:34,596 --> 01:32:36,390
What's up, little cousin?

1404
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:38,517
How you doing?

1405
01:32:38,892 --> 01:32:39,977
Got something for me?

1406
01:32:41,937 --> 01:32:43,438
That's what I'm talking about.

1407
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:56,743
Hey, hey. Put it down, man.

1408
01:32:58,662 --> 01:33:00,247
- You Coach Carter, right?
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:02,874
- Yeah? Check this out, man.
- Hey, hold on, man.

1410
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,876
- Yeah. How you like that?
- Oh, hell no.

1411
01:33:05,085 --> 01:33:07,254
- What? What?
- You wanna get out the car?

1412
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:09,715
- Let's talk about this.
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

1413
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:11,925
Just open up the gym, man.
Let them boys play.

1414
01:33:14,428 --> 01:33:15,929
Trust me, you don't want me
out this car.

1415
01:33:16,138 --> 01:33:17,681
Yeah, see? Yeah.

1416
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:19,766
- Get on!
- Don't be no punk.

1417
01:33:19,975 --> 01:33:20,934
Say what you gotta say.

1418
01:33:21,143 --> 01:33:23,186
- Come on back, punk.
- Dad. Relax. Relax, let it go.

1419
01:33:23,395 --> 01:33:24,604
No, I ain't letting nothing go.

1420
01:33:24,813 --> 01:33:28,358
These people in Richmond...
Goddamn it!

1421
01:33:28,692 --> 01:33:29,651
- Relax, Dad.
- Damn it!

1422
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,779
Relax, relax. Chill out.
It's over. It's over. All right?

1423
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:35,198
He doesn't mean anything. It's over.

1424
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:36,616
Let it go.

1425
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:39,161
Come on, get back in the car.
Let's go.

1426
01:34:57,489 --> 01:34:59,866
I think you know who she is,
but she's got a friend.

1427
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:01,785
I mean, dog...
You gotta hook me up.

1428
01:35:01,994 --> 01:35:04,705
<i>Why I always gotta hook him up?
Sound like I'm the Love Connection.</i>

1429
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:06,790
Just start a conversation.
I'll take care of it.

1430
01:35:06,999 --> 01:35:08,709
- Yeah.
- Yes, girl.

1431
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:10,961
You don't remember me, do you?
But, see...

1432
01:35:11,169 --> 01:35:13,088
I was just ready to duff Duke out.

1433
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:15,757
- Some serious shit.
- You should have did it, man.

1434
01:35:15,924 --> 01:35:18,552
You talking all that shit, just do it.
Know what I'm saying?

1435
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,595
- You let somebody do that to you.
- I let him?

1436
01:35:20,804 --> 01:35:22,180
- Yo, Oscar, man.
- What?

1437
01:35:22,389 --> 01:35:23,724
Don't go nowhere. I'll be right out.

1438
01:35:23,932 --> 01:35:25,809
- I gotta talk to you.
- I already told you...

1439
01:35:26,018 --> 01:35:29,104
- No. You guys is kind of passing...
- I know I'm fine.

1440
01:35:29,313 --> 01:35:31,898
But I'm not feeling myself,
I'm feeling you.

1441
01:35:32,482 --> 01:35:35,777
Hey, I'm gonna holler at my boys
across the street for a quick minute.

1442
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:37,237
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

1443
01:35:37,446 --> 01:35:38,905
- All right.
- You know who we are, then?

1444
01:35:39,114 --> 01:35:41,199
- Here they go.
- What do we have here?

1445
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:43,618
- The Three Stooges from Richmond.
- Punk, punk, punk.

1446
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,245
- Larry, Co and Dummy.
- Bitches.

1447
01:35:45,454 --> 01:35:47,205
Dummy and dumb and dumber.
I mean, what the hell

1448
01:35:47,414 --> 01:35:50,792
is the bitchman from Richmond
doing on our side of the turf?

1449
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:53,503
You garbage.
I can't believe y'all won.

1450
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:54,921
- Shut up, woman.
- Don't be...

1451
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,299
I don't understand how y'all won.

1452
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:01,094
- Y'all wack-star niggas.
- Y'all wacked.

1453
01:36:01,303 --> 01:36:02,679
Wacked.

1454
01:36:02,929 --> 01:36:04,806
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.

1455
01:36:04,973 --> 01:36:07,809
- I don't wanna hear you talking shit.
- Homey, you a benchwarmer!

1456
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:11,438
Get the hell out my face, whitey!

1457
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:16,234
Let's do it, homey.
Let's do it, homey.

1458
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:18,111
- What you trying to do?
- He got a piece, man.

1459
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:21,698
You feel me right now, huh?
You feel me right now?

1460
01:36:21,948 --> 01:36:24,660
- Y'all brought a gun.
- Pinole homey. Feel me?

1461
01:36:24,868 --> 01:36:27,162
Keep it up the block, homey.
I'm right here, homey.

1462
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:29,539
I'm right here. Right here.

1463
01:36:29,748 --> 01:36:31,625
It's all good. Y'all brought a gun!

1464
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:33,210
Pinole!

1465
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,295
Bitch-ass...

1466
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:37,464
Pinole, right?

1467
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:41,134
- Are they serious?
- I'll knock his braids out.

1468
01:36:41,718 --> 01:36:44,346
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.

1469
01:36:45,097 --> 01:36:46,848
- Know what I'm saying?
- Appreciate the backup.

1470
01:36:47,057 --> 01:36:48,475
Word.

1471
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,311
I'm gonna see y'all later, all right?

1472
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,980
- All right, homey.
- Good looking.

1473
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:54,564
No doubt.

1474
01:36:55,232 --> 01:36:56,817
- I'm gonna check y'all.
- You got this.

1475
01:36:59,027 --> 01:37:01,238
This is my paper, man.
I'm not playing with you.

1476
01:37:01,446 --> 01:37:03,365
Then why don't you stop
getting in my face.

1477
01:37:07,452 --> 01:37:08,912
Renny!

1478
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:19,881
Renny!

1479
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:28,974
I can't believe...
He was just standing there.

1480
01:37:29,182 --> 01:37:30,892
- Renny!
- Oh, shit.

1481
01:37:31,101 --> 01:37:33,562
- Come on. Help me. Call 911.
- Call 911, man.

1482
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:35,439
Yo, I need a phone.
I need something...

1483
01:37:35,647 --> 01:37:38,400
I just need you
to stay with me, okay?

1484
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:43,530
Hold his head up.

1485
01:37:49,494 --> 01:37:51,913
Somebody help me!

1486
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:17,397
- Cruz?
- I wanna come back, coach.

1487
01:38:17,606 --> 01:38:20,567
- What's going on?
- I wanna come back on the team.

1488
01:38:22,653 --> 01:38:24,154
What the hell happened?

1489
01:38:25,822 --> 01:38:27,574
They shot him.

1490
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:30,911
Renny. They shot Renny.

1491
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:33,080
I mean, we was just there.

1492
01:38:33,288 --> 01:38:35,582
We was just there.
Everything was good.

1493
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,918
- Come inside. Come on.
- Everything was good, coach.

1494
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:40,962
I mean, you know...

1495
01:38:41,171 --> 01:38:42,506
Come inside, son.

1496
01:38:42,714 --> 01:38:45,300
- Come on.
- You don't understand.

1497
01:38:45,509 --> 01:38:48,845
I wanna come back on the team.
What do I gotta do to play?

1498
01:38:49,054 --> 01:38:50,972
Don't worry about that, son.
Just come inside.

1499
01:38:57,562 --> 01:38:59,481
Whatever you want me to do,

1500
01:38:59,856 --> 01:39:01,316
I'll do it, okay?

1501
01:39:01,525 --> 01:39:02,734
Okay. Okay.

1502
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:05,445
Okay. I got you.

1503
01:39:05,654 --> 01:39:07,531
Come on. Come on,
you're back with us now.

1504
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:09,783
I can't believe they shot him.

1505
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:11,702
Just come inside now, all right?

1506
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:13,412
- Come on.
- I just wanna be on the team.

1507
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,579
Come on. Come on.

1508
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:17,499
Whatever you want me to do,

1509
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:20,210
I'll do it, okay?

1510
01:39:23,839 --> 01:39:26,258
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA

1511
01:39:26,466 --> 01:39:29,136
for participation
in extracurricular activities.

1512
01:39:29,344 --> 01:39:31,388
- Yes, ma'am.
- And according to your contract,

1513
01:39:31,596 --> 01:39:33,807
the players are agreeing
to maintain a 2.3?

1514
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,976
That, among other things.
Yes, ma'am.

1515
01:39:36,184 --> 01:39:38,478
- Other things like...?
- Attending all classes,

1516
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,230
sitting in the front row
of those classes,

1517
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:42,149
and wearing a tie on game day.

1518
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:44,985
I see. Mr. Carter,

1519
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:47,988
does the lockout include
practices and games?

1520
01:39:48,196 --> 01:39:50,282
And do you have
a set period of time?

1521
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:52,326
There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1522
01:39:54,786 --> 01:39:57,581
Please. Quiet, please.

1523
01:39:57,998 --> 01:40:00,083
That includes practices and games,

1524
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:02,544
until we as a team
reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1525
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:04,880
Please, quiet.

1526
01:40:05,464 --> 01:40:07,549
Please, quiet.

1527
01:40:07,758 --> 01:40:09,509
Quiet.

1528
01:40:10,052 --> 01:40:11,428
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1529
01:40:11,636 --> 01:40:15,640
In the interest of time, I'd like to open
this board meeting up for comments.

1530
01:40:15,849 --> 01:40:18,352
As a teacher, I was offended
when asked by a coach

1531
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,562
to provide progress reports.

1532
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:24,191
Nowhere in my contract does it say
that I have to do so.

1533
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:25,984
It creates more work.

1534
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:28,445
This lockout has brought
negative media attention

1535
01:40:28,654 --> 01:40:31,406
that questions our abilities
as educators.

1536
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:35,494
End this madness. End this lockout.

1537
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:39,539
I'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1538
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:40,916
That boy lives to play ball.

1539
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:43,168
Comes to school every day now.

1540
01:40:43,377 --> 01:40:45,712
You take away basketball,

1541
01:40:46,004 --> 01:40:48,382
God knows what he'd be into.

1542
01:40:49,174 --> 01:40:52,719
Yesterday, he canceled
the Fremont game.

1543
01:40:52,928 --> 01:40:55,222
Now, that's the biggest game
of the year.

1544
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:57,391
I have scouts coming
to watch my boy play.

1545
01:40:57,599 --> 01:41:00,727
- Me too.
- These boys are 16-0.

1546
01:41:00,936 --> 01:41:04,106
This whole school, this whole
community, is behind this team.

1547
01:41:07,776 --> 01:41:09,987
Everybody goes to every game.

1548
01:41:10,195 --> 01:41:12,614
Basketball is the only thing
that these boys have got.

1549
01:41:12,781 --> 01:41:15,951
Are we gonna let Carter come in here
and take that away from them?

1550
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,745
- No!
- I don't think so.

1551
01:41:18,954 --> 01:41:20,163
Not gonna happen.

1552
01:41:27,462 --> 01:41:30,257
- I'd like to make a motion.
- Yes, Mr. Walters?

1553
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:34,928
I move that we remove Mr. Carter
as head basketball coach.

1554
01:41:38,598 --> 01:41:41,268
Order, please. Order.

1555
01:41:41,476 --> 01:41:43,061
This board does not have
the authority

1556
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:45,313
to terminate employment
of a staff position.

1557
01:41:45,522 --> 01:41:49,860
Then I move we end the lockout
and let the kids play.

1558
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:52,696
I second the motion.

1559
01:41:52,904 --> 01:41:54,281
- Okay.
- If I may?

1560
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:55,782
Yes, Mr. Carter.

1561
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:58,035
You really need to consider
the message

1562
01:41:58,243 --> 01:41:59,870
that you're sending these boys.

1563
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:04,333
It's the same message that we
as a culture send to our pro athletes,

1564
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:07,127
which is that they are above the law.

1565
01:42:07,544 --> 01:42:10,922
Now, I'm trying to teach these boys
the discipline that will inform their lives

1566
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:12,799
and give them choices.

1567
01:42:13,133 --> 01:42:17,429
If you endorse the fact
that 15, 16 and 17-year-olds

1568
01:42:17,637 --> 01:42:21,141
don't have to honor the simple rules
of a basketball contract,

1569
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:24,478
how long do you think it'll be before
they're out there breaking laws?

1570
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:28,690
Now, I played basketball
at Richmond 30 years ago.

1571
01:42:28,899 --> 01:42:31,193
It was the same thing then.

1572
01:42:31,401 --> 01:42:33,779
Some of my teammates
ended up in prison.

1573
01:42:33,987 --> 01:42:36,239
Some of them ended up dead.

1574
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:39,368
I took this job because
I wanted to effect change

1575
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:41,036
in a special group of young men,

1576
01:42:41,244 --> 01:42:45,207
and this is the only way
I know how to do that.

1577
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,669
If you vote to end the lockout,

1578
01:42:48,877 --> 01:42:51,922
you won't have to terminate me.
I'll quit.

1579
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,548
Good.

1580
01:42:59,096 --> 01:43:01,431
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1581
01:43:03,558 --> 01:43:06,228
The board now recognizes
five voting members.

1582
01:43:06,436 --> 01:43:10,273
In this instance, we will be accepting
the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1583
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:14,444
Now, I put to those members
the vote on whether or not

1584
01:43:14,653 --> 01:43:16,446
to end the lockout.

1585
01:43:16,655 --> 01:43:18,740
All those in favor
of ending the lockout

1586
01:43:18,949 --> 01:43:22,035
will raise their right hand
when called upon.

1587
01:43:22,244 --> 01:43:26,581
I will vote first
by not raising my hand.

1588
01:43:27,249 --> 01:43:29,876
Principal Garrison?

1589
01:43:33,672 --> 01:43:36,258
Valerie Walker.

1590
01:43:37,592 --> 01:43:39,261
Benson Chiu.

1591
01:43:41,638 --> 01:43:43,390
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1592
01:43:45,642 --> 01:43:47,602
And Ms. Nyugen.

1593
01:43:47,811 --> 01:43:50,105
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1594
01:44:05,454 --> 01:44:08,165
The lockout ends with a vote
of 4 to 2.

1595
01:44:08,373 --> 01:44:11,626
If there's no other business,
this board meeting is adjourned.

1596
01:44:12,336 --> 01:44:13,795
Thank you all for coming.

1597
01:44:31,021 --> 01:44:33,106
Mr. Carter.

1598
01:44:33,315 --> 01:44:35,817
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1599
01:44:37,903 --> 01:44:40,155
Look, I know we haven't always seen
eye to eye,

1600
01:44:40,364 --> 01:44:43,116
but you've done such a great job with
these boys, it seems wrong to just...

1601
01:44:43,325 --> 01:44:47,204
Look. No offense, ma'am,
but all the work I did with those boys

1602
01:44:47,412 --> 01:44:49,122
was negated when they ended
the lockout.

1603
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:50,999
I don't think that's true, I...

1604
01:44:51,166 --> 01:44:53,126
The board sent the message
loud and clear.

1605
01:44:53,335 --> 01:44:55,087
Winning basketball games
is more important

1606
01:44:55,295 --> 01:44:57,798
than graduating from high school
and going to college.

1607
01:44:58,006 --> 01:45:01,760
I'm sorry, I just can't support
that message.

1608
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:54,813
Sir, they can cut the chain off the
door, but they can't make us play.

1609
01:45:57,024 --> 01:46:01,028
We've decided we're gonna finish
what you started, sir.

1610
01:46:01,945 --> 01:46:03,739
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.

1611
01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:05,615
We got shit to do, sir.

1612
01:46:19,296 --> 01:46:21,757
Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

1613
01:46:21,923 --> 01:46:24,926
Our deepest fear is that
we are powerful beyond measure.

1614
01:46:25,886 --> 01:46:29,264
It is our light, not our darkness
that most frightens us.

1615
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:31,558
Your playing small
does not serve the world.

1616
01:46:31,767 --> 01:46:33,393
There is nothing enlightened
about shrinking

1617
01:46:33,602 --> 01:46:36,313
so that other people
won't feel insecure around you.

1618
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:40,317
We were all meant to shine,
as children do.

1619
01:46:40,525 --> 01:46:43,487
It's not just in some of us,
it's in everyone.

1620
01:46:43,945 --> 01:46:45,947
And as we let our own light shine,

1621
01:46:46,156 --> 01:46:48,950
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.

1622
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:52,454
As we are liberated
from our own fear,

1623
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:55,499
our presence automatically
liberates others.

1624
01:47:01,922 --> 01:47:04,299
Sir, I just wanna say thank you.

1625
01:47:06,677 --> 01:47:08,470
You saved my life.

1626
01:47:17,354 --> 01:47:19,773
Thank you, sirs.

1627
01:47:22,317 --> 01:47:24,528
All of you.

1628
01:48:06,862 --> 01:48:10,323
Academic-progress reports,
young men.

1629
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:13,327
These things are...

1630
01:48:13,785 --> 01:48:15,996
...unbelievable.

1631
01:48:16,496 --> 01:48:19,249
I know you've been trying.

1632
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:24,838
I guess there's only one way
to say this.

1633
01:48:26,256 --> 01:48:28,508
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal.
Let's play ball.

1634
01:48:34,056 --> 01:48:36,308
<i>♪ Rich what? Richmond! ♪</i>

1635
01:48:36,516 --> 01:48:38,894
<i>♪ Rich what? Richmond! ♪</i>

1636
01:48:39,102 --> 01:48:41,104
<i>♪ Rich what? Richmond! ♪</i>

1637
01:49:08,256 --> 01:49:09,925
Hustle back. Get back, get back.

1638
01:49:11,593 --> 01:49:13,470
Set it, Worm. Set it.

1639
01:49:14,012 --> 01:49:15,931
Watch baseline.

1640
01:49:16,098 --> 01:49:18,392
- Take it.
- Take it, come on.

1641
01:49:21,019 --> 01:49:23,438
- Yes!
- Find a man. Find a man.

1642
01:49:26,858 --> 01:49:28,777
Swing it, swing it.

1643
01:49:29,361 --> 01:49:31,405
Go, go, go.

1644
01:49:33,949 --> 01:49:35,992
Go, go.

1645
01:49:36,201 --> 01:49:37,619
Come on!

1646
01:49:47,671 --> 01:49:48,922
Go Richmond!

1647
01:49:49,423 --> 01:49:51,299
Hold the ball, hold the ball!

1648
01:49:54,136 --> 01:49:57,639
<i>Nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

1649
01:49:57,848 --> 01:50:01,935
<i>five, four, three, two, one,</i>

1650
01:50:02,144 --> 01:50:03,437
<i>see you!</i>

1651
01:50:10,986 --> 01:50:13,196
- Great game, coach.
- Good game.

1652
01:50:17,159 --> 01:50:20,454
<i>Richmond returns from their lockout
and keeps their streak alive</i>

1653
01:50:20,662 --> 01:50:21,955
<i>at 17 games.</i>

1654
01:50:22,164 --> 01:50:26,460
<i>A team that won only four games
last year is now a Cinderella team</i>

1655
01:50:26,668 --> 01:50:28,837
<i>that has to be thinking
that there's a chance</i>

1656
01:50:29,046 --> 01:50:31,631
<i>of getting the phone call
to come to the dance.</i>

1657
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,092
<i>Is Richmond headed
for the state tournament?</i>

1658
01:50:46,605 --> 01:50:49,232
So, what else y'all gonna do
at the park when you go?

1659
01:50:49,441 --> 01:50:51,443
- Seesaw.
- Seesaw?

1660
01:50:51,651 --> 01:50:53,236
- You're gonna seesaw?
- Yeah.

1661
01:50:53,445 --> 01:50:56,073
- Who's gonna push you?
- My mommy's gonna push me.

1662
01:50:56,281 --> 01:50:58,367
Yeah?

1663
01:50:58,575 --> 01:51:00,911
That's good.
I wish I could go with you.

1664
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:04,039
- Come on, baby.
- But I'll see you later, okay?

1665
01:51:04,206 --> 01:51:06,333
- Bye.
- Bye.

1666
01:51:12,005 --> 01:51:13,173
How you been?

1667
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:17,010
Good.

1668
01:51:17,636 --> 01:51:19,763
You look good.

1669
01:51:19,971 --> 01:51:22,933
Thank you. So do you.

1670
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:25,185
Considering.

1671
01:51:29,648 --> 01:51:33,568
You know, everything's been crazy,
with the lockout.

1672
01:51:33,777 --> 01:51:35,237
Yeah, it'll be all right.

1673
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:38,031
For sure.

1674
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,117
Can we sit down somewhere?

1675
01:52:00,137 --> 01:52:03,765
I've been trying to get my head
straight about things.

1676
01:52:03,974 --> 01:52:06,560
A lot of things. Especially us.

1677
01:52:06,768 --> 01:52:09,438
- Kenny, I...
- Kyra, just listen.

1678
01:52:10,355 --> 01:52:12,399
Please.

1679
01:52:13,859 --> 01:52:19,031
For a long time, it's just been
my moms, my boys and you.

1680
01:52:19,239 --> 01:52:20,782
And that's what I counted on.

1681
01:52:21,158 --> 01:52:24,745
I'm trying to count on myself now,
and I'm all right and shit,

1682
01:52:24,953 --> 01:52:29,291
it's just, without you,
nothing good feels as good.

1683
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:34,338
It's like I'm missing
some happy part of me.

1684
01:52:45,724 --> 01:52:47,559
I got you something.

1685
01:52:49,519 --> 01:52:51,271
And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.

1686
01:52:53,398 --> 01:52:55,609
Shut up.

1687
01:52:59,363 --> 01:53:01,573
- They gave you a scholarship?
- Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1688
01:53:01,782 --> 01:53:06,453
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1689
01:53:06,661 --> 01:53:08,872
Oh, my gosh.

1690
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:10,832
I know you gonna kill it up there.

1691
01:53:11,041 --> 01:53:13,502
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1692
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:16,129
I told them about you and the baby.
They wanna help us.

1693
01:53:28,558 --> 01:53:30,143
Kenyon...

1694
01:53:31,103 --> 01:53:33,146
...there is no more baby.

1695
01:53:36,983 --> 01:53:40,153
I decided not to go through with it.

1696
01:53:41,196 --> 01:53:43,323
Kyra.

1697
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:46,660
I had a choice to make,

1698
01:53:46,868 --> 01:53:49,329
so I made it.

1699
01:53:49,538 --> 01:53:51,957
For me, Kenny.

1700
01:53:54,418 --> 01:53:57,796
Well, when?

1701
01:53:58,005 --> 01:54:01,508
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have gone with you.

1702
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:08,015
I'm so sorry.

1703
01:54:09,224 --> 01:54:12,352
Kyra, I'm so sorry you had to
go through that by yourself.

1704
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:17,524
My mom went with me.

1705
01:54:19,276 --> 01:54:20,902
But I think that...

1706
01:54:21,111 --> 01:54:26,825
I think you should go to school
and play ball and do your thing.

1707
01:54:27,034 --> 01:54:28,618
You know?

1708
01:54:28,827 --> 01:54:32,289
I want that for you. And that's real.

1709
01:54:33,123 --> 01:54:35,417
I think you should be all you can.

1710
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:39,880
I want you to come with me.

1711
01:54:42,716 --> 01:54:44,551
Kyra, I love you.

1712
01:54:45,177 --> 01:54:46,887
I want you to come with me.

1713
01:54:48,096 --> 01:54:50,307
- You serious?
- I'm serious.

1714
01:54:51,099 --> 01:54:53,393
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

1715
01:54:53,602 --> 01:54:55,812
I love you too.

1716
01:55:03,779 --> 01:55:05,030
Ken Carter.

1717
01:55:07,115 --> 01:55:09,409
I understand, sir.

1718
01:55:10,243 --> 01:55:12,245
All right. Thank you, sir.

1719
01:55:21,046 --> 01:55:22,547
We're in.

1720
01:55:24,299 --> 01:55:25,926
That's what I'm talking about.

1721
01:55:32,474 --> 01:55:35,435
Guys, guys, guys. Now, listen.

1722
01:55:35,644 --> 01:55:37,938
It's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be a long road.

1723
01:55:38,647 --> 01:55:41,692
- We're a really low seed.
- Who did we get, coach?

1724
01:55:43,527 --> 01:55:45,112
St. Francis.

1725
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:46,822
St. Francis?

1726
01:55:47,030 --> 01:55:50,200
Coach, they ranked number one
in the state.

1727
01:55:51,493 --> 01:55:54,496
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don't worry
about Ty Crane, dog. You'll get him.

1728
01:55:54,955 --> 01:55:58,333
We got this. That's all right, baby.
One game at a time. We got this.

1729
01:55:58,542 --> 01:56:00,460
- All right, guys.
- It's on.

1730
01:56:09,469 --> 01:56:12,639
- Bring your A game, young man.
- Yes, sir.

1731
01:56:44,046 --> 01:56:48,050
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the first round of the CIF playoffs.</i>

1732
01:56:48,258 --> 01:56:51,720
<i>St. Francis is one of the best
high school teams in the nation,</i>

1733
01:56:51,887 --> 01:56:53,764
<i>with Ty Crane
believed to be a shoo-in</i>

1734
01:56:53,972 --> 01:56:56,683
<i>for the top NBA draft pick next year.</i>

1735
01:56:56,892 --> 01:56:59,353
<i>On the other side of the court
is Richmond,</i>

1736
01:56:59,561 --> 01:57:01,855
<i>a team that's had
a media-worthy season as well.</i>

1737
01:57:02,314 --> 01:57:05,233
<i>Richmond High has never played
in a state tournament.</i>

1738
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:08,737
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1739
01:57:13,825 --> 01:57:15,869
- Settle down, settle down.
- 1-4!

1740
01:57:19,414 --> 01:57:20,874
Ball, ball.

1741
01:57:21,083 --> 01:57:22,709
Move, move.

1742
01:57:27,339 --> 01:57:29,049
Good shot, baby.

1743
01:57:30,509 --> 01:57:33,053
- Get back, get back.
- Run motion. Run motion.

1744
01:57:33,261 --> 01:57:34,888
Motion 44.

1745
01:57:39,142 --> 01:57:40,644
Right here, right here. Swing it.

1746
01:57:43,397 --> 01:57:45,148
Force him left. Force him left.

1747
01:57:50,946 --> 01:57:54,408
You gotta force him left.
The baseline's another defender.

1748
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:58,829
D up!

1749
01:58:03,834 --> 01:58:05,794
Better get somebody else to hold me.
I'm dropping 50.

1750
01:58:08,171 --> 01:58:09,506
Set up!

1751
01:58:13,802 --> 01:58:16,471
Come on. Get on him, get on him.

1752
01:58:17,264 --> 01:58:19,725
Get over here and help.
He shouldn't be scoring.

1753
01:58:19,975 --> 01:58:21,601
Get back, get back. Bring it in.

1754
01:58:23,311 --> 01:58:25,564
Get back, get back.
Find your man, find your man.

1755
01:58:25,772 --> 01:58:27,774
Now, watch out. Watch that trap.

1756
01:58:27,983 --> 01:58:31,445
Watch the trap. Motion. Motion.
That's the one.

1757
01:58:33,155 --> 01:58:35,449
That's it. Yes! Yes!

1758
01:58:35,657 --> 01:58:39,202
<i>S-C-O-R-E! Score! Score!</i>

1759
01:58:41,872 --> 01:58:43,665
Ball, ball. Ball, man!

1760
01:58:50,505 --> 01:58:53,300
Lyle, stop the ball.
Less talk out there.

1761
01:59:03,518 --> 01:59:07,647
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, Richmond!

1762
01:59:07,856 --> 01:59:10,525
You gotta help Junior
on the weak-side pick.

1763
01:59:15,155 --> 01:59:19,368
<i>- Delilah! Delilah!
♪ - Defense! Defense! ♪</i>

1764
01:59:19,576 --> 01:59:21,828
<i>♪ - Defense! Defense! ♪
- Delilah! Delilah!</i>

1765
01:59:22,037 --> 01:59:23,497
Delilah! Delilah!

1766
01:59:25,165 --> 01:59:27,751
- Get there, get there.
- Trap, trap, trap. Left side, left side.

1767
01:59:40,305 --> 01:59:43,433
- Use the pick, use the pick.
- I got it.

1768
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:49,272
- Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
- Foul, number three.

1769
01:59:49,481 --> 01:59:50,524
- Hold up.
- Number three.

1770
01:59:50,732 --> 01:59:53,527
- Mustangs, bring it in. Bring it in.
- Count the basket.

1771
01:59:53,735 --> 01:59:56,029
- Damn.
- Timeout, sir. Time.

1772
01:59:56,238 --> 01:59:58,949
Come here, come here. Damn it.

1773
02:00:00,909 --> 02:00:03,245
Come on, guys,
keep up the defense!

1774
02:00:03,453 --> 02:00:05,956
Come on, what you gonna do?

1775
02:00:06,373 --> 02:00:09,042
We still in this game.
Come on, fellas.

1776
02:00:09,876 --> 02:00:13,213
Gentlemen, you told me
you deserved to be here.

1777
02:00:13,422 --> 02:00:14,965
Well, you're not playing like it.

1778
02:00:15,173 --> 02:00:18,051
All season long,
we played our game.

1779
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:20,637
Right now, you're playing theirs.

1780
02:00:20,846 --> 02:00:24,766
When we step on the floor,
every second that clock is ticking,

1781
02:00:24,933 --> 02:00:26,977
we are pedal to the metal.

1782
02:00:27,185 --> 02:00:29,688
We run the ball.
We pressure the ball.

1783
02:00:29,938 --> 02:00:35,235
And most importantly,
we control the tempo of the game!

1784
02:00:35,444 --> 02:00:40,073
We make them play
Richmond Oiler ball.

1785
02:00:40,282 --> 02:00:42,242
Worm, you can take this kid.

1786
02:00:42,451 --> 02:00:43,994
Force him left,
and when he crosses over,

1787
02:00:44,202 --> 02:00:47,205
you jump him.
Damien, push the tempo.

1788
02:00:47,456 --> 02:00:49,750
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.

1789
02:00:49,958 --> 02:00:53,503
Cruz, when you're in the game in
transition, take that jumper you love.

1790
02:00:53,962 --> 02:00:56,423
Junior, just keep doing
what you're doing.

1791
02:00:56,631 --> 02:00:58,467
Hold on to that monster.

1792
02:00:58,675 --> 02:01:02,054
You do those things, gentlemen,
and I guarantee you,

1793
02:01:02,262 --> 02:01:06,141
at the end of the game,
we will be there.

1794
02:01:08,643 --> 02:01:10,771
All right, hands in.

1795
02:01:10,979 --> 02:01:13,607
- Game time.
- All right, take control of this game.

1796
02:01:13,815 --> 02:01:14,983
Who's gonna win this game?

1797
02:01:15,192 --> 02:01:18,737
One, two, three, Richmond!
Let's go. Let's do this.

1798
02:01:22,657 --> 02:01:25,160
One, two, three, Mustangs!

1799
02:01:32,876 --> 02:01:35,295
- Get up, get up.
- Go, go, go.

1800
02:01:43,345 --> 02:01:44,471
Yes.

1801
02:01:48,225 --> 02:01:50,602
- Reach-in foul.
- That's the only damn one.

1802
02:01:50,811 --> 02:01:54,272
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?
- Good call, ref.

1803
02:01:54,523 --> 02:01:56,983
Cruz. In for Kenyon.

1804
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:03,281
- Ball, ball, ball, ball.
- Run it, run it, run it.

1805
02:02:17,254 --> 02:02:19,423
Get back, get back!
Everybody get back.

1806
02:02:19,965 --> 02:02:21,675
Yeah! Come on!

1807
02:02:41,862 --> 02:02:43,572
Get back, get back, get back.

1808
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,624
Ref, you gotta call that.
This is my house.

1809
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:56,877
- Push, push.
- Can we get a call?

1810
02:03:05,427 --> 02:03:08,221
Take care of the ball, man.
I'm gonna catch my breath.

1811
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:18,732
Come on. Get back, get back.

1812
02:03:23,737 --> 02:03:25,405
Swing it right here. I got it.

1813
02:03:29,826 --> 02:03:31,244
Charge.

1814
02:03:33,288 --> 02:03:35,582
- Go get them, boys.
- Yeah, baby.

1815
02:03:35,791 --> 02:03:38,710
Charge, number 30. Red ball.

1816
02:03:38,919 --> 02:03:41,129
Come on, ref,
you wasn't even there.

1817
02:03:46,635 --> 02:03:49,805
- Red ball, red ball. Red, red, red.
- Yes. Yes.

1818
02:03:50,013 --> 02:03:51,306
- Richmond's ball.
- What?

1819
02:03:51,515 --> 02:03:53,892
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1820
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:02,901
- Red ball.
- Junior, good block!

1821
02:04:03,777 --> 02:04:06,238
- I know that's a foul.
- It's all ball.

1822
02:04:06,446 --> 02:04:08,990
- What are you talking about?
- What's up, man?

1823
02:04:12,327 --> 02:04:14,287
Knock his bitch ass out.

1824
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:16,415
Calm down, man.
We're still in the game.

1825
02:04:16,832 --> 02:04:17,958
Come on.

1826
02:04:18,709 --> 02:04:20,210
- Ease back.
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

1827
02:04:23,255 --> 02:04:25,382
Get out of my way, man. Get off me.

1828
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,302
Let's go, let's go.

1829
02:04:29,511 --> 02:04:32,639
All right, baby, it's all us now.
It's all us. Let's go.

1830
02:04:41,857 --> 02:04:44,818
They're standing on the edge of a cliff.
All we gotta do is push them off.

1831
02:04:45,277 --> 02:04:46,319
We're gonna run Candy.

1832
02:04:46,528 --> 02:04:48,488
Worm, you gotta sell them
the pass to Damien.

1833
02:04:48,697 --> 02:04:51,491
Junior, we come to you
on the weak-side seal.

1834
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:53,827
But, gentlemen,
just because you deserve this

1835
02:04:54,036 --> 02:04:55,662
doesn't mean they're gonna
give it to you.

1836
02:04:55,871 --> 02:04:59,708
Sometimes you gotta take
what's yours. You ready to do this?

1837
02:04:59,916 --> 02:05:01,501
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

1838
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:04,087
- All right, hands in.
- Come on, take this.

1839
02:05:04,296 --> 02:05:06,423
Richmond on three.
One, two, three, Richmond!

1840
02:05:13,847 --> 02:05:16,391
- Careful of the foul, all right? Let's go.
- I got you. 1-4, 1-4!

1841
02:05:17,517 --> 02:05:20,187
- All right.

1842

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1843
02:05:25,067 --> 02:05:27,194
Candy! Candy!

1844
02:05:30,906 --> 02:05:32,908
Ball, Damien.

1845
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:40,374
- Move, move.
- Help, help.

1846
02:05:56,765 --> 02:05:58,850
Get back, get back, get back!

1847
02:06:03,313 --> 02:06:04,731
Junior, get back!

1848
02:06:15,617 --> 02:06:17,494
Hands up!

1849
02:06:31,633 --> 02:06:34,344
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about, baby. Yeah!

1850
02:07:26,355 --> 02:07:29,483
<i>♪ Mustangs! Mustangs! ♪</i>

1851
02:07:30,734 --> 02:07:34,196
Hold on, hold on. Let me down,
let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!

1852
02:07:36,865 --> 02:07:39,868
You're real, man.
I mean that. All right?

1853
02:07:40,702 --> 02:07:43,663
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

1854
02:07:56,385 --> 02:07:59,137
Well, not quite
your storybook ending, huh?

1855
02:07:59,346 --> 02:08:01,765
Not for us, anyway.

1856
02:08:03,558 --> 02:08:07,187
But you men played like champions.

1857
02:08:07,396 --> 02:08:09,022
You never gave up.

1858
02:08:09,856 --> 02:08:13,944
And champions
hold their heads high.

1859
02:08:14,152 --> 02:08:17,572
What you achieved goes way beyond
the win-loss column

1860
02:08:17,781 --> 02:08:19,574
or what's gonna be written
on the front page

1861
02:08:19,783 --> 02:08:22,327
of the sports section tomorrow.

1862
02:08:22,536 --> 02:08:24,329
You've achieved something
that some people

1863
02:08:24,538 --> 02:08:28,125
spend their whole lives trying to find.

1864
02:08:28,333 --> 02:08:34,297
What you achieved
is that ever-elusive victory within.

1865
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:37,342
And, gentlemen...

1866
02:08:38,218 --> 02:08:41,638
...I am so proud of you.

1867
02:08:44,933 --> 02:08:48,770
Four months ago, when I took
the job at Richmond, I had a plan.

1868
02:08:49,438 --> 02:08:51,940
That plan failed.

1869
02:08:52,107 --> 02:08:56,903
I came to coach basketball players,
and you became students.

1870
02:08:58,321 --> 02:09:00,741
I came to teach boys...

1871
02:09:01,283 --> 02:09:03,368
...and you became men.

1872
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:05,704
And for that, I thank you.

1873
02:09:09,624 --> 02:09:12,586
If someone walked in this door
right now

1874
02:09:12,794 --> 02:09:18,383
and offered me the coaching job
at any school in the state of California,

1875
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:21,344
you know which team I'd choose?

1876
02:09:21,553 --> 02:09:23,638
St. Francis?

1877
02:09:24,264 --> 02:09:26,475
I'm just saying, man.

1878
02:09:27,476 --> 02:09:29,519
Kenyon?

1879
02:09:33,315 --> 02:09:35,650
- Richmond?
- Rich what?

1880
02:09:36,818 --> 02:09:38,820
- Richmond.
- Rich what?

1881
02:09:38,987 --> 02:09:40,155
Richmond.

1882
02:09:40,364 --> 02:09:42,949
- Rich what?
- Richmond.

1883
02:09:43,158 --> 02:09:45,327
- Where we from?
- Richmond!

1884
02:09:45,535 --> 02:09:47,954
- What's my hometown?
- Richmond!

1885
02:09:48,163 --> 02:09:50,207
- What do we love?
- Richmond!

1886
02:09:50,415 --> 02:09:52,667
- Rich what?
- Richmond!
