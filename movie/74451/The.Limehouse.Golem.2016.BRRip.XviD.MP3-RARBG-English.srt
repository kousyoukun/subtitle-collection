1
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:56,785
Let us begin...

2
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:58,701
...my friends...

3
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:01,182
...at the end.

4
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:22,733
John?

5
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,209
John!

6
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:59,017
He left nothing?

7
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:04,484
No note? If he meant to poison himself,
why would he not at least leave a note?

8
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:08,905
I fear that the act of burning his papers
bears testament enough to his state of mind.

9
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,949
Mrs. Cree, forgive me...

10
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:15,922
...I know this is neither
the time nor the place but...

11
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,297
...may I say what an ardent
admirer I am of your work?

12
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,784
I looked in the kitchen, sir.

13
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:24,384
This was all I could find.

14
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:30,383
I'm afraid this'll be it. There was
residue in a glass on the nightstand.

15
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:32,350
It can't have been in there, sir.

16
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,117
His nightly cordial was always
prepared by Mrs. Cree.

17
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,718
Aveline.

18
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:41,517
You... did not make the drink?

19
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:46,317
Surely you're not asking me in earnest
if I poisoned my husband?

20
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:49,317
Sir, believe me, she cannot have done this!

21
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:51,803
The two of them were in a most
violent dispute yesterday!

22
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:54,850
Why would she prepare Mr. Cree a nightcap
when they were not on speaking terms?

23
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,591
Aveline, what has possessed you?

24
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,113
Sir, please, allow me to explain.

25
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:03,216
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cree.

26
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,416
You'll need to do that down at Scotland Yard.

27
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:16,651
A woman accused of poisoning her husband.

28
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,126
But not just any woman...

29
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:24,116
...little Lizzie...

30
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:27,884
...darling of the music halls.

31
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,783
But the city was in thrall...

32
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:36,685
...with the fearsome Limehouse Golem.

33
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:39,517
Who was he?

34
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:42,417
Who would be his next victim?

35
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:46,183
The Golem had last struck...

36
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:49,351
...the day before her arrest.

37
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,916
And his was the name...

38
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:56,034
...on every Londoner's lips.

39
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,917
How many are dead?

40
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,571
Five.

41
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:24,507
Shopkeeper Mr. Gerrard,
his wife Mary, their maid...

42
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,449
...and the two Gerrard children.

43
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,253
It's not number 29. 29 Ratcliffe Highway?

44
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,820
- What of it?
- The Ratcliffe highway murders?

45
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,407
- John Williams?
- It's a bit before my time.

46
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,562
And mine. It was 70 years ago.

47
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,487
Inspector Roberts! Can you confirm
that this is the work of the Golem?

48
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,454
- What is it about this house?
- Do you think it could be cursed, sir?

49
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,287
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

50
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:57,986
I'd ask you to direct
your requests to my colleague...

51
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:02,020
...Detective Inspector Kildare.
He's taking over the case.

52
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,953
Kildare? How are you spelling that?

53
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,353
Taking over?

54
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:09,076
I'm just stepping aside, not stepping down.

55
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,454
The public seeks reassurance, Kildare.

56
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:17,229
What better way than to give them new blood?

57
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:22,252
Are you fearful of stepping into
the shoes of the great Mr. Roberts?

58
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:25,752
How many more people have to die
before the Golem is caught?

59
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,415
Driver!

60
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,036
Detective Roberts!

61
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,220
Inspector Kildare, is it true
that this is your first murder case?

62
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,153
Inspector Kildare!

63
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,853
Move. Move back.

64
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,833
Do you know if they'll be displaying
the bodies today?

65
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:45,420
Step aside, sir.
The maid was found over there.

66
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,626
Were there footprints when you arrived?
The Golem's prints?

67
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:50,487
- Half of Limehouse was already here.
- Which of the victims was found there?

68
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,971
None. The Golem moved that one himself.
Either Mr. or Mrs. Gerrard.

69
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:57,020
More likely him. If the maid was killed
first, he'd investigate the disturbance.

70
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,287
- Where is her body now?
- We took her upstairs, sir.

71
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,460
At least up there we can
keep the hoi poloi out.

72
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,950
- Down here is a lost cause.
- They can't all be reporters.

73
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,619
No. Locals looking for entertainment.
Cheaper than a ticket to a shocker.

74
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,223
Sometimes I suspect if I was dispatched
to hell, I'd barely notice the change...

75
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:14,966
...bar the weather.
This is Inspector Kildare.

76
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:17,367
- Taking over from Roberts.
- Sir.

77
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:22,629
Can you tell this idiot to let me up?
I'm with the <i>Evening Post!</i>

78
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,595
This is the maid?

79
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:45,120
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,795
I've never seen anything of this kind.

81
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,561
Neither have I.

82
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,925
"He who observes...

83
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:40,153
...spills no less blood
than he who inflicts the blow."

84
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,120
Lactantius.

85
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,021
Impressive, sir.

86
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,887
The truth has a habit
of sticking in the mind.

87
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,639
Truth?

88
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:56,479
Those who fail to prevent injustice
are as guilty as the perpetrator.

89
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,248
It's a message...

90
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,262
...to us.

91
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:11,653
Evidence... John Cree case.

92
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,887
- The poisoning.
- You've had quite a week.

93
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,429
First the Limehouse Golem, now this.

94
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:24,287
I heard Inspector Kildare
was asking after you.

95
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:28,220
Yes. I don't know what he wanted.
I keep missing him.

96
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,720
Well, they did right giving him
the Golem case, I reckon.

97
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,987
He'd have risen well above Roberts by now
if those rumors hadn't done for him.

98
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,419
You know. That he wasn't the marrying kind...

99
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:44,669
...men.

100
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:49,602
It's before your time, I suppose.

101
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,339
Come in.

102
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:05,321
- I got your message, sir.
- I'm being assigned a constable.

103
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,620
I thought someone of your knowledge
of Limehouse might be an asset.

104
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,220
When I heard nothing back, I thought
perhaps the offer didn't appeal.

105
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,020
I came by twice, sir. You were out.

106
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,137
I was at Limehouse. Appealing for witnesses.

107
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:19,096
To no avail.

108
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:28,037
- What are you looking for?
- I'm just looking. Trying to understand.

109
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,970
The Golem's a madman.
What else is there to be understood?

110
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,603
Even madness has its own logic.
Here there's none.

111
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:37,170
At Ratcliffe Highway,
he slaughtered a household.

112
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,303
The previous week, a prostitute.
Alice Stanton. Before that, Solomon Weil.

113
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:44,246
He was an old man, a scholar.

114
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,536
Oh, my God.

115
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:51,304
- Is that his...
- Yes.

116
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,673
Laid upon the open pages
of a book on Jewish folklore...

117
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:56,754
...like a bookmark.

118
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:01,770
"The Legend of the Golem."
Is that how the press got the name?

119
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,973
- Our murderer obviously approved.
- And who were the first two?

120
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:08,403
Both women of the streets.
I do remember reading of that one.

121
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,338
- "Old Salty."
- Her name was Jane Quig.

122
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,903
The point is there's no story to any of them.

123
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:19,337
Men, women, young, old.
Jew and Christian. Rich and poor.

124
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,271
- Perhaps he just likes to kill.
- No.

125
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,536
I'll wager there's a tale being told.

126
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:29,627
If we can sink to his circle
of damnation to comprehend it.

127
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,663
If I may say, sir, seems you've been
wasted down in theft-and-fraud.

128
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:38,758
I'll be back there soon enough, if the Golem
strikes again. That seems to be the plan.

129
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,170
- What do you mean?
- The yard is setting me up as a scapegoat.

130
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,670
They'll not risk Roberts,
will they? I'm expendable.

131
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,793
They get to preserve the reputation
of their golden boy and the public...

132
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,870
- ...get blood.
- Well, as I said back in Limehouse...

133
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,503
...seems they never have their fill of that.

134
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,170
"He who spectates." He doesn't mean us.

135
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,503
He means the public. The public
want blood. The Golem provides it.

136
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,636
Yes! I'm sure that must be it, sir.

137
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:11,188
Are you? I'm not.

138
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,675
Do you feel like a walk... to the library?

139
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:29,439
That quotation. About the gladiatorial ring?

140
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,370
The guilt of the audience who seek bloodshed?
Well, perhaps you read it elsewhere.

141
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,670
It's quoted in an old piece
by the essayist Thomas de Quincey.

142
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,199
One I imagine might be of interest
to a man in your line of work.

143
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:41,245
- What's the piece?
- "On murder considered...

144
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:46,180
...as one of the fine arts." A satire about
the Ratcliffe Highway killings of 1811.

145
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:51,237
Should we talk with this de Quincey?

146
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:55,146
He has been dead for 20 years,
Flood, so it might be a bit...

147
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:06,830
What is it?

148
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:14,361
<i>Left to rot. To kill a whore.</i>

149
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,037
Who last borrowed this book?

150
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:43,703
This is a reading room, Inspector,
not a local library.

151
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:46,970
So nothing leaves the premises?
Do you keep an attendance record?

152
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,737
Of course, but there's no way of knowing
what anyone read or when they read it.

153
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,645
Who was here on September the 24th?

154
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:59,137
There were four men
in the reading room that day. Why?

155
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:02,370
It's the final entry in a diary someone
has kept in the pages of this book.

156
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,496
- Were you here yourself?
- I'm here every day.

157
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,553
Then I must ask you for
a sample of your handwriting.

158
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:10,096
I'll need the same from all the staff.
And those four names, please?

159
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,336
<i>The</i> Dan Leno?

160
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,436
And <i>the</i> Karl Marx and George Gissing.

161
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:17,900
If you're a follower
of philosophy and literature.

162
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,203
What do you know of John Cree?

163
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,637
Sir?

164
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:25,824
If he's the same John Cree I'm thinking of...

165
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,445
...I believe he's dead.

166
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:36,302
Place the diary in my files. Keep it safe.

167
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:40,369
Find out all you can about George Gissing,
Karl Marx, and Dan Leno.

168
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,202
- Where are you going?
- To investigate the dead man.

169
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,578
If he was the Golem,
London's troubles are over.

170
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:57,103
And you describe your husband
as being in a state of despair...

171
00:13:57,182 --> 00:14:00,503
...in the weeks leading to his death, yes?

172
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,352
My husband had spent several years
writing a play, Your Honor.

173
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:05,686
Entitled "Misery Junction."

174
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,970
It was not a success.

175
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,136
I believe he never recovered from that.

176
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,703
And yet he continued to pass
each day in the reading room...

177
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,136
...at the British museum,
reading and writing.

178
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,536
A change in mood and a change
in habit are two different things.

179
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:25,111
On the day of his death,
the librarian described your husband...

180
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:28,353
...as being in good spirits.

181
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:31,336
My husband was adept at presenting
a false face to the world, sir.

182
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:35,603
And that is something you would understand...

183
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:38,936
...is it not, Mrs. Cree?

184
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:40,837
Playing...

185
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,278
...a role?

186
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:47,403
I used to be a music hall performer,
if that's what you mean.

187
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,970
And what of the role you play
today before this court?

188
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,503
That of a respectable, educated lady.

189
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:58,370
You were born out of wedlock, were you not?

190
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,903
Yes, sir.

191
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:05,403
As a child, you stitched sailcloth...

192
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:10,520
...and passed much time with men.

193
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,119
I can assure you I was
a God-fearing child. An innocent.

194
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,803
<i>I was tasked by my mother
to deliver our sails to the docks.</i>

195
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,436
<i>Encountering men was not something
I could hope to avoid.</i>

196
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:26,136
- Here you go, good as new.
- Carry that all the way?

197
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,837
Look at your poor hands, Lizzie.

198
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,036
Me ma says I'm made
for the bloodtubs with these hands.

199
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:34,166
Don't you dare run off and join the theater.
These sails ain't gonna mend themselves.

200
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:37,930
I like the comics. Charlie's gonna
take me to see Dan Leno one day.

201
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,411
Aren't you, Charlie, when I'm older?

202
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,186
Dan Leno was never that blue.
Did Charlie teach you that?

203
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,736
Just don't let your ma hear it.
She'll kill ya.

204
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,857
What's it mean?

205
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:03,770
If you want, I'll show you.

206
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,348
Me mum will be wanting me home,
if you'll give me our pay.

207
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,279
Money's in my hut.

208
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,412
What took you so long?

209
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:35,814
Has a man laid hands on you?

210
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,503
You liar.

211
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,256
I fell.

212
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:42,238
Come here.

213
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:47,770
- What did I do wrong?
- Mother, no, please.

214
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,738
- Did I not teach you well enough?
- No, I beg you!

215
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:54,572
Come here.

216
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,036
You want me to go to heaven, don't you?

217
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,415
That place will keep you from heaven, Lizzie.

218
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:14,394
That is enough, Mrs. Cree!

219
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,078
Court is adjourned for lunch!

220
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,293
Anyone come by from <i>The Era</i> newspaper?
I'm expecting a package.

221
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:34,187
No package.

222
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,978
Just this.

223
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:44,816
John Cree.

224
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:52,682
No luck getting a sample of Cree's handwriting
from his old employers, I'm afraid, sir.

225
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,470
They don't keep reporters' submissions.

226
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,670
Had a more recent portrait, though.

227
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,369
And I've asked archives for all
the files on Gissing and Marx.

228
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:03,312
Very good. See if they have anything on Leno.

229
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,737
<i>September the 5th, 1880.</i>

230
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,202
<i>It was a fine bright evening...</i>

231
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:28,082
<i>...and I could feel a murder coming on.</i>

232
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:30,936
Since it was to be my first show...

233
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:34,670
...I decided by way of inspiration
to pay a visit to the site...

234
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,603
...of the immortal Ratcliffe Highway murders.

235
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:40,469
<i>More than half a century ago
on this sacred spot...</i>

236
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:43,536
<i>...an entire family
was dispatched into eternity...</i>

237
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,736
<i>...by a man named John Williams...</i>

238
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:50,486
<i>...a man Thomas de Quincey described
as an artist of exquisite skill.</i>

239
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:53,603
<i>And yet now the site
of his greatest work was defiled...</i>

240
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,202
<i>...by a seller of secondhand clothes.</i>

241
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:59,100
We're closed, I'm afraid, sir.

242
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:03,369
Oh, sorry. The door was open.

243
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:06,538
No matter. I'll be sure to return.

244
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:11,374
<i>But I was a beginner, an understudy.</i>

245
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:14,478
<i>Not yet ready for the great stage.</i>

246
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,936
<i>An artist must perfect his craft...</i>

247
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:34,269
<i>...and tonight I would start
with a small, private rehearsal.</i>

248
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,052
- Gin?
- Don't you think you've had enough?

249
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,102
I want you awake.

250
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:41,412
Or else you'll miss all the fun.

251
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:07,822
<i>I felt that she suspected my game from
the start and offered herself willingly...</i>

252
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:10,446
<i>...warm in the knowledge that
the world would soon be forced...</i>

253
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,679
<i>...to confront the plight of her kind.</i>

254
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,336
<i>I took out her eyes in case my image
had been imprinted upon them...</i>

255
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:28,302
<i>...and washed the blood from my hands
with the gin in her chamber pot.</i>

256
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,673
<i>My first performance...</i>

257
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:32,854
<i>...was complete.</i>

258
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:57,412
Mrs. Cree? I'm Inspector Kildare
of Scotland Yard.

259
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:01,061
I suppose you're here to chastise me
for my candor in court.

260
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:03,440
On the contrary, I applaud you for it.

261
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,636
It's all too easy to imagine that those
who have enjoyed success...

262
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:09,003
...have never known suffering.

263
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:12,503
Well, to quote the great
Dan Leno, "Here we are again."

264
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,470
I'm afraid I'm not a frequenter
of the music halls.

265
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,616
He portrays the suffering of women.
My gender becomes inured to injustice.

266
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:24,789
We expect it. Until we can
greet it merely with a shrug.

267
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:27,769
I understood he was a comic.

268
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,525
The line between comedy
and tragedy is a fine one.

269
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:34,562
You haven't told me why you're here.

270
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:42,122
I wish to put it to you that I know
why you might have had good reason...

271
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:45,403
- ...to poison your husband.
- Please, sir, I'm hoarse from repetition.

272
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,636
There will be no confession.
My plea has been made.

273
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,836
Mrs. Cree, I'm not assigned to your case.

274
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:55,503
I'm here because your husband
is a suspect in another matter.

275
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,441
What matter?

276
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:02,269
A journal has been found.

277
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:06,570
I'd like to compare the handwriting with his.
Might you have anything that he wrote?

278
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,540
- His papers...
- He burned them, yes.

279
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,236
Mrs. Cree, if your husband were
found to have committed murder...

280
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:16,256
...your claims of suicide gain weight.

281
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,069
- Do you understand? You could go free.
- Murder?

282
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:23,236
I'm investigating a series of deaths.
They're calling them the "Limehouse Golem...

283
00:22:23,316 --> 00:22:25,835
You can't honestly think my husband
capable of such things?

284
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:28,635
It's not my place to have an opinion.

285
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,769
I just follow the threads.

286
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,369
The newspaper said
it was your first murder case.

287
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:36,472
- That's a rotten kind of chance to be given.
- Excuse me?

288
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:41,603
I wanted to be a serious actress, you know.

289
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:45,744
Had my chance once, too.
They don't give you another.

290
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,836
That's why I'd like to help you.

291
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:56,103
- You needn't feign interest in me.
- There's nothing feigned about it.

292
00:22:56,982 --> 00:23:00,802
Raised in cruelty and yet
you stood tall and thrived.

293
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,437
That's...

294
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,678
...uncommon.

295
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:12,125
My mother did me
the great service of dying young.

296
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:18,375
I was raised in the music halls.

297
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:16,278
- You want to buy some sweets, miss?
- Hey, get out of here.

298
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,102
What?

299
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:31,278
- What a play.
- It was.

300
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:48,382
It's halfway over, love. Come back tomorrow.

301
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:54,386
All right. Go on in.
You can still catch Leno if you're quick.

302
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:56,345
God bless.

303
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:32,077
All right, there we go!

304
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:36,809
What fine manners.

305
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:40,602
Such fine manners!
I feel as if I'm at a tea party.

306
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:45,299
Please note the oxtail
in the jelly tonight is three pence.

307
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,936
- Now without any further ado...
- That's for later.

308
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,708
...may I introduce the man of the hour...

309
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:54,364
...Mr. Dan Leno!

310
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:05,145
Here we are again!

311
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:15,713
<i>I burnt both my hands while a-trying</i>

312
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:18,907
<i>To cook my old man's mutton broth</i>

313
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:23,598
<i>My fat, boss-eyed baby was crying</i>

314
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:29,647
<i>I believe she's a little bit off</i>

315
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:34,497
- Mummy!
- <i>The meat all got burnt to a cinder</i>

316
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:37,696
<i>Which made my old man very wild</i>

317
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:41,691
<i>Then he threw the whole lot
through the winder</i>

318
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:45,380
<i>And smashed me on the nose with the child</i>

319
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,440
<i>And the child began a-screaming</i>

320
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,580
<i>As it never screamed before</i>

321
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,284
<i>While my nose with claret was streaming</i>

322
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,438
<i>He tried to dislocate my jaw</i>

323
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:13,423
<i>He kicked me and punched me this morning</i>

324
00:27:13,503 --> 00:27:16,155
<i>And made my poor face such a fright</i>

325
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:19,911
<i>He blacked both my eyes without warning</i>

326
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:25,317
<i>But I'm waiting for him tonight</i>

327
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:29,690
<i>He kicked me and punched me this morning</i>

328
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,899
<i>And made my poor face such a fright</i>

329
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:36,452
<i>He blacked both my eyes without warning</i>

330
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:42,233
<i>But I'm waiting for him tonight</i>

331
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:51,378
More!

332
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:02,101
Pies, pies, pies, pies.
All in dire need of pies.

333
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,936
I'll tell you what, dearie. Seeing
as you're here again, be a good girl.

334
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,922
Give Uncle a hand.

335
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:09,418
Be careful with that. All too good to drop.

336
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:11,944
As the pregnant woman said to the midwife!

337
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:18,197
Here you are, Vic. A little bit
of what you fancy. John John.

338
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:23,169
Aveline, dear, nice and hot,
just as you like it.

339
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,320
But not quite so big.

340
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:29,277
Thanks, Uncle.

341
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:45,301
Last one's for you, Mr. Leno.

342
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:47,401
Mr. Leno, is it?

343
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:52,301
Did you find her at the grocers, Uncle?
She's certainly a green one.

344
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:54,388
Now, now, girls.

345
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:59,035
- What's your name?
- Lizzie, sir.

346
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:00,969
Lambeth Marsh Lizzie.

347
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:03,695
I thought I could smell marsh gas.

348
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,836
Don't let 'em dumb you.
It's just their way. And call me Dan.

349
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:13,069
This is Tommy Farr, theater manager
and keeper of the Bunce.

350
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:16,211
Speaking of which, we owe you
something for your trouble.

351
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:24,452
What in God's name did they have you
doing down there in those marshes?

352
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:28,335
Digging graves.

353
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:32,063
Five years it was before I found out
you're supposed to use a shovel.

354
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:35,602
I like this one. Can you read?

355
00:29:35,682 --> 00:29:38,544
- Like a native.
- Here.

356
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:48,135
"What's fame?
A fancy'd life in other's breath.

357
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:51,169
A thing beyond us, even before our death.

358
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:56,736
All we feel of it begins and ends in
the small circle of our foes and friends."

359
00:29:57,415 --> 00:29:59,342
That's my favorite line.

360
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:01,603
Alexander Pope.

361
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,369
- Are you looking for work, Lizzie?
- Yeah.

362
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:09,935
Only, our prompter ran off with a lion
comique. And it won't all be lavender.

363
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:12,368
There'll be some fetch and carry,
but there's decent Bunce...

364
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:14,460
...and room in the digs with the dancers.

365
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,103
What do you say?

366
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:25,368
How would you describe
your relationship with Dan Leno?

367
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,401
We were friends, sir.

368
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:31,126
And he was my mentor.
He took me under his wing.

369
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,244
"No, Mrs. Killian"...

370
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:39,702
Where did you learn to read
and write if you didn't go to school?

371
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:43,591
My mother's Bible, I suppose.

372
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:47,392
Oh, and speaking of books...

373
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:51,298
- Oi. Thank you.
- What?

374
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:55,210
Finished already?
That's the second this week.

375
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,635
I think books might be my first love.

376
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:03,136
And I've always heard it said
that first love is insatiable.

377
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:08,725
Sod writing new gags, they can have
the milkmaid again tonight and like it.

378
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:10,743
I want to show you something.

379
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:14,417
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

380
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,969
A whole room?

381
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,101
Full of books?

382
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,677
Every inch of it.

383
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:28,635
People come here just to read?

384
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:32,335
To read. To learn. To create.

385
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:35,535
It's like... a great furnace.

386
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:38,902
I mean, the future is being forged here.

387
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,962
Writers, philosophers, men of science.

388
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:45,969
All the way down to lowly clowns like me.

389
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,169
The ladies' table is upstairs.

390
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:52,368
Thanking you kindly, good sir.

391
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:54,802
You were never more than friends?

392
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:58,386
No, sir. I believe he felt protective of me.

393
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:04,368
The prosecution wishes to remind the court
that Mr. Leno was recently questioned...

394
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:08,168
...in connection with
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

395
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:09,964
Objection, Your Honor!

396
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,264
Order, order!

397
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:17,635
Inspector Kildare!

398
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:19,344
Kildare!

399
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:32,802
Why was I not aware
that Dan Leno was previously a suspect?

400
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:36,438
You tell me, Kildare.
It was in every daily newspaper.

401
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:39,135
But not in the brief you gave me.

402
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:43,002
Well, he was eliminated from inquiries.
The report's on my desk somewhere.

403
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:45,903
You didn't think to place it in your files?

404
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:49,581
The streets of London run red with blood...

405
00:32:49,661 --> 00:32:52,142
...and you concern yourself with paperwork?

406
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:56,535
You'd have made a fine politician, Kildare...

407
00:32:56,615 --> 00:32:58,783
...were you not the topic of such...

408
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:01,244
...speculation.

409
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:10,501
I wouldn't read that.
Disgraceful lies, all of it.

410
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:14,605
The poor woman spoke of misfortune and
cruelty and they've turned it upon her.

411
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,864
Makes my blood boil.

412
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,268
Seems your beloved Leno
wasn't actually a suspect.

413
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:24,355
My beloved? What man doesn't enjoy Dan Leno?

414
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,669
One who doesn't care for the music halls?

415
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,301
Well, I'll venture to say
you've not seen the right shows, sir.

416
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:32,168
If you ever wish for a recommendation...

417
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:36,418
He was questioned in regard
to Alice Stanton's gown.

418
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:39,735
A label sewn into it identified it as his...

419
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:42,235
- ...a stage costume.
- So he knew her?

420
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:45,902
"Leno stated that the dress was part
of a consignment of stage costumes...

421
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:48,825
...he'd sold a year earlier to
a purveyor of secondhand clothes."

422
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:52,068
- And he provided a receipt which proved it.
- Then it was merely a coincidence.

423
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:53,519
Perhaps.

424
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:58,901
As is perhaps the fact that
the purveyor of secondhand clothes...

425
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,529
...was the late Mr. Gerrard...

426
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:04,702
- ...murdered at Ratcliffe Highway.
- We should get a sample of his hand.

427
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:07,301
Quite. And can we find out
what's happened to that dress?

428
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:10,374
- It wasn't with the rest of the evidence.
- I'll look into it, sir.

429
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,968
Why didn't you tell me
you questioned Dan Leno?

430
00:34:23,048 --> 00:34:25,835
- I haven't. Though I shall have to.
- In court they said you had.

431
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:28,802
Not me. Before I joined the case.

432
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,269
So is he a suspect or not?

433
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:35,968
- Do you think he should be?
- Please don't play games with me.

434
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:39,565
I have no desire to.
The Golem is still at large.

435
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,877
Wasting my time could cost lives.

436
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:49,866
Unless you are correct about my husband.

437
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:52,744
If the Golem is no more,
then none are at risk.

438
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:56,985
Besides yours...

439
00:34:57,065 --> 00:35:00,145
...you needn't hang, Mrs. Cree.

440
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,315
Please call me Lizzie.

441
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:09,968
- Just assist me in assisting you.
- I can't tell you what I don't know.

442
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:13,354
All I ask is that you tell me what you do.

443
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,301
Where should I start?

444
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:21,611
How you came to know John Cree, perhaps.

445
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:27,201
<i>Jim is very partial to me!
Though never a word has he said.</i>

446
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:31,041
Right now he's lodging with Mrs. Kelly.
Do you know Mrs. Kelly?

447
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:35,068
Don't you know Mrs. Kelly?
Good life-a-mighty, don't look so simple.

448
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:37,401
<i>Everybody</i> knows Mrs. Kelly.

449
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:40,035
- Am I going too fast for you, love?
- You spoof it, I'll write it.

450
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:43,035
She's a mean one, Mrs. Kelly.
She'll buy half a dozen oysters...

451
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:46,401
...and eat them in front of a mirror
to make them look like a dozen.

452
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:48,335
What about...

453
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:52,569
"I saw her take a coin from her purse
the other day, and I swear...

454
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:56,077
...I saw Queen Victoria blinking
at the sight of sunlight"?

455
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:00,531
Are those petticoats ironed yet?

456
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:05,045
Good. Then you can come
over here and lace me up.

457
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:12,769
- Fuck off, Victor.
- Come on, dear.

458
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:16,148
You know I can't see from the back row,
and I do so love a double act.

459
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:20,058
- Victor, out, out! Come on.
- Just a joke, Dan.

460
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:22,835
Get that, will you, Lizzie.

461
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:25,344
That'll be the reporter for my interview.

462
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,101
- You're new.
- Lizzie. Seen you before, haven't I?

463
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,702
- You work for <i>the Era.</i>
- I'm a playwright, but yes, indeed...

464
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:38,583
<i>...the Era</i> puts food on my table. For now.

465
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:41,968
John Cree.

466
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:43,969
You got to sweep it.

467
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:47,649
- Shall we?
- Can you help me dress, love?

468
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,544
Threw me out the window.

469
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:55,935
- The usual for everyone?
- Oh, yes, please, darling.

470
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:58,255
- What about you, dear?
- A baked potato.

471
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:02,235
You don't fancy a bit of meat tonight,
Lizzie? What's the matter, Dan?

472
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:04,669
- She must be over 16.
- No, I mustn't.

473
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:08,468
So, Lizzie, what's your act? Do tell.

474
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:12,002
It's called "Little Lizzie the Dogsbody."

475
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:16,068
Yeah, I do all manner of gags
with an iron and a pile of dirty smalls.

476
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:19,135
- Oh, that sounds extraordinary.
- It is.

477
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:22,615
She's dumbing you, John.
She means she's the prompt.

478
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:25,165
I was only saying earlier
you might make a good gagger.

479
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,935
- She's got the dial for it, hasn't she, Uncle?
- Say that again.

480
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:31,301
She's got the dial for it, hasn't she, Uncle?

481
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,469
Oh, thank you.

482
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:36,235
I don't know where you put it all, Victor.
You must have hollow legs.

483
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:38,935
I can hold as much as the next man,
thank you very much.

484
00:37:39,015 --> 00:37:41,015
Pour a quart in a pint pot,
you'll make a mess.

485
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:45,335
Nonsense. I'm as right as rain. Can't
keep a good man down, as they say...

486
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:48,143
...but I know where
you can put a good man up.

487
00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:52,335
- What in God's name is going on?
- Nothing.

488
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:56,469
Lizzie stepped on my foot
by mistake. No harm done.

489
00:37:57,448 --> 00:37:59,537
I'm taking Lizzie home.

490
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:04,515
- This is no place for an innocent young girl.
- Come, gentlemen. No harm done.

491
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:07,234
- As the executioner said to the hanged man.
- I'll... I'll take her.

492
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:09,569
- There's no need. I can walk alone.
- No, I'll not hear of it.

493
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:12,468
Your food will get cold. I'll be quite safe.
Our digs are just around the corner.

494
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:14,754
Then I'll be back in good time.

495
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:18,001
Watch yourself, Victor.
John Cree's got a temper.

496
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:19,944
I'm not afraid of him.

497
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:38,863
Lizzie.

498
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:42,249
I'm afraid there's...

499
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:44,687
...awful news.

500
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:48,835
Victor was found at the bottom
of the stairs last night.

501
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:50,316
<i>Lizzie...</i>

502
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:54,268
...are you trying to tell me
you suspected John Cree?

503
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:56,834
I didn't say that.
I merely said he was protective.

504
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:59,502
You said the same of Dan Leno.

505
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:01,394
I seem to ignite the urge in men.

506
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:06,536
He was a terrible little turd.

507
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:10,101
But he was our terrible little turd.

508
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,024
That's it, cheer up.

509
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:20,269
I've suggested that we make
tonight's show a special tribute.

510
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:23,150
We'll give him a grand send-off...

511
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:25,501
...won't we?

512
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:27,934
<i>Did you ever speak of it with John?</i>

513
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:31,035
No. I never spoke of it to anyone.

514
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:33,469
I preferred to chalk it up to fate.

515
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:35,991
Would you rather owe your happiness
to simple good fortune...

516
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:38,917
...or to an unspeakable act of violence?

517
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:42,357
Little Victor's death brought you happiness?

518
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,206
<i>Little Victor's death gave me life.</i>

519
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,401
The people come through
the doors and they laugh.

520
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:11,801
Dan, I was hoping you'd wipe your ass
with the papers. You don't read them.

521
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:16,211
Dan? Do you think I could pay
my respects to Little Victor, too?

522
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,768
Good God. This is a funny thing.
What a funny thing.

523
00:40:21,848 --> 00:40:25,135
Just a little song. A blue one maybe,
Victor would like that.

524
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:28,405
A salty sailor act, as if I were a man.
It could be a scream.

525
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,969
Go on, then, Lizzie. Give it a try.

526
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:33,864
Isn't that costume
a little bit small for you, dear?

527
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:35,976
That's the point.

528
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:53,736
<i>A regular farmer's daughter
thought she'd like to come to town</i>

529
00:40:53,816 --> 00:40:57,775
<i>But what did she know about railways?</i>

530
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:02,275
<i>She jumped up on the engine
but the stoker shoved her down</i>

531
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:06,445
<i>What did she know about railways?</i>

532
00:41:06,524 --> 00:41:10,665
<i>A guard came up and spoke to her
and she sat sobbing there</i>

533
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:14,943
<i>Asked her if she'd a ticket,
but she answered with a stare</i>

534
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:20,888
<i>Said he, "You can't go up to town
until you've paid your fare</i>

535
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,667
<i>But what did she know...</i> excuse me...

536
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:28,200
<i>About railways?</i>

537
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,776
<i>So she arrived at Euston
by the midnight train</i>

538
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:37,492
<i>But when she got to the wicket there
someone wanted to punch her ticket</i>

539
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:41,231
<i>The guards and porters
came round by the score</i>

540
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:44,781
<i>And she told them all she'd never
had her ticket punched before</i>

541
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:51,328
<i>Yeah, she told them all she'd never
had her ticket punched before</i>

542
00:42:01,947 --> 00:42:03,834
Oblige again!

543
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:07,634
Lizzie, oblige again! They want more!

544
00:42:07,714 --> 00:42:10,916
- I don't have any more.
- You have them!

545
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:29,565
Would you look at these rotten cotton gloves?

546
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,977
That saltwater will shrink anything.

547
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:39,977
Least that's what the ladies
down at the docks tell me.

548
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,394
I just looked at the gloves
and they looked so absurd...

549
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:53,268
- ...that the line just came to me like that.
- "Them rotten cotton gloves!"

550
00:42:53,348 --> 00:42:56,935
It could be your catchphrase. No need
to dip into the blue bag so much.

551
00:42:57,015 --> 00:42:59,668
They loved it. They loved it all.
They love you.

552
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:01,787
- And who wouldn't.
- Uncle!

553
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:04,302
Careful, Uncle. With Lizzie in that getup...

554
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,801
...anyone looking over might think
you have an eye for the boys.

555
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:10,101
Let them think what they like.
More drinks, please!

556
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:14,010
Little Victor wouldn't have wanted any of us
standing up at the end of the night.

557
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:20,484
I'm tired, I'm afraid.
Walk me home, will you, John?

558
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:23,943
I'll come back.

559
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,288
Why are you still wearing your costume?

560
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,802
I hoped it might keep the men away.

561
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:36,452
You prefer the girls, Lizzie?

562
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,201
Nothing wrong in that if you do.

563
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:41,968
Come on, no need to make something
from nothing. You dress like a girl.

564
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:43,840
Yeah, on stage.

565
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:51,768
Well, if you really care,
maybe I like how I felt on stage.

566
00:43:52,098 --> 00:43:53,918
I care.

567
00:43:54,248 --> 00:43:56,693
I care to see you happy.

568
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:59,302
Tonight...

569
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,435
...tonight, you look happy.

570
00:44:03,414 --> 00:44:06,135
We still need handwriting samples
from Marx, Gissing, and Leno.

571
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:09,841
- Did you speak with the maid again?
- Aveline Ortega? I did, sir.

572
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:12,901
- She won't hear a word said against him.
- You showed her the journal entries?

573
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:16,333
- She swore the writing wasn't his.
- If Cree were our Golem...

574
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:19,201
...it would certainly make sense
of him destroying his papers.

575
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,903
And God knows as a failed playwright,
Cree must've grown sick...

576
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:25,306
...of watching his famous wife
earn London's attention.

577
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,448
- Do you fancy another?
- Trying to get me drunk?

578
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:31,877
A pint, please.

579
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,236
It was a joke. Didn't mean nothing.

580
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:40,794
I didn't mean to offend.

581
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,599
I'm...

582
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:47,170
...on your side.

583
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:57,101
It's not the Golem haunting you, is it?

584
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:00,801
- It's her.
- She's going to hang, Flood.

585
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:03,602
We have to rule out the other suspects.

586
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:08,012
Well, I may have found
an eyewitness in Limehouse, sir.

587
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:10,743
<i>Scaoil liom! Scaoil liom!</i>

588
00:45:11,714 --> 00:45:15,901
You're not in any trouble.
I'm taking you to someone who can translate.

589
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,572
Understand?

590
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:22,734
This is... this is sister Mary.

591
00:45:22,814 --> 00:45:25,274
<i>Tá mo mháthair tar éis mé a dhíol cheana.</i>

592
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:27,968
<i>Tá fear do m'fhuadach ar mo lá breithe.</i>

593
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:30,235
The child says she's not for sale.

594
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:32,934
Her mum's got a fella
taking her on her next birthday.

595
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:34,934
No, no, please.

596
00:45:35,014 --> 00:45:40,314
Tell her my colleague showed her
some photographs, suspects in a crime.

597
00:45:40,394 --> 00:45:45,219
She seemed to recognize one of them.
We need to know where and when she saw him.

598
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,267
Sir, this is where Solomon Weil lived!

599
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,500
The scholar, the third victim.

600
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,077
- Which house number did he...
- Number 4.

601
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:03,769
This man?

602
00:46:05,947 --> 00:46:08,201
Families starve in the streets.

603
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,168
Women are used up
and thrown away, then you...

604
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:14,168
...you persecute one
who fights for the people.

605
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:17,570
You're not fit to clean the boots
of a man like Karl Marx.

606
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:26,902
So...

607
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:31,267
...London declares that the Jew
was murdered by a Jewish monster?

608
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:34,434
And so absolves itself of all responsibility.

609
00:46:34,914 --> 00:46:36,875
Make no mistake, gentlemen...

610
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:40,367
...it is not Solomon Weil
who's mutilated and murdered here.

611
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:41,835
It is the Jew.

612
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:44,601
None of the Golem's
other victims were Hebrews, sir.

613
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:46,788
But do you not see?

614
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:50,434
This murderer strikes
at the very symbols of the city...

615
00:46:50,514 --> 00:46:52,604
...the Jew, the whore.

616
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:57,169
They are the sacrificial tributes
in this labyrinth of London.

617
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:02,643
And so of course must be ritually butchered.

618
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,009
What is it that you wish me to write?

619
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:19,035
"The morning herald...

620
00:47:19,914 --> 00:47:23,342
...had declined to review my debut."

621
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:26,571
<i>All that work for nothing.</i>

622
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:30,714
<i>I resolved that this time
I'd put on a show...</i>

623
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,234
<i>...that everyone would notice.</i>

624
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:40,276
<i>A fine opening act
of the crowd-pleasing sort.</i>

625
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:12,134
<i>And I went on to create a spectacle...</i>

626
00:48:12,214 --> 00:48:15,630
<i>...that no beholder would ever forget.</i>

627
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:25,001
"It was all too easy to kill a whore.

628
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,700
Tonight I would return to kill the Jew."

629
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,500
This is absurd. You didn't do this.

630
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,113
Of course I didn't.

631
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:42,190
Would you agree with the defendant
that in the weeks before his death...

632
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,038
...Mr. Cree had seemed "morbid"?

633
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:47,935
No, sir.

634
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:50,268
He was in good spirits.

635
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:56,234
And how would you describe relations
between Mr. Cree and his wife?

636
00:48:56,314 --> 00:49:01,001
Not especially good, sir.
They saw very little of each other.

637
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,067
And yet Mrs. Cree insisted
on preparing him a nightly draft?

638
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:07,667
That is correct, sir.

639
00:49:07,747 --> 00:49:10,898
And did you hear Mr. Cree
express suspicions...

640
00:49:10,978 --> 00:49:15,367
...that she might have tainted
this draft with something?

641
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:17,200
Not quite.

642
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,671
Though just before his death...

643
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,210
...I overheard them in dispute.

644
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,977
I heard Mr. Cree say,
"You devil. You have done this."

645
00:49:32,546 --> 00:49:36,180
She may as well have placed
the noose around my neck herself.

646
00:49:37,514 --> 00:49:42,033
You must make it plain to the jury that
there was bad blood between the two of you.

647
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:45,701
- Romantic jealousy.
- I never stood between them.

648
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:48,731
I'm sure my feelings on intimacy
are plain to you by now.

649
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:51,167
John was free to court
Aveline if he wanted to.

650
00:49:51,247 --> 00:49:53,441
But he had his heart set on you.

651
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:55,968
I did nothing to encourage it.

652
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:59,134
My stage career had taken off.
I rarely saw him.

653
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:01,935
And then...

654
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:05,037
...out of the blue, he invited me for supper.

655
00:50:05,947 --> 00:50:09,267
- Your new show's tremendous.
- We feel awful intruding.

656
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:12,201
- We simply adore you.
- Thank you.

657
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,534
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- I'll treasure this.

658
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:19,235
- I can't believe it.
- What a surprise!

659
00:50:20,013 --> 00:50:21,584
As I was saying...

660
00:50:21,664 --> 00:50:25,567
...I have reached the end of
the first act of "Misery Junction."

661
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:29,563
But I can't quite decide what to do
with my heroine next, and...

662
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:31,834
...I thought you might advise me.

663
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:35,566
- I'm flattered.
- The heroine's name is Katherine Dove.

664
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:39,063
When I began, I had her in
the workhouses, but now I have her...

665
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:41,967
...sewing sailcloth on the docks.

666
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:46,100
My mother died when I was young. Her kidneys.

667
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,802
- It was so fast.
- Orphaned and alone at 14.

668
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,334
- Is Katherine Dove an orphan?
- She could be.

669
00:50:55,414 --> 00:50:58,500
But you've still not told me what to do
with her by the end of the first act.

670
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,668
- What's your dilemma?
- At the moment...

671
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:04,696
...she's very close
to salvation and ruin, and...

672
00:51:04,776 --> 00:51:06,967
...I'm wondering if I should rescue her.

673
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:08,568
Yes.

674
00:51:08,947 --> 00:51:10,967
Have her become successful.

675
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:13,316
Loved by her audiences.

676
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:16,834
But she's very much alone.
Living in theatrical digs, hand to mouth.

677
00:51:16,913 --> 00:51:19,701
- It's a life of degradation.
- Come on.

678
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:23,014
People love to see degradation upon
the stage. It's what they pay for.

679
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:25,868
Yeah, but they expect to see a happy ending.

680
00:51:25,947 --> 00:51:28,401
And Katherine deserves a protector.

681
00:51:28,481 --> 00:51:30,000
She does.

682
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,300
Her manager, perhaps.

683
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,411
- Someone kindly, like Uncle.
- No, an elderly character...

684
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:38,834
...the audience would know he
wouldn't live to see her into old age.

685
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:41,900
A friend, then. A comic, maybe.

686
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,268
I would like to give her a suitor.

687
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:48,084
Someone who cares fiercely
for her well-being.

688
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:50,051
A white knight.

689
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,350
What do you think?

690
00:51:54,414 --> 00:51:57,275
I think Katherine Dove
can look out for herself.

691
00:51:59,977 --> 00:52:02,668
In the bowl. Yes, there we go.

692
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:05,103
Get it out. That's it.

693
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,551
Gin.

694
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:12,835
Down here. There we go.

695
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:17,711
God. I think I put my back out
carrying her up the stairs.

696
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:23,688
I see you decided to dress
as a woman this evening.

697
00:52:24,014 --> 00:52:26,147
Can't wear a costume out to supper, can I?

698
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,242
Wouldn't be the first time.

699
00:52:36,514 --> 00:52:38,701
Be careful of that one, Lizzie.

700
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:43,601
Don't lead him up the garden path unless
you're prepared to be dragged indoors.

701
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:45,568
He offered me the lead in "Misery Junction."

702
00:52:45,648 --> 00:52:48,276
He'll expect something in return.

703
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,261
You don't need him, Lizzie.

704
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,109
You did all this on your own.

705
00:53:05,513 --> 00:53:07,402
I could do more.

706
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:10,635
Could be a real actress.

707
00:53:11,614 --> 00:53:15,677
Show the world what people
like us are really capable of.

708
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:19,680
I just need a chance.

709
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:26,000
Here we sit, the two most
famous faces on the stage...

710
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,935
...and you suggest the world
conspires to oppress us.

711
00:53:30,214 --> 00:53:33,077
Remember that book you lent me? Pope?

712
00:53:33,157 --> 00:53:37,401
In the temple of fame, some people's names
are carved in stone and others in ice.

713
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,267
We're clowns, Dan.

714
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,008
We'll be forgotten.

715
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:49,000
If you think a man like John Cree
is going to change that...

716
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,343
...I don't have the breath to argue.

717
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:58,668
And you know she's got a soft spot for him.
And whatever her faults, she's family.

718
00:53:59,597 --> 00:54:02,461
And we look out for each other, don't we?

719
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,534
The big finale is the hanging.
We've a life-size gallows.

720
00:54:11,614 --> 00:54:14,668
I'll wear this harness, concealed, and then
drop right through the trap just there.

721
00:54:14,747 --> 00:54:17,615
- Looks just like a real hanging.
- You sure it's safe, this contraption?

722
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:21,932
- You're not wearing a real noose, are you?
- The noose is real but the fall is broken...

723
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:24,800
- ...by the harness.
- Where's Lizzie?

724
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,638
Up above giving John Cree
an interview for <i>the Era.</i>

725
00:54:27,717 --> 00:54:30,867
- Is that what they call it?
- I'll go and tell her to hurry up.

726
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:35,000
The play's a shocker, but a spoof shocker,
the way only our marvelous company can do it.

727
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,700
Dan wrote it. It's based on
the Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811.

728
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,200
- John Williams.
- Pardon?

729
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,234
- The killer's name was John Williams.
- Quite. But much of it is fiction.

730
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:46,200
It's all great fun, and terribly gory.
You must put that in for your readers.

731
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,700
Dan says everybody thrills
to gore these days.

732
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,434
Let's have you finished, John.

733
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:53,167
She's not even ready and
she's on stage in 10 minutes.

734
00:54:53,247 --> 00:54:55,700
We can't have the star late
for the first performance.

735
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,433
Dan's still the star. Always will be.

736
00:54:58,513 --> 00:55:02,178
Thought I felt my ears burning.
Did anyone check the safety?

737
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:04,900
Of course. Wouldn't let anything
happen to our Lizzie, would we?

738
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,634
- How's the crowd?
- Excellent. Great number of Jews.

739
00:55:07,713 --> 00:55:10,100
I believe it's one of their holidays.

740
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,200
You should speak to them in Yiddish.
They will love it.

741
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,000
Wish them...

742
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,143
<i>"...meesa meschina."</i>

743
00:55:22,314 --> 00:55:25,543
Welcome, brave hearts,
to an evening of horror.

744
00:55:31,514 --> 00:55:33,234
Our play's about to begin...

745
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,334
...but first, ladies and gentlemen...

746
00:55:36,414 --> 00:55:40,534
...and those not unconnected with
a certain historical chosen race...

747
00:55:40,614 --> 00:55:44,090
...may I wish you all
from the bottom of my heart...

748
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:46,867
<i>...meesa meschina.</i>

749
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:49,276
That is <i>mashugana!</i>

750
00:55:55,912 --> 00:55:57,933
What did you say that for?

751
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:01,242
- What happened?
- Lizzie wished the Jews a sudden death!

752
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,729
Here we are again!

753
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:11,142
It was only a lark, Lizzie.

754
00:56:18,146 --> 00:56:21,189
I came back at once to see
if you were all right.

755
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,900
<i>And after that, you began courting?</i>

756
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,730
After a fashion.

757
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:55,834
I could never love John enough
to give him what he really wanted.

758
00:56:56,214 --> 00:56:58,901
But you grew to love him?

759
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,435
I wanted to be in his play.

760
00:57:03,364 --> 00:57:06,934
He wanted the gratification
of plucking a poor needy girl...

761
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:09,476
...from misery and saving her.

762
00:57:11,279 --> 00:57:13,527
We used one another equally.

763
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:17,481
Perhaps that's the best
that can be said of any coupling.

764
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:21,167
That's a very dim view.

765
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:24,463
If you seek a dim view,
be sure to ask a comedian.

766
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:37,867
Alice Stanton's dress finally showed up.

767
00:57:37,947 --> 00:57:41,409
Improperly archived,
like everything else here.

768
00:57:44,912 --> 00:57:46,942
Been at the jail again?

769
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:51,800
Anything more on Cree?

770
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,533
Only that he was a manipulative ass
who fancied himself as a White Knight.

771
00:57:55,613 --> 00:58:00,468
I meant as relating to our case.
The Golem. Remember him?

772
00:58:00,547 --> 00:58:02,217
Cree knew of the murderer John Williams.

773
00:58:02,297 --> 00:58:05,398
Yet, apparently, so did Dan Leno. In fact,
Leno wrote a whole play about the fellow.

774
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:07,049
Golem suspect who is alive.

775
00:58:07,129 --> 00:58:09,881
- That would be bad news.
- For his next victim, certainly.

776
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:12,400
And for you. Or do you no longer care
what becomes of your career?

777
00:58:12,479 --> 00:58:14,651
- I've a job to do and I'm doing it.
- And which job would that be?

778
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:17,667
Watch your tongue, Flood.
Do I need to remind you of your position?

779
00:58:17,747 --> 00:58:21,887
That may be helpful. Because
there are times when I'm confused...

780
00:58:21,967 --> 00:58:25,434
...as to whether we're here to find
the Golem or to save Elizabeth.

781
00:58:25,513 --> 00:58:27,418
Perhaps we'll do both!

782
00:58:28,147 --> 00:58:29,977
Who knows...

783
00:58:34,346 --> 00:58:36,566
Dear God, how many pockets did Leno need?

784
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:39,987
He tosses things into the crowd.
Sweeties. Flowers. Undergarments.

785
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:42,867
Sounds hilarious.
Didn't Roberts empty the contents?

786
00:58:42,947 --> 00:58:45,854
The coroner's office did it.
Why? Did they miss something?

787
00:58:59,113 --> 00:59:02,067
8 Gower Place? Why do I know that?

788
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:06,526
Perhaps because we're due a visit.
It's George Gissing's address.

789
00:59:08,013 --> 00:59:11,533
His wife gave him an alibi for the night
of the Ratcliffe Highway murders...

790
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:14,276
...but she seemed fond of her drink.

791
00:59:21,813 --> 00:59:24,200
We need to talk to Mr. Gissing, madam.

792
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,368
George isn't here. He just left.

793
00:59:26,447 --> 00:59:28,666
Do you know where he was going?

794
00:59:28,746 --> 00:59:31,008
Limehouse, perhaps?

795
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:56,416
Not yet. I'm interested to see where he goes.

796
00:59:56,496 --> 01:00:00,126
What business a scholar has
in the streets of Limehouse.

797
01:00:39,713 --> 01:00:43,194
- Madam, we're from Scotland Yard.
- We're just a pharmacy. You go away!

798
01:00:43,274 --> 01:00:45,109
Check my record!

799
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,328
Our business is with Mr. Gissing,
the man who just entered, not you.

800
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:58,947
Good customer. He keep his work here.

801
01:01:02,047 --> 01:01:05,209
Always working. Writing.

802
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:11,933
Mr. Gissing, I'm Detective
Inspector Kildare of Scotland Yard.

803
01:01:12,013 --> 01:01:16,475
Perhaps you could explain how this came to
be in the possession of a murdered woman.

804
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:20,933
I'm afraid you'll find
my address in the pockets...

805
01:01:21,013 --> 01:01:23,533
...of a great many women in this area, sir.

806
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,633
My wife, Nell, is in the habit
of going missing.

807
01:01:26,713 --> 01:01:30,100
I give my address so that
they may contact me if they see her.

808
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,850
Let us just say my wife
used to ply the same trade.

809
01:01:34,879 --> 01:01:37,800
- You don't seem in the least bit surprised.
- By what?

810
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,500
That a gentleman like me, a scholar,
should have wed a fallen woman.

811
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:45,109
Why would anyone be surprised?
The world is full of men...

812
01:01:45,189 --> 01:01:47,568
- ...like you, Mr. Gissing.
- I beg your pardon?

813
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:51,497
Men who feign generosity when what
they really seek is congratulation.

814
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:54,000
Men who play God by saving lives.

815
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,366
Is it really so different, I wonder...

816
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,787
- ...from playing God by taking them?
- I am not a murderer, sir.

817
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:03,617
Then perhaps you will write
the words that I dictate?

818
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:06,234
Let's get this thing done.

819
01:02:06,313 --> 01:02:09,388
"September 10, 1880.

820
01:02:11,266 --> 01:02:13,329
My public debut...

821
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:16,167
...had garnered rave reviews."

822
01:02:16,246 --> 01:02:20,134
I could scarcely wait to begin
work on my next creation...

823
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:22,900
...but there was time to pass before dark...

824
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,742
<i>...so I paid a visit
to the Ratcliffe Highway shop.</i>

825
01:02:33,778 --> 01:02:36,433
<i>I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife.</i>

826
01:02:36,513 --> 01:02:38,700
<i>I could tell that when the time came...</i>

827
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:42,441
<i>...she would make a fine player
in my magnum opus.</i>

828
01:03:16,529 --> 01:03:18,784
You're not the Jew from the library.

829
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:22,601
Well... no matter.

830
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,067
Who are you? What do you want?

831
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:28,400
I have come to discourse with you.

832
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,526
About death and everlasting life.

833
01:03:33,178 --> 01:03:34,733
Herein...

834
01:03:34,813 --> 01:03:36,922
...lies the secret.

835
01:03:46,245 --> 01:03:49,299
<i>It was here that I read
of the mythical Golem...</i>

836
01:03:49,379 --> 01:03:52,354
<i>...a homunculus of clay given life by man.</i>

837
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:57,166
<i>How could any Londoner fail
to delight in this piece of theater?</i>

838
01:03:57,246 --> 01:04:00,821
<i>I could even see myself appearing
before the next unfortunate...</i>

839
01:04:00,901 --> 01:04:03,732
<i>...with mallet in hand exclaiming...</i>

840
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:06,291
<i>"...Here we are again."</i>

841
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:12,480
- May I go now?
- What?

842
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,347
- Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
- Why would you be thinking of me still?

843
01:04:16,427 --> 01:04:18,700
My hand doesn't match at all.
You know I'm innocent.

844
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:22,373
I know. I was reading what you wrote.
You were in my mind. I'm sorry.

845
01:04:22,453 --> 01:04:25,633
- Something I missed.
- Oh, I see. What is it?

846
01:04:25,713 --> 01:04:28,927
A line from the journal.

847
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:34,533
"I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife."

848
01:04:35,512 --> 01:04:38,136
<i>On September the 10th,
the Golem made a purchase...</i>

849
01:04:38,216 --> 01:04:40,642
<i>...from the Ratcliffe Highway shop.</i>

850
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:06,066
<i>A new production of "Bluebeard"
opens this weekend...</i>

851
01:05:06,146 --> 01:05:12,215
...and all of London longs to see
the great Dan Leno performing it.

852
01:05:12,947 --> 01:05:17,768
But I know they yearn
for more potent excitements.

853
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:24,100
This is pantomime in its purest form.

854
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:28,733
I could even see myself appearing
before the next unfortunate...

855
01:05:28,813 --> 01:05:31,666
...with a mallet in my hand, exclaiming...

856
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:34,242
"...here we are again!"

857
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:45,633
<i>What strange coincidence
and delight to discover...</i>

858
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:47,867
<i>...on the streets of Limehouse...</i>

859
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:52,033
<i>...a whore wearing a costume
I remembered well.</i>

860
01:05:52,763 --> 01:05:56,633
<i>She was a player waiting for a role.</i>

861
01:05:56,713 --> 01:05:59,933
<i>Of course, I obliged her.</i>

862
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:03,900
The public yearned for the next installment.

863
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,675
And one should never keep
an audience waiting.

864
01:06:11,146 --> 01:06:13,900
<i>We need to forget about Cree
and concentrate on Leno.</i>

865
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:18,133
The Golem even imagined himself
saying, "Here we are again."

866
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:21,733
I know, but apparently everyone
knows Leno's catch-phrase.

867
01:06:21,813 --> 01:06:24,874
There's Alice Stanton's dress
and the fact he knew Mr. Gerrard.

868
01:06:24,954 --> 01:06:27,233
We're all part of London's tapestry.

869
01:06:27,313 --> 01:06:30,409
Sometimes threads get crossed.

870
01:06:32,712 --> 01:06:34,609
Good Lord!

871
01:06:38,445 --> 01:06:41,780
We should buy tickets.
I'd be intrigued to see how it ends.

872
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,096
- I could recommend many better shows.
- I was making a joke, Flood.

873
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:48,753
As was I. Obviously.

874
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:50,933
Who'd wish to see
something in such poor taste?

875
01:06:51,012 --> 01:06:53,815
Apparently London's appetite
for horror knows no bounds.

876
01:06:53,895 --> 01:06:56,399
Our Golem was quite correct about that.

877
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,833
Oh, Bluey, please!

878
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:03,512
Have mercy! It's been days since I've eaten!

879
01:07:14,345 --> 01:07:17,999
Oh, you are a kind man, Bluey!

880
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:21,908
I shall never have it said
you're not good to me.

881
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,008
I thought I might expire from starvation.

882
01:07:39,279 --> 01:07:41,693
What on earth are you doing, dear?

883
01:07:41,773 --> 01:07:44,767
- I'm taking my medical treatment.
- You're treatment?

884
01:07:44,847 --> 01:07:49,500
The doctor told me to take
a daily walk on an empty stomach.

885
01:07:55,678 --> 01:07:58,908
Brought the receipt,
as you requested in your telegram.

886
01:08:00,513 --> 01:08:04,367
As you will see, I did not buy cufflinks.

887
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,199
A ladies' hat.

888
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:09,999
I often shopped for stagewear
at Gerrard's little shop.

889
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,899
God rest him. I knew him well.

890
01:08:12,979 --> 01:08:15,800
Now, you mentioned needing
a sample of my hand.

891
01:08:15,879 --> 01:08:20,600
Well, I brought a pile of my old papers.
Please, take as many as you see fit.

892
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:25,163
I'm afraid I'll need you to produce
a sample in my presence, Mr. Leno.

893
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:30,879
Then you will permit me to pay you a visit
at Scotland Yard tomorrow afternoon?

894
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:33,167
Only, I have supper arrangements.

895
01:08:34,296 --> 01:08:36,584
And I've still to be rid of all of this.

896
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,466
If you'll... excuse me?

897
01:08:39,546 --> 01:08:43,250
Perhaps we could continue
to talk while you're...

898
01:08:43,879 --> 01:08:48,494
I've some questions I'd like
to ask you about John Cree.

899
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:53,199
Then I shall try to answer them. Though
one should never speak ill of the dead.

900
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,066
- You didn't care for the man?
- I was friendly with his wife.

901
01:08:56,146 --> 01:08:59,933
He made her unhappy.
You may extrapolate the rest.

902
01:09:00,013 --> 01:09:02,467
When did you last see him?

903
01:09:02,547 --> 01:09:07,500
First night of his play, "Misery Junction,"
which also happened to be the closing night.

904
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,233
I know. Did you see him afterwards?

905
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,976
Of course. This is my theater.

906
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:17,220
I took over managing it last year when...

907
01:09:18,547 --> 01:09:21,400
...Uncle joined the great
pantomime in the sky.

908
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:24,359
The performance was here?

909
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:28,507
For Lizzie's sake.
Whatever became of our friendship...

910
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,616
...we'll always be family.

911
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:35,700
- Is John Cree a suspect?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

912
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:39,366
A posthumous suspect.
What will you do, dig him up for the trial?

913
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:43,454
Do you know why Lizzie might be
reluctant to voice any suspicions?

914
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,973
You think she's protecting him?

915
01:09:47,513 --> 01:09:49,866
Now, that's a novel slant.

916
01:09:49,946 --> 01:09:52,401
Most people believe she poisoned him.

917
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:55,489
Do you?

918
01:09:58,646 --> 01:10:03,003
Either way, that man was
the author of his own demise.

919
01:10:03,413 --> 01:10:05,700
He practically destroyed her.

920
01:10:05,779 --> 01:10:09,647
Insisting she give up the stage... I mean,
he may as well have ended her life.

921
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:13,866
Do you think he was capable of ending a life?

922
01:10:14,246 --> 01:10:16,534
Literally, I mean.

923
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,425
Who knows what any man is capable of?

924
01:10:21,547 --> 01:10:23,999
We all wear pantomime masks...

925
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:25,975
...do we not?

926
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:30,333
I'm sorry, I really must dress now.

927
01:10:30,413 --> 01:10:33,108
First, tell me about Little Victor.

928
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:38,066
If the injustices of the past interest you...

929
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:41,517
...you'd do better to look into
the demise of Tommy Farr.

930
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,073
Uncle?

931
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:45,709
Uncle.

932
01:10:56,346 --> 01:10:59,765
They said the jury expects
to reach a verdict this afternoon.

933
01:10:59,845 --> 01:11:01,356
I know. Lizzie...

934
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:04,206
It would seem the press
have reached theirs already.

935
01:11:07,078 --> 01:11:09,033
Lizzie, I spoke with Dan.

936
01:11:09,113 --> 01:11:12,177
He urged me to look into Uncle's death.

937
01:11:12,946 --> 01:11:16,487
If you wanted to know about Uncle,
you should simply have asked.

938
01:11:16,567 --> 01:11:19,199
Come into the parlor.

939
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:21,900
As the spider said to the fly.

940
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,099
Isn't that how it goes? The rhyme?

941
01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:28,068
It may be, Lizzie.

942
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:32,400
It may be. Cucumber sandwich?

943
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,966
- No, thanks.
- Oh, I forgot.

944
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:38,141
You're not entirely partial
to cucumber, are you?

945
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:42,766
What's this about, Uncle?

946
01:11:42,946 --> 01:11:44,651
Why'd you invite me?

947
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,900
I want to show you something.

948
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,519
Well, close your eyes.

949
01:11:53,078 --> 01:11:54,907
Good girl.

950
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:21,414
It's just my fun, Lizzie.

951
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,167
I like a good beating every now and again.

952
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:27,933
Doesn't everyone?

953
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:30,266
I know her.

954
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,567
That's the girl who assisted the Great
Bolini. She used to be sawn in half.

955
01:12:33,646 --> 01:12:37,289
That's her, ducks. What a performer.

956
01:12:38,946 --> 01:12:41,230
But it's a shame
she had to leave the company.

957
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,600
- Why have you shown me this?
- Don't play the innocent with me.

958
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:47,099
I am not playing. I am real.

959
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:49,899
Well, I'd be grateful
if you could oblige me, Lizzie...

960
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:53,356
...with a pose, a tableau.

961
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:57,508
- Perhaps a little beating?
- I'd rather be destroyed first.

962
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:02,012
- I'm prepared to forget this visit took place.
- As I said...

963
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:04,426
...it is a pity she had to go.

964
01:13:04,605 --> 01:13:06,712
She grew tired of performing.

965
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:10,199
You would never be rid of me.

966
01:13:10,878 --> 01:13:15,063
- Dan would never allow it.
- Well, I find, as keeper of Bunce...

967
01:13:15,678 --> 01:13:17,966
...that I can do as I please.

968
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,681
Now...

969
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:23,192
...you keep my secret...

970
01:13:23,272 --> 01:13:25,955
- ...and I'll keep yours.
- I have no secrets.

971
01:13:28,245 --> 01:13:30,168
You shall in a moment.

972
01:13:42,213 --> 01:13:44,400
<i>He said I'm to return to him next Sunday...</i>

973
01:13:45,578 --> 01:13:47,999
...and every Sunday hereafter.

974
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:50,133
To do the same again?

975
01:13:50,682 --> 01:13:52,733
There's photographs.

976
01:13:53,712 --> 01:13:56,256
- John, I had to speak of it to somebody.
- This is monstrous, Lizzie!

977
01:13:56,336 --> 01:13:58,208
You can't tell a soul.

978
01:14:00,611 --> 01:14:03,067
I shall put a stop to this.

979
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:05,337
But first...

980
01:14:06,313 --> 01:14:07,891
...I wish to do this.

981
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,426
He's robbed you of your honor.
Let me restore it to you.

982
01:14:15,512 --> 01:14:19,599
Uncle died three days
after John confronted him.

983
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,999
Uncle was not young. He had a weak
heart and a fondness for drink.

984
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:24,954
That's not what Dan Leno thinks.

985
01:14:25,134 --> 01:14:29,599
He thinks that John blackmailed Uncle
into changing his will and then killed him.

986
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:32,561
Â£500 and the camera.

987
01:14:33,995 --> 01:14:36,609
It would seem I gave an excellent beating.

988
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:41,250
You don't want to be saved, do you?

989
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:44,223
Not by me.

990
01:14:44,303 --> 01:14:46,167
Not by any man.

991
01:14:47,246 --> 01:14:49,507
I don't deserve to be saved.

992
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:07,332
John, I can't.

993
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:09,832
What do you mean?
We're husband and wife now, Lizzie.

994
01:15:09,912 --> 01:15:13,316
- I know.
- Three years I've waited.

995
01:15:13,396 --> 01:15:16,699
Three years of courtship
and endless bloody engagement.

996
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:20,133
It's hardly my fault that Panto
season extended 'til easter.

997
01:15:20,213 --> 01:15:23,032
Would you have had me spend
our wedding night playing Aladdin?

998
01:15:23,112 --> 01:15:25,366
It seems now that option
would've been scarcely different.

999
01:15:25,445 --> 01:15:28,666
- Please, John, just try to understand.
- No, you understand!

1000
01:15:29,545 --> 01:15:31,066
John, please, I don't like it.

1001
01:15:31,146 --> 01:15:33,333
I don't ask for gratitude
for all I've done for you.

1002
01:15:33,413 --> 01:15:37,641
All I ask is that you fulfill
your duties as a wife.

1003
01:15:51,086 --> 01:15:52,942
What are you doing here?

1004
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:56,967
Hello.

1005
01:15:57,646 --> 01:15:59,632
- Hello.
- Hello.

1006
01:15:59,712 --> 01:16:03,493
I'll have a new contract drawn up
tomorrow, John John. But don't you worry.

1007
01:16:03,573 --> 01:16:06,432
- Lizzie!
- But don't you worry.

1008
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,375
Lizzie.

1009
01:16:10,845 --> 01:16:12,398
Well, well.

1010
01:16:14,012 --> 01:16:17,333
If it isn't Mrs. John Cree.

1011
01:16:17,412 --> 01:16:21,266
Three months of married life and you're
missing the roar of the greasepaint already.

1012
01:16:21,346 --> 01:16:25,366
Oh, nonsense.
I've been too busy to miss anything.

1013
01:16:25,445 --> 01:16:30,218
What tosh! Little Lizzie without an audience.

1014
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:33,532
You mustn't let that rotten man
order you about so.

1015
01:16:33,612 --> 01:16:35,999
John is perfectly happy for me to perform.

1016
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:38,199
Still going to play the lead
in "Misery Junction."

1017
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:39,789
Come of it, Lizzie.

1018
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:43,706
That man's so petrified of failure
he'll never bring himself to finish it.

1019
01:16:43,786 --> 01:16:47,599
He's writing every day at the library.
It's almost complete.

1020
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,099
I'm telling you as a friend, Lizzie.

1021
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:53,399
Forget "Misery Junction." Forget John.

1022
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,569
If you want your name etched in stone...

1023
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:59,267
...you're gonna have to take up
the chisel yourself.

1024
01:17:00,146 --> 01:17:02,233
So, to what do we owe the pleasure?

1025
01:17:02,313 --> 01:17:04,584
I'm actually here to see Aveline.

1026
01:17:07,178 --> 01:17:09,666
I have a proposition for you, dear.

1027
01:17:09,746 --> 01:17:11,836
I'm in need of a ladies' maid.

1028
01:17:12,246 --> 01:17:13,746
Me?

1029
01:17:14,946 --> 01:17:16,296
You must be playing.

1030
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:19,233
I can offer you twice the weekly
wage you're earning here.

1031
01:17:19,313 --> 01:17:22,799
What I require is some help
bearing the load of my...

1032
01:17:22,879 --> 01:17:24,699
...my wifely duties.

1033
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:26,639
Dear God, Lizzie.

1034
01:17:49,377 --> 01:17:51,552
Do you know how John's play is coming along?

1035
01:17:51,632 --> 01:17:53,667
Very nicely, he tells me.

1036
01:17:54,446 --> 01:17:58,799
You know, there's no need for you
to prepare his nightly cordial, Lizzie.

1037
01:17:58,879 --> 01:18:00,732
I can do it.

1038
01:18:00,812 --> 01:18:03,832
I make one for myself.
It's no more effort to prepare two.

1039
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,066
I'd be happy to make both.

1040
01:18:06,146 --> 01:18:10,821
I could bring yours to your quarters
before I take John's to his.

1041
01:19:56,878 --> 01:19:58,993
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same thing...

1042
01:19:59,073 --> 01:20:01,699
...because I know what it is
you're not doing, and that is writing.

1043
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:04,399
Why tell me "Misery Junction" was not
finished when it was hardly even begun?

1044
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:08,529
It was! It's nearly complete.
I've just put it aside for now.

1045
01:20:08,609 --> 01:20:13,066
Put it aside? I support you financially.
I allow that your every need is met!

1046
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:18,066
Don't pillory me about my damn play
if what really irks you is Aveline.

1047
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,233
Why would that irk me?

1048
01:20:21,662 --> 01:20:25,066
Go home, Lizzie. Let me finish my research.

1049
01:20:25,145 --> 01:20:28,432
Your research? Into what?

1050
01:20:28,512 --> 01:20:31,367
My play. My new play.

1051
01:20:32,646 --> 01:20:34,732
But what of "Misery Junction"?

1052
01:20:34,812 --> 01:20:37,499
I grew tired of Katherine Dove.

1053
01:20:37,839 --> 01:20:39,799
Is there a role in it for me?

1054
01:20:39,879 --> 01:20:42,599
No, Lizzie. There is not.

1055
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:44,765
You're a lady now...

1056
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:47,341
...and the stage is no place for a lady.

1057
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:58,729
You staged it without permission
and it was poorly received.

1058
01:20:58,809 --> 01:21:02,232
"'Misery Junction' leaves
audience in misery, indeed."

1059
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:06,410
Isn't it funny how the savage reviews are
the ones you can recall word for word?

1060
01:21:11,811 --> 01:21:14,756
- More! More!
- Uncle, please.

1061
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:17,626
You have stolen my honor! I am innocent!

1062
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,432
You wish to be a man?
Just pretend that I'm a women!

1063
01:21:20,512 --> 01:21:23,666
It's Lizzie they're mocking, John.
It's not your play.

1064
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:26,999
You lie! This was not for me!
This was for you!

1065
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:29,718
You wish to prove yourself
as an actress, you selfish whore...

1066
01:21:29,798 --> 01:21:32,590
- ...and you failed even at that!
- You are the failure.

1067
01:21:32,946 --> 01:21:34,899
- Jesus!
- See?

1068
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:37,799
Where's the White Knight now, John?
You are just as all men.

1069
01:21:37,879 --> 01:21:41,491
One more word from your mouth
and I will snap your wretched neck!

1070
01:21:41,571 --> 01:21:42,832
John, go home.

1071
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,606
My play was unfinished and you destroyed it!

1072
01:21:45,686 --> 01:21:48,268
Destroyed me and my reputation!

1073
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:51,165
You don't have a reputation!
Who do you believe yourself to be?

1074
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:54,699
You are nobody, John, nobody,
and you never will be!

1075
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:57,600
Get out of here, John. Out!

1076
01:21:59,178 --> 01:22:01,899
Look at you both. You're clowns.

1077
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:03,846
Worthless clowns.

1078
01:22:03,926 --> 01:22:07,065
You're the ones who'll be forgotten, not me.

1079
01:22:07,145 --> 01:22:08,588
Not me.

1080
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:15,966
- John?
- Drive on.

1081
01:22:16,045 --> 01:22:17,732
- John.
- Giddyup!

1082
01:22:17,812 --> 01:22:19,232
John.

1083
01:22:19,312 --> 01:22:20,833
John.

1084
01:22:21,712 --> 01:22:22,746
John!

1085
01:22:22,826 --> 01:22:25,845
That opening night, September the 5th,
it drove him over the edge...

1086
01:22:25,925 --> 01:22:30,025
...but not to suicide. It drove him to
prove to the world that he was an artist.

1087
01:22:30,105 --> 01:22:34,265
That night, the Golem made his first kill,
and you think it's your fault.

1088
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:37,098
- You're putting words in my mouth.
- Why this dance, Lizzie?

1089
01:22:37,178 --> 01:22:41,028
Why won't you admit that you came to know
or at least suspect what he'd become?

1090
01:22:41,108 --> 01:22:45,534
- If this is a dance, it is you who is leading.
- Let me read you the last entry.

1091
01:22:46,812 --> 01:22:49,232
"Ratcliffe Highway was a tour de force.

1092
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:52,619
And as an actor may take home
a program as a souvenir...

1093
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:57,265
...so I returned with a blood-soaked shawl
belonging to the clothes seller's wife.

1094
01:22:57,345 --> 01:23:01,275
The next night, fearful of discovery,
I ventured to destroy it...

1095
01:23:01,355 --> 01:23:03,835
<i>...and therein lay my mistake.</i>

1096
01:23:08,077 --> 01:23:11,065
John, you're home. I didn't hear you come in.

1097
01:23:19,011 --> 01:23:23,154
There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.

1098
01:23:32,177 --> 01:23:35,641
<i>I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.</i>

1099
01:23:58,477 --> 01:24:01,129
<i>I no longer feel safe under my own roof.</i>

1100
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:05,693
<i>I cannot go on like this.</i>

1101
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:11,204
You poisoned him, didn't you?

1102
01:24:14,579 --> 01:24:16,899
Lizzie, listen to me. We have a few minutes.

1103
01:24:16,978 --> 01:24:20,235
You can still change your plea. Confess.
You did it because you knew what he was.

1104
01:24:20,315 --> 01:24:22,486
You did it because
you were in fear for your life.

1105
01:24:22,566 --> 01:24:24,506
I promise you'll have
the sympathy of the jury.

1106
01:24:24,586 --> 01:24:27,998
- I don't want their sympathy.
- Why do you not deserve redemption?

1107
01:24:28,078 --> 01:24:30,699
Because you killed him or because
you believe you created a monster?

1108
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:32,563
What I deserve is to live freely...

1109
01:24:32,643 --> 01:24:35,357
...and in death be remembered for
my accomplishments, not as the wife...

1110
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:38,699
...who poisoned her husband,
my name forever tethered to his.

1111
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:41,206
Mrs. Cree.

1112
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:45,364
While that chance remains,
I have no choice but to cling to it.

1113
01:24:52,311 --> 01:24:54,245
<i>Have the jury reached a verdict?</i>

1114
01:24:55,044 --> 01:24:58,995
- Yes, My Lord.
- How do the jury find the defendant?

1115
01:24:59,075 --> 01:25:00,699
Guilty.

1116
01:25:01,278 --> 01:25:04,516
Order! Order!

1117
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:06,613
Elizabeth Cree...

1118
01:25:06,693 --> 01:25:11,679
...you will be returned to prison and taken
from there to a place of execution...

1119
01:25:11,759 --> 01:25:15,115
<i>...where at 10:00 tomorrow morning,
you will be hanged by the neck...</i>

1120
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:16,998
<i>...until you are dead.</i>

1121
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,799
<i>May the Lord have mercy on your soul.</i>

1122
01:25:19,878 --> 01:25:23,507
Inspector Kildare, Scotland Yard.
I need a moment with her, please.

1123
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:29,998
- You don't deserve this.
- It's done. I hang tomorrow at 10:00.

1124
01:25:30,078 --> 01:25:33,098
No. I won't let it happen.
John Cree was a murderer.

1125
01:25:33,178 --> 01:25:37,675
I mean to prove it and appeal for your
pardon. The world needs to know the truth.

1126
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:45,632
I'd like for you to unmask the Golem.

1127
01:25:45,712 --> 01:25:48,749
This is your moment, your chance.
I'd like for you to have that.

1128
01:25:48,828 --> 01:25:51,106
I'm sorry, sir. We need to leave.

1129
01:25:53,277 --> 01:25:54,832
We don't have much time.

1130
01:25:54,912 --> 01:25:58,105
The manuscript of "Misery Junction"
is handwritten. Dan may still have it.

1131
01:25:58,185 --> 01:26:01,274
I shall stop this. I promise you.

1132
01:26:05,878 --> 01:26:07,902
You filthy...

1133
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,661
Here we are again!

1134
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:30,099
Lizzie paid for the hire of the theater.

1135
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:33,466
I advised her against it,
but she was adamant.

1136
01:26:33,546 --> 01:26:35,741
And it was not a success.

1137
01:26:36,778 --> 01:26:38,998
That's putting it mildly.

1138
01:26:39,078 --> 01:26:41,265
So put it any way that you will.

1139
01:26:41,345 --> 01:26:45,666
Barely any tickets sold,
but Lizzie insisted on a full house...

1140
01:26:45,746 --> 01:26:49,147
...so she took to the streets
and gave them away to the poor.

1141
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:02,241
Here it is. "Misery Junction."

1142
01:27:06,778 --> 01:27:09,032
It's typeset.

1143
01:27:09,112 --> 01:27:12,102
Oh, I don't have the original
manuscript, I'm afraid.

1144
01:27:12,182 --> 01:27:16,030
A usual practice is to have it archived,
unless the author asks for it back...

1145
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:18,952
- ...which he didn't.
- Archived... where?

1146
01:27:19,412 --> 01:27:22,165
The librarian agreed to open up early, sir.

1147
01:27:22,245 --> 01:27:24,065
He should be here any moment.

1148
01:27:24,145 --> 01:27:27,612
I pray he is. They hang her at 10:00.

1149
01:27:45,612 --> 01:27:47,182
<i>Lizzie!</i>

1150
01:27:53,045 --> 01:27:54,907
<i>Lizzie!</i>

1151
01:28:01,245 --> 01:28:02,831
Lizzie.

1152
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,786
I'm ready.

1153
01:28:17,711 --> 01:28:20,298
But this is most odd. Should be here.

1154
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,432
Could someone have withdrawn it?

1155
01:28:22,512 --> 01:28:24,798
Not unless they did so just now.

1156
01:28:25,388 --> 01:28:28,137
- Quickly, the door.
- Sir!

1157
01:28:33,644 --> 01:28:35,265
Unhand me! I've done nothing wrong.

1158
01:28:35,345 --> 01:28:38,188
Then perhaps you can tell us
why the hurry to obtain this?

1159
01:28:38,268 --> 01:28:41,572
I plan to rewrite it, sir.
Demand a production.

1160
01:28:41,651 --> 01:28:46,532
A topical shocker about Lizzie Cree.
Now she's to be hanged, it'll be a smash.

1161
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:48,998
Really? So you're a writer now,
are you, Miss Ortega?

1162
01:28:49,078 --> 01:28:52,499
No, sir. But it won't require much work.

1163
01:28:52,579 --> 01:28:54,665
It was the story of her life, after all.

1164
01:28:54,745 --> 01:28:57,998
My idea is to begin the play
at the Gallows...

1165
01:28:58,078 --> 01:29:00,165
...then retrace each step
that led her to them.

1166
01:29:00,245 --> 01:29:04,369
I cannot help but think that the addition
of a murderous husband might be popular.

1167
01:29:04,449 --> 01:29:06,740
I told you all I know, sir.

1168
01:29:07,612 --> 01:29:09,358
John is innocent.

1169
01:29:45,027 --> 01:29:48,332
- Jesus!
- You're the ones who'll be forgotten!

1170
01:29:48,412 --> 01:29:50,220
Not me.

1171
01:29:56,478 --> 01:29:58,498
Is it time?

1172
01:29:58,577 --> 01:29:59,998
There's no one here.

1173
01:30:00,078 --> 01:30:04,658
They hardly ever admit the public these
days, Mrs. Cree. Only for the most hated.

1174
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:08,526
Please, no. You must help me.
Please. Please tell them to wait.

1175
01:30:08,605 --> 01:30:10,962
- Inspector Kildare is coming.
- I'm sorry.

1176
01:30:11,312 --> 01:30:13,333
Can't you go any faster?

1177
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:15,698
- Prison's just around the corner.
- I know!

1178
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:18,769
No, we must wait for him, please.
This is wrong! He will prove it!

1179
01:30:18,849 --> 01:30:22,126
- I beg you, just a little longer!
- I'm sorry.

1180
01:30:26,977 --> 01:30:28,543
Come on!

1181
01:30:53,327 --> 01:30:55,173
Coming through.

1182
01:31:00,676 --> 01:31:04,199
- Steady, sir. Who are you here for?
- Elizabeth Cree. Say I'm not too late.

1183
01:31:04,279 --> 01:31:06,720
They're just taking her down.
Quick as you can.

1184
01:31:07,678 --> 01:31:09,543
Send for the magistrate!

1185
01:31:13,578 --> 01:31:15,927
Stop! Stop!

1186
01:31:26,107 --> 01:31:29,952
Don't thank me yet. All they've given me is
an hour's grace to speak to the magistrate.

1187
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:32,232
I've still to convince him
to reduce your sentence.

1188
01:31:32,312 --> 01:31:35,565
Don't be glum. You have the Golem.

1189
01:31:35,645 --> 01:31:39,095
The world will know
the real story, and it's you...

1190
01:31:39,175 --> 01:31:43,259
...you who will know
every chapter, who will tell it.

1191
01:31:43,678 --> 01:31:46,702
- You have my gratitude. Always.
- And you mine.

1192
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:56,241
Lizzie, Lizzie, don't.

1193
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:03,065
Could any believe John Cree
capable of such deeds?

1194
01:32:03,145 --> 01:32:05,132
I guarantee it.

1195
01:32:05,212 --> 01:32:07,240
Have no doubt.

1196
01:32:09,644 --> 01:32:11,707
Then let us bring this to an end.

1197
01:32:17,877 --> 01:32:20,266
Here's what you will write.

1198
01:32:20,346 --> 01:32:24,565
"I am Elizabeth Cree,
and in September of this year...

1199
01:32:24,645 --> 01:32:27,261
...I came to know that my husband...

1200
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,063
...was the Limehouse Golem."

1201
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,740
All you need to do is tell the truth.

1202
01:32:34,144 --> 01:32:37,182
I have never told you anything
but the truth, Kildare.

1203
01:33:18,595 --> 01:33:20,840
You shall have your moment, and I mine.

1204
01:33:24,584 --> 01:33:28,820
In the temple of fame, our names will be
written side-by-side in stone for all time.

1205
01:33:38,111 --> 01:33:40,199
Who was here on September the 24th?

1206
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:42,631
There were four men
in the reading room that day...

1207
01:33:42,711 --> 01:33:46,540
...but there's no earthly way of knowing
what anyone read or when they read it.

1208
01:33:50,944 --> 01:33:54,377
John. You're home. I didn't hear you come in.

1209
01:33:57,977 --> 01:34:01,999
<i>There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.</i>

1210
01:34:02,578 --> 01:34:05,627
<i>I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.</i>

1211
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:10,078
<i>I no longer feel safe under my own roof.</i>

1212
01:34:10,677 --> 01:34:12,707
<i>I cannot go on like this.</i>

1213
01:34:15,644 --> 01:34:18,202
<i>Still, we had agreement
to keep each other's secrets.</i>

1214
01:34:18,282 --> 01:34:21,985
<i>And you didn't keep mine, did you?
I wonder what I should do with yours.</i>

1215
01:34:22,065 --> 01:34:24,306
I think you should take it to the grave.

1216
01:35:00,645 --> 01:35:02,373
Mr. Gerrard, sir?

1217
01:35:18,645 --> 01:35:20,174
Annie?

1218
01:35:38,377 --> 01:35:43,084
I know, I know. Few would think
a woman capable of such artistry.

1219
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:06,896
Here we are again!

1220
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:54,940
You were too late?

1221
01:36:57,476 --> 01:37:01,098
This... this is probably the last thing
you want at present...

1222
01:37:01,177 --> 01:37:03,260
...but they're waiting for you downstairs.

1223
01:37:05,045 --> 01:37:07,540
You're about to be the toast of London, John.

1224
01:37:14,343 --> 01:37:16,831
I know how much you cared for her.

1225
01:37:16,911 --> 01:37:18,465
Just...

1226
01:37:19,344 --> 01:37:21,756
...know how grateful she would be
that the world will know...

1227
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,798
...what her bastard husband really was.

1228
01:37:24,878 --> 01:37:29,701
Not just as a murderer, but as a man who
sought to deny her all she wanted to be.

1229
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:32,256
It's you who saved her honor.

1230
01:37:34,443 --> 01:37:36,273
Her memory.

1231
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,974
She would've wanted you to have this.

1232
01:37:58,744 --> 01:38:01,589
No! We must wait for him. Please!
This is wrong, he will prove it!

1233
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:04,709
- I beg you, just a little longer!
- I...

1234
01:38:05,745 --> 01:38:10,296
I don't believe Inspector Kildare
will be coming back.

1235
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:18,688
- I am not a poisoner.
- I believe you.

1236
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,665
I am so much more.

1237
01:38:20,745 --> 01:38:26,147
We shall be issuing our full report
on John Cree in an hour, gentlemen.

1238
01:38:26,227 --> 01:38:29,098
Well, it seems the show must go on.

1239
01:38:30,077 --> 01:38:33,898
Londoners can sleep easy in their beds again.

1240
01:38:33,978 --> 01:38:35,831
The Golem is no more.

1241
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:39,577
Inspector! Inspector,
any comments on your promotion, sir?

1242
01:38:42,331 --> 01:38:45,440
- Any last words?
- Here we are again!

1243
01:40:09,173 --> 01:40:10,977
Let us begin...

1244
01:40:11,057 --> 01:40:12,906
...my friends...

1245
01:40:13,544 --> 01:40:15,386
...at the end.

1246
01:41:08,976 --> 01:41:13,578
Not the green, love, the red.
Mother doesn't get sick until scene four.

1247
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:23,006
Did anyone check the safety?

1248
01:41:34,343 --> 01:41:36,573
Take her weight. Take...

1249
01:41:40,743 --> 01:41:42,598
What's going on?

1250
01:41:43,477 --> 01:41:45,072
Is she breathing?

1251
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:53,014
We have to get back out there.

1252
01:41:54,956 --> 01:41:56,980
You're Lizzie's mother now.

1253
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:12,859
I'll be Lizzie.

1254
01:42:52,194 --> 01:42:53,737
Lizzie!
