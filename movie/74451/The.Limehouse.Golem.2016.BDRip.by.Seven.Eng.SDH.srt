I do remember reading
of that one.

167
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:14,081
- "Old Salty."
- Her name was Jane Quig.

168
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:16,751
The point is there's no story
to any of them.

169
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:20,129
Men, women, young, old. Jew
and Christian. Rich and poor.

Perhaps he just likes to kill.

No.

a tale being told.

of damnation to comprehend it.

If I may say, sir,

175

Well, as I said
back in Limehouse...

186

Well, perhaps

It's quoted in an old piece by
the essayist Thomas De Quincey.

as One of the Fine Arts."

202

Highway killings of 1811.

This is a reading room,
Inspector, not a local library.

Who was here
on September the 24th?

There were four men in
the reading room that day. Why?

Entitled "Misery Junction."

It was... not a success.

I believe he never
recovered from that.

Kildare and John Cree: [Distorted
] September the 5th, 1880.

327
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:26,406
It was a fine bright evening...

328
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:29,243
John Cree: And I could feel
a murder coming on.

329
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,412
Since it was to be
my first show,

330
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:35,916
I decided by way of inspiration
to pay a visit to the site

331
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,752
of the immortal
Ratcliffe Highway murders.

332
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:41,588
More than half a century ago
on this sacred spot,

333
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:44,633
an entire family was
dispatched into eternity

334
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:47,094
by a man named John Williams,

335
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:48,929
a man Thomas De Quincey
described

336
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:51,640
as an artist of exquisite skill.

337
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,768
And yet now the site
of his greatest work was defiled

338
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,479
by a seller
of secondhand clothes.

339
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,941
We're closed, I'm afraid, sir.

340
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,484
[Normal voice] Oh, sorry.

342
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:05,779
No matter.

343
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:09,283
I'll be sure to return.

344
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:12,619
[Distorted] But I was
a beginner, an understudy.

345
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:15,622
Not yet ready
for the great stage.

346
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,179
An artist must
perfect his craft,

347
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:34,808
and tonight I would start
with a small, private rehearsal.

348
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,310

349

[Normal voice] Don't you think
you've had enough?

350

suspected my game from the start

354
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,009
and offered herself willingly,

355
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:10,844
warm in the knowledge
that the world

356
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,889
would soon be forced to confront
the plight of her kind.

[Breathes shakily]

358

I took out her eyes in case

359
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,692
my image had been
imprinted upon them,

360
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,628
and washed the blood
from my hands with the gin

361
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:29,571
in her chamber pot.

362
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:34,076

was complete.

Mrs. Cree? I'm Inspector Kildare
of Scotland Yard.

365
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,204
I suppose you're here
to chastise me

366
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,230
for my candor in court.
On the contrary,

367
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:04,940
I applaud you for it.

368
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,733
It's all too easy
to imagine that those

369
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,068
who have enjoyed success

370
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:10,737
have never known suffering.

371
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,074
Well, to quote the great
Dan Leno, "Here we are again."

372
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:17,953
I'm afraid I'm not a frequenter
of the music halls.

373
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,080

the suffering of women.

374

My gender becomes
inured to injustice.

375

Until we can greet it
merely with a shrug.

377
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:29,256
Oh.
I understood he was a comic.

378
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:33,760
The line between comedy
and tragedy is a fine one.

379
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,887
You haven't told me
why you're here.

380
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:42,811
I wish to put it to you that
I know why you might have had

381
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,938
good reason
to poison your husband.

382
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:46,940
Please, sir, I'm hoarse
from repetition.

383
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:49,043
There will be no confession.
My plea has been made.

384
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:52,320
Mrs. Cree, I'm not
assigned to your case.

385
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:55,782
I'm here because your husband
is a suspect in...

386
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,117
another matter.

387
00:21:57,242 --> 00:22:00,954
What matter?

388
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,623
A journal has been found.

389
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,625
I'd like to compare
the handwriting with his.

390
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,961
Might you have anything
that he wrote?

391
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,963
- His papers...
- He burned them, yes.

392
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:14,968
Mrs. Cree, if your husband were
found to have committed murder,

393
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,637
your claims of suicide
gain weight.

I'm investigating
a series of deaths.

397

They're calling them
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

398
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:27,248
You can't honestly think my
husband capable of such things?

399
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:29,983
It's not my place
to have an opinion.

400

I just follow the threads.

401
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:34,654
The newspaper said it was
your first murder case.

402

of chance to be given.

404

I wanted to be
a serious actress, you know.

405

486
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:24,879
Aveline, dear, nice and hot,
just as you like it.

487
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:28,675
But not quite so big.

488
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,677
Woman: Thanks, Uncle.

489
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:47,026
Last one's for you, Mr. Leno.

490
00:28:47,151 --> 00:28:49,070
Mr. Leno, is it?

491
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:51,865
Did you find her at the grocers,
Uncle?

492
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,033
She's certainly a green one.
[Women giggle]

493
00:28:54,158 --> 00:28:57,871
Now, now, girls.

494
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:00,373
- What's your name?
- Lizzie, sir.

495
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:02,876
Lambeth Marsh Lizzie.

496
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,378
I thought I could
smell marsh gas.

497
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:07,881
Oh, don't let 'em dumb you.
It's just their way.

498
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,216
And call me Dan.

499
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:11,718
This is Tommy Farr,

500
00:29:11,843 --> 00:29:15,054
theater manager
and keeper of the bunce.

501
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,599
Speaking of which, we owe you
something for your trouble.

502
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:22,061
[Coins clink]

503
00:29:22,186 --> 00:29:24,397
What in God's name did
they have you doing down there

504
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:26,274
in those marshes?

505
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,903
Digging graves.

506
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:31,571
Five years it was
before I found out

507
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:34,240
you're supposed to use a shovel.

508
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,950
[Chuckles] I like this one.

509
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,243
Can you read?

510
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:38,620
Like a native.

511
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,538
Here.

512
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:46,920
Lizzie: "What's fame?"

513
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:49,297
A fancy'd life
in other's breath.

514
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:52,759
A thing beyond us,
even before our death.

515
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:55,595
All we feel of it begins
and ends in the small circle

516
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,806
"of our foes and friends."

517
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,434
That's my favorite line.

518
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,437
Alexander Pope.

519
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:05,939
Are you looking for work,
Lizzie?

520
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:07,482
Yeah.

521
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,109
Only, our prompter ran off
with a Lion Comique.

522
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:11,444
And it won't all be lavender.

523
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:12,755
There'll be some
fetch and carry,

524
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,280
but there's decent bunce

525
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:18,284
and room in the digs
with the dancers.

526
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,954
What do you say?

527
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:27,001
How would you describe
your relationship with Dan Leno?

528
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,461
Lizzie: We were friends, sir.

529
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:31,297
And he was... my mentor.

530
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:32,966
He took me under his wing.

531
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:35,301
Dan: "No, Mrs. Killian"...

532
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,806
Where did you learn
to read and write

533
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,683
if you didn't go to school?

534
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:45,478
My mother's Bible, I suppose.

535
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:47,188
[Laughs]

536
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,816
Oh, and speaking of books...

537
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,526
Oi.

538
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:53,152
- Thank you.
- Dan: What?

539
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:54,821
Finished already?

540
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,823
That's the second this week!

541
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,369
Lizzie: I think books might be
my first love.

542
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:05,873
And I've always heard it said
that first love is insatiable.

543
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,834
Sod writing new gags,

544
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,503
they can have the Milkmaid again
tonight and like it.

545
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,673
I want to show you something.

546
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:15,049
Where are we going?

547
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,342
Dan: You'll see.

548
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,848
A whole room?

549
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:24,225
Full of books?

550
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,144
Every inch of it.

551
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,290
Lizzie:
People come here just to read?

552
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:34,027
To read. To learn. To create.

553
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:37,196
It's like... a great furnace.

554
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:40,533
I mean, the future
is being forged here.

555
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:44,871
Writers, philosophers,
men of science.

556
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:47,582
All the way down
to lowly clowns like me.

557
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:50,585
The ladies' table is upstairs.

558
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,213
[Mockingly] Oh, thanking you
kindly, good sir.

559
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:56,549
You were never
more than friends?

560
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:58,051
Lizzie: No, sir.

561
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:01,721
I believe he felt
protective of me.

562
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:04,223
The prosecution wishes
to remind the court

563
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:06,392
that Mr. Leno
was recently questioned

564
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:10,063
in connection with
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

565
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:11,331
Defense: Objection, Your Honor!

566
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:12,732
[Indistinct shouting]

567
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:14,337
Judge: Order, order!
[Gavel banging]

568
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,405
Inspector Kildare!

569
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,407
Kildare!

570
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:24,535
[Reporters shouting
indistinctly]

571
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,585
Why was I not aware

572
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,754
that Dan Leno
was previously a suspect?

573
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:36,631
You tell me, Kildare.

574
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,424
It was in every daily newspaper.

575
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,968
But not in the brief
you gave me.

576
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,096
Well, he was eliminated
from inquiries.

577
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:44,931
The, uh, report's
on my desk somewhere.

578
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,601
You didn't think to place
it in your files?

579
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:51,312
The streets of London
run red with blood,

580
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:55,775
and you concern yourself
with paperwork?

581
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,486
You'd have made
a fine politician, Kildare,

582
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,614
were you not
the topic of such...

583
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,241
speculation.

584
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:09,956
Kildare: I wouldn't read that.

585
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:12,333
Disgraceful lies, all of it.

586
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,961
The poor woman spoke
of misfortune and cruelty

587
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:16,504
and they've turned it upon her.

588
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:18,965
Makes my blood boil.

589
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,177
Seems your beloved Leno
wasn't actually a suspect.

590
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:24,804
My beloved?

591
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:26,472
What man doesn't enjoy Dan Leno?

592
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:28,641
One who doesn't care
for the music halls?

593
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:32,311
Well, I'll venture to say you've
not seen the right shows, sir.

594
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:34,147
If you ever wish
for a recommendation...

595
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:38,484
He was questioned in regard
to Alice Stanton's gown.

596
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:41,654
A label sewn into it
identified it as his,

597
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:44,323
a stage costume.
So he knew her?

598
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,135
Kildare: "Leno stated that
the dress was part"

599
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,869
of a consignment
of stage costumes

600
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:49,162
he'd sold a year earlier

601
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:50,830
"to a purveyor of
secondhand clothes."

602
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:52,808
And apparently he provided
a receipt which proved it.

603
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,309
Well, then it was merely
a coincidence.

604
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,335
Kildare: Perhaps.

605
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,045
As is perhaps the fact

606
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:00,173
that the purveyor of
secondhand clothes

607
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,676
was the late Mr. Gerrard,

608
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,678
murdered at Ratcliffe Highway.

609
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:07,388
We should get a sample
of his hand.

610
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,491
Quite. And can we find out
what's happened to that dress?

611
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,951
It wasn't with the rest
of the evidence.

612
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,518
I'll look into it, sir.

613
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:25,031
Why didn't you tell me
you questioned Dan Leno?

614
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,741
I haven't.
Though I shall have to.

615
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,034
In court they said you had.

616
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,412
Not me.
Before I joined the case.

617
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:35,249
So is he a suspect or not?

618
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,709
Do you think he should be?

619
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,211
Please don't play games with me.

620
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:39,754
I have no desire to!

621
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,547
The Golem is still at large.

622
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:44,217
Wasting my time
could cost lives.

623
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:52,099
Unless you are correct
about my husband.

624
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:54,727
If the Golem is no more,
then none are at risk.

625
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:59,232
Besides yours...

626
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:04,403
You needn't hang, Mrs. Cree.

627
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,906
Please call me Lizzie.

628
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,743
Just assist me in assisting you.

629
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:12,286
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

630
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:15,539
All I ask is that you
tell me what you do.

631
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,460
Where should I start?

632
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:23,589
How you came to know
John Cree, perhaps.

633
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:27,635
Dan: Jim is very partial to me!

634
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,262
Though never a word has he said.

635
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:31,639
Right now he's lodging
with Mrs. Kelly.

636
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:32,974
Do you know Mrs. Kelly?

637
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,268
Don't you know Mrs. Kelly?

638
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:37,311
Good life-a-mighty,
don't look so simple.

639
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,480
Everybody knows Mrs. Kelly.

640
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,208
Am I... Am I going too fast
for you, love?

641
00:35:41,232 --> 00:35:42,441
You spoof it, I'll write it.

642
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:43,943
Oh, she's a mean one,
Mrs. Kelly.

643
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:45,254
She'll buy half a dozen oysters

644
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:46,380
and eat them
in front of a mirror

645
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,489
to make them look like a dozen.

646

upon the stage.

It's what they pay for.

Yeah, but they expect
to see a happy ending.

Someone kindly, like Uncle.

he wouldn't live

I would like to
give her a suitor.

for her well-being.

through the trap just there.

Oh, the noose is real,

of Scotland Yard.

1161

Perhaps you could explain
how this came to be

of a murdered woman.

My wife, Nell, is in the habit
of... going missing.

1166
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:31,489
I give my address so that

1167

they may contact me
if they see her.

That a gentleman like me,

should have wed a fallen woman.

to pass before dark,

1190
01:02:26,711 --> 01:02:30,548
so I paid a visit
to the Ratcliffe Highway shop.

I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife.

I read of the mythical Golem,

01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,061
I knew him well.

1283
01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:19,897
Oh, now, you mentioned needing
a sample of my hand.

1284
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:22,733
Well, I-I-I brought a pile
of my old papers.

1285
01:08:22,858 --> 01:08:24,735
Please, take as many
as you see fit.

1286
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,946
I'm afraid I'll need you
to produce a sample

1287
01:08:27,071 --> 01:08:30,950
in my presence, Mr. Leno.

1288
01:08:31,075 --> 01:08:32,743
Then you will permit me
to pay you a visit

1289
01:08:32,868 --> 01:08:34,954
at Scotland Yard
tomorrow afternoon?

1290
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:38,290
Only,
I have supper arrangements.

1291
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:41,585
And I've still to be rid
of all of this.

1292
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:43,587
If you'll... excuse me?

1293
01:08:43,712 --> 01:08:45,089
Kildare:
Perhaps we could continue

1294
01:08:45,214 --> 01:08:47,967
to talk while you're...

1295
01:08:48,092 --> 01:08:53,597
I've some questions I'd like to
ask you about John Cree.

1296
01:08:53,722 --> 01:08:55,307
Then I shall try to answer them.

1297
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:57,434
Though one should never
speak ill of the dead.

1298
01:08:57,559 --> 01:08:58,769
You didn't care for the man?

1299
01:08:58,894 --> 01:09:00,271
I was friendly with his wife.

1300
01:09:00,396 --> 01:09:01,772
He made her unhappy.

1301
01:09:01,897 --> 01:09:04,149
You may extrapolate the rest.

1302
01:09:04,275 --> 01:09:06,777
When did you last see him?

1303
01:09:06,902 --> 01:09:09,822
First night of his play,
"Misery Junction,"

1304
01:09:09,947 --> 01:09:11,782
which also happened
to be the closing night.

1305
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:14,451
I know.
Did you see him afterwards?

1306
01:09:14,576 --> 01:09:15,619
Dan: Of course.

1307
01:09:15,744 --> 01:09:18,330
This is my theatre.

1308
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,793
I took over managing it
last year when...

1309
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:26,130
Uncle joined the great pantomime
in the sky.

1310
01:09:26,255 --> 01:09:28,507
The performance was here?

1311
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:30,301
For Lizzie's sake.

1312
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:32,970
Whatever became
of our friendship,

1313
01:09:33,095 --> 01:09:36,807
we'll always be family.

1314
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:38,475
Is John Cree a suspect?

1315
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,977
I'm not at liberty to say.

1316
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:41,812
Dan: A posthumous suspect.

1317
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:43,647
What will you do,
dig him up for the trial?

1318
01:09:43,772 --> 01:09:45,250
Kildare:
Do you know why Lizzie might be

1319
01:09:45,274 --> 01:09:48,819
reluctant to voice
any suspicions?

1320
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:51,697
You think she's protecting him?

1321
01:09:51,822 --> 01:09:54,158
Now, that's a novel slant.

1322
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:57,995
Most people believe
she poisoned him.

1323
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,622
Do you?

1324
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,671
Either way, that man was
the author of his own demise.

1325
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:10,007
He practically destroyed her.

1326
01:10:10,132 --> 01:10:11,452
Insisting she give up
the stage...

1327
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:14,678
I mean, he may as well
have ended her life.

1328
01:10:14,803 --> 01:10:18,182
Kildare: Do you think he
was capable of ending a life?

1329
01:10:18,307 --> 01:10:21,727
Literally, I mean.

1330
01:10:21,852 --> 01:10:25,856
Who knows what any man
is capable of?

1331
01:10:25,981 --> 01:10:28,525
We all wear pantomime masks,

1332
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,027
do we not?

1333
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:34,698
I'm sorry,
I really must dress now.

1334
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:37,493
First, tell me
about Little Victor.

1335
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:42,373
If the injustices of the past
interest you,

1336
01:10:42,498 --> 01:10:45,876
you'd do better to look into
the demise of Tommy Farr.

1337
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:47,711
Uncle?

1338
01:10:47,836 --> 01:10:50,047
Uncle.

1339

[Keys jangle, door opens]

1340

[Door closes]

1341
01:11:00,516 --> 01:11:01,934
They said the jury expects

1342
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:03,727
to reach a verdict
this afternoon.

1343
01:11:03,852 --> 01:11:05,729
I know. Lizzie...

1344
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:06,897
It would seem the press

1345
01:11:07,022 --> 01:11:09,525
have reached theirs already.

1346
01:11:11,693 --> 01:11:13,404
Lizzie, I spoke with Dan.

1347
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:17,408
He urged me to look
into Uncle's death.

1348
01:11:17,533 --> 01:11:18,843
If you wanted to know
about Uncle,

1349
01:11:18,867 --> 01:11:20,911
you should simply have asked.

1350
01:11:21,036 --> 01:11:23,622
Come into the parlor.

1351
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:27,418
As the spider said to the fly.

1352
01:11:27,543 --> 01:11:29,294
Isn't that how it goes?

1353

The rhyme?

1354
01:11:30,712 --> 01:11:33,424
It may be, Lizzie.

1355
01:11:33,549 --> 01:11:35,592
It may be.

1356
01:11:35,717 --> 01:11:36,760
Cucumber sandwich?

1357
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:37,761
No, thanks.

1358
01:11:37,886 --> 01:11:39,596
Uncle: Oh, I forgot.

1359
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,932
You're not entirely partial
to cucumber, are you?

1360
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:47,438
What's this about, Uncle?

1361
01:11:47,563 --> 01:11:49,940
Why'd you invite me?

1362
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:51,775
I want to show you something.

1363
01:11:53,277 --> 01:11:54,903
Well, close your eyes.

1364
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:58,615
Good girl.

[Giggles]

Shh!

1367
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:26,810
It's just my fun, Lizzie.

1368
01:12:26,935 --> 01:12:30,522
I like a good beating
every now and again.

1369
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,649
Doesn't everyone?

1370
01:12:32,774 --> 01:12:34,818
I know her.

1371
01:12:34,943 --> 01:12:36,463
That's the girl who assisted
the Great Bolini.

1372
01:12:36,487 --> 01:12:38,030
She used to be sawn in half.

1373
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:39,990
That's her, ducks.

1374
01:12:40,115 --> 01:12:43,327
What a performer.

1375
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:45,829
But it's a shame she had
to leave the company.

1376
01:12:45,954 --> 01:12:47,664
Why have you shown me this?

1377
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:49,166
Don't play the innocent with me.

1378

I am not playing.
I am real.

Well, I'd be grateful
if you could oblige me, Lizzie,

with a pose, a tableau.

1381
01:12:57,966 --> 01:12:59,510
Perhaps a little beating?

1382
01:12:59,635 --> 01:13:01,303
I'd rather be destroyed first.

1383
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:05,116
I'm prepared to forget
this visit ever took place.

1384
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,852
Well, as I said,
it is a pity she had to go.

1385
01:13:08,977 --> 01:13:11,188
She grew tired of performing.

1386
01:13:11,313 --> 01:13:14,024
You would never be rid of me.

1387
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:16,693
Dan would never allow it.

1388
01:13:16,818 --> 01:13:19,530
Uncle: Well, I find,
as keeper of bunce,

1389
01:13:19,655 --> 01:13:22,699
that I can do as I please.

1390
01:13:22,824 --> 01:13:27,204
Now, you keep my secret

1391
01:13:27,329 --> 01:13:29,039
and I'll keep yours.

1392

to him next Sunday

1395
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:52,271
and every Sunday hereafter.

1396
01:13:52,396 --> 01:13:55,065
To do the same again?

1397
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,943
There's photographs.

1398
01:13:58,068 --> 01:13:59,170
John, I had to speak
of it to somebody.

1399
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:00,737
This is monstrous, Lizzie!

1400
01:14:00,862 --> 01:14:02,864
You can't tell a soul.

1401
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,078
I shall put a stop to this.

1402
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:11,081
But first...

1403
01:14:11,206 --> 01:14:12,457
I wish to do this.

01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,752
He's robbed you of your honor.

1405

Let me restore it to you.

1406
01:14:20,382 --> 01:14:24,261
Uncle died three days
after John confronted him.

1407
01:14:24,386 --> 01:14:25,637
Uncle was not young.

1408
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,764
He had a weak heart
and a fondness for drink.

1409
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:29,766
That's not what Dan Leno thinks.

1410
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:32,603
He thinks that John blackmailed
Uncle into changing his will

1411
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:34,271
and then killed him.

1412

It would seem I gave
an excellent beating.

You don't want
to be saved, do you?

Three years of courtship
and endless bloody engagement.

[Keys jangle, door opens]

1601
01:24:47,342 --> 01:24:49,052
While that chance remains,
I have no choice

1602
01:24:49,177 --> 01:24:50,929
but to cling to it.

1603
01:24:57,352 --> 01:24:59,395
Judge: Have the jury
reached a verdict?

1604
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,231
Yes, my lord.

1605
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:04,234
Judge: How do the jury
find the defendant?

1606
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:05,944
Guilty.
[Indistinct shouting]

01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:07,737

Order!
[Gavel bangs]

1609
01:25:09,864 --> 01:25:13,785
Elizabeth Cree, you will be
returned to prison

1610
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,913
and taken from there
to a place of execution,

1611
01:25:17,038 --> 01:25:18,748
where at 10:00 tomorrow morning,

1612
01:25:18,873 --> 01:25:22,085
you will be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

1613
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,921
May the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

1614
01:25:25,046 --> 01:25:26,756
Inspector Kildare,
Scotland Yard.

1615
01:25:26,881 --> 01:25:28,383
I need a moment with her,
please.

1616
01:25:32,553 --> 01:25:33,638
You don't deserve this.

1617
01:25:33,763 --> 01:25:35,163
It's done.
I hang tomorrow at 10:00.

1618
01:25:35,223 --> 01:25:36,933
No.
I won't let it happen.

1619
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:38,476
John Cree was a murderer.

1620
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:40,770
I mean to prove it
and appeal for your pardon.

1621
01:25:40,895 --> 01:25:42,814
The world needs
to know the truth.

[Indistinct shouting]

1623

I'd like for you
to unmask the Golem.

1624
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,490
This is your moment,
your chance.

1625
01:25:52,615 --> 01:25:54,218
I'd like for you to have that.
[Door opens]

1626
01:25:54,242 --> 01:25:55,522
I'm sorry, sir.
We need to leave.

1627
01:25:58,579 --> 01:26:00,164
Kildare:
We don't have much time.

1628
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:02,101
The manuscript of "Misery
Junction" is handwritten.

1629
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:03,334
Dan may still have it.

1630
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:05,795
I shall stop this.
I promise you.

1631

Here we are again!
[Cheers and applause]

1638
01:26:32,822 --> 01:26:35,825
Lizzie paid for the hire
of the theatre.

1639
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:38,828
I advised her against it,
but she was adamant.

1640
01:26:38,953 --> 01:26:40,204
And it was not a success.

1641
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:42,040
[Distant laughter]

1642
01:26:42,165 --> 01:26:43,833
That's putting it mildly.

1643
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:46,377
So put it any way that you will.

1644
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:48,046
Dan: Barely any tickets sold,

1645
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:51,007
but Lizzie insisted
on a full house,

1646
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:54,177
so she took to the streets
and gave them away to the poor.

1647
01:26:56,637 --> 01:26:57,638
Ah.

1648

[Latch jangles]

[Sighs]

1653
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:14,530
It's typeset.

1654

Oh, I don't have the original
manuscript, I'm afraid.

1655
01:27:17,825 --> 01:27:19,869
A usual practice is
to have it archived,

1656
01:27:19,994 --> 01:27:22,205
unless the author asks
for it back, which he didn't.

1657
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:24,248
Archived... Where?

1658
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:27,710
Flood: The librarian agreed
to open up early, sir.

1659

He should be here any moment.

But this is most odd.

1673
01:28:24,725 --> 01:28:25,725
Should be here.

1674
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:27,770
Could someone have withdrawn it?

1675
01:28:27,895 --> 01:28:30,648
Not unless they did so just now.

Unhand me!
I've done nothing wrong.

1679
01:28:40,908 --> 01:28:43,619
Then perhaps you can tell us
why the hurry to obtain this?

1680
01:28:43,744 --> 01:28:45,788
I plan to rewrite it, sir.

1681
01:28:45,913 --> 01:28:46,956
Demand a production.

1682
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:49,834
A topical shocker
about Lizzie Cree.

1683
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:51,836
Now she's to be hanged,
it'll be a smash.

1684
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:53,230
Flood: Really?
So you're a writer now,

1685

are you, Miss Ortega?

1686

Aveline:
[Laughs] No, sir.

1687
01:28:55,756 --> 01:28:57,967
But it won't require much work.

1688
01:28:58,092 --> 01:29:00,136
It was the story of her life,
after all.

1689
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:03,473
My idea is to begin
the play at the gallows,

1690
01:29:03,598 --> 01:29:05,516
then retrace each step
that led her to them.

1691
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:08,478
I cannot help but think that the
addition of a murderous husband

1692
01:29:08,603 --> 01:29:09,812
might be popular.

1693
01:29:09,937 --> 01:29:12,982
I told you all I know, sir.

1694
01:29:13,107 --> 01:29:14,817
John is innocent.

01:29:49,977 --> 01:29:51,187
Jesus!

1696
01:29:51,312 --> 01:29:53,856
You're the ones
who'll be forgotten!

1697
01:29:53,981 --> 01:29:54,982
Not me.

1698
01:30:01,989 --> 01:30:03,199
Lizzie: Is it time?

1699
01:30:03,324 --> 01:30:05,368
There's no one here.

1700
01:30:05,493 --> 01:30:08,037
They hardly ever admit the
public these days, Mrs. Cree.

1701
01:30:08,162 --> 01:30:10,206
Only for the most hated.

1702
01:30:10,331 --> 01:30:12,583
Please, no.
You must help me.

1703
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:14,210
Please.
Please tell them to wait.

- Inspector Kildare is coming.
- I'm sorry.

Can't you go any faster?

Prison's just around the corner.

1707
01:30:20,174 --> 01:30:21,217
I know!

1708
01:30:21,342 --> 01:30:23,219
No, we must wait
for him, please.

1709
01:30:23,344 --> 01:30:24,584
This is wrong!
He will prove it!

1710
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:25,959
I beg you, just a little longer!

Say I'm not too late.

1719
01:31:10,391 --> 01:31:13,102
They're just taking her down.
Quick as you can.

1720
01:31:13,227 --> 01:31:14,604
Send for the magistrate!

Don't thank me yet.

1724
01:31:33,247 --> 01:31:34,433
All they've given me
is an hour's grace

1725
01:31:34,457 --> 01:31:35,958
to speak to the magistrate.

1726
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:37,894
I've still to convince him
to reduce your sentence.

1727
01:31:37,918 --> 01:31:39,462
Don't be glum.

1728
01:31:39,587 --> 01:31:41,130
You have the Golem.

1729
01:31:41,255 --> 01:31:44,467
The world will know
the real story, and it's you...

1730
01:31:44,592 --> 01:31:49,305
you who will know every chapter,
who will tell it.

1731
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:50,973
You have my gratitude.
Always.

1732
01:31:51,098 --> 01:31:53,768
And you mine.

Kildare:
Lizzie, Lizzie, don't.

1734
01:32:06,614 --> 01:32:08,895
Lizzie: Could any believe John
Cree capable of such deeds?

1735
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:10,993
I guarantee it.

1736
01:32:11,118 --> 01:32:12,286
Have no doubt.

1737
01:32:15,331 --> 01:32:17,124
Then let us bring
this to an end.

1738
01:32:23,464 --> 01:32:26,175
Here's what you will write.

was the Limehouse Golem."

1741

All you need to do
is tell the truth.

I have never told you anything
but the truth, Kildare.

In the temple of fame, our names
will be written side-by-side

in stone for all time.

1751

Kildare: Who was here
on September the 24th?

1752
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,525
Rowley: There were four men
in the reading room that day,

1753
01:33:48,549 --> 01:33:49,989
but there's no earthly way
of knowing

1754
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:52,386
what anyone read
or when they read it.

1755
01:33:56,932 --> 01:33:58,642
Lizzie: John. You're home.

1756
01:33:58,768 --> 01:34:00,102
I didn't hear you come in.

1757
01:34:03,397 --> 01:34:08,110
There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.

1758
01:34:08,235 --> 01:34:11,405
I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.

1759
